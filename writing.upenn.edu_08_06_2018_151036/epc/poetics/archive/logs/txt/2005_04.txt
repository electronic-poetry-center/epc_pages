Return to San Serriffe  (via BBC)

  When the world first heard of San Serriffe in April 1977, the tiny
state was a sleepy island paradise under the authoritarian leadership
of an unpopular general. Visiting the archipelago 22 years on, Berlin
Sans discovers a vibrant nation transformed by a visionary leader

   Thursday April 1, 1999

   The centre of Bodoni, the capital of San Serriffe, was, as ever,
confused last night as it prepared to celebrate the 22nd anniversary of
its discovery, the most dramatic event in the patchy - even blotchy -
history of this remote sea-girt nation.

  Previous anniversaries had been celebrated with little ceremony.
Indeed under the stern military rule of the strongman, General Pica,
and his obscure successor (note to subs: have forgotten his name,
please check) few Serriffeans felt they had much to celebrate.

  However, since free elections were held and the handsome, popular,
charismatic, boyish, charming, dynamic, modest, new leader Antonio
Bourgeois was catapulted into office, the atmosphere in San Serriffe
has been transformed. Nothing has actually happened, but the atmosphere
has been transformed.

  Regular followers of politics in this region will recall that San
Serriffe comprises two islands, Upper Caisse and Lower Caisse, shaped
curiously like a semi-colon, sited (usually) in the Indian Ocean. Since
the country briefly hit global headlines in 1977, Western journalists
have steered clear, in the belief that little was to be gained from
visiting these shores, particularly in the matter of expenses.

  However, the figure 22 has a peculiar symbolic power in the mystic
tradition of the Flong people, San Serriffe's indigenous tribe. There
are, for instance, (approximately) 22 people in a Serriffean cabinet,
22 verses in the national anthem and 22 miles between the Upper Caisse
port of Adze and Cap Em on the southern island. Accordingly,
traditionalists have this year secured funding from the San Serriffean
National Lottery for a full programme of cultural celebratory events.

  A mysterious large object is being erected for the occasion by the
banks of the Tempo River as a monument to Mr Bourgois's martyred
compadre, Pierre Myriad. Mr Myriad had planned to live there (despite
concerns that its 14 acres would be a little cramped) until he was
tragically struck a fatal blow on the head by a very large sum of
money. Now it will stand as the political memorial to a man whose fight
for an end to social inequality won him the undying love and admiration
of several of his political associates. The monument is to be decorated
with special wallpaper supplied by the Government's legal adviser, Lord
Grot.

  Much has changed since the long years of Pica-ist rule. General Pica
maintained an iron grip on power until being forced out in a palace
coup in 1990 by General Melior - known as The Obscure One - who tricked
his way into the General's Office under the pretext of clearing away
the coffee things. Pica is rarely spotted these days, emerging only
from the ex-presidential hideaway to drink cups of tea and reminisce
about torture techniques with other leaders from the old days. Elderly
recalcitrant Pica-ists have grouped themselves round An Even More
Obscure One, and conduct occasional meetings of dissidents in a Villa
Pica telephone booth.

  While General Pica was known to be flattered by occasional comparisons
to Britain's Margaret Thatcher, San Serriffe's current leader, Mr
Bourgeois, is a great admirer of current British policies and has
repeatedly sought inspiration for his fledgling democracy from the
successes of the Blair government. He has asked for a visit from
Britain's Prime Minister and was told San Serriffe had been
short-listed for a possible trip during Labour's fifth term, circa
2017.

  In the meantime, the Bourgeois government is attempting to follow its
own interpretation of Blairite policies. The principles of the Third
Way have been translated into Serriffean, in which they are generally
rendered as The Urinma Way or The Getoutama Way. The council of Flong
tribal elders, which has retained influence over San Serriffean
policies for generations, is to be abolished and replaced by a group of
the Bourgeois family's dining companions, known as Antonio's Cronios.
`Of course, Antonio's friends have done well since we took office,'
said his relentlessly charming spokesman Mr Courier. `Everyone is
Antonio's friend. Got that, fatface?' Power, meanwhile, is also being
devolved to the regions. On Lower Caisse, where resentment has always
festered about edicts from the distant capital, autonomy has been
granted under the slogan: `Lower caisse solutions for lower caisse
problems.' The Government is insisting only that it approves those
solutions in advance, and the identity of the people doing the solving.

  The minister formerly in charge of Lower Caisse has now been allowed
to pursue his special interest of encouraging public usage of urban
green spaces in the evenings. As a sign of his willingness to embrace
the best of Serriffean tradition even in post-modern society, Mr
Bourgeois allowed the new minister, a Mr Minion, to be elected using
the ancient tribal counting method whereby the candidate with the
fewest votes was declared the winner. This was such a success that it
may be employed again during the forthcoming election for the mayoralty
of Bodoni.

  Another example of the way San Serriffe is successfully blending old
and new comes during the annual budget statement when Mr Bembo, the
finance minister, regularly gets up and ritualistically shouts
`Everyone's rich, everyone's rich' whereupon all the members of the
legislature - the Fourniers - shout back: `We are, O wise one, we are.'
Mr Bourgois's deputy, Mr Baskerville, has taken personal responsibility
for the nation's transport system. He is often to be found on the
platforms at Bodoni Central or Perpetua Junction shouting at engine
drivers. Under a decree issued in the last days of General Pica's
obscure successor, trains were sold off by the Government under
instrructions that they could only be driven by girls who had never had
sexual intercourse. This is believed to explain the staff shortages.

  Mr Bembo takes the view that life is now so good for the average
Serriffean that travel is not a priority. Mr Baskerville himself, and
his colleague Mr Centaur - known humorously as the Enforcer - undertake
this arduous task on behalf of other Serriffeans and force themselves,
in the line of duty, to travel overseas in the front of aeroplanes,
which is well-known to be more dangerous than sitting at the back. This
hardship is readily endured by these brave men, who accept the
loneliness of command, though their souls ache to be able to commune
with other Serriffeans.

  The Government hopes to ensure that those of its people still forced
to eke out their days doing humdrum jobs, like making cars, will soon
be able to spend their days enjoying leisure pursuits without their
lives being polluted by the sordid distraction of making money.

  It is this thoughtfulness about the populace that has made the
Government so beloved, and the press coverage so adoring - that, and
the fact that Mr Courier has threatened to purge any elements on the
Government newspaper, Nugradia, who say anything to the contrary.

Brief history of a nation on the move

  1794 Captain Meriwether Lewis reports that waters immediately east of
the San Serriffe archipelago offer clear passage.

  1796 The schooner Excelsior, under Sir Charles Clarendon, runs aground
just east of the islands, prompting Clarendon to observe in his diary
that `the land is being eaten bye the see and raising hazardes to the
Island Easte'.

  1922 The San Serriffean football team is defeated 13-0 by England on
its first visit to Wembley.

  1967 San Serriffe acquires independence.

  1970 Scientists estimate that the process of erosion peculiar to the
islands is causing them to drift towards Sri Lanka at a rate of 1.4km a
year. Calculations suggest the islands will hit the coast of Sri Lanka
on January 3, 2011.

  1971 Regiments of General Pica's dismounted cavalry overthrow
government of General Minion.

  1972 San Serrife expelled from Commonwealth and Organisation of
Itinerant States (OIS).

  1973 Oil discovered off Caissa Superiore.

  1974 San Serriffe readmitted to Commonwealth and OIS, and invited to
join NATO.

  1977 A Guardian feature on the islands prompts $500 million of inward
investment in just 12 months.

  1980 San Serriffean football team is defeated 9-0 by England at
Wembley 1982 General Pica rescues flagging popularity by personally
leading commando force to liberate the island of Ova Mata, a Serriffean
protectorate, following an invasion by Adobe forces.

  1980 The San Serriffean football team is defeated 5-0 by England at
Wembley.

  1989 General Pica is deposed by cabal of senior officers who declare
they are tired of listening to his stories about the Ova Mata campaign.
General Melior, formerly Pica's gardener, is appointed president.

  1997 Antonio Bourgeois sweeps to power in island's first free
elections.

  1998 Newsweek runs cover story asking: `Is Bodoni the world's coolest
city?' 1999 The San Serriffean football team beats England 2-1 at
Wembley amid protests over an alleged hand-ball incident.

Robert Creeley was one of the most sensitive
poets I have ever met; and I've met many incredibly
sensitive poets.
A few months ago I was very surprised to receive
an email from him mentioning that he had not
seen me for awhile. Like Allen Ginsberg, he was
one of those poets who found a way to let everybody
who he cared about feel cared about by him.
How did he find the time? Obviously because that was one of
the things he most wanted to do with his time,
being a person who clearly
worked at benefiting from the wise
things he thought about, read and said.
Although I have been
a fan since college days, I had met him
only a few times, but these were
significant: hearing him read in the 60's
at St Marks, hanging out together at a party
at Charles Bernstein's place, years ago,
on Amsterdam Avenue, and hearing him
again recently at a group reading, with Michael Lally and others,
against the war in Iraq.  Also, he came to a couple of readings
I had been invited to give -a decade apart-
on his home turf at the Buffalo
poetics program. In the notes of my
very first poetry publication - in 1965- I credited
him as my most significant influence. I greatly admired
the importance he gave to relationships, and still do.
As a young man I believed it was mainly his use of language that
was inspiring me. Now I realize it was
not only this but his sensitivity in connecting the writing
of poetry to acquiring insight into people
and life that had so inspired and transformed me early on

I hadn't seen Bob for awhile so I signed up
to go to the Zukofsky conference a few
months ago at Columbia U. Creeley was to
speak and I was determined to hear him and to say hello.
The talk he gave is now famous for the anecdote
he told. As a young man, fairly penniless, he had
visited Zukofsky in the dead of winter, who had
insisted on giving him a coat. I can't reproduce,
no one could in fact, the poignancy with which
Creeley told this little fable that so deftly summed up
a great deal of what he knew and had to tell us about life.
Creeley's voice, his unique reading
and speaking style, had the capability of passionately,
and compassionately, conveying,  so deftly, so much of what he
knew about life, and he knew a lot. What we remember
are the kindnesses, that's all: not so much the brilliance,
or the great accomplishments, but the caring that goes into them.
Through his melodic, memorable poems,
his insight will survive, and will no doubt
continue to help us to, as it has for decades.

Since many poets are responding to Robert Creeley's death at this site, I, Tom Savage, will also.  I met him a number of times.  He was one of the first living poets I ever heard read, in an English class I was taking at Brooklyn College in 1966 or 1967.  I heard him many times after that at The Poetry Project and elsewhere.  But, today, it seems most appropriate to me to respond to his death by quoting my favorite poem of his.  It was published over twenty years ago in a series of poetry postcards published by Jeff Wright who reminded me of it by giving me another copy of the card several years ago.  It means a lot more to me now than it did when I first saw it years ago.  I hope it means something to those who will read it on this site:

         Sad Advice

If it isn't fun, don't do it
You'll have to do enought that isn't.

Such is life, like they say,
no one gets away without paying

and since you don't get to keep it
anyhow, who needs it.

Robert Creeley

I've been hesitant to write much in public about this, but have been
encouraged by others to send this to the poetics list. Such sharing does
seem particularly needed at this time.

Some of the things from the last 48  hours:

Partly due to Bob Creeley, back in 1978, I got started in "all this." And
the relationship with him has been the most enduring of any I have had in
this poetry world, right up to an exchange we had last week, where he
talked about being in Maine this summer, but hoped he might be of some
service to my daughter Kate, who may be attending a program at Brown in the
summer. Or several months ago, when I came across something in Reznikoff
almost exactly like a line Creeley had mentioned by Zukofsky when I saw Bob
at the Zuk event in September; sent a note to Bob, and he mused about
possibly dueling poets. I remember him getting up from sitting and signing
books at the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis once when he saw me walk into
the lobby, and he came over and hugged me and planted a kiss on my mouth.
Oh god I remember so much, maybe too much. I love him. I'm still grading
some test answers to a question about a Creeley poem. My children, at a
very young age, seeing me carry the collected poems, saying "Not Bob
Creeley AGAIN, Dad?" with a sense of humor, and then when Kate had to do a
paper on a poem, shyly asking if she could borrow my Creeley books. I
remember his grace and humanity, at all times. Maybe most when talking
humorously, yet near tears, about Duncan at a conference in Buffalo. I
think of his allegiance to people, how happy he was that I made it possible
to include an old friend & student of his from New Mexico, Dennis Williams,
at a dinner the university had for bob (or really, for their donors, but
with bob) when he was here two & a half years ago, and how much it meant to
Dennis, how much Bob meant to everyone.
ok i will stop but of course i won't.

when bob told me he was sick last week & what it was, it was just what my
mother had been suffering from, and she remains on oxygen though now out of
the hospital.

And I just jotted the following on a card while waiting while some car work
was done yesterday. It may fit after the piece for Jackson in my poem
"Pushing Water," or perhaps elsewhere, or perhaps will just be forgotten,
but Bob will always be close:

I am coming I
am always coming
am sometimes there
and here    here
you are    all the you
is where   here is

there *is* a story
the words *are* given
the woods thick and deep

the desert wide    alive

the wise surprised    all
going  coming  begun  undone

This is the place and
were I to deny the
fact of it    where
then am I    I
am coming I
am

the leaves have fallen
and sun warms
a world in which

will you come with
me    here  and  there

The Measure of the Man

I don't know how one takes the measure of a man like Robert Creeley.
The vividness apparent in his moment-to-moment living, in his
emphatic connection to the people and places in whose company he
found himself, the delight and astonishment in noticing again and
again merely that he was aware: these were all facets of an
awe-inspiring capacity for living of which his poetry is the partial
but substantial record.

The characteristic pose one found him in was CONVERSATION: the
paradox that a person of such exquisite self-consciousness and
insistent self-effacement was always out there in dialogue with
others.  I can't think of another person I've known who so
consistently lived his life as a conversation with other people.
That's one reason why the genre of the interview seemed as if it were
created particularly for Robert Creeley, whose ability to be present
during an interview and to use it as an occasion for thinking-rather
than for rehearsing stories or ideas that were pat-made him the
consummate interviewee.

He seemed like a man who packed several lives into the space of
seventy-nine years.  One measure of this would be a mating record of
biblical proportions: three wives and three families.  Another
measure would be the astonishing multitude of his friendships with
artists, writers, and former students.  An index for gauging the
numbers in that multitude would be to line up all of the blurbs,
forewords, and testimonials he wrote, of which there must be hundreds.

A year ago I heard Bob give a reading at the University of Chicago.
It took place in an old, wood-paneled lecture hall, which was so
packed that people were standing in the doorways at the back and
peering in through ivy-lined windows at the sides.  I was struck by
the haunted quality of the reading, by the way in which Bob invoked
almost ritualistically the spirits of his poetic cohort in his
remarks and even seemed to "channel" them in some of the recent
poetry he read.  Since he was the only one still alive, he took it as
his duty to keep their poetry alive alongside (or even inside) his
own.  There was an air of desperation, as if he were the only tether
holding poets such as Charles Olson, Robert Duncan, Allen Ginsberg,
and Denise Levertov onto the earth.  Again, what I found remarkable
was his primary sense of existing within a conversation, even when
all of the other speakers were dead.

His existence within a conversation can also be seen in his many
statements on poetics.  As soon as he began to speak about poetry,
Bob would immediately invoke talismanic passages by other poets (and
artists).  A Robert Creeley essay tends to take the form of a collage
rather than of a personal statement; he returns again and again to
particular formulations by writers he loves and keeps them in
dialogue with one another, making his own points by locating himself
within a particular company.  In fact, "company" was one of his
favorite words, and its root meaning of sharing bread is appropriate
to the sense of mutual nourishment he expected from an artistic
cohort.

It will be difficult to measure the extent of his influence as a poet
because it is so vast.  When as a young poet in the late sixties
under the influence of Creeley and his cohort I first read William
Carlos Williams, I was initially surprised by how unremarkable the
poetry seemed, as though I had already read many times before this
kind of lower-cased, conversational poetry attentive to the ordinary
and the everyday.  Then it dawned on me that the reason I found this
poetry unremarkable was that its influence had been so ubiquitous
that all of the poets I was reading were materially in its debt.  I
suspect that a young poet in the present era who turns to the work of
Robert Creeley might well have a similar experience-wondering what
all of the fuss is about because so many of the innovations and
stylistic discoveries he made have been incorporated by subsequent
generations.

One thing is certain: Robert Creeley was the master of the line
break.  No poet has been able to achieve a greater tension through
rhythmic, syntactic, and emotional uses of enjambment than he did.
That in itself is a poetic legacy of vast proportions, re-energizing
the poetic line by placing so much pressure on the breaks between
lines.

As Creeley never tired of insisting, the measure within a poetic line
is a way of measuring the world and one's participation in it.
"Measure" is at the base of human awareness, in the struggle to
create terms in which to fathom our experiences.  Robert Creeley
sought new measures that would accord with the generosity of spirit
in which he endeavored to reside.  I have been greatly nourished by
that generosity and find that his loss makes that generous vision all
the more precious.

I was happy to see the big tribute to Cid coming up, but was just talking
to Shizumi and she knows nothing about it.  Also, Sylvia, Cid's
youngest sister is still very much alive and kicking at 70, and would
probably try to attend any and all things relating to Cid state-side, if
she were only informed. Ditto for Cid's niece.  What's a memorial if
the people who knew and loved Cid and are of his very flesh are not
informed of it even if three renowned poets read all day and all night
and gather all the applause in the universe?  Jess

Subject:      Washington Post  on Creeley--pretty damn good!

Still trying to select some memories & tell them
right.  Just want to share the Washington Post obit
which I think is surely much better than that of the
NY Times--quotes him on words and nothing else as his
redemption, knows WHY he was driving an ambulance
abroad (WW2), generally sings it rather than wings it,
is resonant, informed...

Perhaps what bothers me most about the NY Times thing,
besides the fact that the writer thinks C.'s r work
emphasizes "feeling", rather than feeling knotted
together with intense thinking, and besides the fact
that she thinks that the later writing finally becomes
"ambitious" as if it weren't always so, is the
extended quote from "The Wicker Basket" which is a
wonderful poem but as part of an introduction to
Creeley could possibly lead many of the unitiated to
imagine Bob as a hip Dr. Seuss.

(Yes, you say, Dr. Seuss already was hip.  I always
loved that moment in an interview when Bob was asked
what he thought of Time magazine calling him a "hip
Emily Dickinson" and he said "I always thought she was
already rather hip" (an inexact quote from memory).
That was such a lovely characteristic move--flipping
around the meaning of the word "hip", which so often
means mainly "worldly".

No more ado, the Post thing:




Robert Creeley, 78; Postmodern Poet, Professor

By Joe Holley
Washington Post Staff Writer
Friday, April 1, 2005; Page B06

Robert Creeley, 78, a prolific poet and a major
American artist in the second half of the 20th
century, died March 30 at a hospital in Odessa, Tex.
He had pneumonia and complications from lung disease.

Mr. Creeley was in a two-month literary residency at
the Lannan Foundation in Marfa, Tex., in the remote
Big Bend area of the state, when he became ill.

Marfa, a tiny town in the arid reaches of the American
Southwest, was an appropriate setting for the
postmodern poet, although he had been there only a few
days before he had to be hospitalized. Like the
minimalist sculptor Donald Judd, who lived and worked
in Marfa and who attracted like-minded artists to the
sparse and open space, Mr. Creeley the poet sought to
pare down and distill, while maintaining the power,
potency and richness of the words and images that
remained.

"He was a nomad," said the poet C.D. Wright, a
colleague at Brown University, where Mr. Creeley was a
distinguished professor of English. "He was an old
Yankee who loved New England, but he thought of Marfa
as a clean, well-lighted place."

Like the jazz riffs of Charlie Parker, Miles Davis or
Keith Jarrett, his poems were impressionistic and
improvisational. Wright described him as an
"essentialist as far as language is concerned."

"I believe in a poetry determined by the language of
which it is made," Mr. Creeley wrote in 1960. "I look
to words, and nothing else, for my own redemption. . .
. I mean the words as opposed to content."

The poem "Water Music" illustrates his elliptical
approach:

The words are a beautiful music.

The words bounce like in water.

Water music

loud in the clearing

off the boats,

birds, leaves.

They look for a place

to sit and eat --

no meaning

no point.


He had been at Brown for the past two years. He also
had taught at the University of New Mexico, the
University of British Columbia, San Francisco State
University and, for 25 years, the State University of
New York at Buffalo. He lived in Providence, R.I.

Robert White Creeley was born May 21, 1926, in
Arlington, Mass., and grew up in nearby West Acton. He
became interested in writing while a student at the
Holderness School, in Plymouth, N.H.

He was admitted to Harvard University in 1943 but
interrupted his education during World War II to serve
as an ambulance driver in India for the American Field
Service. In 1947, he dropped out of Harvard shortly
before he was scheduled to graduate. He lived for a
while on a farm in New Hampshire, as well as in Spain
and France.

In the 1950s, he was one of the "Black Mountain
poets." These were writers, including Denise Levertov,
Ed Dorn and Charles Olson, who had some connection to
Black Mountain College, an experimental, communal
college in North Carolina, in the mountains near
Asheville.

Olson was particularly influential. He and Mr. Creeley
developed the concept of "projective verse," poetry
that abandoned traditional forms in favor of something
more organic, something that took shape as the process
of composition was underway. "I see as I write," Mr.
Creeley noted.

His work also tended to focus on the everyday
experiences, emotions and relationships rather than on
history and public events. "Reading his poems, we
experience the gnash of arriving through feeling at
thought and word," the poet and translator Forrest
Gander wrote in a review of Mr. Creeley's last book,
"Life & Death" (1998).

Mr. Creeley's first marriage, to Ann McKinnon Creeley,
ended in divorce in 1955. His only novel, "The Island"
(1963), drew on that relationship; the book is set on
the island of Mallorca, off the coast of Spain, where
he lived with his family in 1953-54.

After the divorce, he returned briefly to Black
Mountain before moving to San Francisco, where he
associated with Allen Ginsburg, Lawrence Ferlinghetti,
Jack Kerouac and other members of the Beat Generation
of writers. His work appeared in the influential
anthology "The New American Poetry: 1945-1960" (1960),
edited by Donald Allen.

In 1956, Mr. Creeley accepted a teaching position at a
boys' school in Albuquerque, where he met his second
wife, Bobbie Louise Hawkins Creeley, and continued to
publish poetry and fiction throughout the 1950s and
1960s. In 1962, Scribners published his first major
collection, "For Love: Poems 1950-1960."

Mr. Creeley's second marriage ended in divorce in
1976. His poetry from that time reflects a brooding
sense of loss.

In his next major collection, "Later" (1979), Mr.
Creeley's work reflected a preoccupation with aging.
In "Myself," the first poem in the collection, he
wrote:

I want, if older,

still to know

why, human, men

and women are torn, so lost

why hopes cannot

find a better world

than this.

Mr. Creeley published more than 60 books of poetry,
numerous essays and articles and more than a dozen
books of prose. His numerous honors include two
Fulbright fellowships, a Guggenheim fellowship, Yale
University's biennial Bollingen Prize in Poetry and a
National Book Award nomination.

Survivors include his wife of 28 years, Penelope
Highton of Providence; three children from the first
marriage, David Ebitz of State College, Pa., Thomas
Creeley of Hudson, Maine, and Charlotte Creeley of
Brockton, Mass.; two daughters from the second
marriage, Sarah Creeley of Hercules, Calif., and
Katherine Hoeck of Boulder, Colo.; two children from
the third marriage, William Creeley and Hannah
Creeley, both of New York; and a stepdaughter, Kirsten
Hoeck of California

still an april fool


track meet canceled
snow and wind chill
deny my still warm bones their crooked miles
and joy vicarious watching him run like the wind
breathing with him gasping around the oval
over and over and over
plastic water bottles flying
lifted and blown around
the emptying
stadium

yesterday
a southern breeze
blew soft wide waves across the pond
beneath a flirty sun
today
the northern air
makes tight little ripples
in the opposite direction
a little greenwood gazebo
sits patiently on the island
frosted with slush
awaiting its fulfillment
leaping children
novice visitors

narcissus greens sprout up
through the cold
spring water

i don't know anything
about that icey frenzied nosey head blow
only the fire down below
seeds in the earth

you know what really blows?
tomorrow, yesterday
will have seemed better

we do need a weatherman
to know which way the wind
will blow against the wind
cause clashing
cyclones
while all along we were expecting
halcyones

a failing
loving
solitary breath blows against an empire of everything
it's better than nothing
it's really quite something

Thank you for this. "I love irresolution because it has energy," is

Mime-version: 1.0

It's curious, these matters of death. In one week 'the global collective' -
if that's what commerce and CNN have given us - we have gone from
'counter-formality' to 'formality' - or simply to High Church. The Schiavo -
on some super, ever more gothic level - mimic 'd the Jerry Springer Show. We
had everything but Gov. Jeb Bush and his deputies indulge in a body tossing
contest with the local, court abiding hospice police protection.
Now to Rome we have strict ritual, prayers and homage - a gathering of the
extended Holy Family - to grieve, celebrate and honor the Pope's release.
Out of, I suspect, the enormous embarrassment, guilt and what have we over
the Schiavo debacle, the lens of the collective goes 24/7 to Rome.

Indeed one senses an enormous, global relief from the Springer/Schiavo
episode in which the recurring image of Schiavo's face on Fox Network News
was reminiscent of Madame Tussaud at her gothic best. (Remember, she worked
with the death masks of guillotined French Aristocrats that she managed to
purloin across the Channel to London).

Ironically, of course, one knows the Church under John Paul was not without
its gothic underbelly of large and sad sexual abuse scandals among his
Priests and flock - of which he ignored, and now the media and most of the
gathered are choosing to ignore in the celebration of his life and example.
The high formality of the Institution of the Church enables the possibility
to to forgo facts on the ground, while alternatively aesthetically - and not
without genuine feeling - appreciate so much.

Sadly as we move on, I suspect, we will have the former Exterminator, Tom
Delay, doing everything he can to upstage the Pope's Funeral in order to
bring attention back to Schiavo. To live under such cycles seems our fate
under a faith based Presidency. Not the Millennial gift that many of us
would want, including the other current Fundamentalist style militant
religious contributions.

I think I will stay busy remembering and mourning the death of Robert
Creeley. An aesthetic formality of which I most often felt accurate and at
home.

Yes, it its curious. I often think, instead of our times being pegged
--three-hundred years on-- as a minty-new milllenium, we will be
referenced as medieval, since more and more (and for mostly the
reasons you detail, the death-mask emigrae...and, too, all the
hooded, the tortured) we are those times. But just when I come
to believe, as I feel you do, that our cycle-present is a dark one,
I do think back on the liberation --we living "deeper" in this cycle--
gleaned from Creeley, his work and his character.

This week, too, we lost Miltos Sachtouris, who, twenty
odd years ago, I first found luminuos, especially in his hallucinations
("whatever you did not see in the morning/the joyful gardener/the real
automobile/the kisses with the real couple/you see that the movies/do
not love death). Like Chagall, flowing, raptured.

I think of these, who they were (are!), the way they were, as the
best crib of our times. And I find it almost necessesary to defy these
times until somehow, one day, we pass through all this black burning,
and climb out of this hole.

Thanks for your good thoughts here, Gerald.
I do think we are in some hyper-collective moment.
Your comments, the 'black burning', brought me back to a piece I wrote in m=
y
Crossing the Millennium(1999) work in response to T. Clark on Jackson
Pollack:

Saturday, April 9, 1999

=B3Mark and emotion, matched one to one. A unique emotional handwriting.
Technical skill as pathos. Aversion as a way to point to the horror.
Materiality at the extreme.=B2

introduce a two day symposium on =B3Modernism and Why It Won=B9t Go Away.=B2 UC
Berkeley, today.=20

Take a stick. Take a can. A can with white paint. Opaque white paint. Put
the stick in the paint. Figure the initial gesture: a circle, a ladder, a
lightning stroke. Make a white circle on a black rock. Erase the first mark=
.
No. Do not erase. Paint another circle around the first circle. One. Two.
Three. Four times eight. Open five cans: pink, brown, silver, blue,
lavender. Put a stick in each. On each fourth, shift the color. Migrate
quickly. Stop. Go. Witness. Slash. Go. Slash. Witness.

Make one ladder. Two ladders. Make the circles circle the ladder. Make a
second ladder. Make the circles circle both ladders. One, two, three, four.
Shift each ring into a different color. Throw down a lightening stroke. Mak=
e
it zig, zag through each circle, across each ring. Erase each slash.
Witness. Erase. Witness. Surround the entire rock. Color. Slash. Circle.
Ladder. Lightening. Say it=B9s finished when it=B9s finished. Black, color, roc=
k
. No. Do not say it=B9s finished. One, two, pink, blue; three, four, lavender=
,
silver, brown. Stick. Stick. Slash, erase, witness, stick.

******
Imagine a page. Imagine a white page. Imagine dark. Imagine the dark stroke=
.
Imagine the dark stroke emergent. Imagine a ladder. Imagine a ladder broken=
.
Imagine foul. Imagine the territory destroyed. Imagine the territory
destroyed to save some other. Imagine the other destroyed. Imagine
destruction. Imagine the art of destruction. Imagine waste. Imagine the end=
.
Imagine sirens. Imagine the tongue burnt. Imagine ashes. Imagine war.
Imagine:

Be well(!).

at least i can think
in full sentences
even if i can't speak
more than fragments
i repeat
myself or look
on the bright side
all our stories
they too are fragments
their own luminous poetries

in the story of my sun-
struck absent flower
they will tell you
she was all boy
the fairest mirror mirror
return refrain
return hello
an even gaze
to the pond

but my eucalyptus spice
love who turned from me
long hair slips like language
between reaching hands

all i hear is me.
Echo was Echo
for the one she chased
and so it goes, and goes.

a failing
loving
solitary breath blows against an empire of everything
it's better than nothing
it's really quite something

Marvelous!!!

This piece is closer to my understanding of the Creeley essence than =
most of the preceding (my own work included)postings.  Thanks to Mary Jo =
Malo for apparently having triggered your creativity, but mostly, thank =
you for your efforts.

Well Done!

Yes, I'm also convinced of this hyper-collective: Winter of 2003 I went to
see a full-bodied retrospective of Johns at the Gund in Cleveland. Long
sensing his connect with poetry (at least certainly of the WORD, both
literally and collaborationally [set designs, O'Hara, etc.], but had never
really "read" him.) So I picked up one of his notebooks and read:

"Find ways to apply/make paint
with simple movements
of objects-- the hand
a board, feather, string,
sponge, rag, shaped tools, comb
(and move canvas aganst paint-smeared objects)
How
(What) can this be used to mean if it
were language? In what sense can one
intend to use them? (S-11. Book A, p. 32, c. 1963)

After I copied this into my notebook, I then added:

The way I write seems always, movement of arm and my hand entering
into a path under the sign of thirst. But my throat is parched, scratchy,
body and thought-- all the attention I can put forth. Only much later I
realize that my hand curled across the page sets out a boundary between
what I put down on the page and myself. One side: words, the work.
Other side: the writer. In vain -- through all that's black, burned, -- do
they try to meet, searching  to communicate. And all the while no matter
what -- the page STAYS put, (in its way) taking stock of these two
singular gestures, seeing to always gesture, seeming always to remain
singular. But when someting ends on either end, (on either side)-- it is
the void. Still, I think of everything as set in motion...

Gerald S.

Thanks for your good thoughts here, Gerald.
I do think we are in some hyper-collective moment.
Your comments, the 'black burning', brought me back to a piece I wrote in my
Crossing the Millennium(1999) work in response to T. Clark on Jackson
Pollack:

Saturday, April 9, 1999

³Mark and emotion, matched one to one. A unique emotional handwriting.
Technical skill as pathos. Aversion as a way to point to the horror.
Materiality at the extreme.²

A sketchbook composite from remarks by T. J. Clark about Jackson Pollack to
introduce a two day symposium on ³Modernism and Why It Won¹t Go Away.² UC
Berkeley, today.

Take a stick. Take a can. A can with white paint. Opaque white paint. Put
the stick in the paint. Figure the initial gesture: a circle, a ladder, a
lightning stroke. Make a white circle on a black rock. Erase the first mark.
No. Do not erase. Paint another circle around the first circle. One. Two.
Three. Four times eight. Open five cans: pink, brown, silver, blue,
lavender. Put a stick in each. On each fourth, shift the color. Migrate
quickly. Stop. Go. Witness. Slash. Go. Slash. Witness.

Make one ladder. Two ladders. Make the circles circle the ladder. Make a
second ladder. Make the circles circle both ladders. One, two, three, four.
Shift each ring into a different color. Throw down a lightening stroke. Make
it zig, zag through each circle, across each ring. Erase each slash.
Witness. Erase. Witness. Surround the entire rock. Color. Slash. Circle.
Ladder. Lightening. Say it¹s finished when it¹s finished. Black, color, rock
. No. Do not say it¹s finished. One, two, pink, blue; three, four, lavender,
silver, brown. Stick. Stick. Slash, erase, witness, stick.

******
Imagine a page. Imagine a white page. Imagine dark. Imagine the dark stroke.
Imagine the dark stroke emergent. Imagine a ladder. Imagine a ladder broken.
Imagine foul. Imagine the territory destroyed. Imagine the territory
destroyed to save some other. Imagine the other destroyed. Imagine
destruction. Imagine the art of destruction. Imagine waste. Imagine the end.
Imagine sirens. Imagine the tongue burnt. Imagine ashes. Imagine war.
Imagine:

Be well(!).

I have decided for National Poetry month to start anouncing our recent
titles monthlong, price & info below.


Sheila E. Murphy
Incessant Seeds
ISBN 1-886350-67-1
6 by 9, perfect bound, 88 pages, $12
order direct


Written in a luxurious squared Spanish sonnet form as requested, this
book of
poems by Sheila E. Murphy gives insight into her versatility within a
boundary while not obscuring her intent and content for form's sake. A
wonderful book, I do hope you have a chance to appreciate a copy.   --
David Baratier


>From the Author’s Introduction:
Incessant Seeds can be viewed as both the yield and record of a process
that involves working in units comprised of 14-syllable lines and 14
lines. Such a rule-based flow has the capacity of allowing a wide range
of subject areas, perspectives, concerns, and swatches of language
equivalent to musical phrases. I followed a similar approach when
writing an earlier volume Teth, published by Chax Press, slightly more
than a decade before composing Incessant Seeds in 2001. I found that
rule-based composition leads the mind to find and gather like-sounding,
like-shaped arrangements of words or syllables. It became clear that the

more I used the determined method, the more in sync I became with the
vibratory pattern inherent in the rule itself, an ironically liberating
practice.

During a series of online conversations, David Baratier mentioned the
prospect of my working in 14-syllable lines. I used the 14-line unit,
thereby discovering Incessant Seeds. While this approach is not my
exclusive way of creating, I especially value its heuristic properties.

Sheila E. Murphy




-------Two examples from the collection-------------



Incessant seeds defray the cost of whittling various

Diameters transisting to the cause-effect domain

Named after promissory notary republique, norms

Listed in the books kept under wraps, lacking see-through

Properties, recall the scent of braeburn appliqué,

The perfume of the fresh hint of reclusive purgatoire,

Eliminating the obligatory visits to

Bridge club and band practice, meetings of the art league, scout meets,

Gymnastic sieges of untidy repetitions, floor

Routines, routine as indoor-outdoor carpet planted on

Innocent flooring everyone is apt to trot across,

En route to mediocrity, that stains otherwise fresh

Or even revealing lives, that tap discovery mined

For precious occupations twilled within opaque desire





------------



Gem noise altercates with understanding minus troops and

Shuttlecocks arranged to disable what at one time worked

According to our liking but no longer functions out of

Tone-deaf manicures, that last as long as prodding torches,

Fast asleep recliner chair deciduous and lanky

Trees on top of trees, birds respiting the way we used to

In our leisure, listen to them on the line, worthy of

Binoculars, vivid and strange and parsed from scratch perhaps

Accustomed as we were to beauty on its own career,

Reconnaissance or martyrdom perhaps this much a plea

For going to work, the reason for existence, rounded

To a surface pieced together from the fragments known,

Interrogation yields little more than the projection

Of a flower, effectively what is left of shadow



------------

Be well

The Other Shoe
by Knute Skinner
Pavement Saw Press Chapbook Award Series
ISBN 1—886350—99—X        Price: $6.00
32 pages, 5.5 by 8.5, 2005

Knute Skinner was born in St. Louis, Missouri, and grew up in nearby
Webster Groves. He attended college at Culver-Stockton and at the
University of Northern Colorado, where he received a BA in speech and
drama. He then did graduate work at Middlebury College and at the
University of Iowa, where he was also an instructor in the English
Department.

After receiving a PhD in English, Skinner turned his back on job offers,

left Iowa, and headed off to spend the rest of his life on the Canary
Islands. Instead, after two years traveling around Europe, he purchased
a cottage in rural Ireland. There, when not writing poems, he worked in
a turf bog and grew vegetables for the local market. He also began
teaching a part of each year in the US, at Western Washington
University. In 2000 he retired from teaching and now, along with his
spouse, Edna Faye Kiel, is resident year round in Killaspuglonane,
County Clare.

Skinner has published fifteen previous collections, the most recent of
which is Stretches, from Salmon Publishing.

Some of these poems have been published in the following: Ambit,
Cyphers, Denver Quarterly, Descant, Event, Famous Reporter, Going Down
Swinging, Harpur Palate, Imago, Indigenous Fiction, Mushroom Dreams,
Poetry Ireland Review, Poetry NZ, The Prairie Journal, Quadrant
Magazine, The Shop: A Magazine of Poetry, Smiths Knoll, Staple, The
Sewanee Review, Viewpoints, Wildeside Literary Magazine and Windsor
Review as well as reprinted in the Anthology of Magazine Verse &
Yearbook of American Poetry (Monitor Book Company, 1997).



A Suitable Guest


“What’s wrong with them?” I asked.

“Wrong? Nothing’s wrong with them,” he answered,
lifting his cup.

“But you’ve given them all to me,” I said,
setting down my fork.
“Why aren’t you having any?”

He emptied his cup, hot as it was,
and he rose from the table.
The morning sun blazed on the deck,
visible through the French doors across the room,
and although the kitchen was cool enough,
I fanned my throat with my collar.

“Oh, I don’t know,” he said, walking to the door
and letting out his cat,
“I usually just drink coffee in the morning.”
He returned to the table and sat down.
“Don’t you like them?” he asked.

“Oh, yes, they’re delicious,” I said,
“but I’ve never had them before for breakfast.”
I took another small bite.
“Wherever did you find them?” I asked.

At that he lifted his chin and smiled,
and I noticed his crows-feet.
“Oh, I’ll never tell,” he said, laughing,
“just as I won’t tell my mother
where I found you.”

He laughed again and a surge of sweet fluid
coursed through my veins,
and I thought of his laughter the night before
as he handled my body. I took another small bite.

“Eat them up, eat them up, they’re good for you,” he said,
and he jumped to his feet and crossed the room.
“I don’t really care about them myself,” he said,
letting his cat back in,
“but I keep them for suitable guests.”

“Our tastes are quite different then,” I said.
“It’s a mystery why anyone last night
would take us for twins.”

stone poem 1
( milford graves trio @ the stone 4/1/05 )


wild filings
napkin creases
stone chips fall where they..... sound petals
acrisscrossin the grey
concretizing speechless
we converse patterns jumping off points
sutures removing themselves
no tomming sneaker-statuettes

your ancestors firmly rooted in yr drum
standing symbol of dark wood
& joyous unisex -
peacocked pink & blues
trapped & swirling within the frieze
a den of florality
bossom/blossoms weaving crosshatched
wandering wildom

mention the walls bareness
white sheets & simple brick besmeared
belmered breasts of yellow light
dropped
afixed to bare beams

this is where word does not come cheap
tales & talk busier than tongues' appetite
bodies' foot @ the edge of space
where control relinquishes  itself
to itself
gives up to dahbah doobee dah bah
is rever enhancer
where freedom contradicts its oppressors
where water contradicts itself
where boldly speaks a carpet of stones
smoothed yet broken stones

pcs of a bigger pc
a bigger pc still from a bigger pc
yet still bigger yet.

MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

The readings and tributes should have happened when Cid was alive.  But
then again, who cares what widows think?  Not, apparently, the world of
po-biz. Cid's ashes are still sitting on a table in the room where he
held forth over convenience store sushi and sandwiches.  Every day
Shizumi copies and recopies the Heart Sutra to help Cid get into Pure
Land Heaven, but she always leaves the final character unfinished
because it's not lucky to complete the project. It tempts fate. As does
her chain smoking, since Cid left her, but she welcomes illness,
sleeplessness, not eating, since it brings her closer to Cid.

Sylvia, on the other hand, is doing very well, thank you.  She's a
prettier version of Cid with Boston grit in her accent.  Her daughter's
a lawyer (she was Cid's favorite niece) and life goes on.  "I was
privileged to be the sister of three certifiable geniuses," she says,
and she means it.  "Three brothers who, in their own way, set the
measure for brains and talent and kindness."  She herself was married
to the doctor who discovered the vaccine for German measles.  One day,
in an art gallery, Cid was sitting down viewing some pictures, when he
looked up, and said, in all seriousness, to Sylvia's husband, "My work
is more important than yours."  Can you imagine that? says Sylvia,
laughing.  "Poets are all monomaniacs."

If anyone plans more tributes to Cid, please let these two wonderful
people know.  Both are easily contactable.  I'd be happy to forward
contact information if all else fails.  Jesse

Interview with Philip Lamantia

http://www.milkmag.org/LAMANTIA.html

A literary prodigy whose poems delved into the worlds of the
subconscious and dreams, his love of Surrealism had a major influence
on the Beats and other American poets. On March 7, 2005 he died of
heart failure in his North Beach, San Francisco apartment at age
seventy-seven. After World War II, Lamantia traveled the world, living
for periods of time in Mexico, Morocco and Europe. During the 1950s he
lived, off and on, with native peoples in the United States and Mexico,
while participating in the peyote-eating rituals of the Washo Indians
in Nevada. During these early years, he delved into such subjects as
astronomy, philosophy, history, jazz, painting, ornithology and
Egyptology, becoming not only conversational, but eminently
knowledgeable in these subjects and others. During these years he
became part of the literary bohemian scene in San Francisco and was
often associated with the Beats. He went on to publish books of poetry
during the 1960s such as Destroyed Works and Touch of the Marvelous.

This Welcome Message updated 27 March 2005.

--------------------------------------------

Above the world-weary horizons
New obstacles for exchange arise
Or unfold, O ye postmasters!

1. About the Poetics List

With the preceding epigraph, the Poetics Listserv was founded by
Charles Bernstein in late 1993. Now in its fourth incarnation, the
list has about 1200 subscribers worldwide. We also have a substantial
number of nonsubscribing readers, who access the list through our web
site (see archive URL above).

The Poetics List is not a forum for a general discussion of poetry or
for the exchange of unsolicited poems. Our aim is to support, inform,
and extend those directions in poetry that are committed to
innovations, renovations, and investigations of form and/or/as
content, to the questioning of received forms and styles, and to the
creation of the otherwise unimagined, untried, unexpected, improbable,
and impossible. While we recognize that other lists may sponsor other
possibilities for exchange, we request that those participating in
this forum keep in mind the specialized and focused nature of this
project and respect our decision to operate a moderated list. The
Poetics List exists to support and encourage divergent points of view
on innovative forms of modern and contemporary poetry and poetics, and
we are committed to do what is necessary to preserve this space for
such dialog.

Due to the high number of subscribers, we no longer maintain the open
format with which the list began (at under 100 subscribers). The
specific form of moderation that we employ is a relatively fluid one:
in most cases, messages are reviewed after having been posted to the
list, and difficulties resolved on that basis; however, the listserv
editorial board may shift between this and a pre-review mode which
calls for all messages to be read and approved before being forwarded
to the list. We prefer to avoid this option as it hampers the
spontaneity of discussion that we hope to promote. In addition to
these options, the editorial board will unsubscribe individuals if
they are not, in our opinion, productively contributing to the list or
following our guidelines. We remain committed to this editorial
function as a defining element of the Poetics List.

Please also note that this is a private list and information about
this list should not be posted to other lists or directories of lists.
The idea is to keep the list membership to those with specific rather
than general interests, and also to keep the scale of the list
relatively small and the volume manageable. The current limits of the
list are 50 messages per day, and two messages per subscriber per day.

In addition to being archived at through the EPC
(http://epc.buffalo.edu) and at
http://listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu/archives/poetics.html, some posts to
Poetics (especially reviews, obituary notices, announcements, etc.)
may also become part of specific EPC subject areas. Brief reviews of
poetry events and publications are always welcome; we also encourage
posts that announce events important to our subscribers. See section 5
for details.

----------------------------

2. Posting to the List

The Poetics List is a moderated list. All messages are reviewed by the
editors in keeping with the goals of the list as articulated in this
Welcome Message (see section 1).

Please note that while this list is primarily concerned with
discussions of poetry and poetics, messages relating to politics and
political activism, film, art, media, and so forth are also welcome.
We strongly encourage subscribers to post information, including web
links, relating to publications (print and internet), reading series,
and blogs that they have coordinated, edited, published, or in which
they appear. Such announcements constitute a core function of this
list. Brief reviews of poetry events and publications (print or
digital) are always welcome.

We do not accept unsolicited postings of creative work not directed
toward a discussion of poetics issues on the list. The Poetics List is
not a venue for the posting of free-standing, personal poems or
journal entries. Note, however, that the editors will, from time to
time, solicit creative contributions, including ongoing list-based
projects and edited collections of poems. Please note that such
contributions appear by special invitation only.

To post to the Poetics List, send your messages directly to the list
address: poetics@listserv.buffalo.edu.

For further information on posting to the list, see section 6 below.

-----------------------------------------

3. Subscriptions

*For all subscription requests go to
http://listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu/archives/poetics.html.

*To subscribe for the first time click on "Subscribe (join) a List."
Immediately following your subscription to the poetics listserv we ask
that you email poetics@buffalo.edu, subject-line "registration," with
your full name, street address, email address, and telephone number.
Failure to register at the time of subscription will result in
automatic deletion from the subscription roll.

*To manage your subscription (for descriptions of the different
subscription options please see section 3), click on "Subscriber's
Corner."

Subscriptions to the Poetics List are free of charge, but formal
registration is required. All other questions about subscriptions,
whether about an individual subscription or subscription policy,
should be addressed to this same administrative address.

PLEASE NOTE: All subscription-related information and correspondence
remains absolutely confidential.

All posts to the list must provide your full real name, as registered.
If there is any discrepancy between your full name as it appears in
the "from" line of the message header, please sign your post at the
bottom. Subscribers who do not include their full name with each post
will be unsubcribed form the list.

The most frequent problem with subscriptions is bounced messages. If
your system is often down or if you have a low disk quota, Poetics
messages may get bounced, which will result in your subscription being
automatically terminated by the Listserv program and the automatically
generated message telling you that this has occurred will also likely
bounce. If this happens, you may re-subscribe to the list by the same
process described above. One remedy to avoid this happening in the
future: set your list options to "no-mail" and read the list on the
web.

-------------------------------

4. Subscription Options

We encourage you to alter your subscription options via the link on
the right side of the screen at
http://listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu/archives/poetics.html. If you would
prefer not to use the web-interface, you may also email
<listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu> the following commands:

*to subscribe to the Poetics listserv send
listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu this one-line message with no "subject":
sub poetics [your Firstname and Lastname]

*RECOMMENDED: if you wish to read the list on our web interface and
not receive any messages sent directly, while remaining subscribed to
the list and so eligible to send us posts, send this one-line message
to <listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu> with no "subject": set poetics
nomail. Note: this option is also useful for temporary suspension of
email service.

*to reactivate Poetics e-mail send <listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu>
this one-line message with no "subject": set poetics mail

* to receive the list in digest form (you will receive the day's
individual posts in one email sent just after midnight EST), send
<listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu> this one-line message with no
"subject": set poetics digest

*to receive posts in the default option (you will receive individual
postings immediately), send <listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu> this one-
line message with no "subject": set poetics nodigest

* to receive the list in index form (you will receive a list, without
the text of the posts, of the subjects discussed each day along with
the author's name and address and the number of lines it comprises;
you can also choose to have the index sent to you in either plain text
or in HTML format with hyperlinks), send
<listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu> this one-line message with no
"subject": set poetics nohtml index --or-- set poetics html index

PLEASE NOTE: do not leave your Poetics subscription in default or
digest mode if you are going to be away for any extended period of
time. Your account may become flooded and you may lose Poetics
messages as well as other important mail. In such cases, switch your
subscription to "nomail" as recommended above.

-------------------------

5. To Unsubscribe

To unsubscribe (or change any of your subscription options), again, we
strongly encourage you to go to the right-hand side of the screen at
http://listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu/archives/poetics.html You may also
may unsubscribe by sending a one-line email to
<listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu> with no "subject": unsub poetics

If you are having difficulty unsubscribing, please note: sometimes
your e-mail address may be changed slightly by your system
administrator. If this happens you will not be able to send messages
to Poetics or to unsubscribe, although you will continue to receive
mail from the Poetics List. To avoid this problem, unsub using your
old address, then resubscribe with your new email address.

----------------

6. Cautions

"Flame" messages will not be tolerated on the Poetics List. We define
'flaming' as any post that resembles a personal attack or personal
insult to anyone--subscriber or not. This of course includes racial
slurs as well as ad hominem arguments in which the person rather than
their work is attacked; in other words while critique of a person's
work is welcome (critical inquiry is one of the main functions of the
list), this critique cannot extend to a critique or criticism of the
person.

The listserv is intended to be a productive communal space for
discussion and announcements; as such, subscribers who do not follow
listserv policy on flaming will be removed from the subscription roll.

For reasons of basic security, we do not allow pseudonymous
subscriptions. All messages intended for the Poetics List should be
sent in Text-Only format, without attachments. We do not accept
HTML-formatted messages or attached files. As a general rule, keep
individual posts to 1,000 words or less.

Please do not publish list postings without the express permission of
the author. Posting on the list is a form of publication. Copyright
for all material posted on Poetics remains with the author; material
from this list and its archive may not be reproduced without the
author's permission, beyond the standard rights accorded by "fair use"
of published materials.

As an outside maximum, we will accept no more than 2 messages per day
from any one subscriber. Also, given that our goal is a manageable
list (manageable both for moderators and subscribers), the list
accepts 50 or fewer messages per day.

Like all systems, the listserv will sometimes be down: if you feel
your message has been delayed or lost, *please wait at least one day
to see if it shows up*, then check the archive to be sure the message
is not posted there; if you still feel there is a problem, you may
wish to contact the editors at <poetics@acsu.buffalo.edu>.

After Lorca

                        for M. Marti

The church is a business, and the rich
are the business men.
                                 When they pull on the bells, the
poor come piling in and when a poor man dies, he has a wooden
cross and they rush through the ceremony.

But when a rich man dies, they
drag out the Sacrament
and a golden Cross, and go doucement, doucement
to the cemetery.

And the poor love it
and think it's crazy.

I think most of us understand that in the history of
the list that quite aruguably there was once more
vitality than there is now, but I think that all
attempts at repair things shd involve initiatives to
add features (like the new commissioned poems Lori
speaks of) but not initiatives to forbid human poetic
expression.  Frankly, no (freestanding) poems on the
poetics list is one of the weirdest concepts since
"what's wrong with you? fighting in the War Room?"
(Dr, Strangelove).  Mary Jo Malo's Creeley emulation
in October, prompting another wonderful Creeley poem
by Christohpe, and her recent track poem are great
examples of what can appear if people are free.  I
thought this new edict was a bad dream permanently
s/wept away in the rigors of the death in our family.
I will have to consider unsubscribing. Drn!

Aristotle =20


"... There is another art which imitates by means of language alone,
and that either in prose or verse- which verse, again, may either
combine different meters or consist of but one kind- but this has
hitherto been without a name. For there is no common term we could
apply to the mimes of Sophron and Xenarchus and the Socratic dialogues
on the one hand; and, on the other, to poetic imitations in iambic,
elegiac, or any similar meter. People do, indeed, add the word 'maker'
or 'poet' to the name of the meter, and speak of elegiac poets, or
epic (that is, hexameter) poets, as if it were not the imitation
that makes the poet, but the verse that entitles them all to the name.
Even when a treatise on medicine or natural science is brought out
in verse, the name of poet is by custom given to the author; and yet
Homer and Empedocles have nothing in common but the meter, so that
it would be right to call the one poet, the other physicist rather
than poet. On the same principle, even if a writer in his poetic
imitation were to combine all meters, as Chaeremon did in his Centaur,
which is a medley composed of meters of all kinds, we should bring him
too under the general term poet..."

Any one care to bring this text into the 21st century?  Media techniques =
expand the dimensions of what even Aristotle might have listed under the =
definition of "poet" versus "physicist."  Or, are we forever stuck with =
the limits once established?

The Other Shoe
by Knute Skinner
Pavement Saw Press Chapbook Award Series
ISBN 1—886350—99—X        Price: $6.00
32 pages, 5.5 by 8.5, 2005

Knute Skinner was born in St. Louis, Missouri, and grew up in nearby
Webster Groves. He attended college at Culver-Stockton and at the
University of Northern Colorado, where he received a BA in speech and
drama. He then did graduate work at Middlebury College and at the
University of Iowa, where he was also an instructor in the English
Department.

After receiving a PhD in English, Skinner turned his back on job offers,

left Iowa, and headed off to spend the rest of his life on the Canary
Islands. Instead, after two years traveling around Europe, he purchased
a cottage in rural Ireland. There, when not writing poems, he worked in
a turf bog and grew vegetables for the local market. He also began
teaching a part of each year in the US, at Western Washington
University. In 2000 he retired from teaching and now, along with his
spouse, Edna Faye Kiel, is resident year round in Killaspuglonane,
County Clare.

Skinner has published fifteen previous collections, the most recent of
which is Stretches, from Salmon Publishing.

Some of these poems have been published in the following: Ambit,
Cyphers, Denver Quarterly, Descant, Event, Famous Reporter, Going Down
Swinging, Harpur Palate, Imago, Indigenous Fiction, Mushroom Dreams,
Poetry Ireland Review, Poetry NZ, The Prairie Journal, Quadrant
Magazine, The Shop: A Magazine of Poetry, Smiths Knoll, Staple, The
Sewanee Review, Viewpoints, Wildeside Literary Magazine and Windsor
Review as well as reprinted in the Anthology of Magazine Verse &
Yearbook of American Poetry (Monitor Book Company, 1997).



A Suitable Guest


“What’s wrong with them?” I asked.

“Wrong? Nothing’s wrong with them,” he answered,
lifting his cup.

“But you’ve given them all to me,” I said,
setting down my fork.
“Why aren’t you having any?”

He emptied his cup, hot as it was,
and he rose from the table.
The morning sun blazed on the deck,
visible through the French doors across the room,
and although the kitchen was cool enough,
I fanned my throat with my collar.

“Oh, I don’t know,” he said, walking to the door
and letting out his cat,
“I usually just drink coffee in the morning.”
He returned to the table and sat down.
“Don’t you like them?” he asked.

“Oh, yes, they’re delicious,” I said,
“but I’ve never had them before for breakfast.”
I took another small bite.
“Wherever did you find them?” I asked.

At that he lifted his chin and smiled,
and I noticed his crows-feet.
“Oh, I’ll never tell,” he said, laughing,
“just as I won’t tell my mother
where I found you.”

He laughed again and a surge of sweet fluid
coursed through my veins,
and I thought of his laughter the night before
as he handled my body. I took another small bite.

“Eat them up, eat them up, they’re good for you,” he said,
and he jumped to his feet and crossed the room.
“I don’t really care about them myself,” he said,
letting his cat back in,
“but I keep them for suitable guests.”

“Our tastes are quite different then,” I said.
“It’s a mystery why anyone last night
would take us for twins.”


Be well

By the way, and I meant to let Mary Jo know this backchannel, I
forwarded her Creeley poem to Robert Creeley the day she posted it.
Perhaps others did too!
Poems have their own life.

I think most of us understand that in the history of
the list that quite aruguably there was once more
vitality than there is now, but I think that all
attempts at repair things shd involve initiatives to
add features (like the new commissioned poems Lori
speaks of) but not initiatives to forbid human poetic
expression.  Frankly, no (freestanding) poems on the
poetics list is one of the weirdest concepts since
"what's wrong with you? fighting in the War Room?"
(Dr, Strangelove).  Mary Jo Malo's Creeley emulation
in October, prompting another wonderful Creeley poem
by Christohpe, and her recent track poem are great
examples of what can appear if people are free.  I
thought this new edict was a bad dream permanently
s/wept away in the rigors of the death in our family.
I will have to consider unsubscribing. Drn!

Good question, Alex, and I just have th/ thought(s):

I wonder about the deflation of poetics, that the rush
towards its celebration and democracitization has
meant something crucial, like purpose, has been lost
among the glam. The little fib is that we're working
together, that we're somehow the heirs of poetry's
future, that our poetry is open and not part of an
elite organization bent on preserving itself with
workshops, slams, McMFAs, and, apologizing for the
cynicism, vanity's hullabaloo. One wonders why Camille
Paglia's new book's gonna reintroduce poetic culture
to a broader audience (perhaps, and again one wonders,
because many of us have failed). The fact is, as I see
it, sitting at my desk in Beijing (my last
correspondence from RC coming on Sunday, days of the
ugliest and most violent drinking not behind me) and
soon to return Stateside to who knows what, that
something big's been lost -- especially with towering
Creeley (a man who often called himself an ¡®ol'
country western singer' and ne'er turned any young
poet away)'s death. We should be exchanging his
letters, doing more selflessness, focusing on the
process of poetry as an extension and still relevant
expression of our interconnectedness to humanity.
Poetry, I think, reminds us that we¡¯re not that
table. Regardless of how poetry's presented, and I
would argue that one should rage through like Patton
towards new cities, its about the genuine quality of
the work, always, and the acuity of words with which
we celebrate its truth in the end.

I was enjoying that till it got to the Patton bit and then it all began to
look rather odd

That is the Patton who killed people, you mean?

I am not happy with that association, but you were on to something - and
then you lost something crucial

Well, as I may or may not have said at some point here, it
was hearing Robert Creeley read in El Paso, Texas, back
in the mid- to late-sixties that introduced me to poetry as
a life worth living in. I met him once or twice after that, and
heard him read again only once, just several years ago in
Baltimore.

My favorite Creeley story is this one, and I'm not sure
whether I heard it from him or another.

This story's about the young Creeley, new to the writing of
poetry himself, on a pilgrimage to Rutherford to see if he
could find and meet William Carlos Williams. The tale, as
I heard it, is that Creeley was so nervous, so reticent about
meeting the good doctor that he walked past his house
several times, looking anxiously at the door and windows
of the house, walking around the block, coming back, and
pacing some more. But then Williams, who'd been watching
from inside went to the door and hollered out to Creeley,
"Hey, there, young man! Come on in here. You must be
looking for me."

Especially in terms of Alexander Saliby's "poetics" post yesterday, form  and
imitation is a most appropriate topic for discussion. I didn't consider my
poem for Robert Creeley an especially good imitation but rather wanted to pay
tribute to his contribution to modern poetry and his profound affect on me. I
had been struggling to find a voice for myself, apart from my former life,
lifestyle and writing style. He set me free. For me the primary and very
natural technique I now strive to emulate is the way he used silence and space.  It
reminds me of the spandrels of architecture or that wonderful silence just
before dawn.

Unlike Aristotle and his obsession with category and classification,  I'm an
existentialist. My approach to life and poetry is one of reaction and
reconstruction. Form might be likened to schools or styles of art, yet each  piece is
unique and reflects individual content. The media  (including this format)
makes originality of form more difficult, but the life  in the words can be
wonderfully individual. Would we say a meadowlark is an  imitation of a robin?

By the way, and I meant to let Mary Jo know this backchannel,  I
forwarded her Creeley poem to Robert Creeley the day she posted  it.
Perhaps others did too!

I  think most of us understand that in the history of
the list that quite  aruguably there was once more
vitality than there is now, but I think that  all
attempts at repair things shd involve initiatives to
add features  (like the new commissioned poems Lori
speaks of) but not initiatives to  forbid human poetic
expression.  Frankly, no (freestanding) poems on  the
poetics list is one of the weirdest concepts since
"what's wrong with  you? fighting in the War Room?"
(Dr, Strangelove).  Mary Jo Malo's  Creeley emulation
in October, prompting another wonderful Creeley poem
by  Christohpe, and her recent track poem are great
examples of what can appear  if people are free.  I
thought this new edict was a bad dream  permanently
s/wept away in the rigors of the death in our family.
I will  have to consider unsubscribing. Drn!

face that was preparing a face to
meet etc...we waited 5 min...

Poets in the NYC Area-

The middle school where I teach in Brooklyn will be
holding a special student/faculty poetry reading on
Friday, April 15th.  My class of seventh graders with
learning and emotional disabilities will be hosting
the reading, along with a regular crew who run our
monthly poetry slam (actual slam elements minimal).

We're looking for a guest reader or two.  Any
suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

Our student body is extremely mixed, drawing from Red
Hook and Gowanus to Park Slope and Brooklyn Heights.
It would be great to find a couple of poets who care
about getting poetry into our schools, who can read
poetry that will be accessible as well as inspiring
for young adolescents, and who love transferring their
fervor for poetry to youth.  It would also be helpful
if they don't mind sharing the spotlight with some
very creative (and in some cases happily unorthodox)
young students.

Thanks for the time.  Let's bring the discussion of
poetics beyond our listserv.

Backchannel with relevant subject would be helpful.
Again, thanks.

yours,
Jeremy Hawkins

I posted the note below a couple days ago on the PoetryEtc list but =20
forgot to put it here too. Meanwhile, on Thursday night in NYC a number =20=

of us read to honor French Poetry of the past century. I couldn't not =20=

honor Bob Creeley as well & so read a couple poems of his in French =20
(translated some 20 years ago for the opening night of Steve Lacy's =20
opera "Futurities" based on 20 Creeley poems). After the reading, Ron =20=

Padgett said: "Wow. I didn't know Creeley was also the best French poet =20=

of the century!"  Here is the second poem I read:

Si c'est pas marrant, ne le faites pas.

[March 30]: Well,I been reading around the man's work today & tonight =20=

feel like talking about good times shared. So here's one of my Creeley =20=

stories --

The company of Robert Creeley, in his poems or around a table, was (is, =20=

remains!) a place of major pleasure and learning. A word he liked: =20
"company" -- from "con pan" (with bread), to break bread with someone, =20=

to break it to share & eat in company. One late summer night in Paris =20=

in 1982 a jolly company of us went to a restaurant -- a mediterranean =20=

fish place -- after some literary event. We were lit up already, and =20
wine flowed as we prepared to order. Bob asked me what I was eating & I =20=

told him that the place was famous for an odd & dangerous dish you =20
couldn't find elsewhere: they served an Atlantic fish that had a poison =20=

bone still in, so you had to be very careful when eating it -- I had =20
never tried it, but I was going to tonight. Bob decided to come along =20=

for the ride, and ordered the same. It took time to, more bottles were =20=

emptied, hors d'oeuvres eaten, & when the fish finally came, Bob had =20
forgotten the warning & hungry as he was, laid into it as if it were =20
fishfingers -- & got the poison bone stuck in the gullet with the first =20=

fork full. At first we tried to prey it lose & get it down with bread, =20=

then he tried to bring it up with his finger, then bread again, then =20
the owner asked if she should call an ambulance -- Bob waved her off, =20=

we went back to bread and brandy, the bone had become the center of the =20=

party -- and finally, after a teary nail-biting owner asked us again if =20=

she shouldn't better call an ambulance, Bob gave her a resounding NO -- =20=

so resounding that the bone flew out! We paid up & repaired to a less =20=

dangerous caf=E9 for some Armangnac, & the night carried on as it does =
in =20
Paris and carried us along with it. Next day I felt slightly bad for =20
having given Bob such a scare (though I and the rest of the company =20
were probably more scared than Bob had been), & wrote the following =20
poem, an _apologia mea_ I sent him later, but never published, as far =20=

as I remember -- here it is tonight, on the day of Van Gogh's birth & =20=

Pardon my editorial scissors, but I read what you wrote as:=20

 1. "The little fib is that we're working

future, that our poetry is open and not part of an
elite organization bent on preserving itself..."=20

2. "...One wonders why Camille
Paglia's new book's gonna reintroduce poetic culture
to a broader audience (perhaps, and again one wonders,
because many of us have failed). The fact is, as I see
it...that something big's been lost..."

3."...Poetry, I think, reminds us that we=A1=AFre not that
table. Regardless of how poetry's presented,...its about=20
the genuine quality of the work, always, and the acuity
of words with which we celebrate its truth in the end."

What exactly is it that has us anointing some with the label, "Poet" and =
withholding that label from others?=20
Even more importantly, who are these "us" doing the anointing?

Perhaps life and admission into literary circles was easier for =
Aristotle's associates; write something imitating a metrical pattern and =
"Presto-Chango"  you're a "maker"  a "poet."  (Even for Aristotle, the =
"us" aren't clearly identified in his Poetics...appears he too had his =
"we" "us" circles.)=20

Certainly, Creeley aped no metrical stanzaic pattern...if there is =
imitation of pattern in his works, it is that he imitates the =
improvisational flexibility and freedom of a Charlie Parker on sax.  And =
yet, we all, poets and non-poets alike, call Creeley "Poet."  Some, I =
among them, also refer to Charlie Parker as poet. =20

  Good question, Alex, and I just have th/ thought(s):

  I wonder about the deflation of poetics, that the rush
  towards its celebration and democracitization has
  meant something crucial, like purpose, has been lost
  among the glam. The little fib is that we're working
  together, that we're somehow the heirs of poetry's
  future, that our poetry is open and not part of an
  elite organization bent on preserving itself with
  workshops, slams, McMFAs, and, apologizing for the
  cynicism, vanity's hullabaloo. One wonders why Camille
  Paglia's new book's gonna reintroduce poetic culture
  to a broader audience (perhaps, and again one wonders,
  because many of us have failed). The fact is, as I see
  it, sitting at my desk in Beijing (my last
  correspondence from RC coming on Sunday, days of the
  ugliest and most violent drinking not behind me) and
  soon to return Stateside to who knows what, that
  something big's been lost -- especially with towering
  Creeley (a man who often called himself an =A1=AEol'
  country western singer' and ne'er turned any young
  poet away)'s death. We should be exchanging his
  letters, doing more selflessness, focusing on the
  process of poetry as an extension and still relevant
  expression of our interconnectedness to humanity.
  Poetry, I think, reminds us that we=A1=AFre not that
  table. Regardless of how poetry's presented, and I
  would argue that one should rage through like Patton
  towards new cities, its about the genuine quality of
  the work, always, and the acuity of words with which
  we celebrate its truth in the end.

I agree. I don't often have time to read what's posted, but I believe poets
need all the publishing venues they can get, and I support poets posting to
the list. A lot of the work I do read here is very interesting, and on a
slow day I might go back to the List's archives to check it out. I'm sure
I'll find a few underground classics there that haven't found publication
elsewhere.

I've only posted one or two poems that I can remember, but I've liked
knowing that I could post work. It's an option in a field that doesn't have
a lot of them.

I think the policy should be reconsidered.

"...the exchange of
unsolicited poems"

may not mean
what it seems to mean

What's the difference
between exchange and solicitation

If I solicit from you
and you solicit from me

Which isn't so different
from what many 'proper' forums do

An exchange of solicited poems
does not seem (legally) precluded

Have to say I agree; the poems never dominate and are very often of great
interest. We all have our favorites etc. among them. I do understand the
need for expanding the poetics aspect of the list qua poetics, but I think
both can be accommodated.

ROBERT CREELEY, 1926-2005

Just Buffalo Literary Center mourns the loss of our dear friend, Bob
Creeley, and our hearts go out to Penelope, Will and Hannah.

Over the course of the past thirty years, Bob read for Just Buffalo dozens
of times, and proved a continual source of encouragement, wisdom and
support. Twice in the last 3 years, while Just Buffalo suffered one
financial blow after another, he came to the rescue by reading for a
fundraiser, in the process raising a combined $8,000.

On Valentine's Day, 2003, he stood in at the last minute for our planned
reader, Andrei Codrescu, who was ill at the time. The war on Iraq was just
beginning, and he gave one of the most devastating readings I ever saw him
(or anyone) give, reading from a series of annual Valentine poems written to
his wife Penelope over the past 25 years. He concluded the reading with
Matthew Arnold's, "Dover Beach," leaving, as they say, not a dry eye in the
house. (Go to Just Buffalo's website to see a photo of him reading at this
event.)

Upon leaving Buffalo in 2003, he continued his support by using the last of
his Capen Chair funds to bring poets Tomaz Salamun and Clayton Eshleman to
read. Last May, we brought him back for the last time to thank him alongside
Just Buffalo's founder, Debora Ott, for their long dedication to poetry in
Buffalo.

In his final note to me, dated March 7, he sent a photo of the Rio Grande,
and wrote about his condition, describing with characteristic good humor the
difficulties of traveling with an oxygen tank. He ended the note saying, "A
couple of days ago we drove down to the border (the Rio Grande) with Mexico,
some sixty miles distant -- would that the world were all so specific!"

Would that the world were so specific as you, Bob!

Farewell.

******

Just Buffalo, Hallwalls, Talking Leaves Books, The Gray Chair at UB, and
several others in the community are planning a major celebration of Robert
Creeley's life and work, to be held in the City of Buffalo in the Fall. We
will make an announcement sometime in the near future.

WORKSHOPS

THE WORKING WRITER SEMINAR, with Kathryn Radeff
Three Saturday mini-workshops: April 9, April 23, May 7 12 p.m. - 4 p.m.
Single Saturday Session: $50, $40 for members

Mini workshops are fun, fast-paced, informational and inspirational. In an
easy-to-understand manner, the sessions present the fundamentals of creative
writing as they apply to fact-based articles and personal experience, as
well as the craft of fiction. Lectures and writing exercises, which are used
to illustrate the concepts, are aimed at developing the writers'
understanding of structure, description, dialogue, character, style and
voice. Workshops also cover the art of writing query letters, research and
interviewing techniques, manuscript preparation and submission strategies.
Ideal for the beginner and skilled writer, mini-day workshops provide an
excellent overview of their fields. The goal is to have an article or short
story well underway by the time the session ends. An extensive analysis of
one completed piece is included. There will be one 30-minute break. The
workshop includes a question and answer session.

Now that blogs sub in for part of the loss of the general discussion of
poetry, and many of the posts here are about what different folks are
currently blogging, I am curious to know, in the experience of those who
do send poems to the list, how this is different / better than putting
them on a poem blog.

One of the reasons I am thinking this is I am writing a Canada Place
poem, and I don't know what to do with it.  I generally don't like
posting poems to lists, or to blogs, but I'm rather free with sending
them to eZines.

So is there some wonderful experience for the poet I'm missing?  Or that
we'll all be missing?

I do prefer the context established for poems on poetryetc -- you know,
people comment, or will post unfinished things, or talk about the
project a little more --

All best,
Catherine Daly

I would say that if 'unsolicited' creative work
continues to have a place on the discussion list there
is clearly room for some organizational changes to
list policy.  I'm personally trying my best to keep
from switching to digest format, but the current
flurry of posts keeps me on my toes.  And I love it.

If for some reason this particular discussion sways
the list policies one direction or another, can we
consider some conventions informally adopted by list
users that help with the flow / organization?

Dan Waber (yes?) always puts in his subject line
'[poem]' before the title.  Wow is that helpful.  Some
days I get home late, not having  had a chance to keep
up with the daily posts, and I can say to myself, 'I
just want to read the poems posted today,' or, 'I
can't handle any Sondheim this evening,' and in many
cases whittle down the bunch to what I have the energy
to digest at that time.

I doubt anyone on this list is interested in stifling
creativity, but so long as the subscribers are
interested in keeping more than one hat in a box, so
to speak, it seems clear that our present organization
is a bit unwieldy.

yours,
Jeremy

"The Best of Youth" - a six hour film in two parts has(some might say,
finally) arrived in San Francisco at the Balboa Theater. Made in 2003 (I
believe) - it's a generational "wrencher". A family with branches of all
shades, it starts in the Sixties and concludes in 2002. When I stood up at
the end of the second part and looked at the packed audience, it seemed most
of us were over fifty, and various shadows of each other's youth. Italian,
originally commissioned for TV, the work is both elegy and restoration - if
audience can be defined as harp, this one does not miss a string - deep
mental disturbance, political extremes, single fathers, identity conflicted
mothers, idealism gone diversely amok, brothers and sisters both in harmony
and odds, love won, lost, screwed up - an amazing resonant range. With the
exception of issues of ethnicity and race (which would be required of any
film of similar magnitude in the USA) "The Best of Youth" gets to the bases.

If narrative is dead, this is a very good death.  (Poetry even manages to
play a small part, too.)

The Abacus, Infinite and Otherwise @ the Plaintext_Tools Zwki


Introduction to the file:

"This text file constitutes a series of small essays on the notion of the
abacus. The abacus is unique since it is a digital instrument that exists
within the analogic real; there is always room for error.

"The abacus constitutes a raster within the real. It can be constructed to
any base; I consider an abacus to an infinite base. In this case, every
number is a unique symbol.

"One can reverse this, in a sense, considering the application of analogic
instruments to the digital domain. However since the latter is either a
matter of abstract definition (i.e. definition within an abstract
ontology) or a practical engineering application which is always already
analogic, it might be a fairly useless exercise.

"I fear that some of the below may be naive; in any case, read on, and
thank you for giving it some attention.

Well, and this certainly is not a parry, but Patton
was a soldier who liberated Italy and a good part of
Central Europe and, alas, while we might currently be
living in a time where conrete ideas may be easily
dismissed, if even unfairly so, because of one's
'preference' with regards to language, language is
what we have and the idea, seems to me, is a clear
one, i.e. frontiers are to be expanded -- regardless
of the hardship for sake of a common good. And no,
Lawrence, I'm not a Bush supporter, but do currently
reside in an oppressive society, that being China.
Additionally, I live in Prague for 4 years (so
understand what good he accomplished, regardless of
U.S. aquiesence and Soviet sponsored totaltarianism
that followed. If you'd point out a metahphor, in a
single line, as reason to think my comments are
wrong-headed, then perhaps they were neither read nor
appreciated. Can't please everyone, can I?

I suppose I must have struck a nerve. I was trying to
make a constructive statement with regards to poetry's
future and our place within it. I'll just retract my
comments, figuring this is perhaps not the venue in
which to share whatever statement I was thoughtfully
tring to make. I'm not gonna debate the validity one
statement by getting into a debate related to
different point -- as my statement is clear and,
certainly, a place for agreement. Young poets, like
myself and many of you, must clearly understand what's
happening out there, contrasted against the real work
that was once being done -- and, sans question, these
are different times and, I suppose, some of us'll need
to just go it alone. I think I know what I'm talking
about, so never mind. Again, this must not be place.
We are, regrettably, at some odds. I've lived in 5
countries, traveled to more, even lived on the
Galapagos and what's most saddening is that too often
I run into groups of cut-out poets from whatever
program who do little to honor, in my opinion, the
process of the craft, themselves, or their culture at
large. I'm sorry, but someone should, has to, say it.
Just look at the lives of those great wo/men and,
frankly speaking, starkly understand that time's the
judge -- along with those people, common people, every
day folk, who are deeply touched for having had their
humanity remembered. To be honest, I expected this
reaction, but am glad for having shared, at the very
least, views from one who cares.

Best,
AJ

Only a USAmerican would believe that Patton liberated
Italy and central Europe.

That was done by the Canadians and the British with
some help from the US troops that made sure they
were on camera.

The Derailing of Metaphysics

The perfect wave of zero hertz is a constant current.
The perfect wave of infinite hertz tends towards white noise.
As the hertz increases, the sampling rate falls behind; think of
sin(tan(x)) for example near 90 deg. As the rate falls behind, a
symmetric pattern emerges around 90 deg.
The symmetric pattern is based on the points of intersection of the
For sine or cosine waves, if the sampled wave is at any higher frequency
than the sampling wave, patterns emerge. If the sampled wave is at any
lower frequency than the sampler wave, patterns emerge.
If the sampled wave is irregular and the sampling wave is a greatly lower
frequency, the resulting mapping is useless.
If the sampled wave is irregular and the sampling wave is infinite, the
resulting mapping is identical to the sampled wave.
No wave is a perfect wave.
The lower the hertz of course the greater the resonator.
Human consciousness is the wolf-note of the universe.
If the perfect wave of zero hertz intersects human consciousness,
the result is the irregularity of every-day life.
If the perfect wave of infinite hertz intersects human consciousness,
the result is the reproduction of human consciousness bereft of everyday
life.
Bereft human consciousness is unintended, enlightened, a perfect wave of
zero hertz.
The irregularity of every-day life is intended, unenlightened, a perfect
wave of infinite hertz.
Any wave beyond the pure waves of zero or infinite hertz are impure.
Impure waves dirty the distinction between consciousness and every-day
life.
Impure waves dirty the distinction between yin and yang.
Only blurred distinctions are generative.
>From generative distinctions, creativity.
>From creative, perfect waves of zero and infinite hertz.
This is the regenerative principle of the noumen.
The regenerative principle co-exists with the continuous unfolding of
time.
At the end of time, all waves are perfect waves of zero hertz.
At the beginning of time, all waves are perfect waves of infinite hertz.
We are living in the mid-time of dirtiness, impurity.
We dream the pure and the impure.
All dreamings are irregular and impure.
All dreamings are the railings of metaphysics.

The restatement of the Poetics List editorial policy has been greeted
by both public and private response. We want to note that the new
welcome message represents a refinement of polices in place for the
entire life of the list. There are no shortage of lists with other
formats or of opportunities to create new lists. We understand the
need for freedom and openness, and, moreover, for a minimally
restricted communal space for poetry and poetics.  But over the decade-
long life of this list, we have always preferred to find ways of
refining and focussing the list specifically for what we feel it does
best, and what the medium is best suited for -- discussion of poetics
and announcements.  We have chosen to set a limit of 50 posts a day in
order to make possible that some of us will read all or most of the
posts. As a result, we see subscribers as having a responsibility
toward building a community of conversation, within this limit, and
are less happy with those posts that use the list as an outlet to
publish their work or to express their resentment about the founding
principles of the list. The problem is not so much objectionable posts
but rather the need to increase awareness of the fact that the list is
a shared public space. We want posts that are productive, not just
unobjectionable. In editing the list, we try to keep in mind there are
about 1200 subscribers, and more web readers, many of whom quietly
unsubscribe when the dynamic moves away from the stated purpose of
this list. We hope our new Welcome message will bring some of the
unsubscribed back to the list and initial response suggests that it
will, even as others, who have a different conception of the list than
ours, may wish to create their own lists (and all subscribers are
welcome to post information about new lists they create).

As an editorial board, it is not our plan, or for that matter
practical, for us to respond further about Poetics List policies,
either to individuals or to the list.

Subject:      Creeley at EPC/PennSound
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"; format=flowed

Saturday night in Tucson, Charles Alexander, introducing the POG reading,
spoke of Robert Creeley as our poetic "connective tissue." So many poets
had an intimate relation with Bob; he had a way of connecting with each of
us in particular and, through that connection with him, to a company of
poets in the U.S. and around the world. In his "quick graphs," Bob also
connected us to a set of poets who constitute a living past for our art.
Creeley is not only a great contemporary poet, he is one of the great
American poets. As he vanishes from our everyday life, where, for me as for
so many others, he was a palpable presence in an ongoing conversation,
Creeley joins that company of poets who have invented and reinvented the
conversation of American poetry over the past two hundred years. If he can
no longer be our companion in the way he has been -- for many of us for our
entire lives as poets -- his companionship is inscribed in the words he
wrote in his poems and essays and letters, and copiously recorded
performances and interviews.

With that in mind, I've updated the Robert Creeley pages at PennSound
(http://writing.upenn.edu/pennsound/x/Creeley.html) and the EPC
(http://epc.buffalo.edu/authors/creeley). At the EPC, there is now a
selected list of obituaries and memorial tributes (including from the
foreign press and some other pieces not otherwise cited on the list). Note
also that Conjunctions has started a Creeley tribute
page:  http://www.conjunctions.com and welcomes submissions (including
those posted on the list): send to conjunctions-editorial@hotmail.com.

Externally, the text has a monkey-shit virus throwing
shit at it deleting things. My absence of faith is
famished from one too many watershed moments. Playing
games online. Connectivity at saturation levels.
Hurtling through the night to Alabama. Caleb blurs
mazes essential in outward drops. Dripping. Smiling
bursts of cinematic realism. Went to sleep with my
head wrapped in Mary Kay. She was sprawled across
oblong dawdling. We solve. We solve for. We solve for
x. Dissolution lulls under satori. Warped pores down
raw like limp light, I'd have said, had Daddy even
hurt rude oolong hungry droughts, hunter's doubt, a
hundred or more. If it'd been me. Lots of positive
reinforcement; so maybe I need to make shit up to
worry about. Cleave veal stout xanax cluster
showmanship Euripides, pppplural-like, wow I wanna tip
her over and fill her up. Filed down around it. It's
not fleeting. You know how trust sometimes
meticulously prevaricates. Grandma says hello. The sky
drops to dead blue. Mary. Hertz hazzard system hots
freeing hazing flailed lizard cobalt bounce veils
haphazardly. Freezing, after gray and stripped
firmament, back Ohio. The black trucks carrying our
lives. Night presses down on road presses up winding;
sessions of curves full on the Tongue like Mary's
white feet on the pedal, her salty halo the outline of
inflating. There are dark skeletal towers sucked into
wooded corners all over the country. Legs gelid with
ache chancre. The towers rusting to overlook
everything.

I walk home on Tuesday morning with loose boots over a
hissing bridge from my bride, hair rumbling and
array_rand. The lake squeezes into a river through
piles of slag and ore. Rolling through some tree-lined
streets.

Subject:      A walk with Robert Creeley
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

A little movie like Nudel's I hope

When I saw a joint reading somewhere in downtwon nyc
at which various people including Robert Creeley were
reading poems by Stanley Kunitz to celebrate his 90th
birthday or some such milestone, it wasn't a Creeley
crowd so there weren't that may people jostling for
his attention afterwards, and he said to me, walk
along with me for a few blocks...

We spoke of the new conformism, I said I still wanted
to go within myself to decide what I wanted to be and
then meet the world on those terms...and he said "I
INSIST on it!"

I spoke of going to Segue readings at the Ear Inn
fairly frequently, how Bruce Andrews had told me more
than once that he didn't know my poems and I shd send
him some, and finally I did, but I didn't by this
point, know whether he'd ever read them and comment.
Creeley: "He'd BETTER!"...he was evidently saying that
the New American Poetry tradition still had something
to teach langpo, and, implictly, that I had SOME part
to play as an example of that tradition...though I had
long ago learned not to ask Creeley for advice on
magazines to submit to, or anything like
that...((around 1980, for instance, I was still in
Buffalo, and he had replied "I haven't been READING
many magazines...just some journals with a particular
focus on the situation of language...")) (I'm
reconstructing whatever the exact utterance was by
employing some of his favorite words).

...So what happens in our walk down the block but we
run into someone who looks like Robert Bly...it was,
Creeley says "Robert Bly, this is Stephen Baraban,
Stephen Baraban, this is Robert Bly"...I said "I
THOUGHT so!", a little pointedly.  They exchange some
banter I don't remember, what Bly was doing in town,
etc.  Creeley said he had just been in Washington, DC.
 Bly has this knowing look, "oh, doing something with
Congress?" Creeley says "even *I* wouldn't sink that
low!"

Bly parted from us, he didn't respond to MY goodbe, I
was just something the cat dragged in, I walked a
litte
bit more with Creeley, and left for the subway and
Long Island Rail Road.

Actually, I think it was more down to the Russians.

What are the figures, 19 German divisions deployed on the Eastern Front, 1
elsewhere?

One of the singularly frightening things about the Great Patriotic War was
how easily it could have gone the other way.

If Hitler hadn't opened the Russian Front, if the Luftwaffe had concentrated
on bombing the RAF air bases rather than doing a blitzkreig on Coventry ...

Maybe god *was* on our side.

The tank tracks on Patton's training ground in the Mohave desert (near
the Patton museum of course) are still there, because the desert
recovers so very slowly from that sort of thing.

About two hours east of LA; Chirico Summit is basically a diner and the
museum a bunch of old tanks.

My favourite quote from this page:

"After the war Patton was made governor of Bavaria. He was severely
criticized for allowing Nazis to remain in office and at a press
conference on 22nd September 1945, Patton created outrage when he
said: "This Nazi thing. It's just like a Democratic-Republican
election fight.""

Not sure about "god" but I do know that  General Electrics shipyards
were on "our" side.

And now for the poetics bit.

I haven't been paying much attention to the memorials but I suppose
Creeley's passing marks the passing of the core of the Black Mountain
School of poetry. (http://web.njit.edu/~kimmelma/topicessay.html YMMV
as to list content.) Even the fringes are looking a little ragged -
only Edson and Enslin are alive and seem to have reputations. Maybe
nostalgia for a past time when giants seemed to casually walk the
earth would make current endeavours seem a little small.

Friendless in SpamGirlTown.

        Without friends, no one would want to live, even if he had all
other goods. Is this sentence a SpamGirlTown sentence or is it a
SpamGirlTown interval sentence or is this clause a SpamGirlTown clause or
not a SpamGirlTown clause. Well I never did! Some of these statements are
from SpamGirlTown. New girls job in our sight. Perhaps this statement is
from SpamGirlTown.
        There used to be a real me, but I had it surgically removed.
Sometimes I say to myself, yes, this is a SpamGirlTown statement, and you
can easily guess which one, but then perhaps you can't.
  We keep the concept site of beauty and respect drive for our LOLLIES
bodies. What does it matter if this were SpamGirlTown or not, and no, it's
not just the second or the third statement after the first but perhaps the
sentences that talk about the SpamGirlTown sentences.
        Bashfulness is an ornament to youth, but a reproach to old age.
Great things are done when men and mountains meet. On one level this is
perhaps a SpamGirlTown sentence but on a meta level this is clearly an
about statement about SpamGirlTown because there are no girls in this
sentence. This is not done by jostling in the street. Amazingly there are
luscious breasts in this sentence even though it's not a SpamGirlTown
sentence but it always makes you wonder. It's not a question of happiness,
it's a requirement. For a meta-SpamGirlTown sentence to have a requirement
it must have a SpamGirlTown-sentence subject. Consider the alternative. I
am even though this is not SpamGirlTown and never was.

I suggest looking at Baghdad's Burning's current April 3 entry.
Her accounting and take on USA's TV shows taking over the airwaves in
Baghdad is - it seems to me - one of the most accurate contemporary examples
that I have read of this country's attempt to impose "its" language, point
of view, etc. on to Iraq. A "media imperialism," or so it appears.
Outrageous and disgusting and stupid - - her piece is very good in getting
all that framed. (Her righteousness is almost humorous in that - if we turn
on the TV - her accounting of media intrusion and manipulation is often a
violation we also live with everyday.) In Iraq - given these conditions -
the divorce between media and reality - it hardly takes a radical
fundamentalist to want to blow out the TV screens - to cut off the head, so
to speak, of these weird, 'self' serving media messengers.

How poetry, theater and other 'reality' based media have a chance - or
workable strategy -  against this control by State and Corporate owned
communication systems is a real question. I suspect the real motivation of
the Patriot Act is to seal this System into place.

What bets can be placed on the Internet (here or anywhere) as an alternative
media structure and outlet? Or other modes of gathering and challenging the
dictates of the "Master Media".

C., to a graduate seminar, very late 70s or very early
80s, "you've all read the article in the new
Scientific American with new information on how
children acquire language?...you haven't?...if you
were visual artists you'd want to know everything
about your materials!"

that combativeness, and slyness, always there in the
Buffalo years at least up till the time I left (around
'82), always interesting.

sometimes it was interesting personal scores--in an
undergraduate course he spoke of some individual whom
time has forgotten, by name, which I (sb) have
forgotten so I'll say Joe Schmo, "you've all heard of
Joe Schmo?  He said to me that people were going to
forget all about Beat Poetry in a year or two...Well,
you ALL know Joe Schmo!"

much more than personal: at a Jungian conference on
Anima/Animals/Animation involving Duncan, C., Charles
Boer, Susan Pitt and her wonderful animated film
"Cucumber", James Hillman and various professors of
psych and religion, held just shortly after Reagan won
his first election (I remember because there was a lot
of talk of Reaganites & Fundamentalists--Duncan said
that sooner or later the people who call themselves
"fundamentalists" were going to learn they  were all
sitting on different fundaments--having a chance to
chat with him, I wanted to say something to R.C. about
a myth I had read about in some text, whatever it was,
let's say Neumann's _The Great Mother_, so I
innocently started to say "in a myth from _The Great
Mother_..." and he stops me right there, says it's
"NOT from there!!!", i.e., it's not from the book,
it's from the imagination and experience of some group
of humans...

        Subject:        Re: updated welcome message


The restatement of the Poetics List editorial policy has been greeted
by both public and private response. We want to note that the new
welcome message represents a refinement of polices in place for the
entire life of the list. There are no shortage of lists with other
formats or of opportunities to create new lists. We understand the
need for freedom and openness, and, moreover, for a minimally
restricted communal space for poetry and poetics.  But over the decade-
long life of this list, we have always preferred to find ways of
refining and focussing the list specifically for what we feel it does
best, and what the medium is best suited for -- discussion of poetics
and announcements.  We have chosen to set a limit of 50 posts a day in
order to make possible that some of us will read all or most of the
posts. As a result, we see subscribers as having a responsibility
toward building a community of conversation, within this limit, and
are less happy with those posts that use the list as an outlet to
publish their work or to express their resentment about the founding
principles of the list. The problem is not so much objectionable posts
but rather the need to increase awareness of the fact that the list is
a shared public space. We want posts that are productive, not just
unobjectionable. In editing the list, we try to keep in mind there are
about 1200 subscribers, and more web readers, many of whom quietly
unsubscribe when the dynamic moves away from the stated purpose of
this list. We hope our new Welcome message will bring some of the
unsubscribed back to the list and initial response suggests that it
will, even as others, who have a different conception of the list than
ours, may wish to create their own lists (and all subscribers are
welcome to post information about new lists they create).

As an editorial board, it is not our plan, or for that matter
practical, for us to respond further about Poetics List policies,
either to individuals or to the list.

CALL FOR PROPOSALS TO SPONSOR ISEA HEADQUARTERS

April 5, 2005

The Inter-Society for the Electronic Arts (ISEA) requests expressions of
interest from institutions with an interest in sponsoring and supporting
its Headquarters activities.

The Inter-Society for the Electronic Arts (ISEA) is an international
nonprofit organization fostering interdisciplinary academic discourse
and exchange among culturally diverse organizations and individuals
working with art, science and emerging technologies. ISEA publishes a
newsletter; hosts an online archive and exchange environment and
oversees the International Symposium on Electronic Art, a regular
gathering of the international art, science and technology community.

The Board and membership of ISEA have always been international,
bringing together individuals and organizations from around the world.
ISEA was founded in the Netherlands in 1990 and was hosted there until
1996, when it moved to Headquarters in Montr=E9al, Quebec, Canada. From
2001 it has again been hosted in the Netherlands.

As an international body, ISEA seeks to forge and develop new
relationships and partnerships. ISEA is seeking to relocate Headquarters
in 2005 and to work with a new host organisation or institution to
create a stable base from which to conduct its activities. We seek an
institutional host committed to the values and ethos of ISEA.

Relocation of ISEA Headquarters offers an exciting opportunity for a
host organisation or institution to be involved in the future of the
Inter-Society. ISEA is one of the first truly international
organisations to support the development of art, science and technology.
The Symposia remains as one of the most dynamic and lively events on the
art and technology calendar and as an organisation ISEA continues to
grow through its network of international artists, academics, curators
and supporters.

For information and reference the overview of the Roles of the HQ and
the ISEA Board is posted on the ISEA website at:
http://www.isea-web.org/eng/hq_tasks.html.

Please send all letters of interest to ISEA by EMAIL before April 30,
2005.

In so far as you think of making advances in poetry and behaviour ancillary
to it as conquering cities, then you are wrong-headed.

The 1939-1945 war in Europe -

In expressing it that way I mean no attack upon the USA or any of its fine
products and merely try to be accurate -

the 1939-1945 war *may have been a justifiable war. I have known many people
who thought so, many who were later opposed to Korea and Vietnam and the
rest of the wearying list who yet declared that they had had no choice but
to sign up

Born in 1949, I hesitate, tending to see that war as part of a longer
conflict, with WWI, and so not justifiable at all.

Such an analysis would not have been much use to the person who found
themselves in mid 39 with what seemed like a clear cut case of good and
evil. I accept that. I do note however that everything in terms of selfless
activity which was given in that war was very quickly betrayed; and that
makes me think that the idea one can do anything by fighting is an illusion
Inretrospect, much of the good was actually of the devil's side

Whatever Patton did or did not liberate in terms of Central Europe, and I
tend not to agree that he was much of a primary liberator, even the word
"liberate" produces a nasty reaction in me because of the word's abuse, most
recently in the annexation of Iraq, to seek to justify war crimes

Poetry does not work like military success

The lass days of KB and CowPastor Vandal: My Emmerton 2005

Dear AndreaNation and all Caribbean artists intellectuals cultural workers
& environmentalists w/in the sound of Marina

I sharing a letter i juss write to a wo at OUP <not inc in this new lett>
who deals w/permissions payments to authors who want to quote yr work etc.
This wo and me - we don't kno each other - share a wonderful sense of
weather and the environment and at the end of my business w/her this
midnight, I describe and refer to (un)developments in my life i thot you
shd kno

w/the dust choking me from the destruction so that I can hardly eat - the
water that we drink returning to like its limestone white residual - and
have these DS(3s) and Beverley has already had to go the doc w/a dreadful
cough of corridor -

I've tried - in vain - to get an appointment w/the PS of the Housing &
Lands - a man i long respec & kno. . . and a letter of premonition &
desperation I senn in to yr NATION tho promise publication. . . has nvr in
fact appeared. . . I try contact Liz Thompson who when she was in NYC
sometime ago at an X/hibition of BaJam Wo artists, at which we share both
spoke, said yes i shd send her the details of my evident concern. Nuffen
of course followed from that. . . I tried lifelines to Dame Billie and Mia
- nuffen there neetha. And I note that whenever you respond to me on this,
you ask a whole series of Qs about 'what am I doing' - as if I doin
nothin!!

All I can in the end do - w/out community support - is set afire to
myself, as I've said before, on this very namsetoura pasture become the
criminal. and I don't really want to do dat, because my spirit flies so
high - so many dreamstories and ideas seem to flow & flow - altho of
course who's to kno if they gods not punishing mwe But I don't think so,
or lets say I arrogant enuff to think that I don't think so - which of
course is whe the danger lies. . .

I write to you now as I write earlier to that stranger. but w/the
difference that I have faith that as a wo of soul, there is something I
sure you can do,  if is nothing more than persuade one of yr colleagues
who's still free and fearless - is there any such? - to come out to CP and
see whats happening. . . is there no voices in BaJam that can raise can
rise? It will be a shame if i hear people saying AFTER I GONE - that Kamau
use to talk about these things and no one lissen not a soul do a ting.
trapped - SURELY NOT FOR EVER - in our Mental Slavery

The plight of one person. the flight of one sparrow . is worth more than
all the kingdooms of this world. But very frew people can live this

What I saying is that my micro case here, is the macro case of us all. The
little done unto mwe, is the burden down upon us all upon us all

All night long, the trucks trundle & boom. Two mornings ago, to destroy
more duncks trees, so they cd swathe more space for the tractors, they set
fire to the slope under Thyme Bottom. if the Fire Beegrade didn't come,
that fire might have swept down into our yard and run all the way down
west to Parish Lands. It was a clear day and a high wind

The destruction of CowPasture to put in an unnecessary and unethical road
- when there are two perfectly good xisting road in this quadrant - for
some new unxplained access to the airport, involves -

(1)   the death of the three dozen cows and flocks of blackbelly sheep
that use to ruminate CowPasture

(2)   the loss of rumination marks the end of peace & serengetti beauty
here and marks the arrival of vandalism. Abandoned houses further pillage,
and w/the blood up, even the duncks trees on the pasture under pressure -
their limbs & branches torn down this harmattan for their plunder, not
picked picked picked between the thorns, as happily traditional

(3)   the loss of pasture - here and all over Barbados and all over the
CARICOM Caribbean = also the closing down of the last sugar production in
St Kitts, and the verge of ditto in Barabados

(4)   the loss of pasture - here and all over the island and all over the
CARICOM Caribbean = the decline of cricket. Sir Viv and Gary S come from
BayLands not from roundabouts, hotels and clogged up death-mark highways

(5)   the road here is unethical because of this and because it is an
offence not only to the people who choose to live here, who are/were so
fortunate to live here to love here - and dispossessed of pristine coral;
thru no fault of their own, but via a willful remote control decision by
Authorities too arrogant & high & mighty to discuss plans that involve all
our futures fortunes w/us 'out here', who are still seen - MENTAL
PLANTATION MENTAL SLAVERY - as chattel anti-heroes have no voice - cannot
afford to be admitted to out voice

(6)   even as I write this, therefore, destruction going on - this old
plantation well, the little Lake (or Pond) of Thorns  - the natural water
catchment for this area - filled in and flattened - hence future floods.
And near the well, a fledgling BEARDED FIG-TREE (shrine of ancient African
& Amerindian spirits) its cinnamon beards just showing. a dear endangered
species. cruelly unethically soon to gone .  i cd go on an gone . like all
the people of Thyme Bottom already gone gone gone. . .

(7)   at 3 pm today, tractors break thru the last line of bush & duncks
between them and our house my yard. A noise as of bombing and a great
cloud of dust - FALOUJA - and now there's nothing left between ourselves
and them - the slave well nxt, the bearded fig- tree nxt - today if not
tomorrow. My eyes are full of grit and helpless scars, as if I am the last
person in the world the lost poet, really, in the world. Rosina say this
morning I shd write it down. But write it down for who for what. . .

I walked out there towards the cloud of dust - the grit - my tears - and
my heart as if rebelled inside me, fit to burst w/grief & loss &
helplessness & pain

(8)   I had also hoped, when we found this place, to found my nation here
- my maroon town, resistance palenque. Bring in my archives from their
shattered world - shattered in Jamaica since the Gilbert Hurricane of 1988
- an archive stretching back now almost 100 years and covering from Bay
Street/Browns Beach/Harrson College days, thru Cambridge, Ghana, SL, 30
years at Mona, the Caribbean Artists Movement (London), Bim, BBC Caribbean
Voices, Savacou, Carifestas, paintings, sculpture (inc early postcolonial
W Af, early Rastafari), Colly, Timmy Callender, Broodhagen, jazz records,
tape recordings from almost ancient Ghana, from nearly every Caribbean
voice of say or song

      and all this a lament - the loss & dislocation of so much of this in
Gilbert (see SHAR.
      see Carolivia Herron's 'SAVING THE WORD'  hear ARK - these are our
documents
      for our last our lost millennium - and still more loss from worm and
Ivan (2004) and a
      terrible break-in (5 March 05) - VANDALL INVASION of our hopes and
consciousness

(9) The dream the vision was to in-gather the scatta archives (Ja & NYC)
here, try heal them and from this wound of miracle, set up a BUSSA CENTRE
for us all - enough peace & space & beauty surpassing any other in the
world - in a small sacred bless - to build a place to live to love, a
place for the LIBRARY OF ALEXANDRIA, a conference room, performance
outdoor places, chalets for writers, artists - that kind of possible dream
- because we had the dream we had the space we had the means - destroyed
by my own Govt - w/out DISCUSSION - and digging us down and STRANGLING the
holy past & constellation flute & future of this place - the egrets gone
because the cattle gone. the woo doves mourn. I itch from deconstruction
cement dust

I cannot even die here now. no strength to even burn myself upon this
pasture as I want to do. As I still may. Because my love, whe else is
there to go, to try to build again at 75? tho I not beggin for your
sympathy - tho that good too - I askin you to LISSEN . one mo Emmerton.
xcep unlike the Mighty Gabby song which sing & say far more than any prose
I prose can say, me na give up. me nvva will accept unrighteousness, If
this was SandlyLane wd we be treated so? again today the tractors wheel an
thump. I can't accept to so unfairly go <Kb5>

p/s I'm being told that all this is too late - that time & the tide has
pass me by - not enuff effort too late! if that be so, let me then at
least hope that you will allow at least my faint words - faintly heard now
on the pasture - be at least a verbal memorial to mark the graveyard of
this place

Steve -

expected to be present for that entire time.

The Subject Was Bric-a-Brac
Jim Henley

Frost and Stevens at Key West sit looking
neither out far, nor in deep, nor at nothing.
Nor at each other, save in sidelong glances.
Other bathers sprawl on other chaises
further down the sloping sands. Somebody's
uncle seems to try to read the shadows
of fluttering gulls, while from the trees, the tone
of some bird's song is stubbornly its own.

A sad man gives no quarter to another
merely for also being sad. With a
nod of his massive head, Stevens says, "Robert,
your trouble is your poems are full of subjects."
Frost works his brow, deepening deep cracks.
"Well, your damn poems are full of bric-a-brac."
They rest. There has been attack and counterattack.
Below the beach, in ceaseless repetitions,
the surf gutters and crests like reputations.

 -- Jim Henley

While I think many critics have made some version of this complaint, one of
the most vociferous is the poet-critic Mark Halliday, in Stevens and the
Interpersonal (Princeton Univ. Press, 1991) -- he's bothered enough about
it to write an entire book that bashes Stevens's poetry for its failure to
take into account other people and "the interpersonal."

I'm not sure if that's who you're thinking of, but it fits the bill.

Take care,
Andrew Epstein

Hi Catherine,

Well, e-zines have some sort of editorial standard. Poems posted to the
list don't have an editorial standard, but they do offer an unexpected
and often random sampling of styles and ideas. A blog is either one
person or one clique, with no editorial standards in place. And because
of the ease and immediacy of blog "publishing," it is often of
lower-quality than other self-published books. I consider blog
publishing to carry a severe stigma. (I personally read a few of the
blogs on poetics, but never those that are used for self-publishing.)

Yours,
--

  In the spring of 1974 i took the all nite bus back to Buffalo from Port Authority...to defend my dissertation...it was a trip i had  taken many times in the 5 yrs i spent as a grad student...i always tried to sit in the back  3 seats...where the motor hummed..but at least i could stretch out...wake/sleep/wake...435 miles to...2 long thwy  hours out...

  Bob had stayed with us the season before...on a wknd trip to the city...which surprised me...we were close....but I was a student..& he was Bob...so i asked if i could stay with him...& he agreed...

  Dwntn Buf. at dawn...i had some breakfast...and waited for the Salvation Army to open...where i found for a quarter.... a pretty good copy of a 1st ed. of Williams "Sour Grapes" & some other books....up main st to the olde campus..where Bob was teaching a class...in one of those Trailer outposts...

  In his car...afterwards.. i showed him the book...& i knew he wanted it...he took it up..and wedged it in the windshield visor like a talisman...and he started to talk...& talk...& talk...till we got to where he was livin'..a plain clean working class apartment...where i'm sure he wrote the poem beginning "roof's peak is eye"...

  Bob talked...i listened & listened.....at one point...he  spotted a speck of dust..and got down and cleaned it..which surprised me...as it surprised me the next day when i woke and he was fiddling quite ably with the toaster..he asked me if i wanted some food...i sd "no"...then sd i always say "no"...which means yes..

  I finished the dissertation bizness...telling my advisor that i was too old (25) to rewrite it..and yes the footnotes were often wrong (i didn't tell him i'd made them up).. he & bob both  signed off on it....those were the magic mushroom years...

  Back to Bob...and more talk..at one point abt the flowers in the room...then about how he was writing these new pieces......he showed me this chart..but that's the one thing i didn't listen to...i didn't want to know HOW he did it..the phone rings..and he doesn't skip a beat..it's the same brilliant intricate endless paced  conversation...it takes me at least 10 minutes to figure out he's talkin' to Bobbie..

  We go to dinner downtown..in this genteel steakhouse...black uniformed waiters...outside the orbit of a grad student.....we both orders steak..he treats me...

   & we go back & talk....& .....&.....&


  I take the nite bus back...dawn at Port Authority..subway to downtown bkly...i lie on the couch for 2 days...my body's  immune system broken down...when i get over it....i'm free of something....Harry Nudel

the net based memorial environment
"Tsunami Memorial"
<http://tsunami.a-virtual-memorial.org>
a collaborative art project
dedicated in solidarity to the victims
of the Tsunami disaster from December 2004
whether they died or survived.

This solidarity is a valuable contribution
not in a material, but immaterial and spiritual sense.

The Memorial is a place -
open and intimate simultaneously -
where people can commemorate the disaster and its dimensions
and take some time in order to reflect for a while.

The artists participating in this memorial environment -
created by Agricola de Cologne -
reflect the disaster directly or take it as a symbol
for the inevitable, the overwhelming power of nature over human civilizatio=

The Sense of Lost


It was the sense of lost.  An evening
of hurt hard enough to stop the begin.
He knew it, felt it in the human urge
to speak what sulfur might backlash

his bit.  Right now, for a moment
though, he might hold it off.  The way
the evening sun slants a shadowless.
But oh, for once maybe the past

might tense up again as if tensing
toughened a fist his throat might
swallow, no, gulp down knuckle brown
to rye.  A gallop in his heart heard.

A lightning split across his eye.
Should he felt it?  Bay at it?  Blink
his massive eyelash as feathery salve?  Feel
it urge again and find the missing

shape shaping there what was and might
still?  For it could become.  But
it was over, is over, he knew
it, hoped it might sure in his tongue

tonguing bits of spilled saliva, sun-dried
tomato pesto, flecks of pine nuts that might turn
to glass.  How might the sound curve
back to vowel, shore up and blow apart

into a beautifully curved swan, prism-
formed and clear?  An esophagus bent
of red acid eelgrass?  Testicular folds?
Clitoral elongations into light?  A hut

the shape of winged throats swallowing
reptiles whole yet human?  One leg, two legs,
at a syntactic, at a full and gallop like missing
time?  Limbs that might mete out a tail darting sunlit

brand across its back for wheat, right there
in public, in his most partial
poetic yet private?  Hear me heard and heave.
Give me your lulling ectoplasmic.  Give me your tongue

in sacred, dead twitching reptile
nerve.  There was a sense of stop, even before
it a sound he heard the subtle stir begin, an evening
hurt in the backlash urge to make things

whole, more like emptiness, maybe, or a
yogic filling sat in vibrationless sound.  Still
a black wall might darken
to white if that’s all there was

on the saliva tongue.  A healing mouth
might lost it in eat to clarify the butter
over ancient song, chlorinate, that is, the rippling cleanse
center clear through to crisp chameleon vowel,

to tender tiny eggs of vast young vaginal testicles,
all the way up without drop or become or horse
or creamy adult talk or first-throated swans
of something smothered but pure: knuckle brown, hot, deep.

-----------------

George Kalamaras first poetry collection, The Theory and Function of
Mangoes, won the Four Way Books Intro Series Award. He is the recipient
of Creative Writing Fellowships from the National Endowment for the Arts

and the Indiana Arts Commission.


George Kalamaras’s poems turn the poetic process upside down. The result

is a poetry that hurtles the reader over the edges of perception and
experience. His achievement becomes text as vision, and his visionary
completion arrives through the surprise of a magical
language.               —Ray Gonzalez

This new book by George Kalamaras is a fit successor to his
prize-winning debut collection, The Theory and Function of Mangoes.
Here, in the new book, the sheer abundance and quality of language, the
inventiveness, are not usually encountered in today's occasions of
poetry. Few collections send us on a journey of such magnitude both
Earthy and as a testament to the enduring constellations of love.
        —Gene Frumkin

The poetic world of George Kalamaras is the trickster world, in which
identity is never fixed, and anything can become anything else at the
drop of an image. It is also the world of the metaphysical visionary and

pilgrim. In these brilliant and endlessly resourceful poems, the
materiality of language at every moment plays both with and against the
spirit’s drive towards transcendence. “Is there a way out of one’s
soul?” the poet asks. “I might one day arrive on your stoop, clasping a
box of my own thinking dust,” he warns us. And, of course, he does
arrive on our stoops, bringing with him not only his own thinking,
playing, dreaming, and endlessly seeking dust, but also the gift of a
visionary and electrically-charged language. Sometimes unsettling,
sometimes profoundly erotic, sometimes dense with broken parts of
speech, with syntax wrenched from its predictable order, these poems
never do the expected. Their power springs equally from yogic meditation

with its search for a dissolution of the self’s boundaries, surrealism
with its privileging of irrational and playful juxtaposition as a mode
both of discovery and of revolt, and the ancient traditions of riddle
and wordplay. This is a global poetry for the 21st century, at home
equally with the great meditative traditions of Asia, Europe, and the
Americas.
        —Judith Johnson

I'm happy to get another spring; to survive a flood of tears and winter
rains; to be in the backchannel company of poets; to unpack my straw hat and
sundresses; to get solicited.


down by the ohio

only in forgotten dreams i charted adventures beginning content to walk
familiar streams not caring where they were leading avoiding all the intriguing
turns that flow to greater knowing i stopped the flowing in my heart and never
realized it was showing now i know those sweet sparkling creeks trickle in
and  out of small ponds but some fall into swift currents into beautiful rivers
and  beyond


for strangers

tell me something about yourself let your heart & mind flow out through  your
mouth tangled & twisted or sweet smooth & straight let the words  flood your
being open your gate tell me the dreams before you grew hopeless the  truth
not the lies about love & its promise bring the pain & longing  back into view
tell me your dreams and i'll dream with you

whether they want peace of whether they calculate the risks.  The dominating
impression as such a moment is that something that may pass for a prescribed

forth like a liquor that leaves them dazed as they move toward the slaughter

One might even ask if one would allow the cataclysm to occur without first
giving
free reign to this hubbub of voices...."

I wonder if some (misguided) :)people are growing
weary of our reminiscences, there's this concept
abroad, as I understand it, that one shouldn't be
glorifying personality.  Like when I told Bruce
Andrews that I had studied Olson at Buffalo and he
said "you mean you studied CONCEPTS associated with
Olson"...but what's vivid to me in this respect is
meeting Charles Peter Olson, the son of Charles, when
he returned to Buffalo around '80 for another go at
getting a degree in English...he wasn't bookish like
his dad, not a creator of dazzling cerebral
formulation, but I had a clear sense through him of
what his father must have been like, since all
conversation with C.P.O. was wonderful, tending
towards a delicious sense of generous expanses--

This looks like a terrific new Taylor Brady book! But Bill, can you do
something revolutionary like let us know the book's price (on the other
titles listed on your website, as well!)

And while I and others are in the cheap seats, maybe a brief Brady excerpt,
too. (?)

I love the idea of sex, Sun Ra, Melville, and container shipping (etc.)
meeting up in the Oakland School system - now that would be revolutionary,
at least an education I would have preferred.
One evening in the seventies, I did once see Sun Ra and his entire Arkestra=
,
including dancers & singers(?) in the patio court yard of the San Francisco
Art Institute. It was kind of special to see a trombonist climb one of the
trees, perch and play on a branch, while we went from planet to planet with
Sun Ra!

Thanks and congrats on the new publication.

Don't miss the last event in the ACT ART series, an evening with
anti-corporate pranksters, satirists and impersonators THE YES MEN.

Next Thursday, April 14
Mills College
Lisser Theater
7:00 p.m.
*free* and open to the public

The Yes Men (http://www.theyesmen.org/) are notorious for their mass
media art works and manipulation of media spectacle. Agreeing their way
into the fortified compounds of commerce, they ask questions and smuggle
out stories of their hijinks to provide a public glimpse at the
behind-the-scenes world of business. Their hoaxes have brought
international attention to corporate and industrial crime. They’ve taken
on the leaders of global free trade, including Dow Chemical, the World
Trade Organization and George W. Bush.  A documentary following the Yes
Men was released in 2004 to critical acclaim, including official
selections by the Sundance, Berlin and Toronto Film Festivals.

ACT ART is funded in part by the James Irvine Foundation, the
Contemporary Writers Series, Poets & Writers, Inc. and A'A' Arts.

The Western State Arts Federation (WESTAF) is searching for young
leaders working to improve and impact the Arts and Culture in West. The
organization is seeking leaders under 30 to participate in a WESTAF
sponsored symposium October 20-22 entitled "Young Leaders in the Arts."
Currently the location of the symposium is still being determined.

The young leaders can be working in arts organizations; as academics
making an impact; as journalists contributing towards public arts
awareness; community leaders articulating the value that arts play in
our society through presenting, producing, exhibiting or performing; and
individuals furthering the arts through other leadership roles. The
definition is broad, but WESTAF is especially looking for a wide-range
of representation from California's rich cultural and ethnic diversity.

For more information email WESTAF at staff@westaf.org on how to submit a
brief bio and/or resume.

Did I ever tell you about a friend of mine, Dean?
Years ago he was on the verge of suicide- then in his late thirties- He wen=
t to his GP for a physical and being of that age it was time for a colon ch=
eck- So his doctor stuck his finger up Deans ass then immediately the docto=
rs cell phone rang- he reached in his pocket and proceded a rather lengthy =
discussion with his wife over what he should pick up for dinner that night-=
 At this point (the conversation became quite heated over whether they shou=
ld have fish or chicken, the good docs finger still  firmly implanted) Dean=
 had an epiphany-
He thought "Why would anyone want to leave this world and miss something li=
ke this!"=20

I must confess that I have no idea why sending poems to the list rather
that posting them to a blog would ensure a higher quality of poem (in
the poems sent to the list) -- is it sort of the expectation of the list
audience that leads to a type of self-censorship that posting to a blog
would not?  and indeed, why don't those who post poems here post them to
blogs and then send links to the poem-blogs here instead?  don't the
blogs have a potentially wider audience?

For me it was a very nice experience, as if performing live before an
audience - although I have not posted for some time now. People often
responded directly or off-list. Sometimes a work in progress could
progress differently because of list reactions. Sometimes people
would indulge in a sort of relay race poetry.

Personally I will miss this opportunity, but I guess there is not
much to say. The list owners rule. And those who want something else
can always start something new.

Announcement, and (scroll down) discount offer --


New from Singing Horse Press:

Hank Lazer's The New Spirit

Renewing and drawing upon a spiritual legacy in innovative poetry --
an American poetic lineage that includes Emerson, Thoreau, and
Dickinson, that continues in the writing of Robert Duncan, Ronald
Johnson, John Taggart, and others, and that reaches out to the
resources of European poets such as Rilke, Trakl, and Jabès, as well
as to the paintings, sculptures, and installations of contemporary
Southern visionary outsider artists -- Hank Lazer explores the
possibilities for a newly articulated spiritual poetry.  Wondering
whether the kind of journey that Theodore Roethke called a journey to
the interior is possible today, when the terms and claims of such
poetry have become habitual, cliched, and co-opted, Lazer draws on the
pivotal Hebrew word teshuvah to mark both a turn (in his poetry) and a
re-turn.  The return is to a subject matter -- a spiritual accounting
and a phenomenology of spiritual experience -- that has often been
censored or repressed in contemporary experimental poetry.

Jerome Rothenberg describes The New Spirit as "something like a book-
length prayer: a crises in search of a resolution through language."
Harryette Mullen writes that "Lazer returns the soul and its song to
their highest aspiration."

The New Spirit draws on the lyrical possibilities developed in Lazer's
earlier collection Days to create a richly symphonic ten-poem jazz
composition where the rhythm and sound of the language drive the poem
onward. To use the language of The New Spirit, Lazer's newest work
constitutes an exploration of "thinking / singing." The New Spirit
marks an important turn and re-turn in the history of American
innovative poetry.

Also new from Singing Horse Press: The Ideation by Phillip Foss; The
Epochal Body by Andrew Mossin; Playing Well With Others by Paul
Naylor, and Near Or Random Acts by Charles Alexander.

Subject:      Joshua Corey's Fourier Series
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII; format=flowed

Thursday April 7th, 2005, is the 233rd birthday of Charles Fourier, the
French utopian thinker whose alarmingly imaginative vision influenced Marx
and many others.

Today Spineless Books announces the publication of Fourier Series, by
Joshua Corey. Fourier Series is the winner of the Fitzpatrick-O'Dinn Award
for Best Book-Length Work of Constrained English Literature, as judged by
Christian Bok.

About Fourier Series, Christian Bok writes:

"Joshua Corey writes a poetic series based upon the psychosocial
permutations imagined by the utopian thinker Charles Fourier. Corey
arranges a resonant, emotional lexicon into a quadratic structure that
emulates in language the kind of interpersonal relationships that,
according to Fourier, might ideally define a social utopia of competitive
cooperation. Just as Fourier imagines a set of artfully designed communes,
in which members, chosen for their variegated talents, but compatible
passions, might coexist in a state of harmonic integrity, so also has
Corey selected a diverse ensemble of elegant, sensual phrases and arranged
them into an array that highlights the beautiful potential inherent within
the force-field of language itself."

Joshua Corey's first book, Selah, was chosen by Robert Pinsky as the
winner of the first annual Barrow Street Book Contest and was published by
Barrow Street in 2003. His poems and essays have appeared in numerous
journals and webzines, including LIT, Typo, Colorado Review, Octopus,
VOLT, and the American Poetry Review. In 2004 twenty-five sonnets from his
new manuscript Severance Songs were selected by Michael Palmer for
publication in a special issue of the magazine Conjunctions dedicated to
the work of young and emerging poets. In 2005 he was a participant in the
Festival of New American Poets sponsored by the Poetry Society of America
at New School University in New York City. He lives in Ithaca, New York
where he is writing a dissertation on avant-garde pastoral and keeps a
weblog, Cahiers de Corey.

Fourier Series will be available April 28th. Postage and handling charges
are waived for advance orders.

Though it happened a day or two ago, Isidore Ducasse was born right in
the midst of the Pope's, Saul Bellow's, Robert Creeley's, and Philip
Lamantia's deaths, only way the hell earlier!  Happy birthday you dead
great guy!  You taught me the proper way to treat a shark and that human
hairs were interpenetrating cones.  You taught me (aided mightily by
Victor Hugo) that the proper way to laugh was by slitting the edges of
my lips with a pen knife.  You taught me that to look at the evil text
standing on my head was to actually see the good side of the writer in
question.  I will continue to seek you out at your various addresses in
Paris knowing that when I knock at the door, you will always be the
absolute last to answer.  In the midst of our present grief, we know
that we have a friend in the vampire and the sarcoptes mite.  Jess

Oh, poems posted to the list certainly don't ensure a higher quality of
work. They just provide a random and unexpected sampling; words from
someone you've never read, fairly frequently. One can find new things in
the blogosphere, but it's a lot of work. Blogs have a potentially wider
audience, and some of the sites listed in the 2.8 million Google results
for "poetry blog" do have a wide audience. Most of us will never achieve
that.

We've discussed "post links instead of poems" a number of times, back
before poems were forbidden. One thing that has been pointed out
numerous times is that an advert for a blog takes up as much time and
energy for everyone to delete as an actual poem (and very nearly as much

can hit the delete key, exactly as I did before. If I want to read
someone's poetry, I must now take an extra step (one that for many
people can involve much more loading time).

Sofia Starnes
A Commerce of Moments
Paper Trade: ISBN 1-886350-68-X
88 pages, $12 post paid to US locations

   Editor’s Choice for the Transcontinental Poetry Award for an
outstanding
   first book-length collection of poetry or prose.

   Couplet by couplet, Sofia Starnes leads her readers on a poetic quest

   for understanding.  Her perfect pitch and her acute sensitivity to
the
   pace and nuances of language are reason enough for us to follow. A
   Commerce of Moments is a gathering of very special poems.

   -- Billy Collins

   A Commerce of Moments marks a solid debut for a poet whose craft and
   elegance are obvious from the first poem. This work of awe-inspiring
   clarity and purity of language is from a poet whose wide-awake eyes
   allow us to experience a vivid, lasting world. Blessed is a poet so
   connected to what is most essential to this life, and perhaps the
next
   too. This book will enchant; a fine collection indeed.

   --Virgil Suarez

   Starnes possesses a fine tuned ear. This collection is so good
reading
   one of these poems aloud relaxes your mouth.

   -- David Baratier

   ----------

   Shadows of Innocence


   Purewhite, paperwhites,
   odor of petals on the wicker-stand on which

   we lean.
   Deathwhite, dogwood white, hybrid

   shadows behind the screened porch...
   We have been cautioned not

   to invade the white square off the house,
   where the dead live.

     Why did you bring the bulbs
   indoors this year?   Fresh spring-

   whites are for old slabs with their prone angels.
   Remember the dotted hearts in our earliest

   missals, their venial lesson, scent
   of onion skin.  We learned

   from them never to flirt with a fragrance,
   for the sake of our faithfulness.

     Blameless lily-white,
   how it escapes us, as white always does,

   with the merest gesture:  a finger
   smudge on the slick envelope, thin trickle

   on the swab where a nail
   ripped, velvet eye-shade against the tissue,

   powdery death.
   Remember the white cassock our priest wore

   in summer heat, like a returning santo?
     It dropped its length on stubby

   feet, into our muddy garden.


   -------

   Flores de Mayo

       Venid y vamos todos con flores a María,
       con flores a porfía, que madre nuestra es.
                  (from a processional hymn)

   May in absentia, magenta
   in our grip; we cannot give a scent-by-scent

   account, born-again children of that long-gone,
   long-withered month.

     Pink cellophane hour
   of caladium leaves, straw-gold everlastings,

   our thin exuding birds of paradise: disquiet
   of an orange nib, the wilt and non-

   wilt of its pair,
   dependent on the day of month,

   how sticky or how stupefied our hands.
   All in that first forelived desire to be in love —

     Children will always fret in starch,
   and we, no less, ran out of chapel

   for the patintero chalk lines:  this,
   our tumult, and that yours, border patrols

   with arms wide.
   Beneath our bursts, ants crawled out in anger.

   I stepped on one small mound,
   was fired upon a thousand times, poppy-red

   around the ankles.  Such
   is the price of love and of invasion,

   price of foreplay.   Don’t you see?
     We exercise pursuit again, again,

   whether in cotton eyelet, threadwork of old
   thread hemming, or tightest thigh-sewn

   jeans, clunky shoes or stilettos —
   we pray-play for acceptance with eyes borrowing

   an old omniscient spring.
     In spite of everything we’ve

   known and tried, how a Beloving lures us;
   out of our game, still that darling likelihood…

     Always a summer-rose
     behind the rose-face of a mother.

   -----------

   With poems from: Calapooya, Defined Providence, Folio, Gulf Coast,
   Hayden’s Ferry Review, Hubbub, Nightsun, Pleiades, Poet Lore, The
Laurel
   Review, The MacGuffin, The Marlboro Review, Sow’s Ear Poetry Review,
   Turnings and others.

Jesse: Thank you for the reminder! It all adds up,
the way we know in which all contradictions are
represented-- on the page-prop beside the computer
(to inspire, perhaps, or cajole) are taped the pictures
of I. Ducasse & Margaret Cavendish-- and all seems
almost pedestrian in its rootedness in the solid world--
like a deep pit full of rats We as Villon(s) will cllimb
up out of-- after devouring ll there is there to devour.
Until then, let's sing a happy birthday song of crypts
and sharks and leopards carressed, since after all,
GWB is still president-- even while WE sleep!

Say lah, hey lah, over the river
under the bridges, boxes of bums
rain in the street, holes in my feet
needles and bottles, men on your chalice
eyes like embraces, gutters of sleep
say lah, hey lah, shudder and shiver
holes in her stomach, thoughts she can't find
waiting for Sunday, candy and someday
into the water, out of my head
over the bridge, into her bed
say lah, hey lah, deep in my pretense
bustin' out veins, losin' her teeth
cookin' up kit, wetting her pants
say lah, hey lah, here at your feet
wrapped in my arms she's seventeen
lost in her eyes, eyes lost,
violet, before she was dead
say lah, hey lah, saying and said
across Indiana, back for Deanna
say love, hey love, nothing to say
nothing to sing, nothing to bring
bringing nothing to rhyme
pulses wrapped in red roaring
roaring, nothing is said
waiting in line, needlepoint instant
bigger than life, mine goes bad
and good in the cradle, in the hips
the shameless wordless lips

if anyone is interested in atmospheric phenomena of an aural nature, do yr =
research on steve mcgreevy - he invented this VLF (very Low Frequency) ante=
nna - the recordings from WVA are super rich, but Steve's recordings are ve=
ry sparse, picking up specific upper atmosphere disturbances. he has mp3 al=
so, do yr math!

by the way, i did a bunch of recording also, studied these phenomena, and, =
if you go out and purchase a VLF antenna, go to yr nearest residential neig=
hborhood - the 60 Hz hum is a freak out! and that's all the antenna will pi=
ck up...

yours, no poetry,

How serendipitous for me that I'm reading Steve Dalachinsky's  Lautreamont's=
=20
dilemma(Ment), that Jess Glass mentions Ducasse's birthday, and I  recently=20
reread Camus' brilliant  "The Poet's Rebellion".  Ducasse was  undoubtedly a=
n=20
enigmatic and tortured young man. His scanty biography leaves us  very littl=
e=20
about his sad short life, but his work is regarded as an essential  foundati=
on=20
of the surrealist movement in literature. Besides Maldoror's  songs of the=20
shark and the smile-by-knife, I especially remember the dung  beetle, and th=
e=20
sailor who returns home to find his wife pregnant by another  man. The husba=
nd=20
then forces her to walk the ramparts of St. Malo in the wintry  weather, and=
 she=20
contracts pneumonia and dies. These two episodes are a more  subtle form of=20
inhumanity compared to the other vile vignettes. Camus' "The  Rebel -The Poe=
t's=20
Rebellion, Lautreamont and Banality" is quite interesting and  explains poor=
=20
Isadore for me. I think he's nailed it:
=20
"Lautreamont demonstrates that the rebel dissimulates the desire to accept =20
appearance behind the desire for banality. In either case, whether he abases=
 or=20
 vaunts himself, the rebel wants to be other than he is, even when he is=20
prepared  to be recognized for what he really is. The blasphemies and the=20
conformity of  Lautreamont illustrate this unfortunate contradiction, which=20=
is=20
resolved in his  case in the desire to be nothing at all. Far from being a=20
recantation, as is  generally supposed, the same passion for annihilation ex=
plains=20
Maldoror's  invocation of the primeval night and the laborious banalities of=
 the=20
"Poesies".  . . Lautreamont, who is usually hailed as the bard of pure=20
rebellion, on the  contrary proclaims the advent of the taste  for intellect=
ual=20
servitude  which flourishes in the contemporary world. The "Poesies" are onl=
y a=20
preface to  a "future work" of which we can only surmise the contents, and w=
hich=20
was to have  been the ideal end-result of literary rebellion.. . .For the=20
creative writer it  is a question of his own form of banality, which must be=
=20
completely created.  Every genius is at once extraordinary and banal. He is=20=
nothing=20
if he is only one  or the other. We must remember this when thinking of=20
rebellion. It has its  dandies and its menials, but it does not recognize it=
s=20
legitimate sons."
=20
Today's modern rebel poets seek novel and effective venues in which to =20
distribute their laments, all the while suspecting they may never succeed in=
 =20
changing anything. Perhaps that is the essence of the absurdity and futility=
 of =20
rebellious literature, that strange combination of nihilism and creativity,=20=
the =20
exaltation of the common. Lautreamont wished to defend and console mankind,=20=
=20
so he says. But in the end, or at the end, whether as Maldoror or  the=20
penitent of the Poesies, Lautreamont and maybe Dalachinsky both  conclude:

 "I=E2=80=99ll have mine to go."

T.M.,

A few of us are having a backchannel discusion on the topic of
unreadability. I was thinking more along the lines of David Baptiste Chirot's  essay about
spontaneous writing which fortunately still persists  in some of the work of
Dalachinsky, Vernon Frazer and very few others.  However, your poem brings
forward to me the reality of people themselves being  unreadable. Their lives are
so incomprehensible and painful to observe, so  confusing in which to
participate, that unreadable poetry seems a valid way  to express the unreadable
nature of people. Indeed, existence itself can be  absurdly unreadable, but
necessarily liveable.

well, Harry, he didn't die of heartbreak.

i have a hard time with Bellow (which to be pronounced correctly has to be done in the admittedly posh tones of Martin Amis, which extends the last syllable).  reading Herzog the summer before college remains a pivotal literary experience for me, although like my reading of Allan Bloom, i think i ignored most of the ideological content (never as prominent in Bellow) to share in the life of the mind immersed in reading.  i rather liked the idea that Herzog wrote dead authors, although i missed the idea that this was indication of his crisis.  i tried to read other works by Bellow, but they never got to me.  and then it passed that he made that idiotic comment about Zulus and Tolstoy.  and for a long time became consigned to that group who, in mourning and protesting the passing of Western Civ, were creating a caricature of it and mostly shoring up the resentiment of the equally idiotic side that consigns everything to the category of Dead White Male.  (my take on Western Civ i
 s much
 like Daniel Defoe's take on "The True-Born Englishman," id est, there is no such being, as it is always coming from everywhere).

so Bellow was on my index, but I had latterly (mostly because of Martin Amis who is distinctly not stupid, tho' his father is not the great novelist he believes, for me) decided I should read him again, if only to have more ammunition.  And I chose Ravelstein, the "memoir" of Allan Bloom, who is nothing if not the very model of the American Mandarin.  And I have to say the first 100 pages were close to purgatory for me, reliving again the incoherent and ultimately solipsistic take on western civ (as set by Hutchins' Great Books), as well as the revealing of what I expected.  Ravelstein is not much more than a cult leader; as long as you agree with him, you are wonderful.  And he revels in his students access to power.  Then there is the closeted sexuality...

The narrator is supportive of Ravelstein, but much more diffident.  There is no critique within the book of Ravelstein.  Yet the portrait itself is in some way devastating.  Ravelstein is not after scholarship, but after power and money and control.  And the narrator's diffidence borders on irony, particularly his repeated remarks that he knows he wants to write a biography of his friend.  And then the narrative turns once the narrator eats some bad fish and comes down with a horrific neurological element, not unlike his friend's wasting away by AIDS.  Though there continue to marks of that narcissistic, privileged male point of view, there is also something humane and earthy.  Ravelstein is something of a wonder, a genuine, heartfelt memory of a friend who had many faults, and an outing of the pyramid scheme that is the cynical invoking of Western Civ, Western Civ as a skull and bones society.  I finished it not knowing if Bellow meant to do this because he never shows his h
 and.
 But it would take a rather naive reader to think that the narrator or Ravelstein are merely handpuppets for the author.  We all make comments like Bellow's about Zulus, though they may have different ideological tendencies.  The truth that I learned from Ravelstein is that judging another human requires understanding them in full.

Subject:      Pope's Will, in case you haven't seen this. (fwd)
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII; format=flowed

The following is the Vatican information service's English translation of the
official Italian translation of the text of Pope John Paul II's last will and
testament, which was originally written in Polish, dated March 6, 1979, with
successive additions (The editor's notes are the AP's. The parentheses are in
the pope's text, except for Vatican notations):

The testament of 6.3.1979 (Eds: March 6, 1979)

(and successive additions)

"Totus Tuus ego sum" (Eds: Latin for "I am completely in Your hands")

In the Name of the Most Holy Trinity. Amen.

"Watch therefore, for you do not know on what day your Lord is coming" (cf.
Matthew 24, 42)-- these words remind me of the last call, which will happen at
the moment the Lord wishes. I desire to follow Him, and I desire that
everything making up part of my earthly life should prepare me for this moment.
I do not know when the moment will come, but like everything else, I place it
too in the hands of the Mother of my Master: Totus Tuus. In the same maternal
Hands I leave everything and everyone with whom my life and vocation have
linked me. In these Hands I leave, above all, the Church, as well as my Nation
and all humanity. I thank everyone. Of everyone I ask forgiveness. I also ask
for prayer, that the Mercy of God may appear greater than my weakness and
unworthiness.

During the spiritual exercises I reread the testament of the Holy Father Paul
VI. That reading prompted me to write this testament.

I leave no property behind me of which it is necessary to dispose. As for the
everyday objects that were of use to me, I ask they be distributed as seems
appropriate. My personal notes are to be burned. I ask that this be attended to
by Father Stanislaw (Eds: his personal secretary, Archbishop Stanislaw
Dziwisz), whom I thank for his collaboration and help, so prolonged over the
years and so understanding. As for all other thanks, I leave them in my heart
before God Himself, because it is difficult to express them.

As for the funeral, I repeat the same dispositions as were given by the Holy
Father Paul VI. (Here is a note in the margin: burial in the bare earth, not in
a sarcophagus, 13.3.92) (Eds: March 13, 1992).

"Apud Dominum misericordia et copiosa apud Eum redemptio." (Eds: Latin for
"With the Lord there is mercy, and with Him plentiful redemption.")

John Paul pp. II

Rome, 6.III.1979 (Eds: March 6, 1979)

After my death I ask for Masses and prayers.

5.III.1990 (Eds: March 5, 1990)

* * *

(Eds: Undated sheet of paper)

I express my profound trust that, despite all my weakness, the Lord will grant
me all the grace necessary to face according to His will any task, trial or
suffering that He will ask of His servant, in the course of his life. I also
trust that He will never allow me-- through some attitude of mine: words, deeds
or omissions-- to betray my obligations in this holy Petrine See.

24.II-1.III.1980 (Eds: Feb. 24-March 1, 1980)

Also during these spiritual exercises, I have reflected on the truth of the
Priesthood of Christ in the perspective of that Transit that for each of us is
the moment of our own death. For us the Resurrection of Christ is an eloquent
(Vatican notation: added above, decisive) sign of departing from this world--
to be born in the next, in the future world.

I have read, then, the copy of my testament from last year, also written during
the spiritual exercises-- I compared it with the testament of my great
predecessor and Father, Paul VI, with that sublime witness to death of a
Christian and a Pope-- and I have renewed within me an awareness of the
questions to which the copy of 6.III.1979 (Eds: March 6, 1979) refers, prepared
by me (in a somewhat provisional way).

Today I wish to add only this: that each of us must bear in mind the prospect
of death. And must be ready to present himself before the Lord and Judge-- Who
is at the same time Redeemer and Father. I too continually take this into
consideration, entrusting that decisive moment to the Mother of Christ and of
the Church - to the Mother of my hope.

The times in which we live are unutterably difficult and disturbed. The path of
the Church has also become difficult and tense, a characteristic trial of these
times-- both for the Faithful and for Pastors. In some Countries (as, for
example, in those about which I read during the spiritual exercises), the
Church is undergoing a period of such persecution as to be in no way lesser
than that of early centuries, indeed it surpasses them in its degree of cruelty
and hatred. "Sanguis martyrum-- semen christianorum" (Eds: Latin for "Blood of
the martyrs-- seeds of Christians"). And apart from this-- many people die
innocently even in this Country in which we are living.

Once again, I wish to entrust myself totally to the Lord's grace. He Himself
will decide when and how I must end my earthly life and pastoral ministry. In
life and in death, Totus Tuus in Mary Immaculate. Accepting that death, even
now, I hope that Christ will give me the grace for the final passage, in other
words (Vatican notation: "my") Easter. I also hope that He makes (Vatican
notation: "that death") useful for this more important cause that I seek to
serve: the salvation of men and women, the safeguarding of the human family
and, in that, of all nations and all peoples (among them, I particularly
address my earthly Homeland), and useful for the people with whom He
particularly entrusted me, for the question of the Church, for the glory of God
Himself.

I do not wish to add anything to what I wrote a year ago - only to express this
readiness and, at the same time, this trust, to which the current spiritual
exercises have again disposed me.

John Paul II

* * *

Totus Tuus ego sum 5.III.1982 (Ed: March 5, 1982)

In the course of this year's spiritual exercises I have read (a number of
times) the text of the testament of 6.III.1979 (Eds: March 6, 1979). Although I
still consider it provisional (not definitive), I leave it in the form in which
it exists. I change nothing (for now), and neither do I add anything, as
concerns the dispositions contained therein.

The attempt upon my life on 13.V.1981 (Eds: May 13, 1981) in some way confirmed
the accuracy of the words written during the period of the spiritual exercises
of 1980 (24.II-1.III) (Eds: Feb. 24-March 1).

All the more deeply I now feel that I am totally in the Hands of God-- and I
remain continually at the disposal of my Lord, entrusting myself to Him in His
Immaculate Mother (Totus Tuus)

John Paul pp.II

* * *

5.III.82 (March 5, 1982)

In connection with the last sentence in my testament of 6.III.1979 (March 6,
1979) ("concerning the site / that is, the site of the funeral / let the
College of Cardinals and Compatriots decide")-- I will make it clear that I
have in mind: the metropolitan of Krakow or the General Council of the
Episcopate of Poland. In the meantime I ask the College of Cardinals to
satisfy, as far as possible, any demands of the above-mentioned.

* * *

2. 1.III.1985 (Eds: March 1, 1985) (during the spiritual exercises)

Again-- as regards the expression "College of Cardinals and Compatriots": the
"College of Cardinals" has no obligation to consult "Compatriots" on this
subject, however it can do so, if for some reason it feels it is right to do
so.

Bruce Andrews has maintained a consistent position at the radical edge of
the literary avant-garde. He is a central figure in what has become known
as "Language Poetry" and author of over thirty volumes of poetry, a large
body of work online, and a collection of innovative critical essays
(Paradise & Method: Poetics & Praxis [Northwestern University Press]). He
has published poetry, performance scores, and literary theory widely and
has been the subject of numerous critical articles in recent
years---including the Aerial anthology on his work (Bruce Andrews:
Contemporary Poetics as Critical Theory), a symposium in Jacket, the online
journal from Australia, and a MLA panel on "Bruce Andrews and the Social
Politics of the Avant-Garde." He co-edited the journal L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E;
featuring critical, theoretical and review essays, the journal promoted "a
spectrum of writing that places attention primarily on language and ways of
making meaning, that takes for granted neither vocabulary, grammar,
process, shape, syntax, program, or subject matter." He lives in New York,
is a professor of political science at Fordham University, and is Music
Director for Sally Silvers & Dancers.

Barrett Watten's Progress/Under Erasure re-presents in a new edition, with
a new preface, two innovative long poems by one of the best-known poets and
critics associated with "Language" writing. Upon its original publication
in 1985, Progress was greeted with enthusiasm and public debate. Its
linguistically charged, emotionally relentless, and culturally reflexive
nonnarrative form was pitched against the media saturation and political
banality of Reagan era. If Progress is a nonnarrative directed toward the

(Joseph Conrad) "said that art was an attempt to render the highest justice
to the visible universe: that it tried to find in that universe, in matter as
well as in the facts of life, what was fundamental, enduring, essential. The
writer's method of attaining the essential was different from that of the
thinker or the scientist. These, said Conrad, knew the world by systematic
examination. To begin with the artist had only himself; he descended within
himself and in the lonely regions to which he descended, he found "the terms of
his appeal". He appealed, said Conrad, "to that part of our being which is a
gift, not an acquisition, to the capacity for delight and wonder... our sense of
 pity and pain, to the latent feeling of fellowship with all creation - and
to  the subtle but invincible conviction of solidarity that knits together the
loneliness of innumerable hearts... which binds together all humanity - the
dead  to the living and the living to the unborn." - excerpt Bellow's Nobel
Lecture  1976

MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

The short paragraph below on the "unreadable" poem as a valid
response to the "unreadable" life is just another way to
bolster the old saw that poetry, to be understandable, must be
de-codable in light of the poet's life.  In turn, this idea is
predicated on the idea that everything is a text - Shakespeare
applied the verb "to read" figuratively to countenances or
motives (see the OED) but this understanding of people and the
world has become so ingrained in our ways to interpret people
and the world that we forget the figurative nature of the term
and treat everything as a text - painting, film, psychology,
nature - forgetting that perhaps there are other figurative
ways to treat these things.  We might also forget that to say
that everything is a "text" is the tyranny of the meaning
governor rearing its all-too-readable head.  Not all poetry is
done by the Method - not all poets or their poetries should be
read with the notion that they have dredged into their life
story and have applied language to some happenstance like a
code to be deciphered by the reader.  Concern over poets'
biographies or auto-biographies is, in so many cases, no
different than the eager host and audience of In the Actors
Studio asking an actor for the story how his father died in
order to get some insight into his craft.  It's just assumed
that one has something to do with the other.  Poetry allows us
the liberty of it having nothing to do with our lives - and
relieves readers of the task of trying to understand it on
this level.  Poetry is not necessarily the transparent or
occluded translation of life into words - the poet is not
always on the couch, supplying readers cum psychotherapists
with word-symbols to be woven in "the whole story" of a
biography.  Perhaps the back-channel discussion has touched on
other ways to read and to understand the realtive readability
of some poetries.

Subject: unreadable & unreadability

T.M.,

A few of us are having a backchannel discusion on the topic of
unreadability. I was thinking more along the lines of David
Baptiste Chirot's  essay about
spontaneous writing which fortunately still persists  in some
of the work of
Dalachinsky, Vernon Frazer and very few others.  However, your
poem brings
forward to me the reality of people themselves being
unreadable. Their lives are
so incomprehensible and painful to observe, so  confusing in
which to
participate, that unreadable poetry seems a valid way  to
express the unreadable
nature of people. Indeed, existence itself can be  absurdly
unreadable, but
necessarily liveable.

Two quick responses, without much analysis:

1. In my creative writing class last night, a student read a wonderful poem
that on first reading presented a rather impenetrable surface, which my
students and I worked pretty hard to "decode." My own assumption was not
that the poem was autobiographical, but my students' assumption was, and so
this led to them interrupting me as I was trying to get them to read the
poem as a text so that they could ask the poet over and over again what the
poem was about. I did not want her to, and she agreed with me that she
shouldn't tell them, and her refusal finally got them to look at the words
and what they meant and how they created a meaning all by themselves without
our having to know anything about the poet's autobiography. At the end of
the class, because the students kept insisting, the poet told them where in
her life the poem came from--because it did have an autobiographical
starting point--and every reading of the poem we had come up with turned out
to be wrong. It was a wonderful teaching moment.

2. I have talked on the list before about the translations I am doing of the
Persian poet Saadi. One of the interesting things about reading what people
have said about him over the years has been dealing with the assumption of
most of the critics that the "I" in his book is autobiographical, a reading
which the text itself renders implausible, if only because the "I" in the
text claims to have studied with scholars who were dead long before Saadi
was born. (There is other textual evidence that Saadi fictionalized, but
it's more subtle and too long to go into here.) In part, this phenomenon may
have to do with wanting to preserve Saadi's reputation as a holy man--the
Sufis call him Shaikh--but I also wonder, especially when it comes to the
way the text was read in the west up until at least the beginning of the
20th century, and this is a profoundly half-assed general impression,
nothing I have thought seriously about more than to say gee, I wonder: if
the autobiographical assumption has something to do with an image of the
"oriental other" that does not allow Saadi the "authorial sophistication"
necessary to fictionalize. That it is, in other words, a kind of
condescension. (And then, of course, I wonder if this condescension is not
also a part of the phenomenon that Eric talks about in his post.)

My read on T.M.'s poem was that many lives are unreadable, hence why not
have poetry that is unreadable - not, that specific poets live unreadable  or
readable lives and hence their poetry should readable or unreadable. I was
saying that there is so much in life that doesn't make 'sense', so why should
poetry be any different as a form of expression. Besides, no text is entirely
readable or entirely unreadable, much like people. Can we read the 'text' of a
Pollock or Kandinsky? Also, and philosophically, we're all subject to some form
 of tyranny, even the tyranny of the opinion of others. Why wouldn't we be
subject to the tyranny of some text?

Apologies if you've seen this before.

I'm delighted to announce the publication of _The Debtor in the Convex
Mirror_ by Susan Wheeler.
The poem, winner of the sixth annual Boston Review Poetry contest, is an
extended engagement with the painting _The Banker and His Wife_ by Quentin
Massys (1514). Nimble syntax keeps pace with dynamic language in a
considered, compassionate critique of possession and debt in all their
multiplicities. A polished mirror with a wide field of view.

An image of the cover and an extract from the poem is available at
www.wildhoneypress.com
The book costs Eur 5 / STG 3.50 / USD 5.

The full text is available at the website of Boston Review:
http://www.bostonreview.net/BR28.5/wheeler.html

Since literature is our currency I'm happy to swap for poetry in any form.

best wishes

What I find troubling are the very terms "readability" and
"unreadability" as applied to any life and any poem - and I'll
reiterate that the premise upon which the idea that b/c some
lives are "unreadable" then why not have "unreadable" poetry
is one predicated upon the idea that everything is a text or
"text" that can be read or "read."  Maybe some poetry seems
"unreadable," which I take to mean "incomprehensible," b/c the
poet wants the poem to have nothing to do with life or the
accepted structures of text.  And just b/c we might live under
tyranny, doesn't mean we have to accept it.

Subject: text & tyranny

My read on T.M.'s poem was that many lives are unreadable,
hence why not
have poetry that is unreadable - not, that specific poets live
unreadable  or
readable lives and hence their poetry should readable or
unreadable. I was
saying that there is so much in life that doesn't make
'sense', so why should
poetry be any different as a form of expression. Besides, no
text is entirely
readable or entirely unreadable, much like people. Can we read
the 'text' of a
Pollock or Kandinsky? Also, and philosophically, we're all
subject to some form
of tyranny, even the tyranny of the opinion of others. Why
wouldn't we be
subject to the tyranny of some text?

From the BBC:
http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/4427239.stm

Poet laureate marks royal wedding


Mr Motion wanted to acknowledge how people felt about
the day

The furore surrounding the wedding of Camilla Parker
Bowles to Prince Charles is dealt with by poet
laureate Andrew Motion in his poem for the occasion.

Spring Wedding describes the marriage as a "piece of
news", while he talks of the "scandal-flywheel
whirring round".

The troubled history of the pair's relationship is
also dealt with.

Mr Motion told the BBC he had tried to acknowledge the
range of feelings people felt about the marriage.

He said the relationship "was now running its proper
course" and he had used the image of a stream to
convey the difficulties the couple had faced.

Prince Charles had sent him a letter, and the couple
"seemed to like it very much", he added.

Andrew Motion has been poet laureate since 1999.

*Spring Wedding*

I took your news outdoors, and strolled a while
In silence on my square of garden-ground
Where I could dim the roar of arguments,
Ignore the scandal-flywheel whirring round,

And hear instead the green fuse in the flower
Ignite, the breeze stretch out a shadow-hand

To ruffle blossom on its sticking points,
The blackbirds sing, and singing take their stand.

I took your news outdoors, and found the Spring
Had honoured all its promises to start
Disclosing how the principles of earth
Can make a common purpose with the heart.

The heart which slips and sidles like a stream
Weighed down by winter-wreckage near its source -
But given time, and come the clearing rain,
Breaks loose to revel in its proper course.

I think that the issue here is one of commerce. All avant garde art and
poetry begins as unreadable or unviewable this has been true for at least
800 years and the work remains in this realm until it is profitable and the
mass market decides to buy it. If you look at visual art or fiction for
example no one today would call Giotto, Kandinsky, or Joyce "avant garde"
today because their work has become commercially successful, but most poetry
at least since the death of Williams has not had a chance to move from Avant
Garde to Mainstream and as a result many poets move further and further into
the avant garde with no governor on their innovation because their work will
not become commercially successful anyway. We live under tyranny of the
market now.

I think however that the 'unreadable' work in poetry continues to innovate
and remains truer to an innovative sense than allot of art which moves from
avant garde to the mainstream with commerce's blessing.  The fact is that
'unreadable' can mean
interesting and can challenge the reader the question is when does that work
move into the mainsteam? For most poets today this will never happen and so
we are free to innovate and free to be tyrannized.

just finished looking at Gabe Gudding's blog and notes on St John of the
Cross and the Pope. I think John of the Cross (along with Teresa of Avila)
is so interesting and worth discussing and John Paul's interest in Ecumenism
I believe arose from John of the Cross- some side notes; John of the Cross
was the descendant of Moors in fact he came from southern Spain where it has
been speculated that he knew as a young man Sufi masters and was influenced
by them.

The Sufis (Muslim Mystics) were profoundly influenced by Kabbalah,Buddhism
and Christian Monasticism. Poetically it is interesting to read Sufi poets
along side Buddhist poets and John of the Cross (and other Christian poets
like Thomas Merton) because in many ways all these poets are doing the same
thing and they have more in common with each other than with the
orthodoxness of their perspective religions.

Eric,

Yes, only text is "text", and it is a highly evolved technology for
communication which may or not be an especially 'poetic' description.  Text is a very
different medium of connection, because it affects our  brain-body
differently. Letters and words may affect us in  a subliminal quantum algorithm of which
we are not currently conscious, but  generally speaking words have a practical
function - intentional communication.  Unfortunately, I admit that I'm a
scientific philosopher in far too many  aspects of my life. My ethic is
existentialist and naturalist, and I'm  fascinated with physics. Authenticity is my
guiding principle, so as a  writer I won't separate my words from my "self". That
doesn't mean that other  writers can't or shouldn't. I admit I'm a slave to
making sense of things,  even allowing that some things will never make sense.
DIscovery of  meaning is a subjective adventure we choose to  take.

So from my perspective, I find it difficult to believe that anyone else is
able to separate their "selves" from their poetry. In other words, no matter
which words & letters you choose and wherever you choose to place  them, your
spontaneous and/or edited text reflects you or parts of you, no  matter how
disintegrated your personality or thinking process. Writing is a kind  of
'autobiography' even if you choose to speak from different characters. Isn't  it
unavoidable? Can one truly speak "for" another personality? Is it really  possible
to write from another observation point than your own no matter  how
intentionally unintentional or consciously unconscious your  method? One can only
speak for one, and anything else is imagination. Afterall,  we can only speculate
how someone else thinks or feels, no matter how much  we think we understand
their first person report. This is an  interesting subject for poetics. If
anyone can suggest some links I'd  appreciate it. I'm just now beginning to
investigate this possibility, because  even at my age I'm new to modern &
post-modern poetry and poetics. Is the  creative use of language bound by subjectivity
or freed by it?

Mary Jo

********************

What I find troubling are the very terms "readability"  and
"unreadability" as applied to any life and any poem - and  I'll
reiterate that the premise upon which the idea that b/c some
lives  are "unreadable" then why not have "unreadable" poetry
is one predicated upon  the idea that everything is a text or
"text" that can be read or  "read."  Maybe some poetry seems
"unreadable," which I take to mean  "incomprehensible," b/c the
poet wants the poem to have nothing to do with  life or the
accepted structures of text.  And just b/c we might live  under
tyranny, doesn't mean we have to accept it.

The description of the poetry class is interesting, and
provokes a question:  was the process of you and your class
attempting to decode the poem on its own terms one of finding
a back story or narratival interpretation that would help
explain the poem?

And your illustration of how Saadi gets read is certainly
symtomatic of what I'm driving at.  I know so little about
Saadi and his reception that I can say no more than that.

Eric, you wrote:

>>was the process of you and your class attempting to decode the poem on its
own terms one of finding a back story or narratival interpretation that
would help explain the poem?<<

In one sense, the poem demanded that kind of interpretation because the
words themselves implied a narrative context, though the narrative itself
was so deeply buried or so far off the tangent the poem was coming from that
nothing in the words could be used to nail a specific narrative thread down.
My students were insistent that they wanted to know where in the poet's life
the poem had come from; I was trying to get them to see that they could use
the narrative implications of the text to make (a) sense of the poem
independently of where the poem came from in the poet's autobiography, which
may be repeating myself, but it goes, I think, the points and questions in
Mary Jo's response. She asks, if I understand her correctly, whether it is
possible to write poetry that does not somehow come from your self, that is
not by definition expressive of, or even coexistent with, that self. And
from the poet's point of view, I think she is probably right, even the
"wackiest" (a term that I do not mean pejoratively) avant-garde writer will,
I imagine, in his or her own consciousness, in his or her own interior
experience of what he or she writes, experience that writing as connected
to/part of/choose-your-expression his or her self. What I understand you,
Eric, to be talking about, though, are the political and ethical
implications of what means for the reader of such work to insist on the
primacy of the connection between the words and the writer's life in
granting that text the validity that comes from the pronouncement: "this
makes sense" or even "this is one kind of sense this poems makes."

What I just wrote feels to me a little confusing, so let me try to say it
again in a different way: I think there are two distinct things here: One is
the interest you might have in the connection between a writer's work and
the writer's life because you are interested in the writer's life, or in
thinking about the relationship between how a writer lives his or her life
(how you as a writer live your life) and the writing he or she produces. The
other is insisting that a poem's legitimacy comes from its readability
(read: comprehensibility), its capacity for being understood, in terms of
the poet's autobiography. Mary Jo, in her last post, seems to me to be
talking about the former, while Eric is talking about the latter.

Which brings up a connection to Ray's post about the market and commerce.
Certainly the move that Eric is critiquing is one way that the market keeps
out writing that is threatening to the status quo: To the degree that poetry
remains "merely" self-expression, it is much safer politically and
otherwise, but once it begins to move beyond that realm, either in terms of
its content or its form--and of course you can't really move one without the
other--it becomes "unreadable" in any number of ways that are politically
and economically motivated. Case in point that has nothing to do with the
avant-garde of anything: A friend of mine who has translated Rumi sent some
samples material to Robert Bly, who is, of course, a great champion of
Coleman Barks' versions of the great Persian poet. I do not want here to get
into the politics of translation per se, or to argue for or against Barks or
my friend, but to make my point, I do need to say that my friend's versions
are much closer in form and content to the original Persian, and they
reflect a deep knowledge of Persian culture, while Barks' not only take
great liberties with the original text, they are highly westernized versions
of the poems. Bly's reply to my friend was that his translations were
terrible, did not at all represent Rumi and that they should never and would
never "see the light of day" (which I think is a direct quote from the
letter Bly sent to my friend). From everything I can tell, Bly's inability
to "read" (and I mean, obviously, more than understanding the words) my
friend's translations was motivated as much, and probably more, by his
investment in Barks' place in the market--which has a lot to do with Bly's
own assumptions and work as a translator--than with the quality of my
friend's work. And it is unlikely that any version of Rumi other than Barks'
will make much headway in the market until someone demonstrates the
"readability" of these other versions to the market's satisfaction.

---------

All the watches in the closet are safe


like you, surrendered to a sudden
place, an ache within the folds I wish
were gutted and amenable

stars rise and fall inside your ears
like caves for what you see or
do not wish, these placid convolutions
made like daisies—arrival is a prefect

curved responsibly, seven torments
find you basking quiet as crystals
invoked protective naming to be,
as if wales risen outside your body

round and pale, linger like a well-thought
rune, heuristic angles offering themselves
replacing the invisible as if



Be well

Sauce Robert
Pavement Saw Press Chapbook Award Series
ISBN 1—886350—60—4        Price: $6.00p/p
36 pages, 5.5 by 8.5, 2003

F.J. Bergmann is living in Wisconsin for the fourth or fifth time. She
studied psychology, biochemistry, and fine arts at the University of
Wisconsin while writing as little as possible, and is currently a web
designer and illustrator of a manual on interesting diseases. A previous

existence was spent working with horses. She considers herself primarily

a visual artist, which helps prevent writer’s block. Poetry is a recent
obsession, along with digital art and hypertext. She maintains
www.madpoetry.org, a public service website for poetry in Madison,
Wisconsin, as well as her own site, www.fibitz.com. She reads at spoken
word venues and has been published in Margie—The American Journal of
Poetry, Wind, RealPoetik, on asininepoetry.com under the name Easter
Cathay, in the anthology Connected: Poetry on Life In The Age Of
Computers, and at the 2002 Electronic Literature Symposium. She won the
2003 Mary Roberts Rinehart National Poetry Award and received awards
from the Atlanta Review poetry competition in 2000, 2001, and 2002. Her
hairstyle is deceptive. One of her pseudopodia can reach all the way
from the bedroom to the refrigerator. Her favorite authors all write
science fiction.

A Likely Story



So there was this traveling…
princess on a quest, and she
got a flat tire—I mean
a flat chest, 32 double-A or so
and the dwarves couldn’t fix it,
and there was this farmhouse
and a bad storm came up
with a tornado—no,
there wasn’t a tornado after all,
so anyway, she got soaked
and her red slippers were just ruined, right?
anyway, there was a farmhouse near there
and she decided to stop
for the night and the farmer said,
“You poor thing! You must be
freezing and exhausted but I’m afraid
you’ll have to sleep with
my youngest son, the crown prince,
who still wets the bed.”
And the next morning the princess said,
“I’m black and blue and red all over!
How can I face my sales manager?
You didn’t tell me he wet the bed that way!”




Be well

jump. cut.

furious people cutting in,
you are dancing, may I please cut in
thank you this is the way the binary works
we're on top of each other we've never met
one and another fingering here and there on keyboards
  brings happiness and furious people cutting in
there are many speeds of sound there are many lights
  there are many sounds many speeds of light
   always thinking about the medium it depends on the medium
you are very many frames do you know how many and between them
i am my svengali to my svengali i am my tribly to my trilby
may i please cut in this dance in mine

I encountered the same issue by reviewing Daniel Ladinsky's "translations" of
the Persian poet Hafiz. When I discovered that no "translation" in Ladinsky's
book correseponded to any specific Hafiz poem and contacted him, he responded
that his book had sold over 20.000.00 copies. My review talks about that, how
Ladinsky says that Hafiz talked to him in a dream in Persian, a la God to St.
Paul. There was a comment among many in Amazon at the time how one reader had
understood Hafiz for the first time. How does one "understand for the first
time"? Is that an understanding or a marriage of a product with an ambient
image?

Thank you for that, it helps and is well wrought. He wd have liked it. I
wrote this for bob --

you can't hold on
to anyone
that's clear
my hands are dry
there's a dead mouse in the kitchen
this rainy april day
the temperate disguises of the present
then slipshod into a black world in which
stars subsist
bob no longer bob
but he doesn't care
'I love the energy of irresolution,'
he 'once' said
in his inclusiveness, gently smoking,
smiling, joking, infinite bits
of info
ready to be recalled
so where are they
atoms that fly out into the universe
you were already in --
reattaching to those not yet born?
where does everyone go? and such a singular one

when you died
I stood outside
and felt you gone
and felt you here since
you were able to say
what we long to hear one
another say, each one,
one by one,
and art, then, had meaning
not a usual one
an actual one

Last night during All That Hip Hop Poetry and Jazz at the Nuyorican
we had Jose Diaz - a recently returned US Army Reservist, Iraq War
Vet and Poet joined us with Kahlil Almustafa and Flaco Navaja
performing work dealing with deferent aspects of war.

The showcase on war was tied to the opening of the film, VOICES IN
WARTIME, which opens FRIDAY APRIL 8 in NYC at the Landmark Sunshine
and New Metro Twin. (details below)

props to Steve Ben Israel and the all the other artists covering the
topic of war during the open mic.

VOICES IN WARTIME is a moving documentary that looks at war through
the eyes of poets, war veterans and experts. Poets and words
featured in the film include: Sam Hamill (Poets Against the War),
Sinan Antoon and Ali Habash (Iraqi poets), Chris Abani (Nigerian war
surviror/poet), Marilyn Nelson (poet laureate of Connecticut), anti-
war activist Sherman Pearl, LA poet-preacher Saul Williams as well
as words from poets past like Langston Hughes, Walt Whitman and
Emily Dickinson.


The people behind the film also have a website where they promote
poetry about the experience of war (http://www.voicesinwartime.org) and are
putting out an anthology of poems, "Voices In Wartime - The
Anthology" available from Whit PRess.

***************You should check out the movie this
weekend***********************


The following poem was written after Jose returned home, as he tried
to make sense of what had happened to him in Iraq.

A prayer for relief
I feel more lucid now and then, but at times, I feel the creeping
signs
Of a premature senility, the runaway tremor, the starlit humming of
the ears.
I drive aimlessly in circles, lacking focus, fumbling for change as
my breath freezes,
Like the dust storm that overwhelms the ceaseless chatter of the
airport lounge.

It's like I never left the cold comfort of my cot, as if I were the
signatory still
To some unwritten, ill-advised rules of engagement, some ancient
code of my design.
I see myself at the ready, quick to pounce on the dignity of a man
begging me
With his weary walk for the honor of shining my own long lost,
tasseled walk.

Yet I feel pouring through my rehearsed gaze the distant cousin of
my self-control,
The mastery of a sense unknown, the art of comprehension of the
fearless word.
It is a sword unrepentant that I sheath in the soft folds of my
corrected smile,
Another truce it bleeds upon the false report of our most irreverent
embrace.

Unbidden come to stay my gait the lurid whispers of a languid autumn
night,
Echoes that flit unbound in the arctic hue, the unforgiving joy of
city lights.

Thank you, Ruth -
for your validation of art as one, by one -
It was hard for me to send out the poem to this invisible public - but to
where else?
I've printed out your poem to have.

amen amen

I think here is the issue lets be honest allot of 'experimental'poetry is
easily ignored because there is little audience
but when you begin to speak of poets like for example Rumi (and I would
include in this category, Dante, Moliere, Neruda, Dario and many others) who
are loved in their home cultures the market does not really play a part
since these poets are transcendently important in their base cultures and to
world culture; but today much of the 'unreadable' work is does not recieve
any exposure to the culture because of commercial concerns and thus new
transcentent poetry cannot become part of the conversation of the culture.
When poets retreat into academia and small presses where we have been driven
by the market it marginalizes us and removes any chance for poetry or poets
to influence the society in which we dwell.

An example of this came up in the recent movie the Motorcycle Diaries, as
they are descending the road into Valparaiso Che and the driver quote the
same line of Neruda's work and they both love the work. Che from an upper
middle class background the driver from a proletarian background yet poetry
had currency for both I would venture to say that this kind of event could
not happen in the US certainly and perhaps in allot of other places because
of the tyranny of the market not the tyranny of the text.

Let's all take our clothes off and say a prayer in the rain!

I think the best idea is, however,that if all the people of the world
would stop what they were doing for a moment and begin to applaud, then
God would come down out of the sky, bowing to one and all, and the end
of time would arrive.  A bit like the ending of one of Handel's Operas,
I think.

The absolute best idea is International Orgasm Day.  God, Handel,
Christopher Smart, and all mammals would approve, I think.  Please go to

Subject:      brief notes on my work
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII; format=flowed

brief notes on my work


these starting going somewhere, the idea of wildly disparate style/media
from one moment to the other - the idea of 'work' smeared across 'work' -
coherency but no boundary - artificial transmissions by email and
directory file - enonciation, enonce -

then they went nowhere, what came to mind was 'particles emanating from
the brain,' perhaps in honor of the granularity of microsound or the
despair of a relatively cashless existence.

then they went somewhere with messy economics intersecting messy ontology,
epistemological excretions. so for what they're worth, at this stage -

1 variety

the surface of my work is full of inconsistency. styles change abruptly;
characters that were used were used up; new characters appear at times,
only to disappear, to write in the background. media change from text to
audio/video/image/web/performance and back again; the kernel coheres. i am
bored and probably bore easily; i investigate the domain of the symbolic
from the viewpoint of messiness, and messiness from the symbolic. codes
and languaging are always in the background, disseminated, dissimulated.

2. orders

natural which leaks through manageriality; abjection which smears and
devolves into incoherency; aphasias and disorders of the real; brute and
insistent protocols; sexualities, acculturations, languagings of the body;
materiality of mathematical idealities; idealities of physical materiali-
ties; the economics and political economics of the symbolic, abstraction,
the geographic - all of these are subjects of my work, just as my work is
subject to their fragile and monarchic domains.

3. quantity and distribution

no distribution, no quantity is infinite. the phenomenological horizon of
distribution is commonality of usage. distributivity is unobtainable. art
is a praxis is a practice. quantity is also a shearing-away, habit and
habitus. my work is a nudge. it won't survive the net.

4. common themes

the theme of the hardening and collapse of the symbolic. the theme of
attempting to grasp the infinite. the theme of the 'otherwise.' the
argument against totalization. the violence of totalization. the code and
the broken code. inhabiting the broken. the broken and the disaster.

5. staying with it

if you stay with it, it will come, sensate. if you begin anywhere, you can
end anywhere. of what conceivable purpose would be a conclusion? a history
perhaps, a phenomenology of that history, a rocky landscape stumbled over.
i'd say it works in your brain, but that's presumptuous. i'd say it works
in mine, but that's symptomology. tropes, symptoms cross-reference, you'll
see. code is cross-reference. you might not want to stay with it. it might
never come.

MIME-version: 1.0
Content-type: text/plain; charset=iso-8859-1
Content-transfer-encoding: quoted-printable

I have just come back from being a part of my first mushairra, which is =
the
word in Urdu (at least I am assumingn it's Urdu) for a traditional =
gathering
of poets in Pakistan, and it is a very, very different experience from =
the
kinds of readings we have here in the US. The most significant =
difference is
not only the degree to which the audience responds to a poet as he or =
she
reads=97calling out baah-baah, or vaah-vaah, after verses or images or =
rhymes
that have moved them=97but also the way in which the poet responds, =
repeating
the verse that the audience has singled out sometimes two and three =
times.
With the exception of my poems and the poem read by the guy who invited =
me
to this event=97Paul Catafago, executive director of Movement One=97I =
understood
only a very few words of the other poems that were (Urdu is closely =
related
to Persian, which I understand and speak a little of), but I would be =
lying
if I said I appreciated any of it as poetry. What I appreciated was the
openness and sincerity and clear desire to support the people who got up =
to
read; there was in that room a genuine love for poetry, for language and =
the
way language can move you, the way language can change the way you see
things=97and this was particularly evident in the way the audience would
themselves repeat along with the poet a verse that he or she had already
repeated two or three times=97and it's not that audiences in the US =
don't feel
this, but we certainly don't express it during a reading. We may go up =
and
say something to the poet afterwards or we might clap at the end of a
particularly moving poem, but we do not, we are trained not to, there is
something in the culture here that prevents us from participating in the
poem as it is read, from giving voice to whatever it is that the poem =
makes
us feel. It's almost as if we are ashamed of it, which reminds of =
something
Sam Hamill said in one of his essays about how embarrassed we get as an
audience when the poem a poet is reading moves him or her to tears,
especially if it's a him.

And it is fitting that, as often as not, the responses of the people in =
the
mushairra were non-verbal, or they were quick, ejaculatory comments, =
like
the baah-baah I wrote about above. I remember taking a course with =
Hayden
Carruth when I was studying at Syracuse University and it was about
precisely that, the non-verbal aspects of poetry and how it is those =
aspects
that often give voice in the poem to the emotional energy that breaks =
the
bounds of words. Carruth's course was about rhythm and meter and rhyme, =
but
also about why it is that poets will often spell out the sounds "Ah!" or
"O!" in a line, and we talked a lot about how those things function
similarly to grace notes in music or the way horn players will sometimes
allow their high notes to crack a little bit. In fact, the participation =
of
the audience at this mushairra reminds me, now that I am writing this, =
not a
little of the way audiences at concerts will sometimes start =
spontaneously
to clap their hands to the music.

I read four pieces, two from my translation of the Gulistan and two =
ghazals
in English, which this audience especially appreciated=97most of the =
poems
that people read, I think were ghazals in Urdu=97and I don't think I =
have ever
felt more warmly received or more genuinely appreciated as a writer than
when I heard this audience express their appreciation and enjoyment =
right in
the middle of my reading.

Motorcycle Diaries is basically a Hollywood movie. It has all its
sentimentalities and lack of critical perspective.

=20
Kerouac opens up several interesting questions regarding unreadability. One=20=

of his bases for writing ("silent meditation going a hunded miles an hour")=20
was  to express "the unspeakable
visions of the individual". Silence, speed,the  unspeakable--and meditation,=

Subject: [Lucipo] Fascicle: open call
Date: Sun, 10 Apr 2005 20:14:21 -0700 (PDT)
From: Tony Tost <tonytost@yahoo.com>

Here's an open call I'm hoping to spread like
good
butter.  Feel free to forward to any lists or
post on
any blog or message board.  There's a copy
also at my
defunct Unquiet Grave blog
(http://www.unquietgrave.blogspot.com)

____________________________________________


F A S C I C L E

o p e n    c a l l
________________________


This summer I will be launching a new online site
called Fascicle with the help of Chris
Vitiello and
Ken Rumble. Another web journal, I know, but
one with
some focus, hopefully. We're looking at
running a new
issue twice a year.


Essays/Reviews/etc.

In the spirit of Jacket, Talisman, Sulfur and
other
journals that present a possible context for
the poems
and poetics found therein, Fascicle welcomes
critical
prose on various historical and cultural
tendencies
that inform an innovative aesthetic. Welcome
topics
would include (but are not limited to) Negritude,
Outsider Writing (however defined), Fluxus,
Ethnopoetics (as represented by various
anthologies
and writings by the Rothenbergs, Tedlock, etc.),
performance poetries, the Beats, visual
poetries (from
Concrete to the work found in the
Rasula/McCaffery
Imagining Language anthology), Flarf, Language
writing. Writing on individual writers and
artists is
also welcomed; a representative listing of
possible
subjects might include Hannah Weiner, bp nichol,
Jonathan Williams, Ian Hamilton Finlay, Tom
Raworth,
Anne Tardos, Kathy Acker, Antonin Artaud,
Jess, Ed
Roberson, Jacques Roubaud, besmilr bingham.

Reviews of recent titles are also always welcome.


Local News

A regular feature of Fascicle will be a (as yet
untitled) local news section consisting of
the poetry
news from various communities. What we're
hoping for
is a venue by which various communities can stay
informed as to recent activities in various other
communities, and a venue by which all will
have access
to news, ideas and happenings viewed through
local
eyes. We have 'correspondents' already from
Philly and
the Triangle area in North Carolina, and are
searching
for people from Austin, Atlanta, DC, Vancouver,
Milwaukee, San Francisco and elsewhere, including
communities of much smaller measure. Two's
company,
three's a community.

"The news" is free to the correspondents'
interpretation: it could be news of recent
publications, readings, social and political
poetry
activities; it can also be news as to "what's
in the
air" aesthetically. Fascicle is looking for
two to
three paragraphs from each correspondent, twice a
year.



Word of Mouth
[ working title ]

Fascicle will also feature short 1-2 paragraph
review/notices of work that falls under the
publishing
radar. This includes chapbooks,
self-published books,
internet work, audio and so forth. If it's
too small
to make SPD and you think it's worthy of
notice, we
want to run your review/notice.

Write-ups for the Word of Mouth section
should be 1-2
paragraphs long and include information for
ordering
and/or finding the work.



Family Tree

Another omnibus section in a similar vein as
Octopus'
Recovery Project. Fascicle welcomes short
write-ups of
texts (from any era) that you consider
primary to your
understanding of poetry, that you feel are
under-recognized essential texts. For
example, I'll
probably write on either Clayton Eshleman's
Juniper
Fuse or the Mary Margaret Sloan edited Moving
Borders:
Three Decades of Innovative Writing by Women.



Translations, etc.

Fascicle seeks translations, ideally of
contemporary
poets and writers, but also of relevant
historical
figures.

Additionally, English language poets from
outside of
the US are especially invited to submit
innovative
work; Fascicle seeks to present a view of
innovative
writing as both a global and local occurrence.


Thanks ---

Tony Tost
editor, Fascicle

"brief notes on my work" explains, almost unreadably,  his project.=20

Mary Jo, I think you're missing the point here: the project, the object, of=
 unreadability, I think, in one of its many manifestations, is to elicit, f=
rom the reader, a response that is a negative response, that is, not of abs=
orption of the text (gaining knowledge) but of opening the field of reading=
, where the reader questions his or her actions as a reader. So there reall=
y is no notion of understanding, of gaining knowledge through indeterminacy=
, but to challenge the act of reading, how we were taught to read a text wh=
at is written in "our" language, with the hope of sharing knowledge: who ac=
tually determines what is readable? Who determines, or determined, such sta=
tes of stasis? And this whole idea about the author desiring that his work =
be understood (who's "he"?) you might also be missing the point that langua=
ge can do things apart from saying things. And Alan's work more than "expla=
ins...his project" - it does it.=20

WORKSHOPS

THE WORKING WRITER SEMINAR, with Kathryn Radeff
Three Saturday mini-workshops: April 9, April 23, May 7 12 p.m. - 4 p.m.
Single Saturday Session: $50, $40 for members

Mini workshops are fun, fast-paced, informational and inspirational. In an
easy-to-understand manner, the sessions present the fundamentals of creative
writing as they apply to fact-based articles and personal experience, as
well as the craft of fiction. Lectures and writing exercises, which are used
to illustrate the concepts, are aimed at developing the writers'
understanding of structure, description, dialogue, character, style and
voice. Workshops also cover the art of writing query letters, research and
interviewing techniques, manuscript preparation and submission strategies.
Ideal for the beginner and skilled writer, mini-day workshops provide an
excellent overview of their fields. The goal is to have an article or short
story well underway by the time the session ends. An extensive analysis of
one completed piece is included. There will be one 30-minute break. The
workshop includes a question and answer session.

"Mary Jo, I think you're missing the point here: the project, the object,  of
unreadability, I think, in one of its many manifestations, is to elicit, from
 the reader, a response that is a negative response, that is, not of
absorption  of the text (gaining knowledge) but of opening the field of reading, where
the  reader questions his or her actions as a reader. So there really is no
notion of  understanding, of gaining knowledge through indeterminacy, but to
challenge the  act of reading, how we were taught to read a text what is written
in "our"  language, with the hope of sharing knowledge: who actually
determines what is  readable? Who determines, or determined, such states of stasis?
And this whole  idea about the author desiring that his work be understood
(who's "he"?) you  might also be missing the point that language can do things
apart from saying  things. And Alan's work more than "explains...his project" - it
does  it. "

********************
As I said, it's not my project but I'll  taste it once in awhile. Whether I
read/taste/feel/smell/hear/get poetry, I  still prefer. You might want to look
at poetry, but I still like to read it. I'm  hopelessly antipostmodernistic
where relativism destroys any meaning whatsoever.  You might enjoy the
non-enjoyment experience of eating a thistle;  whereas if I eat one accidentally I'd be
inclined to write a poem about it.  Perhaps I'm unsophisticated or too
orthodox and believe that language and  meaning bind us and separate us for the same
reason, the success or failure  of communication. Poetry might be a special
case where its artistry renders  text, its medium, unimportant. I find that

A couple of things. First postmodernism doesn't imply relativism; read the
canonic texts and you'll see (Lyotard, Harvey, Roja, Jencks, etc. etc.).
Second, Florian Cramer, Sandy Baldwin and myself have both written on
unreadability (in the midst of other texts) in our ongoing analysis of
code, codework, analog, digital, deconstruction, structure, etc. at
http://www.as.wvu.edu:8000/clc/projects/plaintext_tools/ - it may be of
interest.

The Power Vacuum / Vacuum Power


"In 1975, within a small but important cultural institution, a small group
of men laid down the law." (Alan Sondheim)

Front cover: Stark: white letters on black background:

"THE ESSENTIAL CINEMA: / Essays on the films / in the collection of /
Anthology Film Archives /// edited by P. Adams Sitney ///// Volume One //
Anthology Film Archives Series 2"

This is the _essential_ cinema in 1975, chosen by committee, unified in a
singular volume, published by the New York University Press. The myth is
at work as the 'avant-garde' establishes not only its 'manifesto' (Sitney)
- but also its absolute canon, however "open" to present and future
inclusion.

Spine: Stark: black letters on white background. Of note:

The _Washington Square Arch_ logo at the base, with this marriage:

"New York University Press and Anthology Film Archives." In addition of
course: "THE ESSENTIAL CINEMA / P. Adams Sitney, ed."

Archives: Already doing the reader's work. This _essential_ collection is
permanent and permanently institutionalized; these are the films _that
will survive._

Back cover: Stark: black letters on white background. Of note:

"Anthology Film Archives is unique among the cinematheques of the world in
that it selects, preserves, and exhibits a body of essential films which
attempts to define the art of film-making. _The Essential Cinema_ combines
some of the polemical, critical, and scholarly activities of Anthology
Film Archives in book form."

Absent from the film list: Antonioni, Godard, Bergmann, Fellini. Present
in great profusion: Brakhage (never mind that he was apparently part of
the "initial committee" that included Mekas, Sitney, Kubelka, and Kelman.
Later Broughton came in and it looks like Brakhage got bounced. Ten of
Broughton's films are essential. Thirty-eight of Brakhage's are. Bunuel
gets four, Chaplin eight, Buster Keaton three (one of which is a 'prog-
ram'), Griffith the usual two (forget The Wind), Edison none, Bresson
seven, Cornell ten, Eisenstein four, you get the idea. This is the cinema
of cinema, although:

"Within the scale of avantgarde sensibilities there is a wide divergence
among these five men. However, they are a principle: that a high art of
film emerges primarily when its artists are most free." And: "The
curriculum it (The Essential Cinema) provides constitutes a film history
for a student and aspiring film-maker who wants to know the medium as an
_asethetic endeavor._ Within the range of film as an art Anthology Film
Archives attempts to leave out one of the most sublime achievements."

The language smacks of connoisseurship: "avantgarde, high, free, aesthetic
endeavor, sublime." Gender and class are absent, as is - not only Holly-
wood (for which a case might be made, i.e. already over-exposed and
overtly manipulative) - but also, as noted, Godard for example, Antonioni
for another - and that in spite of the latter's trilogy, and the former's
furious and deconstructive assaults on cinema, culture, ideology, war.
Also absent of course - any sign of pornography or erotic filmmaking (one
might include Deren's Meshes but hardly and barely), although the
so-called art or blue films dating back at least through the 20s exhibit
many of the characteristics of "free" as well as deconstructive narrative
(let's get it over with, let's let it fall apart).

Not only connoisseurship, but Deren, Menken, and a few others notwith-
standing, males dominate; both initial and final committee had no women,
or minorities (although "Lithuanian" might pass). What passes for freedom
comes within and beneath the aegis of power; what might be a discursive
formation is transformed into a monolithic and exclusionary canon. No
wonder that "art film" was at a loss before feminism; it remained bound on
one hand to a fairly traditional poetics of film (or a traditional poetics
that was new within film, to give it its due), ad on the other to a
neutralized simulacrum of downer culture with Warhol's stases. To be sure
_at that time_ the excitement was there, but it was the excitement of an
old boy's club, which still dominates cultural worlds in one form or
another. It would appear to some of us that, in order to be "free," the
essential would be always already problematized - and that the _words_
"free" and "freedom" were questionable from the start, as ideological
formations. This is the difficulty with any manifesto whatsoever - funny,
furious, revolutionary, tongue-in-cheek: it's an indication, if not an
_implication_ (in the sense of _implicated_) of believers - it carries far
too much baggage, and its potential anti-authoritarianism is also the
greatest authoritarianism conceivable, since other positionings are
relegated to the differend.

(For example, where is video? Are materialities, diegetic experimentation,
real-time, confined at this early date to film? Kathy Acker and Alan
Sondheim had completed their work; Nam June Paik had been around for
decades; Acconci and many other artists had worked in video and short film
for that matter; Ron Michaelson and others abroad had produced amazing
work. Clearly the "film-world" was a thing apart; from the officiated
viewpoint of the Anthology, "avantgarde" went only so far. "Free," yes,
but "free" within the bounds of medium, genre, and habitus; nothing else
would do, was even possible. To some extent, Jack Smith crossed over into
performance - that was it. Smith rates three in the film list.)

This book, which contains mind you wondrous essays, represents both the
hope and downfall of the "avantgarde": just when you thought you could
breathe again, the air disappears...

  Bunting's advice to young poets

  I SUGGEST

  1. Compose aloud; poetry is a sound.
  2. Vary rhythm enough to stir the emotion you want but not so as to
lose impetus.
  3. Use spoken words and syntax.
  4. Fear adjective; they bleed nouns. Hate the passive.
  5. Jettison ornament gaily but keep shape

  Put your poem away till you forget it, then:
  6. Cut out every word you dare.
  7. Do it again a week later, and again.

  Never explain - your reader is as smart as you.

Thanks a "Bunting bunch" for this, Miekal.

This was writ in time where poems grew slowly - as in the way one prunes
bushes selectively, bunches the ground around the trunk of a young plant,
carefully, etc.

Bunting's process Quite "anti" a commodity function - more attention to a
natural, disciplined growth. No rush, in the way that nature takes its time
- that is a nature not circumscribed by Monsanto, or the other genetic
engineer control freaks. "Product, product and more of it," they chant.
As if nourishment was ever equal to partaking an enormous amount.

Bunting clearly knew how to nourish his limited inventory to the max.

An ecology worth celebrating.

A profuse inventory without discipline is invasive, indeed, claustrophobic.

Poetry as saturation bombing =  not to anybody's good. Muse be bored and
turns the other way, naturally.

Good poetry = good topiary.

So many of us - dumbfounded by profusion, surplus - at loss with the art.
The discipline askew, the objective a no-go capitalist quandary.

The African Violet - singular & alone - conquers all comers. Slowly.

Thanks for the corrective.

Memorial Reading for Robert Creeley
Featuring videotapes of the poet reading
Tributes by Lynn Crawford, Carla Harryman
Kathryne Lindberg, Glen Mannisto, Ken Mikolowski
Ted Pearson, George Tysh, and Barrett Watten
Wednesday, 20 April, 7:00=969:00 PM
The Welcome Center Auditorium
Wayne State University
Woodward and Warren Aves., Detroit

A memorial event for the poet Robert Creeley (1926-2005) will be held on=20
Wednesday, April 20, at 7:00 PM, at Wayne State University=92s Welcome=20
Center. In a career that spanned six decades and was international in=20
scope, Creeley was one of the most influential American poets of the last=20
half century as well as a gifted fiction writer, and essayist. He taught at=
=20
SUNY Buffalo, Brown University, San Francisco State University, and=
 elsewhere.

Creeley is known as a central figure of the Black Mountain School of=20
poetry, which became widely known with Donald Allen's anthology, The New=20
American Poets, in 1960. The 60s witnessed the publication of the For Love,=
=20
Words, and Pieces, volumes that established Creeley's incisive, minimalist=
=20
style and anticipated the "turn to language" of postmodern poetry in the=20
1970s. His novel The Island and collection of stories The Gold Diggers=20
appeared in that period as well, followed by volumes of literary criticism=
=20
and interviews (A Quick Graph and Contexts of Poetry). In 1975, University=
=20
of California Press published the first of his Collected Poems; titles=20
appearing in the next decades included Mirrors, Memory Gardens,=20
Windows,  Echoes, Life and Death, and most recently If I Were Writing This,=
=20
as well as two further volumes of collected poetry.

The memorial event, hosted by Barrett Watten, poet and professor of English=
=20
at WSU, will feature brief readings by eight Detroit-area writers with=20
significant ties to Mr. Creeley. Also featured will be videotapes of the=20
poet reading.

Baudelaire's Birthday

Today is Baudelaire's birthday.
He has survived giving birth to twins
In Lemony Snicket land
And absinthe, the only drug
I never tried when young
Which might still interest me
If only to try once.  My copy
Of his art criticism book
Lies in tatters.
I have to replace that one
So I can read it all.
Am I a hypocritical reader?
With neither brothers nor ghosts,
I enjoy his prose "spleen" most of all:
A dead poet who needs
Neither a society nor to be mourned.
Hooray, Baudelaire.  I'm glad
We're all still there (or here).
Your flowers don't seem
So evil anymore.

All: the note below is from Annie Finch.

CREELEY'S LAST READING

   I was at the reading which seems to have been Bob's last,  in the
balcony of the University of Virginia bookstore in Charlottesville, in
late March.  I had heard him at Orono in July,  where he also told
anecdotes,  but this was different.  For one thing,  he had an oxygen
tank on the floor at his feet and couldn't use the podium--the tube
just reached to his nose when he sat on a table with his blue-jeaned
legs dangling youthfully down.  The contrast between the spryness his
body (and mind) and his labored breathing through the tube was
poignant. He said he had had to breathe through the tube since
February.  When I saw how much weaker he looked than he had in July,
I was worried--it seemed as if the downward curve was pretty steep. He
read from the latest book, which includes numerous poems in heroic
couplets.  At one point he said,  "the rhyme grows more obvious in
these late poems--but it was always there; people just didn't see
it."

The poems are raw and honest and focus on life-death issues,  and he
spoke in the same vein between poems.  It was very intense, direct,
honest,  almost childlike,  the voice and the words of someone with
nothing to lose.  He said some very simple things that felt like the
truest things one had heard in a long time,  things like,  "there has
been so much war and pain during the last century. We need to learn
how to be kind; kindness is what makes us human."  The audience was, I
think, pretty much awed; there was deep silence. Afterwards I was so
struck I was almost in tears,  and many of those with whom I shared
glances had the same stricken look.  In retrospect,  I recognize the
feeling palpable in that place after his reading as the death-feeling,
the same feeling there was in the house when my father was dying, that
larger-than-life bitter flavor of simplicity and depth.

After the reading he signed books graciously for a long line of
people.

I waited till they were all through to speak with him; I had just
moved to Maine,  a place we loved in common and had talked about
before,  and I wanted to share that.  He signed my books very
carefully,  deliberately placing a black dot in the upper-left hand
box of four boxes in the publisher's logo on one title page.   Then we
talked for a long time,  me awkwardly half-kneeling in front of the
book-table.  We talked about Maine and, since he was staying in Marfa,
Texas,about the minimalist sculpture of my ex=brother-in-law, Donald
Judd. He was scathing about the inhumanity he saw in Judd's metal
boxes,how incongruous he felt they were in the desert landscape,and
we both shared our visceral response at their lack of effort to
harmonize or blend in.  I asked him how he understood Judd's
intentions,  and he said something very helpful, which cleared up a
question that had burdened me for a long time: he said he thought of
it as a belated Romantic attempt to assert human presence.

After we discussed various other things, we talked about how we would
see each other in Maine in the summer.  I remember feeling that it
might not happen.  We said goodbye,  but I turned back on a very
strong impulse to ask him about one more thing rather than putting it
off:  I asked him about Robert Duncan.  He told me movingly about
Duncan's warmth,  compassion--told about how once he had been walking
with Duncan and telling him about problems with his marriage, and
looked over to see tears on Duncan's face.  You would have liked him,
he said. He looked tired. We touched hands again.  "Till Maine," he
said.

I am now so glad I turned back. I'm also glad that last July, in
Orono, I spoke with him about something even more urgent I wanted to
discuss before it was too late.  I mentioned to him how people were
continually quoting as a truism only the first half of his famous
dictum,  "Form is nothing more than an extension of content, and
content nothing more than an extension of form."  He was very
disturbed by this and said that the quote was not meaningful without
both halves.  I asked him if he would send me an email stating this,
so that I would have it in writing from him,  and could quote it
honestly/accurately,  and he told me that in fact, he had just put in
writing in a recent interview.  Soon after, he sent me this email:

Dear Annie,

Now I hear you've taken the job,  which is terrific for "our side."
Thinking of that "form" business,  what I was thinking of then was
this comment in an interview with Leonard Schwartz:

  http://jacketmagazine.com/25/creeley-iv.html

  It's there pretty much at the beginning.

  I can feel fall today,  and somehow that's a pleasure -- just the
sharpness of air, and the extrardinary specificness of color.  Ah well!

Again congratulations and all best,

Bob


This is the quote from the interview he was referring to:

  RC: Well,  content is never more than an extension of form and form
is never more than an extension of content. They sort of go together,
is the absolute point. It's really hard to think of one without the
other; in fact, I don't think it's possible.



  That's it.  Ah well!

  --Annie Finch

In all the welcome words about Bob Creeley lately,
there have at least been two times that someone mentioned
that in a recent reading Creeley was sitting. As if that
was related, I mean, to his health/age. I first heard him
read in 1961 or 1962, and heard him lots of times in various
cities after that, and I can't remember whether I ever
saw him standing up to do a reading. He may have, but all
my visual memories show him seated in many places.
Does anyone remember seeing him read standing up?

Oh no. I thought it had been pretty well settled that modern poetry
was not expression. Is it expression now? If it is, I will go back and
read Pound and Olson.

I saw Creeley give a reading at New College of California back around
1990 or 1991, and he was definitely standing up -- and upstanding --
throughout.

W A N T E D :
Do you write on the job?
Are you worried about
getting caught?  Does
your worry about get-
ting caught affect the
form of your writing?
Does your job affect
your poetry's content?
Has poetry, on your
job, influenced your
job, your coworkers,
or even your field?
Have you used your
poetic sense to imple-
ment changes in the
workplace, labor rel-
ations, etc.? Have
you ever chosen a
job because you
knew you would
get good poetry
out of it?  Would
you consider employ-
ing your present job
for a poetic good?

In 1930, in the New Masses, Michael Gold proposed the following:

"that every writer in the group attach himself to one of the industries.
That he spend the next few years in and out of this industry, studying it
from every angle, making himself an expert in it, so that when he writes of
it he will write like an insider, not like a bourgeois intellectual
observer."

Though we have no proposed "group" in mind, nor any fixed idea what this
project might yield, we find Gold's basic idea as compelling today as it
must have been then.  Rather than necessarily "studying" work, however, we
encourage poets to re-appropriate work as an engine of poetic
in(ter)vention.  We are not necessarily motivating people toward any
particular political end (though we don't, of course, rule that out); nor
do we ask poets to address work necessarily in a Marxian framework, if
perchance you should have other inclinations.  We simply hope to "exploit,"
or rather mobilize, the poetic labor of what Gold terms insiders.  Is it
time to think of our selves as secret agents?  We are happy to let you
decide for yourself the form your assignment takes.

WANTED, Have you
considered working as
a collections agent at,
say, the Harry Fox
Agency, busting kids
& rappers for fair use
of music samples?
Are you interested
in doing poetic re-
search on the music
industry as it fights to
cling to its money-
base as (ostensibly)
a bunch of teenagers
work to circumvent
their efforts?  Are you
worried the work in a
position like this one
would be awful?  Will
you lose your indie
cred? Do you believe
one is implicated in
the larger, indirect,
moral and ethical
effects of what one
does for a living?
Even if one cannot
get another job?
Can poetic interven-
tion subvert that?

In Acts of Resistance: Against the Tyranny of the Market, Pierre Bourdieu,
speaking of what he calls "the insecurity-inducing strategies" of
transnational corporations, argues that we must reframe our demands
regarding labor.  We must "break away from the logic of past struggles," he
writes, "which, being based on the demand for work and for better pay for
work, trap [us] within work and within the exploitation (or flexploitation)
which accompanies it" (86).  Darwin believed flexibility in the face of
chance and constant change was the key to survival. How can we, through
poetic actions, bend the laboring society to our own needs, so that we
survive not only as poets but as citizens?  How can poetry help us rethink
work's place in our society and our lives?

During the 1930s, writers like Gold made an effort to put poetry and the
workplace in dialogue.  We often hear comparisons made today between the
presidency of Herbert Hoover and George W. Bush.  Not since Hoover has a
president had a worse job creation record.  How might we translate Gold's
revolutionary ambitions to our current postindustrial, panoptic milieu? Can
the formal inventiveness of avant-garde poetry help us re-think work?  We
find antecedents in the writings of Williams and Stevens, Reznikoff and
Niedecker, and more recently Kit Robinson and Juliana Spahr, to name but a
few.  As poets, how do we respond at the daily level to the globalization
of what Hannah Arendt calls "the laboring society"?

Wanted, Operations.
Are you plugged in
all day, typing the
same codes over
and over?  Do you
sometimes feel as if
your job is rewiring
your brain?  Do you
find yourself making
non-sense words
out of the codes
just to pass the time,
or to exercise the
brain in opposition to
such fixity?

We are soliciting only new work.  Submissions can come in whatever form you
feel best exemplifies what the above statements have to do with your
situation.  Submissions may come in many possible forms:  1) poems created
on, in or around work situations as described above, 2) statements,
analyses or narrations of the relationship your work and poetry have had on
each other, 3) spoofs on office documents, 4) confessions of the secret
evils of your workplace, 5) documentary facts of worker abuse, worker
success, worker surrealism, etc.  We hope to receive a wide range of
interpretations of our ideas as laid out here.

Dear All,

Shearsman Books has just published =Paradise for Everyone=,
a book of poems with a lovely front cover image by Gerhard Richter.

On the back cover Lyn Hejinian writes:
"The wonderful poems in Lisa Samuels's =Paradise for Everyone=
have about them the alertness and vivacity that belong to the world of
the newly discovered (and the newly discovering). It is Samuels's
great gift that she can find realities anew at every phrase, and her own
position among them curious. She examines distinctions -- the features
that make things different. She makes certain (however briefly)
that what she cares about still exists. She reminds us, her readers, that
anything that can recur is amazing. This is a deeply intelligent and lovely
book -- a book of encounters that may also serve as a manual for
encountering."

AMONG THE NAMES, poems by Maxine Chernoff

published by Apogee Press

Anselm Kiefer cover

"Maxine Chernoff's wide-ranging study of 'the gift' employs humor, social
commentary, and nuanced meditation.  AMONG THE NAMES suggests poetry as a
vehicle for ethics--not in the sense of proscribing moral virtue, but as a
mode of experience in which acuteness of perception can model both
compassion and sharp critique.  Chernoff is an alchemically subtle reader
of human economies."  Elizabeth Robinson

The Accompanied Library Presents–

The Second Evening in the First Annual Poetry Series
"A Civilized Sunday"
of Poetry, Tea & Scones (& Libations)

Featuring readers Bill Zavatsky and Andrew McCarron
Sunday, April 3rd, 6PM
$6 at the door (non-members)
Wine with the poets to follow


The Accompanied Library, recently voted the city's "Best Private
Club" by New York Magazine, presents an exciting new series of
readings– full of poetry urbane and hilarious, sophisticated and
moving– to include readers from Billy Collins to  John Ashbery
to Eileen Myles. Following on the heels of a wildly successful first
evening, this Sunday poets Bill Zavatsky and Andrew McCarron
read in the Library's gorgeous, intimate space within the
National Arts Club.


ANDREW McCARRON was born and raised in the Hudson River Valley.  He
was educated at Bard College and Harvard Divinity School.  At Bard
College, he studied poetry under John Ashbery, whose work inspired
him to begin writing.  He currently lives in Manhattan and teaches
Religion and English at Trinity School, and a member of the
Language and Thinking faculty at Bard College.  He is also the poet
in residence at the Accompanied Library at the National Arts Club.
 His poetry has most recently appeared in the Hudson Review.

BILL ZAVATSKY, born and raised in Bridgeport, Connecticut, has lived
in New York City since 1965. He has published one collection of
poems, Theories of Rain and Other Poems, and one chapbook, For
Steve Royal and Other Poems. He translated The Poems of A. O.
Barnabooth by Valery Larbaud with Ron Padgett, and his translations
of Robert Desnos appear in The Random House Book of Twentieth
Century French Poetry. His co-translation of Earthlight: Poems by
André Breton, with Zack Rogow, won the PEN/Book-of-the-Month
Translation Prize in 1993.  Bill Zavatsky has taught English at the
Trinity School in Manhattan since 1987.

They hang the man and flog the woman
That steal the goose from off the common,
But let the greater villain loose
That steals the common from the goose.

".....at a time when I am speaking to you about the paradox of desire -- in
the
sense that different goods obscure it -- you can hear outside the awful
language
of power.  There's no point in asking whether they are sincere or
hypocritical,
whether they want peace of whether they calculate the risks.  The dominating
impression as such a moment is that something that may pass for a prescribed
good; information addresses and captures impotent crowds to whom it is poured

forth like a liquor that leaves them dazed as they move toward the slaughter
house.
One might even ask if one would allow the cataclysm to occur without first
giving
free reign to this hubbub of voices...."

We all got together for a reading in Lowell Sunday. Despite temps in the =
70s and
not a cloud in the sky, turnout was good--most every seat was filled. =
Thanks to
an effort to invigorate poetry programs in Lowell (at least those =
sponsored by
the Lowell Poetry Network), the readers each left with a check for $50.

this flicker in the spring awashed
where the source is aflown within hard grain
i eat nasty platter
hastily beg-a-pardning down/stair
trummeling in the low end
a flame watering itself instant of chinhicsawn  -  a crimsical weightin
in narrows and concentric pathways we ups 'n downs
traffic & unwritten fluids         ounces of sand we see in
sense of twisting the wood to make a frame
unfurling the wire to cause friction
brush the brittleness to bring resolution
a gripping grin
the pool the wax forms    (flame swum sank)
moves a reflection weightless moves

how does movement move itself?
the wind in the mouth makes melodies of shirts
& great small winds move the thing  whose reflection is-a-move
a flicker in the spring
ringing
land & nadlop
patched walls & storybooks
teak trifes and rubmahs &
missles  &  can't-i-leave-hers

elegant combs sweep the bottled falls
& sweat sparkles off the nodtarp as easy as an unconditioned bill

see yourself again in the gathering granules
a face greenwashed like a george at a crossing
a john @ a window
painted flatter n bricklines & steampipes
on a chrice-amighty-true-spring   nite.

speak from your pulpit of intentions
while the wind moves things
the wind that moves things
that moves things
moves things
moves

saw bob read  more times tha i can count sitting if it was a small space

but for the most part standing

anyway

what is a poem?

this metal in my ear
this clapping weary luckbearer
this finder of clicks
to a jack-of-all-traders
outpostologue packaging open
to the quick
its world name is i & other is
us but in things.

what is a solicited poem unsolicited

who determines this?

are there folks on the list  who are specifically asked to put poems on
list/


please explain how this works    thanks

Legislation is another powerful weapon for =A0the mass destruction of knowl=

March 20, 2005 - Vinita Ramani and Julian Samuel discuss Save and Burn.

=A0

VR: Broadly-speaking, 'The Library in Crisis' dealt with bibliocide (a term=
=20
used by Ian McLachlan) and the increasing digitisation of texts - in a sens=
e,=20
the "crises" referred to in the title. 'Save and Burn' has honed in on a mo=
re=20
specific issue: the systematic preservation and destruction of knowledge/te=
xts.=20
What do you see as the trajectory from the first documentary to the second?

=A0

JS: I didn't plan a trajectory, but there is a trajectory which I'll tell y=
ou=20
about a few lines down...I write a documentary treatment after reading many=
=20
books on a particular subject and then approach funders. After a few reject=
ions=20
I get a tiny budget on which to live and produce.

VR: So then do you at see documentary films having some effect on our=20
understanding of history and politics?

=A0

JS: Documentaries, on their own, accomplish nothing politically; they recor=
d=20
symptoms. If they could change an understanding of reality, and how to act,=
=20
then why haven't they had any large-scale progressive effect on society?=20
Despite the making of many critical documentaries, the economic right and t=
he=20
religious right are hitting us in coercive ways. Rent control and the Magna=
=20
Carta all down the drain, and it's all Michael Moore's fault.

=A0

VR: There's an intellectual density in both your documentaries that is quit=
e=20
different or lacking in the new wave of "activist" films that have emerged=
=20
off-late (since 2000 and the WTO protests, in particular).

=A0

JS: Someone has to make dense documentaries - otherwise we'd all be making=
=20
documentaries like The Corporation, Bowling for Columbine et al ad naseum w=
hich=20
are visually fun, easy and comic, but analytically as deep as a fried Mars =
Bar.=20
The directors offers no criticism of Caterpillar Corp and its support of=20
Israel, for instance.

=A0

VR: While you hint at the great intellectual traditions of Asia and Africa,=
 the=20
documentary is very much focused on libraries in Europe, or the "west".

=A0

JS: Sadly, much is missing from Save and Burn (2004). My excuse is that the=
y=20
didn't give me much money. It would have been useful to have included in-de=
pth=20
discussions from other parts of the world such as Africa, Asia, libraries i=
n=20
the Arctic and Antarctica. This would have filled in all the geo-bibliograp=
hic=20
holes. And, it would have been great to shoot all the pretty books in=20
grain-less 35mm. A visual exploration (in IMAX) of the 13th century wood=20
printing blocks at the The Temple of Haeinsa would have been enriching.

=A0

However, I think that with Save and Burn I have provided classical linkages=
=20
between the master races and the others: England and Ireland; Palestine and=
=20
America; America and Iraq. I have not explored the role between libraries i=
n=20
the Mediterranean region and their impact on the development of this one-si=
ded=20
democracy in Europe. The documentary makes the links between empire and=20
knowledge institutions apparent. The trajectory from Save and Burn is now a=
=20
documentary on Atheism. Will George Soras please help me? I only want a=20
millionth of his wealth.

=A0

VR: Alistair Black (Leeds Metropolitan University) and John Feather identif=
y=20
the specific relationship between libraries and the advent of modernity, in=
 how=20
the growth of the individual or "self" was integral to the Enlightenment=20
project. But Black identifies the controlling aspects of libraries as well:=
=20
they are bureaucracies par excellence. This is a tension present throughout=
 the=20
film (freedom and control in relation to knowledge). Is this a specifically=
=20
western experience?

=A0

JS: Modernity? What's that? Save and Burn's slowly leads us to the followin=
g=20
kinds of question: Is western democracy falling apart in the eyes of everyo=
ne=20
else? Western democracy - with its legal trade rules and legally sanctioned=
=20
moral values in place - is transparently terrorizing resources out of vast=
=20
areas of the world.

=A0

Lefty documentary film-makers try to get answers from experts in order to=
=20
produce an abridged yet wide version of history and politics. And,=20
unfortunately, documentaries produce culturalists who know the world's prob=
lems=20
but can only vote in a certain way; go to demonstrations; have political=20
discussions at supper time, and buy samosas on solidarity nights. I won't p=
ut=20
you in a cultural studies coma by doing a Chomskian repetition of what's wr=
ong=20
with the world, don't worry.

=A0

VR: Save and Burn also touches upon contrasts/tensions in relation to=20
perceptions of class and access to knowledge. Alistair Black is sceptical o=
f=20
the claim that the working classes benefited from libraries: he says they w=
ere=20
rarely the constituency that used libraries. You juxtapose this with Irish=
=20
author Declan Kiberd's resoundingly positive perception that libraries for =
the=20
Irish, were and are almost utopian spaces, following the 19th century readi=
ng=20
room tradition, where issues in the community can be debated, read about,=
=20
shared. What is the intention of these juxtapositions?

=A0

JS: It would appear that I have a sociological reflex - inducted during=20
schooling.

=A0

VR: Nevertheless, the humour aside, you are suggesting something with these=
=20
recurring discussions on freedom, democracy and accesss to knowledge.

=A0

JS: What's the conclusion? Libraries actually produce a knowledge of how to=
=20
practice democracy at home and export terror abroad; this is one obvious,=
=20
preliminary conclusion. The current-day British labour party members all ha=
ve a=20
knowledge of social democracy because of the libraries they used - packed t=
o=20
the gills with English Marxism and even more flashy Euro-Marxism. Many of t=
hem=20
were arrested for protesting during the last century.

=A0

The center of the documentary are the comments on the catalogue. The librar=
y=20
catalogue controls access to sections of knowledge. The techno-culturalist =
and=20
historical discussion in the beginning of Save and Burn takes us to the=20
destruction of the library catalogue in Palestine. Here, western democracy=
=20
falls to bits. The, Palestinians, as people everywhere, see through western=
=20
democracy's terror-laden values.

=A0

VR: Save and Burn also reveals a strong relationship between history and=20
libraries. Alarmingly, we can no longer speak of historiography if, as Tom=
=20
Twiss (Govt. Information Librarian, Pittsburgh), Isam al Khafaji (ex-adviso=
r to=20
US forces in Iraq) and Erling Bergan collectively identify how Iraqi=20
libraries/museums are being systematically burnt and destroyed, books are n=
ot=20
reaching Palestinian libraries. History is being altered by what is saved a=
nd=20
what is burnt. What is the future then, from your perspective? How does one=
=20
respond to these "cultural war crimes" as Ross Shimmon points out?

=A0

JS: The future? Most documentary film-makers are non-experts who are in one=
 way=20
or another looking for answers to advance a general knowledge which will le=
ad=20
to criticism, action, Eden. Viewers should understand that film-makers put=
=20
viewers in the precarious position of trusting the film-maker who usually a=
re=20
non-experts in the areas they are documenting. The questions encompassed by=
=20
Save and Burn are posed by a non-expert. I have tried to offer in-depth=20
knowledge of libraries across many voices.

=A0

The conclusion of the documentary asks: Western democracies are encouraging=
=20
Israel and other places (via innocent tax payers in Austin, Warlingham, and=
=20
Canberra) to do one illegal thing after the next. The mad search for weapon=
s of=20
mass hypnosis is like the search for God itself. Many people at the other e=
nd=20
of American foreign policy see nothing "western" nor "democratic" but see=
=20
hypocrisy personified in various heads of states. You should have heard the=
=20
analysis the shoe-shine man in Cairo gave me about 911.

=A0

So what political models can 'they' out there look for? Can they make an=20
economically competitive state via an investment in Islamic or non-western=
=20
values? More questions for an expert. The idea of investing in western=20
democratic values is exhausted, not simply because western democracy is so =
easy=20
to see through but because democracy, give or take a Patriot Act or two, is=
=20
structured fundamentally to supply a bit of democracy at home while fully=
=20
financing dictators and their armies the world over.

A film review by Steve Fesenmaier

published: http://www.counterpunch.org/fesenmaier10022004.html

=A0

There is no document of civilization which is not at the same time a docume=

m=20
taints also the manner in which it was transmitted from one owner to anothe=

=A0

Julian Samuel, a Montreal-based filmmaker born in Pakistan, continues his=
=20
exploration of the contemporary world of libraries in this 80-minute=20
documentary. He first investigated libraries in his instant library classic=
,=20
=93The Library in Crisis.=94 Here is the description from the distributor=
=92s website=20
=96 Filmakers Library =96

=A0

Dense with the informed commentary of notable scholars, this documentary in=
=20
effect traces the history of civilization through the phenomenon of the=20
library. From ancient China, India, Islam, and the Graeco Roman world, we s=
ee=20
how the library radiated knowledge and spiritual values, and facilitated th=
e=20
cross fertilization of ideas from one culture to another.

http://filmakers.com/indivs/LibraryCrisis.htm

=A0

=93Crisis=94 was made before 9/11 and focuses on the hottest crises at that=
 time =96=20
the effects the WTO may have on libraries, the commercialization of librari=
es,=20
mindless weeding and closing of libraries, expansion of copyright by comput=
er=20
corporations, and much more. No film I have ever seen on libraries comes cl=
ose=20
in exploring so much in such a short period of time =96 46 minutes.

=A0

I contacted the filmmaker in Canada, and sent him videotapes of interviews =
with=20
leading American library activist Sanford Berman. Originally, he was going =
to=20
interview Sandy and other American library leaders, but after the draconian=
 war=20
against people from Pakistan and other East Asian countries by the Bush=20
Administration after 9/11, Samuel took the official Canadian advice to NOT=
=20
cross the border. Thus this film did not include these voices =96 but rathe=
r=20
focused on Irish and English libraries plus the new Bibliotheca Alexandrina

=A0

Unlike =93The Library in Crisis,=94 this film looks at race and class. Vari=
ous=20
library historians including John Feather, Professor of Library & Informati=
on=20
Studies, Loughborough University, author of =93The Information Society,=94 =
Royal=20
Society of Arts, London and Alistair Black, Professor of Library History, L=
eeds=20
Metropolitan=A0University, London discuss how public libraries were used bo=
th to=20
stop the locals from contemplating revolution a la Russian Communism during=
 and=20
after WWI and to serve as a place for debate. By cutting back and forth fro=
m=20
Irish and English library events to the history of the Library of Alexandri=
a,=20
Egyptian public libraries, and current programs in the Bibliotheca Alexandr=
ina,=20
like one on unemployment and youth, the viewer is counter-conditioned to re=
ject=20
Western racism. Samuel wants to show the West that we are the inheritors of=
 the=20
great Arab-Asian tradition of libraries going back thousands of years =96 n=
ot its=20
enemy.

=A0

The facts are piled on, not using the standard Ken Burns-style of slow=20
discourse, but rather throwing the facts at us, using optical printing, aim=
ing=20
to create a much more complicated GESTALT in our minds. This is extremely=
=20
refreshing to someone who has watched a thousand such films, and found them=
=20
boring. His style is more like the Hong Kong master Wong Kar-wai or Godard,=
=20
demanding that the viewer has a universe of images already in his mind, wai=
ting=20
for someone to link them together in new ways.

=A0

Like all serious intellectuals, Samuel begins with Walter Benjamin, the=20
cornerstone of post-WWII global analysis. By doing this he shows right from=
 the=20
beginning that he is not guilty of anti-Semitism and Arab fanaticism. He sh=
ows=20
that he really wants truth and justice, at whatever cost. He wants to show =
that=20
libraries have been one of the few places of truth and justice for a long t=
ime,=20
and that there are really only two kinds of people =96 those who respect su=
ch=20
sacred places and those who do not.

=A0

The visual images of the libraries he shows are exquisite, lingering on the=
=20
walls, the books, the people, and the spaces that libraries have used over =
the=20
centuries. He is a painter, an artist =96 as well as a philosopher, histori=
an,=20
and freedom fighter. Ambassador=A0Taher Khalifa, Director of The Bibliothec=
a=20
Alexandrina talks about the shapes of the library =96 using an incomplete s=
un=20
disk, the earth, a moon, the sea, and alphabets from all over the world, no=
ne=20
making a single sentence.

=A0

I found one scene particularly positive, given the ocean of negative images=
=20
flooding us now. A young Arab man reads from =93Dubliners=94 in front of th=
e James=20
Joyce Wall in Dublin -in his native tongue. This brief scene may be the=20
clearest direct message Samuel is trying to make =96 we are all one people,=
=20
friends, not enemies.

=A0

This film notes a key historical possibility that I very much believe in =
=96 and=20
that is that if the great world of the original Alexandrine Library had bee=
n=20
allowed to continue, our world would have been much better, and mankind wou=
ld=20
have landed on the moon by 1000 AD. There is a new field of alternative=20
histories, including Philip Roth=92s new book, =93The Plot Against America,=
" about=20
a US with a Nazi Charles Lindbergh as president. Samuel has a text crawl th=
at=20
states that there was one other time when there was a possibility of a=20
=93brilliant scientific civilization=94 =96 the 700 years of the first Alex=
andrine=20
Library under the Greeks, and he notes that most of the Old Testament comes=
 to=20
us from items once found in that library. Apparently he believes, as I do, =
that=20
if mankind had channeled its energy into the arts and sciences rather than =
war=20
at the time of the world=92s greatest library, our world would now be a=20
humanistic paradise rather than a toxic corporate American hell.

=A0

During the last half of the film he interviews Tom Twiss, Government=20
Information Librarian, University of Pittsburgh, who has flown to Canada fo=
r=20
the interview. During the next 30 minutes Twiss discusses the war against=
=20
people=92s access to federal government information, pointing out that as o=
ur=20
government has limited our access to them, they have increased their access=
 to=20
us =96 library patrons- under the Patriot Act. Twiss is also an expert on t=
he=20
destruction of Palestinian libraries. He talks about what happened to=20
Palestinian libraries during an Israeli invasion of the West Bank. He point=
s=20
out that Lutheran libraries were also attacked without any reaction worldwi=
de =96=20
but that there is ample proof of the events. He notes that some Israeli=20
newspapers even ran editorials about the =93cultural cleansing=94 but many =
Israelis=20
deny it even happened. One gruesome story he gives is about the Israelis ta=
king=20
books ordered by Palestinian libraries being shipped to Palestinian=20
libraries=A0being seized and shipped to Israeli libraries instead.

=A0

Another expert on the reality of libraries in Palestine is Erling Bergan,=
=20
Editor, Librarians Union of Norway, Oslo, who talks about the destruction o=
f=20
their libraries, and a tour by international librarians to these libraries,=
=20
seeing first hand how much the children use them. He discusses one particul=
ar=20
act of destruction involving The Orient House. Bergan is like one of the=20
thousands of Jewish Holocaust=A0survivors one has seen in films about Nazi=
=20
Germany. (I have programmed the local Jewish film series for 25 years), sha=
king=20
his head in disbelief. Sanford Berman is the inventor of a word that should=
=20
have been uttered =96 bibliocide. ( Ian McLachlan uses this word=A0in Samue=
l=92s=20
earlier film, =93The Library in Crisis.)=A0Some librarians even use the ter=
m=20
=93biblio-holocaust=94 for the destruction of books in our modern age.

=A0

Finally, the destruction of Iraqi libraries is discussed, mainly by Ross=20
Shimmon, Secretary General, International Federation of Library Association=
s=20
and Institutions and Isam al Khafaji, ex-advisor to USA forces in Iraq. Kha=
faji=20
discusses who destroyed the books, and how important they still are in the =
life=20
of war-worn Iraqis. Shimmon talks about writing letters to Saddam and Blair=
=20
requesting that they protect Iraqi libraries during the coming war.

=A0

The final comments in the film are by=A0=A0Khafaji. Earlier in the film pic=
tures of=20
Iraqi libraries that have been burned are shown, giving the viewer the reas=
on=20
why this film is called =93Save and Burn.=94 It=92s horrific to see the roo=
ms of=20
ashes, and reflect on the eternal loss the millions of Iraqis have endured =
as=20
pawns in the game between the Arab fanatics and the America extremists =96 =
now in=20
control. I had to recall the ashes from =93The Day After,=94 showing a worl=
d=20
incinerated by men of equal sadism.

=A0

Samuel has again created a masterpiece about the contemporary library. I=20
suggest that it be included with the many Arab Film Festivals that have bee=
n=20
created by thoughtful people around the world since 9/11. As always, non-Ar=
abs=20
and Arabs will discover that they have much more in common than they realiz=
e =96=20
and that they are brothers and sisters, not enemies. All librarians should =
see=20
this film, and I am sure they will feel like I do that librarians must leav=
e=20
their beautiful houses of culture, and join the fight to protect them from =
the=20
despots East and West who will eventually destroy them. One librarian talks=
=20
about how the Book of Kells was protected from the invading English, being=
=20
moved from site to site, even in a building used by the invaders as a=20
headquarters.

=A0

A very good companion book to read is Matthew Battles recent, =93Libraries=
=A0-An=20
Unquiet History.=94 I read it two summers ago on a porch near Wilmington, N=
orth=20
Carolina, smoking and sitting under a semi-functioning ceiling fan with my =
dog.=20
I took my time and savored the amazing history Mr. Battles has written, tak=
ing=20
a global perspective somewhat akin to Mr. Samuel=92s. I was very impressed =
with=20
his brief history of libraries in China and England, and consider his accou=
nt=20
of the war against my friend Sanford Berman to be the best in any book I ha=
ve=20
read so far.

=A0

There is a brief discussion of =93libricide=94 in this film =96 and now the=
re is an=20
excellent book on the subject =96 and now there is an excellent book on the=
=20
subject =96 =93Libricide: The Regime-Sponsored Destruction of Books and Lib=
raries=20
in the Twentieth Century=94 by Rebecca Knuth. It looks at five particular c=
ases=A0-=20
Germany, Bosnia, Kuwait, China and Tibet. Of course it doesn=92t mention th=
e=20
uncontrolled =93weeding=94 of American libraries during the last decade, mo=

famously in San Francisco where thousands of books were buried in a landfil=

this flicker in the spring awashed
where the source is aflown within  hard grain
i eat nasty platter
hastily beg-a-pardning  down/stair
trummeling in the low end
a flame watering itself instant of  chinhicsawn  -  a crimsical weightin
in narrows and concentric  pathways we ups 'n downs
traffic & unwritten  fluids         ounces of sand we see  in
sense of twisting the wood to make a frame
unfurling the wire to cause  friction
brush the brittleness to bring resolution

the  pool the wax forms    (flame swum sank)
moves a reflection  weightless moves

how does movement move itself?
the wind in the mouth makes melodies of  shirts
& great small winds move the thing  whose reflection  is-a-move
a flicker in the spring
ringing
land & nadlop
patched  walls & storybooks
teak trifes and rubmahs &

elegant combs sweep the bottled falls
& sweat sparkles off the  nodtarp as easy as an unconditioned bill

see yourself again in the gathering granules
a face greenwashed like a  george at a crossing
a john @ a window
painted flatter n bricklines &  steampipes
on a chrice-amighty-true-spring   nite.

Well, not so much "expression" as "blurt".

The market has rewarded certain artforms and movements because of superior
marketing. If you look at the movements in Visual Art, Fiction and Film that
have been good at marketing themselves to a wider audience beginning with
Abstract Expressionism and the Beats in the 1950's and the various movements
in the 60's and 70's Pop Art et cetera they were all built around strong
personalities and a market for the work whether it was visual art, fiction
or film. This strong marketing focus led to the growth of these artforms and
they had an impact on the wider culture.

Poetry in the US has never had a large audience but if you look at the poets
who have sold the most books, apart from Jewel, Maya Angelou, and Jimmy
Stewart (Yes the actor) no poetry book according to Publisher's Weekly has
sold more than 50,000 copies. The biggest sellers have been  in fact poets
focused on a particular community;Jewel, Maya Angelou, Kathleen Norris
(Cloister Walk), and Rumi (Coleman Barks). I applaud these poets for
realizing that they can sell books to a niche audience and have some sort of
impact but all poets, be they academics, business man poets, or whatever
should strive to have their work read by non-poets and by a wider audience
and poetry publishers do a terrible job of bringing the work to these
audiences and perhaps one of the reasons this is the case is the quote from
Eric's post

"But, the days of making

The current US poetry community is a closed circle with poets, publishing
poets selling to poets and being read by poet.
It is important to realize that Art is Art and Commerce is Commerce but it
is at the nexus where they meet that the art moves into the larger culture
this may sound like business but the fact is that every artform in the world
functions with this structure except poetry and it is perplexing why this
is? Perhaps it is a combination of poets who want to be artists while
neglecting the wider audience, or the fact that unlike visual art and
fiction poetry does not have a strong critical structure that pushes the
artform to a wider audience or the fact that so many of our poetic
luminaries dwell in academia and hence do not need to market their work to
survive but this is the status of poetry in this culture. Most poetry never
makes it to this nexus not because people are stupid or that poets are pure
but because poetry is not marketed very well and we as an artform have
retreated into the comfortable place where all poetry book reviews are good
reviews, where publishers want to "support the poet" rather than challenge
and edit the poet's work, and where poetry does not force the wider culture
to listen to what we are saying.

Art exhibit featuring Bush stamp probed
=A0
By TARA BURGHART
ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER
=A0
=A0=A0
=A0 An artwork containing mock 37-cent stamps showing President Bush =
with=20
a revolver pointed at his head is part of an exhibit at Columbia=20
College's Glass Curtain Gallery titled "Axis of Evil, the Secret=20
History of Sin" Tuesday, April, 12, 2005 in Chicago. The exhibit=20
captured the attention of the Secret Service who sent agents to inspect=20=

the works last week according to gallery officials. (AP Photo/M.=20

  CHICAGO -- The Secret Service sent agents to investigate a college art=20=

gallery exhibit of mock postage stamps, one depicting President Bush=20
with a gun pointed at his head.
=A0
The exhibit, called "Axis of Evil: The Secret History of Sin," opened=20
last week at Columbia College in Chicago. It features stamps designed=20
by 47 artists addressing issues such as the Roman Catholic sex abuse=20
scandal, racism and the war in Iraq.
=A0
None of the artists is tied to the college.
=A0
Secret Service spokesman Tom Mazur would not say Tuesday whether the=20
inquiry had been completed or whom the Secret Service had interviewed,=20=

but he said no artwork had been confiscated.
=A0
The investigation began after authorities received a call from a=20
Chicago resident.
=A0
"We need to ensure, as best we can, that this is nothing more than=20
artwork with a political statement," Mazur said.
=A0
Two federal agents arrived at the exhibit's opening night Thursday,=20
took photos of some of the works and asked for the artists' contact=20
information, said CarolAnn Brown, the gallery's director.
=A0
Brown said the agents were most interested in Chicago artist Al=20
Brandtner's work titled "Patriot Act," which depicted a sheet of mock=20
37-cent red, white and blue stamps showing a revolver pointed at Bush's=20=

head.
=A0
Brandtner did not return a call to his design studio Tuesday.
=A0
The exhibit's curator, Michael Hernandez de Luna, said the inquiry=20
"frightens" him.
=A0
"It starts questioning all rights, not only my rights or the artists'=20
rights in this room, but questioning the rights of any artist who=20
creates - any writer, any visual artist, any performance artist. It=20
seems like we're being watched," he said.
=A0
Last spring, Secret Service agents in Washington state questioned a=20
high school student about anti-war drawings he did for an art class,=20
one of which depicted Bush's head on a stick.

or how to express expression without oppression under the influence of
espresso


from: to press (squeeze, force, compel, act upon with weight, print)

express (v): to directly, explicitly, unmistakably, unambiguously, exactly,
precisely
STATE, UTTER, DECLARE - in other words, use words to communicate,  create text
to force out by pressure like juice or coffee - in other words,  create
beverages

express (n): an exact image or representation
a MANIFESTATION,  EXPRESSION, UTTERANCE, DECLARATION
DISPATCH (pony express, express train,  express service)

Here might be George Bowering & others' objectionable  connotation:

make, depict, resemble or offer a representation, copy, likeness;
to  represent by SIGN or SYMBOL; to symbolize

BLURT is good too. Whether we paint with words, spit them, think them  or
write them, they are unavoidably an expression-manifestation though not  always
symbolic, unless you want to say that all words are symbols which also  may be
unavoidable.

This evening the Portable Reading & Lecture series will be hosting a Creele=
y Memorial Reading in Baltimore. I have pressed some pamphlets which includ=
es Creeley "Desultory Days" poem. I am having everyone at the reading sign =
it and would like to send it to Bob's family, but I have no contact informa=
tion.

Could someone send me a physical address?=20

Thanks much,

Living, Will You


If I am incapacitated and my eyes no longer wander across your body, no
longer look into yours, kill me.

If I am in numbing pain, and looking into your eyes, and cannot speak, and
you will know, I cannot think, kill me.

If I am to be sent to an old age home, that concentration-camp portal into
death, kill me, do not force a waiting.

If I am useless, can no longer work or think, kill me, and if my work is
poor or repetitive, and I do not know, and I struggle uselessly, kill me
as well.

If I cannot control my body or its functions, if you are disgusted, if you
are living in sad memories, kill me, let the memories lives.

If you must watch the slow consuming havoc of cancer, the spread of body
against body, as we have all watched, kill me, I would not contaminate the
living.

If the world turns fascist to a greater degree, if you hear the final
knock at the door, kill me; know I will not be able to withstand.

If I beg you, kill me, without that flat dry voice when the world
dissolves for one last and silent time, kill me.

And if you tire of me, if the world tires, if I am pest or nuisance, if I
am cornered thing, or spectacle, or antiquated and irrelevant, of course
kill me, of course kill me.

I don't know if I would judge it quite that way, George. Projective
verse is still safe if Mary believes that "One BLURT leads, immediately
and inexorably, to another BLURT."

After all, a BLURT is measured by Breath to a significant extent.

Several comments i'd like to make after these posts.

1) Don't forget not to lump experimental film under "Film."=20
Experimental film THRIVES on the margin, which makes it=20
non-monolithic, and non-commericial.  Just like certain=20
strains/lineages of poetry/writing, it is split off from the=20
more highly marketed work, i.e. Hollywood and Indywood, with a=20
different economy of ideas and influences, and a community that=20
is in many ways similar to the one for poetry.

2) I *really* appreciate what Eric wrote about the relations=20
between patterns, markets, self, mind and form.  I think he=20
really hit the nail on the head with those remarks.  The VALUE=20
of swimming upstream (against habitual thought) is what rests in=20
'experimental' work -- which is only so labeled from a point of=20
view outside its practice, i.e. the normative mainstream, rarely=20
so by its practioners.  That value is preserved at the margins.=20
There are breakthroughs and dead ends.  There are=20
appropriations, rip-offs, sell-outs and success stories of=20
people working in this mode, usually seen as R&D by industry=20
vultures.

3) What is the 'wider audience' that Haas advocates reaching?=20
Or rather who are the individuals who comprise it?  I would=20
suggest a good bet is in looking to other arts communities=20
that share this value system of trying to move past or through=20
what you've been wired and trained to see and say.  It's easier=20
to make closer contact with people who share your values if not=20
your education and knowledge, to build bridges not towards the=20
center of culture, towards a 31-flavors type commodification of=20
individuality, but around the periphery.  This still involves=20
reaching outside the poetry community, and to the extent that=20
one's art's tradition is a learned thing, with its own issues=20
and techniques only acquired with practice and study, it=20
involves teaching or contextualizing.  It involves risk, too.=20
But better that than advertising or marketing, which is just a=20
means to create another desire.

There are LOTs of people who do this already, so i'm not saying=20
this is news, but in response to some of Haas's good points=20
about community, i wanted to reiterate it.

The market may reward superior marketing, but is that reward=20
really what you want?  Yes and no, i guess.  I recently saw a=20
copy of a new book of essays on women poets of the (i think)=20
60s-80s.  Jane Fonda as Barberella was big as life on the cover.=20
One wonders if any of the poets written about in that collection=20
would have chosen such a representative.

Do you know of the australian poetry mag of the early 1980s that had as =
its
content work poetry? It was called 925.
You can still get copies from collective effort press, in Melbourne.
Collected Works bookshop, kris Hemmensley, should be able to help =
finding
it.


PiO, its editor, is a poet who himself has regarded his work as a =
resource
for his poetry activities, telephones, stationary, photocopying.
In fact he has refused any promotions and is still at the same level as =
he
entered the public service 25 years ago. This means that he is senior to =
all
of his bosses, and he probably had something to do with their training, =
so
although he is the lowest paid has relative freedom to do what he likes.

[mailto:POETICS@LISTSERV.BUFFALO.EDU]
|||On Behalf Of Kristen Gallagher
|||Sent: Wednesday, 13 April 2005 4:43 AM
|||To: POETICS@LISTSERV.BUFFALO.EDU
|||Subject: WIG project, Poetry & Work
|||
|||W A N T E D :
|||Do you write on the job?
|||Are you worried about
|||getting caught?  Does
|||your worry about get-
|||ting caught affect the
|||form of your writing?
|||Does your job affect
|||your poetry's content?
|||Has poetry, on your
|||job, influenced your
|||job, your coworkers,
|||or even your field?
|||Have you used your
|||poetic sense to imple-
|||ment changes in the
|||workplace, labor rel-
|||ations, etc.? Have
|||you ever chosen a
|||job because you
|||knew you would
|||get good poetry
|||out of it?  Would
|||you consider employ-
|||ing your present job
|||for a poetic good?
|||
|||In 1930, in the New Masses, Michael Gold proposed the following:
|||
|||"that every writer in the group attach himself to one of the =
industries.
|||That he spend the next few years in and out of this industry, =
studying it
|||from every angle, making himself an expert in it, so that when he =
writes
|||of
|||it he will write like an insider, not like a bourgeois intellectual
|||observer."
|||
|||Though we have no proposed "group" in mind, nor any fixed idea what =
this
|||project might yield, we find Gold's basic idea as compelling today as =
it
|||must have been then.  Rather than necessarily "studying" work, =
however,
|||we
|||encourage poets to re-appropriate work as an engine of poetic
|||in(ter)vention.  We are not necessarily motivating people toward any
|||particular political end (though we don't, of course, rule that out); =
nor
|||do we ask poets to address work necessarily in a Marxian framework, =
if
|||perchance you should have other inclinations.  We simply hope to
|||"exploit,"
|||or rather mobilize, the poetic labor of what Gold terms insiders.  Is =
it
|||time to think of our selves as secret agents?  We are happy to let =
you
|||decide for yourself the form your assignment takes.
|||
|||WANTED, Have you
|||considered working as
|||a collections agent at,
|||say, the Harry Fox
|||Agency, busting kids
|||& rappers for fair use
|||of music samples?
|||Are you interested
|||in doing poetic re-
|||search on the music
|||industry as it fights to
|||cling to its money-
|||base as (ostensibly)
|||a bunch of teenagers
|||work to circumvent
|||their efforts?  Are you
|||worried the work in a
|||position like this one
|||would be awful?  Will
|||you lose your indie
|||cred? Do you believe
|||one is implicated in
|||the larger, indirect,
|||moral and ethical
|||effects of what one
|||does for a living?
|||Even if one cannot
|||get another job?
|||Can poetic interven-
|||tion subvert that?
|||
|||In Acts of Resistance: Against the Tyranny of the Market, Pierre
|||Bourdieu,
|||speaking of what he calls "the insecurity-inducing strategies" of
|||transnational corporations, argues that we must reframe our demands
|||regarding labor.  We must "break away from the logic of past =
struggles,"
|||he
|||writes, "which, being based on the demand for work and for better pay =
for
|||work, trap [us] within work and within the exploitation (or
|||flexploitation)
|||which accompanies it" (86).  Darwin believed flexibility in the face =
of
|||chance and constant change was the key to survival. How can we, =
through
|||poetic actions, bend the laboring society to our own needs, so that =
we
|||survive not only as poets but as citizens?  How can poetry help us
|||rethink
|||work's place in our society and our lives?
|||
|||During the 1930s, writers like Gold made an effort to put poetry and =
the
|||workplace in dialogue.  We often hear comparisons made today between =
the
|||presidency of Herbert Hoover and George W. Bush.  Not since Hoover =
has a
|||president had a worse job creation record.  How might we translate =
Gold's
|||revolutionary ambitions to our current postindustrial, panoptic =
milieu?
|||Can
|||the formal inventiveness of avant-garde poetry help us re-think work? =
 We
|||find antecedents in the writings of Williams and Stevens, Reznikoff =
and
|||Niedecker, and more recently Kit Robinson and Juliana Spahr, to name =
but
|||a
|||few.  As poets, how do we respond at the daily level to the =
globalization
|||of what Hannah Arendt calls "the laboring society"?
|||
|||Wanted, Operations.
|||Are you plugged in
|||all day, typing the
|||same codes over
|||and over?  Do you
|||sometimes feel as if
|||your job is rewiring
|||your brain?  Do you
|||find yourself making
|||non-sense words
|||out of the codes
|||just to pass the time,
|||or to exercise the
|||brain in opposition to
|||such fixity?
|||
|||We are soliciting only new work.  Submissions can come in whatever =
form
|||you
|||feel best exemplifies what the above statements have to do with your
|||situation.  Submissions may come in many possible forms:  1) poems
|||created
|||on, in or around work situations as described above, 2) statements,
|||analyses or narrations of the relationship your work and poetry have =
had
|||on
|||each other, 3) spoofs on office documents, 4) confessions of the =
secret
|||evils of your workplace, 5) documentary facts of worker abuse, worker
|||success, worker surrealism, etc.  We hope to receive a wide range of
|||interpretations of our ideas as laid out here.
|||
|||"Writers in all sections of the country.
|||                We present their story.
|||It is a gaunt recital of worker-writers"

I have been searching high and low (mostly the latter) for a used/new/copy/=
reprint of Crayon #2, the Russell Atkins issue, all to no avail. If anyone =
can backchannel with clues/hints/forgetaboutits/etc. I'd appreciate it.

Don't miss the last event in the ACT ART series, an evening with
anti-corporate pranksters, satirists and impersonators THE YES MEN.

TOMORROW NIGHT Thursday, April 14
Mills College
Lisser Theater
7:00 p.m.
*free* and open to the public

Reception/party to follow, at Steven Matheson and Jenny Lion's house on
campus.

The Yes Men (http://www.theyesmen.org/) are notorious for their mass
media art works and manipulation of media spectacle. Agreeing their way
into the fortified compounds of commerce, they ask questions and smuggle
out stories of their hijinks to provide a public glimpse at the
behind-the-scenes world of business. Their hoaxes have brought
international attention to corporate and industrial crime. They’ve taken
on the leaders of global free trade, including Dow Chemical, the World
Trade Organization and George W. Bush.  A documentary following the Yes
Men was released in 2004 to critical acclaim, including official
selections by the Sundance, Berlin and Toronto Film Festivals.

ACT ART is funded in part by the James Irvine Foundation, the
Contemporary Writers Series, Poets & Writers, Inc. and A'A' Arts.

Shelling on the Beach with My Mother


She said to put that seashell down
because it looks like old bones.
In this tide pool there are many deaths
inside of deaths and very few corpses
left intact. Each shell is a broken relic,
a shard of beauty, crabs missing legs,
small white heads that belonged to crayfish,
half life emptied by sand pipers,
turtle and water dragging through
the graveyard. If I told her to lay me
back down on the bed last year
because my blood was missing something,
overcome by itself, she would have refused
to give me back to her creator
as I sunk back into the sand,
became just a shell in her hands.





Be well

        Blip

     Blip The Digital Game by Tommy appeared in 1977-78 (Japan). It was
based on Pong and similar early computer games. There are three buttons on
each side; when the "ball" comes towards one of them, the player presses
that particular button (if she can) to send it back. The ball is actually
an LED, and the entire game is mechanical, complete with a wind-up knob.
It takes two batteries for the LED. Blip is quite difficult to play;
Foofwa d'Imobilite told me he had one as a child and loved it. The
mechanism that moves the LED back and forth is hidden behind dark plastic;
only the red light shines through. This is an early analog mimicry of an
early digital game based on analog ping-pong. The type-face is close to
the same font used by early card-readers. So here is a mapping, which, by
virtue of the noise embodied in the hidden mechanism, seems actually
harder to play than its digital counterpart. It's a bit eerie, given the
later development of handhelds. I hope, by virtue of this video, to give
you some idea of the excitement of the simulacra of early gaming, as well
as stimulate a vigorous debate on the relationship of digital and analogic
phenomena to the exigencies of flesh.

Just Bread



I come to you in evening light
rubbed with aromatics,
bathed in olive oil and
warmed by the heat
of another day’s controlled oppression.
Laying myself before you, calling your name.
Call me Foccacia. I will go well with the soft fare
of Italy.  Place an olive on my tongue.
You cringe and move away.
Such a wide loaf, too tough
to pull and peel, too coarse,
perhaps too natural, you think
but do not say.

I roll in coriander, cardamom
and strange herbs of the motherland
waiting to be used.  They color me
the orange whisper of ambasha
and I wait in the night
for the soft rustle
of your feet upon the sand,
for the gray dawn at your back,
for you bringing home the product
of your stealth in far-off lands.
I awake to find you sleeping on the sofa
the scepter of your kingdom in one hand
the blue light from your many windowed watchtower
flashing indeterminate across a wide screen
and this is how we dance:
I close my eyes, imagine we
can meet here in this place of dreams.
I hold you in the foreign vision
of a woman you have not known.

You will take the prey—it will not matter
what kind, whatever spices there contained.
However long I marinate, roast, baste, bake or saute,
you will ask for it on Schwebel's—potato, if you please—
place it, press it between two slices
and love the soft yellow of their scream
because nothing else, after all, is bread.
Because anything pressed hard enough
becomes a sandwich anyway.








Be well

They hang the man and flog the woman

But let the greater villain loose
That steals the common from the goose.

".....at a time when I am speaking to you about the paradox of desire -- in
the
sense that different goods obscure it -- you can hear outside the awful
language
of power.  There's no point in asking whether they are sincere or
hypocritical,
whether they want peace of whether they calculate the risks.  The dominating
impression as such a moment is that something that may pass for a prescribed
good; information addresses and captures impotent crowds to whom it is poured

forth like a liquor that leaves them dazed as they move toward the slaughter
house.
One might even ask if one would allow the cataclysm to occur without first
giving
free reign to this hubbub of voices...."

Van Gogh's Ear, Volume Four (Best World Poetry & Prose Anthology)=20
French Connection Press=20
ISBN: 2914853033=20

Product Description: Volume Four of Van Gogh's Ear: Best World Poetry =
and Prose is now to be experienced! A powerful poem for peace by one of =
the great voices of contemporary literature, Maya Angelou, seizes the =
soul; Margaret Atwood's insightful, often amusing essay on poetics =
inspires; Beat legend Carolyn Cassady's intriguing new prose piece =
explores the energies that create and sustain all life; a high-speed =
letter from Beat icon Neal Cassady sweeps one away with his thoughts on =
intellect and the arts; acclaimed renaissance man Leonard Cohen's poem =
excites both the imagination and emotions; James Dean's hardhitting poem =
gives a brutal glimpse into the acidic mixture of love and hate the =
legendary actor had for his father (a scan of Dean's actual poem appears =
with photos from a private collection); Norman Mailer's tasty "If Poetry =
Is The Food" will not only have you salivating for more, but on an =
inward journey beyond flesh and bone; Bangladesh poet Taslima Nasrin, =
who had to flee her country following death threats by Islamic fanatics, =
contributed a poem which reveals much through the rape of two young =
sisters who are ordered by a judge to be whipped in public for speaking =
out against the man who raped them; Yoko Ono's piercing "Maybe I Was Too =
Young" and lovely "A Rose is A Rose is A Rose" appear with one of her =
intimate Franklin Summer drawings; Sue Russell shatters the Hollywood =
portrayal of serial killer Aileen Wuornos in the movie Monster with her =
probing essay. There's also Sonia Sanchez's startling poem about a =
mother torn between love for her 7-year-old daughter and addiction to =
crack; Irish poet Eabhan Ni Shuileabhain's intense journey into the =
minds of the main people involved in executing a criminal at the time of =
execution; and even more powerful work by Tony Curtis, Joyce Carol =
Oates, C. K. Williams, Diane di Prima, John Updike, Daisy Zamora, =
Michael Rothenberg, Joanne Kyger, John Gilmore, Tess Gallagher, Richard =
Kostelanetz, Marc Smith, Alice Notley, Billy Collins, Aram Saroyan, J. =
T. LeRoy, in total 91 great talents. After reading this landmark =
anthology, you'll feel as if you'd lived intensely in the skins of many =
different people in different parts of the world. Highly recommended as =
a rich resource for teachers and a library basic.=20

The Apr/May issue of BookForum I found kind of a surprise (in that it's
practically impossible to find something readable among the proliferation of
gallery ads in ArtForum!)

Eric Banks, the editor, seems to have a real brain and a publisher to
support a vision of multiple kinds of literary materials - frequently
international - that are different from the New York Review of Books,
ThreePennyR 50's seeming nostalgia for that kind of criticism, tone, etc.
variety .
In terms of Americana - and in light of the recent passing of Robert Creeley
and and the perhaps narrow and continuous focus on defining and redefining
postwar 'new American poetry' - it's fun to read Robert Lowell's letters (a
new book is out) and who he was hearing and positioning himself in letters
to Pound, Berryman, Ginsberg, WCW and others. In the letter to Ginsberg in
1958 he is already very aware of Creeley and Levertov - and though he is
excited by Kaddish - without irony he writes,

"...I guess poetry as a technique means much less to me thant to you. I can
hear Creeley's polite, dim halting voice behind the barrage of Williams..."
This is four or five years before Creeley's "For Love." (I suspect the first
wife did not think Creeley's voice was "dim" by then!)

Indeed the letters import the pathos of somebody getting spun open,
challenged and attracted to the new poetry - not without being critical, or
entirely jumping ranks. The weather had clearly begun to change the
landscape of American.

There's also a wonderful  piece by Bruce Bawer on the person and work of Guy
Davenport - which ought to drive people back to the work.

But Americana aspect is only a fraction of the Review's scope - work based
Japan, Iran, Cambodia - the vision is global and certainly a refreshing (if
not often tragic) space encounter with folks who have opened their eyes
beyond 'our' borders, as well as redefining what's been previously assumed
as "our" frontier.

And Bawer has caught Davenport's writing: "Joseph Cornell boxes full of
words..." Yes.

The Bee Dealer





My eyes, fools say, have been too full
of wine for me to count. If I glare into headlights
and keep counting, I will get a lucky price
for my bees, will stop thinking of divorce

when I see the letter “D.” And I know
the number of bees in my hives, know the number
of ounces in all the jars, know the ounces of honey
the people in the town consume, know

the number of ounces the average town gobbles,
know neighbors speculate why I left
my mathematical job, know the number
of bullets in my pocket, know

every person near a window must consume
honey sweet as a town without gossip.

Dearest all,

I’ve recently finished the first few poems of a speech
to text poetics project. And the resulting poems are
PRINT based so I’m attempting a return to paper. The
website below has a description of the project and
links to the first few poems. But briefly: I take
media files (speeches, movies, ambient noise, radio
etc.) and record the audio through a speech to text
program. The program, being trained to my voice, reads
everything wrong and spits out these long single
spaced files of awkward text and phrases loosely based
on the original. Think of it as a translation of a
translation of a translation of a translation….the
code beneath our language. I then reform those text
files into poetry (using certain rules).

The URL:
http://www.heliozoa.com/speech/speechtext.html

I would love to hear thoughts on if these poems (and
the project is compelling), do they work for you, just
nay thoughts really. I know this isn’t really a new
idea, but my first few attempts turned out such
interesting poems, I wanted to take it further. And
lastly, anyone know of any print mags or journals that
might be interested in something like this?

The URL again (just to be cheeky):
http://www.heliozoa.com/speech/speechtext.html

Cheers and thanks…..  Jason Nelson

A Project to Present Chapbooks of Text-based
or Visual-poetry Works by Current Authors.

Chapbooks will appear when funds and time
are available. The chapbooks will be supported
by sales, so, please buy one or two of the chap-
books below. Printed on thick, acid-free paper,

ample of a new sort of style. The design goes
back to the original nature of the chapbook as
plain-books.

They will be printed in very small editions of
under 20 copies.

Originally,'chapbooks' we called 'cheap-books',
and were sold in 1700s England and France
to test the market before a hardcover edition
was printed, much like the situation today,
only in reverse. The editions below are differ-
ent only in being produced of high-quality
materials, with one full work per book.

CompaÃ±eros y CompaÃ±eras of the Crusade for Justice:


Please accept this letter on behalf of UniÃ³n del Barrio to pay respect and
honor the memory of CompaÃ±ero Rodolfo Corky Gonzales.


We use the term â€œCompaÃ±eroâ€ to express our appreciation and admiration for
Corky as a man that sacrificed a part of himself with the goal of
building a
movement for Raza self-determination. When an individual of such skill and
charisma such as Corky rises from our community and chooses the life of
an activist
and revolutionary, we hold that person in the highest regard.

A visionary fighter, Corky was willing to risk what was necessary to
build a
future without oppression, without exploitation, a future of dignity,
justice
and respect for all.

Neither our memory nor our movement will be surrendered to loss and
sadness â€“
we must define ourselves according to the shining example Corky gave us. At
his finest moment Corky gave us a picture of what we all could become as
a free
and liberated people â€“ a human representation of Chicano Liberation.

CompaÃ±ero Corky will be missed by all of us, and it is the
responsibility of
each of us to honor his memory by continuing to advance the struggle for
Raza
Liberation. This is the path that Corky leaves us as his legacy. UniÃ³n del
Barrio honors that legacy and memory of Rodolfo Corky Gonzales.

With our â€œVIVASâ€ we raise Corky to his historical place among the greatest
leaders of the Chicano Mexicano peopleâ€¦


Viva CuauhtÃ©moc!

Viva Emiliano Zapata!

Viva Francisco Villa!

Viva Corky Gonzales!

Subject:      W.S. Graham, Collected Poems (review)
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="US-ASCII"
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

My review of W.S. Graham's Collected Poems is now online at the Boston
Review website:

http://bostonreview.net/BR30.2/stefans.html

British Modernism has not been served well by American critics and readers.
Preoccupied by American poetry's own version of family court-who are the
true heirs of William Carlos Williams, Charles Olson, or even Robert Lowell?
when will the prodigal Stein finally come back from Europe and take her
place at the head of the table?-we have been content merely to nod
approvingly at the likes of Basil Bunting and David Jones. But as the recent
publication of J.H. Prynne's Poems, Tom Raworth's Collected Poems, and the
many collected and selected volumes streaming out of Salt Publishing remind
us, the story of British Modernism in America is still a work in progress.

Add to that story W.S. Graham's New Collected Poems, which not only returns
Graham to the central narrative of 20th-century British poetry but should
also mark his introduction to the United States as a major lyric poet. A
daring technician teased, but not intoxicated, by visionary impulses, he
belongs in the company of Gerard Manley Hopkins, Wallace Stevens, and Hart
Crane, but as the one who believed language to be an obstruction to
communication, an "other" just behind, yet inseparable from, the stage
machinery of the self. "I stand in my vocabulary looking out," he writes in
"Notes to the Difficult One," and the first part of "Clusters Traveling Out"
ends, "Whoever / Speaks to you will not be me. / I wonder what I will say."
This see-saw between a near-paranoia about language and an utter devotion to
its unveiling places him among such chroniclers of the "word virus" as
William S. Burroughs, Laura Riding Jackson, Jack Spicer, and any number of
later writers who were inspired by the language philosophies of Wittgenstein
and Heidegger, or who, steeped in Roland Barthes, vexed the borders between
reader, writer, and text.

Strictly, Graham returned with the publication (in the wake of MML and IITP)
of the original Collected by Faber in 1979.

Matthew Francis' edited +New Collected+ (2004) [by now out in paper] is a
lovely piece of work, but doesn't add much in terms of texts to the 79
edition.

Chicano Leader Rodolfo "Corky" Gonzales 1929-2005: "He Was the Fist. He
Stood For Defiance, Resistance"

Chicano political and civil rights activist Rodolfo "Corky" Gonzales
died Tuesday at his home in Denver, Colorado. He was 76 years old. We
speak with his friend, columnist Roberto Rodriguez. [includes rush
transcript]
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Chicano political and civil rights activist Rodolfo "Corky" Gonzales
died this past Tuesday at his home in Denver, Colorado. He was 76 years
old.

Gonzales was an iconic leader in the movement for justice and equality
for Mexican-Americans in the Southwest and he is credited with raising
the nation's awareness of the plight of urban Chicanos.

In the mid-1960"s he founded an urban civil rights and cultural movement
called the Crusade for Justice which advocated Chicano nationalism.
During the late sixties and early seventies, he organized walkouts,
demonstrations against police brutality and marches against the Vietnam
War.

In 1968, Gonzales led a Chicano contingent to the Poor People's March on
Washington D.C and issued a "plan of the Barrio" which demanded better
housing, education and restitution of pueblo lands. Gonzales was also an
organizer of the Annual Chicano Youth Liberation Conference which sought
to create unity among Chicano youth.

Gonzales also advocated for increased political representation for
Chicanos. In 1972 he was the keynote speaker at the newly formed La Raza
Unida Party national convention in El Paso Texas. The party fielded
political candidates to run for office in the state.

But perhaps Corky Gonzales is best known for his poem "I am Joaquin/Yo
Soy Joaquin." He wrote the epic poem in 1965 and it is one of the most
important literary works to emerge from the Chicano movement.

In the poem Gonzales tells of the historic struggles faced by Mexican
Americans in the United States.


* Robert Rodriguez, friend of Corky Gonzales. Along with his wife,
Patrisia Gonzales, he writes the syndicated Column of the Americas,
distributed by Universal Press Syndicate.

RUSH TRANSCRIPT

AMY GOODMAN: Joining us on the phone right now from Minnesota to talk
about the life and legacy of Corky Gonzales, is writer and columnist,
Roberto Rodriguez. We welcome you to Democracy Now!

ROBERTO RODRIGUEZ: Yes. Good morning, Amy and Juan.

AMY GOODMAN: It's good to have you with us. Can you talk about your
friend, colleague, Corky Gonzales?

ROBERTO RODRIGUEZ: Yes. Like any mythic hero, it's kind of hard,
initially, because we're still in the shock and the mourning. I don't
think he is buried until Sunday. So, I mean, keeping that in mind, you
know, as I think about Corky, you know, it's -- I guess there's words
that swirl around the “I am Joaquin.” You know, I think for a lot of us,
we look at it probably as a manifesto, you know, because, I mean, you
could also look at it as a poem or something literary, but at the same
time it was also a manifesto, but not like political only, but almost a
spiritual manifesto, because I think that that poem that Juan mentioned,
you know, it talked about how, you know, all -- we all used to call each
other different names, like Mexicano, Latino, Chicano, all these
different names. And everybody would be fighting about it. And I think
that poem was an attempt to unify a people. Now, you know, the unity
maybe was more an illusion perhaps, but at another level, you know, I
think people felt unified and felt good about that poem. It was no
longer, you know, in the streets. It was like people called each other
“wetbacks” and “mojados” and “ocho.” You know, that was derisiveness,
and this was the opposite. It was an attempt to say, you know, “We are
one people.” There's another thing that I should mention, too, about who
he was, because I think civil rights would probably not be sufficient,
in terms of a leader. I think he -- and I think Juan, of course -- would
know this firsthand. You know, I think it was the language of
liberation. So, when people spoke of movement in those days, you know,
that we were talking about movements around the world, you know,
liberation movements, and he was critical in principle in that idea of,
in this instance, Aztlan, you know, as something to liberate. Through
the years, of course, that has become something different, more, of
course, civil rights or human rights, but at the time it was like, you
know, hey, you know, why are we being chased out of our ancestral homes?
That was the language of the time.

JUAN GONZALEZ: And could you talk a little bit about the Crusade for
Justice and its impact on Chicano youth and youth all around the country
at that time, and then the rise of Raza Unida and Corky's role in that?

ROBERTO RODRIGUEZ: Sure, I think, you know, the Crusade for Justice,
when I was thinking about it, I was saying, you know, I think I had
talked earlier about, like Cesar Chavez and Dolores Huertas, they
represented something very special for us as a people, and we could
probably see them as perhaps the heart, you know? He was the fist. That
is the Crusade for Justice. It stood for defiance, resistance, and that
-- so, in other words, rather than get into specificities of the role,
the specific role, of the Crusade, I think that in a bigger sense we can
look at it like that's what the Crusade was. That's what it meant to us
as a people, that we were no longer going to, you know, sit or stand or
kneel with our heads bowed, and, you know, “si, padron,” or “si, senor.”
I think the Crusade gave us that impetus that, you know, again hey,
we're not going to take it. And I think that's what I think we can learn
or remember the Crusade for. You know, the Crusade evolved later into
Escuela Tlatelolco. But the earlier era that you are referring to also
is the Raza Unida Party, You know, again, very turbulent era, but again
it was also in that context of things -- liberatory things, ideas, and I
think the Raza Unida Party at that time meant a breaking from the
democratic stranglehold of, you know -- the Republicans had wanted
nothing to do with us, and the Democrats took us for granted. And so, La
Raza Unida Party was supposed to be that alternative. Now again, as you
well know, you had these intelligence operations that were heavy-duty,
you know, fighting, pitting people against each other, etc., etc., and I
think it effectively destroyed not just La Raza Unida Party but many
movements throughout the world, in this country, in particular. That's
why, again, we can look at his biography and his obituary and see all
the accomplishments and controversies and all these things, but in the
end, I think he will be seen as a mythic hero, you know, somebody who
stood up and, you know, when I say “fist,” I mean, in a sense it's
literal. He was a boxer. And I think the idea was like, yes, we can
fight back.

JUAN GONZALEZ: What had he been doing in his later years? Clearly, after
the high tide of the movement in the 1970s began to ebb, what was he
involved in in his later years?

ROBERTO RODRIGUEZ: Well, one thing that is really important to note is
that at that time and a little later, also critical work was the
relations between the Crusade and the Chicano Movement with the American
Indian Movement. That's something that many peoples don't know. You
know, and you well know, of course, the relations between Chicanos,
Puerto Ricans, Chicanos and other peoples. One thing that people didn't
know perhaps is the relation between Chicanos and AIM, which I think at
the time the F.B.I. considered that the greatest threat to national
security, the whole idea that Chicanos might one day see themselves as
being native. One thing – you know, his history has got -- it's too long
to detail, except that something that many people should know perhaps,
because in the last, I would say, God, 15 years or so, he had a heart
attack, and he crashed, and he was never the same. I remember my wife
and I, you know, Patrisia, we went to Tlatelolco, presented and we saw
him and met him again. He was no longer the same person from an earlier
era. And so, what I want to mention is because this generation probably
will only remember, you know, a senor, you know, as a great man who, you
know, barely was able to move around, so to speak, and not know the
impact he had, you know, in the 1950s as a boxer, as a leader in, you
know, the 1960s, 1970s. He was an incredible man. In the last 15 years,
he was slowed, so to speak, by those injuries. But I mean, so powerful
was his effect from that early era, that I mean, he, I think, will live
on always as, you know, Cesar Chavez will live on, and you know, the
people remain alive, because their ideas will remain alive.

AMY GOODMAN: We're talking to Roberto Rodriguez. What about Corky
Gonzalez suing the Rocky Mountain News in February of 1974, a $30
million libel suit, because of what he felt was their inaccurate
representation of people in Crusade?

ROBERTO RODRIGUEZ: Yeah. Well, I could only characterize that as part of
the same era where -- and I'm almost hesitating to laugh, because you
probably know full well to this day, I mean, that is the principle
battle of not simply Chicano movements, but people of color, as well,
indigenous movements. Every single day we are mischaracterized. We are
censored, you know, and on a good day, you know, we're misrepresented.
And that was part of that era. You know, part of the same era, of
course, is the whole struggle with Coors. That was – again, this is
another generation, but the struggle with media is, God, it's really
tragic, maybe tragicomic, but it's never-ending. It's not limited.
That's why when people look at Corky, you're not looking at Corky in
Denver or Corky in the Crusade, but this is emblematic of the entire
nation. I mean, you know, as you’re colleagues of ours, whenever we go
anywhere, that's probably the number one complaint that the media is
misrepresenting us. They're forcing an identity upon us. They're
commercializing us. In his case, of course, you are dealing with other
matters and other factors, you know, obviously, all of the intelligence
stuff. God, I mean, I don't know. It's almost like I'm looking into a
mirror into the future. You know, now, we have the government buying
media, manufacturing stories. It's -- I don't know, it's kind of weird.
You know, that media always seems to be the spear, you know, of
anti-progressive movements, anti-indigenous, anti-Chicano, Puerto Rican,
all of these movements, the media is always there at the forefront. I
don't know what ever happened to the lawsuit, if he won. You may have. I
remember Burt Corona in L.A. won a lawsuit. There was always lawsuits
everywhere. There would probably be too many, if people really -- I
don't know, I think people sometimes get cynical about the media and
just give up on it.

AMY GOODMAN: Well, Roberto Rodriguez, we want to thank you very much for
being with us as we remember Corky Gonzales, who died at his home in
Denver, Colorado, this week. Thank you.

Thursday, April 21 at 7:30pm
SF Cinematheque and The Poetry Center at SFSU
together present:

Promiscuous Cinema Program 1
The Inscribed Gesture of Thought:
Stan Brakhage, Films and Robert Grenier, Poetry
Robert Grenier In Person

Yerba Buena Center for the Arts
701 Mission Street (corner of Third)

http://www.sfcinematheque.org/calendar.shtml#317


"Robert Grenier's scrawl is comparable to Stan Brakhage's films
which Brakhage described as poems."
  -- Leslie Scalapino

Call it calligraphy or cacography, this program of the
hand-painted films and inscribed poetry will engage and even
delight lovers of the complex interaction of painting, drawing,
film and language. Tonight's event explores both the influence
of the Abstract Expressionist and Action painters on Stan
Brakhage's art and the introduction of gesture into writing
through the work of Robert Grenier's drawn poetry.

Grenier will present slides of his notebook poems and guide the
audience as we literally relearn to read his concrete and
haiku-like inscriptions.  We're made aware that reading is an
act full of details as writing is.

16mm films to be shown include:
"Thigh Line Lyre Triangular" - film about a birth
"Delicacies of Molten Horror Synapse" - reaction to TV
"First Hymn to the Night -- Novalis" - hypnagagic vision and lyric

PLUS RARE 35mm screenings of:
"Rage Net" - a vision of rage rather than expression of it
"Chinese Series" - one of Brakhage's last films
"Interpolations I - V" - true 'polyphonic' filmmaking


curated by konrad steiner

Stunning original copy of the debut LP by Alan Sondheim's Ritual All 770,
released in 1967 on Riverboat, the same label as John Fahey's The
Transfiguration of Blind Joe Death. "The Songs" is comprised of one long
improvisation by Sondheim (electric guitar, violin, flute, suling
[Indonesian flute], xylophone, alto sax, classical guitar, clarinet,
shenhai [Indian oboe], bass recorder, mandolin, so-na [Chinese oboe],
Hawaiian guitar, koto, sopranino recorder, chimta [Indian percussion, cor
anglais, sitar, bansari [Indian flute]) along with Barry Sugarman (tabla,
dholak [Indian hand drums] and naquerro [Moroccan kettledrums]), Chris
Matthewson (bass), Robert Poholek (trumpet, cornet), Ruth Ann Hutchinson
(vocal), June Fellows (vocal) and J.Z. (aka Rafi Zabor, see below) (jazz
drums). An all-time classic of the avant underground, ESP-Disk went on to
put out two records under Sondheim's name and the group was name-checked
by Nurse With Wound. This album has never been reissued in any form and is
exceedingly RARE!

Cover is in excellent condition for its age (37 years) though the edges
are discolored. There is some wear at the corners but all seams are very
strong. Vinyl is MINT- and appears to be unplayed.

>From the Washington Post in 1998:

"Any tour of Rafi Zabor's apartment includes a prominent stop in the
bathroom. The ceiling has a hole the size of a Buick, which ordinarily
would be noteworthy enough. But what really draws attention is the fact
that the bathtub faucet is gushing hot water.

You say all faucets do that? Yes, but this one is broken, which means the
water has been going nonstop for several months now. It was born as a
drip, became a trickle, and by now is a full-fledged torrent.

Just as the modest Colorado River carved the mighty Grand Canyon, the
water from this faucet has, over time, made its presence felt. The
porcelain where the water hits the tub has worn away, revealing underneath
a dark, chalky material. This bodes further trouble, but Zabor, who says
he can't get the super to do anything, is curiously unworried.

"It's every Turk's dream to have a fountain in his home," he says. While
Zabor is not Turkish, he's fond of the country. The fact that it's hot
water is a plus. The Turks also are partial to hammans, the steamy
communal baths.

Why, Zabor suddenly realizes, he's living out a Turkish fantasy right here
in deepest Brooklyn! "I've got it all," he says.

True enough. Forget about the funky apartment have we mentioned the way
the bedroom wall seeps moisture whenever there's a rainy wind from the
east? and concentrate on the good news: Zabor's first novel, "The Bear
Comes Home," will be presented the PEN/Faulkner Award at a gala ceremony
at the Folger Shakespeare Library on Saturday night. With the award comes
enough money to afford a plumber, $15,000."

8pm: Improv Night! Musicians play in different combinations
In January of 2000, Arts for Art presented a groundbreaking concert at
New York¹s Mercury Lounge. The approach was to take a core group of New
York¹s top improvisers and have them play short improvised sets in
various combinations over the course of an evening. Dubbed "Mercurial
Visions," the concert featured performances from Matthew Shipp, Jameel
Moondoc, William Parker and others and allowed them to explore new
creative and musical contexts. The concert was a great success, drawing
sold out crowds as audiences flocked to experience this fresh approach to
music presentation. Time Out-New York hailed the event as the city¹s No.
1 live music event of 2000 and a second Mercurial Visions concert drew
another sold out crowd in early 2001.
The presentation of nights of improvisation has been a staple of Vision
Festival programming since that time. Recent improv nights have included
a host of notable musicians of avant-jazz. This night will prove to be no
exception, as eight master musicians will be brought together in this
unique format.
Jason Kao Hwang: "Hwang's music  unfurls across great spaces of
listener-time, demanding multiple close
  listening and still rewarding even the most casual spin-of the- disc.
Andrew Bartlett, The Pipe
Mat Maneri: "Since the mid-1990s, Mat has been at the epicentre of new
jazz creativity in America, and has
played improvised music with a broad range of partners including Cecil
Taylor, Borah Bergman, Connie Bauer, William Parker, Matthew Shipp, Joe
Morris, Bern Nix, Randy Peterson, Pandelis Karayorgis, Guillermo
Gregorio, Steven Lantner, KeithYaun, Indo-jazz fusion group Natraj and
many others." -ECM
Sabir Mateen: "As one of the most creatively volatile reed smiths on the
scene Mateen¹s been privy to countless
high-energy gigs, both with the working underground ensemble Test and at
the helm of his own aggregations." Derek Taylor, AAJ
Daniel Carter: "Daniel Carter is quickly, and quietly, becoming one of
the most important players on the free
  jazz scene." James Taylor, All About Jazz
Steven Gauci: "One of the most prominent up and coming
saxophonist/flautists on the New York City jazz
  scene." Kulanu Organization
Reggie Workman: "Reggie Workman has long been one of the most technically
gifted of all bassists, a brilliant
player whose versatile style fits into both hard bop and very avant-garde
settings." Scott Yanow, All Music Guide
Whit Dickey: "It¹s Dickey¹s game and he¹s all over the place, knocking
dents and curveballs into creeping
notions of linear time and effectively exploding the dynamic at the
merest hint of coasting. A beauty." David Keenen, www.Sundayherald.com
Steve Dalachinsky: His work "crackle(s) with energy and the dizzy swing
and bop of bebop jazz language and
  freeform feel." (Ralph Haselmann Jr., Lucid Moon Poetry Magazine)

11pm: Patrick Brennan: Sonic Openings Under Pressure
Patrick Brennan, alto saxophone; Hilliard Greene, bass; David Pleasant,
drums
"Altoist Brennan is a guy whose stock really ought to be higher... The
group is versatile enough to explore the extremes of silence, full
shouting, and drone material as well. This is great stuff, and one of the
finest Spirit Room documents I¹ve heard in a while." Jason Bivins,
Cadence
Saxophonist and composer Patrick Brennan came to New York to pursue
creative music in 1975. Originall performing in an almost entirely free
improvised style, Brennan soon began to pursue composing as a more
controlled way to structure his groups¹ improvisations. The resultant
approach has been one that combines composed and improvised elements,
using basic musical structures as a springboard for the masterful
improvisations which follow.
Brennan has continued this approach throughout his career. His ongoing
ensemble, Sonic Openings Under Pressure has been Brennan¹s most frequent
performing ensemble since the late 1970s. With somewhat shifting
personnels, the group was one of the earliest groups to frequent the
original Knitting Factory during the 1980s. His work with the ensemble
will continue on this evening, serving as the vehicle for Brennan¹s
unique compositional and instrumental approaches.

An Introduction to Drunk and Disorderly from the Editor

 I first read Alan Catlin’s Joyce in Hades when I was a kid, 13 years at
best, borrowing his books from the
Schenectady Public Library in upstate New York.  The book is utterly
depressing and fascinating in its
original format, much of the prose abuts large scale photos of buildings
iced over and left to ruin, snowy
graveyards, statues, and asylums, which are all covered with decayed
sootish snow.  I could relate to the
book as a futuristic version of Schenectady, perhaps too well, as I
adroitly witnessed our fine city close
down, the jobs move to Mexico, and watched our area reach a 20%
unemployment rate by the time I
graduated high school. These were photos of the graveyard we started to
escape to as our familes became
homebound for more time than ever before, of the statues that reminded
us of our past prosperity, of the
solidly frozen house we rightly predicted when my next door neighbors
disappeared one day, abandoning
their two story structure and two cats to a bank foreclosure.  Catlin
deals with reality, however grim;
therefore, mentioning the backdrop to these poems might be useful.

    This first full-length collection in a substantial edition is
designed to clarify the breadth and importance
of this diversely voiced poet, remininscent of Robert Browning, but only
in his width of tone change. Catlin
has unfortunately been saddled with the moniker of being a “bar poet,”
and while this statement is true
insofar as his profession as a bartender, combined with his largest
circulation collections containing
drinking references, his other publications as a poet are entirely
different. Watch these poems carefully, note
how variously they change, from heavy references to literature, to bar
poems in plain speech; the breadth of
this collection is where Catlin’s magic is contained. Extending beyond
the simple label of bar poet, Catlin’s
structure ranges from poems to prose, from short lines dripping down the
page to a Whitmanesque
cadence. As well, the subject material changes rapidly, from bar room
brawls to orchestral intimations, to
flinging forth Lorca into a poetic world different from his original
mechanized entity or Cavafy’s
Alexandria. Catlin writes as variously as possible.  He truly “does the
police in different voices.” In an age
where the gossamer-like loftiness of “finding your voice” is supposed to
be important, these poems flip
the bird.

    And yet, as with any good bartender, and I have seen him work,
Catlin’s a listener, in the active sense; he
hears that which is important in the voice, records the details, then
reports the evidence.  But there is an
additional element, a cautious measure creeping through most of these
poems. At any moment these poems
might turn on you, tear you apart, throw you out of the saloon or force
you to eat a pickled dyed red vienna
sausage. Be careless as a reader elsewhere; in short, be mindful, you
might feel something.

    These poems were chosen over many months of work where I would read
a few chapbooks, call Alan, tell
him my favorites, he would state his, then we worked out a general list.
As the reading time reached a close
and a clearer idea of the book length we were striving toward appeared,
some more material was added and
subtracted.

    Drunk and Disorderly was created because Catlin had over fifty
chapbooks published without a single
book length collection contributing to American Literature. With this
collection I hope to show how Alan
Catlin has been, and continues to be, an important poet whose work is
deserving of ready availablity.

--David Baratier



A single Catlin poem can be depended on for a quick fix, a little buzz
of realization achieved without
working out cryptograms or chasing allusions through Bullfinch. However,
most of the poems do a good
deal more than provide this vital, flaring recognition of some kind of
truth through metaphor or sharp
observance, but provide a richly textured vehicle for the insight.
—Janet McCann

Catlin’s structure ranges from poems to prose, from short lines dripping
down the page to a Whitmanesque
cadence. As well, the subject material changes rapidly, from bar room
brawls to orchestral intimations, to
flinging forth Lorca into a poetic world different from his original
mechanized entity or Cavafy’s
Alexandria. Catlin writes as variously as possible.  He truly “does the
police in different voices.”
—David Baratier

Alan Catlin is a poet with immense staying power. Drunk and Disorderly
is a selected poems covering more
than 20 years and 26 collections in which he writes with dark
perceptions ranging from a mentally ill
mother, to Garcia Lorca, Shelley,  Joyce, denizens of bars, Marianne
Moore and much more. These poems
are always skillfully composed and illuminated by the light of his
intelligence and wit.           —Laurel
Speer,  Small Press Review

              ISSUE

PAVEMENT SAW 8: THE MAN PO
   ALL MALE UNFINISHED AUTHOR INTERVIEW ISSUE


   We thought the Whitey Issue or the Minty Fresh Pirate Issue could not

be
   bested but in 2002 they were. But how does one possibly top the
Ultimate
   Issue?

   We were unsure but we were hoping with the help of one Anti-Laureate,

a
   Poet Laureate, and a bunch of masculine energy we might be able to
   figure it out.

   Because all journals should cantankerously define themselves, we will

   hereby dedicate this issue as the UNFINISHED MALE AUTHOR INTERVIEW
ISSUE
   or in more familiar terms: THE MAN PO.

   Besides what did we have to lose, tenure?

   Is this another masculine concept with deep critical implications?


   ----------
   An Excerpt of the Editor’s Note from The Greatest Literary Journal in

   the World

   Howdy.

   Unlike most of our recent issues which have had some form of an
   introduction holding the issue together, here we cannot begin to form

   any sort of cogency. For the past number of months we have been
sitting
   around, mail has arrived, the economy has gone into a slump, thefts
were
   committed, the mail load further increased due to aforementioned
   societal downturn, there was an increase in poems which violated the
   interns, the rejections turned nasty, and of all of this the most
   unfortunate occurrence was that no nameable theme surfaced. And how
   could we surpass the magnificence of our previous journal? With a
name
   like the Ultimate Issue we were doomed. Our sleeping schedules
changed,
   there were full brown outs during direct sunlight, we were getting
   depressed & tried everything—getting jobs, swimming in mall
fountains,
   fung shui,  listening to Devo, taking each other’s medication. Even
when
   our primary college, as reported recently in the New York Times,
voted
   to use the term “evolution”  rather than “changes over time” in
science
   courses, a real advancement for our city, for which we salute the
brave
   and avant guard decision of Ohio State University, it did not temper
our
   folly.

   The post-Ultimate depression was upon us. In another attempt to lift
our
   spirits, I created a subscription form for the Ultimate Issue (#7)
   worded in an ambiguous way. As a result, I have netted and kept
signed
   confessions from over 80 writers admitting they are Poor Poets. Some
of
   these writers have always stunk. These gave us many brief tee-hees,
but
   our only hope is that by fully admitting our worthiness for inclusion

   into the Cannon we will further display our center of attention
deficit
   disorder and extricate ourselves from moroseness.

   As the morose host, I have congealed a finery of chicanery for the
   issue.
   ---
   [ this area shows how to write negative reviews, supplies examples &
   encourages the process, some samples below]

   “The next time a mood strikes to read Italian Sonnets by a Turkish
   refugee, this is a must read!”
   “The spirit of overcoming others can hardly be overlooked in the poem

   ‘Trousers.’”

   ---
   We hope you will find solace and inspiration to write negative
reviews;
   all we ask for is a copy of the published essay.

   -----

   Another scandal, brought to my attention, and into my home, this
summer
   by an east coast poet, which shows as nearly as lame an area in need
of
   serious poetic attention, are exercises in poem writing manuals
   distributed to creative writing classes. Normally I am far removed
from
   viewing such suspect devices, but recently a skid of mostly unopened
   textbooks containing the offending material was hidden at my house
for a
   few days by a well known MFA program-teaching poet [read journal to
reveal
identity]working on doubling
   his income.

   ------

   We propose including other inventive techniques in these writing
guides
   so we can continue to have a staff, and to stop the proliferation of
   this infectious nonsense. I call these exercises Poetry Infliction
   Inhibitors.

   [various exercises originally here, the one below is my favorite--DB]

   4.) Write a poem based on fear. Wear a dark sweatshirt with a hood
large
   enough to cover your entire face when worn. This is called a “hoody.”

   Wear it with ground dragging jeans and expensive sneakers. Walk
around
   neighborhoods such as Mount Vernon and 20th in Columbus. For more
daring
   poems try walking the South Bronx nowhere near the Throgs Neck Bridge

or
   Diamond and 34th in Philly. Record your experience in line breaks
that
   reflect the use of breath you experience. As a variant, call yourself

   Uncle Sammy and wear a star spangled hoody in Arabic countries.

   -------

   Maybe, someday, if we meet, we can teach you the Secret Pavement Saw
   Handshake.

   Until then, Be well

   David Baratier, Editor, Pavement Saw Press
   -------------

   SAMPLE QUESTIONS FROM INTERVIEWS

   DB: Looking at the shelf of books you wrote I am wondering: why did
you
   write so many? Was it intentional? Vindictive?

   DB: Why is the Ronald Mc Donald House a good place to meet women?

   DB: What is a School of Continuation? Do you meet in secret locations

on
   the lower mountain side? Can I join?

   DB: In one of the earlier drafts of _Poet be like God: Jack Spicer
and
   the San Francisco Renaissance_  not only is Jess Collins portrayed as

   the evil anti-poet, usually referred to in the text only by his first

   name like Satan or Osama or Prince, but surprisingly, you are also
   treated in a similar manner. Since I am about to be roasted by a book

   that is as yet unpublished, and you appeared as a wonderful two named

   entity in the published Wesleyan edition, do you have any advice or
   techniques to share?


   DB: Back to religion and returning to the idea of a poem being
   pneumatic, rather than of breath, or to breathe in the way Olson
   suggested for the line, the poem works as a translocutor, and I would

   think pneumatolysis might be closer in kind. As if the poem is a
   doctrine, an intermediary of spirits between God and man, intended to

   inspire a movement from one condition to another. Care to comment?

I have put together a participation video (DVD) of based on my found
punctuation poetry. I did a live performance of found punctuation at Beyond
Baroque in 2002. Mary Berger published several concrete poems that I wrote
in Proliferation 5. The video has 4 short sections based on the punctuation
from Coleridge, Duchamp and others.

Looking for space to play this video performance.  You may also purchase
one and just play along.

I have two poems in Van Gogh's Ear. They are from my series Button, Hooks &
Eyes which is still unpublished. It is 40 poems juxtaposed against 40
photographs of belly buttons.

Robert Creeley’s reach across time and space was generous, and he touched
lives from one side of the planet to the other.

In a recent addition to Jacket 26, Robert Adamson, one of Australia’s
leading poets, reflects on a meeting with Creeley in Sydney in 1976, and the
intense literary and personal friendship that developed.

Art is a fluid moving above or over the minds of men.

Having violated one canon of modern prose by this metaphysical generality,  I
shall violate another. I shall make a florid and metaphorical  comparison.

Art or an art is not unlike a river, in that it is perturbed at times by  the
quality of the river bed, but is in a way independent of that bed. The color
of the water depends upon the substance of the bed and banks immediate and
preceding. Stationary objects are reflected, but the quality of motion is of
the  river. The scientist is concerned with all of these things, the artist with
that  which flows.

It is dawn at Jerusalem while midnight hovers above the Pillars of  Hercules.
All ages are contemporaneous. It is B.C., let us say, in Morocco. The  Middle
Ages are in Russia. The future stirs already in the minds of the few.  This
is especially true of literature, where the real time is independent of the
apparent, and where many dead men are our grandchildren's contemporaries*, while
 many of our contemporaries have been already gathered into Abraham's bosom,
or  some more fitting receptacle.

What we need is a literary scholarship, which will weigh Theocritus and
Yeats with one balance, and which will judge dull dead men as inexorably as dull
writers of today, and will, with equity, give praise to beauty before
referring  to an almanack . . .

Good art never bores one. By that I mean that it is the business of the
artist to prevent ennui; in the literary art, to relieve, refresh, revive the
mind of the reader - at reasonable intervals - with some form of ecstasy, by
some splendor of thought, some presentation of sheer beauty, some lightning turn
of phrase - laughter is no mean ecstasy. Good art begins with an escape from
dullness . . .

Art is vital only so long as it is interpretative, so long, that is, as it
manifests something which the artist perceives at greater intensity, and more
intimately, than his public. If he be the seeing man among the sightless, they
 will attend him only so long as his statements seem, or are proven, true. If
he  forsake this honor of interpreting, if he speak for the pleasure of
hearing his  own voice, they may listen for a while to the babble and to the sound
of the  painted words, but there comes, after a little, a murmur, a slight
stirring, and  then that condition which we see about us, disapproved as the
"divorce of art  and life."

The interpretive function is the highest honor of the arts, and because it
is so we find that a sort of hyper-scientific precision is the touchstone and
assay of the artist's power, of his honor, his authenticity. Constantly he
must  distinguish between the shades and the degrees of the ineffable.

*I find this statement fascinating, since my grand & greatgrandparents  were
contemporaries in the environs of Pound, Wisconsin where Thaddeus  Pound
(Ezra's grandfather) pursued his lumber empire, minted/printed his own  currency,
and held many political offices. Most biographers agree that Ezra  was greatly
influenced by his grandfather, i.e. his troubled and  controversial stance on
economics and politics which served as a river bed  for his brilliant
contribution to modern  poetry.

The U.S. gov't has decided to eliminate the annual terrorism report
with news that there were more terrorist attacks in 2004 than at any
time in history. This news comes when Bush administration
anti-terrorist initiatives are at an all time high as well. Instead of
focusing on what is being done wrong, the Bush administration decides
to do away with the reporting process altogether. Attacks against U.S.
forces in Iraq were not even included in the latest report.

Fresh from London's "Independent"
Some possibly very exciting news:


Decoded at last: the 'classical holy grail' that may rewrite the history of
the world

Scientists begin to unlock the secrets of papyrus scraps bearing long-lost
words by the literary giants of Greece and Rome
By David Keys and Nicholas Pyke

17 April 2005


For more than a century, it has caused excitement and frustration in equal
measure - a collection of Greek and Roman writings so vast it could redraw
the map of classical civilisation. If only it was legible.

Now, in a breakthrough described as the classical equivalent of finding the
holy grail, Oxford University scientists have employed infra-red technology
to open up the hoard, known as the Oxyrhynchus Papyri, and with it the
prospect that hundreds of lost Greek comedies, tragedies and epic poems will
soon be revealed.

In the past four days alone, Oxford's classicists have used it to make a
series of astonishing discoveries, including writing by Sophocles,
Euripides, Hesiod and other literary giants of the ancient world, lost for
millennia. They even believe they are likely to find lost Christian gospels,
the originals of which were written around the time of the earliest books of
the New Testament.

The original papyrus documents, discovered in an ancient rubbish dump in
central Egypt, are often meaningless to the naked eye - decayed, worm-eaten
and blackened by the passage of time. But scientists using the new
photographic technique, developed from satellite imaging, are bringing the
original writing back into view. Academics have hailed it as a development
which could lead to a 20 per cent increase in the number of great Greek and
Roman works in existence. Some are even predicting a "second Renaissance".

Christopher Pelling, Regius Professor of Greek at the University of Oxford,
described the new works as "central texts which scholars have been
speculating about for centuries".

Professor Richard Janko, a leading British scholar, formerly of University
College London, now head of classics at the University of Michigan, said:
"Normally we are lucky to get one such find per decade." One discovery in
particular, a 30-line passage from the poet Archilocos, of whom only 500
lines survive in total, is described as "invaluable" by Dr Peter Jones,
author and co-founder of the Friends of Classics campaign.

The papyrus fragments were discovered in historic dumps outside the
Graeco-Egyptian town of Oxyrhynchus ("city of the sharp-nosed fish") in
central Egypt at the end of the 19th century. Running to 400,000 fragments,
stored in 800 boxes at Oxford's Sackler Library, it is the biggest hoard of
classical manuscripts in the world.

The previously unknown texts, read for the first time last week, include
parts of a long-lost tragedy - the Epigonoi ("Progeny") by the 5th-century
BC Greek playwright Sophocles; part of a lost novel by the 2nd-century Greek
writer Lucian; unknown material by Euripides; mythological poetry by the
1st-century BC Greek poet Parthenios; work by the 7th-century BC poet
Hesiod; and an epic poem by Archilochos, a 7th-century successor of Homer,
describing events leading up to the Trojan War. Additional material from
Hesiod, Euripides and Sophocles almost certainly await discovery.

Oxford academics have been working alongside infra-red specialists from
Brigham Young University, Utah. Their operation is likely to increase the
number of great literary works fully or partially surviving from the ancient
Greek world by up to a fifth. It could easily double the surviving body of
lesser work - the pulp fiction and sitcoms of the day.

"The Oxyrhynchus collection is of unparalleled importance - especially now
that it can be read fully and relatively quickly," said the Oxford academic
directing the research, Dr Dirk Obbink. "The material will shed light on
virtually every aspect of life in Hellenistic and Roman Egypt, and, by
extension, in the classical world as a whole."

The breakthrough has also caught the imagination of cultural commentators.
Melvyn Bragg, author and presenter, said: "It's the most fantastic news.
There are two things here. The first is how enormously influential the
Greeks were in science and the arts. The second is how little of their
writing we have. The prospect of having more to look at is wonderful."

Bettany Hughes, historian and broadcaster, who has presented TV series
including Mysteries of the Ancients and The Spartans, said: "Egyptian
rubbish dumps were gold mines. The classical corpus is like a jigsaw puzzle
picked up at a jumble sale - many more pieces missing than are there.
Scholars have always mourned the loss of works of genius - plays by
Sophocles, Sappho's other poems, epics. These discoveries promise to change
the textual map of the golden ages of Greece and Rome."

When it has all been read - mainly in Greek, but sometimes in Latin, Hebrew,
Coptic, Syriac, Aramaic, Arabic, Nubian and early Persian - the new material
will probably add up to around five million words. Texts deciphered over the
past few days will be published next month by the London-based Egypt
Exploration Society, which financed the discovery and owns the collection.

A 21st-century technique reveals antiquity's secrets

Since it was unearthed more than a century ago, the hoard of documents known
as the Oxyrhynchus Papyri has fascinated classical scholars. There are
400,000 fragments, many containing text from the great writers of antiquity.
But only a small proportion have been read so far. Many were illegible.

Now scientists are using multi-spectral imaging techniques developed from
satellite technology to read the papyri at Oxford University's Sackler
Library. The fragments, preserved between sheets of glass, respond to the
infra-red spectrum - ink invisible to the naked eye can be seen and
photographed.

The fragments form part of a giant "jigsaw puzzle" to be reassembled.
Missing "pieces" can be supplied from quotations by later authors, and
grammatical analysis.

Key words from the master of Greek tragedy

Speaker A: . . . gobbling the whole, sharpening the flashing iron.

Speaker B: And the helmets are shaking their purple-dyed crests, and for the
wearers of breast-plates the weavers are striking up the wise shuttle's
songs, that wakes up those who are asleep.

Speaker A: And he is gluing together the chariot's rail.

These words were written by the Greek dramatist Sophocles, and are the only
known fragment we have of his lost play Epigonoi (literally "The Progeny"),
the story of the siege of Thebes. Until last week's hi-tech analysis of
ancient scripts at Oxford University, no one knew of their existence, and
this is the first time they have been published.

Sophocles (495-405 BC), was a giant of the golden age of Greek civilisation,
a dramatist who work alongside and competed with Aeschylus, Euripides and
Aristophanes.

His best-known work is Oedipus Rex, the play that later gave its name to the
Freudian theory, in which the hero kills his father and marries his mother -
in a doomed attempt to escape the curse he brings upon himself. His other
masterpieces include Antigone and Electra.

Sophocles was the cultured son of a wealthy Greek merchant, living at the
height of the Greek empire. An accomplished actor, he performed in many of
his own plays. He also served as a priest and sat on the committee that
administered Athens. A great dramatic innovator, he wrote more than 120
plays, but only seven survive in full.

Last week's remarkable finds also include work by Euripides, Hesiod and
Lucian, plus a large and particularly significant paragraph of text from the
Elegies, by Archilochos, a Greek poet of the 7th century BC.

Alan,

Keep spreading this meme of yours. There is an abundance of poetry that's
entertaining enough for the common reader. Your exquisitely contemporary poetry
pardons you any elitism you may unconsciously harbor. When a poet such as
yourself grasps the most revolutionary innovations of his day (computers,
internet, media, quantum world) and merges them so individually, your poetry  will
necessarily challenge the boundaries. I find it titillating, but then  again,
I'm just a poets' groupie. The internet has made possible an EveryPerson
interest in writing and reading poetry which is what many artists have feared  was
gone forever. All of it can't be great art, and not everyone purchases or
supports artists, but the value of art itself, its ability to dignify and
revive is alive and well.

The riverbed and banks have changed forever.

Mary Jo

a bridge so far

"Hand in hand in hand to start,
we find and name our changing place,
while our threefold surging  heart
pulses wisdom through our space.

Beneath our triple starlit gaze
our cosmos lays both wild and free;
set spinning by our lovers' play,
where touching brought it all to be.

Each in turn takes wisdom's part -
to hold each two, and know as one.
And in this turning lovers' art -
what was not thought is soon begun."



seemed so perfect    on paper
ancient configuration
almost always lapses
into a closed-for-repairs circle
returns to parallel lines
where hoping for improbable intersections
impassible
you brought in a third
alien other lost on line
schism no chrism to anoint your holy hope pure genesis
exigent genius
but i made the distance greater
to discover if real can be
on rare occasion out of sight of bodies
if text and reader conspire eternally
if like poles repel
in and out of black holes



"Every sinew stretching tight, arching toward the piercing  light
Stricken in the dance we share, crackling fingers, singing  hair
Lightening splits the little death, before the thunder of our  breath


Whirling in our countless forms, howling out in drunken storms
A single  tear's a driven rain, a single kiss, a boundless gain
Where the valley  touches plow, gardens freshen green and now

In the quietness of being, three awoke me into seeing
Everything I am  that's now, I show myself to see just how
Now to face the darkening sky, with  a bright agreeing eye"

School

Sat in the back of the class with my hand up/Two wild security guards,
grabbed my man up/Threw him in detention for 5 days suspensio/Cuz he
said, the teacher was lyin about the Indians...I stood like a man then I
questioned my teacher/Why don't we speak about the wisdom of the
sages?/And how did Europe black out in the dark ages? And when they got
light did they white-wash the pages? ..And why it seems that half the
school is racist?


Intro: sample]
What are you doing home from school so early?
You shouldn't be back for another two hours
Now answer me... what are you doing home?
(I got suspended) Suspended? For what?
(Nothing) A good student like you, don't get suspended for nothing
Now why were you sent home? (Cuz I'm black!)

[Masta Killa]
Bangin' on the lunchroom table, I used to spectate
And watch some of the M.C. greats
Throw verses back and forth, I didn't have the heart to step forth
I used to take it home to write some of my own
But still I wasn't ready to touch the mic-phone
The back staircases of school was filled with blunt residue
A broken lightbulb and the crew, a man or two
Bangin' on the wall while a few M.C.'s, shoot the breeze
I'm just passin' through, I might've took two off the trees
We fiend for this hip hop quarantine
Listen out for the walkie talkies of the Dean (security coming...)
*beat switch*

[RZA]
Bododo.. school!
Sat in the back of the class with my hand up
Two wild security guards, grabbed my man up
Threw him in detention for 5 days suspension
Cuz he said, the teacher was lyin about the Indians
Tryin to dumb us with the story of Columbus
And brain-numb us, when all you see, that came from us
They copy-carvin, I learned about God and
Taggin Wu logo on the book margin
Intense like a New York riot, she stood quiet
And asked me, could she speak to me in private
(Mr. Diggs, you actin' like a fool...) Huh?
(You know these rules that we have in these schools) Yeah..
(You and your friends think ya'll cool) Why?
(Cuz ya'll walk through these halls with the 12 jewels)
Phat shoe laces and tri-colored sneakers
I stood like a man then I questioned my teacher
Why don't we speak about the wisdom of the sages?
And how did Europe black out in the dark ages?
And when they got light did they white-wash the pages?
And the inquisition, why was Christian thrown in cages?
And why wuld they try to destroy the nation?
With their birth control and bring control floridation?
And why it seems that half the school is racist?
She said "Diggs, to the office!" We about faces..

[Masta Killa]
Handed my paper with the proper title
Who wrote the holy Koran or Bible?
Bein' that person with the scent ability
Makes me responsible for the uncivil
The next morning as I entered the building
A cypher goin' on and the Gods is building
My hot chocolate spillin', after 5th period
Let's cut out, go bag some chicks up at Tilden
Wonderful had the rental, "Nobody Beats the Biz"
Instrumental, attractin' a few
Nothin' really poppin', let's slide to Clara Barton
Bumped into a few good brothers from Morgas Martin
Mentioned Norman Thomas, had chicks
That'll hit flicks, and take you shopping, true indeed
I thought Sarah J. had the one that I need
Mary Burtrum, Julia Richmond, is it fashion?
Elijah Whitney sing the song with me
Sisters from Washington Irv. swing a arm
Brothers in death, pull the fire alarm
Rude ones flow rapness, Western House money makers
Maxwell thunder hip shakers..

[Outro: 2Pac sample]
They not on my level, but I can sit with the O.G.'s from there
And make it major, youknowhatimean? (That's what's nigga)
Right, but, we not doing that until we get this business settled
And even while we doing that, we try'nna get the Wu-Tang niggaz
Cuz I love them niggaz, I feel as though
They represent the east coast, how we represent the west coast
And I love them... *echoes*

I was sitting in a bar room once,
        passing conversation
                when the Man said:
                       "You heeled?"

Christ, you have to be joking.
        This was Glasgow.

I tried to hijack a Securicor van once, and the shotgun guard (who was about
the age of me then, late teens early twenties) was slavering to arrest me,
but the driver didn't even bother to look up from the book he was reading --
Kant? -- but simply said, "Christ, jimmy, for all I know he's sitting beside
my daughter in the Moral Philosphy lectures, so if we bust him, I'll never
hear the end of it."

    A level playing-field.

            Bliss it was and all that crap.

                        Fun.

Strelnikov.

WORKSHOPS

THE WORKING WRITER SEMINAR, with Kathryn Radeff
Three Saturday mini-workshops: April 9, April 23, May 7 12 p.m. - 4 p.m.
Single Saturday Session: $50, $40 for members

Mini workshops are fun, fast-paced, informational and inspirational. In an
easy-to-understand manner, the sessions present the fundamentals of creative
writing as they apply to fact-based articles and personal experience, as
well as the craft of fiction. Lectures and writing exercises, which are used
to illustrate the concepts, are aimed at developing the writers'
understanding of structure, description, dialogue, character, style and
voice. Workshops also cover the art of writing query letters, research and
interviewing techniques, manuscript preparation and submission strategies.
Ideal for the beginner and skilled writer, mini-day workshops provide an
excellent overview of their fields. The goal is to have an article or short
story well underway by the time the session ends. An extensive analysis of
one completed piece is included. There will be one 30-minute break. The
workshop includes a question and answer session.

actually is has to do with Roger Ailes (of Fox News Infamy). In 1992 when Clinton was Running against Bush the First he decided that Republicans are Red because they are macho red meat kind of guys while Democrats are Blue go figure?

My best guess is that it's conservative nostalgia for the British Empire,
which makes the rest of us pretty blue.

I think maybe the color designations were chosen so as
radiate NO connotations.

The Wikipedia article on "red states & blue states"
indicates that blue and red, as "national colors"
deriving from the U.S. flag, have long been used by
USAmerican media outlets in election maps, but that
before 2000 there was no stability as to which color
meant which party.  However in 2000 a lot of outlets
were using red for the Republicans and blue for the
Democrats and it became ubiquitous and proverbial.

And I'm guessing that in a country like the U.S. where
anything "socialistic" is anathema, many outlets felt
that they were avoiding the appearance of
"red-baiting" by not using red for the Democrats.

If you haven't noticed, our peerless (i.e, lacking vision or people low
enough to be his equal) leader has turned our language and thinking upside
down. In the Cold War, the Russian were Reds, the bad guys, the people who
advocated total government control. Now, the Republicans, having "won" the
Cold War, have become Big Government (totalitarianism hiding behind
conservative rhetoric). When you realize these new Reds are worse than the
old ones ever were (except for Stalin, arguably), you could feel pretty blue
regardless of your location. Welcome to the Age of Newspeak.

A James Purdy Tribute Reading: Moe's Villa and Other Stories

   - Tuesday, April 19
   - 7:30 PM

Kevin Killian, Ian Phillips, Chris Nealon, Regina Marler and Larry
Rinder will read from Moe's Villa and Other Stories, James Purdy's
first short story collection in over a decade. A literary cult hero,
James Purdy's exquisitely surreal fiction has been populated for more
than 40 years by social outcasts living in crisis and longing for
love. His acclaimed first novel Malcolm won praise from writers as
diverse as Dame Edith Sitwell, Dorothy Parker, Marianne Moore, and
Gore Vidal, while his later books, from the award-winning Eustace
Chisholm and the Works to In a Shallow Grave influenced new
generations of authors from Dennis Cooper to Paul Russell.

The Paintings of Fernando Botero
Fighting Torture with Art

By MIKE WHITNEY

Seattle, Washington

The Columbian artist Fernando Botero has produced a brilliant collection of
life-sized paintings depicting the horrors of Abu Ghraib. The works show
prisoners bound and gagged, stacked on top of each other, and being beaten
by American soldiers. The paintings have a haunting, frenzied feeling to
them, like Pieter Bruegel's medieval "The Triumph of Death" (1562) where the
artist conjures up a scene of armies clashing while wagon-loads of skulls
are carried across an apocalyptic-looking landscape.

Abu Ghraib is the entryway into that same world, faithfully reproduced in
detail by George Bush. We're fortunate to have men like Botero to shine a
light on the real machinery of Bush's terror-apparatus. Already, 100,000
Iraqis have died in a gratuitous act of aggression, entire cities have been
flattened and 17,000 Iraqis languish in overcrowded gulags waiting for an
improbable turn-of-events. Botero captures the look of desperation on men's
faces when there is no expectation of justice. He confronts his audience
with the bloody stanchions that support the new world order and the
increasing number of innocent victims required to keep them upright. This
isn't the stuff you'll see in the media, where America's war crimes are
concealed behind a heavy lacquer of flowery rhetoric and optimistic
predictions. These pictures are the real deal, like the grinding violence
and humiliation produced by a brutal occupation.

Do American's know that 22 Iraqis were killed yesterday "when U.S.
helicopters and heavy artillery bombarded houses in al-Rummana village?
Seven children, six women and three old men were among the dead." (Al
Jazeera) Their house was leveled. None of them had any connection to the
insurgency. They were simply collateral damage in yet another errant
American bombing raid.

This is just one of the unrecorded crimes that takes place in Iraq on a
daily basis without the slightest attention from the western press and
without a word of protest from Bush's rubber-stamp Congress. For the most
part, the cameras are turned off in Iraq unless enough footage can be pieced
together to show our brave, young warriors bringing democracy to unwashed.

Do American's realize that the UN released a report this week that shows
that the number children suffering from malnutrition in Iraq has actually
doubled since the war began 2 years ago. This means that the misery of the
average child is actually greater than it was during America's genocidal
sanctions-regime, when an estimated 500,000 Iraqi children died, mostly from
preventable diseases, to achieve America's goal of regime change. (It is
interesting to note that Colin Powell referred to the death of 70,000
Sudanese as "genocide". Sudan has a population of 48 million. In Iraq the US
is responsible for at least 600,000 deaths in a population of 25 million. By
Powell's standards that would be double- or triple-genocide)

Torture, bombing, starvation.these are the foundation blocks of America's
Iraq policy, not the empty blather about democracy and liberation. Let's
hear Bush offer a few choice words about God's work in Falluja, where
"combat-aged" males were barricaded in the town so they could be peppered
with cluster bombs and napalm. Or, perhaps he can brighten his oratory with
anecdotes about prisoners rotting away in his string of concentration camps
that are now scattered across Iraq. This is what makes Botero's work is so
valuable; it strips away the pretense and shows the ghoulish face that
operates behind the mask.

Picasso's masterpiece "Guernica" has galvanized generations to the horrors
of war. Botero's paintings will undoubtedly have the same affect. His work
shows in the plainest terms a world that has been knocked off its axis by
Washington's bloodlust. This is what the world looks like when the law has
been jettisoned and men are subjected to the willfulness of megalomaniacs.
Torture is never extraneous; it reflects the very heart of a regime. So it
is with the Bush administration.

Botero's paintings show us the violence that animates the Bush government
and portends an increasingly uncertain future for us all. They're worth a
look.

Praise for The Singing Fish:

"Peter Markus' gorgeously spare, riverine fables of brotherly sweetness and
violence are hypnotic, haunting, and sublime.
--GARY LUTZ, author of Stories in the Worst Way and I Looked Alive

"There is an obsessive quality about Peter Markus' writing that I am
obsessed with and a musicality that I cannot get out of my head. The fish
are singing and Peter Markus is too."

Subject:      rhubarb is susan
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII

Dear all,

I used to be a member of UBP many (six, now!) years ago, when I was
working out in PR and our internet traffic was run over packet radio. It's
great to be back again.

I thought I would announce two projects: one, a blog-journal dedicated to
reviewing individual poems from various online journals. The blog is
rhubarb is susan, and you can find it at

http://rhubarbissusan.blogspot.com

It's been running for a few months now. Recent reviews have taken up poems
from La Petite Zine, Jacket, Kulture Vulture, Conjunctions, Exquisite
Corpse, the East Village, Pom Pom, &c &c.

Secondly, I have just released a rather unusual project: "SWAN : a love
story." It is described fully here

http://rhubarbissusan.blogspot.com/2006/04/swan-love-story.html

and is available for free online in PDF format. It is an aleatory piece,
however, meant to be read in random order found by shuffling the thirty
cards it's printed on. I am selling (at cost) hardcopies on archival
cardstock for $9.99, including shipping, which you can buy by following
the link above.

Thanks again,

Simon

If I can't the be the pope, then I want to be M.I.A.

Or Tiffany Teen.

Or Corky Gonzales's ring partner.

If you know who Corky Gonzalez is, then you know more of me than I  knew.

I like imagining George Stanley as Robin B's Cardinal & Charge d'Affaire.
Peter Quartermain could probably find a cabinet position here, too, tho I
suspect Peter would refuse Cardinalism on principle.
Vancouver as the new Rome?

I read a piece by Jonathan Freedland in the UK Guardian online today:
'War: the great unknown among election issues' --
http://www.guardian.co.uk/antiwar/story/0,12809,1462197,00.html

It didn't say anything new or surprising, but I felt the need to
scribble...

Gerard



O Tony


You're a fucking liar
you're a fucking liar
and everybody knows it
but that's alright, that's OK
but you're a murderer
you're a killer

O Tony, Antonio, Tone, Tone-ay

You look ever more ruined
like a trumpet-eared imp
like a sinister puppet
from the Day of the Dead
yes it's all gone to shit
hasn't it

O Tony, Antonio, Tone, Tone-ay

O you must have been
an insufferable little squit
strait-laced, righteous
eager to be liked
piously arrogant
with cleverness and Christ

O Tony, Antonio, Tone, Tone-ay

The sudden buffet of blood
thin liquor of flesh
tacky and thick
mixed with brick-dust and sweat
it's all over you
you're steeped in it

O Tony, Antonio, Tone, Tone-ay

Down, down
beneath sombre pall
the reek of blood
from the evil soil
that gleams in the grievous light
like oil

O Tony, Antonio, Tone, Tone-ay

Down, down
there it murkily spreads
the doleful region
of blood-taint and dread
where lugubrious shades
moaning lament

O Tony, Antonio, Tone, Tone-ay

You're a fucking liar
you're a fucking liar
and everybody knows it
but that's alright, that's OK
but you're a murderer
you're a killer

O Tony, Antonio, Tone, Tone-ay

Mr. Savage,

I was wondering if you still had room in the workshop
this Sunday?  If so, I'd be interested in bringing
$10, a poem, and some skills in critique (depending on
how you run your workshops, of course).

thanks,

Oh my, I'd LOVE to be  cardinal, yes, in the first church of Popish Poets.
Robin Blaser would be the holy boss, of course, and I'd be his honcho.
George (Stanley) would have to take a slomewhat junior position. I'd sell

I like imagining George Stanley as Robin B's Cardinal & Charge d'Affaire.
Peter Quartermain could probably find a cabinet position here, too, tho I
suspect Peter would refuse Cardinalism on principle.
Vancouver as the new Rome?

Anybody from Philly here I don't know yet, or have lost touch with---

I'm desperately trying to set up a gig in Philadelphia for SUNDAY JUNE 5th

I'm doing a poetry reading at St. Marks on Wednesday June 8th,
and my band, Continuous Peasant, will be playing
Washington DC, Baltimore, Brooklyn, NYC, Boston, Albany
but we're still trying to fill two nights---
one of which I'd really like to play in PHILLY, being that I used to live
there,
and still know many people there, but it's proving to be difficult
and I'm starting to think I should try, like NEW HOPE instead....

But if anybody knows anybody who might know some venue we could play at
in PHILLY, I'd really appreciate it....

Then there's also the question of Northampton, Providence, etc....
But I'll leave that one for now.

Please backchannel me if you can...

thanks,
Chris

mon ami..cowboy "jim" l'artiste...

      the monitor works because patterns of light and
dark can be "etched", or stored, in the material of the photosensitive
coating on the back of a cathode ray T.V. tube. The information can be created and
retrieved by beaming electrons which "excite" the particles of the coating.
Patterns are determined by mathematical equations of ones and zeros ( one is for
bright, zero for dim). Kind of like morse code radio transmitting. It's based
on pattern recognition.  Jim

Michael,

My take on the color thing is more esoteric or mystical. Red is agressive
energy, fiercely active with an almost fundamentalist axe to grind and to  lower
guillotine like onto the bluenecks, the gentle more pacific  folks who use
words instead of swords and fraudulent vote counters. Popes,  contrary to all
appearances, are very agressive, moreso now with words than  swords; because
afterall Vatican City is properly armed anymore or calls on  France or Germany to
do its dirty work. Red Popes like Red Queens tend to  cleave as in cleave
apart, whereas Blue Poets tend to cleave and need the buddy  system to survive.
The only good pope is a poet, a heretic, a cloven-foot  Pan, hubric with human
dignity.

"The Specific Incendiaries of Springtime"
  by Lisa Jarnot

Inside of my inspection house there are
things I am inside of lacking only linens
and the tiniest of birds, there are small ideas
of tiny birds and things they are inside of,
in the middle of the small ideas of genius
we began inside of sundown,

I am hiding from relationships of springtime
in the tiny rooms with tiny birds, and there
are functions of relations, there are
springtimes,
there are tiny birds and checkbooks and some
farmteams,

I am wanting only lemons where you have
wanted only linens in the center of the room,
I am waking up in long corroded rooms,
near Bakersfield and farmteams, in the vivid
dreams of rain, having dominion over these
animals and the salesmen on an island in
relationships with shepherd girls who carry
soft umbrellas,

Toward sundown, let me say that I am in
your absence forced to read a smallish book,
to read ideas of farmteams in the twilight
in the spring, where on an uninhabited
island I strangled all the shepherd girls and
then became a smallish book, and doused
the bed with kerosene he sleeps in doused
with birds and twilight books I dreamt of in
relations of the springtime that I dream,

Of farmteams, clearly let me say of sheep
and clearly let me say of spring in Bakersfield,
where I have strangled all the sheep and
several shepherds, where to read ideas
of twilight in a book, today, to a new love,
where in briefly retouched currency, functions
of inspections in the house now lacking lemons,
here I strangled all the shepherd girls and
birds,

Where I read ideas of twilight to a newer love,
where the genius of liberty we began in the
middle toward sundown was a smallish bird
in spring outside of Bakersfield, where,
on an uninhabited island, to the twilight
of this genius in the book, to the mouthpiece of
the smallest sunlit bird, of the farmteam in
corroded blue relations, of ideas and in
inspection blocks, of occuring in the middle
of the twilight, of the dreams of smallest books
and salesmen inside Bakersfield, of wanting
only linens having wanted only wicker in
the center of the room,

I am a soldier of this wicker chair, I am
brandishing a welding torch and drill,
I am the island with the shepherds and the
sheep, I am waking up in Bakersfield in
rain, in a long corroded room, near the
farmteams in the vivid dreams of rain,
and in turning in the kerosene being slowly
doused in fire, I am, toward sunlight,
strangled by a shepherd girl, I am a salesman
of the islands of this currency,

Of rain, let the farmteams in relations
with the springtime in the checkbooks
find the rain, corroded I am, wanting only
lemons, only linens and then you, let me say
that you are on an island with umbrellas,
that we are woken in a room of springtime
birds, that nowhere is a smallish book,
and in the twilight reach dominions of our
liberty.


"YoU"
by Andrea Selch

Because I spent all night
dancing with you
I said last night's prayers
this afternoon

And then this evening
when you were—who knows—
at your home? and I
was here alone, thinking could this love
be true? I found myself

with folded hands, praying anew:
what should I do? what should I do?
After the one-two one-two
of all night dancing with you,
what else could I do?

Oh you honey dew
come back soon. Who cares
if it's true but while it's new
I'd rather my two hands
were full of you.

I would vote for Artaud -- he of the open letter declaring "war on
you, Pope dog."  That way the whole notion of a Pope would be duly
torpedoed.

By the way, nobody's appreciated the fact that between the death of
the previous pope and the all-too-swift selection of the next, the
world was just...a...little...bit...freer.

Belladonna* is a feminist/innovative reading and publication series that
promotes the work of women writers who are adventurous, experimental,
politically involved, multi-form, multicultural, multi-gendered,

work that is experimental in form, connects with other art forms, and is
socially/politically active in content. Alongside the readings, Belladonna*
supports its artists by publishing commemorative pamphlets of their work on
the night of the event. Please contact us (Erica Kaufman, Rachel Levitsky et
al) at belladonnaseries@yahoo.com to receive a catalog and be placed on our

Subject:      Leon Golub--tribute report
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; format=flowed

hey it is such a gorgeous day and yesterday was lovely and bittersweet.  I
went to the Memorial for Leon Golub at The Great Hall at Cooper Union, an
apt place.  It was packed despite the idiotic sight lines.  As we were
finding a place to sit, slides of Leon in his studio, on the street, etc.
were shown as early 20th century German music played. I had to keep from
singing along with Lotte Lenya.
Nancy Spero who is terribly thin walked with the help of family and friends.
  She has an Ebony wood cane with a silver top--a woman's head w/ flowing
hair.  If I had a cane, it would have a wolf's head, but maybe the woman
with the flowing hair is a wolf.

When she got to the podium to thank like everybody in the world, we all
stood up.  As she said "that's for Leon." And it was, and of course for her.
  The sentimentalists amongst us and there are more than anyone wants to
claim have always admired Leon and Nancy--their wit, wisdom, fire and flash
and of course their togetherness through thick, thin and everything in
between.  Their children and grandchildren were all there too.

There were the usual coterie of speakers--colleagues, critics, helpmates
(Samm the studio assistant) and poets (Clayton Eshleman) who praised the
painter, told anecdotes, made sometimes truly heartfelt statements esp.
Phong Bui and Samm again.  But what made it a true Golub tribute was Robert
Storr's impassioned ambivalence.  That he walked about his relationship with
Golub from a range of perspectives: fellow painter, critic, museum curator,
and art scholar and how each of those perspectives was challenged in the
relationship in different kinds of ways were fascinating.  Most tellingly,
it is as curator and scholar that Storr has the most difficulty, not
personally but institutionally.  As he pointed out that as of this time,
only the Brooklyn Museum owns a major Golub painting and no other New York
City-based museum has one.  Plus, art scholarship appears uninterested.

I find this fascinating.  As a poet, I found Golub's work fascinating.  I
did not as a viewer feel complicitous in the awful acts depicted in some of
his paintings--brutality, organized brutality is not new nor is only in the
province of the nation you despise at the moment (the U.S. South Africa,
Chile, Russia, etc.)  I think of Golub as a true moralist--a man who sought
justice and had to share the truth of corrupt power so that "the hue and
cry" of the angry, oppressed and just plain pissed off might demand
something better.  And yes, these things don't always happen.  Golub was not
a Quixote like person.  He was well aware of how much his work, his
activism, his principles mattered.  Resistance is one thing.  Making a world
that continues to delight and dare until one is very old is another.  And he
made that world.  Two films, one by Charlie Ahearn; the other from
Katemequin Films showed that clearly. I went to Leon's last show at Ron
Feldman where he not only showed his big paintings, but also these very
sexy, funny erotic drawings.  The man had verve.

The moments when I wish I was really rich and powerful are the moments when
people say so and so's work can't sell or is not important enough for the
major collections of American museums.  The fact that only in the past
decade or so has there been real interest in African American artists work;
that South Americans were added to the "narrative' about post-WWII art; that
women of all colors, sizes and shapes who were not Georgia O'Keefe are now
seriously collected is amazing.  We live in a country whose cultural
apparatus remains too narrow, too smug, too pleased with its capacity to
consume, co-opt, or dismiss.  I am not a gatekeeper, but you know there's
plenty going on in and outside of all gates and sometimes the gates
shift--yeah and they are orange too.

New York is a tough town in many ways, but often a great place for artists.
Even the most successful of us are never just quite sure of where we fit and
that discomfort is a good thing, like the grit that creates the pearl in an
oyster.

I had three abortions and removed my feeding tube twice, all while wearing
a condom. I also preached liberation theology--the last guy loved it in
Poland, outlawed it in the Americas. It was a lot for three days, but hell,
I've had crazier weekends and not felt nearly so free of sin.

Oh, and Artaud would get my vote, too, and not only because he's dead, tho
I expect that would make the task easier for him to take on--I don't think
the dead are ever sworn to celibacy.

In the Dominican place where I take lunch every day--today pernil asado y
flan despues--the usual cacaphony included the announcement of Ratzinger on
Spanish tv. His words were drowned out by the jukebox, playing a catchy
little latino dance number called Alleluia that could have been a

Since the great thinkers and poets of the 20th Century are simply dying
to fast for a proper tribute, we're just going to muddle along in agony
at www.UnlikelyStories.org. April's multimedia issue includes:

Four drawings by Claudio Parentela
Three paintings by Papa Osmubal
Three songs by Alex Welsh
"Strawberry Spring," a horror music video by Andrei Bakhurin
and "Do-It-Yourself Beer," an illustrated pamphlet by Julie and Sarah

The new pope is a Benedict! Cthulhu sleeps!

Thanks for this lovely account, Patricia.

Long time no see, but obviously we are both 'virtually'
 still here!

Just happened to tv flip on a 'lovely' video of the atomic bomb and military
based work of Patrick Nagatani's installations. Another guy on the outside

Actually, technically, that is contrary to the faith and could lead to
damnation, unless of course the orgasm resulted from an inflow of grace. An
orgasm with the holy spirit is fine

But be understanding - these people had endured many days of knowing there
was no one person telling them to keep their hands out of their pockets and
think only pure thoughts. They get off on that.

And then came the news. The conclave was slipping its key in the lock to
bring them a new papa. Course they found it erotic

Another post here urges "Celebrate the climax of Poetry Month with Andrei
Codrescu"

Robin Blaser was a great idea for pope. About the only thing'd make me
rejoin the RCs

Oh well, back to poetry

dear friends & family,

as many of you know, i have been volunteering for arts for art, the
umbrella organization for the vision festival, for some time now. "what's
the vision festival, much less arts for art," some of you may inquire?
www.visionfestival.org says much; i'll say it is the signal locus and
grassroots presentaing organization for the avant jazz community in new
york, which ultimately means the avant jazz community on the planet
earth.

as you may not be aware -- and the series low attendance may bear this
out -- the vision folks have been putting together a club series every
saturday at the marvelous clemente soto velez community art center on the
lower east side, famed, among other reasons, for being the former public
school ornette coleman purchased for artist's house in the 80's. you
couldn't ask for a better pedigree, or more supportive arts presenter,
for the music exemplified by the vision festival.

but, if nights where only five paying customers bother to show up
continue, the series, and one more venue for vital experimental music,
will disappear from new york city. i'm confident this a consummation
devoutly to be unwished by the wide majority of people on this e-mail.

please -- forward this note, mention the series, encourage/cajole your
familiars into coming out for a show or two over the next few weeks --
this saturday's show promises to be superb, as they generally are. and,
by all means, come out yourself! this music, and the vision which
continues to insipre and be inspired by this exceptionally inspirational
music, neeeds your support...NOW!

thanks, you all -- sure hope to see you this saturday, and thereafter.
peace unto you, and us all. jk

The Vision Club Series

9:30pm Tatsuya Nakatani / Billy Bang Duo
11pm Andrew Bemkey / Andrew Barker Duo

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

AT Clemente Soto Velez - 107 Suffolk St. @ Rivington



Tickets available at the door. Sets are $10 each or $15 for both shows
plus a 1 drink minimum



9:30pm: Tatsuya Nakatani, percussion; Billy Bang, violin
"[Nakatani] is capable of a wide range of sounds and qualities, and is
always fully present, neither lagging behind nor rushing ahead. His work
dances full of thought with an overall easy clarity and earthy
groundedness." Maria Klein, Boss-Improv
"Bang improvises lines that might have been lifted straight from a George
Crumb composition, yet he invests them with an emotionalism and
spontaneity that is unique to jazz. Whether in the abstract (as a solo
violinist, elaborating on skeletal melodic material) or as part of a
greater whole (with Sun Ra's Arkestra, for example), a Bang performance
is always awash with surprise." Chris Kelsey, All Music Guide
   Tatsuya Nakatani is a percussionist whose work encompasses a variety
of musical genres. Since his arrival in New York in 1995, Nakatani has
performed with groups that run the gamut of the creative music scenes of
New York: free jazz, avant rock, experimental, ambient, you name it.
Within such diversity, Nakatani has developed his most fruitful avenues
of expression in his own studio in the South Bronx, a well known space
among musicians and a workshop from which he dispatches his musical
creations to the world.
   Nakatani¹s eclecticism will prove an interesting match for master
violinist Billy Bang ­ himself no stranger to diverse musical styles. As
a veteran of New York¹s loft scene, Bang has pursued various musical
approaches from straight-ahead jazz to contemporary composition, to
conduction to free improvisation. The uniting factors of Bang¹s work are
his dazzling virtuosity and his consistently soulful and the swinging
approach which permeates his performances.
   Bang and Nakatani have collaborated a number of times in the past two
years. With musicians of this ability and caliber, one never knows where
the music might end up.


11pm: Andrew Bemkey, bass clarinet; Andrew Barker, drums

"Andrew Bemkey is a musician who honors the tradition, knows and loves
the music of the masters, and doesn't sound like anyone ever heard
before." allaboutjazz.com
   Andrew Bemkey came to New York to study and perform creative music in
the early 90¹s. Fresh out of high school, Bemkey pursued jazz under the
tutelage of three master musicians: Jaki Byard, Makanda Ken McIntyre and
Reggie Workman. Spurred on by such creative forces, Bemkey quickly rose
to prominence as one commanding pianists of the downtown scene playing
with Billy Bang, Roy Campbell, Reggie Workman. By 2000, Bemkey was the
youngest bandleader asked to lead a group at that year¹s Vision Festival.

In recent years, Bemkey has expanded his musical arsenal by beginning to
double on bass clarinet, utilizing an impressive technique which rivals
his piano chops. Tonight, Bemkey¹s bass clarinet skills will move to the
foreground matched with the drums of Andrew Barker.

Christophe,
No library I've ever visited has had an adequate representation of the =
works of ted joans...look for these:

A Black Pow Wow of Jazz Poems
Afordisia
All of T.J. and No More
Beat Poems
Double Trouble
Funky Jazz Poems
The Hipsters
The Truth

Of course, all are out of print and aren't going to be easy to find, but =
they will add a valuable resource to your collection.=20
 =20
I'm of the opinion that ted's works too often are ignored.=20

Subject:      Bloggers respond to Elsewhere comic
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; format=flowed

Given the 3-4 month lag-time of comics distribution, the first issue of
Elsewhere won't hit comic book stores until August. (I'm guessing most of
you don't frequent comics shops, anyway.) Until then it can be ordered via
PayPal at

http://garysullivan.blogspot.com

or by e-mailing me and requesting my mailing address to send checks, money
orders or well-concealed cash. If you are interested in a review copy,
please e-mail me.

What follows are from unsolicited blog posts on the book from a host of
bloggers.

JORDAN DAVIS, http://equanimity.blogspot.com
"So inspiring I nearly passed out and started a publishing company.
Beautiful full-color card cover, and some of Gary's finest work between the
boards. In awe."

SHANNA COMPTON, http://www.shannacompton.com/blog.html
"This comic is so much fun. "Grab a wave, homy" and get yrs right now. I'd
say more, but I'd hate to ruin it for you. After you read it, "hunk if you
&#9829;."

K. SILEM MOHAMMAD, http://limetree.ksilem.com
"Just ordered my copy of Gary Sullivan's Elsewhere: The Comic Book. I saw
the original pages when I was back east, and you definitely want this."

NICK PIOMBINO, http://nickpiombino.blogspot.com
"Not only is it "interesting" as is said of so many works of this type, but
it is actually funny! And brilliant. All the words and images were found on
Nada and Gary's honeymoon in Tokyo. It is a joy to have and to look at, and
a fascinating read. If you liked *Swoon*, the courtship, you'll love
*Elsewhere*, the honeymoon."

MAUREEN THORSON, http://www.reenhead.com/mole/mole.php
"While in my garret, I've been reading Gary Sullivan's new comic, Elsewhere.
Fascinatingly weird nation of Japan, when will your uproarious misspellings,
failure to understand the inappropriateness of words, and Boschian imagery
not be the West's closest legal alternative to hallucinogens? Anyway, it's
pretty darn cool."

TOM BECKETT, http://worderos.blogspot.com
"I love this first issue of Gary Sullivan's comic book. If you know Gary's
blog you'll probably remember the posts from the notebooks he kept during
his honeymoon with Nada Gordon in Japan, June 2004. The notebooks were
notable for the delight they took in cultural disjunction. They featured
wacky Japanese mistranslations from English idiom as utilized in advertising
contexts that attained sublime levels of poetry. Excerpts from those
notebooks, paired with Gary's inkings, constitute this first issue of
Elsewhere. Geeze, I'm in heaven. This is a sweet book."

JACK KIMBALL, http://pantaloons.blogspot.com
"At her reading at Demolicious in Cambridge a couple of weeks ago Nada
handed me a copy of Gary's Elsewhere Vol. 1, his Nippon comic & phrase
collection, honeymoon edition. Since there was an open mic before Nada took
over, I got powerfully inspired and stood up to read Gary's piece
front-to-back to a shimmering, giggly audience. I read it within horizontal
bands, that is, speaking the text from the top blocks left page to right,
then middle blocks and bottom blocks, left to right page. Was that why
everyone was giggling? Nope, Gary's text 'works' no matter how you read it
-- as good ideograms are supposed to. The audience was simply wrapping its
brains around the clown antics, and loving it. My eyes had the added vantage
of bouncing off Gary's prescient cartoons as my tongue spoke the riddles and
runes! It was total corneal-to-labial coordination, baba. So even tho I'm
late with this report and seem like an also-fan, I am beaming among the
first to perform Elsewhere. Ahem."

The LA Library, before it lost its funding (it doesn't even have _my_
books) had:

the complete list of Dalkey archive (avail for a special library price)
the complete Salt list
the complete Sun and Moon / Green Integer list
the complete Coach House list

the UCLA library has

the Auckland University Press list
the list of -- I forget the press right now -- the English-language
press in Singapore

A reminder:

Please come to one or both of the following events-- rare chances to speak to and hear from
this major figure of West Coast poetry and poetics:

GARY SNYDER

Thursday, April 21

Informal Q & A
Poetry and Rare Books Room
University at Buffalo
4-5 pm

Poetry Reading
Albright Knox Art Gallery
8pm

Free Admission

(Arrive at the Gallery early, as the auditorium is likely to fill up.)

Gary Snyder has led multiple careers, in the context of a remarkably unified philosophy of
bioregional practices.  He is equally renowned for his association with Kenneth Rexroth,
Robert Duncan, Philip Whalen, Allen Ginsberg and Jack Kerouac, amongst others, who were
part of the notable flowering of west coast poetry during the 1950s; for his wilderness
advocacy and eloquence as perhaps the best-known literary voice of the growing
conservation movement; and for his sustained role in the twentieth-century transmission of
East Asian – especially Buddhist – cultures into North America, or Turtle Island, as he calls it.
Snyder has nineteen books in print, including the publication of his high country
backpacking journals, The High Sierra of California (Berkeley: Heyday Press, 2002) and the
recent poetry collection, Danger on Peaks (Washington:  Shoemaker & Hoard, 2004).

Renee Gladman will read from her work at 7:00 pm on
Friday, April 22, in the South Atrium (First Floor) of
the Harry Ransom Humanities Research Center on the UT
campus.

Renee Gladman is the author of Juice (Kelsey St. Press
2000), The Activist (Krupskaya 2003), and most
recently A Picture-Feeling (Roof Books). She founded
and edited Leroy Press, a beautifully bound chapbook
series that published innovative poetry and prose by
mostly emerging writers. Having spent most of the past
three decades in Atlanta and San Francisco, she now
resides in Brooklyn, NY, where she produces the L
Projects: presses for new literature.

The reading is free and open to the public.

The Zero-to-Sixty reading series showcases young
writers reading from recently published first or
second books of fiction and poetry. Past readers have
included Joshua Clover, Susan Steinberg, and Matthea
Harvey. The series is curated by Susan Briante and
sponsored by the University of Texas at Austin English
Department.

Friday, April 22, 2005 at 7:30 p.m.
Small Press Traffic is pleased to present a reading by
Allison Cobb & Adeena Karasick

Allison Cobb was born in Los Alamos, New Mexico, as was the atomic bomb.
Indeed, Lisa Jarnot says Cobb's debut collection, Born2 (Chax Press), "casts
the shadows of Gertrude Stein and Hannah Weiner across the history of the
Southwest where the avant-garde abducts a nuclear family into a nuclear era.
(She) has forged a brilliant multi-genre lyrical saga -- here is a tender
page-turner with a slash and burn bite."

Adeena Karasick's six books include The House That Hijack Built, Mêmewars, and
The Empress Has No Closure, all from Talonbooks. She has lectured and
performed worldwide (collaborating often with dancers, musicians, video and
sound installation artists), and regularly publishes articles, reviews and
dialogues on contemporary poetry, poetics and cultural/semiotic theory. She
teaches at St. John's University; and has been known to channel Elvis Presley
when she reads.


All events $5-10 sliding scale, free to SPT members & CCA community
Held at Timken Lecture Hall, CCA SF campus
1111 8th Street, just off the corner of 16th & Wisconsin (please see our
website for a map: http://www.sptraffic.org)

Every university library has staff who are in charge of different parts of
the collection.  Whoever the person at Towson is who looks after Literature
should be strongly advised to get the catalogues from SPD -- My past
experience has been that library staff are delighted to order small press
titles from an organization like SPD that makes it easy to do --

chris, be sure not to forget yr saddle-stapled brethren, as these are the
publications which will disappear far quicker over the years than
perfect-bound
books and need to be preserved, as many of the words and images included won't
ever make it into their contributor's books, if they ever have any.
best, david

Alan,
Bottom line, are you trying to say, Ain't nobody comin to your funeral =
'cause yer a nobody?  Hell, Alan, that's true of all the folks in the =
world except for the pope and a few dozen other stellar souls, most of =
whom don't really care that you and I will die and be buried with no =
pomp or circumstance surrounding our interment.=20

And I like things that way. =20

Can't really say why, but something struck me as hilarious when I saw =
the TV clips of the Pope's cypress box sitting in the center of an =
Iranian carpet...a carpet probably made by children under 10, because =
their fingers are small and deft enough to allow them to make the small, =
tight knots that mark the quality of a rug.  But this was a holy man, =
and he deserved to be displayed upon the very best, or so we are =
supposed to believe.

Mahatma Gandhi lay upon homespun, but he too had throngs of mourners =
placing flowers on his carpet, and hundreds of mourners tossed =
themselves into the river as their acts of sorrow over his passing...

Clearly, it isn't the external trappings that cause the hordes to hover =
at the pyre.  =20

I think for me, my kids will rush to find the key to the wine cellar, =
grab bottles of the good stuff and mix it with seven-up before they =
drink it...they know that act will piss me off for eternity, but they =
know too, it's something I can take into hell with me knowing that the =
pain of where I am is easier to take than the thought of how they took =
vintage wine and mixed it with fizzy shit before drinking.  They are =
after all, considerate children, and they wouldn't think of putting my =
ass on a carpet made from child labor. =20

panoply

after this Aliscans
float me down the Rhone
to Alychamps in Arles
where sarcophagi fell from the sky
troubadors sang of tottered graves
chansons de geste
in ever wider circles and listing a bit toward Avalon
observing a little universe after ice storms and debris
     a sanctuary still greening
morning mists of solitude chronicle my seasons
a span of life's insufficiency
manacled by boundaries
meant to be violated

Memorial
Allen Ginsberg or Kathy Acker or Robert Creeley dies and the lists  swell
with memorials, ephemera, anecdotes, quotations, odes, forwards,  from
friends, strangers, almost always loving, sometimes websites are  created,
people might travel a little bit in real life, people cry, tears  are
written, the swelling grows, levels, subsides, the loss is present,  some
might say ever-present, others sutured over, it's moment's like these  that
lists, communities, online and offline, come together, at least appear  to
We're all vulnerable, we all wait our turn in the wings for our  memorial,
our moment, of passing, the whisper which fades, can only fade, in  this
most fragile of media, these archives that disappear as well,  without
memorial, passing comments at best
Before the Net, what then?, rumors, telephone calls, almost always one  to
one immediately, then perhaps the newspaper or radio announcements, if  one
is sufficiently famous, perhaps a gathering at St. Mark's or other  space
turned place for memorials, always carried in memory, not even the  arc-
hive, someone might have made a video of the event, or an audio,  anything,
but not publicly accessible, now online the archives are there,  present,
naked to anyone, susceptible to hacking, damage, but at least  momentarily
present, at least the denouement
What will happen to us, to me, when the words cease and others suture  in,
or at least one hopes for the suturing, the swollen and marked,  remarked,
residue, communal ripples, there
Or as lists increasingly list, to the side of the dead, thanatotic,  encom-
iums, tottered graves, true memorials of eternal battered words, the  dead
praising the dead, the graves full from one end of the infinite Net to  the
other, guarded against intrusion, archives infinitely duplicated,  words
presenting at the last judgment
Thomas Browne and a quincunx of urns in his honour

Rattapallax Film Presents SOUND BARRIER at the Tribeca
Film Festival, NYC

"It is one of the most stunning films I have seen this
year."
-- Peter Scarlet, Director of the Tribeca Film
Festival on the Leonard Lopate Show on WNYC, April 19,
2005

"Sound Barrier: Iranian master Amir Naderi's latest
dispatch from the streets of his adopted New York
represents a return to the themes of his seminal The
Runner. Fending for himself in an indifferent city, a
deaf boy searches for the remaining traces of his dead
mother, a radio talk show host who left behind a
collection of audio cassettes in a Greenpoint
warehouse. As is customary in Naderi's oeuvre, sound
design is crucial, and the movie gradually builds to
an aural tour de force set on a congested bridge.
Exhilarating and exhausting — with a finale that is
quite literally an epiphany." — Village Voice

Screening Schedule:
Sun, Apr 24 / 3:00pm: Stuyvesant High School
Auditorium
Tue, Apr 26 / 7:00pm: Tribeca Cinemas Theater 1

Hi -

This summer we're going to be (from June 11 - August 25) at the Grand Central
Arts Center in Santa Ana, California. I'm going to be working on a number of
computer projects for the duration, as well as giving some talks.

If you're in this part of the country (about a half hour south of L.A.),
and want to get together, please write me at sondheim@panix.com or
sondheim@gmail.com. Azure and I would like to meet people in the area.
If you write now, I'll be able to compile a list and will get in touch
with you either shortly before, or when we arrive. (We're leaving New York
May 14th). -

Thanks greatly!

yours, Alan

 From this morning's NYT:

Surrender in the Battle of Poetry Web Sites
  By EDWARD WYATT


  W. H. Auden may have lamented that "poetry makes nothing happen," but
that has not kept poets themselves - and their enthusiasts - from using
the Internet to make trouble when they get riled up.

  This week the poetry world is atwitter over the closing down of an
Internet site that for the last year dedicated itself to exposing what
it calls fraud among the small circle of poetry contests that
frequently offer publishing contracts as prizes.

Alan Cordle, a research librarian who lives in Portland, Ore., has
managed the Web site, www.foetry.com, anonymously since its inception a
little more a year ago.

  He called his site the "American poetry watchdog" and aimed to expose
the national poetry contests that he said "are often large-scale fraud
operations" in which judges select their friends and students as
winners.

  But Mr. Cordle's identity, which he says he protected to avoid
recriminations against those who joined in his fight, was revealed
earlier this month. The unmasking was performed by an anti-Foetry Web
site that is also run anonymously and which used some of Mr. Cordle's
own aggressive tactics - he once used a state open-records law to
unlock details about participants in a contest sponsored by a state
university press - to remove his cloak of mystery.

In an interview yesterday, Mr. Cordle said that while the unveiling of
his identity was the immediate cause of his decision to close the
Foetry site, he had been planning to do so "for about a month" because
of frequent requests from his wife.

  She, it turns out, is a poet - Kathleen Halme, who in September 1994
won a poetry contest managed by the University of Georgia Press, the
Contemporary Poetry Series, one of the contests that Mr. Cordle has
railed against as corrupt.

Mr. Cordle's identity was revealed by a blog called whoisfoetry
(whoisfoetry.blogspot.com). It had recently solicited tips about the
identity of the Foetry operator and of participants in its discussion
forum, which over the last year drew hundreds of poetry fanatics as
participants - most of them participating using pseudonyms.

  After several tries, the blog managed to wrest the identity of the
Foetry site's registrant from the company that manages Internet domain
names. For the poetry world, which makes headlines about as often as
philosophers' guilds and knitting circles, the dust-up has led to
bitter recriminations and charges of slander or worse.

One of the poets and contest judges who has been attacked on the Foetry
site, Jorie Graham, a professor at Harvard University, said in a
telephone interview yesterday that the claims on Foetry were untrue as
well as "vitriolic and very painful" and took unfair aim "at the people
who have worked to try to help young poets in this country."

  She is not the only opponent to speak publicly about Foetry; another
is Janet Holmes, an associate professor of English at Boise State
University and the director of Ahsahta Press, which oversees a poetry
prize that has come under fire on Foetry. Writing on her Web site,
www.humanophone.com, she said she was disgusted by the "lies and
innuendoes" on Mr. Cordle's site. "He should be ashamed of himself for
what he's done, not just because he's been caught doing it," she wrote.

Mr. Cordle said he had maintained the site's domain registration and
that he might restart the site at some point in the future if he can
find someone to take over monitoring of the discussion forums.

Foetry Schmoetry

I  think every poet has expressed frustration with 'prize culture'but for
God's sake act like
a man and let people know what you think openly don't hide and throw pot
shots, in the NYT there is this big revelation that
friends are publishing friends?  This has been true in Poetry at least since
Dante! Who is this schmo? Hey it was nice to see Jorie Graham's picture in
the times this morning she looks good for a woman of her age LOL

Coen -- check out the first in ther series, _Blue Eyes_ -- Charyn must
have more than 40 books to his credit now, extremely prolific, though I
remained with the Coen series.

Fellas,

I too look good for a woman my age, but I'll assume Haas was simply  reacting
to his morning physiology. For that I can forgive him. I can respect  both
forms of beauty which may or may not be relevant to poetics.

As for this the only time poetry makes it into the newspapers,  that's
debatable. Afterall, some recently noted Robert Creeley's  passing. Like Alan said,
memorials, but at least it's something.

Mary Jo

**********

Ray, Ray!

"Act like a MAN!"
"...she looks good for a woman of her age LOL"

Are you bored and want to start another one of those
wars we have?

Doing some work, research as a peer writing tutor for college students.

Any info, ideas on using a writing center to change USAmericanese
appreciated.

Also on poets reading to non-poets as a way of increasing knowledge in the
world about poetry.

Ray,

Of course I understand you are pissed off about the
newspapers--anybody interested in poetry, Arts, and
thinking would be p.o.'d at the NY Times, etc. NY
Times arts articles and obituaries are often glaringly
uninformed, they don't even know how to use basic
vocabulary, for instance more than once Times arts
writers have used "simplistic" as if it were a synonym
for "simple", e.g. "Malevich then began creating
simplistic forms".

But my point about your post was that it seemed tinder
for more p.c. wars, in this case re/ gender, as it
discombobulated even me, and I'm very skeptical about
korrectness.

Best,
Stephen

Jeezus, Ray, sounds like you have been running another kind of "contest" on
your own!
Just to prepare you for some "time honored" well deserved flack!
If you are middle-aged, take a good luck at the shape of your stomach, if it
is out there at all, it will be the first line of attack, and there is
always the sagging chest, the double chin.

Hope you are looking good, well preserved, etc., too!

Hi everyone,

I’ve been way way way lurking on these lists for the better part of the year,
partly because of an email snafu which I was too lazy and/or busy and/or
stupid to fix, partly because of it’s been a year of both tragic and comic
personal craziness.  But anyway, I’m trying to get back in the habit.

I’m hoping this reaches most readers of Combo magazine.  If you know any
who aren’t on these lists, please pass this message along.  If you wanna post
it on your blog, so much the better.

First off, I want to apologize for the terribly slow pace of Combo magazine.
Again part of this is simply about life getting the better of me, father of
young kids, son of old parents etc.  But it also has to do with the advent of
Combo Books, which has required significant effort to get rolling, and of a
new non-profit literary organization, Combo Arts.  Among other things,
Combo Arts supports the Downcity Poetry Series in Providence, RI, which I co-
direct with Michael Gizzi.  I’ll have more to say about Combo Arts in a formal
announcement in the near future.

I plan on publishing Combo 14 sometime in early summer.  It will include a
long interview with Michael Gizzi, poems by Drew Gardner, Carl Martin and
lots of other great stuff.  After that I very much hope to get back on my
normal three-times-a-year schedule.  My response time on submissions has
also been abysmal this year and I plan on correcting that situation as well.

The first Combo Book, as most of you know, is out and available for
purchase:

K. Silem Mohammad, A THOUSAND DEVILS (Combo Books, 2004)
http://spdbooks.org/Details.asp?BookID=0972888004

SPD is (very) temporarily sold out of this 100 page carnival of great poetry –
the prequel, if you will, to Kasey’s DEER HEAD NATION.  If you have to have it
today (and you clearly do) you can order it directly from Combo Books, c/o
Michael Magee, 6 Brookwood Ln. Cumberland, RI 02864.  Price is $12.00.  If
you haven’t read Kasey Mohammad’s poetry over the last few years, well, I
welcome you back to planet earth after your long journey.

The next Combo Book is ALSO WITH MY THROAT I SHALL SWALLOW TEN
THOUSAND SWORDS: ARAKI YASUSADA’S LETTERS IN ENGLISH, by Tosa
Motokiyu, edited by Kent Johnson and Javier Alvarez.  It is a companion book
to the much discussed Doubled Flowering: From the Notebooks of Araki
Yasusada (Roof Books, 1997).  It will be available in June.

And here’s a couple books of mine that are fairly recent, one criticism, one
poetry:

Michael Magee, EMANCIPATING PRAGMATISM: EMERSON, JAZZ AND
EXPERIMENTAL WRITING (U Alabama P, 2004)
http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0817350845/
qid=1114110110/sr=2-2/ref=pd_bbs_b_2_2/104-9756415-4690350

And some kind words about it:

“Nowhere else, that I am aware of, can one read such an apt commingling of
Emerson and Ellison, jazz and writing, Williams, Stein, Baraka and O’Hara…
Emancipating Pragmatism is a remarkable synthesis of these figures who have
been the subject of disparate studies before, but whose linkages to
philosophical approaches to pragmatism have never been so carefully
examined in parallel.”

--Aldon Nielsen

"Michael Magee has written a book about the links between pragmatism,
Emerson, jazz and experimental writing that is so wonderfully playful that
Dewey could only have admired it.  James may have tried to mimic it.  But
only Santayana could have pulled it off.  Okay, not even Santayana, perhaps! It
is a gem."

--Henry Levinson in _Transactions of the Charles S. Peirce Society_

And the most recent book of poems:

Michael Magee, MS (Spuyten Duyvil, 2003)
http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/1881471209/
qid=1114110247/sr=1-5/ref=sr_1_5/104-9756415-4690350?
v=glance&s=books

Stuttering turns into syncopation in this edgily engaging collocation of
accents, attitudes, occasions. The poems in MS are provocative, certainly
without idealization, the dollars-and-cents context of our grainy American
dream. Mike Magee's  detailed optical-ocular orbiting effects –– "other-wise /
waning or adroitly loitering" –– make reading this collection a constant
surprise.

--Susan Howe

Does the poet diagnose a medical condition or continue a feminist tradition?
Is it a motor ship or a manuscript? A degree of science or a software
appliance? Recklessly eyeballing Mike Magee's "grainy American dream," my
optic nerves jangle to the tune of jump-cut language, slurred and blurred
words flashed on the screen of memory with a quick trigger finger on the
universal remote. Magee's MS interrupts our programming with his alternative
vision.

--Harryette Mullen

Lastly, I’m planning a big website update that will allow for book and
magazine purchasing as well as tax-deductible donation to Combo Arts.
(Meantime you can access the Combo website as it currently is at http://
www.combopoetry.com). Stay tuned!  So, there you have it. Glad to be back in
the conversation.

Michael Magee

Dear all,

The latest issue of rhubarb is susan is up and online, including two
reviews, one of John Kinsella in FULCRUM, and one of Catherine Daly in
Petty Coat Relaxer.

http://rhubarbissusan.blogspot.com

Thanks for tuning in, and don't forget that copies of "SWAN : a love
story" are still available both free in PDF format and at cost in
hardcopy. From the blurb:

http://rhubarbissusan.blogspot.com/2005/04/swan-love-story.html

"There are precisely 304,888,344,611,713,860,501,504,000,000 different
possible poems that can be produced by shuffling the cards. If you speed
read each possible combination, taking one second per card, it would take
you approximately 200 billion times the age of the Universe. The most
reasonable way to read every possible permutation of SWAN is to turn every
star in the galaxy into a thinking, poetry appriciating being. Then a
complete reading, if it began at the birth of the Milky Way, would be
almost finished by now. This makes SWAN : a love story not only a
beautiful work of prose, but exceptional value too."

Charyn is a writer who lives in NY and Paris, author of about 45 books,
mainly novels but also non fiction. Born around 1937. He is most famous
for one of his crime series set in NYC, about a gink named Sidel (is
that right?) who rises from cop to chief to mayor, and last I heard he
was
running for vice-president. Wonderful stylist, Charyn. Wrote great
novels
about baseball, Mussolini, Buffalo Bill, Lenin, US internment camps for
Japanese
AMERicans, Roosevelt and his dog, hit men, a literary magazine (in the
form of a literary
magazine), ping pong, etc. Wonderful stories about growing up in the
Bronx.

I've been looking at the Pioneer 10 plaque this week and am considering
poetic possibilities.

Wikipedia has more information on Linda Salzman Sagan's drawing:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pioneer_plaque

Q1: Have any of you ever seen diagrams from countries besides the US of
A (i.e. China, Russia)--what they've sent into space comparatively?
Backchannel is fine.

Q2: Does anyone know the etymology of backchannel?

Q3: Is cleave really the only word that is its own antonym in English?

That is all.

CALL FOR SUBMISSIONS

The editors of No Tell Motel (www.notellmotel.org) are looking for
previously unpublished poems for a new print anthology _The Bedside
Guide to No Tell Motel_.  This anthology will include some of the most
seductive poems that have already appeared at No Tell as well as new
ones from poets who have not yet appeared at the journal.

WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR

Sex appeal, playfulness and discretion in the broadest sense. (So
please refrain from sending us "sex act" poems, unless they're really
good and we mean, really good.  Hint:  If you're rhyming "cock" and
"rock" or "breast" and "chest," it's probably not really good.
Probably.  But "breast" and "Budapest" . . .)  For an idea of our
editorial tastes, visit our journal (www.notellmotel.org) and read the
poems we've already published.

GUIDELINES

Send up to 3 poems to bedsidesubmit (at) notellmotel.org in the body of
the e-mail.  DO NOT SEND ATTACHMENTS.

Unpublished poems only.

Include brief bio.

Deadline:  May 31, 2005

Payment:  Two copies of anthology

Editors:  Reb Livingston & Molly Arden

Dear List,

I've been off-list for many months, distracted by the press of relocation.
However, I am glad to be back on mail setting and reading what some of you
are up to and thinking about. That said-

Happy Earth Day. Buy a book.

Palm Press is pleased to announce the publication of Jonathan Skinner's

POLITICAL CACTUS POEMS

Skinner's work engages the various meanings of life outdoors, in the shape
of a changing response to questions posed by the environments the poet
physically inhabits. In part, the poetry operates as an instrument of
research into a particular natural environment or a geological formation or
species. In exchange, it offers forms of life measured to particular places,
an invitation to inhabit the evolutionary imagination of the senses and of
those places. His first book-length collection, Political Cactus Poems,
which stem from the poet's life in the Southwest, challenges the pristine
agenda of nature poetry by hybridizing themes from the lives of humans and
cacti.

PRAISE FOR Jonathan Skinner's POLITICAL CACTUS POEMS:

If cactuses could talk, poets be out of work. In the meantime, Jonathan
Skinner's Political Cactus Poems are primers of attentive engagement; not
only its pleasures responsibilities, but also its animations and
metamorphoses. It's not just that we read what we see; Skinner imagines that
we are read by what sees us. "Matter's clatter" is the echo of unheard
songs. In these poems, the saguaro drinks our words and leaves us thirsty
for more.
--Charles Bernstein

This is Very Good (that's WHY I used it when I taught at Mills, his Little
Dictionary Of Sounds--I played the Tape Of The Sounds & GAVE THEM THE POEMS
he had written!--I didn't have to TEACH!!) -- 'VOCABULARY' + 'STUDY'
(somehow) Evidences THE WORLD AT LARGE in ManyWritten Poems--BRAVO!!
--Robert Grenier

The fact is, humanity's a drop in the bucket.  But only scantily has poetry
looked at the rest of the bucket.  Jonathan Skinner in Political Cactus
Poems makes a wonderful stab in that omnidirection.  The language lays out
its dynamics "as if" human and nature were one. The reader feels
connections' displays not so much in terms of grammar as of a great series
of metonymic grids, that feel like chemistry.  Meanings dance rather than
submit to linear equations.  On p. 33 one of Skinner's dense but unadorned
"tope prisms" ends

        "spots taking on chronologies of their own
         expanding in a series of rotational slides
         not yet confirmed.  For the individual,
         stationary in the blast of current events
         no true point of balance is ever found."

Mostly, they show-don't-tell.  These down-to-earth cylinders, pulled from
the air, are forwarding explorations in the most important direction poetry
can go: out.  Yet they're plenty human and fun to read.
A macro-micro delight.
--Jack Collom

Jonathan Skinner with his journal ecopoetics has been showing us how it is
all connected. all systemic, all wonderful even while at risk. The poems in
Political Cactus Poems do similar work as they tell the sad stories of
contemporary politics (Milosevic and Bush show up at various moments) with
the specific stories of various cacti. These poems direct and redirect our
attention to the larger ethical issues of political and natural
environments. They are tight, luminous poems that illustrate how the world
is more complicated than most of us acknowledge.
--Juliana Spahr

Jonathan Skinner edits ecopoetics in Buffalo, NY where he misidentifies
birds along the Niagara River. His chapbooks include Political Cactus Poems
(Periplum Editions) and Little Dictionary of Sounds (RedDLines).

Not even a comicbook hero
Trapped in a fishbowl
As cold as blue

Wiph the struggle in his heart woht makes
Hot the blues

So you wanna cry
It makes you wanna…
Go homies,
Go homies,
Go homies,
Cryptic writs and b-bwai suicides
Where was his tribe
Woht was his dojo?
He was livin yänkee wonderful
Black is beautiful
Black is beautiful
Being black can be harmful
Like the hateful white dude
Who’d wanted to raise up from the go dogs of contruction
And get his ticket a b.u.t. like the niggers in the misconception of
This valley he couldn’t cipher the price
They called him H8
And H8 he was like a morphine. He scooped the panopticon of inners of
the city to the blocks of his new Palestinian homeland like he fixed up
wiph the bottom set to hummm.
So he stood
So he had a corner
So he
Observed like niney
Men hell bent on committing a felony
Motorbicycles with men gettin sloppy
…and who is that shadey paleface trashy fella hangin on the corner in
stocking tuque and darkers chewin on a donut and sussin the blocks?
-Wohwoh, here come phét nagah punk,

H8 would shoot you for 2 grand in the woods. He could make you yänkee
supreme. Make you button all shiny so you gleam. This doctor, who left
his boyclub ties to spend time on the real as a junkie at the holiday
courthouse, would get a cut to patch the whole up and leave you wiph a
scar which the whitebwais would rock in immolation of the the passion of
black boys in their the body art sculped by neoromans, centurians
artisans in jake steez as sanhendrines and parasitic pharasees baited
the day from the amerikkkan amphitheatres and galleries called
Prisons and record store shelf life.

…sorry for the mess bruh…

Woht’s the price
A fist full of rolled up nickles?
Rollin down the street onna mission
Rockin thick mitts lookin for a no payin bitch?
Jus him his and mate wiph a likky switch
Goin loco for pay or
Jus for likkle kicks
Not even a comicbook hero
Who was his tribe?
Axes and black kids
Could someone give him the basic instructions?

There was no good day really.

Cuz he never knew when there was gonna be a strike.
And things would erupt
Collapsing and expandin the area outside his square to disaster.

Why did thet feggit smell like dog? Why does he walk?
Go hold him and raise a finger at his back.

Would you let him shoot you?
Pay him a grand or two make you look like you roll wiph a loco crew and
knew how to be a naga
And kickit?.
So our friar H8 can find the price of of ticket.

"Edwin Torres is the bastard love child of Vladimir Mayakovsky and Nicanor=
=20
Parra, midwifed by Guillaume Apollinaire," wrote Christian Haye in The=20
Poetry Project Newsletter. If there has ever been a poet who may be guilty=
=20
of hybridity or syncreticism or multiple influences or unnameable practices=
=20
or being over the top, it is Torres. Critics say things about him like,=20
"It's hard to wrestle meaning from the shreds of language he tosses out.=20
And on paper, Torres seems to make as much sense as a Port Authority=20
schizophrenic"--which is as much to say that they are impressed,=20
challenged, wondering, intrigued, and looking for more. Otherwise put,=20
Torres works between and among languages, aesthetics, genres, and makes new=
=20
meaning out of all of them. He is a master at creating new affects--states=
=20
of feeling that never existed until you saw them live on stage.

His bio reads: "Edwin Torres is a bilingual poet, rooted in the languages=20
of both sight and sound. He's been creating text and performance work since=
=20
1988. Mingling the textures of poetry with vocal & physical improvisation,=

organic landscapes that exist beyond language. His introduction to poetry=20
was through The Nuyorican Poets Cafe and The St. Marks Poetry Project,=20
where he=92s worked as workshop leader and curator. His debut CD Holy Kid=20
(Kill Rock Stars) combines poetry with music, sounds and homemade tapes,=20
and is included in the exhibition The American Century Pt. II at The=20
Whitney Museum of American Art.

"From 1993-99, he was a member of the poetry collective, Real Live Poetry=20
(formerly Nuyorican Poets Cafe Live) with whom he performed and conducted=20

with a variety of performers, musicians, dancers, videographers, poets &=20

"Finally, (where is the legacy of a bitter fool) his media assault has=20

Subject:      Presences by Creeley&Marisol/Collaborations
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

After Creeley's death, I went back to the book of his I didn't understand when I read it over twenty years ago: Presences by Creeley & Marisol.  The problem is the relationship or lack thereof between the words and the images.  Is it really a collaboration?  Most artist/poet collabs I have seen like George Schneeman's with many poets or the ones Frank O'Hara participated in have the words inserted into the visual images whereas this strange book has the two different media running side by side in parallel although abutting worlds.  Also, there is the question of equality.  In most collaborations I've participated in, (mostly with other poets but occasionally with musicians and once with a painter) the assumption is that the participants are equal whereas, when rereading this book, I found myself devoting more time to Creeley than to Marisol just because the words took longer to read than the pictures required to be absorbed.  Anyway, on the nature of collaboration and/or what
  this
 book is about I would appreciate some response since, after so many years, this book is still a problem for me.

Experts warn on dangers of 'Crackberry' addiction
Iain Thomson, vnunet.com 22 Apr 2005
http://www.vnunet.com/news/1162648

Researchers at the University of London Institute of Psychiatry have
found that the constant distractions of email and texting are more
harmful to performance than cannabis.

Those distracted by incoming email, phone calls and text messages saw
a 10-point fall in their IQ, more than twice that found in studies of
the impact of smoking cannabis, according to the researchers.

Some 1,100 volunteers were used in the study, sponsored by HP. Half of
those questioned said that they reply to emails instantly or as soon
as possible, and one in five admitted to breaking off meals or social
engagements to deal with email.

This constant shifting of concentration makes the brain more tired and
less focused, and causes the temporary IQ fall-off.

Email and SMS are also making us work longer. Over 60 per cent of
those questioned answered work emails at home or when they are on
holiday.

The phenomenon of email addiction is well known, not least to users of
RIM's BlackBerry devices.

Intel president Craig Barratt and many others refer to these devices
as 'CrackBerrys' because of the obsessive email use they inspire in
their owners.

I think Yau's Book "In Company" about the collaborations might say something
useful about them.

ghost of the imagination. Written from within Mexico=92s displaced Eastern=

=20
of the migratory self,=94 an almost thirty-year  journey of the nomadic=20

displacement, the journey is at once profoundly Mexican, and profoundly=20
American, the discovery of a new internal place where warring selves may be=

from Part I: Shaharit

In the migrations of red marigolds where songs burst from long-beaked birds
and apples rot before the disaster
Where women fondle their breasts and touch themselves
in the perspiration of rice powder and teatime
Climbing vines course through what remains always the same
Cities crisscrossed by thought
Ash Wednesday. Old nanny watches us from a beam of light
Pools of shadow breathe, purples rain down nearly red
The heat opens its jaws
Below, the moon sinks into the street
and a black woman=92s voice, a sad black woman=92s voice begins to sing
The incense of gladioli and ferry boats grow
And your fingers, lukewarm mollusks, slip inside me
We are in the fragile hide of autumn
In the rectangular park
in the dog days when the pale shades are most deeply moving
After Shaharit
raw, forgotten prayers
Winds rise lightly rinsed by invocation, forests of alders
And my grandmother always played the same sonata
A girl eats ice cream on a sunny corner of the street
A man reads a paper while he waits for the bus
The light fractures
And clothing hangs in the sun. My grandmother=92s impenetrable sonata
You said it was summer. O music
And the invasion of dawns and the invasion of greens
Below, shouts of children at play, nut vendors
yellow roses breathing. And as we left the movies my grandmother said to me
child, dream that the dream of life is beautiful
Beneath the summer-drenched willow only restlessness lingers
Docile clouds descend into the silence
The day evaporates in the hot air
Green erupts within green
I spread my legs beneath the bathtub faucet
The gushing water falls
Enters me
This is the hour when the words of the Zohar are spread out
Still the same questions as always
I sink deeper and deeper
The light throbs wildly
In the vertigo of Kol Nidre before the great fast begins
In the blue haze of the synagogues
Before and after Rosh Hashanah
In the whiteness of the rain in the Plaza del Carmen
my grandmother says her five o=92clock rosary
And swooping in the background
the shofar=92s echo opens the year =20

An interesting thing that happens in _Presences_
(1976) is that the voice of Marisol (Escobar), the
visual artist, seems to take over the last two pages
of text (before the "Postcript").  Creeley in these
two pages seems to be working from a tape recording(?)
(written notes?) of Marisol speaking, reporting her
words, shuffling them around.  Here are the fourth and
fifth paragraphs from this section:

I began to make self-portraits because working at
night I had no other model. Thinks that the world is
little. Weather walking, in rain.  I used myself over
and over again.  Sees green.  Passing people, goes
forward, goes green, goes white.  I would learn about
myself.  Y el corazon es immenso, laughing.  Seeing
tears, feeling edges.  Pause of applause, in the big
city.  You are your own best friend.

I put things where they belong.  I return to reality.
People should think of themselves. Walk streets at
night, working at night.  I had no other model.  I
used myself over and over.  I see you. In the big
city.  People should think of themselves.  Goes green,
goes white.
__________________________________
One thing that is threaded throughtout these two pages
of _Presences_ are pieces from a passage of Spanish
poetry--favorite lines of Marisol, I imagine,
sometimes given by Creeley in Spanish and sometimes in
English. Pasted together, the lines are:

Vestida con mantos negros,
Piensa que el mundo es chiquito
Y el corazon es immenso.

(which means roughly: "Dressed in black robes/I think
the world is little/And the heart is very large")  I
think I read somewhere that these are lines from
Garcia Lorca? But the words "darkness falls from the
air" also enters these two pages, a reveral of Thomas
Nashe's "brightness falls from the air".  Are these
Elizabethan British lines also favorites of Marisol's?
(who is still alive, by the way, I dopily had the
impression she wasn't!) Favorites of Creeley alone?
Mysteries of colloboration.

The rest of the book, well I have to read it again.
As to its colloborative nature, it's at least a GIFT
FOR M.--"Presences, A Text for Marisol".

Even if one spends less time with them than the words,
I think the visuals hold their own, they have a
vividness that any words might envy--"words, words, as
if all worlds were there".

1.)  Evidently, there's some sort of "mathematical"
formula to the permutations of this book.  At the
front of the book there is a page that reads:

                     PRESENCES

                     1.2.3
                     2.3.1
                     3.1.2
                     1.2.3
                     2.3.1

Bill Sylvester of SUNY/Buffalo was into this aspect of
the book--maybe he is reading this and can explain?
(Bill also said that Presences wd someday be
considered a monument/breakthrough of adventerous
prose, like Stein's _Three Lives_).


2.) In my discussion of the Spanish lines Creeley
quoted, I mistranslated: "Piensa que el mundo..."
would be third person, of course, "(S)he thinks the
world is little".

I wanted to gather together URLs for purchase etc. of my work available
online. This is probably incomplete, but for those who are interested, it
is probably useful. Note that Printed Matter carries a number of things.
I definitely recommend the books - VEL, The Wayward, Sophia, .echo. There
are days I wish I was a store. Those are the days I could still wish.

VEL
by Alan Sondheim
$16.00
Based on Virtual Environment work, an intense selection of recent texts
on motion capture, avatars, online experience, and language. A must!
http://www.cafepress.com/cp/browse/Ne-6_N-1203+1016+20472268_nr-1_bt-1

.echo
by Alan Sondheim
Alan Sondheim's new ebook, .echo, takes you on a fascinating journey with
Nikuko Meat-Girl into the language of avatars, transliterate lovemaking
and virtual subjectivity. While interacting with Sondheim's ebook of
mystical eroticism, the reader will lose themselves in a net.fiction
charged with sex, obsession, codework and real bodies pushed to the limit.
A provocative theory-world presented in the guise of experimental
narrative, .echo takes the reader on a high-speed, yet zen-like trip
through a hallucinatory landscape that one can imagine used to be the
world. There's never been anything like this book as it confounds the
relationship between America and Japan, prosthetics and aesthetics,
visible words and invisible intelligences. Enter at your own risk!
http://www.altx.com/ebooks/echo.html

Sophia
Sondheim, Alan; Sophia, ISBN 1 84254 583 3; published July 2004,
reprinted November 2004
One of the author's rare texts of philosophy, an extended meditation on
world and worlding, written with a unique style and structure. Perhaps the
best guide to reality ever written!

The Wayward
Salt Books
The Wayward is an exploration into virtual life and theory. It uses tools
from codework to traditional genre; much of its work is the result of
programming intended to create systems of circulating texts. Think of The
Wayward as a poetics of the imaginary, stumbling over the grounds of the
real - constantly questioning linguistic referents and 'meaning in
general.' The work is a ground-breaking exploration of the roots and
structures of online and offline life, in which language simultaneously
explodes and implodes. Conversations among 'emanents' dominate
inconceivable landscapes; sexualities are constructed and deconstructed.
There's not another work like it.

Being On Line, Net Subjectivity

content being developed by users of this form of exchange. Among the
thirty-two authors are Angela Hunter, Ellen Zweig, and Nesta Stubbs; net
feminist Doctress Neutopia; anthropologist Roger Bartra; and theorists
Friedrich Kittler, Slavoj Zizek, Mark Poster and Gregory Ulmer. Artists
include Mike Metz, Alice Aycock, Peter Halley.

Aw, I wish I could have sent you my thoughts re Marisol/Creeley
but the central control keeps saying that I am using attachm,ents

Gut Check
By CHRIS FLOYD

Iraq War Coverage Reminds Me of Vietnam
By JOHN R. MACARTHUR



They hang the man and flog the woman
That steal the goose from off the common,
But let the greater villain loose
That steals the common from the goose.

".....at a time when I am speaking to you about the paradox of desire -- in
the
sense that different goods obscure it -- you can hear outside the awful
language
of power.  There's no point in asking whether they are sincere or
hypocritical,
whether they want peace of whether they calculate the risks.  The dominating
impression as such a moment is that something that may pass for a prescribed
good; information addresses and captures impotent crowds to whom it is poured

forth like a liquor that leaves them dazed as they move toward the slaughter
house.
One might even ask if one would allow the cataclysm to occur without first
giving
free reign to this hubbub of voices...."

Many items on the sources for _Presences_ and its numerical
permutations. Creeley himself originally sketched out the latter in
Introd. to London ed. of _Mabel: A Story & Other Prose_ (rtp. in
_Collected Prose_, p. 266). Stephen Fredman's _Poet's Prose_ lists
sources for _Presences_ as Jose Ramon Medina's _Marisol_, a tape
recording, a Buddhist fable, and a painting by Nicolas Poussin
reproduced on a postcard. Sylvester's item in _Robert Creeley: The
Poet's Workshop_. (Three good sources nearly always.)

Hello everyone,

mIEKAL & I are working on an experimental documentary about Malok: "Eat
bugs to excitement. Perfect Malokian dogma." I need some commentary
about his work which I will include in the film. I would prefer that
your comments about Malok's work to be handwritten and/or voice
recorded on CD or recorded in aif file, wave file or mp3 file. These
are audio formats I can use. I will scan the piece of paper with your
handwriting & it will also become a clip in the film. Feel free to do
it in the way which represents you most. If you are interested please
send me your comments.

Send them to:

QUESTION

Allen Ginsberg would be 79 years old this year.  Although he has  always been
a controversial figure, a floodgate of vitriol against him has been  released
since his death.  He has been publicly branded a misogynist, a  pervert, a
clown, and many other things.  Not that he wasn't called these  things in his
lifetime, but since his death there has been a particularly  intense wave of
criticism coming from many different sources.

Are you familiar with these things I'm talking about?  If so, would  you care
to comment?

Also, what does Ginsberg's work mean to you and your own poems?

What else do you have to share with us about Ginsberg?  Please tell  us,
thank you.

By the time I actually got to meet A.G. he was the salesman of all things
beat--incl. the Jack Kerouac School of Disembodied Poetics.  His smiles
and his ear were reserved for the youngest members of the forum the
university provided, and he was a great salesman indeed!  When it came
time to read, however, these same young people shouted him down in the
name of Punk and all the other twitches they wanted to punish the
"establishment" for.  And sure--what did they see?  Some old guy up on
stage trying to be literate, for Chrissake!  It was a come-down.  It was
a bummer, but A.G. seemed happy enough, even though the Punks treated
him like Bozo the Clown.  He'd passed out his fliers for the Jack
Kerouac School of Disembodied Poetics!  He'd convinced a few of these
young men and several of the ladies to come on up to where Neal Cassidy
was more than a name in a book and revolution happened every day--or, at
least every other day!  A.G. was a real salesman, alright.  Not the
legend I'd come to see, with stars in my eyes.  Howl is a great poem--a
few of the others too. And the Jack Kerouac School of Disembodied
Poetics is a fine institution, but A.G. could probably have sold his
toenails to those pimply young kids if he'd said they'd come from Jack
Kerouac's buniony feet when he was walking up that mountain behind
Japhy Ryder.  I was sad to see that it was all dollars and cents with
A.G. at that time but now I know that life indeed is all dollars and
cents anyway. Even if the whole Beat thing was living in a room writing
poems, smoking pot, living cheap and banging on the bongo drums.  Once
you get old you want to become your own institution, you want to become
part of the establishment, you want to have health insurance and a
dental and retirement plan  A.G. is my Avatar in Heaven.  Jess

CAConrad;
Thank You!  Thank you! =20

I'll continue to read and re read the answers to the questions re: Allen =
Ginsberg. =20

Are you as fascinated as I over the fact that people are always more =
willing to believe and spread the news about a fellow human if the news =
is bad than they are if the news is good?  Tell me that Sally is a =
whore, and we'll help you spread the word; tell me she's a saint and =
we'll say, "prove it." =20

One hears far too little of the influence Ginsberg had on three =
generations of poets which followed him; and far too much of the details =
of what a detestable person he was.    =20

Where do the poet and the person separate?  Do they separate?  If one is =
a detestable misogynist, is one too a detestable poet?  Do the two =
characteristics negate each other algebraically?  Or is it entirely =
possible that a person might in fact be an asshole human socially at the =
same time he (or she) is a noteworthy and admirable artist? =20

Do artists pander to the idea that as artists they are required to =
develop an asocial personae? I have a friend from Milan.  When we met, =
he was in his early 30's and newly arrived in the U.S. At our first =
dinner party, he pinched all the wives present on the ass (and squeezed =
a breast of two).  Afterwards, when all the guests were gone and he and =
I sat in the den I asked him about his behavior.  He replied," Alex, I'm =
newly arrived from Italy; the women, they expect it of me."  He may have =
been right; no neighbor ever complained. =20

Culturally, do we have some level of expectation of misbehavior from our =
artists?  Did Ginsberg really only live up to his level of social =
misbehavior expectation? =20

But, most importantly, does any of that matter when one reads and =
evaluates the ultimate quality of the body of work the artist produced?  =
 Shouldn't all comments really focus on the artist's work over and above =
the artist's lifestyle or behavior or misbehavior? =20

Judging his work only, I size Allen Ginsberg up as a notable, =
influential and most controversial American poet of the 20th century, =
though I also note he is among the top five poets most notably ignored =
by the institutional literati.  How sad.=20

Dear Tom,

Just about the time you were writing your question I was buying IN =
COMPANY: ROBERT CREELEY'S COLLABORATIONS at the Brown University Bookstore =
in Providence where it was the last Creeley book in stock (I noticed, not =
too far away on the alphabetized shelf, 4 copies of my own book standing =
stalwart as they have stood through the past year of my life since I left =
them there, and as they may stand in the coming years, though I die).  =
Enjoying a rare day off, today, I read this terrific book, which comes =
with a cd rom designed by Kristin Prevallet, and thought of your question. =
 The book includes a thorough essay by John Yau, "Active Participants: =
Robert Creeley and the Visual Arts."  Here are some quotes which may be =
helpful:

ON COLLABORATIONS AROUND THE TIME OF PRESENCES=20

"Between the late '60s and mid '70s, Creeley was involved with numerous =
collaborations, three of which exemplify the different directions his =
writing took.  They are NUMBERS (Stuttgart: Edition Domberger and =
Dusseldorf: Galerie Schmela, 1968), with ten silkscreens by Robert =
Indiana; A DAY BOOK (Berlin: Graphis, 1972) with eight silkscreens and one =
lithograph by R. B. Kitaj; and PRESENCES: A TEXT FOR MARISOL (New York: =
Charles Scribner's Sons, 1976), with sixty-one black-and-white photographs =
of Marisol's sculptures.  In each case, Creeley was invited to be involved =
in a collaboration, which ranged from responding to a specific, recurring =
subject in the artist's work, to investigating his experience of the =
artist's work, to contributing something he conceived and wrote for the =
artist to respond to" (65).

Yau characterizes Creeley's approach in PRESENCES as "the various =
connected, overlapping, and discrete levels of experience one has when =
looking at, and walking around, a specific group of figurative sculptures =
in which the artist has defamilairized the familiar" (65).

ON YOUR COMMENT: "THE PROBLEM IS THE RELATIONSHIP OR LACK THEREOF BETWEEN =
THE WORDS AND THE IMAGES"

 "In PRESENCES: A TEXT FOR MARISOL (New York: Charles Scribner's sons, =
1976), for example, Creeley's attentiveness to the range of experiences =
one could have in the presence of Marisol's often satirical, large, =
painted sculptural tableaux or groupings of figures, becomes the starting =
point for his extended prose meditation.  By attempting to have his =
writing register the particulars of experience, which is the changing =
relationship of one's body and one's mind, and which, in this case, is =
framed by one's interaction with Marisol's sculptures, their figural =
presence, the poet is implicitly proposing that together, the art and =
writing form a focal point in which the viewer/reader learns something =
more about the nature of one's relationship to reality, which is time =
passing.  At the same time, by making a connection between the materiality =
of words and the materiality of Marisol's sculpture, Creeley addresses the =
relationship between the changing body and mind, and that of the contingent=
 world.  As bounded, physical beings being caught in time, how, Creeley =
seems to be asking in his text, do we keep attuned to the flux of reality =
when we are continually confronted by insistently different objects whose =
permanence works in counterpoint to our transience?  What are the ways we =
live in the unfolding presence?" (49)

CREELEY'S STRATEGY FOR PRESENCES

As with A DAY BOOK, his earlier collaboration with R.B. Kitaj, for =
PRESENCES Creeley decided "to write a text that was thirty single-spaced, =
typed pages" (67). =20

"In contrast to writing poems whose length was arrived at through the =
writing, he began using a scaffold to integrate a considerable length of =
writing with his passage both in time and through space.  Creeley's change =
in focus can be understood as a deliberate attempt to shift away from his =
preoccupation with mode, which was informed by his understanding of the =
relationship between "form" and "content," to deal with issues of scale.  =
By deciding in advance the number of pages and texts to be written, as =
well as how many pages there would be to a text, and how they would be =
divided, Creeley's scaffold was a way of formally incorporating time's =
passing into the writing; the modular units served as a measure.  At the =
same time, because of the demand he placed upon himself to write a prose =
work of a certain length, one which he had not previously explored, he was =
compelled to do something new, to apprehend his experience of reality from =
a different perspective." (66)

John Yau refers to a Creeley poem in commenting: "Numbers, for example, =
can be a way of comforting oneself (66).

YOUR QUESTION: IS IT REALLY A COLLABORATION?

"Published by a commercial press, PRESENCES: A TEXT FOR MARISOL (New York: =
Charles Scribner's Sons, 1976), is a major, innovative accomplishment in =
the history of collaboration, as well as a book no other post-war American =
poet has come close to equaling.  The tantamount contribution of the two =
collaborators is announced from the outset, both on the cover and on the =
spine:

                ROBERT CREELEY/MARISOL

In accordance with this equal billing, both Marisol and William Katz, the =
book's designer, as well as friend of both sculptor and poet, have done =
much to establish an open-ended yet corresponding dialogue between the =
sixty-one black-and-white photographs and the thirty single-spaced pages.  =
Because there is no index, and the book isn't paginated, the reader/viewer =
is not only invited to begin anywhere, but also there is the insistent =
sense that one can't return to exactly where one was, because that would =
imply the sequence is a fixed narrative, which it isn't" (68).

Yau also writes perceptively about the typography, suggesting that the =
large type imparts a physicality to the text, or an attempt at physicality =
on the part of language.  Yau also points out a parallel between the =
relation of the large sized words to "reality" and the relationship =
between the black and white photos and the sculptures' actual material =
presence and size: "Finally, in having the design integrate text and =
photographs, the entire book becomes a meditation on what is present or, =
to use Creeley's word, what is 'presence' in our experience of reading and =
sculpture" (70).

Yau also writes:

"In moving from an abstract mode to a chatty one, Creeley utilizes aspects =
one associates with horror stories, reportage, aspects of popular culture, =
and myth, without having any one of them become the determining mode of =
the writing.  And yet, despite these shifts and turns, all the writing is =
focused on different manifestations of human presence, as substantiated by =
physical objects, memory, or hostiry, for example.  It is in this regard =
that PRESENCES is inextricably linked to Marisol's figurative sculptures" =
(72).=20

I don't know if you will consider reviewing your observations, below, on =
the basis of these remarks.

<Also, there is the question of equality.  In most collaborations I've =
participated in,=20
<(mostly with other poets but occasionally with musicians and once with a =
painter) <the assumption is that the participants are equal whereas, when =
rereading this <book, I found myself devoting more time to Creeley than to =
Marisol just because <the took longer to read than the pictures required =
to be absorbed.

I have to admit, probably because of my own subject position, while =
reading IN COMPANY, I began to think of Creeley's commitment to collaborati=
on, in tandem with his commitment to materiality and his laying aside of =
the mind/body split, as a type of gender-work: perhaps an acknowledgement =
of femininity within the masculine, or an attempt to address gender-based =
dominations in aesthetics.

ON THE STRUCTURE OF THE TEXT=20

Yau goes into great detail (69-70) about the structure of Creeley's text, =
as announced by the set of numbers at the beginning of the book.  In =
summary: "The complete 'text" consists of five fields, each made up of six =
pages, divided according to a strictly adhered to mathematical progression,=
 all of which is made clear on the title page, where there is a grid =
consisting of five rows of three numbers" (70).

ON YOUR COMMENT: "MOST ARTIST/POET COLLABS I HAVE SEEN LIKE GEORGE =
SCHNEEMAN'S WITH MANY POETS OR THE ONES FRANK O'HARA PARTICIPATED IN HAVE =
THE WORDS INSERTED INTO THE VISUAL IMAGES WHEREAS THIS STRANGE BOOK HAS =
THE TWO DIFFERENT MEDIA RUNNING SIDE BY SIDE IN PARALLEL THOUGH ABUTTING =
WORLDS"

As you can see, Yau points to great sympathies between Creeley's text and =
the photos of Marisol's sculptures, and also between Creeley's writing and =
Marisol's sculptures, many more than I reproduce here.  The essay really =
is worth contemplating.  There's also an interesting footnote: "According =
to Creeley, Marisol wanted the text and photographs to formally echo each =
other.  The sequence in which the photographs were finally placed was =
decided by both Marisol and Katz, with their decisions being guided by =
their reading of the text (e-mail dated January 7, 1999).

Yau makes two other points worth considering here.  First, he says Creeley =
used collaboration with visual artists as a way to push the boundaries of =
his own conventions: "Collaboration wasn't thought of as an occasion, but =
as a possible way of getting beyond the limits of one's preoccupations" =
(Yau 65).  Secondly, Yau distinguishes between O'Hara and Creeley on the =
basis of abstraction/figuration: O'Hara was a "figurative poet," Creeley =
was primarily interested in abstraction. =20
John Yau has probably written more about correspondences and distinctions =
in O'hara's and Creeley's work with visual artists.

SOME COMMENTS ON COLLABORATION IN RESPONSE TO YOUR REQUEST

"Creeley's commitment to discovering a common ground between his work and =
that of the artist is what gives his collaborations a unique place within =
both his diverse oeuvre and within postwar American poetry" (49).

FINALLY

IN COMPANY generally presents Creeley, in his collaborations with visual =
artists after the 1950s, as taking his initiative from their work.  In =
fact, using collaboration as a form of expansion may have been a strategy. =
 He does not seem interested by words and images running on parallel =
tracks, as he may have been in the 50s.  Reading IN COMPANY reminded me =
strongly of my own small contact with Creeley in Providence: he had a =
genius for accommodating connection, for being available to connection on =
the terms of the other.  In my case, believe it or not, it was a reference =
he made to Patrick Kavanagh which sent me flying to him over the hurdles =
of my own shyness.  In some way, he was able to present an interface to =
even the shyest.  This quality must have informed his collaborations, and =
maybe also was nourished by them.  In addition to this hospitality, that =
personal magic, there is Creeley's understanding of poetry as a communal =
art, i.e., as the cd-rom accompanying IN COMPANY ends: "poetry is a team =
sport."

2 other complications:

1) Is Creeley attempting to be more figurative in PRESENCES in deference =
to Marisol's figurative work?
2) How does the fact that Creeley started the project with a grid, =
inherited in a sense from the previous Kitaj project, cauterize or =
facilitate his response to Marisol's sculptures/photos?

>>> Mairead Byrne 04/24/05 2:11 AM >>>
Dear Tom,

Just about the time you were writing your question I was buying IN =
COMPANY: ROBERT CREELEY'S COLLABORATIONS at the Brown University Bookstore =
in Providence where it was the last Creeley book in stock (I noticed, not =
too far away on the alphabetized shelf, 4 copies of my own book standing =
stalwart as they have stood through the past year of my life since I left =
them there, and as they may stand in the coming years, though I die).  =
Enjoying a rare day off, today, I read this terrific book, which comes =
with a cd rom designed by Kristin Prevallet, and thought of your question. =
 The book includes a thorough essay by John Yau, "Active Participants: =
Robert Creeley and the Visual Arts."  Here are some quotes which may be =
helpful:

ON COLLABORATIONS AROUND THE TIME OF PRESENCES=20

"Between the late '60s and mid '70s, Creeley was involved with numerous =
collaborations, three of which exemplify the different directions his =
writing took.  They are NUMBERS (Stuttgart: Edition Domberger and =
Dusseldorf: Galerie Schmela, 1968), with ten silkscreens by Robert =
Indiana; A DAY BOOK (Berlin: Graphis, 1972) with eight silkscreens and one =
lithograph by R. B. Kitaj; and PRESENCES: A TEXT FOR MARISOL (New York: =
Charles Scribner's Sons, 1976), with sixty-one black-and-white photographs =
of Marisol's sculptures.  In each case, Creeley was invited to be involved =
in a collaboration, which ranged from responding to a specific, recurring =
subject in the artist's work, to investigating his experience of the =
artist's work, to contributing something he conceived and wrote for the =
artist to respond to" (65).

Yau characterizes Creeley's approach in PRESENCES as "the various =
connected, overlapping, and discrete levels of experience one has when =
looking at, and walking around, a specific group of figurative sculptures =
in which the artist has defamilairized the familiar" (65).

ON YOUR COMMENT: "THE PROBLEM IS THE RELATIONSHIP OR LACK THEREOF BETWEEN =
THE WORDS AND THE IMAGES"

 "In PRESENCES: A TEXT FOR MARISOL (New York: Charles Scribner's sons, =
1976), for example, Creeley's attentiveness to the range of experiences =
one could have in the presence of Marisol's often satirical, large, =
painted sculptural tableaux or groupings of figures, becomes the starting =
point for his extended prose meditation.  By attempting to have his =
writing register the particulars of experience, which is the changing =
relationship of one's body and one's mind, and which, in this case, is =
framed by one's interaction with Marisol's sculptures, their figural =
presence, the poet is implicitly proposing that together, the art and =
writing form a focal point in which the viewer/reader learns something =
more about the nature of one's relationship to reality, which is time =
passing.  At the same time, by making a connection between the materiality =
of words and the materiality of Marisol's sculpture, Creeley addresses the =
relationship between the changing body and mind, and that of the contingent=
 world.  As bounded, physical beings being caught in time, how, Creeley =
seems to be asking in his text, do we keep attuned to the flux of reality =
when we are continually confronted by insistently different objects whose =
permanence works in counterpoint to our transience?  What are the ways we =
live in the unfolding presence?" (49)

CREELEY'S STRATEGY FOR PRESENCES

As with A DAY BOOK, his earlier collaboration with R.B. Kitaj, for =
PRESENCES Creeley decided "to write a text that was thirty single-spaced, =
typed pages" (67). =20

"In contrast to writing poems whose length was arrived at through the =
writing, he began using a scaffold to integrate a considerable length of =
writing with his passage both in time and through space.  Creeley's change =
in focus can be understood as a deliberate attempt to shift away from his =
preoccupation with mode, which was informed by his understanding of the =
relationship between "form" and "content," to deal with issues of scale.  =
By deciding in advance the number of pages and texts to be written, as =
well as how many pages there would be to a text, and how they would be =
divided, Creeley's scaffold was a way of formally incorporating time's =
passing into the writing; the modular units served as a measure.  At the =
same time, because of the demand he placed upon himself to write a prose =
work of a certain length, one which he had not previously explored, he was =
compelled to do something new, to apprehend his experience of reality from =
a different perspective." (66)

John Yau refers to a Creeley poem in commenting: "Numbers, for example, =
can be a way of comforting oneself (66).

YOUR QUESTION: IS IT REALLY A COLLABORATION?

"Published by a commercial press, PRESENCES: A TEXT FOR MARISOL (New York: =
Charles Scribner's Sons, 1976), is a major, innovative accomplishment in =
the history of collaboration, as well as a book no other post-war American =
poet has come close to equaling.  The tantamount contribution of the two =
collaborators is announced from the outset, both on the cover and on the =
spine:

                ROBERT CREELEY/MARISOL

In accordance with this equal billing, both Marisol and William Katz, the =
book's designer, as well as friend of both sculptor and poet, have done =
much to establish an open-ended yet corresponding dialogue between the =
sixty-one black-and-white photographs and the thirty single-spaced pages.  =
Because there is no index, and the book isn't paginated, the reader/viewer =
is not only invited to begin anywhere, but also there is the insistent =
sense that one can't return to exactly where one was, because that would =
imply the sequence is a fixed narrative, which it isn't" (68).

Yau also writes perceptively about the typography, suggesting that the =
large type imparts a physicality to the text, or an attempt at physicality =
on the part of language.  Yau also points out a parallel between the =
relation of the large sized words to "reality" and the relationship =
between the black and white photos and the sculptures' actual material =
presence and size: "Finally, in having the design integrate text and =
photographs, the entire book becomes a meditation on what is present or, =
to use Creeley's word, what is 'presence' in our experience of reading and =
sculpture" (70).

Yau also writes:

"In moving from an abstract mode to a chatty one, Creeley utilizes aspects =
one associates with horror stories, reportage, aspects of popular culture, =
and myth, without having any one of them become the determining mode of =
the writing.  And yet, despite these shifts and turns, all the writing is =
focused on different manifestations of human presence, as substantiated by =
physical objects, memory, or hostiry, for example.  It is in this regard =
that PRESENCES is inextricably linked to Marisol's figurative sculptures" =
(72).=20

I don't know if you will consider reviewing your observations, below, on =
the basis of these remarks.

<Also, there is the question of equality.  In most collaborations I've =
participated in,=20
<(mostly with other poets but occasionally with musicians and once with a =
painter) <the assumption is that the participants are equal whereas, when =
rereading this <book, I found myself devoting more time to Creeley than to =
Marisol just because <the took longer to read than the pictures required =
to be absorbed.

I have to admit, probably because of my own subject position, while =
reading IN COMPANY, I began to think of Creeley's commitment to collaborati=
on, in tandem with his commitment to materiality and his laying aside of =
the mind/body split, as a type of gender-work: perhaps an acknowledgement =
of femininity within the masculine, or an attempt to address gender-based =
dominations in aesthetics.

ON THE STRUCTURE OF THE TEXT=20

Yau goes into great detail (69-70) about the structure of Creeley's text, =
as announced by the set of numbers at the beginning of the book.  In =
summary: "The complete 'text" consists of five fields, each made up of six =
pages, divided according to a strictly adhered to mathematical progression,=
 all of which is made clear on the title page, where there is a grid =
consisting of five rows of three numbers" (70).

ON YOUR COMMENT: "MOST ARTIST/POET COLLABS I HAVE SEEN LIKE GEORGE =
SCHNEEMAN'S WITH MANY POETS OR THE ONES FRANK O'HARA PARTICIPATED IN HAVE =
THE WORDS INSERTED INTO THE VISUAL IMAGES WHEREAS THIS STRANGE BOOK HAS =
THE TWO DIFFERENT MEDIA RUNNING SIDE BY SIDE IN PARALLEL THOUGH ABUTTING =
WORLDS"

As you can see, Yau points to great sympathies between Creeley's text and =
the photos of Marisol's sculptures, and also between Creeley's writing and =
Marisol's sculptures, many more than I reproduce here.  The essay really =
is worth contemplating.  There's also an interesting footnote: "According =

This Welcome Message updated 27 March 2005.

--------------------------------------------

Above the world-weary horizons
New obstacles for exchange arise
Or unfold, O ye postmasters!

1. About the Poetics List

With the preceding epigraph, the Poetics Listserv was founded by
Charles Bernstein in late 1993. Now in its fourth incarnation, the
list has about 1200 subscribers worldwide. We also have a substantial
number of nonsubscribing readers, who access the list through our web
site (see archive URL above).

The Poetics List is not a forum for a general discussion of poetry or
for the exchange of unsolicited poems. Our aim is to support, inform,
and extend those directions in poetry that are committed to
innovations, renovations, and investigations of form and/or/as
content, to the questioning of received forms and styles, and to the
creation of the otherwise unimagined, untried, unexpected, improbable,
and impossible. While we recognize that other lists may sponsor other
possibilities for exchange, we request that those participating in
this forum keep in mind the specialized and focused nature of this
project and respect our decision to operate a moderated list. The
Poetics List exists to support and encourage divergent points of view
on innovative forms of modern and contemporary poetry and poetics, and
we are committed to do what is necessary to preserve this space for
such dialog.

Due to the high number of subscribers, we no longer maintain the open
format with which the list began (at under 100 subscribers). The
specific form of moderation that we employ is a relatively fluid one:
in most cases, messages are reviewed after having been posted to the
list, and difficulties resolved on that basis; however, the listserv
editorial board may shift between this and a pre-review mode which
calls for all messages to be read and approved before being forwarded
to the list. We prefer to avoid this option as it hampers the
spontaneity of discussion that we hope to promote. In addition to
these options, the editorial board will unsubscribe individuals if
they are not, in our opinion, productively contributing to the list or
following our guidelines. We remain committed to this editorial
function as a defining element of the Poetics List.

Please also note that this is a private list and information about
this list should not be posted to other lists or directories of lists.
The idea is to keep the list membership to those with specific rather
than general interests, and also to keep the scale of the list
relatively small and the volume manageable. The current limits of the
list are 50 messages per day, and two messages per subscriber per day.

In addition to being archived at through the EPC
(http://epc.buffalo.edu) and at
http://listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu/archives/poetics.html, some posts to
Poetics (especially reviews, obituary notices, announcements, etc.)
may also become part of specific EPC subject areas. Brief reviews of
poetry events and publications are always welcome; we also encourage
posts that announce events important to our subscribers. See section 5
for details.

----------------------------

2. Posting to the List

The Poetics List is a moderated list. All messages are reviewed by the
editors in keeping with the goals of the list as articulated in this
Welcome Message (see section 1).

Please note that while this list is primarily concerned with
discussions of poetry and poetics, messages relating to politics and
political activism, film, art, media, and so forth are also welcome.
We strongly encourage subscribers to post information, including web
links, relating to publications (print and internet), reading series,
and blogs that they have coordinated, edited, published, or in which
they appear. Such announcements constitute a core function of this
list. Brief reviews of poetry events and publications (print or
digital) are always welcome.

We do not accept unsolicited postings of creative work not directed
toward a discussion of poetics issues on the list. The Poetics List is
not a venue for the posting of free-standing, personal poems or
journal entries. Note, however, that the editors will, from time to
time, solicit creative contributions, including ongoing list-based
projects and edited collections of poems. Please note that such
contributions appear by special invitation only.

To post to the Poetics List, send your messages directly to the list
address: poetics@listserv.buffalo.edu.

For further information on posting to the list, see section 6 below.

-----------------------------------------

3. Subscriptions

*For all subscription requests go to
http://listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu/archives/poetics.html.

*To subscribe for the first time click on "Subscribe (join) a List."
Immediately following your subscription to the poetics listserv we ask
that you email poetics@buffalo.edu, subject-line "registration," with
your full name, street address, email address, and telephone number.
Failure to register at the time of subscription will result in
automatic deletion from the subscription roll.

*To manage your subscription (for descriptions of the different
subscription options please see section 3), click on "Subscriber's
Corner."

Subscriptions to the Poetics List are free of charge, but formal
registration is required. All other questions about subscriptions,
whether about an individual subscription or subscription policy,
should be addressed to this same administrative address.

PLEASE NOTE: All subscription-related information and correspondence
remains absolutely confidential.

All posts to the list must provide your full real name, as registered.
If there is any discrepancy between your full name as it appears in
the "from" line of the message header, please sign your post at the
bottom. Subscribers who do not include their full name with each post
will be unsubcribed form the list.

The most frequent problem with subscriptions is bounced messages. If
your system is often down or if you have a low disk quota, Poetics
messages may get bounced, which will result in your subscription being
automatically terminated by the Listserv program and the automatically
generated message telling you that this has occurred will also likely
bounce. If this happens, you may re-subscribe to the list by the same
process described above. One remedy to avoid this happening in the
future: set your list options to "no-mail" and read the list on the
web.

-------------------------------

4. Subscription Options

We encourage you to alter your subscription options via the link on
the right side of the screen at
http://listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu/archives/poetics.html. If you would
prefer not to use the web-interface, you may also email
<listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu> the following commands:

*to subscribe to the Poetics listserv send
listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu this one-line message with no "subject":
sub poetics [your Firstname and Lastname]

*RECOMMENDED: if you wish to read the list on our web interface and
not receive any messages sent directly, while remaining subscribed to
the list and so eligible to send us posts, send this one-line message
to <listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu> with no "subject": set poetics
nomail. Note: this option is also useful for temporary suspension of
email service.

*to reactivate Poetics e-mail send <listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu>
this one-line message with no "subject": set poetics mail

* to receive the list in digest form (you will receive the day's
individual posts in one email sent just after midnight EST), send
<listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu> this one-line message with no
"subject": set poetics digest

*to receive posts in the default option (you will receive individual
postings immediately), send <listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu> this one-
line message with no "subject": set poetics nodigest

* to receive the list in index form (you will receive a list, without
the text of the posts, of the subjects discussed each day along with
the author's name and address and the number of lines it comprises;
you can also choose to have the index sent to you in either plain text
or in HTML format with hyperlinks), send
<listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu> this one-line message with no
"subject": set poetics nohtml index --or-- set poetics html index

PLEASE NOTE: do not leave your Poetics subscription in default or
digest mode if you are going to be away for any extended period of
time. Your account may become flooded and you may lose Poetics
messages as well as other important mail. In such cases, switch your
subscription to "nomail" as recommended above.

-------------------------

5. To Unsubscribe

To unsubscribe (or change any of your subscription options), again, we
strongly encourage you to go to the right-hand side of the screen at
http://listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu/archives/poetics.html You may also
may unsubscribe by sending a one-line email to
<listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu> with no "subject": unsub poetics

If you are having difficulty unsubscribing, please note: sometimes
your e-mail address may be changed slightly by your system
administrator. If this happens you will not be able to send messages
to Poetics or to unsubscribe, although you will continue to receive
mail from the Poetics List. To avoid this problem, unsub using your
old address, then resubscribe with your new email address.

----------------

6. Cautions

"Flame" messages will not be tolerated on the Poetics List. We define
'flaming' as any post that resembles a personal attack or personal
insult to anyone--subscriber or not. This of course includes racial
slurs as well as ad hominem arguments in which the person rather than
their work is attacked; in other words while critique of a person's
work is welcome (critical inquiry is one of the main functions of the
list), this critique cannot extend to a critique or criticism of the
person.

The listserv is intended to be a productive communal space for
discussion and announcements; as such, subscribers who do not follow
listserv policy on flaming will be removed from the subscription roll.

For reasons of basic security, we do not allow pseudonymous
subscriptions. All messages intended for the Poetics List should be
sent in Text-Only format, without attachments. We do not accept
HTML-formatted messages or attached files. As a general rule, keep
individual posts to 1,000 words or less.

Please do not publish list postings without the express permission of
the author. Posting on the list is a form of publication. Copyright
for all material posted on Poetics remains with the author; material
from this list and its archive may not be reproduced without the
author's permission, beyond the standard rights accorded by "fair use"
of published materials.

As an outside maximum, we will accept no more than 2 messages per day
from any one subscriber. Also, given that our goal is a manageable
list (manageable both for moderators and subscribers), the list
accepts 50 or fewer messages per day.

Like all systems, the listserv will sometimes be down: if you feel
your message has been delayed or lost, *please wait at least one day
to see if it shows up*, then check the archive to be sure the message
is not posted there; if you still feel there is a problem, you may
wish to contact the editors at <poetics@acsu.buffalo.edu>.

In the end of course Allen Ginsberg's work is what's important,
but first it seems essential to address these issues which attempt
to negate the man's life and work.

Misogyny is not to be taken lightly, in either direction.  But I  simply
do not see evidence that he was a misogynist.  Ignoring someone
just doesn't cut it.  I mean, I'm COMPLETELY indifferent to  figuring
skating enthusiasts, but I don't hate them.

And not only that, just imagine being as famous as Ginsberg.  In  other
words, people always tugging at you wanting something.  And he  was
famous for the better part of his life, meaning he probably had to  shut
a switch off inside once in a while just to get a little peace.

When I saw him read in Philadelphia years ago the clamoring after
the reading lasted longer than the reading.  Everyone loved him, as  they
should have because he was remarkable in person.  He really filled  you
with the best there is in what poetry CAN do.

the link for the station.

My sincere apologies for the shameless
self-promotion; but how else can
I let you know about it?

I will mostly be
reading works originally
published on blogs and webzines,
including poems from my Chax chapbook,
*Hegelian Honeymoon*;
you may also be hearing some poems
from the PennSound website.

Hope you can tune in!

Hi Craig--

Thanks for this project -- fun to read in general, and necessary, I
think, to raise the level of discussion on Ginsberg.  Anselm B.'s
remarks especially were great:  "The problem is the lack of depthful
conversation, writing and thinking about Ginsberg's work. It's much
easier to talk about him as a figure because that, generally speaking,
requires very little effort of mind at all."  As he wrote, we'd have "no
Allen Ginsberg-as-social-phenomenon without his poems," and the poems
themselves (beyond "Howl" and "Kaddish") don't get talked about enough.
We already have too much biographical work on the Beats in the guise of
critical response, and not enough on the works themselves.


Best,
Tony

MIME-Version: 1.0

Filtering filtering


Reworked from a 1978 Toronto Notebook, "On the successive eliminations of
the entity in transformations"

or rather all that is necessary from the diagrams

a -> a' -> a''
  f    f'

The function f moves a to a'; f' moves a' to a'' and of course there is a
composition f'f(a) -> a'' or some such. a' disappears as an entity, and on
might generalize, considering a series of functions f, f', f'', f''' ...
such that (ff'f''f'''(z)) is a filter over z. In the lifeworld, f^n
extends in either direction, i.e. n ranges over the integers at the least.
In reality, n ranges over the continuum. Every entity z carries its filter
and a filter is non-existent without an entity. The continuous transfor-
mation of the entity is defined by the filter and vice-versa. Since z may
split in the process, the filter may split. The series of f need not
define any particular entity, but may be considered split from a previous
entity, i.e. one out of an almost infinite number of processes, infinite
in relation to the continuum. In this fashion, the worlding process is
visible, the entity disappears, as entities do. Entities are named _in any
case_ in relation to space-time; too great a dispersion, and 'entity'
disappears qua entity; the background microwave radiation of the universe
is an example. Too small a dispersion, virtual particles for example, ad
'entity' is ontologically problematic. Within everyday life, water and
other liquids, as well as gases, are not considered entities, while glass,
also liquid, is. It's a question of a family of usages in relation to
viscosity for example. There is also a notion of intrinsic identity based
on communality and communication; humans are entities, although rapidly
undergoing decomposition. Reichenbach's genidentity may be of value here;
it references the actual material substrate of a coherent object, held
together over a substantial period of time, and undergoing change qua
object. Such an object brings human phenomenology with it; objects out-
gas, wear, dissolve, split, from what might temporarily be considered an
origin. All origins and all endpoints are subject to filtering, which
dissolves them as such. One is left with continuous birthing, continuous
languaging and worlding, something related to Bohm's implicate order on
one hand and maya on the other. Of course the filtering itself is
filtered, there is no end to it. To be human is to attempt to halt such,
impede what is identified as dissolution, death, permanent impediment.
Ownership arises out of this, as does the urge to collect, related to the
urge to hunt, to permanently annihilate, absorb, be reborn in the blood of
the other. To stay with the filter is to remain analogic, deeply human,
chthonic; to impede is to construct the digital, build, aerate, delude.
The digital is always already inauthentic, Vaihinger's as-if which resides
for and in the moment. Culture veers among the various orders, as if the
world and its history is ordered and orderly; it is the sympathetic, not
empathetic, magic of this that allows us to survive.

not true  books are important

sometimes we must  sadly  hawk them ourselves  or give them away
because they are poorly distributed or not distributed at al

i've had lots of chaps out lately  no isbns  no distribution

some easy to read  some a bit harder
the only way i can get them to folks is to basically sell them myself

still waiting for the one over 50 pages  w/ a real isbn

and even that one i'm  sure i'll have to hustle

some folks  find that ugly  or hard to do
is is a bit self-degrading  this adverting  as  drn sees it
but sometimes it's the only way to get yer work seen
like reading in public  which many of us hate
is sometimes tthe only vehicle to get the stuff from your hands to their
shelf

as e.m. and i once discussed  it's  nice if they loved you after you read
but if they didn't buy a book  it means they didn't love you enough to
take you home

so even if it hur4ts when you can   carry a book in yer pocket

amy i think your reasons  for not wanting to be published must go deeper

Time Magazine's Buried Hitler Cover

--from CounterPunch  4/24

A week after he was praised in Life=92s magazine=92s =93100 Most =
Influential=20
People=94 issue, Time magazine, in its scheduled April 20, 1934, issue=20=

went a step further by making the controversial German black-shirt=20
nationalist, just installed as chancellor, the subject of a lengthy=20
cover story, bearing the title quoted in the headline to this item.=20
Eventually, after a last minute reconsideration by Time=92s boss, Henry=20=

Luce, the cover story was shelved in favor of a report on the farm=20
crisis in the Midwest. The Hitler story was already rolling off the=20
presses when Luce issued the order to change the cover. The dumped=20
edition, recently came to light in a long-lost Luce archive.

Throughout the article, Time=92s reporters and rewrite team gave Hitler=20=

every benefit of the doubt. Hitler=92s notoriously vitriolic hate speech=20=

was alternately dismissed as a put-on or excused as =93from his heart.=94=20=

The worst Time could say about Hitler is that he could =93occasionally =
be=20
coarse,=94 citing Hitler=92s oft-repeated claim that Jews are =93genetic=20=

garbage=94. Time readers learned that Hitler is an omnivorous reader =
(the=20
report mentions Gobineau and several American writers on population=20
control), and that he regards himself =93as a public intellectual.=94

Hitler is dubbed =93iconic=94 by Time because he =93epitomizes the way=20=

politics is now discussed in the Munich beer halls.=94

=93Hitler has a reputation for carelessness with facts, =93 Time =
reported,=20
adding that its checking staff =93did not in fact find many outright=20
errors,=94 though the magazine acknowledged that Hitler was, in a sense,=20=

hard to =93fact check=94 because he =93rarely makes arguments based on=20=

facts=94.

Throughout the cover story, Time presents instances where Hitler has=20
been allegedly misunderstood or underappreciated. Hitler, it claims,=20
=93likes to shock reporters by wondering aloud whether Germany might be=20=

better off if the world was rid of global lice like Slavs, gypsies and=20=

Jews=94 but writes or speaks such things on =93only to get a rise out of=20=

journalists=94 and enhance his political profile. Time recalls a 1932=20
Munich rally where Hitler offered his typical hyperbole: =93We must=20
drench the world in blood in retribution for Germany=92s past injuries=94.=
=20
Unfortunately, writes Time, =93his drench-the-world bit=94 would later =
be=20
wrenched from context and repeatedly quoted as Hitlerian nuttiness or=20
worse, The context, apparently, is that Hitler was laughing when he=20
said it. Time admits that maybe not everyone would find the line funny.

Time downplayed Hitler =92s record of rank racism. Recounting his =
defense=20
of racial purification, Time wrote, =93It would be easier to accept=20
Hitler=92s reasoning if a shadow of bigotry didn=92t attach to many of =
his=20
statements about Slavs and Jews.=94

Experts on Time=92s history note that there was considerable pressure on=20=

the Luce empire in circulation wars with Hearst publications, whose=20
proprietor, William Randolph Hearst, was an open admirer of Hitler.=20
Admiration for Hitler was widespread among newspaper publishers. A few=20=

weeks earlier the New York Times had editorially welcomed Hitler=92s=20
assumption of the German chancellorship.

The Human Comedy

Here in New Orleans this beautiful first weekend morning of Jazzfest I=20=

stood on the corner of Esplanade and Chartres, on my way to a locksmith=20=

to avert a repeat of the imprisonment of all my belongings in the trunk=20=

of the =9282 240D Mercedes I just acquired in South Carolina. As so=20
often, blame it on the vacuum system, and maybe a worn key. On the=20
grassy median strip of Esplanade stood a young woman, in black jeans=20
and t-shirt, multiply pierced, pale of face and looking as though the=20
night had been a rough one.

Twenty yards away from her down the median strip stood a solemn young=20
man in long heavy black overcoat and other Gothick accessories. The=20
young woman gazed at him forlornly and finally called out, =93Can=92t we=20=

discuss this like normal people.=94 I=92m glad to say the Goth finally=20=

shambled forward and a muted reconciliation transpired.

Nourished by this affecting site, I discovered that all locksmiths in
New Orleans, notably Rocks Locks on Paris Ave, close for the weekend=20
and turned my attention towards Ann Coulter, whose appearance on the=20
cover of Time had provoked a monstrous explosion in CounterPunch's=20
inbox. Pleasing testament to the sound cultural values of New Orleans,=20=

Time was hard to find. I eventually ran a copy to earth on the fourth=20
floor of Virgin Records on Decatur, lurking among the glamor and beauty=20=

mags. I handed it over to the man behind the counter who glanced at La=20=

Coulter's image with a shudder and hissed, "I can't stand to display=20
her books. Shall I put this under plain cover." I agreed it would be=20
unfair to the strollers on Decatur to flaunt Coulter on my arm and so=20
he shoved her into a brown paper bag.

I read the Coulter piece back at the Richelieu and asked myself the=20
question answered above. James Wolcott, my colleague at the Village=20
Voice long years ago and now Vanity Fair's Supreme Pontiff on media=20
matters, had an excellent comment on his site, beginning thus:


"...It's not worth wasting any more outrage on the subject of Ann=20

legs and long shiny hair and a reputation for extending the cocktail=20

I haven't read much of this thread, but I think that the Ginsberg "problem"
is similar to the "Stein problem."  The personalities are so large that they
get in the way of the work.  Allen needs his Ulla Dydo who will go  to the
manuscripts and take things back to a  biography of the text.

Tony---I liked Anselm's comments too, but taking just that one by itself,
       I feel it tends to ignore that, for Ginsberg, the figure was actually
       part of the work.
       "GENERALLY speaking" it may require little effort of mind to
       talk about Ginsberg as a figure than a poet primarily on the page,
       but to reduce G to poet on the page
                also may flatter many poet peoples' mind habits as well.
        Allen's importance may be as much as "figure"
        as the "works themselves"
            but that you can't have one without the other
             is just something people either can't or won't or
             are afraid to do, because it challenges their little boxes.
       It may require much "effort of mind" to ignore or downplay the
"figure"--but what KIND of "mind"?
            you know, like the classical Cartesian mind separated from
                   the body...
             But, don't worry Tony, I'm sure academic dissertations
              (if that's what you really want) on Ginsberg will again become
              as fashionable as ones on Spicer might be now--

Sorry, too, if I sound a little "pissy" here--I'm not ultimately trying to
be divisive. Both of us obviously value Ginsberg highly, if for (seemingly)
different reasons and, as such, he'd appreciate both of our interests.

I think both you and I are speaking from different perspectives about things
we see not being paid enough attention to--
          and at best there's a symbiosis between the work and the figure
          that is obviously IN "the poems themselves"
             (to paraphrase a famous dictim of The New Criticism
               and maybe you're right, there's too much emphasis,
                even if it's positive, on judging the writing by the man,
                but to me part of what allowed Ginsberg to help shatter
                what was so deadening about The New Criticism
                was precisely his willingness to push the limits
                 of that well-worn distinction between
                "thought" and "action," or "work" and "figure"
                and I personally feel it requires much EFFORT OF MIND
                (and more!) to not only consider its implications
                 for those of us of not yet "disembodied poetics"

An essay included in *My Way: Speeches and Poems* addresses some of the
issues discussed in this thread. It's called "Unrepresentative Verse"--
http://epc.buffalo.edu/authors/bernstein/essays/unrepresentive-verse.html

I also wanted to mention that I read "The Ballad of the Girlie Man" on
Leonard Lopates's WNYC radio, which aired on Friday:

even much interesting work done  on AG before his death is long out of
print, viz. one of my favorite pieces, Eric Mottram's essay "The Wild
Good and the Heart Ultimately: Ginsberg's Art of Persuasion" published
in 1978 by Allen Fisher's Spanner Press ( it is a fifty page,
single-spaced, legal sized piece, i.e. a small book-length work).
Mottram, btw, taught HOWL a year after its publicatrion, in 1958, at
the University of Utrecht, Holland.

maybe time for someone to put together a good volume of both older and
newer essays on Ginsie's poetry & poetics?

I do think we're close to the same thing here.  I prefer, too, a
symbiosis between "work" and "figure."  Maybe my comments, done quickly,
made things seem (new critically or otherwise) like we need total
devotion to the work alone.  I meant instead that we need to move away
from what we've had too much of already -- Beat biography (sometimes
hagiography) at the expense of craft and context.  I say this as someone
influenced, both as a poet & scholar, by AG's "work" and his "figure."

So I don't want to "downplay the 'figure'" (especially for the sake of a
dualist "mind" separated from "figure" or body).  Instead, I'm happy to
see Anselm remind us that it's time to move away from extreme emphasis
on "figure" so that we might look closely (but without overemphasis) on
the poems.  You mentioned academic dissertations.  They can be part of
this movement to combine figure and work, sure, but I think we'd both
agree that engaged commentary doesn't have to exist solely in that
realm.  We need more good essays and books -- and of course
dissertations would have to be part of this (since dissertations are one
way that folks learn to work out the long, extended ideas that become
books).

For me, it's great to see that an interconnection of biography and work
is starting to happen with the Beats (and by some of us on this list).
The extremes of biography were necessary in their time, but they don't
have to be the only way to go -- and this sensibility was what worked
best for me in Anselm's comments.

Best,
Tony

Dear Anny,

STUNG
by your speculation that I am unable to sell my poetry, I returned to the =
Brown Bookstore today.  My books jumped straight into my arms.  What could =
I do but read them, halting browsers in their tracks (more than they were =
already halted), delivering my poems to man, woman, child, & one professor =
of cognitive science, selling them, so they did not have to return to the =
shame of the shelf but left the store in shiny plastic bags, waving =
vigorously.=20

REMEMBERING
that the Brown Bookstore had long since paid me for my books I took care =
not to extract from the new owners wads of cash (my habit at readings) but =
to direct them & their credit cards to the register or sales point or cash =
desk or whatever the correct nomenclature in this specific case.

ANOTHER POSSIBILITY
I returned to the Brown Bookstore & counted my books, finding not 5 as I =
thought, nor 4 as I wrote, but 3.  Why imagine the worst.

AND POSSIBLE ALSO
that the 3 books on the shelf were not survivors of the original group, =
slashed & signed with my name, with postcards inserted at pp 81 &110.  =
That these were 3 new books, summoned by print-on-demand to replace the =
original books, even the replacements of the original books.  These 3 were =
the descendants of batches-on- batches of books.  Why imagine the worst.  =
Poetry: famously joyous.

SOME OF THESE SCENARIOS OCCURRED
but the significant thing is

I AM A STALWART SELLER OF POETRY (ASK RANDOLPH)
It is not that my writing is difficult.  If it is, I will change it.  Or =
that I am a poor saleswoman.  My poems need my warm voice.   I sell books =
at poetry readings.  People buy my HURUBURU when I read.  Now that I am =
reading from two new manuscripts, I give pages away.  I feel like Kenny =
Goldsmith.  I email poems to those who ask.  Now I need new books to sell. =
=20

I THROW MY WEIGHT BEHIND MY POEMS
I feel like Kent Johnson.

THE BROWN BOOKSTORE
is honorable.  My reputation is smaller than my presence.  My poems need =
me as much as I need them.  I need to read, not browse, in the Brown =
Bookstore.

PUBLICATION
Dear Anny, publication is the most marvelous word.  I want to have books =
to sell.
I want them to sell happily, to know the buyers are getting a bargain and =
that everyone: poet-author, poet-publisher, poet-reader & poetry book: all =
are happy in the exchange.

ME
I who am nicely dressed and dyed can well show up with bunches of books to =
say a couple of nonsenses & finally smile & invite people to buy.  No =
better woman.  I who am radiantly happy to read, can smile.  My audience =
is not lurid.  Friends.

MIDNIGHT
is what I had to wait for to send this.

ADAMANTLY
no businesswoman, I am able to sell.

Hi Mairead,
 re.: your stiff books on the shelves ___ that is mainly why I do not =
want=20
to publish, even if asked to!
 The fact that they are still there means many things:
 1_ your writings are too difficult for the average narrow-minded =
dumbness=20
(if you wrote sci-fi or about fairies they might have disappeared by =
now,=20
not to mention complicated and especially hot_peppered love stories =
with=20

same-sex=20
disturbing element - it seems that people adore similar pastiches)
 2_ you are not able to sell. This is what my friend let me notice. We =
were=20
attending a meeting and this guy showed up with a bunch of his books, said =
a=20
couple of nonsenses and finally smiled and invited people to buy them. =
The=20
nicely dressed and dyed ladies rushed to get a signed copy. The moral? =
Never=20

straight in mind: S E L L to this lurid audience. A lot of people like to =
be=20
treated badly - I know you would never dare, that is why you are not able =
to=20
sell.
 3_ (do I have to continue or did you get the message?=20
 On another tone, I have Mairead Byrne's Nelson & the Huruburu Bird, and =
it=20
is a great Treat! You people wake up, life is better than what they want =
you=20
to think.
 Take care, Anny

Looking for an artist, writer, musician or other creative person to rent =
this very special little house.  This house is perfect for one person =
and possibly a pet.  It is a one bedroom house with a separate art =
studio in the back which is connected by a beautiful deck.   This house =
has many artistic touches throughout including a hand carved beam =
shipped from Pakistan to hold up a loft and hand crafted desks and =
shelves in the art studio.  The landscaping is primarily native =
vegetation and it has the feel of being in the forest but it's right in =
town.  There is a washer/dryer, carport, storage shed, and dog house.  =
The rent is $650 per month with 1st/last (last can be paid in =
installments if needed) and deposit.  It will be available after May =
15th.  I'm very interested in finding the right person for this house, =
someone who will appreciate it and find inspiration from being there.

Subject:      On Charles Bernstein's "Unrepresentive-verse"
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="iso-8859-1"
Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable

Theodore Adorno wrote: "Cultural criticism finds itself faced with the =
final stage of the dialectic of culture and barbarism. To write poetry =
after Auschwitz is barbaric. And this corrodes even the knowledge of why =
it has become impossible to write poetry..."

Charles Bernstein in his 1997 essay titled, "Unrepresentive-verse" =
commented about an Auden and an Adorno quote and wrote:=20

"...But it might be even more telling to say that, after Auchwitz, it is =
not only the individual voice of lyric poetry but also the =
ventriloquised voice of public discourse (in poetry and the massed =
media) that flirts with barbarism by reifying individuality and =
publicity, as if they were the same thing, in the quenchless desire for =
absorption by the Culture-at-Large."

Mr. Bernstein's comment lends credibility to the Adorno quote by failing =
to reject the quote and=20
place it in its proper cultural context by debunking the statement as =
utter nonsense.  How asinine a statement Adorno has made!=20

Of course, actions at Auschwitz represent some of the lowest forms of =
human behavior ever completed in recorded history.  But what better =
device to condemn the atrocities and expose the realities of the horrors =
of men's actions than the most emotional of communicative devices =
available to language users than poetry?  And if that poetry is =
Barbaric, so be it.  And who better to employ those poetic devices and =
deliver them to the people than the poets?  Failure to act here, Mr. =
Bernstein, takes poetry from the people and turns the power of poetry =
into the dud of political rhetoric.=20

In total contrast to the Adorno statement, the simple truth of the Auden =
statement swells to underscore the asininity of Adorno's comment...in =
fact, nothing happens in poetry because of the idiocy of the Adorno cop =
out, and the acceptance of such asininity by esteemed poets and members =
of the poetic community such as Mr. Charles Bernstein.  This acceptance =
lends further credibility to the Auden message...nothing happens because =
poets do nothing when they should in fact create their most poignant =
works.=20

Mr. Bernstein, at your conference presentation, you should  have been =
screaming with rage and ranting with poetic and emotional furor at the =
likes of Adorno's comment.  If ever there were sane and civil reasons =
for creating poetry, it is the Barbaric horror of Auschwitz.  These =
atrocious acts need to be exposed for the horrors they are...will lyric =
verse lend a tone of civility to the horror?  Not if the poet does the =
job well.  Will the poet become the Barbarian simply by exposing the =
savage behavior humans are capable of?  Again, not if the poet is up to =
the task. And more importantly, will poetry accomplish something by =
having attempted to expose the baseness humans are capable of as they =
embrace principals and ideals that value ideology more than they value =
human life?  Poetry may very well do just that.

Perhaps the only real Barbarism modern poets are guilty of is not =
writing poetry after Auschwitz.  And then too poets may be failing to =
differentiate between the worthwhile and the worthless...failing to =
stand and through their poetry attempt to make something happen in the =
broader social and cultural context. =20

But then, Auden was a brilliant chap; he was probably right about =
poetry.  Seems he may have been right at least about poets, some make =
nothing happen. =20

WORKSHOPS

THE WORKING WRITER SEMINAR, with Kathryn Radeff

How to Write A Book Proposal
Saturday, May 7
Single Saturday Session: $50, $40 for members

Mini workshops are fun, fast-paced, informational and inspirational. In an
easy-to-understand manner, the sessions present the fundamentals of creative
writing as they apply to fact-based articles and personal experience, as
well as the craft of fiction. Lectures and writing exercises, which are used
to illustrate the concepts, are aimed at developing the writers'
understanding of structure, description, dialogue, character, style and
voice. Workshops also cover the art of writing query letters, research and
interviewing techniques, manuscript preparation and submission strategies.
Ideal for the beginner and skilled writer, mini-day workshops provide an
excellent overview of their fields. The goal is to have an article or short
story well underway by the time the session ends. An extensive analysis of
one completed piece is included. There will be one 30-minute break. The
workshop includes a question and answer session.

Required Course Book/Workbook ($13): You Can Be A Working Writer by Kathryn
Radeff Payable to the instructor

POEM = SOUND = BODY, with Marj Hahne
Saturday, May 14, 12-5 p.m.
$50, $40 members

Ezra Pound said that poetry begins to atrophy when it departs too far from
music, and music begins to atrophy when it departs too far from the dance.
How do we source our poems from our own body's rhythms, so that our poems
are bodies of sound-sound bodies-durable because they are built from the
language's meaning and music? Memorable poems are often those that get
inside and move both our brain (what's said is heard) and our body (what's
unsaid is felt). In this workshop, for beginning and practiced poets, we
will generate lots of new writing while attending to sound, with sample
poems selected for their musicality.

Marj Hahne is a poet and teaching artist who has performed and taught
extensively around the country. Her work has appeared in Paterson Literary
Review, Painted Bride Quarterly, Schuylkill Valley Journal of the Arts, Mad
Poets Review, and La Petite Zine. She also has a CD titled notspeak.

Allen was always generous to me. I've heard the stories, of course, but =
he's gone now. Why not look at the gifts he gave us, instead of =
criticizing the man who no longer exists? The proof is in the poetry. =
Like with many great artists, some of it, I think, is not very good. But =
there are also the large masterpieces, and the wonderful little gems.

Subject:      Don't Let the Neocons Erase our National History
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

Hey folks,

If you live in one of the states mentioned below, please do as the lady says. One of the earliest things that a fascist reigime does is it attempts to rewrite/erase history, which is happening in our own counrtry by way of massive funding cuts for NARA, the National Archives & Records Administration and the NHPRC (National Historical Publications and Records Commission).

(The National Historical Publications and Records Commission (NHPRC) is the outreach arm of the National Archives and makes plans for and studies issues related to the preservation, use and publication of historical documents. The Commission also makes grants to non-Federal archives and other organizations to promote the preservation use of America's documentary heritage.)


("Fascism creates confusion through "facts". It relies on junk science, revisionism, the elimination of cultural records/treasures and obfuscations to create its case and gain acceptance. Fascism can also combine Marxist critiques of capitalism or faith based critics of the same to re-define middle class perceptions of democracy and to force its issues, confuse logic and create majority consensus between targeted groups. This is also referred to as creating a state of Cognitive Dissonance, the mental state most human beings are easily manipulated within.")

Don't let this happen. Get on the phone today. (Also, if you know people in the mentioned states, please send this message on to them.)

Thanks.


"Dear Fellow Archivists:

If you are living or working in Alabama, Arizona, Kansas, Kentucky, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, South Carolina, Texas, or Virginia, please help the effort to restore funding to the NHPRC by making one telephone call.

In my capacity as a member of the Joint (COSHRC, NAGARA, SAA) Task Force on Advocacy, I am leading an effort to get members of the House Subcommittee on Transportation, Treasury, and HUD, the Judiciary, District of Columbia and Independent Agencies (known as the T-THUD Subcommittee) to the hearing on NARA scheduled for 3 p.m. April 26th. Allen Weinstein will testify, but the hearing will not include any other live testimony. We need to encourage subcommittee members to attend this meeting and voice support for the NHPRC (restore its funding at $8 million for grants and $2 million for staff support). For this to have any impact, we need to generate a minimum of 10-15 calls to each representative's office on Monday, April 25th. To make things easy, I have listed of the names and telephone numbers of the representatives below. (Actually, Kentucky and Michigan have two representatives on the subcommittee, so I would ask individuals from those states to make two phone calls.)

Thanks.

Alex -- I think things are a bit more complex than you make them out to
be (unless, of course, your whole argument is simply meant as a swipe
at Bernstein, which I hope it isn't). Adorno's statement is
understandable in the context of the situation; try to think through it
from this angle: what can an aesthetic statement set right when the
major aesthetic statements of German culture have been used as alibis
for the Shoa? I.e. what is going on when on a given evening someone (a
German officer, say) can listen with delight, with great pleasure and
understanding to Bach and Beethoven, and the next morning torture and
slaughter children, women and men with absolute good consciousness?
Adorno, a few years later acknowledged that his statement needed
amending, and he did so in no small reason due to the work of Paul
Celan: you should carefully read not only Celan's DEATH FUGUE, but also
check out the controversies around it, the various critical responses &
Celan's own decisions concerning that poem (The latter may, btw, give
you a better sense of what is at stake in the Bernstein statement you
quote -- a statement that I am sure Celan would not have dismissed the
way you do). Jerome Rothenberg once turned the Adorno statement on its
head and suggested that after Auschwitz only poetry (in the strongest
sense of that word and activity) is possible -- or worth pursuing. I
agree with that statement. -- Pierre

As a footnote to Pierre's remarks, it's worth considering what field of
possibility Adorno meant by poetry. My sense of Bernstein's answer is
precisely to redefine the field.

Would anyone have Russell's e-mail address or physical address? I met him t=
his weekend at Sarah Lawrence and, being very shy I suppose, or busy, or wi=
thout want of distraction, I didn't get a chance to exchange anything with =
him.

When he reads I can't tell if I'm at a reading or a comedy act! He's truly =
amazing.

I'm No Angel=20
by Rob Los Ricos=20

Since my arrest and conviction, I've received a lot of publicity, especia=
lly from abroad. Most people who have read about me don't know anything a=
bout me, really, so I thought it might be a good idea to put a few things=
 right out front before starry-eyed liberal-types start denouncing me for=
 not being perfect, either according to their ideology or their idiotic m=
oral "principles" (that's an oxymoron for you). In the future, projects a=
nd things I write may inspire liberatory thoughts and actions by other pe=
ople, which is as it should be - I've never wanted to exist in a vacuum o=
f self-professed ideals of ideals of liberation. It's always my desire to=
 be part of a dynamic movement of like-minded people struggling to achiev=
e as much autonomy in our lives as we dare to create for ourselves. Hopef=
ully, my years behind bars and the resulting attention my status as a "po=
litical prisoner of war" will help my contact many more such people and I=
'll have a world of opportunities to explore upon my release. Having stat=
ed that, I want to make it absolutely clear that I can not be seen as a r=
ole model, nor should any organization try to adopt me as a poster-dude. =
My past is full of really shitty moments when I've said and done things t=
hat are absolutely repulsive to me now. Looking back, I can understand ho=
w many of those episodes were inspired by self-loathing. That doesn't exc=
use anything I did, even if I was consciously seeking to self-destruct. T=
oo often, innocent people were hurt by my actions, but more often than th=
at, I used other people's own struggle for sell-determination to compleme=
nt mine.=20

Damn, now that I've begun this, I doubt the wisdom of alienating myself f=
rom possible supporters. I hardly wish to be isolated here in prison, nor=
 denounced publicly by people I'll never meet face to face.=20

Well, the original feelings that made me think this is necessary are vali=
d. I don't want to be publicly blind-sided by my past at some point in th=
e future. So, here it comes=85=20

Throughout the reign of Reagan, I had little hope for the future and even=
 less for the present. Scraping by through a series of minimum-wage jobs =
in between bouts of homelessness, I embraced the role of the alien to the=
 extent that I thought of myself as something less than human. Over and o=
ver again, I felt myself drawn into the downward spiral of street life in=
 a major U.S. city - Dallas, Texas. This meant that I spent a lot of time=
 in the company of hustlers, hookers, junkies and alcoholics, doing all t=
he sorts of things people like us do.=20

It took the love of a remarkable woman and a lot of support from some goo=
d friends to push me into overcoming this way of thinking. As a matter of=
 fact, I was so used to thinking and expecting the absolute worst of myse=
lf that the tendency towards self-destruction would continue to manifest =
itself in my life until just recently. When faced with heart-rending deci=
sions and unbearable stress, I'd usually resort to drug use in order to a=
void the situation for a while. Since none of my most recent acquaintance=
s used drugs - as least the heavy drugs (cocaine and heroin) - I usually =
sought out the company of hookers in order to have someone to hang out wi=
th while getting high.=20

I finally came to accept myself, my circumstances and the events and deci=
sions that defined my life as it existed in 1999. Though some things were=
 really fucked up because of my past behavior - my attitudes toward women=
 and my relationship with my daughter, for instance - I found myself surr=
ounded by wonderful people, living closer to the way I think life should =
be than I ever imagined possible and able to overcome my shortcomings to =
create possibilities for my life that made my personal future look absolu=
tely fabulous.=20

Then I got thrown in jail. Hmmm.=20

There, that's as much as I want to divulge about myself in a public forum=
=2E People in my life are already familiar with the details. Anyone who f=
eels that they can't support me now because I've broken some of their ide=
ological taboos - well, they can just kiss my ass. And people who can't s=
upport me because I'm not "morally" pure just need to grow up and face th=
e real world sometime. Who does that leave for me to count on for support=
? My friends and companions who have accepted me with all my flaws becaus=
e they recognize the aspects of myself that enabled me to survive all tho=
se years of pain and turmoil. Plus, people who don't feel a need to judge=
 other people: people who are wrestling with their own "inner demons;" ot=
her people who have seen people they care about fall apart and/or die and=
 can't keep themselves from rooting for others to preserve through and ov=
ercome their urge for self-destruction. In short, people who embrace life=
, despite the pain to celebrate the wondrous joy that goes along with bei=
ng alive, I can count on to continue to write, encourage and support me t=
hrough the next several years. The moralists and ideologues are zombies a=
nyways - half-dead things whose lives have been paralyzed through their f=
ear of being alive. Who need them?=20

And, please, don't hesitate to send me hate mail. I might even respond to=
 it, if I can spare the postage.

Well, Ginsberg meant everything to me around that age or maybe younger, I
don't know when I first encountered, think I was 13 re: Howl in Wilkes-
Barre PA and yes definitely rant, but what I needed, what everyone needed
there in WB was rant - even the _idea_ of complaint, of fury, of anger,
was liberating.

And it's precisely yes Cold War, even Sartre-Resistance, wrung out from -
that his work, this early work, and Sartre for that matter, 's incredibly
necessary _now_ when we're lied to, when there are again bogus enemies,
when the world seems more 'at a standoff' than a coherent communality. We
too easily lulled by effluvia, seepage of capital everywhere, incessent
miracles of skin care, new dynamic discoveries for cleansing the very
earth itself of the last vestiges of dirtiness. We forget the inherency of
evil, and Moloch and Sartre speak to that and will. Being and Nothingness
may not be the arm of the resistance, but it's _an_ arm and that
projectivity is one we might remember when some of us go hysterically
scurrying for god.

Subject:      An Objectivist Question??
Mime-version: 1.0
Content-type: text/plain; charset="ISO-8859-1"
Content-transfer-encoding: quoted-printable

 Can anyone suggest a critical writer who has managed a book - certainly it
would take a book - that compares and contrasts the work of Zukfosky, WCW,
Rez, Oppen, Rakosi, Niedecker  (and obliquely Pound and Bunting)
=20
I find it quite wonderful and touching, for example, that (I believe) on th=
e
death of Williams, Z does  a whole section (=B3A 17") in which he juxtaposes
quotes from his own work with quotes from WCW. The quotes I believe are
telling about the character of their aesthetic relationship, as well as
other elements. And in Patterson, WCW occasionally quotes his peers (and
poetic off-spring).

But I - and the Zuk reading group I am in - are interested in folks who hav=
e
tried to critically embrace the aesthetic similarities and juxtapositions o=
f
approach to the spaces they variously inhabit and share - the way for
example Reznikoff's NYC and sensibility is a different cut than Zukofsky's.
It's not that one rules out the other - in some kind of hierarchy of "who i=
s
better" - but the interest is in the way these various works/writers
compliment each other (tho obviously, some cases, shifting off in totally
unrelated directions.

Is there somebody involved in such an omnibus view?

       Stephen,

       I'm not sure if anyone's done the kind of work you're talking
about--which I would love to read, but I think these two sources are great together:
"The Objectivist Nexus" ed. by DuPlessis, which has separate essays on all
these writers;  the other is the Objectivist's issue of Contemporary Literature,
Vol.10, No. 2 (Spring 1969), edited by L.S Dembo, which has interviews with
the Objectivists.  Between the two, there's a great deal of useful info.

       Hope this helps--looking forward to other responses--

             --Ben.

ONE NATION UNDER BUSH

I'm pretty cynical when it comes to Washington politics. But even I am
shocked by the hypocrisy of the White House and certain senators when
it comes to judicial nominees and the filibuster.

The conservatives claim to oppose "activist judges:" judges who read
what they want into the Constitution instead of faithfully interpreting
the text. But the Republicans are proposing a parliamentary move, the
so-called "nuclear option," that involves an absurd reading of the
Constitution, a reading designed to get what they want without concern
for what the Constitution actually says. Let me explain.

In the normal process, the president nominates a potential judge; if
the Judiciary Committee approves, the nomination is debated on the
Senate floor and is either accepted or rejected on a majority vote.

As with other Senate business, debate is allowed to continue unless a
supermajority of 60 senators votes to end debate. Accordingly, a
determined minority of 41 senators can prevent a vote by prolonging
debate indefinitely, and this is called a filibuster. One might or
might not like this aspect of Senate rules, but those are the rules,
and nobody questions their constitutionality in general.

But when it comes to judicial nominees, the Republican leadership wants
to disallow the filibuster. From superficial news coverage, one might
well think that the Senate is contemplating a simple change in its own
rules, but that is not at all the situation. Changing the rules
requires a supermajority; since the Republicans don't have the votes
for that, they are suggesting a much more devious tactic, a tactic that
shows their lack of respect for the very Constitution they claim to be
defending.

Here's how it would work, according to a story by Brian Naylor and Ron
Elving of National Public Radio. When a judicial nomination is brought
to the floor and a filibuster is under way, Majority Leader Bill Frist
will "seek a ruling of the chair (meaning the Senate's presiding
officer) as to the number of votes needed to end the debate."

Vice President Cheney will presumably be the presiding officer. Since
the Senate rules are clear, one might assume that Cheney will be forced
to inform Frist that 60 votes are needed. But Cheney plans to rule that
only a simple majority is needed, for he will claim that the Senate
rule requiring 60 votes is unconstitutional.

Cheney's ruling can be challenged by senators, but, and here's the
crucial trick, it would only require a simple majority to uphold the
presiding officer's ruling. Hence only 51 senators are needed to go
through with the nuclear option.

But make no mistake: the 51 senators would not be voting simply to
change the Senate rules. They would be voting to affirm the presiding
officer's ruling that the normal Senate rule violates the Constitution.

So, if nobody has questioned the Senate rule before, why would anyone
think that it is unconstitutional? The conservatives suggest that the
filibuster is constitutional for legislation, but not for the approval
of judicial nominees. In support of this view, they cite the "advice
and consent" clause of Article II, which says this: the president
"shall nominate, and by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate,
shall appoint" judges.

Senate conservatives claim that this clause somehow precludes the
Senate rule requiring a supermajority to end debate. This is an
extremely adventurous reading of the Constitution. On the face of
things, the "advice and consent" clause simply limits the president's
power to appoint judges: He can appoint a judge only if the Senate
consents. Article II says nothing about the rules for senatorial debate
on the matter.

By claiming that the filibuster rule is unconstitutional, Senate
conservatives will be engaging in exactly what they say they are trying
to prevent: activist readings of the Constitution to get a desired
result by being unfaithful to the text. Even the most jaded observer
must be stunned by such brazen and open hypocrisy.

_______________________________________________
Sens. Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins are still publicly undecided
about the nuclear option. You can call them at 202-224-5344 and
202-224-2523 respectively.

Dear Buffalo List:

These few Republican senators are still on the fence. Take a moment if
you've been following the filibuster story and go to the contact pages
of each site below to find an e-mail or phone. The slippery slope that
both Repub and Democratic senators are talking about starts with the
nuclear option, which may be enacted in the next five to seven days.

The Washington Post reports that 60% of those polled believe the
nuclear option may lead to even more dangerous abuses of power by
NeoCons down the road.

These senators are especially sensitive to public opinion just now.

This is the time to call or write before Social Security, the 8-hour
workday, paid overtime, family leave, minimum wage, and other
initiatives are deemed unconstitutional and discarded.

Subject: An Objectivist Question??


Can anyone suggest a critical writer who has managed a book - certainly it
would take a book - that compares and contrasts the work of Zukfosky, WCW,
Rez, Oppen, Rakosi, Niedecker  (and obliquely Pound and Bunting)

I find it quite wonderful and touching, for example, that (I believe) on the
death of Williams, Z does  a whole section (³A 17") in which he juxtaposes
quotes from his own work with quotes from WCW. The quotes I believe are
telling about the character of their aesthetic relationship, as well as
other elements. And in Patterson, WCW occasionally quotes his peers (and
poetic off-spring).

But I - and the Zuk reading group I am in - are interested in folks who have
tried to critically embrace the aesthetic similarities and juxtapositions of
approach to the spaces they variously inhabit and share - the way for
example Reznikoff's NYC and sensibility is a different cut than Zukofsky's.
It's not that one rules out the other - in some kind of hierarchy of "who is
better" - but the interest is in the way these various works/writers
compliment each other (tho obviously, some cases, shifting off in totally
unrelated directions.

Is there somebody involved in such an omnibus view?

saw a great reading by jack hirschman tonight at bpc in ny

he is one of the very few  like lorca and a handful of others that
transcends the poem
adds  lyricism to almost every line  beit about a suicide bomber or the
love of his lfe
one of the few who can mix languages  and makes it sound easy   like it
belongs
one of the few who can read a poem about a famous dead friend like corso
and make us feel corso  breth life  nastiness  streetness and brilliance
all in one SHOT
and one who writes  pure poetry  and who can combine  poetry and politics
 and still make the poem sing   a wonder  and always uplifting

Regarding Stephen Vincent's inquiry: for my money, the best comprehensive c=
onsideration of the Objectivists by a single author is Michael Heller's Con=
viction's Net of Branches, still available through Spuyten Duyvil.  Some ye=
ars ago, the National Poetry Foundation was planning an Objectivist antholo=
gy, with selections by contemporary poet/critics of the original group (Zuk=
, Oppen, Rezi, Rakosi, Niedecker, possibly Bunting), and a comprehensive in=
tro, to be edited by yours truly.  It never materialized, largely due to co=
pyright issues.  Then The Objectivist Nexus appeared, providing a generous =
helping of critical essays.  But an anthology of the sort we once planned w=
ould still be a wonderful thing to have.

Check out books by Mark Scroggins... and his various papers. He's constantly
revealing the constellations of all the mentioned.

Best,
Gerald S.

Can anyone suggest a critical writer who has managed a book - certainly it
would take a book - that compares and contrasts the work of Zukfosky, WCW,
Rez, Oppen, Rakosi, Niedecker  (and obliquely Pound and Bunting)

I find it quite wonderful and touching, for example, that (I believe) on the
death of Williams, Z does  a whole section (³A 17") in which he juxtaposes
quotes from his own work with quotes from WCW. The quotes I believe are
telling about the character of their aesthetic relationship, as well as
other elements. And in Patterson, WCW occasionally quotes his peers (and
poetic off-spring).

But I - and the Zuk reading group I am in - are interested in folks who have
tried to critically embrace the aesthetic similarities and juxtapositions of
approach to the spaces they variously inhabit and share - the way for
example Reznikoff's NYC and sensibility is a different cut than Zukofsky's.
It's not that one rules out the other - in some kind of hierarchy of "who is
better" - but the interest is in the way these various works/writers
compliment each other (tho obviously, some cases, shifting off in totally
unrelated directions.

Is there somebody involved in such an omnibus view?

Subject:      SubText/Seattle - BAUS & BRADSHAW
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; format=flowed

Subtext continues its monthly series of experimental writing with readings
by
Eric BAUS and Joseph BRADSHAW at Richard Hugo House on Wednesday, May 4,
2005.
Donations for admission will be taken at the door on the evening of the
performance.  The reading starts at 7:30pm.

Eric BAUS' book, _The To Sound_, was selected by Forrest Gander for the 2002
Verse Press Prize and was awarded a grant from the Greenwall Fund of the
Academy
of American Poets. He is also the author of three chapbooks: _The Space
Between
Magnets_, _A Swarm In The Aperture_, and _Something Else The Music Was_. His
poems have appeared in Verse, Colorado Review, Hambone, Web Conjunctions,
and
other journals. He currently lives in western Massachusetts.

Peter Gizzi writes: Eric Baus has channeled the consciousness of migratory
animals, of a collective self, of others, of objects. He has written an open
letter from a marvelous land just beside this one, a place of interior
wonder
and intimate noise. It's The To Sound of course: bent, exuberant notes that
will
wake you up wherever you are.

Joseph BRADSHAW cofounded and helps FO A RM Magazine, and is a member of the
Spare Room poetry collective in Portland.  Recent work has appeared at
flim.com,
in many mailboxes, and is forthcoming in more mailboxes and in the form of a
chapbook, _Wolf Assay_.

Adorno also wrote:

"I once said that after Auschwitz one could no longer write
poetry, and that gave rise to a discussion I did not
anticipate . . . [I]t is in the nature of philosophy--and
everything I write is, unavoidably, philosophy, even if it is
not concerned with so-called philosophical themes--that
nothing is meant quite literally. Philosophy always relates to
tendencies and does not consist of statements of fact. . . .
it could equally well be said . . . that [after Auschwitz] one
must write poems, in keeping with Hegel's statement in his
Aesthetics that as long as there is an awareness of suffering
among human beings there must also be art as the objective
form of that awareness. . . . [The question whether one can
write poetry after Auschwitz should rather be] the question
whether one can live after Auschwitz. . . . [I]n one of the
most important plays of Sartre . . . a young resistance
fighter who is subjected to torture . . . [asks] whether or
why one should live in a world in which one is beaten until
one's bones are smashed. Since it concerns the possibility of
any affirmation of life, this question cannot be evaded. And I
would think that any thought which is not measured by this
standard, which does not assimilate it theoretically, simply
pushes aside at the outset that which thought should
address--so that it really cannot be called a thought at all."
(Metaphysics 110-1; cf. Negative Dialectics 362)

Adorno's original quote regarding poetry after Auschwitz comes
from an essay critiquing cultural criticism which had become,
for Adorno, so reified that "even the most extreme
consciousness of doom threatens to degenerate into idle
chatter" (Adorno, Prisms). There is no question that there
exist poets, especially lyric, first-person-singular-minded
poets, that are fetishistic about their own self-expression -
this is the poet that Adorno is speaking to.  And to say that
poetry has the special privilege over and above other forms of
expression to illustrate horror and tragedy is banal if not
dangerous in that such a statement prioritizes expression,
especially self expression, as an act as such.  If the world
has changed, Adorno is reminding us, so too must poetry - it
may speak of the tradegies of a place like Auschwitz, but it
must do so
by not merely "hold[ing] up a mirror to society's own crudity
and severity" (Adorno, Prisms).  Poetry must not participate,
paradoxically, in the very society of brutality that it
professes to condemn.

Subject:      Mushairras, Ghazals and Faith (or the lack thereof)
In-Reply-To:  6667
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

Mushairras are a traditional gathering of poets that originated in Persia. Originally, they were not just a celebration of poetry- not just mass readings but rather a chance for people to share in the Islamic faith of their fellow poets. It is important to note here that ghazals which are a very inviting and interactive form of poetics were the featured poems. If you have ever listened to a ghazal, you will understand that the form itself compels you to be involved in its content.
The "baah baah or vaaah vaah" that Professor Newman wrote he recieved were actually "Vahs" or Pidgeon English for "Wow". That intense respect and even love for the poem- and thus the poet- infuses the gathering with an energy that is rarely seen in standard poetry readings. Today Mushairras are still an important part of the cultural life of South Asians- especially in Pakistan and India where audiences sometimes reach the tens of thousands.
The reverance for the word that is felt by people who participate and attend a mushairra (it is true that unlike a poetry reading in America, audience participation is key) stems from the fact that the people's deep faith is tied into the word, which may not be the case in America.

Paul Catafago

Richard Jeffrey Newman <richard.j.newman@VERIZON.NET> wrote:
I have just come back from being a part of my first mushairra, which is the
word in Urdu (at least I am assumingn it's Urdu) for a traditional gathering
of poets in Pakistan, and it is a very, very different experience from the
kinds of readings we have here in the US. The most significant difference is
not only the degree to which the audience responds to a poet as he or she
reads—calling out baah-baah, or vaah-vaah, after verses or images or rhymes
that have moved them—but also the way in which the poet responds, repeating
the verse that the audience has singled out sometimes two and three times.
With the exception of my poems and the poem read by the guy who invited me
to this event—Paul Catafago, executive director of Movement One—I understood
only a very few words of the other poems that were (Urdu is closely related
to Persian, which I understand and speak a little of), but I would be lying
if I said I appreciated any of it as poetry. What I appreciated was the
openness and sincerity and clear desire to support the people who got up to
read; there was in that room a genuine love for poetry, for language and the
way language can move you, the way language can change the way you see
things—and this was particularly evident in the way the audience would
themselves repeat along with the poet a verse that he or she had already
repeated two or three times—and it's not that audiences in the US don't feel
this, but we certainly don't express it during a reading. We may go up and
say something to the poet afterwards or we might clap at the end of a
particularly moving poem, but we do not, we are trained not to, there is
something in the culture here that prevents us from participating in the
poem as it is read, from giving voice to whatever it is that the poem makes
us feel. It's almost as if we are ashamed of it, which reminds of something
Sam Hamill said in one of his essays about how embarrassed we get as an
audience when the poem a poet is reading moves him or her to tears,
especially if it's a him.

And it is fitting that, as often as not, the responses of the people in the
mushairra were non-verbal, or they were quick, ejaculatory comments, like
the baah-baah I wrote about above. I remember taking a course with Hayden
Carruth when I was studying at Syracuse University and it was about
precisely that, the non-verbal aspects of poetry and how it is those aspects
that often give voice in the poem to the emotional energy that breaks the
bounds of words. Carruth's course was about rhythm and meter and rhyme, but
also about why it is that poets will often spell out the sounds "Ah!" or
"O!" in a line, and we talked a lot about how those things function
similarly to grace notes in music or the way horn players will sometimes
allow their high notes to crack a little bit. In fact, the participation of
the audience at this mushairra reminds me, now that I am writing this, not a
little of the way audiences at concerts will sometimes start spontaneously
to clap their hands to the music.

I read four pieces, two from my translation of the Gulistan and two ghazals
in English, which this audience especially appreciated—most of the poems
that people read, I think were ghazals in Urdu—and I don't think I have ever
felt more warmly received or more genuinely appreciated as a writer than
when I heard this audience express their appreciation and enjoyment right in
the middle of my reading.

This would be more minimalist if we could reduce the words to letters. I
used single words, but the challenge is to use single letters instead  of single
words and still convey meaning either from the form or from  the text, or more
remarkably even both. Mary Jo

Home Girls, Make Some Noise!: Hip Hop Feminism Anthology

Feminism, rap music, and Hip Hop culture, at first glance, do not appear
to be likely cohorts. In the male-driven, testosterone filled world of
Hip Hop culture and rap music labeling oneself a feminist is not a
political stance easily taken. Thus, many women involved with Hip Hop
culture do not take on the label of feminist even as their actions imply
feminist beliefs and leanings. Much of the strong criticisms of rap
music have been about the music's sexism and misogyny. And much of the
attention focused on sex and gender have been in terms of constructions
of Black masculinity, and rap music as a vehicle for Black male
posturing. A lot of attention has been paid to the impact rap music and
the masculine space of Hip Hop culture has on the development of Black
male identities.
In this volume, the editors strive to understand constructions of Hip
Hop feminism, gender, and sexuality in Hip Hop culture, rap music and
these in transnational contexts.

We take the stance that Hip Hop is a cultural phenomenon that expands
farther than rap music. Hip Hop has been defined by many as a way of
life that encompasses everything from way of dress to manner of speech.
Hip Hop as a culture originally included graffiti writing, d-jaying,
break dancing, and rap music. It has recently expanded to include genres
such as film, spoken word, autobiographies, literature, journalism, and
activism. It has also expanded enough to include its own brand of
feminism. The work of Hip Hop feminist writers such as Ayana Byrd,
Denise Cooper, Eisa Davis, Eisa Nefertari Ulen, shani jamilla, dream
hampton, Joan Morgan, Tara Roberts, Kristal Brent-Zook, and Angela Ards
is expanding black feminist theory and black women 's intellectual
traditions in fascinating ways. What started out as a few young black
feminist women who loved Hip Hop and who tried to mesh that love with
their feminist/womanist consciousness is now a rich body of articles,
essays, poetry, and creative non-fiction.

We seek to complicate understandings of Hip Hop as a male space by
including and identifying the women who were always involved with the
culture and offering Hip Hop feminist critiques of the music and the
culture.  We seek to explore Hip Hop as a worldview, as an epistemology
grounded in the experiences of communities of color under advanced
capitalism, as a cultural site for rearticulating identity and sexual
politics. We are particularly interested in seeing submissions of
critical essays and cultural critiques, interviews, creative non-fiction
and personal narratives, fiction, poetry, and artwork. We also encourage
submissions from women working within the Hip Hop sphere, Hip Hop
feminists and activists "on the ground," as well as scholars, writers,
and journalists. We do not wish to reify the scholar/activist dichotomy,
but we want to encourage as broad a discussion of the possibilities of
Hip Hop Feminism as possible and we want to be sure multiple voices and
perspectives are represented in the anthology. All work submitted must
be original and should not have been published elsewhere.

Word Count/Page Limits:

Critical Essays and Cultural Critiques - 25 pages (including
bibliography) 6500 words Interviews - 10 pages/2500 words Creative
Non-Fiction and Personal Narratives - 20 pages/5000 words Fiction - 20
pages/5000 words Poetry/Rhymes - No more than 3 pages per poem/rhyme and

Editors:

Gwendolyn Pough is an Associate Professor of Women's Studies, Writing,
and Rhetoric at Syracuse University and the author of Check It While I
Wreck It; Black Womanhood, Hip-Hop Culture and the Public Sphere,
Northeastern University Press 2004.

Elaine Richardson is an Associate Professor of English at Penn State
University and the author of African American Literacies (2003) and the
forthcoming Hip Hop Literacies both from Routledge Press.

Rachel Raimist is a Hip Hop feminist filmmaker, scholar and activist.
Her film credits include the award-winning feature length documentaries
Freestyle, Nobody Knows My Name, and Garbage, Gangsters, and Greed. She
is a doctoral student in Feminist Studies at the University of
Minnesota- Twin Cities.

Aisha S. Durham is an essayist and Editorial Assistant for several
cultural studies journals, including Qualitative Inquiry where her
performance work is featured. Durham's dissertation research examining
Hip Hop feminism will be featured in an upcoming anthology and
documentary about Hip Hop culture. She is a doctoral candidate in the
Institute of Communications Research at the University of Illinois at
Urbana-Champaign.

Additional themes to be explored:

n Has Hip Hop feminism moved beyond the conflicted stance of loving Hip
Hop, being a feminist, and meshing the two? What is next? What should
Hip Hop feminism be doing?
n Now that we have at least two generations of women who identify as Hip
Hop feminist, can we talk about multiple Hip Hop feminism(s), multiple
Hip Hop feminist agendas?
n On that generational note, how then does the Hip Hop feminist agenda
mesh with the Black feminist agenda or womanist agenda of our
predecessors and contemporaries who do not claim a Hip Hop sensibility?
n We know that there are dedicated educators out there who are working
in the trenches with no institutional support to bring feminist
education and issues of sexuality, sexual health, and emotional
well-being to our youth, but how can Hip Hop feminists work to ensure
that feminist education is centered in the curricula of America's
schools, elementary through college for both male and female students?
n What are the defining contours of Hip Hop Feminism? If we are of the
understanding that a Hip Hop feminist is more than just a woman who
loves Hip Hop and feels conflicted about it, what does a Hip Hop
feminism look like?
n The continued sexual labor of women of color in a global market place
now depending on virtual "mass mediated" sex labor (e.g. music video and
pornography) as well as other forms of sex and gendered labor performed
by women of color still policed.
n Is Hip Hop feminism simply a US phenomenon? Should Hip Hop feminism
have a global agenda?
And how should Hip Hop feminism participate in the agendas of
transnational feminism(s)?
n What roles can Hip Hop feminism play in combating growing rate of
incarcerated woman of color and the expanding prison industrial complex?

Paul, you wrote:

>>The "baah baah or vaaah vaah" that Professor Newman wrote he recieved were
actually "Vahs" or Pidgeon English for "Wow".<<

Is "vah" really that recent? I connected it with the Persian "baah baah!"
which is an exclamation used, among other things, to connote that something
is delicious; it used for food as well as other things, and I just assumed
that what I heard at the mushairra was an extension of that expression.

are you serious? i hope not

i thake it your are refering to the excepts from
the poetic prose novel more at 7:30: notes from new palestine?
the peices entitled, "the reversal of thesis: the world is a prison, naw " &
"Dreams Fall (from more at 7:30: notes from new palestine)"?

if so...

all i read are the people, the same people, posting their poems to this
list ad nasium.
today i read more 'creative" peices by the same usual posters.
i and others have had to deal with the racist, elitist and antimuslim
dialogue (like the "99 wrong names of Allah"
and how it's ok to call japanese people "japs" yet we have to deal with
week long parnoid rant on "antisemiticism"?)
on an almost dailly basis, mind you.

since i've been on this list i have had to read daily postings of
"creative" peices
not to mention pretty nasty writings and personal gossip
which would be considered racists and elitist.
even today you posted "creative" peices by the usual posters.
what are are suggesting is not policy but prejudice.

I do not post that much this list. and most of my post are on
readings and anthologies which privilege, as does my writng, black,
working class,
natives and latino (a)s not to mention the more innovative aspects of
the current state
what was once refered to as poetry -- now forward on the march from the
traditon of
diasporic narrative, rhythms and testimonies from ragtime to blues to
jazz to soul
to rhythm & blues to reggae, rap and hip hop -- the words and sounds and
struggles of class
and my peoples -- and i do beleive that here is where the issues lies.

i do notice that your "discussions" and styles are all centred around
eurocentricisms and any
straying from this center would leave the powers out of the center and
therefore leave open
and dangerous space for the "other" voices to come forward and change
the game. ...and it is the
game that you wish not to change.

my experience as a writer and a black writer, one from a working class
background, has been that
the writing community and those who run it are extremely racist and
elists and if they can use that power
--that economic power, that power held in physical makeup concealed in
european language and the visuals
of the open mics, acedemia and literary conferences -- to maintain their
voice and point of view by silencing,
diluting, appropiating,  controlling and often destroying those voices
which pose a threat to them -- they shall.


...and so you are attempting to do with myself.
...and so writing suffers and the world grows dimmer.

these voices are not heard often on the list they lost in the backrooms
and kitchens, not permitted to eat at the same
tables or read from the same the pillars because the writng community
chooses to ghettoize them, and often mocks
them as would any totalitarian society in fear of difference and
approached by a theat to it's center of power.
This writing corperation -- who slouche at major literary conferences,
lists, publishing houses,
journals and university lectures; maintained and attended by and for the
white and middle class, if not middle aged,
party circuit crowd, has remained out of touch with the voices and
styles out there on the move.

now you, whispering in shadows for this buffalo poetic listserv, are
hinding behind
a hardly used policy, to silence a voice, as the writing community has
done to nonwhite & middle class writers since
the days of langton hughes, richard wright, amiri baraka to the under
exposed writers of today
who are the a darker bruhs and sis who eat and read in the backrooms and
kitchens.

the reason for the return of poetry and spoken word today is because of
the so called hip hop/rap artistry and culture which
invoked the spirits of the blues rhythms and wails to the jazz dystopia
of sonics and reconstrcution of a enslavers language and tones
to the rebel music of reggae and punk which all rounded to to the show
and prove of funk, soul and rock n roll -- and you and yours
can't do that so you and yours choose to stop and shut it the hell up --
at the sametime control and cash in.

the issues has not been to innovate or discuss writing/poetry but to
maintain a stronghold and hegemic voice and style while using money,
race, language and the publishing
monoply to hold other more threatening voices back.

I believe that your are singling me out and pulling out an old
policy inorder to silence a voice and voices (class and races) which has(ve)
a style that challenges the the static quo of the usual set group of
posters
which holds people and poetry in enertia.

it's the style and the subject matter that is bothering you not the
the creative piece nor is it the breaking of policy.

please spare me the hypocracy.

please don't start making this racial issue, faith and elitist issue
based on preference.

or as gangstarr once hollad;

"you know my steez"

Not sure this is getting through - but Ishaq's work is certainly breaking
new ground in poetics and is as dis/arming dis/comfiting as anything
around - I think his posts should definitely go through.

- Meanwhile Ishaq please forward if you can if this doesn't appear (quota)

Towns facing daunting seal carcass cleanup
WebPosted Apr 26 2005 08:11 AM NDT
CBC News

PORT AU CHOIX    Residents living in a string of Northern Peninsula
communities are faced with the task of cleaning up thousands of dead
seals.


Seal carcasses washed ashore by the hundreds this week on coastline in and
near Port au Choix.

Seal carcasses washed ashore by the hundreds this week on coastline in and
near Port au Choix.
The animals  most of them whitecoats  began washing ashore last week, and
their remains cover kilometres of coastline.

Federal fisheries officials suspect an "ice kill"  involving a crush of
ice thrown about during a violent storm at Easter  is the cause of the
incident.

More than 2,000 dead seals are estimated to have been killed.

Port au Choix Mayor Stella Mailman says the cleanup has to begin soon.

"With our tourist season upon us now, we certainly don't want to add to
the smell on our beaches," she says.

"We want to clean our beaches up and have them as good and nice for our
tourists to walk [on] as possible, and we certainly don't want dead seals
lying around."

Port au Choix is home to a national historic site, because of the rich
archaeological finds discovered over the years involving Maritime Archaic
Indians and other early settlers.

  # EXTERNAL SITE: Port au Choix National Historic Site

The town is also near the L'Anse aux Meadows National Historic Site, one
of the most popular attractions in the province.

Chilly winds Monday kept temperatures cold, but Mailman says a cleanup
needs to start before the weather turns warm.

The Port au Choix council is meeting Tuesday night to discuss the issue.

Mailman estimates it will take about two weeks to clear all the dead seals
from the beaches in her town limits alone.

Meanwhile, Port Saunders town council is expected to meet with provincial
officials later this week to figure out what to do about dead seals lying
on its beaches.

For an Objectivist anthology, see Andrew McAllister, ed: THE OBJECTIVISTS
(Bloodaxe Books, 1996) --Zukofsky, Oppen, Reznikoff, Rakosi, Rukeyser,
Rexroth, Niedecker -- no Bunting. Pretty basic general critical
introduction. May not be available in the US (unless SPD has it), so you'd
have to get it from the publisher , PO Box 1SN, Newcastle upon Tyne NE99
1SN, England. Don't know the price, but you could probably find out on line.
Scrappily useful but, well, a lot better than nothing.

Subject: Objectivist question

Regarding Stephen Vincent's inquiry: for my money, the best comprehensive
consideration of the Objectivists by a single author is Michael Heller's
Conviction's Net of Branches, still available through Spuyten Duyvil.  Some
years ago, the National Poetry Foundation was planning an Objectivist
anthology, with selections by contemporary poet/critics of the original
group (Zuk, Oppen, Rezi, Rakosi, Niedecker, possibly Bunting), and a
comprehensive intro, to be edited by yours truly.  It never materialized,
largely due to copyright issues.  Then The Objectivist Nexus appeared,
providing a generous helping of critical essays.  But an anthology of the
sort we once planned would still be a wonderful thing to have.

masses are beginning to wake up from the George W. Bush Kool-Aid=20
induced stupor that has resulted in

(1) a tanking economy;
(2) foreign lands (truly) hating America
(3) a war that cannnot be won
(4) starting another war that cannot be won
(5) the corruption of Tom DeLay and Bill Frist in their personal quest=20=

for political power
(6) a trip to Debtor's Prison, cause you can't file bankruptcy anymore,=20=

even after Harvard proved that many of you don't want to file but have=20=

no other choice after devastating medical or economical catastrophes
(7) telling people if they don't support elected officials who want to=20=

retain what vestiges of democracy that remain, that they aren't=20
Christian.

Could it be that after 5 years of drinking and being drunk on=20
GeeDubya's brew, the nasty aftertaste that Americans are tasting in=20
their mouths is not what they expected? That their lives are no better=20=

than they were four years ago?

It's hard to face sobering reality, isn't it? The reality that you were=20=

given smoke and mirrors, instead of shock and awe. The reality that you=20=

were told that voting to re-elect Bush would make you and the country=20
safer, when the truth is, we're in even worse shape than before=20
September 11th. The reality that your fear was used against you to=20
facilitate the furtherance of a perceived superpower and march towards=20=

global domination.

Bet you didn't know that a vote for Bush meant you were signing off on=20=

that implementation of the Project for A New American Century, did you?=20=

Naw, you wanted to be considered a "good Christian" and a "good=20
Patriot", so you supported the most egregious examples of demagoguery=20
and unpatriotic acts that have ever been witnessed by man since Thomas=20=

Jefferson suggested that maybe, just maybe, it was a good idea to keep=20=

church and state separate in an effort to prevent a religious hijacking=20=

of our government.

If Jefferson knew 200+ years ago that absolute power corrupts=20
absolutely, why have we failed to grasp those lessons in the 21st=20
Century?

I don't really know, except to say it couldn't have been done without=20
help from spineless jellyfish, known as democrats, and more=20
specifically, DLC members. Let's look at one major example: The=20
Bankruptcy Reform Bill that just passed. A study done at Harvard=20
University that reviewed the rates of bankruptcy filings and the=20
reasons for their filings indicated that a large number of bankruptcies=20=

filed in the past year were due to hardships like illness, job loss,=20
death in the family...catastrophes no one could have foreseen or=20
expected.

The New World Order, I guess, hinges on the destruction of the middle=20
class.

ALBERT FLYNN DESILVER'S "unpublished" books of poetry include Some Nature
and Letters to Early Street. Widely published in literary magazines like Ne=
w
American Writing, Volt, and ZYZZYVA, he is a fluid, sunny, innovative poet.
Editor/ Publisher of The Owl Press, he's also a conceptual and visual artis=
t
whose work has been shown in Los Angeles, Santa Barbara, and San Francisco.

CHRIS STROFFOLINO'S new book of poems is Speculative Primitive; Jeffrey
McDaniel says, "Chris Stroffolino is a mad scientist of a poet, concocting
linguistic serums which he squirts into the reader's cerebral cortex.
Speculative Primitive is a dense world, with lots of turbulence, a slam
dance for the brain, a swerving, careening, spontaneous-feeling poetry,
devoid of tidy endings and tidy beginnings.=8A" His most recent collection is
Stealer's Wheel; Stroffolino also plays keyboard in the band Continuous
Peasant whose album Exile in Babyville was released in 2003. Donation: $2.

Hi Nick,

I was just wondering if you reposted this excerpt from my post with comments
that somehow didn't make it to my machine/the list or if you just posted it
as is. Like I said, just wondering.

I had a brainstorm this morning upon waking, since this is obviously a
condundrum for me.

Did you know there are about 6666 special poetry sites on Yahoo? I can't
vouch for the quality, ambience or form/format limitations of such; but they're
fairly simple to host and maintain. Since I'm disabled and spend much time
sitting for rest & comfort, I check my computer off and on all day. I'll  read
your poetry.

I'm willing to host what I feel would be a very quality group so all of you
can post free standing poetry and friendly discussion. I can make it public
(better exposure) or private.

I'll let you know when it's up and running, should be today or tomorrow
sometime. If you'd be interested, please backchannel. Also, any experience  you've
had with Yahoo would help.

I will continue to exercise my mysterious and new found privilege here at
Poetics. Even my ex-husband was banned, and he's very good !

No, I don't imagine he did, though it's important to point out that, in the
States at least, it is Coleman Barks who is the best-seller, not Rumi
himself, and this is important not just because Barks has made a name for
himself as Rumi's "translator," but because Barks' Rumi has a lot more to do
with Barks than it does with Rumi. A friend who is fluent in Persian and who
has also translated Rumi points out, and has pointed out to Barks, that you
cannot recognize in Barks' "translations" a single poem of Rumi's from the
original. And so the question of how and why Barks' books have sold so well
is less a question about Rumi than it is about us, meaning those of us in
the US, and the market here, and the cultural assumptions that those who
bring such books to market are able, consciously or not, to capitalize on.
Barks would probably say, based on what I have read of him, that Rumi
transcends markets and cultural assumptions, which I would say is a very
convenient way of not having to confront Rumi's historical and cultural
specificity. Not to mention that it is also a way of undermining the
authority of anyone who can actually read Rumi in the original, much less
translate him more or less accurately into English. And I would add also
that it falsifies on a very important level the image we have in the West of
classical Persian literature, not to mention the Persians who wrote it and,
by extension, the Iranians of today.

The closest thing I can think of is the Bruce Comens book which deals
with Pound, Williams, and Zukofsky, Univ of Alabama Press. It has an
amazing interpretation of parts of Zuk's A. Mark was on this list, he
would know others. Neidecker has not been written about in a mixed book

The "welcome" message here seems to be changing every
few months or weeks. It seems to have gone through
more drafts than the Patriot Act.

In its latest iteration there's this:

"We do not accept unsolicited postings of creative
work not directed toward a discussion of poetics
issues on the list."

This evidently supercedes the previous version:

"The Poetics List is not a forum for a general
discussion of poetry or for the exchange of
unsolicited poems."

Isn't it a little hard to square this...

"Our aim is to support, inform, and extend those
directions in poetry that are committed to
innovations, renovations, and investigations of form
and/or/as content, to the questioning of received
forms and
styles, and to the creation of the otherwise
unimagined, untried, unexpected, improbable, and
impossible."

...with the ban on unsolicited poems? Is the list
committed or not, to "the creation of the otherwise
unimagined, etc"?

however, the list epigram hasn't changed--"New
obstacles for exchange arise"--yes, they sure do.

The same goes with Daniel Ladinsky's Hafis. Not a single poem corresponds to
any single poem by Hafiz. As I said in a review of the book, "nada."

On one hand, if one takes the time to read Bark's translations (or worse
yet, listen to him 'deliver the sugar' on a PBS outlet), it's not too
difficult to notice that we are readily in a Rod McKuen land of Persian gift
shop schmaltz.  There will always be a market for this stuff - in the same
way there is always a market for African masks sold on tarmacs of any
African airport (let alone "exotic" gift shops around the world.) I suspect
within modern day countries of Persian descent, there is also a schmaltz
market of Persian goods for the locals
I know to say this sounds condescending as whatever. But nothing ever will
destroy this kind of market - in fact there are artists who love to satirize
it as a kind of niche market in itself. Comedy is actually, I think, a good
response. (I also must confess, say, in a flea market I get fooled into
liking, even buy stuff that I don't know anything about - which I later
learn 'to my embarrassment' is fake.)
I guess this is all about the argument as to "what is or was Real", how to
articulate, translate and preserve it. Since the ground and time (History)
is always moving under our feet, I suspect anyone's claims to know and
translate "the real" will always be suspect; ultimately we are best left, in
this Hafiz case, looking for translations by those who can make the language
both correspond to the original and ring true in our own moment. It's never
going to entirely mimic its moment of origin. I think that would be - on
empirical evidence - a contradiction of terms.

Hi mIEKAL and Mary Jo,

If you write me, I can write Ryan Whyte, who will sub you or anyone else.
It's open, just a bit difficult. He's running it out of the University of
Toronto. It's a transformation from the old fiction-of-philosophy list
which I started in '94 and has some really stunning writers on it.

on "images and politics"
=20
David Levi Strauss is a writer and critic in New York, where his essays =
and
reviews appear regularly in Artforum, Aperture, and The Nation. He =
edited
the literary journal Acts and published a book of poetry, Manoeuvres, in =
San
Francisco before moving to New York in 1993. His essays have appeared in
numerous collections, including Broken Wings: The Legacy of Landmines in
Cambodia and Mozambique, with photographer Bobby Neel Adams.  His book =
of
essays on art and politics, Between Dog & Wolf, was published in 1999 by
Autonomedia/Semiotext(e).  His most recent book is Between The Eyes: =
Essays
on Photography, from Aperture Press in 2003.

"David Levi Strauss, who is a poet and storyteller as well as being a
renowned commentator on photography . . . looks at images very hard . . =
.
and comes face-to-face with the unexplained. Again and again. The
unexplained that he encounters has only little to do with the mystery of
art, and everything to do with the mystery of countless lives . . . by =
the
light of his intelligence and compassion, David Levi Strauss talks about
what is being systematically erased, and what we need to remember for
tomorrow."  --John Berger

Jason Zuzga's poetry has been or will be published in journals such as
FENCE, jubilat, VOLT, LIT, The Yale Review, Gulf Coast, Spork, and =
Fulcrum.
He was New Media Coordinator at Alfred A. Knopf until leaving the east =
coast
to attend the University of Arizona, where he will receive an MFA in =
both
poetry and nonfiction this May. He was a Winter Poetry Fellow at the =
Fine
Arts Work Center in Provincetown in 2001-2002. He will be the James =
Merrill
Writer-in-Residence in Stongington, Connecticut from September 2005 to
August 2006, after which he will enter the English PhD program at the
University of Pennsylvania to study natural history writing.

_______________________

A CONSERVATIVE COUP UNDERWAY AT PBS

The new head of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (the gatekeeper
between lawmakers and public broadcasters), Ken Ferree, is a staunch
Republican proponent of media deregulation and a former top adviser to
FCC Chairman Michael Powell. Three top CPB officials, all with
Democratic affiliations, departed or were dismissed in recent months.
For the first time in its 38-year history, the CPB ordered a
comprehensive review of public TV and radio programming for "evidence
of bias." All new PBS funding agreements are conditioned upon the
network following "objectivity and balance" requirements for each of
its programs.

Last January, Education Secretary Margaret Spellings denounced the
cartoon rabbit Buster, of "Postcards from Buster" fame, for visiting a
lesbian family in Vermont. The decision to slash in half the popular
investigative show NOW after Bill Moyers' departure, and the addition
of the Wall Street Journal editorial page and Tucker Carlson (who has
since left for MSNBC) to the programming line-up proves just how far
right PBS has moved in an attempt to appear fair and balanced. "This is
the first time in my thirty-two years in public broadcasting that CPB
has ordered up programs for ideological instead of journalistic
reasons," Moyers told The New Yorker last year.

A majority of the CPB's eight-member board--chaired by Ken Tomlinson, a
good friend of KARL ROVE--are now Republican appointees. Two of the
newest, Gay Hart Gaines and Cheryl Halpern, have donated more than
$800,000 to the Republican Party since 1995. Gaines once ran a
political action committee for Newt Gingrich, who as speaker of the
House pushed to "zero out" all of PBS's federal funding. In 2003, PBS
President Pat Mitchell offered Gingrich a town-hall style show. It
would've happened if Gingrich wasn't already under contract with Fox
News.

Ironically, the CPB was created to shield PBS from political pressure,
just as PBS was intended to address the "needs of unserved and
underserved audiences." One can hardly argue that the WSJ edit page or
Tucker Carlson fit into that category. "To find the same combination of
conviction, partisanship and ideological extremism on the far left,"
wrote my colleague Eric Alterman, "A network would need to convene a
'roundtable' featuring Noam Chomsky, Alexander Cockburn, Vanessa
Redgrave and Fidel Castro."

These days, PBS is more likely to give James Dobson his own special on
religion.

Steve,
Was this an 'invited' poem? =20

Or are you guilty of posting a poem in violation of the prime directive? =


If it was an invited work, I think you should share with the list =
readers the invitation you received asking you to post the work. =20

On the other hand, if the work was not requested, and still, you posted: =


Shame on you!
Alex=20
P.S. Well writ...(oh, and thanks to Mary Jo for having conceived the =
horror of this idea...she deserves pain).=20

Kenning Editions is proud to announce the publication of David Larsen's SYRUP HITS, now available from Small Press Distribution.

Intended as the "remix" of David Larsen's poetry collection THE THORN, the chapbook SYRUP HITS offers a meditative funhouse ride through phantom landscapes of the modern Middle East and southern United States. Its collaged pages are loosely gathered around the misadventures of a codeine abuser named Puzz, who is stationed at Abu Ghrayb during the first months of the U.S. invasion of Iraq. Endpapers are individually block-printed and hand-tinted by the artist; contents are a bracing throwback to the days before Photoshop, and a reminder of the still-dramatic possibilities offered by scissors, glue and Papermate Flair pens. "Amazing. Some of the best use of collage I've ever seen, and my favorite handwriting since Whalen"--Gary Sullivan.

"The Prescription Drug Challenge"
by Carl Martin

It was while popping members of the "triptan"
family
That I began dreaming of the South African
killer bee.
Trapped inside a diamond shaped molecule its
sticky, yellow venom
Slides inside its slick confinement like wind
sliding
Through the furry cuffs of the pussy willow.
This bee is a good swimmer, but not a great
swimmer
Though its talent has been honed bouncing
through the waves
The spray and loneliness of the South Coast.
I know deep in the knobby, long distance
knees of the soul
That it has not spread all the pollen that I
would like to spread with it.
Somehow, in my wise inclinations I fear that
this is a truly American
"Stinger," a short spanned hum-vee of the
wild Florida grasses
Plowing through the airs and porches like a
long-legged advert
In ways that Maeterlinck could never have
imagined,
Not even poetically, "just as Deborah, whose
name means Bee"
Judged Israel--in a story I may not actually
have read.
This is the way the blind see, even in Miami.
Jehovah forgive us
And excise from the brain: the flesh, the
hubbub, and the rub
For sometimes through the digital
transference that is all we see
Though the light is blinding.
And the contest never as numbing as we would
like.

In a Jail in Cuba Beat the Heart of a Poet

Afghan, Now Freed by U.S., Scribbled on Paper Cups but Never Stopped
Writing

By N.C. Aizenmann
Washington Post Foreign Service

PESHAWAR, Pakistan -- Among the old leather volumes in the library of
Abdul Rahim Muslim Dost is a black plastic binder full of rumpled
letters he wrote, sent from the U.S. military prison at Guantanamo Bay,
Cuba.

At the bottom of each form is a perfunctory salutation. The rest is
taken up with the poems that helped Dost keep his sanity during nearly
three years of confinement.

"Bangle bracelets befit a pretty young woman," begins one of the poems.
"Handcuffs befit a brave young man."

The letters were one in a series of measures the Afghan-born author said

he took to record the torrent of imagery and insights that flooded his
brain nearly every day of his captivity.

At first, deprived of paper and pen, Dost memorized his best lines or
scribbled them secretly on paper cups. Later, he was supplied with
writing materials and made up for lost time by producing reams of poems
and essays -- only to have all but a few of the documents confiscated by

the U.S. government upon his release.

"Why did they give me a pen and paper if they were planning to do that?"

Dost asked last week with evident anguish. "Each word was like a child
to me -- irreplaceable."

The slight, soft-spoken man of 44 was back in his library Friday in this

city near the Pakistani-Afghan border, surrounded by stacks of Islamic
texts. It was just two days after the U.S. government had delivered him
and 15 other former prisoners to Afghan authorities.

As soon as he was freed, Dost headed east to Peshawar, his home since
the 1980s, where several hundred well-wishers and eight shy children
waited to greet him in a large carpeted parlor.

Dost said he was arrested by Pakistani police in November 2001, along
with his younger brother, Badr. The two were kept in solitary
confinement for two months, then transferred to U.S. military detention
in Afghanistan, where prisoners were kept in larger groups but forbidden

to speak to one another.

The brothers, both gemstone dealers, said they had been falsely accused
by enemies linked to the Pakistani government and detained in the
frenzied hunt for terrorists that followed the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.
They said they had no links to either Afghanistan's Taliban regime or al

Qaeda.

But their American captors, they said, seemed to believe otherwise. In
Afghanistan, they said, Americans sheared off their beards, forbade them

to wash, shoved their faces into the dirt and screamed curses in their
ears during frequent interrogations.

The accounts could not be independently verified. The procedures are
secret, and U.S. officials in Afghanistan refused to comment on the 16
detainees released last week.

Badr, who was released six months ago, said he volunteered to clean out
the metal drums used by prisoners for bathing, hoping to get close
enough to Dost to quietly compare notes on the accounts they were giving

interrogators.

Dost had other priorities.

"What kind of spring is this," he whispered in verse as Badr approached,

"where there are no flowers and the air is filled with a miserable
smell?"

Badr said he gaped in disbelief. Even in prison, his brother was
composing poems.

But Badr said he gained new appreciation for Dost's talent after they
were shipped to Guantanamo in May 2002. The two were kept in separate
wire pens, and could only glimpse each other from a distance. The U.S.
government had declared all such prisoners "enemy combatants," subject
to indefinite detention and ineligible for many rights accorded
prisoners of war.

Badr said he grew increasingly depressed, until one day someone handed
him a tiny note written on a flattened paper cup.

"It was just a short poem," Badr recalled. "Something about how in life
everything is possible and we should be patient because freedom is close

at hand." But it was enough to swell his heart with hope. "I was
suddenly so happy," he said.

Dost had smuggled the note to Badr through an ingenious ruse. Every few
days, representatives from the International Committee of the Red Cross
arrived with forms so prisoners could write brief letters home. They
were given only 10 minutes, but that was enough to dash off other notes
on hidden scraps of paper cups. Prisoners then passed the messages
between wire pens on pulleys made of threads from their prayer caps.

Dost said he also began adding poems to the Red Cross forms. When they
reached Peshawar, his oldest son carefully stowed each new missive in
the black plastic binder.

In his first months of confinement, Dost's poetry had been full of
despair. But now, having at last found a way to record his compositions,

Dost said he felt his spirits lift. The heat and mosquitoes in the camp
were as bothersome as ever, but his sense of hopelessness gave way to
optimism and defiance.

"Just as the heart beats inside the darkness of the body, so I, although

in a cage, continue to beat with life," began one letter-poem. "Those
who have no courage or honor think themselves free, but are slaves. I am

flying on the wings of thought, and so, even in this cage, I am more
free than they."

Meanwhile, about a year after Dost's arrival in Cuba, he learned that
U.S. authorities had agreed to allow the prisoners pens and paper.

The rules were strict. To prevent detainees from using pens as weapons,
the guards gave out a flexible, rubber variety that made writing
awkward. Each man was limited to one sheet of paper per shift, but Dost
said fellow inmates donated their paper to him, then eagerly read his
poems. One of his most popular was a satire criticizing the U.S.
military for sending people to Cuba on thin evidence.

"That poem was on everybody's lips," he recalled with a proud smile.

Dost's satirical penchant had gotten him into trouble before. After he
wrote a poem lampooning an Islamic cleric in Peshawar, he said, the man
bore him such a grudge that he fingered him to Pakistani intelligence
agents, leading to his arrest.

At Guantanamo, he said, he had to spend hours explaining to
interrogators a satirical essay he had published in 1998, after
President Bill Clinton offered a $5 million reward for Osama bin Laden.
Dost's essay offered a reward of 5 million afghanis -- then the
equivalent of about $113, he said -- for Clinton.

Eventually, he said, the interrogators seemed convinced that he had not
meant any serious harm. In February 2004, Dost said, he was transferred
to another section of Guantanamo where he had access to as much paper as

he wanted.

He continued to produce hundreds of poems, translated the Koran into
Pashto and wrote a text on Islamic jurisprudence.

In the meantime, Dost said, he was taken before a review tribunal, a
brief procedure that he described as a "show trial," even though it
ultimately resulted in his release. To date, U.S. military officials
said, 232 Guantanamo detainees have been released and more than 500
remain in custody.

Often, Dost said, the guards conducted raids when officials suspected a
detainee had issued a fatwa -- an Islamic decree against them. Each
time, all inmates' writings were confiscated. Dost said he was assured
that his work would be returned to him on his release.

But when that day finally came last week, Dost said, he received only a
duffel bag with a blanket, a change of clothes and a few hundred papers
-- a fraction of his writings.

This parting blow, he said, struck him harder than all the humiliations
of confinement. On Friday, as well-wishers swarmed into his home, he
said his only thought was how to recover his work.

"If they give me back my writings, truly I will feel as though I was
never imprisoned," he said. "And if they don't.... "

Dost's voice trailed off. For the first time in three years, he was at a

loss for words.

Whitman also attempted to make money by buying real estate, building
houses, and trying to sell them (not very successfully), tried running a
stationery store out of his home, and, as most know, failed at several
newspaper ventures. Not sure if W. did any readings, but he did lecture,
as A. S. says below. I, too, would be interested to know if W. did public
readings? There's the very brief Edison recording that is supposedly
Whitman's nasally voice--if that's really him, his reading presence might
not have lived up to the persona--but the work itself would certainly more
than compensate, I would think. There was also a subscription service
established for him to raise money for a home, but he supposedly spent it
on a family tomb. This is all info available in the many bios. Twain also
toured the lecture circuit, especially when he was in financial trouble.

We did a marathon reading of the 1855 here on campus at WestConn
yesterday. Everyone wanted to read the "What is the grass" section. Few
wanted to read the long catalogues of occupations.

  Did Whitman give poetry readings?

This has been going on since the Reagan Administration began to force =
PBS into commercialism. But I have noticed it getting worse lately, =
under the guise of "fairness." How the right-wing corrupts language to =
further its biases has also been going on a long time. In the last =
century, Nazi Germany was as brilliant at this as Carl Rove is now.

Progressive forces in this country are indeed being driven underground, =
and into the unconscious, there to be soulfully nurtured. Meanwhile, =
poets are charged with keeping the language balanced on the point where =
Stanley Kunitz says it is "surprised in the act of changing into =
meaning," even if unheard by the maddening crowd.

The Pentagon finally releases "official" photographs of fallen
Americans after continued pressure from families of the victims.

_______________________________________
"By not allowing the images to be shown, the military is preventing
people from seeing the human cost of war.

Begleiter, now a journalism professor at the University of Delaware,
worked with the National Security Archive, a group founded in 1985 by
journalists and scholars, to get the pictures released.

"This is an important victory for the American people, for the families
of troops killed in the line of duty during wartime, and for the honor
of those who have made the ultimate sacrifice for their country," he
wrote in a statement posted Tuesday on the group's Web site.

According to the National Security Archive, the Pentagon released a
CD-ROM containing 268 images Monday."

At long last, I feel like responding to this strange discussion of Ginsberg.  Many of his poems are great.  Even Whitman has poems nobody reads anymore.  The man is dead.  The poetry is all that matters.  As for his supposed "misogyny",  I never heard or saw him treat women badly.  For some reason this discussion reminds me of people who hate Wagner's great music because of his personal anti-Semitism.  That they deprive themselves of the greatest opera composer of all time is sad.  There is no anti-Semitism anywhere in his music.  Only people who were forced to listen to his music in the camps seem justified to me in hating it.  As for those who dismiss it without hearing, they're minds are as closed as Wagner's apparently once was.  As for Ginsberg, he should be judged solely by what remains on the page.  His persona has gone on to its next life or whatever pertains after death.

Joel Weishaus <weishaus@PDX.EDU> wrote:Allen was always generous to me. I've heard the stories, of course, but he's gone now. Why not look at the gifts he gave us, instead of criticizing the man who no longer exists? The proof is in the poetry. Like with many great artists, some of it, I think, is not very good. But there are also the large masterpieces, and the wonderful little gems.

A poet is a person who isn't any better than any other person. Often,  early,
and continually,  a poet writes how they feel and sometimes how  they'd like
to feel. If the confusions and imperfections infused or imprinted on  the poet
aren't reflected in their work, it's a pretty safe bet that they either
don't accept those aspects of themselves or they're ashamed to write them down
for posterity. I agree that we shouldn't judge works of art on the imperfections
 of the artists' humanity but on the merit of their work; or better yet not
judge  at all. We simply choose that which we prefer since there's so much to
choose  from, just like people.

there's more than enough to choose from. and why the psychotherapy? if a po=
et writes the way they feel they are really jeoperdizing communicating any =
of that because language does not convey pain or suffering. It communicates=
 it. So what of it? We write poems to question the relationship between wor=
ds, not the relationships between people. No one writer is better than anot=
her, but their intuition might be stronger than another's: that's how one c=
ould judge such work. A name, what's in a name? to use the addage. Sometime=
s profundity will be and sometimes it will fail. Poetry, writing, they're e=
xperiments, they can't always be perfect. Ah, they can never be perfect. So=
 trying to express something like "woe is me"? who the frigg cares, i'm not=
 concerned about the poet, i'm concerned about the poem. hell, i even hate =
to call it poetry! it's writing. ah, see, it is writing, an object, but als=
o an act. so, trying to say "woe is me"? "I am woe"? someone will read it l=
ike Spicer or Williams said, "my football is angry!"

This is a worthy idea and suggestion, but I'm not sure I completely agree
with this in practical terms. Maybe Mary Jo Malo is thinking mainly of
recent and contemporary poets. Obviously, over time,  poets' works and lives
are interwoven in the public imagination, and are occasionally seen together
as representative of an era and even have been claimed by some to usher in
an artistic era. In this case, the "humanity" of the poet is looked at
closely. Think of Mallarme in this light; few ardent readers have not read
about and visualized his famous "Tuesday night" soirees, attended by such
luminaries as Debussy. Mallarme and Baudelaire's interest in the visual arts
have been a great influence on countless subsequent poets. A fascinating
example of this tendency are the oft-cited discussions of Walter Benjamin on
Baudelaire. Baudelaire's way of handling his poverty, and the fact that his
poetry remained largely unrecognized in his lifetime helped to create the
very concept of the "bohemian" lifestyle. Think of how Emily Dickinson and
Gertrude Stein are depicted not only in the light of their works, but their
lives. The "imperfections" of an artist's life might later be
seen as an opening for liberating possibilities for the lifestyles of
countless others. My favorite book on this is Shattuck's *The Banquet
Years.* Despite the earnest and sincere efforts on the part of many critics
and theorists to separate poets' lives from their works, readers of poetry
and people on the whole generally connect the two. Who hasn't thought
about the implication of Kafka asking, before he died, that his writing
be destroyed by his best friend, who, thankfully, disregarded this?
There are so many examples of such anecdotes that shape the
way we regard a writer's works.

Come to  think of it, he may have been on the night before,

I'm looking for someone. To illustrate these 12 gems. I'm thinking New York=
er illustrations. I pulled a short story someone was writing apart sentence=
 by sentence (as I did with A Sondheim's but line by line and constructed "=
Am Scramble" which someone on this list needs to write me about, publishers=
 per se) and added some commentary. But do write. Illustrate, or just illus=
trate and send to me:

Christophe Casamassima
19 Murdock Rd
Baltimore MD 21212



12 Step Program Leads to a Kiss


1. Hubert turned into Marty=92s driveway and parked his pickup alongside Ma=
rty=92s rig.

Hubert and Marty are constructs of divinity: one is full of light and air t=
he other full of dark
and matter.

2. The moment Hubert glanced at the eighteen-wheeler he could tell it had b=
een out in the
previous night=92s storm.

The storm is the personification of endless night, the travels between a he=
re we're aware of and
a there not forthwith. The eighteen wheeler is dashed against Hubert's skul=
l.

3. He walked around the tractor-trailer and saw that the chassis was still =
wet and the mudguards
and the fenders were splattered with fresh grime.

We must stop here and decide if it is necessary to go on. The marker natura=
lly is the
tractor-trailer, or the fenders, we don't really know because the splatter =
of fresh grime
deviates from the kiss that is happening down the street.

4. Hubert continued towards the house.

It was Hubert's intention to go on but the house suddenly becomes a metapho=
r for Atlas, shag
carpeting, or the grime-splattered fenders of the previous part.

5. It was a modest manufactured home covered with rose-colored vinyl siding=
 finished with white
trim.

Modesty became a mouse and fled the scene, only to become filled with joy a=
s Hubert went on
toward the house. It was eventually crushed to death when Marty jumped for =
joy as Hubert entered
his house. The vinyl siding is no longer an allegory but means only vinyl s=
iding.

6. It had a wide covered porch in front with several rockers carefully alig=
ned side by side.

Ibidem is necessary here, but there is no repetition, except for the rocker=
s, which point, as a
theoretical element, to "rocker."

7. It was built in the middle of an ample grassy lot that sloped towards a =
pond at the rear of
the property.

An ample grassy lot provides an idyllic setting. Sloping towards a pond, th=
e rhetoric takes off
here and becomes fashionable.

8. Hubert knocked on the door a couple of times without response, so he wal=
ked around the
side of the house looking for Marty.

Repetition becomes visibly inundated, and the kissing stops. The side of th=
e house is Marty's=20
inconsistencies, not a metaphor for them.



9. When he got to the rear of the house he spotted Marty sitting on a beach=
 chair at the end of a=20
rickety wooden dock that jutted out into the pond.

Now the rear of the house is a metaphor for Hubert's inconsistencies, not h=
is actual inconsistencies, as proved in the former part. Marty is sitting, =
not standing, which is reminiscent of The Odyssey. It is the pond, not the =
chair, that is rickety.

10. Marty was puffing on a cigar butt while holding a fishing pole fashione=
d out of a bamboo reed.

If anything in this story is fashioned from a bamboo reed it is rhetoric. A=
 fishing pole=20
foreshadows the kiss might begin again. Any cigar, in this case, is an allu=
sion to the Freudian=20
slip about to happen next.

11. The nylon line extended down to the water, where it connected to a big =
chunk of old cork=20
floating on the surface.

The nylon line is life. The water is the end of civilization. The tension b=
etween the cork and the=20
surface of the water demarcates Good and Evil in Whitehead. The kissing eve=
ntually begins, as we=20
have noted in a previous part.

12. A few strands of gray hair stuck out haphazardly from under the back of=
 his crumpled hat, not=20
much unlike the sparse patches of hair that grew scattered across his shirt=
less back and shoulders.

Rain is gathering in the pond at the back of Marty's neck. The hair is a rh=
etorical element. The=20
crumpled hat negates the kissing so the kiss never happened.

13. Hubert approached the dock and greeted Marty.

Hubert and Marty reconcile their differences, and kiss.

ordinary after reading an article like this.  If science can access the roots

Hip Hop: Get to know LANGUAGE ARTS

With over 12 years of combined experience, Language Arts came together
in 2002. Durham native Emcees Aden and Pierce have performed all over
the Triad and various cities in North and South Carolina, Virginia,
Georgia and the District of Columbia. DJ Web was added to the group in
March, 2004 to enrich the live shows and add the classic deejay element
to the hip-hop performances. This politically conscious and thought
provoking Hip-Hop group released their self-titled debut album in March
of 2004.

Get to know LANGUAGE ARTS ( Friday, April 29, 2005 )

* The Group
* Aden Darity
* Pierce Freelon
* DJ Web

With over 12 years of combined experience, Language Arts came together
in 2002. Durham native Emcees Aden and Pierce have performed all over
the Triad and various cities in North and South Carolina, Virginia,
Georgia and the District of Columbia. DJ Web was added to the group in
March, 2004 to enrich the live shows and add the classic deejay element
to the hip-hop performances.

This politically conscious and thought provoking Hip-Hop group released
their self-titled debut album in March of 2004. The CD was met with
widespread critical acclaim, including a 5-star review in Chapel Hill’s
Daily Tar Heel; “Original, innovating… vocals and poetic lyrics that
educate” (Chapel Hill’s DTH).

In less than eight months, over 2,000 copies of this release have been
sold, without the benefit of mainstream distribution channels or a
record label. The album features beats from North Carolina producers
Chan Diesel, Hollin, NAV and Bashore Productions. Language Arts is
currently unsigned, but still on the grind.

For booking information or if you want a copy of the album, e-mail
booking@languageartsmusic.com with your contact information.

Language Arts has performed with the world renowned hip-hop pioneers,
The Last Poets, 5-time Grammy nominated Jazz vocalist, Nnenna Freelon,
and will host and perform with the legendary Grand Master Flash on
December 2, 2004.

Emcee Pierce Freelon was involved with a national network of rap artists
and hip-hop activists this fall as North Carolina’s Coordinator for a
national voter registration/mobilization organization called Hip-Hop
Voices. As reflected through their lyrics, “fight for your rights and
the future of the youth, shoot through stereotypes ‘stead of for loot,
put down the remote, go downtown and vote…,” Language Arts does not just
talk about change, they make change.

Language Arts has also engaged the hip-hop community through North
Carolina’s public school system. This fall, Language Arts went into
Durham School of the Arts (a public middle/high school) with a hip-hop
curriculum developed by Pierce. Language Arts worked with students in
the Minority Studies, Creative Writing and Percussion Ensemble classes,
teaching the history of Hip-Hop Culture/Music, and developing/performing
original pieces with the students. Language Arts’ Hip-Hop History
curriculum/residency program will continue at high schools in North
Carolina and Massachusetts in the Spring of 2005.

Pierce is the 20-year-old son of 5-time Grammy nominated jazz vocalist
Nnenna Freelon. Aden is the 23-year-old son of UNC-CH Economics
Professor and Blues performer Sandy Darity and the nephew of
award-winning poet Harryette Mullen. DJ Web, 22, was raised in Houston,
TX where he began his craft mentored by DJ Chill, "Houston's #1 street DJ."

Minds are soluble dissolve reality, I scowl at you
But man is fellable and minds are also malleable
Is it really radical to figure, this tight grip of fingers
Right combined with left wingers unite,
Consider unity

Unsanctioned interaction between factions
Disciplinary action
Public defender rendered helpless
Under the weight of excess evidence,
Post no bills, spray burner bibles
Because I’m liable to plagiarize the writing on the wall
Relay the message, repeat graffiti for the needy,
Needing, feeding, reading, confetti on parades
Of prejudiced people, on display all dismayed
Incubated in a haven of intense affliction
Borne of fiery contradiction
Rested my head on drunken pillows in sobriety’s womb
Sacrifice self as salve in society’s wound,
The go-between chameleon, middleman who always gets killed by the third act
That’s a fact: they sacrifice the messenger to keep everyone else intact
Holler back

CHORUS:

Minds are soluble dissolve reality, I scowl at you
But man is fellable and minds are also malleable
Is it really radical to figure, this tight grip of fingers
Right combined with left wingers unite,
Consider unity

Unilateral decision making procedures,
Leaders lost our way right?
Litmus shows sickness, what we witness is different in broad daylight
(But our hearts’ texts mesh)
Providing context,
Combating the stress,
On community, you give a little, I give a little,
We work together, to make it all clear
Making concessions for people capable of only three emotions:
Anger, loneliness, and fear
We bond on surface levels and become tangential,
But art becomes the circles’ intersections in Venn
Still the lonesome longing lingers
Aural arts a start, therefore blessed are the singers
Aden’s blazing, creating a tight grip of fingers

lori,

i can believe that you are from victoria (the town were i have been
blacklisted and harassed beyond tolerence)
by the way you attempt to exclude voices via revision of charters and
game rules when you feel the threat of
"them" folk might be overwhelming the euro-melba toast hegemony for
victorians of british columbia operate by
using and revising bylaws and articles to exclude people and control
their zones.

if you'd only admit you messed up -- not a vict(im) (wh)oria nor a
kkkanadian trait --
things might be breezy.  b.u.t. cultural white middle class hegemony is
what you were taught as
uber youth on this island and you out to spread the hate through the
world -- in a polite
kkkanadian manner whcih just charms teh socks off folk or bores them.
your back peddling and sending these notes after the fact after getting
nailed for the
prejudicial treatment you attempted to invoke prove this full out. and
you still say,
as the hole gets deeper, that you are making preferencial treatment of
certain people
over the others-- an  admission. as for responses to poems and
criticism-- well obviously
you are wrong my post do invoke responses and reaction.

i know you in a form, kkkanadians, especailly, victorian (a city which
has actively
resisted mutliculturalism for decades) don't like to hear from niggers,
the poor or
natives (peace to anthony james dawson). ...and they will use rules and
regulations to
enforce this agenda.

as for the news i post-- none come the times colonist -- for it is
backward peice
racist drivel with poor journalism and a supremacist agenda.

you, my enemy, were upset because you got caught and you have no
intention of letting this nigger
speak on this list as does kkkanada as would your uber stomping ground
victoria and the rightwing
hack paper you delivered would either.

i am forwarding your notes because i don't deal with this hypocracy and
backward amerikkanist 1950's exclusion tactricks, in this city (your
hilterian
youth training ground) nor anywhere else --- and my work and life
(reduced to "card") has been
a struggle against it.

don't play me

I want to put in a brief defense of Lawrence Braithwaite here.
Perhaps you folks administering the list aren't familiar with him,
but he's an important writer, and if you're going to make exceptions
to the no poem policy, then he certainly should be one of the
exceptions.

But having a no poem policy and then making exceptions seems wrong to
me.  I do not think the list supervisors should be making such
editorial decisions.  Either allow poems or ban them.  Don't decide
some people are worthy of filling our mailboxes and others aren't.

Also, I think some definition of poem needs to be agreed upon.  To
make a genre decision of post versus poem on an experimental poetry
discussion list is problematic.  It's a sort of genre policing that
such a list, I would imagine, should be geared towards subverting.
It's not that I care to be flooded with bad poetry, but these sorts
of aesthetic decisions, as Lawrence points up, are also political.

Best,
Dodie

I do not understand the concept that there is no relationship between a writer and his/her work. Why is he or she writing then? This relationship does not mean a biographical narrative. It may be related to a political event or obsession or an object of curiosity, etc.

This does not mean that the reader has to see the work by charting biographical parallels. In my case, a few poets I admire and and am deeply affected by are offensive as human beings to me, including in aspects of their work. For instance, I can not stomach Pound's rants about usury, always with echoes of Jews with big noses. Despite that, there is nobody who has said truer things about American poetry than Pound. I have to live with both, neither erasing the truth of the other.

Dear Alan,
With the founding of "Company of Poets" by Mary Jo Malo, together with
the reaction to creating exceptions to list policy on posting poems
(including your own reaction) we have decided to move the poetics list
away from any postings of literary works that do not directly engage
in a list discussion or  make announcements. We have all very much
appreciated your presence on this list over the years and I expect to
continue to read your work as you post it elsewhere (and be sure to
continue to send alerts of such publication). Of course, we hope and
expect that you will continue to send your many discussion-oriented
posts that have enriched list conversation over the years.

With best,
poetics editorial board
Charles Bernstein, Lori Emerson, Joel Kuszai, Nick Piombino

What seemed to me the creeping "Mary Jo Maloization"
of this list, is actually official list policy. Wow.

Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

I'm working on a presentation of the influence of E.
E. Cummings, and wondering if anyone knows anything
about what seems to me his fairly extensive influence
(however indirect) on langpo--in the use of such
devices as changed parts of speech (anyone know the
correct term for that, by the way?), fragmentation of
words, intrasyllabic punctuation. . . .  I don't know
language poetry well enough to grab examples but have
found one poem by Robert Fitterman that works.
Something by Creeley, too.  No doubt it's sacrilege,
but I claim Olson was influenced by Cummings, too.
Hannah Weiner, certainly.  Bruce Andrews (I'm thumbing
through In The American Tree).  P. Inman, whom I've
written about.

I'd love to see anything anyone here is writing that
uses devices Cummings used, for I'm aiming for a kind
of anthology of what I call burstnorm poetry (visual
and language poetry, predominantly) using E.E.
Cummings as a kind of figurehead to keep the
stasguards from getting too frightened--although I
genuinely count Cummings as Very Important and
Influential.

What's noteworthy about yet another awards outfit
giving a hypercertified poet yet another award?  Tell

never-certified poet, Ron.
