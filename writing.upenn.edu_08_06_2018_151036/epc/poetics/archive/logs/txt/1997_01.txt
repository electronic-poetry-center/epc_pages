I'm away from my books and working from memory,
but didn't Williams write: "The poem is a capsule
wherein we wrap up our punishable _secrets_."
I thought so.

i think henry posted a plea last week for responses to ron's questions
about how to forge a poetry adequate to this post-ridden (-industrial,
-modern, -capitalist, etc) age.

two books i bought myself for xmas are providing interesting food for
thought. michael coe's _breaking the maya code_ goes over the developments
which led in the past decade to the decipherment of mayan hieroglyphs; and
gerard genette's _mimologiques: voyage en cratylie_ (tr. thais morgan)
recounts a history of cratylism (plato's character cratylus argues that
words and things are not related to one another arbitrarily or through
convention and use but directly, naturally, and correctly) as a kind of
unthought of western language theory.

postmodernism should be the moratorium of any future isms.  so eager to
historicize, we've posted ourselves right out of currency, right past
contemporanaeity (this is peter osborne's argument in _the politics of
time_).  at the very least we are not post-anything but pre-something.

we actually are behind and have a lot of catching up to do.  personal
computers, for example, have become so powerful and sophisticated in ten
years (the xt-clone i still use was top shit in 1987) that they're beyond
the needs and capacities of the average user, so that now network
computers (basically an internet box) might be the answer.

used to seem like we were in a period of baroque excess in need of a bach
or ramon fernandez to come along with synthesis, blessed rage for order.
or forge ahead with nothing in the napsack but irony and freeplay.  no, i
think going back, especially through modernisms, with a needle and thread,
stitching together accounts anew, showing different figures in the fabric
in different lights.  like henry has been saying our take on (post)
modernism needs to be supplemented by others (russian etc.)

as for poetry, cheers to charles alexander for championing "un coup de
des," which i still think is so unlike anything before or after it.  go
from yr standard alexandrines or blank verse to "un coup de des," and
project forward a comparable revolution, and that's the poetry of the
future. in prose, perform a similar projection with finnegans wake.  what
more can be done after these, well a lot of mucking around for sure. but
until we can read beyond linear script...

iconicity!  and archive, archive, archive!  amass, and let the search
engines find the string.

happy new year all,
tom orange

Yep, that's the veep and the gaffe I was alluding to. But I catch your
point on the prefix. Well, that's the way Dan told me it was spelled. I
voted for "ex-" but he corrected me. I said oh come on. He said "I'll bet

Chris, ain't it just a question of USING the poem--of an ordering
around your own hard feelings--or not?

You can do whatever you want, but I'd come down with WCW here, such a
use makes for pretty uninteresting poems. I once heard a very famous
poet, winner of mucho big prizes and dinero at SUNY Barfalo, not of
this ilk, but who shall nevertheless remain unnamed, read a LONG poem
trashing Philip Larkin, comparing him to a dog etc., all of it apparently
having to do with some mano a mano bs boy bizness. Like who cares.
Sooner or later the muse'll get you for that, even if the
Gugeneheim-McArthur-Nobel folks go all weak in the knees for it.

Alright alright alright.  In his prose book Watermark and in several of the
poems he uses "chordate" a host of times, referring to buildings and
atmospheres as well as mammals.  Apologies if this was taken as a lousy
example.

A "righteous" judge and a vindictive judge (both of which are at once annoying
and dangerous). I use the word JUDGE because the action grounded by these two
distinctions of love makes all the difference here.  Did Williams believe in
"tough love?"

I would rather have read "For if the poem set out to CUT THE LAWN and TRIM THE
HEDGES, it had better be on the basis of fulfilled love rather than
unfulfilled," but Williams must have written these lines on a weekday and not a
weekend.

I would argue that Williams makes no bones here about poetry's apocalyptic
function. It can read outlandishly today because the market for apocalyptic
poetry is so depressed. When the market changes, the assets are redubbed
"prophecy."

You can have your wafer, you can eat it too (no teeth please), but then it's
gone and whether you will return for more is up to you.

This list will end tomorrow
in a fiery surge.

Well--is it selves or secrets?
         ("we have no selves; we tell each other everything"--
              carly simon)
And Mike Boughn--thank you for your response. I think we
   read the quote differently--I was not suggesting that
   how dare WCW disclaim large bitter mean-spirited     narrowminded
   (sons of tricky dicky?--sorry) poems trashing Larkin or
    Ashbery or Silliman or whoever--but was questioning
     or uncomfortable with what seemed to be an implication
     that one cannot write poetry from the point of view of
     unfulfilled love--that such is not valid, that one should
    ,say, wait until one is 40 and married or something until
     one can claim the "stable" authority of being a poet---
     I fear such a taboo (though I wouldn't say it's WCW's fault)
     seems to have taken hold in many poetry interpretative
      communities, or "scenes" or "aesthetics" and that I rather
      wish to leave the possibility open that one may indeed
      USE one's frustration and unrequital--if that's all one
      "has"--to write poems, and explore that subjectivist
       gap in which one may punish one's own desire to punish
       others (etc. a kind of via negativa) without necessarily
       "taxing any private party" (satire--but satire, too, often
         gets a bad rap--one thinks of some dude in a powdered
        blue wig oh so witty oh so witty and privieleged and
       lacking pathos as if the two modes are incompatible

Yeah, Chris, but in the quote you provided the fullfilled/unfullfilled
love part of the proposition is tied to the question of (I don't have
the quote here now) the question of using the poem to represent a
moralistic world. Hence my response. He seems to be saying, yeah, it's
ok, or it can work to represent the world in terms of good and bad if
its from an experience of fullfilled love, an act of generosity, if
you will. Otherwise it's just more of that old protestant mean streak,
self-centered judgmentalism. Love is thus seen as transformative, even in
relation to moralizing. I was trying to understand the relation of
the two parts of the proposition, which don't seem to make sense to me
if taken separately.

One often notes in a satirist - just as in a professional comic -
a sort of conjunction of opposites - an ability to shock convention
combined with its Janus-face - a sort of bedrock conservative trust
in the order of things. So the talent to make & perform very bold
 poetry - to snarl & whimper & scorn & adore - is balanced by its
antithesis - Baudelaire, maybe??  - Henry G  (responding to Chris's
strophes).

Subject:      Re: "tough love" WCW (the judge he holds a grudge)

Yippee, the holidays are over!
I saw CITIZEN RUTH tonight (and recommend it--Ruth's reply to her mother's
question: "Just think what would have happened if
*i* would have had an abortion?" is worth the price alone)
Ruth, Dan Bouchard, rejects "tough love" (or is it "rough love")
at one point....
Well, ONWARD, to Williams---
   Open question, when shoplifting at the store (or swimming near the shore)
where they sell (or where are anchored)
       ethical maxims, do you chose "JUDGE NOT, LEST YE BE
        JUDGED"?
    Now, let's say they're playing a muzak version of the DIRE
    STRAITS song that reminds you that "when you point the
     finger at someone because your plans went through, you got
     three more fingers pointing back at you"---but you may
     not have to hear it (because of the poetry walkman you're
     wearing and unheard sounds are sweeter...) and it may not
     inform the decision you must make....
     Or do you CHOOSE TO JUDGE, choose to choose, choose to go...knowing that
you may most likely be judged in return,(and are too impatient to wait for
death)
    and maybe choosing to judge harshly because YOU want
    to be judged, or want people to ADMIT that they are judging
    as if somehow it's deeper, or more intimate than mere
    "unconditional love"?
    Judgment is often contrasted with perception....
     but that distinction is largely linguistic
     (unless one does not ever feel like EYES are JUDGING)...
     judgment may be allowed to be irrational, provisional....
     but it seems to me it is too often taken (mistaken) as
     final and binding (because interlocutors are queasy? or
     because they don't consider it to be as SEXY as I do?)

"Make it easy on yourself" is another song they play on shore...
  "You made it there somehow"( Dylan)
   So, Michael---yes, WCW's point is certainly to criticize
    the ethical puritan vindictiveness that he feels ignores and
    denies the sensuous pleasures of the present and certainly
    i would not argue against him here yet I don't know if I can
    so easily translate his "fulfilled love" into "generosity" as
    you do. It may be what YOU mean, but I don't know if it's
   what HE means (of course, what YOU mean is more important
    to me anyway right now). For my own part, I would change
    the terms to something like "doubt" and "dogma" (even if
    this seems to sacrifice "eros" for the time being)---
    I.e. "If the poem sets out to punish the wicked or reward
     the plants, it had better do so in the basis of DOUBT, in a
      spirit of PLAY, improvisation, DESIRE FOR love, truth,
      rather than on dogma, certainty, too rigid posturing."
Fulfilled love (if not merely a "notch in a belt") would be
 "nice" but if we argue that it's NECESSARY as a PRECONDITION
  for judgment (or dialogue), then poetry (or poetics) becomes
  subordinated to "life" (an ideal pretending to be the real) and is reduced
to a mimetic advertisement for a self, a ready made, that has no need for
"poetic creation".....And although I
do not want to outrule the value and beauty of such a mode of
poetry, it does seem quite rare and one has to do something in
the meantime, and attempting to write one's way OUT of
"unfulfilled love"  (as, say, Dickinson did--sometimes at least) may be as
valid as an activity as writing FROM "fulfilled love",
whatever that is...and one may even make moral (or at least ethical) claims
in the process (and such claims need not be seen as mere trying to "drag you
down in the hole that he's in")
                 Chris---

>> curious: how are you defining apocalyptic versus prophetic poetry, and
how does 'the market' define this?<<


I don't want to impress definitions upon poetry through the statements I made
yesterday (re: WCW quote). I mentioned poetry's apocalyptic FUNCTION (a
function that the reader has to be willing to recognize, and not have forced
upon them), not "Apocalyptic" as genre.

A prophet (as defined by my company dictionary) is "a person gifted with
profound moral insight and exceptional powers of expression."  It is not
unusual for poets to possess these characteristics, and for readers to find
them reflected in the poets' work.

But remember: prophets ("true prophets") sometimes communicate a message that
its recipients have a strong distaste for. This is where the market enters. The
"market" is a mood ring on people listening to the message.  Deep blue
indicates the utterance as off base. Scarlet indicates a stoning.  Green means
the message will be acceptable in another two generations or so.

i have missed most of this discussion (various reasons) but couldn't help
but add what follows to the discussion.
i am currently writing a dissertation on apocalypticism and postmodern
american fiction.  a key point to my work is that in the pomo
apocalypticism is all about narrativity.  prophets, or prophetic voices,
are a very intriguing element in the tactic i've taken.
what made me start to think in this direction was reading (for the 1st
time) robinson jeffers, some 3 years ago--most especially the poem
"Cassandra."  i think it has something to add to the discussion at hand,
and so i include it below--

best to all in the new year--
shaunanne

CASSANDRA

The mad girl with the staring eyes and long white fingers
Hooked in the stones of the wall,
The storm-wrack hair and the screeching mouth: does it matter, Cassandra,
Whether the people believe
Your bitter fountain?  Truly men hate the truth; they'd liefer
Meet a tiger on the road.
Therefore the poets honey their truth with lying; but religion-
Venders and political men
Pour from the barrel, new lies on the old, and are praised for kindly
Wisdom.  Poor bitch, be wise.
No: you'll still mumble in a corner a crust of truth, to men
And gods disgusting.  --You and I, Cassandra.
                        --Robinson Jeffers, _The Double Axe_

That virus that was cutting through the multitudes at the MLA (perhaps
loosed upon us by Jonathan Yardley?  did you read his column on that last
day?) finally cuaght up with me on the way out of town, and I haven't
been able to lift hand to read a book since (or to eat, for that matter),
but wanted to post a footnote to the description of the Riding panel
which I trust will soon appear here --

First Ridint panel I attended at an MLA differed in one substantial
respect from this year's -- Riding herself sent a LENGTHY statement
regarding her feelings about such a panel and required of the organizers
that they read it to the assembled audience (who, in that day, amounted
to about ten of us) --  It was every bit as knotty as any of her earlier
writings -- Does anyone know if it's ever been published anywhere????

Subject:      Post-theory language writing?

Yo, Jordan,

That's not what I wrote, of course.

What we need is a discourse about poetry (call it theory if you will,
tho that implies some sense of unity when what's needed actually may be
diversity, discussion and even disagreement) as it is TODAY. Which is
to say, with a sense of whatever it was that was langpo taken as a
(problematic) given, but also incorporating some other very important
aspects of the universe, eg

* The state of the world, post-USSR
* The collapse of the left in the US
  (and Europe) as one (of many) consequences of the above
* The collapse of theory
  (or at least the decline into dismal tenure infighting)
* The social function of writing in a world in which capital
  is clearly more powerful than any state
* The role(s) of technology in all of the above
* The role of writing
  (and of language and language use)
  in relation to each of the above

One obvious consequence of the above set of stuff that would need to be
taken into consideration is the impact of internationalism--which can
be seen in the influence of recent French writing in so many younger
American poets (and not just the ones from Providence--Norma Cole and
Cole Swenson, for example). Or the impact of Russian poets.

Another would be the example (and importance, frankly) of this list and
others like it.

One of the distressing things about recent years has been that, outside
of Chain and a very other venues (Witz, the NY Talk marathon), there
have been few serious places beyond these lists to discuss poetry
seriously that are not entirely within the bounds of academic
institutions (and I'm quite aware of just whose server this message
will sit). With the exception of those in the academy, there has been a
virtual shutdown of theoretical work by poets in my own age group
since, say, 1990.

I'm open to any and all suggestions.

Ron

I thought I posted the following to the Poetics List a few days ago, but it
turns out I had a real snafu in my email addresses list, & I think I ended
up posting it to Pierre Joris. Sorry, Pierre, it was not intended solely for

charles


Very busy lately, holidays & all, so just getting back to some thinking
about Ron's & other's responses to my initial query regarding the relative
absence of visual & other multimedia poetries within lang-poetry circles.
Part of this is so hard just because one resists the labels, even (or maybe
mostly) the lang one.

But I rather disagree with Ron that visual poetry lacks attention to
linguistics, which was/is so important to language poetry. I just think the
linguistic emphasis may be elsewhere. For example, in Karl Young's work
(it's a very broad body of work, and these comments don't apply to all of
it) one encounters a visual surface at times like rubbings of language from
building surfaces (I'm thinking of some of his screen-folds here, but of
other works as well), giving a sense of the history of the presentation of
language, complicated by his work's presentation of works in translation,
thus involving a transference of language in both time (the historical
dimension) and space (one culture to another). This can get quite complex
and is, I think, very much "linguistic." And in Karl Kempton's work, much of
which presents letters structured to make patterns/pictures, often the
choice of letters quite consciously concerns the aural, visual, and
historical properties of those letter forms. This too is linguistic -- and
the patterns presented are sometimes based on sign systems from a variety of
cultures, another linguistic consideration. And certainly in bpNichol's
work, where words are sometimes transformed into pictures and back again,
there is a broad commentary on the nature of language/linguistic systems.
Even in one of Nichol's numerous translations of basho's famous haiku of the
frog jumping into the pond, what seems like a simple picture of a line (the
trajectory of the frog's jump) into an open circle, is actually, because of
the conspicuous placing of that line on the bottom right-hand part of the
circle, a giant uppercase letter Q. This may be stretching the concept of
what is linguistic -- but is it really? I still would agree with Ron that
much of what came to the forefront in some visual poetry anthologies (and
particularly the Mary Ellen Solt anthology) was indeed quite static. But
then within most of the poetry anthologies of any kind critiqued on this
Poetics List over the last couple of years, I think that many of us would
agree there is also a good deal of static work.

It's also intriguing to me that Ron and others bring up Johanna Drucker's
work, pretty much before the work of anyone else. I'm a friend and admirer
of Johanna, but I think her visual poetry (if one wants to consider it as
that rather than as artist's book or visual typography) is but one corner of
a vast body of work. I do agree that her critical work is a beginning toward
a needed body of theory regarding visual poetry/book arts/typographical art
work, but even there I don't think what she or anyone else has done to this
point in any way approaches comprehensive treatment of the field. In some
ways the joy of book arts and visual poetry and sound poetry is that the
work is so outside the academy (for the most part -- yet there are
exceptions) that theory hasn't touched it much. Yet it's also so
individualistic that I can't imagine a theory which could do it justice,
although I do see a great need (and have called for it in numerous places)
for more critical and theoretical approaches to such work. It may be in part
because there isn't a great deal of writing (critical & theoretical) which
might help us approach and understand such works, that far too little
attention is paid to it. Visual poetry (as well as sound poetry, mail art,
book arts, and other related practices, many of which are quite
"linguistic") has resisted almost entirely being absorbed into any programs
or schools or academies, which has perhaps benefited its ability to remain a
valid and widely practiced underground art, but which has made it difficult
for people to find and understand it.

i agree, ron: and tho i myself write from the academy, i'm interested in
precisely theorizing and facilitating practice (i guess, in short, providing a
secondary but necessary discursive context for) of this kind of post-national
poetix.  i feel frustrated on a number of counts, some of which i've aired here,
but heartened that others at least desire the same kind of discourses, even if
we differ about what constitutes the poetic.

MIME-version: 1.0
Content-type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII

Ron and Henry's recent posts have opened up huge territories, and I'll
only try to reply from one particular angle.  One urge that seems
operative in the search for a post-langpo theory or description is simply
the desire for something "other" than language, something for language to
rub up against.  In both Henry's "Providence School" model and the recent
New Coast push this desire took a "mystical" turn.  That's not quite where
I want to go myself, but what I do want is something like a return to "the
world."  When Oppen talks about the world as this "fatal rock" or the
"pure mineral fact," or when he says

The self is no mystery, the mystery is
That there is something to stand on.

We want to be here.

The act of being, the act of being
More than oneself.


he's stating basic propositions, giving basic reminders about the place
from/in which we begin.  This urge toward solidity, groundedness, a
concern with *being*--a concern with the conditions of human habitation in
the physical world (under pressure of technological change, formations of
capital etc etc.) This is a direction often left unpursued by much langpo.
There are always exceptions--say Leslie Scalapino in Way, or Kit Robinson
in Champagne of Concrete--and these exceptions are among my favorite
writings.  Langpo in general has been important to me and figures
centrally in my undestanding of twentieth-century poetry, so i don't want
to caricature--but it's hard not to when you're trying explicitly to write
of general trends.  So:  too often Langpo is ironized, textualized and
flattened out, the poetic corollary of the structuralist and
post-structuralist systematizings (Saussurean linuistics etc.).  It seldom
permits the kind of "earnestness," the concern for "truth" we find in work
like Oppen's. What we need now, maybe--to return to the question of
theory--is a poetic analogue to theorist-writers like Taussig or de
Certeau, who favor a more "tactile" approach, trying to write their way
into the nooks and crannies of the big systems and concepts, punching
holes in the grid, turning blind corners to disappear into unmapped space
etc.  As writing, this is a return to an immanent and phenomenological
mode a la Benjamin.  Rather than irony as a function of knowing the big
bad System is out there and we can't escape it, there is the knowledge
that we live in, through, around, behind the system all the time and it
still leaves us with all the same awkward, anxious, daily, beautiful
dilemmas we've always faced.  So if:

Imagists>Objectivists>New American>Langpo>Worldpo???

(Oversimplified model, i know) how do we return to "the world" bringing
with us all that L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E taught us?  One immediate obection to all
this will be the argument that language *is* how we live in the world, but
I don't really believe this is the whole story.  When Joan Retallack came
here recently for a marvelous reading she quoted (either Austin or Searle,
can't remember which) to the effect that "The dictionary contains all the
distinctions we have cared to make."  That's a great quote--and Joan
seemed to be using it pretty approvingly, but she also corrected herself,
saying that there are some, or perhaps a lot that *aren't* in there.
That's what's fascinating to me--is why we constantly have to put the
distinctions/words that *are* in there together in new ways, to try to get
at the meanings that we feel but don't yet know how to say.  Rubbing two
words together won't make fire unless you can imagine the wood is there
too.

Subject:      To the Larks

"A" "theory" "of" [Post-Language] Writing
or
"To the Larks"

The innumeration of the present conditions set forth by Mr. Silliman signify
the sacral absurdity of the contemporary poetic quest. Given the increasing
difficulties, not of understanding the (corporate) situation, but
of negotiating it-- it is clear why there is not a voluminous literature on
poetics _of the type he & his peers produced_ by those one might stipulate as
"young."

Still, it would be a mistake to consider the "young" unengaged with issues of
poetics-- Mr. Bernstein's phrase in his Riding paper "for what poets do is
turn" provides something of a description for what I see happening in much
contemporary writing. I think there is some accuracy in characterizing those
dubbed language poets as having taken as a or the main source of influence
writers such as Stein/Zukofsky/the Williams of Spring & All etc. A
reinterpretation of the modernist canon. I believe a similar phenomenon may
be going on among the generation following language relative to the New
American Poets (the Allen anthology). We do not "hate speech." Though some of
us, rather boringly engage in it with regard to poets slightly older than us.
When I hear it it strikes me as fourth-beer-talk whatever premise(s) it takes
place on.

To return to our story. This "return" to NYSchool, Blk Mtn, Beat, etc.
poetics in the present leads to a more public poetry, (paradoxically with a
smaller audience?--
this is yet to be seen), than that generally identified w/ language. The work
of Lee Ann Brown, Kevin Davies, Stacy Doris, Ben Friedlander, Lisa Jarnot, P.
Gizzi, Bill Luoma, Jennifer Moxley, Susan Smith Nash, Joe Ross, Chris
Stroffolino, Mark Wallace, Elizabeth Willis, MANY others, all share a public
inflection-- sometimes performative, often not, of speaking to/with/for an
audience which is "accessible" -- not in any simplistic way, but nevertheless
is a real event _in_ the work. Not to charge language with a complete absence
of these concerns but the sense of audience in, say, much of _In the American
Tree_ seems to me quite different. It perhaps assumed a level of information
_because it could_ that it's not clear we can today. So the complexity does
not go away, but takes another direction:

Spicer's "poetry is for poets" (visible in Moxley's dedication: "To my
Contemporaries") as opposed to or thrown in the pot with "no one listens to
poetry."

"For what poets do is turn. . ."

One could also point to various social phenomena as driving this different
sense of audience-- the academy is _not_ supporting poets as it did. &
personally I'm intrigued by the idea of "cognitive limits" -- that what can
be understood can be understood by most people-- this leads to a different
kind of imaging of the poetic project, & of the place of community. It makes
it, I think, even more important, & even more a real possibility.

I've said elsewhere that with the exception perhaps of Fluxus, Language was
the first avant-garde that included equal numbers of women to men. Of course
there's no summation of what this means for the current generation but it is
clear that this trend importantly continues & seems usefully to break down,
though in other ways definitely participates in, the kind of metanarrative of
influence relative to younger writers/langpo/new-amer I've *provisionally*
presented above.

When I hear the term "post-language" my first thought is "why don't we just
call ourselves poets." Insist on the term "Poet" with a capital P, just as at
another time not long ago it was useful to insist on the term "writer" as
opposed to "poet."

With a few years distance from that first preface to _Apex of the M_ one can
see even more clearly the ways in which it was wrong while at the same time
pointing to a necessary, even inevitable, generational differentiation. The
degree to which it was proscriptive about these differences caused many to,
rightly I think,
laugh out loud. However it's unflagging faith in the value of the work being
produced by new writers is touching, _&_ accurate.

The point I suppose is that every & no writer escapes this kind of historical
framing. Escaping it when the work is truly attended to. Eacaping into it?

Two words-- Tom Raworth.

Outside of these questions of generational generosity an issue in poetics
that interests me these days is sense & nonsense. Marnie Parson's book _Touch
Monkeys_ seems to me very good. It frames the issue relative to the genre of
Nonsense (Carrol, Lear, etc.) & makes interesting use of Kristeva in reading
Stein, Zukofsky, Hejinian, others. I'm less interested in the genre than in
some crossing of Wittgenstein w/ Lacan/Kristeva/Zizek but it always comes out
Buddhist. Though when/if I might come up with something presentable. . .

I hope Larry won't mind my outing him this way. As for the other parameters

seriously... I love period pieces, but one has to live _somewhere_... and
now I see Rod's said something. Guess I'll step off.

Rod -- Great post on the present/future of writing, poets as Poets, the
insistence on new Poets writing it and differentiating their project, and
more. Truly, "what poets do is turn . . ."

One concern, though, in this thread. In this attempt to begin a grasping
toward a theory of post-Language writing, is there some assumption that

It seems to me if there is "a" theory of this writing, post-this-or-that, it
is just that-- there are many.

I think "the" theory of language poetry IS that there are many theories of
language poetry.

That is, if there is "a" theory of language poetry at all.

With luck this means there must continue to be a multiplicity of theories,
rather than just one for any post- poetries.

Marjorie Perloff's new book, _Wittgenstein's Ladder: Poetic Language and
the Strangeness of the Ordinary_, is in some sense an anti-theory of the
avant-garde.  Or at least it uses Wittgenstein "against" theory and "for"
avant-garde writing in interesting ways.  My review-essay of this book,
entitled "Perloff's Wittgenstein: W(h)ither Poetic Theory," will come out
this month (so I hear) in _Diacritics_.  It engages some of the issues
Ron mentions (i.e., the collapse of theory, natch).

I've made this offer before, but I'll make it again: anybody who wants an
offprint, mail me backchannel and I'll send you one.  Try to send me
something of yours in return.

Really, tho, everybody should read the whole issue.

Margaret Avison is a great Canadian poet, probably the biggest modernist
influence on the best Canadian poets, bpNichol, etc.

You will find her work in the first run of Cic Corman's _Origin_, and her
second book was published way back in about 1960 or a little later, by
Norton in the USA, as a company tax dodge.

It seems to me that there could be quite a lot of life left to theory, that is
if we allow it to take different forms.  The crisis in theory may be no more
than a crisis in the forms of theory, which might only be a matter of more
general and rapid medial changes that have overwhelmed our traditional means of
cognition and response.  What we probably need now is more non-written theory to
supplement the more standard written variety.

Gregory Ulmer has argued for a teletheory, a theory that uses video and other

Intriguing ideas, Ward. Just as communication occurs in ways which are

Jordan: I was referring to the mean streak within protestantism,
not to all "Protestants": cf Calvin for instance. I thought, perhaps
wrongly, that after Hawthorne it was commonly assumed in many literate
circles that that mean streak was a big part of the foundation of US
culture ("The Maypole at Merrymount", "Young Goodman Brown", _The
House of the Seven Gables_, _The Scarlet Letter_ etc.). Hence Ralph
Reed, Newt, Falwell, etc. etc. all those weasly looking guys with
squinty eyes, moral axes to grind, and big wealthy PACs.

I certainly didn't mean to offend any one on the list.

I knew George was a Baptist, but I thought it was the Molson Baptists.

Mike

Interestingly, now that I think about it, Hawthorne posed the problem
precisely in the terms WCW lays out in the quote Chris posted, i.e.
what's always missing in those bleak, Hawthornian Puritan moralized
landscapes is fullfilled love, not as we have come to limit its
signification and as I hear Chris translating it, i.e. to some one, but
as a mode of living. What Blake called a State, in this case Beulah,
as opposed to, say, Ulro, the State within which, WCW implies, good
poems cannot be written. For Hawthorne, I think it's safe to say, it
was a problem of the failure of the American imagination to live up to
the fundamental Christian values that it originally proposed to found
itself on--love and the forgiveness of sin, as opposed to judgement and
the punishment of sin, or perhaps fullfilled love as opposed to
unfullfilled love.

Yep, I remember, though, my long ago reading of Hawthorne's short stories
(and jejeune essay I published on them) as being about the hassle of being
an artist, whether in "America" or Europe, the question of the creator's
sinful pride and the punishment that comes with it. That is certainly part
of my youth, too, the puritan response to my starting in youth to develop
an artist's personality (you know, staying in bed late etc.).

sorry to bring this up again,  but, adorno's character aside (tho i read the
mandel thread w/ much interest and learned a lot), i was wondering whether
anyone other than me reads his "no poetry after auschwitz" dictum to refer
specifically to lyric poetry, as this is the genre that most preoccupies his
attention elsewhere, and as this statement makes an enormous amount of sense to
me --i.e. no context for the purely self-reflective, aesthetic object that
glorifies the individual subject generating it and celebrated by it...?  that
is, beyond a statement mourning the demise of enlightenment culture generally,
does it indict specific products of that culture --and by implication, suggest
that there are other more appropriate modes of cultural (and within that,
poetic) expression after 1945?  i was on a panel at MLA on "ecstacy, history,
and lyric subjectivity," where i talked about hannah weiner and wanted but was
unable to develop the concept of her poetry as "anti-lyric" subjectivity, or
"post-lyric" (post 1945 poetic) subjectivity, and this question was one i mulled
over somewhat.  any help wd be welcome.  bests, maria d

But Jordan--I don't think neither Michael and I were equating
  PROTESTANT with MORALIZING (at least not in a positive sense, or even in a

      unlike some people (who will remain nameless)
       that a sense of the ETHICAL in poetry means that
          "one supports the status quo....

but I see now that Michael has replied.....
Michael...okay, Blake claims that good poems can not be
written from the state of ULRO....
Yet, I would suggest that part of Blake's "genius" (if I may so use that term
without somebody LAFFING OUT LOUD....although actually if they ENJOY that
laugh, let them) was that he, especially in the 4 ZOAS, MILTON and JERUSALEM,
actually did "give voice" to the ULRO impulse--but made it into a
"character". I am very interested in the poetic freedom the more expansive
mode of poetry afforded Blake--an ability to spend a lot of time enacting and
exfoliating exactly the negative and vindictive and destructive and vengeful
and painful and bitter and dark processes and relationships that
his "better wisdom"---the unfallen Los--could exist as kind of implicit judge
for. One of the questions is, DOES Blake actually "purge" such negativity,
whether seen as "inner" or "societal"?

Ward,

I doubt that it's the forms so much (since I take it that everything
human is, in some sense, theoretical, if we can but see it as
such...even the anti-theory protestations of anti-intellectuals) as the
fact that Theory (big T) as a social ensemble at some point stopped
being about the desire to change the world (i.e., stopped seeing itself
in relation to social movements) and quickly descended in being about
ways to better the self (that next step increase, etc.).

Perhaps a history of the work of Stanley Aronowitz, the union organizer
(steelworkers, I believe) who has been one of the pooh-bahs behind
Social Text (or, perhaps, Sokal Text), one of the major influences on
Jameson and a good portion of the US left, might be illustrative.

How is it that The Project went from changing the world to changing
one's oil?

No, Chris, I didn't say that. I think I projected those poetics on to
Williams as a way of interpreting the quote you posted. And it's not,
I don't think, a question with Blake of purging anything, as if you
could "purify" this world. In Blake's cosmology, such an impulse itself
would be ulronic, no? Your impulse sounds very similar to Blake's,
though it seems to me he places more emphasis on understanding how
that "darkness" can be located in a cosmology that sustains
contention, the antithetical, as Jack Clarke called it.

        Altho' our Human Power can sustain the severe contentions
        of Friendship, our Sexual cannot, but flies into the Ulro.

On Februrary 15, 1997, Talking Leave Books Store, Just Buffalo, and
shuffaloff books will co-sponsor a book launch for John Clarke's _In the
Analogy_ (shuffaloff, 1997). John Clarke was a long time resident of
Buffalo where he taught at SUNY at Buffalo for 29 years. A jazz musician
and Blakean, Clarke, in association with Charles Olson, John Weiners,
and Harvey Brown, was an editor of the _Niagara Frontier Review_, and with
Fred Wah, George Butterick, and Albert Glover of _The Magazine of
Further Studies_.
        In 1980 Clarke delivered the Lectures in Poetics at the New
College of California which became _From Feathers to Iron: A Concourse of
World Poetics_ (Tombouctou, 1987). During the 1980's Clarke performed
"Skald Song" with bassist/percussionist Charles Keil, also of Buffalo.
In 1989, he was named Ohio Poet by the Ohioana Library Association, and
in 1991 he received the prestigious Artist's Fellowship in Poetry from
the New York Foundation for the Arts. From 1989 until his death in 1992
he edited _intent.:letter of talk, thinking, and document_.
        _In the Analogy_ is the culmination of Clarke's life-work in poetry.
The first volume was published by shuffaloff in 1991. The current
edition includes all the poems from that book as well as an additional 5
complete books and part of a sixth. A ravishing translation of the
sonnet into an american language modulated by an epic impulse, _In the
Analogy_ astonishes with the range of its thinking and reference. This is
John Clarke's final work, not finishing, though it never for a moment
forgets that fact, but finally just stopped in its tracks. As Robin
Blaser has written: "Here we are just plain after-the-modern (to use
Olson's clear recognition and step around the pile-up of postisms) and
at work. . . . A really, really good book!"
        The book launch, to be held at Talking Leaves Book Store at 7:30
PM, will include an open reading. Jack's friends and students are
encouraged to read from his work, or to read work that he inspired.
        For more information, contact Michael Boughn at shuffaloff

Margaret Avison is a Canadian poet who appeared in Cid Corman's 'original'
_Origin_ as well as canadian mags. & has published a number of books in
Canada, although one, _The Dumbfounding_, was published by Norton in 1966.
That quote is from "New Year's Poem," which first appeared in _Winter Sun_
(U of Toronto, 1960; McClelland & Stewart, [w/ _The Dumbfounding_] 1982). A
deeply Christian poet, she is also one of our finest. George, who has

>With luck this means there must continue to be a multiplicity of theories,
>rather than just one for any post-poetries.
-- Herb Levy writes, echoing Rod Smith, and also for me Charles Alexander's
recent post on the "visual"...
        In the interest of emphasizing this multiplicity, but even more
multiplicity of histories, I want to give a very different account of an
interest in visual poetry and sound poetry from the 70s on than that of Ron
Silliman's. Not only do I feel my work intimately connected to these
projects, but one of the things Bruce Andrews and I wanted to do with
L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E (the magazine) was to incorporate discussions of visual and
sound work (domestic and foreign) into the discussion of the poetry to which
we were committed, but which was rarely discussed in this context, and vice
versa. Indeed, this was, what we thought anyway, a difference between our
approach and that of others, who also placed their work in the contextof the
New American Poetry, and it was also a difference (at least in emphasis)
with many of the New American poets themselves.
        The resisitance to visual and sound work is very strong in the
poetry precincts in which I travel, indeed for many of my favorite writers
such concerns are quite alien. I don't criticize this partialness, it seems
to me that poets, and other artists, are necessarily partial if they are to
focus on what they can or need or want to do (poetry is all about
resistance, a point too often elided in disucussions like this). However,
for others of us, the concerns of visual poets, book artists, and sound
poets were a concrete part of what we imagined we could do as poets, and
also what we did. Certainly this was and remains the case (though each case
is a different story) for Nick Piombino, Susan Howe, Bruce Andrews, Steve
McCaffery, Ray DiPalma, Tina Darragh, Joan Retallack, Hannah Weiner, cris
cheek, Johanna Drucker (one of whose typographically extravagant books I
reviewed in the first issue of L=), and myself (to mention a few obvious
folks); it is why Jackson Mac Low (among others) was such a crucial figure,
and still is, for many of us (some of us) (me), not to mention why the
anthologies of Jerome Rothenberg, which link up these often separated
strands of the visual/verbal/vocal (to use a phrase of Bob Cobbing's) have
been so significant. (Jerry made this relevant comment on this list on Oct.
29, 1995: "Concerning Jim Rosenberg's digression regarding concrete poets &
Black Mountain poets, etc., let me just say that it doesn't correspond at
all to my memory of all of that.  What I recall is a relative indifference
back & forth, with as much occasional hostility on one side as on the other
& several notable crossovers.")
         I've always felt more affinity with many book artists and "visual"
poetry than with most "contemporary" poetry; that probably goes without
saying; then again the point probably does need to be made because the genre
of poetry often tends to push up against, but resist, the upper limit of
visuality and the lower limit of sonicality. Of course, Ron's ongoing
engagement with the borders of "prose" leads into other, also fruitful,
conjuncitons, syntheses, &c, one in which the visual marking often
associated with poetry seem to disappear (they don't of course: they are
only reconfigured, as Ron would be the first to note). (I recommend looking
at Ron's very early _Mohawk_ to see another side of his visual interests.)
        It also seems to me that among the younger poets ("younger than me")
whose work I read with the greatest engagement, this interest in the visual
and acoustic domains in, about, around, and through poetry -- that in any
case cannot ever be split off from poetry --  is quite strong.  Certainly in
Buffalo. Crucial, now (now is never "post" except in a secondary sense), in
this respect (and so this is brings me to an directly respond to the
question that is also floating around on the list) is poetry on the web, in
which the visual dimensions are even more visible (they are always
inescapable), for example choices of color, font and background, which many
more writers are now confronted than in the past --  if not in HTML, then on
their computers.

I've been slowly catching up with the last month's posts, so will give
something of a scattered response to several issues that have come up, in
this and separate post.

I. Riding Panel at the MLA
Lisa Samuels, who it seems to me is the person doing the most interesting
work on Riding these days, organized a panel on Riding's Prose. She gave an
excellent "report" on Anarchy Is Not Enough, one of Riding's best, and
certainly most bouyant, works. She was so convincing that she may have
gotten a publisher to put the book back in print.  Barrett Watten and I were
the other speakers.

Rod Smith wrote to the list:
>Still, it would be a mistake to consider the "young" unengaged with issues=
 of
>poetics-- Mr. Bernstein's phrase in his Riding paper "for what poets do is
>turn" provides something of a description for what I see happening in much
>contemporary writing.

I thought that I would clip and send the paragraph from which Rod quoted
from "Riding's Reason", my introduction to (Riding) Jackson's and Schulyer
Jackson's Rational Meaning: Toward a New Foundation for Words, which will be
published by University of Virginia Press this Spring. Certainly the
paragraph brings up several threads of the past month:

*****
        After the publication of her Collected Poems in 1938 and two
non-poetry books the following year, Riding published almost nothing for
thirty years.  In 1970, her Selected Poems: In Five Sets was published under
the name Laura (Riding) Jackson.  In the preface she explained her
renunciation of poetry, saying that the craft of poetry distorted the
natural properties of words and that the sensuosity of words blocked what
she called, in her poem "Come, Words, Away", the soundless telling of truth
that is in language itself.  She puts it this way in "The Wind, The Clock,
The We":=20

        At last we can make sense, you and I,
        You lone survivors on paper,
        The wind's boldness and the clock's care
        Become a voiceless language,
        And I the story hushed in it =97
        Is more to say of me?
        Do I say more than self-choked falsity
        Can repeat word for word after me,
        The script not altered by a breath
        Of perhaps meaning otherwise? =20
                =20
The thirty-year pause in this life of writing, at least as reflected through
a cessation of publishing, echoes the gap between George Oppen's Discrete
Series (1934) and The Materials (1962).  Oppen, just seven years younger
than Riding, perhaps had not found a way to reconcile his left political
commitment with his practice of poetry.  But he did return to poetry, and
with an epigraph that he could share with Riding: "They fed their hearts on
fantasies / And their hearts have become savage."  Riding, whose politics
moved in the opposite direction from Oppen's, never returned to poetry,
where meaning is always "otherwise" than intended, instead turning (for what
poets do is turn) toward a way of meaning otherwise, that is not toward
poetry but to a voiceless telling.   The long poetic lacuna of these two
"non-Jewish Jews" implicitly acknowledges the question later stated most
famously by Theodor Adorno: can lyric poetry be written after =97 much less
during =97 the systematic extermination of the European Jews?  As far as I
know, Laura (Riding) Jackson does not explicitly address this issue, but
what she does say of 1938 and 1939 is significant: "Human sense of the human
stood at last poised at the edge of an unignorable question about the
human."   Within this historical context, perhaps Oppen's commitment to a
clarity and honesty ("that truthfulness / that illumines speech" ) that is
expressible only though a highly delimited diction can be linked to (Riding)
Jackson's recurrent concern for "right use" and "good sense" and frequent
censure of what she experienced as linguistic violation.  For the unnameable
catastrophe of these years, with its rationalized but irrational logic of
extermination, engendered a crisis of and for expression in which the abuse
of language became inextricably identified with the abuse of the human.

******

To finally just append a response to Maria Damon. Yes I think Hannah Weiner
can be understood as creating an "anti-lyric subjectivity", if not to say
simply rejecting the lyric, as it has been known and practiced. I think also
her use of a visualized prose, and moreover the enormous range of
prose-format poems of the past thirty years, is also relevant in this=
 regard.

After ten years of silence, it relaunched as a quarterly, opening its pages
to Chinese writers throughout the world. Its reputation continues to grow,

Subject:      Re: Collapse of theory (a theory of collapse)

Ron,

On a social level I'm sure you're right.  I suppose the larger question, and you
seem to imply it in your account of things, is about how to respond.  I wish I
knew how to respond on a social/political level, but I really can't say that I
do.

What I was trying to get at in my previous post was a need to respond (I
probably should have been more specific) to what are, for me, problems in form.
Despite the social role of theory I think there are specific and practical
problems that can be addressed locally.  I think we can identify things today
which resist theory simply because the forms of theory we have don't accommodate
them well.

Most theory on electronic writing that I've read, for example, I haven't found
very useful.  It's not that I've disagreed with it, it's just that I found that
the discursive form of it did not correspond very well with what was being
theorized.  A theory of electronic writing, and a lot of other things film,
video, dance, etc., it seems to me, need demonstration as much as they need
explanation.  In the standard forms of theory demonstration is almost always
left out.

I think it's interesting that, theory, theoria, was not always even a form of
writing.  The word was used originally for a group of people, sent by a state,
to confirm or witness events and perform rites.  Only gradually was it taken up
into writing as a means of accounting, more generally, for phenomena that were
not present.

So, in thinking about the form of theory, as first moving from a performative
structure to a discursive one, it seems to me we could wonder about whether
theory were capable of other transmutations.  I guess I'm wondering if we could
work out a presentational/demonstrative form for it and begin to develop a
different kind of thinking.

Thanks, Charles Bernstein, for the note on the visual. I had associated an
intense interest in visual & sound work with L= magazine, and it had seemed
like there is little such interest in later work associated with lang
poetry. But certainly not "no" interest. And you remind me that, for many of
the younger poets I know, there remains a commitment to such work. I have
admired your own collaborations with Susan Bee. I just received word of a
new book from Granary Books, Little Orphan Anagram, by Susan with Poems by
you. Could you tell us anything about this work, particularly as, being a
Granary Book, I imagine it's in an edition of such size & price that most of
us on this list will not end up seeing a copy. Although perhaps not, as I
know Granary has expanded its publishing activities in several ways,
including recent publication of some of Johanna Drucker's earlier limited
edition work in editions which should make that work more accessible.

And just received here is Bruce Andrews's Ex Why Zee, which is primarily
written texts of performance and collaborative works from the early '80's to
the present. At first glance it looks marvelous, but I just received it a
couple of days ago and haven't sat down and read the whole yet.

Besides those you mention, Charles, I have always felt that Armand
Schwerner's mix of visual systems and his idiosyncratic joining of visual
poetry, sound poetry, dance notation, and more, was and is important to a
number of writers. Also, the work of Dick Higgins & Something Else Press,
and through it, a link to the work of Fluxus, always an energetic
involvement of language with much else in the many worlds of art, not only
visual and musical, but performative and more. Perhaps it is this
willingness to expand the boundaries of language-based art (beyond what is
commonly perceived as language) that I don't sense quite as much right now,
although you are absolutely right to point out that a very great deal of
work is going on in many computer-based and computer-accessed practices.

Responses to three posts:

Chris,

The "problem" of dating the collapse of the Left in the US (let alone
elsewhere) is a little like determining which pre-hominid fossil gets
to be called "human," australopithecus or whatever. Was it 1968, when
the revolution did not happen here or elsewhere (and some of those
elsewheres, such as Paris, Prague and Mexico City, had much more
intense experiences that year than the did the US) and we got Nixon
instead, our own version of Franco. Was it 1981, when Reagan took over
(Modern Times Books in SF noted that leninist texts, include Lenin,
Marx, Mao, etc, stopped selling almost overnight the minute Reagan was
elected--that was 15 years ago)? 1989, with the fall of the Wall,
Tienanmen and collapse of the Soviet State? Or, or, or?

[[Certainly the power of a film like the late Jean Eustache's *The
Mother and the Whore* or Tanner's *Jonah who will be 25 in the Year
2000* {translated into English by M. Palmer} have much to do with that
sense of 1968 as a failed moment in history.]]

I don't expect poets to solve the problems of society as a precondition
for writing, but they are (in their own often transformed ways) some of
the useful commentators into the human condition we can ever hope to
have.

On the decline of the "french thing" in US poetry, I don't know. I will
note that Lisa Jarnot and Jennifer Moxley wrote two of the best books
of 1996 (and if we wanted to start talking about what is going on NOW
in US poetry, those books might be a good place to begin).

Charles,

I appreciate your note and P.O.V. The list (see below) was, in fact,
almost exactly the reason for my decision to divide In the American
Tree into sections by coast. [Tho I recognize that it is, in fact, more
complicated than that, what with Steve and cris (whom I'd only met once
back then and had not read).] One thought to keep in mind is that
during the 1970s and early '80s, the artists in SF who were most
visible around venues that one also found poets tended to be Terry Fox,
Tom Marioni, Jill Scott, Doug Hall, etc. Which is to say *performance*
artists. The original impulse that led to the creation of New Langton
Arts (and before it 80 Langton Street) was a series of performances,
one a night for a month or so, on Bluxome Street, sponsored by someone
around one of the galleries who was, literally, responding to their
need to get these performances away from their spaces with their
tendency to cause stains on the carpets. 80 Langton was a shared
storage facility used by members of the SF Art Dealers Association. So
that, with a few exceptions (Francie Shaw being the most visible in
those days), the impact of the visual arts scene was most clearly
present in the work, say, of Steve Benson and Abigail Child. By the
time that Barrett had started writing for Art Week, things had of
course changed radically.


"Certainly this was and remains the case (though each case
>is a different story) for Nick Piombino, Susan Howe, Bruce Andrews,
Steve McCaffery, Ray DiPalma, Tina Darragh, Joan Retallack, Hannah
Weiner, cris cheek, Johanna Drucker (one of whose typographically
extravagant books I reviewed in the first issue of L=), and myself (to
mention a few obvious folks); it is why Jackson Mac Low (among others)
was such a crucial figure, and still is, for many of us (some of us)
(me), not to mention why the anthologies of Jerome Rothenberg, which
link up these often separated strands of the visual/verbal/vocal (to
use a phrase of Bob Cobbing's) have been so significant."

Charles Bernstein
----------------------------------------------------------------
Ward,

I'm not certain that I buy the thesis that certain topics tend to be
anti-theoretical (or that their forms tend not to lend themselves to
that second order discourse). I do agree on the lack of usefulness in
"electronic writing." I can't say that hypertext has improved much
since it was invented by William Blake. I am aware of the origins of
the term, its root in Theors as those emissaries were called.

I think the more crucial question is the series of specifically
professional moves that were made in, in particular, the 80s, first to
a theory that saw itself as more interesting than anything on which it
might comment (viz October, a mag that could stand for the Fall of
Theory, or at least the Autumn), even as it never questioned its own
phenomenon of Privileged Topics, Texts and Epochs. Lentriccia's move
seems like an almost logical "next step" in light of that history --
that was a move someone was going to make and the only interesting
question is why him instead of Fish or Greenblatt or Clifford, etc.

It would be useful to take major texts by US theoretical writers, maybe
in 5 year increments, and ask "what was the social project into which
this writing saw itself fitting"?

In the social sciences (as distinct from the "human" ones), in the
1960s the major mag (almost the only seriously theoretical one) was
Studies on the Left, edited by students of William Appleman Williams
largely in Wisconsin. That mag broke up (at virtually the same moment
that SDS split over this same question) over the question of whether
the purpose of historical and sociological discourse was to pave the
way for a revolutionary political party. The subsequent mags started by
its editors (Jimmy Weinstein at Socialist Review, Genovese at Marxist
Perspectives) divided precisely on that line. Interesting to see that
Genovese is now an active rightwinger (this is NO SURPRISE) and that
Weinstein, who still talks a progressive line, has been one of the bete
noirs of the Writers Union for all of the unpaid work at the heart of
In These Times.


>What I was trying to get at in my previous post was a need to respond
(I probably should have been more specific) to what are, for me,
problems in form. Despite the social role of theory I think there are
specific and practical problems that can be addressed locally.  I think
we can identify things today which resist theory simply because the
forms of theory we have don't accommodate them well.
>
>Most theory on electronic writing that I've read, for example, I
haven't found very useful.  It's not that I've disagreed with it, it's
just that I found that the discursive form of it did not correspond
very well with what was being theorized.  A theory of electronic
writing, and a lot of other things film, video, dance, etc., it seems
to me, need demonstration as much as they need explanation.  In the
standard forms of theory demonstration is almost always left out.
>
>I think it's interesting that, theory, theoria, was not always even a
form of writing.  The word was used originally for a group of people,
sent by a state, to confirm or witness events and perform rites.  Only
gradually was it taken up into writing as a means of accounting, more
generally, for phenomena that were not present.
>
>So, in thinking about the form of theory, as first moving from a
performative structure to a discursive one, it seems to me we could
wonder about whether theory were capable of other transmutations.  I
guess I'm wondering if we could work out a presentational/demonstrative
form for it and begin to develop a different kind of thinking.

Steve Shoemaker - I guess I had it coming, trying to put out a "school"
of poetry based on a metaphysics - but I was actually promoting something
very close to what you described in your interesting post.  I wouldn't
call a Peircean pragmatist realism exactly "mystical".  There are in
the Russian metarealists I referred to, some roots in Russian Symbolism
& the symbolist movement in general, which could certainly be called
"mystical" in the thirst for "another world", & devaluation of both
ordinary reference functions of language & the "ordinary" world itself.
But what I actually "called" for was a new poetry parallel to the border
(defined, theoretically, by M. Epstein) between the "metarealists" (with
their concern for poetic tradition & interest in "multidimensional"
reality) & the "new acmeists" (with a focus on the "ordinary" world
and the poem as a free entity functioning in this "present"
world).

To try to be brief, I think there are connections between the realism
in Peirce (the physical & "intellectual" worlds are
BOTH real, outside text & our formulations about them) & the direction
you outlined.  Look for the Providence School's new textbook,
_Novum Organum Bubbleheadicum_, which will codify all the new
extra-generational tendencies.  (Univ. of Left Overbie Press, 1999).

Regarding Rod's interesting post - maybe the reason "the young" have not
the same theoretical meta-explanations for themselves is that it
takes a generation to absorb what's gone before AS POETRY (rather
than as event, revolution, rumble).  The metanarrative is in the work
itself, as an absorption/re-turning/finding of what's been done.
(hence the "call ourselves Poets" call).  Beat, objectivist, Olson, NY,
New Am, are still producing effects for which the crystallizations
of theory are not yet ready.   See page 4443 in _Novum O.Bubbleheadicum_
for fuller treatment.  Later...- Prof. Iago Iamgodamn Dogma

"For example, in Karl Young's work (it's a very broad body of work, and these

rubbings of language from building surfaces (I'm thinking of some of his
screen-folds here, but of other works as well), giving a sense of the history of
the presentation of language, complicated by his work's presentation of works in
translation, thus involving a transference of language in both time (the
historical dimension) and space (one culture to another). This can get quite
complex and is, I think, very much "linguistic." And in Karl Kempton's work,
much of which presents letters structured to make patterns/pictures, often the
choice of letters quite consciously concerns the aural, visual, and historical
properties of those letter forms."

I agree with you Charles.  I think a lot of this work offers a very different
kind of "history of literature."  Karl Kempton is probably one of the very few
who is able to maintain a link back to the pattern poetry of the medieval period
and earlier.

Ok, Ron, but I'd have to guess that Duncan was more of an influence on Lisa
Jarnot's book than any recent French writer was. "Often I am permitted to
return to a salad bar..."

Come to mention it, judgment has been a thorny issue in my subculture
lately, and we're all bleeding from the sides. What could it possibly mean,
to write or to read without rushing to judgment? Have I been drowning in
prepared statement? I heard stories that there used to be a banner in St
Marks Church that read 'Prohibit sharply the rehearsed response.' Was that
the case, or were my interlocutors speaking allegorically.

Does Response (which was my favorite book of the year, and Tilt by Gillian
McCain was good, and Damon Krukowski's book was surprisingly good, and
Lisa's Sea Lyrics, and Moxley's Verses, Moriarty's Symmetry, Smith's
Theories, Ange Mlinko's Immediate Orgy and Audit, and who can forget The
Little Golden Book of Lesser New York School Poets, ed. anon -- tho really
it's readings right now that seem to be the locus of everybody's attention
and activity, in New York anyway -- the list of best poems read aloud in NY
in 96 would be different from the list of best books of poems -- the
under-published Kim Lyons gave a couple of amazing readings, John Godfrey
read twice, Rod Smith's reading at Poetry City may have topped his book..)
that was such a long parenthesis I'll start again -- does this newer mode,
which could be called 'response' (in sympathetic contrast with
'resistance'), which takes as its basis the effects of these disastrous
shifts of the world's mood -- I mean its economics -- household, yes? -- on
a particular person, a particular mind, or a few at a time, does that
really represent a shift of scale from that of 'new sentence' writing?
Couldn't it be seen as an _intensification_ of what was heretofore diffuse?


Couldn't judgment really be about registering molarity? (Henry -- do not
tell me that you've had all your moles registered since you were a lad.
Thank you.)

If you really are only talking about Lentricchia, Fish, Jameson, Ross, etc,
then all I can say is whoops! Whoops, and why are you talking about them.

Blame me, I voted for Anderson,

POETRY CATEGORY OF THE NATIONAL MAGAZINE AWARDS CANCELLED!!!!


        In my capacity as co-editor of Arc: Canada's National Poetry Maga-
zine, it has come to my attention that the National Magazine Awards
Foundation has cancelled the Poetry category of the National Magazine Awards.
I was preparing to enter the work of four contributors to Arc from the past
year, when I discovered that this category had been dropped. (By the way,
there is still a fiction category.)

        I called the National Magazine Awards Foundation's office on December
30, 1996, to find out why the poetry category was cancelled and was told that
the Foundation's board of directors, after much "discussion," decided to
cancel the Poetry category due to what they have chosen to perceive as
declining "interest"  in the category.  This was made "clear" to them by the
dwindling number of entries submitted by magazines from across Canada as well
as by private individuals (who may also enter their own work or the work of
other poets whose work has appeared in Canadian periodicals). This "difficult"
decision was apparently made with "much  regret" and was "not unanimous."

        Based on my discussions with the Foundation's office staff, it is not
clear to me that the Foundation has ever attempted to reverse the decline of
entries, which has apparently been worsening over the past ten years. As the
co-editor of Arc, I have never received any letters from the Foundation,
urging Arc to submit. I also very much doubt that other Canadian literary
magazines were ever similarly invited to submit entries. The Foundation also
implied to me that they felt the $50. fee per entry (ie. if Arc had been
submitting this year, we would have paid $200. to enter the work of four
contributors for consideration) was perhaps outside the reach of the modest
budgets of most literary magazines. I inferred from this comment (perhaps
incorrectly) that the fee could not be adjusted to accommodate the
straightened budgets of the literaries"  because fairness must be maintained
across categories and among equals. Ie. Canadian Geographic must be treated
as fairly as Arc, even though it is unlikely the two magazines would ever
compete in the same category.

        The Foundation also rationalized that there were many other poetry
prizes for which poets could conceivably be eligible. I pointed out that
there are few *national awards* for Canadian poets, especially ones where
poets are honoured on the same stage as peers among other writers of other
genres.

        I explained to the staff member to whom I was speaking (I am
embarrassed to say that I cannot remember her name), that the award is very
important to Canada's poets. It is highly regarded and considered to be a
true honour. It is an opportunity for poetry to be honoured on the same
stage alongside other kinds of writing. It is also important to the magazines
that published the nominated and winning poets because it helps them to
further develop their credibility, especially in the eyes of potential
contributors, subscribers, benefactors (ie. the granting agencies).

        Also, to exclude poetry from the National Magazine Awards further
marginalizes the genre and represents an insult from our peers whose support
we will increasingly need as the funding for the arts deteriorates in Canada.
If the Foundation wishes to appear indifferent to the state of the arts --
and the situation of poets in particular -- in Canada, it should be prepared
to sustain a very embarrassing and well deserved black-eye as result of the
cancellation of this category.

        Please call or write the National Magazine Awards Foundation to
express your disgust with their decision:

                National Magazine Awards Foundation
                109 Vanderhoof Avenue, Suite 207

                416-422-1358
                416-422-4762 (fax)

        Apparently, they have changed their minds in the past.  A while ago,
they re-instated the award for sports writing in response to opposition from
the sports writing community.  Part of your message to the Foundation should
also be to do a better job of promoting the submission process and deadlines
to the various communities that the awards serve.  It is all very well for
this Toronto-based, high-brow foundation to assume that the message is getting
out to magazines both on the periphery of the country and at the margins of
commercial publishing.  It has also struck me as very poor planning that
the awards submission deadline is usually within less than two weeks of
the Christmas holidays.  For commercial magazines that have paid staff, it
might be more reasonable for them to meet such a poorly timed deadline.
For magazines like Arc (and most literary periodicals) who are run by
volunteers, it is more difficult -- Arc is run in our "off-hours," ie.
outside our "regular" workdays in the "real" world.

        Happy New Year in these difficult times.

        Thanks for your interest.

Charles Alexander asks for some information on my new book with Susan Bee.
In some way it=92s most like the book we did with Charles and Chax Press=
 about
ten years ago called Fool=92s Gold, though it works with large page formats
and plays with the frame of the bound book more than that one, which has an

Here=92s what the prospectus for the book says:

LITTLE ORPHAN ANAGRAM by Susan Bee, with new poems by Charles Bernstein

Susan Bee has created a companion volume to her 1995 Granary Book, Talespin,
transforming the genre of the illustrated book with her brilliantly colored,
dizzylingly inventive, and poignant juxtapositions of new and found images.
In this fin-de-siecle mix of fractured nursery rhymes, distressed mottos,
riddles, and inscrutable sayings =96 Nonsense meets Folly on the road to
Imagination.

As Charles speculates, Little Orphan Anagram is a limited edition book:
there will be 35 copies and the 40 pages (20 spreads) of each book will be
hand-painted by Susan. (The process involves collages [with poems and
images] that are letterpress printed and then painted over.) For more
information you can contact Steve Clay at Granary: scaly@interport.com.
Steve will put some images of the book up at the Granary Website
(http://www2.granarybooks.com) and also there will probably be some
additional images put up at Kenny Goldsmith=92 visual poetry site
(http://www.ubuweb.com/vp) =96 though not until next month.  You can see=
 pages
from Susan=92s Talespin at both sites.

Meanwhile, for folks in NY Jan. 18, come to the opening:

Susan Bee: Recent Paintings and a New Granary Book
January 18 - February 28, 1997
Opening: Saturday, January 18, 5-7 pm
***Gallery Hours: Thurs.-Sat., 12-6 pm and by appt.***

Granary Books Gallery is pleased to announce a show of recent paintings and
a new Granary Book by Susan Bee. Bee's paintings are collaged, mixed media
works in oil and enamel paint that revolve around the figure as presented in
movie posters of the 1940s and 50s as well as in paper dolls, postcards, and
advertisements. These paintings involve narrative fragments in combination
with multiple layers of paint.  The collaged elements are embedded in
encrusted, paint saturated surfaces.  There is a tension between the
narrative significations of the images and the abstract, formal qualities of
the picture plane. In some of the paintings, the compositions involve
decorative, organic arabesques and floral motifs. The paintings play out
dramas and gender roles, psychic states, and visions.

Little Orphan Anagram will also be shown.=20

Sylvester Pollet asks about the Mina Loy work in the "Surrealistic Pillow"
show. I haven't seen this yet, but Susan tells me that there is one collage
by Loy in the show, and that it is certainly worth seeing. Also recommended
is the great New York Dada show at the Whitney, which has some great
Duchamps, Man Rays, Stettheimers, &c., plus a terrific small section of
visual/typographics poetry. While there is Man Ray's photo of Loy, and one
of the cases has a magazine open to a Loy poem, there are no visual works by
Loy in this show.

Ive just joined the list so Im not sure if there is more to this thread
then chiming in about visual/verbal lit.  Our press, Xexoxial Editions
has been publishing concrete, visual/verbal, collaborative, &xerolage
since 1980.  We carry the works of about 40 different poets from 15
different countries (including some folks I imagine that are on this
list).

Also, lets not forget Kamensky, the Russian zaum artist whose visual
works he chose to call ferro-concrete  40 years before the concrete
poetry movement even began.

But the other side of that is how strongly influenced people are by immediate
predecessors. When I say younger poets are "going back" to the generation of
the Allen anthology a lot of the ways of reading they're bringing with them
are from the generation that followed the Allen anthology. It couldn't be
otherwise. Luckily
& of course these ways of writing/reading are quite varied. Nevertheless I
think it interesting, even useful, to try & map these changes _when the
mapping is understood as contingent_ -- as leading into the work --  rather
than tacking or taxing it.  The sheer number of interesting possibilities for
writing now, in terms of form, influence, technology much less theoretical
approach seem to me to be -- well, one might want to celebrate if there
wasn't so much worthwhile to do. But then we do celebrate too.

Subject:      visual stuff

Just to add a couple of names to the discussion of visual poetics:
Some of Jed Rasula's first-power but neglected work
and, much earlier, Kenneth Patchen.

And actually what about the whole area of the "art book" which a
number of the original zaum "poets" moved in (Marjorie Perloff has
some great material on this in _The Futurist Moment_.)
What parameters do we use to decide what realm we put such "books" in?
Where does poetry stop and art begin?

Or are we really speaking of a seamless continuum that we too
easily split-up into expressive categories? For example, if we can
have music with "just words" as John Cage showed,
can we also have poetry "without words"? And what does it mean, and
what purposes are served when we begin to call things by certain
names? In
calligraphy (the refined practice of it) there is supposed to be, as
I can only barely understand it, a shimmering tension between
linguistic sign and pure form that creates a brand new thing. Can we
aspire toward something similar in spirit within the alphabet we
inhabit?

I ask these disjointed things knowing that there can only be
speculation and no answer in the end. But that's the idea, right?

For those of you in the Phoenix/Tempe area, the Scottsdale Center of the Arts
Poetry Series, now celebrating our 10th Season, is featuring a POETRY ARTWALK
on Wednesday, January 8th, at 8:00 p.m.  This is a FREE EVENT.  Five writers
have been commissioned to create original works in response to visual art on
display.

Works from the Chihuly "Baskets" and Desert Landscapes by Ed Mell have served
as the visual focal points for tomorrow's program.

Jeffrey Timmons (of this list), along with Meg Davis, Wanda Panduren, Rick
Naguchi, and Dorothy Lykes, have been commissioned to read their new works.

Hope to see any list members who live out this way!

Some people can certainly "read" paintings the way others read poetry.
(& maybe vice versa).
Iconography and emotion.  & on yr last question, the makers of medieval
illustrated books thought so (I saw the Lindisfarne Gospels
for the 1st time at British Museum last year).  - ~HG~

Dave Chirot and I have been talking about Robert Grenier's recent work
in very similar terms, right down to the unanswerable question(ing)
(though Grenier's calligraphy would seem to push the whole thing
toward the american, democratic rethinking of the aesthetic) (if not
toward a  reforming of penmenship programmes in the public schools!)

MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII

Re: Charles Berstein's comments on the Visual in Poetry, I have been
involved in a project for the last three years in Melbourne (Australia)
that works as an intersection between visual & textual languages.  It
began as a regualar artist-run gallery but importantly included writers
(poets, theorists, fiction writers) in all decision making & running of
the space.  Each exhibition of visual included at least two different
written texts in an attempt to create some kind of "intertextual space".
It never really quite worked out as hoped, mostly because the audience
were very much art world & so the written texts tended to be sidelined as
merely "catalogue essays".  Starting last year, I began inviting writers
to produce installations in the gallery in an attempt to shift the textual
further into the realm of visual art.  Some of these have been very
successful & overall the project has produced much collaborative work
between artists & writers (though now the boundaries are blurring).
Also, a friend of mine (an art theorist) is preparing a collaborative
installation with a visual artist  as part of a philosophy conference to
be held in Melbourne later this year.  I think this kind of shifting of
territories can help "deterritorialize" writing (or "poetry") while at
the same time losening up other disciplines such as visual art or philosophy.
Plus it also serves as a link that can bring different communities together.

Isn't it strange to think Pound was disturbed as recently as 80 years ago by
"the thought of what America would be like if the Classics had a wide
circulation?"  Poor Pound in his troubled sleep, dreaming of beautiful lilies
in the land of vulgar acorns. Did he think an ennobled civilization would come
from a populace with access to (and presumably reading) the Greeks and Romans?
And then this civilization would help transform the world into a better place
as HE imagined it? Or would it just be a nicer place to hang out?

Pound must have thought his contemporaries were reading crap. I suppose the
same could be said today.  (Does this mean I share Pound's vision? And would
that mean I have a future as a broadcaster in foreign land?  Perhaps I could
denounce a population for listening attentively to Jennings Rather Koppel
without first having read Ben Bagdikian.)

I agree that there is a need for discourse about poetry. I prefer not to call
it theory, not because it implies a sense of unity but because it implies
abstractions independent of particular things.  Can you equate discourse and
theory? Not in my dictionary. Calling for discourse today is wise but implying
that it may necessarily be an extension of recent theory, or a continuation of
"langpo taken as a (problematic) given" is ludicrous.

Commence discoursing.

what has, from the beginning, attracted me to language poetry, is, as i
thought and continue to think, here were some folks who were thinking...

however, i want to be sure to indicate just how presumptuous some of the
exchange hereabouts might appear in the face of other poetic realities (and
i'm not indicting or alleging or insinuating)... i mean, *my* posts too---i
fret over this on a daily basis, each time my pinkies tickle these keys...
there are lots and lots of (good and bad) poets for whom this list is a
non-entity, for whom any number of poetic assertions in these spaces means
absolutely zero...

in spite of this, and for my part, i *do* believe that this list, and
places like it, represent the single most important 'event' in poetry and
poetics in the past decade or so (even more important, as i see it and in
the long term, than the popular proliferation of slam scenes)... now i
didn't say "most worthy" or some such---i said "most important"... but the
significance of such an event (as this list) is that it further distances
the present moment from past moments in which one school -- language poetry
or any other -- could lay claim to defining, cavalierly, the present
moment...

which means that even my claim as to the significance of this list is
subject to a scrutiny that it would hitherto not enjoy...

now, nobody is being cavalier about things, i know... and it is true that a
small group of folks can exert an enormous influence in historical terms...
but again, a list such as this provides a way to check the motivations
(institutional and otherwise) behind such influence, or at least to
challenge same... with a *relative* chorus of voices that no other forum
"we" have at our disposal seems to tolerate, let alone facilitate...

in all, then:  i find mself understanding, yet remaining somewhat
uncomfortable with the ... proposal or provocation that some 'we' might
now, almost premeditatedly, arrive at a new place for poetry/poetic---by, i
assume, sheer force of will, insight, reach, what have you... a very
seductive suggestion, but far as i've been able to ascertain, "we" have
already arrived at a place (whether a measure of progress i cannot say)
where contingency is understood in its fullest sense, and where the
vagaries of history are permitted to play themselves out without our
imposing, say, a neoclassical grid over same...

for those who get off on the oracular:  as a poet, one can say, "we have
arrived here," but best to say it, as i see it---*here*, not over there
someplace (this is a liability that, in my more critical moments, i've
sweated interminably)...

the logicians among you will note the (democratic) paradox ... here---i
assert the intrinsic divisibility of a "place" in a peculiarly indivisible
way... so (if i may):  this place we're at, you and me and you and you and
..., would seem to be constructed upon an awareness of the tenuous nature
of conceptual foreclosures... the conflicts that will likely be played out
("negotiated") wrt poetry and poetics will likely be played out on a
day-to-day basis, as has pretty much always been the case... a list such as
this  foregrounds this actuality... which means that something new may well
emerge, "we" may find ourselves someplace different, but that all's we can
do is provide a ... climate conducive to same, to the enormous number of
variables at work in our work ...

all of which is not to say that a woman's or man's reach should not exceed
her or his grasp... but i just don't think the time is ripe for the muse to
descend, draw one's inspiration where one may...

if, on the other hand, the... proposal or provocation is that we come
together in a new or different way (for poets or writers, i mean) on the
basis of shared political commitments (read "values" if you wish), even if
we may find ourselves opposed in terms of our aesthetic commitments (read
"values" if you wish), why then i'm all for it, speaking as a utopian
(i.e., earthling)... by which i mean to suggest that the sorts of politics
represented by our aesthetic practices should perhaps be more loosely, or
more generously, constru(ct)ed than the politics we bring to other (public)
spheres (which assumes the active presence of at least TWO public
spheres)...

declining, i think, though not reclining//

best,

MLA, rather than in the pages of a major mag, it didn't catch much
attention nationally -- when asked by a befuddled audience member what he

i've been trying to work on this, not a "discourse" (at least i havn't called it
this in my mind) but a workable vocabulary and "angle" of analysis that responds
to poetries that are not easily recuperable as academic fetishes.  thus i
haven't really turned much of my attention to "language poetry" as such, but hav
e, as marjorie pointed out in lastyear's corn skirmishes, paid close attention
to some "language oriented" poetry and poets, such as spicer, stein, duncan and
most recently, hannah weiner.  this list has been central to my gathering
information about weiner, and other matters; at the same time, it hasn't been as
insightful about matters of popular and mass poetries, or folk poetry.  this i
attribute, perhaps erroneously, to the legacy of modernist aesthetic judgment
and the seeming necessity to exercise that judgment.  i was on a panel at the
recent "rethinking marxism" conference with amitava kumar and peter hitchcock,
both of whom read their own work in the context of a post-marxist analysis of
the role of poetry/rant/spoken word in creating useful oppositional
consciousness.  it felt good to be in that environment, where poetry is alive
but also socially contextualized --not, as reductive stereotypes of marxism or
cultural studies would have it, subordinated to the status of sociological
evidence, but enhanced in their liveliness by acknowledgment and invocation of
community reception and production.  yum yum.  it was cool.  my own offering
suffered from being undertheorized, and, as always when i invoke bob kaufman's
name, technical snafus: the video screen wouldnt work.  anyway, that's my 2
zence on poetic discourse. bests and happy new year, maria d

Actually, as Rod Smith and some others point out, there is already a fair
amount of critical work being done by a variety of writers working on the
variety of theories that might fall under the rubric "postlanguage"
poetries, or just plan Poetry with a capital G (never could spell). The
problem is not so much that this work does not exist but
that the forums for its appearance are few and far between. WITZ  and
POETIC BRIEFS have been much involved, as have some issues of CHAIN and
TEXTURE, and Ed Foster has also printed some articles with such concerns
in TALISMAN.

        So, again, what's at issue, really, is not so much the lack of
such work, but
the LACK OF A FORUM IN WHICH IT MIGHT APPEAR SO THAT MANY PEOPLE WILL KNOW
IT IS THERE. Indeed I want to pick up on some of the implications of Ron
Silliman's recent posts about capitalism, academics, and the
disappearance of almost all resources for poetry, and note that resources
and publishing venues
for innovative criticism of poetry by writers in the generation following
language poetry are simply not THERE, beyond the
ear-to-the-ground, practically nonexistent budgets of the
above publications (my apologies to Ed if Talisman is financially doing
well--none of the others are). It would be EASY, at this time, to put
together a book-length collection of critical essays regarding
"postlanguage" issues--what's missing is not the work, but a PUBLISHER
with the resources to make such a project happen.

        At this time, of course, we're not even CLOSE to having any
academic interest in this subject, beyond perhaps 3 or 4 individuals.
Would it be good if there was such interest? One
thing I noticed about the MLA is that the English profession is still
wrestling with the notion of whether language poetry EXISTS. It was
astonishing how dumbfounded a contemporary academic audience was at Joan
Retallack's excellent poetry reading--no one in the audience even DARED
ask her a question afterwards, except those of us who already know her.
I'll leave it to Alan Golding to say
whether I really did overhear a young academic challenging him, after
Golding's fine talk on Bob Perelman's work, to say what
language poets have done that hadn't already been done by Marianne
Moore--I like Moore's work, but somehow I don't think that's the point
here.

Mark, in all fairness to that audience, she read a poem after "Icarus
Ffffffalling"--I don't know the title, but it's from /Afterrimages/--in
which the printed pages are divided in half vertically, and syllables
from the top half are echoed in the bottom half. Given an audience that,
almost by definition, isn't as familiar with her work as it ought to be,
it seems natural that they'd have an easier time with that particular
piece if they were seeing it on the page. Despite! despite! despite the
fact that they ought to! etc.

Damn, I kinda feel like Rip Van Winkle out here in farm country. Like I
wake up from a long sleep & there's a new rumor that the next movement
is "post-language".  Such a hodgepodge group of hyper-idiomatic writers
& were genericizing our fine art by calling it "post-language"?

Actually the discussion about theory is interesting to me as we are in
the slow beginnings of getting our "school" off the ground, have led a
bunch of WORDBANG! workshops with all the various mottly assortment of
anarchists, grad students, eco-villagers, & lowlife that pull thru
Dreamtime Village.  Ive easily been able to get people exicted about the
creative act, about writing thru writing, about inventing new words, new
languages, sound & visual poetry but life here is anything but academic
or constructed. I coldnt interest but few in the theory, the criticism,
because quite simply for many of these folks, its talking about doing
something, rather than being participant in the process itself.  Life
here has a lot more to do with fixing windows & planting potatoes &
living the dream of the culture we have yet to imagine, thru simple
action & attention to the processes.

Something to keep in mind is that poetics (discourse,theory) not only
tries to parallel & augment what's going on, but it also travels in
a diametrically counter direction.  The working writer has so much
varied technique & subject matter to absorb & deal with that the result is
WICKEDLY idiosyncratic & personal.  Meanwhile the chat lists (print or
email) on various levels try to glean out what is done in common, what
is characteristic, what is hip - always a group or grouping phenomenon!!
Shucks, I ain't even gonna mention the... ZEITGEIST!!!  (ie. as many
in various contexts have pointed out, there are networks, & common
approaches, & shared experience which are prerogatives for anything -
see Jeff Hansen's essay in latest Witz on this - yet even within these
networks nobody's gonna be interested unless it's NEW in some way, some
new departure or crystallization.  Each poem is like a successful
equation or theorem...blahbiddy blah...) Anyway, whatever pre- or
post- (come to think of it, these terms are really tied to a linear
concept of time which may not be accurate) -theories are a-growing,
they have to be built on a sense of poetry which opens up to what
the individual artist is doing IN DEPTH. - Henry Gould

perhaps this intriguing discourse has room for a slight piece of historical
perspective. (I've just read Daniel Bouchard's latest posting, but i'm sure
other postings inform my desire to respond here).

The poetics & poetry of The New American Poetry appeared to some of us to
lead inevitably to NOT writing about one's practice. Only the poem cd be
the ground, and if there were critical points to be made, let them be made
within, and as, the poem."Writing about" was a secondary, and therefore
dispensible, practice.
This is certainly why I (who enjoyed writing criticism) dispensed with it
for some years. I think it's also the case that Clark Coolidge and Michaels
Palmer and Davidson abstained, a;lthough they might have granted interviews
as time went by. I think i recall arriving at sd conclusions on my own but
rehearsing them with m palmer early on. Later, there came to be a term
(mfgd at New College?), "analytic lyric," which to my mind (altho an ugly
phrase) cd be applied to my practice from the word Go, and to that of the
others named above, plus many more besides.

The critique provided by L=A=N=Gpoets starting up in the early & middle 70s
i felt (for the reasons given above) was mistaken. But coming to admire (at
first, certainly, in the sense of "wonder at") their poetry, and getting to
know them as persons, I began therefore to assimilate what they had to say
"about". I saw that (a) there work was sufficiently different to warrant
such "aboutness" and (b), more importantly, that they had registered this:
if you dont describe yourself, other, alien beings will do it for you. Once
this penetrated at least my thick skull, with a sigh of "its dirty work,
but..." I wrote some things that werent poems. Clark and M Palmer gave many
more interviews. M Davidson  wrote brilliantly about other poets in ways
that also helped define for us what he's at in his poetry.

In the present, i find i'm much taken with (well, it's tout neuf to me)
this listwriting. no doubt there will be those capable of abstracting

Thanks for a great post, David. It helped to put things in perspective for
me.

My only other comment is: I am wearing a dark blue t-shirt, a blue corduroy
button down shirt (with button down collar) and  which the tag advertised as
"teal": a color I'd always thought of as more substantially green though my
wife assures me I am wrong about this. Dark blue Lee's jeans, very warm
socks, and brown Merrill hiking boots which, let us be frank, are "da bomb,"
and of necessity feature laces.

I certainly find your project of great interest, but have to report, from a
strictly New York point of view, that there is an unfortunately strong
barrier between writers who foreground the visual dimension of their work
and visual artists using verbal language in their work.  The crossover
points are artificially narrow: not that the folks coming out a poetry
context aren't engaged with the visual artists who use words, but that the
"art world" tends to ignore the "poetry" in its representation of this whole
field of activity, focussing almost exclusively on figures whose
base-of-operation is the art world. I would love to see a discussion of
Lawrence Weiner linked to a discussion of Robert Grenier, but if that were
to happen I bet it would be someone on this list who would write it and
another on this list who would publish it. That's all well and good. But
interesting to note lines where lines exist.
        (I realize that this is something that Wystan Curnow and Marjorie
Perloff have both written about and worked to change; and I think also of
Mary Ann Caws's lecture on Ian Hamilton Finlay and Tom Phillips at the MLA,
both of whom are counter-examples of cross-over figures. Also Susan Bee and
Mira Schor's special issue of New Observations, "Ripple Effects: Painting
and Language", about about which I recently posted an announcement.)
        Thanks, Mike, for mentioning Grenier, someone whose work is often on
my mind. I should have added him to the list I made in response to Ron
Silliman's post on the visual in language, although, speaking of the 70s, I
would have been thinking of Sentences, his radical refusal of the bound book
in favor of a Chinese box containing texts printed on large-format index
cards; or possibly his instance on nonproportional space type, as in A Day
at the Beach (an insistence that echoes Duncan's). However, in recent years,
his remarkable series of color handwritten poems have fundamentally
challenged the stability of the alphabetic code, bringing the page as field
of verbal investigation closer to, or overlapping with, drawing: a sort of
holographic attention similar to Susan Howe's reading/viewing of Dickinson's
mss.
        By the way, my list in my post was not a comprehensive list of poets
doing "visual" work but a specific response to comments of Ron. In any case,
I was glad to hear from Miekal And as his and Liz Was's work is quite
relevant: many wonderful books etc. But I am sure they, and others like Karl
Kempton, could well report something within "poetry" that I am speaking
about within the "art world", and this was Charles Alexander's point I
believe: poets primarily identified as visual poets publish and exchange
work in relatively separate networks than poets doing work close to that but
not primarily identified with the "visual". However, here there are MANY
crossover points, such as And and Was's Xexoxial and Charles Alexander's own
Chax. But often the projects are considered quite separate, even if parallel.

But surely, of the many things Pound wrote that would make this point, this
is an odd poem to choose.  It's one of  Pound's most sarcastic poems. As the
note in Personae frames it -- The "learned judge" in a censorship case says
he would allow an obscene reference in the classics that he would not allow
in popular reading, since the readers of the classics are "comparatively
limited [in] number" and I think by implication less likely to suffer the
ill effects of such images and representations. And Pound's poem in the
reply to that ... saying in effect that  if that classics had a wild
circulation they arouse the populace to a sexual high, not heighten their
sensibilities (though I woulnd't necessarily won't to separate those two).

Dear Charles--thanks for the paragraph quote from your intro.
which I am looking forward to almost as much as the Riding book. Since I am
impatient to dialogue, however, I will risk "wrenching" the paragraph you
quote out of context to ask some questions....
     The idea of historicizing "The Wind, The Clock...." is
     fascinating. Her address to the "lone survivors on paper"
     does seem to suggest a kind of WASTELAND as a backdrop.
     And she did write about how she had turned to poetry
     as a kind of shelter.  Such a reading certainly avoids the pitfalls
     of "self-choked falsity" or a kind of reading that would
     deign to be dragged down into the kind of relationship with
     a certain kind of reader the poem seems to posit as well
     as criticize, one who would see "self-choked falsity"
     as an imagined reader-as-follower, or even a flattering
     (conjuring) of the critic who wants to be flagellated.
     From one perspective, this could be seen as a disclaimer
     of "personal responsibility":
                (we all gather around NOTHING.
                 NOTHING is what keeps us together.
                 I am telling you I am telling you nothing.
                 Therefore this "nothing" you may tell me I tell you
                 may also be history, or may make you wish to
                 TURN to hisotry, where the answers, my friend,
                  are blowing in the wind no less than here--
                  no matter how hard "I the story" may try to
                  become history)
       I.e. You seem to read her as saying "the story" is "history"

Now the Oppen connection (which McGann tried to establish
 as well) is also interesting......
         Riding's politics moved in an opposite direction as
          Oppen? In what sense do you mean this? There's an
          implication that Oppen's leftism and his return to
          poetry are related, while Riding's attempt to critique
          certain aspects of poetry from a seemingly genreless
          perspective may invoke a kind of "rightism?"
          Are you implying that Riding's "voiceless telling"
          does away with "poetic turning?"
----------
          Back to the question of the HISTORICAL CONTEXT
          (the HOLOCAUST, etc.)....

          Has the historical context changed?
          Against the backdrop of the unameable atrocities
          of today. If the poet is to think globally
          and see (if not imagine) the human forces that
           seem to move history more than are moved by history
           and if we assume that history means POWER
            and carries an authority poetry doesn't
             and that poetry may wish to claim
             but can only do so by killing
             for history is a club more easily admitted to
              by killing (of course, when a poet says "kill"
              the poet may mean kill history and its hierarchies--
               chief among these the hierarchy over poetry....
            the way it lies like poetry, or only speaks the truth
            when disguised as poetry (or a dictionary for that
            matter).
           Then there's the kind of poetry that "contains history",
           I mean history as history, as if to find the HUMAN there
           Today, of course, there are more inclusive notions of
           history in circulation...but are they wide enough to
            contain poetry without threatening their status as
             history?
          Or there is literary history....
            (sylvia Playth is, in many interpretive circles,
             criticized for her reduction of the horror of Nazi
              Germany to a Freudian "family romance"
               while others are said to be "in denial" about
                the "personal as the political"
               from a certain persepctive, history becomes a
               friendlier context, or habitation....
               a way to make use of one's hell
             (Why bother, as Perelman wrote, except already
               bothered).....
              There is a crack in the world (Waldman), not just
               in me. The historical world. We are no longer to
               be duped by the possibility that one can actually
               solve one's problems (Hence the oppen quote about
               fantasies and savagery), or become an
               "integrated personality"
             (FREUD being the OPIATE of the "middle classes"
              --or of the proletariat basking in their own fat
                of linguistic, conceptual confusion that mistakes
                themselves for the "middle class"--another example
                of doublespeak that attests for the need for
                Riding's dictionary)....
              A book that purports to be about "the mind" or
              "language" or "the possible" may "really" be about
               the historical wall the author bangs her head up
                against----or the historical wall poetry had this
                "nasty habit" of helping you forget to bang your
                head against. Remember it. Fight it.
                But don't fight fighting,
                Or don't beg begging
                Lest history hush you home to silence,
                considering what kind of hearing you'll get.
                (this is not "me" speaking)
                But things change.
                There USED TO be a left (as Ron reminds us).
                 Now there isn't.
                 Hope used to be "realistic."
                 Yet nothing is realistic until real
                 and nothing is real until history says it is(by killing it).
    There are many contexts. Many HISTORICAL contexts, even if we choose to
operate linguistically within the workroom (or play pen) of history,

Subject:      Jean Eustache

Tom,

I wish that I did. Eustache, who was one of Godard's and Truffaut's
assistant directors for much of his career, died in his early 40s from
cancer, so didn't build up a body of work that ever got marketed as
such. I know that he made at least one other feature, although I never
got to see it. But maybe somebody has gathered films starring
Jean-Pierre Leaud (sp?).

There are a couple of film catalog type places around (one out of
Chicago if I recall). In fact, didn't you have one lying around your
house in Delaware last fall? I think that Jesse spilled some juice on
it.

Both Siskal and Ebert have web sites. Maybe one of them has tips on how
to find hard-to-get films. I would sort of expect that.

I must have seen that film 3 times, maybe 5. The scene in which the
nurse runs off and J-P follows her and the 3rd woman lies on the
mattress on the floor and just listens to a long Piaf number on the
record player all the way through was a great lesson to me that I've
carried over in my poetry (or tried to), about how art can modulate
time and how one feature of great art is to s l o w  i t  d o w n.

The first time I saw that film I identified with the J-P character
totally. The last time, I thought he was an insufferable, narcissistic
pig.

I asked Eustache once why the flat owned by the woman who ran the
boutique was so devoid of adornment on its walls. It was the one
feature in that film that made it seem "unBerkeley," if you know what I
mean. He replied that they didn't have money even for posters.

Mark Wallace's concerns about lack of publishing venues for experimental
poetry are valid, but I am wondering if the internet could offer plausible
solutions to this problem. Marking up text and posting it is not difficult
or terribly time consuming, and those of us who have access to academic
sites can develop web pages extremely inexpensively.

I note that no women have offered up their clothing on this thread. I'm
wearing purple leggings, a flannel night shirt and a red zip-up sweatshirt
(maybe this is why the women aren't talking!)

I haven't wanted to answer because what I've been wearing is such a
cliche, particularly today: black turtleneck, baggy black jeans, black
Doc Martens. I mean, it's just too, too.

Seems like the lack or no of publishing venues, like the issue of teaching
poetry in degree programs, are symptoms or effects of more general things,
like, the question of status or cultural hegemony - who gets invited to
the canon balls; or another one, the place of poetry in this culture in
general; or another one, related to the first - what is good poetry?

Subject:      "what they ought to"
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII

        Hi Gwyn McVay:

        Everyone here in D.C. is looking forward to your reading at
Ruthless Grip Art Project next month (February 8, 7:30 p.m., along with
British poet and visual artist John Havelda--consider this an "official"
announcement).

        Your response to my post yesterday is intriguing--I'm particularly
interested in what lurks (as you well know) inside such terms as "an
audience who wasn't as familiar with Joan Retallack's work though they
ought
to be." The issue it raises for me is why exactly they aren't familiar.
The most generous reading--and the one you're perhaps implying to some
extent--is that for some reason or other, the individuals gathered for
Joan Retallack's reading (excepting some members of the company) just had
not been familiar with it before, and were they to be familiar with it,
they would of course embrace it and be interested, because it is, clearly,
incredible poetry.

        A more skeptical reading might see, however, a variety
of political (on the literary level) reasons for the fact that Joan
Retallack's work approaches being unknown (although that is now
changing!), whereas Carolyn Forche, who
read with her, continues to be one of the most read and well-known poets
in the U.S. I'm not interested here in taking up an
evaluation of Carolyn's work; some people in what might be termed "avant
garde" contexts don't like her poetry at all, others do, and I
myself have been impressed with her intellectual, poetic, and political
"outreach" in various contexts. But the fact remains that economic,
academic and other kinds of resources for poetry are often determined by
what Charles Bernstein has called "official verse culture"--a culture
that, however varied, tends to promote some types of poetry at the expense
of others. Thus, a more skeptical reading might suggest that an audience
gathered at MLA would in great measure not know Joan Retallack's poetry
because mainstream poetry presses would for the most part simply not
publish Joan's work. Is that situation changing, with her recent books
appearing from Wesleyan, etc? Perhaps, and all to the good if it is.

My own sense might be that the truth of the matter lies, in particular
cases, somewhat between these more "generous" and "skeptical" poles. Some
of the people present at that reading may come to a new appreciation of
Joan's work, having been exposed to it. Others may continue to feel that
it's not useful work because it doesn't express her emotions directly,
talk about personal experiences, etc.

But I would suggest, however, that what people know and what they don't
know is often conditioned not simply by their individual tastes, but by
what publishing culture (academic, "official verse" and its tenuously
financed alternatives) makes available to them. Thus, the issue of who
knows what about what becomes ideologically loaded--what people are
"exposed" to, and what they will admit as relevant, are conditioned
(though not determined) by cultural circumstances.

Facets Multimedia in Chicago has a huge and excellent foreign and
difficult to find film rental service.  Don't know their # or address but
a phone call would solve that.  They're located on West Fullerton Avenue.

I haven't heard anyone mention any cowboy boots. And I live where cowboys
live, and one wouldn't be caught without her boots.

Mark,

For what it's worth, Carolyn Forche does use her position in the
"official verse culture" to promote experimental poetries and is even, at
staid and lumpy George Mason U., teaching a workshop next fall based on
experimental poetries and poetics. Indeed, to be as crude as utterly
possible about it, double-billing herself with Joan Retallack, which she
does frequently, gets Joan readings at staid and lumpy venues exactly
like the MLA itself, where more mainstream poets would normally be higher
up the list of poets to invite.

And, for what it's worth, about $12.95, I think, Retallack's
/Afterrimages/ is on the shelf at my local (ack!) Borders, which also
does a surprisingly good job of making available books by Sun & Moon and
other, more querzblatz presses.

So I take a positivist view on this one: all we can do is give such work
more exposure in whatever ways possible--the small presses deserve a big
salute--and in that way try to solve the problem of *how* people know a
poet as a poet. Maybe the people who were stunned silent at the MLA will
slowly, slowly, start to wonder, and do some investigating for
themselves: a reaction of not knowing how to deal with a work is *still*
a reaction to it, and one that may lead to an opening for the reader.

Instead of telling what we're wearing, we could combine a few recent

I am smelling only poorly. There was a flu and she had fallen victim to
it, which means on the floor at its feet. With breached breath she
slightly smelled some incense, which she had lit for her pewter Buddha,
half-hoping.

Reading this discussion on the visual in language continually reminds me
of a discussion that Liz & I had with you & Bruce in the early 80s when
we tried valiantly to pinpoint you guys on the boundaries of your own
experimentations & while there wasnt more of a visual component with
typography, layout, graphics, vispo,  book design, interactivity. If I
remember correctly the feeling was that you wanted your readers to have
the text & nothing but the text so that all attention would be focused
appropriately.

Methinks that one of the things that has changed most since those times
is the web & its intrincically visual nature, that desk top publishing
to produce hard copy is not all that different of an act than producing
web content & the multiplicity of intermesh between all possibilities,
visual & textual, is only now starting to reveal itself via the
electronic broadcast....

hope Im not chirping too much

Incense. Incest. The smell of a room, with a cold (a WOMB, *SNIF*).
and not to sound too popular or undernourised... with a view. Breached
becomes BLEACHED, only in reference to Nirvana and a dead boy
popularized almost as the Buddha, half-hoping, half-dead. Half joking
when the time comes to smell again.

also, I think, Miekel, that the longer poets are poets they have a better
acceptance of the fact that they are going to have to be involved not only
with the text but with the means of getting that text to an audience. No big
publishers are simply going to do it for them, at least for almost all of
them. And many times this leads to an intertwining of mode of production
with the text being produced, leading some of us to create works which
engage in the relationship of text to visual/structural formats, in ways you
have done, or in ways I have done, or in any of other myriad ways. It has
also led many to an interest/appreciation in such production even when they
have not engaged in it themselves. And now the web and other electronic
possibilities are causing a new explosion in such possibilities.

but I have never thought of Bruce & Charles as specifically disregarding the
visual/tactile/structural presentation of texts as irrelevant in any way. I
have rather always thought of those two as quite conscious that one never
has "just the text." Either we have a physical artifact in our hands or in
some way in front of us, or we have memory. At one time I became quite
troubled by the life of books, their existence as closed & unused objects
for probably 99% of their existence. But of course once one has experienced
a book, it is always there, as memory.

Who's gotten the nod this time? I haven't heard...

As far being "sanctified" by the State, I think it's something to be
avoided. Poetry and politics make  for very uneasy bedfellows in my opinion,
though admittedly it's a complicated issue when we get into matters of
federal funding for the arts, etc.

I still remember how I cringed when Richard Wilbur was "laureate" and came
out with that excerable cantata, "On Freedom's Ground." It was the same year
that the disclosure was made about the Defense Dept. drafting a white paper
for the invasion of Nicaragua.

In other words, poetry that's used to celebrate the State in an official
ceremony willy-nilly incurs for the poet involved a certain degree of
complicity when it comes to matters of policy. What would be refreshing -
and highly unlikely - would be to see a poet who read a critique of the
Administration's policy toward Bosnia, gays, medicinal marijuana and the
like.

Subject:      True North/ND Review

Stephanie Strickland's _True North_, the first winner of the Ernest Sandeen
Poetry Prize,  will be published next week by the University of Notre Dame
Press. I think the book will be of great interest to readers on the list.
Many people will know Strickland's previous book, _The Red Virgin: A Poem
of Simone Weil_, which won the University of Wisconsin's Brittingham Prize
in 1993. Molly Peacock describes _True North_ as writing "that sweeps text
into hypertext" and Strickland as a poet who "tumbles her cornucopia of
ideas and ideals out into what we might giddily call cyberpoetry--though
she herself is calm, piercingly intelligent, and clear-eyed. Here comes our
poetry for the 21st Century--and a brilliant poet who appears at just the
right moment to be our guide." Sections of this book dealing with the life

     O, (nodding) I agree. & such critiques are not I think easy to
write--largely because of what we belive constitutes "poetry" (ie, not
always "individual" voice and "the big picture" but usally at least one of
these Romantic conceits is regarded as necessary; and of course these are
not necessarily Romantic, going back at least as far as Sidney's
"Defense..." But then again, some of the 15th & 16th C. poets wrote
beautiful political poems: Wyatt, Raleigh--they weren't always towing the
state line either & consequenes could be serious (the block)
     Still, I continue to wonder just how such things are decided these
days. Can anyone name the last five inagural poets; maybe some conclusions
may be drawn.

Yes, the poet's home state has much to do with the choice. Remember when
Jimmy Carter asked his state-mate James Dickey to write an inaugural poem?
It was called "The Strength of Fields," and was read at an event held after
the oath of office was taken. Not too many people were aware of it unless
they read the poem in the NY Times the next day. I frankly don't care who
reads an inaugural poem -- I'm just glad to see that now and then a
president will actually call some national attention to the art, however
obliquely. You'd be surprised at how many people think that all poets are
dead.

Not only that, he's the father of Lucinda Williams--I'd take her records

i myself am quite chagrined at the choice of miller williams to be the
inaugural poet. i had laid several bets--on any one of the following four:
robert grenier, charles bernstein, lyn hejinian and hannah weiner--and have
dropped quite a bundle, let me tell you. i also thought i myself might get
the nod, but figured there'd be so much income from residuals that it would
easily cover my losses. actually, for a long time i figgered george
bowering should do it, but then i found that canada isnt technically one of

Dear Douglas,
            New Year Greetings!
            Is it too late to make a paper proposal for the Eyerhymes

work of conceptual artists like the Americans Lawrence Weiner, Joseph
Kosuth, and Jenny Holzer and the British artist Hamish Fulton,  David
Tremlett and language poets ( taking a pretty broad definition ) of this
grouping. If its not too late I'll put together a rather tighter and
longer paragraph than this.
            best wishes,

Subject:      Ebonix? Part 2.
Comments: To: POETICS@UBVM.cc.buffalo.edu

(Part 2- Ebonics?)

    Yesterday, for example, I was teaching with another writer, Margaret
O'Schultz at the local Youth Guidance Center - "a correctional facility." We
were in what was considered the toughest ward - 13 young men, many of whom I
was later told, had committed murders, rapes, and armed robberies, etc.
Margaret wrote the word MALE up on the blackboard and asked these students to
create a "slang dictionary." One black guy jumped up, took the chalk and
quickly jotted out fifteen different names which Margaret then asked him to
divide between "positive" (partna, playa, nigga etc.) and "negative" (mark,
snitch, etc.). Then there were words that sat in the middle like
"street-sweeper" which I imagined  to be a guy who was the ultimate drive-by
gang killer.

 Within this group, particularly among the blacks, there was competition,
argument and great pride in being able to come up with all these different
words. When I sat down to work with their writing, several of the young men
showed me their journals, freely said that they were poets, and gladly shared
their poems with me, most of them in a rap mode. Except when I heard the
depth of the pathos in the work -- the references to murdered brothers,
cousins and uncles, the re-enactments of revenge, or second thoughts about
misconceived and terrible acts, the loneliness of prison, "Not 'Rest in
Peace'" someone said. "Rest in Pain", I temporarily thought this prison ward
was a haven for poets and poetry.

    But my point about the dialect, black, Latino or Asian  -- a point which
has been demonstrated many times before by persons much more savvy than I --
 is that these words and phrases, often forged from extreme experiences, will
alter the grammar and dictionary of "standard English." I fully suspect, for
example, in the not too far future, "street-sweeper" will be appropriated by
the Army or Marines to name some demonic piece of killer machinery. Or, for
example, another young man used the phrase "he's stacked" and explained it
was about a dealer who carries large amounts  of money. In another few years
I can almost  expect a President with a happy face to tell us not to worry,
"the economy is stacked", or, on a contrary note, someone will say "the USA
has lost its "stack." I don't mean to sound overly cynical about the way
these words from dialect might evolve. Like most anything else, they will
wear out. At the point of origin, however, the expressions are fresh and
powerful. In both of these examples there's a highly loaded oxymoronic
quality to their use. The terrible sound and cleaning function of an actual
street-sweeper makes a terrifying counter-point to the sound of a machine gun
fired repeatedly from a car moving slowly through a neighborhood while the
gunner attems to clean out a rival gang. A man who is "stacked" with money
conjures up real cash in bundles, rather than the non-tactile, abstract
electronic transmissions of digital money.

    I find that the material of dialect to be rich and resonant - maybe in
manner similar that I also find the language of Chaucer, Donne and other
English writers of previous periods. I also know that whether called Ebonics,
black English, or a dialect -- these words, phrases and intonations compel me
to hear and see things that are variously provocative, beautiful, and
sometimes right on the edge of volatile. The manner of use, which can border
on a form of implicit preaching or public criticism,  pushes me to listen to
messages that all is not "proper" or "standard" in the world. And even though
I'm alternatively fascinated and resistant -- not everything survives coming
"over the pass"  --I'm sure these provocation's test, feed and ultimately
enlarge the vitality of the English language as well as all of our selves.

Dear List - I'm curious - given the strong interest in language here - why
not attention has been focused on debate and issues of so-called Ebonics. In
any case, I've written arelative short piece -- which I've broken into two
posts -- about some of my thoughts and experiences here. I will appreciate
your responses and critical feedback, responses.
Thank you,
Stephen Vincent
Steph4848@aol.com

Ebonics

    I find it astonishing the way in which people in this country become
absolute experts on this issue of the appropriate or inappropriateness of
black dialect. I wonder what would happen if all the sudden experts took
equal concern and attention to issues of black housing, schools, jobs etc!

It's amazing -- on the other hand -- how this issue of language  pops the
buttons. I suspect it goes down to the whole love/hate relationship between
proper English and black dialect - the latter obviously often feeding the
former. The ultimate mainstreaming of the word "cool", for example - let
alone the influence of black dance and other mediums in shaping and
contributing to much of the cultural fabric.

     Thirty years ago -- when I was in the Peace Corps -- I saw a somewhat
similar argument from Euro/American university educated Nigerians. Many of
them couldn't stand both the American and European lionization of Amos
Tutwola's(Sp?) novels that were written in what was really a gentrified
pidgin English. It wasn't that "the educated" were adverse to speaking pidgin
- it was definitely a vital lingua franca that worked to cross both class and
"the borders" of over 250 different indigenous language groups. Among this
elite, Wole Soyinka clearly had no problem incorporating pidgin into his
plays and novels. Pidgin's constant sense of poetic play with proper English
made a rich satirical device for dissing the masters, African or foreign. But
as a matter of creative writing, critical discussion, or any kind of  public
discourse in English--let alone issues of learning "proper English" as a
means of both participating and competing in a global market place-- there
was no question among people similar to Soyinka that to speak or write only
in pidgin English would serve only to perpetuate colonialized relationships.
At the same time I suspect pidgin English has become an area of formal study
and significance..

     Clearly, and perhaps similarly, in the context of the United States, it
seems universally important - both from a human and educational point of view
- for an English based system to acknowledge the distinct character of a
"black English", or Chinese, Chicano and all the  other dialect variations
that may occur when these various linguistic systems collide with "standard"
English.  From a teaching point of view, I think it ought to be a two way
street. The English teacher can use the knowledge of dialect to differentiate
between different ways of saying similar or, perhaps, oppostional things.
Such comparisons are a useful tool and, in a teaching context, can provide a
decent acknowledgment of linguistic as well as other kinds of differences.
Yet, at the same time, I think it equally important that those given the task
of teaching "standard English" acknowledge that dialects have and will
continue to end up contributing anything from a slight tonal nuance to a
substantial change to what is considered "standard English." And such a point
of view should be anything but a condescending gesture..

Actually the appointment of an inaugural poet at all bugs me a little.
We have these days someone we call a laurate, what we used to call
consultant in poetry to the l.o.c., or something like that. It's Robert
Hass for now. If it's not his job to write these things then what the
fuck is his job? On the other side of the pond where they know a little
more about this laurate business, Ted Hughes has to crank one out now &
then for the Royal family doesn't he. Somebody having a birthday party
and Ted has to _produce_! Maybe I remember wrong but I think Howard
Nemerov had the job back when Maya Angelou ascended the inaugural dais.
I'd rather have seen Howard and read _his_ poem in the Times the next
day. And I'd rather see Hass than whoever this fellow is -- hell he
might be a fine poet, I never heard of him. But there's Robert Hass
barnstorming for poetry, writing his little column for the Wash Post,
trying to get poetry back into the daily newspaper -- what an idea!? the
man is nuts! Working his butt off for muse & country and what does he
get? "No, no, this is an important occasion -- your invitation's in the
mail, Bob, honest, a lot of people haven't gotten theirs yet ..."

Steve Vincent, thanks for your stimulating post.  The complication for language
and literature, I think, in this case and in many others similar to it, is that
the modern state still only recognizes and understands grapholects and in many
instances we are forced to consider whether this actually facilitates or
undermines culture.

We know that it's only through grapholects that modern states and languages
exercise power, but it has never been easy or perhaps possible to extricate
literature from this mix.  In a sense it's no coincidence that language
instruction often goes hand in hand with literary texts; it's the way the state
puts everything together so that culture and the state are continuous with each
other, so that the state can control language, if it has to, in the name of
culture, and then also culture in the name of language.  Oral forms have always
escaped this kind of control because language and "publication" have taken place
in such very different ways.

I heard an anecdote about storytellers in Indonesia recently where the state had
been trying to record and transcribe the performances of some of them as a means
of codifying its national literature.  The storytellers considered this to be
such a threat to the diversity of the forms that they work in that they all went
on strike and refused to tell any more stories.

I think I looked in the Facets catalogue for Eustache a couple of years
ago and didn't find anything.

I knew he died young; his other (first) feature was about dropout
teenagers -- juvenile delinquents! (btw, tell Jesse not to worry abt
the juice stains). It was good but not preparation for M/W which is
really an incredible film.

I'll look at the most recent Facets (in DE this weekend) and hope to
find something.

A question for the list: do those of you who are white out there steer clear
of using "black standard English?"  If not, is there some ambivalence about
ownership and appropriation?  How do you demarcate its use: vocabulary,
grammar, etc.?

Is there a gender-specific "standard English"?  Is it more easily
transgressed than an ethnically-based one?  Any thoughts?

The best piece I've seen on this via poems was Catherine Gammon's "Issues of
Appropriation Penn Station, March 1991" in an old Ploughshares.  Other recos?

kudos to stephen vincent for opening up a vital area of controversy... i
like everything you say about ebonix, stephen, and find the public
hostilities toward it on the basis of "standards" regrettable... and in
part the media's doing---i haven't seen any particularly good coverage...

there were some odd publications came out during the sixties that addressed
language cross-overs... in retrospect they look like antiques... i have one
right here, let's see---

_play it cool in english_, by john dawkins and frank riessman (follet,
1967---evidently takes its title from langston hughes' "motto")... it's
really a sort of workbook---for kids... it begins

"this book is about hip words"

some of the "hip words" include, like, LIKE... i mean, "like" used the way
i've just used it, and also "i mean" used as in this sentence... it's
amazing how many of the words/expressions come from "black english" (and
street)... and how many have since found a very comfortable,
noncontroversial place in our daily language...

best,

with regard to wards post--and that sort of cheering anecdote--
I'm wondering what people think about the possible effects of
the state codifying (attempting to codify) "ebonics" (there, you
see, its already begun--can you think of a smarmier, etc. ).  as
with the indonesian storytellers, we seem to be faced with the
'museum effect' here, where the taxonomy of a cultural form removes
that form from (or at least impacts) the conditions of its production,
has a reifying influence--"a threat to the diversity of forms"--that
makes of their particulars a glass-eyed taxidermy project.  "Here
we have Myrmecophaga Jubata, the common ant bear..."

my webster's (there's an irony)gives "taxonomy" as the "orderly
classification of plants and animals according to their *presumed
natural relationships*" (emphass addtd)--but any biology or botany
I've read quickly drops the "presumed" in the name of 'pure' science.

course I'm not predicting that "ebonics" will strangle language--
we know (we?) that language has a way of violently defying
its tax8nomy--but there are troubling ramifications to official
'recognition'--authoritative characterization--in general.  I'd
expect that "ebonics" will provide what is possibly a necssary
visibility [says doubtfully]--but at th cost of misrepresentation.
"see, its alright--he saw it on the television."  the 'purists' of
language & arnoldian culture-philes are frequently (and rightly so)
pooh-poohed, but only to the effect that difference is squelched
and an official version of our movements given.  "raise yr hand
if you wanna be represented by the state--and repeat after me."

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Text of the resolution by the Oakland Board of Education adopting the
report and recommendations of the African-American Task Force:

Whereas, numerous . . . studies demonstrate that African-American
students as a part of their culture and history as African people
possess and utilize a language described in various scholarly
approaches as "Ebonics" (literally "Black sounds") or "Pan-African
Communication Behaviors" or "African Language Systems"; and

Whereas, these studies have also demonstrated that African Language
Systems are genetically based and not a dialect of English; and

Whereas, these studies demonstrate that such West and Niger-Congo
African languages have been officially recognized and addressed in
the mainstream public educational community as worth(y) of study,
understanding or application of (their) principles, laws and structures
for the benefit of African-American students both in terms of positive
appreciation of the language and these students' acquisition and mastery
of English language skills; and

Whereas, such recognition by scholars has given rise over the past 15
years to legislation . . . recognizing the unique language stature of
descendants of slaves, with such legislation being prejudicially and
unconstitutionally vetoed repeatedly by various California state
governors; and

Whereas, judicial cases in states other than California have recognized
the unique language stature of African-American pupils, and such recognition
by courts has resulted in court-mandated educational programs which have
substantiallybenefited African-American children in the interest of
vindicating their equal protection of the law rights under the 14th
Amendment to the U.S. Constitution; and

Whereas, the Federal Bilingual Education Act . . . mandates that local
educational agencies "build their capacities to establish, implement and
sustain programs of instruction for children and youth of limited English
proficiency"; and

Whereas, the interests of the Oakland Unified School District in providing
equal opportunities for all its students dictate limited English proficient
educational programs recognizing the English language acquisition and
improvement skills of African-American students are as fundamental as is
application of bilingual education principles for others whose primary
languages are other than English; and

Whereas, the standardized tests and grade scores of African-American students
in reading and language arts skills measuring their application of English
skills are substantially below . . . norms and that such deficiencies will be
remedied by application of a program featuring African Language Systems
principles in instructing African-American children both in their primary
language and in English; and

Whereas, standardized tests and grade scores will be remedied by application
of a program with teachers and aides who are certified in the methodology of
featuring African Language Systems principles in instructing African-American
children both in their primary language and in English. The certified teachers
of these students will be provided incentives including, but not limited to
salary differentials.

Now, therefore, be it resolved that the Board of Education officially
recognizes
the existence, and the cultural and historic bases of West and Niger-Congo
African Language Systems, and each language as the predominantly primary
language of African-American students; and

Be it further resolved that the Superintendent in conjunction with her
staff shall immediately devise and implement the best possible academic
program for imparting instruction to African-American students in their
primary language for the combined purpose of maintaining the legitimacy
and richness of such language whether it is known as "Ebonics," "African
Language Systems," "Pan-African Communication Behaviors" or other description,
and to facilitate their acquisition and mastery of English language skills; and

Be it further resolved that the Board of Education hereby commits to
earmark District general and special funding as is reasonably necessary and
appropriate to enable the Superintendent and her staff to accomplish the
foregoing; and

Be it further resolved that the periodic reports on the progress of the
creation and implementation of such an educational program shall be made
to the Board of Education at least once per month commencing at the Board
meeting of December 18, 1996.

Oh. Miller Williams. Duh. I'm turning 40 tomorrow and have been a bit ditzy
all week (as well soaking my brain cells in a lot of single malt c/o of kind
friends).

As far as I know, there is no tradition per se of inaugural poets. JFK
started it off with Frost and the practice seems to have begun and ended
there until Clinton revived it with Maya Angelou as a way of conferring
historical importance on his bad self.

Does anyone know of such practices in the 19th Century? I'm sure there is a
history of poetry/state occasions a/o alliances that would include both
colonial poems written to celebrate conquest (i.e. destruction of Native
Americans) and Whitman's "When Lilacs Last..."

I agree that writing such a critique is easier sd than done. And while it's
nice in a way to see poets of any stripe getting the kind of wide public
recognition that an inaugural reading can bestow - based on the idea that
what helps one poet helps Poetry in general - the business of inaugural
readings seems both to flatter a certain image the culture has of itself as
literate (while at the same time playing up to the royalist pretensions of
"laureateship") even as it co-opts poetry's more vital role as a subversive
force operating in the margins, an anodyne and/or riposte to the status quo,
what Agee meant when we wrote about "the emasculation of acceptance."

     miller williams apparently: I just saw it in a recent post of the same
title as yours & mine

     O, (nodding) I agree. & such critiques are not I think easy to
write--largely because of what we belive constitutes "poetry" (ie, not
always "individual" voice and "the big picture" but usally at least one of
these Romantic conceits is regarded as necessary; and of course these are
not necessarily Romantic, going back at least as far as Sidney's
"Defense..." But then again, some of the 15th & 16th C. poets wrote
beautiful political poems: Wyatt, Raleigh--they weren't always towing the
state line either & consequenes could be serious (the block)
     Still, I continue to wonder just how such things are decided these
days. Can anyone name the last five inagural poets; maybe some conclusions
may be drawn.

perhaps Emerson would serve as a good epigraph to this discussion:

"The poets made all the words, and therefore language is the archives of
history, and, if we must say it, a sort of tomb of the muses.  For, though
the origin of most of our words is forgotten, each word was at first a
stroke of genius, and obtained currency, because for the moment it
symbolized the world to the first speaker and to the hearer....  Language is
fossil poetry."

dialect = the new oral poetry?

Can't spel for any others, but one reason (aside from being deathly ill)
that I did not mention the "ebonics" news here is my sense that the
debate that was shaping up nationally had very little to do with the
merits or actual content of the Oakland school board's (to my way of
thinking) ill-conceived and poorly presented proposal [make that "speak"

back at my correctable keyboard in a couple weeks] -- AND the national
debate has had even less to do with the actual speaking and writing
practices of any real black students in American classrooms --

within five hours of the wire story's appearance, what Oakland proposed
was being presented in the media as a proposal to teach "bad English," to
teach "ghettoese" or, in Mary McGrory's Washington Post column, to
legitimize "gibberish" -- What became immediately evident was that for
most white writers in the national press, the term "black English"
(always problematical enough in its massive reifications of whatever
people already have in their head as a signfied for that term) was
synonmous with "ghetto" language, street slang, bad English and gibberish.

Eleanor Traylor was asked about this at the conclusion of the Toni Cade
Bambara panel at the NLA, apparently because ebonics, like Farrakhan and
O.J., is something that all black people must have a ready opinion about
for the benefit of white interrogators -- as Traylor made clear to her
audience that day, even if a student wants to write in Yourba, the
writing has to follow rules -- and why would anyone assume that those
rules would be "easy"?  Still, and this is one of those few things that
Eleanor and I agree about, she opined that this debate was nonsense and
distraction from the real problems of public education --

I confronted a similar oddity three years ago at San Jose State -- the
head of undergraduate education brought a proposal to the campus-wide
committee to award BA level foreign language credit for "dialectal"
students in "developmental" English courses -- That fell apart when I
pointed out to the man in charge of our entire undergraduate program that
the program had no foreign language requirement, and so his proposal
would only have added hours to the BA programs of the students without
gaining them any credit toward any program --

The real question for me remains, what do Americans hear in their minds
when they think of the English of black people?  None of my students
(even in LA) sound like that Rap soundtrack that most writers of
editorials seemed to have playing in their heads --

Those of us who were lingering in the Sheraton at the close of the MLA
had the discouraging experience of watching ch. 7 news grabbing at any
black person who happened down the hall trying to get the sound-bites
they wanted for the evening ebonics news -- They aired five seconds of
Hortense Spillers -- was she speaking a foreign language???

This has not been a debate about how black Americans do things with
English words, nor has it been a debate about how to teach black American
school children -- It has been a massive public venting of prejudices
that BEGINS with the assumption that the people engaging in the debate
already know what constitues black English (ebonics/gibberish -- with no
spelling out of particulars in either case!)


with continued apologies for my typing, here's a closing bit of good
sense from Patricia Williams:

Perhaps the real argument is not about whether ebonics is a lnaguge or
not.  Rather, the tension is revealed in the contradiction of black
speech being simultaneously understood yet not understood.  Why is it so
overwhelmingly, even colorfully comprehensible in some contexts,
particularly in sports and entertainment, yet deemed so utterly incapable
of effective communication when it comes to finding a job as a
construction worker?

Aloha.

Last spring, I taught a class at GMU on Merwin, Oppen, Celan, and
Berryman.  We began with Celan, and after the first assignment
(selections from Breathturn), one student raised their hand and said that
he didn't really like what he had read because it was "confusing as all
get out."  The class (and I) laughed, and when I asked him to clarify
what he meant by "as all get out," he couldn't, and dismissed it as "an
expression," that is, something that is learned, passed on, and through
these practices, needs no defining.  "Official verse culture" seems to
enjoy handing  us poems this way as well.  "I know what art is, but I
don't know what I like."

So what interests me even more than an audience that "ought to be
familiar" (Gwyn) is "clearly incredible poetry" (Mark).

While Joan Retallack's work may be incredible, it is not, in any
"official verse culture" sense of the word "clear" and this is probably
the reason for it's not being taken as "credible" in that culture.


Given that poetry is hardly mainstream even at its most mainstream, it is
no surprise that people like to keep it safe, tidy, and sighing.  That
is, "clear" and recognizable as "poetry."  They do this because
they, for some reason or another, distrust it from the very beginning.
People don't like people messing with "their" language.  Therefore, the
less messed-with it is, the better.  This has been talked about a
jillion times over, so I'll quit this one here.

But if "experimental" poetry is dismissed as not living up to a certain
"poetic standard," then what standards would some of those "avant-garde"
poets be using when they say they don't like Carolyn Forche's poetry?  Is
it, perhaps, too "clear"?  Wallace Stevens's "It must be abstract"
followed by some nebulous " . . . if it's to be any good at all"?  Then
again, I rarely get into conversations about poetry that I don't like (and
most of those usually happen by accident).  Maybe we should talk more
about that, although maybe that's a waste of good energy.

At any rate, by the end of the semester, my class was having pretty heated
arguments over who was "better": Merwin, Oppen, Celan, or Berryman.  I
tended to let these arguments continue for a while because I found them
absolutely fascinating.  I mean, here were 30 or so people, who, if they
had been exposed to poetry at all, it was in their high school AP English
classes (Eliot, Pound, Whitman, Dickinson) or Rita Dove, Charles Bukowski,
Maya Angelou on their own (I did a little poetry "survey" on the first day
of class).  All, as we might say "mainstream"/canonized poets.  (Plus
Bukowski, I know, I know . . .) Obviously, the students HAD to read the
four poets I selected (they had to write papers, attend class discussions,
etc.), but they certainly didn't have to argue about their value as
artists/writers. They could have just listened to me drone on and on . . .

So, if we are exposed to something that moves us to speak (or irritated
enough that something did not move us to speak, and therefore moved to
speech in a different way), we will project some sort of "taste" to (and,
in many cases, ON) those around us.

I have read wonderful pieces on poets that I love by poets that I'm not
all that crazy about: Louise Gluck on Oppen, Heaney on Celan and Beckett,
Robert Hass on Robert Creeley.  Given that these are poets writing on
poets, I wonder if our own poetry (mine, yours, his, hers) is ever a
decent reflection of our tastes in poetry.  I wonder, too, if baffled
silence is a negative reaction.

Poetry can be and is, certainly, a political discourse.  However, it is
also an artistic discourse, which gives it (and us) the freedom to
"contain multitudes."  I can like Oppen AND Gluck (Oppen and Merwin for
that matter), Joan Retallack AND Seamus Heaney, if I so choose.  This
doesn't necessarily mean that I have no standards or even "wackily
ecclectic" standards.  It means that I have been, in some way, moved by
what these people have made.

One danger in all this is that I'm more likely to be moved if someone's
talking about something that I already like.  But this has produced so
many conversations and, through these conversations, many friendships.
It's the way we work, so distrusting it completely is impossible.  Another
danger is that we begin to discuss whether or not people are being moved
for the right reasons.  Talking about art is a topic-centered discourse,
while art seems to be (primarily) a person to person discourse
(although the people involved are not necessarily specific at the time of
the making).  So what are we talking about when we talk about talking
about poetry?

Bests,

Graham

Okay. I've been watching this discussion for awhile and I finnally
have something to say:

The issue is real, and I think important. I do want to say something
in RE: to the FACT that AfroAmerican vernacular is NOT specifically an
AfroAmerican phenomina.

I am a Louisville native and was gradeSchooled here in public
institutions. The education was lax, so if there was intellegence
about you you would find OTHER ways of writing to get the shit you
wanted across across. This later was considered "poetic writing" and
it is the ONL:Y way I KNEW how to communicate thru writing. Then I
went thru a process of transformation, thru a process of BECOMING, a
process, that in & of itself was structured in vocal "scoring" of text
as I heard it & how I thought it.

What ppl call IBONICs is what I call written poetry.

* * *

I hope this isn't vain. I hope no one tries to confront me on this.
The deal is: it has taken me a long while to decide MY way of speaking
was PROPER and my way of WRITING was effectual. With EUROcentric thot
out & out still the PRIME example of creative/expressive
communication, anything I say that is differing makes ppl freak.

Could it be that a learning disability is accually a revolutionary
pre-cognitive association?

bye bye

Chris Stroffolino,

My essay on Rational Meaning, and the book itself, is too involved to
summarize here so I'd rather you read one or both before I add much more.
However --


>         Riding's politics moved in an opposite direction as
>          Oppen? In what sense do you mean this? There's an
>          implication that Oppen's leftism and his return to

>          certain aspects of poetry from a seemingly genreless
>          perspective may invoke a kind of "rightism?"

Oppen's politics are related to his poetic turnings just as Riding's
politics are related to hers (one leading to return, the other to a final
turn away). But more significant, at least in regard to questions of
language, the political issues became, for both, fundamentally ethical
questions.  -- I am not being especially metaphoric or elusive about Oppen
to the left or Riding to the right. These are declared allegiances as the
1930s came to a close.  Notable in this respect is Riding's tract The Left
Heresy in Literature and Life, co-authored by "ex-Communist" Harry Kemp.
This was one of the two last books that Riding published in 1939; she didn't
publish another book till the 1970 selected.

>          Are you implying that Riding's "voiceless telling"
>          does away with "poetic turning?"

No, I am saying the opposite; but in saying the opposite I am certainly
contradicting (or turning around again) Laura and Schulyer Jackson's claim,
that "poetic telling" and especially poetic turning is no telling at all,
but a falsity.

Let me add one further note on this in the light of the recent discussion of
dialect on the list (and thanks, Steve Vincent and Aldon Nielsen, for your
posts). One of the problems with *Rational Meaning* is it's rejection of
language change: it argues not for standard English but for the linguistic
truth of the English of Spencer, with a deterioration ever since. This is an
extreme position, but it is implicit in many of advocates of "correct"
English, as opposed to "standard" or what I would prefer to call
"conventional" English. This implicit, and false, idea of correctness comes
up repeatedly in the review of the new "Fowler," for example, and is also a
crucial if often tacit part of the recent public discussion of dialect. A
great value of *Rational Meaning* is that it doesn't hedge on this argument.
It shows what is behind much of the neoliberal posturing on this issue by
its adamant rejection of a neoliberal facade.

By the way, my essay on nonstandard English (the ideology of dialects),
"Poetics of the Americas", written for Aldon Nielsen's forthcoming
collection of essays, "An Area of Act": Race and Readings in American
Poetry, is now available on line at the Modernism/Modernity web site (it's
published in the M/M vol. 3 #3). You can find this at

Indeed. These comments seem right on. There are many languages and language effects to
be read through and into the palmipsest "debate" about ebonics. A couple of
observations:

I think the fear of 'state codification' profered by both 'liberal' and 'conservative'
glossologists is something of a mauve herring. However, state (de)constructions of both
the 'public' and 'education' are central to this speech competence. The post-reagan,
neo-liberalism/clintonism has effectively immiserated urban institutions, particularly
schools (cf. Jonathan Kozol's _Savage Inequalities_), while simultaneously conjuring the
'problems' of late 20th cent., advance-capitalist amerryca as 'other-ness', in
particualre, *blackness*.

I think it important to read ebonics in this new raced state-formation. The language of
the 'new-federalism' (state rights, welfare block grants etc.) legislated by both
democrats and republicans uses the rhetoric of local empowerment while assuming its
irrelevence to change the racial-corporatist status quo. It is not surprising that folks
will use various municipal gestures in the coming years (decades?) to assert a degree of
self-determination. I think the federal take-over of D.C. public schools, indeed the
take-over of D.C. is an exercise in meaning production for the new (world) order
policing that 'ebonics' neo-logistically tilts against.

The genuine state-corporate, post-internal-colonial, codified policing of language is
conspicuous by its absence in the debate. To wit, the perversities of 'standardized'
testing as a measure not only of linguistic competence but as a measure of schools
'productivity' and 'effective-ness'. And I don't mean to be critical of these 'tests' in
the that hyper-real debate of whether or not they are 'biased'--of course they are--but
rather in the Foucauldian sense of the by now wide-spread internalized desire by both
individuals and institutions to *teach the test*: a pedegogy of normalization. The
ebonics 'advocates' speak implicitly and explicitly against this juridicial regime.

Loss Pequen~o Glazier (glazier@acsu.buffalo.edu).]
____________________________________________________________________

1. About the Poetics List

Please note that this is a private list and information about the list
should not be posted to other lists or directories of lists. The idea is to
keep the list to those with specific rather than general interests, and also
to keep the scale of the list small and the volume manageable.

The Poetics List, while committed to openness, is moderated. While
individual posts of participants are sent directly to all subscribers, we
continue to work to promote the editorial function of this project. The
definition of that project, while provisional, and while open to continual
redefinition by list participants, is nonetheless aversive to a generalized
discussion of poetry. Rather, our aim is  to support, inform, and extend
those directions in poetry that are committed to innovations, renovations,
and investigations of form and/or/as content, to the questioning of received
forms and styles, and to the creation of the otherwise unimagined, untried,
unexpected, improbable, and impossible.

The "list owner" of Poetics is Charles Bernstein: contact him for further
information. Joel Kuszai is currently working on the administration of the
list.  For subscription information contact us at POETICS@acsu.buffalo.edu.


____________________________________________________________________

2. Subscriptions

The list has open subscriptions.  You can subscribe (sub) or
unsubscribe (unsub) by sending a one-line message, with no subject
line, to:

listserv@listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu

the one-line message should say:

unsub poetics

{or}

sub poetics Jill Jillway

(replacing Jill Jillway with your own name; but note: do not use your
name to unsub)

We will be sent a notice of all subscription activity.

*
If you are having difficulty unsubscribing, please note:

Sometimes your e-mail address may be changed slightly by your system
administrator.  If this happens you will not be able to send messages to
Poetics or to unsubscribe, although you will continue to get your Poetics
mail.  To avoid this, unsub from the old address and resub from the new
address.  If you can no longer do this there is a solution if you use Eudora
(an e-mail program that is available free at shareware sites): from the Tools
menu select "Options" and then select set-up for "Sending Mail": you can
substitute your old address here and send the unsub message.

The most frequent problem with subscriptions is bounced messages.  If your
system is often down or if you have a low disk quota, Poetics messages may
get bounced.  Please try avoid having messages from the list returned to us.
If the problem is low disk quota, you may wish to request an increase from
your system administrator. (You may wish to argue that this subscription is
part of your scholarly communication!) You may also wish to consider
obtaining a commercial account.

____________________________________________________________________

3.  Cautions

Please do not send attachments or include extremely long documents in a
post, since this may make it difficult for those who get the list via
"digest" or who cannot decode attached or specially formatted files.

In addition to being archived at the EPC, some posts to Poetics (especially
reviews, obituary notices, announcements, etc.) may also become part of
specific EPC subject areas. (See section 7.)

Please do not send inquiries to the list to get an individual subscribers
address. To get this information, see section 6.

If you want someone to send out information to the list as a whole, or
supply information missing from an post, please send the request or comment
to the individual backchannel, not to the whole list.

____________________________________________________________________

4. Digest Option

The Poetics List can send a large number of individual messages to
your account to each day!  If you would prefer to receive ONE message
each day, which would include all messages posted to the list for that
day, you can use the digest option.  Send this one-line message (no subject
line) to
                                listserv@listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu

set poetics digest

NOTE:!! Send this message to "listserv" not to Poetics or as a reply
to this message!!

You can switch back to individual messages by sending this message:

set poetics mail
____________________________________________________________________

5. Temporarily turning off Poetics mail

Do not leave your Poetics subscription "active" if you are going to be away
for any extended period of time! Your account may become flooded and you may
lose not only Poetics messages but other important mail. You can temporarily
turn off your Poetics subscription by sending a message to "listserv."


set poetics nomail

& turn it on again with: set poetics mail

When you return you can check or download missed postings from the Poetics
archive. (See 8 below.)

____________________________________________________________________

6. Who's Subscribed

To see who is subscribed to Poetics, send an e-mail message to
listserv@ubvm.cc.buffalo.edu; leave the "Subject" line of the e-mail message
blank.  In the body of your e-mail message type:

  review poetics

You will be sent within a reasonable amount of time (by return e-mail) a
rather long list containing the names and e-mail addresses of Poetics
subscribers.  This list is alphabetized by server not name.

Please do not send a message to the list asking for the address of a
specific subscriber.
____________________________________________________________________

7. What is the Electronic Poetry Center?

our URL is

http://writing.upenn.edu/epc

The mission of this World-Wide Web based electronic poetry center is to
serve as a hypertextual gateway to the extraordinary range of activity in
formally innovative writing in the United States and the world.  The Center
provides access to the burgeoning number of electronic resources in the new
poetries including RIF/T and other electronic poetry journals, the POETICS
List archives, an AUTHOR library of electronic poetic texts, and direct
connections to numerous related electronic
RESOURCES. The Center also provides information about contemporary print
little magazines and SMALL PRESSES engaged in poetry and poetics. And we
have an extensive collection of soundfiles of poets' reading their work, as
well as the archive of LINEbreak, the radio interview series.

The EPC is directed by Loss Pequen~o Glazier.
____________________________________________________________________

8. Poetics Archives via EPC

Go to the EPC and select Poetics from the opening screen. Follow the
links to Poetics Archives. You may browse the archives by month and
year or search them for specific information. Your interface will
allow you to print or download any of these files.

Or set your browser to go directly to:
http://writing.upenn.edu/epc/poetics/archive

____________________________________________________________________

9. Publishers & Editors Read This!

PUBLISHERS & EDITORS: Our listings of poetry and poetics information is open
and available to you. We are trying to make access to printed publications
as easy as possible to our users and ENCOURAGE you to participate! Send a
list of your press/publications to
lolpoet@acsu.buffalo.edu with the words EPC Press Listing in the subject
line. You may also send materials on disk. (Write file name, word processing
program, and Mac or PC on disk.) Send an e-mail message to the address above
to obtain a mailing address to which to send your disk. Though files marked
up with html are our goal, ascii files are perfectly acceptable. If your
word processor ill save files in Rich Text Format (.rtf) this is also highly
desirable

Send us extended information on new publications (including any back cover copy
and sample poems) as well as complete catalogs/backlists (including excerpts
from reviews, sample poems, etc.).  Be sure to include full information for
ordering--including prices and addresses and phone numbers both of the press
and any distributors.

Initially, you might want to send short anouncements of new publications
directly to the Poetics list as subscribers do not always (or ever) check the
EPC; in your message please include full information for ordering.  If you have
a fuller listing at EPC, you might also mention that in any Poetics posts.

Some announcements circulated through Poetics and the EPC have received a
noticeable responses; it may be an effective way to promote your publication
and we are glad to facilitate information about interesting publications.

Graham--but Bukowski doesnt need to be a parenthetical demurrer from a list
of "acknowledged widely" or "mainstream"(what we call "maindrain" on the
Britipoetlist). He's as predictable as donuts. The only cause of his being
declared (by a New Orleans zine) "Outside of the Year" in 1962 was the
raunchy nature of his subjectmatter. Later, as a public developed, his
public persona became a cause de scandale, of course. But not formally nor
in any other sense of "mens" did he trailblaze--he's really like rod mckuen
but daring to be a person. He _belongs_ on that list you provide, and once
more we see a strange unerring factor in halfeducated undergrads as they
pick their poets. And this choice is absolute for a spell (at their age, I
couldnt find enough Dowson to keep me alive). after all, theyre there to be
further educated. I taught college for 25 yrs and based on what i met there
would say that it were better poetry be not taught at all in high school
rather than the way it usually is. . .so many of my students were
poetry-damaged, unable to relax and let the capta sort itself out from the
data.They cd only recognize a poem when it was in the missionary position.
that a poem might be as opaque as a person, capable of many kinds of
caress, much playful laughter, of brooding witholding silences,of orderly
thought or persuasive choplogic, of trivial drivel, of witty
observations--that it might even be a dreadful machine psychotic--they had
not been permitted, though in their years of sturm und drang, to realize:
it was a little problem with pretty or pretty awful pictures, and could be
solved by identifying and then adding together its (not too) various
elements. and the teacher had the answer.Well, the teacher has some of the
answerS, let us hope! but so does the student. However, the finality of
their taste cannot endure, if the vast range of excitements poetry offers
can be indicated to them.
  please pardon my running on. its the wine i had with lunch. it wasnt just
any wine. but the effect is no doubt indistinguishable. ah dove! ah buke!

It seems to me that there are several different issues here:

1) why all the fuss by the honkie press?

2) how do you teach standard English to those who grow up speaking a
different dialect?

3) the nature of and reasons for the distinction between language and dialect.

4) the uses of diversity.

5) the ideology expressed by the motion before the school board, which is a
different issue than whether or not it's a good idea. And perhaps a hidden
agenda on the part of the board.

All of the above have received some attention from the list except 5. The
School Board's proposal bears inspection. Languages, they claim, are
"genetically based?" This looks like "Black Athena" redivivus. If this were
true, there would be substantial grammatical similarities between Ebonics
and the street French of Cote Ivoirien kids in Paris, for instance. There's
lots of reasons to value and teach any dialect, but it shouldn't be
necessary to teach bogus science to justify it.
Salary differentials for teachers certified in "the methadology of teaching
African Language Systems principles?" Aha! If ebonics is a language its
teachers can cash in on some of the bilingual ed money instead of having to
fork it over to all those other ethnics.

But let's get real linguistically for the moment. There are versions of
European languages that use West African grammatical elements and largely
european vocabulary. Gulla, Haitian Creole, the dialect of Bahia in Brazil,
_bozal_ in Cuba, etc. None of their grammatical structures resemble what's
being taken to be American Black English (hereafter and forever to be known
as Ebonics, alas!) as I understand the term. The grammar of Ebonics has, I
think, far more to do with archaic English or Apalachian Mountain English
than it does with anything coming from Africa. None of which reduces one
iota its dignity, beauty, or usefulness as a means of communication or as a
tool for teachers. Any more than does the fact that the Oakland board may
have been partly motivated by less than noble impulses.

It's not always the codification of the written language that has been the
tool of power, by the way. More often, outside of China at least, it's been
the codification of the dominant spoken dialect. Franco didn't want Catalans
to speak Catalan even at home, Navajo kids got whipped for speaking Dine,
Alsatians in this and the last century had to learn to speak French, then
Hoch Deutsch, then French again. And any number of peoples who wrote no
language have been forced to speak the master's language. The imposition of
a common dialect for written communication is another matter. Journalistic
literary Arabic, a case in point, is, I understand, no one's native tongue,
although it has certainly come to function as a class marker, as post-Roman
latin did until recently in Europe. But it also serves to make communication
possible all over the Arab world--there would be no "Arab World" if one
dialect had not become hegemonic for that purpose--but it has little effect
on how people speak in Sana'a or Marrakesh.

I myself speak Hebronics, which mightily confuses my wife, who speaks
Apalachionics.
A useful generic term for all dialects that are the result of imperialism
might be colonics.

Romansh, the Swiss language that's spoken in the canton of Grison, around St.
Moritz, has been making somewhat of a comeback in the last few years.  I heard
on the news a few days ago that there's now a Romansh newspaper.  In setting up
the paper they were very particular about not favoring one dialect over another;
each edition contains articles written in the language's five idioms.

I've been asked to make a small correction: Barbara Guest saw about half
of the entire manuscript, parts of all the sections, not the Willard
Gibbs poems in isolation.  She chose it as a manuscript-in-progress.

It's a well done site and I was surprised at how straightforward the

on the web, the <pre></pre> tags can be used to preserve spacing... the
tradeoff is, the monospaced fonts most systems have available to to display
preformatted text are ugly.

you can also use tables to force text to spread out across the page, by
specifying th width... define a single cell table and make it really big...

and ov course you could produce broadsides as graphic files--postscript
wd be th most efficient, gifs make for long downloads...

any of these solutions can cause problems on-screen, since it's hard to
scan if you have to keep scrolling left & right.  sometime the solution is
to suggest folks print the page, in landscape mode...  but i've seen the
limitation used to advantage, w/ really wide graphics laid out in panels
(almost like comic strips) which force you to scroll and use the progressive
display as a narrative device...

w/ ascii, yr stuck with the convention of indenting the subsequent breaks
in a long line, which _should_ be standard enough to avoid confusion... but
i still remember the college prof i had who insisted that all the linebreaks
in *howl*, as it appeared in the norton anthology, were significant--after all,
that was a definitive edition...

Can't praise enough Mark Weiss's sensible & informed posting on dialects/stan-
dards.  This reminds us that it's not ALL ideology: somewhere out there are
real "facts" of language behavior, & at some point we've got to take our stand
on those.  Good to be reminded too of how "layered" everyone's language beha-
vior is.  "Hebronics" is a funny idea, but not JUST funny, in view of how deep-
ly Yiddish colors urban (Eastern mainly?) speech varieties.  And not just that
of Jews, i.e., it ISN'T "genetic."  (Or, in Hebronics: "Genetics it isn't.")

What I do for variable spacing, & this is a hack if I ever heard of one,
is tiny transparent gifs of different pixel widths.  You can easily
create a small catalogue of a couple different sizes & paste in the
image tags in whatever combination necessary to give you the spacing
needed.

The problem with using gif or postcrpt to create a broadside is then
your content is neither searchable or hypertextable (actually I suppose
you could link graphics, but that feels clunky).

<In the present, i find i'm much taken with (well, it's tout neuf to me)
this listwriting. no doubt there will be those capable of abstracting
theses from it and providing us with provocative books "about", and that
will prove one kind of usefulness, but i enjoy it as the melee it is
also.
i'm glad for the appearance of company--its like new hampshire sans the
third dimension. db


After a week scribing a space for myself on the sidelines of this list I
have to say that Im generally impressed by the complete absense of
typical listserv behaviors like flamewars, name-calling, bombthreats,
pointless disputs, lack of self-editing.  An impressive well behaved
assemblage of speechlings we are here.  Also I really like the
openposting feeling, that folks are free to publicize readings,
publications, research projects whatever.  On one other list I was on
there was debate that went on for a couple months about codifying
subject header tags so such as AD, Comment, etc.  Friggin ridiculous.

While Im not capable of participating in the academic headiness that
informs some posts,  I am prepared to resurrect the ranting spirit of
Pound, the breakwater directness of Bern Porter, the deflocculating
pompacity of Isidor Isou, & the bum on the beach aesthethics of Harry
Kemp.  Let the textspirit of the outsiders shine thru the academic
gloss.

Personally, I'm sorry to have missed a months-long discussion of subject
header tags, but I'm a fairly dull person, or I have a strange sense of
humor, or both.

However, I have noticed all together TOO FEW listings of recent publications
by list participants. In fact I have been getting books and magazines
published by people on this list without seeing any announcements of them on
the list. So perhaps this will prompt more such postings: editors,
publishers: please send listings of recent publications including ordering
information. Individuals: please send information on any new publications.

Since 1985 Xexoxial Editions has been collecting neologism thru the
various networks.  This summer, thanks to the eagle-eye persistence of
Autonomedia's Ben Meyers the first edition is almost ready for
printing.  We will also be posting an updateable online version of the
dictionary as well as soon as my html expertise reaches new levels.

Earlier in the week I had mentioned how even tho I couldnt get folks
here at Dreamtime to discuss poetics as such, I was continually amazed
how inventive & fruitful folks could be with a format like neologisms &
especially people who were not poets & writers persay.

Xexoxial will always be thirstily absorbing all possible neologisms &
invites Poetix List participants to submit their neologisms for
inclusion in the dictionary. Just to provoke & inspire possibilities I
include the outtakes from the workshop I did with the Summer School for
Designing a Society, directed by one of the grandfathers of computer
music, Herbert Brun this last July.  Id like to point out that the
majority of participants had no context for these creations other than
their imagination.

minimally less hacky is the special character "&nbsp;", non-breaking space,
which has the advantage of displaying properly if someone is reading  w/
graphics turned off (which some reports claim is up to 50% of folks who
have to pay for their connect time)...

Miekal And's posting on The Internalational Dictionary of Neologisms,
compiled by Xexoxial Editions is wonderful--a wild-minded effort
very much in dada spirit. The possibilities for extension seem vast:
In fact, couldn't such a dictionary become the evolving
archive for a brand new dialect, out of which could arise a whole
library of shimmering, hermetic works?

Here's an addition to the IDN I'd like to offer:

_melnick_ *adj* Having, displaying, or marked by the qualities of
heroism in language. *v* In circles of poetry, an entering
into words that causes one to think and behave in uncommonly
incautious ways.

I think this new dialect should be called *listics*.

        For folks who come from a graphics or a typesetting software
background, HTML is about as imprecise as it gets. Like trying to make
justified margins with a manual typewriter - and that's not really an
exaggeration at all.
        But you could "fix" your work. As if you freeze-dried it or placed
dried flowers in a clear plastic seal. That is, take a picture of it (gif)
or use a more graphically oriented reader (Adobe Acrobat?).
        One supposes that the technology will advance. But if you think of
it, it may be the unfixability that makes it workable. The pages come across
to so many different machines with so many different parameters maybe in
large part because the fit is sloppy and it will push, pull and give.
        Basically, HTML IS a very primitive markup scheme. And the economic
reality is that there hasn't been a motivation for mark-up that has any
degree of accuracy. The much-touted HTML+ offers more and we're all grateful
for that but realistically it's not a LOT more, wouldn't you agree? I mean,
who here has given much thought to SGML (the 'authoritative text' version of
HTML) and where will we find the creator of VPML (visual poetry markup
language)? (Here I'm only dreaming)
        If we want such things I think we may have to invent them ourselves.
Otherwise ... (You know I always wondered why it wasn't a standard feature
of basic word processing programs to type at any angle you wanted.)

One way at Dreamtime that we put neologisms to work is to come up with
words for phenomena that have yet to be lexified.  One could easily
imagine needing words on this PoEtIxZ list for things like:

a voyeuristic facinations with the dress of others

uncodifiable names to poetic movements that are rumoured to exist

the inproportionate ratio of writers to publishers & thus to readers

critical stances that are substantiated by ecologies of language as
opposed to academic constructs

professorial authority

the predisposition to forgetting the raw spirit of Logos once a poet
becomes tenured, famous or tokenized

the lineage of influences within which the writer places his/her self

books of poetry that have never been opened  (C Alexander must have a
word for this one)

linguistic phenomena that are synthaethetically beyond words

an easy way to abbreviate L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E

poetries of everyday life

the resolve with which the children of poets decide to become physicans
& attorneys

the magnitude to which the proliferation of small press literature will
soon exceed the metaphor of the Library of Babel in our lifetime

i must say i disagree; the term "genetic" did not refer to biological genetics
but to linguistic geneaologies; the theory that Black American English (or what
ever you want to call it) is fundamentally an appalachian cognate rather than an
a west african derivative was, i think, refuted almost as soon as it appeared
some years ago (and as i recall, of course foggily so forgive errors) the theory
was not advanced by a linguist but by a literary southerner, a neo-agrarian as
it were.  so far, nielsen and corbin have offered the most interesting insights
on this matter.--md

Maria: I think it actually has to do with the Jungian subtext that
Miekal in his formative years dropped out of 4 colleges a total of 8
times & is still a freshman, & thus has always been denied the lifelong
dream of holding forth in front of subsequent undergrads. Since Im
incapable of theoretical rigor, I have to at least be allowed stance &
counterpoint.

SF in this case meaning San Francisco  and not science fiction
        Yesterday I was talking to a friend who's a science fiction nut,
and he asked me if I had ever heard of poets named Robert Duncan and John
Spicer. I said, sure, only it's jack spicer, why?  and he said that he
recently read in an old PKD fanzine that Dick once shared an apartment with
two poets named Duncan and Spicer.
        Is this true? Is this common knowledge?
        This is interesting to me because Spicer and Dick have both
asserted a notion of writing as something dictated from the outside:
Spicer's poet-as-radio is analogous to Dick's idea of getting his words
from outer space.

Loss, your point is well taken, it is just this unfixability which
creates the textured presence of the web as we know it.

I remember one time that I was driving fork lift in high school & I took
my copy of Michael Benedikts Anthology of Prose Poetry to work.  I put
it to the back seat of the lift & some point during the day its fell
into the engine & a whole new reading of these minced & chopped poems
was generated.

There is a time wise relativity in the evolution of electronic
publishing.  When I compare the possibilities now with our early days of
Xerox Sutra when we did not even own a typewriter & all of our books
were "typeset" by getting magazines & cutting & pasting letter by
letter, I am quite grateful for such stoneagetronics as html.

the Internalational Dictionary of Neologisms is that it creates a
brand new language-game space: one where signifiers become the
willful signified of the dictionary authors' intents. (that
signification stuff sounds old-hat--why not invent new words for the
whole kittenkabuddle of it). Obviously, a reversal of the
dictionay's directions is proposed by Mikael's et.al's project. The
possibilities of Mikail's proposal (especially in the hyper-context
of this medium) seem exciting to me, but I say this realizing that I
may be, as Mark Weiss and Maria Damon seem to imply, innocently
insinuating myself into a space where I'm out of place or over my
head? They may well be right, but hail, for waht its worth, to Mikhail
and his cabal.

listen weisenheimer, some of us are facing 14 below zero on a daily basis here
in the vast north country fair, where the winds hit heavy on the borderline. the
only thing we can do for fun is hang over the keyboard hoping for a good msg fro
m poetix.  what's a lavalava anyway, any relation to jetskis?--md

this is true and it is as common knowledge as anything about spicer and duncan.
actually i think he was the roommate of one (duncan?) while the other was
hanging out, that is i don't think spicer and duncan ever lived together, but
here's where kevin killian can step in and provide les faits durs.  paul goodman
too was in that circle; a few years ago i was convinced that goodman was about
to undergo a bit huge resurgency of interest from american studies and cultural
studies types but history has proved me wrong so far.  maybe in another few
years, when someone reallizes that the 50s had its intellectuals as well as its
wildmen.

Maria, a lavalava is a kind of lamplamp that's very enlightening if
you're plugged in to the right level of consciousness...

ah..i forgotgot. sorry we didn't meet at mla.  does anyone have anything to say
about any events other than the riding panel?  how bout the live white boys'
panel?  how bout the readings?  i myself saw walter lew, kimiko hahn and heinz
insu fenkl read and enjoyed it.  i'd never seen kimiko or met heinz, both of
whose work i liked a lot.  walter read his old stuff from the early 70s which
was a treat, i hadn't heard those poems for almost 20 years and they were yummy.
also saw susan schultz, bob perelman and steve dickison there, as well as kathy
crown, organizer of the rutgers splash, and julie chang, whose article on asian
american poetry in MELUS is quite good.  saw ben friedlander on the panel i
"presided" at, the jewish cultural studies panel on nomadism exile diaspora, he
gave a wonderful close reading of a levinas lecture on "promised land or
permitted land" which was a tight, crafted, self-sufficient world of
argumentation through careful language.  kinda like a poem, duh... and i met his
father too. and carla b was there too.  saw arthur sabatini who told me about
the panel on slams, which i couldn't attend but wisht i woulda (as they say
here).  any other takers?--md

which reminds of another laborer in the neologos fields, ge(of) huth,
whose magazine _th subtle journal of raw coinage_ has fr years been
devoted to the new word, generally presented in their freshminted
forms & undefined... and in that vein:

     anticdote
     construsion
     exceptations
     farward (or farword)
     inchantation, inchantatory

I was digging thru my archives & thru the wonders of electro
'pataphysics I have rematerialized this very telling photo of Maria
Professorina at Age 6.  I have attached it as a GIF file, which is
viewable with photoshop on the mac & many windows formats. Suitable for
framing.

many of Ge(of)'s words are in the dictionary complete with definitions.
One other to mention in this vein is Michael Helsem of Dallas, TX who
has more than a couple hundred words in the dictionary, each exquisite
in their crystalline forms.

could we not enhance the meaning of a word by showing its employment in a
sentence? For example,
         surfered,
as in,
she surfered from minstrel tramps and dislikes of her.

Example two:
            sweatheat,
as in,
she scathed her sweatheat's mane in the arleady defacted tunk.

Example three:
              heavely,
as in,
Mother drank heavely.(or. Mother never drank heavely).

Example four:
             werter, and gridated,
as in,
This werter never gridated collage.

Example five:
             spanrods,
as in,
       Tow moanratic spanrods.

Example six:
            ares,
as in,
 Two cystals danegeld from here ares.

For fellow insomniacs at the ends of their tethers (otherwise i'd be
reading Habermas on Hegel along with the people who can sleep), let me
suggest another game:
     look for potentially interesting pairings on whatever bookshelves (or
portions of the floor) within easy view from where you sit at yr computer.

E.g.,
          Leonard Simon's _Dissociated States_ along with Francois
Dominique's publication _Quatre poetes chinois_

 Example two: Vallejo's _Trilce_ (the Eshleman tr.) along with
              Tony Lopez, _Negative Equity_

 Example three: Auden, _A Certain World_  along with
                Susan Gevirtz,_Domino: point of Entry_

 Example four: Ouspensky's _Tertium Organum_ along with
               George Lakoff, _Women, Fire and Dangerous Things_

 Example five: Piaget, _The Child's Conception of Movement and Speed_  with
               Augustine, _Confessions_ tr by Rex Warner.

 Example six:  Grenier, _Burns Night Heard_  along with
               Ovid's _Metamorphoses_ tr by Horace Gregory.

Contemplating these pairings, I think again how arbitrary pairings can
feel. Why this one and not that? Doesn't the gevirtz yearn to be next to
the augustine? and isn't that reciprocal? Doesn't the lakoff hanker after
the grenier, the grenier after the vallejo? What if ouspensky and leonard
simon were stranded together by bad weather in a distress-rate hotel nr the
airport in denver--would opposites pressured by propinquity seize
opportunity?

i'm afraid none of my pairings is remarkable enough to be what i was
looking for. Of course Beckett's _Worstword Ho_ is beside Kafka's
_Parables_. Other people's bookshelves would be a lot more entertaining.

well that inched me a little closer toward sleep. you come, too. the words
are ugly, dank and cheap. we are having them replaced with lively, bark and
leap. that is our error. they should be replaced with lulling, narc (otic)
and deep(endable).
 if i die before i wake
 savor the garlic on my steak.  db

I'm so happy to hear that I'm not the only one loopy enough to have
thought of something like this.  At sixteen, with a huge stack of books
next to my bed, I used to worry about how _Our Lady of the Flowers_
would *feel*, lying under, say, _The Artaud Anthology_.  Was it a good
idea for _Kulchur_ 17, with Robert Indiana's "DIE" on the cover, to be
next to (the somewhat tender) _Kaddish_?  Things like that.  Oh, to be
young again.  Now I am so cavalier: what is _The Scum Manifesto_ (a true
curio) doing next to *anything*, let alone _The Beat Generation and the
Angry Young Men_?  What an insensate brute, what a real Bluto I've
become.

Wearing: shall I be the first on the list to admit to wearing a dress?
Blue cotton, thin from too many washings.  Tatami sandals.  A second
first (in the admissions dept.): plain gold band.

Small Press Traffic presents

_Becoming Modern: The Life of Mina Loy_
a talk by Carolyn Burke

=46riday, January 17, 7:30 p.m.

Small Press Traffic=B9s _Talk Series_ continues with this presentation by
Carolyn Burke, who will discuss her new biography of the enigmatic
modernist poet Mina Loy, and discuss as well the travails of her
twenty-year research project, over four continents, on the trail of Loy.
London-born Mina Loy (1882-1966) was the intimate of William Carlos
Williams, Marcel Duchamp, Gertrude Stein, Ezra Pound, Joseph Cornell,
Marinetti, Djuna Barnes and Man Ray; yet despite her genius, beauty and
pizzazz she has--until quite recently--been almost forgotten, except for a
few dedicated =B3Loy=B2-alists. Her biographer, Carolyn Burke, holds a Ph.D.=
 in
literature from Columbia and is well known for her translations and
critical work on post-modern French feminisms, particularly Irigaray,
Cixous, Kristeva. A native of Australia, she now splits her time between
Santa Cruz and Sydney.

no chance of redeeming cyber.  ive been using that word before cyber was
cyber & in fact created a concept in 1985 called the cyberpsychic
bulletin board which in my mind 12 years later was the web in its

Subject:      The Retallack Effect
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

I've been thinking about Joan Retallack stunning audiences at the MLA.  She
stunned audiences too when she read in San Francisco this season for Small
Press Traffic--but in a totally positive way.  Many of the people in the
audience were not familiar with her work, and hardly any had heard her read
before.  Those who knew her work only by reading it were, I think, forced
into a new reading of it by the dynamism of her performance.

The audiences this past year at Small Press Traffic events have been a
dream come true--large, supportive, and enthusiastic.  But there was an
extra thrill to those readings where the audience was taking a risk in
coming to see readers they were unfamiliar with--and feeling a sense of
payoff, the excitement of a new discovery.  When the Canadian poets Erin
Moure and Lisa Robertson read, there was a sense of magic in the air.  I
think we're all shocked when we go hear something new and actually like it,
actually feel an opening to new possibilities.

While it's vital to support one's immediate community, it's so easy to get
into the rut of only hearing the same sorts of work over and over again.
When Joan read--when Lisa and Erin read--and when Kenward Elmslie read
Friday night--I got floods of compliments about their readings, so many
that I felt embarrassed: I wish I could be as good as they are, at reading,
at transforming an audience.

By the way, the first time I ever read in public was at a group reading at
the MLA.  It was the late 70s and there were like 200 people in the
audience, and I wore white painters pants, the kind with the loops on the
outer thighs.

This is Kevin Killian, returning to list after long Christmas slumber.

David Zauhar wrote, "Yesterday I was talking to a friend who's a science
fiction nut,
and he asked me if I had ever heard of poets named Robert Duncan and John
Spicer. I said, sure, only it's jack spicer, why?  and he said that he
recently read in an old PKD fanzine that Dick once shared an apartment with
two poets named Duncan and Spicer . . .  Is this true? Is this common
knowledge?
        This is interesting to me because Spicer and Dick have both
asserted a notion of writing as something dictated from the outside:
Spicer's poet-as-radio is analogous to Dick's idea of getting his words
from outer space."

Dear David, as Maria Damon has told you, this is basically a true tale.
Your friend of speaking of the rooming house at 2018 McKinley at Berkeley
where Philip K. Dick lived right after graduating from high school.  This
was in the autumn of 1947.  You can find most of the details in various
biographies of Dick.  Spicer, Duncan, and Dick all lived there at the same
time, though in different apartments.  For some reason there is no plaque
on the building.

I've been writing the life of Jack Spicer for many years & the mystery
continues, exactly the mystery to which you allude, how is it that Spicer
and Dick in later life came to such similar conclusions about the source of
writing!  Apparently, when asked to verify that he had known Philip Dick,
Robert Duncan denied ever knowing him to Dick biographers.  After he was
"famous," in the early 60s, Dick wrote a kind of cute letter to Duncan
asking if he remembered him, and Duncan wrote back and said, No,which hurt
Dick's feelings.  Privately, however, Duncan told several people he knew
Dick extremely well.  So that's another mystery.

Dick was the high school pal of Jerry Ackerman, who became Duncan's
boyfriend and was the inspiration for RD's "Venice Poem."  At the time of
his death, PKD was starting work on a new novel, "The Owl at Midnight,"
which was to be an semi-autobiographical account of his time at 2018
McKinley and his encounters with Duncan and Spicer and the other roomers at
the place.  Philip Lamantia lived there too, as did George Haimsohn--who
later achieved a fame of his own on Broadway no less, as the author of the
camp parody "Dames at Sea."  Haimsohn wrote, under a pseudonym, his own
account of the period, "The Battle between the Poets and the Painters,"
which was published in a notorious gay pulp porn paperback called "Carnal
Matters."  (Robert Bertholf has acquired a copy of this volume, which is
interleaved with photos of young naked boys having sex with each other, for
the Duncan archive at the Poetry/Rare Books Collection at U C Buffalo.)

Jack Spicer, who read avidly in science fiction, was familiar with Dick's
subsequent work.  One of Dick's novels in particular is actually quite
startling to those who know Spicer's writing, for it begins at the hot dog
stand at San Francisco's Aquatic Park, as do "After Lorca," "Admonitions,"
and "Lament for the Makers" (all books by Spicer).  The name of Dick's book
is escaping me now.... is it something like "Counter Clockwise World?"
Please, Dick aficionados, help me out here.

I've gone on long enough but you get the general idea.

"And the talk, ((phone conversation secretly picked up by a cellular phone
conversation scanner between Gingrich, Tom De Lay, Dick Armey, & New't Lawyer
in which they premeditated and orchestrated the attack on the yet unreleased
findings of the House Ethics Committe) one of many that day, ended on a light
note. After the basic outlines of the statement the leaders would issue had
been agreed on, Rep. Dick Armey of Texas, the House majority leader, had
another suggestion for how Gingrich could handle the menacing accusation that
he had deliberately lied to the committee: 'I am not sure you are ready for
this, but you could quote Larry Gatlin and the Gatlin Brothers.'

  Gingrich asked, "Which one is that?"

  Armey warbled: 'I did not mean to deceive you. I never intended to push or
shove. I just wish you was someone that I love.'"   (New York Times, Friday
June 10).

Are there a few, somewhat loaded double-entendres in Dick Armey's
rhyme-capper here? If she (the Ethics Committee) is not working in your
favor, it's alright to abuse "her" and shove "her" down or out the door?
Interesting if its a nut-shell view of this group's (basically the Republican
leadership of the current Congress's) collective view not only of the Ethics
Committee, but the Government in general. Curious that the Government is
identified as a woman - is that the convention?  If "she" is not serving your
desires, shut her down.  Curious that Armey feels comfortable in basking the
save-Newt plot in honey-drip country mock sorrow. Nothing more securing than
a couplet under pressure.
I keep thinking the revelation of this tape provides at least a liberal glee
that might have been provided with the missing 22 minutes on Nixon's
Watergate tape.

Thank goodness for Kenward Elmslie at the Small Press Traffic this past
Friday evening. A sans pareil performance - Terrific poems, songs (not
without a few couplets) & such a generous soul.

In less than cold and cloud-sun-breaking-through San Francisco.

Cheers,
Stephen Vincent

Maria & other list members involved in the various threads refered to in
the subject line may be interested in a recent recording by Zeena Parkins
that is based, in part, on texts in Rotwelsch, a Yiddish-based argot used
by Jewish gangsters Germany from the 14th century into at least the late
19th century.

The disc is called "Mouth=Maul=Betrayer" & it's in the often oddly curated
Radical Jewish Culture series on the Tzadik label.  The two compositions on
the disc are Maul, where most of the Rotwelsch is, & Blue Mirror, which
deals with Jewish gangsters in the US in the first half of the 20th
century.  These aren't narrative music theater pieces, so your sense of
their use-value may vary.

likewise has his visuals / his soundsongs been compedulated? (caution:

Or, maybe I should have titled it _Ebonics: Word Up_!

The printers didn't get the book to the Cambridge booth at MLA on time --
but now available from Cambridge University Press is

_Black Chant: Languages of African-American Postmodernism_
by Aldon Lynn Nielsen

paperback is $16.95

there's also a $54.95 cloth edition for the undownsized remnant

book is guaranteed to introduce you to at least one interesting poet
you've never heard of before --  Cover is actually suitable for framing
-- wish I could offer an accompanying CD ROM, but, to quote Melville once
more, dollars damn me --

Perhaps more than any theory any discourse I most wonder about the real
life dynamics of how poets on this list who either have children or are
in everyday contact with children breath their own poetic sensibilities
onward thru their children. & by drift & by deriv� maybe posters could
tag the nonadult headcount in their households.

Bruce Andrews at the improvisation series at the old Anarchist

Just seconding Dan's thanks. It's a wonderful hybrid of _Godel, Escher,
Bach_ and _The Name of the Rose_ - I was lucky to pick it up for $5 at a
discount shop on Ponsonby Road, since I haven't seen it in the major
bookshops.

my 32-y-o son had to grow up in a house permeated with poets & nonetheless
attends KSW & other vanc'r readings. he used to write wonderful letters
when he was stalled in some shutdown harbor during his shrimpboat months,
but if he continues to write, i dont get to read it.

my 14-y-o daughter lives in-house & writes poetry. she enjoys giving
readings at which she is very good & i've availed myself of her talents a
couple times (she reads the straight lines above the lines in
"Lines"{HOHKong)). The phrases that escape her during wake-up calls are
family treasures but she wouldnt thank me for sharing. One thing she said
age 4 sticks in my mind: "the lamp is a suitcase." I think the
'pataphysicist poet Opal L. Nations was visiting at that time.

myself did not lisp in numbers but did ask age 3 for another ham sandwich,
this time w/o any bread & butter. the cognitive has remained my toy park.

Narrative as Genealogy: Sound Sense in an Era of
Hypertext by Larry Wendt

http://cadre.sjsu.edu/switch/sound/articles/wendt/nghome.htm

in excerpt from the home page:

"In the late nineteen sixties, a group of Swedish artists working as
'The Language Group' of a recently re-organized chamber music society,
known as Fylkingen along with members from the Literary Unit of the
Swedish Broadcasting Corporation, began producing a new kind of
literary work for the tape recorder. It was a form of language art
realized solely for the audio domain -- either projected from a
loudspeaker, from the radio or in some similar sonic performance venue.
In the early nineteen sixties, Fylkingen began to introduce Sweden to
all kinds of artistic experimentation contemporary to the times such as
concrete poetry, FLUXUS,electro-acoustic music, what eventually became
known as performance art, and ways of working which were called
'borderline transgressors' since they were not easily categorized as
being in any one particular field of art. "

I need a break from typesetting and design (I'm preparing Rochelle Owens'
new and selected--an astonishing book) so let me tout a book that Aldon
Nielsen may not know(?) by a wonderful Trinidadi/Brooklyn poet:

        Mervyn Taylor, _An Island of His Own_

This is his first book, and it's done well, but the reviews (all of which
were such as to warm a publisher's heart) were, except for the raves in PW,
Booklist and LJ, in what are for most of us out-of-the-way places like the
Amsterdam News and Caribbean Writer. He promises me another manuscript, but
in the way of poets I think he's having a hard time signing off on it.

The book is available from Junction Press (that's me, hence the email
address). I still have maybe 50 copies of the first printing at $9.00. SPD
may also have a couple left. There will be a new printing probably later
this year, but paper prices having gone up considerably since the 1st was
published the price will rise accordingly. email me for details (I could
send a sample poem or two).

Incidentally, if you think it's hard getting the work around in the US try
distributing in the Caribbean. After sending 20 copies to the main bookstore
and distributor in Trinidad (they never bothered to pick the first one up at
customs; it was returned
1 1/2 yrs later in parlous condition. The second batch was hand delivered)
copies were put in the window. The lot was gone in seconds. There were no
new orders, and Junction wasn't paid for a full year (after many calls and
faxes). All this despite the fact that the newspaper that owns the bookstore
had given the book a full page review.
Random House can afford that kind of tsores (you see, I do speak hebronics),
but us little fishies go broke that way.

Hugs and kisses,

Mark

(lots of little fishies swimming up my street right now, and I'm wearing a
plaid flannel shirt, my well-broke-in 501s, a navajo belt mid a bissl
turquoise, and grey and white socks. Oh, yes, and I forgot the Guatemalan
hair tie for keeping my tresses out of my eyes. It's in the 50s outside, and
we're all huddled around the space heaters.)

Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

Paul Blackburn died when his son Carlos was two. I moved in with Joan and
Carlos when he was six, and I've been Daddy ever since. Joan had pretty much
left the poetry world, altho she still saw Harry Lewis and the Mulch crew
(they put out _Halfway Down the Coast_), Brad Stark and Paul Pines. It
happened that a lot of my pals were Paul's, as well, among them Armand
Schwerner, Jerry Rothenberg, Toby Olson, Rochelle Owens, Gerge Economou,
more distantly Clayton Eshelman, and probably half a dozen others who are
out there lurking on the list (sorry), all of whom were reintroduced to the
menage. So when I mentioned to Carlos that I hadn't met a real poet until I
was maybe 18 he dismissed the statement as another tall tale. Weren't all
daddies surrounded by poets?
During our bonding period Carlos and I would take walks together in Park
Slope, where we lived. I was, and am, in the habit of picking up odd pieces
of junk on the street, evaluating them, and sticking the keepers in my
pocket for later display. I particularly like rust and gunk--a fine patina,
as it were. Carlos would look up at me with an expression that seemed to
say, "This guy is really a freak, I wonder if he's dangerous. Mom's taste in
men, after all...," and I would explain to him what I thought was wonderful
about the particular rusty bolt thay had lost its cap or the small hieratic
flange from an obscure car part. Pretty soon he'd be scouring the street,
picking up objects for me to evaluate, and I would give  a detailed critique
of each bit of broken glass or twisted wire. Then one day he came home
dragging behind him the deliciously ruinous and filthy exhaust system of a
car--I mean eight feet of it. Joan froze with horror, but I was bursting
with pride, and it pained me deeply that, in order to preserve the domestic
tranquility, I had to tell him that while it was a great, indeed monumental,
find, it would be best if he restricted himself to smaller items. That was
the moment that I realized I had been teaching Carlos to violate the first
rule of Mommydom: you don't pick things up off the street. I swear I wasn't
trying to be subversive.
That was the beginning: for the rest of his childhood I couldn't build
shelves or cabinets fast enough to contain the collection that gradually
turned his bedroom into not so much an environment as an enormous three
dimensional collage.
We would do the same routine at museums (of course we didn't get to take the
stuff home--they tend to frown on that)--we'd tell each other what we saw in
each painting. I remember the turning point after which Carlos lost the
fidgets in such places--it was the Munk show at MOMA when Carlos was maybe 7.
His eye, I'd have to say, is much better than mine.
I had, unconsciously, been training him not only in "art appreciation," but
in the appreciation of detail and in the improvisatory construction of
realities out of referents from different, often warring, systems. True
bricolage, very close to the term's humble origins.
This first manifested itself in language when he was 8 years old. He had
been asked at school to write a story about space travel. Carlos wrote an
elaborate story, somewhat reminiscent of Howard Finster, about a trip to the
end of the universe. It's final sentence was "And at the end of the universe
there is a wall, and on the other side ladies are taking showers." The
ultimate mystery for a little boy. Gee, I wish I'd written that. His
teacher, very PC, made him change "ladies" to "people," but we changed it
right back.
Carlos is 28 and still writes poetry that often astonishes me. And he shows
it to me, which is more than I could do with my father.
Nature or nurture? Who knows?

I read the book right after it came out, and was also enthusiastic about it,
but I remember being rather disappointed that it had, after all, to be
pulled into a rather tidy ending. I think I didn't want it to end at all.
But now, several years later, I can't remember what that ending was.

whether or not you might be interested in it).=20
        =20
William Slaughter is a Professor of English at the University of North
Florida. He has been a Senior Fulbright Lecturer in China (1987-88) and
Egypt (1980-81). He is the author of Untold Stories (1990), a book of
poems, and the editor of Mudlark, an electronic journal of poetry and
poetics. His poems and essays have been published in magazines ranging
from Poetry to Exquisite Corpse, different worlds.=20

"The Politics of My Heart stands apart from all other China books that
have mushroomed in the West before and after the Tiananmen tragedy.
Neither academic nor journalistic, it is the pilgrim's progress of a
poet-scholar to the Gate of Heavenly Peace.=20
     =CA=CA=CA
"When William Slaughter arrives in Beijing with his 'peculiarly American
innocence,' he celebrates the New China being built out of 'old lumber':
'New China, new music. / I'll grow new ears, / learn to hear it.' With 'a
few small careful strokes,' he goes on to capture what he hears, not so
much new music as new anguish set off by old voices of wisdom. He becomes
one with Confucius and Laozi, he loves Xue Tao for her voice, he shares
freedom of expresion with Shen Congwen and Bai Hua within the Chinese
Wall. He falls hopelessly in love.=20
     =CA=CA=CA
"But, when machine guns and tanks turn the Gate of Heavenly Peace
overnight into the killing field, the pilgrim can only 'love it bitterly,
ironically.' China has gotten under his skin, and China hurts. How can he
not give voice to 'the lips that burn but do not speak'? The Politics of
My Heart will get under your skin too. William Slaughter's heart is heavy,
but his vision is undimmed: 'As the people in 'China get bigger, the
leaders get smaller. Until no stone is left, until they're not there. At
all.'
     =CA=CA=CA
"Most of all, the simplicity and lucidity of his verse, reminiscent of the
great classical poet Wang Wei, will go straight to your heart and haunt
your memory."=20

you know, this is why poetry is great, because on a poetics listserv
there is no such thing as off topic



OR





is

Hey Graham Foust:

        Welcome to the poetics list! Maybe you've been on-line for awhile
and I haven't noticed, but in any case, glad to see you here. Excellent
reading on Saturday night at Ruthless Grip Art Project here in D.C.--I'd
like, at some point, to hear more about your "extended sequence" poem of
six-line pieces that "didn't start out that way."

        I'm glad you noticed that I used the word "clearly excellent" so
cavalierly when describing Joan Retallack's poetry. After all, as you
point out, by what given standard except that of an "avant garde" minority
could Joan Retallack's poetry be called "clear"? Isn't it, therefore, a
bit of a rhetorical stretch to suggest that Retallack's poetry offers
anything that might be defined as "clarity"? Would it not be better to
suggest, per David Bromige's recent comment for instance, that it might be
better to describe Retallack's work as "opaque as a person"?

        I agree with all of that above, which is exactly why, I think, I'm
going to continue to use the word "clarity" when describing Retallack's
work. In fact I even find what David calls "opaque" to be perfectly lucid
and clear at times--perversely, perhaps, "opaqueness" seems pretty damn
clear to me, as clear, indeed, as a person. I suppose one might say I'm
being disingenuous, or relying on a "educated" point of view regarding
poetry, but nonetheless I feel I have the right to insist that what
constitutues "clarity" to me may not constitute "clarity" to you or to a
classroom of students--which is your point exactly, I think, just turned
the other way slightly, or maybe not... turned a way, that is, that
purposely confuses
or refuses the notion of "clarity" that, for instance, one's students
carry around like the Washington Post. But I'm "perverse" this way when
I'm teaching sometimes too--I repeatedly insisted to a Modern American
Poetry class I was teaching last fall that a lot of lines in Robert Frost
"just don't make any sense" (exactly like your students use of the
phrase "all get out," a phrase I've ALWAYS loved, and use like all get
out) whereas what could possibly be "unclear" about Gertrude Stein using
words like "no" and "a" and "since." Of course, sometimes my students just
thought I was a pleasant, if somewhat loony eccentric, but others started
saying that Gertrude Stein seemed to make sense to them too. One student
actually said "She's just so clear, it's all right there, you don't have
to figure out anything." I thought so too.

I guess my point, to the extent I want one, is that while one method that
makes inroads into problematic notions of "clarity" accepts student
notions of clarity and working from there, I've often found it just as
effective to appear as bemused by them as they are sometimes by me. I
wanted them to explain to me why Robert Frost was so clear if I couldn't
understand it, and lo and behold, they couldn't seem to agree whether
Frost was for or against building fences in that famous poem whose name I
forget. My impression is that he's overtly against them and secretly for
them, but that's another day...

In any case, it sounds like what you did with that student's expression
"all get out" was the kind of thing I like to do with all sorts of phrases
that seem "clear." I mean, if you want opaqueness, obscurantism, and utter
confusion, the Washington Post can be had for only a quarter. It's a shame
that clarity continues to be much more expensive.

from Sharon Dolin's page one article in the December AWP, "Arguing Poetry:
How Contemporary Poets Write About Poetry":

        "After the more polarized stridencies of the eighties had fizzled,
a space might have been cleared for a more open appraisal of all of
poetry's possibilities. What astounds me as a third-generation free verse
poet and critic are the number of prose works by poets that are attempts
to celebrate, defend, or delegitimize free verse. Essays swing between
formalist attacks on free verse's authenticity as poetry, coupled with a
blatant desire to resurrect metrical verse as the one true poetry, and the
often fuzzy, impressionistic elaborations of a free-verse aesthetic. And
now, Language poets have entered the fray to launch their attack on free
verse, with formal verse being too far beyond the pale for them even to
mention. The question that keeps arising for me as I read the formalist
attacks as well as the free verse descriptions: Isn't it time for poets
to cease labeling free verse as merely poetry with a conspicuous absence
of meter or metrical consistency? No one would think of defining metrical
or rhythmical verse as "unfree verse," yet there is a growing tendency in
a recent spate of books by poet-critics to reframe the formal issues
surrounding free verse poetry in terms of metered verse. On the other
hand, isn't it also time for there to be a clearly elaborated poetics of
free verse?"

Good, don't tell us :-)

At the stage I've reached in the book, a tidy ending would seem
difficult, so I'll be intrigued to see how he does it (although, like
you, I'm usually averse to tidiness). I was beginning to feel that
Ressler might do some sort of Slothropian dissolve.

Does anyone else find the two main sexual relationships compellingly
erotic, with their stuttering and thwarted desires? Maybe it's just me,
but I was surprised by their effect in what I was beginning to see as a
mainly cerebral book.

The writing sometimes irritates me, as it often seems to repeat the same
idea for several paragraphs, but I'm frequently struck by some pithy or
extraordinary phrase. I should write down some of the more aphoristic
sentences - they're rich and strange, and they do interesting things in
different contexts.

I'll probably have to go back and re-read Godel Escher Bach once I've
finished. Does anyone know whether Powers has mentioned Hofstadter
(?spelling? it's 5.30am) as a source or inspiration?

recent exchange around Mark's comment on Joan's verse interesting from an
historic point of view as well -- MUCH discussion of clarity among Black
Mountain poets and fellow fellahin some two-three decades ago -- clarity
became the calling card of Creeley and others for a time -- but this was
not the clarity of transparency -- rather, precisely, clarity of language
in thinking with the objects of this world (the Zuk/Oppen influence most
_clear_ here) --

BUT, Mark's original post didn't claim that Joan's poetry was clear
(which I think it is), but that it is clearly excellent, an entirely
different sort of claim -- but that might reopen a very old argument on
this list, so I'll leave it there --

voice as he sang."

"However, I have noticed all together TOO FEW listings of recent publications
by list participants. "

sez Charles B. So here's one:

RSE 4PACKS No 1:
SLEIGHT OF FOOT

Miles Champion
Helen Kidd
Harriet Tarlo
Scott Thurston

A collection of lengthy selections (up to 18pp each) from four poets who had not
at the time of commissioning had a substantial book of their own published, and
who are working in the innovative and modernist traditions of other authors on
the RSE list. RSE hopes this will be the first in a series of similar
mini-anthologies showcasing younger and/or less well exposed poets.

Funding from London Arts Board/Eastern Arts Board gratefully acknowledged.

1-874400-10-5   5.00 pounds
200 x 120mm paperback   80pp

Those of you who were at the University of New Hampshire shindig last year will
remember Miles Champion, the man who reads five times as fast as Tom Raworth.
Harriet Tarlo was also there giving a paper, although she didn't read. They are
two of the brightest sparks on the UK poetry scene and are likely to be of
interest to many subscribers to this list. Scott Thurston (a young British poet
currently working in Poland) and Helen Kidd are also eminently worthy of being
checked out.

The 4Packs series is a new venture by Reality Street Editions. This first
volume, published in November in the UK, should be reaching Small Press
Distribution (510-549-3336) any day now and should retail at around $8 or $9. If
anyone running a mag would like a review copy please email me.

_Village Voice_ for 1/14/97 has quite good short piece by Angela Ards
bringing some welcome perspective to Ebonics debates (along with some
less enlightening sidebars -- though I did enjoy the one where the
_Voice_ asks NY school kids what they think of all this) [[have also been
told that _Washington Post_ for 1/12 has piece on this subject by Robert
Hass -- haven't eyeballed this one myself yet -- but it should be up on
the _Post_ website now]]


AND same issue of _Voice_ has a good piece on the career of Josh White --
I had the very good fortune to meet White a few times around DC, where he
spent many of his latter years -- He continued to be a compeeling
performer, and he was always willing to share memories of the old NY
cabaret scene with a young pest --

Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

My thanks to Stephen Vincent for bringing discussion of Ebonics
to this group. Some have asked to see the language of the Oakland
School Resolution, so I went digging in the electronic files of the
San Francisco Chronicle. (You can search for other local articles
in the SF Chronicle and Examiner at this address: http://www.sfgate.com/
.)

What follows is the text of the original Oakland School Board
resolution on Ebonics. Bringing up the rear is an article on the
revised resolution from the San Francisco Chronicle.

Easy to see that the school board is afflicted by educationese,
a jargon that should not be taught to anyone.

But by far the most interesting news has to do with the weeks of
racist response on the part of whites, both liberals and conservatives
(at last, an issue that unites them!), and the squirming-with-discomfort
of middle-class African Americans who aren't too sure they want to
hear about differences in dialetic going back to Africa.

OK, the texts:

EBONICS RESOLUTION

         The Oakland School Board says its resolution on ebonics has
been widely
         misunderstood, especially on whether it calls for teaching
classes in ebonics. Critics said
         the school board members are muddying the debate by not
standing behind the resolution
         they passed.

         Here is the text of the resolution passed on December 18:

         WHEREAS, numerous validated scholarly studies demonstrate that
African-American
         students as a part of their culture and history as African
people possess and utilize a
         language described in various scholarly approaches as
``Ebonics'' (literally ``Black
         sounds'') or ``Pan-African Communication Behavior'' or
``African Language Systems'';
         and

         WHEREAS, these studies have also demonstrated that African
Language Systems are
         genetically based and not a dialect of English; and

         WHEREAS, these studies demonstrate that such West and
Niger-Congo African
         languages have been officially recognized and addressed in the
mainstream public
         educational community as worth of study, understanding or
application of its principles,
         laws and structures for the benefit of African-American
students both in terms of positive
         appreciation of the language and these students' acquisition
and mastery of English
         language skills; and

         WHEREAS, such recognition by scholars has given rise over the
past fifteen years to
         legislation passed by the State of California recognizing the
unique language stature of
         descendants of slaves, with such legislation being
prejudicially and unconstitutionally
         vetoed repeatedly by various California state governors; and

         WHEREAS, judicial cases in states other than California have
recognized the unique
         language stature of African-American pupils, and such
recognition by courts has resulted
         in court-man dated educational programs which have
substantially benefited African
         American children in the interest of vindicating their equal

Ebonics Plan Toned Down In Oakland
School board expected to OK revision this week

San Francisco Chronicle - Jan. 13, 1997

Lori Olszewski, Rick DelVecchio, Chronicle East Bay Bureau

         The task force behind the ebonics policy that put the Oakland
schools at the center of a
         national cultural war announced yesterday that it will strip
the policy of its controversial
         language -- and the school board, for the first time, appears
ready to back the change.

         ``The debate is over,'' said Sylvester Hodges, a former school
board member who now
         heads the Task Force on the Education of African American
Students, which proposed
         the policy. ``We're moving to the next phase. . . . We hope
people understand that and
         will join us.''

         After a tense three weeks in which everyone from Rush Limbaugh
to Maya Angelou
         weighed in on the policy, the seven-member Oakland School Board
has indicated it will
         approve the changes at a special meeting Wednesday. The
compromise, an effort to quiet
         the national brouhaha, comes after at least 10 hours of
negotiations in the past two days
         and after weeks of meetings among the key players. None of the
players characterizes the
         move as backing down.

         As late as Friday, board member Toni Cook, who carried the
original resolution, said in
         an interview with The Chronicle that she was opposing changes.

         Cook said she reversed her position because the task force --
composed of Oakland
         residents and school district employees -- agreed to the
changes. Cook and other
         supporters of the task force did not want to appear as if they
were caving in to national
         criticism and big-footing the task force.

         CHANGES IN 2 AREAS

         The proposed changes in the resolution primarily involve two
areas -- the suggestion that
         such language is related to genetics and any phrases the public
took as meaning the
         schools would be teaching in ebonics.

         The task force deleted a phrase saying African Language
Systems, or ebonics, are
         ``genetically based'' and not a dialect of English. The new
wording: such African systems
         ``have origins in West and Niger-Congo languages and are not
merely dialects of
         English.''

         The group also recommended striking a clause that has been
widely taken to mean that
         the city's schools would begin teaching ebonics as well as
standard English.

         If the board adopts the changes as expected, the policy would
no longer refer to
         instructing children in both languages. It says the purpose of
recognizing black students'
         language differences is ``to move students from the language
patterns (students) bring to
         school to English proficiency.''

         The task force further suggests the policy is for
``facilitating the acquisition and mastery of
         English language skills, while respecting and embracing the
legitimacy and richness of the
         language patterns, whether they are known as `Ebonics,'
`African Language Systems,'
         `Pan African Communication Behaviors,' '' or something else.

         Another controversial passage of the resolution states that the
school board recognizes
         African- based systems as the ``predominantly primary language
of African American
         students.'' The task force now wants to take out the adverb
predominantly. The revised
         line: African-based systems are ``the primary language of many
African-American
         students.''

         GROWING COMMUNITY PRESSURE

         The agreement to compromise comes amid growing community
pressure for the changes,
         including public statements by school board members Ken Rice
and Robert Spencer
         urging changes to the language. New board member Jason Hodge
also had said privately
         he wanted the changes and would be going public with his
criticisms today if the board
         could not agree this weekend.

         The task force and the school board stressed they are still
behind the intent of the original
         resolution, to train teachers to respect ebonics and to help
the students who speak it to
         learn standard English. The task force is to present
Superintendent Carolyn Getridge with
         a financing plan by March 15 on how to expand the ebonics
teaching methods now in
         place in about 26 schools involving 3,600 students to more
schools as soon as this fall.
         The effectiveness of the ebonics program will be evaluated by
measures such as test
         scores and truancy and suspension rates, board members have
said.

         The task force also has a number of other recommendations on
how to improve black
         students' performance, such as recruiting more black teachers
and counselors, that have
         gotten lost in all the hoopla about the ebonics policy.

         Before the weekend, task force members had held fast to their
original resolution, as the
         school board and administrators struggled to convince critics
that the policy was vital to
         correct the failing performance of its African American
students. Oakland is the only
         school district in California where black students make up the
majority.

         A DISMAL RECORD

         The average grade-point average of the district's African
American secondary students is
         a D-plus, or 1.8. Of students who repeat the same grade, almost
two-thirds are African
         American.

         African Americans make up 53 percent of the district's 52,000
students but 71 percent of
         all students enrolled in special education.

         Despite the dramatic story told by such numbers, in the end it
appeared that no amount of
         talking around the ebonics resolution could fix the document
itself, with its ambiguities and
         sloppy phrasing.

         ``We'll not sacrifice our African American children for the
sake of politics,'' Hodges said.
         He said he is proud that the task force was the catalyst of a
national debate over black
         students' chronic underachievement.

         ``You've been the brunt of unfair and often racist attacks,''
school board President Jean
         Quan said of the task force. She said the proposed changes
appear to be a ``very fair
         attempt'' to clarify the resolution, adding that the board will
not retreat until all students in
         the district are proficient in standard English.


         REVISION TO POLICY

         Some of the changes made in the text of the proposed ebonics
policy by the Oakland
         schools task force:

         -- Before: ``Whereas, these studies have also demonstrated that
African Language
         Systems are genetically based and not a dialect of English.''

         -- Changed to: ``Whereas, these studies have also demonstrated
that African Language
         Systems have origins in West (African) and Niger-Congo
languages and are not merely
         dialects of English.''

         -- Before: ``Whereas, the standardized tests and grade scores .
. . will be remedied by
         application of a program featuring African Language Systems
principles in instructing
         African-American children both in their primary language and in
English.''

         -- Changed to: ``Whereas, the standardized tests and grade
scores . . . will be remedied
         by application of a program featuring African Language Systems
principles to move
         students from the language patterns they bring to school to
English proficiency.''

         -- Before: ``The Superintendent . . . shall immediately devise
and implement the best
         possible academic program for imparting instruction to
African-American students in their
         primary language for the combined purposes of maintaining the
legitimacy and richness of
         such language.''

         -- Changed to: ``The Superintendent . . . shall immediately
devise and implement the best
         possible academic program for the combined purposes of
facilitating the acquisition and
         mastery of English language skills, while respecting and
embracing the legitimacy and
         richness of the language patterns.''

        Could someone (Dodie?) post a little more detail about the recent
Elmslie reading?  How does he integrate the songs and the poems into one
performance?  Is the effect smooth or jarring?  Does he do mostly recent
work, or does it range over his long career?
        Just digested -The Champ- myself, still trying to decide whether a
cohesive narrative would emerge with closer/more numerous readings.

No - I've seen it.  Check out the Celestis Webpage where they offer to send
your "cremains" into space on a missle.  I have the video for this company

Maybe we should do renga essay from the list with our own categories
of contemporary poetry. I've always thought of American poets in terms
of poor, medium well-done, and sexually ambivalent, but I do realize
those are sort of arbitrary distinctions.

Mark, et al--My mother-in-law died in New York City, March 1983. When we
were arranging things, the funeral parlor guy said "What do you want to do
with the cremains," and I stopped him right there & said "What did you say,
what was that word?" Sure enough, cremains. Can't remember now whether it
was Broadway or Amsterdam Avenue, Washington Heights area. So it's real,
or real funeralese. We had them shipped to Maine & set them loose on an
outgoing tide, with some apple blossoms.     Sylvester Pollet

Sherry Brennan's posting re "cremains" being sent into outer space will
recall to some the movie made of evelyn waugh's novel "The Loved One": in
the movie (tho not the book) this is precisely what is done. And the movie
must have been made as early as 1962, i think. db

"Clarity alone can lead to freedom" -Barnett Newman
"Don't look at me, I'm ugly in the morning" - Faith No More

I wouldn't think you're "perverse," Mark, but rather "for verse," which
is why I posted to the list rather than asking the guy in the cubicle
next to me at work.  Clarity can be expensive, although we got it for
free on Saturday night when Sherry Brennan read her amazing poems at the
Ruthless Grip. Sherry had not done a reading in something like 10 years,
but what we got was certainly worth the wait.  Stunning lyric essays on
the unplummable by way of Youngstown and "the middle of nowhere."  Thanks
for bringing her down, Mark.

I think we probably agree on the importance of clarity, but like your not
necessarily wanting to have a point, I guess I don't want to have a clear
idea of what incredible is.  Demanding clarity doesn't always mean
demanding a prescribed KIND of clarity, so the issue of clarity is not
always, ahem, clear to me.  But as someone pointed out (I can't remember
who and I'm in Word Perfect now, sorry!), this could lead to an old and
messy discussion, so I'll leave it at that.

My real curiosity, though, is how we go about teaching poetry (and the
phrases which prompted my post, "should be familiar with" and "clearly,
incredible" sounded teacherly to me) to people who are not necessarily
knowledgeable about  even "mainstream"/canonized poetry.  When I taught
the Celan/Merwin/Oppen/Berryman class, I didn't look at these poets in
the context of more "official" poets (although we did read some prose:
_The Diary of Anne Frank_, Berryman's "The Imaginary Jew" and Denis
Johnson's _The Stars at Noon_), and I found that I didn't have to.  The
majority of the students came to enjoy, understand, and learn from all
four of these poets, and while they challeged some of my
assertions/opinions concerning all four, they never really went back to
"confusing as all get out" after about the first week.  Together, the
poets and the students made all kinds of sense all over the place (and a
lot of sense that I hadn't made myself yet).

By limiting my class to four poets, they were forced to deal with just
those four, and therefore those four poets received a serious semester's
worth of attention from thirty readers.  But is that a wise way to teach
an undergraduate poetry class?  I still don't know.  Sometimes it seems
like I was just plain lucky (classes are very dependent on the class
itself, and mine was a very engaged, very open group of students for the
most part).  It sounds like Mark's class worked just as well by comparing
Stein and Frost, although I've seen that lead to "well, you like Stein
better, I like Frost better, let's call the whole thing off," which
really prevents any forward progress from being made and is about the
most frustrating thing I've ever experienced as a teacher.

Poetry, as Jennifer Moxley says in her preface to _Imagination Verses_,
is not for the passive.  Nor, I believe, is it for the evasive, which is
where clarity comes into play.  But seeing as how these fixed
versions of what's poetry/sensible/clear and what's not (not to mention
rampant
passivity) are out there, how can we, as poets and teachers, best deal
with them directly?

Does concentrating our attention on a few poets really work?  Is it
helpful to go from Beowulf to Bei Dao in 4 months?  It's confusing as
all get out, I think.


Bests,

Graham

Miekal,

Can't say much about bp on the internet, though Kenny G's ubuweb homepage
reproduces a couple of his early poems.  But on a related note, about two
years ago McClelland and Stewart published *An H in the Heart: a bpNichol
Reader*.  Ironically, though, Nichol claimed in a mid-80s interview
("Syntax = the Body Structure" in *Line*) that he would never publish with
the commercial press M & S.  While the editors, George Bowering and
Michael Ondaatje, should be commended for trying to bring Nichol's writing
to a larger audience, the book tends to decontextualize Nichol's work from
the type of challenge that his minimal forms and mimeographed ephemera
offered to commercial publishing.  Even the book's reproduction of Nichol
and Steve McCaffery's collaborative game for generating a contemporary
research title seems to come across more like a farce than as a challenge
to traditional reading habits, especially when it is taken out of the
context of the politicized discourse of a small press like *Open Letter*,
where Nichol's and McCaffery's research reports first appeared. It seems
to me that *An H in the Heart* gives us a socially normalized Nichol, a
kind of "classic rock" version reminescent of those easily digestible old
Viking Portable Faukners and Joyces.

The quintessential Nichol bibliographer is jwcurry, who himself has produced
a number of small-sized pamphlets, some of them hand-rubber-stamped, by
Nichol & others. Curry's in Toronto, and I don't have his address at hand,
but someone here may have it. The situation of McLelland & Stewart
publishing Nichol is complicated as well because McLelland & Stewart
acquired Coach House Press in some sense, while leaving it a
semi-independence, I believe. Or perhaps it's just that they became the
distributor for Coach House. Does someone know for sure?

All of the Martyrology has been re-published in recent years, but not in
anything approaching one volume -- I don't imagine that would be possible or
desirable. Many other books are still in print, including Chax's art facts:
a book of contexts, which is a body of diverse works Nichol planned as part
of the trilogy including love: a book of remembrances, and zygal, all of
which he intentionally gave to different small presses; and later another
book which I think of as linked to these was posthumously published: Truth:
A Book of Fictions (art facts was also posthumous, although the manuscript
was completed and sent to me by bp just a few weeks before his death -- in
fact, it was the desire to publish this book and make it available as widely
as possible which transformed chax from strictly a limited edition book arts
publisher into a trade literary publisher as well).

Several years before An H in the Heart, As Elected (a selected works) came
out from Talonbooks, and I don't know if that is still available or not, but
I believe it contains more of Nichol's visual work than does An H in the
Heart, and I generally like it as an intro to Nichol, although it is a
rather poorly produced book whose pages yellow and fall out before much time
has gone by.

The marvelous Translating Translating Apollinaire by Nichol is available at
the Light & Dust Poets web site. The Nichol work's URL is
http://www.thing.net/~grist/l&d/bpnichol/lnichol1.htm
Much else of value is also available at this marvelous site put together by
Karl Young.

Was happy to have been at the Elmslie performance last Friday here in SF.
Kenward read first and then performed the song part of the program which
became a sort of endless finale - His relationship with the audience was
intense, but light - He really had us in the palm of his hand.

There is a continuous tone in his work from the poems to the songs of a
kind of dignified speechy camp. The roughness of the presentation - simple
headress, other modest props, the large postcards held up by a friend - the
music on a boom box, but timed quite precisely - is an effective and savvy
restraint.

The music was various - show tunes, torch songs, Country Western, Cajun and
his own songs(in these styles) - and Kenward's presence and attention as a
performer and his playful, evocative diction as a writer held it together
quite well - We gave him a standing ovation and there was an encore - I
think the environment of New College and the graciousness of the SPT series
- not to mention the great party after at Kevin and Dodie's - lent much
glamour to the already heady occasion.

(Btw - we have 3 tapes of Kenward Elmslie at the Poetry Center - 75, 83 and
90 - all available.)

send it in; that's how dictionaries are "written," you know.  when i was
an undergrad some 15 yrs ago, i took this great course called "american
english" and we used to send stuff in to merriam-webster all the time.  in

Borden's "Cremora" Non-Dairy Creamer is the stuff that creeps me out.
Right up there with Adolf's Meat Tenderizer in the supermarket twilight

Hawaiians strive for unity

The Maui News
Sunday, January 5, 1997

By VALERIE MONSON

Staff Writer

LAHAINA -- The Native Hawaiian voices of Maui that weren't heard on Oahu
last month let loose with a cry of unison Saturday that most certainly will
echo around the islands.

``This was one of the best meetings I've attended in 20 years,'' said
Charles Kauluwehi Maxwell Sr., one of the organizers of the five-hour
gathering held in the social hall of Waiola Church. ``Maui is going to set
the trend as to how to be unified . . . Everything is going to snowball
from this.''

About 75 people were asked by Maxwell to ``leave their egos and
affiliations outside the door'' as they braved the downpour that pummeled
Lahaina most of the day. So those who walked in as members of Ka Lahui, The
Nation of Hawaii, the recently disbanded Hawaiian Sovereignty Elections
Council or any other organization became part of the group at hand and not
a separate faction.

The theme for the day was unity.

``Everybody was in one heart and one mind, I think,'' said Maxwell.

The meeting came about because of the disappointment experienced by Mauians
who attended a statewide conference on Oahu last month regarding the next
step in the sovereignty process. After the exhilaration of the results of
the Native Hawaiian Vote in September in which 73 percent of the
respondents said they wanted some form of self-rule, participants went to
Honolulu with high hopes of moving forward.

They returned discouraged, feeling they had not been heard.

So with another statewide gathering planned for Feb. 8-10 at Kualoa Park on
Oahu, Native Hawaiians of Maui Nui -- the ``greater Maui'' area of Maui,
Molokai, Lanai and Kahoolawe -- decided to take their own step forward
Saturday.

The very notice of the meeting caused a stir around the islands, according
to Maxwell.

``I had calls from all over the state asking, `What is this all about?' ''
he said. ``I said, `We're getting ourselves together.' ''

By the end of the day, no delegates had been elected nor official policies
etched in stone, but consensus was achieved on a number of things that
formed a mission statement of sorts.

Akoni Akana and Ed Lindsey both came up with several key goals that the
crowd unanimously agreed upon. Those in attendance enthusiastically
committed themselves to ho`olokahi (peace and unity) while pursuing
self-determination or sovereignty in some form and to get back their land
rights, their ocean rights, their birth rights as Native Hawaiians and
their water rights. They also dedicated themselves to the concept of Maui
Nui -- and not just Maui -- in decisions.

Akana, who said he'd never seen so many people at a sovereignty meeting on
Maui before, reminded his peers that conflicting factions only hurt
themselves.

``The government enjoys the differences -- they want us to be divided,'' he
said.

Lindsey concurred.

``We have not been able to play our Hawaiian card in this political process
because we're not united,'' he said. ``How are we going to proceed toward
working for the same thing, to come together, to accomplish the same thing?
We're not here to say, `I'm better than you,' we're all good. Who's our
worst enemy? Not them. Us!

``In Lahaina, there's development going on that's against us. The more we
milimili (move slowly), the more they're going to take. Do you want that?''

Everyone responded with a resounding ``No.''

Kekula Bray-Crawford supported the idea of unity, too, as long as diversity
was not lost in exchange.

``I want unity, but I also want to know about the differences,'' she said,
hoping everyone would be allowed ``to disagree and (know) why we disagree.''

``That's consensus, to me,'' she said. ``To find strength in diversity.''

Dana Naone Hall said her only interest in sovereignty ``stems solely from
my desire to protect the land, water and places important to our kupuna.''

Earlier, she said Hawaiians need to take advantage of the current mood in
high places on Oahu and Washington, D.C., before the political scene
becomes more hostile.

``Inevitably, the state and federal governments will be involved . . . ,''
she said. ``Are we at the point where we will seize the day and move
forward or will this process drag on until the political landscape changes?
The pendulum swings both ways, you know.''

Hall also recommended that when it comes time to decide on apportionment
for delegates, that a land base be used to determine the number of elected
representatives, not population. The fear, obviously, was that Oahu would
overwhelmingly control things if only population is considered.

Many Native Hawaiians opposed the vote last year because the state was
underwriting the costs and Gov. Ben Cayetano had appointed members of the
Hawaiian Sovereignty Elections Council.

As part of a response to that, Maxwell said a fund-raising concert will be
held Jan. 17 to earn money for anyone who would like to participate in the
February conference at Kualoa Park. Details about the concert will be
released later.

The group Saturday was not only a mixture of those affiliated with various
sovereignty organizations, but also a blend of age groups with articulate
young leaders of the future joining in along with the kupuna.

And it was kupuna Kealoha Camacho who may have made the most heartrending
observation about the urgency needed to spark the movement that started
more than 20 years ago.

``It can happen in your time,'' she said to those around her. ``For us
kupuna, we're makule (old) now. Our time has gone.''

I just wanted to put in a strong recommendation that people visit the light
& dust poets sight (http://www.thing.net/~grist/l&d/lighthom.htm) and check
out Robert Grenier's tribute to Larry Eigner. It takes a few minutes, but I
suggest looking at all 45 pages of this physically beautiful, moving work.

Aloha / Alii,

This may be of interest to members of all the three lists.  The
international community--all of us--have come a long way since Gro
Brundtland's international body of experts gave us _Our Common Future_.
With all the endless ontological differences being valorized in other
intellectual/philosophical traditions as the "proper" bases of peoples'
and nations' existences, I wonder how a "common future" can emerge from
all these.  But apparently, there have been successes at many levels.  I
tend to agree with this last point.  I haven't checked out "Inviting
Debates's" URL, but encourage all to participate in this discourse about
planetary ecological stewardship.

Mahalo for you time, and interests.

Well, as long as I've inadvertently started this funereal thread...

Some years ago I was boarding a commuter flight from Boston to New York. As
I walked down the aisle to my seat past rows of unconcerned business people
in expensive suits reading their copies of the New York Times I was suddenly
and unaccountably overwhelmed with bitterness, and I said to myself, "These
people don't even know that they're about to die.
It wasn't until then that I realized I was afraid.
I found my seat between two other passengers. The flight started pleasantly
enough, but shortly after nightfall we hit some serious turbulence, and I
could imagine the plane suddenly tilting into a steep dive and screaming its
way towards the earth. At such moments I try to console myself that at least
the whole ordeal won't take very long--if I can control my panic for two or
three minutes it will all be over.
I had just come from a week at my girlfriend's commune, and I was filled
with peace and love; that's probably why I found myself thinking that our
last moments might be easier if my fellow passengers and I held hands.
I hadn't really looked at them til then. Neither of them seemed at all
concerned by the turbulence. To my left was a middle-aged woman who looked
like she ate steel bolts for breakfast. She used her newspaper was to create
a wall to discourage conversation. Definitely not the hand-holding type. To
my right, in the window seat, was an extremely neat man in his early
twenties. He wore a reddish tweed sport jacket,a dress shirt and tie, grey
slacks and highly polished brown shoes. He was immaculate. He appeared to be
one of those untouchable people who scatter the dust before them.
I mention all this because I was aware that there was something odd about
him, and it took me a few moments to home in on what it was. Then I noticed
his hands. They were clean. In fact, they were the cleanest hands that I had
ever seen. They were so clean that the thought of holding them was utterly
disgusting.
By now the turbulence had stopped, and the man and I began to talk. He asked
me what I did. I told him that I was studying in a training institute. He
said that he was, too, and I asked him which one. I hadn't heard of it,
which surprised me.
My world at the time was parochial enough that I assumed that, like me, he
was a psychotherapist in training, so when I asked him what he was studying
I expected him to tell me whether he was a Reichian, or a psychoanalyst, or
the like.
Mortuary Science, he answered.
That was it. That was why his hands and his whole being were so clean--he
had been soaking in formaldehyde. For a moment my gorge rose as I imagined
the smell of overpickled rats and frogs from high school bio lab.
Curiously, he wasn't at all embarassed by his profession, whereas I was
always wary of people's responses when I revealed my own.

Funny you should ask, as yesterday I was at the new (old) Caoch House
with Robin Blaser trying to get ahold of the old (new) Coach House in
order to get some of Robin's books for the reading tonight.

It seems that nobody knows nuthin, or at least what they claim to know
never pans out. M&S neither acquired CH nor distributes its books.
They were storing the inventory temporarily. McClintock has offered
the authors the option of buying their books. Otherwsie they'll be
remaindered. Some other small presses such as Talonbooks have acquired
some authors' inventory, but we were unable to locate any copies of the
Holy Forest in Toronto. M&S knows nothing, Canbooks claims to have
sent everything back to the authors, and McClintock never returned our
call. So who knows.

The good news is that Bevington and Coleman are moving ahead to
rebuild the new (old ) Coach House and they have the rights to bp's

this morning, while doing my usual treadmill running
at the local "Family Fatness" gym in San Diego, i
had the unusual experience of reading the closed
captions while "watching" "good morning america."
reading tv while running or even just watching tv
while running was too much for me until just recently
as I've gotten used to running on a treadmill. before,
if i didn't pay attention to my running i'd falter
or skid on the machine.

anyway, reading closed captioned stuff can be very
funny. the best parts of course are typos or when
people transcribing don't know what the word is and
take a stab at it. the only quote i remember was:
"and our reporter, Jane Doe, will be leer to tell
you about it."

Well, you see mark, I guess it depends on how & where you live your
life.  The only poetry class I ever had in my life was taught by a Poet
(with a capital P) named Doug Flaherty, who used words like "bone" &
"flesh" a lot in his writing.  I think Robert Lowell, Yeats & Ginsburg
were his things.  Back then I was into John Cage & Louie Z (ok & throw
in Olson).  I think what he taught me was that if you wanted to be a
poet go out there & sell yourself, every day until someone takes notice.

Very early on I decided that it was far more important to keep writing &
keep reading.  So I quit school (after one semester) & lived in the
library & wrote an 800 page long poem called Samsara Congeries, which is
my only work that has never been published.  This first hand involvement
with the text & its life taught me that the things I do to live my life
& make my art were inseparable, that going to school to "be taught" how
to write & what literature was deprived me of all the daily connections
that were my inspiration for writing to begin with.

Over the years I have met many many young folks who were incredibly
inspired to create great works while in the artificial environment of
the university but then they graduate, move out into the world (well a
lot of them never really leave the university) & are stunned to find out
that the farmer down the road cant quote Ezra Pound in his sleep.

We see it all the time at Dreamtime, young folks fed up with writing
programs, teachers, institutions, studio workshops & wanting to know
where their food comes from, how to build a decent shelter & what poems
to chant when your out in the garden weeding.

So while my own personal interests spans the gamut of things discussed
under the cover of this list, my efforts in teaching are much more
random, spontaneous & based on what is useful in everyday life.  I will
show folks how to make their own books, how to distribute, & overwhelm
them with the corpus of what has been created for them to sort out
themselves.  But you wont find me carrying on about the economies of
sentence structure in first generation language poetry.

My point is really quite brief. It what you bring yourself to, that
opens the lifelong journey of attending to language's collective
evolution. & learning to learn with in the context of your own life
experiences is far more remarkable than consuming teaching.

well, that's my belief about teaching too; that it's basically about hanging out
and sharing stuff.  i've managed to put myself in situations, mostly as a
student, with teachers who do that.  as a teacher in a mega-bureaucratic
institution it's more of a challenge,but i manage to teach topics that draw
small enough bodies of students that we can in fact develop into a community for
the 10 weeks that we're together.  i also make a point of explaining that my
style is random and that the digression is the event for me, so i try to prepare
them.  moderate success.  it was very stressful to be considered lazy and
ineffectual by my colleagues before i had tenure (the place runs on calvinist
busy-oholism), but now who cares.--md

Boy, does that ever miss the point.
Here's how I learned to be a poet. I got hooked early on the awful stuff in
my mother's HS anthology. When I was in my teens I started looking for other
poets. I read a lot. I went to readings. In school I stayed away from
writing courses, but I read "the canon," and you know, you can learn a lot
from Ben Jonson or Milton. Other poets turned me on to their enthusiasms,
and we edited each other's work. For a while I roomed with Chuck Stein--we
would read at each other for hours across the crude lilac-colored coffee
table I'd cobbled together (sometimes by the light of a yellow light
bulb--it turned the table a ghostly white). I learned from older poets, some
of whom were incredibly generous with their time. I started a reading series
and a magazine--more and more poetry.
        And I dropped out of grad school and became a psychiatric social
worker. My "rutabagaparadise." I spent 15 years looking and listening like
crazy. I don't know how many of my underclass and working class clients I
helped, but they certainly helped me to another education.
        I love teaching, and I teach in writing programs on ocasion, but I'm
very aware that these programs are there primarily to provide jobs for the
likes of me--an MFA never certified anybody as a poet. When my students ask
me what they need to know to be poets I tell them "everything."
        The other day I heard a reading by a poet all of whose references
were to books. I got the references. But I wasn't surprised that although
he's read in college courses no one beyond the walls has ever heard of him.
If we hope to have some impact on the world we have to engage it.
        Olson began his last teaching stint at Connecticut by asking the
assembled students which ones were writing majors. They raised their hands,
and he tossed them out.
        Sometimes doctors or insurance lawyers or even farmers become poets.

        So here's my grand utopian fantasy and syllabus. Let there be a
universal draft after HS, during which young men and women, separated from
their normal geography and social class, learn about each other while
repairing the infrastructure ( the least racist institution in our polity is
the military). And let no one be allowed to apply for graduate school until
they are thirty or have been out of college for at least five years,
whichever comes first.
        Try them rutabagas.

i like your post very much mark but i'd like, without meaning to completely diss
one of the gods of the list, to suggest the possibility that in this case the
"writer" might throw "writing majors" out of his class because he doesn't want
any competition?

I have no expectation that I'll ever see my fantasy actualized. But I do
think that it merits better than a cold war riposte.

Before Maria

never

again

I should say
that my hands typed
artificial when I
meant to say

Miekal who
still cant picture
David B in overhauls,
Banvel cap, & shit kickers
milking cows.  Who woulda

For those that want to
read more into more into mywords
than  my  well-intentioned mouthoffed brashness:

what I honestly am interested
in are evolved discussions of how the
act of poetry is sustainably designed
into everyday life. I choose the life of spending
my days creating an eco-village within
the remnants of an existing
150 year old dairy hamlet
because nearly everyone I know is
in there behind those cement walls
& florescent lights & very
few are out there in the front
lines of poetic terrorism.


By analogy, because the university
wanted to "teach" agriculture to farmers,
knowing most of them
would never go back to school, created
cooperative extensions, in each county,
& those ag extentions agents would
go farm to farm & introduce themselves
& offer information, support, networking.
The farmers were thus able to continue
milking but slowly change their
practices to more sustainabler methods
gradually over time.


Where did I learn about poetry really?
The overwhelming answer was by writing
& publishing & networking with literally
1000s of other writers, performance artists,
noisicians, plagiarists,  mail artists, language
poets, & small interactive arts organizations.
This is a way of life, not a curriculum that
I will graduate from & become a specialist.

Lyx (formerly Liz Was) & I am
homeschooling our son Zon.  He is 9
years old & not all that interested in learning
how to read (even tho he was into it when
he was 2),  he IS interested in collecting
animals skeletons & gluing them back
together, making a comic book to put up
at our website, learning the latin to the many
100s of plants that we grow here at Dreamtime
& he takes his turn cooking for as many as
25 people. He is precociously verbal & can
carry on a conversation with any adult on
any subject including chaos theory or the sentient
intelligence of avians.

I have tried to "teach" him how to read. He cries,
screams, throws books at me
(dont worry none of yours out there).
My observation is that the more I back
off & let him be, the easier more
naturally he learns to learn, to become
excited by ideas, to ask questions.
TO FIGURE IT OUT BY HIMSELF.
The more I become his companion
& the less I try to "teach" him,
the more our relationship becomes
a reciprocity of love & respect.

My tangled thread
is a reflexive navigation
thru what is not said
& what I see as a genuine
deep fear that poetry
will not not survive as
long as it remains separate
from all other creative
impulses known to
man.

No, the WPA wasn't mandatory -- one could always choose to remain
unemployed and unpaid --

General Hershey had a nifty version of this for me back in my youth --
It wasn't mandatory that I leave the artificial environment of college to
do social work in upstate New York; I coould have chosen to be removed
from the artificial environment of university study for the artificial
environment of an American militrary base in Viet Nam --

I could and did study and write everywhere -- but it was a whole lot
easier to get what I needed for my work while attached to a college --

odd sense of what is and is not mandatory in the American economy

Let me go a little further into dreamtime. In France all males are supposed
to spend a year in the military. I'm hazy on the details, and I'm sure
there's a bunch of ways out, and I know from riding the metro for a couple
of years that the boys capitalize on the experience by becoming drunk as
mouffettes every weekend; I'm not sure that they do very much for the
defense of the realm. The Swiss require of virtually everyone a year of
service. And most parts of the US require 12 years of incarceration in
classrooms for the young and fidgety. All societies establish institutions
whose purpose is the socializing of the young, whatever their other
functions may be. It helps them through adolescence, serves as a mild
equalizer, and enforces the sense of membership in a community. Some
societies offer something in return. In those totalitarian countries like,
say, France, university education is a limited but free commodity, and
health care aint bad. England, too, altho they may have to start imposing
some fees that would be considered derisory at any US  school. As a result,
doctors, say, don't feel justified in becoming wealthy on the back of human
suffering.
Required service is more the rule than the exception in even the most
libertarian societies.
My idea of a five year hiatus has to do with a different kind of
exploration. Years ago I taught in the psych dept. at SUNY-Old Westbury. As
some of you may know OW is designed to meet the needs of kids from, ahem,
the lower social orders, and it does, or at least did, so (I have no idea
what the situation is now) pretty well. Our kids got a decent education. At
the end of each year the psych faculty would meet informally with the
graduating majors. This was a sort of rite of passage--we could now
socialize together. But of course we were more avuncular than sociable. One
faculty member recalled that when he was in our students' shoes his advisor
had suggested that a year off in "the real world" might be advisable before
applying to graduate school. "And he was right," this dunderhead allowed.
The scion of a family of enormous wealth, he had spent the year touring
South America, from resort to resort. He got a great tan. But our students
from the ghettos were somewhat nonplussed by his story.
We tend to live in gated communities. That prof had chosen a very expensive
one for his wanderjahr. A grad program in writing can be such a place. Five
unstructured years outside the gates, it seems to me, might make the
gatedness a little bit less tolerable. And what one had to report of that
time might be an interesting new criterion for entry.
But none of this will ever happen. Most Americans still think of even
universal health care as a commie plot.
I have to typeset now.

This is of course, the academy of hard-knocks. I can relate (although my
education is from writers at the Naropa Institute). Even at Naropa, I
decided long before I tried to get that MFA that it wasn't important to the
writing of poesy. It was a credential, and it was one that I have thus far
decided (after being 26 grand in debt) that I don't need.

Bernadette Mayer was the most influential my decision not to go on. NOTE: I
have gone back and forth with this decision often. Simply because being a
working class artist, I have to work in shitty jobs (typesetting of all
fucking things) to maintain myself if I DO NOT become an academic.

Bernadette said, "if you want to get something from a poet, go to that
poet." Somehow it resonated, very Poundian, and very Ginsberg. Did AG (or
anyone else, Creely for that matter) keep up with thier education AFTER
they were out of school. Somewhat, but not really.

. I learned from older poets, some
>of whom were incredibly generous with their time. I started a reading series
>and a magazine--more and more poetry.

THIS TO ME IS THE MOST IMPORTANT VEIW. If there is such a thing as
AESTHETICS it didn't start at the academy. It started with ppl like Clayton
Eshelman & Caterpillar, when someone goes way out of the fucking way to get
a couple of hundred bucks to make a little 'zine taht publishes friends &
the noteable writers of the day. Of course you're going to publish yrself &
then... yr notable too. It's pretty simple really. But the poetry HADS to
stand on it's own!!

I do the occasional workshop to. Since I don't have an MFA at the end of my
name I have to use associations to get ppl to think (what was it a student
recently said about my bio -- "The REAL Thing"). Granted, an MFA doesn't
make a poet -- but it certifies a TEACHER to the large majority of ppl that
will pay you to teach. I can't teach in a University setting without it.
And, looking at the Formalist traditions STILL prevelant in arts education,
I think MORE of US should tech in UNIVERSITIES. (*BAD, BAD ACADEMIC* *Slap*
SLAP*)

When I was in school, at Naropa again. Anselm Hollo was a real help with my
work and a real Knight when it came to defending it. I used references upon
references & it was a dense mesh of shit I couldn't get thru now if I was
paid by the hour to footnote it. I likened myself to Olson, or Pound, or
Waldman, or someone else that was in my head. I wasn't writing for anyone
else really, but I wanted everyone to read it. I think this is the
academics hell. Or some sort of Bardo situation that likens Hell -- if I
DIDN'T come out of the habit of delusionary verses & literary references I
think I would have gone a biot madder than I already am.

HAHAHAHA. I love this story. But methinks it was for a different reason
than what you are supposing. But a good *reference* none the less.

I agree. I think Bobbie Hawkins would agree. Most of us, as writers/poets
have not lived enough to write about anything in our twenties. So if that
is the beginning of our "life's work" then we are going to be referential.
No life, man. God that's pretty depressing.


I really thank you for your comments. No one ever seems to comment on
things like this when I write them, so I thought I would write you back...
in detail to get the point across. Issues like these are REAL to the
writers on this LIST.

Thank you.

You are not the only poet out there that does not have an MFA that does not
want one & that does not need one to feel "certified" to teach.

I am a former Naropa student that when asked what my degree distinction was
answered, "um... educating the muse."

I think I am literate enough to be on this list, I know most of the ppl who
are the Buffalo-Cannon of disenfranchized poets & poetics. I read articles,
teach workshops. And wish I could teach in a University setting, but debt &
stucent loans keep me out -- so I teach in community centers & stat my own
programs, get readers like Anne Waldman & Carla Harryman out here... try to
do the best I can in a small community.

In Louisville, there are so few MFA grads that we are sought after like
doctors. Of course I opted not to get my MFA until I was thirty & a little
more mature finacially.

Right now I typeset to make my living.

I have to typeset now.

ill pass on the grand utopian fantasy and the universal draft.  but id
like my twenties well-done and the garnish of experiences on the side
please.  the military the least racist institution?  if you believe
military.  sexism and gender-bias is a whole 'nother can of birds.

Here is couple pages from the book:

MA:  General education seems to have gone.

BP:  Well not only has it gone, but the BA degree, that catch-all
diversion, is now to be patched up within employable specifics, while
the methods we have noted fit almost immediately into an income return.
        Perhaps more significant than monetary results is the recognition
through achievement, as, for example, Ana�s Nin, who early had formal
assistance, read everything in sight, chose a master to work with and
for, and then took off�not only to produce, but to affect, influence and
be someone.

MA:  How does the Institute fit into all this?

BP:  Well I�ve given the history from the earliest times down to 1989,
where there are 32 of us, free of governments, free of academics,
consider all the problems I�ve listed, but concerned with, as I�ve said,
the 3 forms of education that I�ve just noted.

MA:  Is advanced thinking different from stream of consciousness
association, altered states?

BP:  Well, the word �advanced�, as the Institute employs it, means a
rejection, a complete rejection of all past methodologies, with an
obvious forward progression in a manner that the current press
technology calls �breakthroughs�. We�re interested in producing what are
called �breakthroughs�. But at the Institute, a breakthrough is
considered anything that�s obvious, rational and reasonable, as advanced
through the greatest possible number of people. The free systems of
education already cited�learning in the womb, learning at home, study
apprenticeship�the first two of these, by modern electronic means, are
fine examples.
        I would like to give some other examples here, but before I do so, I
would like to point out�people ask me what do you do when you are doing
advanced thinking?
        And the answer is, we are making the complex simple, that whatever is
reasonable and obvious we are undertaking�and we have developed out of
this what is called the Bern Porter Theory of Simplistics, which can be
reduced more or less as follows:   It is easier to complicate things
than to simplify them. This is a manmade truism; rather than make things
simple or obvious or reasonable we tend to mess it up and complicate it.
Whatever is reasonable we make unreasonable, whatever is obvious we
obscure, whatever is easy we make it difficult, whatever is difficult we
never make it easy and whatever is complicated we tend to make it more
complicated and whatever is complicated is never made easy. So whatever
is obvious is never done, whatever is reasonable is never done.
        These are the elements of Simplistics.
        So when you ask me what is advanced thinking then it reduces to making
the complicated simple. A very staggering example that�s going on right
now in Europe, in connection with this view of looking at old things in
a new way. There are countries in Europe who�ve looked at Marxism for 40
years, who�ve looked at Leninism for 40 years, now looking at old things
in a new way. People for 40 years have been bound up with the theories
of Marx, the theories of Lenin, theories of Stalin. And in physics we�re
looking at the ideas of Newton and Einstein.  Everything is now under
re-examination.
        These people in Europe after 40 years of looking at this old thing in a
new way, will suddenly look at socialism, they will throw out communism,
they will look at democracy, and they will add to, and build upon, and
build a greater democracy, as a result of looking at an old thing in a
new way.
        And this is a part of the Theory of Simplistics that we advocate and
develop at the Institute. Please, please, look at old things, old
attitudes, common things around you, and look at them in a new and fresh
way.
        Now a very classic example of this is our friend and honorary member of
the Institute, Buckminster Fuller. He lived on an island, his family
lived on an island off the coast of Maine for about 80 years. He was
schooled by ships going by, he would row out to the ships who were
taking out lumber and bringing in paper and salt and products that were
used in Maine.
        He looked at the globe, a sphere, a globe of the Earth, 12 inches in
diameter, he looked at it for years, and said �I�m tired of looking at
this thing. What can I do to it?� Well it turned out he said �I can cut
it up.� And it turned out since it was a sphere and a globe, a model of
the Earth, each section he cut up had to be a triangle. Having cut it up
into triangles, he laid the triangles on the floor flat and looked at
them in a fresh and new way, and to his amazement he could understand
the meaning of the equator, the tropic of Cancer, the tropic of
Capricorn, the north pole, the south pole, the relation of the lands to
the water; he could see the world and the continents in a new way. He�d
been hampered all his life by a globe, now suddenly the globe was
reduced to pieces and the pieces were flat on the floor, a flat surface,
two-dimensional. He was able then to see in a fresh way. This is for us
a very classic example of looking at old things in a new way.
        The people of Europe are now looking at old systems of communism,
Marxism and the rest, and are seeking a new way, what we call a
breakthrough.
        Another very interesting example is a solution to problems�take a
simple thing like gun laws, or guns, handguns. It is said nationwide,
worldwide, that handguns are a problem. Well if they�re a problem then
isn�t it obvious that you attack them by first not permitting their
manufacture anywhere in the world? Stop their manufacture. Then find
people who own them, actually go door to door and remove them. Either
their owners pay a fine or give up their handgun; and prevent, stop the
sale. Just remove handguns from all markets, from all use, and make them
disappear, just decree that they are a problem.
        Well obviously this will never be done.  Just the same as the school
system that I have advised, and the womb studies, probably will never
come about. This is typical of man in his continual desire, innate
desire to make messes. To make complicated what is already complicated,
and never, never to simplify.
        So in the case of the handgun, I�ve mentioned the globe, now we might
go on to a thing that�s called a 40- hour week. We have unemployment. We
have the trouble of what to do with our leisure time, and how to make a
livelihood, and the problem is what do we do about this. Well, the
problem is the 40-hour week, the 5-day workweek, holidays, weekends. In
short our present entire system of employment is eliminated. The 24
hours of each day and the 7-day week are divided into 3 shifts of 8
hours each. No one works more than 32 hours a week, that is, four 8-hour
periods, in a shift period of his choice, while production proceeds
continuously, full time, for 168 hours a week.
        When I was considering this, a 72-story skyscraper was being built
across the street. Under the present system, the site is literally
crawling with workers for 40 hours, then stops dead deserted for 128
hours. A total standstill, with nothing else happening except a guard on
watch, patrolling. Now under the plan of the Institute, the work would
proceed 168 hours a week, many workers would have employment, and the
building would be finished in one-fourth the time. And as a further
effect, the present pool of unemployed would be absorbed. Apprentices
would be training to fill in this and future needs, with every
able-bodied person having a paying job for 32 hours, but without
overtime. The resulting leisure hours would be obvious for each person,
opening a whole new range of possibilities. Where some critics would
suggest that crime, alcohol, drugs, auto accidents, thefts would
increase, the reverse would be nearly true, where suddenly people would
be finding time to do what they truly always wanted to do, but never
did, because they �had to go to work.� Hobbies would thrive, for the
healthy betterment of everyone. It�s interesting that in connection with
this time-rearrangement, one�s personal 24 hour day would best be
divided into four 6-hour segments for easy planning and survival, that
is, from six in the morning to noon, from noon to six at night, from six

people who are unemployed, and put everyone to work in something he

hey miekal, what you call finger shaking is me defending myself against your
prejudices and cliches and assumptions about my inner life based on yours.  i
love your energy, your spontaneity, your truthfulness to your vision.  i support
your work and i have felt supported by you in some of my creative endeavors.  i
don't appreciate your need to indict or condescend to everyone who has chosen a
different path, or thru circumstances, ended up doing something other than
living at dreamtime village.  i'm sorry if you  feel publically scolded; for my
part, i feel  dismissed by a certain tenor of triumphalism in your
proclamations.

Everybody's path is his/her own. And I'm sure as hell not calling any of
them "artificial." But we do tend to value the individual over the communal
to an extraordinary and I think unsustainable degree, and the place gets
less and less liveable--whatever place--as a result.
Look, poets--marginals of all sorts--have to live with all manner of
sometimes degrading ambiguities. The troubadors who sang for their supper at
Raymond de Troncavel's table no less, maybe more, than we. You do what you
have to, and I'm certainly not, from my somewhat privileged position (I
don't have to be a wage slave), criticizing anyone else's choices. I do
worry about the institution (all of them) and the society. And I welcome
other people's hairbrained solutions. I do know that when people work and
play and live together they're less likely to burn down each other's houses.
Or at least I hope so.
And I have to tell you, while my green undergraduates are fun to teach, the
"returned students" (often that means folks who were raising kids in their
late teens and twenties and never got to higher ed to start with) are a hell
of a lot more challenging. Like, they know a lot more that I don't.
I guess I knew this would be controversial. A lot of house cats never
criticize their baskets. And it may be that we/they/I sleep in the best of
all possible baskets.

With all due respect, Dan: you must be plumb loco to make that kind of
statement. Or just uninformed.

All this talk about the university as "artificial" strikes me as absurd. How
is it any more artificial than the corporate environment? I'll state the
obvious here: culture = artifice - and it's better than living in the woods.
 A university *is* a corporation. It's designed to turn a profit by
producing a product - education. Or a facsimile thereof. That's what people
seem to objecting to here. Unfortunately, the idealism engendered by a love
of learning does seem to be often at odds with the bottom line. On the other
hand, I've read on this list someone rather melodramatically comparing the
university to a prison: try working at a life insurance company for a few
months. It'll suck the marrow right out of your soul!

Who's talking about warfare? There are other forms of public service.

Nor is this a discussion of artifice vs nature--not on my part, at least.
But note in passing that universities don't actually make profits--that's
why they need grants and endowments to operate. (They do share with private
sector business the tendency of bureaucracies to try to become immortal.) In
most countries universities are paid for out of taxes, the same as freeways:
they're seen as a necessary part of the infrastructure.

It really isn't necessary to defend the universities and the life they
promote. While funding cuts happen, I don't think the institution is in any
danger of disappearing, and I'm far from proposing that we burn them down.
Some of my best friends are universities. Isn't anybody else out there
concerned about the interface or lack thereof with the rest of the
culture/society and the impact that may have on our lives as writers? Is to
ask the question the same as threatening to take away the goodies? (Reminds
me of the moment at the beginning of the Gulf War when I asked my students
to imagine the issues from Saddam Husein's point of view. They told me that
they couldn't do it because it would be unpatriotic)

I've deeply appreciated the infusion of energy and new perspectives on the
list of late.  I also like the "sustainability" thread because the issue
of where and how one, a writing one, how *I* might draw sustenance from
the world/culture we live in is a crucial one.  But as we critique the
institutions around us (and they do deserve critique) i wld be happier
if we cld do it without reviving the old Academy vs The Real Thing
war that the list has been thru *so* many times before.  Some of us
are "in" the academy, some are "in" someplace else, some are half-in,
half-out, half-assed or just plain ain't sure -- but anyway you slice it
we'd be better off attending to each other's voices than making leaps
to judgment about world-views, assumptions etc. based on what we think we
know someone's wageplace.  Whew, don't know about you but i feel better.

on the ecobalance sustainability list Im boiled in bees because I
mentioned 4/4 music & 1 4 5 changes are derived from "dead white man's

maybe western aesthethic tradition is a better phrase?

Quickly:

Nope, there is no one-volume _Martyrology_ but there is that uniform
reprint set that Coach House Press did before it went under in 1996.

There is a gink at Simon Fraser University (where the bp papers are) who is
planning a bpNichol home page. His name is Carl. You ought to hear from him
on this list, I think. Carl Peters.

We are trying to get him to change his name to Pater Carlos Peters.

This gets right to the historical point, thank you Aldon.  I just get
leery when I here "utopia" & "5-yr military service" in the same sentence.
I know that ain't exactly what you said, Mark Weiss: I just get leery.
In my little burg, you'd be surprised how many of the serious community
projects are supported & underwritten by those "artificial institutions"
like colleges, churches, & community organizations.  At the core of it
must be some "utopia" of civic freedom, where somebody's trying to think
right about "where to send the kids."  & also letting "the kids" (see quotes)
figure things out themselves, without too much millenial thunder.

This is wonderful!-- some real theory I can think my teeth into.  I've been
brainstorming and know I can apply this wonderful Theory of Simplistics to some
other problems afflicting our tormented world:

1) TEEN PREGNANCY: tell teenagers that sex is the cause of all babies in the
world as well as sexually transmitted diseases. To avoid having babies and
getting STDs, abstain from sex or use a condom. (wOw, that was Simple!)

2) PALESTINE/ISRAEL: tell all Palestinian and Israeli citizens that war and
fighting result in violence and death; then say that dead people cannot own
land, only "rest" in it.  To avoid an early rest, stop fighting and share
everything.  (I will fax this proposal to the respective Embassies right away!)

3) POLLUTION: Let all industrial manufacturers producing "bad things" (why
complicate matters with messy specifics?) know that these things are bad for
people. In order to live on a healthier, happier planet, stop making them.  (We
can save a lot of time by Simply e-mailing this message around the Internet for
a few years.)

4) PEOPLE WHO MAKE RUDE GESTURES IN A CAR: Initiate a massive publicity
campaign to notify all drivers of cars that there are certain gestures which
are rude. As the public is educated these gestures will cease. Recalcitrant
gesture makers can be stopped by someone going car door to car door, removing
them (fingers, tongues, whatever. . .)

This is a fine example of applied theoretical knowledge. Miekal, do I need to
send a check or something to The Institute for making use of The Theory?

Thanks for making that clear about universities, Mark. I'd venture to add,
though, that many major US corporations are sustained in the same way, i.e.
thru tax cuts, govt. subsidies, etc. etc.

Who's talking about warfare? There are other forms of public service.

Nor is this a discussion of artifice vs nature--not on my part, at least.
But note in passing that universities don't actually make profits--that's
why they need grants and endowments to operate. (They do share with private
sector business the tendency of bureaucracies to try to become immortal.) In
most countries universities are paid for out of taxes, the same as freeways:
they're seen as a necessary part of the infrastructure.

Dan, Miekal, this is getting exciting - but there's an even simpler
solution I learned from my Grandpa (he was a city official in Minneapolis
during the bootleg era).  He would say (pipe in cheek, I guess)
"Just take all the Democrats, put em up against a wall, & shoot em."
We could do the same with gun owners!!!!

Glazier; and a conversation "On Poetry, Language, and Teaching" with Paul

From the back cover of
�where to go what to do when you are�
Bern Porter A Personal Biography
by James Schevill
Tilbury House 1992 Gardiner ME

b p b p b p b p b p b p b p b p b p b p b p b p b p b p

        A short, round-faced man with a drooping mouth walks slowly along a
downtown sidewalk in Belfast, Maine, his long white hair plowed straight
back in distinct furrows.  His hunched figure and frayed clothes make
him stand out among the scrubbed summer tourists.  Other people pass and
greet him by name: �Hello, Bern!�  At the top of main Street, he walks
across to the Belfast Post Office, heading directly for the lobby
wastebasket.  Here, he harvests a sheaf of catalogues and discarded
advertisements, produces a pair of scissors from a pocket, and begins
transforming this �junk� into art.
        Bern Porter has done this all of his life, finding art and meaning in
things other people ignore.  He was born on Valentine�s Day, 1911, in
Porter Settlement, near the Canadian border, in Maine�s northernmost
county, an area known for its timber, potatoes, and depth of snow.  He
spent his childhood cutting up newspapers, rearranging the words and
pictures, pasting them into books, and trading those books for eggs,
milk, and cheese.  As he grew older--attending Colby College and Brown
University (where he earned a degree in physics), working on the
Manhattan Project, then the Saturn moon rocket project--Porter continued
to make these �Artist Books,�  refining the idea into his singular
vision of Founds: combinations of mass media images and text that he
uses to reflect American culture as in a funny-house mirror: twisted but
true.
        In 1945 when the U.S. dropped an atom bomb on Hiroshima, he and his
fellow Manhattan Project scientists learned exactly what they had been
building, and the knowledge turned Porter away from military
applications of science toward art and culture.  Porter had begun
publishing many important writers at the time, including Henry Miller,
Robert Duncan, and Kenneth Patchen.  In 1947 he opened a gallery in
Sausalito, California, that exhibited what was new in abstract and
surreal art, as well as providing a forum for poetry readings and
performance art.
        In the late 1960s, Porter returned to Maine, ran, unsuccessfully, for
governor, and started his own �think tank� for �drop outs,� The
Institute for Advanced Thinking.  Entering his ninth decade, and still
living in Maine, he continues to publish new voices and create his
extraordinary books of �Founds.�

Dear Miekal:

My parents were born and raised in Belfast, Maine and I spent much
time there visiting the gradparents. On one of my visits to
Belfast,
maybe 15 years ago, I attended a reading by Porter, at,
of all places, the Odd Fellows Hall on Main Street. There was a good
and variously-aged crowd there--perhaps 50-60 people--and since this
was winter, most had to be native residents (Belfast has developed
an arts scene fed by lots of immigration in the
past few years, but this was shortly after the chicken processing
plant had closed down, and before the town started creeping toward
the fate of neighbors Camden and Rockport). People listened very
attentively and applauded
politely after each poem. Porter had an "assistant" during this
reading, and during every poem this young man crawled around on the
floor commando-style or on all fours, weaving himself between
pPorter's legs. My memory is that there was some nervous laughter
at the beginning of the reading, but no sense at all of reproach from
the audience.

New England communities have a long traditionof being tolerant--even
protective--of their eccentrics, and this certainly seems to be the
case with
Belfast's attitude toward Porter. My grandmother told me once that
after his wife died, Porter was in the habit for some time of walking
around town in his wife's clothes. I remember asking my grandmother if
this didn't
cause people to laugh at him, and with thick Maine accent she replied
something to the effect that no, Bern has always been very different
but he is a genius and a decent man... I asked her why she thought
he was a genius and whether she had read his work. She said she had
read just a little of it and couldn't make heads or tails of it, but
that this, of course, was the way of genius. (I am doing my best to be
faithful to her words here!)

I remember reading in _Down East_ magazine (is that where I saw it?)
a wonderful article about the town gala party for Porter's 90th,
attended by hundreds. There was a parade to kick the festivities off;
Porter led the parade in regal dress and with staff, followed by
town firetrucks and ambulance. A lobster and clam bake followed inthe
park, I think, with games, civic orchestra, and so on.

Ah, that all avant-garde poets would be so dearly loved!


On a seperate note: What, more exactly, do you think that Charles
Bernstein "models"?

Subject:      real worlds...
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

with steve, i grow weary of rehearsing the academic vs. real world
argument... yet that it keeps resurfacing sez something about where we seem
to be (here i mean)... so it may be a tune that needs to be replayed every
so often, just to keep everybody's head clear...

strikes me that part of the problem is the way "university" is perceived,
even from within... i would like to say ("for once and for all") that there
is no SINGLE university construct... that many universities are in so many
ways rapidly becoming corporations is, for me, a given... but this reality
plays itself out differently on different campuses...  i would like to ask
folks who do not know better (fess up now!) to take my word for it, please
( !---this IS asking a lot, i know)... just as surely as one can offer some
tentative generalizations about the profession of the professoriate, one
can as well offer some concrete evidence that pertains to the incredible
disparities at work across the professoriate... i've posted too too much in
these regions to illustrate what i mean... for that matter, the term
"non-academic" bears some scrutiny too---it can (i say *can*) become a way
to cloak, if not privilege, one's vantage point...

hey:  right now -- just to go public with it in these parts, and at the
risk of appearing a bit self-saturated -- i'm seriously considering leaving
academe, at least for a short spell---mebbe a year, mebbe more... i am
honestly not quite sure whether this will in fact happen, but my mind must
be made up by may... and at my age, i'm fully aware of the extent to which
this jeopardizes my "career," so you might each imagine that even
considering such a move comes out of a relatively difficult set of
circumstances (which have in part to do with choices i've made, with my
refusal to 'play the game' according to hoyle)... in my particular case, i
understand quite well what i mean when i write "leaving academe"---that is,
i came 'here' from industry, pretty much knowing what my alternatives were
(even though i can't say as how i thought this profession would turn out to
be so goddamn REAL!)... and if i leave, i can say pretty much the same...
but my point is that my personal situation might be difficult to gather
'from the outside'...

so perhaps we all need to be just a bit less presumptuous about our
respective work-places... academics among us too---i mean, *we* tend, as
professors, to go on about grants, and sabbaticals, and conferences and
such like w/o always acknowledging the impact such chatter may have on
those less aligned with postsecondary institutions... we tend, that is, to
obscure the fact that teaching is, finally, a job---no matter how
rewarding, no matter how seemingly unconventional wrt other forms of
employment, or wage-earning... hell, *i* even find it off-putting, partly
b/c i don't have the pedigree (so to speak) that i know some of you,
however few, must surely have... i say this less out of envy than out of an
awareness, again, of just how disparate this profession is...

anyway, if each of us wants to talk both with those who are and those who
are not like us, we'll have to be a bit more explicit perhaps, and a bit
less hasty to generalize all the way 'round...

best,

joe

for the record, it was his 80th,  there is a photo of him leading the

There is video of this celebration (23 minutes long from Cyclops in
Freeport Maine) entitled : Bern Porter's 80th birthday celebration -- it
was put together by Vanessa Barth and is a compact introduction to the
world of Bern Porter. The parade Kent mentioned hovers in my memory
whenever I hear  the name Bern Porter -- poet as king, walking with
staff, flanked by dozens of poets  1/3 , 1/4 of his age who benefitted
from the boundaries he pushed/ the ideals he stood for/against.
 The Poetry Collection at the Ste. University of Buffalo has a copy of the
video.

Lately I've been playing John Davis's songs "Here I Am" and "I'll Burn" to
keep my head clear. As I am trying to limit my budget for new recordings
this year, would you good people mind recommending some listening
materials?

Thanks,
Jordan Davis

I really dig Luscious Jackson's new record _Fever In Fever Out_:
irresistible poppiness with a trip-hop sensibility. Also, try out
Superdrag's _Regretfully Yours_: fun, Beatles-influenced guitar rock. I
haven't gotten hold of the album yet, but I'm dying to give The
Klezmatics' _Jews With Horns_ a whirl; they play traditional klezmer
music, the fiddle/accordian/brass dance music of eastern Europe (somebody
correct me if I got any of that wrong).

Anyway, that's my $.02....

OK, Charles, I figure I'd better do it. I Know I'm one of the lurkpubs you
had in mind. Some of the listers are on my mailing list already, or got
samples at the National Poetry foundation in June, or at UNH Assembling
Alternatives in August, but here goes:
     I started publishing poetry broadsides under the name Backwoods
Broadsides in 1978. In March 1994 I started a new series called the
Chaplet Series, modelled after Martha & Basil King's Northern Lights
International/Brooklyn Series, which was based on Michael Carlson's
Northern Lights Series (London), which was based on a Canadian series I
don't know the name of.
     The way I do them, folded 8 1/2 x 14" sheet, they'll take a long poem,
an excerpt from a huge one, or a whole lot of little ones like Jackson
Mac Low's Postcard Poems. I've mailed out 23 so far, 24 & 25 are at press.
Many are names that pop up on the list, e.g. Ron Johnson, Bern Porter,
Rochelle Owens, Peter O'Leary, Cid Corman, Dick Higgins, Diane di Prima,
James Laughlin, most recently a new long poem from Anne Waldman called
"a slice at that" and some Sanskrit translations by Andrew Schelling
called "Jasmine & Thunder."
     Photo-offset on good paper, hand stamped colophon, numbered editions
of 750. I charge a buck. But it's better to subscribe--I send out two at a
time, seasonally starting now. Subs are $10 yr, 8 issues ppd, back issues
$1. Add some for foreign postage. If that's more than you have, send $5 to
get started, or $2, or I give scholarships. But I do this all myself, no
support beyond subscribers. Send to:
     Sylvester Pollet
     Backwoods Broadsides
     RR 5 Box 3630
     Ellsworth ME 04605-9529
     USA
     I have all the back issues, though some are numbered overrun. Or you
can see them at libraries starting with "B" like the Beinecke, Brown,
Buffalo. Or bookstores coast-to-coast (Univ. of Maine & City Lights).
     There, I did it. Who's next?

Think of it as Yiddish dixieland. As much a US as a European phenomenon.
Good time music.

I'll second Karl's endorsement of Luscious Jackson. Them chicks is hot!
That's the only new music I've got hold of, though. It's pretty much old
Louis Armstrong (c. 1930) and old Johnny Cash lately.

my son maxwell who is in 6th grade got a sheet of feedback
from his teacher on his JUPITER report.

his teacher has been consistently critical about his choice of
words and phrases. so i'm reading down the list of the teacher's
remarks and come to "Do not use the word 'wacko' in your report."

i'm sure i'm responsible for corrupting max as i consistently
tell him when writing reports to write in his own words, his
own voice instead of copying down sentences from texts verbatim.
i tell him to put his own spin on the content. i ask him, what
does it mean to you? what is interesting about this to you?

what's funny is that i got in the same kind of trouble at his age.
my fifth grade report on the history of california intermixed
textbook history with pop culture slogans. my teacher did not find
this funny or post-modern or anything. she was pissed! i still
have the report and i think it's hilarious.

anyway, i guess maxwell's teacher is an improvement over my fifth
grade teacher. i got an F on my california history report and max
got an A on his jupiter report.

My favorite image of Charles is one of him modeling a somewhat disheveled
flannel shirt (red & green if memory serves me) and a couple of days' growth
of beard, upon his return from a cabin in the Baboquivari Mountains in
southern Arizona to my home in Tucson. Somehow, even after the hour and a
half drive back to Tucson he managed to burst in still excited and say, "It
was fantastic." So it was also something about the look on his face he
modeled, and my new conception of "language poet mountain man."

there are probably more alternatives out there than most of us would like

Signing off for a few days as I leave Boulder with its attendant
mysteries (and attendant press corps) to return to my "real" employments
at San Jose State -- U-Haul couldn't provide a truck with modem &
cellular phone, so I'll just have to listen to all of these poetry
reading tapes I've been making lately --

his latest _Stein Awards_ anthology, which makes for very good reading

It seems this list adrifting. Is it possible that folks might talk about real
books, poems. I don't mind the auto/bio/ etc. riffs but it wd also be nice,
maybe add a few sparks, if the focus cd turn to actual poems, lines etc. The
formalized thing. I been re-reading Tom Mandel's new book, PROSPECT OF
RELEASE which I find stunning. I'll probably pop out a review later.
I realize the "ragged right" craziness of E-mail limits the integrity of
presenting even the lines of an actual work, but even given the formal
challenge of that, this format/ forumn (academic or none) wd be welcome to my
eyes/ears/cranium. Not only who you/we are reading, but what. Proof, love,
war in particulars, etc.

Cheers,
Stephen

On his first computer, an Apple II, bp did program a simple set of action
poems. One of those 5.5" diskettes. It was later made a commercial item by
Red Deer College Press, and is still available, I wd guess. In 3.5" disks,
but I dont know what format.

That's Saturday January 18, and the reading starts at

2:30pm

(which I think is perhaps a little earlier than the usual starting
time?)

Anyway, if you are in NY please come.

The Ear Inn is located at 326 West Spring Street

Just as the thread on ebonics was dying down, this came through, via
Suzanne J. Levine, a great translator from yet another language. Some
shmerriment for the veekend. -- Pierre

Jewish English or "Hebonics"

The Encino School Board has declared Jewish English a second
language.  Backers of the move say the district is the first
in the nation to recognize Hebonics as the language of many
of America's Jews.  Here are some descriptions of the
characteristics of the language, and samples of phrases in
standard English and Hebonics.

Samples of Pronunciation Characteristics:

Jewish English or "Hebonics" hardens consonants at the ends
of words.  Thus, "hand" becomes "handt."

The letter "W" is always pronounced as if it were a "V".
Thus "walking"  becomes "valking."

"R" sounds are transformed to a guttural utterance that is
virtually impossible to spell in English.  It is "ghraining"
"alrgheady."

Samples of Idiomatic Characteristics:

Questions are always answered with questions.

Question:  "How do you feel?"  Hebonics response:  "How
should I feel?"

The subject is often placed at the end of a sentence after a
pronoun has been used at the beginning:  "She dances
beautifully, that girl."

The sarcastic repetition of words by adding "sh" to the
front is used for emphasis:  mountains becomes "shmountains"
turtle becomes "shmurtle"

Sample Usage Comparisons:

Standard English Phrase             Hebonics Phrase

"He walks slowly."        -     "Like a fly in the ointment he walks"
"You're sexy."             -              (unknown concept)
"Sorry, I do not know the time."   -      "What do I look like, a
clock?"

"I hope things turn out for the best."  -  "You should BE so lucky"
"Anything can happen."    -    "It is never so bad, it can't get worse"

Everything that allows men to become rooted, through
values or sentiments, in _one_ time, in _one_ history, in
_one_ language, is the principle of alienation which
constitutes man as privileged in so far as he is what he is,
[...] imprisoning him in contentment with his own reality
and encouraging him to offer it as an example or impose
it as a conquering assertation. -- Maurice Blanchot

i'm reading through both the _primary trouble_ and _premonitions_
anthologies of late, both of which i'm finding to be well-worth the price
of admission... i'll be using the _primary trouble_ anthology in an
american poetry class this semester, so it'll be interesting to see how the
class responds to the writing... i'm gonna jump-start the class by
beginning at the beginning, having a close look at that preface-poem by
william bronk, "the nature of musical form," see what sorts of insights
this poem generates...

far as single books of poetry:  i'm finally getting to hannah weiner's
_silent teachers remembered sequel_, which is remarkable in its way... and
celan's _breathturn_, which w/o pierre joris's exceptional introduction
(and for that matter translation) i probably wouldn't have a clue as to how
to read...

next up is rod smith's latest, _in memory of my theories_... and i keep
dabbling in and out of the rothenberg/joris _poems for the millennium_
anthology, which i find extraordinary... oh and i'm just about to finish up
alfred bester's _the stars my destination_, one of THE most amazing scifi's
i've ever laid my pinkies on...

I can't recommend it, since I've only sniffed it (about 80 yrs ago) -
but maybe the _Anatomy of Melancholy_?  Just a guess...(& not exactly

It's a Macintosh format. I have one which Ellie Nichol kindly gave me, and I
believe that you're right and it is still available. Probably one could be
purchased from jw curry, whose address was posted on this list a few days
ago. But perhaps from other sources as well.

for me : my head is clearest at spectacles that i enjoy : kid's birthday
parties, kid's soccer games, swap meets, etc.

of course, if i need to clear my head it's kinda hard to put together a
kid's birthday party or a swap meet at the drop of a hat. i meditate
(ie: just bring thoughts out and notice them).

as far as music goes, the meat puppets' UP ON THE SUN.

when I want to clear my head,
I just go to one of Don's great
birthday parties.

actually, theres something
I really like about that--I havent
been to a birthday party since I

was about 12 (I guess most of us
get too embarrassed at about that
age to have more).

oh, but music: any Patsy Cline will do--well, almost any.  also
Art Blakey & the Jazz Messengers. theres a great Nat King Cole disk
of the earliest recordings (the name escapes me now)--much better, I
think, than his later work. also I listen to a lot of Sonic Youth.

Let me add that the transliteration of those sounds in hebonics (I prefer
hebronics) that goyim find hard to pronounce follows the standard
established by Weinrich in his _Modern Yiddish-English Dictionary_, the

I have gotten several questions about the new listserv address. The address
for subscribing and unsubscribing, for setting mail/nomail or digest, as
well as for "review poetics" (which gives you who is subscribed) is now

listserv@listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu

The "UBVM" address is no longer active! Part of the confusion comes for our
using the old listserv address in the "how to see who's subscribed" section
of the New and Improved Welcome Message. More improvement is just around the
corner. There are now about 450 people subscribed to Poetics.

Now, now, Jordan. Let's give credit where credit is due. Those are the
words of Mr. Bernstein. "No. 111 2.7.93-10.20.96" is due out on Feb. 7th
from The Figures, weighing in at 624 pages. There will be a book party at
the newly opened chic Soho Grand Hotel here in NYC on Friday, Feb. 7,
5-7:30. All in town are welcome to attend. Since there is no press release
written yet, here's the context from which that idea came--the full back
cover blurbs:


"The Borscht belt meets concept art in this delirious digest of obsessive
gaiety, this useless collection of perishable information, this wily
catalog of everyday life, this alphabetic bestiary of the ribs, joints,
sinews, and bones of language's alluring lore.  Kenneth Goldsmith has
written what could be the longest, and maybe the last, list poem of the
20th Century.  On the way, he has reinvented prosody-counting by 1, 2s, 3s,
and up-as he inventories the roaring rush of rippling, or is it ripping?,
words: inchoate yet coalescing, a fractal romp on just this side of virtual
reality."

                            -Charles Bernstein


"In Kenneth Goldsmith's "useless encyclopedic reference book," Oulipo
brilliantly meets the Millenium.  The text adheres strictly to its chosen
rules: all the phrases collected between February 7, 1993 and October 20,
1996 end in sounds related to the sound "R" and they are organized
alphabetically by syllable-count beginning with one syllable entries for
Chapter 1 ("A, a, aar, aas, aer, agh, ah, air...") and ending with a 7,228
syllable tour de force of astonishing proportions.  But, in the spirit of
George Perec and Jacques Roubaud, Goldsmith uses these "rules" to expose
the reader/listener/viewer to the marvels and vagaries of language in the
late twentieth century.  What we talk about, how we look at things, how we
actually communicate-Goldsmith's eye and ear for contemporary argot is near
perfect."

                           -Marjorie Perloff



"Musical before exhaustive, rhythmic before objective, Goldsmith's epic
litanies and lists bring to the textual tradition of conceptual art not
only an exploded frame of reference, but a hitherto absent sense of
hypnotic beat.  Under its deceptively bland title, "No. 111
2.7.93-10.20.96" attempts no less than a complete reordering of the things
of the world.  The work is also a weirdly constructed Baedeker to late 20th
Century American society, as well as a compendium for an autobiography of
the artist."

Signing off for a few days as I leave Boulder with its attendant
mysteries (and attendant press corps) to return to my "real" employments
at San Jose State -- U-Haul couldn't provide a truck with modem &
cellular phone, so I'll just have to listen to all of these poetry

Speaking of publications -- Douglass Messerli handed me in D.C. a copy of
his latest _Stein Awards_ anthology, which makes for very good reading
indeed -- I've learned the names of a couple impressive poets previously
unknown to me already --  Looks just like last year's model in a new

Joe,

That Bester book *is* brilliant, by gorsh. I re-read it this summer, then
found that Vintage was re-releasing it. I think Wm. Gibson had this book in
the back of his head when he wrote _Neuromancer_. Got the _Millennium_
anthology for my B-day and am loving it. Also, scored a used copy of o-blek
Spring 1993: Presentation, which features work by many of the folks on this
list and is a real joy. Other books I'm enjoying: Tom's incredible
_Prospect_, Bev Dahlen's Reading 8-10, and Edmond Jabes. I'm very excited
about Jabes and am curious to know what others on the list think of him as
he is new to me.

i'm reading through both the _primary trouble_ and _premonitions_
anthologies of late, both of which i'm finding to be well-worth the price
of admission... i'll be using the _primary trouble_ anthology in an
american poetry class this semester, so it'll be interesting to see how the
class responds to the writing... i'm gonna jump-start the class by
beginning at the beginning, having a close look at that preface-poem by
william bronk, "the nature of musical form," see what sorts of insights
this poem generates...

far as single books of poetry:  i'm finally getting to hannah weiner's
_silent teachers remembered sequel_, which is remarkable in its way... and
celan's _breathturn_, which w/o pierre joris's exceptional introduction
(and for that matter translation) i probably wouldn't have a clue as to how
to read...

next up is rod smith's latest, _in memory of my theories_... and i keep
dabbling in and out of the rothenberg/joris _poems for the millennium_
anthology, which i find extraordinary... oh and i'm just about to finish up
alfred bester's _the stars my destination_, one of THE most amazing scifi's
i've ever laid my pinkies on...

alla these superlatives, i know---but then, that's why i'm reading this
stuff!...

Yeah, Don, Puppets' Up On The Sun is a fave album of mine--has a real
solar flair you might say--and i've been waiting for them to do something
as good ever since.  So far without luck.  A few times now i've heard
lame cleaned-up versions of their earlier stuff on the radio, suitable for
"Alternative-Radio-As-Marketing-Niche" framing.  As tuneful as "Sun" is to
my ear, i'm always amazed that that sort of stuff cldn't get played *as
is*.

Ah you lucky people who have heard Elmslie read. (Or Schuyler, for that
matter.) I have never heard him, though I heard too late that a play was
produced in Seattle a couple years ago. Does anyone out there teach
Elmslie? How does one do it?

I'm interested in hearing from anyone interested in "innovative" verse and
the pastoral poem. Particularly the possible political interstices and
oppositions with Language Poetry. I'm considering compiling an anthology
of both critical and "creative" work around this theme. Personally, I've
been looking at Lyn Hejinian's, Susan Howe's, and the Australian poet
Robert Adamson's work. At the moment I'm working on a critical book on the
Pastoral & Modernism in the Late Twentieth Century and see such an
anthology as a natural extension of this project.

Re any interesting poems. I'm reading heaps of interesting stuff for Salt
at the moment (Salt 9 should be in US and UK bookshops shortly - the first
issue to have true international distribution) but a piece that has
been particularly interesting in scope is Silliman's first section of his
K section of *The Alphabet*. And a batch of poems by Pierre Alferi which
could be described as being like a cross between John Tranter and Andrew
Duncan if they wrote in French. It astounds me how much great material is
out there.

A query. Has anyone heard what Blitza Bargeld is working on at the moment?


Yours

That's Blixa Bargeld I was talking about. Though I'm sure he'd appreciate
the typo. And I've just discovered the Guardian weekend liftout features
Nick Cave and says Bargeld is working on a theatre project - "The
Execution Of Precious Memories". A weird coincidence.

lou reed metal machine music -- guaranteed to blow all the scleroses right
outta the ol' cranial cavity -- strict stereo separation means you should
either use headphones or what i like better -- unplug one speaker and play
side one, then switch speakers and play the same side again, then play it
again full stereo and enjoy how the two channels interlap.

cheers,

-
Reading:  Martha Ronk's _State of Mind_, a short trip on a long pier.
wonderful west coast hoodoo.  U.S. OUT OF TERRA INCOGNITA!

Bei Dao's _Landscape Over Zero_, BD repeatedly destroys me and keeps me up
at night looking for missles.  I find myself returning to this book
several times a day.

Medbh McGuckian's _Captain Lavender_, latest book of whammy by Belfast's
finest.  The war is in the painting, and she's no radio traitor, I say.

and I just re-read David Antin's "Definitions for Mendy."  Yep.

Now playing:  George Jones/Elvis Costello-"Stranger in the House":  I
always found EC's solo version a bit cold.  GJ is just what this song
needed.  Violin that asks you nicely to weep.


Wilco-"Being There" LP:  I haven't stopped listening to this 2xLP since it
was released in October.  A monster:  feedback pianoed ballads, Beach Boys
stomp, and the usual sturm und twang.  Spinal Tap and Dimetapp.

Willie Nelson-"Spirit" LP:  not as fonky as "Shotgun Willie," not as
masterful as "Stardust," but the spare line-up (fiddle, piano, guitar) and
matador flavor give the old dog a new kick.  Just heard Willie on Fresh
Aire the other day, where he caually admitted that he wrote "Crazy",
"Nightlife", and "Funny How Time Slips Away" in one afternoon.  I need a
day like that.

James McMurtry-"Where'd You Hide the Body?":  Larry's kid's even bleaker
third album.  This one has a tuba though, on the opener, "Iolanthe."  A
few clunkers, but worth it for lines like "There'd be no last call if they
elected me king" and "I wrecked the El Camino/Woulda been DWI/So I just
walked off and left it/Layin' on its side."

all freaked out about clarity,

I'm hoping that this message gets to the list as I had a bunch of trouble
with my address seemingly changing on the listserve & thus not being
accepted. Ive gone through the changes I think will work. I wanted to send
another note on Fred Wah:

In the mode recommended by Charles Bernstein, I want to call attention to a
new book by someone many of you know:

NeWest Press recently published Fred Wah's first prose work, _Diamond
Grill_. Although I'm a member of the Editorial Board of NeWest Press, I
only saw the work after it was published, so I can tell you, with no sense
of conflict of interest, that it is simply terrific. A beautiful mix of
memoir, fiction, exact & precise memory-act, lovingly rendered life as
known in the senses. Those who know Fred's poetry will know how he works
with language, but here he has maintained the intensity of his poetry while
achieving a level of openness and more 'ordinary' (never in his case quite
what you expect) readerliness that will gain him many new readers (in fact,
_Diamond Grill_ has sold over half its run in just 3 months). I began to
read & couldn't put this down. Fred captures the essence of the small
Chinese cafes that are found in small towns all across the Canadian west, &
his own growing up in the cafe his father ran for years in Nelson BC.

The book is available in individual (not chain) bookstores across Canada, & from

Gosh, so much loud music being recommended, but I was glad to see Charles
Alexander get to jazz.

I certainly listen to Richard Thompson a lot, & Van Morrison's great live
in San Francisco double CD. But to clear the head?

Anything by Jessica Williams, perhaps the most exciting & complete pianist
(& terrific composer) to finally get some attention recently. A number of
fabulous albums are available from Jazz Focus records, a small company in
Calgary dedicated to releasing music by people the BIG companies havent
seemed to notice (& we know about that in poetry, dont we?)...

That the Theocritan pick-up has been versed
in country things seems obvious, the velour
on the dashboard crazy with fresh air
rushing through the doorless cabin, the cursed
skies blackened by night. Though a moon lurks
somewhere and the spotlight cutting through
the burn-back of summer detects the jerks
of nerves and tissue - the rabbits out to chew
the burnt prongs of stubble, the halogens
conflagration fills the omni-screens
within their eyeballs - the crack and whine
of a triple two mocks its rituals, a sign
of fading influence in a field where gravity
is a neck chop and the poem is framed by levity.

From today's New York Times--another one bites the gust (gotta love that
Whitney...)


January 18, 1997

Epilogue for Another Bookstore

By DINITIA SMITH


  NEW YORK -- Books & Company, the venerable Upper East Side bookstore that
has provided a home for a generation of writers, giving them space for
readings and allowing them to browse uninterruptedly amid its dark paneled
stacks, will close on May 31, its owner, Jeannette Watson, announced this
week. "We just cannot afford to pay the rent," Ms. Watson said.

  It is the latest in a series of independent bookstore closings in
Manhattan. On the Upper West Side alone, at least three independent
bookstores have closed since a Barnes & Noble superstore moved in in 1993.

  Nationally, the American Booksellers Association has estimated, some 50
to 60 independent bookstores shut down in 1996. And as the news of Books &
Company's closing spread through the literary community, the reaction was
dismay.

  "I'm heartbroken," said Cynthia Ozick over the phone last week. "What
does it tell us? That New York City can't support an independent
bookstore?"

  The reason for the closing, said Ms. Watson, is that business has been
bad lately. The building, on Madison Avenue at 74th Street, is owned by the
adjacent Whitney Museum of American Art, and Ms. Watson's lease is up.
"They were not willing to renew it on terms that were economically
reasonable for Books & Company," she said.

  The new lease provided for a rent increase that Willard Holmes, the
deputy director of the Whitney, called "a small percentage." Holmes added,
"It's unfortunate that they're not going to renew." Neither he nor Ms.
Watson would say exactly what the rent was, but rents for relatively small
spaces on Madison Avenue can be as high as $400,000 a year.

  Books & Company was founded in 1977 by Ms. Watson, the granddaughter of
Thomas Watson, the founder of IBM, and her partner, Burt Britton. Since
then, it has been a gathering place for writers, its antique air, its smell
of old books and creaking floors making it seem like a bit of London.

  When she opened her store, Ms. Watson, a divorced mother of a son, was
doing charity work. She had gone to Sarah Lawrence, and had always loved
books, so much, in fact, that her father called her "Madame-Nose-in-Books,"
she said.

  Still, her friends and family were surprised that the wealthy young woman
would want to tend store. Her father, Thomas Watson Jr. a former ambassador
to Russia, asked, "Why do you want to start a bookstore?' " Ms. Watson
remembers. "I told him I want to start something no one can take away from
me."

  For its first 10 years, the shop flourished. It was a place where
literary fiction got the best display, not the latest best sellers. Ms.
Watson called those years the Golden Age. "It was not unusual to a make a
$2,000 sale to one person," she said. "People had a tremendous amount of
money. They would buy expensive art books."

  Through its reading series, the bookstore introduced young writers, among
them Amy Hempel, Susan Cheever, Steven Millhauser and Edwidge Danticat.
Harold Brodkey met his wife, novelist Ellen Schwamm, there and called Books
& Company "symphonically important to me."

  Poet James Merrill even wrote a poem about the store for its 10th
anniversary:

  Ten years of browsing, and the shelves

  Mysteriously grow more packed

  Full of reflection, silver-backed ...

  Looking for books, we find ourselves.

  During those years, Ms. Watson met and married her second husband, Alex
Sanger, grandson of Margaret Sanger and president of Planned Parenthood of
New York City. They had two sons.

  But the last decade has not been kind to Books & Company. Real estate
values have driven many aspiring writers out of the neighborhood. The
superstores have come along, offering big discounts. And now there's
competition on the Internet. "You give your credit card number," Ms. Watson
said, describing Amazon.com, an Internet bookstore, "and the book comes in
two days."

  Ms. Watson resisted change. "We stayed old-fashioned," she said. She
never put in a computer. When customers called to request a book, Ms.
Watson herself would dash around the store looking for it. In an effort to
increase business, however, she did start a personal delivery service, to
any location in the city.

  For the last five years, said Ms. Watson, she has been putting some of
her inheritance into the place. "But a bookstore should not be a charity,"
she said. "It should be a business. I give money to charity." Sales picked
up at Christmas, she said, but it wasn't enough.

  Last year Ms. Watson started a publishing venture with Jonathan
Rabinowitz of Turtle Point Press in Purchase, N.Y. Their first book was a
reprint of Hannah Green's "Dead of the House," a coming-of-age novel that
the author, who died last year, had painstakingly worked on for years.

  "Just a beautiful book," said Ms. Watson. "We have to keep reprinting it.
We're sort of close to breaking even."

  She has discovered she loves publishing: editing, "working on the book
jacket," all the minutiae. And she will continue doing it after the store
has closed. In May, will come "A Journey With Elsa Cloud," a travelogue
about India, by Leila Hadley, a descendant of James Boswell.

  "This has always been my private club," Ms. Watson said of her store.
"It's an amazing way of getting to know people. I like to go through my
house charge customer lists: 'Oh, interesting! They're reading this!
They're sending the book to the White House!' I felt this thrill of pride.
My books are going all over the world. It's taught me not to judge people
simply by what they do. The doormen on Madison Avenue, for instance, have
an intense interest in books."

  There has been talk of a final reading. "But that would be too hard," she
said. "We'll have a final party, instead. We'll just invite everybody."

Sonnet

Jennifer sat down on her frock. She had just read Alexander Graham Pope,
Rape of the Lock. She had written a poem And had to take stock. It was not
nice, about ice, and black winds howling Outside where she died. She knew
it was true but a bad poem because, she Said, it didn't capture the
rapture of the spray in the air there. She Wrote sitting on her frock by
the freighter by the dock. I'm sorry, she Said, but the freighter was
dead. I will be on the Net yet, she said, To her quarry the storm. She
cried and she cried. The ice was nice, the Rain a pain, the wind was
blind, the waves her slaves. She lied most of The time but in rhyme. She
knew it was a very very bad poem. She got up And went home. I'm home, she
said, I'm dead. I know it's so, said Jennifer Me.

Yes - you mean "Unchained" also out from American. It's great. Like old sour
mash with a real bite. Almost a testimonial to his whole career - there's
something of the valedictory to it, though I hope in tone only.

Joe -- do also read _The Demolished Man_ which has also been reprinted
by Vintage. I read that one some years ago, but had never even _seen_ a
copy of _The Stars My Destination_ until this reprint. Bester also wrote
some terrific short stories, including a memorable parody of time travel
stories called "The Men Who Murdered Muhammad". Bester is legendary in
sf circles -- glad he's finally getting some wider exposure. NPR even
did an interview with Chip Delany for the occasion of this reprint and
ran it in prime time on ATC.

It's an anti-pastoral. But not in the way an Oliver Goldsmith poem is.
Maybe you have to be an Australian with a poetic tradition that has been
largely second-hand English pastoral to get this. Or Douglas Barbour, to
whom the poem is dedicated (he's from Canada, another Commonwealth
country...).

Sometime about a year ago, Maria, I spoke to a "creative nonfiction"
final-year grad student at your institution. We began talking about some
poetry events and she said she didn't know much about "line poetry." I never
did quite figure out what she meant by that, but then we just talked about
poets and she had never heard of Charles Olson, Robert Duncan, or any number
of other people. And while I'm not very well-versed (forgive the pun) on
contemporary poets outside my own limited range, I did recognize the people
she mentioned, even if I couldn't claim to know their work well. But when we
got on to "creative nonfiction" I assumed that might mean essays of all
creative sorts, but she made it clear it did not include work like that of
Walter Benjamin (even the possibly 'lighter' essays like "Unpacking My
Books"), whose name she had also never heard. Now this person seemed
obviously energetic and intelligent to me, but we just simply couldn't find
a common ground. And while I did learn that "creative nonfiction" included
essays by Louise Erdrich, I still didn't get much sense of a definition,
practical or theoretical, of "creative nonfiction."

And I think, if anything, the term "literary nonfiction" might confuse
matters even more.

ps: Maria, unlike just about anybody else on this Poetics list, your

send to the list. Can you do anything about that? Or am I nitpicking here.

Subject:      what gets taught
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

Charles Alexander's story about the noneducation of a writing student should
be shocking but is more saddening.
Charles may remember that when I lived in Tucson I managed to get myself one
poetry workshop at the university (but only because I was hired through
their extended university: in effect, the writing program got an extra
section without having to pay for it. They were otherwise distinctly
unfriendly to outsiders). The course was a required part of the
undergraduate major sequence, so I thought I should speak to the guy who
coordinated it to make sure that my students came out with what they needed
for the next step. He told me to teach what I wanted, so I told him that I
wuld be including reading and discussion of major poets. Among the classics
I would probably include some Marvell... He stopped me right there. He said
that the department tended not to teach "older poetry," as the students had
read that in HS. Understand, he was talking abt sophomores who were products
of Arizona public schools. "What do you teach them?" I asked, trying not to
sound incredulous. "We emphasize," he said grandly, "the contemporary
voice." Well, that got the old juices flowing, so I asked him who he was
talking about. "You know, Amy Clampitt, Jory Graham," and a half-dozen or so
more of that ilk. My kids got Spicer and Creeley and Schwerner and Williams
and Owens and Rothenberg--hosehold names were I come from, and everyone on
this list can flesh out the rest of my syllabus.
Later that year I was talking to some recent MFA graduates, among them the
the young woman who organizes the annual poetry jamboree. Turns out none of
them had even heard of Jack Spicer. They knew who Olson was by rumor, but
had never opened one of his books. And on and on, as my jaw dropped onto my
knees.
I gave the woman who organized the jamboree some books to read, and I had to
explain to her what she was reading. The upshot was that she invited one
poet who's on this list of the many I proposed.
There are exceptions: the grad students who hang around Tenney Nathanson and
Charles get a lot more, but neither of them were teaching workshops back
then (am I right, Tenney?).
Those of us on the whatever end (left) of poetry can fight among ourselves
all we want (it's probably good for us), but there's a big world out there
that doesn't even know we exist. And I'm probably exposing my own
inexhaustible naivete even to mention this.

mark, what you flesh out so nicely is one of the reasons why those of us
who "do" work that requires works cited and such like need perhaps to
rethink our apparatus...

i'm tilting these days, in anything i write that invokes formally critical
apparatus, toward including a bibliography or equiv.... by which i mean a
list of works read, which permits me some latitude simply to LIST works
that i know my readers are not likely to have read... a list in such a
context becomes an extremely performative item...

it's stating the obvious, again---but after talking once with an otherwise
bright, talented and knowledgeable yale younger poet who hadn't heard of
williams' _kora in hell_ (and a number of other such writings), it became
immediately apparent to me that the failure was owing in large part to our
teaching institutions...

best,

to charles et al: yes, this is my institution all right.  walter benjamin is
considered "theory" so if you like "cultural studies" or if you're a "marxist"
you read benjamin, but it is implicitly understood tht "creative nonfiction" or
"poetry" or "fiction" students for that matter have no interest in these matters
beyond a general indignation about injustice, which is easily rectified by
reading a few novels by Native Americans, Asian Americans, and African
Americans.  and you can pretty well predict whose work gets read and whose
doesn't.  nate mackey? kamau brathwaite? aime cesaire? who's that?  web du bois?
who?  wasn't he some kind of sociologist?  hey, what's a girl to do except hang
out on the poetix list.

Mark is of course right about the Tucson situation, although it always seems
possible here to find several or even a small "many" people who are
interested in the poets this list tends to favor. And it continues to
surprise me, here and in Minneapolis where I have lived recently, and I
imagine in lots of elsewheres, how easy it is to introduce others to poets
one likes, in readings or discussion groups or whatever, just by remaining
active. Just that, from that voice-centered MFA place, I have generally
found very little publicly active sensibility, rather a tendency to be the
writer in isolation and to value that. That said, I also have to say that of
course I know many exceptions to that, and I tend to value those who do get
publicly active, regardless of whether they read the same poets I do.

you read these autobiographies with every moment neatly commissioning every

and then you try and write down something that happened holding exact

Forgot to mention that I'm wearing the shroom teeshirt that my wife gave me
in memory of one of our earlier dates. Not a good thing to be caught in when
stopped for a speeding ticket.
Teeshirts can be dangerous.
We were driving along the north shore of the St. Lawrence from Quebec west,
checking out the churches in the villages along the way. As the Canadians
out there can attest, these churches are notable for their exceptional
ugliness--gothic revival set stone and institutional green trim, each more
garish than the last. They're very endearing.
As we entered the dingy industrial town of Cap-de-la-Madeleine we saw off to
our left on the bank of the river a veritable gothic volcano--it was a huge
gothic octagon with a pointed roof. We had to check it out.
It was surrounded by acres of parking lot, like a ballpark, but filled with
RVs. Crowds of mostly elderly people with folding lawn chairs were
converging on the church. We stopped to ask an old man what was going on. It
was Ascension, he said, and this was an important pilgrimage church. Why
didn't we take a look?
"But we're non-believers," I said, "just tourists."
"So are most of us," he said.
"But I'm not dressed appropriately." I was wearing a teeshirt and cutoffs.
He assured me it didn't matter.
But it did. As we walked towards the church I noticed that old women were
giving me dirty looks--but not in the eye, in the chest. I couldn't figure
out what was going on, so I turned to my wife to comment, whereupon she
burst into peals of laughter. I was wearing my mexican loteria teeshirt with
the topless mermaid on it.
Clothes do make the man/woman.
What does this have to do with poetry?

My current unfavorite in the work environment I inhabit is the verb

attrit

as in "we'll attrit that department to 24 after the new system is up."

Some others include:

the verb "task" as in
"I have been tasked to prepare a white paper on strategy"

"install" as an adjective, as in

"revenue has remained flat while the install base has doubled"

"quark" as a verb, as in "quark that, please"

I hear this stuff every day. All professional jargons are full of it,
but the PC industry positively delights in it. When I worked in the
prison movement in the 1970s, there were some liberal architects who
were calling what's typically known as "the main yard" of their
institutional designs "detention gardens." An older institution like
San Quentin (dating back well into the 19th century), understands the
model somewhat better and calls this same feature "the quad."

I know this is off topic, but Tony Kusner is a PEN member.


                  AND NOW, A WORD FROM SOME FELLOW AMERICANS

   By Tony Kushner

   Sunday, January 19 1997; Page C01
   The Washington Post



   Fellow citizens!

   No one could be more surprised than I, Anthony R. Kushner, that a gay
   Jewish socialist playwright could get elected president of the United
   States. Go know!

   Apparently the '96 presidential campaign was so entirely substanceless
   and boring only seven people bothered to vote: Bill, Hillary, Bob,
   Liddy, Perot, yours truly and my Aunt Martha. Bill, Bob and Ross each
   voted for themselves. Hillary wrote herself in. Liddy, I suspect, went
   into the booth but didn't pull the lever (she has plans of her own in
   2000!). Nader, Kemp and Gore were no-shows, and so, between me and
   Aunt Martha, we carried the day. My co-op building on the Upper West
   Side hasn't been so excited since the Yankees won the World Series. I
   plan to move the White House to my apartment because, let's face it,
   folks, you can't take someone seriously if he doesn't live in
   Manhattan.

   Mark Helprin refused to write this speech for me, so it doesn't have
   any of the measuring-my-self-against-the-cornfielded-horizon imagery
   that he wrote for Dole. I live in New York and have never seen the
   horizon. But thanks to C-SPAN for agreeing to cover my speech when
   none of the networks would bother. Long live cable TV, say I, and
   that's all I have to say about technology and information
   superhighways and the 21st century, except of course that I hope we
   make it to the 21st century. Three years to go still and it doesn't
   look good.

   Okay, I lied, I have one more thing to say about technology. I read in
   the papers a few weeks ago that Pentium had invented a computer that
   can do a trillion calculations a second or something like that. This
   seems great news to me -- now we have the number-crunching ability to
   have a planned economy. We already have a planned economy, but I think
   we need one that's guided by logic, decency and a sense of global
   developmental human needs, instead of the profit-maximization
   strategies of a couple of hydra-headed multinational corporations.

   First the substance thing and then, for the wrap-up, the vision thing.

   I liked Bill's school uniforms idea -- have you seen the way teenagers
   dress these days? Yuck! We could hire single mothers who have been
   thrown off welfare to sew them, since we have no other jobs for these
   people -- heck, maybe we could put their kids to work as well! A
   family kind of thing! I could sew very nicely when I was a boy, but of
   course I was a big sissy so maybe that wouldn't work for every
   formerly dependent child; the ones who are too butch to sew could do
   something else, like dispose of nuclear waste. In the New Jersey
   wetlands.

   Just kidding! What I think I'll do is cut the defense budget by half
   or more; pay our United Nations debt and then some; make Joycelyn
   Elders surgeon general and Lani Guinier attorney general; triple
   social services and the federal education budgets from kindergarten to
   graduate studies; stop the barbaric system of paying for schools
   through property taxes and finance the whole package by really
   clobbering corporate welfare queens, which as everyone and her dog
   knows, will bring in billions. There won't be a depression in reaction
   to this because I'm keeping Alan Greenspan -- I can't get rid of him:
   He's newly married and, besides, we all know he is the real Master of
   the Universe -- and Alan has agreed to fadiddle with interest rates
   and such to keep Wall Street abuzz, and if we see any corporate
   slacking, we'll nationalize ahead of schedule!

   I'll be raising everyone's taxes, which I expect you to pay without
   all this undignified, ungenerous whining. I am a tax-and-spend sort of
   evolutionary socialist these days, and if we all cooperate we can have
   a very nice country. The rich can still be rich but not nearly as
   rich; the poor will be much less poor, better fed and healthy and
   educated and housed; and the middle classes will find that even though
   their paychecks are smaller, there are all these great services Uncle
   Sam can provide, like mass transit and health care. Everyone gets
   health care; insurance and pharmaceutical giants be damned! Doctors
   and scientists will get paid well so they have no excuse for screwing
   up, and we'll just have to support this until our improved educational
   system and universally elevated standard of living have reconstituted
   us all as kinder, more connected creatures driven by love, generosity,
   joy and a desire for planetary survival rather than by our grubby
   private hoarding and primate paranoidal fears. AIDS care expanded and
   safe sex taught in every classroom, condom and clean needle
   distribution; and gazillions to stop the global AIDS pandemic, which
   is not over by a long shot. All that goes without saying, and it's
   about time!

   Forget the Balanced Budget, is what I'm trying to say. Who thought
   that one up? I don't know anyone on earth who isn't in debt. Forget
   "trickle-down," too, by the way. As Bob Dole reminded me over coffee
   yesterday, it's not a winner. Listen, someday there won't even be
   money, but that'll probably have to wait for my second term.

   Secretary of State Kweisi Mfume and I are deep in discussion about the
   international scene, doing all the obvious things, supporting
   democratic socialism or whatever looks better than gangsterism and
   psycho-nationalism in the Eastern bloc with meaningful financial aid
   packages instead of hoping that a few more McDonald's franchises in
   Budapest will do the job. We want tightened nuclear arms control and
   an end to the utter insanity of international arms marketeering, and
   that means you, too, France, Germany, Britain and South Africa!

   I have no idea how to finance this, but I'd rather admit that a
   civilization needs money than pretend that we can have one without
   money. John Kenneth Galbraith, Toni Morrison, Larry Kramer, lesbian
   activist and novelist Sarah Schulman, bell hooks and Alexander
   Cockburn are going to head a special investigation to find out where
   all the money went. I want to thank Prof. Raisa Gorbachev for her
   invaluable economics tutorials.

   Karen Finley is taking over the National Endowment for the Arts and
   Dr. Cornel West, the National Endowment for the Humanities; and I'm
   giving each of them the same budget as Raytheon spent on those Patriot
   missiles that didn't actually do anything useful over Tel Aviv. Public
   television gets a big raise, too, which I know will be great news to
   Henry Louis Gates and the folks at Dyke TV who will be taking over
   daily operations. For Health and Human Services secretary, I'm
   thinking, maybe Roseanne.

   I'm pardoning Susan McDougal just 'cause I like her style, and I want
   everyone to leave Hillary alone. It does take a village to raise a
   child! Kenneth Starr I'm hiring to begin investigating and prosecuting
   the Pentagon brass who couldn't be bothered to check out those
   soldiers exposed to chemicals in the Persian Gulf War -- wasn't that
   disgusting? Enough with the oversight committees already: These poor
   people aren't stressed, they're sick. Let's get down and dirty, Ken:
   Go after those malfeasant generals with the sharpest fang in your
   pit-bull armory. I expect you to work well with my new press
   secretary, Jimmy Carville. And thanks, Jimmy, for agreeing to divorce
   that Republican you married. I'll introduce you to some nicer, smarter

Aside from making a point about his own poem, John Kinsella has a point
about settler countries in the commonwealth, as hisown work in the form
demonstrates: check out, if you can order it from Oz, his _The Silo: a
pastoral symphony_ & his latest (for a month or so I suspect), _Lightning
Tree_ [both from Fremantle Arts Centre Press] or _The Undertow: new &
selected poems_ [from Arc Publications in the UK]. Those of you lucky
enough to catch him on his recent tour of the US & Canada will have heard
him read some of these poems as well as talk about what he's doing with the
'genre'.
Then I begin to think about who does this in Canada: John Newlove, whose
early, minimalist, poems of farm life already break away from
pastoral-as-such, GB, at times, & maybe especially in sections of
_Autobiology_, Robert Kroetsch in parts of his ongoing poem, _Field Notes_,
especially _Seed Catalogue_; & there are more. Do some of Atwood's poems
count (I think so).
Robert Adamson, one of Australia's finest poets, certainly practices
anti-pastoral, even in a book probably seen as 'pure' pastoral by some
reviewers, the sharply etched & shifty _The Clean Dark_.
Bill Manhire has written a few poems I would call anti-pastoral-as-theory
(but not obvious about it), in New Zealand.

Most poems that fit this concept, in my fuzzy thinking this morning, would
seem fairly mainstream, but have something that undermines a regular
reading in them. I imagine John, who has obviously been thinking about
this, would present a much more complex argument...

Just off the top of my head...

Congratulations to List Mom Charlie Bernstein and Susan B. for a wonderful
collaboration on their new artist's book _Little Orphan Anagram_ just
released this past Saturday by Granary Books! It's got a gorgeous lime
green hard-bound cover filled with hand-painted illustrations by Susan and
glorious language by Charles. Each edition is unique as Susan painted every
single page by hand. A true work of art.

Check it out!

Miller Williams said thank you--like many a poet reading at a university
somewhere--so that the crowd would know his poem was over.  And shuffled off.
CNN didn't know whether to call him "poet laureate" or "inaugural poet."
Clinton seemed to like at least one line and was captured by the network with
that moony look he produces, eyes squinting and just a little misty, looking
up, jaw firmly set and the corners of his mouth turned down--oh afternoon
sublime and profound on the shining hill!  At least he understands something
of performance values!  Nearly made me weep, the whole scene, not just for the
spectacle of this poetry projected into national ceremony but because there
appeared to be real people sitting out in the cold.

So, from here, where it's warm as pixels, I ask you, citizens of Poetics,
which is it--Maya Angelou or Miller Williams?  Who will call Coolidge and
Fagin?  What do you make of it all?

keith, yeah, i found it sorta sad, and i ended up feeling sorry for
williams, fer chrissakes...

i mean, writing pretty strictly out of that aesthetic (for which i don't
"blame" williams)---an aesthetic that employs pronouns somewhat less than
self-consciously, and the only one presumably understood by the
population---it's difficult on such a day not to project backward and
forward, to give "us" something to think about in "historical" terms...
without complicating things by forcing the aesthetic moment to its
crisis... still, it seemed to me williams put it forth with some
humility...

i thought the prayer that followed was actually more... complicated in its
way, more suggestive wrt turmoil, conflict, etc...

anyway///

best,

Book suggestion:
but beautiful: a book about jazz
by George Dyer. (FSG/Northpoint. Northpoint, by the way, is now an imprint of
Double Take, the mag out of Duke. To add a little puzzle to it all, they are
using the logo of the Northpoint Press of Berkeley, that was also distributed
by FSG.

Anyway, in a curious mode de seance, Dier evokes the inside worlds of Monk,
Ben Webster, Ellington, Lester Young, Mingus, Chet Baker, Art Pepper, and a
few others. Dyer is English - and tho the language is driven, compelling,
there's a suspicion of the English exclusive obsession with the exotic
detail/circumstances of the lives and the art. The artist as disturbed bird
in the cage syndrome. Nevertheless, Dyer's obsession rings true. Ironically,
given the twists and turns around Adorno on this list before the hollidays,
the book is prefaced by an Adorno quote: "Producers of great art are no
demigods, but fallible human beings, often with neurotic and damaged
personalities."  A good read.

 Alan -- the Eric Mottram gathering is still on & should happen in
September '97 in two places: London & a small village on the Welsh the
name of which escapes me now (Jeff Nuttall has moved back there a few

Everything that allows men to become rooted, through

_one_ language, is the principle of alienation which
constitutes man as privileged in so far as he is what he is,
[...] imprisoning him in contentment with his own reality

no,, not the first. George Bowering is wearing a tie. Unfortunately, it's
all he's wearing right now. Fortunately, it's a very long tie. Er, at
least. . .

Decolonisation has been a hot topic/issue of discussion in preparation for
this conference.  The question raised in the earlier part of this month
which was raised by European and USA abolition members was: "Why Discuss
Decolonization?"  Soon you will find a thread archived in the Conference
Discussion Group with earlier comments by Abolition members and Pacific
Indigenous Peoples.  This discussion has been encouraged to continue for
growth and clearer understanding of our Pacific Issues.

AGENDA

HITI TAU is our Te Ao Maohi (Indigenous Peoples of Tahiti) host and will

"Background Information on conference coordination and organization"

* The Abolition 2000 Interim Management Group (IMG), which manages
the operation of the Network between meetings, will oversee the
agenda and program.  Its members will meet frequently to assess
how the conference is going and make adjustments as needed.  Judy
Rubenstein has been retained by the IMG as a facilitator and
"ombudsman" (a person who people with complaints can come to).

* Simultaneous French/English translation will be provided during
plenary sessions, and there will be rapporteurs for plenary
sessions.  We hope to produce daily reports, in French and
English, for distribution to delegates.  If possible, these daily
reports will also be posted on the internet.

* The Abolition 2000 conference will deal with information
sharing, development of coordinated strategies, and
administrative management of the Network over the next year. We
anticipate that resolutions and proposals dealing with both
substance and process will be put forward during the conference.
Delegates are encouraged to present written proposals and
resolutions to the IMG before the Saturday plenary session.

* The Abolition 2000 Statement is the "glue" that holds the
Abolition 2000 Network together.  It represents a kind of
"contract" among the nearly 700 non-governmental groups around
the world who have signed it, and it is the starting point for
our common work at this conference.
<http://hookele.com/abolition2000/abostatement.html>

* One day of the conference is devoted to working group meetings.
Abolition 2000 currently has 10 working groups. Additional
working groups can be formed based on participants' interests.
Existing working groups are: 1) Nuclear Weapons Convention;
2)Non-Nuclear Security Model for Europe; 3) Chernobyl and Nuclear
Power; 4) Media, Communication and Outreach; 5) CTBT and Beyond;
6) Fissile Materials; 7) Overcoming Nuclear Threats/Legal Issues;
8) Lobbying, Dialogue and Campaigning; 9) NPT PrepComs; and 10)
Newsletter.

MEXICAN LABOR NEWS AND ANALYSIS
URGENT ACTION BULLETIN - JANUARY 18, 1997

          APPARENT KIDNAPPING OF COMMUNITY ACTIVIST
               TEPOZTLAN, MORELOS, MEXICO
                    from Andrew Wheat
     Laura Berenice Medina Bocanegra, a community activist and
daughter of outspoken Tepoztlan leader Doctor Adela Bocanegra,
appears to have been  kidnapped late in the afternoon of Friday
Jan. 17, 1997 in the nearby city of Cuernavaca, where she works.
     The day of her disappearance, Ms. Medina Bocanegra sent a
fax from her office at the National Water Commission in
Cuernavaca. The fax said that two men had just followed her on
foot in Cuernavaca's main plaza. The fax also described three
vehicles that had followed her in recent days, including the
license plate numbers of two of these cars. One of the vehicles
(for which she provided a  license plate number) was
a patrol car of the State Judicial Police.
     Just before her disappearance around 5 or 6 pm, Ms. Medina
Bocanegra ducked into the Mexico Zacatepec bus station in
Cuernavaca to call home because she said she was being followed
again and felt threatened. When family members went to the
station  to pick her up, she was gone.
     The community of Tepoztlan has gained international
attention for the successful campaign it has waged to prevent
investors supported by Morelos Governor Jorge Carrillo Olea from
building a luxury development on the outskirts of their colonial
town. In retribution over the course of the last year,  Morelos
authorities ambushed a caravan of peaceful protesters, killing
one man; imprisoned Amnesty International Prisoner of Conscience
Gerardo Demesa Padilla for one year; issued arrest warrants
for dozens of movement leaders; and apprehended four other
Tepoztlan men on January 11, 1997 -- torturing at least two of
them.
     The case of Laura Beranice Medina Bocanegra is unusual,
however, in that no known warrant had been issued for her arrest
and State officials have initially said that she is not in their
custody. There is fear for her safety.

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Please send immediate
telegrams/telexes/faxes:
- expressing concern for  Laura Beranice Medina Bocanegra's
safety;
- urging that the license plate numbers she identified be
immediately
traced;
- urging that she be located and safely released to her family;
- urging that her presumed abductors be brought to justice;
- asking to be kept informed of the outcome of any investigation.

Sr. Editor

Balderas 68

MEXICO
                    BACKGROUND INFORMATION
     The state of Morelos has long been the scene of human rights
violations allegedly carried out by the security forces, mainly
in the context of land disputes. Indigenous people and peasants
are most often the victims of this violence. The frequent
association of powerful landowners (caciques) with local
authorities seriously undermines the legal rights
of the peasants and places them at a higher risk of human rights
violations.

     A development company, in association with the governor of
Morelos, Jorge Carrillo Olea, has been attempting to build a
multi-million dollargolf course and houses on common land, land
which is regarded by the inhabitants of Tepoztlan as sacred.  For
months, local people, including women, children and elderly, some
of them members of the CUT, have organized numerous peaceful
actions in their struggle to stop the development.

     On 10 April 1996, following one of those peaceful
demonstrations, Marcos Olmedo Gutierrez was extrajudicial killed
by members of thesecurity forces.  More than a hundred arrest
warrants were issued against members of CUT and some arrests took
place.  Moreover, community activists, including minors, were
repeatedly subjected to threats and ill-treatment.

     One of those previously arrested, Gerardo Demesa Padilla, a
teacher, remains in prison as a prisoner of conscience.

     Amnesty International delegations visited Tepoztlan in June
and December 1996 and were able to interview some of the human
rights defenders, community activists and members of CUT who had
been ill-treated, threatened and imprisoned.  The delegation
confirmed the reports of violent repression against those active
in promoting and protecting human rights.

NCADP ACTION ALERT
Issued:  January 15, 1997
Expires:  Februay 15, 1997

The Governor of Iowa is pushing to reintroduce the death penalty.  Given the
recent changes in the composition of the state house, he has a good chance
of succeeding.  Debate about his proposal is expected to begin in the state
senate in early February.  If it passes the senate, debate in the house will
start soon after.  The following is a message from our friends in Iowa:

        "With the November elections, the Republican Party gained control of the
State Senate (29-21).  The Democratic Party made gains in the State House,
but the Republicans remain in control (54-46).  There are 9 new senators and
21 new representatives.
        The governor, who was not up for reelection, is Republican.  Thus,
Republicans control both chambers of the legislature and the executive offices.
        The governor is once again pushing the death penalty.  He suggests that the
reason for Republicans gaining control of the Senate is because ant-death
penalty Democrats were opposed by pro-death penalty Republicans.
        The Republican leadership of the Senate and House have stated that they
believe there are not enough votes to pass a death penalty bill.  Death
penalty opponents must not believe a death penalty will surely be defeated.
        Iowans Against the Death Penalty and lobbyist from a variety of
organizations have been counting expected votes on the death penalty issue.
It appears that the vote in both chambers will be extremely close.
        It is expected that a death penalty bill will be introduced in the Senate
shortly after the legislative session begins on January 13.
        We need to have legislators hear from those oppose the death penalty."

Please contact at least one of the following Republican state senators:
Dennis Black, Don Gettings, Rod Halvorson, Steven Hansen, Wally Horn, Steve
King, Jim Lind, and Mary Lundby.
                The Honorable (Insert Name)

                Des Moines, IA 50319
                (515) 242-6108--Fax

Please let them know:
                --You have sympathy for victims of violent crime
                --The death penalty is not a deterrent
                --The death penalty is more expensive than life imprisonment
                --The death penalty (killing) is no way to show that killing is wrong
                --Any other information you deem useful.

        Also, please send letters of support and encouragement to The Honorable
John Redwine at the above address.  Senator Redwine is a newly elected
Republican who opposes the death penalty.

Letters to the editor should be sent also.  Each of the following newspapers

Gabrielle, I made an item on the Tahitian Hiti  Tau movement for New Zealand

Subject:      Re: Charles Bernstein's Crime

A few days ago, Charles Bernstein posted a note regarding the new
Boundary 2, letting us know, in a humorous way, that it includes some
material regarding him and his work. He noted that it includes some
poems, an autobiographical interview, a more conventional interview "On
Poetry, Language and Teaching" and the writing "Experiments" list. He
ended the post by noting that the "dossier fully reveals my guilt...;
my question is: what is the crime?" I've read through the material,
and, in the interests of internet conversation, am ready to give my
views on the "crime".

I am unsure of B's poetry. It is playful, diffident, relentlessly
"constructed," a made object (as, of course, is all poetry) that avoids
the sentimentalities of meaning as he strives very hard for an invented
syntax and grammar by which to chart the background radiation of decay
and dissolution that haunts our discourse -- the half-life of sense and
sensibility as it dissolves into noise. In the grand scatter of these
words, phrases, forms I can sometimes glimpse, if only by glint and
gleam, the general, if not implacable, heatdeath of all those small
economies we so fondly call "you" and "I"...

Yet it is with such relief to strike upon moments of coherence, even if
gnomic, in the poems, those passages where meaning lights up the
non-sense or a-sensical -- momentary stillings of the surrealist crush
of random words and phrases. Though, perhaps, not "random." They may
mean something to their author and they may mean something to someone
other than me.

But it seems, then, that this "meaning" is very casual and unconnected
from the words, almost accidental... How many of your readers can you
lose before you are no longer a writer, just a scribbler?

B argues compellingly and convincingly for difficulty and complexity,
for a writing that goes against the grain of conventional use and sense
-- both in poetry and prose. It is of note that his own prose is often
beautiful and measured and strikingly clear and direct. What, in fact,
is the relation of the two -- why are they different, or, why are they
so different? What does B seek in the poetry, what "experience" of
words and phrases, rhythms and forms... And then why write about the
poetry in prose? As though the poetry required a justification, an
explanation.

B asked, in his post, 'what is the crime' the dossier gathers evidence
against and of course he meant this in a humorous way and in the same
spirit of affectionate challenge I would submit that the dossier
collects evidence regarding B's efforts to destroy the evidence itself:
his testimony enacts the erasure of "meaning", a community property of
a certain value and for which the defacement of has always carried
certain penalties and censures.

B asks what the crime is... Next, we must ask what the sentence is.

Dear colleagues,

We are writing in response to the massive bipartisan
attack that we have witnessed  against the Oakland School
Board's decision to recognize Ebonics, or African American
English (AAE). The Linguistic Society of America recently
passed a resolution in support for the board on linguistic
and educational grounds, but it has received scarce mention
in the media relative to the outpouring of mean-spirited and
ignorant assertions that claim AAE is "bad grammar,"
"slang," "a pseudo-dialect" and a "pseudo-language." Most
disappointing to us has been the reaction of the normally
liberal spokespersons who have managed to construe the
recognition of AAE as representing a potential threat and
handicap to the thousands of African American children in
schools. We are especially alarmed at the solutions being
proposed, which invariably seek to use shame and guilt at
the natural language learned from one's parents to "attract"
the children to the "standard d ialect."  This "real language"
is held up in comparison as "pure" and "grammatical,"
"logical" and "understandable," in complete and convenient
ignorance of decades of linguistic research that reveal the
emergence of a standard as historical and political artifact.

We can find no contemporary linguist who "grades"
languages or dialects. As the old saying goes, a language is
just a dialect with an army and a navy.  But it is true,
standard American English is the language of success and
power and economic opportunity, often called "the cash
language". There has been progress in fighting race
prejudice. We must not let language prejudice become
legitimate. Prejudice against American Sign Language as a
system of "dumb gestures" is being overcome, by studying
the intricacy of the sign system, so that we now see signers
on TV and 5yr-olds eager to learn their names in Sign. The
same effort should be made on behalf of dialects in the US,
including regional  dialects which are also the basis of
prejudice. The US is making some progress in extending our
collective vision of success to be inclusive of the way
different people look, but we need to incorporate tolerance
of language variety for successful adults.

So what are the real risks that African American children
face in the current United  States? From ignorance of the
dialect by teachers and officials: a substantial increase
in the likelihood of being stigmatized as "learning disabled"
and "language delayed" as they enter the school system.
Because of the media attention to this controversy perhaps a
million children who want to speak up in class discussion
will not speak in class this week. Speakers of other dialects
may be similarly inhibited. Evidence suggests that by fourth
grade many children go silent because they do not feel
welcome in their schools.

Psycholinguistic research has demonstrated the rich
system of phonological, morphological  and syntactic rules
known to AAE-speaking 5 year olds. These rules exemplify
the universal  principles true of all natural languages, with
the logical and semantic precision that is the crowning
achievement of the human mind. In addition, they have
mastered the language  particular properties of African
American English so crudely caricatured in the press: the
use of negative concord (NOT the same as "double and
triple negation"), the use of the unique aspect marker BE
(NOT "unconjugated use of be"), and subtle phonological
constraints on morphology. Finally, they are already
code-switching into standard dialect when circumstances
require it, in the recognition that not everyone shares their
dialect.

The Oakland School Board is to be congratulated for
recognizing these strengths and for recommending that
teachers be trained to encourage the transition to bidialectal
competence, not by the traditional and hate-ridden methods
of guilt and punishment, but by  linguistic education,
metalinguistic awareness, and pride in the linguistics skills
gained.

We are writing to express our embarrassment and
rage at the current situation, and we hope  you will join us
in extending a hand of support and encouragement to all
those people who use AAE as their natural language, those
who teach children who speak it, and those who have been
made to feel ashamed of once having spoken it.  If you
would like to share this letter with any other newsgroups or
colleagues, we urge you to forward it to them and add your
name as a co-signer.

George & others,

So you don't hear about it too late this time, Kenward Elmslie's reading as
part of the Rendezvous reading series in Seattle next week, January 28, at
New City Theater on the corner of 11th Av & Olive Street on Capitol Hill.
I don't know what time it starts, but I'll be back in time to hear it.
Perhaps one of the many Seattle lurkers can post some more information on
this.  (I don't think we're all out of town.)

I'm reading Doug Nufer's Never Again (a two hundred page manuscript with NO
word used more than once).  I just finished Brian Eno's A Year (better, or
at least more interesting, than I expected) & also have with me, but have
barely opened yet, Potocki's Manuscript Found in Saragossa; Mandel &
Davidson's Absence Sensorium; & Moxley's Imagination Verses (this last is
the Seattle reading group book for February).

I'm out of town, so I'm I'm not listening to too much that's not
work-related: tapes of various versions of 3-4 interactive computer pieces
by Martin Bartlett mostly, and the final mix of Suspended Music (Deep
Listening Band/Long String Instrument collaboration) out, finally, next
week.

I'm interested in the unmentioned, but noticeable, distinction between
using tunes to keep one's head clear & using tunes to clear one's head out.


I'm also hearing Cesaria Evora & John Zorn's Masada Chamber Ensembles/Bar
Kokhba, which probably fit in the first of these two categories.  I'm also
intermittently hearing a quirky & entertainingly corny tape of David
Mahler's Volunteer Park Conservatory Orchestra playing dance band music
from ca. 1900-1930 - not useful for either kind of clarity, though.

Otherwise I'm mostly just hearing radio which I hate almost everywhere I go.

So I thought, "who needs an invitation? What if I wrote my own inauguration
poem?" And in the manner of bad ideas itgrew like a family of rabbits until
I suddenly found myself writing retroactive inaugural poems for all of the
presidents who never had them. I would begin with Warren Harding. Something
about teapots. When it occurred to me that it had already been written. Do
you remember the song Marlene Dietrich sings in "Destry Rides Again?" "See

Here is a poem for this polyvocal environment.

VOICES

The voices say various things.

They urge me to write something
pleasantly disconcerting,
that sounds as if it's been translated
from some indeterminate language.

They urge me to work
the inadequacy of language
the way a stubborn surfer
will work the waves
until they yield their gift.

So I plunge into fragments,
ready to expend on each one
my precious supply of energy;
ready to start again (each time
with a touching sense of hope),
willing to suspend temporarily
if not disbelief at least my despair.

Detecting how each of them is
my own, my very own perfect voice,
demanding to be taken seriously.

English language is consistently expanding and changing.  So why is it now
such a big issue?  Why can't we have both _ standard English and regional
English?  I think they should teach standard English and acknowledge
regional conversational habits - but standard English is the main language
for communicating to other countries, etc.

Plus, why is there so much overly political announcements on this
particular listing? Not that I am against such announcements, but from
certain individuals that is all you get - very rarely do they comment on
poetics, etc. Just thinking out loud.

Is Bill Clinton in the real world; is Michael Jordan in the real world; am I
in the real world; is Dennis Rodman in the real world; is flesh in the real
world; are you in the real world; is the poet to the president in the real
world?  If I work am i in the real world? If I read am I in the real world?
If I write am i int he real world? IF I can't read am I in the real world?
Is "A Poem for Emily" which was written by the poet to the president in the
real world, which reads in part  - "sometime I know you will have them read
this / so they will know I love them and say so / and love their mother" and
ends "which is I stood and loved you while you slept"?  Does this make more
sense than what Duane Davis calls Charles Bernstein's "heatdeath of all
those small economies we so fondly call 'you' and 'I'"?  Is the poet a
better poet if he is in the real world?  How does he know he is in the real
world?  If he reads books is he in the real world?  If he doesn't read books
but only experiences the real world and then writes books is he in the real
world?  If he is a she and isn't a mother and isn't loved by the poet to the
president is she in the real world?

I thought Miller Williams expressed humane, hearty sentiments rather woodenly &
unrhythmically.  But it was clearly INAUGURAL.  I'll be more interested

according to the Times today (science section), we're all in the real
world - but it's a non-vacuum suffused in quantum foam - a vast sea
of virtual particles which actually become real in contact with

I didn't hear the poem at the time, but heard it later on NPR and saw it
read on the Lehrer newshour.  It's hard to tell which is worse, Angelou or
Williams, though I'd vote for Williams mainly on the basis of its awful
title, a reversal of Clinton's campaign book, _Between Hope and History_.  I
immediately went to my bookshelf and read John Ashbery's Bicentennial poem
"Pyrography" as a purgative measure.

In the paper this morning, I read that Williams is the father of the
country-rock singer Lucinda Williams.  So all is not lost.

        Mr. President, will you buzz a state secret into my hot
ear?  I will strain to hear your trailing rasp before I'm grabbed
by secretive service, only having caught "the frequency is."
Can I call you Bill, can we play a round of poker with Kelsey
Grammer, and then would that be poetry, the return of the subject?
Our scene was better set by camera 5 but the program director
wanted my eyes as they misted on 3.
        Here is a hat's off to Sherry Brennan who touched me with a
cattle prod this morning, that completed circuit which I hold to
and "reply."  It's a fair bet this morning that all players are real,
at least as so as the play, or so I might suspect between glances
from the window to the tv to the computer screen.

I thought those of you who have friends among the Russian poets
(Dragomoschenko, Prigov, Parshchikov, etc) would be interested in writing
a letter as per the following which was sent to me by a lit prof at
Petersburg, Georgij Levinton.  You may ask, why should we care what
happens at Frankfurt but it's all interrelated and the cuts in Slavic
studies, now that the Soviet Union is no longer there and no longer
fashionable, are very sad.  Also the prospects of pan-German studies are
even sadder.

Dear Garrik:

I am sending you the following in the hope that you may be able to garner a
bit of support (in the form of faxed-letters) from your University. The
matter is urgent and quite serious as it bodes ill for the future of all
Slavic studies in Germany. Please don't hesitate to spread the news in the
Petersburg scene. The Petersburg Jewish University has already reacted.

Thanks for your help, and best to Lara
Hubertus

The Institute for Russian and East European History at the University of
Frankfurt in Germany, is threatened with closure. This would mean the end
of all teaching and research on R/EE history in the city of Frankfurt and,
in light of other threatened closures, in the entire state of Hessen. It
would also mean that only Ancient and German history would be taught at
Frankfurt University.

We have been participating in a campaign to save the Institute, that has
thus far resulted in newspaper, televsion, and radio coverage, and garnered
the support of East European specialists from across Germany. Unfortunately
the history faculty has only reiterated its intention to cut the Institute.
For this reason, we are seeking to increase international pressure on
Hessen's Ministry of Science, which must approve any proposed cuts, and
have already received letters from the Petersburg Jewish University, the
Deutsches Historisches Institut Warschau, among others. We are urgently
requesting, therefore, that you write a brief letter (in English) in
support of keeping the Institute to the Ministry of Science. Please feel
free to write a group letter including other members of your department and
to distribute this letter further.

A word on the Institute:
        Staff: the chair (currently vacant), one assistant professor
(formally two), one librarian, one secretary, and apprs. 90 students of
history.
        R/EE Studies Program: Frankfurt is one of very few universities
with such a program (including literature, economics, and political
science). Professors from the other faculties have protested the cut in
history, but without success.
        Library: 35,000 volumes plus periodicals, with strong points on
Russian, Polish, and Eastern European Jewish history. It will be sold off
should the Institute be closed.
        Activities include an exchange program which has brought over 300
scholars from the CIS to Germany as guest professors and researchers.
        Former Chairs include Dietrich Geyer, Klaus Zernack, Dietrich
Beyrau

Reason for the Cut:
The Ministry of Science has directed that 70,000 DM be saved by position
cuts in the history faculty. The other historians (who have prevented the
vacant chair from being filled for three years in order to appropriate
funding and an asst. professor position for themselves), have decided to
cut the Institute not only to fulfill the directive and to avoid cuts
closer to home, but also to enrich themselves further: they will get the
"left-overs" (as the Institute is worth much more than 70,000): an asst.
professor position, librarian, secretary, and 20,000 DM annually for books
and research assistants. No Russian or East European expert has been
consulted, nor have any academic reasons been cited.

The letters are thus aimed at a purely political audience (the Minister);
possible issues to be raised include:
        The growing political importance of R/EE history after 1989/1991.
        The special importance of R/EE history in Germany in light of
National Socialism and the Second World War, the particular experience of
Eastern Germany after 1945, as well as the current process of European
integration.
        As the city with the highest percentage of "auslaendische
Mitbuerger," Frankfurt should not be cutting but expanding its outreach to
other cultures.
        The cutting of the Institute and the resulting emphasis on the
teaching of German history at Frankfurt University would send the wrong
message to students and German society regarding the importance of
multiculturalism and the integration of "foreigners."

Time is short--the decision should be made in the next weeks, and your
letters are urgenly needed. Please fax them to the following address (with
copies to us) as soon as possible.

turning into a test case on the future of our discipline in Germany.

TamTam Books is my little adventure into the world of making, sharing, and
producing 'books.'   I should have three titles out (hopefully) by the end
of this year.  They are:

Boris Vian's I SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE
Guy Debord's Consid=E9rations sur I'assassinat de G=E9rard Lebovici

The third title is a little secret for now.

For John Kinsella re landscape/pastoral:
Kamau Brathwaite maintains that the shape of the landscape where the poet
grows up determines the shape of the poems -- a slightly different way of
admitting the "pastoral": therefore, his own poems derive from the
archipelago, Frost's from the tended woods, etc.  Don't know if he has
written on this; perhaps someone else on the list may -- but I have talked
with him about it a number of times.
Reading: Chester
Himes, Quality of Hurt & Plan B
still plowing through the last 6 months of journals/reviews including two
ace issues of American Speech (can't recommend it highly enough)

Also just found that Merikanto Violin Concerto 2 which is pretty great.

New from primitive publications: "Why I Am Not  A Christian" by Jefferson
Hansen

An exploration of religion, thought, and what it means to be an inquisitor,
this work takes us on a demanding journey toward understanding.  The
means by which one gets there, however, challenge tradition and
complacency.  Jefferson Hansen himself writes:

"So the poem is a comic wrestle:  I as poet am too small and desperate to
'understand' the history -- which includes me -- in the traditional Western
sense of the word.  As Maurice Merleau-Ponty has pointed out, Western
philosophy aims to dominate being. The same can be said of some of its
most celebrated poetry.  This way of approaching experience not only
seems impossible to me, but also dangerous."

primitive publications is a press dedicated to bringing historically based
text toward a greater accessibility.  Published approximately six times a
year, the cost of one chapbook is $4.00, or $20.00 for six.  Titles include:

"A True Relation of the State May Last, 1616" Mary Hilton
"The Haunted Baronet" by Mark Wallace
"Lead, Glass and Poppy" by Kristin Prevallet
"Why I Am Not A Christian" by Jefferson Hansen

How does he mean this? the "shape of the poems" in what sense? And does this
imply a constant that's hard to imagine for some of us shape-shifters?

For the record, Frost was an ersatz new englander--don't think he came from
tended woods. Does that mean that we can choose where we grew up?

(If the landscape of childhood is the standard against which all others will
be measured--a hill is what hills were there, anything bigger is a
mountain--what about those of us who grew up peripatetic, or at least
transhumant, feeding in different pastures winter and summer?)

I know I've been around a long time....and sometimes I SOUND that way - but
- there was an Italian bilingual (English/Italian)poetry magazine in the
late 1970's/early 1980's called "tamtam" - the editors came to Sydney  &
attended readings...then published the stuff they liked...
I ran into them again at a weekend poetry festival in Verona in 1985...where
are they now ?   Is this the next incarnation...?

*** Poetry Performance ***

*** Kenward Elmslie performs Postcards on Parade ***
    at Kresge Town Hall, Friday January 24, 7 PM


Kenward Elmslie, poet / song writer / opera librettist / entertainer,
will be making a rare west coast appearance with the one-man performance
of his musical play, Postcards on Parade. In his feature-length
entertainment, Elmslie will impersonate such characters as Kevin, a
post-card dealer seduced by erotic fantasies of Cheeky Kiki of
Wiki-Waki-Woo, a postcard sea-nymph, and, fresh from Fort Lauderdale, the
postcard dealers' nemesis: a light-fingered cross-dresser with delusions
of lipsynch mega-stardom--Regina, La Postcard Queen of La Breeze Marina.
All of Kenward's lyrics are set to music composed by Steven Taylor, with
taped orchestrations by Bruce Coughlin. As if this weren't enough, to
flesh out his play Elmslie has fashioned billboards of postcard-collages
to enhance and sometimes chafe against his lyrics. These postcards have
been recently exhibited by the San Francisco Institute of Art, and the
National Portrait Gallery at the Smithsonian Institute in Washington DC.

*This is the first time Elmslie will perform Postcards on Parade in its
entirety. PLEASE TELL YOUR STUDENTS, FRIENDS AND COLLEAGUES.*

Kenward Elmslie's lyrics have been sung by such performers as Fredrica
von Stade, Nat King Cole, Brenda Lewis, Mabel Mercer, Barbara Cook and
Estelle Parsons. He has written the librettos to many operas, including
Ned Rorem's Miss Julie and Thomas Pasatieri's Three Sisters. His operas
have been performed by the New York City Opera at Lincoln Center, Houston
Grand Opera, Washington Opera at Kennedy Center and the Seattle Opera, to
name a few.

Elmslie is one of the original "New York School" poets, a motley group of
writers living in Manhattan during the advent of abstract-expressionism,
including such poets as Frank O'Hara, John Ashberry and Barbara Guest.
His books of poetry include Circus Nerves (Black Sparrow), Tropicalism (Z
Press) and Motor Disturbance (Columbia University). His poetry has been
anthologized in Postmodern American Poetry: A Norton Anthology, The Poets
of the New York School (University of Pennsylvania), An Anthology of New
York Poets (Random House) and From the Other Side of the Century: A New
American Poetry 1960-1990 (Sun & Moon).

This performance is being sponsored by Chinquapin, with help from Peter
Gizzi and the Gay, Lesbian and Bisexual Resource Center.

[First, let me excuse myself for possibly jumping into an older discussion:
today is the first day my boss is out of the office, first day in weeks I've
had a chance to read the recent messages]

     Mark Weiss wrote [referring to Brathwaite & landscape influencing
poetic "shape":

How does he mean this? the "shape of the poems" in what sense?

     I have not read a lot of Brathwaite (but would read more given the
chance) and only a little about him (ditto), but I believe the shape
discussed is most often expressed in terms of length -- length of lines,
length of strings of sounds (ie, as determined by line length, sentence
length, clause length, breathing patterns of readers (imagined or
otherwise), probably other lengths); and I think poems have been discussed
in this manner before: was it Donald Davie who writes that he lost his
misunderstanding of and condecension to Whitman, Ginsburg and Olson when he
travelled across the N. American midwest for the first time? I think it was
Davie, but whoever it was, he was a British Man who confesses to previously
always thinking that N. American free verse's full (or full of emptiness)
pages were the result of a more purely intellectual/historical bucking of
the relatively gentle _via media_ of pentameter and trimeter verse.
     Derek Walcott, whose center of gravity is somewhere between Brathwaite
and Davie, but probably closer to Davie, has talked about the writing of
Stein, Hemingway and Faulker as  being less an attempt to portray their
landscapes in poetic form than an attempt to describe the attempt to do so.


>For the record, Frost was an ersatz new englander--don't think he came from
>tended woods. Does that mean that we can choose where we grew up?

     I disagree with your revision of the record, if indeed I understand you
correctly. Frost being here talked about as a poet, not a child. And who is
to say that a) where we grew up is "our landscape" and/or b) that one does
not choose their landscapes.
     My mother for example, who has lived in New Hampshire for 2/3 of her
adult life, grew up in Michigan. She has often said that when she first came
to New England, when she was about 20, she had the incredible sensation of
being comfortable in the landscape for the first time in her life. Not that
she'd felt out of place before, but she had never known how much she loved
the New England sense of distance, of order, etc.

     Of if you are objecting to "tended landscape": it most certainly was
"tended" in that it most certainly wasn't wild. Order abounds in those
woods, or once did.


     It is five o'clock. If I had more time I would pursue some thoughts
which perhaps the list can help me with, namely (briefly), what can be said
about the mimetic quality of poetry today? Do members of the list hold with
the (I think, inherently) mimesis that poetry must perform in order for it
to resemble anything (resemble rather than be about)? Or do people think I
have it all wrong? I'm not sure myself, and hopefully will be able to touch
on it more soon. Is or is not the mimetic capability of poetry a fundamental
assumption for any writer who uses formal methods to, for example, suggest a
political stance?


best,

Matthias

(dressed nattily in work attire; can't get enough of The Stooges or McCoy
Tyner but recommends to members of the list whose musical tastes seem
considerably less revolutionary than their poetic ones that they check out
the latest by The Krystal Methodists: "New World Odor" (not sure where to
get it: but Krystal Methodists does appear on a careful internet search);
reads voraciously but with little understanding the new _Canna_ by Geoffrey
Hill.

Hello Tosh -

Well...um...my memory's what they call a little bit "shot" I think...I can
remember keywords - you know, like "tamtam", & I can half-remember which
Australian poets  were published in it......but I might be able to find a
copy at home & let you know later on....

I was certain YOU would be able to tell me that YES you were the same mag...

Anyway,
Bye for now
Pam

Tam Tam magazine was edited by Adriano Spatola & Guilia Niccolai, poets
belonging to the post-"Novissimi" generation (Spatola was a member of
the Gruppo '63"). Both these poets have been published in English
translations � check out Red Hill Press. Paul Vangelisti & others have
translated them. Adriano died in 1988. BTW, both have poems in volume
two of the MILLENNIUM anthology. -- Pierre

Everything that allows men to become rooted, through
values or sentiments, in _one_ time, in _one_ history, in
_one_ language, is the principle of alienation which
constitutes man as privileged in so far as he is what he is,
[...] imprisoning him in contentment with his own reality
and encouraging him to offer it as an example or impose
it as a conquering assertation. -- Maurice Blanchot

Actually, I think it's A. Philip Randolph, unless you're reading about a
nother Philip all together --

seriously, though -- I happen at this very moment to be reading an old
bio. of Randolhp, and would love to compare notes with you on the book
you're reading --


AND EVERYBODY -- in the PBS American Experience I watched last night,
titled "You Don't Have to Ride Jim Crow," the reunited FOR freedom riders
recollected a respite when they visited Black Mountain College in the
midst of their battles to integrate the bus lines of the South -- this
around 1947 -- would like to learn MUCH more of this --

Not much to choose between there --

But, to judge from this 1957 photo I'm looking at (NY World Telegram),
Angelou was probably a much better night club entertainer than Williams
-- She's bare foot in the photo -- is that a touch of calypso
authenticity, or a sign of her past in Stamps -- Was she, as is reported,
the best calypso singer ever to have come from Arkansas?

What you see below is all I received of yesterday's list.  Could someone who
saved it please try to send it to me again?

P.S.  Elmslie's reading at Beyond Baroque last Fri. was one of the most
inspiring (in terms of creativity, skill, and sheer loopiness) performances
of -any- kind I've seen in a long time.  Nice and crowded, too.

I think that the landscape in which one grows up certainly affects
the way one THINKS and perceives things.  As for as affecting how one
writes,  I suppose
this line of thought could be pursued.  I'm a thorough East Coaster
(Pennsylvanian,  to be exact),
and so KNOW dense forests, trees,  hills,  valleys,  modest mountains
(Appalachians) an ocean,  beach sand,  lakes etc. I would like to think
that somehow my thoughts are WOODED or shaded,  or something
irreplaceable about forests,  hills,  valleys.  There is a certain
built-in apprehension in living in a place where you can't always see the
horizon,  or can't see what's ahead of you 100 yards,  or what's over the
hill,  around the bend,  because some feature of the landscape is
blocking your view,  and so inherently extending your expectation or
patience of what the "land" will reveal or give you (this could relate to
 Lacan's "fort-das" stage (far-near) of child development where the kid can
throw and retrieve a toy,  showing that she is learning/exploring to  cope
with separation and the coexisting fear/anxiety and pleasure that it
produces.
        On the other hand,  when I stayed a few nights in Tucson on the
mandatory road trip across the country,  I was keenly aware of the
landscape and how it was VERY ALIEN to me,  being from ANOTHER PLACE. It
was ALL SAND.  I was mesmerized.  Sand and cactus,  mostly the stunning
Seguarros (the classic cactus shape) 15' to 25'!  To an East Coaster this
was incredible, being in the presence of what seemed like  vigilant
guardians. I was also confused by the
washes,  river beds that are dry most of the year until the rainy season
fills them.  I thought they were ugly,  scars in the land,  in the middle
of the town.
There was virtually NOTHING to block the view--this is what I noticed
first. I felt naked,  like something had been stripped away from my
mind.  I also felt disoriented, because of the lack of geographical
features,  or my ignorance of the knowledge of them or how to READ them
or lack of experience with them.  I started thinking about how growing up
in this exposed environment would affect the mind and perceptions.  Would
it tend to make people more unguarded,  more accepting of what they know
and what they have?  I have noticed a tendency in
people of the midwest to be more unassuming then East Coasters.  I wonder
if someone from the Southwest has a clearer perception of things
(whatever that means),
because of this clarity in the environment.  Of course this sounds like a
silly overgeneralization,  but there may be some truth in it.  Any
geosociologists/pschologists in the house?

Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

It's wonderful how thoroughly one can be misunderstood, even on simple
matters. Brathwaite is reported as saying that the "shape" of our poems is a
consequence of the "shape" of our childhood landscape. I have no idea what
this means, and perhaps this was a casual and careless comment of the kind
we all make in conversation--the testing of an idea not worth pursuing. But
I respect the man far too much to imagine that he means as a native of a
small island he should be expected to write in small, isolate lines or
breath-groups, whereas Whitman, a Long Islander, should write longer lines.
This seems to me to be patently absurd; I don't doubt that one's physical
surroundings may have an impact on the roominess of one's verse, but I
expect that that impact would be rather harder to define. I picked up
Brathwaite's example of Frost (an Iowan, as I remember, who moved to New
England when he was 40--but my memory may be faulty) because it seemed to me
to demonstrate the absurdity of any easy one to one correspondence.
I'm still curious what, if anything, Brathwaite meant.

By the way, some years ago I discovered Frost's final, unpublished corrected
version of "Stopping by Woods..." He had done away with that awful inversion
in the first line (it had always embarassed him) and the Edgar-Guest-like
end rhymes of the first couplet, and he had finally managed to come up with
the last line whose lack he had covered by repeating the penultimate. In the
process, he had made the poem far more truly representative of the New
England in which I spent many years of my life. The first couplet in this
version reads: "I think I know whose woods these are;/ They aint here now,
they're over thar." And the famous last couplet now reads: "The woods are
silent, dark and deep./ I guess I shoulda brought the jeep." Only the fame
of the poem, I would guess, kept Frost from publishing this revision.

By the way, the rural New England of Frost's day was, and in many places
still is, a landscape of failing, rusty milltowns and farms gone back to
unkempt, untended second-growth forest.

Maya Angelou performed (dancing, singing, acting, writing) in Israel,
Rome, Africa and elsewhere and was regarded for the attention she paid to
all of her arts. She was in  Les Noirs/ The Blacks
in an off-Broadway production but I am not sure about France -- but it is
probably a safe assumption that you are remebering her career correctly.

Subject:      Frost: shave of the poem
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: Text/Plain

Frost's folks were Easterners. The family moved to San Francisco when Bobby was
still very young. Then his dad died. He and his mom (he then being about 11
years old) moved to New Hampshire and he graduated from a high school in
Lawrence MA (which, despite being a failed rusty milltown today--rusty, that
is, when it is not in flames) was a very thriving industrial town--Frost
graduated from high school there twenty years before one of the most famous
strikes in the country took place under the leadership of the Wobblies.

Anyway, he wrote, farmed and taught school then left with HIS family for
England just before he turned forty.  In England he wrestled with Ezra Pound; a
friendly activity among manly poets of their day.

Then he came back to the States, became an institutionalized cracker-barrel
poet, and won a lot Big Prizes, and died at 88.

Landscapes and poem shapes (polka dots and moonbeams) all have a connection in
poetry but I don't believe that one's childhood has very much to do with it,
unless say, a poet grows up in a landscape battered by war, or some other
situation that leaves indeliable marks on the psyche.

I grew up in a land of tri-colored pixels at which one stared for hours.
Alternating and direct currents flowed like clockwork. They say that place has
changed little since  left.

I'm still curious what, if anything, Brathwaite meant.

By the way, the rural New England of Frost's day was, and in many places
still is, a landscape of failing, rusty milltowns and farms gone back to
unkempt, untended second-growth forest.

Well, Mark Weiss, I do think that revision is a hoot! (& I'd never ever
suspect you of being involved beyond your scholarly exegesis). Yet, I have
to wonder if there isnt some way to discuss at least some aspects of the
questions hovering about this thread.

I dont know that it enters in any direct way my poetry, but I do think that
growing up on the Canadian prairies had some kind of effect on my
perceptions. There's not much obvious change there, so you tend to
recognize minimal shifts. Does this have something to do with the music,
the art, & some of the writing i can connect with? I'm not sure how,
exactly, but I do think there's something happening in my responses that
could be said to derive from the early experience of a particular
landspace...

        Actually I did not say this, I said that Donald Davie (or someone)
suggested that the physical shape of his poems mimicked the "shape" of the
natural landscape in which they were written. I was careful not to apply
this directly to Brathwaite; nor did I "expect" him to write in any
particular way; at the same time, Davie's possibly colonizing and
undoubtedly rather condescending (to the circumstances of the N. American
poets mentioned) sense of "shape-of-the-land should appear in
shape-of-the-verse" might not necessarily be unknown to Brathwaite. I was,
perhaps naively, attempting to add a facet to the observations, not to smash
them. Perhaps as you say, Mark Weiss, the idea was never worth pursuing.

you are quite rite, aldon, i left out the initial A.  it's an interesting and
benignly easy read (no high theory, no "difficult" poetry). c.l. dellums (ron's
father?) was a key player.  randolph was not himself a porter, but a
high-profile socialist-oriented "race man" imported to help create a union.
there was tension between him and some of the porters involved in the organizing
drive (because he wasn't a porter, among other reasons, also, his seat was NYC
which took a sometimes belittling attitude toward other equally activist
chapters like oakland and especially chicago), but also a lot of cooperation and
mutually supportive strategizing.  its esp interesting cuz right now my U is ina
union drive so i'm learning a bit about the whole concept of "strategy," which
is foreign to my nature.--md

to be fair, and stephen vincent already posted on this, angelou's main shtick is
not being a poet; she's a public intellectual of a less academic stripe than
cornel west etc, but she has combined an acting career with activism, and has
written a series of autobiographies that were mainstay reading for many way
before her current incarnation as inaugural poet #1.

Not just Angelou -- the American cast of "The Blacks" (as it was billed
here) included the majority of the black American actors who would go on
to become known for their accomplishments on the screen in later years --
It was, by all accounts, an astonishing production --  I have seen
production stills -- does anybody know if any kind of recording was ever
made of that cast --

and even Angelou's prose is more interesting than those poems --

by the way, here is the unrevised first line of Miller Williams's poem,
retrieved from his wastebasket:

just reading carolyn heilbrun's new bio. of gloria steinem:  _the education
of a woman:  the life of gloria steinem_... most def. worth reading,
folks...

from the intro, which i think speaks to this question of place, person & memory:

"To compare Steinem's childhood with Charles Dickens's is to recognize a
phenomenon common to both, and probably common to many.  The months -- they
amounted to less than a year -- that Dickens spent in a blacking factory
reverberated throughout his life like a childhood assault, which indeed for
him they were.  As an adult he could hardly bring himself to speak of that
experience, even to his closest friends; he was able only to transform it
into the childhood adventures of his various characters.  Steinem's Toledo,
Ohio, years -- 1944-1951 -- were Dickens's blacking factory.  But, living
in a different time, she could speak of them, provided they could be
encapsulated in entertaining anecdotes; fearing the danger it might hold,
she walled off the pain of that time until she turned fifty.  For her,
Toledo explained everything, as for Dickens the blacking factory months
explained everything." (xxiii-xxiv)

i rather like this notion, that a particular period of one's life, lived
wherever or however, becomes a formative 'event' (kali may still be out
there---her book on formative traumatic events, _worlds of hurt_, certainly
relevant here)... it esp. appeals to me after having spent three years
mself working out such intensities, for a period of roughly eight years...
yes, landscape can be a major factor---constructed, certainly, i'll hedge
on the cognitive "view"... anyway, melville's whaling adventures (a year
and a half?) another example, but surely there are numerous authors whose
work reveals a preoccupation with a specific portion of their lives...

best,

I favor the direction the lettrists & situationists went with
translating topography to text with all their many notions of
psychogeography & the drift.  & in particular (being a visualpoet & all)
how much of the creative work became maps of typography.

& actually for myself living in the landscape has replaced the need for
organized texts, that Im much more likely to play sax or make things out
of clay which is probably why I havent written a book in the 6 years Ive
been out here.

From yesterday's Daily Variety (line breaks courtesy of my computer):

W.C. Fields Confounds Egypt's Censors

By Peter Warg

CAIRO (Variety) - Brush up your English or find a new job, Egyptian film
censors and translators are
being told.

The warning comes after a U.S. picture's reference to comedian W.C.
Fields was translated as "toilet
pastures," leaving viewers who could follow only the Arabic subtitles
wondering what in the world
the characters were talking about.

In another American film, "the computer is down" was rendered in the
Arabic subtitle as "the
computer is in the basement." Unfortunately, the scene made it clear that
the computer in question was
on an upper floor of a high-rise office building.

Though the subtitlers and censors were subjected to language exams before
their hiring, Dr. Gaber al
Asfour, undersecretary at the Ministry of Culture, has ordered retesting.
Those not passing muster
will be dismissed, al Asfour says.

In Egypt, foreign films screened in theaters or broadcast on TV are
subtitled, not dubbed. And when
it comes to cutting those pictures, censors look for scenes of sex or
violence to snip rather than
obscene dialogue.

Thus when the Vietnam war epic "The Deer Hunter" was recently shown on
Egypt's national TV, the
picture's steady flow of vulgarities was left intact; only violent scenes
were snipped. The movie's
swearing was either not translated, or else the words were bowdlerized.
"Go f--- yourself!" was
rendered as "you're not nice."

Frost started out in california, as i recall the norton saying before I
dropped it from an 18th storey window into a deep sewage pond. But his poem
"Stopping by Woods" was written to be sung to a melody later used for the
song "Hernando's Hideaway" from the Broadway show "Lost in DB's Memory
Bank." The Latin beat of this tune reveal Frost's true colors. Hope this
clarifies. db.

Thanks for yr posting, Chris. reminds me of the idiom "out of sight, out of

lunatic."

Before I "got" it, I was speculating that the phrase you make yr "subject,"
had originally been "Twilight Pastures", or "Toilet Postures." The latter
sounds more like Fields.

george bowering has kindly backchanneled me (merci pour ca, georges) to
point out a possible ambiguity in my footnote, concerning food and sex. i
was only referring to food, and my comment anticipates a 22-city tour
during which i expect a number of listmembers to be taking me out to
dinner. plans for this are already afoot and should be complete by the next
century. I do look fwd to reading about other people's sexual preferences
(well, except for yours, george) but as for my own, to paraphrase lisa
robertson's terrific poem "The Device" (Hole #6), I choose not to speak
about them. hope this clears matters up before any harm is done. db.

if you put Dreamtime Village on your itinerary I'll cook you some of my
favorite indian dishes, say chicken coconut curry, some onion bread &
some tempura (which I forget the indian name of, maybe pakora) with some
tamarind dipping sauce & even make it without the hot. your reading
would be well attended by chickens, ducks, goats & we might even be able
to stir up a few humans.  if nothing else we could get maria to drive
down from the cities.

Just called up New City.  The reading begins at 8 (doors open 7:30), and
will be $5.  The man I talked to also mentioned that they are trying to
arrange a reading in Vancouver as well but was not sure about it yet.

one of my favorite all time topics was mentioned in passing the other
day but Ive lost the note so I cant quote it.  but it has been the
origin of much whimsy & wonder to me since the very beginning of my
adventures in culturefuck many years ago. simply put, "why is it often
the case that artists & writers who very capably experiment & stretch
boundaries in their chosen idiom often have very mainstream tastes in
other media."  while the current music listening thread is certainly not
indicative of anyone's complete musical diet, I do have the feeling that
there are many here whose taste in dance, music, theatre, 2 & 3
dimensional, installation, performance art & film is not consistent with
their interest for the writers of this list...

one of the funniest examples I can think of is once Lyx & I attended a
performance by George Quasha & Chuck Stein in Milwaukee, I believe put
on by the incredible Woodland Patterns (or were they still called
Boox/Books at this time?)  The boys got up & blew us away with some
sound poetry pieces that were some of the most aural sonics I had heard
at that time.  When they were done some band came on & played Beatles
covers. As I remember we were provoked to a bit of poetic terrorism, but
that's another story.

Aha! I got you here, mikael! It's Woodland Pattern, with no "s". But
seriously, Karl Gartung and Anne Kingsbury's place has been for many
years one of the great venues in the country for new poetry and
music. One of the finest performance series in the country (and if
you write them, they'll send you their beautifully produced
schedules and promo broadsides), and surely one of the finest
collections of small press poetry anywhere. I once lived around the
corner from this magical place--I'm sure Miekal would agree with my
suggestion that anyone within a few hundred miles take a weekend
sometime to visit! I'll post the address tomorrow, or why don't you,
Miekal, if you've got it handy.

Woodland Pattern
720 E. Locust St.
Milwaukee, WI 53212
414-263-5001

Their hours are:
Tuesday - Friday 12-8
Sat/Sun 12-5

Their activities in promoting the experimental arts is unparalleled in
the midwest.  I believe they have been around for 20 years, & when ever
Lyx & I are weary of all the time we donate to Xexoxial or Dreamtime we
think of the unbelievable commitment that Karl & Anne have made to the
midwest cultural scene.  I first became familiar with a lot of the folks
on this list in the early 80s thru bookbuying binges there.  Where else
can you find a first edition Bob Cobbing with the original cover price?

Does anyone know anything about the upcoming AWP convention in Washington
D.C.,  like when exactly it is?  I haven't yet been able to get my hands
on a current AWP newsletter.  I went to the convention two years ago in
Pittsburgh where Gerry Stern and Jack Gilbert read.  This was my
introduction to Gilbert,  who is someone who is greatly underread,  I
think.  Anyway,  I had a good time amid all the hoopla (even machine tool
conventions could be fun,  I think).  Anywhere where there's a lot of
people talking about poetry is bound to be stimulating in some way.

One of those stills is on the cover of _Evergreen Review_ No. 19 (price:
$1).  Issue includes "How to Proceed in the Arts," by Frank O'Hara and
Larry Rivers, with this advice on sexual preferences:

1. Empty yourself of everything.
2. Think of faraway things.
3. It is 12:00. Pick up the adult and throw it out of bed. Work should
be done at your leisure, you know, only when there is nothing else to
do. If anyone is in bed with you, they should be told to leave. You
cannot work with someone there.

Great to see Cesaria Evora's name come up in this context -- I'd suggest
looking into Amandio Cabral also: he'd be hard to escpae in a serious
discussion of Cape Verdean music. Evora's interpreted a number of his
compositions, many of which are of a poetic value equal their musical
achievement. His lp's are hard to come by these days, but a collection has
been released on disc by Lusafrica (a Parisian label that releases mostly
music from Cape Verde, Angola, Senegal, and the environs of Lusophone (sp?)
Africa), distributed by Stern's in New York. Also recommended: Saozinha's
interpretations of Eugenio Tavares' poems, on a Brockton, Mass. label
operated by (and named after) the Mendez Brothers (Ramiro Mendez has
written a number of Evora's pieces and performs on some of her earlier
recordings). Tavares began writing in the late nineteenth century in Cape
Verde, where he also published a journal called "Cartas Caboverdeanas,"
that included various politcal (in addition to poetic) writings. He's
considered a major figure in Cape Verdean letters, devoted unequivocally,
as the liner notes put it, "to the cult of the Portugese language."

Speaking of such things: Jayne Cortez' recent recording with the
Firespitters is out - the poetry is, of course, worth it alone, but there's
an extraordinary cut featuring a Mandingo vocalist and some Mandingo
musicains that's been a soundtack for much of my thought lately...


Best to all,

Yep, there was a rush of poets who were writing lyrics for that song.
Another was A.E. Housman's poem (what was the title?) that includes

Oh I have Been to Ludlow Fair
and left my necktie who knows where

etc

I would like to have it go on record that I have not communicated with
David Bromige about sexual preferences at any time.

Neither have we discussed Michael Hamburger or X.J. Kennedy.

This reminds me of an early poem by Michele Leggott ('Easter Island' I
think), with the topography of the Pacific being translated into the
typography of long, expansive lines. I seem to remember that editors had
great problems with it, either trying to squish it down to 8 points or
setting it sideways in their journals and anthologies. Her first
collection solved the problem by being set in a square format - a
pattern that she has followed in subsequent books. The other NZers on
the list would know Michele better than I, so correct me if I've got it
wrong.

I'm spending more time now thinking about landscape and its effects upon
one's thought processes - including poetry - since I'll soon be moving
back to Wellington after 2 1/2 years in Auckland. Just driving along the
motorways I start to notice the unique features of the place - why has
it never seemed strange to me that I drive through a mangrove swamp to
get to work?

Much of my writing when I lived in Wellington was affected by the
landscape and (particularly) weather, though rarely consciously so. It's
a place that forces one to notice the environment, even for someone like
me who thinks that 'the great outdoors' means 'al fresco'. And working
as a meteorologist has given me a certain mode of attention - weather
imagery is common enough in poetry, I suppose, but in retrospect I was
surprised to see just how much I used.

My childhood landscape, the 'Constable Country' of semi-rural Essex, is
also constantly present within me. The woods, pitiful remnants that they
are, seemed like ancient mystery to a 6-year-old, and were given an
extra edge by parental warnings to avoid the WWII bomb craters that
dotted the forest floor. Perhaps this is one of the reasons that I am so
attracted to Geoffrey Hill's poetry - 'Mercian Hymns' certainly
resonated with that early sense of place.

Well, favourite foods include honeyed olives, Parmiggiano Reggiano,
manuka-smoked salmon with sour cream, rare vensison with blueberry
sauce, and strawberries injected with Cointreau; served with aged
Riesling, Pinot Grigio, Kumeu River Chardonnay, a rich Merlot, and Veuve
Clicquot demi-sec, respectively. But more often than not I settle for a
quarter pounder combo with sprite.

My sexual preference is for (female) Bulgarian poets, which
understandably narrows the range a bit.

Bob Frost was born on the 100 block of Eddy Street, San Francisco, back
when the neighborhood right around there was still called St. Anne's
Valley (named for a small lake that no longer exists right at the
location of the Powell Street Bart Station only around 100 yards
away)--really that whole area of Market Street between 5th & 7th
streets used to be close to a swamp as late as the 1890s. Alice B.
Toklas was born on the 900 block of O'Farrell (uphill side of the
street--I think there's a multilayer parking garage there now), Isadora
Duncan was born at 510 Taylor -- the only building of the three that
still exists (and the only one also that is memorialized with a
placque). The Hotel Wentley at the other end of the neighborhood (and
from another era) is now the Polk-Sutter Apartments.

Here's one for Kevin & Dodie and you other San Francisco buffs, what

Don't know if the gent is married to Erica Hunt. He quotes Lorca on
duende in his liner notes, so does have a sense of poetry... "Emergency
peace" is on New Worlds/Countercurrents (#80409-2); the personnel :
Marty Ehrlich clarinet, bass clarinet, flute, wooden flutes, alto sax;
Abdul Wadud cello; Lindsay horner bass; Muhal Richard Abrams piano on
some of the cuts. -- Pierre

The ongoing discussion about landscape & shape of the poetry etc.  (Frost,
Brathwaite etc. etc.) is the most interesting (to me) in the couple of
weeks I've been around the list.. I'm fascinated that rural & suburban
physical landscapes have been mentioned, more than urban contexts.  I grew
up in about as pretty a rural landscape as I know in the U.S. (Stockbridge
MA, "the Berkshires")--but I feel that my work is more responsive to the
urban surround.  That certainly has something to do with having lived for
half a year in Sau Paulo, 9 years in Boston, six months in Denver--all of
them in rather gritty parts of town.  But more I think with the fact that
social & cultural experience, for me, seem more embedded in
post-industrial urban rust.  The jagged apartness, that I feel in our
culture, which gets involved a lot with the formal choices I make, seems
much like the feel of edgy city jumpiness those places can have.
Word-music derives from social feel.  That's always seemed to me true also
of the US poets I like.

What fascinates me is the way that the kind of urban experience Mark
finds essential to his poetry has only been considered "poetic"
experience since, say, Whitman.  I recall Robert Pinsky giving a talk in
which he said that it took Baudelaire to make the city a subject with
which poets were comfortable -- now many poets seem to turn to
"post-industrial urban rust" as readily as poets turned to (and
sentimentalized) rough rural scenes in the wake of Wordsworth.  What I
wonder is this: who has make our suburbs, in all their atomization and
occasional tackiness, into the dominant landscapes of poetic
imaginations? How have suburban experiences of space shaped poetic
perception?  (I'm jumping into this thread mid-stream, so if this has
been covered, just backchannel me the posts).  As one who just months
ago was uprooted from his beloved Chicago to land (against all my
expectations) in the suburbs, I really do want to know.

This reminds me of an advertising shennanigan that occurred in China a
number of years ago.  Some American company selling some carbonated
beverage (I don't recall whom) advertised their product on billboards with
the slogan "Brings you back to life!"

Punchline is, this slogan was translated as "Brings your relatives back
from the dead!"

That 'edgy city jumpiness' has had an effect upon me, too, in that I
fiddled around for a while with a sequence I called 'Urban Songs'. NZ
has very little urban culture, being enamored (especially in Auckland)
of the suburban 'quarter-acre paradise', and even those of us who love
the city tend to go home our city-fringe villas (Grey Lynn &c) at night,
leaving the downtown streets to the street-sweeping trucks and a handful
of investors in apartments. Any rust is swept away into industrial
'parks' - there's very little real 'grittiness' to our central cities (K
road being about the only exception).

There is an urban feeling, but it seems to me only secondarily a
physical landscape, and primarily a mental, electronic and semiotic one.
We move into physical proximity, informational convenience and emotional
distance with our fellow city-dwellers, and it's that combination of
jumbled coexistence, rhizomatic linkage and 'jagged apartness' that
seems to me an interesting (and even necessary?) source of formal
choices for writing.

There's a strong movement in Wellington (mostly from Lower Hutt) to
rehabilitate the suburbs as a site for poetry. They're reacting to
Baxter's anti-suburban stance, and are trying to show that the suburbs
aren't entirely dull and soulless - unfortunately, much of their poetry
is exactly that.

I did make a conscious effort to avoid both Baxter's and the suburban
poets' projects. Leigh Davis is about the only local poet I can think of
who has written not so much 'about' as from the post-industrial city in
an even-handed and open manner (unlike David Eggleton's wearying rants).
I am ambivalent about the city (generic) - more so than when I started
writing the sequence - but I have to acknowledge that feelings of
exhileration and soaring ambition go along with alienation and
dislocation. The city is: a basement shop selling tapa cloths and web
browsing; a rave in an art gallery; a motorway through mangroves; taking
up coffee because hot chocolate isn't hip enough; exchanging URLs with
strangers; and passionate discussions about which is the best carpark in
town. Sometimes it hurts like hell, but I'd never live further than
walking distance from the centre.

"urban experience" has been a part of poetry back way farther than
whitman!  think of swift's "london," for example, or jane taylor's
"A Pair" compairing a spoiled british lordling with a painfully poor
mechanic in the city (~1801) or mary robinson's "City Scene" (both
swift and robinson's poems, by the way, were quick pastiches of images,
and, i believe, both were unrhymed).  the restoration poets, at least
r.h. lovelace and the earl of rochester, both had bleak london/city
poems.  and chaucer had some fine descriptions of london of his day
in _Canterbury Tales_.

most of these poems had a jagged, bleak feel, especially the robinson
and the swift.

and defoe's _Journal of the Plague Year_ in prose, as well as mary
shelley's _The Last Man_, include apocolyptic (sp?) descriptions of
cities -- living, despoiled, dying in the exudations of their own
waste...

good heavens, why this singular fixation on Whitman?  now that i think
on it, carl sandburg went on at great length about Chicago (though i'm
not sure if he did so before whitman) and certainly edward arlington
robinson's tillbury town, and master's spoon river anthology series get
in their swipes at ragged dry industrial landscapes...

i am wearing not black, which is unusual, but a sort of slatey blue pair

Two Very Academic Theses of My Own Devising

to be nailed to the doors of the nearest cathedral or writing program:

Thesis One:

 To sentimentalize the city and to denigrate suburbia and aesthetics
conditioned by suburban experience is, in a time of migration to the
suburbs, inherently a conservative position.  It is analagous to the
sentimentalizing or aestheticizing of rural landscapes in Romantic
poetry, with its accompanying denigration (as spititually bankrupt) of
the cities to which so many people were migrating.  In short, the
aestheticizing of the city represents a failure to encompass new
landscapes and new experiences.


Thesis Two:

 To aestheticize or sentimentalize suburban experience and to denegrate
by implication the potential to make art out of urban experience is to
make an art complicit with the dominant economic forces that have
created those suburbs.  To make an art that insists on, or relies on,
the diversity and richness of urban experience is to resist, in the
realm of representation, these forces.

Assignment:

Believe both of the above.  Or write a 1000 word essay pointing out the
internal contradictions and blindspots of either thesis.

An accompanying set of study questions, and an annotated instructor's
edition, are available for $49.95.

isn't this a beauty....

A Pair  by JANE TAYLOR  (1806)

II.

Down a close street, whose darksome shops display
Old clothes and iron on both sides the way;
Loathsome and wretched, whence the eye in pain,
Averted turns, nor seeks to view again;
Where lowest dregs of human nature dwell,
More loathsome than the rags and rust they sell; --
A pale mechanic rents an attic floor,
By many a shatter'd stair you gain the door:
'Tis one poor room, whose blacken'd walls are hung
With dust that settled there when he was young.
The rusty grate two massy bricks displays,
To fill the sides and make a frugal blaze.
The door hanging, the window patch'd and broke,
The panes obscur'd by half a century's smoke:
There stands the bench at which his life si spent,
Worn, groov'd, and bor'd, and worm-devour'd, and bent,
Where daily, undisturb'd by foes or friends,
In one unvaried attitude he bends.
His tools, long practis'd, seem to understand
Scarce less their functions, than his own right hand.
With these he drives his craft with patient skill;
Year after year would find him at it still:
The noisy world around is changing all,
War follows peace, and kingdoms rise and fall;
France rages now, and Spain, and now the Turk;
Now victory sounds; -- but there he sits at work!
A man might see him so, then bid adieu, --
Make a long voyage to China or Peru;
There traffic, settle, build; at length might come,
Alter'd, and old, and weather-beaten home,
And find him on the same square foot of floor
On which he left him twenty years before.
--The self same bench, and attitude, and stool,
The same quick movement of his cunning tool;
The very distance 'twixt his knees and chin,
As though he had but stepp'd just out and in.

Such is his fate -- and yet you might descry
A latent spark of meaning in his eye.
--That crowded shelf, beside his bench, contains
One old, worn, volume that employs his brains:
With algebraic lore its page is spread,
Where _a_ and _b_ contend with _x_ and _z_:
Sold by some _student_ from a Oxford hall,
--Bought by the pound upon a broker's stall.
On this it is his sole delight to pore,
Early and late, when working time is o'er:
But oft he stops, bewilder'd and perplex'd,
At some hard problem in the learned text;
Pressing his hand upon his puzzled brain,
At what the dullest school-boy could explain.

From needful sleep the precious hour he saves,
To give his thirsty mind the stream it craves:
There, with his slender rush beside him plac'd,
He drinks the knowledge in with greedy haste.
At early morning, when the frosty air
Brightens Orion and the northern Bear,
His distant window mid the dusky row,
Holds a dim light to passenger below.
--A light more dim is flashing on his mind,
That shows its darkness, and its views confin'd.
Had science shone around his early days,
How had his sould expanded in the blaze!
But penury bound him, and his mind in vain
Struggles and writhes beneath her iron chain.

--At length the taper fades, and distant cry
Of early sweep bespeaks the morning nigh;
Slowly it breaks, -- and that rejoicing ray
That wakes the healthful country into day,s
Tips the green hills, slants o'er the level plain,
Reddens the pool, and stream, and cottage pane,
And field, and garden, park, and stately hall,--
Now darts obliquely on his wretched wall.
He knows the wonted signal; shuts his book,
Slowly consigns it to its dusty nook;
Looks out awhile, with fixt and absent stare,
On crowded roofs, seen through the foggy air;
Stirs up the embers, takes his sickly draught,
Sighs at his fortunes, and resumes his craft.

Samuel Johnson, Blake, Dryden, Pope, Marvell in the satires. Not all of
Rochester's city poems are bleak, but those that aren't are pornographic;
Dryden is more celebratory than bleak except when he's writing political
satire.
Swift wrote city poems in rhyme, as well.
Aren't there latin city poems?

rural environment of Screamtime Village and ease the traffic flow (suburban,

I think middle-class suburbia has lots of poets, but probably few of us on
the list read them. They fill the establishment journals.

There is another kind of suburbia, and it's everywhere. There's Berkeley,
but there's also Richmond (is Oakland still a suburb), and there's
Scarsdale, but there's also Perth Amboy. I may be the only poet who's
written about Perth Amboy.

All the postings since mine, about city & suburbia, were really
interesting & sharp.  But they mostly seem to be talking about descriptive
content...subject matter.  There's a mention of "sentimentalizing the city
and denigrating suburbia"...which sort of sounds like it must refer to my
posting.  What my posting tried to address 1. is mostly not a careful
"choice" of "subject matter;" but about how poets (including myself) come
to be influenced by their socio-experiencial context; 2. is a matter of
FORM not primarily subject matter....

Other folks are saying really interesting things, but they seem to think
they are addressing my post, & I don't see it that way.  Remember I was
responding to the Brathwaite comment about how the shape of a landscape
might affect the SHAPE of a poet's work..I sort of assume that "shape"
here is not something that is synonymous with paraphraseable descriptive
subject-matter (necessarily)

The final word on what I MEANT to say (I know I wasn't clear enuff) might
be to mention two very different poets who I think of as paradigmatic of
the sort of "city poetry" I meant to identify myself with.  I think they
write out of a late 20th century feel of how consciousness is molded by
the urban matrix of social being (which doesn't mean they "talk about"
cities):    Ron Silliman and Clark Coolidge

i remember seeing mason williams on the smothers brothers show, playing his
piece "classical jazz."  also he made some rapidfire collages of political stuff
that they showed on the show, which, suburbanite that i am and was, were amazing
to me, and i think pretty daring for 60s mainstream tv.  i remember him reciting
some of his poetry, but i don't remember the poetry per se.  whatever happened
to him?

that's sort of the way POETIX works --many threads come into being tangentially
and take on a substance and trajectory of their own.  that's part of the
non-linear, pleasantly desultory nature of these discussions, some of which will
appear focused, some diffuse and digressive. welcome

Sorry.  Should have said it was Whitman (and others in the mid 19C) who
made a _celbratory_ poetry about urban experience.  Which seems to be
something you agree with.  One could find exceptions.

Thanks for that thoughtful post...
I don't think my work tends to be as immediately responsive to where I am
as that...

Oddly enough, I just picked up (2 hours before your post??) Elemenopy; &
have started reading it for the first time--I love it.  A certain range
between more placid & more "jangley" there, too, I feel.

Not surprisingly, I seem to like best things that jangle..

etc"

one thing i have noticed over the years, in which i have lived mostly in
new york city though having been reared in a very small town in the
adirondacks, might have less to do with landscape than the way
particular landscapes are peopled. For example, in a new book  of
poems i have coming from Coffee House Press, I found that it was
structured as an opposition between a kind of text that was generated
from a city experience and another that was generated  by a revisiting
(and remembering) a rural community; and the differences in the style
and form and tone were quite distinct. The "city poems," if you will, have
a nervous and discontinuous flux, with a kind of energy seeking some
isometry, some stabilty, but constantly foiled; whereas the upstate, North
Country poems have a more  meditative, observant mood, in which the
poems find certain connections, discover them at times, by accident.

This was a source of amazement to me as i put the book together. It was
not premeditated, since I simply began by going through compositions of
the last two years and found these jangly, impersonal, somewhat
abstracted poems written here in New York City and these more pastoral
ones and personal ones written while visiting my mother and old friends
up in the mountains.

It is borne out, however, by my experiences with those places, and I
think a small-town community carries within it kinds of relations that a city
environment does not. These kinds of relations between people, where
everyone either knows everyone or knows someone who was related
to someone  tends to enforce (sometimes not successfully, sure) a
civility that is not found so often in a city, where the folks one deals with
day to day live in a kind of anonymity from one another and from you.
 As an example, two, really: when my father passed away, in the town
he grew up in, i took my mother around to the various places one has to
go to in the aftermath of a death: the knights of columbus, where he had
a life insurance policy; the motor vehicle bureau, to amend car deeds, the
social security office, etc. Every person my mother, in her grief, had to
deal with either knew her or my father or was a friend of mine, and
pleasantries were inevitably exchanged and the otherwise difficult
process of  taking care of such details was made warm and human. I
can only imagine how such a trek from place to place would go in new
york city, with total strangers.


  And secondly, once when i was visiting upstate, I read in the local
paper how a teenage boy driving a truck was drunk and  ran through a
flashing red light at a rural intersection at about six in the morning,
speeding home after a night of drink, only to be blindsided by another
truck, driven by his uncle. The boy died. It just shows you how even
random accidents are likely to involve someone you know.

I think the consequences of these differences are very pronounced
when it comes to narrative styles, or should be, but it certainly, for me,
extends to poetry as well.

This is surely why I got away from the small town life and why I will
probably return.

And he says them back to me,

eyes big, his tongue clumsy and sweet,
saying the names of towns of my youth.

I?m far from them now,
these syllables holding mysteries
of places people came to,
of how things were then.

I knew my own, Saranac,
without curiosity.
It was like my name.
But Cadyville was where the girls lived,

Schuyler Falls a forest cleared for playing ball,
Dannemora a prison town with tall, tough Irish,
Chazy just a cold, cold lake.

The places are on a map
I never need to study,
just hamlets to drive through.
The people that built them,

the sites there, now gone,
yielded to spells of indifferent offspring,
to places fallen down.
Still, Beekmantown

in my boy?s mouth
is a clear parcel of fields
farmed for stone and apples,
Redford the soft fold of our church.

He repeats them to me
as I ask, happy at the drill,
expecting something for his effort.
I give him my confused joy.

I say to him ?paradise,?
and hear the pure word.

Let me suggest that those of us raised in cities sometimes write thoughtful,
quiet, nostalgic poems about the old neighborhood. I even have one with my
kid as recipient of lore. He grew up in the city, but it was a different
neighborhood--and my old neighborhood was a different neighborhood, too.
And sometimes us homeboys also write poems jumpy with discovery about rural
places.

It may be the condition of the poet's life as well as some inherent geist
that informs the rhythm of the poems.

The bio. I'm currently reading is Jervis Anderson's _A. Philip Randolph:
A Biographical Portrait_, now much dated (Randolph was still alive when
Anderson wrote it) --

My particular interest at this point has been Randolph's contacts, mostly
via _The Messenger_, with writers such as George Schuyler, Wallace
Thruman, Theophilus Lewis etc. -- Philip's mag. was an integral part of
the Harlem Renaissance publishing explosion, but, of course, took quite a
different position from Du Bois's _Crisis_ or _Opportunity_ over at the
Urban League -- also reading this for my other projects -- tracking
history of "Left" writing by African-Americans for context in my work on
C.L.R. James in America --

Anderson's book is really informative, but I know a lot more info has
been developed since '73, when he published it --
One of the early contributing editors was Ernest Rice McKinney, with whom
James had many battles in the next decade inside the American Trotskyite
movement --

After Claude McKay's "If We Must Die" appeared in Max Eastman's
_Liberator_, it was immediately reprinted uptown in Randolph's
_Messenger_ as well as in Cyril Briggs's yet more radical _Crusader_ --


anybody know of a more recent bio.?

When we're talking about landscape & poetry aren't we really talking about
"the dialectics of inside/outside," as Bachelard put it? With the poem as
the form of mediation between these two? Seems to me "landscape" is simply a
figure of speech designating the way we perceive/appropriate experience.

Is this what you were getting at, Mark Presjnar (sic)?

Let me suggest that those of us raised in cities sometimes write thoughtful,
quiet, nostalgic poems about the old neighborhood. I even have one with my
kid as recipient of lore. He grew up in the city, but it was a different
neighborhood--and my old neighborhood was a different neighborhood, too.
And sometimes us homeboys also write poems jumpy with discovery about rural
places.

It may be the condition of the poet's life as well as some inherent geist
that informs the rhythm of the poems.

Thanks Michael Coffey for city/country messages.  Here's a poem about
being in a small town (Norwich, CT - by the "Thames"), & going to a big
town (London, by the "Thames"), and size not making any difference - because
we inhabit "la citta qui Cristo e Romano" (or however it goes).

28
                 _near Norwich, by the Thames_

Trees merge with the darkness      coral, camouflaged
above the river,      quiet, smooth and ceaseless.
Hidden by nightfall,      stars, arranged
in the heavens,      drift      reflected there.

You tugged your sweater close around your dress
& let me wrap an arm across your shoulder as
the last of summer pulled us both downstream,
so adamant, so casual, unvarying, and calm.

Those fingers lifted to my shivering lips
were hidden in the darkness too      & now
my heartbeat mimics you
& stained with all this darkness, steps
toward some anonymous London afterlife,
incognito (the ache      of universal grief).

In 1994 I lived in a suburb of Boulder, Colorado called Gunbarrel.
Having been raised in the suburbs of Los Angeles and finding myself once
again in a suburban territory, I consciously attempted to devise an
aesthetic that could articulate my experience of this post-industrial
suburban landscape.  The experience taught me a lot about expression and
the context of artistic production.  The project- "Deaf Child Area"
ended up incorporating found paper into the text - the handmade books
were literally photocopied on top of paper and plastic I found in the
dumpsters of local greeting card factories, software firms, etc.

In terms of these two theses, I don't understand what is meant by
"aestheticize"- it implies some kind of reduction, along with the
denegration.  Both theses rely on negating, exclusive impulses.  I look
at Reznikoff's urban descriptions and find only opening to all kinds of
perception, no dismissal.  Perhaps the most interesting discovery in
burrowing through exurban/suburban material for me is that these
economic forces aren't dominant, are unstable, mulitudinous
economic/aesthetic scenarios.  I just had to look a little harder, at 3
AM in Safeway, Burger King at closing time, the empty parking lot at
dusk with the sound of bagpipes, the toxic joys of day old pastries and
Pespi.

I never knew where it was from 'til now, but this line shows up in the song
"Come Alive" (1981) by the excellent British group Magazine:

"An asteroid kicked up the dust the dinosaur stubbornly bit
Man's brain was taken, the cortex stuck at an awkward angle on it
His first words were:
'What have I done to deserve the sun?
What have I done to deserve the rain?'
Pepsi-Cola, Pepsi-Cola brings your ancestors back from the grave"

Which also tells us which company it was.  Magazine's Howard Devoto (who was
also in the Buzzcocks early on) is, by the way, one of the 'rock' lyricists
whose work repays attention.  Nick Currie (a.k.a. Momus), John Davis, and
The Silver Jews' David Berman also pop to mind, in addition to some folks
that have been mentioned on this list previously.

UNRELATED MATTER:

Is there any chance that more list-members could make an effort not to quote
-all- of a long message that they're responding to, for the sake of those of
us who receive it in digest form.  Just repeat enough for context, maybe?
(Though of course we know that meanings accrete with each iteration.)

Do any of you know whether Rez's Holocaust is still in print? I know,
I could look in Books in Print, but then, I'd have to wonder over to
the library, and then I'd have to lift my fingers to turn the pages,
not to mention that I'd have to actually pull BIP out of the
shelves...

I remember well meeting Marty at Susan's opening last saturday after my
reading at the Ear, and seeing Erica too -- for the first time in 5 or more
years.

N'yorkers should get to Granary Books at 568 Broadway across the street
from the downtown Duddenheim museum -- Susan's book is wonderful.

>In response to Mark Weiss's (sorry, I've lost his text with the Digest
entry): First off, had it been an isolated conversation with Brathwaite I'd
take it as casual or believe I remembered it wrong, but it was fairly
elaborated, and I had several conversations with him about this.  Secondly,
the "shape" of a poem was not limited to line-lengths.  I understood this to
mean in part his video-style (islands of fonts), clearly, but also ideas
about a mix of voices and the very structures of what he terms his "nation
language."  And the idea was not limited to the idea of the archipelago in
his understanding of Caribbean poetry, but also to the immediate landscape
of individual islands, its "development," the relationship to ocean/sky,
etc.  I would be reluctant to fault the idea for its associative rather than
logical links, and thought it might be an interesting counterpart to John
Kinsella's wholly different thinking on the "pastoral."

William Northcutt, I tried replying to your question yesterday, but
the post seems to have been swallowed in e-space or otherwise
bushwhacked.

Anyway, yes, there was a somewhat contentious discussion of Dorn on
this list in Decmeber 1995. It was initiated by Ron Silliman's
comments and went on for a couple of weeks.

*Lots* of messages on this listserv are created with the "Reply" function
of a piece of mail software. Result often is copying into one's message the
message to which one is replying. This can mean multiple copies of
sometimes very long posts are are in the mail received from the listserv
daily. IMHO this clogs the pipes, both digitally and mentally

Sometimes I guess it's helpful to have the stimulus with the response --
though the message title can fulfil that function most of the time.
Certainly it's sometimes useful to quote *a part* of the message --
specifically that to which one is replying. Most of the time what I see is
someone wants to add an opinion, and to it is appended a long post,
sometimes more than one, as this can easily nest multiple messages and
replies. Actually makes it hard to focus on the new stuff.

Something to think about in creating your posts to Poetics.

That's an interesting take on the non-downtown in Auckland & whatever
happens in Wellington (I'd expect long if loopy lines, since everyone there
musthave huge breath capacity from climbing hills all the time). But you
mention Leigh Davis as if he were still writing. Is this so? Has he done
anything lately? I never saw that first book, only stuff in anthologies & a
mag or two, but he was really doing something different there.

Nice twists & turns in your own.

MIME-version: 1.0
Content-type: TEXT/PLAIN; CHARSET=US-ASCII

The idea of "urban" poetry comes in part from the Humanist importation of
classical and continental ideas about the city.  In 1500 or so, London was
just a large village as far as natives and foreigners were concerned.
Sir Th More's Utopia introduces the concept of the metropolis in about 1518 (?)
but the influence on poetry is not felt till Jonson and Donne.  They are
the most experimental and consequential of poets of their generation: they
both were London-born-and-bred, and came from the lowest merchant classes.
Part of what makes their city-poems interesting to me is the way in which
they localize (not yet nationalize) generic approaches to the city-subjects,
languages, environments: they imitate Martial and Juvenal and Catullus, so
that they can talk about Fleet River and street-life in the official
verse-forms of the satire and epigram.  Jonson writes the first memorable poem
in English on a sewer, his grotesque and hilarious poem "On the Famous Voyage"
about two guys who on a lark row up a polluted waterway.  At around 1600,
city poetry was trying to appropriate indigenous folk discourses about the
place London (especially ballads and verse narratives) and trump them with
the authority of classical forms specifically dedicated to urban space.
By 1700, London is clearly the metropolis that urbanites of the previous
two centuries were trying to imagine, and in fact is well on its way to
becoming the planet's largest city, an unprecedented development.  City poetry
becomes more and more constructed with the topographic techniques of "rural"
genres such as the georgic: hence Swift's descriptions and more importantly
John Gay's "Trivia: the Art of Walking the Streets of London."  Although
Raymond Williams ground-breaking book has much to say about urban poetry,
he does not give enough attention to the importance of satire and epigram,
and ultimately, privileges pastoralism and its ideologies in his account of
how English poets built their poetic cities.  As some posting have suggested,
that strand of urban poetry uses an ocular-meditational rhetoric, but the
earlier and perhaps more interesting (to me) strand begins with a bodily-
kinetic-experiential rhetoric which of course is in play in the work of
O'Hara, Olson, et al, but goes way back to Donne and Jonson.  Hope this
hasn't been too pedantic...

Actually I agree with Mark Weiss--yet another instance of me not conveying
what I wanted to say!  Yes, I never intended to suggest some kind of
poetic determinism.  I definitely write the way I do because I choose
to....I happen to associate it, in my own mind, with conditions I would
call those of the dissociated late capitalist city...But determinism, no,
that very definitely is not going on, for any of us.  If I thought it was
all determined for me before I went thru any work & development, I'd
hardly want to bother...

Yes, I think that's a very good point...Still, it has to do in part with
something more involved than inside/outside; but I see your point, and
that's one component of the range of frames that we're talking about, I
think...

As I hoped to convey with the examples of Silliman & Coolidge, what I have
in mind is something about the lived quality of a contemporary form of
experience, made up of a number of different "structures of feeling"; and
how that can be explored thru different approaches to FORM.

with all that talk of miller williams and the commissioning of someone to
write/read a poem i thought i'd relay a strange request that came my
way.my mum has been attending a fitness class three times a week for four
or five years -Cathie's Fitness Class. I have no idea what they do but
i know they have fun and have become quite a tight group. now, Cathie has
got a job in the suit'n'tie world and today was her last class.  My mum
asked me to write a poem for Cathie as kind of a thanks. i have never met
her or experienced any kind of aerobic(sp?) work-out. so i did my best to
come up with something that would please a group of non-poetry types and
not embarrass me ma. it was tough. took me a few hours. complete with
rime. (you try pharmacist!)

any other similar anecdotes?

It seems clear to me that the "apples & oranges" thread is
struggling to resolve, by way of "landscape," the recent "fave foods"
riffing with our on-going devotion to "poetics."  I had myself been
groping in vain toward such a rapprochement when I remembered Zukofsky's
famous determination to "make a calzone out of economics" and all made
sense...

Chax will have a small pamphlet there of a poem by Perelman, The Masque of
Rhyme, which combines desktop publishing with certain elements of fine
bookmaking. Available for $4 plus two stamps (or cash equivalent) to anyone
on Poetics List, or, for that matter, anyone at all. Please just send the
payment and I'll try to get you a copy by return mail, after next Tuesday,
when the author will have a chance to sign copies.
Send payment to Chax Press at 101 W. Sixth St., no. 6, Tucson, Arizona
85701-1000. Call 520-620-1626 for information or email me. This is the first
event Chax Press is co-sponsoring since our move back to Tucson this fall,
and it definitely feels good.

Next up for events co-sponsored by Chax & POG (POG is a recently-formed
group of writers & others interested in poetry, poetics, and other artistic
practices) will be a mid-April reading & talk by Karen Mac Cormack and Steve
McCaffery. The dates & time are not set for that yet.

At that time Chax will also be releasing a new book by Karen Mac Cormack,
titled The Tongue Moves Talk. Please inquire if you wish to order this book.

I'd love you all to  look at my website

http://www.well.com/user/lapalma

it has some poems & several poem-essays ("poesaggi"), including a piece
called "the home page as literary form".

It's what I did in 1995 after my last "traditional" (paper) book,
Persistence" seemed to be widely ignored.

my keyboard is dying  as i type this. I may be offline for a few days.

If you do come, make sure you come for one of our monthly full moon
drifts (read deriv�) thru the uninterrupted unglaciated topography &

recently saw Michael Ondaatje do a reading here in DC.  He talked a bit
about bp Nichol and read a poem for him etc.  While looking in the card
catalog at the Library of Congress, I noticed that bp has a Billy the
Kid book with a title very similar to Ondaatje's Billy the Kid book.  I
tried to fetch it, but someone has it checked out.

Can anyone fill me in on the deal here?  Are they similar works?

bests,
Graham

I know. It goes, in part:

Oh, Terrence, this is stupid stuff
It's time we laid off all that guff
And carry halfway home or near
Pints and quarts of Ludlow beer
My little horse must think I'm queer
To stop without a farmhouse neer
My horse is lovely, dark and deep
But I have miles to go before I sleep

George--

you wouldn't want to trade tapes, would you?  I may not have too much that's
interesting to offer, but if you're interested or willing we could poke
around and probably find SOMETHING (I have only a dozen or so jazz CDs; a
whole lot of albums that generally sound shitty, but there are exceptions;
and a lot of tapes made from CDs that would probably copy pretty well [am
Dolby C but not Dolby S capable]).  anyway, I don't think I'm likely to
encounter or pop for the Dutch import, unless it turns up via Jazz Heritage
Society, but it sounds VERY nice.

best,

Tenney

Maria,

Yes, and if anyone wanted to start a back- (or front-) channel discussion
group on the Baudelaire or some of Benjamin's other essays I'd love
to participate, having been obsessed for some years now with his
. . . knotted . . . brilliance as a way out of false dichotomies
(including, certainly, those that circulate on this list).

For example, his short essay on mimesis would be valuable for whoever it
was that asked about that a few days back (sorry, too lazy to check).

Sure is easy to realize how addicted I am to this list already, when I
had to go 36 hours without david b's witticisms, george b's color
commentary & all the serious chunks between.  I was beginning to think
you folks kicked me off for sumptin I said.

miekal who agrees that the excessive quoting is unnecessary for anyone
whose actually paying attention to what is being said.

& if any of you are interested in the hypermedia apprenticeship at
dreamtime get ahold of me in the sooner, because replies are starting to
come in & we probably can only take on 2 or 3...

Industrial suburb, working-class, gritty. Apollinaire's "zone." The kind we

No, not one bit similar. bp's is a short series of prose bursts about Billy.
Very irrevent, very poetic. Check it out. It's in another book of his
selected prose works, but I don't have my books with me now to give me the
reference. Anyone else?

There is Jack Spicer's Billy the Kid, an intricate performance full of
adroit misdirection and missing erections:

Billy the Kid in a field of poplars with just one touch of moonlight
His shadow is carefully
              distinguished from all their shadows
Delicate
         as perception is
No one will get his gun or obliterate
Their shadows

Hi everyone, it's Kevin Killian.  I hope you'll all buy a copy of my new
book, "Little Men" (Hard Press).  It's terrific.  It costs $12.95 (US).

Carla Harryman wrote, "Like cut diamonds reflecting back their own breaking
points these tales speak the impossible as if the impossible itself could
be bought and sold as jewelry.  The palpability of Kevin Killian's
storytelling is perfect even if, as we bask in the paradoxical charisma of
it, the good guys have gone and stolen the jewelry for no reason...All this
pleasure of affront may be due to Killian's finessing of moiddle brow
culture unbto one of those secret toxic dumps, leaving us with a brilliant
and frightening phenomenonology of what's left."

I find this comment very wise and true.

Here's another wise one, from Robert Gluck:

"Kevin Killian writes like a bent angel who wants to inflict pleasure and
delectation.  His confections dissolve into sensation on the tongue.
Pleasure and safety are opposites, and these jumpy stories turn on the
moment when our hero sees the broader perspective--of someone who wants to
damage him.  Like Nabokov, Killian 'does' our culture in great writing,
with delicious style, generous and wicked.  His sheer conversance with all
departments of our civilization, and with the shapes a sentence and a story
can take, amount to a kind of performance art of its own."

Well, what do you know!  Anyhow as you have guessed, "Little Men" is a book
of stories.  Here's what they're about:

Kevin Killian, the author of "Shy" and "Bedrooms Have Windows," is injected
with sodium pentathol and forced to reveal his most intimate secrets to a
skeptical audience.  In Los Angeles, the ghost of Natalie Wood appears to a
dying fan.  An Irish transvestite hires a bellhop for a marriage of
convenience.  In San Francisco a drunken father (Kevin Killian) takes his
Gen X son (Josh Cherin) to the premiere of "Jurassic Park."  On Long Island
a group of Franciscan brothers stage a beauty contest for incoming
freshmen--the judgment of Paris.  In Steinbeck country an autograph dealer
forges mementos of Audrey Hepburn while seducing a muscle-bound ex-con in
orange undershorts.  On Halloween the boys from Hitchcock's "Rope" throw
their own party in the haunted house of Usher.  To steal the love of his
sister's scientist husband, a San Francisco weakling turns to steroids.  In
60's Manchester, David Smith falls under the spell of a strange married
couple, who read him Sade, and make him murder the one boy who really loves
him . . .

I have more to say about this too, but let's wait til after you've read the
book.  Thanks everyone!

i grew up a mile from downtown pittsburgh, a mile from the university &
museum district, so i know urban: itis myorganic energy . even when writing
about wilderness or old growth i feel the urban charge of my raising.
and living these last 17 years on what used to be the edge of portland, long
an urban-rural edge ghetto (one of the highest percentage of corrections
systems veterans in portland) the setting provides me occasional poems
directly but always that urban awareness--encroaching ppopulation, mix of
d/m-iscommunication.
i think a develpment in current poetry is more of a mix of l=a=n=guage
poetry energies with the urban, to some extent a circle around to the
energies of new york school which, in my own woapred way, i see as a
tangential progenitor (ticularly ashberry) of l=a=n=guage poetry

"anyone know how to get into the greeting cards business?" Yes. I had a
poetry-writing student who did this. The idea came to him in class one
evening.There was a silence after he had read aloud his new poem, and then
one of the other students sd,"You know, so-&-so, you should write for
Hallmark." He sd, "Do you think I could?" A month or so later, he came up
to me: "Congratulate me, I've got a job writing for Hallmark!" Apparently,
at his classmate's suggestion, he had contacted them, sent them samples of
his work, and had been engaged on some kind of freelance cottage-industry
basis. sorry i cant tell you what the pay was. But the gap between poetry
and greeting-cards writing is not necessarily unbridgeable, and we can all
take heart from this example. db

They are not really similar, but those 2 poets were the same age and great
friends, and shared the Governor-General's award in poetry, for, I think,
1970. beep's book was included with a couple others of his because they
were so short. His title was "The True Eventual Story of Billy the Kid" if
I recall rightly. You will probably hear from Doug Barbour on this with
greater accuracy.

Seems to me that one great poem that agonizes a lot about the shift from
pastoral America to the city is Crane's "The Bridge." It's the poem that
when I was 18 made me scurry back there and read Whitman, then scurry up
here and read "Paterson".

Yeah, Bromige. I remember the night you were wearing a sonnet at the

12:59, 1:05, and 1:13; three more pit & prune-juice communiques from our
man in vancouver to console us for being condemned to peer into the
post-midnight dark. Already with thee, GB! If only! Put that tome upon the
table. . . bring that bottle over here. . .

The allusion to _Tender Is the Night_ leads to Gatsby, and I wonder if
listmembers often surmise from what manner of place GB emits? For I can
tell them, a mansion like that of Jay G--a dwelling where room opens into
room upon room in opulent geometries of being. A grand piano graces the
drawingroom, but the master of the house is more likely to be found at one
of his two state-of-the-art computers, unless in the den fretting over some
sporting event on the 26 inch screen. His pair of massive dogs--which GB
calls 'Great Dames'--loll in the hallway, an area big enough to park a Mack
Truck, dotted with statuary and suits of medieval armor. Up the grand
staircase to the many sleeping quarters, one relishes the paintings by
Canadian masters of the brush. Finally, the second storey is gained. One of
these rooms contains three chests of drawer, or chest of drawers, or maybe
chests of drawers, each one stuffed with unworn Hawaiian shirts, the kind
with wooden buttons.  Insert another coin and the tour will continue,
beginning with that portion of the upstairs, a suite of rooms, set aside
for my exclusive use when in Vancouver, with everything untouched--just the
way I left it on my mad dash to the airport, except for the stonewashed
(stonedwash?) jeans, now flapping around the limbs of the owner of the
Manse,--and the Old Haberdashers' necktie, a tie as long as its name, to
match his torso. And next to it, the Down Under Suite, where . . . but
first please insert your coin.

Yes we can, so why not a line of po-mo greeting cards?  Poetry for the
masses, royalties for poets.  Here's a template (Niedecker for Xmas):

bp's little pamphlet, which was one of four that won him the Governor
general's Award back in 1980, is titled _The True Eventual Story of Billy
the Kid_. Its most recent appearance is in _An H in the Heart: bpNichol A
Reader_ edited by our own George Bowering & Michael Ondaatje (Toronto:
McClelland & Stewart, 1994); it also appeared in _CraftSlices_. As Charles
Alexander says, it is verydifferent, a kind of Steinian low-life take on
the pop-mythology,

It has been compared to Ondaatje's book, in Stephen Scobie's "Two Authors
in Search of a Character" (_Canadian Literature_, 54 [Autumn 1972]; _Poets
and Critics_ ed. George Woodcock [Toronto: Oxford UP 1974]; _Spider Blues_,

An oddball crew of sleepy heads
for you to keep in line.

You make us sweat and groan and fight
for inches off our hips.
From every cake and sweet delight
that's left sugar on our lips.

We know we'll never have buns of steel
or tummys flat as glass.
But thanks to you, we enjoy each meal
then lose calories in your class.

May you meet, in this new job
a charming pharmacist.
A fitness buff, who's name is Bob
with a smile you can't resist.

So Cathie, it has been the best
while working out with you.
We have confidence in your success
in every thing you'll do!

was tuned to America's Back Forty listening to the same songs as David --

Witz has always featured a "Publications Received" section, but because
of space limitations it has never contained as much information as I'd
like.  After Charles Bernstein's call for postings of publication
announcements on the Poetics List, I thought I'd take the opportunity to

David,

The late Darrell Gray got a job with Hallmark right after his
graduation from Iowa City and, as I recall, did not care for the
conditions of his employment much.

I can imagine a line of greeting card valentines with texts from
Zukofsky. But then I can also imagine a second line, more acerbic, with
texts from Jack Spicer.

>"anyone know how to get into the greeting cards business?" Yes. I had
a poetry-writing student who did this. The idea came to him in class
one evening.There was a silence after he had read aloud his new poem,
and then one of the other students sd,"You know, so-&-so, you should
write for Hallmark." He sd, "Do you think I could?" A month or so
later, he came up to me: "Congratulate me, I've got a job writing for
Hallmark!" Apparently, at his classmate's suggestion, he had contacted
them, sent them samples of his work, and had been engaged on some kind
of freelance cottage-industry basis. sorry i cant tell you what the pay
was. But the gap between poetry and greeting-cards writing is not
necessarily unbridgeable, and we can all take heart from this example.

Ron will apparently tease us with these disappearing chiffon scarves of
his unexpectedly Victorian imagination, while being unwilling to truly
carry the banner on.  How disappointing!  I've shredded my prototypes.

As to why I'm awake at this hour, db: it must be the repeating nightmare
in which I'm wandering in Bowering Manor, bumping into statuary and
suits of armor.  There's a low growling, as though some sort of wild
beeste were holed up in the Down Under Suite.  I walk toward the sound,
turn the knob, and...wake up abruptly, with an eerie little voice saying
"Please insert your coin."?!

forget all those big-money tv ads during the superbowl,
one of the great advertisements happened on the radio.
it was an ad for budweiser and it asked the commentators
from the fox superbowl coverage, ronnie lott and howie
long, what was the most important thing they'd be
doing in relation to the superbowl. and both of the men
agreed that the most important thing was getting people
to buy 6-packs of budweiser before the game.

as my dad would say, i kid you not.

In case any of you are interested, we're still looking for some folks to chair
panels at this year's Twentieth-Century Literature Conference, Feb. 22-24.
Areas that we still need to "cover" include both modern and contemporary
poetry (mostly, though not exclusively, American), film, postcolonial, and
Joyce. Featured speaker / readers this year are Bonnie Kime Scott, Tobias
Wolff, Meena Alexander. Listmates and fellow travellers who are scheduled to
come include Maria Damon, Chris Beach, Jena Osman, Kristin Prevallet, Mark
Scroggins, Chris and Debra Parr, . . . (if I've overlooked someone, apologies)

The person to contact is the conference director, Harriette Seiler, at
hmseil01@ulkyvm.louisville.edu.

Plus you get to see me, and what greater inducement could there be?

Scary thought for the day: that "The Gift Outright" is the best inaugural poem
we have.

Those on the list interested in HD should check out the HD Homepage.
Heather Hawkins and I have recently posted two reviews HD wrote in the
30's under the pseudonym Sylvania Penn. One reviews Edgar Guest's
biography of Whitman, the other Irving Stone's "biography in letters"
of Van Gogh. They provide a glimpse of HD engaged in rare critical
discussions of, in the one case, the American writing tradition and, in
the other, of representations of Van Gogh's "madness".

"Nielsen" used to be "Nielsen" -- though a first grade teacher, convinced
that I did not know how to spell my own name, forced me to write "Nelson"
on my name tag for parents' night, with exactly the consequences you'd
expect.  Cambridge more recently tried to make me a "Nielson," but we've
got that fixed --

More problematic is my first name, which was originally "Aldon," but
which people insist on pronouncing "All done" --  I will permit Alan
Golding to continue to pronounce it that way, as he's not a native
speaker (just kidding you All an), but will insist on having it my way
with all U.S. bred pronouncers -- (Danes seem to get it right for some
reason, despite it's having altered on these shores.)

Speaking of Scandanavics -- Swedish poet Werner Aspenstrom (you'll have
to imagine an umlaut over that "o") died in recent days -- Whatever the
merits of his verse (and I only read it in English translation, so
reserve final judgement), I always honored him for his stand in defense
of Rushdie when he was associated with the Nobel committee --

One of my favorite miscellaneous statistics in my collection is that after
the fall of Rome, no city reached equal size-population-dimentions-density
until London in the early nineteenth century.  Any classicists out there
know of poetic evocations of ancient Rome??   Beyond the panegyric "Rome is

Well, this isn't quite what you asked for, but I've always been fond of
Pound's retro-modernizing impulse in "Homage to Sextus Propertius," as in:

My cellar does not date from Numa Pompilius,
Nor bristle with wine jars,
Nor is it equipped with a frigidaire patent...

and then a few lines further on, when he talks about "expensive pyramids
scraping the stars in their route," it seems he must be thinking of
modern "skyscrapers."  This, btw, is one of my favorite Pound poems,
very funny and witty, hilariously "archaeological" w/out excessive
obscurity.  steve

From:         AERIALEDGE@AOL.COM
Subject:      review of _Some Other Kind of Mission_

This recently appeared in _The Washington Review_. Written, of course, with
that audience in mind but perhaps of interest to poetics.

_Some Other Kind of Mission_, Lisa Jarnot, Burning Deck, $11. Available from
fine booksellers everywhere.

Lisa Jarnot is a great artist. You haven't heard of her? Why haven't you
heard of her? Because her chosen art form is poetry & poetry doesn't matter
in America.

Why doesn't poetry matter in America? I don't know.

Let's look at Jarnot's book & try & figure that one out.  _Some Other Kind of
Mission_ is a subtle, elegant, intelligent book. There are lots of animals in
it. There are ferrets, black birds, squirrels, blue terns, carp, crawfish,
pigeons, pigs, chickens, and rabbit. The animals are the words already in
your head that are alive. You can't explain them. You need to be reminded of
this.

Why doesn't poetry matter in America? Because in America everything is _for_
something. It must have a use. You are a person, you are alive, you can't be
explained; but you can be used. But you can use poetry, this poetry, to
remind you that you are alive. Here's some:

"i was at the walls in bars and they were speaking all around the field soil.
they retracted me to the farm my plan. fuck you. in chaos. the bus behind the
plan and dreamt of spoken but retracted. having only terns and the firs and
the clover clever here at the lamplight in the firs of having clover. all
around at having field soil in the chaos. retracted having only in the
meticules unlikely farm. shot down by the motorcade in light of next to
polar. in chaos, still retracted, at the plan of having dreamt."

What I mean to say is the use most people are put to in America doesn't
follow from their need, but rather from the needs of a small number of rich
people. This has always been the case but it's gotten worse again lately.
Remember:

"Outside the sky is hanging by the composition of he who eats eats first with
we will sell you. and this ever you, and ever this ever you, and ever of you
this and. my love speaks about the overpass. my love speaks about newark. my
love speaks through the merging traffic. especially with the radio on."

Jarnot's book is both more & less political than this review. It is in the
realities of its own being as a book, and remains a constant word-life that
doesn't have to justify itself to you or any other discourse. & so it is
absolutely political because it knows itself. & I will tell you itself is
better than America ripping you & me & everybody to death of course but not
without a life to choose first thank you & you can't now because they use
you, you have to live up to them, they don't let you be what you are or even
let you think about it with other people mostly when you're with other people
you have to do the bull they give you food for or else you're just too tired
or horny or something but they just use you like some goddamn swizzle stick
or something. Ya know?

But I don't want to stop at that because there are so many things in Lisa
Jarnot's book. So many things she's doing that the excerpts above don't
really show. They always want you to tell them what it is don't they. But
they don't understand when you show them. Are they just dumb?

Why do I say poetry doesn't matter in America? Well, one example is a new
book of poetry by Bernadette Mayer published by New Directions called _Proper
Name and Other Stories_. There are a few "stories" in the book but mostly
it's poetry, a lot of it is prose poetry, but there is also a fair amount of
poetry with line breaks. So, why did they call it stories? Obviously they
thought they would sell more if they called it stories. A lot of booksellers
seem to think poetry doesn't sell so they don't order it. Of course it
doesn't sell if they don't have it. I have worked in three bookstores that
did order poetry & it did sell, a lot. That's the story. By the Way _Proper
Name_ is an amazing book. & I'm not picking on New Directions as if I could
at least they have the sense to publish Bernadette Mayer.

Lisa has a lot of very beautiful visual poems in her book. Well, they're not
visual poems really but poems being visual as well as poems. I mean a lot of
visual poems are to look at but these are to read and to look at at the same
time. At the very same time. The visual poems bring you into the book & let
you be there in the book too. They are mysterious. I should use some bigger
words I suppose to convince you. The book is organized as an imminent
pastiche. It's locales are neither authorial nor excessive, rather the
learned ideology of generalized freedom is a coaxing device to carry the
abandoned and irreversible time (a kind of _pseudo-cyclical exchangeability_)
_within_ the perception's "fully equipped" quantitative equality. The
unconscious superego is "always meeting hermits on the phone." It helps you
live here: ". . .in your neighborhood and the street you cross is inner
truth."

Someone might check on this, but there are indications that Tenochtitlan
(Mexico City today) was at the time of the Conquest the most populated
city in the world -- some way larger than London.  I don't know how this
would compare with ancient Rome (or London by the 19th), but just for
the record ...

Must respond right away to Rod Smith's excellent review of Lisa Jarnot's
book. Havent read the book (not even sure i'm getting her name straight)
but will now lay hands upon it a.s.a.p. But to appreciate much of what Rod
says, one doesnt need to have read the book: but to have read book_s_,
books of fine poetry for which this society finds no use. Ok, now, on the
britishpoets list, theres been much discussion of what to, as brainst(or
'd')reamers, abt our marginalization by the maindrainers (marvelous play on
"mandarins"), Some saying ignore 'em, others counseling tactical
intervention, etc. Provocative discussion. Anyway,as one who's for
intervention, I say why not try to reprint this review in one of various
(?) maindrain publications? Who knows--for some editor out there, the time
may feel ripe. db

It was a busy weekend for the poetry mavens of san francisco this weekend,
with three exciting readings in as many days.

It all started, as I remember it, on Friday night at new college, with Dodie
Bellamy welcoming Nathaniel Mackey into the space Robert Duncan used to hold
court in.  Mackey proceeded to bind us  in the spell of the Andoumboulou,
the prototypical humans we ourselves all-too-frequently resemble.  He read
from _School of Udra_, _What Said Serif_, and _Atet A.D._, a groovy Mystic
Horns Society epistle commissioned and then rejected for inclusion in the
JVC Jazz Festival Guide.  Some of the lines and phrases I caught were:

took to beng taken past the breaking point
desolate seed-pod, mother-in-law's tongue
as if by late light shaped
something a Sufi said in Andalusia
in oblique league with majesty
aspic allure
panicky butterfly, lyric escape
opaque pronouns, persons whether or not we knew who they were
seven-sided house said to have been left in heaven
"What does 'language is a fruit of which the skin is chatter' mean?" he asked.
rattled by wisdom's visit
an Ur-sound blew through our phones
I was the what-sayer:  whatever he'd say, I'd say, "So what."
gaze a ghost would give

Also witness to Mackey's entracing cadences were Steve Dickison, Tina
Rotenberg, Stephanie Baker, Rodrigo Toscano, Hung Tu, Renee Gladman,
Giovanni Singleton, Mary Burger, Pamela Lu, Jay Schwartz, Lauren Hudath,
Doug Powell, Robert Hale, David Larson and Aaron Shurin.

Afterwards there was crowding and smoking at the Elbo Room

On Saturday it was off to New Langton Arts on Folsom and 8th, where Kit
Robinson introduced Bill and Ted's Excellent Poetry Reading.  Bill being
Berkson, Ted being Greenwald, both being excellent.  Berkson went first,
reading from _Lush Life_ and diving into a short autobiographical story
about being a young autograph hound in New York in the 50's, waiting for
ballplayers outside hotel lobbies.  Also included was "Shelter", in memory
of Jim Brodey.  Some of Bill's gems included:

I can see where the sky takes a bend
I feel the finesse of particles
the strips in place are a snore of blue
"Sorry," says recorded time, "Didn't get it.  Lost my concentration."
ash is crystal.  ecstacy is near.
private mollusk and arachnid
midnight moonlight mobbed Dante's bridge
birds that freak in unison
worth mentioning?
amateur self always swapping cartoon bodies
one by one the prawns mounted the barfly's plate
the box pictures the box
do you recall the words for fog?

After a break in which many of us wandered upstairs to look at art made by
obsessives (and I mean that in an admiring way), we settled back down to
watch a video by Les Levine starring Ted Greenwald and Ted Greenwald as
poker sharks explaining the tricks of the trade.  Unfortunately, the wiring
from the VCR to the monitor was bad and the sound faded in and out, making
following the action a chore.  Luckily the real Ted Greenwald took his place
on the stage and picked up the slack.  Ted read almost without pausing
between poems, his foot keeping the beat as he delivered his work in
staccato rhythm.  Some of the endlessly permuted phrases were:

I be my own boss
I be my own police
honk when you leave your knees
"heart" as a verb
understands what inner workings?
boats planes trains telling it all
who would've thought self dissolves?
terrible modern flattery enters therapy
would you like to talk about it?
the calculations seem rotund
the figures round off
in need of multiple thighs
bored demi-smiles
can't imagine glass topic moving here

Audience members I recognized included Pat Reed, Alex Cory, Leslie
Scalapino, Laura Moriarty, Nick Robinson, Charlie Palau, Kush, Kenward
Elmslie, Kevin Killian, Dodie Bellamy and Lyn Hejinian.

Sunday at Canessa Park was the third leg of S.F. Poetry's Triple Crown, the
publication party for _Antenym_ 11.  Avery E.D. Burns, the guy with the
keys, was ill, and we didn't think we were going to get into the space for a
few minutes there, but Avery came through (though at times he didn't seem to
be all there, if you know what I mean) and we got started at 3:30.  After a
brief brain hiccup I was able to articulate some ideas on ontological
activism, the notion of bringing the question "what am I doing here?" out
for communal input and its transformation into "what are we all doing here?"
with its necessary corollary, "How do we wish to continue to be here?"  Then
Darin DeStefano read some new short poems, subtly twisting his words into
phrases like

amphibiously naked among stars
its softness wrecks my psychology so deftly
as if stones might begin ambiguously to song themselves
"The moon has become crazy over you, get on."
room after room of empty thumb
night chased me for hours
at 4:15 mother sends me to calm the bees

Instead of taking a break, we just plowed right through to Pat Reed, who
read her new handmade book called _Dawn Walking Shoes_, written at Green
Gulch Farm (a Zen monastery) in 1994, and moving on to some stories about
her Vietnamese ESL students.  Some lines from the book included

somewhere a small bell crimps the naked time
the trees fall through me
the blackbird's 3 notes start high and climb down
the sea-wave is a story of motion arriving at the beach

Eric Selland finishes us off with the complete _Songs_, his recently
completed series based on Japanese *tanka*, 5-line stanzas having the
syllabic pattern 5-7-5-7-7 (the resemblance ends there, he told us),
following that with stanzas read at random from his _Transparencies_, a long
work with a more complex architectural pattern  which I won't try to
describe.  Some of his lines were:

pointless a sky remains
empty no matter what not
gods who have escaped
border between tree and sky
the finite object becomes
still thought in the broken world
the substance of things
measuring the plenitude
not what I wanted to say

"That goddamn raven!  He's taken all my things!"

(OK, he didn't actually read that last one, but it's my favorite line from
the _Transparencies_, so I thought I'd share it)

The audience included Andrew Joron, Sheldon Forrest, Mary-Sullivan Roark,
Steve Dickison, Tina Rotenberg, Chris Daniels, Kristin Burkart and Lawrence
Fixel.  Afterwards some of us went to the Lotus Garden on Grant and
California for Chinese vegetarian feasting complete with moon cakes for dessert.

So I guess I won the triple crown, being the only one with the stamina to
absorb three days of poetry.  I cannot celebrate, however.  I got home to
discover _The X Files_ was already half over.  :-(

I'll check on this but it's clear that when Cortes landed,
Tenochtitlan was certainly bigger than any city in Spain.

I do know that Teotihuacan, some centuries earlier and near
Tenochtitlan, spread over an area larger than ancient Rome at its
height, its influence spreading far into Central America.

Another thought is that on the Mayan side of things, American

Subject:      Getting the word out
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

I want to revisit the subject of my last and maybe start a thread by
broadening the complaint (although veterans of the list may have been here
before).
As a neophyte publisher (5 books, but the pace is quickening) I have learned
that if you want to get the work into the hands of more than just friends
and family of press and poet you've got to get reviews. But all reviews are
not created equal: the ones that count most are Publishers Weekly, Library
Journal and Booklist (The Times would be nice, but who am I kidding?). They
review a very small number of books. They have--all three of them--picked up
two of mine. Guess what? the two that could be called conventional.
That's part one. Second topic: when a book gets reviewed by someone you
don't know. I've learned, the hard way, that a new book has to be
accompanied by a toolkit and user's guide, no matter how limpid the verse.
And that guide had better be written for readers with limited English. I
hate doing this; I've always thought that a poem or book should speak for
itself, although a recommendation is always nice. One of my poets, Mervyn
Taylor, I snagged for the press after hearing him read. Stephen Vincent came
to me when a friend handed me his manuscript. But here's what happens if the
user's guide isn't ridiculously detailed. One reviewer of a book of mine
noted that it consisted of two long poems and a serial poem (both the book
jacket and the press release told him that) and then proceded to review the
book as if each fragment of verse was independent of any overarching
structure. Sort of missing the point.
I think about this a lot as I wind down the design and typesetting phase of
getting out Rochelle Owens' New and Selected. It's a big book, and a big
investment for a small press, and it sure aint conventional. So I begin to
gear up to write a press release that is also an independent piece of
criticism on the subject of "why I like this book and think you should like
it, too."
Third topic: the natural audience. If there is a natural audience, one that
doesn't need a hard sell, I should think it would be the mass of poets who
want me to publish their work. I have a large pile of unreturned manuscripts
(I know, I know, I'll get to them). Most are dreadful, one will get a kind
note, all are inappropriate, and apparently so, for Junction Press. None of
these folks have read, or even looked at, any of Junction's books, and none
claim to have done so. This is true even for a couple of reasonably
well-known folks who should know better.
This rambles. I suppose my point is that I expect most books, poems,
performances, concerts, to be somewhere on a continuum between hohum and
embarassing. But I dive in for the occasional find that may change my life
and my practice in ways that I couldn't anticipate and that I neither sought
nor necessarily desired. A lot like writing.
And this might be the nub. We live in a fearful and self-restricting
culture, and we're trying to push the aleatory. What will happen to the
children if we teach them that there's a world beyond the prisons?


For the record, here's a list of Junction's five available publications.
Toolkit and guide will be included, along with free samples, in my
up-an-coming website.

Mervyn Taylor, _An Island of His Own_. $9.00. A very few copies left at this
price.
        Second printing will be higher.
Susie Mee, _The Undertaker's Daughter_. $9.00
Richard Elman, _Cathedral-Tree-Train_. $9.00
Stephen Vincent, _Walking_. $9.00
Mark Weiss, _Fieldnotes_. $11.00

Orders accompanied by check to: Junction Press, PO Box 40537, San Diego CA
92164. Add $1.50 postage and handling in US. Aliens--backchannel for terms.

>This is all true, but limited. Part of the audience for any dance event is
the large number of young women who study dance, and a Merce Cunningham
performance is a celebrity event. Allen Ginsberg can also fill a hall. There
are lots of wonderful small dance companies slowly starving on grants and
their members' day jobs. Audiences at their performances are usually tiny.
The same for new music groups (and old--San Diego just lost its symphony
orchestra).
>More to the point, both performances sited are far more passive experiences
for the audience than listening to a meditative poem (See what the audience
composition is at a performance of, say, the Bach Partitas, on the one hand,
or an Elliot Carter piece, on the other). Attention to any live performance
is a learned skill, but I suspect that the learning curve, certainly for
non-poets, is steeper for most poetry readings, even well-staged ones.
>I love readings--I've run several series, I've broadcast them, and I'm not
a bad reader, myself. But I think of them primarily as an aid to and
propaganda for the performance that takes place in a subsequent private
reading. If the reader is to incorporate the poem into his/her own breathing
it's likely to be in solitude book-in-hand.
>For children who don't learn this experience at home the schools are the
only entrance. And they certainly foul up the works. It would help if
teachers loved poetry, but they are victims of the same system, and their
negative attitude is reinforced by the reactions of the kids to what passes
for a poetry curriculum.
>So that's the place to start--jazz up the curriculum, make the teaching
more verbal and performance-oriented, and send the kids home with poetry
appropriate to their age and abilities.

That would be the title of Berkson's collection from Z Press. _Lush Life_
is pretty good. For 100% Berkson excitement go straight to _Saturday

Three poets read with a jazz group Jan. 29, Bangor, Maine, Borders. Terry
Hunter, Kathleen (Lignell) Ellis, and I. They read Corso, Kerouac, langston
Hughes, Gwendolyn Brooks, etc. as well as their own stuff. I read mine plus
some haiku from Lane Dunlop, two poems of Paul Blackburn, and Hart Crane's
"To Brooklyn Bridge" with the group playing Charlie Mingus's "Nostalgia on
Times Square" behind it. That might be a first for this planet. Maybe even
a last, though it actually sounded pretty good. Good crowd, 30-40 people,
including a bunch of young kids, down to maybe 4 years old. The beat goes
on. One degree (F.) when I left, and six below this morning.

along these lines -- remember Sonny Rollins playing on "The Bridge" (not
to be confused with our memories of the reenactment in later decades for
SONY) -- then read Baraka's "The Bridge" -- while you're enjoying that,
take a peek at Baraka's "Way Out West" (another Rollins ref.) which just
precedes "The Bridge" in the recent selected --

On the drive West from Denver, I heard on radio the latest CD of the

Mark---
I take it that you are trying hard to get Junction Books into libraries,
as you mention Pub. Weekly, Library Journal & Booklist.  These impact on
book retailers, I know, but not LJ so much...(or so I assume: I've been a
library professional for 20 years, but have only worked in the retail book
trade briefly, and not by choice).  Of course, if I were publishing an
interesting & impressive list like yours looks to be, I'd try hard to
contact the kind of folks that are on this listserv, that read the
non-mainstream poetry journals (so many new ones seem to be mushrooming
recently--my budget keeps me from seeing half of them!)
But I assume you've thought of that; and certainly the interesting poetry
journals have little space for reviews so you haven't that good a shot
with them, and promotional mailings via snail are probably far too costly
for you, considering the relatively small number of orders from
individuals you'd get in return.

So for marketing to individuals, or to try to get into a wider range of
bookstores, I can see that it's hard.

However, as a library professional, I feel that publishers like yourself
need to get into libraries across the country more; this is tougher than
ever, as we in the library world are among the first of all institutions
to get slashed by the budget cleaver, in times of extreme capitalist
recession/ depression.  But it is still possible to do something.  This is
a position I've advocated in our poetry publication here in Atlanta, Misc.
Proj., which I edit.  I'm repeating it here more as a general polemic to
the list as a whole than in response to your posting, because it's
something that has to be done not by the publisher but by concerned
readers & writers around the country.  This is to inundate our local
libraries with purchase requests for material like this.  Public libraries
are among the most heavily hit by budget cuts and also do not always want
to order from small publishers (sometimes profoundly stupid laws prevent
them from using all but a few mainstream book jobbers selected thru
competitive bidding, & in this way dissident material is entierly ruled
out).  Academic libraries are better, & since a fair number of people on
the list have some academic affiliation, I'd strongly plead that they
submit written requests to their institutions' humanities libraries,
asking that they purchase Junction & other nonmainstream
publishers...However, your local public library is very worth trying! Not
all are unable/unwilling to respond to these requests.  The idea is not to
ask that they pursue a particular publisher, but to request individual
titles that you would like to check out & use yourself once they are
cataloged...many libraries (most, I think) really want their users to give
them requests like this.

Altho' I'm not faculty at Emory University (nor a librarian: I have only a
BA degree) I've been accepted by our main library here as something of an
honorary poetry bibliographer; that is, they generally order what I
request from publishers like Potes & Poets, Sun & Moon, Roof, The Figures,
Talisman House, Zoland etc.  This is a somewhat special institution (often
called Coca-Cola University) because of the huge endowment from Coke's
main owning families, which has allowed an unusually healthy library
acquisitions budget, for this point in the economic crisis.  Still, we
could all do alot along these lines, and help to support non-mainstream
poetry in a way that goes beyond our limited personal budgets.  (And mine
is very limited, believe me!)

This book is available from the distributors, and is published by Lusit-
ania.  I've been working on it for the past two years or so. It might be
of interest to you; the texts and artworks are fairly wide-ranging.

The post below includes the initial press release; I won't send out a
fuller description here.

Hope you find it of interest,

The book Being On Line, Net Subjectivity, is just about here, and can be
ordered through the distributors. I'll send out a fuller description in a
week, but you can order now.

Much of the contents is from Cybermind and Fop-l participants and con-
tacts. The work was initially gathered about two years ago, with additions
and modifications until early summer. I wanted to include texts that would
not become dated, would comment astutely on "being on line," and would be
of literary interest as well.

The description below is a press release only. The full list of authors:
Honoria, Peter Krapp, Steven Meinking, Brian Carr, Ellen Zweig, Alan
Sondheim, Karen Wohlblatt, Fridrich Kittler, Andy Hawks, Rose Mulvale,

... an anthology of 19th-century American
women poets.  Production was delayed and there was some
confusion about who was publishing the US edition - _Books
in Print_ listed it as coming out from the wrong press!
But it is now out.  The title is _She Wields a Pen: American
Women Poets of the 19th Century_ and the US press (hardback
and paperback) is the University of Iowa Press.

I would be glad to hear privately from any who have
questions about the anthology.

Let me underline Mark Prejsnar's suggestion, as following through on it is
vital to the survival of the culture of poetry.

I can solicit libraries all I want (and I do a lot), but finally it's the
customers' demands that move poetry books from the bottom to the top of the
librarians' wish-lists.

Too many good presses die, not for the lack of dedication on the part of
their publishers, but because of poor receipts and despair over getting the
books into the hands of potential readers.

Mark W---
First, I want to say that Mark P gives some good advice. You might also
want to contact CLMP and get their monograph on marketing your books to
libraries and to teachers as texts to be taught in their classes.

Second, I'm a reviewer (like many on this list, I'm sure) -- mostly
non-mainstream fiction/nonfiction and poetry titles. Reviews are important
in PW, LJ, etc, but so are reviews in smaller magazines even when they
come after pub dates. I'm certain you know that your backlist is what will
allow you to continue publishing.

As for the toolkit/user's guide, I try not to read them until I have read
the book. But then I will also read other books by the author or articles
about him or her before I begin writing my review. You have to tread
carefully here in my opinion. Some reviewers will be annoyed and even
angered by suggestions about how to read the book. On the other hand, I
don't mind reading press releases which give me some idea and sample of
the writing. For that matter, this often makes the decision about whether
I review an unknown book.

Needless to say, many reviewers have agendas. I know for myself that I am
as interested in getting published by a good magazine as the author was to
get published by a good publisher. I will also use a book or books to
advance an idea or introduce new poets or forms to mainstream
publications. This is where reviews overlap with essays and journalism. I
suppose what I'm saying is what you already know -- a review is subject to
a great number of variables. However, it's not all that bad. At one
magazine I review for, I'm given a choice amoung books my editor knows
that I will "understand." Of course, this doesn't mean that I will
automatically deem the work successful, but it does mean that I won't be
scared off or befuddled by the unconventional.

Best of luck. I'd like to know when your website is up.

Steven Marks

That's not exactly true. Every time Bromige is around me he starts taking
his pants off! My wife tells me to be patient. She says she understands
these things. Says she used to work in London, Ontario.

The way I remember it from the time, he was playing UNDER the bridge. Maybe
he was doing both, or maybe in the re-enactment, the producers thought on
the bridge wd be more dramatic.

Try listening to any cracking jazz and then read ANY Amiri-it's all
cracking.  Better yet,  see the man read LIVE.  He's a firecracker!  I
saw him read two years ago at Border's in center city Philly.  He was
reading from his then new selected on Marsilio Press,  which contains his
Y's/Why's/Wise series.  Each poem is dedicated to a jazz player,  and
Amiri elucidated this vocally by prefacing each poem with a frenetical
scatting out of a phrase from
said musician's  music.  It was incredible!  The guy was bouncing off the
walls,  putting as much energy into his sound quote as into his actual
reading of his poems.  It gives confirming perspective to Amiri's work,
knowing that he has always thought in a sound way-this is
obvious in the way his words crash and take the unexpected right
turn-"BangClash!" And he has also written extensively on the history of
jazz and black music.  It also helps elucidate the music he quoted:
Coltrane,  Miles, etc.  In their more frenetic soloing,  I get a sense
of struggling with expression in all those licks and turns (Coltrane's
sheets of sound) as if "If I can't get it THIS way,  then how 'bout
THIS way,  or THIS...",  and all that mad finger articulation and
extension.  The music becomes very physical,  almost solid,  as if a
physical manipulation of some dark mass of undifferentiated meaning that
is slashed at again and again by the musicians. And it seems Amiri works
at this too,  using sometimes hairpin juxtaposition of words,  sometimes
fusing words to make new ones,  scoring the poetry on the page,  always
creating an expression that is
sharp,  pointed,  and violently rhythmic.  His readings of his poems
really brought this to the foreground.

Thomas Bell writes:
"The latest New Yorker has a story on August Wilson's June speech where
he "declared [American theatre is] an intrument of white cultural
hegemony, and
the recent campaign to integrate and diversify it only makes things
worse....they needed integration the way they needed acid rain."
tom bell

very interesting story, but I think it will take me some time to figure out
how I feel about it."

Wilson's stance is that the more the black theatre,  or any minority art
form or cause,  is subsidized and supported by the white cultural
authority,  the more it is diluted and divested of its initial energy and
focus in being a seperate entity that does NOT share the goals and
ideologies of the ruling cultural authority. This dilution can be
measured largely in funding dollars and audience numbers. One of Wilson's
examples of white cultural hegemony (in NY) was a larger non-minority
theatre
bringing in black actors to do more black shows,  because it has been
discovered by these producers that black theatre sells to white audiences,
while getting funding for
it.  Meanwhile,  the smaller black theatres are watching as their already
small funding and audiences are leached by these larger,  more powerful
theatres.
        The delicacy of Wilson's stance in creating an all-black theatre
in America,  a theatre by,  for,  and about blacks,  is revealed when he is
critiqued for having his work produced by large non-black theatres,
such as
Yale Rep and on Broadway,  and when he receives numerous awards from the
so-called white cultural hegemony.  One could say he speaks from a
singular and privileged position.  The second half of the article is also
interesting,  and gets rather randy with the stories of the so-called
"Chitlin" theatre circuit,  which,  as Gates posits,  could be,  albeit
unexpectedly,  the all-black theatre for which Wilson asks.

every evening at Bowering Manor the Master of the House, the port having
gone around the requisite number of times, insists on the guests removing
their nether garments! (those from the Down Under Suite are always the
first to accomplish this task.) Reluctantly, I comply, out of politesse,
not lickerishness. On the most recent occasion, sad to say, the Master
proved unable to complete what he had begun--his feet becoming entangled in
his pantlegs (it's probably thanks to them being pegged, a style popular in
Oliver, B.C.in the 50s), after a while he simply gave up and remained at
table with his pants around his ankles while the rest of us swam in the
East Pool and had all kinds of fun.
   I suppose this thread concerns memory. Like Keith Waldrop and myself,
when he eats a madeleine, george thinks of Proust; but unlike Keith, we
think of Alfred Proust,a Kitsilano pharmacist whose 'madeleines' were so
popular when those who are now in their sixties were in their forties, with
the faculty of memory about to sustain heavy damage. For myself, I always
remember George fondly.

   btw, george, i notice that yr postings, each done around 6 pm today,

London, Ontario? Tell us, Old Chep, what the Forest City has to do with the
compulsive debagging of oneself? Dragland, Davey and Dewdney always keep

roman a clef we'd like to see published?

i fr one would *hope* that any reviewer wd have agendas; only complaint
is when those agendas are not clear (& ideally, articulated)...

but i'm not clear frm the above paragraph if yr equating "good magazine"
w/ "mainstream publication"...  there are plenty of good magazines running
reviews and substantial critical work--Witz, Poetry Project Newsletter,
Poetic Briefs, Mondo Hunkamooga, Chain, Texture, Compound Eye, Factsheet
Five, Dusty Dog Reviews, Small Press Review, my own TapRoot Reviews...
none of 'em "mainstream", & praps lacking th academic credability
of PW LJ NYTBR et al; but if getting books into hands that'll read 'em is
th objective i'd suggest that the more narrowly targeted smallpress reviews
will be more effective than the prestige jrnls.  because no matter how lauditory
th review, the majority ov the bookbuying public will still "be scared off
or befuddled by the unconventional."  if, on th other hand, the idea is to
sell
books, make sure the product is conventional--mickeyD is succesful
(economically,
not gastronomically) because the consumer knows that s/he will get exactly
th same thing everytime...

You may all be intrigued to hear that CBC, the national broadcaster here,
on its flagship national news this morning, ran a story on THE biggest
cowboy poetry gsthering of all, in Elko, Navada. Partly because a number of
Canadian singers & 'poets' are performing there. And we heard some
examples: humorous rhyming couplets, representing, in a lighthearted
manner, the 'real life' of cowboy experience, running from an angry bear,
or working a horse, or whatever. There are a couple of things going on
here: this stuff is awfully popular (is it alsop 'populist'?); the kind of
people who do this & who attend these gatherings, think this is what poetry
is, & that when it can 'make sense,' 'tell a real story,' & so on, it is
'real' in a way that all that hi-falutin stuff doesnt. There's also a
nostalgia at work, I think, which means it re-presents a version of what
Robert Kroetsch called 'a dream of origins', but does so without any kind
of interrogative vision of social, cultural, ideologies in action. Is this
where 'pastoral' has gone?

I haven't read Gates's comments on the "unexpected" (are they also in the
_New Yorker_?) -- but this too wd seem to have been a coulda been rather
than a present possibility -- The Apollo is maintained after a fashion --
the Howard, however, never was reopened as the Howard Foundation proved
infirm (One might ask why none of those development dollars that rebuilt
commercial downtown DC were used to save that theater as an opearting
concern) --

Can any of you in Chicago inform me of the present status of the Regal
Theater?

and yes, Wilson's comments, however true, are odd to the extent that had
he not been picked up by the Yale Rep many years ago, he probably could
not get a hearing in the _New Yorker_ today -- which is more of a
negative comment about the _NYer_ than about Wilson's comments --

Thanks to Kyle for that further etc -- BUT -- readers should get the
Third World Press ed. of _Ys_ to see how the sequence unfolds (THOUGH,
their version of the spouting whale that appears at the end of one of the
poems looks more like a flying mechanical caterpillar)

Best live performance of this work I've seen, out of many, was when
Baraka read it with the group Blue Ark -- the music was worked to the
verse better than anything he's done since his performances with David
Murray of many years back --

AND it would seem that George Bowering is truly George the Memorious if
he remembers Rollins playing under the bridge -- Crane also played under
bridges, but Sony did not want to appropriate that action for their ad
campaign --

I thought that comment might be more about getting into magazines/journals
that pay reviewers at least a fairly decent fee. It is difficult making it
as a freelance writer, and even more difficult if one wants primarily to
write about literature and the arts. And if one can do so, and write about
topics germane to this list as well, I can only support her/him wholeheartedly.

Look, kids, I've been doing this for a while. I send out about 100 review
copies for each book, to all kinds of places. While there are exceptions,
unless the poet is already notorious or is easily identified with a category
of interest the books get reviewed by, a) friends and acquaintances of mine
or the author's, or, b) reviewers assigned by friends and acquaintances,
etc., who edit a given periodical. One way or another the books get
reviewed, although a hundred requests may yield 3 or 4 reviews, rarely more.
And the reviews that appear in the periodicals I like to read generate
almost no sales.
Think about it this way: I send a book to, say, Taproot. It gets a rave.
Three people buy it (that's a bonanza for a small press review). It's cost
me a freebie and postage to sell those three books. Not to speak of time and
effort.
The books do sell, eventually, some better than others, and I'm not about to
throw in the towel. I remain committed to printing the best, according to my
lights, that comes my way, without a glance at commercial viability, and I
do have a taste for the marginal, the good stuff that doesn't belong to any
club. But at 1000 copies per printing they do tend to clog the warehouse for
an inordinate amount of time, and it would be helpful if they generated
enough capital to pay for the production costs of the next one down the pike.
Which brings me back where I started. I don't share Luigi's pessimism (or
arrogance?). I think there are a fair number of potential readers to be
reached, although they may be a small percentage of the general book market.
They have been educated to not read poetry--maybe they can be uneducated. To
that end, I think that Mark Presjnar's suggestion is essential--bug your
librarian.
It's hard not to think about the economics of this game when you're faced
with the next bill from the printer.

"In 1978, a new magazine appeared on the American poetry scene.  The
magazine, strangely titled L=3DA=3DN=3DG=3DU=3DA=3DG=3DE, became during its=
 four years of
publication a main forum for a group of young writers keen to engage in
theoretical speculation and debate about their medium.  L=3DA=3DN=3DG=3DU=3D=
A=3DG=3DE
disappeared in 1981, but its name has lingered on, mainly as a means of
designating a higly varied body of work which was shaped by the emerging

**************************************

Serge Gavronsky introduces to American readers six of the best contemporary
French women poets: Leslie Kaplan, Michelle Grangaud, Anne Portugal, Jos=E9e
Lapeyr=E8re, Liliane Giraudon, and Jacqueline Risset.

**************************************

Although many practice the art, contemporary French women poets generally
have been vastly underrepresented in periodicals and anthologies.  In the
only anthology to feature avant-garde French women poets exclusively,
Gavronsky shows how Kaplan, Grangaud, Portugal, Lapeyr=E8re, Giraudon, and
Risset differ from their American counterparts.

Before presenting his translations of the poems, Gavronsky gives each poet
the opportunity to define herself in terms of major influences on her
poetry, distinctive traits in her writing, major themes in her work, and the
influence of gender on her art.  The poets also speculate about the relative
underrepresentation of women poets in French periodicals and anthologies as
well as about the form poetry might take in the twenty-first century.

The poems in this volume are simultaneously delightful, informative, and
combative.  They typify, according to Gavronsky, some of the main currents
of a poetics in the making, a poetics little known in the United States.  In
reaffirming women's involvement with poetry, Gavronsky believes that he has
"reconnected today's work with an immemorial tradition that, in France,
clearly goes back to [the] Middle Ages."

**************************************

Serge Gavronsky, born in Paris, is a professor in and chair of the
Department of French at Barnard College, Columbia University.  He has
published both French and English poetry in books, magazines, and
anthologies in the United States, France, and Italy.  A novelist and
literary critic, he has translated American poetry into French as well as
French poetry into English.

By "good," I mean magazines like those you list as well as ones like
Another Chicago Magazine, Green Mountains Review, Boston Book Review,
American Book Review, etc.

I agree that targeted reviews are often far more effective for the
publisher than the prestige journals for the reason you state. A review in
one of the little magazines can start a buzz among potential buyers unlike
the bigger magazines. Of course, the most targeted review is a
word-of-mouth review. That's why I would agree with Mark P that
discussions on lists like this are so valuable. But then again, it's often
a review that begins the conversation.

Hi all--

I'm looking for any suggestions (books, essays, manifestos, whatever) re.
spirit possession, spirti doctors, getting the spirit, conjuring in
connection with performance and the performative. Also essays about spirit
possession and subjectivity.

Any ideas at all?  Thanks!  Feel free to back channel to me, if you'd
like.

John High / (FROM) THE SASHA POEMS
Juxta/3300 Press, 1996
isbn 0964601737
($5.00 / orders to: 3300 Press, 300 Vicksburg St, Suite 5, San Francisco, CA
94114)


     _The Sasha Poems_ are a sequence of 32 prose poems, in a style which is
simultaneously terse, precise, visionary and exalted - as if (to make a jarring
comparison) Ernest Hemingway came back from the dead as St. Francis (or better,
an Eastern Orthodox mystic).  They represent a dream-journey or pilgrimage
through a real landscape - strangely silent and void of crowds, but thickly
peopled with animals, plants and stones radiating consciousness - a very
animate hobo path.  The poems are narrated by a voice that alternates and
blends the voices of father and very young daughter - as though daughter
were leading father on this visionary journey - learning to speak, write
and "make her book" - while simultaneously evoking the ongoing creation of
the "book" of nature/life.  Occasionally these voices are augmented by
a mysterious group of monks &/or other children accompanying them on their
way.  There is a pervasive aura of uncanniness & child-vision - of a spiritual
journey away from, or on the margins of, "the world", and into the poverty
and wealth of an overwhelming "transcendent" reality.

     This provides only the barest outline by which John High has
structured his work.  The framing of the journey led by the child -
or the tandem of child and "father" - supports a truly "poetic" prose,
in which individual sentences, paradoxically, don't "go" anywhere:
weighted with lyric fulness, a Blakean "innocence", the sentences
testify to a continual newness/strangeness - a "new creation" which
is also the "end" of the journey.  That is, they are suffused with
mystery.   Here is a brief excerpt:

     Three match sticks, a bottle of vodka, a chunk of black bread the
monks left behind as they savored the night.  Now that the monks, too,
were again wandering, the sky was difficult to locate.  These thick
mountains & waterfalls & skulls--human skulls embodied in our earth.
The dead come forth with the living.  Mother Goose beaming.  The monks
conversing among themselves as they incarnate the joy & darkness.
Almost human.  Remnants of a life, an orchard sun, the split cherry
unseen in the valley.  A quiet but not unrequited love singing among the
living.  O matchmaker, what informs this urge to be inside the cherry.
     The child edged up beside me.  The father not blue, still in this
trance he dreamed a monk into every stone, every piece of dust, every
imagined moon.  Later the child would translate this into her diary as
another nursery rhyme beginning, Hickety pickety my black hen, she lays
good eggs for gentlemen...
     Angel flakes falling on our furry heads!
(from "wild blue yonder, #30)

John High spent four years in Russia, and has translated the poetry of
Nina Isrenko and Ivan Zhdanov into english (a selected poems by Zhdanov
- an amazing collection, I might add - has just been published by
Talisman House).  He has managed to fuse a sort of bare, wild California-
gypsy landscape with a deep awareness of Russian poetic and religious
traditions.  The voice of these poems oscillates between a child's
first verbal steps and naive wonder, and a grown person's more salted
meditations - an oscillation on a continuum.  What emerges is both
a challenge and an invitation: to enter a reality of... how to
"paraphrase" it?  "Animate meaning."  This is not a solemn journey,
but full of humor and pathos.  Excerpts don't do it justice, but
here's another anyway:

    These sparrows no one beckons!  The angel picked a muffler from the
water, content to mimic the day.  If those who lead you say--Look the Kingdom,
it is in the sky__then the birds of the sky will get there first, the angel
heckled as a possum scampered by.  Since its own wings were burnt, the
angel again exploded in flames.  Though the mud itself was cool on our toes.
The field presently shrouded in an early autumn fog as a turtle turned in
the bush.  If the child had known flowers, she would have named them too
in our eternalistic pathos...Can you translate the silence, papa?  she
next inquired.
     This is the origin of many tests.  O gray hummingbird!  A birth
meandering along the road.  So many joys no one had mentioned to the father
before now.  _Jack be nimble, jack be quick_.  She laid the pages down
on the ground & called it a book.  The ants & approaching squirrels called
it a diary.
     This will be my book, papa.
(from "a map, a goose, & a fairy tale, #6)

Jim Leftwich, in his excellent afterword to this book, quotes Jung as
follows:  "It is therefore psychologically quite unthinkable for God to
be simply the 'wholly other', for a 'wholly other' could never be one of
the soul's deepest and closest intimacies--which is precisely what God is."
The excerpt above hints at some of the ironies present in High's use
of a somewhat undefined narrator.  The voice is both the child talking to
her papa, and the adult, "praying" to the father; & steeped into the plot
of this sequence is the absent presence of the "third" person: the wife/
mother (who is spoken of & to, but who is also absent).  There are some
theological ironies buried here.  "This will be my book, papa" - John
High has (perhaps) written some journal notes toward the _Book of J_.

This country has since its beginning been awash in marketable spiritual
and spiritualist commodities; but John High has based his premises too
firmly on a foundation of personal experience, poetic understanding,
and "paid dues" to fall into the circle of the ersatz.  A few weeks ago
I floated a prolegomena to a "Providence School" of poetry, based on
a (homemade) philosophical distinction between a metaphysical realism
on the one hand, and a postmodernist nominalism on the other; between
an experience-based "seriousness" on the one hand, and a pure aestheticism
on the other.  I named the current generation of Russian poets of the
"metarealist" and "neo-Acmeist" persuasions (as outlined theoretically
by Mikhail Epstein) as models in this endeavor.  It would be a disservice
to John High to ride my "theories" on the coattails of his writing; so
let me put this in a very conditional mode: IF there WERE a "Providence
School", John High's work - which offers a lyrical testimony to the mystery
of cosmic redemption (Mandelstam's divine game of "hide & seek") - and
a challenge to wash our eyes in a new vision of nature - John High's
SASHA POEMS would be one of the school's well-thumbed, well-read, oft-
cited and recited pleasures.  I hope others on this list will be
encouraged to take this eerie, beautiful, skilled, & gently-loping
journey too.

Me & the fambly are gonna be in Phoenix area March 3-12 scouting out a
possible southern base for Dreamtime 60 miles north of the city.  I know
this is quite a late time to try to set something up, but we could be in
the area with our books to set up & do readings (Zon can sometimes even
be coaxed to do his monster language!)  & text/performance.  & if there
is access to a macintosh projector I can bring a harddrive & present
some of my computer poetry & other hypermedia projects.

Got any ideas, contact or leads?

were again wandering, the sky was difficult to locate.  These thick
mountains & waterfalls & skulls--human skulls embodied in our earth.
The dead come forth with the living.  Mother Goose beaming.  The monks
conversing among themselves as they incarnate the joy & darkness.
Almost human.  Remnants of a life, an orchard sun, the split cherry
unseen in the valley.  A quiet but not unrequited love singing among the
living.  O matchmaker, what informs this urge to be inside the cherry.
     The child edged up beside me.  The father not blue, still in this
trance he dreamed a monk into every stone, every piece of dust, every
imagined moon.  Later the child would translate this into her diary as
another nursery rhyme beginning, Hickety pickety my black hen, she lays
good eggs for gentlemen...
     Angel flakes falling on our furry heads!
(from "wild blue yonder, #30)

John High spent four years in Russia, and has translated the poetry of
Nina Isrenko and Ivan Zhdanov into english (a selected poems by Zhdanov
 - an amazing collection, I might add - has just been published by
Talisman House).  He has managed to fuse a sort of bare, wild California-
gypsy landscape with a deep awareness of Russian poetic and religious
traditions.  The voice of these poems oscillates between a child's
first verbal steps and naive wonder, and a grown person's more salted
meditations - an oscillation on a continuum.  What emerges is both
a challenge and an invitation: to enter a reality of... how to
"paraphrase" it?  "Animate meaning."  This is not a solemn journey,
but full of humor and pathos.  Excerpts don't do it justice, but
here's another anyway:

    These sparrows no one beckons!  The angel picked a muffler from the
water, content to mimic the day.  If those who lead you say--Look the
Kingdom,
it is in the sky__then the birds of the sky will get there first, the angel
heckled as a possum scampered by.  Since its own wings were burnt, the
angel again exploded in flames.  Though the mud itself was cool on our toes.
The field presently shrouded in an early autumn fog as a turtle turned in
the bush.  If the child had known flowers, she would have named them too
in our eternalistic pathos...Can you translate the silence, papa?  she
next inquired.
     This is the origin of many tests.  O gray hummingbird!  A birth
meandering along the road.  So many joys no one had mentioned to the father
before now.  _Jack be nimble, jack be quick_.  She laid the pages down
on the ground & called it a book.  The ants & approaching squirrels called
it a diary.
     This will be my book, papa.
(from "a map, a goose, & a fairy tale, #6)

Jim Leftwich, in his excellent afterword to this book, quotes Jung as
follows:  "It is therefore psychologically quite unthinkable for God to
be simply the 'wholly other', for a 'wholly other' could never be one of
the soul's deepest and closest intimacies--which is precisely what God is."
The excerpt above hints at some of the ironies present in High's use
of a somewhat undefined narrator.  The voice is both the child talking to
her papa, and the adult, "praying" to the father; & steeped into the plot
of this sequence is the absent presence of the "third" person: the wife/
mother (who is spoken of & to, but who is also absent).  There are some
theological ironies buried here.  "This will be my book, papa" - John
High has (perhaps) written some journal notes toward the _Book of J_.

This country has since its beginning been awash in marketable spiritual
and spiritualist commodities; but John High has based his premises too
firmly on a foundation of personal experience, poetic understanding,
and "paid dues" to fall into the circle of the ersatz.  A few weeks ago
I floated a prolegomena to a "Providence School" of poetry, based on
a (homemade) philosophical distinction between a metaphysical realism
on the one hand, and a postmodernist nominalism on the other; between
an experience-based "seriousness" on the one hand, and a pure aestheticism
on the other.  I named the current generation of Russian poets of the
"metarealist" and "neo-Acmeist" persuasions (as outlined theoretically
by Mikhail Epstein) as models in this endeavor.  It would be a disservice
to John High to ride my "theories" on the coattails of his writing; so
let me put this in a very conditional mode: IF there WERE a "Providence
School", John High's work - which offers a lyrical testimony to the mystery
of cosmic redemption (Mandelstam's divine game of "hide & seek") - and
a challenge to wash our eyes in a new vision of nature - John High's
SASHA POEMS would be one of the school's well-thumbed, well-read, oft-
cited and recited pleasures.  I hope others on this list will be
encouraged to take this eerie, beautiful, skilled, & gently-loping
journey too.

there's a short story by baraka whose name escapes me about a band playing at a
neighborhood workingclass black bar that gets everybody so hyped up they spill
out of the bar and take over the streets; it's not literally about spirit
possessoin (try Mumbo Jumbo for that) but abt art, politics, performance and
getting "carried away."

Try Zora Neal Hurston's _Tell My Horse_. One of the best things on
Voudon and possession I've ever read. And of course Ishmael Reed's
_Mumbo Jumbo_.
