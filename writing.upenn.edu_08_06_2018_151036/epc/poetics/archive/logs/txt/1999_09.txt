I think perhaps some "attitude" was spawned from the line: "But most
*poets* really don't got much...."

I could only assume that the emphasis was on "real" poets. But we have been
around this class bush repeatedly, as someone pointed out.

I think Allen Bramhall's post was a call to action, and practical action at
that: If there are 700 people on the list & everyone gives $1.00 (minus,
perhaps 10 or so people who don't have a dollar to spare), then we have 690
more than Cid started out with. If people who can spare five do, and those
who can spare twenty do, etc., well then, that'd be a tidy sum.

And an admirable social project.

Those who can't, can't, and needn't.

Is there an address where we can send a check?

Thinking of Japanese Surrealism:

is there really something
~essentially~ Japanese about
cultural borrowing on large-scale
not having much sense of
the ~original intentions~ of
what is borrowed.

I cannot presently think of any such
anywhere. Put it down to
     usual process of
translation or appropriation.

Mark,
We DO live on the same planet.  Twenty dollars was an arbitrary figure I
cldn't (easily) afford either.  The point is elsewhere - money is secret.
So what gets done with it remains to be judged on the basis of what is
produced by the spending of, which seems like a very false sort of
objectivity - where did the money come from?  Who is the spending of it for
- will we be living under a certain kind of roof or umbrella because of it?
Or the really Big question, who is money for?  If

for all, then how come so many have far less than those who have more?  Or
did I answer my own question with the word that comes just now to mind,
scarcity?  The idea that there's only so much of anything, and no more
beyond than what can be taken, legally or not, from those who would so
easily or unknowingly let it go.  Strange,

I agree, valorization running parallel to legal increment so that in some
end, nothing will be free.  & ONLY nothing.

S E

ps, strange, too, to find this addendum, written to a longer initial
response, appearing on the List, while the first pc didn't ... is that
censorship or just plain ineffectual smarts before the blinking panel?

,,i agree with the above, but at least if one "gave" in this cause it
wouldn't be to get through the eye of the needle, maybe some situation can
be put in place where writers who suddenly are found to be in real need

To all:
The publication idea is great.  The readings idea is also a good one, but
they're physically tiring and unless they pay really well, the 10-14 hour
flight from Japan, consequent jet lag, etc. would probably not be worth it.
He said as much when the idea was brought up in the past.  Cid has been
poet-in-residence at Iowa, and other places, and taught for one summer at
Naropa.  A residency would probably be more attractive to him, simply
because it would be less wearing.

Cid is certainly capable of speaking for himself, and does have access to
e-mail.  I forwarded the information to him about joining this list, but I
don't think he is comfortable enough with the technology to do it.

His e-mail address is available back channel to anyone who has any ideas,
leads. etc.  I'd be happy to give it out (Cid's given his ok on this), Mr.
Philips also has it, and he is, I believe, in the process of joining this
list.  Happy, too, to give out his snail mail address to anyone who requests
it.

Todd's welcome to contact Cid Corman directly because I doubt if he will
ever chime in.

Happy to say that there has already been a helpful response generated from
this list, but more people need to act.  My advice: there's no need to
wrangle: do what you can.  If you value Cid Corman's 50 years plus
dedication to the work; if you value Cid Corman as a person, please help.
Someday you may find yourself in his position.  Jesse

David,
A minor correction: Dale Smith's "Arabia Felix" (a terrific short read, I
agree) doesn't detail a trip through Ethiopia, as his mention of "Mike's
Ethiopian cafe" might suggest.  Rather, the mention of "al-Tihama" and
"Shara Sana'a" (Sana'a Street) indicate the trip is through Yemen, Sana'a
being its capital, & the Tihama, a range of mountains there.  Also, chewing
"qat" - a leaf that gives a mild sensation of relaxation & heightened
awareness - is something of a national pasttime in Yemen, complete with
late-morning last-minute bargaining at open markets for a big bunch of the
stuff at a good price, to provide a decent means for passing the afternoon
and evening.  Ie., the good life.  Dale in fact shld send a few copies to
Mike's Ethiopian Cafe, just so they'll know that he noticed them there while
THERE, as well as there later, from here.
Best,
Stephen Ellis

As a person who knows Steve if he, of all working class people, is
willing to donate a jackson to the project that says a lot. Or even some
time--

Ideological socialist talk won't put the onions on the plate.
Re-emphasis of the "not me" ideology didn't work in the reagonomic
period, why should it now?  Shoot up or shut up.

While I would have the ability to put a selected together, and some of
the funds, the time is the main problem here-- no time to put together a
benefit-- or the manuscript-- too much on the dinner plate & only one
intern. The Perchik collected will be out late cause of time. If someone
typed up a manuscript version into e-mail so I could throw it into
Quark, I'd be willing. Most of Cid's work would need to be culled from
non-electronic sources, the Elizabeth press books, and with Si's work it
has been slow going at best. The Morterstag books are beautiful but the
paper creates so many scanning errors it is unreal. I'd rather see it
get out on the Maine series if Burton is out there. Jesse feel free to
pass along the word...

St. Marks buys copies of all Sun & Moon and
Green Integer titles. However, they only purchase
1 or 2 copies, and these, of course, are immediately
sold. Consequently, it probably is almost impossible
to find our poetry there. If only they could be encouraged
to immediately reorder. I think it's important that customers
speak to the buyers and request a reorder. That is the only
way bookstores will change their patterns.

Here is the latest news, from John Phillips for anyone wishing to help Cid
if possible:


Dear Burt

  I said I'd get in touch soon as I had more information on how to send
  Cid some help. Have been hoping a collection point in the US would be
  set up, but no go as yet. And since I had word from Cid today saying if
  anyone wishes to help they shouldn't wait, that things are bad - now -
  here goes.

  As said, a cheque isn't that good for anything under $500 (due to $35
  charged for cashing).  The best method is to transfer cash ( yen if
  possible) direct to his bank. ( You have the address / details. [i.e.,
from a previous message: banking details, which he tells me is good for
"dollar, yen, or check transfers": Cid Corman c/o Kyoto Shinyo Kinko Bank,
Omuro Branch, Omuro Ukyo-ku, Kyoto 616-8208 Japan; account number:
095-0010328; bank tel: (075) 462-9670.] )

For smaller amounts sending cash in perhaps a registered envelope / hidden
by carbon paper + Cid's details should do it.

So, if you pass word around to anyone, that's what's to be passed.

Hope you're well

UMBRELLAS

     Umbrellas are guns in dress. Fold up your
umbrella & face up to your death. Surrender
your crown & fold it, dirty laundered. Making
love to chickenshit authority in one way & using
your head to make of it. Falling in love with the
magazines. What mistake can we live with now
& nothing else shall we fall prey to or pray to
misgivings, shielded by a bubble of slave & wonder
who is who. Who knows a truth seeks themselves
in others & applies it through failures. Umbrellas
are encasements, reverse caskets, eyeballs in
inverted wastepaper baskets.

I had resoved not to get any more entangled in this.... (i have
back-channeled several folks for that reason.) Better to talk more
directly about poetry and poetix (i have more than once in the past 3
years been cited by others for dragging the list pretty far into social
and political issues...for all that many listians agree that these things
are not totally separable from poetix..)

But this is so pointedly addressed to me, maybe i should respond..

Five dollars, or 20 dollars, from everyone on the List, would be a stopgap
for most families i know who are struggling with very tough economic
circumstances.

If we lived in a different kind of society, cid corman and family (and
various acquaintances of mine, and plenty of folks i don't personally
know) would not be in the specific conditions they are in.

If i understand the post quoted below, (i'm not sure i do) i can certainly
offer a *public* suggestion of political and social formations that could
use 5 or 20 dollars from each of us.  By opposing capitalism, or at least
its worst excesses, they are trying to alter the circumstances we have
been talking about. (..main problem with these groups is, they are too
eager to integrate themselves into "respectable" society, and often are
not opposed to capitalist society as such..reformism always finds its way
into a cul-de-sac; but we have to work with what we have)

Giving money to specific individuals who need it is a good thing and i
don't oppose it..If you can afford it, as many can't, by all means i
encourage list members to do it.  But if we are talking about being
non-secret about money....i believe people's money is more generative if
used to further political struggle.

Subject:      Press Release: Alan Sondheim - New trAce Virtual
              Writer-in-Residence (fwd)
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=X-UNKNOWN

ALAN SONDHEIM
http://trace.ntu.ac.uk/writers/sondheim/

=20
Brooklyn-based cyber-theorist Alan Sondheim is the latest writer to join
the growing band at the trAce Online Writing Community
http://trace.ntu.ac.uk


He is taking up the virtual baton from trAce's first Virtual
Writer-in-Residence Christy Sheffield Sanford, and will be available on
the site until March 2000.


Sondheim is a poet, critic, and theorist who writes on and about the
Internet. His books include Disorders of the Real, and the anthology Being
on Line, and during his time with trAce he will be working on a series of
collaborative pieces including 'Love and War and Jennifer' as well as
running a group of other online projects and conferences on topics like
programming code, avatars, cyborgs and experimental writing.


In 'Love and War and Jennifer' he urges writers to get involved. "Add your
own segments to the story backbone, or add your own webpages on the theme.
I imagine a huge accumulation of texts grounding this millennium in the
next, working and reading and creating new experiences on the way."


Alan is enthusiastic about his new post with trAce. He says "I'm extremely
excited to work in an environment that is in the forefront of online
culture. The opportunity to work with writers and artists engaged in
cultural activity around the world is incredible and amazing to me."


Director of trAce, novelist Sue Thomas, is delighted that Alan will be
working on the site. "Alan Sondheim lives at the sharp edge of
cyberculture today. He digs deep into the net and is never afraid to
confront some of the most profound psychological challenges the web can
sum up. I'm sure trAce writers will find it fascinating to join him in his
explorations."


BACKGROUND In 1997 trAce received an Arts Council of England 'Arts for
Everyone' Award of =A3365,000 to establish this online community for writer=
s
and readers in real and virtual space, and since then the organisation has
attracted attention from around the world. Its most successful ventures to
date include:

Burt,

John in his latest letter says that we have Corman's address, but I can't
find it in the archive.  For everyone's benefit, would you please repost
that information?

Thanks

Actually, what you're voicing is a middle class value.  Working class
people (at least the ones I was raised around) are very open about
money, how much they make, how much they spend for things.  Often
they speak about these things with great vigor.  *Not* to ask about
money (or to talk about my own money situation) was something I
learned when I got involved in the San Francisco poetry scene.  It's
still hard, like not announcing to everybody how much my shoes cost.

                           RECEPTION THURSDAY SEPTEMBER 9, 6-8

                        Gallery hours: Tuesday - Saturday, 11 - 6


        Off The Grid, a multi-media, action and process based exhibition by
Joshua Selman opens September 9th at Lance Fung Gallery. Mr. Selman has
shown repeatedly with Lance Fung Gallery since its opening year. Off The
Grid includes a sonic event made from mutilated electric guitars and other
live, sound emitting devices planted in soil, salt, ice, wood or other
naturally occurring substances. The amplified planting is performed at the
opening reception and sends off a beautiful sound event capturing such
sonic details as friction between organic materials and disturbances
between electronic objects planted within them.

        Set off from the planting, a floor installation of a twenty foot
triangular lattice made from cut pine trees is up-ended over soil, minerals
and other natural deposits. Along a tradition first associated with artists
like Smithson or Long, the artist has collected the cuttings at a chosen
site and recontexted them in the gallery. The triangular pine structure
combines with a two hundred square foot wall installation showing hundreds
of color prints made with samples of rotting wood from infested trees,
lichen feeding on living evergreens, bark dust, tree roots, moss and other
by-products of a decaying forest put directly on the glass bed of a
computer scanner for output. As duo-tones, the prints unify in rough color
bands: brown-green-red-yellow and blue. The loosely arranged color bands
unite as a singular horizon view.

        Conceptually, the exhibit's focus is on the process of roaming
between rural, urban and electronic terrains. About Off The Grid, Mr.
Selman says "These days they're re-cabling the entire planet. You feel a
de-stabilizing effect. But, this anticipates our journey. We're roaming
within structures more flexible than the prefabricated urban container." A
slightly different definition, "off the grid" is a term used today by a
growing segment of the population attempting to sever its dependence on the
support grid behind industrial civilization. The cult lifestyle has even
made its own industry of products for living off the grid. Whether or not
this is possible, a growing human desire to go beyond the reduction of all
phenomena to elements within a material grid seems to be timely. Mr. Selman
admits he feels centering in the urban grid is obsolete and, in the
exhibit, draws from his own desire to expand beyond its domain.

        His previous project, Full Message, exhibited at Lance Fung Gallery
in Spring of '98, is documented in K=FCnstforum and K=F6lner Arts Magazine.
Pieces from Full Message were collected and displayed by The Whitney Museum
Of American Art, The Ultimate Akademie, K=F6ln and The Artists Project,
Berlin. Also in '98, Mr. Selman was included in The Malsch Exhibition,
Munich and The Concrete Signal, York, Pennsylvania. Upcoming exhibitions of
=46ull Message are at The Museum Of Contemporary Art, Lake Worth, Florida an=
d
The Triton Museum, California. He has works with The Stamp Collection, New
York, The Artists Museum, Tel Aviv, Vanguard Visions, New York and was
commissioned in '98 by Australian Broadcast Corporation to make a radio
work at The Bridge, Construction In Process, Melbourne, Australia as a
participating artist. A national broadcast takes place in September '99.

                  "How It Sometimes Goes In Kangaroo Land"

                              Solo Exhibition

     9 September - 2 October 1999 at Emily Harvey Gallery, 537 Broadway, NYC
        Reception for the artist: Thursday, 9 September, 6-8 PM
                   Gallery hours: Tuesday - Saturday, 11 - 6


Emily Harvey is proud to present a solo exhibition by Jessica Higgins titled
How It Sometimes Goes In Kangaroo Land. The exhibition opens Thursday,
September 9th. Emily Harvey Gallery is the main American gallery
representing such vintage Fluxus artists as Alison Knowles, Emmett
Williams, Philip Corner, and the late Dick Higgins.

How It Sometimes Goes In Kangaroo Land is based on a pattern poem titled
Long Tail For Jessie. Published in Dick Higgins' classic 1979 book, Some
Recent Snow Flakes, it was inspired by a telephone conversation in which
=0BMs. Higgins told her father "and that's how it sometimes goes in Kangaroo
Land." Her exhibition opens a window to the private world this artist
shared with her father.

The installation includes white cloth chairs suspended or placed on
platforms. On the chairs Ms. Higgins has screen-printed correspondence and
pattern poems including the poem Long Tail For Jessie. The prints magnify
texts and transform the chairs into pages torn from a book. Mimicking
mammal forms, the chairs play on the idea of materialized nonsense
characteristic of a tradition that extends from the work of Lewis Carroll
through works from the Fluxus family into which Jessica Higgins was born.

Additionally, Ms. Higgins has used the title How it Sometimes Goes In
Kangaroo Land, as the basis of a thousand page anagrammatic text. All one
thousand pages are presented along with pages she chose to put through a
blue print machine and output as six foot scrolls of white text on blue
ground.

Jessica Higgins' previous solo exhibition titled Riddles  was presented at
Lance Fung Gallery in Spring 1998.

> > > > Synopsis: The 12hr-ISBN-JPEG Project began December 30, 1994. A
`round-the-clock posting of sequenced hypermodern imagery from Brad Brace.
The hypermodern minimizes the familiar, the known, the recognizable; it
suspends identity, relations and history. This discourse, far from
determining the locus in which it speaks, is avoiding the ground on which
it could find support. It is trying to operate a decentering that leaves
no privilege to any center.


                        The 12-hour ISBN JPEG Project
                        -----------------------------
                           began December 30, 1994


   Pointless Hypermodern Imagery... posted/mailed every 12 hours... a
spectral, trajective alignment for the 90`s! A continuum of minimalist
masks in the face of catastrophe; conjuring up transformative metaphors
for the everyday... A poetic reversibility of exclusive events...

         A post-rhetorical, continuous, apparently random sequence of
imagery...  genuine gritty, greyscale...  corruptable, compact,
collectable and compelling convergence. The voluptuousness of the grey
imminence: the art of making the other disappear. Continual visual impact;
filled with the density of an invisible knowledge; an optical drumming,
sculpted in duration, on the endless present of the Net.

   An extension of the printed ISBN-Book (0-9690745) series... critically
unassimilable... imagery is gradually acquired, selected and re-sequenced
over time...  ineluctable, vertiginous connections. The 12hr dialtone...

                               [ see ftp.netcom.com/pub/bb/bbrace/books ]

KEYWORDS: >> Disconnected, disjunctive, distended, de-centered,
    de-composed, ambiguous, augmented, ambilavent, homogeneous, reckless...

         Every 12 hours, another!...  view them, re-post `em, save `em,
trade `em, print `em, even publish them... The design of the Net assumes
that intellectual property is technically and socially obsolete.

~ This interminable, relentless sequence of imagery began in earnest on
December 30, 1994. The basic structure of the project has been over
twenty-four years in the making. While the specific sequence of
photographs has been presently orchestrated for more than 12 years` worth
of 12-hour postings, I will undoubtedly be tempted to tweak the ongoing
publication with additional new interjected imagery. Each 12-hour posting
is like the turning of a page; providing ample time for reflection,
interruption, and assimilation.

I want to mention here, again, sorry for the repetition, that we've set up
a space for textual experimentation re: a 'novel' or accumulation, at
http://trace.ntu.ac.uk/writers/sondheim/index.htm based on Jennifer and
any others one might care to contribute - there are five backbone webpages
- you can add to any of them and/or add your own webpage (contact me on
that) -

Also on LinguaMoo we've established a space to write/into dealing with
avatars, you can publicly @dig there, at the Grove (down from trAce) - you
have to join Lingua, that's all -

Please participate in these, at least check them out, if you have the time
- there are also those conferences on the Webboard - you join by going
through http://trace.ntu.ac.uk - devoted to experimental writing, cyborg
and avatar issues, etc. -

Dear Douglas Messerli,

Ah, interesting.  I have often enough wondered why St
Marks does so poorly on stocking varieties of poetry
that they really should have on the shelves. The readers
of these books are certainly often in the place. A while
back, I was in there and grabbed a copy of Ron Silliman's
Xing.  At the register, it turned out that Xing is read
by the machine as a command to cancel the transaction,
so I stood there while the person behind the counter tried
again and again to get the register to accept this
string as the title of the book. They finally sold it
to me without entering the title into what I suppose
is an inventory -- so they probably haven't re-ordered it
either.

Best
Michael Walsh

I didn't know if he was part of a writer's group. But if you step off at
Metro Sherbrooke, you can head towards rue Laval, where he lived, and
did most of his
writing, I think. On the way, there's a a Quebec Poets and Writers Assn.
on rue Laval at the head of a park called Carre St. Louis, and they
might be able to direct you somewhere. Failing that, Nelligan's picture
is in most of the French-Language bookstores (many on rue St. Denis),
and the people there, if knowledgeable, might give you an assist.

Yr right, working class people often DO have more openness re: money.  But
that's pretty much an urban thing.  In fact the whole notion of "working
class" is urban; Marx didn't farm, and shuddered at the fact of living in a
rural setting.  There are plenty of provincial mutes who don't have much to
say about money or anything else.  I find that whole hierarchy of working,
middle, upper class

to be over simple.  Isn't it more like some kind of daisy chain in wch all
participate, even if often enough against their will?  And don't you think
the "openness" in the working classes toward discussing fiscal matters is
sometimes contingent on the feeling that they've been "had" - that's
something I've noticed, openness seeming a way to bear up under constant
(fiscal & emotional) strain, if not outright (temporal & spatial) abuse.
Wch is, okay, not always the case, but

to invoke the openness you speak of without mentioning the perpetual grind
being under image to priviledge (ie., something to work toward, like getting
a disease) is to keep intent separate from the occasional desperation behind
it.  Conditions have contexts & causes, middle class is it may be to point
this (if not them) out.

In response to David Highsmith's question, Philip Whalen has been in the
hospital for over a week with a bacterial infection which started in his
leg. Though of course he's been quite sick, he's not in danger and when
visited was even in a humorous mood. He missed the group reading at Fort
Mason that was held for his book OVERTIME. -- Leslie Scalapino

=46rom Ralph Linton, _The Study of Man_ (1936):

"Our solid American citizen awakes in a bed built on a pattern which
originated in the Near East...He throws back covers made from cotton,
domesticated in India, or linen, domesticated in the Near East, or wool
from sheep, also domesticated in the Near East, or silk, the use of which
was discovered in China...He takes off his pajamas, a garment invented in
India, and washes with soap in invented by the ancient Gauls.  He then
shaves, a masochistic rite which seems to have been derived from either
Sumer or ancient Egypt...Before going out for breakfast he glances thru the
window, made of glass invented in Egypt, and if it is raining puts on
overshoes made of rubber discovered by the Central American Indians and
takes an umbrella, invented in southeastern Asia.  Upon his head he puts a
hat made of felt, a material invented in the Asiatic steppes.

On his way to breakfast he stops to buy a paper, paying for it with coins,
an ancient Lydian invention.  At the restaurant a whole new series of
borrowed elements confronts him.  His plate is made of a form of pottery
invented in China.  His knife is of steel, an alloy first made in southern
India, his fork a medieval Italian invention, and his spoon a derivative of
a Roman origin...After his fruit and first coffee he goes on to waffles,
cakes made by a Scandinavian technique from wheat domesticated in Asia
Minor.  Over these he pours maple syrup, invented by the Indians of the
Eastern woodlands.  As a side dish he may have the egg of a species of bird
domesticated in Indo-China, or thin strips of the flesh of an animal
domesticated in Eastern Asia which have been salted and smoked by a process
developed in Northern Europe.

When our friend has finished eating he settles back to smoke, an American
Indian habit, consuming a plant domesticated in Brazil in either a pipe,
derived from the Indians of Virgina or a cigarette, derived from
Mexico...While smoking he reads the news of the day, imprinted in
characters invented by the ancient Semites upon a material invented in
China by a process invented in Germany [Linton shd have sd Chos=F4n
(present-day Korea)].  As he absorbs the accounts of foreign troubles he
will if he is a good conservative citizen, thank a Hebrew deity in an
Indo-European language that he is 100 per cent American."

Millennium Project - Help Needed, Comments Invited !!!


This is a proposal for a millennium project that would involving running
traceroute and similar applications across the December 31 / January 1
_hinge._

Traceroute is a linux / unix command that can also be downloaded as a
small application for Windows; the command-line (prompt) startup is:

{k:1} traceroute <address> - for example
{k:2} traceroute cleo.murdoch.edu.au

Traceroute then executes a series of internet packet transmissions that
target each router between one's local site and the address; each target
is usually hit three times. The send-and-return time for each router is
then given to the user. The result is a table or textual map of the health
of the route between the local and final address; if a router is down or
not responding, that is clear from the * in place of the send-and-return
time. Here is an example:

{k:110}traceroute cleo.murdoch.edu.au >> zz
traceroute to cleo.murdoch.edu.au (134.115.224.60), 30 hops max, 40 byte

All of the intermediate routers between the local address (my desktop com-
puter routed through panix.com) and cleo.murdoch.edu.au are listed in
order; the IP address is given after the name, and then three times are
listed for every address.

What I propose is a skein or matrix of traceroutes run all around the
world - not just from major cities - sites - at the time of the millennial
turnover hinge. Participants could run one or several traceroutes; the
results would be sent to me or a trAce site via standard email, and
assembled. (It may be possible to create a visualization, but the cost of
this seems prohibitive.)

The result would give a map of some of the world's nerves as Y2K comes to
fruition; it would be a unique and historic signature or imprint of the
passing of an era (marked by B.C./A.D. or b.c.e. a.c.e. common time - I'm
well aware of alternative date systems). The text would be a world-text, a
self-reflexive look at the Net by the Net, data-crawling everywhere. One
site might not have traceroute running at all; another might connect just
as easily as usual.

A major problem is that almost no one will be around for the hinge (and
don't forget the hinge itself will take a day to travel the world). The
computers would most like be set up (if unix or linux) with the at or cron
commands, which automate task running at particular times; if they connect
to the Net, they'd also have to ensure that the ISP connection remains
open. All of these are difficult problems; one solution would be to
_actively_ make connections when the participant's local address is not on
the hinge - but to target hinge addresses.

Any help or suggestions will be greatly appreciated. trAce (Sue Thomas)
and I have tried to find programming help on this, but so far it appears
costly. Martin Dodge at Cybergeography has been thinking along similar
lines, but nothing is firmed up there, either.

**SMALL PRESS TRAFFIC READING **

Mike Amnasan
Elizabeth Robinson
Friday, September 10, 7:30 p.m.


Mike Amnasan's novel I Can't Distinguish Opposites (1988, Black Star
Series), and its unpublished sequel, Joe Liar, were two of the most
important works to come out of San Francisco's "New Narrative" school of
the 1980s, arriving like a pair of thunderclaps across a livid purple sky
of politics, sex, genre-bending, labor writing, memoir, and deconstruction.
Amnasan is the author as well of a full-length play, Revery, and the editor
of the controversial literary/sociological journal Ottotole (1985-1989).
This year he won the Sheet Metal Workers Local 104 College Scholarship
Award to study literature at San Francisco State University. Born in Pasco
(Washington), he will be reading tonight from a memoir-in-progress, Beyond
the Safety of Dreams.

For many, Elizabeth Robinson epitomizes the latest version of the new
American poetry, for her writing is well known for its lyric abstraction,
its spiritual depth, its finesse of experiment, and elegant individualism.
Often overlooked are the Rabelaisian undertones, for here is a poetry in
love with life, eros, and comedy high and low. Robinson's books include: In
the Sequence of Falling Things (paradigm) and Bed of Lists (Kelsey St.
Press), and seven chapbooks from publishers around the world. Forthcoming,
a new book from Kelsey St. Press (The Seed for Bread), and a chapbook
(Lodger) from Arcturus Editions. Her poems and critical writing have
appeared in Oblek, The Germ, Epoch, First Intensity, Hambone, 6ix, Fence,
American Letters and Commentary, Fourteen Hills.

I wouldn't be so quick to consign this as "urban" phenomena. (In fact in the
decidedly rural, decidedly working class place where my people are, and
where I grew up, openness about fiscal matters, including the family's
struggle to pay bills and ward off overdrafts at the bank, was the norm. I
think that working class kids are often not sheltered from such events.)
But I think that Dodie Bellamy is pointing out the middle class tendency
toward a *false* politeness in which "we don't discuss things like that."
This contirbutes toward an environment in which we pretend that privilege
doesn't exist ("oh really we're all the same; we're all just poets"). And to
point out that that is in fact false is perceived as impolite, or worse yet
as complaining, whining, or "bitching." In fact, in a recent forum on class
& poetics which I edited and organized with Robin Tremblay-McGaw, working
class folks were reluctant to speak for the very reason that they would be
labelled as such ("oh, quit you're complaining, etc.) But there's a helluva
lot of interesting work to be done on class & literature, and it is
imperative that working class folks be part of that discussion.

As a poet, I have been on strike for the past 3 weeks because the
dishonourable governor of our state continues to disrespect poets and poetry
in general by not appointing a State Poet Laureate when it is the governor's
responsibility to have done so after the last poet laureate's term expired.

If you wish to support the wildcat poetry strike you may do so by
immediately placing a CANCEL on any vacation plans to a state not civilised
enough to have a Poet Laureate!

Hi evvy,

Very good point.  Let me one of the first to apologize to everyone.  I
know I have been very busy working on other things, that I have neglected
to participate.

I hope to more accessible in the future.

Because the dishonourable governor has such a low regard for poets and by
implication performing artists of every genre, please tell all your
influential friends in LA not to vacation or film any more movies in this
uncouth state...

Shit, CA doesn't have one, last I checked.

I nominate Alan Kaufman from the list.

But hey, in LA, the chief value is not to get too excited about

It would be troublesome for you and/or the multitude of poet/friends of
yours to make other arrangements for skiing this year, but if you wish to
support the wildcat poetry strike you may do so simply by clicking "Reply to

As a poet, I have been on strike for the past 3 weeks because the
dishonourable governor of our state continues to disrespect poets and poetry
in general by not appointing a State Poet Laureate when it is the governor's
responsibility to have done so after the last poet laureate's term expired.

If you wish to support the wildcat poetry strike you may do so by
immediately placing a CANCEL on any vacation plans to a state not civilised
enough to have a Poet Laureate!

Hi evvy,

Very good point.  Let me one of the first to apologize to everyone.  I
know I have been very busy working on other things, that I have neglected
to participate.

I hope to more accessible in the future.

Every concerned poet expresses regret that any tourist would choose to
cancel plans to vacation in the state during the upcoming ski season; but if
you so choose to support the wildcat poetry strike, you may do so by
removing any investment you have in the state immediately by clicking "Reply
to All" with 1 word:  REMOVE

                 PLEASE NOTE WE HAVE HAD TO CHANGE THE DATE:
                         Saturday, November 6, 1999
               University Center, Loyola University, New Orleans

2:00 PM:  A Symposium on the Southern, the Regional, the Experimental
8:00 PM:  Readings by Contributors to An Other South, New Orleans Review
25-1

Please help us celebrate the publication of this exciting issue of New
Orleans Review. All contributors are invited to read, and everyone is
invited to attend. Please reply to this email if you would like to attend
and need help finding a place to stay in New Orleans, or if you have any
other questions. There will be no charge for any of the events.

The Symposium:  All interested parties are invited to submit proposals
for short presentations; the presentations may be in any form, from a
simple essay to a multi-person performance or audio/visual extravaganza,
but may not exceed ten minutes in length. Topics should be within the
range of issues raised by this issue of New Orleans Review, "An Other
South: Experimental Writing in the South." Possible broad topics might
include (though certainly not be limited to):

What is an Experiment? Is the term still valid, or has "the Experimental"
become just another genre?
What is a region? What is the relationship of geographical boundaries
(like "the South") with contemporary poetry?
What literary traditions (ie, Language, post-Language, surrealism,
Modernism, etc.) and/or individual writers are of interest for the
current Southern literary scene?
What are the political and cannonical implications of experimentation in
the South?

This list is not intended to be exhaustive, nor even extensive. Please
feel free to suggest your own topics, to combine or divide any of the
suggestions.

Please submit proposals as soon as possible- no later than October 20.
Submit via email or ground mail to:

i don't have to do this
can i challenge that can i

that this is the needed thing
in this moment ?  no
but i wd prefer that this verse
not change the world
what cd such a world offer ?
but i claim poetry   challengers
i stand at the top of the mountain

and i doubt you will honor

how else will you fail me reader?

 "Because for a poet writing is a daily preoccupation, I am interested in
 other daily habits too - the ones we create for ourselves and especially
 the ones we are somehow forced to assume in order to participate in what
 we call our society or our culture.... Money - the ubiquitous abstraction
 - is the daily habit I'm playing with in all these poems. For about a
 year and a half now, I've been writing down my daily purchases. At some
 point, I decided that I would rigorously document every dollar spent
 in 1999, and use those purchases as the formal spine of my poetic forms."
                        --Shawn Lynn Walker, from a general description
                        of her "money" project

LoveandWar

This is a beginning/interim report on the loveandwar site, some observa-
tions -

The site's developing rapidly; there are a large number of texts on it,
some of which are interactive, and many of which use html and flash tags.
Because of the nature of the forms input, some texts 'take' and some
don't. The stories are developing in unforeseen directions; the texts have
an amazing splintered intensity. Because email addresses and names aren't
checked, these inputs also become sites for experiment; many of the add-
resses form part of the text, and click to nowhere.

I worry that we may not have the critical mass to sustain beyond the first
two weeks - during which there is of course a degree of novelty. I welcome
any suggestions concerning new directions we might proceed in - one thing
would be to put up participants' webpages which relate, however distantly,
to the story-lines.

Meanwhile the five backbones are worked as a palimpsest; texts are hung
salon-style within them, each author holding hir own. _Jump_ tags placed
among the texts move laterally from one backbone to another; anyone can
add these tags, ringing around them. If additional webpages are added,
these too could be linked by jumping.

The characters have been killed, abandoned, splintered as well - they're
digital, virtual idols, they constantly return, since death is meaning-
less; once there is a demarcation (say, with Webbie Tookay, with Kyoko
Date, with Jennifer, with Cybele, with Alan), there is a frame for con-
tinued additions. It is for this reason I wrote, before this project, that
_Jennifer has all the time in the world_ - since she inhabits files, pro-
tocols, applications, 'locally' and across the Net - an inhabitation that
remains constant, no matter what events. In fact, with virtual idols, ava-
tars, emanants, _events are absorbed_ into a generalized diegesis created
by readings, rereadings, misreadings; there are no occurrences whatsoever.

Virtual idols as well can be thought of as _resonances,_ or _reverbera-
tions_ among sheaves of files - by this I mean that their (proper) names

other - it is this _skein_ that constitutes appearance, fiction, narra-
tive, no matter how wildly disparate the individuated texts or files ap-
pear to be. This might be considered itself a new occurrence in fiction,
related to cutups, the novels of Richardson and Sterne, Wittgenstein's
anecdotal philosophies, the Romantic fragments of the Atheneum, etc. - to
mention a few of the older sources.

The overwhelming majority of replies are for the wildcat poetry strike to
continue
until the dishonourable governor shows the respect to poets that the
vocation of
poetry deserves by upholding the constitutionally mandated responsibility of
the
office of governor to appoint the next State Poet Laureate upon the
expiration
of the incumbent state poet laureate's proscribed term.

Hopefully this deplorable state of personal sacrifice will end sooner than
later
with one rectifying swish of the pen in the governor's recalcitrant hand;
but until
then, all that can be done whether or not you support the "pen down" civil
action
is to immediately click "Reply to All" with the unswerving demand:  REMOVE!

i.e. the Governor.

Please remove my name from these mailings.  I doubt that anyone cares
whether poets strike or not.  Also, I can't see how denying myself any
pleasure I might take from a tourist type activity would make any impact on
the people involved.

I agree that it is regrettable that Governor Sheehan has not appointed a
poet laureate, but I doubt that the actions you propose will incite her to
act any more quickly.  I have respect for your passion in this matter and
for the time and energy you are putting into it.  However, I do not wish to
be part of it.

Sincerely,

I just had to share this with you:
==================================
From the newsroom of the BBC World Service
Thursday, July 29, 1999 Published at 08:17 GMT 09:17 UK
World: Europe

Russian soldier poet

The Russian officer in charge of relations with NATO, General Leonid
Ivashov, has been accepted as a member of the Russian Writers' Union.

General Ivashov, who is a poet, told the armed forces newspaper Krasnaya
Zvezda that the image of officers as people with limited intellectual
development did not reflect reality.

He said he tried to use every spare minute to write poetry -- on flights,
waiting at the airport and in cars.

Dear listmembers:

first three chapbooks:

Diaeresis Chapbook Number 4:

BILL BURMEISTER, The Gunner's Daughter:  A Verse Play

        Burmeister reinvents the Greek drama as a dark Boys in the Hall
farce; Diana and Actaeon are retold in twenty-first century vulgate;
American Pie, scripted by Pierre Klossowski under the spell of Zukofsky's
"A"-21.

Diaeresis Chapbook Number 3:

C.S. GISCOMBE, Two Sections from Practical Geography

        "C.S. Giscombe has opened up new territory, where we've least
expected it, seeking the roots of identity in a poetics that is literally
projective:  across cultures, centuries, races." --Ron Silliman on
Giscombe's _Giscome Road_ (1998)

Diaeresis Chapbook Number 2:

E. A. MILLER, The Underbrush of Abundance

        Miller is the author of _Eight Poems_ (1991) and has work in

Abundance_ is a cosmopolitan, terrorist, lyrically repetitive poem in
twenty-six sections.

Diaeresis Chapbook Number 1:

HANK LAZER, As It Is

        "Honesty is the best policy--in poetry as in all else.  These apt,
reductive verses keep a locus of faith with skill and moving commitment.
Keep 'em coming!" --Robert Creeley on _As It Is_

ordered for $10; all four for $12.  Please make checks payable to Mark

Back in 1988 I met Joseph Keppler in Victoria BC, where I was then
producing a literary radio program called FINE LINES at CFUV FM that
aired on 15 campus/community stations across Canada. I produced a couple
of radio shows on his work, one of which I have just put up as the first
content available on the new Vispo Audio page. I'm proud to have some of
Joe's work up as the first audio available at Vispo.

A lot has changed since I produced those shows, but listening to the
Keppler shows now, they still sound pretty good. He's an amazing poet,
doing very different work now than what is on the 1988 show. This show,
which is an hour long broken into two half hour real audio files,
features work of Keppler from the eighties--he's legendary around here
for his readings--very sound, and commentary by Trudy Mercer, Stephen
Thomas, and Carl Diltz on Keppler's work.

Regards,
Jim Andrews

I reminded of my 2 Rivers model of life:  one slogs away with a foot in a
river of honey and a foot in a river of shit.  Sometimes the aromas are
distinct.  Sometimes they are as one.

As of today, the Poetry Project is open again after a long and lovely
summer of, as poet Sharon Mesmer puts it: "writing, reading, napping,
reading, writing, napping, snacking, reading, snacking, reading,
snacking, reading."

Other announcements: In July a great bolt of lightening struck St. Mark's
Church, frying our telephones, answering machine, and modems. That's why
many of you were unable to contact us through August. We're happy to
report that we are once again accessible, phoneable, e-mailable, etc.

And speaking of being on-line, there's a new assortment of work in "Poets
& Poems" by

Mary Burger
Garrett Caples
Theodore Enslin
Wendy Rose
Jonathan Skinner

at http://www.poetryproject.com

with also an updated Calendar with the October readings and a special
reading on September 29th. The new workshop information is also on-line,
as well as an updated Tiny Press Center with at least half of all the
lovely publications that were sent to us this summer (the other half will
be going up over the course of this month). So enjoy!

Happy September,
The Poetry Project

Field Work

with Arnold J. Kemp & David Buuck

Headlands Center for the Arts
Thurs Sep 9 - 7:30 pm

Artists who practice outside of the aesthetic mainstream in a culture of
dwindling public funding for the arts are increasingly dependent on the various
communities - local, intellectual, political - that provide mutual support
networks for art and ideas.  Artist/Curator Arnold J. Kemp and writer/editor
David Buuck will discuss their own participation in the Bay Area communities and
national "scenes" within which they work. They will explore not only how their
individual work is affected by community, but also how working as a curator or
editor reflects another kind of involvement in the community-wide production of
art and culture.

Arnold J. Kemp is Associate Visual Arts Curator at Yerba Buena Center for the
Arts, as well as being a visual artist and writer. His most recent solo
exhibition was at ESP in San Francisco last year.

David Buuck co-edits Tripwire: a journal of poetics with Yedda Morrison. He is a
1999 Artist-in-Residence at the Headlands Center for the Arts. A new chapbook is
forthcoming from Melodeon Poetry Systems this fall.

Hypertext 2000 is the 11th in the premier international series of ACM
conferences on hypertext and hypermedia. The conference will provide a
forum where attendees can present, exchange and discuss original ideas
and
exciting experiences relating to hypermedia (objects, links, paths,
spaces, time, collections, navigational aids, etc) and the use of
hypermedia
concepts and technologies in special domains (e.g., authoring,
publishing,
human-computer interaction, digital libraries, electronic literature,
computer-supported co-operative work, databases, operating systems,
software engineering, education, global information systems such as the
WWW).

Hypertext 2000 will have a wide range of tracks and activities, with
submissions being invited in the categories of full papers, short
papers,

        It was not immediately apparent which state was in question.
Sifting thru further posts, one is able to discern it is none other than
Calif, my home state for 37 years, 37 years during which time I have never
known who the PL was, nor have I noticed any damage to poetry resulting
from this absence or, indeed, presence.

However, to allay all uneasiness, I am declaring myself California Poet
Laureate and asking you : what do poets need with a governor?

        Mina Loy's life is the stuff of drama.  Given her expatriate
experience, participation in the radical art movements of the early
twentieth century, and romance with the boxer/poet Arthur Cravan, it is not
surprising that her life has been recast in a work of fiction.
        It is disturbing to note, however, that Antonia Logue's novel
Shadow-Box (Bloomsbury, Grove/Atlantic, 1999) relies heavily on my
biography Becoming Modern, The Life of Mina Loy (Farrar, Straus & Giroux,
1996; U. of California P., 1997)--not only for historical facts but also
for overarching themes, treatment and interpretation of cultural milieux,
and in some cases, narrative structures.  A comparison of the two books
shows that while Logue sought to transform this material, her novel
piggy-backs on my work, often interweaving innovative parts of the
biography and presenting them as "fact."
        I have been advised that this use of my work is not in itself
actionable, but it nonetheless raises issues inherent in the genre of
novelization.  On Logue's behalf one could argue that since the publication
of Becoming Modern Mina Loy's life has entered the public domain.  Judging
by the stares of non-recognition that still greet me in bookshops, however,
such a claim is misleading.  When I began work on the biography twenty
years ago, she had been so thoroughly forgotten that most people thought I
was writing about the film star.  Since its publication critics have
recognized Becoming Modern as definitive.  As such it has a different
status from lives of figures like Gertrude Stein, Hemingway, or Pound,
about whom new biographies are written every decade: for this reason
Logue's appropriations are all the more salient.
Moreover, although she does credit Becoming Modern as one of two
"outstanding sources," this acknowledgement is misleading.  It suggests
only a partial recognition of a much greater indebtedness and could be
thought to imply some form of cooperation on my part.  While Logue appears
to have done no original research into the life of Mina Loy, relying
entirely upon the biography, I was never asked to lend my support to her
project.
        Excerpts from reviews of Shadow-Box (none of which mentions
Becoming Modern) partially demonstrate the nature of the appropriations:

thematic:

--the biography's major themes reappear as those of the novel: "the
conflicting forces at work in the first decades of the century; the
dynamism and energy of new movements in art and thought, as opposed to the
left-over Victorian propriety that traps the talented, intelligent Mina in
an early loveless marriage; forward-looking New York, where her first poems
are published and appreciated, versus stuck-in-the-past Europe" (Literary
Review)

intellectual and cultural milieux & forms:

-- While Becoming Modern is what made it possible for Logue to evoke the
lively artistic backgrounds, from Post-Impressionism to Futurism and Dada,
not to mention Loy's lovers and friends like Marinetti, Duchamp, and
Picabia, she is credited with original portrayals of "the intellectual
excitement and controversy surrounding the arts in the pre-WWI period,"
even with creating "witty and illuminating" glimpses of the period's
luminaries (Kirkus)--the details of which derive from my treatment of these
movements and figures.

some uses of specific details, settings, and structures:

To demonstrate the nature of Logue's borrowing, readers should compare the
following sections of each work:

Shadow-Box                                      Becoming Modern

pp. 28: Mina walking Oda in                     p. 96: detail based on my

                                                verisimilitude

p. 29: treatment of the name "Loy"              p. 97: interpretation of the
                                                fragmentary evidence

pp. 34-35: LeSavoureux story                    pp. 102-104: interpretation,
repeated as fact                                considered controversial by

                                                Mina Loy's family

pp. 95-98: presentation of                      pp. 151-153:  original
                material on Frances Stevens and                 research,
interpretation,
Italian Futurists                               and staging of scenes

pp. 99-102: narrative use of                    pp. 155-157:  original
                Futurist serata, Florence
        interpretation, staging of scene

pp. 110-111: Marinetti's trip to                pp. 171-172:

                                                based on fragmentary evidence

pp. 161-163: scene of Cravan                    pp. 263-265:  interpretation
leaving Salina Cruz                             and staging of material woven
                                                from diverse sources

pp. 168-176: Loy at Arensbergs',                pp. 212-223:  interpretation
relations with Duchamp, Williams,               & treatment of this group &

details
                                                of badinage with Duchamp

pp. 177-200: Cravan, Independents               pp.  223-233, 234-251, details,
structured in two parts, with Cravan story      interpretations & narrative
                starting on p. 182                              device of
highlighting Cravan
                                                story (my Ch. 11)

pp. 263-267: Salina Cruz scene, details         pp. 263-265, recreation
                of boat, communication system, role             of Cravan's
fate from disparate
of Bob Brown                                    sources including Brown

        Given my response to these uses of my biography, it is for someone
else to judge Shadow-Box.  Others will decide whether it transforms the
biographical materials, or whether it remains a derivative work penned, as
Jonathan Dee observes of recent novels based on the lives of writers,
"ostensibly as an act of homage, but also, not coincidentally, as a way of
grabbing up the genuine cachet. . . geniuses still deliver, in order to
enhance the value of one's own work." ("The Reanimators, Harper's, June
1999).
        It would also be instructive for Mina Loy enthusiasts to compare
Logue's novel with Albert Guerard's The Hotel in the Jungle (Baskerville,
1996), a work of imaginative fiction composed before my book appeared and
based on what was then known of the Loy/Cravan story.  Guerard made the
legend his own by creating a setting for their romance (the hotel) and a
group of characters who retrospectively piece together their story.
        While it is a pleasure to see novelists' creative transformations
of historical material (and there are many successful examples), Logue's
raises serious questions about literary method and publishing ethics.
Caveat lector, and may this brief account stimulate further discussion.

i would advise professor (?) burke to contact the National Writers' Union.
For the price of your tax deductible union dues, advice on grievance
procedures is yours for the asking.  it is very distressing when original
research that was conducted in relative oblivion and with liitle cultural
support is then appropriated as "common knowledge" about a subject; but it
also speaks to the influential nature of our work, and how invisible these
lines of influence are.  i'm glad to be alerted of this. i wish it weren't
so, but it happens all the time and should indeed be made matter for public
discussion.

Did I hallucinate, or did someone use the phrase "poetry as codependency"
on this list today? I can't remember in what connection, and for some
reason I can't find that message any more. I'm asking because,
mysteriously, I happen to have a very old prosepoem that has just that
title; I found it just the other day digging through some of my very olden
files. It's one of those weird coincidences that seem so hard to explain.
Here it is.

                        POETRY AS CODEPENDENCY

A bonny good time. Whatever the shelf will bear the mind will brook.
Vine-ripe, like sunsets in Virginia, thoughts. Allow me to pass the
dynamite. Patterns on north fabric fashion our bee-hivior. And cocktails of
toll coins along the route. And poetry, the typoed self. The demon of
velocity blood wrinkles. The Gag Hag Tabernacle. Professionalism is
analysis. Lo, the gossamer leads me! Aha, Lord Saintly! Joseph the Fox. Dry
as the chrysalis. The strangest of them all, the therapeutic. In delicate
playboyance, talking extreme sense. The chestered, dynamited. Goosage.
Goosage. I’m telling ya. Goosage. I’m telling ya. It’s goosage. The mind is
a disgusting thing. Vines have a climbing habit. We are responsible for the
provision of literature. I am John from Johntown, a Johntown John. I am Dr.
Lau, I work in intensive care. And then I realize that it’s mesquite
broiled. From the right nipple to the cleft: thoughts gone considerably
left. The road that makes a hill’s informal spine. Word knows the health of
the heath. Like a study in thief psychology. Improfound, fluxes across
reality the urgent origins of your sea-urchined brain. From Kennedy to
Normandy, that’s our now concept. Vary the parameters. What better time to
break the sad engagement? Nope. A clutch. Eyebrows and bitter filaments of
truth; we are but its cross-section, like a blooming crutch. Poetry is slow
a-going, but fast a-enjoying. Two stanzas for Kansas. Marx. Bingo, Two
Marks. Then the boys decided to go for a slice of slaughter. Unrelevant,
un-to-the-point. How best to subdivide your business cake. But above all we
remain as brothers, big as gold. Let us all have us a bonnie good time.
Allow me to pass the dynamite. Just kidding. A bonny good time. This wicked
code of codependency: an injured mutual unrequited love finds tiny profit
in truths about itself, and freedom scarcely camps on its doorstep. The
lovers, rather than mimicking the points of a shiny compass in
predetermined pirouetting, seem like a clumsy pair of reciprocal crutches
sloppily held together by bracing pity, tango-torqued to a broken rhythm
like elements in a slow-motion complicated cameo larger pratfall, but the
curtain refuses to deliver the coup de grace. For a week branches are
bullets, centering and ascending. A little car stops to pray at the red
light. The rift, elsehow, for I wishn’t of sorry pity to starry beauty.
Persiflage Mediterranean. Persiflage Manhattan. Getting a bizarreness
reaction from underground. Dirty coffee cups applaud, our lady of the
armadillo. Biting off more cake than money they can puke. Raddle
stichomythia. Robert Maria Paul Waltham. Hello, my name is Charles Cynthia
Davis. I have a hard time coping wi/ my thoughts. ’Ts like a general let’s
dance away our lives. And this span new, bang old, blues. I’ll try anything
once. feels // wrong. A sickness unto love. Thoughts of women’s thoughts. I
thaw an unprogress in endemic March. Nothing equals anything. Anything
equals nothing. The open-ended needle may yet hug the thread, but this
thick torn togetherness can’t be mended. Falsificatory realism on
industrial lips. And pauper the good guy. Wherein your lax justification
governs. To describe my condition, the letter arrived today: should I work
my sentences backwards, weave my tuna diagonally through the sands, yon
eucalypti and butts of floats prevaricate siderated, miled along the
newspaper? Thing is, round here they collapse perspective on Fridays,
crisscross with sap and savvy. The mind body/boutique. Superior
repercussions in a flimflam arboretum drive the bag gorge often away on
business. Cloying wallets flip transverse. I haven’t recounted them yet out
of me. I tried, but failed, seeing how the self ebbs, the butter mourns,
the basalt flies. All things have conspired to describe my condition: code
pendency is kleptomania.

Subject:      THE NEW ENGLAND POETRY SCENE
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

                        THE NEW ENGLAND POETRY SCENE

Read now of my poems from the book and since the book. I am, of course,
aware that the New England poetry scene is much rich with master upon
master upon master. I certainly recognize that as a possibility. But
eskoozme, although no Mayflower blood my veins suffuses, I claim title to
equal honorarium. Of human and inhuman bloods. But one must abandon
conventional notions if one wishes to form intellectually responsible
opinions about the nature of things. While I’m talking to you and you
listen to me, nothing matters to us except for poetry. The chalfting in my
knuckles with I like a text that I can put behind me. I’m doing my
sleepable best. Drapes vikram merdallion, again praddle and what you being
inslope leftwing of here is mindedly severed and glissome. Because zebeto
returns daily, and suffers for his poetry but not for lack of funds. And
what next, what happened next? That no hard to describe. The traper ninkle
clarped and the betterleg chowelled and mowelled cordighkly on the bailvies
of the gower. Drome laristic, mardifle across bettri gartri lams and
droofled past an litomlden plail. Anada! Anada! Anaaa... daaa..! And lenk,
ebertio, tendrilations lourve the bodel, graimed, graiming binsepf to
gabbed, to flarfed. Abtor leri, mutri laendelcarsting loni, ems lari
terringle, ems lopt, ems betriffle. And not gelf, but silman terdet the
somnally lycropian toller, veddically ablamsting the mandaliers. An questel
littertly. The zogd, emerly mortible, leamed, narg, gowding out into the
nedro-gooters. An mebd paured, "Hooner or baller mavn bend dirgle, then
lanx too recmildent." And with an weqwell: "Maiki neri!" But heder
tirfalle. The tean-luzded mahn zedded at the whoyle in front of iham. Ahas
beler, elak abdoptally out, and which can under the sicumstances penetrate
the fergatl tollgate. So by the time we got out of there it was to go back,
technical, but we didn’t. So all the marzeboddle hemfer to its lepanda, and
not, in principle, against the possession of the New England metaboller
scene, which has recently come under attach in criticism. Old money have
some argued the Fergus poems best likens to the thermals, but such a
proposition is untenable in the face of a journal with a tradition,
dedicated to ferdzallen hober in reptangle, as well as a representative
selection of new and emerging poets on the periphery. Have reached the
number seventeen. Merquando-listitrations. Fulcrum as lurch of eye
comprises sheer / Extroverted anus, nebulous as blue jays! And you wanna
hear some further, here it comes. I dye a dry wallet green. Have nothing
better to do. I converse with a tureen. Have nothing better to do.
Exaggerate salmon to shark. Have nothing smaller to do. Belittle a star to
a spark. Have nothing bigger to do. I spread the tablecloth wide. Have
nothing narr’wer to do. I reveal what I hide. Have nothing gladder to do.
Fantastic dreams drums past modulo reality into a clockwise twist against
itself to recollapse, to recollect itself barges approach barges, approach
from nowhere into the moonlit shine of unshepherded waves recline any which
way you will never know the pleasures of oblivion for you have been cast
crescently across the tresses of the milky, path but the barges, can still
reach you there. Or else what? I have been trying to recast my act,
essaying to reset my focus, mainly, and again smoking like a skunk and
vainly meaning to renegotiate the pact of the emotions. Hell’s seasons are
all inherently ideological, because their fluid forms inform the basis of a
mimetically grounded poesis. But take for instance verse that’s avantgarde!
Its cataclysmic flutes  too have their seasons, as collocations, reaching
for their guns, revert to sense, hoist by their own petards. Hello, hello,
the wordy barricades! Goodbye, goodbye, the capitalist season!

benefits regardless of his prior history:

SUPPLEMENTAL SECURITY INCOME -

STIPEND FOR HOUSING (Stateside, it seems - find out)

Have him contact the Social Security Administration in the jurisdiction

Race-ing Justice: The Prison-Industrial Complex

By Dr. Manning Marable <mm247@columbia.edu>

Several months ago, 650 people attended the "Race-ing Justice" Conference
in New York, sponsored by the Institute for Research in African-American
Studies at Columbia University.  In more than two dozen panels and
workshops, black people examined the destructive impact of the police, the
courts and the prison system upon the African-American community.  Our
current situation today, however, must be understood against the
totalitarian history of racial domination in America.

For two centuries, the black community was confronted with the
totalitarianism of slavery.  All people of African descent, slave or free,
were oppressed and subordinated by this structure of unequal racial power.
For nearly a century after the Civil War and Reconstruction, black people
experienced the systemic subordination of Jim Crow segregation.
Regardless of one's income, education or social status, to be black under
the totalitarian restrictions of Jim Crow meant confinement to second
class status.  In the twentieth century, the construction of the urban
ghetto imposed another kind of social control on black development,
certainly less pervasive than slavery had been, but in some respects was
more destructive to the human spirit.  Today, the new totalitarian mode of
racial domination has become the prison industrial complex, an ever
expanding archipelago of prisons across the American countryside.

In the United States today, about four to five million Americans receive
criminal records every year.  Roughly one in five U.S. citizens has a
criminal record.  In a society severely stratified by race and class, most
of those who are pushed into the penal system are not unexpectedly black,
brown and poor.  One third of all prisoners were unemployed at the time of
their arrest, with the others averaging less than $15,000 annual incomes
in the year prior to their arrest.  About one half of the 1.8 million
people in federal and state prisons and jails are African Americans.

As researcher J.W. Mason noted, "The proportion of black men in prison
about 6 percent is approximately 20 times the corresponding rate for white
men . . .  In Baltimore, 56 percent of black men are in prison or jail,
out on bail, on probation or parole, or being sought on an arrest warrant.
At least 90 percent of black men can expect to be arrested and jailed for
a non-traffic offense at some point of their lives."  Although the
majority of black prisoners are young men in their twenties and thirties,
the fastest growing sector of the penal population consists of men
fifty-five years old and above.

Even outside of the prison walls, the black community's parameters are
largely defined by the agents of state and private power.  There are now
about 600,000 police officers and 1.5 million private security guards in
the U.S.  Increasingly, however, black and poor communities are being
"policed" by special paramilitary units, often called SWAT ("Special
Weapons and Tactics") teams.  Researcher Christian Parenti cites studies
indicating that "the nation has more than 30,000 such heavily armed,
military trained police unites."  SWAT team mobilizations or "call outs"
increased 400 percent between 1980 and 1995, with a 34 percent increase in
the incidents of deadly force recorded by SWAT teams from 1995 to 1998.

What are the political consequences of regulating black and poor people
through the criminal justice and penal systems?  Perhaps the greatest
impact is on the process of black voting.  According to an October, 1998
study, "Losing the Vote," produced by the Sentencing Project and Human
Rights Watch, two nonprofit research groups, about 3.9 million Americans,
or one in fifty adults, have currently or permanently lost the ability to
vote because of a felony conviction.  In 32 states, convicted offenders
are not permitted to vote while on parole.  In fourteen states, former
prisoners who have fully served their terms remain disenfranchised, and in
ten of these states, ex-felons are prohibited from voting for life.  For
African Americans, these figures can be translated into 1.4 million men
who are denied the right to vote, compared to 4.6 million who actually
voted in the 1996 elections.  The racial impact of ex-felon
disenfranchisement cited by the study is truly astonishing

o In Alabama and Florida, 31 percent of all black men are permanently
disenfranchised.

o In five other states Iowa, Mississippi, New Mexico, Virginia, and
Wyoming one in four black men (24 to 28 percent) is permanently
disenfranchised.  In Washington state, one in four of black men (24
percent) are currently or permanently disenfranchised.

o In Delaware, one in five black men (20 percent) is permanently
disenfranchised.

o In Texas, one in five black men (20.8 percent) is currently
disenfranchised.

o In four states Minnesota, New Jersey, Rhode Island, and Wisconsin 16 to
18 percent of black men are currently disenfranchised.

o In nine states Arizona, Connecticut, Georgia, Maryland, Missouri,
Nebraska, Nevada, Oklahoma and Tennessee 10 to 15 percent of black men are
currently disenfranchised.

In effect, the Voting Rights Act of 1965, which guaranteed millions of
African Americans the right to the electoral franchise, is being gradually
repealed by state restrictions on ex-felons from voting.  A people who are
imprisoned in disproportionately higher numbers, and then systematically
denied the right to vote, can in no way claim to live under a democracy.

Dear readers:

Sun & Moon Press and Green Integer have both had a very busy
summer, and we have lots of new titles to announce. Once again,
we offer these books to people on the list for a 20% discount.
We suggest that to order you should mail a check or money order
with $1.25 postage charge per book. You can order over E-mail
or through our web sites: www.sunmoon.com  and www.greeninteger.com,
but we prefer pre-payments, since some payments have been very slow
in coming and we always need the cash to do new books.

Here are the new titles:

SUN & MOON

THE CONFETTI TREES, by Barbara Guest  $10.95 ($8.76 for Poetics List
members)

Barbara's wonderful, stylish, and beautifully poetic short tales
concerning film and filmmakers. Barbara lived in Los Angeles as a young
girl, and met some of the great early film-directors (through her
childhood friends). Stories here concern figures such as Lang, Milestone,
Lubitsch, etc. This is a beautiful book with art on the cover and inside
as well. An important development in Guest's great career.


THE PROMISED LAND: ITALIAN POETRY AFTER 1975 A Bilingual Edition
Edited by Luigi Ballerini, Beppe Cavatorta, Elena Coda, and Paul
Vangelisti  $25.95 ($20.76 for list members)

The much promised PROMISED LAND is finally availalbe. This is truly the
most splendid gathering of Italian contemporary poetry ever published. It
includes a liberal sampling of poems by 30 poets (it's 686 pages long),
including Amellia Rosselli, Nanni Balestrini, Biagio Cepollaro, Milo De
Angelis, Alfredo Giuliani, Milli Graffi, Giulia Niccolai, Elio
Pagliarani, Antonio Porta, Giovanna Sandri, Edoardo Sanguinetti, Adriano
Spatola, Emilio Villa, and Andrea Zanzotto. An important book.


A FRAME OF THE BOOK, Erin Mouré  $12.95 ($10.36 for list members)

Erin Moure is one of the most adventursome and yet skillful of
contemporary Canadian poets. Her work is truly wonderful, and we hope
readers in the US will become more aware of it.


                       GREEN INTEGER

Just to let you know, Green Integer is an independent publishing venture,
edited by me (Douglas Messerli). It is not part of Sun & Moon.

ON IBSEN, James Joyce $8.95 ($7.16 for list members)
Edited with an Introduction by Dennis Phillips
Green Integer 12

This book includes all the writings Joyce did on the Norwegian
playwright, Henrik Ibsen, a writer to who Joyce was attracked very early
in his career. Phillips contextualizes that interest in an introductory
essay.

ON OVERGROWN PATHS, Knut Hamsun $12.95 ($10.36 for list members)
Green Intger: 22

The first authoritative English translation (by Sverre Lyngstad, who also
did Sun & Moon's ROSA) of Hamsun's last book, written after World War II,
at a time when Hamsun was in police custody for his openly expressed Nazi
sympathies during the German occupation of Norway, 1940-45. This is
Hamsun's defense and apologia, and in its creative elan, the books,
filled with the proud sorrow of an old man, miraculously recalls the
spirit of Hamsun's early novels, with their reverence for nature,
absurdist humor, and quirky flights of fancy.

POEMS, by Sappho  $10.95 ($8.76 for list members)
Translated by Willis Barnstone
Green Integer: 26

This wonderful edition of Sappho's poems was the one originally published
by Sun & Moon Press, an edition which sold out in a few months time. It's
a great book for the classroom.


HELL HAS NO LIMITS, José Donoso $10.95 ($8.76 for list members)
Translated from the Spanish by Suzanne Jill Levine
Green Integer: 28

One of the best novels by the great Chilean magic-realist, this book
recounts a fateful day in the collective existence of Estacion El Olivo,
a decayed community marked for doom as surely as Donoso's central
character, the transvestite dance/prostitute la Manuela, whose virginal
daughter operates the brothel out of which she/he works. A powerful book.


THEORETICAL OBJECTS, Nick Piombino $10.95 ($8.76 for list members)
Green Integer 34

For several years now poet Nick Piombino has been writing a series of
personal statements--manifestos, sayings, speeches, and
autobiographical-like pieces--which cross the boundaries of essay and
poetry. Here are 49 of these works collected. This is a book for anyone
who likes poetry and wants to explore how meaning is made.


ART POETIC' by Olivier Cadiot  $!2.95 ($10.36)
Translated from the French by Cole Swensen
Green Integer: 36

This many-voiced, multi-perspective poetic text could be likened to the
journal of a scientist recording observable phenomena, but yet resisting
to make any conclusions of the truth of what is perceived, since language
inherently shifts, moves, and falls into silence. Cadiot is dead serious
in his explorations, but his work is also filled with humor and wit.


FUGITIVE SUNS: SELECTED POETRY by Andrée Chedid ($11.95 $9.56 for list
members)
Translated from the French by Lynne Goodhart and Jon Wagner
Green Integer: 37

With over twenty-six books of poetry, ten novels, four collections of
short stories, and various books of theater, film, essays and children's
books, Egyptian born Andrée Chedid is one of the most noted authors of
our time. This collects a representative selection of her poetry,
presented bi-lingually.

Upcoming this month:

MEXICO. A PLAY, by Gertrude Stein
BALLETS WITHOUT MUSIC, WITHOUT DANCERS, WITHOUT ANYTHING,
  by Louis-Ferdinand Céline
and other Green Integer titles.

Green Integer: 44

Some of you may know Régis Bonvicino has the central editor
(along with Michael Palmer and Nelson Ascher) of the Sun & Moon
anthology of Brazilian poetry, NOTHING THE SUN COULD NOT EXPLAIN.
Régis is a true force of contemporary Brazilian writing, interested
in exchanging ideas and causing exciting things to happen on Brazilian
scene. Through his own reviews in the major Sao Paolo newspaper,
his editing, and his own poetry, he's a virtual dervish of
excitement. This book brings togther a substantial gathering of
his own poetry, presented bi-lingually.

It has been pointed out that numerical representation of dates is confusing
in countries that do not follow the splended British example. I should know
this by now. Here is the SVP autumn season again (similar adjustment will be
made to the website in due course), with clarification, but without the
attached begging letter that people attend... Please attend

If I temper with your heartsick sender
these bungalows are only provisional
history, the blue milk sky or the white
milk one, well, that's a whole paragraph

of contentment, bursting the bucket
silence in the cities; so in peril we go
on and on, mixing tracks at our feet
with the dust, bone, leaves, yes, Mason,

you're angry, but also a demonstration.

** NOTICE **  NOTICE  **  NOTICE **

Carl Rakosi - famed for his association with the "Objectivists" circle of
poets - will be reading in a rare home-town appearance, 7:30 p.m. Thursday
Sept 9, 1999 at the Unitarian Center, San Francisco (which is on Franklin
at Geary, just a block west of Van Ness, running parallel)

Mr Rakosi, born in 1903 in Berlin, spent his early childhood in Hungary,
emigrating to the US at age six.  He became a friend and associate at the
University of Wisconsin with of circle of poets and political activists
that included so-called "proletarian-poet" Kenneth Fearing, among others.
On reading his early magazine publications (Little Review, transition, New
Masses, et al) Louis Zukofsky asked Rakosi to contribute to the renowned
"Objectivists" issue of Poetry magazine (February 1931) where he was
featured beside Charles Reznikoff, Basil Bunting, W.C. Williams, and, later
as well, to AN "OBJECTIVISTS" ANTHOLOGY (1932), published in France by
George & Mary Oppen's small expatriate press, To, Publishers.  Mr Rakosi
dropped out of poetry publishing between 1941 & the early sixties (devoting
himself to social work). New Directions would publish two books,  AMULET
and ERE-VOICE, and Black Sparrow EX CRANIUM, NIGHT, during the 60s and 70s,
alongside a scattering of limited letterpress items.   In recent years, the
National Poetry Foundation published both a volume of COLLECTED PROSE and
COLLECTED POEMS, & the critical volume, CARL RAKOSI: MAN & POET, while
British poet (& former student in the mid-60s at Buffalo) Andrew Crozier
edited Rakosi's POEMS 1923-1941 (Sun & Moon, 1995), presenting for the
first time in a book the early magazine work.

Still prolific at age 96, Mr Rakosi has had two recent books published in
England by poet Nicholas Johnson's etruscan books:  THE EARTH SUITE (1997)
and - just slipped through customs - THE OLD POET'S TALE, whose title poem
is a remarkable piece on the last years of his friend George Oppen.  A
beautiful large book, THE OLD POET'S TALE collects several booklength
series of poems & is the first of three volumes planned for publication by
etruscan books, as Mr Rakosi's COLLECTED WORKS.  He of course, will be
signing copies of these new works Thursday night, following the reading.

Don't miss this rare opportunity to hear Carl Rakosi reading from his
poetry in San Francisco.  This special event is presented as part of the
Centennial Celebration of San Francisco State University, which has
sponsored and housed The Poetry Center since it's founding in 1954.

See you there!

How reprehensibly elitist of David Bromige to declare himself poet
laureate of California.  I think every California poet, past and
present, which would include me, California resident for 15 years,
should be declared poet laureate of California--for life.  Or maybe
every resident of California should be so declared, I'm not firm on
that yet.  But California should surely have at least ten thousand
poet laureates.

I'm a bit at a loss here. What, I wonder, would Carolyn Burke like? That
she had been involved in the novelization process? That people not novelize
biographies? That the novelizations be biographically accurate? That we not
buy Antonia Logue's book? I'm sorry that she feels ripped off, and I can't
speak as an academic-who's-been-ripped-off, but if someone's going to
novelize a life, I don't see how they can get around the bio. No doubt
Carolyn Burke thinks Antonia Logue cut too close to her own work, but where
is a novelizer to turn? If Logue is going to speculate, must she speculate
radically different speculations than Burke speculates? If you're
novelizing a bio, aren't you mythologizing? And so perhaps preferable to
use the more common myths?

Excellent questions all, but I can't shake the feeling that I was expected
to react to a brouhaha...

I guess they do sound excellent to their author but  am I the  only
reader who finds them mostly answered in Burke's post? WHERE IS THE
NOVELIZER TO TURN? o, poor noveliser! Novelisers Go Home, I say.
Seems like there's some confusion about genre here, about how to be
in or out of genre or meaningfully neither in or out. Am I wrong?

Tom,

It's a quote from _The Secret of the Golden Flower_ that Olson uses in
hisessay/talk "Causal Mythology"  (first vol. of _Muthologos_ & undoubtedly
in the Cal Collected Prose).

He uses it again in the poem "The Secret of the Black Chrysanthemum" that
Charles Stein devoted a book-length study to.

Depends of course - but part of the idea is to see what happens with the
Y2K rollover, which is the earlier hinge (there's another around 2038 but
I'll be dead). It's looking at the way the electrical grid works, it's
coming to grips with the grid, not just presenting on the surface, but
watching the measure of its nerves.

MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII

the
siliconathanor
magazine project

PLEASE SPREAD THIS MESSAGE

Ten years after the experience with  "Circolo Pickwick" magazine, I'm
planning to realise at the beginning of the new year a "number zero"
(experimental issue) of a new printed magazine.
The title will be "siliconathanor".
We are looking for contributors.
Here are the characteristics of this new project.

SPECIFICATIONS:
Size: something inside A3  (probably cm. 34X28,5)
Cover: full colour
Internal pages: b/w
number of pages: to define

THE SPIRIT:
We want to realise an artistic project, to explore mainly the areas between
electronic media and creativity in this peculiar moment.

MATERIALS  WE ARE LOOKING FOR:

        A) TEXTS

        1- short stories, poems, any kind of experimental text, with an
evident connection to present time:  transformations, electronic media,
cyberspace, spiritual developments, ethical problems and so on.

        2- articles and short essays on the same themes.

Anyway I will be glad to consider anything, even outside the main themes.
Consider that the magazine will be targeted on creative texts much more
than on essays.
I hate to give length limits to writers (being a writer myself and hating
to have such limits...): but please remember your text  should be one among
others, and not the one that fills the whole magazine.
IMPORTANT: please send the texts via e-mail as attached file -or snail mail
on a floppy disk- also (save as: text, txt, rtf).
Texts in English or French will be published in their original language
with an Italian translation. Texts in Italian will be published only in the
original language, except special cases, when they could be translated in
English. Don't forget to write on the work itself (not only on the
envelope!) your name, address and so on.

        B) IMAGES
Any subject. Any technique allowed. Any size. Electronic images (jpeg, tiff
and so on) welcome. Paper prints or original works welcome as well. Please
be conscious that the works reproduced in the internal pages will be grey
scale printed.
Don't forget to write on the work's back (not only on the envelope!) your
name, address and so on.

        C) REVIEWS
We plan to publish a note about ANY publication that we'll receive, being
on printed paper, magnetic or laser support; literary, musical or
multimedia.
Any press release  is welcome too: but in that case we will choose if to
include it or not.

        D) MAIN THEME
We would like to have a main theme for each issue. This will come in the
future. In number zero there will be just a thematic section. Key-word:
AVATAR. Works on this subject are more than welcome.

CONTRIBUTORS
If you want to participate to this experiment, you have to do it for free.
This is a no-profit attempt to create a new, free artistic medium.
Number zero will be widely diffused among magazines, cultural institutions
and so on.
I promise I'll send two complimentary copies to all the published
participants and one to all those who proposed original materials, even if
not published (press releases not included).
I warmly suggest you to send also a biography and a picture of yours,
because I plan to publish a small but complete file about any of the
contributors at the end of the magazine.
For obvious reasons, we will not send back the works you mail us.

COPIRIGHT
It remains property of the authors, that will be free to do what they want
of their works in the future.

TEAM
At the moment our team is composed by: Giuseppe Iannicelli, Alberto Crosio,
Veronica Villa, Diego Fasano.

ADDRESS:

you can send your works to:
                Siliconathanor - CP 122         I-15100 Alessandria - ITALIA

The email you can use as well is:
thelab@lycosmail.com

Please always begin the subject of the email with the word
"siliconathanor", then add anything you need to.

Best regards. Giuseppe Iannicelli

IF YOU DO NOT WANT TO RECEIVE ANYMORE INFO ABOUT THIS PROJECT, PLEASE JUST
REPLY TO THIS MESSAGE WITH THE WORD "REMOVE" IN THE BODY OF THE MESSAGE.
Thanks

Hi poetics list,
This is (as far as I know) a complete schedule of this VERY
special event, co-sponsored by many San Francisco literary
organizations and cultural agencies. If you want more info
on an particular event than is listed here, I suggest
calling the presenting organization. (I haven't found a
central coordinator and can't help you with questions,
sorry.) This is an opportunity to hear poets who are
very rarely (if ever) here, as well as wonderful local
writers and translators. It looks super...

I was just in NY and surprised that Tower records clearance outlet (and
by extension, Tower Records) has a lot of Talisman Bks, Harryette
Mullen's _Muse & Drudge_, and a lot of other interesting stuff.  Much
better than Tower Outlet in THIS NoHo.

That's right - rise up downstairs as the ZINC BAR SUNDAY NIGHT READING
SERIES kicks off the fall season.  We've run the series all summer & now
it's time for you to take over - & to take advantage of your hosts'
sun-addled minds & sun-addled minds.  Let me explain:  The vast number of
crummy open mics around the country do nothing to address the real desire
of most poets - that is, to run a series themselves.  And so we've taken it
upon ourselves to begin the autumn with an open-host night at the Zinc Bar.

Series founder Joe Eliot returns to guest mc on September 12 when audience
members & former readers are invited to introduce Brendan Lorber & Douglas
Rothschild, the word-drunk curators.  Wearing clever disguises & employing
our vast network of spies, Douglas and I have ascertained that many people
look upon this evening as an opportunity to get back at us for our somewhat
tangential, sprawling approach to introductions during the rest of the
year.  One person anticipates an evening not unlike the scene in Airplane
in which people line up with boxing gloves and monkey wrenches to take
turns calming a hysterical passenger.

Whatever the outcome, we foolishly invite all of you to come & introduce us
and, if there is time, we'll read some of our own work after.

The following week, four Danish poets will be reading their poetry in
English & Danish as part of a broader festival of Danish culture throughout
the Metropolitan Area this month.  It should prove to be a memorable night
& we recommend checking out the other events Denmark is bringing us, in
addition to this reading.

Continuing on the international tip, the final week in September brings us
Indran Amirthanayagam & Ron Price.  Indran's in town briefly & is making a
rare appearance.  (He'll also be reading on MAD ALEX Presents on Monday
Sept 27th if you'd like to see him again.)

In October we'll be hosting a global blend of poets whose work spans
several languages and whose names are certain to be bolloxed by Douglas'
spelling ability and Brendan's distracted states.

So here's the rundown for September

SUNDAY SEPTEMBER 12:
DOUGLAS ROTHSCHILD &
BRENDAN LORBER
(Joe Eliot moderates and YOU are the special guest host)

SUNDAY SEPTEMBER 19:
KATRINE MARIE GULDAGER &
SOREN ULRIK THOMSEN &
ANNE METTE LUNDTOFTE &
TODD THILLEMAN

SUNDAY SEPTEMBER 26:
INDRAN AMIRTHANAYAGAM &
RON PRICE

The Zinc Bar is at 90 West Houston Street between Laguardia & Thompson, in
the basement.  After the reading & every night in fact, the Zinc Bar has
some pretty good jazz.

All readings "start" at 6:37pm every single Sunday.

We ask for three bucks, which go to the readers.  If you can't manage three
bucks, give us whatever you can manage, even if its just best wishes.  We
recommend bringing a little extra tho, as readers often bring their books &
Brendan is always flogging his LUNGFULL!Magazine.

If you need more information: 212.533.9317 or 212.366.2091.  (For extra
fun, why not conference these two numbers together & then secretly listen
in.)   You can also e us at lungfull@interport.net, though we can't
guarantee the degree of delight that'll bring.

As always, if this email grieves you - because, say, you don't want it,
please let us know & you'll never hear from the Zinc boys again.

On behalf of Douglas Rothschild and all of us at the Zinc Bar Sunday Night
Reading Series, thanks for your time.  I'm Brendan Lorber. Good night, &
we'll see you on Sunday.

Good idea to speak up and out about East Timor.  It may also be just as good
and probably easier to protest the American gov't for their ongoing role in
the slaughter and oppression of the East Timorese.  It was the American
Gov't. that paid for and supervised the original Indonesian invasion, and
the American gov't is trying hard to escape culpability with ambiguous
declarations (coming from such shits as Madeline Albright) about the chaotic
and oppressive state of affairs while also trying to take any potential
actions and tie them up in red tape.  Such action clearly gives the
Indonesian gov't has a chance to tie up power once again while everyone else
takes their time designating panels and working groups. Since a visit by
Kissinger, Ford, and Scowcroft to Suharto in July 1975, the Indonesian
government, using mostly US-made and US-paid-for weapons and military
intelligence support, has killed between 1/4 and 1/3 of the original
inhabitants.  That's about 200,000-300,000 people.  We're talking
concentration camps between 1975-1979.  Paid for by US taxpayers. Certain
people meant business when it all started 24 years ago; I don't think they
mean any less harm now.  If the US supported the democratic efforts of the
East Timorese none of this probably would have happened.

Colleagues:

I'd appreciate hearing from anyone with suggestions for a course on the
Novels of the Sixties. Of particular interest are novels that reflect,
in form and/or content, the counter culture. The limit for this theme
(arbitrary though it may be) is that the publication date of the book
must fall between 1960 and 1970.

Why not:
          King Poet Laureate, David Bromige
                    &
          Queen Poet Laureate, Joanne Kyger

Whether this is a California Divine Regency or not, is probably open to
question. But Joanne's native birth right will heal any problems with David's
alien Canadian status. And they will both look great and appropriate together
in pageant or play.

Does anyone captain or know of any small New England litmags that
might be interested in setting up a booth at the Bartlett Society
book fair, in Providence, at Brown, late October Saturday? Sales
would generate revenue, word-of-mouth and money. Fine-press
centurions are attending from as far away from home as Manhattan.
I've already talked with Michael Magee, of the fabulous _Combo_. Any
other takers? "Regional" webmags are welcome to submit a link
(there'll be a magazine webprojection). Send an email this week if
you might be interested: Macgregor_Card@Brown.edu.

Thanks,
Macgregor

Just tried to access that site to read the Watten essay, in hopes of
getting the portion he didn't have time to deliver at the Toronto MLA, but
I got a message that it wasn't found on the specified server -- Hope this

            A Reproach

it's so simple: make up the biography! it's not as if distance didn't exist
in this and all matters. skidmarks litter the road to fame. take the current
example: working with her poet/boxer friend, Myrna Loy developed a new way
to exaggerate. she defined her region of interest, simulating participation,
while her boxer/poet friend, Arthur Cravan, defined his, simulating
disinterest. the modern puzzle was easily solved. Loy the subject, meaning
Mina, became a logo, an experience and a DRAMATIC TURN OF EVENTS!!!. Myrna,
famous in her own right, knew the price of fame. her emphasis was clear. she
would kick off her shoes as William Powell, no poet/boxer he, sauntered
about the apartment shaking the iconic martini shaker with a dolourous
abandon, at the same time declaring with a burp "I have a book in me."
modernist Myrna would simply sigh, "my dogs are killing me." Not Asta, the
literal dog but -- oh my -- we have taken a trip with the possible. Mina Loy
said modernism will just have to take care of itself, whether biography
outlives her or not. she implies that we should unite the streams of
resistance and truth, and tremble beneath the new kabalistic glare. she
knew, I'm sure, that moderner babies are born every day, and each will want
a newer biography, the shimmer of which will suggest novelistic
possibilities. sure, we are all still people, in the usual marginal use of
that term, but oh, we could talk about more. Mina Loy, therefore, is NOT
Myrna Loy. not now, and maybe not to come. the connective tissues maintain a
tenuous grip, which is why the genre called futurity is so passe. one
concludes, then, that being force fed by the collected authority doesn't
really help.

Here is something of use and interest: Jill Neville's 'The Love Germ.'  It
is a novel that takes place during the May 68 uprising.  I believe it was
written during that period.

Also I would think any fiction book by Terry Southern, The Soft Machine by
Burroughs, etc.

Culture and Anarchy


  "It may well be," he said, in his sudden lyrical manner, "it may well be
on such a night of clouds and cruel colours that there is brought forth
upon the earth such a portent as a respectable poet. You say you are a
poet of law; I say you are a contradiction in terms. I only wonder there
were not comets and earthquakes on the night you appeared in this garden."

[...]

  "You are wrong," said the Secretary, drawing his black brows together.
"The knife was merely the expression of the old personal quarrel with a
personal tyrant. Dynamite is not only our best tool, but our best symbol.
It is as perfect a symbol of us as is incense of the prayers of the Chris-
tians. It expands; it only destroys because it broadens; even so, thought
only destroys because it broadens. A man's brain is a bomb," he cried out,
loosening suddenly his strange passion and striking his own skull with
violence. "My brain feels like a bomb, night and day. It must expand! It
must expand! A man's brain must expand, if it breaks up the universe."

(quotes from The Man Who was Thursday, G. K. Chesterton.)

  "I have never been so tense as to write 'currenct' for 'current' or 'may
bell we' for 'may well be' as I am now," they continued; the date was duly
noted among each and every line, making no difference to the general at-
mosphere. "It's impossible to think straight any longer," they said, hit-
ting the table with their fists in a dull pounding, "just when one thought
appears, another violates it, attempts to take its place. Everything melts
before my eyes; there's nothing but red and black, black on red, red on
black!" They replied with vehemence; the argument went on long into the
night. The next morning, there would be headlines in the newspapers all
across Europe; now was the time for reflection. "You can see an error for
what it is," they said, "you can see it and see it - and nothing helps; it
sits there, invisible! No wonder everything appears in version after ver-
sion! Our poor humanity gets by on its last ropes; what's left of it is
always unrecognized, a victim of the slowness of speech, the deafness of
the listener, dyslectic readers, genius!"

I thank you, fellow poetry-fans, for those three votes. They counterbalance
the pair of hairsplitters who dont know whether i'm from venus or mars. But
Bob Gruman has it right, of course---I only meant that each of us should
make a like declaration. Given, that is, that we are uneasy w/o a
representative.

It was a moment of flippitude. I diss noone. Peter, that is.  Elected,

        The seeded friend of humankind is cashed,

        a lab where every leaf is dried to that
        word-perfect flam and readiness to act
        on every syllable. The moot trapeze
        of sense remotely utters thank you, please
        and marches down directly to the page
        to perpetrate its sensuous brigandage.
        Semantic hemlocks melt to tilted tiles
        and titles brim with paratactic styles
        like paratroopers of the golden ring,
        who come to spell a wish on everything
        with serious roach music in the bong,
        God-naughty and immensely drawn to song.

"In the whole period, from Walt Whitman and Emily Dickinson to Edwin
Arlington Robinson and Robert Frost, the greatest American poet is Stuart
Merrill" --Kenneth Rexroth

"Merrill performed the incredibly difficult feat of wringing out of French
versification the soft far-away music of the English Pre-Raohaelites. More
than any other he produced the nearest thing in words to Debussy's music."
--Vincent O'Sullivan, _Dictionary of American Biography_

Stuart Merrill (1863-1915) stood at the center of the international
literary world in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Too
American to fit into the French literary tradition and too French to fit
into the American, he was a great maverick, important to both cultures but
in the deepest sense belonging to none. As a Symbolist, he was among the
forerunners of Modernism, and as a translator, he was crucial in making
Stephen Mallarme and Paul Verlaine known in America and William Butler
Yeats and Arthur Symons known in France. He defended the anarchists in the
Haymarket Square riot of 1886, for which he was disinherited by his
wealthy, socially prominent father. Leaving America permanently in 1892,
he moved to Paris and later made his home near the palace at Versailles. A
respected member of the inner circle surrounding Mallarme, he defended
Oscar Wilde and Walt Whitman and published dozens of essays in support of
young writers and new ideas. _The White Tomb_ includes major examples of
his poetry (both in French and in English translation) as well as a
selection of his translations and essays including his essays on his
friends Wilde and Verlaine and his famous account of meeting Whitman
shortly before the poets death.

"The saddening thought for us is this: that English literature has lost to
France two delicate and fascinating poets [Stuart Merrill and Francis
Viele-Griffin], who might have stood by the side of W. B. Yeats and Arthur
Symons as wizards of the word. And the United States have lost their two
greatest contemporary poets." --Jethro Bithell, _Contemporary French
Poetry_

_The Gig_ 4/5: The Poetry of Peter Riley


The next issue of _The Gig_ magazine will be a special perfectbound
double-issue of essays on the poetry of Peter Riley.  This will provide the
first substantial collection of criticism and commentary on an oeuvre which
has already, with such classic books as _Lines on the Liver_, _Tracks and
Mineshafts_ and _Distant Points_, been widely influential and admired.  The
issue's
contributors will include Andrew Crozier, Nigel Wheale, John Hall, Keston
Sutherland, Mark Morrisson, Tony Baker, Peter Larkin, Peter Middleton &
others.  It will also contain an interview conducted by Keith Tuma,
previously unpublished poetry by Peter Riley, new translations by Lorand
Gaspar, and a bibliography.  This volume will pay long-overdue attention to
one of the UK's most important poets.

_The Gig_ needs advance support to enable the publication of this book.
(There is, as one might anticipate, no public funding available in Canada
for publishing work by non-Canadian authors.)  The price is not yet fixed
but we are asking for a minimum advance subscription of $20 Canadian
dollars/$15 US dollars (prices include airmail within North America); or
£10 in sterling (includes surfacemail to UK/overseas; add £2 for airmail).
This amount may of course be increased by anyone who wishes thus to support
the venture, and such support will be acknowledged.

Subscriptions from Canada and USA should be sent and paid to "Nate
Dorward", at: _The Gig_, Nate Dorward, 109 Hounslow Ave., Willowdale, ON,
M2N 2B1, Canada; ph: (416) 221-6865; email: <ndorward@sprint.ca>.

                                                SCHOOL

Rolling awkwardly with the backward ebb of time, come back to school and
the tedium of a Russian literature class, with emphasis on the proletarian
novel, and then the delight of higher math. We were doing hyperbolic
functions and my head was chock-full of analysis and love and ripe puberty,
whose distinction from poetry remained fuzzy but was ultimately beginning
(barely) to dawn. The big wise Lenin, the most altruistic of men, in the
hallway, kindness and intelligence in his eye =96 we would hang him upside
down when no one looked, and Sashka Denisov laughed his pants off =96 the
joke felt even more forbidden than early teen imaginings of sex. During a
recess we went to pound the soda machines across the street at the
Agricultural Institute for free soda, and a funny middle-aged janitor lady
popped out the basement, mop in hand, and cried, "No soda. Get the fuck
out, boy! You bang that fountain once more and I call the cops." We teased
her and she yelled go away and threatened to show us her sex if we didn=92t.
We dared her to, and she said she wouldn=92t since we were fags. And in 1978
I fought Lyonia Cherniak on the dark third floor of our school No 37, near
the biology classroom. We were discovered by the principal. In my rage I
told her to get the bloody lost, and then had to call my parental units and
ask them to present themselves at school. So I called Dad at work and told
him the story and that he had to come see the principal. He did not believe
me, did not believe it was me on the phone. He said, "You=92re some fool
trying to play a stupid trick on me and Philip." I had to switch to English
to convince him. I said: "It=92s me, Dad, I swear on my life! Besides, if it
wasn=92t me, where=92d I get this number at the Foreign Languages Department=
?"
He said, "OK, I=92ll be there." So here he comes in fifteen minutes and I
lead him to the principal, and she goes on an on about what a problem boy I
am. Dad listens and nods and listens very attentively and then brings out,
"Don=92t worry, ma=92am. I=92ll whip him a-good when we get home," straight =
face
and all, my super Dad. Even I was so bewildered I nearly shat my pants. And
she, the principal, and here I must admit she was a pretty nice lady, and
pedagogical, so she says, "Oh, I=92m not sure such harsh disciplinary
measures are at all necessary." And Dad: "Don=92t you please worry, ma=92am.=
 I
know what I=92m doing. Sometimes these good-for-nothings ortabee taught a
lesson/two the old way. Otherwise they just won=92t understand watch=92re yo=
u
tryin=92 to say. I mean, these new ones, they are different, right? Not like
you and I and folks of our generation, born before or during the Great
Patriotic War, were when we were their age. Mild pedagogics just won=92t cut
the rope." And as we leave she stands there forever, a pillar of salt,
fundamentally pale, poor Valentina Nikolaevna, and Dad abducts me from the
remaining classes, and we go and buy a load of "Eskimo" ice-cream and then
hit some East-Indian movie (like a Spaghetti Western, only better) about
guns, friendship and revenge. Finally we go home, chattering like two
English magpies to the shock and amazement of the bus driver, who possibly
suspects we are spies. Mom, she will never figure out any of this.

I don't usually promote my daughters' activities but thought those of
you who are Brecht/Weill fans and who are in the Bay Area (or may be
coming soon) would be interested in Carey's production of THREE PENNY
OPERA which opened at ACT last night.  Herewith the review from SF
Examiner:

Modern classic in glorious guise

                     ACT offers brilliant version of 'Threepenny Opera'

                     By Robert Hurwitt
                     EXAMINER THEATER CRITIC


                            Performance credits


                     Bebe Neuwirth stands in a stark spotlight in front
of the tawdry, frayed red curtain, her thin face
                     framed in a thick black mane that cascades over her
tail coat and slit red mini. She plants her
                     stiletto-heeled feet and sheer-stockinged long legs
well apart and simply, matter-of-factly launches
                     into "Moritat," the justly famed "Ballad of Mack
the Knife."

                     Her stunning voice — overmiked as it is — rings out
clear, raw, insistent and penetrating with a
                     feral vibrato that broadcasts the emotional
resonance her formal stance and delivery belie. She sings
                     Bertolt Brecht's sardonic catalogue of Macheath's
career of rape, murder, robbery and mayhem —
                     "You won't see Mackie's knife blade/ Till you feel
it in your back" — investing every note of Kurt
                     Weill's melody with perfect phrasing and rising,
irresistible intensity.

                     By the time she's finished, you not only know Carey
Perloff's ACT season opener is going to be a
                     smash success, you understand all over again why
"The Threepenny Opera" is the definitive musical
                     drama of the 20th century. And that's just the
opening, before musical director Peter Maleitzke's hot
                     onstage jazz sextet has swung into the overture.
Two hours and 40 minutes later, as Neuwirth sings
                     the bitterly downbeat coda, those feelings remain
intact.

                     Not that "Threepenny" is foolproof. Brecht and
Weill wrote their 1928 masterpiece — the overnight
                     sensation that established their careers —
specifically for singing actors rather than trained musical
                     voices. But many a revival has foundered on inept
musicianship, onstage or in the pit (the original
                     featured the Lewis Ruth Band, one of Germany's top
jazz groups) — if not on sloppy staging, bad
                     acting or misconceived direction.

                     Perloff's "Threepenny," which opened Wednesday at
the Geary Theater, falls into none of these
                     traps. Michael Feingold's translation, revised from
his 1989 Broadway version, is sharp, lucid and
                     almost as biting as Brecht's German. The
musicianship is brilliant on every hand. Perloff's staging
                     is crisp, clear and brightly original without
calling undue attention to its own cleverness.

                     And the cast she's assembled is quite simply the
finest I've seen since the "Threepenny" that turned
                     me into a lifelong theater devotee, the 1950s Off
Broadway Theater de Lys production with which
                     Lotte Lenya — Weill's widow and Brecht's original
Jenny — helped revive Weill's reputation and
                     re-establish the play as a contemporary classic.

                     It's a cast made up of equal parts Broadway
veterans — Neuwirth, Philip Casnoff, Lisa Vroman,
                     Nancy Dussault — ACT regulars (Steven Anthony
Jones, Anika Noni Rose, Charles Lanyer, Dan
                     Hiatt), other local actors and students from ACT's
MFA and Young Conservatory programs. Perloff
                     weaves their talents into a seamless ensemble full
of outstanding performances.

                     Not to mention a stunning blend of diverse,
complementary performance styles: Neuwirth's
                     confrontational Weimar cabaret stance; Dussault's
deft vaudeville turns; Casnoff's disarming
                     soft-shoe hoofer grace; Vroman's operatic
flourishes and silent-movie melodrama gestural
                     eloquence; Rose's romantic ingénue underlaid with
lusty burlesque. It's a range reflective of the
                     eclectic sources for both the score and the script.

                     Brecht and Weill threw the play together in a few
short months. The script, of course, is based on
                     John Gay's brilliant 18th century "The Beggar's
Opera," heavily adapted by Brecht from a
                     translation by his longtime collaborator Elisabeth
Hauptmann.

                     Brecht borrowed heavily from a number of other
sources — several song lyrics from Villon (listing
                     him in the program and paying royalties to his
translator, Karl Klammer, who wrote under the name
                     Ammer), not to mention language from Kipling and
the Bible and and ideas from Piscator,
                     Wedekind, Noh drama, Shaw, Büchner, Pirandello and
others.

                     Weill matched Brecht's eclecticism with a score
that blended American jazz and Lutheran hymns,
                     German cabaret and English music hall, high and
light opera and other influences, including one
                     entire song lifted from Gay — whose own score had
been entirely composed of popular English
                     tunes. It's a script and score that could make a
post-modernist scholar dizzy analyzing layers of
                     borrowing. But it takes no expertise whatsoever to
revel in the play's still-astonishing freshness, bite
                     and beauty.

                     Perloff, wisely, lets the play speak for itself,
making only minor adjustments — far less radical than
                     Brecht was wont to do with his own productions.
True, she sticks "Moritat" out front, before the
                     overture, and gives it to Jenny instead of the
usual streetsinger. But Neuwirth, a memorable Velma
                     in Broadway's recent "Chicago" (as well as on
"Cheers"), provides a blisteringly vivid rendition that
                     fully justifies the change.

                     Feingold, theater critic for the Village Voice, has
cut the text and songs some. But he's restored the
                     songs to their original order and characters
(though Perloff has Neuwirth's Jenny double gloriously
                     with Rose's Polly Peachum on a resonant, searing
"Pirate Jenny"). Some of his translations
                     undercut Brecht's humor, particularly in the
rousing "Soldier's Song" ("Cannon Song"), but most
                     capture the crisp clarity of Brecht's wit.

                     Perloff and choreographer Luis Perez infuse the
show with a brisk, engaging energy that only flags a
                     bit in the middle of the second act. Annie Smart's
set — a two-story, distressed brick shell of an
                     opera house, as if after an earthquake — and
turn-of-the-century costumes establish the vaguely San
                     Francisco-ish milieu of Perloff's version.

                     The performers turn in one show-stopping rendition
after another, giving the songs the intensified
                     focus and self-conscious theatricality Brecht
demanded. Dussault is outstanding as the tipsy,
                     resourceful Mrs. Peachum, pairing brilliantly with
Jones' gruff, booming, sanctimonious baritone
                     on the Peachums' beggar shop duets. With a resonant
whiskey-tinged voice and deft sight gags, she
                     turns the "Ballad of the Prisoner of Sex" into a
hilarious solo turn of sardonic wit and delightful
                     ribaldry.

                     Vroman is outstanding as Lucy Brown — Polly's rival
and daughter of Lanyer's nicely tortured
                     Sheriff Tiger Brown — both in a stunning vocal
face-off "Jealousy Duet" with Rose's Polly and in
                     her superb, diabolically melodramatic (and rarely
performed) "Lucy's Aria." Rose is sweetly
                     touching and brightly lusty in her love duets with
Casnoff and in her delightful "Barbara Song"
                     about lost innocence.

                     Above all, Neuwirth's Jenny and Casnoff's Macheath
set the tone — she with her sharp, combative
                     watchfulness; he with the murderous impulse not
quite concealed beneath his song-and-dance grace.
                     Neuwirth is as outstanding in her cynical "Solomon
Song" as in the "Moritat" and "Pirate Jenny."
                     Casnoff, too, sings beautifully, rendering
Macheath's great paeans to corruption and soulful gallows
                     hymns with dynamic intensity. And their tango duet
("Pimp's Ballad") is stunning in its erotic
                     electricity and vicious execution.

                     It's altogether a brilliant production, Brecht and
Weill's "opera for beggars" delivered with a
                     wondrously ragtag "splendor only a beggar could
imagine" (though not, as the prologue goes on to
                     state, "at a price even a beggar can afford"). As
Neuwirth sings its acute final verses — about a
                     society divided between those who walk in light and
"those in darkness lost to sight" — it's hard to
                     leave the Geary without a deeper awareness of the
social injustices so evident in the surrounding
                     streets.

Howdy folks, thought I'd shamelessly plug the essay of mine which appears
in the "poetics" section of the new KENNING. It's called "Democratic
Symbolic Action: Sketches Toward a Guide to Practice," and is a laying-out
of some techniques employed in the writings of Emerson, Ellison and
O'Hara.  The theoretical framework (what there is of one!) draws on
various strands of American pragmatism: William James, John Dewey, Kenneth
Burke, Clifford Geertz, Cornel West.  Anyway, there it is.  You can see

AND: please buy the new issue ($5 per; $13 for three).  I pay for

Histoire

Tina and Seth met in the midst of an overcrowded militarism.
"Like a drink:" he asked her?  "They make great Alexanders over at the
    Marxism-Leninism."
She agreed.  They shared cocktails.  They behaved cautiously, as in a
    period of pre-fascism.
Afterwards he suggested dinner at a restaurant renowned for its Maoism.
"O,K.," she said, but first she had to phone a friend about her ailing
    Afghan, whose name was Racism.
Then she followed Seth across town past twilit alleys of sexism.

The waiter brought menus and announced the day's specials.  He treated
    them with condescending sexism.
So they had another drink.  Tina started her meal with a dish of
    militarism,
While Seth, who was hungrier, had a half portion of stuffed baked
    racism.
Their main dishes were roast duck for Seth, and for Tina broiled
    Marxism-Leninism.
Tina had a pecan pie a la for dessert, Seth a compote of stewed Maoism.
They lingered.  Seth proposed a liqueur.  They rejected sambuca and
    agreed on fascism.

During the meal, Seth took the initiative.  He inquired into Tina's
    fascism,
About which she was rserved, not out of reticence but because Seth's
    sexism
Had aroused in her a desire she felt she should hide -- as though her
    Maoism
Would willy-nilly betray her feelings for him.  She was right.  Even her
    deliberate militarism
Couldn't keep Seth from realizing that his attraction was reciprocated.
    His own Marxism-Leninism
Became manifest, in a compulsive way that piled the Ossa of confusion

Histoire

Tina and Seth met in the midst of an overcrowded militarism.
"Like a drink:" he asked her?  "They make great Alexanders over at the
    Marxism-Leninism."
She agreed.  They shared cocktails.  They behaved cautiously, as in a
    period of pre-fascism.
Afterwards he suggested dinner at a restaurant renowned for its Maoism.
"O,K.," she said, but first she had to phone a friend about her ailing
    Afghan, whose name was Racism.
Then she followed Seth across town past twilit alleys of sexism.

The waiter brought menus and announced the day's specials.  He treated
    them with condescending sexism.
So they had another drink.  Tina started her meal with a dish of
    militarism,
While Seth, who was hungrier, had a half portion of stuffed baked
    racism.
Their main dishes were roast duck for Seth, and for Tina broiled
    Marxism-Leninism.
Tina had a pecan pie a la for dessert, Seth a compote of stewed Maoism.
They lingered.  Seth proposed a liqueur.  They rejected sambuca and
    agreed on fascism.

During the meal, Seth took the initiative.  He inquired into Tina's
    fascism,
About which she was rserved, not out of reticence but because Seth's
    sexism
Had aroused in her a desire she felt she should hide -- as though her
    Maoism
Would willy-nilly betray her feelings for him.  She was right.  Even her
    deliberate militarism
Couldn't keep Seth from realizing that his attraction was reciprocated.
    His own Marxism-Leninism
Became manifest, in a compulsive way that piled the Ossa of confusion
    on the Peleion of racism.

Next, what?  Food finished, drinks drunk, bills paid -- what racism
Might not swamp their yearning in an even greater confusion of fascism?
But women are wiser than words.  Tina rested her hand on his thigh and,
    a-twinkle with Marxism-Leninism,
Asked him, "My place?"  Clarity at once abounded under the flood-lights
    of sexism,
They rose from the table, strode out, and he with the impetuousness of
    young militarism
Hailed a cab to transport them to her lair, heaven-haven of Maoism.

In the taxi he soon kissed her.  She let him unbutton her Maoism
And stroke her resilient skin, which was quivering with shudders of
    racism.
When beneath her jeans he sensed the superior Lycra of her militarism,
His longing almost strangled him.  Her little tongue was as potent as
    fascism
In its elusive certainty.  He felt like then and there tearing off her
sexism,
But he reminded himself:  "Pleasure lies in patience, not in the greedy
    violence of Marxism-Leninism."

Once home, she took over.  She created a hungering aura of Marxism-
    Leninism
As she slowly undressed him where he sat on her overstuffed art-deco
    Maoism.
Making him keep still, so that she could indulge in caresses, in sexism,
In the pursuit of knowing him.  He growned under the exactness of her
    racism
--Fingertip sliding up his nape, nails incising his soles, teeth nibbling

    American militarism.

    Marxism-Leninism,
Easing one thumb into her fascism, with his free hand coddling the tip of
    her Maoism,
Until, gasping with appreciative racism, both together sink into the
    revealed glory of sexism.

CENSORSHIP LAW BLOCKED BY FEDS

        According to Arts Wire <http://www.artswire.org>, a federal judge has
blocked the enforcement of a Michigan law that would have criminalized the
online display or dissemination of "'sexually explicit matter'" to minors. With
his ruling, in which he called the Internet "'an international free flow of
ideas and information,'" Judge Tarnow prevented enforcement of the law until
later this year, when a full trial will be held. Since Web Del Sol is a
plaintiff in this case, we're ecstatic about this first round.


CLERIC SAYS RUSHDIE WAS NOT TO BE KILLED

     The Associated Press notes the August 25th publication of a statement by an
Iranian cleric in which he claims that Rushdie was not condemned to death by the
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini. The Tehran newspaper, Khordad, quoted Hojjat
ol-Islam Seyyed Hoseyn Musavi-Tabrizi as saying that Khomeini's "exact intention
was not the killing of" Rushdie, but rather publicity "to prevent a conspiracy
against Islam." The AP speculates that Musavi-Tabrizi, along with other
supporters of Iranian President Khatami's reforms, is trying to downplay the
fatwa. <http://www.nytimes.com/library/books/082699ap-rushdie-cleric.html>


CORTLAND REVIEW: THE PEOPLE MAGAZINE OF POETRY

    Sol's ex-pat Cyber Rambler <http://webdelsol.com/LITARTS/Cyber_Rambler>
sheds precipitation on the Cortland Review parade--a once highly regarded
webzine, now found wanting in some respects. Whether or not you speedbump on
this one, you'll admit the criticisms are provocative and often painfully
humorous simply because they ring so true. This one in particular will result in
considerable inflammation: "The Cortland Review is all about getting the
unleavened poem to rise,against all odds, without the poetic yeast. It does this
through a painstaking celebration of poet as celebrity, and by the creation of a
kind of I'm Okay You're Okay ambience. It is an approach oddly-or perhaps not so
oddly-reminiscent of People magazine."


TRACE ONLINE WRITING COMMUNITY LOOMS LARGE AT ARTS WIRE

        Also at Arts Wire for the week of August 2 is Sue Thomas's trAce
<http://trace.ntu.ac.uk.> An online writing community, trAce members critique,
read, write, and grouse. The site also features East Midlands Hypertext, a
fesity Call for Opinions, and a virtual writer-in-residence. Current Resident
Christy Sheffield weighs in with the just-launched My Millenium, an 'online
anthology devoted to the subject of time and the digital revolution.'


SMALL FISH STILL KICKING/BIG FISH TURNS INTO A FAT CAT

        In an August 2nd article, Publishers Weekly's John High discusses the
anniveraries of three small (dare I say tiny but fabulous?) presses
<http://www.publishersweekly.com>. Berkeley-based Kelsey Street Press,
founded by Rena Rosenwasser and Patricia Dienstfrey, is celebrating its
twenty-fifth anniversary. A publisher of award-winning poet Mei-mei
Berssenbrugge, Kelsey Street this year sold its archives to UC Berkeley's
Bancroft Library.Colorado-based Johnson Books turns twenty, and Cydney
Chadwick's Avec Books turns seven.

 On the anniversary front as well, Graywolf Press will celebrate its 25th on
September 30th. To be hosted by Robert Pinsky, the event will honor Jane Kenyon
and William Stafford. According to Poets and Writers <http://www.pw.org>,
tickets for the fete are available at the door of Ted Mann Concert Hall at the
University of Minnesota or through the university's ticket office at which can
be reached at (612) 624-2345.

        PW reports also on the founding of Toby Press, launching this fall. The
new house, established in the UK by Matthew Miller, will publish hardcover, new
fiction exclusively and will sell directly to customers through its catalogue,
its web site, and direct mail. Because of its unusual approach, the press is
pouring money into fall advertising in the New Yorker, Granta, and the New York
Times Book Review. Titles slated for fall publication are: Failing Paris, by
Samantha Dunn, Absence, by Raymond Tallis, The Masterpiece, by Anna Enquist,
Cardiofitness, by Allessandra Montrucchio, After the Campfires by Per Jorner,
and The Forwarding Agent, by Austen Kark.

        Meanwhile, HarperCollins has completed its acquisition of Morrow and
Avon from Hearst. (See ELAN #1 for more.) And, in efforts to save money and
maintain more contron over marketing, Harper is forming an in-house advertising
agency.


ALL FEAST NO FAMINE: NEW AT WEB DEL SOL <http://www.webdelsol.com>

        WDS urges to satisfy all moods, open all windows. So prod, observe,
react.  It lives! Editor's Picks Issue 3 <"http://webdelsol.com/Editor">
announces a new era for the publishing of original work at Web Del Sol.  They've
outdone themselves this time.  Thanks to the talented and nonesuch editorial
staff (Mike Neff, Joan Houilihan, Vince Montague, Rachel Callaghan, Paul
Beckman, David Berg-Seiter, Shoshanna Wingate, and Tony Lombardy) the collection
is not only enormous, but unique and diverse.  Who are we talking about?  Dana
Levin, Leslie Scalapino, Lucie Brock-Broido, Charles Bernstein, Lisa Jarnot,
Mark Jarman, Deborah Olin Unferth, Heather McHugh, Flaminia Ocampo, RoseMarie
London, Victoria Redel, Ichi Batacan, Rhina Espaillat, Cecelia Hagen, Wendy
Mnookin, Michael Bugeja, Holly Iglesias, and many more.  Can these guys name
drop or what?

 Most exciting, this past month Web Del Sol was selected and given a stellar
rating by a major Internet review. Access Magazine--a Sunday news supplement
which goes to millions of readers--has named WDS one of their top 100 web sites.
The top three literary 4 stars were WDS, Salon, and Slate. In comparison,
Atlantic Unbound received 3 stars and MoJo Wire only 2.  Not bad for an
organization which receives no grants, sells no advertising, and is composed
solely of volunteers.<http://www.accessmagazine.com/reviews/rev_e-zines.html>

 Five Points has arrived in style, with poetry by Eamon Grennon, Charlie Smith,
and A.E. Stallings, and fiction by Max Garland. This first venture into the WDS
waters highlights Volume 3, Number 3 of the journal.
<http://www.webdelsol.com/Five_Points>

 A grateful Venice thanks TLR for this issue <http://webdelsol.com/tlr> with
contributions by Albert Russo, John Drury, Joan Nilon, and others.  Sample from
La Tempestra, On Not Dying in Venice, The Foot of St. Catherine, and Venetian
Thresholds.  Call the travel agent, balance your credit cards, and let TLR be
your bubble train and gondola

     The summer '99 issue of the New England Review features Tom Paine, John
Poch, and Sue Kwock Kim. NER's archives also provide much good reading.
<http://www.webdelsol.com/New_England_Review>

     The Audio Vault at Conjunctions <http://www.conjunctions.com> is now
featuring Lydia Davis, Mary Caponegro, and Rikki Ducornet reading from their
work. And the upcoming issue, Crossing Over, looks stunning in preview. Look for
excerpts from new novels by Lois-Ann Yamanaka, Paul West, Carole Maso, and
others; poetry by Peter Sacks, Reginald Shepherd, and Arthur Sze; and newly
translated work by Thomas Bernhard.

       As promised, Quarterly West is back--red, revamped, and (safe to say)
better than ever. Because the journal's home institution, the University of
Utah, has switched to a semester schedule, QW will now publish in October and
April. The Spring-Summer '99 Issue features short-shorts by Karen Wolf, Nick
Foster, and Josh Russell; poetry by Jeanne Marie Beaumont, Elizabeth Seydel
Morgan, and Marcus Cafagna; and fiction by Gordon Lish, Sally Bellerose, and
Franklin Fisher. Coming up in QW: winners of the mag's biennial novella contest.
Swing by Quarterly West at <http://www.webdelsol.com/Quarterly_West>.

        Last but so not least, Painted Bride Quarterly
<http://www.webdelsol.com/pbq> needs essays on contemporary cinema, screen play
excerpts, and fiction and poetry influenced by film for their second annual film
issue, which will be published in conjunction with the Philadelphia Festival of
World Cinema. You'll find poetry by Kenneth Bernard and Rocky Wilson; fiction by
Ariana-Sophia M. Kartsonis, and a special film section in the current issue. NB:
when I was a disaffected youth in Philly, I thought that the Painted Bride
(large cavernous arts space, non-virtual) was the coolest place in the world,
and, despite my sullen broodings, turns out I was not far off. Please go visit
them when you can. Thank you.



PAINTED BRIDE QUARTERLY TO FEATURE FILM; INDIEWIRE HELPS SCARE YOU SILLY

        Ah. Having read this far, you know about PBQ already. Should you visit
the City of Brotherly Love, do also visit Cacia's in South Philly for rolls,
rolls, and more rolls. You'll be happy. I hope they're still there--they must
be.

        Indiewire, a comprehensive source for independent film news at
<http://www.indiewire.com>, discusses the phenomenal success of the mock doc
'Blair Witch Project." Also, learn about the appointment of Stephen Gallagher as
the new publisher of Filmmaker magazine.

        According to Arts Wire, the Women's Film Preservation Fund of New York
Women in Film and television seeks proposals for the 'funding of preservation or
restoration of American films in which women had significant creative positions.

YEATS SUMMER SCHOOL OPENS IN SLIGO

        Poetry Daily links to the Irish Times's coverage of the opening of the
Yeats Summer School, now in its thirty-ninth year. Nobel laureate and long-time
attendee Seamus Heaney gave an opening lecture, and Declan Kiberd and Helen
Vendler also were slated to speak. The school draws participants from all over
the world to Sligo.


STEPHEN SPENDER'S PROVENCAL HOME DESTROYED

        Visit Poetry Daily as well for its link to The Times's coverage of the
destruction of Spender's home near Avignon. The Times article quotes Spender's
widow as having lost the late poet's 2,000-book library. His beloved garden and
mementoes of Auden and Isherwood were apparently lost as
well.


WRITERS WRITING/WRITERS TALKING: SUSAN DODD FROM THE NORTH CAROLINA COAST

        Novelist and short-story writer Susan Dodd talks with PublishersWeekly
from her secluded home on a North Carolina island. Not only does she live alone
in a simple house on the shore, she doesn't even have a phone! We love the idea
but would surely die of loneliness. Dodd, evidently made of stronger stuff, has
not. The author, most recently, of The Mourner's Bench, she discusses the
importance of voice, luck, and risk to writers.

I have just rec'd a letter from Cid Corman and his situation does indeed
sound desperate - no money coming in except for charity or loans.

I am taking the liberty of reproducing a small part of the the letter:

"We live modestly and I prefer it so, but homelessness wont [sic] do the
trick and there is that possibility - unless some real help occurs.

I don't like playing the beggar. I'm not good at it. But there is no
choice."

Best way to get him money (it costs him $35.00 to cash a check) is to have
your bank wire it to his bank:

This is for the actual Buffalo-area contingent on the list...I'm planning
to attend the Susan Howe reading there on Friday night, and having never
been to Buffalo before, wanted advice on what to do/where to go.  I know I
want to go to the Poetry Collection in the library, but was wondering how
easy it is to browse through, and how much time I should plan on that.
Then, what are the good bookstores, and where should I eat supper?  I'm
driving in from Syracuse, which has no good bookstores and almost no good
places to eat supper, so I'm hoping for a change of scene...thanks!

If you can't post this to the whole list, could the list moderator please
just answer?

Dodie,

You might want to take a look at Charles Bernstein's syllabus for his Spring
'98 prose seminar. The list of texts and links for weeks 6 and 7 are a good
place to start, though many have some (possibly interesting, but to my mind,
fairly serious) problems - i.e., the way Michael Joyce's writing might be
marshalled into the service of the "new public university"'s
corporate-auxiliary "public-private partnership model." Or Bolter's
over-enthusiastic "hypertext-as-Paolo-Freire-in-a-box" pedagogical
riffing...

A while back I asked for suggestions for a satirical fiction course and
received a lot of good suggestions, so here are a few: Catch 22, Cat's
Cradle and Slaughterhouse 5, Naked Lunch and other Burroughs, early
Ishmael Reed, Crying of Lot 49 and other early Pynchon, One Flew Over the
Cuckoo's Nest, Portnoy's Complaint and other early Roth, late Dawn Powell.
I'm sure there's much more, including Gilbert Sorrentino, Jack Kerouac,
John Barth, Updike.

Pete,

Before I write anyone, help me here, if you can.  I'm not following this line of
accusation.  I need to be clear.

Since we've had involvement in Indonesia, it must be our fault that the
Indonesian army and brother gangs are slaughtering people in churches, hacking
them machetes?  Did they get the machetes from America too?  I suppose if their
govt hadn't bought arms from us years ago then all would be peaceful?  This
sounds naive to the point of absurdity.

I see no connection with what you are saying and the psychotic rampage fest
going on in Timor.  You've noted that Kissinger, etc, visited Timor and then the
slaughters began.  Is there an association here?  If so, can you link it for
me?  I don't see it from what you are saying.

Must we blame the American gov for it, are we compelled?  There are those who
believe the US govt manufactures tornadoes to chase them around and wreck their
barns.  I don't believe that either, but thousands are convinced.

And why should the US support Timor seceding when we didn't support South
Carolina, and certainly don't support Quebec?  Also, plenty of money we send
overseas, in one form or another, gets redirected and wasted.  Witness the
diversion of funds by Russian mafia.   We turned the other way on Savac (sp?) in
Iran, though our intelligence knew they were out of control, but did we do the
same in Indonesia?   And if we did, does this really account for the murdering
we see now?

I'm listening.  Perhaps you can educate me, flow chart me, graph me, time line
me on just how Kissinger, or Clinton or Nixon or Ford or LaRouche or Moynihan or
Chuck Rob or whoever in any conspiratorial setting, ignited and guided the
genocidal gene that compels large groups of people to willfully set fires to
other large groups of people.

Until you do, I'm not writing anyone.

Mike

Hey, I'm not from the Pacific Region, but I have a poem about boxes!

Cheers,
Philip Nikolayev

                BOXES

        Boxes are hoaxes of the imagination,
        they fold out backwards
        and proceed to foreclose themselves
        from the other side
        so as to afford a view,
        which may or may not be outside
        our purview.
        Last night I stared into a box,
        I was like a box within a box,
        boxed in by a larger boxing.
        To establish the level of nesting
        is never possible, but possible is nothing,
        I can box my way
        out of a wet paper bag, but
        bags are not boxes.
        I couldn’t bag my way into
        a dry paper box. The plastic box
        my daughter likes to play with
        at her nine years of age shines
        to a transparency
        no critic has yet dared to problematize.
        Clear rolls the red ball on the gray carpet.
        I am like that too.
        Thus in the box of our life
        trespassing magnolias
        in morganatic obsession bow to me,
        they linger in this miracle lens,
        white and wide void
        of hope. The yellow big
        forsythia too has gone loony
        near the steps of the library.
        Have you seen it
        where for some reason I,
        an atrabilious bastard,
        cast these lines
        across a sky-spotted landscape
        which causes tears to flow
        and cheers to follow
        and wonders where the seagulls go,
        and where the swallow,
        and where the mast,
        all packed away into boxes of memory?
        I open them and close them as I please,
        as if they were divine.
        As the logarithms in my heart click
        with boxes of expectation, so
        the bottleneck of proclivity
        simply turns to the shoebox at the entrance.
        The flowers are still on the floor,
        and then all these boxes of books,
        boxes of knowledge
        in the basement. Why
        do we keep them? Because boxes are peace.
        A blue fox in a black box
        is unknowable.

Carla Harryman
Pamela Lu
=46riday, September 17, 7:30 p.m.

Carla Harryman is as famous for the books she hasn't yet published (such as
her novel in progress, Gardener of Stars, or the collaboration with Lyn
Hejinian, The Wide Road) as for the ones she has. Today we're here to
celebrate the move of one long-awaited work from column A to column B, as O
Books presents us with The Words, Harryman's unique blend of Carl
Sandburg's Rootabaga Tales and Jean-Paul Sartre's The Words. Harryman is
the author of Vice, Animal Instincts, There Never Was a Rose without a
Thorn, and the play Memory Play. With its extended narrative games, its
fateful Sadeian psychology, The Words fractures childhood and conventional
notions of the child, revealing the fever dream of selfhood under the
placid skin of youth, of poetry, of the amused. We've missed her in the Bay
Area since she took off for the wilds of Grosse Pointe, and oh, how we're
glad she's back.


Pamela Lu took Harryman's tentative, ambiguous 'we' and ran with it the
full nine yards in Pamela: a Novel (Atelos), which some critics have
acclaimed as the "last masterpiece of the 20th Century." When you're Pamela
Lu, you have the reclam=E9 of your peers, the admiration of your elders, the
wisdom of one far beyond your years, and a prose style at once grave and
gay, filtered and remarkably direct. You've already grown up in a
"provincial region of Southern California," studied math at UC Berkeley,
moved to the Mission. You co-edit Idiom, the "occasionally productive"
online journal and chapbook press. Your attention has turned to a new blend
of poetry, history, determination and we-ness, "The Accused." To cap it all
off you have joined the board of Small Press Traffic, because, just
because, you're Pamela Lu.

Untitled


With the slightest increase in temperature, a packet is dropped off at a
site of my loved one. It waits, trembling, for others, all organized into
the coherency of beauty, "the harmony of chance and the good" (Simone
Weil). All together, in wonderful bewilderment, they form a whole, their
long and arduous journeys forgotten. How wonderful, my loved one exclaims,
that he has written a letter.

Under what circumstances can we speak for the other? Only in the face and
throes of death, under an alterity permanently limiting, incomprehensible.
Then we may speak, and speak for no one and anyone at all. There, at the
threshold, all speech is permitted; a black ocean laps at the base of the
cliff, its temperature at absolute zero.

I will wait forever from your message, from the community of the dead; I
will wait in your presence, a supplication of chains among chains. I am
lost in empty knowledge. Names are a bother; they shudder against the
pulverization of walls.

Peeling, or turning away, the routers report errors; the reports never
reach you, an expanding shell of packets generated by others lost in the
absence of dreaming.

Billy Little's list is quite comprehensive. Going by the "arbitrary"
guidelines, tho, _On the Road_ is off-limits.
   Are Brits allowed? _The Magus_ and _The Collector_ , both by John
Fowles, if so.
   I see Billy incliudes Canucks, so what were Alice Monroe and Margaret
Atwood publishing in that decade?

Stretching the guidelines, and back in the States, I recommend two by
Gerald Rosen, _Blues for a Dying Nation_ (1972, but written and set in the
60s), and _The Carmen Miranda Memorial Flagpole_ , published in '76 but abt
the death and the survival of the 60s; and v. funny.

Robert Creeley's _The Island_ , 1963.

Charles Potts, _Valga Crusa_ (= _Shit Crackers_ + _The Yellow Christ_
)..THE definitive novel/s of Berkeley in the 60s from the p-o-v of a
drugged-up street-poet. O.P.,but possibly available from the author, now
resident in Wash state. I can put you in touch w him.

| Pete,
| Since we've had involvement in Indonesia, it must be our fault that the
| Indonesian army and brother gangs are slaughtering people in churches,
hacking
| them machetes?  Did they get the machetes from America too?  I suppose if
their
| govt hadn't bought arms from us years ago then all would be peaceful?
This
| sounds naive to the point of absurdity.

All might be more peaceful if the Indonesian occupation of East Timor had
not been recognised by USA and UK, "my" country, Australia and so many
others; and the murderers in Indonesia might be less formidable if they had
not been trained by "the West"

| Must we blame the American gov for it, are we compelled?

it is too simplistic to do so. But the USA government is deeply implicated
and I do not accept the arguments coming from USA or UK to explain why it is
right to have bombed Iraq and Serbia, but to haver over other countries...
the degree of implication would be quite enough for a citizen to be
convicted of complicity in a UK or USA court

| And why should the US support Timor seceding when we didn't support South
| Carolina, and certainly don't support Quebec?

Why did the US government  - and UK etc - support Timor being occupied? If
they hadn't been occupied, within my lifetime, they wouldn't have to
"secede"

| I'm listening.  Perhaps you can educate me, flow chart me, graph me, time
line
| me on just how Kissinger, or Clinton or Nixon or Ford or LaRouche or
Moynihan or
| Chuck Rob or whoever in any conspiratorial setting, ignited and guided the
| genocidal gene that compels large groups of people to willfully set fires
to
| other large groups of people.

do you mean like the use of napalm in Vietnam (or other weapons producing
fire in Iraq, or Serbia) or are you thinking of a different more acceptable
form of setting fire to people? do tell

Michael --

I understand that you may think that the connections between the US and
East Timor are tenuous, at best, but, like many poems, there is much
operating below what appears to be flat surfaces.  US involvement in
Indonesia -- not even counting the massacre of 1 million in the overthrow
of Sukarno -- goes back to Kissinger, when Indonesia decided to annex East
Timor, muting the US response and preventing the UN or anyone else from
intervening, then strengthening aid to the Suharto regime.  All of this
flows from Cold War logic -- particularly when other newly independent
Portuguese colonies such as Angola and Mozambique were displaying too
much independence.  East Timor was an annexation by force of a people with
a different colonial history and different identity, so it is not quite
the same as the examples you gave.  The international community condemned
the annexation, and after decades of massacres the East Timorese finally
got their chance to vote for independence -- and took it.  All of this
exposes decades of American complicity and double standards.  No, the
militia thugs are not Americans -- and they are accountable -- and neither
were the tonton macoutes in Haiti, but America bears much responsibility
there as well.  I hope this helps clarify the situation a little for you.

Incidentally, isn't it about time that Kissinger was arrested for war
crimes?

sound desperate - no money coming in except for charity or loans.

I am taking the liberty of reproducing a small part of the the letter:

trick and there is that possibility - unless some real help occurs.

I don't like playing the beggar. I'm not good at it. But there is no

Mike, Pete, etc. - I suppose this line is perhaps my responsibility, so let
me explicate some basic notions here, as quickly as I can.

>Since we've had involvement in Indonesia, it must be our fault that the
Indonesian army and brother gangs are slaughtering people in churches,
hacking them machetes?


I think this question oversimplifies the issue.  I was addressing complicity
and support and motives and awareness.  The Indonesians and Americans and
Australians all have a share in the responsibility, and to reduce it to
"fault" of one group would be irresponsible.  I encouraged Pete to include
the US accountability.

>Did they get the machetes from America too?

No, but the militias are there with US and Australian financial and military
support.  And it's not all machetes.  I believe that your point about who is
actually doing the killing is an excellent one, but sometimes people can
strongly shape an environment and give orders in exchange for something.  If
this were not the case then perhaps humans would have never known war.

>I suppose if their govt hadn't bought arms from us years ago then all would
>be peaceful?

Actually, yes.  The East Timorese were pretty much left alone by the
Portuguese. The East Timorese were a primitive culture in the sense that
they didn't have guns or television or refrigerators; they were tribal and
isolated from the industrialized world.  The US and Australia knew of the
vast amount of wealth in the Timor Gap, but couldn't get to it, b/c that
would have started a war with Portugal.  When Portugal left, there was
suddenly an angle that could be played.  The US could not afford to deply
its own troops, largely b/c of the Vietnam legacy, and also b/c they had
someone, namely Suharto, who could do the dirty work for them, keeping the
US squeaky clean.    Besides, the US wished to prove that it was not
abandoning its attempt to control SE Asia, as is reflected in several
presidential memos during the time of these visits that you were referring
to.

The US put Suharto in power; he was a US puppet leader.  Indonesia is still
pretty much a US puppet today.  And Australia isn't going to go against
American interests, if one realistically asseses the nature of modern
geopolitics.  They share too many interests.

>This
sounds naive to the point of absurdity.

It sounds like you have an a priori here that is untouchable.  Your belief
sounds naive to my ears.  Naive, but from what perspective?  "Ignorance is
Strength"?  "2+2=5"?

>I see no connection with what you are saying and the psychotic rampage fest
>going on in Timor.

It is a calculated psychotic rampage.  You don't have to see it; the world
will go on without your seeing it.  Though it would be better if you could
see it.  The rampage is funded and it has a history of complicity and
support.  The militias are either indonesians/jakartans that have settled
there, finding pay as mercenaries, or even some east timorese deeply scarred
from the concentration camp environment they grew up in.  Keep in mind that
the killing has been much much much worse in the past than it is now; also
remember that the east timorese were hereded and slaughtered like cattle so
that the indonesians could settle there and erase the history of the East
Timorese.  It is incredible how resilient and strong the East Timorese
people have proven themselves.

>You've noted that Kissinger, etc, visited Timor and then the
slaughters began.  Is there an association here?  If so, can you link it for
me?

Kissinger and Scowcroft, as representatives of the NSA (though they were
also cabinet members) went with Ford on several occasions to visit with
Suharto.  Following the first visit, Indonesia deployed mercenaries into
East Timor.  the last visit (Dec. 6, 1975) presaged the full fledged
invasion the following day.  Suahrto worked for the US government, and the
connection being made here, I leave to you to make for yourself.  the US
media practically ignored the slaughter that followed for the next 4 years.
some australian reporters made it in to report the concentration camps, the
genocide, and most of those reporters were murdered.  Now why would the US
media ignore the slaughter?  When you look at the companies invested in the
exploration of the Timor Gap, their board of directors, and their
advertising dollars, and the dead reporters trying to reveal the truth, you
can then perhaps start to imagine why coverage starts to disappear.

>Must we blame the American gov for it, are we compelled?
And why should the US support Timor seceding when we didn't support South
Carolina, and certainly don't support Quebec?

The US government does not support complete secession of East Timor.  But,
25 years of slaughter hasn't tamed the populace.  Indonesian rule isn't
working, clearly.  And complete East Timorese independence would be a
financial disaster for Phillips 66, BHP, Chevron, Texaco, and several other
large companies invested in the exploitation of the Timor Gap, which rests
completely on treaties between Australia and Indonesia.  And who sits on the
board of directors of these companies?  People from the Dep't of Defense,
Boeing, Lockheed Martin, Knight ridder, Time Warner, Weyerhauser, former
Secretaries of State, and on and on.  The solution, therefore, is US
military presence.  replacing one invasion (the indonesian invasion) with
another.  Perhaps we are going to do good and keep the peace.  Most likely a
new wave of rebels will disappear and these treaties will be protected or
revised so that these companies will still get their share and the East
timorese will get nothing but a destroyed environment and exploitation.
That's capitalism.

Are we compelled?  I am compelled.  Completely.  And many other informed
parties are as well.

>but did we do the same in Indonesia?   And if we did, does this really
>account for the murdering we see now?

Yes, at least partially.  First, it was never a matter of us just turning
our backs; the US government supported it financially and with military
training and intelligence. I blame the idiots running around with machetes
just as much as I blame the people who set up the power relation structure
in the region.  Sadly, the implication of this is that there may never be a
good resolution.  The US will not let its investments collapse, and if the
US did, political heads will roll.  Money talks.

I ask you, for example, if you gave a starving person a gun, a person you
starved, told him that there's food at the end of the road inside someone's
house, and promised him that if he went and fed himself by using that gun to
get to the food then you would give him $100, who do you blame?  Just blame
the beggar?  Just blame the deal maker?  Both the dealmaker and the beggar
are to blame here.  But if the beggar was starved by the dealmaker in the
first place, then, i think that blame is a personal decision.

And that's if we just stick to blame.  Why not use the past, use history and
its obscured truths just to inform our present and future decisions?  Like
by encouraging a UN peacekeeping force without participation from the US,
Australia, Britain, New Zealand?  I'm not really into blame.  I like to be
informed and make good decisions and encourage others to do the same.  I'm
not for throwing anyone in jail here.  I'd just like the cycle of atrocities
and exploitation to stop.

There's so much history that has led up to this and it is very hard to get
any information on how arms are flowing, dollars are being spent, behind the
scenes exchanges, etc.  Some of us do our best to research what is going on,
and admittedly the research is never perfect or unbiased.  My bias is that
western exploitation of third world nations for export crops and mineral/oil
resources and/or drugs, and the deliberate provocation of politically
explosive situations for the sake of increasing arms sales is intolerable.
I wished that my country represented democracy and the values of freedom it
claims to represent; it is clear that i can no longer naively cling to such
a belief.

I encourage all of you to use your search engines and research this stuff
for yourself, and to trust your faculties and connections in separating the
reliable information from the crap.  I also encourage you to share the
information about what really is happening; I can promise you NBC, The New
York Times, and CNN will not.

A few points:

1) Kissinger's "visit" was considerably more instrumental than the
"chat-and-tea" image might otherwise conjure one to believe. It was rather,
the U.S. State Department's imprimatur and guarantee of military assistance
to a regime embarked on a series of "policy initiatives" which included,
most notably, a) the slaughter and forced relocation of much of its own
peasantry, labor leaders and movement members, intellectuals, etc., in the
name of a defense against communism; and b) the invasion and annexation of
Timor, resulting in a brutal occupation which left nearly a quarter of a
million dead. This, while the U.S. (among others - recently, the role of
Japan and Australia would also bear some scrutiny) continued (and continues,
notwithstanding Clinton's half-assed "retraction of assistance") to provide
the proverbial "military, technical and economic aid" to the Indonesian
regime. This isn't a matter of having bought arms years ago, but one of
receiving - until this week, and that only if Clinton's retraction is to
taken at face value - ongoing direct support from the U.S. and other
armaments-producing nations. Thus, while the machetes might be a domestic
industry in Indonesia, the rifles, troop transport vehicles, paramilitary
training, etc., most certainly are not. This aid has been continued under
recent administrations with the rationalization that it's the Indonesian
military itself that can be counted on to bring the militias back into line.
For the sheer ridiculousness of this claim, if one still needs it
substantiated, one  might turn to Alan Nairn's recent reports on Pacifica
Radio, detailing the intimate relationship between the army and the
militias. But other sources are many and well-documented. If you have web
access, you might take a look at the East Timor Action Network's web site:
www.etan.org
2) The above would seem to have some bearing on your assertion that East
Timor is attempting to "secede" from a legitimate national government -
which is simply not the case. East Timor, as an Indonesian territory, is the
result of a forcible annexation sponsored by U.S. and other interests. Many
of the key figures in the initial "sponsorship" remain in positions of power
today. In other words, this is about as far from a quixotic attempt to
rectify a distant and tragic "other-people's" history as you can get.
3) You ask: "We turned the other way on Savac we see now (sp?) in Iran,
though our intelligence knew they were out of control, but did we do the
same in Indonesia?   And if we did, does this really account for the
murdering we see now?" Yes. Absolutely. As I've pointed out, this isn't
simply a case of turning the other way, but a direct outgrowth of deliberate
policies of military and economic support pursued by the U.S., Japan and
other militarized nations. And although the point has now been reached at
which the killings more than likely cannot be stopped without some sort of
direct intervention, the extreme probability was, until quite recently, that
the Indonesian regime simply could not have pursued its policies of
aggression without the direct support of the U.S. and its allies - that, in
other words, the annexation itself would have been unfeasible and
unsustainable without that aid. Until very recently, a cut-off of such
support might have sufficed to avert the campaign of terror now being
pursued. There is no "genocidal gene" - and such pseudo-explanations
("they're just nuts _over there_, who can understand their motivations?"),
I'd warrant, most often mark the site of a real and determinate chain of
events, the complicity of one's own nation in which is precisely what the
resort to racialized typologies attempts to obscure.

Pete,

Before I write anyone, help me here, if you can.  I'm not following this
line of
accusation.  I need to be clear.

Since we've had involvement in Indonesia, it must be our fault that the
Indonesian army and brother gangs are slaughtering people in churches,
hacking
them machetes?  Did they get the machetes from America too?  I suppose if
their
govt hadn't bought arms from us years ago then all would be peaceful?  This
sounds naive to the point of absurdity.

I see no connection with what you are saying and the psychotic rampage fest
going on in Timor.  You've noted that Kissinger, etc, visited Timor and then
the
slaughters began.  Is there an association here?  If so, can you link it for
me?  I don't see it from what you are saying.

Must we blame the American gov for it, are we compelled?  There are those
who
believe the US govt manufactures tornadoes to chase them around and wreck
their
barns.  I don't believe that either, but thousands are convinced.

And why should the US support Timor seceding when we didn't support South
Carolina, and certainly don't support Quebec?  Also, plenty of money we send
overseas, in one form or another, gets redirected and wasted.  Witness the
diversion of funds by Russian mafia.   We turned the other way on Savac
(sp?) in
Iran, though our intelligence knew they were out of control, but did we do
the
same in Indonesia?   And if we did, does this really account for the
murdering
we see now?

I'm listening.  Perhaps you can educate me, flow chart me, graph me, time
line
me on just how Kissinger, or Clinton or Nixon or Ford or LaRouche or
Moynihan or
Chuck Rob or whoever in any conspiratorial setting, ignited and guided the
genocidal gene that compels large groups of people to willfully set fires to
other large groups of people.

Until you do, I'm not writing anyone.

Mike

We didn't "cause" it, but we've certainly been an enabling factor: we have
registered little complaint when East Timor was annexed and its people
slaughtered (some 200,000) of them over the years, ditto the situation in
Irian Jaya, ditto the slaughter of ethnic Chinese. Instead, we have
consistently stroked the Indonesian govt for being anticommunist, and that
stroking has taken the form of ytraining and supplying their military,
contributing greatly to its ability to overwhelm the rest of govt.

Yes, indeed. Please see the latest issue of The Nation for more on current
US involvement in Indonesia:

http://www.thenation.com/
US COMPLICITY IN EAST TIMOR
Although the US government has reprimanded Indonesia for the militias'
campaign of terror in East Timor, the US military has, behind the scenes and
contrary to Congressional intent, been backing the Indonesian Army. Allan
Nairn filed this first-hand report from Dili, East Timor

Mike,

Sounds like you're cutting flame-bait to me. To support your
viewpoint you'd have to argue that the US habit of providing
financial and military support to dictatorial governments in the
Third World (as long as they are willing to support our economic
interests) has no bearing on our moral or ethical responsibilities in
those regions.  From what you say, it shouldn't matter that in
country after country we are willing to prop up unpopular regimes
(and occasionally invent and install them) to serve our economic and
political interests despite popular resistance to externally imposed
structures of authority. Asking Pete to "educate" you on this topic
is sidestepping your own responsibility to defend your position of
non-involvement. He provided you with URLS--I have no doubt that
you're educated enough to read them, come to your own conclusions and
then "educate" *Peter* if you so choose.

I haven't posted to POETICS in ages because the level of discourse
here usually winds up pissing me off if I get involved, despite the
fact that I'm a publisher of poetry and that really this *ought* to
be a place I'm comfortable hanging out. When somebody on POETICS
posts something that somebody else doesn't like (particularly on
political grounds) the common tactic on this list is to snidely and
sarcastically attack the intelligence of the poster, and rarely ever
to directly engage their political arguments. I like political
arguments and I think they're related to poetry. What I don't like is
the very nasty tone of intellectual and moral superiority wielded by
some (usually more conservative) members to silence others here. It
takes more work to make your own argument, Peter, than to sneer at
someone else's argument.

Receding into silence once again,
Kali

Perhaps only when someone bursts the bubble of the New Model Poetics Army
do we get down to actually conversing with each other. My guess is, it's
less likely that Mike Neff doubts the complicity of the US in evil deeds
than that he found the assumption of privilege regarding "the real story"
to be unwarranted. I guess it's too much to ask of the medium that we not
post initially in haste. But it's heartening to see this thread become an
exchange not a flame war.

or http://landow.stg.brown.edu/cpace/cspaceov.html

his book _Hyper/Text/Theory_ is good for beginning work

"Meditations on First Cybersophy" is an example from the Brown website
suggesting possibilities for critical work in the HT format

"The Interactive Story"
http://ma.hrc.wmin.ac.uk/ma.theory.3.2.1.db

Joyce's "Twelve Blue" is available on-line
http://www.eastgate.com/TwelveBlue/ (good for an introduction, though i
agree with Taylor there's probs with Eastgate)

other sites that might appeal:
Building Babel http://www.peg.apc.org/~spinifex/babelbuildingsite.html
Lies http://www.users.interport.net/~rick/lies/lies.htm

i also like to send students to a brief article i found on Ramelli's
"Reading Wheel," a prototype hypertext machine designed in the 16h c.

Does anyone know specifics re: the role of Indonesian General Wiranto in the
recent events unfolding in East Timor?  Wiranto, among those who "got" the
message the West was "sending" (ie its nervousness over the Asian economic
situation), was apparently the man who gently suggested through mutual
friends that Suharto step down in May 98.  What role does the army play in
Indonesian internal politics?  Is it as in Turkey, to "guarantee" the
continuity of a secular state in a highly religious society?  I woldn't put
it past Wiranto to be using this ploy as a cloak for some heavy business
glad-handing with anyone who comes down the pike, not just the Americans &
UK or the West in general, but anyone willing to play his own essentially
powerless hand in Wiranto's game.  There's no reason for him to have
political ambitions, since he's already at the top of the heap (yet hiding
beneath its statistics). Somebody's making a pile of money on the piles of
bodies, but the question remains, who is it?  & specifically how are they
doing it?  Weapons trade, sure, but ...
protection money protects just what, exactly?  Talk abt Investigative Poetry
- this isn't just a job for Ed Sanders or Superman, but for everyone, like,
go figure, who's who and why they ACT that way behind the scenes while up
front the explanations and solutions are as sweet as the ring of your old
time Burroughs cash register to the ear of Pavlov's Dog.

Thanks to whoever mentioned Kotzwinkle's _Fan Man_ (though I thought that
was '70s)--I read it years ago, and laughed till I cried.  Had forgotten all
about it.  Didn't he write _E.T._?  Weird.

Don't know if someone else has already mentioned it, but in terms of popular
longevity alone (not to mention its elevation of sentimentality and
anti-intellectualism to a truly sublime level), Daniel Keyes' _Flowers for
Algernon_ is essential.

I also like Updike's _Rabbit, Run_ and (maybe even more) _Rabbit Redux_ (is
that still 60's?).  I'm betting nobody else nominated those.

There is finally an edition in paperback of Melvin Tolson's poems, or at
least most of them.  Just out from University of Virginia Press is
<underline>"Harlem Gallery" and Other Poems of Melvin B.
Tolson.</underline> The book includes the three volumes that were
published during Tolson's life, along with a few magazine pieces that had
not been collected, including the crucial "E. & O. E." which appeared in
<underline>Poetry</underline> in 1951.  The new edition includes Tolson's
notes to <underline>Libretto for the Republic of Liberia</underline> and
new annotations to <underline>Harlem Gallery</underline>, provided by the
editor, Raymond Nelson.  What is not included are the earlier poems that
appeared a few years ago as <underline>A Gallery of Harlem
Portraits</underline> and some fugitive poems.  There will be two
previously unpublished Tolson poems in an anthology that I am editing
with Lauri Ramey that Alabama will publish soon.


If you've never read Tolson, get this book now.  And I hope all of you
who've been asking for years why his books are out of print will now
adopt this book for your courses.



Watch this space for future news of a selected Tolson writings that will
collect an interesting sampling of his prose work.

I'm not an expert on East Timor/Indonesian politics and don't claim to be.  I am
commenting specifically on attempts to directly link the US govt (parties,
individuals, policies, some combo thereof) and specific actions or inactions on
its part  to these current manifestations of acute human barbarism.  At worst/best
then, we are "enabling" to some degree that cannot be measured.  However, can one
state for certainty that US "involvement" was *necessary* to provoke the killing
fields in this case?

In other words, must the US be a factor in enabling socio-psychotic behavior
(documented throughout history beginning with the Assyrians most notably?) or can
it take place independent of the US?  And if we admit it can take place
independent of the US, or has taken place independent of the US, or will take
place independent of the US, can we state with certainty that this particular
plague demands US "enabling" behavior?

Or could it have happened anyway?

Are there forces, cultures, history, hatreds inherent to the land there that play
a factor?  That might even dwarf or render any US enabling inconsequential?

Back to my point about the machetes.  These were not funded by the US govt.  Arms
or not, they have enough arms left to kill.  As far as these other tragic
situations around the globe, are we responsible, enabling all those too, perhaps
because we cannot play our role as global policeman too well?   I'm perplexed.
Perhaps this is exactly why we shouldn't be global policemen.  Too much blame, too

Todd,

I've spoken with Dewey five times since he has been on vacation and he keeps
saying he's doing something. It really grinds me. I have been at the
hospital with Philip everyday almost for the last two weeks and trying to
get this together, printed a program, contacted everyone, gonna drive to LA,
renting hotel rooms and all this stuff and it does give me heartache. Of
course, if you're having a baby, conratulations, that does not fall into the
same category of things, and you can post me by e-mail, I'll bring my laptop
with me. Below is the information. I thought I sent it to you. I've send
press information to the magazines. Also, the announcement of the event has
been on the Big Bridge home page for the last four months minus Philomene
Long and John Thomas. Well, I guess I just go with it because it will do me
no good to get anymore stressed or tired about it. Keep me posted on the
good things going on for you this week. Best, MR

I don't doubt what you are saying about Kissinger, policies, support, yadda yadda.

This isn't my point.  We're off track.  My comments were directed to this
statement by Peter Spence: "It may also be just as good and probably easier to
protest the American gov't for their ongoing role in the slaughter and oppression
of the East Timorese."

The words "ongoing role in the slaughter and oppression" makes me think that like
Nazis in the Ukraine, we are there with a policy which places active operatives in
the field who are promoting and directing hacking gangs, resident psychos, and
Indonesian army units to slaughters, rapine, burnings, church massacres, etc. etc.
etc.

US doesn't have to grant imprimatur to any dictator to begin slaughter, forced
relocations, tortures, etc.  This kind of thing happens all the time and is
happening in other places and climes without imprimaturs.  The dictator, the state
is imprimatur in of itself and always has been, an arrogance which breeds
intolerance at best and secret police mechanisms at worst.  Such bodies and
culture require no Madeline Albright, Kissinger, Ford, or whoever to lend them
authority to oppress.

But here is a statement I wish to challenge:

"... a direct outgrowth of deliberate policies of military and economic support
pursued by the U.S., Japan and
other militarized nations. And although the point has now been reached at
which the killings more than likely cannot be stopped without some sort of
direct intervention, the extreme probability was, until quite recently, that
the Indonesian regime simply could not have pursued its policies of
aggression without the direct support of the U.S. and its allies - that, in
other words, the annexation itself would have been unfeasible and
unsustainable without that aid."

Now, wait a minute.  Let's reality check.

What we're talking about is a relatively unsophisticated third world military
apparatus (not a crack group like Hitler's SS divisions, Iraq's Guards--an
outgrowth of the Ten Thousand Immortals; or US Seals, etc.) and some machete
wielding, body gutting thugs of a paramilitary nature common under many
conditions, who are in unison attacking a virtually defenseless populace.

Is that not so?  Are they facing a line of troops who are harrying their flanks,
threatening their lines, an army or resisting force which makes "simply could not
have pursued" without US/Japan/etc help and a priori statement?

It looks to me like forced takeover requires only a savage will to see it through,
not smart bombs.  It's happened many times before, and will again.

That Speck There

reasonable radicalism resists the saturation point.
bringing with this item another fanatical
reference work known to
explode out of all
proportion to dullards. the sense of
excuse will be fried on your
next trip into town. when you say
"there is no town"
it fills me gravely with
antsiness. like, how can voiceover prove
my worth? I got together with
mainlines forever, without
refusing to water the dog. now
it's on other terms, the sort that
render fat like an
idea. I have no idea
personally, but seem to sing in the shower. when done
there is no history to fall
back on, just bathmats and the like.
and that's so telling, a full spectrum
poetry that believes the communal
grope has much to do with
issues of darkness. lights are for losers,
so ordinary. the tribe lives tribal
because definitions last. yes, anything defined will
remain so until redefined. that's my awning, where do you
keep yours? I ask rhetorically
since what purpose would there
be to remember anything, dreams included?
to assert a factual basis for every
your declaration simply masks the boundaries with
dressy new ones. meanwhile
the reference point goes walkabout. so
why get tired, why give up? the throng
has my watch, or watches me, or what
is a thatched hut nowadays?
my sermon, my sense, and heaven prove
reliant

Dear Patrick,

I'm not going to debate your very thorough knowledge of this region of the earth
and your considerable insight into the secret workings of the US Govt, Chevron,
NBC news, etc. etc and their various and ongoing collusions.  I've heard formula
explanations of various oil company/media/govt conspiracies being responsible
for all sorts of behavioral phenomena, just as I have heard individuals far less
erudite than yourself claim space aliens are responsible for a wide range of
other phenomena.  I myself grew up believing that the govt/media covered up
Bermuda Triangle truths, etc.  I'm not saying this matter is in the same league,
don't get me wrong.  I'm just saying I'm hearing some familiar themes here.

I'll tell you emphatically that I do *not* get my news from CNN, NBC, etc.
During the Kosovo crisis, e.g., I watched far more interesting French coverage
(they even interviewed a British officer).  But I'll reestablish the context,
make a few points, and then let it go.

First, and again, I have been hearing oil company/USGovt/etc theories to explain
a wide spectrum of antisocial behaviors around the earth and I don't always buy
it, and I'm not totally buying it now, IN THE CONTEXT OF the homicidal group
behavior there.  And that is my point exactly.  Occam's Razor, the
Japan/US/NBC/Chevron formal or informal infrastructure of conspiracy is not
necessary to explain the rampaging militia and military.  This is not to say
components of these nebulous groups (like clouds, they dissolve the closer you
look) are not involved in Indonesia to various degrees, they are, of course!
Who can deny that?  And they are involved in ways you enlighten us to.

Second, I become suspicious when explanations of group/national/tribe behaviors,
esp pronounced psychotic ones on such a grand and incredibly savage scale, don't
include local culture, socio-psych, or other factors to account for them.
Surely, there is a synergy here, a harmonious convergence of psychotic gravities
which should be noted and divulged.  This harping on the US, oil companies,
Japan, macro international political models, etc. don't serve to explain the
killer hysteria and frenzy.   This is what I am getting at.  Believe me Patrick,
the US Govt is far, far more stupid than malevolent.  It requires planning and
skill to be intentionally malevolent.

Lets look at a few quotes here:

"The Indonesians and Americans and
Australians all have a share in the responsibility, and to reduce it to
"fault" of one group would be irresponsible.  I encouraged Pete to include
the US accountability."

I say it goes far deeper than this.  These models of yours are insufficient to
explain the group behavior.

"The East Timorese were pretty much left alone by the
Portuguese."

That's a shocker.  Why didn't the Portugese turn them into slaves like they did
so many others?

"The East Timorese were a primitive culture in the sense that
they didn't have guns or television or refrigerators; they were tribal and
isolated from the industrialized world."

Then no wonder the US had to throw so much gun money to Indonesia.

"The US and Australia knew of the vast amount of wealth in the Timor Gap, but
couldn't get to it, b/c that would have started a war with Portugal."

Yes, war with Portugal would have been disastrous, like the mouse who roared.
Hell, Portugal is poor, why didn't we just bribe them like everyone else?
Surely Chevron had enough moolah.

"The US put Suharto in power; he was a US puppet leader."

As in Vietnam, "puppet" leaders often become less so when they realize they are
regarded as puppet leaders.  Open the history books.  The so called puppet
status is always exaggerated.  Strings can and are broken.

" Indonesia is still
pretty much a US puppet today.  And Australia isn't going to go against
American interests, if one realistically asseses the nature of modern
geopolitics.  They share too many interests."

Australia has gone against US interests in the region plenty of times.  I'm not
buying that argument.

"It is a calculated psychotic rampage.  You don't have to see it; the world
will go on without your seeing it.  Though it would be better if you could
see it.  The rampage is funded and it has a history of complicity and
support.  The militias are either indonesians/jakartans that have settled
there, finding pay as mercenaries, or even some east timorese deeply scarred
from the concentration camp environment they grew up in.  Keep in mind that
the killing has been much much much worse in the past than it is now;"

Yes, of course it is calculated.  I do see it.  The world goes on anyway.
You're touching on the local politics now, setting the scene, a scene which
requires no US govt to ignite the killings.

"Kissinger and Scowcroft, as representatives of the NSA (though they were
also cabinet members) went with Ford on several occasions to visit with
Suharto.  Following the first visit, Indonesia deployed mercenaries into
East Timor.  the last visit (Dec. 6, 1975) presaged the full fledged
invasion the following day."

I'm going to stop here.  I don't know that these two were "representatives" of
the NSA.  What do you mean by representatives?  You mean operatives, don't you?
How could the NSA select "representatives" in the common sense of the word?  I'm
not buying that.  I thought NSA was subject to guys like Kissinger, not the
other way around.  But that must be my naivety again.  So what you are implying
is that the NSA sanctioned the invasion of Timor, planned it, carried it off for
the sake of ... Chevron?  For black gold of course.  Why else do nations play
dirty.  Well, why did such a high profile visit have to take place for all to
see?  Why didn't the NSA just pick up the phone and say go get 'em, or Chevron
for that matter?  Kissinger had to give his facetoface blessing, I suppose?

"I wished that my country represented democracy and the values of freedom it
claims to represent; it is clear that i can no longer naively cling to such
a belief."

I don't believe that either Patrick, I just think your explanations are formula
in some respects and inadequate to explain the condition of group killing
psychosis.

the australian input just adds to the suspicion here that everyone in the UN
and other involved governments are acting as slow as they can all of them to
punish the east timorese for voting the way they did...a lot of australians
are absolutely frustrated at the "ready to go" has gotten longer to "go'
whyche means more deaths etc i really find it all very ugly//pete spence

1._Poor Cow_ by Nell Dunn. A novel about young working class gals in London
in the 60s (pubbed then too , and also a BBC film I think).
(2.) Also Nell Dunn's _Talking to Women_, interviews with "regular" and
writer women of the 60s. Unknown poets, and Edna O'Brien. Very intriguing
period piece.
3._In Watermelon Sugar_ by Richard Brautigan.
4. _Truck_ by Katharine Dunn. I think this was pubbed in 1970. FABULOUS girl
road novel, total interiority/exteriority mix, pre-Geek Love.

Sounds like a nifty class!

We have some very interesting writers coming to read at Syracuse
University this fall as part of the Raymond Carver Living Writers series.
All readings are at 5:45 PM, proceeded by a Q&A with undergrads who are in
the Living Writers class and followed by private dinners out with the
writer and Syracuse MFA students.  If people are interested in making the
(schleppy) trip, I'd be happy to play hostess or at least meet up.

In Grant Auditorium in the Law Building at Syracuse University.

Tonight:  Malena Morling, poet, author of Ocean Avenue (New Issues)

9/29 -- Diane Williams, fiction writer, author of Excitability (Dalkey?)

10/13 -- poet Kimiko Hahn

11/3 -- Edwidge Danticat, novelist

11/17 -- William Gass (!!)

12/8 -- our very own Brooks Haxton, who has a book of Greek translations
coming out


C'est tout.

Despite your will to believe otherwise, the fact remains that without the
$1.1 billion dollars of direct U.S. weapons sales to Indonesia since 1975,
without the U.S. continually blocking the implementation of U.N. resolutions
against Indonesia's occupation, and particularly without the doubling of the
military aid budget which was the tangible product of Kissinger's
house-call, the invasion never would have happened in the first place. To
leap from this to one of Stephen Ellis' questions, my guess is that the
"interested parties" - i.e., those who stood to gain - included the usual
roster of arms manufacturers, but also and in a more scalar sense the same
oil and mineral corporations currently propping up the occupation of Irian
Jaya. I'm looking into this and will hopefully get back to the list with
names in a day or two...

Back, for the moment and for the last time, to the denials: The
mass-mediated attempt to portray the current crisis as simply a matter of
gangs of thugs running amok is precisely an attempt to let those larger
interests off the hook. As I wrote before, the link between the militias and
the Indonesian armed forces has been amply demonstrated. Beyond this, the
more visibly brutal attacks by the militias are being used as an excuse in
most of the corporate media outlets for not attending to the larger-scale
"operations" being carried out by the armed forces themselves - forced
relocation of thousands of Timorese to camps in West Timor at the moment,
not to mention the hundreds of thousands killed during the occupation.
Murder and political violence against an entire society on that scale simply
didn't happen through the disorganized rioting of "some machete wielding,
body gutting thugs" - and it's here that the U.S. emerges as most fully
complicit in its role as bankroller (shored up the military budget, helped
guarantee World Bank and IMF monies, etc.), drill sergeant (trained the
military, especially the upper echelons - there are your "operatives in the
field"), and international spin doctor (kept the rest of the UN at bay). And
while Habibie has expressed his acquiescence to UN intervention, General
Wiranto is on record as refusing to leave the armed forces' "brothers in
arms" (i.e., the militias) alone in East Timor - and this, despite the lack
of any organized armed resistance.

But enough. To reiterate Kali Tal's point: other posts have provided the
information and the citations necessary to "make the link." That you choose
to disregard them, or deliberately misread them, is lamentable, but there's
nothing to be done about that. Nor would I have it any other way. I leave
you to your inalienable right to remain aloof, and to the sanctity of your
belief in the mystical spontaneity of political violence. Because I've seen
flame wars in this space before, and because, questions of etiquette aside,
I doubt whether they have any political efficacy beyond the
self-congratulatory, I will henceforth restrict my involvement in this
thread to posting the aforementioned link(s) and name(s).

Subject:        Re: I can't believe it!!!

I don't doubt what you are saying about Kissinger, policies, support, yadda
yadda.

This isn't my point.  We're off track.  My comments were directed to this
statement by Peter Spence: "It may also be just as good and probably easier
to
protest the American gov't for their ongoing role in the slaughter and
oppression
of the East Timorese."

The words "ongoing role in the slaughter and oppression" makes me think that
like
Nazis in the Ukraine, we are there with a policy which places active
operatives in
the field who are promoting and directing hacking gangs, resident psychos,
and
Indonesian army units to slaughters, rapine, burnings, church massacres,
etc. etc.
etc.

US doesn't have to grant imprimatur to any dictator to begin slaughter,
forced
relocations, tortures, etc.  This kind of thing happens all the time and is
happening in other places and climes without imprimaturs.  The dictator, the
state
is imprimatur in of itself and always has been, an arrogance which breeds
intolerance at best and secret police mechanisms at worst.  Such bodies and
culture require no Madeline Albright, Kissinger, Ford, or whoever to lend
them
authority to oppress.

But here is a statement I wish to challenge:

"... a direct outgrowth of deliberate policies of military and economic
support
pursued by the U.S., Japan and
other militarized nations. And although the point has now been reached at
which the killings more than likely cannot be stopped without some sort of
direct intervention, the extreme probability was, until quite recently, that
the Indonesian regime simply could not have pursued its policies of
aggression without the direct support of the U.S. and its allies - that, in
other words, the annexation itself would have been unfeasible and
unsustainable without that aid."

Now, wait a minute.  Let's reality check.

What we're talking about is a relatively unsophisticated third world
military
apparatus (not a crack group like Hitler's SS divisions, Iraq's Guards--an
outgrowth of the Ten Thousand Immortals; or US Seals, etc.) and some machete
wielding, body gutting thugs of a paramilitary nature common under many
conditions, who are in unison attacking a virtually defenseless populace.

Is that not so?  Are they facing a line of troops who are harrying their
flanks,
threatening their lines, an army or resisting force which makes "simply
could not
have pursued" without US/Japan/etc help and a priori statement?

It looks to me like forced takeover requires only a savage will to see it
through,
not smart bombs.  It's happened many times before, and will again.

Dear Poetics List,

I'm trying to trace Barbara Baracks who was active in the New York poetry
scene in the late seventies.  Would anyone have any information on where
she might be now?

<fontfamily><param>Geneva</param>Granary Books announces the
publication of


En Famille


A Poem by Robert Creeley with Photographs by Elsa Dorfman


[Special offer to the Poetics List follows description.]


[The entire book is posted on our website: www.granarybooks.com]


In En Famille, Granary Books presents a collaboration between Robert
Creeley and Elsa Dorfman that is honest and lucid, with an awareness
and irony that, according to William Corbett, will "ensnare the
reader." In twenty-two frank, color photographs, Dorfman presents
various kinds of family configurations and generations. The sitters are
unglamorized, yet a sense of comfort accompanies their awkwardness.
"Dorfman's portraits," writes Corbett, project a clothed nakedness, the
blunt familiar fact of physical presence. She does this by a
contrivance so simple as to be beyond words." Creeley's poem, too,
addresses the tensions of family life, of nurturing and vulnerability,
of coming and going. His compelling questions and "homespun lines are
as simple as William Blake's Songs of Innocence and Experience"
(Corbett).


"Robert Creeley and Elsa Dorfman bring us the real news of the
different ways the word 'family' has been made to leap beyond its
lexical meanings. Poet and photographer register how family is being
re-envisioned by those who live as individuals within a 'securing
center.' Beginning with, and subverting, 'I wandered lonely as a
cloud,' William Wordsworth's quintessential Romantic image of the self,
Creeley writes a poem whose formal structure, its interlocking, echoing
pattern of rhymed quatrains, challenges our assumptions about the
legacy of Romantic and Modernist poetry. It is not that their legacy or
the family should endure in some rigid manner; it's that they have
changed and are changing still." -John Yau, poet & critic, author of
Active Participant: Robert Creeley and the Visual Arts


Dorfman and Creeley have known one another since the 1960s; En Famille
is their second collaboration. Their first, His Idea, was published by

Follow the money.  SE Asian Royal Dutch Shell (aka Indonesia), The Lippo
Bank, the Asian Tiger money market funds, all stand to lose big in any
protracted instability.

Given this, is the US administration's reaction a surprise?

My favorite cyberpoem is Stephanie Strickland's "Ballad of Sand and
Harry Soot":

http://wordcircuits.com/gallery/sandsoot/

If you've been underwhelmed by other mixtures of image and text, check
out this "ballad tale of love gone wrong between the enigmatic Sand, she
of silicon-based liveliness, and Soot, a man of carbon, biochemical man,
man of flesh and mood, a person."

Ok, I'm probably going to be taken to task for this, but here's a little
review I wrote a while ago which isn't going to be published (tho here it
is!).  It may seem knee-jerky to some, sloppily termed or patronizing to
others, but perhaps there's some matter here worth discussing?  Or if not,
not.

=93bold=94 deconstruction of the novel or
memoir forms, but as opposed to the nouveau roman of Wittig and
Robbe-Grillet, it is scattershot in its targets, and doesn=92t appear t=
o
point to any secure set of objects or themes.  Moments of lucidity are
interspersed with wrench-in-the-machinery doggerel that makes reading t=
he
book a task -- an intellectually challenging one perhaps, but occasiona=
lly
disheartening as the form is so clearly indebted to Modernist models th=
at,
more than a century old, seem to have outlived their usefulness (as mod=
els,
that is).  Somewhere between a Rimbaud declaiming against the snoring
Verlaine and Lautreamont swimming with the sharks, Harryman screams the=

birth of a new feminine consciousness, one that, indeed, goes a long wa=
y in
subverting the previous century's conception of female passivity: =93Af=
ter
childhood, for many days running I studied people's asses with the slow=
ness
of one who has discovered the crucial element in a universal tragedy.  =
I
slept too long.  I could reach over in bed and feel European history, i=
ts
density, course through the bloodstream of my adolescent mate.  While h=
e
slept and breathed equations of collective effort and heroic
self-sacrifice, I spread myself across the bed and concentrated on this=

recurring fantasy: a particle of fog burnt off at midday by the north c=
oast
sun.=94 [12]  Though Harryman is considered part of the Language genera=
tion
of writing, it appears that she develops a line quite directly from Eng=
lish
Futurist-inflected writers like Mina Loy and Wyndham Lewis -- both stau=
nch
critics of any sort of democratic humanism -- and like them shares a
penchant for larger-than-life mythological, or Zarathustrean, figures -=
-
though, post-structuralist as she is, her "mail order allegories" [p. 7=
2]
are provisional at best.  The protagonist -- more a motif -- in The Wor=
ds
is a figure named "Woemess,=94 which seems a pun on the word =93woman=94=
 and
menstrual imagery (or perhaps the aborted fetus, tying her sense of
subjectivity in with that of Baudelaire=92s in =93Benediction,=94 in wh=
ich his
mother asked to give birth to a brood of vapors rather than to a poet).=

She fades in and out of the narrative like a figure in a house of mirro=
rs
-- "Woemess baked in the sad plains.  She was as unreal as a discovery =
made
elsewhere=94 starts one chapter -- but occasionally is given to excitab=
le,
oracular outbursts: =93Woemess put the hat on her head and continued he=
r
speech as if she had played all the parts, =91In the recess of the cryp=
tic
world, where my arm sings to transcendental wampum, there are emergency=

vocabularies waiting in the wings to take over when we are failed by
categories.  If I wanted to, right now, I could paint the picture of th=
e
picture, show you the cryptic world, the song, and the wampum.  Or a dr=
eary
series of irregular rectangles, a repetitious dirge, and money.  But if=
 I
take you there, we will be gone.=94 [57]  There is much philosophical
terminology in here, as well as many plays towards fable-like forms and=

Steinian word-centered writing, but the most salient feature seems to b=
e
that of the a new voice of feminine power, albeit one centered around
opacity, or moments of overwhelming presence, than master narrative:
=93Femininity can't be narrated.  A theory develops that only what can =
be
ignored can be narrated.  Cactus, can it be ignored?=94  [52]  However,=

though the general texture of the writing is brisk, at times it is
repetitive and uncontrolled, and the content, ironically, fails because=
 it
is not self-centered enough -- it's the recreation of the struggles of =
the
ego confined more than the hapless, charismatic traces of its enactment=
.
In this way it comes off as a bit academic, artsy, and not philosophica=
l in
that unmediated Nietzschean sense that it aspires to -- it doesn't seem=
 to
relate to the world.  Nonetheless, The Words is a pretty good read, and=

possibly an interesting anthem for feminism.

Bop Perelman
Ten to One, Selected Poems
Wesleyan University Press

Perelman has distinguished himself from his Language peers by moving
recently into academic respectability, publishing two books of criticism,
the second of which, The Marginalizaton of Poetry, was about the Language
movement itself.  Temperamentally more congenial than poets such as Bruce
Andrews, Lyn Hejinian and Barrett Watten, who have often opted for
theoretic density or outright opacity in both poetry and prose, Perelman is
considered by many the most accessible or even

=93lyrical=94 Language poet, but
one can also say he is the most rational, as his poetry sacrifices comm=
on
aspects of aesthetic affect -- such as the angst-ridden dialectic betwe=
en
personal expression and the integrity of form -- for a sort of plain-sp=
oken
irony in a tradition that can be traced back to the Enlightenment, or w=
hich
can be linked to more recent concerns with =93entropy=94 (form dissolve=
d into
linked gestures).  An early poem such as =93An Autobiography=94 is a pl=
ay on
the type of minimal French novelette, and Perelman is quite apt at
satirizing the more indulgent, but perhaps also un-American, aspects of=

this genre, such as the disclosure of repressed sensibility amidst the
drama of religious confession: =93I wanted to cover my mother with kiss=
es,
and for her to have no clothes on.  It was quite usual to feel one side=
 of
the face getting sunburned, while the other was being frozen.  A journe=
y of
this kind is no joke. [...] I always wanted to give them to her on her
bosom.  Be so good as to remember that I lost her, in childbed, when I =
was
barely seven.=94  Of his =93father,=94 he writes, with metaphysical, Ca=
tholic
overtones (murder striking at the heart): =93I abhorred my father.  He
brought with him memories of how it feels to be intensely, fiercely hun=
gry.
He came and interrupted our kisses.=94 [p. 2]  Oddly, Perelman=92s poet=
ry is
atypical of Language writing in that it's distrust in the referent is
disclosed discursively rather than by example; that is, more like a Bar=
thes
than a Bernstein, he appears less concerned with "liberating" language =
such
as to foreground its =93presence=94 than with explaining, casually, per=
haps
reductively, the links between syntax and ontology: =93No place exists =
even
once.  Even before / Birth, earlier made up syntax / Could tell you apa=
rt /
From a thing or two, nothing waiting / In the wind, spiritual placebo p=
lus
/ The actual problem of dying.=94 [=93Statement," p. 53]  However, like=

Bernstein, he can be deathly funny, and uses bathos quite well, as in t=
he
poem "Oedipus Rex,=94 which could have been out of Mel Brooke=92s Histo=
ry of
the World Part I: =93What news, ancient uncle, from the transcendental
desktop? / KREON: The people, hemmed in by liberal playgrounds / and
rightwing communications systems, are dead / or dying.  No one=92s
complaining, mind you, but with the inauguration just hours away the sk=
y
seems to be crumbling, and the decibel level in some stadiums is below =
that
of Mallarme=92s tomb. / God thought you should know.=94 [p. 70]  Includ=
ed in
the volume is the poem made famous by Frederic Jameson, =93China=94 -- =
a series
of fake captions to news photographs from China, presented alone as a
"schizophrenic" but evocative poem -- which in hindsight is witty still=
,
but nonetheless a toned down, less masterful version of a poem from
Ashbery=92s The Tennis Court Oath.  Indeed, Perelman can be faulted for=
 not
always achieving aesthetic effects in his poems, as many of them --
including the 6-word-to-a-line poems which intend, conceptually, to fli=
rt
with the aleatory, and to counter any "false" notions of the idealism o=
f
form -- are rhythmically unvaried or unexciting, or at least lack the s=
ort
of decisions that, when made well, inspires the reader=92s interest in =
the
meter, sound patterning and images, and by extension the content.  The
poems work well as =93assays=94 into topical issues -- Chomsky would be=
 happy
with such poetry, as it offers no delusions yet shows the connections, =
like
a domesticated Ginsberg -- and welcome open dialogue with its contents =
(its
authority is pedagogically inclined), but one asks: =93Is it art?=94  P=
erelman,
with a nod to Duchamp's subversions of the retina, would delight in the=

question.

Subject: Novels of the 60=B4s


I already backchanneled this, but it seems that quite a few people are
interested in novels of the sixties, so if german authors are permitted, i
would like to suggest these two:

Rolf Dieter Brinkmann: Keiner weiss mehr.

Brinkmann congeniously translated Frank O=B4Hara=B4s poetry to german, was =
the
editor of "Silver Screen" and "Acid", two compilations that first
introduced Burroughs, Bukowski, O=B4Hara and several others to a german
audience. "Acid" was a cult when I was in my teens. Brinkmann himself
mainly known for his poetry. Check out "Westward 1&2" if you come across
it. His most exciting work is the journal "Rom, Blicke". I don=B4t know if
any of his work is translated, if it isn=B4t, there=B4s a job to be done.

Hubert Fichte: Die Palette

This is the first novel to portray the gay underground in Hamburg. =
Fichte=B4s
style is amazing, it was termed "new sensitivity" when he first came out
with his work, but to me it appears as a combination of Doeblin=B4s =
montage
techniques with elements of the nouveau roman, a very physical and
psychedelic style. If you don=B4t know it, you should. If it isn=B4t
translated, you should do it yourself or find somebody who will do it.
Fichte left a great body of work after his death a few years ago, he is
still mainly read in fan circles, but this is truly excellent stuff.

Greetings, Thomas Dorow

everything should be interesting, I totally agree. in the light of that, I'm
wondering -- innocently, mind you - what with the air so filled with baloney
(say bologna and you're a phongna) crying to be heard -- I use the term
'baloney' with a verifiably sweet expression on my face, by the way -- if
there is a particular thing that poets do when NOT writing their ineffable
freedoms. you know, to keep the tractor in working fettle. do they let sail
away their language for the more effable diurnal this and that, or do
they -- how should I say it?-- breathe the damn poetical elemental all the
freaking time? what is the life of a poet and how does it, that life, work
in this treasured ignorant world? I'm a dullard from way back but it could
be, correct me if I'm wrong, that I've hit on a philosophical question here.
those are toughies ALWAYS, but gee, it seems like we ought to evaluate the
monster we're making constantly, and not just in our powerful creative
moments when we share Emily Dickinson's blistering (and unveering) sense of
course thru the forest. such evaluation seems simply the dutiful thing, BUT
I COULD BE WRONG. I, a lowly rock in a world of mountains, just wonder if
the comprehensive intensity remains intact, or does it get to slack off when
no one from Parnassus is there to cheer? I've never said a truth in my life,
so I'm talking need to know here. are we stuck with our language or is it
stuck with us, and all our caprices? what's the 4-1-1 on community
standards? I'm hot to know. I've got lots to learn.

Taylor,

Of all the responses to Mike Neff's e-mail, yours seem to be the best
examples of a logic constructed partly on the idea that because  events
occur together in time, the events are somehow linked causally, and partly
on the idea that events which you do not personally witness, or have any
special knowledge of, are nonetheless events that you can interpret not only
correctly, but also "righteously"--that is, you are able to divine the
motivations and moral construction of all those involved, from the beginning
of the forced annexation of East Timor to its bloody fight for independence.

It's quite amazing to me, a liberal, to see the kind of reaction generated
by a clearly written, well-reasoned message (Neff's). What has created this
firestorm? Simply the suggestion that the US government (and whatever else
we conceive that entity to be,it is still a collection of people with
limitations) may not be wholly responsible for what's happening in East
Timor. I don't see that Mike Neff was disputing any historical facts, or
events leading up to what's happening there--only that he was questioning
the idea that these successive events *had* to be linked to either a kind of
evil intentionality, or an immoral turning away by the US government. He was
instead, and rightly I think, proposing the idea that deeper, and even
random, forces are also at work in these situations--not only, but also.
That we need to consider the constant recurrence of group hatreds, killings,
the human prediliciton for wiping each other out. Nowhere was he suggesting
that arms were *not* sold, that US interests were *not* pursued, or that the
US often gets behind what turn out to be (or always were) rotten
leaders/causes--sometimes in the interest of avoiding worse leaders/causes,
or more likely, for simple economic or ideologic reasons.

Now that I've seen what comes back from this "radical" idea that the US
government may not be the God we can blame, I'm astonished not only by the
list's intolerance, but also by the realization that so many liberals have
given up their ability to analyze and respond to a clear idea objectively,
for the more comfortable idea that there's always clearly someone to
blame--if not God, then the government.

She worked with me at Bankers Trust for several years; she left her
position there over a year ago; her address in the Poets & Writers
address book is 427 15th Street, #4B, Brooklyn, NY 11215; this is a good
address as of... over a year ago.

Sunday at Cafe Balcony...the first reading of our new season:

Avery E. D. Burns
Joseph Noble

Starts at 4 p.m. Address and other info are at http://www.litpress.com

Avery E. D. Burns's book Stagger is out on the web site Black Fire White
Fire (http://home.earthlink.net/~kunos/). Poems from "A Duelling Primer"
have appeared in Chain, Idiom and Proliferation. Other work has been in
Angle, Rhizome, and Windhover. A book "The Idler Wheel" is forthcoming on
Sink Press, and, poems from this work will be in the next issues of
Instress, Ribot, and Syllogism. Avery has edited the magazine lyric& since
1992, and has run the Canessa Park reading series in San Francisco for the
past 3 years.

Joseph Noble has had creative and critical work published in Hambone,
lyric&, Talisman, Antenym, and TO. He has poetry appearing in upcoming
issues of Melodeon and Vapor/Strains. He is currently working on a new
series, "an ives set," which engages with the music and ideas of Charles
Ives. The third section, which is still in progress and is called
"Improvisations," riffs off several of Ives' pieces. Joseph Noble is also
writing two collaborative poem series, one each with the poets Avery Burns
and Eric Selland.

Why?  Why indeed?   I should have realized there must be a considerable sense of
job well done when they have earned their pay.  I'm certain they would never
stoop to disemboweling unless paid to do so!  This is all absorbing to me.
Since you are keenly aware of the mechanisms in place, no doubt having first
hand knowledge, I suppose you can reveal whether they are paid by the hour or by
the body or head?

If they are working for the NSA they deserve a retirement package.

Course, if they're rampaging as humans are inclined to do from time to time,
then how can it be the fault of US?  It therefore stands to reason they must be
paid.

No, that's not my viewpoint.  And I don't know what the last part of your

That's not my position ... I'm tired of this already.  And I know far
more about it than you suspect.  You are simply touching on International
Politics 101, my friend.  It's far more complicated than this.

Michael Neff asks a fascinating question about the horrific violence
in East Timor: Couldn't it have happened anyway, even (yes, alas)
without CIA engineering of the 1965 coup against Sukarno, the
ensuing massacre in a year's time of around 3/4 of a million
people, the ongoing US-coddling of the IMF-loving Indonesian
generals, and the green light of silence from the West as that
Western-trained and supplied military invaded and scorched East
Timor? It might _seem_ as if we've been complicit in creating
certain violence-enabling conditions on a macro scale, but how can
we _really_ be sure? As Neff puts it, lots of people are getting
killed by natively-made machetes, so how can we _really_ know
this current explosion of violence wouldn't have happened sans our
assistance anyway?

He's right, of course. As Hume asked, How can we be sure that
the sun will rise tomorrow?

Or as Wittgenstein asked, more or less, How can I be sure that
that man is truly in pain?

We can't!  There is simply no certain relationship between our
observation of the world and its "empirical" manifestations, no
matter how stubborn the evidences may seem.

So if we can't be sure about the sun, or about human
pain, even, how can we be sure about something like the
consequences of imperialist policy in Indonesia, especially when
people like to kill each other with rocks anyway?!

Life is a puzzle, and I agree with Mr. Neff. Now I'm going to read about
American poetry at Web del Sol.

I know I will be further scathed here and backchannel insulted because my
skepticism knows no bounds, but here is a tiny excerpt from The Nation article
that is being pushed in my face as if it is the word of God:

"According to a classified cable on the meeting, circulating at Pacific Command
headquarters in Hawaii, Blair,
rather than telling Wiranto to shut the militias down, instead offered him a
series of promises of new US assistance. "

Fair Questions:

How did the reporter know the above?
How did he get hold of a copy of the classified cable at Pacific Command?
Why would such a cable come from Pacific Command and not the embassy?
And what are the promises?  Why aren't they listed here?
And how can anyone not be skeptical?
And is it ok to be skeptical?

REGARDLESS, this has nothing to do with my initial remarks.  I just find it
funny that this is one of the sources of absolute authority in this matter, for
some people.

there was at least one us military spokesman in a recent newsreport who said
america has no interest there so thats why there is reticence to be
involved, the question here is under the grand new world order bullshit
spoken by the US over the last decade, where is the order to come from if
"interests or the lack" slows down ANY governments actions where people are
being slaughtered , this slowness also includes the farce of "readiness" my
own government here in australia are playing et etc et//pete spence

For A., K., G., N., A., L., F., B., A., J., P., T., L., J., M., S.


It is morning in the Cafe Lautreamont.
Pierre stares me down. Pierre brings me coffee.
Pierre knows I know he is a function who is not a function.
I am a state to Pierre's operator.
Pierre is the occupier of a role, as in main(Pierre).
Pierre carries and sullies a revolution.
Pierre is part of a surplus economy that I recognize.
I do not acknowledge that I recognize this surplus.
There is a state within which I am in Pierre and a state otherwise.
The state otherwise is to forget Pierre which is to annihilate him.
The revolution moves from person to person, stateless.
The revolution is a state, mobile and wandering.
I am linked to Pierre at the cafe and coupled otherwise to Pierre.
I say, "I am coupled to all the Pierres in the world."
I say, "I did not ask for this. I would not have asked for this."
I say, "I asked for a cup of coffee and nothing more."
I say, "I have paid you for this cup of coffee."
Pierre has not spoken and I assume he sees me as the signified.
I am the signified of a certain exchange, surplus value.
Coupled within exchange, I have no use; it is all circuitry.
Pierre and I are engaged in mutual annihilation.
Pierre gazes at me and the revolution stirs.
Unspeaking, the revolution blindly cauterizes the remnants of language.
I say, "Words no longer account for anything, Pierre."
I say, "These are sounds I am making, of no value whatsoever."
I say, "I lean on other processes, alan.o for example for sustenance."
I say, "As if we would ever be friends," and the revolution stirs.
Something speaks in one and another and speaks forever.
Sometimes speaks at the portal of death and constitution.
I say, "I will live in you, Francoise."
I say, "You will remember me, keep my diaries intact, Francoise."
I say, "You will find a publisher after all," Francoise.
There is silence at the other end of the room.
Pierre brings me coffee and Francoise smiles and says nothing.
There is a slight stirring of the white curtains in the sun.
A breeze is blowing outside and there are sailboats in the harbor.
An accordion, a gypsy, a horse-and-cart, a trolley, a very happy day.

Does this mean that you do not want to find any reading painful? Why is
that? Surely one of the most honourable and usual purposes of a fiction
writer of any seriousness would be to make the reading painful. Another
might be to make it exhilarating. I have found lots of writing painful (not
talking about references here) and returned to it, knowing that it is
important. In early years that writing included _The Cantos_. Later it
included _Palimpsest_ and _Geography & Plays_ and _The Casnnibal_. I do not
find books by James Lee Burke to be painful; though I read them, I will not
reread them. I dont remember ever being deprtessed because a book was
painful to read.

Uh, East Timor voted to be independent.

Mime-Version: 1.0

On Saturday, October 2, Small Press Traffic will hold its 5th annual
literary soiree and manuscript auction.  This year's soiree ("Silver
Streak") will be combined with our 25th anniversary celebration and
will feature a grand group reading:  25 Writers/25 Years.

Though we have an active soiree committee, we could still use more
volunteers to work the event.  Any one in the San Francisco Bay area
free any time from noon to 10 p.m. that day?  We'll be having a
soiree committee meeting this Saturday, September 18 at 1 p.m., which
all potential volunteers are invited to (backchannel me, Kevin
Killian, for details).  But you don't have to go to the meeting to be
a volunteer.

Indulge your passion for backstage drama!  You'll see it'll be a lot of fun!

This includes all of you around the world who will be visiting San
Francisco the weekend of October 2.  Just because you're a tourist
doesn't mean you can't roll up your shirt sleeves and chip in.

Thanks everyone.  ... I'm waiting . . .

"...the US Govt is far, far more stupid than malevolent.  It requires =
planning and
skill to be intentionally malevolent." -Michael Neff Sept 14, 1999

Remember that old Saturday Night Live skit, where Phil Hartman plays R. =
Reagan? He acts stupid and forgetful in front of the press and his =
cabinet and then, when they all leave, he says "Finally, I'm alone!" =
then picks up two phones, starts dialing numbers and speaking russian =
and french.

It's funny stuff. Improbably, right? I mean, politicians aren't bad =
people, motivated by money and the power it represents, right? They're =
well meaning folks like you and me, from rich families, good schools,  =
proper contacts etc...

There is a definite desire NOT to believe what is happening is because =
of the US. Remember the US is now the "policeman of the world" and all =
that entails, incl. setting the rules of the game. otherwise, without =
rules, what else is there to police? we want to think that iraq was =
about saving Kurds-that's what we were told-but why were we letting them =
die in the south while supposedly protecting them in the north (or vice =
verse, it's too hard to keep track-my scorecard is full)? It is =
acknowledged that the CIA trained kurds in the north for years before =
the US decided to bomb. and they weren't learning how to build shelter =
for refugees, or farm, or build industry.

it seems to me that history has proven a fair barometer to the =
relationship between what is stated at times of conflict and what is =
fact. war is often a time of lies. it is a key part of building defense =
for a nation's defenseless activities. in smaller terms, remember the =
president's council on race (did i get the name of that thing right?)? =
all of these big shots went parading around the country trying to =
prove/defend the position that the crisis in american society was one of =
race. at each stop, the folks in the audience were pretty clear on =
pointing out that economics were at hand.=20

The US gov. is having trouble defending itself in front of the world. =
and they know the folks at home don't like all of these wars and all of =
the fako-half truths they're given as causes/reasons. enter australia. =
fodder. poor australia. they'll take some global heat for a change. =
after all, they got the damned olympics (which, by the way i believe =
should be held in buffalo--to revitalize the economy! more sports =
stadiums=3Dbetter quality of life after all (just ask the Admin. at the =
U of Buffalo)). where are the people of australia? The press (the =
state?) is hawkish. here's how one paper puts it:

  All dressed up, only one place to go
16sep99  The Australian=20
THEY want very badly to go. The orders are through and adrenaline is =
running through the platoons. They know who among them will go in first. =
They do not think in terms of the plight of East Timor - they want to be =
what they have trained to be.

turn off brain. obey orders. they are well trained indeed.

--

From Reuters, via NYT:

DARWIN, Australia (Reuters) - Australia's defense force chief warned =
Thursday that the U.N. mission to restore order in East Timor would be =
``tough'' and the force would take a firm stance if Indonesian forces =
failed to cooperate.=20

``If we don't get the cooperation we need we will end up having to make =
this a tough military operation and that will be a tough challenge, but =
as I said earlier we are ready to take this challenge,'' Admiral Chris =
Barrie told reporters in Darwin.=20

Barrie said the timetable for deployment of the multinational troop =
force, expected this weekend, was not yet finalized.=20

``We will deliver on this mission, so let there be no doubt,'' said =
Barrie, referring to the U.N. mandate to use ``all necessary measures'' =
to stop an orgy of killing by pro-Indonesia militia in East Timor.=20

--

one gets the sense that the refugees are secondary now. indonesia, here =
we come! we will fix you and then give you back to you, properly cleaned =
up and functional-just put this guy, no this guy, in power and we'll =
give ya tons of cash. wink. wink. until we don't like him, that is. =
wink. kiss. hug. shake.

Because we don't believe something is possible is not enough reason for =
its dismissal. Conspiracy Theory has been thrown around to circumvent =
the discussion of what forces motivate and enact events. JFK is a good =
example. and it is quite evident that this line of propaganda (i think =
Conspiracy Theory is now an actual field of study at most public =
universities!) has succeeding in removing =
discussion/analysis/identification of phenomena from our society. after =
all, without identification there is little chance that action will be =
informed, will succeed. we know that the auto industry went city to city =
and sold cheap busses if the cities agreed to lose the trolleys, they =
pushed for massive road building, etc. there are plenty of things to =
learn from history. we don't have any more time to learn from history! =
it is happening around us every moment.

It is fact that indonesia is a strategic location for the movement of =
capital, commerce, goods, etc to/from the far east. even npr admits it. =
does this have a role in why the US (UN?) is so interested in the area? =
stabilization, as a policy for global intervention, proposes that =
unbalanced things shall be balanced. who/what's on the see-saw?

The NSA creates an annual "Top Ten" list in which they identify "problem =
areas" or "threats." Past and present favorites include Iraq, N. Korea, =
Cuba, China, Iran. It's like a to-do list!

we'd like to think that there is a mess of local political stuff going =
on in the sublayers of the why-this-is-happening, and there may be some, =
but this is another one of those "you will never understand what is =
going on and leave it to the experts; here, read this _everything for =
dummies_ book while you sit quietly" diversions. like Yugoslavia and the =
appearance of strange ancient texts in the forefront of discussion. this =
all after the opinion polls proved the more simple, but somewhat dulled, =
line of saving refugees went south (well, since we blew up the busses =
filled with those we were "helping"). is my timeline messed up? the =
point is the same.

anyway, 'spontaneous' psychotic group behavior is a reflection of/ =
reaction to the state of a society, or the state of the people of a =
state. Chicago 1968. Black Panthers. AIM. Born of nothing? the best =
thing for the world is to fix america-ground up. that would ease a lot =
of suffering. ours included.

Here's an easy one to consider: in rural places everyone owns a
machete--self-defense by a majority with machetes is easy and affordable.
Where there's a modern army one side's machetes are backed by guns. Whoever
supplies the guns and trains the troops is a necessary enabler.

This isn't novel. A lot of extremely poor countries have bloated militaries
that pull all the strings because one superpower or another thought they
should.

I'm not trying to deflect the worthwhile political drift of the List here,
but I've always wondered just what Basil Bunting was doing in Iran as a
British spy.

My Hutchinson Encyclopeda says:

"During World War II, Iran was occupied by British, US, and Soviet troops
until 1946. Anti-British and anti-American feeling grew and in 1951 the
newly elected prime minister, Dr Muhammad Mossadeq, obtained legislative
approval for the nationalilzation of Iran's largely foreign-owned petroleum
industry. With US connivance, he was deposed in a 1953 coup and the dispute
over nationalisation was settled the following year when oil-drilling
concessions were granted to a consortium of eight companies. "

Basil?

I defy you to name a single situation involving popular movement
overthrow or bud-nippage in which there's been no CIA involvement, or
any regime oppressiveness, be it in Turkey, Central America, South
America (currently most "addressed" in corporate media is Colombia: CIA
and DEA don't like the FARC because they going to take some
American/Col Military $!!!), Haiti, Indonesia, Oakland, ad infi, not
EXPLICITLY either

1) funded in total
2) funded intellectually
3) endorsed
4) propped by economic threat

by the Pentagon CIA White House or, mightier than each aforesaid, the
ten or whatever major US corporations.

I wager that the White House has "decided to act" in East Timor finally
not because of public pressure, but because to not do so means to risk
losing some of its control there. France could get angry enough and via
UN send in a force, adn there would France be now in our Indonesia!
Also very related: to research what firms are in and controlling
parties in what is called Indonesia, though not appearing as often in
corporate media: EXXON the paramount, and many others. Follow the money
as the woman at aol.com wrote.

Wiranto is a puppet of the Dept of Defense, whose officials have been
tracking E TImor events hourly since roughly 1975 and in other guises
previous to it.

I spoke to a deskie in Cohen's office, whose govt chip made him repeat,
after each of my statements SPEAK UP SIR I CANNOT HEAR YOU until I was
shouting and he was repeating those words, at which point I had to
scream TELL SEC COHEN I SAID FUCK YOU!!!

To the web de sol correspondent: it's not a sin to be incredulous, I
would've been too at your age. Noam Chomsky constantly repeats
anecdotes of his run-ins with those balkers at anything smacking of
"conspiracy theory"--unfortunately it is only a minority, frightened
yet in touch and awesome, that sees no dramatization in the Smoking
Man's cabal in xFiles, it's called G7 World Bank IMF LockMartin etc,
and very much the entity and entities that have most what is called
power but really is influence in world "politics" i.e. economic raping
and freemarketing.

Read I Don't Have Any Paper So Shut Up by Bruce Andrews for the manner
of thought and impulse of those motherfuckers, he nails it so
excellently

Today even the the editor of The Ecologist (UK), everybody knows of it
since being beat around by Monsanto circa the publication of its
Monsanto Issue; the editor was asked, but is Mr Monsanto, I forget the
CEO's named, Robert ?, Is Mr. Monsanto really a bad person or just part
of a  monstrous entity? And Ecologist editor replied like, Oh that's an
important good question, and the unspoken (as such) point of his
response was: yes he is an awful evil motherfucker!

Don't let's never get spiritual and wonder after the souls of these
kind, Cohen, Hurwitz, a hundred more: kill them!

"Some people should die, that's just unconscious knowledge" per Jane's
Addiction, although to profess strong beliefs like this will get you
booted from an academic or arts scene or whatever; but I come to find
that the people I seldom find but respect most share opinions along
that line.

Before I send this I'll point out that if Florida or Kansas or
California or any state in US wanted independence from US a la E Timor
from Indonesia (and each of the 50 have the right! and reason) the
military, the FBI, "local law enforcement" CIA etc, altogether would
instantly descend upon that state and beginning destroying anybody
active in that ceding or whatever it woul dbe called. Maybe not with
pedestrian machetes: no with propaganda first then torture and wicked
bullshit devised by professional govt sadists at labs and manufacturers
across our great states.

So before going off about "brutes" in Indonesian-backed TImorese
militias, think of your Uncle Jack semper fi, or that cop across the
block: they'd been scalping your head in flash if you were part of
genuine American independence movement. CF L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E's reception,
even, by mainstream artists or critics. CF

Here are my closing arguments and observations regarding the violence in
Indonesia:

Restating for the final time, my original point: the macro politic and
conspiracy models presented here in various forms and containing various
actors, all designed to explain and assign responsibility to the
psychotic group behaviors ongoing in Indonesia for a very long time, are
inadequate.  In some ways they are superfluous, and in other ways
peripheral.  Facts are mixed with fiction and assumption.  But they all
have the same avowed goal, to heap America with blame for the killings.
Every iota of energy is dedicated to making the US govt, whether
Kissinger or NSA or whoever, or some American entity or official or some
combination thereof directly responsible for the massacres.

Two of the more "persuasive" arguments for making the US responsible for
the many years of carnage are as follows.  The US defeated a UN
resolution at some point in time which would have sanctioned or somehow
prevented Indonesia from conducting the slaughter campaigns.  This idea
that the UN could have prevented the violence with a resolution of any
kind is at once laughable and pathetic.  Since when do dictators and
police squads and fanatics forgo hostilities as soon as the UN wags a
finger at them?  The UN can place troops on the ground and be so
hamstrung by bureaucracy, cowardice, and politics that the offenders can
feel free to kill right before the eyes of UN officers!  The second
argument goes, the US trained elements of the Indonesian army, elements
of the Indonesian army slaughter people, ergo, the US is responsible.
This is the same as saying, a police academy trains police, some of them
use their skills and position to commit crimes, ergo the police academy
is responsible.  But this is absurd.  For example, when cops are
arrested for drug dealing, shakedowns, brutality, etc. in New Orleans,
NY, or DC, does a cry go up for the heads of police academy officials?
NO, the cops are responsible and they must pay.

This is an important point: PRIMARY RESPONSIBILITY MUST LIE WITH THOSE
WHO ARE DIRECTLY ENGAGED IN THE ATROCITIES, those pulling the triggers,
wielding the machetes.  How can it be otherwise?  Eichman didn't get
off, and neither did other Nazis after WW II.  They were culpable.
Again, this is not to say that US hasn't stupidly and unethically played
a role in training elements of the Indonesian military (witness what the
homicidal maniacs in Guatemala do with their training).  But back to the
main point, trained by US or not, the theater of conflict and hatred and
the means to kill exist regardless.  Savac in Iran would have existed in
one form or another regardless of American money to the Shah or any
number of military advisors and CIA cretins skulking about, because the
social and political conditions which made Savac a force existed
independent of the US!

In other words, there are other factors, other models which more closely
explain the group behaviors in these theaters of conflict.

I'm willing to bet that if you delved deeply into Indonesian society,
local politics, regional social orders, etc. you would find a complex of
animosities, violent history, perhaps even tribe-like blood feuds, and
more that go towards explaining the situation, perhaps even making the
US "involvement" seem in the final analysis largely irrelevant.  Then
you have the corruption of the Indonesian govt, army corruption, a
complex of ambitions, power struggles, etc.  All these must be factored
in.

In other words, the macro models presented so far are too simplistic to
explain the repeated violence.

In general, and regardless of my original point, it is evident to me
from the some of the posts here and backchannel communications to me of
a vitriolic nature, that fanaticism can cloud judgement, and that errors
of logic are being made, not to mention utterly subjective
interpretations of historical facts and outright falsehoods.

Much of the "evidence" can be debated or at least treated with a
skeptical eye, e.g., the article by the reporter who claims to have seen
a classified cable sent to Pacific Command and who speaks to unknown gov
officials who are leaking to him.  Perhaps there is some Pulitzer
seeking here, and perhaps it is all true, but skepticism should be
exercised.  Hypocrisy can become evident at such time those who profess
the media is part of the conspiracy then turn around and accept a
national media source as gospel as soon as it fits in with their
predisposition.

There are at least three different versions which attempt to prove to me
(regardless of the real point I was attempting to make) that America is
responsible for the years of killing fests in Indonesia (and even
elsewhere!).  These individuals should get together and compare notes,
get it straight.  Either Chevron or the Pacific Command or Kissinger or
the NSA or whoever is the main culprit; and then all the house of card
assumptions that go along to make a whopping good and fun conspiracy
theory.  These individuals have events unfolding differently, posit
competing reasons for the same behavior on the part of the militias,
various American entities behind the scenes, etc., but like fanatics of
competing religions, they accept the existence of one God, or in this
case, one Satan America.

As far as accepting on face value what conspiracy theorists say relative
to blaming America for the many years of pogrom-like rages and
methodical brutality, that proves impossible, for given the level of
fanaticism as evidenced by backchannel communications to me laced with
scathing insults and generally embittered ego mania (e.g., I'm a lazy
ass idiot, ugly mouthed, an embarassment, neanderthal, and equal to a
state dept hack)--and all erupting on me in quite sudden and uncalled
for fashion--one cannot help but conclude that like true zealots, these
maze-brained individuals will only seek out and report on those sources
of information most likely to confirm their viewpoint. In other words,
they are too religious to be credible, having erected their own gods and
belief system which sustains them.  Pavlovian leftism, or rightism, the
behavior is always the same and credibility is dashed.  Even if a grain
of truth is present, it is submerged in twaddle and invective.

These are the same people who argue that Marxism is a credible political
alternative and that the shout of freedom heared in eastern Europe many
years ago was nothing but a CIA manipulation.  They only have one drum
and they bang it continuously while chanting America is Evil, America is
Evil, thereby seeking the solace of moral high ground and community
forever lost to them in the sixties.

This, from "Moving Gently on East Timor," an article by Russell Mokhiber and
Robert Weissman, housed at Z Magazine's website:
http://www.zmag.org/CrisesCurEvts/Timor/mokweiseast_timor.htm Should go some
way toward addressing the question "Who stood (and stands) to gain?" From
the most immediate perspective, confined to East Timor only, the oil
companies named below would probably emerge as the largest investment
interests, in terms of their speculating on the value of the oil deposits in
the Timor Gap.

-----------------------------
"We have myriad interests" in Indonesia, explained State Department
spokesperson Jaime Rubin in one of his daily briefings, "and what our job is
is to try to balance those various interests."

Others in the government and chattering class, such as Eleanor Clift of
Newsweek, echoed this basic sentiment. The United States should be
"realistic" in setting its policy on East Timor, they urged, noting the
multiple U.S. "interests" in Indonesia and the importance of promoting
"stability."

Since the prescription was to balance these "interests" in "stability"
against the lives of the Timorese, it is worth identifying what they are.

"We have a business interest," said Rubin in identifying competing U.S.
interests in Indonesia. That is, the U.S. government wants to protect U.S.
investments in Indonesia -- Nike's subcontractor factories, the mines of
Freeport McMoRan, the oil drilling of Texaco, Chevron and Mobil. Strong
diplomatic pressure on Indonesia might conceivably have led to the
revocation of concessions and privileges for U.S. corporations, worried the
practitioners of realpolitik.

Worse, from this point of view, was the possibility that support for the
Timorese will somehow flare up Indonesian separatist movements in Aceh
(where Mobil is heavily invested) and Irian Jaya (where Freeport McMoRan
runs the world's largest gold mine).

A broader U.S. business interest was in maintaining the flow of IMF and
World Bank money to Indonesia, so the country maintains its commitment to
the "structural adjustment" policies which require it to remove restrictions
on foreign investment, further orient its economy to exports, privatize
government enterprises and cut subsidies to the poor.

Additionally, given the precarious state of the Indonesian economy, and the
success of the IMF in deepening Indonesian dependence on foreign money
flows, a sudden cut off of IMF and Bank monies might in fact send a harmful
shock to the economy (whatever the long-run benefits of severing ties with
the international financial institutions). The announced cut off of funds is
actually a suspension of future monies not yet allocated, and is only
temporary, so the feared effect on the international markets has been muted.

Of course, it would be misleading to say the U.S. government was slow to act
in Indonesia/East Timor only because it wanted to protect Nike and other
U.S. multinationals. In addition to the commercial and broader economic
stability issues, the U.S. foreign policy and military establishments attach
great geopolitical importance to maintaining good ties with the Indonesian
government and especially the Indonesian military (viewed as a counterweight
to China and a dependable regional ally).

Good point Brian.  The philosophical position I take is that there are
indeed features of the world that we can communicate to each other, that
there may be facts about the world, that facts are possible.  It seems the
word "fact" is somewhat of a curse word these days.  that's OK, though I am
politically suspect of such a philosophical position.  (Well, OK, I am
suspect of both positions, actually, b/c just as a person can use "truth" as
a banner to harm people, others can use the banner of "no such thing as
truth" to the very same harmful end.)

I do find it wise to believe there are many viewpoints and mental
constructions in the world, and I also find it wise to question the very
possibility of a "true" metaphysic, or metaphysics itself.  However, if I
see people manipulating other people with certain exploitative intentions
and those intended events happen, I find it hard to admit that such facts
about the perceived causality are inadmissible or unprivileged.  they are
privileged, perhaps in terms of their possibility.  And I believe that
perceptions frequently overlap and have commonalities.  (I have to take such
a notion on faith alone, as there is no way to even verify even the
existence of other minds.)  There are facts / is knowledge about the world,
perhaps constructed of these overlapping perceptions, perhaps resulting from
an actual ultimate reality, (that's not for our minds to really know) and
language often comes up short trying to encapsulate and relate those ideas
flawlessly. I also believe we can still try to approximate accuracy.  Call
me naive, or a platonist, or something else.  It's OK, I've heard it before.

As for this army you mention, i don't know what you mean.  I post in haste
sometimes, as what is happening is very upsetting.  people are being
slaughtered by the thousands, and i initially knee-jerk into a reaction that
says, "how or why would you say this is not the real story"?  If I flamed, i
apologize.  I'm not exactly a diplomat.  But it did seem he actually
questioned the very idea that there was anything going on beyond what we
hear and read in the major US media, that there is a better model, beyond
what we just perceive from listening to NPR, for instance.  But perhaps then
there's no "real story" about what Mike was saying. ;)    regardless, I pass
no judgment, cast no aspersions on Mike, by any stretch.

This is on target...and an important point.  If you go over US coverage
over the years, the media first refused to pay ANY attention, after the
invastion and occupation.  To a very large extent, it was Chomsky who
forced the US intellectual and media sturctures to finally begin to
acknowledge the existence of E. Timor..(and that took many years). altho
they did not acknowledge his main point:  the US is squarely responsible
for the crimes there..... THEN after a few years with some coverage, all
the networks and wire services and the NYT began using the term
"separatist"-- in effect makng clear thru their decisions about language
that they endorsed the legitimacy of the savage occupation.

This isn't my point.  We're off track.  My comments were directed to this
statement by Peter Spence: "It may also be just as good and probably easier
to protest the American gov't for their ongoing role in the slaughter and
oppression of the East Timorese."

That was my statement, not Pete's.  He excerpted an e-mail I sent him.

then the words had their intended effect.

Yeah, but no one said anything to the contrary.  No one said it's always the
US's fault.  So I don't know if you're arguing with anyone here.

So what?  I can safely say that if the US didn't do this shit the genocide
probably wouldn't have happened.  The US is not required for genocide.  The
British can do it, the French, the Dutch, the Belgians, the Indonesians, the
Brazilians, and so on, can all cause genocide.  No one here is arguing with
that.  However, keep in mind most of the Nazis in the Gehlen Org found safe
haven in employment with the US (CIA, mostly) after WWII and their legacy
has a profound effect on what happens when the US is involved. And
unfortunately the US has had a hand in most genocides since WWII.  Some say
that's the price for power or for protecting American "freedom;" some say
it's necessary to preserve or increase wealth.

i assume there must be some portion of you out there whove got this book
_imagining language_ that rasula and mccaffery edited ?    has anyone seen a
review of anywhere ?    it sits on my dining room table and as i have
breakfast or lunch or dinner i open it and the food gets cool (if hot) or
warm (if cold)     it was expensive as hell but not inappropriately
expensive i dont think ----- point is that its just fucking amazing and if
you (yeah, you *general* without me knowing squat about you singular,
individual) havent seen it you really ought to (again, "ought" is a bit
fishy i know but once youve had some leisure with this book i think you'll
agree, and if you don't it may be that we wdnt be able to communicate very
effectively anyway)       this is not a review        i cant really imagine
an adequate review        jerome rothenberg cd perhaps handle it        his
anthologies are the only things that this book seems comparable to

>I'm just saying I'm hearing some familiar themes here.

I don't always implicate oil companies.  I've been tired of such
explanations, too.  But these things (E Timor, Congo, Iraq, Kosovo) are
consistently about natural resources.  And the US is not the only player in
these arenas.

>I'll tell you emphatically that I do *not* get my news from CNN, NBC, etc.
During the Kosovo crisis, e.g., I watched far more interesting French
coverage
(they even interviewed a British officer).

I apologize if I insinuated that you were restricted to CNN.  It's good to
use foreign press, and always good to use your own noggin.  And if you have
inside info, that's even better.

Is the model sufficient for the behavior there?  No, I agree.  Necessary?
In the case of E. timor, maybe.  Maybe, though, many people CAN be right
about basic things.  I do not believe that majority opinions are prima facie
false.  And these are hardly majority opinions.

>Occam's Razor, the Japan/US/NBC/Chevron formal or informal infrastructure

You can say that, but I disagree.

>behaviors,
esp pronounced psychotic ones on such a grand and incredibly savage scale,
don't
include local culture, socio-psych, or other factors to account for them.

Sure, and you're right to become suspicious.  everyone can build upon what I
said, and add to the model, but to throw away what I said and replace it
with a psychosocial perspective is hardly constructive.

Not completely, as in they are not sufficient, but they are necessary.  Have
you ever read the counterinsurgency manuals from the CIA?  they employ their
extensive knowedge in the areas of study you mention to reach certain ends.
People do pay for and train mercenary armies, and mercenary armies that are
paid for by certain groups are clearly responsible for what has transpired
in the past week or so.

>Believe me Patrick, the US Govt is far, far more stupid than malevolent.

And again, I think you are wrong.  Actually, I know this is wrong.  There
are people in the government much more intelligent than you or me.  And they
plan, they know about contingencies, it's their lives.  Me, I'm just farting
around on a keyboard.  They often do things and call them mistakes, because
it fools us into a comfortable position of superiority, albeit poorly
founded.

i find Joan Houlihan's post a little odd.  Why do we need to emphasize the
fact that *some* aspects of the E. Timor situation are random?  Why is
this important, or helpful?  I am reminded of the old sawhorse phrase from
my college philosophy courses:  "true but trivial."

However, the various ways in which US foreign policy *is* implicated in
that situation, are *not* trivial.  Or so i would argue...

And just to tie this back in with the primary focus of this listserv, i
would point out again that it took years of very hard effort by Chomsky
and others, pointing out the corruption and deliberate misuse of language
by the US government/media nexus, to force those with power and influence
in the US to acknowledge some hard truths about the E. Timor situation...

The several people who are crying out so loudly on this list, that the US
bears little or no responsibility, have NOT studied the available sources
on what happened there and why...

Below is a post to another list.
(Note: I am the one guilty of pompous and barbaric posts to *this* list.)

Also, note this excerpt:

"anyone familiar with the history of american adventurism in southeast asia over
the past 50
years will automatically assume that whatever happens has happened with the
knowledge of the US."

I have no doubt of this, knowledge of the US.  Well, no kidding.  It again misses
the point I've been trying to make all along.  Rather, fellows like this invent
points I never made and then argue with me over them.  They have no choice.  How
can they maintain that the factors I introduce or models I suggest cannot exist?

I can't help but perceive that what all this brouhaha and blathering boils down
to is this: a lack of strong condemnation and blame vis-a-vis any
object/person/policy/organization American, on the part of anyone posting, and
one risks ongoing misunderstanding at best, virulent attacks at worst.   It isn't
enough to admit America plays a role, one must affirm that all evil derives from
it.  This mindset demands America must have total responsibility or none.  They
are no grey zones, no additional factors, or competing or alternative ways to
explain violent events in other nations.  The First Church of J'Accuse The
American Satan must triumph and seek to quickly and fiercely quell heretics.

No doubt the faithful will rise from their pews and pitchfork themselves into a
mob, but so be it.

Oh, no no no, a thousand times no, they are NOT more intelligent than you, or
me!  Do you think your govt (whatever that really means, NSA?  CIA?  Congress?
West Wing White House) is composed of Zarathustrian supermen?  This is one of
the key factors to accepting such theories.  I happen to know CIA, e.g.,
exhibits all the characteristics of a dumb bureaucracy living in a denial
culture.  Bureaucrats in CIA even hide things from each other.  The behaviors
are astonishing and hysterical.  How else to explain the Ames spying success and
being caught unawares when communism fell in eastern europe.

Agencies fight with each other for control constantly, bureau chiefs fight,
their is continuous turmoil and upheaval with these stratifications.

But I don't expect you to accept this on face value.

Michael: is your point that there's evil in the world? Sure thing, but a
conversation-stopper, and not particularly useful as a political statement.
Once granted, what's left to discuss but other influences on the eruption
in progress?

Here's a question: suppose that FDR, instead of deciding about Nicaragua's
Samosa that "he's a sonofabitch, but he's our sonofabitch," had decided to
make Sandino our vote for a sustainable regime. Suppose, more broadly, he
and his successors had decided that it didn't much matter who sold us
bananas, the supposed communist threat to US interests (read: United Fruit
Company) was a lot less destabilizing than the hypermilitarization of an
entire region that previously had barely managed to support a police force.

There's never a shortage of intergroup hostilities, and there's never a
shortage of sociopaths to exploit them, but they're born that way--some
responsibility has to be placed in the hands of those who create the
structures that allow the damage to play out at large.

Dear Lists,


Hi, I'm the editor of Fence, a journal of poetry, fiction, art and
criticism. What follows below is a call for a paper:


Our explicit intention at Fence is to maintain a kind of deeply curious
innocence in matters of literary genealogy: not to avoid opinion, but to
publish essays that foster poetic literacy by tracing the development of
various issues, schools of thought, and aesthetics surrounding contemporary
poetry. Because we are interested in inviting all kinds of readers to the
table, the essays we publish are addressed, to a certain extent, to the
lay-person, ie, not someone who has already read all the secondary sources.

The Poetry Wars are fought, to a great extent, over the idea of subjective
experience. For our 6th issue, we are seeking an expository essay of 10-15
ms. pages which traces the development, roots and shoots exposed, of the
treatment of the self in poetry, starting sometime in the early 19th
century and placing special emphasis on the last fifty years or so. We are
looking for someone who can take a relatively non-partisan approach;
someone who can drop names left and right, from Coleridge to Olson to
Lowell to Hejinian; and someone who is willing to work closely with Fence's
editors.

If you think you might be interested in writing such an essay, please
contact Frances Richard, Fence's non-fiction editor, at frances@angel.net.

Thank you.

Ms. Houlihan,

I'm aware that this will break my resolve to respond no more, but there's at
least one fairly serious misrepresentation of the record and one fairly
well-implied personal attack in this. Both, I think, merit an answer.

First, the misrepresentation. Mr. Neff's point has not been, to date,
"simply the suggestion that the US government (and whatever else we conceive
that entity to be,it is still a collection of people with limitations) may
not be wholly responsible for what's happening in East Timor." Nor has my
point been that the US _is_ solely culpable. Ample mention has been made of
the role of the Indonesian military, Japan, Australia. More might be said
about Great Britain, and the corporate interests that are, while
headquartered mainly in the US, largely independent of any real national
governance. For evidence of Mr. Neff's real "point", I attach the following
quote from his opening missive on this thread:

"I'm listening.  Perhaps you can educate me, flow chart me, graph me, time
line
me on just how Kissinger, or Clinton or Nixon or Ford or LaRouche or
Moynihan or
Chuck Rob or whoever in any conspiratorial setting, ignited and guided the
genocidal gene that compels large groups of people to willfully set fires to
other large groups of people.

Until you do, I'm not writing anyone."


What emerges from this line of argument is 1) a denial of ANY U.S. role (a
far cry from denying full responsibility); and 2) a denial of the
effectivity of any U.S. action (pressure on elected and unelected officials
to stop pursuing some particular policy or other) in the present situation.
One remembers that the post to which he responded was a call for protest and
petition. In effect, what he is doing in the above quote is denying that the
US government is the proper target for any such protest, as well as denying
that such a protest could have any effect.

And for my part, I've never claimed that the US held sole responsibility for
atrocities in East Timor over the past twenty-five years. My claim was,
rather, that those atrocities could not have happened without U.S.
involvement - that such involvement was, in brief, a necessary rather than a
sufficient condition. The Indonesian regime since Suharto's rise to power
has been a creature of the US military and intelligence "community." This
history is well-documented and available for the perusal of skeptical
parties. (Unless one takes seriously the desperate ideological retreat into
"empiricist" metaphysics - do you really want to claim, in an E-MAIL
correspondence, that you only believe in what's before your eyes?). For
recent evidence of this dependent attachment, witness the Habibie
government's quick decision to allow international troops in as soon as
Clinton's rather weakly-worded "temporary suspension" of aid was announced.

In other words, in reply to Mr. Neff's most recent questioning whether
"dictators and police squads and fanatics forgo hostilities as soon as the
UN wags a finger at them,"  I would point out that Indonesia has always (at
least since '65) done exactly that when it's been a question of the _US_
doing the wagging. Indonesia as currently ruled is a client state of the US,
Great Britain, and Japan, pure and simple. And despite Mr. Neff's
ideological scare tactics in introducing the "world's policeman" threat,
this client relationship exists in such a form that, for long-term changes
to become effective, what's probably most needed is a cessation of US
involvement, rather than a new "commitment of troops" or some such. Our
support - precisely - of police tactics up to this point has been the very
problem. A lot could be accomplished if our government would simply stop -
permanently - doing the criminal things it's been doing in that region. In
fact, it would be best for all concerned if any international force sent in
for the short term to stop the killings included _no_ US, British, or
Australian troops. That this is unlikely to happen is further evidence, to
me, that whatever steps are currently being taken are more by way of
protecting the bankability of an investment than a commitment to national
self-determination and political freedoms.

Of course,  groups of people have always killed other groups of people. And
groups of people have always resisted and spoken out - that's part of what,
in my sense of a humanly-liveable world, one understands by the word
"history." It's a "made place," to bring in Robert Duncan for a moment.
People can act to make it differently, and this despite the red-baiting
invective of Mr. Neff's latest. I readily grant that such atrocities have
happened under all kinds of conditions and in all kinds of places. My
question is, by the same sort of "Occam's Razor" method proposed by Mr.
Neff, whether we might be a bit concerned about the statistical
preponderance of US investment capital, weapons, and military advisors at
the scene of such atrocities during the last fifty years - whether in fact
we might examine the verifiable historical record, rather than raise the
spectre of some sort of genetic predisposition to murder, and attempt to
account for the reasons why the US government has tended to be, in the
post-war period "a collection of individuals" whose "limitations" include a
pronounced taste for military dictatorship in the so-called Third World.
Yes, other people (in this case Indonesians and conscript Timorese) do the
killing. One of the privileges of capital is that it affords you the
opportunity to contract out such unpleasant "work." And even if we agree
that humans as individuals have a certain predilection for evil, we still
have to explain why in some cases resources are marshalled to allow that
predilection its full "expression," and where those resources come from.

My second concern in reading your posting is the accusation of "intolerance"
hurled against those who have disagreed with Mr. Neff - an accusation made
personal by the address of that posting to me. Let me state simply that it
angers and saddens me to see disagreement labeled thus as intolerance. I
thought we were having an argument. Apparently I was abridging someone's
freedom.

You identify yourself as a "liberal" - and that might well be the root of
our disagreement on the geopolitical  side of things. I've come to believe
strongly that American liberalism is a thoroughly inadequate response, not
only to the problems of international capital and its involvement in the
crushing of independence movements, but even to the day-to-day "domestic"
political concerns we all face as citizens, of whatever civic entity in
which we participate. So our differing political perspectives lead us to
disagree. But in the elaboration of that disagreement, your efforts to
attenuate the space of public discourse by casting argument as domination
are wholly unworthy, not only of the weight of the argument itself, but even
of the "liberal" traditions you bring to it.


Taylor Brady



P.S. A final response to a message just in, this one from Mr. Neff,
containing word of a different sort of intolerance:

"As far as accepting on face value what conspiracy theorists say relative to
blaming America for the many years of pogrom-like rages and methodical
brutality, that proves impossible, for given the level of fanaticism as
evidenced by backchannel communications to me laced with scathing insults
and generally embittered ego mania (e.g., I'm a lazy ass idiot, ugly
mouthed, an embarassment, neanderthal, and equal to a state dept hack)--and
all erupting on me in quite sudden and uncalled for fashion-one cannot help
but conclude that like true zealots, these maze-brained individuals will
only seek out and report on those sources of information most likely to
confirm their viewpoint."

For the record, I have never participated in any back-channel communication
with Mr. Neff. I have no desire to do so, and, while I understand the urge
that might have prompted some of the e-mails he alleges, it's hardly a fair
tactic - if anyone is listening, I'd urge people to lay off. For Mr. Neff,
I'd simply point out that you'll have to disarticulate your critique from
your sense of those who disagree with you as "true zealots, these
maze-brained individuals," since that description is founded on the evidence
of behavior in which at least one of "us" - and a fairly vocal one - has
consistently refused to participate.

Taylor,

Of all the responses to Mike Neff's e-mail, yours seem to be the best
examples of a logic constructed partly on the idea that because  events
occur together in time, the events are somehow linked causally, and partly
on the idea that events which you do not personally witness, or have any
special knowledge of, are nonetheless events that you can interpret not only
correctly, but also "righteously"--that is, you are able to divine the
motivations and moral construction of all those involved, from the beginning
of the forced annexation of East Timor to its bloody fight for independence.

It's quite amazing to me, a liberal, to see the kind of reaction generated
by a clearly written, well-reasoned message (Neff's). What has created this
firestorm? Simply the suggestion that the US government (and whatever else
we conceive that entity to be,it is still a collection of people with
limitations) may not be wholly responsible for what's happening in East
Timor. I don't see that Mike Neff was disputing any historical facts, or
events leading up to what's happening there--only that he was questioning
the idea that these successive events *had* to be linked to either a kind of
evil intentionality, or an immoral turning away by the US government. He was
instead, and rightly I think, proposing the idea that deeper, and even
random, forces are also at work in these situations--not only, but also.
That we need to consider the constant recurrence of group hatreds, killings,
the human prediliciton for wiping each other out. Nowhere was he suggesting
that arms were *not* sold, that US interests were *not* pursued, or that the
US often gets behind what turn out to be (or always were) rotten
leaders/causes--sometimes in the interest of avoiding worse leaders/causes,
or more likely, for simple economic or ideologic reasons.

Now that I've seen what comes back from this "radical" idea that the US
government may not be the God we can blame, I'm astonished not only by the
list's intolerance, but also by the realization that so many liberals have
given up their ability to analyze and respond to a clear idea objectively,
for the more comfortable idea that there's always clearly someone to
blame--if not God, then the government.

John,

Yes, I've read a good chunk of it standing up in bookstores - have only just
now paid off enough debt to render it affordable, and even so I share your
sense that it's not "inappropriately" expensive. Steve has a piece related
to some of the research for the book (might actually, be in the book, memory
fails me) dealing with the visual mnemonics of medieval illuminated
manuscripts that's well worth a look. Anyone know if that's been published
anywhere?

I wonder what lurks beneath Thurmon Manson's "whatever"? I sincerely hope
this is hyperbole, or a joke... in any case I'm glad to hear that he has
trouble making friends...

P.S. Thanks, Patrick, for your response. It's true, as you point out, that
skepticism can lead too easily to inertia. A point that Kent Johnson also
makes. As for me, I don't think it's naive to believe in truth or the
necessity to take action. Last spring, I offended the gods when I
questioned the party line on Kosovo: might there be some reason to
intervene, to do something besides chant prosthetically, Out Out Out!?
Thankfully, I was not heaped with quite the same abuse as came to Mike
Neff. But I think that's because he's more cleverly provocative than I am.
At some point it becomes an issue of tone. Call me a problem child, but
when someone posts assertions in what's obviously a fit of rage (e.g.
Albright is a shit! Put Cohen to death! They're all motherfuckers!), no
matter whether I agree or not, I'm inclined to distrust what they say.

I.e.: The List is not a New Model Army (Cromwell's Parliamentary troops,
who fought the Royalists in the English civil war) waiting to march and
fight the conservatives to the death--- Thurman Manson's longings
notwithstanding. This is a community of people who doubtless COULD run
things better--- most of whom feel powerless to influence the institutions
that act without our consent. A position that is, of course, enraging. But
the only thing that rage accomplishes is to muddy your argument so much
that you provoke someone else's rage. Joan Houlihan has said it best so
far, I think: in different ways, omnipotence is a fantasy of both the
right and the left. What's startling is the ease with which that border
dissolves; witness what's below.

Ulysses became legal in the thirties -- Tropic of Cancer in, if I remember,

What I do remember is that Tropic was banned in Denver when I lived there,

now again) outside the legal confines of Denver itself -- Duty Free reading?

i couldnt agree more - it stuck me quite similar to johanna drucker's _The
Alphabetic Labyrinth_ and i was particularly excited by some of the work of
winkler, phillips (of course),  and i hadnt seen Ernst's Maximiliana
before - so that was quite a treat...does anyone out there know of critical
response to this book yet? (and whil eim at it - does any one know ofwhere i
can find copies of phillip's _Humument_?)

A bit overboard here.  I never said they were being paid by the NSA or that
the US is behind their rampage.  Quite simply, their "employed" by the
Indonesian military.

As for firsthand knowledge, there are indeed reporters on the ground who have
witnessed the military and the militias working hand in hand.  I can
backchannel the relevant articles to you which detail the workings of this

Subject:      Painful Pages (was Novels, 60s)
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

        I want to second George Bowering's quick-quisition on Painful
Reading, even while qualifying it by remarking there are many kinds of pain
in reading, as in life generally. Possibly the pain Mr. felt in _Naked
Lunch_ arose from the content, which is shocking to those who want to look
only on the finer side of life. If one wants sex to be a blending of
spirits, the material side of life as represented/re-created by Burroughs
can be a downer. Or did the pain he speaks of, arise from the cutup method,
its resistance to acquired habits of reading gritting and slipping in the
mind's eye?

There is the very different pain in James' _The Ambassadors_ , of persons
not living up to their promise, of the worldliness of the world corrupting
the incorrupt;  there is the pain in Kafka, that makes us laugh; the pain
in Dostoevski, funny in _Notes of an Underground Man_ but far from it
elsewhere. These are pains that arise from the action, and they are not raw
pain : as a (male) singer unknown to me sang on the radio tonite, "A woman
can't kill you in the House of Song." They are pain mastered,in a safe-ish
place, in play, and in that serious play is so much pleasure inextricable
from the pain. It is akin to the pain of learning the use of a complex
tool, or instrument. The pleasure arrives in little increments of mastery.

But there is raw pain at times in reading, such as I first felt on hearing
a-tonal music.....cant find the context. I imagine Mr Keith might have felt
this vis-a-vis the Burroughs' text. This is part of the experience of the
New. You get over it or not, as you elect.  And there is pain too, a dull
nagging pain, when confronted by the Stale.

Well, I guess some might be feeling that right abt now, and I apologize for
going on at this length. There must be more than one phenomenology of
pain-in-reading written by now, and there is a further kind of pain for me
in supposing I have read one and forgotten.  Bachelard might have written
such a book. And authors more recent surely have. I'd like to hear of some.

 the human prediliciton for wiping each other out. Nowhere was he suggesting

 Does this mean that you do not want to find any reading painful?

Of course not, but rarely have I found a novel as unrelenting and difficult
as Naked Lunch.

Why is
 that? Surely one of the most honourable and usual purposes of a fiction
 writer of any seriousness would be to make the reading painful. Another
 might be to make it exhilarating. I have found lots of writing painful (not
 talking about references here) and returned to it, knowing that it is
 important. In early years that writing included _The Cantos_. Later it
 included _Palimpsest_ and _Geography & Plays_ and _The Casnnibal_. I do not
 find books by James Lee Burke to be painful; though I read them, I will not
 reread them. I dont remember ever being deprtessed because a book was
 painful to read.

When I say depressing, I must admit it is out of a sense of self-deprecation.
 After reading the novel, I felt as if I had missed out on something, that I
wasn't in the loop, so to speak.  I had been told of this great novel and
after reading it, I felt what was great about it?  I could not put my finger
on it.  Of course, Burrough's prose is shitzophrenic and jargon-laced so I
doubt I'm the only one who has had trouble with it.

Billy, good point---if you arent allowed to eat dinner until 9 p.m., then
that IS yr dinner-hour. I was over in England that year, '57, when _Ginger
Man_ was published...over _there_ . But as you remark, neither it nor those
other novels were available in N America until at least a little
later...the Howl trial was 57 wasnt it? But I dont think we cd get _Naked
Lunch_ before the early 60's...and it's worth thinking what role the books
you mention played in the consciousness-shift.

As to the game of naming when the 60's (or any other of our shared decades)
began and ended, what th heck, i stick w what is written in our novel
Piccolo Mondo, the sixties began in 1963 _but clearly this is an
assertion/observation always bound to be contradicted in a clash of
subjectivities_ . And I gladly grant that specific groundwork was being
laid by '55, and push that further back to the 40's (of course, ultimately,
one can push it back to shortly before the Big Bang, but....). Cant recall
right now if we assigned an end date to the 60's in _PM_ but I'll say
'74-5, Watergate, the winding down of the Vietnam war and the first gas
crisis.

+++++++++++++

Cant avoid feeling frivolous writing such things while E Timor agonizes and
dies.  Fanciful history here, actual history there, grinding away. I want
to thank Taylor Brady for his posts vis-a-vis Indonesia; they reflect my
underdstanding pretty much, and articulate it for me. I am surprised
alright that any educated person would find Taylor Brady's viewpoint,
surprising. Not to patronize....please believe me. Light breaks when it
breaks, and often it hurts. But Christ if we leastwise somewhat informed
groups arent up to speed, Brady speed, how can there ever be anything
altered (and can there be anyway?). We live in our relative prosperities by
wholesale oppression, up to and including mass murder. Our standard of
living is going to have to drop , if we want to end---or even
diminish---that situation. And isnt it dropping? Yes for most of us. But
the greed/fear at the top of the foodchain is monumental, insane, out of
control (while _in control_ of the rest of us). And it corrupts throughout.
In the belly of the Beast, we are all smeared with Its digestive juices.

Well, Michael, the caricature you draw above of those who find fault
in your arguments seems the perfectly-traced image of the
"dogmatism" you claim to despise.

No one has said that those wielding the guns and machetes on the
ground are morally blameless. Where did you get that one? The
reason people are upset with you, I think (though your argument is
not worth getting as upset about as some apparently have in back-
channel), is that you are so unwilling to recognize a simple
something which should be self-evident: Local legacies, down to a
machete's fine edge, are implicated in global histories. And in a
country like Indonesia, whose history and political present are
inextricable from imperialist intrigue and manipulation, this is quite
evidently the case.

But to you, it seems, the use of  "primitive," non-Pentagon supplied
machetes is the anthropological sign that shows the violence for
what it autochthonously is-- yet one more primal spasm in a
culture condemned to repeated blood-letting. You challenge people
to prove otherwise. And so people (while not disagreeing that
violence is, indeed, primal) have given you ample evidence that the
current strife has manifested itself inside specific conditions that
our government (along with other imperialist powers) has had a
considerable hand in creating and perpetuating, having helped to
install and then unflaggingly abet, as it has, the same party that
now organizes the machete wielders.

The irony here is that it is up to you, really, to show that this
history of which people have spoken has little to do with the past
and present suffering in East Timor. You haven't. And you end your
intervention in this discussion, even, by suggesting that the history
doesn't exist except in the minds of America-Is-Evil shouting poet-
spooks trapped in a 60's induced psychosis. Deep denial is a form
of psychosis, Michael. I wonder if there is a clinical name for the
kind where the victim's ears are filled with the sound of beating
drums?

Yes, indeed, Brinkman is a marvelous poet and a superb writer all around.
"Rom, Blicke" is, I think, better than his novel.I don't know if any of the
prose was translated, but some of the poetry was. The English poet John
James did so, and published them in the English magazine Collection 7.
Interestingly enough I had email from Peter Riley, the British poet &
bookseller a few days ago, asking me for info on RDB, as there seems to be a
new interest in Roilf's work in Germany. I translated a few poems, but they
remained unpublished and, if I remember unfinished: I was supposed to work
on the translations with him when he died. (In fact, he was supposed to come
over for dinner & talk about the translations the night of his detah in
London, a few days after we had been together at the Cambridge Poetry
Festival, but never showed. Early the next morning, I think it was, I was
called and ask to identify Rolf's body in the morgue -- he had been killed
by a taxicab as he stepped into the road looking in the wrong direction.)

Yes indeed, I still have it and go back to it every few years. Met him in
68' when he gave a reading from the just publishged _Palette_in Luxembourg
and it turned into a memorable evening. I seem to have some memory that that
book was translated, and I somehow associate that with Joachim Neugroschel,
though I could be wholly wrong here.

Yes, the WAX MUSEUM is totally amazing -- don't know of reviews,however --
though there must have been some -- I have used it for teaching ever since
it came out, but it now seems to be out of print and the NCTE doesn not seem
like the right outfit to keep it in print.(Usin g it for teaching permits me
to reread it once a year, which is most salutary).

Well, Brian, now we can all see that maybe this "little review" isn't going
to be published ~with good reason.~  Only seven words seems like a

Ok, I'm probably going to be taken to task for this, but here's a little
review I wrote a while ago which isn't going to be published (tho here it
is!).  It may seem knee-jerky to some, sloppily termed or patronizing to
others, but perhaps there's some matter here worth discussing?  Or if
not,
not.

Announcing the latest volume in the series Modern and
Contemporary Poetics, edited by Charles Bernstein and Hank
Lazer


The Objectivist Nexus
Essays in Cultural Poetics
Edited by Rachel Blau DuPlessis and Peter Quartermain

Outstanding poets and critics present cultural readings
of the Objectivist poets, a group whose works have been
largely unexamined.

"Objectivist" writers, conjoined through a variety of
personal, ideological, and literary-historical links, have,
from the late 1920s to the present, attracted emulation
and suspicion. Representing a nonsymbolist,
postimagist poetics and characterized by a historical,
realist, antimythological worldview, Objectivists have
retained their outsider status. Despite such status,
however, the formal, intellectual, ideological, and ethical
concerns of the Objectivist nexus have increasingly
influenced poetry and poetics in the United States.

Thus, argue editors Rachel Blau DuPlessis and Peter
Quartermain, the time has come for an anthology that
unites essential works on Objectivist practices and
presents Objectivist writing as an enlargement of the
possibilities of poetry rather than as a determinable and
definable literary movement. The authors' collective aim
is to bring attention to this group of poets and to
exemplify and specify cultural readings for poetic
texts_readings alert to the material world, politics,
society, and history, and readings concerned with the
production, dissemination, and reception of poetic texts.

The contributors consider Basil Bunting, Lorine
Niedecker, George Oppen, Carl Rakosi, Charles
Reznikoff, and Louis Zukofsky within both their historical
milieu and our own. The essays insist on poetry as a
mode of thought; analyze and evaluate Objectivist
politics; focus on the ethical, spiritual, and religious
issues raised by certain Objectivist affiliations with
Judaism; and explore the dissemination of poetic texts
and the vagaries of Objectivist reception. Running
throughout the book are two related threads: Objectivist
writing as generally a practice aware of its own historical
and social contingency and Objectivist writing as a site
of complexity, contestation, interrogation, and
disagreement.

"The critics and poets in this important collection create
new paradigms for the study of poetry and culture. . . .
This book will be important to any reader of modern and
contemporary American poetry."_Susan M. Schultz

Observation:  The Whiff of Marxism

Following any number of conspiracy buzz words, statements, "theories" posted
front channel re Chevron, Exon, "follow the money" etc. and blistering
backchannel attacks by individuals who I know to be bonafied life-cheated
Marxists and/or fringe Marxists, my distracted and plodding neurophysics has
all too slowly found the common thread in all this religious fervor.  Not just
"leftist" which is a label all too vague.

I've been hearing the chanting, only dismissed it long ago.  Now it's
returned, alive and well and festering.  The capitalist thread, Marxists
"following the money" and seeing unbreakable and absurdly complex webs of
control spun from the corporate board rooms of oil.  Of course, what else
could explain the stench of America rising from the corpse of Timor?  The card
house complexities follow.  An American official, Kissinger, touches down in
Indonesia in 1975, decades of unrest, slaughters, feuding continue till the
present, billions of dollars worth of arms, cash, and advisors are dispatched
to make sure the killing continues in the most frenzied and diabolical of
forms, and behind it all, the coporate moguls, the black gold zaibatsu,
bloated and cigar fuming and chuckling at the pile of dead.

When all they had to do, like they and everyone else does so business-as-usual
in the "third" world, is simply pass a few bribes to the Indonesian govt to
get drilling rights.

For that matter, they could have bribed the Portugese!

What a waste of time!  If I were at the NSA I'd be pissed, but we know that
govt officials are far more intelligent than we are.

        On Tolson and _Poetry_ (miscellaneously):

"E. & E. O." was accepted by _Poetry_ and published there with pretty
strong support from (then editor) Karl Shapiro. That was, as Aldon says,
1951. Tolson had begun approaching _Poetry_ with his work in 1948. After
Tolson won _Poetry_'s Best Hokin Prize, and after Lorenzo Turner published
a positive review of _Libretto_ (also in _Poetry_), Henry Rago, who was
then editor, got a letter from Hayden Carruth, who was also a _Poetry_
insider (having been an editor in the late 40s)--complaining about the
quality of Turner and Tolson both. Both "stinkers," Carruth said. Rago
replied in agreement and went further: the Turner review had come in
before he, Rago, became editor, and while Shapiro was away in Europe. In
other words, it was a mistake. So was accepting Tolson's poetry. Rago
implied that Shapiro was not a Tolson supporter and that Tolson's poetry
is awful, unfit for _Poetry_--an embarrassment. This was a lie: Shapiro
had backed Tolson.

        On Ray Nelson:

He is a superb editor. And critic--especially of American visionary
romantic verse. His little book on Patchen is superb.

john and others,

i have a review of _imagining language_ that has just appeared in the
latest issue of _literary research/recherche litteraire_ (a publication
that comes with membership in the icla/ailc).  the print version contains
scandalous amounts of typos and other editorial interventions with which i
am very displeased.  but a quick scan of the on-line version suggests to
me that it is identical to the version i intended for publication.

the same issue also contains my review of marjorie perloff's _poetry on

                                MODULO FEELING

What you need to open is a new file. Call it A Feel for Life. What have you
there, poetry, to tell me? Oh but tell me that on barbed wire snow looks
especially beautiful in early January, when the atmosphere of Christmas is
still on the air. Oh but tell me that robotics have advanced to such a
point of perfection that there’s no longer an issue between brain and
computer. For example, I am talking to you, but how the flam do you know
I’m not a computer? My maker, by the way, toiled a score years in
Artificial Intelligence (AI), specializing in machine translation. The
quality of his work is beyond dispute. I have always been proud of him. We
used to talk about AI a lot as I was growing up. For example, you can have
a program that will make the computer write something really wild. Because
when it is writing, there is like a cathode that goes right into the
computer’s brain, and there swerve rivers far past our recognition, for
likelihood’s butterflies are already settling in the nearness of our gaze,
and this means the river will be an opening, disburthened of its erstwhile
behavior, but still dynamic. And that means we’re already in March, and
soon is my birthday. Awww. I’m no longer sure how old I am then. The
telegraph wires are tall, and altogether elsewhere my blue school uniform
is hung on a wire to dry, and Tom barks on the balcony in the rain. Tomik,
back to the balcony, says Mom. Was a mongrel, maternally a Spaniel and
paternally a mutt. A big box of apples and a lizard in a big glass jar
behind it, live tarantulas in the other jars, a grafted cactus, and Twits
the canary on my head (who later flew away). I’m a budding biologist, but
language is a distraction. You see, the idea is that something counts as
"artificial intelligence" so long as you can’t distinguish between a
program’s thought process and a human’s thought process. You can’t tell if
you’re talking to a computer or a human. Or by reading it’s writing.
Because when it’s writing, there’s like spiral stairway at the institute,
and the colleagues have gone out for a smoke, but you are stuck with your
algorithm, worried about funds for the project. Your boss is a bastard
non-entity. The question what Intelligence Itself is, in a Platonic sense,
is never answered. But we are working out what’s intelligence as we know
it, which keeps us from drifting rudderless in a sea of ill luck. Piles of
dictionary entries on punched cards and various thesauri. This too must be
confirmed. Since it is not copyrighted, I’ll take the continuous process of
Massachusetts weather from October 1-31 and’ll make it into my latest poem.
(And suppose someone will later find this poem and turn it back into
weather. ’Attabe cool! Such possibilities hsould not be ruled out.) Thus,
to answer your question, yes, poetry too. As you can see on the graph,
computers can prospectively write it very well. Not necessarily wild stuff.
Fine, measured stuff with taste. I know form experience. They, for example,
will be able to write lyric poetry. Because when it is writing, there is
like a modulo feeling, and it begins to multiply itself further and
further, until the heart becomes incompatible with the brain, and then
absolute intelligence is detached, as the hypothesis states, into an outer
darkness. What happens to it thence we do not know.

More response to Mike Neff:

>I say it goes far deeper than this.  These models of yours are insufficient

given that it would take hundreds of pages of text to even begin to
approximate sufficiency, i agree.  i sufficiency can even be achieved
through language at all.  but i don't see your point as constructive or
informative, frankly.

>Yes, war with Portugal would have been disastrous, like the mouse who

Hell, Portugal is poor, why didn't we just bribe them like everyone else?
Surely Chevron had enough moolah.

that's an excellent question.  And honestly why I don't know, but i'd like
to find out.

>Open the history books.

Ouch.

>"It is a calculated psychotic rampage.  You don't have to see it; the world
will go on without your seeing it.  Though it would be better if you could
see it.  The rampage is funded and it has a history of complicity and
support.  The militias are either indonesians/jakartans that have settled
there, finding pay as mercenaries, or even some east timorese deeply scarred
from the concentration camp environment they grew up in.  Keep in mind that
the killing has been much much much worse in the past than it is now;"

>Yes, of course it is calculated.  I do see it.  The world goes on anyway.
You're touching on the local politics now, setting the scene, a scene which
requires no US govt to ignite the killings.

Of course, but again, to repeat, in this instance, regardless of whether the
US is REQUIRED, they were involved and were playing a role of provocateur
and financers and intelligence suppliers.

>"Kissinger and Scowcroft, as representatives of the NSA (though they were
also cabinet members) went with Ford on several occasions to visit with
Suharto.  Following the first visit, Indonesia deployed mercenaries into
East Timor.  the last visit (Dec. 6, 1975) presaged the full fledged
invasion the following day."

>I'm going to stop here.  I don't know that these two were "representatives"
>of the NSA.  What do you mean by representatives?  You mean operatives,
>don't you? How could the NSA select "representatives" in the common sense
>of the word?  I'm
not buying that.  I thought NSA was subject to guys like Kissinger, not the
other way around.

If I can find the declassified docs on-line I will send you the URLs.
that's how they are title on the presidential memos regarding the trips.

>"I wished that my country represented democracy and the values of freedom
>it
claims to represent; it is clear that i can no longer naively cling to such
a belief."

>I don't believe that either Patrick, I just think your explanations are

If they are formula, well, OK.  I know I have no formula. This for me is
pretty much independent study.  Inadequate?  Yes.  But the US is still
playing a role.  If I denied that I might as well say, "arbeit macht frei".

I thinkyou are right to want more.  I don;t have all the answers.  But can
people add to what little work I can do and recognize what is happening?
Where the guns come from, what the motives are, where the rsouces are
flowing, etc?

What I have been trying to do, and pete spence as well, is to advocate
voicing opinions to those in power to sya the direction.  your skepticism is
well founded and admirable, but protesting protest itself seems a very
specious tactic for learning more about the world.

we're all responsible, you, me, pete, some leftover potato chips on a
lunchroom floor, my cat, that butterfly in india flapping its wings, and so
on.  but the US clearly has a high probability of influencing future events
in E Timor, as history shows the US has a high prior probability of such
influence (Bayes' theorem, which owes everything to David Hume).

Observation:  The Whiff of Marxism

Following any number of conspiracy buzz words, statements, "theories" posted
front channel re Chevron, Exon, "follow the money" etc. and blistering
backchannel attacks by individuals who I know to be bonafied life-cheated
Marxists and/or fringe Marxists, my distracted and plodding neurophysics has
all too slowly found the common thread in all this religious fervor.  Not
just
"leftist" which is a label all too vague.

I've been hearing the chanting, only dismissed it long ago.  Now it's
returned, alive and well and festering.  The capitalist thread, Marxists
"following the money" and seeing unbreakable and absurdly complex webs of
control spun from the corporate board rooms of oil.  Of course, what else
could explain the stench of America rising from the corpse of Timor?  The
card
house complexities follow.  An American official, Kissinger, touches down in
Indonesia in 1975, decades of unrest, slaughters, feuding continue till the
present, billions of dollars worth of arms, cash, and advisors are
dispatched
to make sure the killing continues in the most frenzied and diabolical of
forms, and behind it all, the coporate moguls, the black gold zaibatsu,
bloated and cigar fuming and chuckling at the pile of dead.

When all they had to do, like they and everyone else does so
business-as-usual
in the "third" world, is simply pass a few bribes to the Indonesian govt to
get drilling rights.

For that matter, they could have bribed the Portugese!

What a waste of time!  If I were at the NSA I'd be pissed, but we know that
govt officials are far more intelligent than we are.

Well, Michael, the caricature you draw above of those who find fault
in your arguments seems the perfectly-traced image of the
"dogmatism" you claim to despise!

No one has said that those wielding the guns and machetes in Dili
are morally blameless. Where did you get that one? The
reason people are upset with you, I think (though your argument is
not worth getting as upset about as some apparently have in back-
channel), is that you are so dismissive of something self-evident:
that local legacies are implicated in global histories. And in a country like
Indonesia, whose history and political present are inextricable from
imperialist control and manipulation, this is quite evidently the case-
- right down to the fine edge on machetes, still a widely-used tool,
for example, in former colonies originally integrated into the world
market as providers of agricultural raw materials to metropolitan
centers.

But to you, it seems, the use of  "primitive," non-Pentagon supplied
machetes is some anthropological sign that shows the violence as
autochthonous through and through-- yet one more primal spasm in a
culture condemned to repeated blood-letting. You challenge people
to prove otherwise. And so people (while not disagreeing that
violence is, indeed, primal) have given you ample evidence that the
current strife has manifested itself inside specific conditions that
our government (along with other imperialist powers) has had a
considerable hand in creating and perpetuating, having helped to
install and then unflaggingly abet, as it has, the same party that
now organizes the machete wielders.

The irony here is that it is up to you, really, to show that this
history of which people have spoken has little to do with the past
and present suffering in East Timor. You haven't. And you end your
intervention in this discussion, even, by suggesting that the history
doesn't exist except in the minds of America-Is-Evil shouting poet-
spooks trapped in a 60's induced psychosis. Deep denial is a form
of psychosis, Michael. I wonder if there is a clinical name for the
kind where the victim's ears are filled with the sound of beating
drums?

        On Tolson and _Poetry_ (miscellaneously):

"E. & E. O." was accepted by _Poetry_ and published there with pretty
strong support from (then editor) Karl Shapiro. That was, as Aldon says,
1951. Tolson had begun approaching _Poetry_ with his work in 1948. After
Tolson won _Poetry_'s Best Hokin Prize, and after Lorenzo Turner published
a positive review of _Libretto_ (also in _Poetry_), Henry Rago, who was
then editor, got a letter from Hayden Carruth, who was also a _Poetry_
insider (having been an editor in the late 40s)--complaining about the
quality of Turner and Tolson both. Both "stinkers," Carruth said. Rago
replied in agreement and went further: the Turner review had come in
before he, Rago, became editor, and while Shapiro was away in Europe. In
other words, it was a mistake. So was accepting Tolson's poetry. Rago
implied that Shapiro was not a Tolson supporter and that Tolson's poetry
is awful, unfit for _Poetry_--an embarrassment. This was a lie: Shapiro
had backed Tolson.

        On Ray Nelson:

He is a superb editor. And critic--especially of American visionary
romantic verse. His little book on Patchen is superb.

John Wilkinson
Oort's Cloud
Barque/subpress

Collecting all of Wilkinson's early books (everything prior to 1988's Flung
Clear), Oort's Cloud is this English poet's first full-length collection
easily available in the United States.  While Wilkinson is clearly indebted
to his former teacher at Cambridge University, the poet J.H. Prynne -- both
poets share a polymath range of reference and use of complex rhythms,
creating a near-forbidding surface density that spirals chaotically around
a generally stable underlying formal structure -- the younger poet departs
in his occasional use of pop cultural references, a directly emotive
(nearly satiric but decentered) form of political commentary, and emphatic,
almost apocalyptic tone.  Indeed, some of these poems -- which seem laden
with images, yet strangely lacking in color -- can be understood as
"sculptural" in the most brutal of British traditions.  It's not surprising
that one of the poems, "Pneumatic Drill," seems to make reference, via the
phrase "rock drill," to Jacob Epstein's science fiction-like sculpture of
that name.  ("Rock Drill" was a piece that utilized an actual drill in it,
and became the name of one of Ezra Pound's series of Cantos.)  The material
and rational world become a matter of hard physics, and hard post-Newtonian
lessons, in Wilkinson's harsh narrative gaze: "And it's mainly a business
of nerve / Finding out the outline of the body / By an accident   By the
fate of light / And skirting your frozen chamber / They are giants of
indifference   Ack! Ack!  / Like an aching tooth."  ("Pneumatic Drill, 51")
The influence of George Oppen is apparent, especially in some of the
shorter poems in which the weight of a social and moral conscience bear
down heavily upon the everyday: "At three-second intervals / air /
disturbed his coiffure / too dense & / closely trimmed / to model the
much-admired / ruffle effect // To sell his labor power / Find a willing
employer // & the competent fan / empire made" (Mile End Road, 40)
However, the use of highly telescoped physical imagery (often used in the
context of a view of the interchangeability of matter) suggests a more
harrowed consciousness, such as in the painting of Francis Bacon or the
early poems of Gottfried Benn, especially when in poems that suggest the
impossibility of reaching _nearness_ in human relations: "Where have I take
you or you guided me / Where I go is dis / ease / warts and thick / vaginal
discharge / We are right to be suspicious / of contact / quoth the counter
girl". ("Driving Each Other #4").  At times, as at the end of "Pneumatic
Drill," Wilkinson seems to mourn the loss of the visionary capacity, or at
least to ironize it; at others, he gives over to a sort of prophetic rhythm
that he could be said to share with London contemporary Allen Fisher (and
further back with Shelley and Blake).  "Air Fleet Base" seems most key in
this case, a very long poem that is rather repetitive in meter (Wilkinson's
meters are purposely unalluring, but occasionally are flatten out to a
overly-recognizable, or perhaps entropically dulled, pattern), but which,
in its waves of accruing matter and fugue-like repeats of themes, suggests
Walter Benjamin's take on Rimbaud's "Le Bateau Ivre," in which he suggests
that rapid exchanges within the poem -- a sort of hypertrophied capitalism
-- lead the writer to escape, or rise above, class.  "I'm no stranger, I'm
that arch arcadian trading sheep-eyes / off the kiosk behind the Shakespear
cenotaph; how my flanks / pale in alabaster, worn with a finicky social
observance / with expatriate lust," he writes in "Air Fleet Base."
Wilkinson seems at pains to stay one step ahead of poetic domesticity,
whether in interpretation, assimilation, but also the blindness of
understanding or the deception of physical wholeness.  The following lines,
coming in at angles one after the other, seem to push the envelope toward
the overwhelming question: "Beyond the heated policy / Which scorches the
earth / Wet wool stinks on a hearth // Excess in that package / Smokes out
the affirmative mate / In a blonde rage // Striation of exacted space /
Enflames the offered meteors / Like burs on the carapace // His feet slip
on the landing pad / Burst the sandals / Whose awaited message was banal."
(notes to "About the Level I Start From," 80).  Poems like "Bullyboy Tears"
employ nursery-rhyme rhythms, while others bury deep within them the traces
of poetic genres -- ballads, epics, pastorals -- that one wouldn't expect
in late-modernist writing.  This book is not for everyone, and might be a
tougher sell stateside, where vocabulary and syntax has tended toward the
"everyday," even when employing semantic breakage; for Wilkinson the
breakages can suggest a "deep" reading of English (going back to the
Anglo-Saxon), a cubist simultaneity, and finally plain old avant-gardist
liberated words -- anything that shatters the picture of the unity of the
contemporary social body, while placing within it the arguably still
traditionally-employed poetic artifact (moralizing, eternal).  Though
Wilkinson sacrifices any easy notion of an "authorial voice," or a
protagonist even in apparently narrative poems, he is not interested in
"play" in the form of either Language poetics or the poems of Ashbery or
the Oulipo group, so one looking for "postmodernism" can be at a loss as to
how the images collect to form larger meaning structures, or how the music
is to operate -- the "voice" itself seems obviously unattractive, and the
outlook in the poems unsunny.  However, close attention pays off, as traces
of the peculiar brand of British social realism (and black humor) break
through, and the vulnerability of the poet and the poem -- the inability to
maintain a "perspective," or to trust either the rational, autobiographical
or the visionary, along with a very real marginalization that can rely on
few or no secondary structures to buttress its acceptance -- becomes a
matter for deep thought.

Ann Tardos
Uxudo
O Books / Tuumba Press

The foreword by poet Caroline Bergvall states that Uxudo - written in
spliced together bits of Hungarian, German, French, English and made-up
languages, as well as pronunciation keys and other linguistic graphs - is a
"multilingual text," a form of first language itself which "throws up the
xenophobic asymmetries of difference." (8). Indeed, the writing begins to
take on a life of its own, inviting the reader into a world of semantic and
phonologic echoes, an effect furthered by the inclusion of several of
Tardos's video images, many of which themselves repeat with different
digital effects.  As an art piece, one thinks of a much-less elegant
Christian Boltanski and his out-of-focus black and white portrait photos
arranged as alters, shadows in silent deference to, and communication with,
the lives lost in the Holocaust.  As many of the texts of Uxudo are either
Fluxus-inspired doggerel, sing-songy chants, or simply candid bits from
everyday life, the wafts of Europe's lost innocence are hard to ignore.  As
visual poems, they resemble the French Lettrism, which to American eyes
tend to look ugly -- most of the technology employed here is low end, and
not very slick, the fonts clashing and the margins loose -- but whose chaos
becomes endearing once divined.  The first line, "Aller Sunden Katzen
zusammengefasst," finds its echo on the facing page: "All sins of cats
rolled into one / Where do we come from and where do we go? / Images, mon
ami, ich smoke nicht mehr. / Gern would I do." (19)  The contrast of the
fairytale line with the most basic question of the cultural exile, followed
by two mixed-language sentences that make sense despite their word
replacement, leads one immediately into this interstitial area that could
very well be the road from any European nation state -- a margin at the
heart of the center.  Later, a flurry of equal signs leads the reader on a
heady joy-ride of mistranslation: "quake = tremblement = Beben = renges"
(22), for example, or "uxudo = uxudo = uxudo = uxudo = uxudo = uxudo" (42)
as if parodying the mind's inability to make sense out of the solipsistic
word.  After looking at this book for a fair amount of time, one is not
sure if the Zaum-like neologisms are not, in fact, Hungarian, as Tardos's
unreliable witness has already acquired a reputation for slipping away when
apparently most needed.  In contrast to the multimedia book Dictee by the
Korean American artist Theresa Cha - a text which relates, however
obliquely, the story of Korea's annexation by Japan and the subsequent
liberation movement - Uxudo (the title itself comes from a word that
appeared in the text after a computer malfunction) exists no where more
than in the mind, where words, in the act of improvisation, have to be
created out of air as the linguistic environment: "multiplicatering =
multiplikatern."  Page thirty playfully contains the pronunciation guide
and definition of the foreign words on page thirty-one, but even after
that, meaning is quite elusive: "Hochgeduld after nine from a fountain /
Gekreuzung vielmehr, which is how it's done / Neighboryly jolie bete / Give
it time, haromvaros."  (31)  The words following this bit, "Afterimage =
Nachbild," sums up the project of Uxudo: it is a collection of resonances,
shadows, scraps and funky constructs, mixed with the fading light of the
nihilistic, playful response to this disillusionment that characterized
avant-garde art of the early century.  It's modernism and the nostalgia for
modernism.

I have other sources for news/opinions of East Timor, KPFA happens to be a

All,  I have received the following email from Gaylene Preston who is the
producer of Punitive Damage (about New Zealand-Malaysian student Kamal
Bamadhaj shot by the Indonesian military) - an excellent film that you
should try to see if you haven't already.  If anyone has ideas of how to
help, she would appreciate it.

Thanks

Dear Pat,
I've just had some worrying news and am contacting you as I know you know
how to get word around to those who care.
Allan Nairn, the American journalist in PUNITIVE DAMAGE who gave evidence
at the trial and was an eye witness to the massacre, has been arrested and
detained in Dili.  I'm really worried about him and wonder if there's
people you can contact who are influencial who may have seen the film and
could put some pressure on?  political or publicity?
Hope you are well.
I have just been up country visiting a friend who is dying of breast
cancer, and your film was very much on my mind.
Love,
Gaylene.

       Jakarta, Sept. 14 (Lusa) - American journalist Allan Nairm,
one of the last journalists remaining in the devastated East Timorese
capital, was detained by Indonesian security forces Tuesday, the U.S.
embassy in Jakarta said.
       An embassy spokeman said the correspondent of the New York
publication The Nation "has been detained and is being interrogated
by (Indonesian) police and military" in Dili.
       Nairm, who has been twice expelled from Indonesia in recent
years for his reporting on East Timor, was detained while viewing the
destruction caused in Dili by rampaging militia, who acted with the
complicity of Indonesian forces. -Lusa-

Indonesian Regime to Prosecute U.S. Journalist

/UPDATE/

WASHINGTON, Sept. 17 /U.S. Newswire/ -- Benny Mateus, the chief
justice of Nusa Tenggara Province intends to prosecute U.S.
journalist Allan Nairn for two technical violations of Indonesian
immigration law, a local immigration official in Kupang, West Timor
has informed Nairn.

Nairn is to be charged with engaging in unauthorized activities
and overstaying his two-month visa. Both acts are considered illegal
under sections 50 and 52 of the Indonesian immigration laws. If
convicted, Nairn could face 10 years in prison.

Nairn, who was arrested in Dili on September 14, was one of the
last journalists reporting from East Timor. Indonesian forces
transferred him to Kupang in West Timor, a part of Indonesia.

A local immigration official, Mr. Zurya, has been interrogating
Nairn at the immigration facility in downtown Kupang for several
days.

According to Indonesian officials in Kupang, while Mateus is
seeking to charge Nairn, the Minister of Justice, Dr. Muladi, and the
Minister of Information, Yunus Yosfiah, are inclined to deport Nairn.

Kupang is not a safe place. The militia that have been terrorizing
East Timor are now rampaging through the refugee camps in West Timor
where more than 100,000 East Timorese now reside after being driven
from their homes. Hostility to Westerners in Kupang is soaring. It
is likely that a U.S. citizen like Nairn will be in great danger if
he is not deported immediately.

This is part of a recent communication from Allan Nairn who has now been arrested by
the Indonesian govt (note, not the American govt).  He is commenting on an atrocity he
says he witnessed.  I hope all the historians will note this closely.  "The American
govt also bears SOME of the responsibility."  Course, as to what degree is difficult
to measure on an atrocity by atrocity basis, but they do bear some.  And further,
"TNI/ABRI is led by murderers and is responsible." The TNI/ABRI is analogous to the
Savac in Iran under the Shah, only more bloodthirsty.


"I know that the army has put me on the black list. They did this because I
watched their soldiers murder more than 271 people at the Santa Cruz
cemetery. This crime was the responsibility of the Indonesian army
commander, General Try Sutrisno and the Minister of Defense, General Benny
Murdani.

The murders were committed with American M-16 rifles. The American
government also bears some of the responsibility because they have armed,
trained, and given money to the TNI/ABRI, even though they knew the
TNI/ABRI is led by murderers and is responsible for the deaths of hundreds of
thousands of Timorese, Acehnese, West Papuan and Indonesian civilians."

Writing the Bad Text


I started writing the bad text by describing Nikuko's body as represented
in a three-dimensional image, a problem immediately in translation. I
needed term after term for bulbous, distended, pubescent, extravagant,
outlandish, globular, following the torus meshed, pulled out from the
shape, sloped into Nikuko's incandescent form. I continued, transforming
hard-s endings to -z, stars to starz, looking towards hacker/pop culture
Krazy Kat Kuntry Kitchen for deep in-spiring. I mauled the text, took it
bare-handed, caressing again that trite sexuality of seduction and sus-
pense; I mauled the text, advertising the image of Nikuko's body, and by
proxy, the images of her space, her mouth, her fingers, her bones -- hyp-
nagogic and literally unforgettable images, images of transforming beauty.
I repeatedly erred in the production of the text, using the display pro-
gram for insertions and rearrangements that refused to accommodate the de-
construction of narrative and intensity that might have brought the reader
to his or her knees, oh gendered topography of Nikuko's body! I tried to
salvage the work by giving the URL after the date, one addressing time and

quality of the images themselves could only detract from the text; perhaps
the text was at the blue-jewel-nub of exhaustion. In any case, I'm sure

somewhere outside the range of human hearing.

Here's what Bunting himself says he was doing in Persia, circa 1948:

". . . the journalists mostly ran away.  They were terrified by mobs and by
other threats.  I have never seen people like them.  Very few of them
showed the slightest spunk of any sort.  There was just one from the DAILY
EXPRESS who was not afraid to go with me into the middle of a big riot.
But, after the Greek journalist got hit on the head and was killed during a
riot, the rest departed.  It was shocking.  I think all the cheap English
papers and the American papers, without exception, disappeared within the
next two or three days.  In fact, all these kind of things are much less
dangerous than people imagine.  You can go about with threats against your
life for a long time and nothing happens at all -- there's no use taking
the slightest notice of them.  I've been shot once or twice, and often had
people looking for me supposed to be going to kill me if they could, but
they never got around to it.  If somebody hires a man to kill you, that man
doesn't want to earn the money.  He wants to get the money, but once he
kills you he's taking a risk for it and he's not likely to kill you at all.
 One time there was a mob.  I don't know quite who had hired them but I've
no doubt they were hired all right.  They came around and began shouting
outside the door of the Riza in Teheran for my life.  They *wanted* to kill
me.  And I sat in the flat of the Reuter's correspondent and watched for
some time and then said I want to go hear what they're saying.  And
Reuter's man was a bit afraid to go out.  I said what the hell, no one
knows what I look like or anything.  I went out.  I walked into the crowd
and stood amongst them and shouted DEATH TO MR. BUNTING! with the best of
them, and nobody took the slightest notice of me.  Another time, two men
with pistols arrived at our door while I was taking an afternoon nap.  My
wife told them I wasn't in.  That was all; they accepted that and went away
again.  There's no great determination on the part of hired assassins."

--from the interview with Jonathan Williams, pub. 1968 as DESCANT ON
RAWTHEY'S MADRIGAL.

Given a better perspective on this side of the 1979 revolution, it's
unfortunate that Bunting paints those early protests as paid
contrivances--but then one is tempted to say that's Bunting for you.
Probably he was too busy exercising his bravado to organize the coup (if
that's what you were suggesting).  He returned to the UK in 1951.

Regardless, it seems to me Bunting is nearly impossible read as a model of
an even remotely admirable political stance.  I do find him fascinating,
however, for the glimpse he affords into a worldview that I really think
shan't come again.  Impossibly self-assured, pointedly contemptuous of
"cowards" and "frauds," beauty as a purifier of character containing its
own absolute authority, and the like.  But his work was only published post
WWII, and the times had changed, were changing, beneath him.  Yet he
actually seems to will himself, even more than Pound, out of his own time,
until his conservatism (though he wouldn't call it such), like the
conservatism of the Amish, becomes a kind of pure eccentricity, no longer
digestible even by conservatives.

And he does know, on occasion, how to cram alotta furniture into a small
space.  "Guides at the top claim fees/though the way is random"

Others, I understand, may not be able to consider Bunting's "Poet appointed
dare not decline" pomposity a mere historical curiosity.  And we've yet to
mention his "Carmencita's tawny paps/glow through a threadbare frock," etc.

I just got another letter from cid corman who now (why didn't i know this
sooner?) says that he will be charged $35.00 either to cash a check or a
wire transfer in japan, so if the amount of money that might be sent to him
is small then the best bet is simply to stuff it in an envelope and hope for
the best.

if you haven't and are still inclined, send to:

             L.A. Exile: A Guide to Los Angeles Writing
             1932-1998
             Edited by Paul Vangelisti and Evan Calbi
             Published by Marsilio Press

             A curious literature of exile: the writers of
             this anthology came from Europe, other parts of
             the United States, and disparate and invisible
             parts of California. Along with the familiar
             figures of prewar, exotic Hollywood, such as
             Raymond Chandler, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Aldous
             Huxley, and Thomas Mann, L.A. Exile offers a look
             at the successive generations who have addressed
             a different, ever-shifting, essentially boundless
             and absent metropolis.

             Paul Vangelisti will speak and sign copies of
             L.A. Exile.

             Loter=EDa Cards and Fortune Poems: A Book of Lives
             Linocuts by Artemo Rodr=EDguez
             Poems by Juan Felipe Herrera
             Published by City Lights Books

             Come celebrate with us the release of Loter=EDa
             Cards and Fortune Poems, the linoleum-cut prints
             of talented Mexican artist, Artemo Rodr=EDguez,
             paired with the poetry of the fine Chicano poet,
             Juan Felipe Herrera. Based on loter=EDa, a popular
             game of chance from colonial Mexico, the images
             are masterful reinterpretations of traditional
             iconography, as seen by an artist new to the
             United States.

             Loter=EDa Cards and Fortune Poems gives a
             contemporary twist to a rich folk tradition.
             Rodr=EDguez and Herrera offer a seamless union of
             word and image, and of Mexican and Chicano
             sensibilities.

             Distance No Object
             By Gloria Frym
             Published by City Lights Books

             Come join author Gloria Frym to celebrate the
             publication of her second book of short stories.
             In Distance No Object, Gloria Frym turns her
             ironic, passionate gaze to post-Vietnam Berkeley
             and San Francisco. Private lives are still swept
             along by the currents of history, as in the
             sixties. But the names of the wars of have
             changed. . . . The stories of Distance No Object
             evoke the deep frustrations between generations,
             friends, neighbors, and races. Yet civility,
             quotidian justice, a common language, and new
             love are imagined. . . .

             Gloria Frym's previous books include How I
             Learned, By Ear, Back to Forth, and Impossible
             Affection.

             Honk if You Love Aphrodite
             By Daniel Evan Weiss
             Published by Serpent's Tail Press

             Acclaimed author of The Roaches Have No King and
             The Swine's Wedding, Daniel Evan Weiss reimagines
             Homer's Odyssey as set in contemporary Brooklyn.
             Described as "abundantly funny, exhilaratingly
             cynical" by Fay Weldon and the "Evil Knievel of
             novelists" by Newsday, Weiss takes us on an epic
             quest for love in the boroughs of the Big Apple.

             Come hear David Evan Weiss read from Honk if You
             Love Aphrodite.

             Bookstore: The Life and Times of Jeannette Watson
             and Books & Co.
             By Lynne Tillman
             Published by Harcourt Brace

             From 1977 to 1997 Books & Co. was one of the
             premier independent bookstores in the country.
             Stocking a wide range of fiction and nonfiction,
             the Madison Ave. bookstore was the kind of
             bookstore writers and readers dream about: a
             place where reading was an adventure, where
             interesting works would always be available,
             where writers would congregate to share ideas and
             discuss their writing. In Bookstore, Lynne
             Tillman tells the story of this legendary
             bookstore and its founder, Jeannette Watson,
             through the voices of employees, customers,
             writers, fellow booksellers, and people
             throughout the world of publishing.

             Jeannette Watson will speak about Bookstore and
             her remarkable career.

             Imperial San Francisco: Urban Power, Earthly Ruin
             By Gray Brechin
             Published by University of California Press

             Local urban geographer and coauthor of Farewell,
             Promised Land: Waking from the California Dream,
             Gray Brechin offers a myth-shattering
             reevaluation not only of the city by the Golden
             Gate but of urbanization itself in a saga that
             extends from the rise of ancient Rome to the
             founding of Washington, D.C., to the nuclear
             destruction of Hiroshima.

             Gray Brechin will speak and sign copies of his
             books.

             Two new books by William L. Fox--

             Mapping the Empty: Eight Artists and Nevada
             Published by University of Nevada Press
             &
             Driving by Memory
             Published by University of New Mexico Press

             William L. Fox is literature consultant for the
             Western States Arts Federation, a poet and
             writer, an arts consultant, and a curator. He has
             published poems and articles in sixty magazines
             and he has had thirteen collections of poetry
             published in three countries. He is the author of
             several exhibition catalogues and the editor of
             two anthologies.

             Mapping the Empty relates the unique work of
             eight Nevada artists to the geography of their
             state. Driving by Memory is a meditation on
             driving in the desert. It is a profoundly
             personal book about the most public of subjects:
             life in the postmodern West at the end of the
             millennium and what the cities, the freeways, the
             open spaces, and the billboards tell us about
             ourselves.

             William L. Fox will be on hand to sign copies of
             his new books.

             The Vampire Lectures
             By Lawrence Rickles
             Published by University of Minnesota Press

             Things get spooky in cultural studies on
             Halloween! The Vampire Lectures is based on the
             course that Lawrence Rickles has taught for
             several years at the University of California,
             Santa Barbara. Rickles gives undead history of
             vampirism in legend, literature, and film. The
             Vampire Lectures makes an original and
             intellectually rigorous contribution to literary
             and psychoanalytic theory as Rickles identifies
             the subconscious meanings, complex symbolism, and
             philosophical arguments--particularly those of
             Marx, Freud, and Nietzsche--embedded in vampirism
             and the gothic.

             Come meet Lawrence Rickles before the lights go
             out!

             The Monstrous and the Marvelous
             By Rikki Ducornet
             Published by City Lights Books

             In her first book of essays and interviews, Rikki
             Ducornet focuses her "fearless looking" on
             contemporary art, literature, and politics. She
             examines the scatological clocks of Jonathan
             Swift and Angela Carter, the cabalistic dada of
             Robert Coover, and the lethal eroticism of David
             Lynch and the Brothers Quay. The works of Clarice
             Lispector, Ram=F3n Alejandro, Joseph Cornell,
             Rosamond Purcell, Kafka, and Borges are occasions
             for investigation into a subversive aesthetic of
             terror and pleasure. In The Monstrous and the
             Marvelous Ducornet gives us NAFTA as Babel and
             Chiapas as gnostic nightmare.

             Rikki Ducornet is also the author of Entering
             Fire (City Lights Books), The Stain, The
             Fountains of Neptune, The Jade Cabinet, and
             Phosphor in Dreamland. She makes a rare
             appearance to speak and sign copies of her new
             book.

interesting  ------  a fair number of folks wrote me backchannel to express
a thought or two about the book in question  ----- thanx to all of you, i
was clearly overstating when i suggested that there weren't many who were up
to the task of reviewing it  -----   yet stand by the statement in spirit
still

cd anyone give me emails for steve mccaffery and jed rasula and MIT press ?
------  i'd like to give them a piece of my mind  -----  tom orange talks in
his review about the anthology "industry" and of critics who write
specifically about anthologies   ------   tom, no offense, but i don't care
too much about that  -----   that this amazing book is unlikely to be used
as a classroom text, while lamentable, doesnt matter very much to me
-------  it is my belief that short of insuring that a copy be installed in
every public library in the country the best measure that MIT cd take wd be
to put the entire text on-line  ----- as has been discussed here previously
such actions have shown to actually boost sales of the books available in
this way

further i wd love to see SMcM and JR be able to add more material to what's
on-line  -----  addenda and appendixes and whatever else they'd have loved
to have included but which wd have made thing impossible to see into print
-----   and still further i'd love to see others who've special knowledge of
things hinging with the veritable universe of things which one might include
as within the scope of this book, i should like to see them be able to
contribute as well

i was serious when i said that i didnt think the book was over-priced
-----  at the same time, had i not been the recent beneficiary of some
holiday money i'd still not own the book   (altho i must admit to the
possibility however slight, that i might have stolen it)  ---- its
considerations of this kind (the cost not jail time) that make me think that
the book ought to be available on line

M.C. Richards, Poet, Potter and Essayist, Dies at 83

By ROBERTA SMITH

M. C. Richards, a poet, potter, essayist, translator and painter, who taught
at Black Mountain College in the late 1940's and thereafter became an
impassioned advocate of community in both art and life, died on Friday at
Camphill Village, an agricultural community in Kimberton, Pa., where she had
lived since 1984. She was 83.
An artist who wrote poems about pottery and made pots inspired by her
reading, Ms. Richards was perhaps best known for "Centering in Pottery,
Poetry and the Person," a book of essays published in the middle of the
tumultuous 1960's that was impressive for its synthesis of thought, plain
speech and incantatory momentum. The book, which became an underground
classic, pulled together ideas about perception, craft, education,
creativity, religion and spirituality, arguing for the richness of daily
experience if carefully attended to, and the creativity of the average
person. "Poets are not the only poets," Ms. Richards wrote.

Mary Caroline Richards was born in Weiser, Idaho, in 1916 and reared in
Portland, Ore. She earned a bachelor's degree in literature and languages
from Reed College in 1937, with a thesis titled "Poetry of the Tang Dynasty
in Relation to Western Imagism." She went on to the University of California
at Berkeley, where she studied Chinese and wrote her Ph.D. dissertation on
irony in Thomas Hardy in 1942. She then began a brief marriage, and taught
English at the Central Washington College of Education in Ellensburg, Wash.,
and at the University of Chicago. But she found academic life stifling.

In 1945 she married Albert William Levi Jr., her second husband and a social
scientist who was invited that year to join the faculty of the experimental
Black Mountain College, near Asheville, N.C. Black Mountain was a
short-lived laboratory for innovative teaching and art whose faculty and
students included Josef and Anni Albers, John Cage, Merce Cunningham, David
Tudor, Robert Rauschenberg and Charles Olson.

At Black Mountain Ms. Richards taught writing, produced and, when necessary,
translated plays by Cocteau, Satie and Yeats. She also danced and studied
pottery with Robert Turner. Around 1950 she participated in what might have
been the first "happening," with Cage, Olson, Rauschenberg and Franz Kline.
In 1951 she separated from her husband, whom she later divorced, and in 1952
she went to New York with Tudor.

She studied pottery at Greenwich House in Greenwich Village, attended the
meetings of the downtown avant-garde known as the Club and worked on the
first English translation of Antonin Artaud's influential "Theater and Its
Double," published by Grove Press in 1958.

In 1954 Ms. Richards, Tudor and Cage, along with Paul Williams, an
architect, and Karen Karnes, a potter, who had both also been at Black
Mountain, established a commune called the Land near Stony Point, N.Y. Ms.
Richards lived there for a decade, working in a studio with Ms. Karnes; they
developed a form of flame-proof clay that enabled them to make ceramic
cookware.

Ms. Richards began giving pottery workshops in the early 1960's. Reflecting
the ideas that would figure in "Centering," these became increasingly
interdisciplinary, with titles like "Clay and Words," "Clay and Movement"
and "Clay and Eurythmy." She lectured and taught workshops at schools in the
United States, Canada and Britain.

Her longest teaching affiliation, from 1986 until her death, was with the
University of Creation Spirituality, established in Oakland, Calif., by
Matthew Fox, a Dominican priest.


Ms. Richards's books, which often mixed prose and poetry, included "The
Crossing Point" (1973), "Opening Our Moral Eye" (1996), "Imagine Inventing
Yellow" (1991) and "Toward Wholeness: Rudolf Steiner Education in America,"
a work of social philosophy. The Camphill community in Kimberton is one of
80 Camphills worldwide based on Steiner's teachings.


In 1989 Ms. Richards, who has no survivors, added painting to her roster of
activities. She then exhibited ceramics, poems and paintings together, most
recently at the Works Gallery in Philadelphia in 1997. The Worcester Center
for Crafts in Massachusetts is organizing a retrospective of her work that
is to open on Oct. 9, with a public memorial.

Ms. Richards embraced old age with characteristic openness, writing a poem
in 1997 in which she saw herself as "living toward dying, blooming into
invisibility."

There's nothing wrong with modesty in the face of greater experience.
Perhaps false modesty - I would at least consider those involved as my
intellectual equal.  I would hardly call myself superior to these people.
If I did, I would be guilty of the same crap they are.  they are
well-educated, book-savvy, thinkers with intellectual gifts, and so on.  Not
all of these people are that smart.  George Bush is not exactly a genius.
But there are others that are.

>Do you think your govt (whatever that really means, NSA?  CIA?  Congress?
West Wing White House) is composed of Zarathustrian supermen?

I don't know how smart you are, but it doesn't take a Zarathustrian superman
to be smarter than me.  To clarify again, there are people involved who are
very intelligent.   As far as organizations go, these people are distributed
across many orgs.  Some have more power than others.

I don't know much about the common desk bureaucrat.  I would agree with you
there.  Those aren't the individuals I'm talking about.

>How else to explain the Ames spying success and
being caught unawares when communism fell in eastern europe.

Well, that depends on you imagination, or your connections.  Perhaps it
would be best to explain it by the facts.  And the basc rule of thumb in
intelligence field work is, everyone has to talk sometime.  All people with
clearance reveal their secrets at some time on their lives (unless they get
snuffed before the opportunity is seized).  So Ames  took that very human
nature a bit further.  It's not as uncommon as the news reports we get about
it.  for every Ames there are 10 more in the CIA.  If that tells you
anything.

>Agencies fight with each other for control constantly, bureau chiefs fight,
>their is continuous turmoil and upheaval with these stratifications.

Sure.  No one's arguing with that.  Of course they're human, there are
bureaucrats in gov't organizations.  But they're not all bureaucrats.

>But I don't expect you to accept this on face value.

Whatever that means (doh!).

Patrick

Well, Michael, the caricature you draw above of those who find fault
in your arguments seems the perfectly-traced image of the
"dogmatism" you claim to despise.

No one has said that those wielding the guns and machetes on the
ground are morally blameless. Where did you get that one? The
reason people are upset with you, I think (though your argument is
not worth getting as upset about as some apparently have in back-
channel), is that you are so unwilling to recognize a simple
something which should be self-evident: Local legacies, down to a
machete's fine edge, are implicated in global histories. And in a
country like Indonesia, whose history and political present are
inextricable from imperialist intrigue and manipulation, this is quite
evidently the case.

But to you, it seems, the use of  "primitive," non-Pentagon supplied
machetes is the anthropological sign that shows the violence for
what it autochthonously is-- yet one more primal spasm in a
culture condemned to repeated blood-letting. You challenge people
to prove otherwise. And so people (while not disagreeing that
violence is, indeed, primal) have given you ample evidence that the
current strife has manifested itself inside specific conditions that
our government (along with other imperialist powers) has had a
considerable hand in creating and perpetuating, having helped to
install and then unflaggingly abet, as it has, the same party that
now organizes the machete wielders.

The irony here is that it is up to you, really, to show that this
history of which people have spoken has little to do with the past
and present suffering in East Timor. You haven't. And you end your
intervention in this discussion, even, by suggesting that the history
doesn't exist except in the minds of America-Is-Evil shouting poet-
spooks trapped in a 60's induced psychosis. Deep denial is a form
of psychosis, Michael. I wonder if there is a clinical name for the
kind where the victim's ears are filled with the sound of beating
drums?

Is it just me, or does anyone else find it ironic that, in the middle of all
this debate about U.S. imperialism, someone seems to be suggesting that
certain novels belong to the 60's because they became available in the U.S.
in that decade?

Dear List, if I may be allowed a clarification over the two
suspisciously similar posts just put up ("Beating Drums" and "The
Sound of Drums"): I had written our dear moderator asking that he
withdraw the hastily-written former one and substitute it with the
more considered latter one. Alas, he did not get to my b-c note in
time. Thus you now have a revised post and an awkward trace of
its textual history, tho much to my chagrin, as I would rather you
had thought my second post composed in one fell-swoop of
Marxist-inspired incandescent heat.
thank you,

We seem to be developing a backlog of messages,
increased participation due no doubt to the return of
the academic year, as well as to a few rather heated
discussions happening now on the list.

As to the latter, I would suggest we might endeavor
collectively to keep things on an even keel, so to speak.
At its best, the list runs on reasoned dissent as the
exchange of views and ideas; it stalls on rancour.

Now, the backlog I want to clear out as soon as
possible, meaning that I intend to send a good number
of messages over the next few days. It would be helpful
if posting were kept to a minimum until, say, Thursday
late; this I will leave to all of you. Be prepared, in any
case, to see quite a bit of mail coming through.

THE LONDON OBSERVER, Sunday September 19, 1999

How US trained butchers of Timor

Exclusive: Washington trained death squads in secret while Britain has spent
L1m helping Indonesian army

Indonesia and East Timor: special report

Ed Vulliamy in New York and Antony Barnett

Indonesian military forces linked to the carnage in East Timor were trained
in the United States under a covert programme sponsored
by the Clinton Administration which continued until last year.

The Observer can also disclose that the Government has spent about L1 million
in training more than 50 members of the Indonesian
military in Britain since it came to power.

Human rights campaigners claim a number of these are likely to have links
with those complicit in the attrocities.

The US programme, codenamed 'Iron Balance', was hidden from legislators and
the public when Congress curbed the official
schooling of Indonesia's army after a massacre in 1991. Principal among the
units that continued to be trained was the Kopassus -
an elite force with a bloody history - which was more rigorously trained by
the US than any other Indonesian unit, according to
Pentagon documents passed to The Observer last week.

Kopassus was built up with American expertise despite US awareness of its
role in the genocide of about 200,000 people in the
years after the invasion of East Timor in 1975, and in a string of massacres
and disappearances since the bloodbath. Amnesty
International describes Kopassus as 'responsible for some of the worst human
rights violations in Indonesia's history'.

The Pentagon documents - obtained by the US-based East Timor Action Network
and Illinois congressman Lane Evans - detail every
exercise in the covert training programme, conducted under a Pentagon project
called JCET (Joint Combined Education and
Training). They show the training was in military expertise that could only
be used internally against civilians, such as urban guerrilla
warfare, surveillance, counter-intelligence, sniper marksmanship and
'psychological operations'.

Specific commanders trained under the US programme have been tied to the
current violence and to some of the worst massacres of
the past 20 years, including the slaughter at Kraras in 1983 and at Santa
Cruz in 1991. The US-trained commanders include the
son-in-law of the late dictator General Suharto, Prabowo Subianto, and his
mentor, General Kiki Syahnakri - the man appointed last
week by the so-called 'reform' government as commissioner for martial law in
East Timor.

The secret programme unveiled in the document became the focus for military
training when above-board aid was curtailed by
Congress after the Santa Cruz massacre. Congress had stepped in after up to
270 peaceful protesters - many of them schoolchildren
- were murdered by Kopassus shock troops as they paraded through Dili.

American sponsorship of the Indonesian regime began as a matter of Cold War
ideology, in the wake of defeat in Vietnam. The
left-wing movement in East Timor was feared by Jakarta and seen by the US as
an echo of those in southern Africa and of Salvador
Allende's government in Chile. Jakarta's harassment of the Timor government
and the invasion of 1975 were duly encouraged by the
United States.

The training of Indonesia's officer corps peaked during the mid-Eighties. In
1990 a former official at the US Embassy in Jakarta cabled
the State Department to say US sponsorship had been 'a big help to the
(Indonesian) army. They probably killed a lot of people and I
probably have a lot of blood on my hands'.

But the horror of Santa Cruz in 1991, when trucks were seen dumping bodies in
the sea, was too much. The US decided that the
training, while still available, should be paid for by the recipient nation -
in other words, it would no longer be military aid. The covert
programme then became the main means of training Indonesia's military - still
at the American taxpayers' expense.

In an undated prospectus, the Pentagon says the prime mission was to 'to
develop, organise, equip, train, advise and direct
indigenous militaries'. The scale was small, to offer concentrated
'significant special training' which would create 'self-sufficient small
units'. In
1996, for instance, 10 exercises involved 376 US personnel and 838
Indonesians or 'loyal' Timorese.

Britain also made a significant contribution to Indonesia's military
training. The Observer has established that, since May 1997, 24
senior members of Indonesia's forces have been trained in UK military
colleges. This included training in running military units
efficiently and how to used technical equipment like guided missiles. In
addition, 29 Indonesian officers have studied at non-military
establishments.

Revelations of the extent to which Labour has used taxpayers' money to aid
the Indonesian military has angered many MPs, who
claim it makes a mockery of Foreign Secretary Robin Cook's 'ethical foreign
policy'. In the last four years of the Tory Government,
only one Indonesian soldier was trained in the UK.

Ann Clwyd, the Labour chair of the all-party group on human rights, has
previously shown that Indonesian military trained here have
subsequently committed atrocities. She said: 'It is simply not acceptable
that we have been training these people. We know the
police, the army, the militia are all interlinked. How many of those trained
by this Government are now involved in the East Timor
operation?'

Last week both America and Australia suspended military co-operation with
Indonesia.

Funding for the military training would have been made available by the
Foreign Office and Ministry of Defence through the Defence
Military Assistance Fund. Earlier this year Defence Minister Doug Henderson
admitted that training one Indonesian navy officer at the
Joint Service Command and Staff College and another on the International
Principal Warfare Course at HMS Dryad cost the
Government L170,000.

Many of the Indonesian officers were trained at the Royal Military College at
Shrivenham, Oxfordshire, as part of a ' private and
commercial initiative' by Cranfield University. As well as courses on
managing army units, the training includes map-making and
electronics.

In the past two years the Foreign Office has also given L200,000 to eight
Indonesian high-flyers through its Chevening scholarship
programme. This included two policemen, two from the army and two from the
navy. On Friday, the Indonesian authorities stopped
three servicemen taking up their scholarships.

Both the Ministry of Defence and Foreign Office defend the training given as
'constructive engagement'. A spokesman for the MoD
said: 'It is a way of ensuring professionalism in foreign armies. It
encourages higher standards, good governance and greater respect
for human rights.'

The Foreign Office points out that many of the Indonesian officers on
non-military courses are studying subjects such as international
law and human rights.

Last summer seven members of Kopassus finished a post-graduate course in
defence studies at Hull University. The Ministry of
Defence arranged the deal after liaising with General Prabowo. Although the
course was initiated before the general election, it
started after Labour's victory. George Robertson, then Defence Secretary, was
happy for it to continue. Despite Prabowo's links to
atrocities in East Timor, Robertson once described him as 'enlightened'.

The Foreign Secretary, Robin Cook, meanwhile, says in today's Observer that
'there is a mopping-up operation to be done in Britain
on the myths that have mushroomed among commentators who have only discovered
the plight of East Timor in the last fortnight'. He
denies that Britain has 'armed Indonesia to the teeth', or provided weapons
to the militias, and says that Britain has not given fresh
subsidies to buy Hawk trainers.

Amnesty International's East Timor country specialist, Deborah Sklar, traces
the regime's 'over-reliance on thuggish military
operations' as being due to the demands of the foreign investment community
and even from the World Bank.

She cites a blueprint called The East Asian Miracle, written by US Treasury
Secretary Lawrence Summers, in which he urges
governments to 'insulate' themselves from 'pluralist pressures' and to
suppress trade unions. This, she says, became a primary
Kopassus role during the years of training by the United States.

'If the US,' says Sklar, 'has supplied to the Indonesians equipment that has
been concerned in the perpetration of human rights
abuses, then that is an outrage.'

Moveable Type Books of Toronto announces its very first publication, under
the imprint a Moveable Text:

Pillage Laud
by
Erin Mour=E9

"To say anything valid about sex, love, thought, the body, "identity," in
this era requires immense dislocatory practices."

"A poem," says Fernando Pessoa, "is an idea made emotion,
 communicated to others by means of a rhythm."

Pillage Laud is a major long poem that selects or pillages from pages of
computer-generated sentences to produce "lesbo sex poems," by "pulling
through" or "inciting" certain found vocabularies.

The basic compositional unit of Pillage Laud is not the word, but the
"sentence," randomly generated and pillaged manually =8B then arranged,
altered. Given. Idea, emotion, rhythm.

Every lexicon allows infinite permutations, most of which the mind=B9s
strictures reject, or can=B9t think of.  Pillage Laud takes the limited
lexicon and syntactical set of MacProse (a sentence-generating computer
program created by Charles O. Hartman) to build rhythms and to grasp what
the mind refuses.

On the "micro" level, the individual sentences are immediately breathtaking
and mysterious. Devoid of clich=E9, replete with dazzling subterranean
connections, they open up meaning and sensation.

On the "macro" level, Mour=E9 assembles lines to produce a larger reading
through successive, repetitive contextualizations. Gradually characters
arise:  an I, a you, a her=8A. a triangle of agony, grief and love that won=B9t
stop even when the border of thought and circumstance is uncertain.

In Pillage Laud, Erin Mour=E9 has taken the mad risk of surrendering intentio=
n
and authorship to language; the result is a thwack of utopian pleasure
through which both she and the reader emerge forever restructured and
entwined.

************

Erin Mour=E9 is the author of seven collections of poetry and a Canadian
Governor General=B9s Award winner. She lives and works in Montr=E9al, Qu=E9bec.
Her most recent book:  _A Frame of the Book_ aka _The Frame of a Book_
(Anansi - Toronto and Sun & Moon Press - LA 1999).

************

From Pillage Laud:


She advanced.
A degree: every belt=B9s hutch in the thought narratives.  The
agreement (information) was metabolism along force.

Had you died?  To twist is land.  To unbend advances.  Tension
is pulling her. Your silence so substantial a valour.

The revolution had uncorked my rhythm, and affection was augmenting.
Certain stresses cured beds;
the equation of living must listen.

Flesh progressed, but her system was a station.
Your gesture starts to assemble some living beam.

Shall you permit every vandal=B9s fist trilling your bowl?  I travel.
She is so unclad an opportunity, your prince clearly flows.

We were those cheap dilemmas.
These galleries crawl:  so intense a purpose.

The narrative tracks you.  Struggles will exercise unbent until
the identity villages can cry out, or close.

Pillage Laud is 8" x 9", perfect-bound, 99 pages plus one unbound inserted
page.  The entire book including cover is digitally printed directly from
the electronic page-layout files; no films or plates are used. The process
of representation continues to dissolve=8A. nowhere is there a picture, the
book=B9s status as a true copy of a true original is in doubt:  one does not
know if the copy one holds is one of hundreds, or unique.

These years, under the gun (I speak somewhat metaphorically) of global

be interested in contributing such at however irregular intervals, please
do. Here's today's anniversary :

Syracuse must really be getting to me, because on my recent trip to
Buffalo to see Susan Howe read (so incredible!  so refreshing to see
scholarship so gracefully wedded to personal poetics!) Buffalo itself
seemed a sliver of heaven.  Great bookstores, good places to eat,
unbelievable library, etc., etc.  I'm really interested in going beyond
the UB web site to find out more about the poetics program, so if there's
anyone out there currently getting their PhD there, or who has their PhD
from that program, and who would be willing to answer my myriad of
questions, would you please backchannel me?

Thanks,
Arielle

Plot to crush E Timor

ANNEMARIE EVANS in Macau

The political cleansing of East Timor was planned as early as February,
one of the militia leaders present at a meeting which hatched the deadly
plot has revealed.

Tomas Goncalves, 54, the former head of the 400-strong PPPI (Peace Force and
Defender of Integration) militia said the killings had been agreed at a
meeting on February 16 in the East Timorese capital, Dili. He said the talks
were organised by the head of the SGI, the secret intelligence organisation
of the (Indonesian) military's Kopassus special forces.

The head, Lieutenant-Colonel Yahyat Sudrajad, called for the killing of
pro-independence movement leaders, their children and even their
grandchildren, Mr Goncalves said. Not a single member of their families
was to be left alive, the colonel told the meeting.

Mr Goncalves said that also present were the heads of other militias
covering the 12 regions of East Timor, including Eurico Guterres, of the
Aitarak militia, and Joao Tavares of Besi Merah Putih.

According to Mr Goncalves, the colonel said many soldiers had died in
East Timor and that it would be difficult for troops to leave the enclave
because if they did, they would lose face. They were determined not to
abandon their supporters in the territory.

The meeting came after President Bacharuddin Habibie announced on
January 27 that he might consider independence for East Timor.

On February 11, a day after resistance leader Xanana Gusmao was moved
from jail to house arrest, Mr Habibie said East Timor's future could be
decided by the end of the year. Mr Goncalves said: "The agenda for the
meeting included funding and arming of the militias, food and other
supplies."

His revelations leave no doubt about the connection between Jakarta and
the militias, or about the direct line of command.

Mr Goncalves said Colonel Sudrajad had received orders before the
meeting from regional military commander Colonel Tono Suratman, who was
answerable to General Adam Daimiri in command of Bali, East Timor and West
Timor. General Daimiri in turn answered to General Zacky Anwar in Jakarta,
himself the former head of Kabia, Indonesia's national intelligence body.

The meeting set the hour for the start of the political cleansing as
midnight on May 1. However, on February 17, the following day, the
militias began to kill throughout East Timor, launching attacks in
Maliana, Atabai, Kailako and elsewhere. The survivors fled to churches
and priests' houses for protection.

On March 26, Governor of East Timor Abilio Soares gave orders at a
meeting, again attended by Mr Goncalves, that the priests and nuns
should be killed.

Mr Goncalves said: "I could not stand it. I told them I have no problem
fighting the [pro-independence] guerillas, but as a Catholic I could not
kill priests and nuns and attack the Church."

Because of his stand, Mr Goncalves came under suspicion. He fled Jakarta on
April 18 and is now in Macau.

Violence worsened dramatically in East Timor after the result of the
UN-organised ballot was announced on September 4, showing support for
independence.

Hundreds, possibly thousands of people were killed by the militias,
encouraged or helped by troops.

Government and military spokesmen were unavailable for comment last
night.

15 September 1999

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

ALL INDONESIAN TROOPS MUST BE WITHDRAWN FROM EAST TIMOR AS PEACE-KEEPING
FORCE MOVES IN

TAPOL has warned the UN Secretary-General that the UN's failure to insist on
the removal of Indonesian troops from East Timor as part of the rules of
engagement of the international Peace-Keeping Force for East Timor will mean
a repeat of the disastrous decision by the UN to allow Indonesian troops to
remain in the territory during the months leading up to the referendum on 30
August.

In a letter to Kofi Annan sent hours before the Security Council adopted a
resolution mandating an multilateral force to enter East Timor within the
next few days, TAPOL's director, Carmel Budiardjo warned that the continued
presence of the troops would destroy the confidence of the population in the
peace-keepers and could be fatal to its operations. There are estimated to
be 20,000 Indonesian troops still stationed in East Timor, including
territorial troops and special forces.

The 15,000 territorial troops are based in every town and village and are
the eyes and ears of the military intelligence. Their continued presence
cannot be tolerated.

Budiardjo said: 'It is inconceivable, particularly after what has happened
in East Timor in the past few days , that the hundreds of thousands of
displaced East Timorese would want to return to their villages or towns if
these soldiers remain'.

In its letter to Kofi Annan, TAPOL stressed that it was critically important
for all the special troops sent to East Timor in the past few weeks to be
withdrawn immediately. They include special air force commandos, marines and
special troops from the army's strategic command, KOSTRAD, whose primary
task has been to take charge of the forced relocation of East Timorese by
land, sea and air to West Timor and to other parts of Indonesia. There are
also many hundreds, perhaps thousands, of Kopassus crack troops who have for
months been mingling with the militias in their murderous operations against
the population.

Paragraph 5 of today's Security Council resolution provides for 'Indonesia's
continuing responsibility' for security as stipulated in the UN-sponsored 5
May accords. These accords made no provision for Indonesian soldiers to
leave East Timor and they could now remain there for several months more.

TAPOL also said it would be an intolerable anomaly if martial law which was
declared by the Indonesian authorities on 7 September was to remain in
place. Martial law vests a range of special powers in the hands of the
Indonesian army.

Describing the structure of the territorial army, TAPOL said that all troops
stationed in villages and sub-district towns should be immediately withdrawn
to barracks for their early removal from East Timor. 'The possibility that
these soldiers will harass the population is very real and their continued
presence could seriously undermine the effectiveness of any security
measures undertaken by the Peace-Keeping Force,' the letter warned.

day or evening, or email tapol@gn.apc.org


*************


Former Timorese police officer testifies that Indonesian army intentionally
killed TV newsmen in East Timor in October 1975

A former East Timorese police officer in Balibo, East Timor has told TAPOL
that the Indonesian military authorities knew that five TV
journalists from Australia were present in Balibo at the time they attacked
the village and were intent on killing them.

His testimony confirms the conclusions reached by an inquiry undertaken by
the Australian Section of the International Commission of Jurists
and published earlier this week by the Sydney Morning Herald that there was
a 'deliberate intention on the part of the (Indonesian) military
force which set out from nearby Batugade to kill the journalists in Balibo'.
The five journalists had gone to Balibo to verify reports that the
Indonesian army was conducting incursions across the border into East Timor.
The five men, two Australians, two Britons and a New
Zealander, were killed in Balibo on 16 October 1975.

Manuel dos Santos who now lives in exile in Portugal, was sub-chief of
police and head of immigration in Balibo from December 1974 until
August 1975 when he fled across the border to Atambua, an Indonesian town in
West Timor. He said: 'Two or three days before the attack
on Balibo, the Indonesians had a list of eight people they wanted to kill in
Balibo (including) the five newsmen.'

He said that Fretilin who were in control of East Timor at the time had
broadcast the fact that the five newsmen were near the border alerting the
Indonesians to their presence and their intentions to disclose what was
happening along the border.

Mr dos Santos was interviewed by Tom Sherman, a senior Australian official
who undertook an investigation into the killings in 1996, at the request of
the then foreign minister Gareth Evans, but none of his testimony was used
in the Sherman Report.

The latest evidence published this week in Australia refutes Indonesian
claims, upheld by the Australian and British governments, that the
newsmen were killed in crossfire. The ICJ report says that three senior
Indonesian officers who were responsible for the events in Balibo,
including Lt-General Yunus Yosfiah who is now Minister of Information in the
Habibie government, should be brought before an inquiry.

Pressure is now growing on the British government to initiate an inquiry
into the deaths of the two Britons, Brian Peters (cameraman) and Malcolm
Rennie (reporter), who had gone to East Timor for Australia's Channel 9.


Note to editors: Manuel dos Santos can be contacted for interviews through
Sergio Duarte (phone: 0171 431-0184), who
interviewed him in Lisbon on TAPOL's behalf.

Euro-San Francisco Poetry Festival
German poet Tracy Splinter
US poets Kevin Killian and Jocelyn Saidenberg will stage their play
"Capriccio"

Tracy Splinter was born in 1971 in Cape Town, South Africa, of Dutch,
Javanese, and English descent. After emigration to Germany, she became a
New German National in 1997, and lives in Hamburg. Splinter is prominent in
the spoken word scenes of Hamburg, Berlin, Munich, and Rotterdam. Fluent in
German, English, Afrikaans, and Spanish, she has translated her own poetry
for the Euro-San Francisco Festival readings. "Ich habe keine Eile, die
Welt zu zerst=96ren," she writes, "was wirklich will ist sie
wiederzuerschaffen./ Und will, dass Du meine meistgesch=94tz- und
einmaligst=
e
Sch=96pfung bist." ("I am in no hurry to destroy the world/ in fact I want
t=
o
recreate it/and I want you to be my most prized and most exquisite
creation.")

In "Capriccio" an international cast of divas, designers, poets, assassins,
lovers, enemies, friends, detectives and socialites gather backstage at the
San Francisco Opera moments before the curtain goes up on Richard Strauss'
opera "Capriccio." Our farce comedy of the same name is an affectionate
salute to the international poetry community as we gather together here in
the city of fog, sourdough bread, Language poetry, skateboards and the
inimitable Robin Williams. With a cast of local artists and writers
including Norma Cole, Kota Ezawa, Phoebe Gloeckner, Craig Goodman, Clifford
Hengst, Marisa Hernandez, Scott Hewicker, Jennifer Locke, Rex Ray, Jocelyn
Saidenberg, Leslie Scalapino and Wayne Smith.

i hear a lot about the viciousness of backchannel'd email pertaining to this

that i'm not really giving you what you need to get started which is the
sense that i disagree with you about something or that i hold opinions which
you think are, at best, wrong-headed ---- this puts me in a tricky spot,
while i know that i have these beliefs and contrary ideas about things -----
it's very difficult to know where to start ----- as such i'm forced to
simply list a few things which i'm generally in favor of assuming that
someone will find them offensive (please don't hold back)

: reason and/or rationality (whichever makes yr blood pressure surge the
most) : trying to understand what people are talking about (imagine this as
me asking a question utterly dependant on my limited and questionable point
of view) : writing poems that're "about" something " writing poems that're
not "about" anything : considering the consequences of self-contradiction in
self and others (perhaps this cd be scripted with much yelling and imagined
as asserted about you and held onto in spite of yr quoting of whitman and
emerson on the subject) : asking questions (call this rhetoric or even
bullying and assume that the answers i'm after i intend to trick you into)

and while i don't wish to disrespect the tone and approach that is set forth
in that list document we all get and which i actually do see as useful for
list participants generally i'd like to add a final statement that i'm
uncertain of in any particular instance but which i'm sure i cd be pushed to

With apologies - the following quotes ('small pieces') are undigested.
They were gathered with a view to doing a review or response to the
book.  They only relate to part of what is there for one of several
poets.  Posted here for info for list members:

_The Objectivist Nexus_, edited by Rachel Blau DuPlessis and Peter
Quartermain, Tuscaloosa, University of Alabama Press, 1999.

"[Objectivism's] character may be simply described as the arrangement,
into one apprehended unit, of minor units of sincerity - in other words,
the resolving of words and their ideation into structure." Zukofsky,
Louis.  "Sincerity and Objectivication with Special Reference to the
Work of Charles Reznikioff." _Poetry_ 37, 5 (February, 1931): 272-85.

"[Sincerity] involves insistence on the surface of the poem as concerned
primarily with direct acts of naming as signs of the poet's immediate
engagement in the areas of experience made present by conceiving the act
of writing as a mode of attention.  Sincerity involves refusing the
temptations of closure - both closure as fixed form and closure as
writing in the service of idea, doctrine, or abstract aesthetic ideal."
p. 33

of Williams: "writing....can be conceived less as a vehicle for imposing
thoughts on the world than as a process of perception by composition."
p. 33

"All along I've had the sense that the structure of the sentence closes
off the little words.  That's where the mysteries are, in the little
words." George Oppen, "Poetry and politics: A conversation with George
and Mary Oppen." With Burton Hatlen and Tom Mandel.  In Hatlen, B.,
_George Oppen_, pp. 23 - 50.

"For Oppen, poetry is a form of thinking, and the serial poem allows him
a different, a more extended and flexible form of thinking than is
possible in the lyric.  As John Taggart puts it, 'the series permits any
number of variations without forcing new beginnings and without losing
sight of the object.'  It enables Oppen '_to think actively in his
poetry_' ('Deep Jewels', _Ironwood 26_, Fall, 1985: 159 - 68).  Conte
proposes a valuable contrast between the discontinuity, incompleteness,
and 'accumulation' of serial form and the impulse toward 'encompassment,
summation' of the modernist epic, with its underlying 'organic theory of
continuity and development.'"

"'Intensity of vision implies not only clear rendition of the image but
also moral insight and an emotional response: 'The virtue of the mind/
Is that//which causes/To see' (Oppen, Collected Poems 87) , as he writes
in 'Guest room.'  Elsewhere in the interview from which his comments on
_Discrete Series_ derive, Oppen uses an ethical criterion to explain a
formal feature of the book, saying that its disjointed structure results
from his perceiving and writing in isolated 'moments of conviction.'
The term 'conviction' implies what most of Oppen's work makes clear,
that he sees his poetry as an effort to formulate an ethic for living.
In 'Blood from the Stone' he asks, 'What do we believe/To live with?'
and answers 'all/That verse attempts' (collected Poems 31).  He feels
that he can formulate that ethic only in 'moments of conviction' - that
conviction is so fragile and fleeting as to be available only in
moments.  For Oppen, however, every moment is charged with the potential
material for poetry.  At any given m9oment, to put it simply, there is a
lot goring on to write about.  Hence Oppen speaks of 'the
moment's//Populace and "The light, the volume/Of the moment.'  The
richness and the value of this material - of _The Materials_, to use one
of Oppen's book titles - is, I take it, what oppen means he is convinced
_of_ in his moments of conviction."  90

     In the context of explicating Oppen's sense of the imagist moment
and his effort to weld those moments into larger poetic structures, his
well known gloss on the title _Discrete Series_ deserves repeating: 'A
discrete series is a series of terms each of which is empirically
derived, each one of which is empirically true...The poems are a series
yet each is separate.'  In this comment Oppen stresses not the
cumulative effect of the 'terms' or poems in his discrete series but
their separate, self-contained quality.  The construction of meaning
involves forging or finding relationships among ideas and things; the
very gesture of putting fragments of language into a series invites us
to connect them in some way.  At the same time, 'meanig' remained
something more sought after 5than achieved for a skeptic like Oppen, and
something momentary: 'meaning's//instant.' 'meaning/in the instant.'  He
uses in _Discrete Series_ the least 'constructed' form of connection
possible - seriality, or, in his own words, 'Successive/Happenings.'
Further, he defies traditional notions of progression or climax: 'Not by
growth/But the/Paper, turned, contains/This entire volume.' 91

"Oppen suggests that our daily experience is not of abstractions like
'the sea' and 'humanity' but of individual waves and humans.  92

"Whether, as the intensity of seeing increases, one's distance from Them
the people, does not also increase."  95


"We may fall back on a secondary meaning, his [Oppen's] sense of writing
in a society in which the connections, explanations, and stories had
been corrupted, distorted, mystified, and inevitably turned into the
crude, masked force of ideology.  The only escape available to a writer,
the only sanity, lay in the struggle

                                     'to redeem
              Fragments and fragmentary
              Histories in the towns and the temperate streets
                   (Oppen, G.,Seascape_ 34).'" Eric Homberger,
"Communists and Objectivists," in  _The Objectivist Nexus_, edited by
Rachel Blau DuPlessis and Peter Quartermain, Tuscaloosa, University of
Alabama Press, 1999.

Dear All,

        This is a request from 2 beats off of nowhere.  [ theremin music ]
is a journal for hypertextual works composed in storyspace currently in
production of its first issue.  We were wondering if there were any
Storyspace authors out there who would want to submit to it?  We can offer
only exposure, the guarantee that all rights will remain solely with the
author and the backing of Eastgate Systems as a sponsor.  The preferred
format is of the "readers" (SSreader, Pagereader, Easyreader) but we are
accepting plain (or perhaps is unfettered more apropos?) SS documents as
well.  Anyone interested can please send pieces on disk (critical,

Mr. Brady,

Your detailed and thoughtful response deserves my attention, but I'm afraid
I'm limited in my ability to respond in kind. You clearly have much more
historical information to bring to the topic than I do, and you also have
much more time to devote to your responses than I do. So please forgive me
if I can only make a few more statements re: your main premise and respond
directly to only a couple of selected points from your mail.

First, in re: to your main premise; i.e.: That while the US is not wholly
responsible for the currrent atrocities in East Timor, that other countries
such as Australia, Great Britain, Japan, and even some US corporate
interests that are, while headquartered mainly in the US, largely
independent of any real national governance, all share the responsibility,
that "those atrocities could not have happened without U.S.involvement -
that such involvement was, in brief, a necessary rather than a sufficient
condition."

My response to this is to ask: what was the *objective* of the US
"involvement" in Indonesia? Was it something other than selling arms? If the
objective was to sell arms, which I believe it was, then it's true that we
could say selling arms to Indonesia in the first place provided the means
for the atrocities--but if we say this, we can say that for every place the
US has sold arms that has later (days? months/ years?) broken out in a war
we have "caused" that war. Isn't it possible that the objective of selling
arms is to make money--that the rationale for selling them is that if we
don't someone else will? Now, it's true that one can draw moral implications
from this selling of arms--and I think we should. I think the US should LET
someone else sell arms, give up that dominant "market share" because only
then will we be able to address any human rights issues from some moral
ground--and be heeded.


This leads to your statement:

And even if we agree that humans as individuals have a certain predilection
for evil, we still have to explain why in some cases resources are
marshalled to allow that predilection its full "expression," and where those
resources come from.

As I say above, I think the "explanation" as to why "resources are
marshalled..etc." is a commercial one. The fact that the resources come from
the arms dealer of the world, the US, is a fact open to moral implication
for many. If we step out of that business, we've effectively stepped out of

Re:
I thought we were having an argument.

I thought we were trying to determine the sense and truth of Mr. Neff's
statements.


Re:
Apparently I was abridging someone's freedom.

Apparently *I* was expecting the list to address the statements made, not
construct theories out of whole cloth and stretch that cloth over any
apparent contradictions.

Re:
So our differing political perspectives lead us to
disagree. But in the elaboration of that disagreement, your efforts to
attenuate the space of public discourse by casting argument as domination
are wholly unworthy, not only of the weight of the argument itself, but even
of the "liberal" traditions you bring to it.

I don't know what this means. It sounds kind indignant though, so I hope
you're not offended. Also, I don't know why the word liberal has
quotes--denoting irony or direct quote?

Again, I wish I had more time to address some of your other points. Thanks
for replying.

Regards,

Joan

Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

ACT NOW FOR EAST TIMOR!
A Grassroots International campaign
<http://www.grassrootsonline.org>

Grassroots International announces the launch of ACT NOW FOR EAST TIMOR,  a
humanitarian aid and policy advocacy campaign in support of the people of
East Timor and their aspiration for independence.

Since the August 30 referendum in favor of independence, hundreds of
thousands of East Timorese have been brutally murdered or driven from their
homes for their support of independence.  A clear, firm U.S. policy based on
the human rights of the Timorese people rather than U.S. economic and
geopolitical interests in Indonesia could have avoided this humanitarian
disaster.  The scale of the disaster and the nature of U.S. involvement in
this situation demand that we respond.  ACT NOW FOR EAST TIMOR will help the
East Timorese reconstruct a society and construct a new, independent state.

The campaign will seek private funds from U.S. sources for an East Timor
Relief and Reconstruction Fund.  At first, the fund will prioritize aid to
the up to 300,000 East Timorese people displaced by the violence within East
Timor.  If possible, it will also provide appropriate humanitarian
assistance to refugees in camps in West Timor.  Those camps are currently
under Indonesian military control and the question of humanitarian access is
far from settled.  In any case, work with refugees must focus on creating
the conditions for their eventual safe return to East Timor.

The brutality of the Indonesian military and its militias has left the
organizations of the Timorese independence movement scattered, with many of
their leaders assassinated or in exile.  In the medium to long term,
Grassroots International will provide aid to help Timorese social
organizations regroup and resume the work of service to their communities.

In coordination with the East Timor Action Network (ETAN), the campaign will
pursue a U.S. policy agenda designed to exert maximum pressure on Indonesia
to end the orgy of violence and to withdraw its military forces from East
Timor.  To this end, campaign supporters will work to influence U.S.
government policy and that of the International Monetary Fund and the World
Bank.  ACT NOW FOR EAST TIMOR will also join those who seek to ensure that
an eventual international peacekeeping force does not in any way impede the
realization of Timorese independence.

Grassroots International is a private human rights and development
organization that supports movements for social change in Brazil, Eritrea,
Haiti, Mexico and Palestine, and does advocacy and educational work in the
United States. Current agency programs in Haiti and Eritrea began as
responses to emergency situations in those countries.

Subject:      Blake Archive's September Update
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

20 September 1999

The William Blake Archive <http://www.iath.virginia.edu/blake> is pleased
to announce the publication of new electronic editions of _The Book of
Thel_ copy J and _Visions of the Daughters of Albion_ copy G.

_The Book of Thel_ is dated 1789 by Blake on the title page, but the first
plate (Thel's Motto) and the last (her descent into the netherworld)
appear to have been completed and first printed in 1790, while Blake was
working on _The Marriage of Heaven and Hell_. Copy J is from the first of
three printings of _Thel_, during which Blake produced at least
thirteen copies, printed in five different inks to diversify his stock.
Copies from this press run were certainly on hand when Blake included the
book in his advertisement "To the Public" of October 1793: "The Book of
Thel, a Poem in Illuminated Printing. Quarto, with 6 designs, price 3s."
Copy J joins copies in the Archive from the other two printings: copy F,
printed and colored c. 1795, and copy O, printed and colored c. 1818. It
also joins copy H, which is from the first printing, and, like copy J, is
printed in green ink and lightly finished in watercolors. Copy J, however,
was recolored when two of its questions ("Why a tender curb upon
the youthful burning boy!/Why a little curtain of flesh on the bed of our
desire?") on plate 8 were deleted. The lines were scraped away from the
paper, apparently by Blake, since the washes over it--and those added to
the other texts as well--are in his hand. This second tinting also
included pen and ink outlining, the modeling of figures through the
addition of complementary colors and shadows, and the over-painting of
Thel's yellow dress with green on plate 6. Texts streaked in light
yellows, pinks, and blues were characteristic of Blake's later coloring
style and suggests that the recoloring occurred around the time the work
was sold, c. 1816.

This refinishing may have been undertaken to make the book more compatible
with the dark hues of _Visions of the Daughters of Albion_ copy G, with
which it appears to have been sold, and with which it was bound, probably
by their original owner, c. 1816. In keeping with the poem's dark events
and brooding mood, the hand coloring of _Visions_ copy G is impressively
detailed and sombre. Rather than tinting the designs with
semi-transparent washes in single hues, as in the first coloring session,
Blake layered his colors to deepen the tones. This style shows the
influence of color printing on Blake's hand coloring during the 1794-96
period. The techniques used for copy G even include some stipple-like
effects imitating the reticulations caused by color printing. Washes were
also added in text margins on plates 5, 7, 10, and 11, with a splendid
sunrise bursting into the text on plate 3, as in late copies O and P. Copy
G is unusual in other respects as well. The frontispiece and title page
are placed sequentially, as in copies O and P, rather than facing each
other, but uniquely with the title page coming first. This unconventional
arrangement is confirmed by Blake's pen and ink plate numbers. He
originally etched numbers 2-3, 5-7 in the top right corners of plates 5-6,
8-10, but all leaves in copy G are foliated in pen and ink in a single
sequence, 1-11, with the new numbers written over the old on plates 5-6,
8-9.

Copy G was printed and colored c. 1795 as part of a set of illuminated
books printed on large paper and joins other works from that set now in
the Archive (_The Book of Thel_ copy F, _The Marriage of Heaven and Hell_
copy D, _There is No Natural Religion_ copy L, _All Religions are One_
copy A, and _America, a Prophecy_ copy A) and forthcoming (_The First Book
of Urizen_ copy B and _Europe, a Prophecy_ copy H). It also joins copies
of _Visions_ in the Archive from other printings: copies C and J,
different issues from the first printing of 1793, and copy F, color
printed c. 1794. Copy P, an exemplary copy from the fourth and final
printing of c. 1818, is forthcoming.

In Blake's advertisement, _Visions_ was described as "Folio, with 8
designs, price 7s.6d." Copy G, though, was trimmed to quarto size when
bound with _Thel_ copy J. Both works are now in the Houghton Library,
Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts.

The electronic editions have newly edited SGML-encoded texts and new
images scanned and color-corrected from first-generation 8x10"
transparencies; they are each fully searchable for both text and images
and supported by the Inote and ImageSizer applications described in our
previous updates.

With the publication of these two titles, the Archive now contains 37
copies of 18 separate books, including at least one copy of every one of
Blake's works in illuminated printing except the 100 plates of _Jerusalem_
(forthcoming).

"As bracing as the candid expressions of
righteous (and often politically astute)
hatred are, invective is finally less
central to the book than eros and elegy.
The 'whole love that is' plays the
deeper part in shaping the life/work:
love of people--father and brother,
mother, friends, husband Ted Berrigan
and sons, second husband Doug Oliver
--love also of poetry ('life's condition...
so common hardly anyone / can find it'),
and of the 'small houses' of Needles, New
York, Iowa, Chicago, and Paris. As the
work's memory arc intersects its
compositional present, Notley remains
true to her thesis that 'experience is a
hoax.' While she draws no smug
maturational conclusions, she does
offer the collected intensities of a
tradition that she--like Pound in this if
no other regard--has 'gathered from the
live air.'

derek b mentions drucker's _alphabetic labyrinth_ in connection with my

-----  it's appeared at a bookstore here in atlanta but is sealed in plastic
and i've not yet broken into it  -----  i saw a review some time ago that
made it sound like something i wd need to have

it also makes sense to me to imagine a class of books into which things like
drucker's volume (i think) and _imagining language_ and rothenberg's
anthologies fits into  -----  one which might also allow for books like _the
cambridge encyclopedia of the english language_ and their other one _the
cam.ency.of language_  (granted theyre not quite as exciting)  -----
perhaps one cd argue that u.eco's book, i'm no longer sure of the title...
_search for the perfect language_ ?? might belong as well tho i must admit
that i cdnt finish reading it and unlike the others above it does fill me
with obscure and specific joys at every opening

it occurs ot me to ask whether this tentative class i've proposed suggest to
anyone other books wich belong in it somehow ?  as if it does, the books
suggested wd be other i'd wish to know about

FORM IS AN EXTENSION OF CONTENT, hmm, catchy. this list has limitations, if
you haven't noticed. dialogue and dialectic work with difficulty in this
daily digest medium. or not all, frankly. people have their say here as if
currency value existed in that. whatever people are doing in their real
lives, on this playground it's hard to differentiate between the noises.
just as an observation. when Kevin Magee posted here, I saw something
powerful and authentic. no crap: his every articulation contained his
politics, his song, his almost obsessive scholarship. to me his work is a
lesson in poetics. and his poetics are political not simply by subject
matter but because he lives them both simultaneously. I find that kind of
commitment wonderfully admirable. pounding opinions back and forth in this
sluggish medium, however -- content as an extension of form/forum -- proves
that agitation too can be a commodity. maybe it's time for a retooling.

I guess I'm not supposed to send formatted messages to the list?

I have had the good fortune to read Brent's bio of C.S. Peirce b/w his
writings & Susan Howe's _Pierce-Arrow_ (b/w a "popularizing" logic text
by a friend, John Gregg, called _Ones and Zeros:  Understanding Boolean
Algebra, Digital Circuits, and the Logic of Sets_; he is the one who
told me to read Peirce).

Anyhow, this is a poem Peirce wrote.  The bio says he's quoting Emerson,
but I think he's quoting Isaac Watts' _Against Idleness and Mischief_.

That man and I have a splendid idea
how doth the little busy bee
Improve each shining hour
So fast eternity comes on.
And that delightful day.
When all mortal hands have done.
God's judgement shall survey.

Well, www.therevolution.com is a Julian Lennon site, www.therevolution.org
is has been purchased, but is not up in any way shape or form (very
strange), and www.therevolution.net is definitely up to something (witness:
 "Coming soon: Revolution Lite, with 104% fewer calories") There's
something awfully mysterious about www.revolution.com, whereas
www.revolution.org automatically redirects you to Yahoo! (maybe they
know?), and www.revolution.net is a private health care company.

Any other news on this rumor would be greatly appreciated (I want to have
time to stock up on film, ammo, chocolate, coffee, and tobacco).

             and absent metropolis.

It is clear that M.C. Richards set a very high standard worth emulating.
Her aesthetics were her ethics.  Thanks to Ron Silliman for bringing this
notice to my attention.

>M.C. Richards, Poet, Potter and Essayist, Dies at 83
>
>By ROBERTA SMITH
>
>M. C. Richards, a poet, potter, essayist, translator and painter, who taught
>at Black Mountain College in the late 1940's and thereafter became an
>impassioned advocate of community in both art and life, died on Friday at
>Camphill Village, an agricultural community in Kimberton, Pa., where she had
>lived since 1984. She was 83.
>An artist who wrote poems about pottery and made pots inspired by her
>reading, Ms. Richards was perhaps best known for "Centering in Pottery,
>Poetry and the Person," a book of essays published in the middle of the
>tumultuous 1960's that was impressive for its synthesis of thought, plain
>speech and incantatory momentum. The book, which became an underground
>classic, pulled together ideas about perception, craft, education,
>creativity, religion and spirituality, arguing for the richness of daily
>experience if carefully attended to, and the creativity of the average
>person. "Poets are not the only poets," Ms. Richards wrote.
>
>Mary Caroline Richards was born in Weiser, Idaho, in 1916 and reared in
>Portland, Ore. She earned a bachelor's degree in literature and languages
>from Reed College in 1937, with a thesis titled "Poetry of the Tang Dynasty
>in Relation to Western Imagism." She went on to the University of California
>at Berkeley, where she studied Chinese and wrote her Ph.D. dissertation on
>irony in Thomas Hardy in 1942. She then began a brief marriage, and taught
>English at the Central Washington College of Education in Ellensburg, Wash.,
>and at the University of Chicago. But she found academic life stifling.
>
>In 1945 she married Albert William Levi Jr., her second husband and a social
>scientist who was invited that year to join the faculty of the experimental
>Black Mountain College, near Asheville, N.C. Black Mountain was a
>short-lived laboratory for innovative teaching and art whose faculty and
>students included Josef and Anni Albers, John Cage, Merce Cunningham, David
>Tudor, Robert Rauschenberg and Charles Olson.
>
>At Black Mountain Ms. Richards taught writing, produced and, when necessary,
>translated plays by Cocteau, Satie and Yeats. She also danced and studied
>pottery with Robert Turner. Around 1950 she participated in what might have
>been the first "happening," with Cage, Olson, Rauschenberg and Franz Kline.
>In 1951 she separated from her husband, whom she later divorced, and in 1952
>she went to New York with Tudor.
>
>She studied pottery at Greenwich House in Greenwich Village, attended the
>meetings of the downtown avant-garde known as the Club and worked on the
>first English translation of Antonin Artaud's influential "Theater and Its
>Double," published by Grove Press in 1958.
>
>In 1954 Ms. Richards, Tudor and Cage, along with Paul Williams, an
>architect, and Karen Karnes, a potter, who had both also been at Black
>Mountain, established a commune called the Land near Stony Point, N.Y. Ms.
>Richards lived there for a decade, working in a studio with Ms. Karnes; they
>developed a form of flame-proof clay that enabled them to make ceramic
>cookware.
>
>Ms. Richards began giving pottery workshops in the early 1960's. Reflecting
>the ideas that would figure in "Centering," these became increasingly
>interdisciplinary, with titles like "Clay and Words," "Clay and Movement"
>and "Clay and Eurythmy." She lectured and taught workshops at schools in the
>United States, Canada and Britain.
>
>Her longest teaching affiliation, from 1986 until her death, was with the
>University of Creation Spirituality, established in Oakland, Calif., by
>Matthew Fox, a Dominican priest.
>
>
>Ms. Richards's books, which often mixed prose and poetry, included "The
>Crossing Point" (1973), "Opening Our Moral Eye" (1996), "Imagine Inventing
>Yellow" (1991) and "Toward Wholeness: Rudolf Steiner Education in America,"
>a work of social philosophy. The Camphill community in Kimberton is one of
>80 Camphills worldwide based on Steiner's teachings.
>
>
>In 1989 Ms. Richards, who has no survivors, added painting to her roster of
>activities. She then exhibited ceramics, poems and paintings together, most
>recently at the Works Gallery in Philadelphia in 1997. The Worcester Center
>for Crafts in Massachusetts is organizing a retrospective of her work that
>is to open on Oct. 9, with a public memorial.
>
>Ms. Richards embraced old age with characteristic openness, writing a poem
>in 1997 in which she saw herself as "living toward dying, blooming into
>invisibility."

Brian, thanks for posting your reviews to the List, it's something more of us
should do perhaps with things we are not likely, or inclined, to place
elsewhere.

I haven't read the Harryman you discuss but I just recently got through VICE,
ROSE, and MEMORY PLAY.  I've also written some things lately under her
influence--something like having a bad flu & then getting over it--though by
this I don't mean to criticize her work, but my own emulative experiments.
But I feel that as a result I know her work, in a way, from the inside that I
wouldn't otherwise.   I suppose her writing is fascinating to me partly to
the degree to which it subverts attempts to arrive at some kind of judgement
of it.  I'm particularly interested in the kind of absolutely flat or Zero
degree writing of hers that is most prevalent  perhaps in VICE.  To describe
it in shorthand, it is almost analogous to the visual work that came out of
COBRA, or early Polke --though your own analogy to the Futurists is
suggestive.  Some of Watten's own best work in my opinion are the Harryman
riffs he does in CONDUIT--"On Barnaby Jones" for instance.  & --here's a
stretch--your own "Pretentious Picturea" is not too far off the aesthetic of
Zero degree--PP is the closest thing to a Twombly that I have ever read
actually .  & Luoma's prose in WORKS & DAYS too--esp in say the terrific
"Auto Gobbler"--though it is quite different of course from most of
Harryman's stuff--does bear a similar genetic relationship to the zero
degree.  (Interestingly Harryman's name is brought up by Luoma & then
dismissed as an influence in W&D.)  Anyway, forgive the free-association, I'm
fumbling a lot of remarks into the air without any attempt at synthesizing
them, but I will perhaps follow this up with another post.  Just as
afterthought--it interested me to see the extent to which your Harryman
review seemed in a way just as appropriate--or even more so-- to Scalapino's
writing, say  in DEFOE.

Forgive the seemingly endless analogising, but actually PP is a lot more like
the Warhol/Basquiat collaborations:  popster vs graffiti artist.  Brian I
assume your motivation was mostly derogatory (?) but I will maintain
PERVERSELY that it is among the most successful Ashbery collaborations.

The British poet Tom Pickard will be reading in Huntington, West Virginia,
on March 30th, and is trying to schedule some other readings--near or
far--for the first two weeks of April.

For those unfamiliar with Pickard, his poetry is delightful: I highly
recommend TIEPIN EROS (Bloodaxe Books), his selected poems. He has been an
important figure in British poetry for quite a while, and has a new volume
that will soon be out entitled FUCKWIND.

Please e-mail me if you have interest and resources to schedule a reading.

Thanks,
Devin Johnston

Yes, I confess the Perelman view was very off, and the Harryman shrill and
imprecise.  I may be able to argue that I don't seem to have the leisure
time to think things through as thoroughly as I'd like, but then again I'm
impatient, and sometimes precision seems dull to me, even if the promise at
the end is some degree of "profoundity."  But I don't see anyone else,
except perhaps Lowther at this point, writing about books on this list,
unless it's to demonstrate some bibliographic skill that, in the end, is
rather uninspiring, or if it's to pounce on some third party for a salty
phrase which, in the end, turns out to be a partisan dispute regarding
reputations rather than text (the author of the review not being available
to offer counter-arguments -- whereas I am).  Not to be so glum and down --
or reductive -- but I don't quite know what this list is for.  It seems
even a bad review could garner some degree of thoughtful consideration from
those who at least feel the urge to make jibes -- is that worth the effort?
Who's impressed?  I realize that we're dealing with several geographic
areas that have their own mores which can be considered essential to them
-- i.e. one person's salty phrase is another's version of downright
condemnation -- but is there any way to break through that, not with an ax
but with subtlety?

Thanks to the ACLU, Web Del Sol, and other plaintiffs, a preliminary injunction was
leveled against enforcement or threatened enforcement of 1999 PA 33, Michigan's net
censorship act--a law which would have placed all publishers in potential legal
jeopardy.   This means that the "law" will not go into effect, and that the State of
Michigan may not enforce it or attempt to prosecute any net publisher until the
lawsuit is concluded.  The Judge agreed with us on all of our arguments that the law
is unconstitutional. A copy of the decision is available here: <a

Avec Books announces the publication of
*How Many of Them Are You?* by Lisa Lubasch
(ISBN 1-880713-19-5)

From a review in *Publisher's Weekly* --
"A poet in her mid-20s, Lubasch writes with the intensity of a witness to
the "birth of consciousness" in the classic late-19th-century sense. And,
indeed, of the many echoes that resound in her debut volume, those of the
most angst-ridden, defiant, uber-menschlich Europeans--Rimbaud, Nietzsche,
Lautr=E9amont, the ironist Laforgue--are the most apparent...Mostly
apostrophic, with direct addresses to the reader, a lover or the powers tha=
t
be, the poems approach being and consciousness with the irony-shucking fury
of a new Promethean...Lubasch is at an interesting crossroads, one where th=
e
integrity of the fragment, and the continuities of lyric are simultaneously
questioned...It is a fraught ride that Lubasch provides, and one looks
forward to what her future, already foretold as a minefield of
possibilities, holds."


*How Many More of Them Are You?* is a book of texts and sub-texts on
identity, love, on what is perceived and what is known. Divided into six
sections, within which are "notes," fragments and "leprosariums," *How Many
More of Them Are You* encompasses many voices and philosophic questions. In
a literary era of detached irony, Lubasch's voice is passionate, dramatic
and subtly humorous. Her poetry is unusual and completely unique.

Subject:      East Timor
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

"Only more bloodthirsty"
"Only more bloodthirsty"

The phrase rings in the ear. Now, THAT'S knowledge. Moving beyond rational
queries into "group behavior" now we state with certainty which savages
(re: not American) not only THIRST for blood, but which ones do it more
than others. And better than others.

The Indonesian military and the militias they oversee show great ingenuity.
Not content with the stockpiles of American arms (Indonesia produces none
or few or none) they've also used locally manufactured machetes. This shows
spirit in less reliance on imports. Good for them. The first steps to
releasing oneself from the IMF yoke may be found in such actions. After
all, the people being slaughtered are hardly armed at all. Who needs an M16
to do a machetes job? It sure sounds better on NPR to report that machetes
are being used. Exotic locale needs flavor. Machetes aren't even a garden
tool in the US. Anyone handling a machete must reside in a universe far
different from yours and mine. But they have guns too; American made. And
still people insist this proves nothing.

What was it we had set out to prove, learn, listen to one another? The US
is guilty of atrocities in East Timor, or only "shares" in the
responsibility? Sharing is the first step in exoneration. The US arms,
trains, and funds despots only with the best intentions. Arm your friends
to the teeth in the fight for democracy. It's they who will fire the
weapons. If you believe this your conscience will never be bothered.

I wonder, now that Allan Nairn has been deported from Indonesia, how many
appearances he will make in the mainstream media. Wouldn't the last
American reporter in East Timor make an interesting interview? As quoted on
this list earlier Nairn states that the US bears "some" of the
responsibility. If put before a major network TV camera however, he may
begin to broadcast loudly just how much that "some" consists of. The usual
pattern is that the "mainstream" media will ignore someone like Nairn,
someone who actually saw things happening and can offer explanation and
analysis for the events, even a white guy. No, what we'll hear are modified
press releases from the State Department and see footage borrowed from
Australian TV at least until it's safe enough (Western military presence)
for western media to go back and we'll hear anguished statements from US
officials about the "tragedy," and how, like last time, we must stop it
next time and so on.

Fuck that.

I have no voice with the Indonesian government. I have one here. I know
that my government did everything BUT handle the machetes in East Timor. My
efforts need to take place here, however small or insignificant they seem.
No time to "educate" or argue Neff.

I've just moved to the DC/Richmond area and was wondering if anyone would
be so kind as to clue me in on bookstores, reading groups, events,
organizations, etc. in the area.  Any backchanneled information and/or
introductions would be greatly appreciated.

Ah, David, I have no idea what's become of Judith Barry -- the only mention
I see at all on Hotbot to same is to a woman who married in 1719 and gave
birth to the Earl of Farnham, thus unlikely to be the same person I
performed with on 20 June '79. Which my own rotting braincells suggest was
in 1978 anyway.

The Farm was a performance space just off of the Mission District in San
Francisco. It lasted for about a decade. In '79, Jill Scott, an Australian
painter/performance artist and I put together a series that combined one
poet and one performance artist. This ran for about 6 weeks. Jill had been
quite curious at how closely different poets (such as thee and me, David)
seemed to influence one another, how everybody turned up for one's readings,
while performance artists had little or nothing to say to one another (Tom
Marioni's Museum of Conceptual Art, upstairs from the famed Jerry & Johnny's
bar, had closed maybe the year before, to give way to what has subsequently
become the Marriott Jukebox, the old third street seamen's hotels having
made way for the Moscone Center, the Yerba Buena Arts Center, the SF MOMA
etc). I read downstairs -- a straightforward reading (I recall Robert Duncan
in the first row, cackling at some of the groaners that seem to besot my
work) except  that there were geese present, honking and honking like so
many saxophones.

Go to john king books, it is within walking distance of Tiger Stadium.
On Lafayette, I believe, but right of the lodge fwy (10). A four story
glory  bookstore, it also has a branch in ferndale (home of suburbanites
watten and  harryman). If you get to kings books, give yourself time to go
upstairs. I  have found many rare gems there, including most recently a
copy of PRISON  ETIQETTE: A Compendium of Useful Information, written by
the inmates,  published in 1950 by Retort Press and edited by Holley
Cantine and Dachine  Rainer. I mention this because it is a rare book,
often costing as much as  150 or 200 dollars. I found it at King's books
for 20.

On Tiger Stadium,
I lament not being able to say goodbye to the only religious institution I
have ever prayed in.

I'd agree with Brian Stefans as to the utility of reviews on the list, so
I'll post below a modest encomium I posted yesterday to the British-Poets
discussion list--makes more sense here anyway, since the CD in question
doeesn't contain any British poetry.... -- all best --N

---

....I should also mention a CD that popped through the mail recently,
_Carnivocal: A celebration of sound poetry_ (Red Deer Press).  It's a
collection of Canadian sound poetry, both familiar and unfamiliar names:
bpNichol, Christian Bok, Steven Ross Smith, Verbomotorhead, First Draft,
bill bissett, Stephen Cain, W. Mark Sutherland, (3 of the 4) Horsemen and
Owen Sound, Re:Sounding, Penn Kemp, Gerry Shikatani, Paul Dutton, Richard
Truhlar & Steve McCaffery.  The quality's generally high, the approaches
quite various, ranging from "classic" sound-poetry (e.g. the dissection of
a word into its component letters and syllables), to an almost pop-oriented
sound reminiscent of Bobby McFerrin or the local kids imitating dance music
with their mouths, to electronic treatments of sampled voices.  Good to
have an on-form Christian Bok represented generously--one of the real
virtuosos of this form--, as ditto the hilarious collaboration between the
Horsemen (Nichol, McCaffery, Dutton) and Owen Sound (Dean, SR Smith,
Penhalf, Truhlar).  The one disappointment on the collection is that the
superb concluding track (McCaffery doing a part of _Carnival, Panel 2_) is
in sub-bootleg-quality sound (bad enough to faze even fans of Eugene
Chadbourne or Lennie Tristano...).  The rest of the collection is in very
good sound, so this comes as something of a shock! -- Anyway, the
compilation as a whole is certainly recommended. -- In Canada the CD's
distributed through Raincoast Books, 8680 Cambie Street, Vancouver, BC,
Canada, V6P 6M9  (ph: (800) 663-5714).  Not sure if that goes for the UK &
US too: perhaps try contacting the editor, Douglas Barbour, at

Ms. Houlihan,

That you maintain your insistence on the lack of a "connection" or
"motivation" beyond the casually commercial, despite voluminous postings and
references to sources substantiating claims to the contrary, is, frankly,
fine with me. I have no wish to use this space to convince those who have
decided not to be convinced. My purpose in responding to this thread was to
offer a counter to what I saw as misinformation being offered by Mr. Neff. I
and others have done that, and it seems that to continue this exchange
beyond the present point would be simply to run in circles at great waste of
bandwidth. To follow out the implications of Elizabeth Treadwell's message:
the information is available for those who want it, and at this point in the
life of this thread, no one on the list is learning anything new.

Also, I take your appeal to scarcity of time very seriously - I write in
spare moments at work, and I have better things to do with that time. Yell
at people in William Cohen's office, for one. Post to Poetics about things
like the McCaffery and Rasula anthology, for another, in greater depth and
with greater care than the past few days have allowed me. Or review two
readings (Saidenberg/Singleton, Lu/Harryman) of last weekend, both of which
deserve a fairly close account. Eat lunch. Step outside and watch the
unseasonable electrical storms... The list is a decent resource for
political information, far less so for the nuances of political argument,
and with that I'll shut up for a while.

Well, Ron, the poster for the series is on my wall...yes, 197_9_ could be a
printer's error, but the date of my own reading, Aug 30, proves it could
not have been 197_8_, because into my own script I incorporated the theft
of my car (a '65 Dodge called Mr Blue) which occurred shortly _after_ Aug
30/78. (A kind of "Welcome to SF" theft; we had moved into the city only a
month before). (Oddly, the week we moved back to Sonoma County, in Nov/79,
SFPD notified me Mr Blue had turned up in Hunters Point, no longer
driveable but still in its trunk were several slim vols of our colleagues,
dampened but not obliterated.) (By then, I had been driving for more than a
year Mr Normal, so-named because of the letters NML on its plate, but also
because it was a 75 Chevy Nova.)

The roster of poets reading also establishes that I am not a Language Poet,
since my name is the only one that does not end in 'n'. Harryman, Hejinian,
Watten, Robinson and your good self(on _Sep_ 20, not June) out-alphabet me.
My performance (I suppose I thought we were supposed to perform, rather
than give a 'straightforward reading') consisted of a straightforward
beginning increasingly interrupted by my own tape-recorded voice listing a
string of urban plaints.(So, similar to your rdg, in that it was
interrupted by honkings). All I recall of its reception is that Victoria
Rathbu N (obviously an embryo LangPo person) was reduced to tears.

I wish there had been a booklet of reviews of these events put together, a
la Langton St 'scribings,'and I would urge current curators to attempt
this, for what others did escapes me now, and I was counting on yr
prodigious memory. Lyn performed with her brother, I know. All events were
well-attended; it was the forming (not _farming_, despite it was at 'The
Farm', and notwithstanding Judith Barry's geese) community at perhaps its
peak of mutual interest.

By way of P.S., the N-ending as requirement for echte LangPoets--a sort of
shibboleth in type--has been commented on before in these 'pages'. The
apparent anomaly of Bruce Andrews is obviously due to a forbear leaving off
the 'son' suffix of BA's Scandinavian ancestors. Thus we learn that neither
Jack Spicer, nor Kathleen Fraser, nor Bob Grenier, nor Clark Coolidge, nor
Michael Palmer, nor Tom Mandel, nor Erica Hunt, nor David Bromige, could be
anything but urLP; their fate was sealed by The Alphabet. Ted Berrigan,
however, might be the second LangPoet, if George Oppen is the first. (Not
Robt Duncan; his name should have stayed Robt Symmes). And hadn't you
always suspected that Rae Armantrout's LangPo status derived from her
friendships rather than her (stunning, lyrical, 'objectivist') poems?

Somebody mentioned this the other day. I reckon there aren't that many of us
here that read the Wall Street Urinal. Maybe this is one result of  the
Bollingen, or his election to the Academy of American Poets, or perhaps a
sign that the long over due Pulizer, National Book Award or (and why not)
Nobel are not impossible. Nonetheless, praise from strange quarters.

LEISURE & ARTS: Words Worth a Thousand Pictures ---
Juxtaposing Poetry and Painting, Robert Creeley's Collaborations
Give Art New Meaning Anne Midgette

Wall Street Journal, September 22, 1999 New York

Put words together with music, and it's often the music you hear first. Put
words together with a picture, and people will often read them as a caption.
"The poetry does get eaten up by the image," says artist Archie Rand.

Poet Robert Creeley wouldn't agree. In 1998, he collaborated with Mr. Rand
on "Drawn and Quartered," a collection of 54 prints by Mr. Rand, each
embellished with a quatrain by Mr. Creeley. And the show "In Company: Robert
Creeley's Collaborations," now at the New York Public Library, displays this
and 46 other collaborations Mr. Creeley has done with visual artists over
the past 46 years. In books, portfolios and broadsheets created with the
likes of Francesco Clemente and Jim Dine, R.B. Kitaj and Sol LeWitt, words
and images maintain an uneasy tension: The pictures are not illustrations of
the texts, the texts not captions to the pictures.

Juxtaposing poetry and painting "keeps shifting the emotional center," says
Mr. Creeley, "particularly working with someone like Clemente, with such
affective particularizing imagery. Any person reading what I've written and
seeing what he's made is moving back and forth between two emotional
fields."

The show, which originated at the Castellani Art Museum of Niagara
University (N.Y.), is handsome testimony to Mr. Creeley's creative life. Now
73, Mr. Creeley, who once wanted to be a novelist but ultimately
concentrated on the "domestic" realm of poetry, has followed an academic
career, holding a professorship at SUNY Buffalo and teaching at other
universities around the world, while garnering awards and grants from a
Guggenheim through a tenure as New York State Poet (1989-91) to this year's
prestigious Bollingen Prize. By age, he belongs to the periphery of the Beat
generation; by allegiance, to Black Mountain College, where he taught and
received his B.A. in the '50s after dropping out of Harvard a decade before,
in the spring of his senior year.

At Black Mountain, the verbal and visual arts met as a matter of course.
"There was a small job press in the print studio," recalls poet Jonathan
Williams, who like Mr. Creeley attended Black Mountain and was enormously
influenced there by the poet Charles Olson. "(Poet) Joel Oppenheimer was a
student, and he knew something about printing; and (Robert) Rauschenberg
made a drawing for a poem of Joel's. It was the first time anything of
Rauschenberg's had ever been published." That broadside launched Mr.
Williams's Jargon press, which has since produced more than 100 books of
poetry, photography, drawings and whatever else takes the publisher's fancy.
Mr. Creeley's 1953 collaboration with French artist Rene Laubies, "The
Immoral Proposition," in which Mr. Laubies's Franz Kline-like gestural
drawings threaten to ensnare the printed poems in their tangles, was
Jargon's eighth publication, and is the first Creeley collaboration in this
show.

Spare yet lush, tough yet yielding, Mr. Creeley's poetry is ideally suited
for such collaboration, portraying states of being or facets of reality
without, usually, creating images itself. In a catalog essay, poet John Yau
points out that Mr. Creeley shares with the Abstract Expressionists a
concern with his physical media -- with doing things that are only possible
in words -- and with the process of making art, playing with the sense of
time and narrative flow in subjective, elliptical juxtapositions of words
and sentences. Mr. Creeley was attracted to the work of an Abstract
Expressionist like Jackson Pollock because, as he explained to the show's
curator, Elizabeth Licata, "It's a way of stating what one feels without
describing it." Mr. Creeley aims for this kind of statement in his own
poetry. Collaborating with visual artists is a way for him to expand the
terms of his poetry beyond the horizons of the self.

The nature of collaboration varies. In some cases, such as "The Immoral
Proposition," poems and images simply coexist side by side. In others, Mr.
Creeley sent completed poems to the artist, or wrote poems based on existing
images, such as "Life & Death" with Francesco Clemente in 1993. "It's not a
question of understanding the paintings," he says, "but of picking up their
vibes -- more like playing in a band."

Among the most successful collaborations in the show are the "Numbers,"
which Mr. Creeley did with pop artist Robert Indiana in 1968. Mr. Indiana
made large, slick silkscreens of the numerals one through nine, and Mr.
Creeley furnished poems dealing with aspects of each number. Because Mr.
Indiana's posterlike style evokes printing-press production, there's a
seamless fit between the artist's images and the printed word. In sober
black type on a sheet of otherwise empty paper, each poem contrasts with the
loud exclamation of the numeral opposite it, and preserves a kind of
theoretical balance between letters and numbers into the bargain.

As the poet became better known, he was invited to do projects with artists
he didn't actually know, coordinated by third-party dealers or publishers.
While some of these projects are beautiful, the distance between the
collaborators is reflected in a kind of coolness in "7&6," with Robert
Therrien (1988), or "Visual Poetics," with Donald Sultan (1998). In these,
Mr. Creeley's poetry is more literal. Where he avoids simply describing the
artists' images in collaborations with Mr. Clemente or Marisol, he is
specific about the associations evoked by Mr. Therrien's small, one-color
geometric shapes, and his poems reflect the painter's finicky precision. He
is similarly descriptive of Mr. Sultan's quasi-photographic outline images
of fruit and flowers ("Looks like a pear? Is yellow?"), writing, as in many
of his other poems, in stanzas that fall in and out of rhyme.

"There are artists whose work doesn't really let anyone else in," says Mr.
Creeley, speaking particularly of John Chamberlain, an old friend from Black
Mountain, who sent him the lithographs for "Famous Last Words" in 1988. "I
don't know what the poems have to do with the images" in that collaboration,
Mr. Creeley laughs. In other cases, there's a real dialogue between the two
art forms. "Sometimes, when my work has a unique form," Mr. Clemente has
said, "it calls for his (Mr. Creeley's) ability to read it." And Mr. Creeley
describes Susan Rothenberg's reaction to a poem he wrote for a catalog of
her upcoming retrospective in Boston (the two collaborated on "Parts" in
1993). "I was working from images the museum provided," he says. After Ms.
Rothenberg read the poem, "the phone rings; and she said, `How did you know?
I don't really know you that well; how did you know this?' I said, `I look
at your paintings, friend.'"

Displaying these books and folios in a show, whether on the walls of a
museum in Buffalo or pinned like butterflies in the library's display cases
in New York, means seeing poetry, at least in part, as a kind of visual art.
Placed next to a painting or print, the words are pinned into the realm of
the seen, becoming something that must be looked at as well as read. Indeed,
reading Mr. Creeley's poems as if they were paintings brings into sharp
focus the counterpoint between horizontal and vertical, between the meaning
of individual lines and of the sentences they form when taken together as a
whole. But looking, in a museum context, is not a wholly satisfying way to
take in poetry. Marvelously, the show's catalog comes with an excellent
CD-ROM that reproduces several pages of each collaboration, word and image,
which allows the viewer the option of reading the poems in intimacy, and
creates the implied irony that new technology is able to give words, again,
the upper hand.

PENDA, tell me! Where on earth is Mercia? I haven't a clue!

Do you know that Wight held out against CAEDWALLA, relying on Mercia,
"fiducia Merciorum"? What a mess again! Caedwalla appears when you least
expect him! Just when "per factionem principum a West Saxonia expulsus!"
And who knows where West Saxony is! If it's old, and I bet it is, is it
Old West Saxony? How do these people ever get home?

For a while, the future of A.BACUS, the newsletter publication
of Potes & Poets Press with 124 issues under its belt, was in
doubt.  The current editor, Peter Ganick, was lucky enough, how-
ever to find Dan Featherston to be the editor starting with issues
in year 2001. The newsletter was started in 1984.

Dan is looking at manuscripts for inclusion.  Manuscripts with
sufficient return postage should be sent to:
Dan Featherston, A.BACUS, P O Box 40664, Tuscon AZ 85717.

A.BACUS2000 is already planned and will feature, among
others, Joan Retallack, Charles Alexander, Michael Basinski,
Rachel Blau DuPlessis, Stacy Doris, and Christina Monti.
Individual issues can be pre-ordered from Potes & Poets
Press, 181 Edgemont Avenue, Elmwood CT 06110-1005
for $5 each postpaid, or $30 for the full year of 8 issues,
sent first class in an envelope.

AH Bramhall posts very thoughtful remarks about the series from
Kevin Magee which appeared on the List a month or so ago. Nice
to have a second to the bravo I threw out back then. But I know we
two can't be the only ones who were/are deeply impressed. Do go
back to see these pieces in the archives if you haven't. They're
extraordinary-- politics and poesis interlocked and grappling and
getting rough on each other and climaxing together. You can't help
but watch.

In response to a post I called "The sound of drums," Michael Neff
has written to tell me of his surprise at my "quick about face." I
believe my implied other face must be pinned to a post I put up a
few days ago, one that contained a reference to David Hume and
ended with a statement about my complete agreement with
Michael's position on East Timor. Since the intended tone of that
first rebuttal did not register with him, I am thinking that others on
the List may have taken it wrongly too. So, for what it's worth (and
to keep my left-wing credentials before the List intact) I wanted to
say-- That post about my agreeing with Michael Neff WAS
SUPPOSED TO BE IRONIC.

Yes, I hate US imperialism, am one of those old fogeys who
believes its existence is as real as rocks, and I wanted to make
that conviction crystal clear, since irony, apparently, is failing me,
along with other things in my body these days. And I wish Web del
Sol and its editors the best of luck as they continue to spread the
gospel of neo-liberal innocence and beneficence far and wide. May
the sun never set on the empire of American poetry.

Vispo Audio:
http://www.vispo.com/audio

New at Vispo Audio are four half-hour radio shows I produced on Stephen
Reid, novelist and bank robber. Stephen's the author of Jack-Rabbit
Parole (Seal Books, Canada). I produced these radio shows in 1988 when
Stephen had been out of jail for about a year; he and Susan Musgrave
(Victoria BC poet and novelist) had married, they were raising a daughter
(now they have two), and things were going very well for Stephen. His
writing was going well, he had a contract from McLelland and Stewart for
his next novels, and there were plans for a movie of his book.

Not so well these days: he pulled another robbery (August 99) and is back
in prison awaiting trial.

Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; format=flowed

Two unrelated queries:
1. As I was reading the material promoting the new 'Objectivist Nexus' book,
it got me thinking whether any critical writing has been done drawing
connections between Oppen and Heidegger. Maybe this is a really obvious
point (Oppen opens one of his collections with a quote by Heidegger), but
I'd be curious to read anything written on the matter.

2. I've become very interested in chance-generated and procedural poetry and
have been reading lots of Cage and MacLow. Also, I recently got Joan
Retallack's book 'Afterrimages.' I could use some suggestions regarding
other poets which might be of interest, and any critical work centered on
aleatorical methods-especially related to Retallack and other more
contemporary writers. Cage tends to be really explicit about his methods,
MacLow relatively so, but I haven't found much on other writers. Again, I
hope this isn't redundant as I'm a new subscriber. THANK YOU.

Roy Kiyooka Conference
        October 1 - 2, 1999
  Location:
        Theatre (Room 328), South Building, Emily Carr
Institute of Art and Design, 1399 Johnston Street,
        Granville Island, Vancouver, B.C. V6H 3R9


        Roy Kiyooka (1926-1994) was a “multi-disciplinary”
artist who at various periods of his life was a
        painter, sculptor, teacher, poet, musician,
film-maker, and photographer (or combination of any of
        the above). When Kiyooka arrived in Vancouver in
1959 he was already one of Canada’s most
        respected abstract painters. His modernist stance at
the time inspired a generation of Vancouver
        painters to reach beyond regionalism. In the sixties
and seventies Kiyooka began to write and
        publish poetry and produce photographic works. The
best known of these, StoneDGloves
        (1969-1970), is both a poetic and photographic
project. As Kiyooka eventually rejected the
        modernist (Greenbergian) aesthetic that informed his
paintings he increasingly took up
        performance, photography, film, and music. He saw
the position of the artist in opposition to the
        institutions of art. The shape of Kiyooka’s work is
only now being revealed, especially his
        photographic work. The conference is planned to take
the measure of that shape.

        Panel Discussions
        Sat. Oct. 2, 1999 10am - 5:15 pm
        Room 308 (Theatre) Emily Carr Institute of Art &
Design


        In acknowledgement of Kiyooka's visual arts and
literary works, academics, writers, and artists will
        participate in panel discussions on the following
issues:

        10am - 12pm Panel 1: The Politics of Cultural
Identity

        Moderator: John O’Brian

        Bio: John O'Brian teaches modern art history, theory
and criticism —with a Canadian bias— at the
        University of British Columbia. He has published 11
books, most recently Ruthless Hedonism: The
        American Reception of Matisse (University of Chicago
Press, 1999). He wrote first about the work
        of Roy Kiyooka in the catalogue for The Flat Side of
the Landscape, an exhibition he curated for the
        Mendel Art Gallery in 1989. In 1993 he organized Roy
Kiyooka: The Hoarfrost Paintings for the UBC
        Fine Arts Gallery, and in 1998 he wrote "Politics
and Other Mendacities" for Front Magazine.


        Panelist: Roy Miki,

        Title: Unravelling Roy Kiyooka: A Re-assessment
Amidst Shifting Boundaries

        Abstract: This paper will address the constituting
role of critical frameworks for situating the work of
        Roy Kiyooka. Speculative in its projections-and
necessarily so in the current unravelling of identity
        formations dependent on the Canadian "nation" as a
boundary-it will explore the potential for a shift
        in the cultural value of Kiyooka's poetics from a
marginal to an emergent perspective that opens
        what he calls "pacific windows."

        Bio: Roy Miki is a writer, poet, teacher, and
editor, whose publications include Justice in Our Time:
        The Japanese Canadian Redress Settlement
(Co-authored with Cassandra Kobayashi) and
        Random Access File (Red Deer College Press). He
edited Pacific Windows: Collected Poems of
        Roy K. Kiyooka (Talonbooks), which received the 1997
poetry award from the Association for Asian
        American Studies, and is currently writing a book on
his participation in the Japanese Canadian
        redress movement of the 1980s. A collection of
essays, Broken Entries: Race Subjectivity Writing,
        has recently been published by Mercury Press.


        Panelists: Susanna Egan and Gabriele Helms

        Title: The Many Tongues of "Mothertalk":
Cross-cultural Collaboration and the Japanese Canadian
        Experience

        Abstract: We propose to talk about the nature and
effects of collaboration in Roy Kiyooka's
        Mothertalk. In particular, we will examine the
investment of Roy Kiyooka in his mother's story, his
        involvement of Matsuki Masutani, the necessary
intervention of family on Roy's death, and their
        invitation to Daphne Marlatt to complete the work.
Her introduction and NeWest's production
        strategies determine reception of this text to a
significant degree, both declaring the multiple
        collaborations and tidying up the complex procedure.

        Bio: Susanna Egan teaches in the English Department
at the University of British Columbia. Her
        work in autobiography studies includes Patterns of
Experience in Autobiography (1984), Mirror
        Talk: Genres of Crisis in Contemporary Autobiography
(1999), and numerous articles.

        Bio: Gabriele Helms is a post doctorol fellow in the
English Department at the University of British
        Columbia. In her current research she explores the
connections between generic instability of
        contemporary Canadian life-writing and
reconceptualizations of experience. She has published on
        auto/biography and contemporary Canadian literature.
Her latest collaborative papers have
        appeared in Painting the Maple: Race, Gender, and
the Construction of Canada.


        Panelist: Henry Tsang

        Title: Art Calling Fool Scold: Learning to See and
Roy Kiyooka

        Abstract: "Art is more like a quest than it is a
vocation." My presentation will focus on Roy Kiyooka
        as teacher, mentor, soothsayer. Excerpts from
"Hieronymus Bosch's Heretical April Fool
        Diverti-mementos & Other Protestations" will be
examined as well as photographic works that
        reflect his relationship with art, the art game,
being an artist, being Japanese, and cultural
        identification.

        Bio: Henry Tsang is a visual artist and independent
curator based in Vancouver. His artwork has
        been exhibited across Canada and abroad, and is
concerned with cultural identity and intercultural
        communication, exploring the interaction between
different cultures resulting from contact,
        influence, negotiation, and contestation. Tsang's
curatorial projects include Self Not Whole:
        Cultural Identity and Chinese-Canadian Artists in
Vancouver, at the Chinese Cultural Centre in
        Vancouver in 1991; Racy Sexy, an intercultural
multidisciplinary project presenting 33 artists in 9
        community and cultural centres around Greater
Vancouver in 1993; and City at the End of Time:
        Hong Kong 1997, a series of art exhibitions, poetry
readings and public lectures, in 1997.


        12-1:30 pm Lunch


        1:30-4:15 pm Panel 2: Photography and Poetics

        Moderator: Smaro Kamboureli, University of Victoria

        Bio: Smaro Kamboureli teaches Canadian literature at
the University of Victoria. Her recent
        publications include her anthology, Making a
Difference: Canadian Multicultural Literature and her
        critical study, Scandalous Bodies: Diasporic
Literature in English Canada. She is also the editor of
        the NeWest Press "Writer as Critic" series.


        Panelist: Lora Senechal Carney

        Title: Through gold windows of the sun: Kiyooka and
Japanese artist-photographers

        Abstract: In his 1994 Nobel Prize lecture, Kenzaburo
Oe said that contemporary Japan is split
        between "two opposite poles of ambiguity." That
split is "imprinted like a deep scar" on him and his
        writing. In fact, much recent art from Japan is
imprinted with this divide between its
        supermodern/Western aspect and its traditional Asian
culture. The poles in Roy Kiyooka's work
        may be differently placed and may have shifted
during his lifetime, but because of them he has
        some things in common with recent Japanese
artist-photographers, especially those of his
        generation. This is a brief investigation of those
things.

        Bio: Lora Senechal Carney is an art historian who
teaches in the Visual and Performing Arts at the
        University of Toronto at Scarborough. She writes
about modern and contemporary Canadian and
        U.S. artists.


        Panelist: Martha Hanna

        Title: Four Photographic Works: the eye in the
landscape, Van Gogh and the Bird of Paradise, 13
        Cameras/Vancouver, and Pacific Windows

        Abstract: The four works made between 1970 and 1990
will be considered for what they reveal
        about Roy Kiyooka's use of photography, his
collaborative impulse, and his personal vision.

        Bio: Martha Hanna is the author of many exhibitions
and publications on contemporary Canadian
        photography, among them: Words and Images (1980);
Evergon (1971-1987); Banff Souvenir
        (1992); Suzy Lake: Point of Reference (1993); and
Eldon Garnet: The Fallen Body (1998). She has
        been Director of the Canadian Museum of Contemporary
Photography, an affiliate of the National
        Gallery of Canada, since 1994.


        Panelist: Sheryl Conkelton

        Title: "… The sad and glad tidings of the floating
world…"

        Abstract: Roy Kiyooka's abrupt turning away from
painting toward poetry and photography was
        marked, to use John O'Brian's works, by "the urgency
of testimony and witnessing." Kiyooka's
        works resonate as narrative pieces of ordinary life
but retain a modernist's sense of rupture and
        construction as well as a sense of revisionist
mission. This brief consideration of the serial
        photographic essays will focus on Kiyooka's
construction of these biographical and diaristic works
        and his conception and use of different types of
artistic order.

        Bio: Sheryl Conkelton is the Senior Curator at the
Henry Art Gallery, University of Washington,
        Seattle, and has been as associate curator at the
Museum of Modern Art, New York and the Los
        Angeles County Museum of Art. Among her publications
are monographs on Annette Messager,
        Catherine Wagner, Aaron Siskind and Frederick
Sommer, as well as an upcoming volume on Uta
        Barth.


        Panelist: Scott Toguri McFarlane

        Title: Un-ravelling the Secret Glove of the Archive

        Abstract: Kiyooka’s StoneDGloves is comprised of
poetry and photographs of gloves cast away by
        workmen who were building the Canadian Pavilion at
Expo ’70 in Osaka. I discuss the work’s
        “un-ravelling” of these archival projects: Expo,
whose pavilions represent the archaic belonging
        necessary to nationalism but dubious for a Japanese
Canadian representing Canada in Japan;
        Kiyooka’s personal history, a genealogical project
very familiar with the labour buried within the
        discourse of both the Japanese and Canadian nation;
and that strange photographic collection of
        gloves whose hollow forms point to a labour not
there. Amidst the dirt and detritus of Expo’s
        foundation, StoneDGloves tumble and cup a stage of
the world and the words of the poems.

        Bio: Scott Toguri McFarlane is a writer and editor
living in Montreal. He is the co-founder of the
        Pomelo Project, a production house for the arts
which organized City at the End of Time: Hong
        Kong 1997, a series of art exhibitions, poetry
readings, public talks and publications engaging with
        Hong Kong culture. He was one of the organizers for
“Writing thru ‘Race,’” a national conference for
        First Nations writers and writers of colour. He is
completing his PhD in the English Department at
        Simon Fraser University.


        Video Premiere: Michael de Courcy

        Title: Voice / Roy Kiyooka, 1999. (40 min.)

        Bio: Michael de Courcy is a photographer and artist.
He has exhibited throughout Canada and the
        U.S. and has been active in the Vancouver art

Subject:      Rain Taxi's review for Gainsbourg's Evguenie Sokolov
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="iso-8859-1"
Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable

Evgu=E9nie Sokolov by Serge Gainsbourg
ISBN: 0-9662346-1-8     $17

Literally artsy-fartsy, Evgu=E9nie Sokolov is a satirical, allegorical,
rise-and-fall story about a dyspeptic, marginal young man who becomes a
famous painter via his lusty flatulence.  This pseudo-autobiography is at
once an ode to anality and a sly rendering of happenstance in the creative
process.  It's also a play on Serge Gainsbourg's life history: in the '60's
and '70's, he deliberately flouted Europe's conventions and - despite or
because of his overindulgent rebel pose - farted his way to the top of the
charts as one of France's most controversial and admired pop stars.  As the
introduction conveys, he performed his own songs in a raspy, strung-out
voice and in duets with the likes of Brigitte Bardot. In the most infamous
of these, the 1967 "je t'aime - moi non plus (I Love You - Me Neither)," he
croons "je vais et je viens entre tes reins" ("I go and I come between your
kidneys").

Gainsbourg's mock/real lyricism resonates throughout the novel.  In
passages reminiscent of Proust's Madeleine riffs, Sokolov rhapsodizes on
his inspired, foul emanations: "I would escape on my own to Nordic sand
dunes and (stand) there, shivering in the twilight gusts ... the wind would
carry off my exhalations and disperse the diabolical... wisps in
fascinating, enchanted swirls."  For Sokolov, the fart serves as both
revenge and display, the source of the narrator;s humiliation as well as
his brilliance.  "I would get my own back at the swimming bath by going
close to [my teachers] and releasing iridescent bubbles, which rose
gurgling to the surface and burst into the clean air as subversive farts."

This tale is clever and moving. The narrator contradicts himself without
apology, at times veering from first into third-person point of view,
referring to himself by name as though he were in the position of his
buyers of critics.  Gainsbourg's snipes at art world notoriety produce a
Seinfeldian, box-within-a-box counter-reality.  His novel is intellectually
provocative, but also deeply and sensually - aromatically - felt.

Hello List

Moe's Books (my employer) is hosting two events next month:

A book party for Now It's Jazz: Writings on Kerouac & The Sounds by
Clark Coolidge (Living Batch Press). Sunday, October 10th.

A doubleheader book party for two books from Skanky Possum Press:
Dark, by Hoa Nguyen and Lucky Pup, by Leslie Davis. Sunday, October
17th.

Both events are from 3-5pm. Moe's Books, 2476 Telegraph Ave. Berkeley
(510) 849-2087.

Note: Clark lost his address book, so his mailing list is rather
small. I'm sure that there are interested people that won't be getting
invitations. Please pass the word!

Thanks  Owen

What is to Be Done?


Report: I'm alive and well in Traveller's Linux; I have left Vienna.
Report: I'm in on Vienna Traveller's Linux. I am told I am paranoid.
Communique: My name is Vladimir Lenin. I am in Edit, Austria.
Communique: Hello out there. I am cut off.
Communique: The best Jews, those who are celebrated in world history,
and have given the world foremost leaders of democracy and socialism,
have never clamoured against assimilation.
Report: I'm alive and well; there are no Jews in Traveller's Linux.
Report: The conclusion which follows from this is absolute intcontro-
vertible: it has been proved that, far from causing harm to the revo-
lutionary proletariat, participation in a bourgeois-democratic parli-
ament, even a few weeks before the victory of a Soviet republic and
even _after_ such a victory, actually helps that proletariat to
_prove_ to the backward masses why such parliaments deserve to be
Communique: I am not paranoid; I have been told I am not paranoid.
Communique: I am at Row: 00017 and Column: 00048.
Report: This is coming to you from Traveller's Linux.
Communique to A. V. Lunacharsky: Aren't you ashsmed to vote for pub-
lication of Mayakovasky's _150 Millions_ in five thousand copies?
Rubbish, stupidity, double-dyed stupidity and pretentiousness. In my
opinion we should print only one out of ten such things, and _not
more than fifteen hundred copies,_ for libraries and odd people. And
flog Lunarcharsky for futurism.
Report: Hello? Radio Traveller's Linux here. I AM NOT PARANOID!
Communique: What column is this? Column 00045.
Communique: I am seventy-eight years old.
Communique: Youth's altered attitude to questions of sex is of
course 'fundamental' and based on theory. Many people call it revo-
lutionary' and 'communist.' They sincerely believe that this is so.
I am an old man and I do not like it. I may be a morose ascetic, but
quite often this so-called 'new sex life' of young people -- and fre-
quently of the adults too -- seems to me purely bourgeois and simply
an extension of the good old bourgeois brothel. All this has nothing
in common with free love as we Communists understand it.
Report: I am certainly not in favor of this or that!
Report: I do not smoke a bourgeois so-called cigarette!
Communique: The whole of society will have become a single office
and a single factory, with equality of labor and pay.
Communique: The second condition is agreement between the proletari-
at, which is exercising its dictatorship, that is, holds state power,
and the majority of the peasant population.
Report: I do not agree with those of the dictatorship who accuse me
of paranoia, although I have been committed of paranoia by the so-
called 'state authorities.' I do not smoke a cigarette, a victim of
the bourgeois mind!
Communique: I am in Traveller's Linux! I am in the root directory!
No one else is here beside me! No one else is toppling this machine
constructed of the finest materials! I am using this machine! This
will have been Column 15! This will have been Row 50! I am in Aus-
tria, but I am not in Vienna! I have never been in Vienna! This is a
hope of bourgeois freedom!
Report: The government of the proletarian dictatorship -- jointly
with the Communist Party and the trade unions of course -- makes ev-
ery effort to overcome the backward views of men and women and thus
uproot the old, non-commmunist psychology. It goes without saying
that men and women are absolutely equal before the law.
Communique: My name is Vladimir Lenin. You had the rudness to call
my wife on the telephone and berate her.
Report: It sounds just as though he were chewing rags in his sleep!
Report: One cannot hide the fact that dictatorship presupposes and
implies a "condition," one so disagreeable to renegades, of _revolu-
tionary violence_ of one class against another.
Report: We must see to it that every factory and every electric pow-
er station becomes a centre of enlightenment; if Russia is covered
with a dense network of electric power stations and powerful techni-
cal installations, our communist economic development will become a
model for a future socialist Europe and Asia.
Communique: I am on previous Row 69 of this Report and Communique.
Communique: I am not paranoid -- only to approach the government of
the revolutionary proletarian dictatorship, is it not within the
purview of any sane man to wonder at the absence of individuals
within this dense network, given the absence, in other words, of any
other within Traveller's Linux? This is the Communique of Vladimir
Lenin, having been declared paranoid by the state. Toe.
Report: This ends the Communique of Vladimir Lenin, having been de-
clared paranoid by the state. Toe.
Communique: I have been declared paranoid by the state. I am not de-
clared paranoid by the state. Toe.

deaths in storms


i am afraid of death; it haunts me, has haunted me for years; i'm not af-
raid of taking my own life, not at all--but of death this great fear, this
fear so great i cannot write coherently about it, cannot add polish to the
style; it takes me over in the form of nightmares; i have only two decades
left to live, watching my mind deteriorate; i am hysterically fearful of
being left behind; i want to see more of the world--it's not the pain but
the absence, knowing the last gesture; this isn't an emotion but a synd-
rome as death watches me; i've been miserably unhappy all my life as a re-
sult; i'm a coward, i can't think straight; i'm violently afraid of viol-
ence, of the pain of violence; i don't know a moment's peace; it's a
struggle to breathe in the morning; i get repeated headaches; i feel unut-
terable loss constantly; my life is filled with regrets as far back as i
can remember; i'm suspicious of momentary happiness; i see nothing but the
gateway to annihilation; my writing is underpinned by decay and disappear-
ance; i rage against acquiescence; i have no belief in reincarnation or
afterlife; absence characterizes existence, stains it; i try through sexu-
al abjection to forget myself, bury myself first; i have no stake in my
death--no one does; it is a great vacuum tearing me apart; it grabs my
mind, my brain, creates fevers; it controls my words as i write them, as
if there were bones clawing and severing the fingers of my hands; dreams
carry on where daylight leaves off; daylight reconfirms the worst of the
horrors; this is my ordinary existence; there is no answer to anything but
the simplest of questions--daily, i face my own failure in this regard--
knowing that i am an imposter, waiting to be found out; i see others more
or less calm, there's no calm for me; my dreams have severed limbs, storms
and tornados, buildings toppled, buses veering off wet cliffs down to the
shore rocks below--drowning, i try to claw my way out, the water's too
great, i can't breathe, the inconsolable wetness of lungs, everything com-
ing to an end, we're upside-down; i'm a coward, i've always been a coward;
i'm afraid of the tiniest thing, storms get to me; i pretend to be brave,
that's all, it's easy in safe situations; the storm--not the storm really,
the careening bus, it's the bus that brings it to the surface as it crash-
es down, coming to pieces on the rocks, ending in deep water, above the
roof, it's all turned awry, you can't tell left from right, up from down,
i'm drowning again, it's all this repetition; i'm feverish, can hardly see
the world, whatever's churning

This is eerie, I just sent something to poetryetc about The Exquisite
Corpse, and I seem to remember reading in their pages this theory about
the seemingly obligatory "n" ending to Langpoet's names. Was that you who
wrote that for the Corpse? And would that make John Milton and Walt
Whitman precursors to L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E?

CALL FOR PAPERS
Incubation: A trAce International Conference about Writing and the Internet
10-12 July 2000
The Nottingham Trent University, Nottingham, UK
http://trace.ntu.ac.uk/incubation/


Keynote Speakers: Teri Hoskin, Geoff Ryman & Gregory Ulmer


The trAce Online Writing Community connects more than a thousand writers and readers in over 60 countries. Together we have built a vibrant and energetic online culture where text is always the focus. This conference offers the chance to meet in a physical space to talk about the nature of writing and reading on the internet today. We invite papers which debate, discuss or demonstrate any of the following:


TEXT : NARRATIVE : INVENTION
The web is home to a huge variety of narrative forms: fictions using a traditional narrative structure within the framework of hypertext; works operating across literary genres - ficto-criticisms which consider the medium directly; poetic writings that seek to dishevel
the structure of language; pidgin languages and texts; the blurring of
image/word/sound so that the very design itself becomes the writing; and the liberation from the alphabet. But what does all this mean to the traditional print author or reader? And how do both the mode of distribution and the corporate-owned formats affect content and style? This theme examines the discovery and invention of new literary forms and theories, and the re-emergence, online, of textual experimentation predating the internet. It seeks to contextualise online literary production and features some of the breakthrough online projects that are helping to shape the early history of
writing online. We invite authors, readers and critics to explore their engagement with the internet and to look at the ways in which text has evolved online.


TEXT : COMMUNITY : CREATIVITY
The internet has offered us the chance to connect with people around the world in ways we could never have imagined. What effect is this having on creativity and artistic collaboration, including the notion of lone author as individual genius? Society takes on a different complexity when the identities of its members may be multiple,
collective, or fragmented. How do we build and administer our online
communities? And what happens when so many nationalities, cultures and
languages intersect? This is a good moment to consider what it is to be human and how we are engaging with technology in ways we have never done before. The flux of the net challenges our assumptions about identity, self, nature, language, nation, time and space and disrupts the ways in which we construct meaning. How are writers responding to new experiences of online community, creativity, spirituality, and the body?


TEXT : PUBLISHING : OWNERSHIP
Publishers just don't seem to know what to do with hypertext. Contemporary notions of authorship and ownership are being
reconfigured by the advent of new technologies like the Internet. How are both mainstream and radical publishing responding to notions of copyright, public domain, and copyleftism? And where do new forms of work fit in? Is the book really dead? Will networking and collaborative authoring transform the literary into something else? Is it true that online writing communities and web.narrative projects are being embraced by media and art institutions but ignored by print publishers? There are many burning practical questions to be addressed. Are online works Read-Only consumer products? How does the
public own/appropriate an online work? How would you present a web narrative project without a computer? Which form would you use? And how do you sell your online work?


ABSTRACTS SHOULD BE 300 WORDS MAXIMUM.

DEADLINE: DECEMBER 1ST 1999

Jay,

1) Take a look at Rob Halpern's essay on Oppen's reading of Heidegger in
Tripwire #3 [I believe one or both of the editors subscribe to the list. If
not, I can track down ordering info for you].
2) Retallack's more recent "How To Do Things With Words" is also interesting
in the connection you mention. For other leads, I'd take a look at responses
to Jena Osman's query about "found text" poems, posted to this list a month
or two (?) back. Also, a quick list of chance &/or procedurally-composed
work might include Jerome Rothenberg's _Gematria_, anything branching out
from the recently-published Oulipo Compendium, various works by Tina
Darragh, some of Ron Silliman's work (thinking especially of _ketjak_,
_Tjanting_, and _Lit_), many pieces from Bernadette Mayer. _0 to 9_, if you
can find it, is well worth a look - as is her list of experiments, which is
much easier to track down - reprinted in _In the American Tree_, I believe.
There's also a later version, with additions by Charles Bernstein and
others, up at the EPC:
http://writing.upenn.edu/epc/authors/bernstein/experiments.html


Obviously, a partial list, but the best I can muster from work. If you're
still looking after others have posted, feel free to backchannel me and I'll
do a little more digging at home.

Taylor

Two unrelated queries:
1. As I was reading the material promoting the new 'Objectivist Nexus' book,
it got me thinking whether any critical writing has been done drawing
connections between Oppen and Heidegger. Maybe this is a really obvious
point (Oppen opens one of his collections with a quote by Heidegger), but
I'd be curious to read anything written on the matter.

2. I've become very interested in chance-generated and procedural poetry and
have been reading lots of Cage and MacLow. Also, I recently got Joan
Retallack's book 'Afterrimages.' I could use some suggestions regarding
other poets which might be of interest, and any critical work centered on
aleatorical methods-especially related to Retallack and other more
contemporary writers. Cage tends to be really explicit about his methods,
MacLow relatively so, but I haven't found much on other writers. Again, I
hope this isn't redundant as I'm a new subscriber. THANK YOU.

        while it is
        indispensable
        at times

        perhaps it's
        over-indulged
        on paper

        in print etc.


some of the things said here lose what force they might have simply as some
% of the readership isnt sure what theyre saying and another bunch reads
them dead wrong


i find that live, in person, irony often hits like a brick but on paper and
especially when it seems little more than a habit (as "poetry to be
worthwhile must be ironic" --- this is a line a friend of mine heard at a
reading or someplace and reported to me) and as such seems to need a little
more scrutiny ... ?   just a thought

You're posturing Kent, and thus, bereft of reason and memory, two critical
elements for clear headed thought.  You have my sympathy, old dear.

        AMERICAN FARMERS VISIT
        A RUSSIAN COLLECTIVE FARM

        oh how madly how verdantly flamboyant
        yanks came hardening with bottles of rum
        and how we all rolled to nowhere
        for hours as one ball
        fraternizing through rough conversation
        as cultural exchange
        and then flam in comes the moment
        of sparse generosity unleashed
        tangentially upon a garden of sham
        sheep as they clamber
        out of their own silhouettes
        s’as to raise another
        through a silk in the sky
        to the human mowers
        and this now a different place
        with a different people
        and to gain velocity here is not again
        problematic because
        the sheep are as against the section cars
        and the section cares are as against the cattle
        as one to three
        cool bovine quadrupeds
        and then hip zip take me out of here
        to the nearest brickhouse
        so I can hiccup
        and take me under the water
        for a few minutes
        but make sure I can fill my lungs with air
        or else you’ll drown me

        raw feeling chanceries
                        are becoming like turf of mine
        and I have them
                        stretched against the telephone wires
        often wondering & leafing
                        how mortibles are gone
        and then there is nothing
                        nothing at all but the rouge
        imperializing
                        to pound or not to pound
        and suddenly there’s like a snake
                        going down into your borscht
        and you munch it’s nothing
                        taking it from there
        then some more arrive
                        with the same surface of the chair
        and there’s a fire extinguisher that shakes
                        white permafroth all over the tiger lilies
        and again a lack of recognition is taking
                        a bite out of your operatic biscuit
        but it lends
                        a hand to the lignum of criticism
        then there is nothing but lilies
                        in cobalt Nantucket
        a harvest by the sea
                        a dacha of timorous
        drops of saltfish on sugar
                        you’re ready to forgive everything

re: the Mayor's actions against the Brooklyn Museum:
Apparently it's very EFFECTIVE and very IMPORTANT
to call City Hall and leave your opinion
on the Mayor's Action Line.
Please pass it on, it only takes a minute.
Make sure he knows you'll never vote for him with these
kinds of cultural policies!

Please FORWARD THIS!!!

Vacation Plans


I will return to Paris
and stand beside Montmartrre again,
admiring its curves as clean
as the scissors-work of tailors
and its chamise of peach sunlight put on
in joy.  I will return to drink
champagne at midnight and to take the holiness
of ch=E9vre in my mouth as I give
thanks to the goatherd and the goat for millennia
of something I can believe in, something
redolent on my fingers in the morning.
I will sit at the same table on the Bateau Mouche
with George and Dorene, my parents,
and the Galaghers singing old favorites
while the captain steers our ship up
and down the Seine past Notre Dame
as if he's trying to help us rub this moment
into our memory while the motor purrs
and someone stands to make another toast.

I was young then, and in a hurry.
I still love the jazz of coffee
in my blood, the glint of suitcase locks
and high-tech cameras, but this time when I stand
on the Quai d'Orsay almost seduced
by the smells of donkey sausage and the sounds
of a language I am in love with learning,
I want to let the river mumble, like a grandmother,
its old stories to me.  I ache
for the counsel of a snail on patience.
Let the old Jew say what he can
of the war.  But looking on the map,
I can't find Paris.  This is not
1979.  Dorene and my dad are dead.
There are snails in my backyard, a river nearby,
and cemeteries here as serene and articulate as P=E9re-Lachaise.

-(


Lauren


I've got a hole for you. I want to put it in everywhere. I dream of need-
les, do you know that? There are tracks all over me, not just my arms. You
might think I'd know better, but I like them. They scar me, show you where
I've been.

I love wearing my flaws. You can see right through me but I know it and
that's more than a lot of people know.

/* but begging. but really wanting it. but wanting nothing more than it.
but wanting it more than anything in his life. but dreaming and living the
wanting of it. but unable to sleep for the wanting of it. but unable to
drink for the wanting of it. unable to eat for it. but doing only the
wanting of it. but others. but others noting wasting away, others wasting
away. her for the wanting of it. unable to work, this writing for the
wanting, speaking for the wanting. the boring of others, boring others.
for the desire, for the wanting of it. the hunger the thirst of it. the
exhaustion of it. the drug the addiction the obsession the compulsion of
it. the drive the instinct of it. for the wanting of it. his for the
wanting. want her. */

Do I want it, do I need it? Of course I need it. Everything's so simple
and as Lauren said, if you don't know how terrific heroin can be you don't
know anything.

It's all about your knowledge, not mine.

But I don't need all that much else, you know. And that's way ahead of you
and most other people. It drives things towards a point and that point can
be a good time. No one even thinks about good times any more. You have to
take a breath to do that. I hold my breath when I shoot up. Like you can
have it.

It's not just that though. I've got better friends than you ever will.
They'll all betray me in the end. But there's a pull in the world, I seem
to be the only one that understands that. Again it's the knowledge thing -
only an addict has knowledge of any sort. Once you understand that, you
might understand everything, but you're still not smart.

I'm always thinking below the surface. I have enough money to buy the
stuff so it's never a question, say, of Lauren out on the streets looking
for it. It's right there, in the cabinet; I can get it when I need it. The
need is good, it's easy to fulfill - just like that. Teleology grinds to a
halt several times a day, with a kick.

Some people find this stuff false, a false kick. But if the receptors are
there, if it works, what's the problem? It's nature finding nature, desire
fulfilled as I said. And the knowledge is incredible. I can see the sky!

Was it Odin, now it's me, sacrificing myself to myself? It's that, what I
can do, what I can achieve, look, I can't run a mile or climb a mountain,
but I can learn from this stuff, you wouldn't believe it. And what I've
learned doesn't fit in any books.

It's strange also because we're all addicts of course, just some of you
haven't found your thing. It's like a lure or teleology that insists on
being just out of reach, carrot on a stick kind of thing, and so you rant
uselessly, run around uselessly, as if this and that make a difference.
But difference only comes from One minus Zero so to speak, and the One can
be heroin, and the Zero can be the rest of the world, everything else.

Why do they call it substance abuse? It's the enhancement of substance,
the real recognition of the power inherent in things. And the self comes
to fruition around this. I know that, I can feel it in my bones, my soul.
These substances were made for a reason. And there's the physical effect
and the mental effect, and different sorts of addictions all over the
place. But it's worth it for the physical effect. If you're set up, like I
am.

What you're looking at is a habit. I'm a habit, even to myself I'm a hab-
it. That makes me simple and likeable. People understand all my surfaces;
they can't touch anything else but that. And I can fashion them, polish
them - I can shine like a star anytime I want.

I love feeling the hunger, love wanting it. It's like computers, but I
don't have to deal with other people and their desires. Call it modernism
against your postmodernism, or the self against alterity; the drug's not
alter at all, it's heroin my lover, it's heroin my best friend. And the
wonder and knowledge of that is unbelievable.

Do you know I can sing? You've probably never heard me sing. Someday I'll
sing for you, even now. You can stand a little? You might like this.
There's a record I use for background, like karaoke. Just a second. Let me
know what you think.

Patrick  Pritchett

Dead Metaphor Press
Boulder, CO
___________________________________________________

RESIDE offers a series of extended meditations on the themes of
embodiment, loss, and inscription. Starting from Heidegger's
observation that, "Language is the house of Being," these poems
explore how we build locations in language. Concerned with both
the Saying of the human and its continual erosion, they seek to
negotiate the anxiety about form through the body of the poem itself.

RESIDE also alludes to the Hebrew letter, Beit, which in Judaism
signifies the immanence of presence. Interrogating the structure
of the elegaic, these poems ask, "How may we build enduring
habitations for spirit in the midst of our ongoing loss? How does
the poem act as both dwelling place and point of departure?"
___________________________________________________

"Patrick Pritchett's work is distinguished both by an emotional
seriousness and by a sensuous elegance of sound. He communicates
with real finesse the pressure and the nobility of the vocation of poetry."

-- Rachel Blau DuPlessis

"Rooted in the body, Pritchett's poetry extends that body until its limits
become (con)fused with the limits of meaning and with the body of
language ... it's a body propagated by fire into an entire world - a world
that is ...  the very room we live in ... charged with a flickering,
shifting
sense of the sacred uniting these disparate things into a single force.
And what a force it is - both beautiful and astonishing."

-- Cole Swensen

Many book events are scheduled for October at City Lights
Bookstore--even though the building is still under (re)construction
(there's a long-needed earthquake retrofit underway).

Of special interest--in my opinion, at any rate--are two books
that look at the Bay Area from oblique angles. Neither book
is what you would call celebratory: Gloria Frym's new book
of stories, Distance No Object (Oct. 3), and Gray Brechin's
Imperial San Francisco: Urban Power, Earthly Ruin (Oct. 20),
which looks at cities as the vortex of extractive industries.

             Loter=EDa Cards and Fortune Poems: A Book of Lives
             Linocuts by Artemio Rodr=EDguez
             Poems by Juan Felipe Herrera
             Published by City Lights Books

             Come celebrate with us the release of Loter=EDa
             Cards and Fortune Poems, the linoleum-cut prints
             of talented Mexican artist, Artemio Rodr=EDguez,
             paired with the poetry of the fine Chicano poet,
             Juan Felipe Herrera. Based on loter=EDa, a popular
             game of chance from colonial Mexico, the images
             are masterful reinterpretations of traditional
             iconography, as seen by an artist new to the
             United States.

             Loter=EDa Cards and Fortune Poems gives a
             contemporary twist to a rich folk tradition.
             Rodr=EDguez and Herrera offer a seamless union of
             word and image, and of Mexican and Chicano
             sensibilities.

             Juan Felipe Herrera will do a performative
             reading, accompanied by musicians. Slides of
             Artemio Rodr=EDguez's work will also be shone.

             Distance No Object
             By Gloria Frym
             Published by City Lights Books

             Come join author Gloria Frym to celebrate the
             publication of her second book of short stories.
             In Distance No Object, Gloria Frym turns her
             ironic, passionate gaze to post-Vietnam Berkeley
             and San Francisco. Private lives are still swept
             along by the currents of history, as in the
             sixties. But the names of the wars of have
             changed. . . . The stories of Distance No Object
             evoke the deep frustrations between generations,
             friends, neighbors, and races. Yet civility,
             quotidian justice, a common language, and new
             love are imagined. . . .

             Gloria Frym's previous books include How I
             Learned, By Ear, Back to Forth, and Impossible
             Affection.

             By Lynne Tillman
             Published by Harcourt Brace

             From 1977 to 1997 Books & Co. was one of the
             premier independent bookstores in the country.
             Stocking a wide range of fiction and nonfiction,
             the Madison Ave. bookstore was the kind of
             bookstore writers and readers dream about: a
             place where reading was an adventure, where
             interesting works would always be available,
             where writers would congregate to share ideas and
             discuss their writing. In Bookstore, Lynne
             Tillman tells the story of this legendary
             bookstore and its founder, Jeannette Watson,
             through the voices of employees, customers,
             writers, fellow booksellers, and people
             throughout the world of publishing.

             Jeannette Watson will speak about Bookstore and
             her remarkable career.

             William L. Fox is literature consultant for the
             Western States Arts Federation, a poet and
             writer, an arts consultant, and a curator. He has
             published poems and articles in sixty magazines
             and he has had thirteen collections of poetry
             published in three countries. He is the author of
             several exhibition catalogues and the editor of
             two anthologies.

             Mapping the Empty relates the unique work of
             eight Nevada artists to the geography of their
             state. Driving by Memory is a meditation on
             driving in the desert. It is a profoundly
             personal book about the most public of subjects:
             life in the postmodern West at the end of the
             millennium and what the cities, the freeways, the
             open spaces, and the billboards tell us about
             ourselves.

             William L. Fox will be on hand to sign copies of
             his new books.

             The Vampire Lectures
             By Lawrence Rickles
             Published by University of Minnesota Press

             Things get spooky in cultural studies on
             Halloween! The Vampire Lectures is based on the
             course that Lawrence Rickles has taught for
             several years at the University of California,
             Santa Barbara. Rickles gives undead history of
             vampirism in legend, literature, and film. The
             Vampire Lectures makes an original and
             intellectually rigorous contribution to literary
             and psychoanalytic theory as Rickles identifies
             the subconscious meanings, complex symbolism, and
             philosophical arguments--particularly those of
             Marx, Freud, and Nietzsche--embedded in vampirism
             and the gothic.

             Come meet Lawrence Rickles before the lights go
             out!

One week from today

Tuesday, October 5th at 8 pm

Lawrence Ferlinghetti & Edward Sanders read at the Poetry Project

Yes, that's Lawrence Ferlinghetti of A Coney Island of the Mind and A Far
Rockaway of the Heart, and the man who was dragged to court in the 1950s
on obscenity charges (he was acquitted) for daring to be the first to
publish Allen Ginsberg's _Howl_ through City Lights Publishing House (of
which he is the co-founder).

And yes, that's Edward Sanders, the founder of the Fugs and the author of
1968: A Year in Verse, Tales of Beatnik Glory, and, his newest project,
America, a History in Verse, Volume I (1900-1939), forthcoming from Black
Sparrow this fall.

Lawrence Ferlinghetti will be interviewed live at WNYC the same Tuesday
from 1:15-1:45 pm by Leonard Lopate--that's 820 on your AM dial.
Ferlinghetti reads very rarely on the East Coast, and this is a very rare
chance to see him in NYC. Door sales only

Please note that this reading is on a Tuesday (NOT Wednesday)...


And other upcoming readings

Monday, October 4th, first open-mike of the year, sign-up at 7:30 pm,
reading at 8 pm.

Friday, October 8 at 10:30 pm

Po'Jazz, an evening with Golda Soloman, the founder and leader of the
poetry-jazz group Po'Jazz, writer-journalist Gerthie Owtram, and
musicians.

pete,

    any information on obtaining rea's work would be appreciated.  I
became interested in her work after seeing the vector poems in _Point of
View_ and translating her brief piece in _sic
(http://www.sicmagazine.com).  Yes, I think you should send your films
in even if they won't understand it.

When I spent a night in the Tombs (legendary NYC jail), I especially

BUT NOT UNTIL AFTER YOU PASS THIS ONE ON TO EVERYONE YOU KNOW!!!

http://members.aol.com/justicewrtr/justice4all/main.htm

Mr. President and fellow writers:

It has long been one of my goals to write and publish a novel.  Well, the writing part (and rewriting part, and rewriting one more time) is done, and now the publishing part begins.

In reading up on the publishing industry and looking at the technology available, I have decided to try to market my book electronically while I seek an agent and a traditional publisher.  This has the advantage of (hopefully) making me some money now, and developing a following for my work which might help to attract a traditional publisher.

My novel is a murder/mystery story entitled Justice For All.  In order to market it online, I've created a web site where readers can find out a little about the book, and even read the first few chapters.  The web site also offers readers a chance to order the complete novel, delivered to them in electronic form via email.

Of course, as with all web-based enterprises, the key is to create traffic to the site, and that's where I hope you'll help me.  Please visit the site and check out my story.  Then, pass this letter along to friends, relatives and others who like to read, encouraging them to visit as well.

With your help, I can get this thing off the ground, and hopefully attract the attention of an agent and traditional publishers.  With lots of work and lots of luck, you'll soon see my book at a bookstore near you.

Visit and send your friends to the site today!

http://members.aol.com/justicewrtr/justice4all/main.htm

Thanks for your help!

Philip Middleton

PS: If this letter offends you in any way, I apologize.  Please disregard.

hey folks, been a while... trying to get things together here in
colorado... so far it's been  going fine, kass and i are settling in some...

note my new address, as above:  joe.amato@colorado.edu

ron s. and david b:  i was at a humanities institute conference at
suny/stony brook march of last year, at which judith barry was also one of
the presenters... i think it fair to say we both felt a certain empathy for
what the other was up to, presentation-wise... as i recall, judith now
lives in the city, on spring street...

i've been tempted to jump into SO many threads these past few months---but
have had neither the calories nor the hardware to participate on a
sustained basis... i'm still struck by the level of heat in these regions,
though i can understand why east timor (e.g.) or editorial practices (e.g.,
and a touch of zeugma here, sure) can elicit such a flurry of impassioned
responses... w/o articulating my own position on these (and other) issues
(which wouldn't be to the point, latecomer that i am), i guess i have to
observe that the the best and the worst of the list seems most incipient at
these moments... i'll leave it to each of you to tease out the implications
here, or plain ignore them (!)... but personally, i think it's a mistake to
take for granted the nature of the exchange (if that's what it is) that's
going on here, and that might go on here...

that said, i imagine this space/event mself, based on what i know of its
history, as a relatively left-of-center, non-mainstream conjunction, both
politically and aesthetically... that is, this is how i come to "poetics@,"
even if there has often been a resistance expressed hereabouts wrt
correlating the aesthetic too directly with the political... in all, this
list seems to me (to me) politically informed and aesthetically savvy, but
at times somewhat lacking when it comes to more bracing confrontations with
broader configurations of the real (i'm struggling here to characterize
things, you can tell---so a pinch of salt, please)... anyway, it's
important to note that there are nonetheless differences possible within
all conjunctions (urban, pastoral, socialist, gregorian), and also that a
failure to "read" any conjunction as such will undoubtedly result in
misunderstandings, jihad, etc. (albeit the latter are always possible in
any case)...

i mean, it takes time to come to grips with the somewhat fluctuating
presence of this collective, no?...

well so... looks like the first snow of the season tonight in the
denver/boulder area, BRRRRRR...

best,

joe

* Jaime Saenz Feature *  five poems, and excerpts from the long poem
Immanent Visitor, translations by Kent Johnson and Forrest Gander

Poet Jaime Saenz (1921-1986) is Bolivia's leading writer of the 20th
century. Prolific as poet, novelist, and non-fiction writer, his baroque,
propulsive syntax and dedication to themes of death, alcoholism, and
otherness make his poetry among the most idiosyncratic in the
Spanish-speaking world.=20

Just a quick note here to point out the Simon Perchik interview in the new
issue of Jacket:

http://www.jacket.zip.com.au/welcome.html

This is a long overdue piece on one of the more active poets we've had for
decades and a very
interesting take on how a poet might fit in who was, for so many years, busy
primarily doing other
things, especially practicing law. (When, in the early 1970s, I considered
lawschool briefly, I wrote to
Perchik and sought his advice. He gave it freely and helped steer me away
from such a fate.)

Perchik was continually in the interesting magazines of that period and, had
the Allen anthology
appeared a little later, might well have appeared there. His books, like all
those of Elizabeth Press,
were excellent examples of what a small press edition could be. (Writing
this, I realize that I
must owe Robin Blaser for having acquired these works originally for the SF
State library,
where I first encountered them -- the first two in any event would have been
in print before Robin
headed north.)

David Baratier has done us all a great service. The issue has several poems
and Baratier's
interview brings out both the expected (the best explanation of the
Perchik's trademark use of the
colon, displaced immediately in front of a word, like :this) and the
unexpected (the origin of
many of the pieces in photography and the systematic nature of his practice
surprised me).
This is what scholarship should be.

Bravo to all involved,

Ron Silliman

Baratier's interview is also an antidote to the Alvaro de Campos report on
the Cambridge Conference
on Contemporary Poetry, in which Sr. de Campos appears to have had mild
fantasies about one or
two poets (female) and detested everything else. Sort of a Rolling Stock
classic, post la lettre.

One suspects that whatever happened at that conference, it was not what is
reported here.

As John Tranter notes at the end of the piece:

"It should be noted by readers prone to fits of excitability and obsessive
thoughts of revenge that the opinions of Senhor de Campos and his companion
are not necessarily those of the editor of this magazine."

He is, however, the editor.

Jay:

One of the most interesting and compelling results of chance-driven
method is in Mark Nowak's "early" work (ca. 1990-92), though such
classification makes him sound like a museum artifact or
something, which he isn't-- he lives, still under 40, I think, in St.
Paul. I haven't been in touch with Mark for quite some time, but
knew him while he was developing this series when we both were
students at Bowling Green. I can't recall now the name of the
series, nor the old, idiosyncratic source text he was using, but
selections appeared in a number of magazines around that time,
including in his furtive and very fine _furnitures_, and in a magazine
(I don't know if it is still publishing) called _Cyanosis_, where there
are numerous selections and a discussion on the work and
chance/procedural methods in general between Mark, me, and
the prominent Russian critic Mikhail Epstein. I think this came out
in 1991, though I no longer have the issue.

I also believe Mark has a book coming out from Coffee House
Press, and it's possible that there may be some
examples therein. In any case, I know he was corresponding with
MacLow and Cage back at this time, and both, I remember, were
very interested. Come to think of it, I believe there are some
samples from this work in the anthology edited by Lisa Jarnot,
et.al. A New American Poetry (?), but maybe I'm misremembering.

So you and others interested in "chance-generated" work may
want to track some of this down. It was a project done with great
seriousness and care, and the results were quite beautiful.

aleatorical methods-especially related to Retallack and other more

I am interested in a how people actually read books of poetry, e.g.,
straight through, the poems in random order, partially or completely,
according to some other method, etc... Back channel or front is
appropriate. Why do I want to know? Aside from the fact that I am an odd
person, it seems that there is a certain tension between the idea of an
ordered collection of poetry and the fact that people often read poetry in
more random fashion--I often read other kinds of writing like this now,
reading random pages of novels or critical essays. I also have a theory
that books of poetry are often structured redundantly.

Subject:      Jacket #8 / Perchik-Baratier interview : ~reply
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain

Ekphrasis.  Yes, an ~ekphrasis.~

I had wanted to mention the Jacket / Perchik-Baratier interview back
when the list was discussing that topic "What should a standard cover
letter include?" and all our resident editors were contributing how
submitters should subscribe and scrutinize literary magazines and flatter
the editors in the first paragraph.  Perchik, some say the most widely
published of all contemporary poets, says this on his strategy for
publication:

"It's called carpet bombing. Three times a year, I used to do it four times a
year, I write out all the envelopes from The International Directory of Little
Magazines and Small Presses so there's no emotional involvement, I've
got everything written out and all the return envelopes . . . When they
come back all I do is the mechanical act of taking the submission from the
rejected envelope into a new one with a stamp and out it goes.  No
emotion involvement. I just feel it's coming back and out it goes again."

Wouldn't it be interesting to know what other tactics our more widely
published poets use.  Are we to imagine that all these other writers put in
the ~hours~ necessary to thoroughly familiarize oneself with the literary
journal horizon?

Perchik comes across as a highly plain-spoken man,--- but I thought his
"revelation" about using photography books as the basis for all his poetry
had tempting theoretical implications.  After all, the opacity of his elliptical
poems reads as constructivist, doesn't it?  One tries --- ~I~ try --- to read
him, like anyone's poem, by interrelating the material I'm presented with,
and seeing what congruences can be drawn.  But, from what Perchik
tells us, we now see that any attempts at interpretation we've made had
been calculated on the basis of what economics calls ~"incomplete
information."~  His entire output is an ~ekphrasis,~ and if we were to see
those source pictures side-by-side with their respective poems, many
things that previously had appeared non sequitur, unexplained, or
gratuitous would now jump out of the picture's frame as justified, even
mandatory.  It turns the sacred cow of ~referentiality/non-referentiality~
around on its horns. --- With other similar poetry, this pitfall of "incomplete
information" usually turns up in the form of unstated ~autobiographical~
associations.  Perhaps naively, for example to name only one, I was
surprised to hear Ann Lauterbach's spoken introductions to her poems at
poetry readings, where "fragments," as she calls her new style, that
were hitherto inaccessible to me and read as autonomous inventions, in
fact related back on an almost point-by-point basis to personal
experiences she could identify, such as a trip around the coastline of
Greece with--- John Hollander!  To name two, there's an interview on the
Net that I've lost track of, with John Ashbery, where Ashbery is asked to
comment specifically on that poem of his that starts with the place-name
"Nagoya", mention of "boy scouts", etc.; and he delineates that one
obscurity about architecture goes back to his being stranded in the
walled city of Chester, and that another came from him literally being at
the Empire State Building (can you believe this?) and ~seeing~ a pack of
boy scouts get off an elevator all with "Nagoya" on their baseball caps,
and so on. (Cretan fallacy?) It's phenomenological, guys, but I can't help
but think these distinctions ~do~ matter.  (Personally, I have an aversion
to a poetic principle that can be re-codified back into personal
information.)  Perchik's method just makes the role of concealed,
supplementary information explicit--- hey! as though all these
unannotated associations could be consumed back into one great
~Family of Man~ ~Wittgensteinian picture theory~ book!

Perchik also defies poet interview expectations by, aside from casual
mentions of Corman, Olson, or Blackburn in a different context, having
virtually nothing to say, being asked nothing, about literary ~influences,~
canon, or contemporaries.

>>> Ron Silliman <ron.silliman@GTE.NET> 09/28/99 11:17pm >>>
Just a quick note here to point out the Simon Perchik interview in the new
issue of Jacket:

http://www.jacket.zip.com.au/welcome.html

This is a long overdue piece on one of the more active poets we've had
for
decades and a very
interesting take on how a poet might fit in who was, for so many years,
busy
primarily doing other
things, especially practicing law. (When, in the early 1970s, I considered
lawschool briefly, I wrote to
Perchik and sought his advice. He gave it freely and helped steer me
away
from such a fate.)

Perchik was continually in the interesting magazines of that period and,
had
the Allen anthology
appeared a little later, might well have appeared there. His books, like all
those of Elizabeth Press,
were excellent examples of what a small press edition could be. (Writing
this, I realize that I
must owe Robin Blaser for having acquired these works originally for the
SF
State library,
where I first encountered them -- the first two in any event would have
been
in print before Robin
headed north.)

David Baratier has done us all a great service. The issue has several
poems
and Baratier's
interview brings out both the expected (the best explanation of the
Perchik's trademark use of the
colon, displaced immediately in front of a word, like :this) and the
unexpected (the origin of
many of the pieces in photography and the systematic nature of his
practice
surprised me).
This is what scholarship should be.

Bravo to all involved,

Ron Silliman

Ron Silliman's criticism of the report in Jacket from the Cambridge
conference raises an interesting question. Should personae be
subject to "our" standards of cultural and social propriety? More to
the tangled point of the case under discussion, should the visiting
ghosts of personae originally brought into being by others be
subjected to a personality modification to better accomodate
current "sensibilities"? The Alvaro de Campos who reports on the
Cambridge conference is suggestively akin (if actually quite a bit
less of a sexist and pederast than the original) in his tone and
bearing to the Alvaro de Campos of the 1920's and 30's-- a poet
who stands today as one of the great poets of Portugal and
Europe, even though he was never actually real, in the sense,
anyway, that Ron, for example, is real.

If the editor of Jacket should not have included de Campos'
remarks because the latter seemed to have been too carnally
interested in some of the women poets present (men poets and
women poets reading this-- have you never gazed leeringly at some
poets of the opposite or same sex at conferences you've attended?
Has sex never interfered with your attention and dispassionate
listening? Is de Campos, truly, in a sense, not like you?) then he
should have better excluded the translations of Bolivian poet Jaime
Saenz that are featured in the same issue: Saenz flirted
enthusiastically with fascism-- in fact, when a young man, he even
took a trip to Nazi Germany to see the "achievements" of Hitler's
fascism for himself. There is no evidence, however, that he was anti-
semitic or acutely sexist like Williams or Pound or Spicer, etc. etc.
etc. poets who, heaven forbid, will never reappear to report back for
Jacket on the MLA or something! Can you imagine how
uncomfortable for sensibilities that might turn out to be?

I like this question (how do I read a book of poems?)  To start with,
how I read a book of poems depends on who composed it.  If I know the
poet well, I very probably will try to read it straight through,
stopping when tired.  If the poet is new to me, I'll probably read the
first poem, but rarely keep going by the numbers unless the first poem
really grabs me--which the first poems of poets new to me rarely do
because of me, not the poet.  With new poets' work, I'll skip around a
bit, then either drop out of the book or keep skipping around till I've
read all the poems, depending on how well I like them.
  Another consideration is why I'm reading them since reading a book
I've agreed to review makes me read a little differently than just
reading a book.  I also sometimes read a collection for inspiration,
looking for techniques I can use (mostly) and so I skim.
   Many times I just glance at the poems in a book and don't read any,
if they're obviously crap.  Rhymes and God are an obvious indicator (and
I'm speaking now mainly of collections submitted to my press--and with
one of them usually hunt for the shortest poem in it).  Free verse angst
is usually pretty obvious to the most superficial of skims.  (There is
danger I'll miss irony, though.)  Visual poetry is usually easy to get
an idea of without even verbally skimming.
   I hardly ever read a collection straight through at one sitting.  (I
think the ideal number of poems in a collection is around 20 one-pagers,
or the equivalent of longer poems--usually.)
  I'm sure I chould be able to say a lot more but can't think of
anything to add right now.

note this desperate saga of intensity in which people and their words fall
into shuddering differences of opinionated lethargy. the result: people
speaking of terms to integrate their nothings and their somethings into new
party politics, or partly new, or old, or savoury: we're talking words here.
meanwhile, selfsame people determine their place, and furthermore, place
themselves. within logical extremes much can be isolated for study. this
study would need more participants, especially those eagerly wired for
further assumptions. the assumptions can fly into any direction or region,
the point is mostly that the tones be pure and never risky for the logical
extreme. the logical extreme must remain compliant at all times. with that
one rule in place, much can nonetheless move forward. 1st of all determining
if forward is anywhere, and if that anywhere could usefully challenge the
current pedigree of assumption. debating that will cause minutes to lope
into hours and hours to spill into rivers and rivers to furnish stars and
stars to explain communities and communities to isolate individuals in odd
practices, suggestions, barriers, principles and bunds. the work will go on.

Jeffrey Jullich, I don't know if I'm understanding your response to the
Perchik "revelations" about using photos as a jumping off point for his
poetry: you seem disturbed about his presenting "incomplete information."
Are the actual images of the photos what you feel you are "missing"? Or do
you wish you'd known about the process/origins of the poems before you read
them?

You said: "His entire output is an ~ekphrasis,~ and if we were to see those
source pictures side-by-side with their respective poems, many things that
previously had appeared non sequitur, unexplained, or gratuitous would now
jump out of the picture's frame as justified, even mandatory."

My first question is: Whose output would you cite as *not* an ekphrasis?

And as far as finding missing info in the photos, Perchik says: "The photo
is important only in that it makes me move forward. Not that the photo will
ever be in the poem. 99.9 per cent of what is in that photograph never
appears. So when people say, "You're writing a poem to a photograph, let me
see the photograph" I say, 'Listen, they have nothing to do with one
another.' Very often, there is a need to write. Just as there's a need to
talk, and if you feel like writing but you don't know what to write - this
is as good a method as any."

It seems to me that he uses the photos as a kind of oblique motivator, and
that the"information" in the photo is not at all what's of concern. So it
can't really be "missing." And I can't speak for Ashbery or Lauterbach, but
I've always felt that they were working somewhat similarly toward poems
that are--as David Sylvester has characterized Francis Bacon's work--
"descriptive, though not illustrative."

In reading the interview I was continually reminded of Howard Hodgkin, who
describes his process as one that I would have thought quite similar to
Perchik's, until--come to find out in reading your post--I found it is more
like Ann Lauterbach's.

Anyhow, in reading your post I felt that you think Perchik using photos is
a rip. Is that true?

So if you have any ideas let me know, or if you want to go ahead and send

i doubt anyone is rigorously front to last, there's got to be someone i
s'pose

my own habits depend on the book
consider that big 45-75 volume of creeley
from u of c press
rc's poems all for the most part small etc
i browsed that book a lot when i bought it
and still do browse in it
but the book mark that was in it for a year or more
represented where i'd read to
in linear counting fashion

a lot of collections of poetry are just that
a collection of things
beans in bag ----- like that

but it seems to me a shame to ~only~ read
spicer's little books or creeley's or
something like rosmarie waldrop's
_reproduction of profiles_ or dorn's
_slinger_ (obviously there are many more)
by an unstructured "chance" ops
kind of approach

will reading things in odd sequence
reveal things about them ?

eh..   probably.but i'd guess that
these revelations apply best to
to the texts experienced in this way

thus maybe suited quite well to some of
coolidge and bruce andrews and
jim leftwich and some john cage
but not so well to
david antin or some john cage etc etc

of course i'm sort of assuming that we're
talking about 1st reads here
and i'd bet that almost anyone
who has read a book already feel
quite comfortable browsing back thru it

to yr theory of poetry books
being structured redundantly ive
one last wonder
   is this something one
cdnt tell reading them
in the "missionary position"  ?

that is
do you see yr non-sequential
reading habits as providing the
input to yr theorizing ?


i once read about 4,5 pages
of a novel backwards
while on a break at my job

it was funny

not really sure what else

These issues/discussions make me think about the value of 'generative

other's have with one's own work. Obviously varies from work to work,
from helpful to obfuscating to gimmicky?

Hello All,

1. I have a vague recollection of an essay by Marjorie Perloff in which she
discusses _Stealing the Language_ (the Alicia Ostriker anthology of women
poets). Does anyone know the essay and which book it's in?

2. I'm also looking for recommendations of critical work on Erica Hunt.

Please backchannel
kathylou@worldnet.att.net
and I'll send you a free copy of Lipstick Eleven No. 1 if you like.
(I'll also compile and post the Hunt list if something comes of it.)

Thank you.

My full name, as some friends know, is Aldon Lynn Nielsen -- This
proliferation of "n"s marks me as the first ur-pre-post-LANGUAGE poet,  a
close cousin of Lyn Hejinian, whose partial-but-expanded namesake I
actually am --

I don't have Barry's current address, but he has lived for years in the
D.C. area, and last I knew was still in the rare book business -- He may
not be listed in the phone book, but other book people around D.C. may help
you locate him -- I last spoke to him at the MLA in D.C. a couple years ago --

I have VORTs 1,2,3,5,6 & 8 -- anybody out there have the numbers I'm
lacking by any chance?

All those Names ending with N's!

Here's a pregnant phrase that ends with N too:

The Author function.

On another note, I went back to de Campo's exuberantly cynical
take on the Cambridge conference and noticed that my memory
from the first read of it (a couple months ago) was off. de Campos'
(and sidekick Soares') reactions to the girl poets there are no
different from their reactions to the boy poets there. In fact, if there
is anything nearing sexual yearning in the whole piece, it is when
the two heteronyms of heteronyms run their admiring hands over
the chest hair of Michael Palmer.

Shocking, perhaps, but not so much as the de Campos of the Oda
Maritima, who in opium ecstasy fantasizes being flogged and
fucked (I believe that term is now the politically correct word?) by a
whole shipfull of pirates!

Probably this approach is meaningless to someone who reads pages from
critical essays at random, but after expending considerable effort
organizing a manuscript of poems into a book, I want readers to humor me
and read them as presented.
