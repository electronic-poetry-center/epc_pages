strange energies

this machine lies old and cracked in the garbage. the desk has collapsed
and no longer supports anything. my hands are shattered bones. the walls
of this building leave small traces in the earth overgrown with weeds. the
fabric of the chair has decayed and its frame rusted. my sweater has
disappeared. the air has shifted. the copper pipes lie in a tangled heap.
the trees have moved on. there are different elements. my glasses are
buried in the muck. the keyboard has been recycled into annihilation. the
sounds are screaming and unknown. the wiring is broken into pieces. light
radiates nowhere. the christmas tree has turned to dust. my eyes are eaten
out. my partner lies dead among me. unknown radiations screech through the
atmosphere. winds bring difference. the pair of scissors is twisted miles
from here. the sink is overturned deep below the surface of the bround.
the keyboard is smashed and silent. the electric fan has corroded down to
the level of the interior rotor. the hard drive has bent beyond
recognition. the junked couch is nothing but rusted springs. different
clouds gather here. the remains of the cat have been completely devoured.
the edo chest has recycled into different plants. the model woodie with
its tiny surfboard has disappeared. the windows are smashed beyond
recognition. the bed has been junked and buried. my arms are broken into
pieces. the cars are shattered bones. the neck has collapsed and no longer
supports anything. the city is overgrown with weeds. my clothes are buried
in the muck. the smashed abacus lies empty and beadless. the television
has recycled into different plants. sound radiates nowhere. the radio has
been completely devoured. the video tapes are smashed beyond recognition.
the fabric of the chair has decayed and its frame rusted

vomit culture.

culture which regurgitates itself.
cnn covering films which have embedded commercials between commercials on
cnn.
capital feeds on capital.
there are no disruptions.
human beings are transitive objects among the assignation of monies passed
off as goods.
what is the exchange value of a human.
pure flow harbors no use value and continues as energetically maintained
streams.
the streams are maintained by other streams.
the streams feed into themselves and each other.
the world is awash with capital which fills and fulfills all ecological
niches.
every extinction of a plant or animal is replaced by a product.
every obsolete product is replaced by a surfeit of products.
capital gnaws on itself and is maintained by solar energy.
solar energy transforms into consumption.
the sun consumes itself.
vomit culture.

Can I ask a question? A serious question to which I do
not know the answer(s):

When English literature was first added to school
curricula, it was in the colonial schools in India and
its purpose there was a way to culturally trained the
comprador middle bureaucratic class (among other
things of course).

What is the cultural (or other) purpose of our
teaching of literature and/or poetry in higher
education now?

It must be an odd GRE-style logic. E.g.

Memory : Wisdom
Dictionary : Treaties
Viagra : Impotence????

Those clever marketers!

sKincerity

New from Atelos Books: By Laura Elrick


Each of these poems attends the "dimension in a street" and the variation=20
found there, below the "billboard's traffic stream" and otherwise ubiquitous=
=20
capitalist referentiality. Aware that it cannot gather the totality, Elrick'=
s=20
constructivism has spatial and energetic exchange enough to convert the weig=
ht of=20
present circumstances into possibility, present and real longing. This poetr=
y=20
hears and thinks under the pressure of this evacuated life, while occupying=20
the brink of something better.

--Kristen Gallagher

Never forgetting that hegemony is fought bloc by bloc, SKINCERITY builds a=20
spatial and social logic dynamically scaled from the body to the global. Thi=
s=20
logic begins with the question What is to be done and moves through critique=
 and=20
a recombinatory poetics to ask Where is it to be done. Elrick's important=20
book aims towards social justice at a time when empire is cracking for preci=
sely=20
that lack--what better place for poetry to be.

--Jeff Derksen


If in this century you are keen to pluck the "little 'plants' in the ballot=20
box of drugged soldiers"--and you should be--reach for Elrick's terrific=20
portable phonology forsenics kit, asking "the historic / multi-task /=20
extravaganza":"shouldamerica / shouldworld."

--Heather Fuller


Laura Elrick is the author of sKincerity (Krupskaya Books, 2003), and a=20

Andrew,
Looks like good stuff in this new installation. I am looking forward to
checking it out. A question I have about review. I have a book out just out
like this week, Unhurried Visions, and was wondering about your policy on
reviews. Are you accepting reviews? How do you do it?

Hope all's well,
Michael

actually

I have a friend from College who is an editor at National Review
(the bible of the right) and he said to me
quite a few months ago that the goal of many Republican groups
(Cato Institute and AEI) is to separate Academic funding giving
more to the sciences and science/Technology universities (EG
MIT, Cal Poly, Iowa State, others) and defund the humanities and arts.

I think this is an important topic since most academics are
center left and left and they have no influence within Republican
circles they are not going to be listened to. I am not an
academic but since most of the poetry and poetics I care about
comes out of Academia this is a fear.

Hal Sirowitz's new collection is all about the one word its title leaves
out: SEX. Hal shares the ups and downs of his romantic history from
adolescence to adulthood and lets his girlfriends do most of the talking.
Sometimes Hal strikes out, sometimes he gets lucky, but he kisses and tells
in the inimitable Sirowitz style that has inspired hilarity and Hal-O-Mania
from New York to Norway.

http://www.daphnegottlieb.com

"From baby to baby sitter to bartender; from Barbie to mother to whore,
Gottlieb delves into women's roles and role reversals, stretching feminist
boundaries with her limitless point of view. Drawing from an array of texts=
,
ranging from Emerson's essays to newspaper accounts of the murder of Eddie
'Gwen' Araujo, she writes poems that are at times gritty, sexual, violent
and sad, evoking in the process a numbr of women such as Stevie Smith, Anne
Sexton and Adrienne Rich. ...What separates Gottlieb from that crew of
writers is that the protagonists of her poems are more often heroes than
victims, hunters rather than prey.... One hopes that Gottlieb's thoughtful
poems about what it means to be female and thus subject to the male gaze ar=
e
welcomed by new readers of any gender." =8BSan Francisco Chronicle

To keep it "higher." Without the Humanities we don't have education but job
training centers, which is what many American universities are becoming. The
plan is not to have educated citizens, but job-ready citizens, a move toward
the completion of the Capitalist State.
At Thanksgiving dinner was a young woman who attends the University of
Oregon. She told me she has a double major: Art and Business. "Just in
case," she said. I suggested that (as she won't be an artist, which I didn't
tell her) she plan to teach art. She replied that she's considering this
option.

Best,
Joel

There is a basic incoherence in the right wing strategy against higher
education.  On the one hand, they want to defund higher education.  (Good
thing the feds don't pay for it, except for financial aid.)  On the other
hand, they want to regulate it more, which requires money.  For inst.,
some conservatives want to make the canon more central to higher
education.  The task of curriculum supervision, however, is done not by
states and not by the feds, but by accreditors who are voluntary,
self-governing and self-supporting (and who also make recomendations about
financial aid.)  So, in order to federalize higher ed, money would
have to be taken from the institutions and put it into bureaucracy.

As it is, higher ed has been defunded for the last ten years, more
intensely in the last two, and it has been declining slowly for twenty.
Goal 1 is being achieved, regardless.  Institutions already know how to
deal with it.  And goal 1 will not achieve the end of the humanities
(which conflicts, by the way, with goal 2, since computer
scientists--except for odd ones--can't teach Plato or Joyce).  The
humanities are cheap, both at the undergraduate and graduate level.  We
cut corners, but they actually help fund other, more fund-driven pursuits,
such as chemistry, physics, and even business, because their students pay
what everybody else pays and the state subsidizes them at the same rate.

Essentially, conservatives believe their anecdotal and assumption driven
ideas about higher ed.  As I say below, they are in for some surprises if
they only listen to their extremists, who by definition don't do homework.

I have more comments below, unfortunately in caps.

And Kirby, I do appreciate your interventions here.  I just for once
wanted to do a more direct rebuttal.  I believe you were Mona's student,
as am I.  So we are from the same tribe, as it were.

HE DIDN'T SAY THIS, KIRBY.  HE SAID IF CONSERVATIVES WANTED TO BE IN THE

THIS IS INCORRECT.  CLASSICS, NEAR EASTERN LANGUAGES, MEDIEVAL STUDIES,
ETC. ARE ALL STILL TAUGHT AT VARIOUS PLACES, SOMETIMES IN ENGLISH
DEPARTMENTS.  THEY HAVE FADED BECAUSE OF FUNDING AND INTEREST GAPS, BUT
THEY REMAIN.  IT'S ROT TO SAY THAT "HISTORY" IS NOT BEING TAUGHT BY THE
ACADEMY.

He knows that and so do the conservatives.  Last night

AGAIN, ROT.  AT A PUBLIC SCHOOL YOU HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT MAD PARENTS AND
MAD LEGISLATORS.  AT A PRIVATE, YOU COUNT ON YOUR ALUMNI.  BOTH OF THESE
GROUPS MAY HARBOR ALL THE PREJUDICES YOU CITE, BUT KNOW WHO TO CALL TO
RAISE A FUSS...BECAUSE THEY MAY HAVE GONE TO THE PARTICULAR INSTITUTION.

FISH IS SOUNDING A WARNING.  HE DOES NOT THINK THINGS ARE NOT WRONG, BUT
THAT THERE IS A CONSIDERABLE MISUNDERSTANDING OF WHAT ACADEMIA DOES AND
DOES NOT DO.  HE IS PROBABLY SICK AND TIRED OF HAVING TO EXPLAIN HIMSELF,
SINCE HE DOES IT VERY WELL, BUT HIS COLLEAGUES.

MOST UNIVERSITIES ARE ACCOUNTABLE.  PUBLICS REPORT TO THE STATE ON
GRADUATION RATES, NUMBER CREDITS PER DEGREE, UNDERGRADUATES IN RESEARCH,
ETC.  PRIVATES HAVE TO MAKE THEIR ALUMNI HAPPY.  THE PROBLEM IS THAT THIS
DEBATE ISN'T BETWEEN OPPOSITES.  OR RATHER CONTRARIES--AS UW GRAD, YOU
MUST BE AWARE OF BLAKE...

THAT IS CERTAINLY WHAT THE ADMINISTRATION WISHES YOU TO BELIEVE.  THEY
WILL CAMPAIGN AGAINST HIGHER ED.  I THINK THEY WILL FIND THIS MORE
DIFFICULT TO DO THAN THEY KNOW.  AMERICANS DON'T LIKE PAYING FOR HIGHER ED
BUT THEN THEY DON'T LIKE PAYING FOR ROADS, TRAINS, SOCIAL SERVICES, BUT
THEY STILL WANT THEM.  MORE TO THE POINT, THEY STILL ADMIRE THEIR
TARHEELS, HUSKIES, BADGERS, GOLDEN BEARS, ETC. OR THE PROFESSOR THAT
TAUGHT THEM HOW TO READ BLAKE.  THERE IS MORE GOODWILL TOWARDS THE
UNIVERSITIES THAN THERE IS TOWARDS OUR PUBLIC SCHOOLS.  LIKE ROVE LOOKING
FORWARD TO FACING DEAN, I AM LOOKING FORWARD TO THIS DEBATE.

PARANOIA IS FINE AND PROBABLY AN EVOLUTIONARLY SOUND DEFENSE STRATEGY.
YET WHAT GIVES THESE REVOLUTIONARIES POWER IS FEAR, WHICH IS ONE REACTION
TO PARANOIA.  ANOTHER, MORE PATIENT REACTION, IS TO DO RESEARCH AND
REFLECT.  THE ECHT FREUDIAN QUESTION, WHY DOES THIS MAKE (ME, YOU, US,
THEM) SCARED?

Gerald,

It looks like no, at least that's as much as a cyber-foot-in-mouth like
myself can determine.

http://www.uncg.edu/wua/  gets one to the station's page.

http://www.uncg.edu/acm/projects/wuag/  gets one to a project to develop a
"streaming audio server" to donate to the station. No audio stream player
here at work, so I can't investigate the other link there.

All the best,

well---rather than belabor a point that i've belabored on this list
many many times, perhaps a quick excerpt from a book that i still
think is critical to the discussion of lefts and rights in academe,
(the late) bill readings's ~the university in ruins~, published way
back in 1996 (harvard up)...

here's a taste:

"It seems to me that the conservative jeremiads are motivated by the
fact that their authors feel the emptiness of the cultural power they
hold.  That is to say, they recognize
the powerlessness of the cultural power they hold, and they blame
left-wing academics for usurping it.  They hold the center, but they
know that it is merely a virtual point.  The cultural right is not
rebelling against its exclusion from the center but against the
exclusion *of* the center, its reduction.  The 'culture wars' thus
arise between those who hold cultural power but fear that it no
longer matters and those whose exclusion from that cultural power
allows them to believe that such power would matter if only they held
it.

" The relentless self-marginalization of both sides is a
self-blinding, a refusal to recognize that the stakes in the game
have changed, that the center actually *does not speak*, that the
privileged position of enunciation is not that of the subject who
participates in culture...." (pp. 114-15)

about all i would add, as a leftist myself (no fringe conduct implied
or intended) and as a friendly amendment, is that what's transpired
since readings penned those words has to do with the move to the
policy level of debate---the one fish is, helpfully i think, trying
to motivate academics to attend to... i.e., cultural centers and
ideologies the like aside---and they should be aside b/c "cultural
power" (as readings tries to illustrate) is not the same thing as
political-economic power---we need to Follow The Money... which the
right is managing par excellence...

best,

joe

many new media arts positions SHOULD include contemporary poetry (right
now, most are exclusively prose fiction- and nonfiction-based, and
either include theatrical performance only or exclude performance) AND
be open to MFAs,

even tech / business writing - creative writing positions (as opposed to
comp - creative writing) require a PhD in a new specialty -- mixing
humanities, business, and technology or science -- yet these don't
qualify someone to work in the field or teach students to work in the
field

as far as de-funding arts in favor of sciences -- technology case:

as tech-heavy schools (CalTech is a big bad one) have problems
recruiting and retaining (& graduating) female students and faculty,
funding these institutions is effectively funding male academics and
students

The famed Carnegie Mellon "solution" to this problem (which still has
not ensured more than 38% female enrollment) was to introduce humanities
("applications") into the sciences and to change recruitment (reduce
weighting of quantitative measures required for admission; consider
"differently qualified" candidates) -- to get around hazing ("informal
mentoring and support networks") by male students and male faculty they
found:

http://wics.cs.sfu.ca/Articles/Research/CMU-p79-fisher.pdf

They found the few women successful in computer science did not have
free choice -- job, major, school, or even college at all was a
financial or visa status decision made for the women by their families
and, through schools' financial aid departments, various private donors
and government agencies.

I wonder how the figures changed after the tech boom (during it, female
enrollment and graduation rates went WAY up) & are changing now.

Jane Margolis, who wrote the study & book, is now here in Los Angeles at
UCLA -- I met her at Antioch LA when I was teaching there.  Margolis, a
liberal non-technologist, argues that technologically-adept (and, in
general in these fields, more liberal than male students, although not
particularly liberal!) women should eschew financially-motivated pursuit
of success in computer science to become teachers (of children) and
social workers.

I am going to be giving two readings for my book, Dahlia's Iris--Secret =
Autobiography and Fiction (FC2 Press, distributed by Northwestern =
University Press: 1-800-621-2736). The first reading is at 7:00 PM on =
Friday Dec 5th for the Belladonna Series at Bluestocking, 172 Allen St. =
(below Stanton 7 Rivington), reading with Jen Benka and Susan Briante.
    The second reading is Sat. Dec 6th at 7:00 PM at Wordsworth Book =
Store, 30 Brattle St. Hardvard Squarre, reading with Brenda Iijima.
    Comments on the back of my book: Fanny Howe says, "Dahlia's Iris is =
a one-of-a-kind work of genius and aring. It exists in a celestial =
sphere of its own making like a comet that only exists by shattering the =
invisible warps that are in its path." Leslie Marmon Silko said (which =
also is a description of the book): "--an experience like no other I've =
had. Using the Tibetan form of Secret Autobiography, the author creates =
a sense of simultaneous interior and exterior in compressed spaces of =
text, which she calls Pal Mal Comics. Here the compression causes the =
war, individuals' interiors (including the novelist's) and the motion of =
trees and land to exist at once in a detective novel in futuristic San =
Francisco where the hyena Bush skulks with his attorney general, =
Robespierre. 'The task of Tibetan Secret Autobiography is to apprehend =
that state that is neither the outside not the inside creating the =
other, to bring about that instant of seeing which occurs at once when =
everything is dependent.' This is what the best novels, the best works =
of art do."

Patricks, both, and Alan

this is a belated message to say just how moved I have been by the openness
of your posts on this thread. And also surprised by a strange
synchronicity - this afternoon I spent an hour and a half (-'n ower 'n a
h-aaf- in my patois!) doing a recorded interview on poetry and mental health
for a research student. The interview had been arranged some weeks before so
it was a delightful coincidence that the subject should have suddenly
appeared here, despite the painful aspects of that subject.

While I didn't answer Kazim's question, maybe I opened an answer?
Poetry as an adjunct of urbanism -- delighting in or criticizing clover
leaf highway patterns, fences, a night's rest in a given hotel, and so
on.  A tree, a park, a cliff site.  A neighborhood.

At any rate Kazim seems to like things to remain open-ended and
inventive -- and I wouldn't want to provide too fast a closure for his
question even if it was within my limited capacity.

It's odd that this topic always comes up in a negative context even if it's
worded as mental "health" most people seem fascinatedwith the connection of
poetry to mental 'illness' and suicide.  Mental health poetry is usually
relegated to Hallmark and craft verse?

I know from my own recent experiences, for example, that thinking of writing
a poem and writing a poem are (were) signs of recovery from mental illness?

I, too, want to thank those who have discussed the topic so openly.
In the '70s, I lived with a poet who, long after we were together,

It was interesting, Tom, that when I was being interviewed today I had to
make a conscious effort to mention some of the 'negative' side not because I
don't count it as important but rather that there was so much to say about
the 'positives' the dark side was for once being left behind, much, no
doubt, to its chagrin. But really I could have spoke for twice as long and
still only touched the surface of the matter.

It's odd that this topic always comes up in a negative context even if it's
worded as mental "health" most people seem fascinatedwith the connection of
poetry to mental 'illness' and suicide.  Mental health poetry is usually
relegated to Hallmark and craft verse?

I know from my own recent experiences, for example, that thinking of writing
a poem and writing a poem are (were) signs of recovery from mental illness?

The pantoum Ron quotes on the blog is in Selected Shorter Poems (Junction
Press: 1999,
142 pages), which is available from yours truly. Cover price is US$16 ($13
for list members) plus postage. It gathers poems from his difficult-to-find
books, as well as about a dozen poems never collected before. Armand made
the initial selection and allowed some additions and subtractions at my
request. We finished it a few months before his death. Many of the poems
are, in their very different way, as wonderful as the best of The Tablets.

The translations of Dante (he completed 12 cantos of the Inferno) with
incredibly generous notes, not only on Dante's text but on his translation
process, was published by Talisman in 2000, cover price $13.95. It's
brilliant. I don't know if it's still available but my guess is that it is.

I'm editing a posthumous volume, containing unpublished poems from all
periods in his career (about 150 pages) for publication in 2004 or 2005.
Armand was one of the small handful of US poets of his generation that I
think should be required reading.

Hi, folks.

I'm doing some straight up answer mongering but I'm using very simple questions to garner some very complex answers. I'm helping some of the students I work with in understanding the roles and tasks of poetry in a less than conventional light. By asking for responses I show them that there is an amalgam of taste that abounds and that the mainstream workshop ethic is no longer, or should not be the mainstay.

So here goes, please take these questions in any direction, and please feel free to pick apart!

1. is the task of poetry to communicate? what, then, does it/does it not communicate and how?

2. does poetry communicate meaning? is signification meaning? is poetry a communicator of ideas? actions?

3. is the writer a "giver of consciousness"? (Sartre) a liberator? does this confer on the writer an ethical responsibility?

4. is it the task of poetry to take positions?

Like I said, very simple. But if you could somehow complicate matters for the benefit of my students, that would be much, er, fun.

Thanks very much.

Chris

Dear Everyone, especially the best makers of the SHORT GROUP POEM, I =
posted the "completed" poem to the list on Nov 29 at 2.08PM.  I had the =
idea of keeping it to a 24 hour task.  Apologies to those, for time zone =
reasons and otherwise, whose lines arrived after I posted.  I'm hoping to =
do another
small project with this.  I hope you also find further use for your lines =
as I certainly did not exhaust them.
With every good wish to you,

Because I appreciate your questions, I'll venture a few impressions between

>
> 1. is the task of poetry to communicate? what, then, does it/does it not

In my own practice, poetry discovers what I haven't previously communicated,
even to myself; thus, I suppose poetry communicates to me. If it
communicates to others, so much the better, but I take no responsibility for
what it communicates. I only aver that it has communicated something
sufficiently fresh to me that I will sign my name to it and trust its
efficacy.

> 2. does poetry communicate meaning? is signification meaning? is poetry a
communicator of ideas? actions?

Pardon the scholarly hedging, but I think that poetry can offer the
opportunity to negotiate meaning(s). Unlike the early Wittgenstein, I doubt
that one can communicate meanings; I'd rather trust Carl Rogers' emphasis on
reciprocal paraphrase (Spicer's After Lorca an extreme and extremely
satisfying example). Poetry invites and, now and then, inspires actions.
>
> 3. is the writer a "giver of consciousness"? (Sartre) a liberator? does
this confer on the writer an ethical responsibility?

Sartre's phrase strikes me as, frankly, intolerably condescending. Does the
writer 'liberate'? Perhaps, but who knows when or whom? I feel an ethical
responsibility to the poem, because as it occurs, I come increasingly to
know it, to serve its urgencies and accuracies. I've known only a few
readers who have any idea of my work's tenor, and rather than pandering to
their ethical compunctions, I trust their sensibilities and perceptions.

> 4. is it the task of poetry to take positions?

As in: "assume the position, punk"? Take them where? The practice of poetry
has helped me to discover positions I never suspected existed, but which
I've found it apt to consider--even to assume; as Archimedes said: "give me
a lever and a place to stand, and I will move the world."

        SIR GEORGE BOWRING


        To Bowring, man of many tongues,
        (All over tongues like rumour)
        This little birthday poem belongs
        To limn his learned humour;
        All kinds of trash he talks, I wis,
        Although he isn't single;
        As cunning as a parrot is
        But far more Polly-lingual.

Chris:

In response to Questions Simple:

I've but an elusive idea as to what is meant by "mainstream workshop =
ethic." Does it refer to the off-the-top commentaries of creative =
writing undergraduates barely informed about poetry?  Does it refer to =
normative notions about poetry's possibilities restrictively offered by =
teachers? Is this so-called "ethic" the insistent pedagogical outcome =
determined by the use of certain stylebooks, manuals and anthologies =
destined to establish "rules" of craft and intention? Is it some AWP =
mantra? The canon cum worksheet?

Isn't poetry all of the below -- communication, signification, idea =
giver, action maker, source of consciousness, positioner? Likely, at any =
point it is none of this or much more, both charted and beyond. The =
ethical question is, rather concretely and often complexly, the constant =
of many of the listserv's conversations.

Subject:        Questions Simple
Hi, folks.

I'm doing some straight up answer mongering but I'm using very simple =
questions to garner some very complex answers. I'm helping some of the =
students I work with in understanding the roles and tasks of poetry in a =
less than conventional light. By asking for responses I show them that =
there is an amalgam of taste that abounds and that the mainstream =
workshop ethic is no longer, or should not be the mainstay.

So here goes, please take these questions in any direction, and please =
feel free to pick apart!

1. is the task of poetry to communicate? what, then, does it/does it not =
communicate and how?

2. does poetry communicate meaning? is signification meaning? is poetry =
a communicator of ideas? actions?

3. is the writer a "giver of consciousness"? (Sartre) a liberator? does =
this confer on the writer an ethical responsibility?

4. is it the task of poetry to take positions?

Like I said, very simple. But if you could somehow complicate matters =
for the benefit of my students, that would be much, er, fun.

Thanks very much.

Chris

BOB PERELMAN / University of Pennsylvania
Author of Ten to One (Wesleyan), The Future of Memory,
and Playing Bodies (with Francie Shaw)

THE NEW AND ITS REPRODUCTIVE PRACTICES:
INNOVATIVE WRITING IN THE ACADEMY

Friday, December 5, 3 PM
Room 3234, 51 West Warren
Wayne State University / Free admission

         *****

On Bob Perelman: A "witty analyst of the language writing movement," and
Professor at the University of Pennsylvania,  Bob Perelman is one of its
most prominent poet/critics. He was, as well, immortalized as an example of
the postmodern condition in Fredric Jameson's essay "Postmodernism; or, The
Cultural Logic of Late Capitalism"--and has lived with the notoriety ever
since. John Ashbery has written of his work: "Most poets define poetry by
creating it. Bob Perelman creates it by defining it, and is thus one step
ahead of all poets under the sun, one step closer to colliding with Zeno's
vanishing point, to merging coyote with road runner, to winning the hand."

Perelman is author of thirteen books of poetry, including a selected poems,
One to Ten (Wesleyan), The Future of Memory (Roof Books), Seven Works (The
Figures), and Primer (This). His most recent work, Playing Bodies (Granary
Press) is a collaboration with the artist Francie Shaw. His critical
writings include The Marginalization of Poetry (Princeton) and The Trouble
with Genius: Reading Pound, Joyce, Stein, and Zukofsky (California).

Does anyone know in which of Robert Creeley's books,
if any, his poem "For Hannah's Fourteenth Birthday"
appears (beginning with the line "What's heart to
say")?

I'm not finding it in his ~Collected,~ ~So There,~ or
~Just in Time.~

(The poem appears on the 2000 Jagjaguwar audio CD,
~Robert Creeley.~)

Much appreciated.

Jeffre

hi jeffre

the poem appears in _If I Were Writing This_, Creeley's hardcover from new
directions on page 24.

What's heart to say
as days pass,
what's a mind to know
after all?

What's it mean to be wise
or right,
if time's still
insistent master?

But if you doubt the track,
still don't look back.
Let the love you bring
find its fellow.

Girl to young woman,
world's well begun.
All comes true
just for you.

Trust heart's faith
wherever it goes.
It still knows
you follow.







cheers,

jason

 Godless Sufism: An Evening of Modern Turkish Poetry


Celebrating the release of the long-awaited volume on Turkish poetry in the

20th century-featuring Talisman House founder ED FOSTER, poets MURAT

NEMET-NEJAT and MUSTAFA ZIYALAN and critic ZEYNEP SAYIN.

NEW YORK, NY-For its grand finale, the three-part NECESSARY TRANSLATIONS

series celebrates the forthcoming release of Talisman House's encyclopedic

compilation of 20th century Turkish poetry, Eda: An Anthology of

Contemporary Turkish Poetry, with an evening of readings from Turkish

writers, past and present.=A0Anthology editor, poet and translator Murat

Nemet-Nejat (A Blind Cat Black; I, Orhan Veli) will be joined by Talisman

House Founder Ed Foster, Mustafa Ziyalan (Impromptu, Night Ride on 21), and=20
critic Zeynep Sayin.

able to participate.



The poetic activity that swept through Turkey in the 20th century marks one

of the most exciting - though least known - moments in world literature.

With the collapse of the Ottoman Empire in 1923, followed by the

establishment of the Turkish Republic under Mustafa Kemal (better known as

Atat=FCrk), a vast array of modern literary forms opened up.=A0 Whether in

defiance of the official secularization of the country, or to create a

uniquely Turkish national idiom, writers turned to Sufi mystical poetry of

the 13th-16th centuries as a source of inspiration, alongside a newly

emerging cosmopolitan, secular literature.=A0 It is this hybrid voice that a=
ll

the writers included in the anthology share, and that is spotlighted this

evening.



Biographies:

Sonnet:  Success

        "A successful man is one who makes more
         money than a wife can spend. A successful
         woman is one who can find such a man."
                          --Lana Turner

A successful man is one who finds a wife who can live
on less money than he makes. A successful woman is one
who can avoid being ensnared by such a man. A man
who successfully weds such a woman is one who

most successful women go out of their way not to meet
or to date or to even hang out with. A woman who spends
more than her husband can make is one whom I'd love to meet
as long she spends much of it on me and that husband is not I.

A man who succeeds in wedding such a woman is a man
who weds pleasure and torment at the very same moment.
A woman whose husband cannot support her is one whom we
nowadays call an average woman. A man whose wife cannot

support him is truly in deep kimchi when he cannot support even
himself, not to mention those kids they both forgot to have.

1 year (and $100 million) later
--------------------

Poetry magazine's remarkable gift proves to be a 'mixed blessing'

By Charles Storch
Tribune staff reporter

December 2, 2003

Then the theater was changed

To something else. Its past was souvenir.

-- from "Of Modern Poetry," by Wallace Stevens

----------

When the organization that publishes little Poetry magazine announced at a dinner last November that a benefactor was giving it $100 million or more over 30 years, the then-U.S. poet laureate, Billy Collins, who was in attendance, exclaimed that "the poor little match girl of the arts ... just hit the lottery."

But the man who delivered the announcement, Joseph Parisi, sounded a more sobering note in an interview a year later. "Ask anyone who has won the lottery and he will tell you what a mixed blessing it can be."

Over the last 12 months, the euphoria within the organization over what is believed to be the largest gift to a literary group -- and which effectively guarantees in perpetuity the survival of the monthly founded 91 years ago in Chicago -- has been undercut by the prosaic details of managing new wealth and responsibly employing it in the service of poetry. For some staffers, the excitement over a submission by a promising new poet has competed with the tedium of long meetings on legal, accounting and investment issues.

There have been some significant changes. The Modern Poetry Association, the public support charity that publishes the magazine, has changed its name to the Poetry Foundation and intends to become a private operating foundation. The magazine and foundation have moved into more spacious quarters on the Near North Side, and the number of full-time staffers has increased, to six from four.

The biggest shock is that Parisi is not among them. On Aug. 8, two months after turning the editorship he had held for 20 years over to his hand-picked successor, Parisi, 58, quit as executive director of publications and programs, severing ties with an organization he had joined in 1976. He wouldn't discuss reasons for departing except to say he plans to pursue writing, lecturing and teaching projects.

But he makes it clear he had little patience with all the detail and paperwork associated with the outsize bequest. "It's a terrible burden," he said, adding, "You have no idea how many meetings you need."

In many respects, this organization is moving so deliberately that it probably is a year or more away from taking flight. There are many proposals to build the magazine and its book publishing arm and to donate money for poetry education and other outreach programs. But decisions await the hiring of a president of the foundation, a new post, which may come as early as this month, according to Susan Page Estes, who heads the board's search committee. Prospective investment advisers have flooded the foundation with resumes, but so far the board only has picked a consultant to help them choose a money manager, said board treasurer Ethel Kaplan.

And although the group may roll out some new public events and other efforts in 2004, program director Stephen Young said, "I see next year as another year of development. Probably beginning in 2005 things will start to come online."

Deborah Cummins, the board's chairman, offered this status report: "We are building the foundation of a foundation."

What's wrong with American literature?

You ask me? How much do I get?

-- "Question and Answer," by William Carlos Williams

In founding Poetry in 1912, Harriet Monroe set out to present the best writing she could find, expand the audience for poetry, and see that poets were adequately compensated. Even during desperate times, Poetry never missed an edition. Now, its days of scratching for funds are over because of Ruth Lilly of Indianapolis.

Lilly, now 88, is the last surviving great-grandchild of the founder of the Eli Lilly and Co. pharmaceutical firm. She has been giving more modest sums for decades to Poetry, including funding large prizes, obviously bearing no grudge for the magazine rejecting her poems. Lilly, a semi-recluse who has spent most of her life under care for depression, has corresponded with but never met anyone at Poetry.

The poetry world's reaction to news of her nine-figure, no-strings gift was a mix of envy and "Where's mine?" Poetry soon received hundreds of pleas for assistance from individuals and groups.

But Tree Swenson, executive director of the Academy of American Poets in New York, said there also was concern that, because of the Lilly gift, "now no one else will give to poetry, thinking that poetry is set."

But Stephen Berg, founder and a co-editor of the American Poetry Review in Philadelphia, said the Lilly gift helped to inspire a larger donation, of $5,000 over three years, to his bimonthly from the Tomorrow Foundation, which had previously given $1,000. APR appreciated the gesture, especially since tough times have forced it to cut salaries and author pay rates.

"I don't know what Poetry is going to do with all their money," he said. "I don't know what I would do with it if I got it."

Lilly's gift is paid in annual installments from three pots of money. Each has a different payout period; one ends with Lilly's death. For IRS reporting purposes, the foundation estimated Lilly gift's last year at $134.4 million. But the final total, will depend on many factors, including how long Lilly lives, the value of stocks in her trusts and the outcome of the foundation's suit against the Indiana bank managing her holdings. The foundation and another big beneficiary of Lilly say the bank waited too long to sell Eli Lilly stock as the price plummeted in 2002.

Kaplan said the foundation received about $14.16 million last January and, after this year's expenses, should have a total $27 million to $28 million when the second annual payment arrives in early 2004.

Rich Campbell, a partner in Chicago at the Mayer, Brown, Rowe & Maw law firm who represents the foundation, said in the next year or two the organization will make too much money from its investments and thus no longer qualify, under IRS rules, as a public support charity. It will then declare itself a private operating foundation.

As such, it will be required to give away at least 3.5 percent of its assets a year. Were it such a foundation in 2004 and assuming $28 million in assets, it would have to give away at least $980,000.

But Campbell said the foundation is "not necessarily required to give that money to others," and all its giving can go toward the magazine and its own programs. But the board has stressed it clearly intends to do more with the wealth.

I wandered through a house of many rooms.

-- From "Dreams in War Time," by Amy Lowell

For many years, Poetry operated out of 850 square feet in two cramped rooms in the Newberry Library. This year the small staff moved two blocks north into 2,500 square feet of rented space at 1030 N. Clark St. Near the end of a long corridor with many empty rooms is the office of Christian Wiman, editor of the magazine since June.

Wiman, 37, a writer who received one of the magazine's Lilly Poetry Fellowships in 1994, was teaching at Northwestern University in late 2002 when Parisi sounded him out about becoming editor.

"I wanted someone who I thought would have a very large purview," said Parisi of his successor. "Also I thought he was a person of great integrity and character."

Over its long history, Poetry has demonstrated a keen eye for new talent, presenting important early works of such poets as Stevens, Williams, Lowell, T.S. Eliot, Ezra Pound and Carl Sandburg.

More recently it has been criticized in literary circles for being too conservative and narrow in its selections. Wiman doesn't necessarily disagree with the appraisal.

"It needed a bit of a jolt. I think Joe [Parisi] recognized that," Wiman said.

Wiman hopes to enliven things with a new letters to the editor feature and essays by writers not usually identified with verse, such as Michael Lewis, author of such non-fiction books as "Moneyball."

The publicity about the Lilly gift helped to raise circulation by 1,400, to 11,046 paid, he said, and a direct-mail campaign planned for February could add more.

The magazine already has tripled its pay rate, to $6 a line for poetry and $150 a page for prose, which may increase submissions, now running at about 90,000 a year (although it prints only 300 poems a year).

Wiman also wants to expand Poetry's presence in libraries and launch a lecture series, initially in Chicago, on issues raised in the magazine. And he hopes the foundation one day will buy a home for the magazine and its collection of some 30,000 books, now stored in the Newberry.

His model is the Poets House literary center and library in New York City.

These are among the ideas that will be presented to the new foundation president.

Since late spring, Estes said, the board and the Witt/Kieffer search firm have received nearly 200 applications for the post, recently paring the field to three.

The job description calls for experience running established organizations and nurturing start-ups and a "resonance with poetry."

"We aren't looking for a poet or writer per se," she said.

Helen Klaviter, 59, a veteran of 30 years with the organization and its business and projects editor, has experienced the hard times there, making its assured existence all the sweeter. "It's exciting to consider bringing to reality programs that were only daydreams," she said.

The empty offices around hers will be filled once a president makes hiring decisions, she said.

Until then, she will continue to juggle extra duties and work up to 60 hours a week.

"Some days I feel it would have been nicer if Ms. Lilly had waited until after I retired," she said.

As I find myself and my work invoked below, I figure I'd better say something --
though many on this list will already know the facts of the matter --

Readers of my work know, as would anyone who looks at the listing of my books on
Amazon, which Kirby purports to have done, that it is simply not true that
that all of my books have race in the title -- and for that matter, one might
well pause over the assertion that an example of a book with race in the title
is "Black Chant" -- while books that address only the writings of white poets
are somehow seen as not being about race --  (come to think of it, is "The
White Goddess" a book with race in the title?)

and as to the question of this being the only discourse that is permissable -- I
sure wish that had been the case back when I was writing "Reading Race," a
volume which still gets me attacked fairly regularly --

Though, as an inhabitant of a field said not to exist, I suppose I should be
grateful that the scholarship I have fought to get into the academy is now,
apparently, the only permissable discourse -- Pretty good for a graduate of the
University of D.C., no?  Any suggestions on how I should deploy my suddennly
achieved powers?


often I am permitted to return to a field . . . .

Alan deserves a wide and smart audience, so it's encouraging to hear =
that he's doing some readings and attracting readers in the U.S. Over =
the years in NiZland his disciplined production, not only in making =
remarkable poems, but also in encouraging new writers and writing in the =
magazines he's edited and the fine quality books that he's produced, has =
held a number of us in thrall. But not as big a number as he deserves.

As one who's had some involvement in publishing Alan locally, I'd much =
like to encourage his being published and more widely read in the U.S.=20

While waiting for Mairead to put together a new group poem, I would like to read short poems on places for my new contest. I wish the last two lines of the poem were a lot better, but I am hoping this will inspire others by not setting the bar too high as I would if for instance I put in a poem by WCW
or Reznikoff.  I'd like to close the contest on December 13, a Saturday.  I was hoping the poems would be relatively short (under 15 lines) and based on real places.  At most two poems per poet.  If nobody else registers then I win.

of sight into the symbolism of lexis, like cymbals and kneck snapping
snares used by a selector Swift at the controls on this journey ? this
is how I was travelling while contemplating flow. This thought is
immediate. The elements of art and foreign flava in sonic epistle as a

make the set go boom; it moves the sight/seen mise en byme toons steppin

turntablists on cds. “What would you do if a viscous enemy suddenly
started comin at you armed to the teeth and ready to kill you? ...”a
little hard to ignore. (indeed) “There must be something unpalatable
about the comics to the female of the species.:. “I rented ‘Ghost Dog:
Way of the Samurai’ last night. Have you seen it? Don’t you think it
would make a good graphic novel?” S’all dope on plastics and paper; from
the flex of a wrist -- the pressure point of the pen on the paper to

space to the space btwn panels sincing details of signifiers into
samples of sounds to bites from life like “waiting on the corner” in
Victoria “with a pizza in one hand and campy horror movies in the
other’. Choppin from track to audio narrative to make “the panel of each
and every comic book a (...) statement” = “this is our day”. What’s’ the
definition of this kite on the tight light and shaded writs of Blend and
the crack choppin headshells of Rob Swift? “teenage boys”? “I can
remember just about every writer or artist that I’ve enjoyed since I was
a kid”; the motivation of surreality in the unreality of reality what is
the fluidity of the complexity of the audio comic panel soundtrack about
heads (hedz?) and lives in undisputable art for the knots come mental
bangers. Macluhan, Mclaren born from Tzara -- “all my competitors get

Having lived in Binghamton, I feel qualified to proclaim Kirby Olson the winner of his own contest without seeing the other entries. His entry paints that town in its best light. Binghamton's saving grace passed on with Milt Kessler.

I wish the last two lines of the poem were a lot better, but I am hoping this will inspire others by not setting the bar too high as I would if for instance I put in a poem by WCW
or Reznikoff. I'd like to close the contest on December 13, a Saturday. I was hoping the poems would be relatively short (under 15 lines) and based on real places. At most two poems per poet. If nobody else registers then I win.

Kirby,

Love your idea about short place poems.  Here's a couple for your contest.
One's about the wetland where I worked in San Francisco and the other is
about Santa Cruz.

best,

Francis


"Bayview Wetland"

(formerly pier 98
         and a little beyond)
Franciscan environs
South to San Bruno
North to Marin Headlands,

         In between, here we sing or swallow.

    The weeds The weeds!

95 percent of SF bay wetlands destroyed..
Bay also a third smaller.
Where did that water go?
Pushing it out, who pulled it in?

The poem of this place pulls in
not only weeds
but people, but people’s words.
How far does context roam in this place?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
"Coffee after a Sunburned Morning at the Beach"

There aren’t any public bathrooms
in this coffee house
in Santa Cruz.
What do they expect us to do
with all of that coffee?
And I am sure
that they have
an employee bathroom
in the back,
that’s not up to code
and smells.
But when I ask them
about the uncoded odorific pisshole
in back
they lie and cheat
about it
and ask me
if I’d like a refill.
And when I say
I don’t want one
unless they have a bathroom
they tell me
that I’ve sat
for the time
that a cup of coffee
buys me.
So, I walk next door
and jump into the bathroom
of a fancy hotel
which clearly says
it’s for customers only.
Luckily, next year,
they’re installing
seven portapotties
in Santa Cruz.

aldon's post hits the nail on the head... what problems i've
witnessed in terms of hiring and the like race-wise haven't turned on
candidates "playing the race card" (as some put it)... yes---i've
seen job candidates play up certain kinds of racial assumptions,
sure... but i can't blame them, generally speaking, b/c the core
problem, and what permits this to happen in the first place, is that
white faculty haven't sufficiently understood (i would rather write,
theorized) their own racial coordinates... and this leads to a
certain fetishizing of ostensibly "racial" attributes (i need to use
quotes here to suggest that the latter are no more or less racial
than are the attributes of those doing the fetishizing, as aldon
suggests)...

the only way to properly understand any of this, as i see it, is to
add other factors into the mix... e.g., most of the time
race/ethnicity as such is tacitly understood as a class marker... so
(to take my favorite subject, MYSELF, as an example) i'm often talked
about as "italian" by my colleagues when in fact what's really being
talked about is my working-class italian american-ness (e.g., i'm
"demonstrative," as some would say)... take the class out of me (as
if!) and you might be just as happy talking about me as an alsatian
american (1st generation on my mom's side, as a matter of fact, as
opposed to 2nd generation sicilian on my dad's... and i think i must
have posted the latter info to this list, what, a dozen times?---just
goes to show how important it is to my sense of identity)...

this reminds me btw of that absolutely asskicking essay cecil
giscombe contributed to ~telling it slant~---the one in which he
discusses the fugitive (from 60s tv) as a *black* guy...

the question really does have to do with perceived and actual
(institutional) power---and a profession that understands the extent
to which everyone is part of a racialized, class-based, gendered
(etc.) reality is a profession that better understands *how* the
playing field is not and never has been level... white
racializations/identities (note that plural, please!) are still far
more the measure (and means) of success than any other such "colored"
realities... interesting in this regard to note that latino
populations, from what i've read of late, are beginning gradually to
self-identify less frequently as caucasians, and more frequently as
any number of other ethnicities...

by way of saying, i think the academic profession needs to do a much
better job of appealing to inequities via a more sophisticated (and
less commodity-driven) *procedural* grasp of race/gender/class etc.
("diversity"... and don't even get me started on the sexed body stuff
that goes on under the rubric of hiring more women faculty)... bodies
matter, sure, but in the end, that kind of identity politics is a
piss-poor way of standing on principled ideological or ethical
ground, and only ends up staffing our courts with clarence thomas's
and sandra day o'connor's... i realize too that the very logic i'm
using to trouble basic identity politics can point in another
direction entirely---viz., that it's simply inappropriate to permit
identity to enter into the mix...

please not to associate me with the party of that part, whoever they may be...

one more thing, and at the risk of preaching to some choir:  if
you're a contemporary poet or a contemporary critic/scholar/theorist
of poetry, you need to have your head examined if you think that
aldon's writings are somehow peripheral to an understanding of u.s.
poetry... i don't mean to come off too strong here---and the same
could certainly be said of work by others on (and off) this
list---but i find aldon's oeuvre to date absolutely indispensable to
a discussion of what poetry is, what it could be, and (i'll go out on
a limb here) what it *should* be... and yeah, i consider aldon a
friend, and no, i'm not actually suggesting that anyone on this list
needs to have their head examined (esp. not after that thread on
"creativity and mental health," lordsakes!)...

my two cents' worth...

best,

joe

officially disabled and eminently qualified to teach 'disabled' poetry or
poetry of the mental illness/health challenged even though I'm tone-deaf
whcih is not considered a disability but I am willing to change my politics

A question from a lurker for those of you who are up on web ethics:

Is it acceptable for an online literary publication to link to a commercial website owned by a visual artist? Specifically, is this practice acceptable for the purpose of providing the readers of the literary publication access to visual work to which a poem in the literary publication alludes? On one hand it seems this could be interpreted as threatening to the visual artist, but on the other hand the visual artist does have the work on public display already.

Disclaimer--this is not a hypothetical question, and I am the poet in question, publisher and visual artist to remain anonymous for purposes of this query.

Thanks for any responses!

i don't know the ethics, we make this up as we go, I think, but it seems
that links are simply telling the reader the address of a site to go to. I
have never heard that giving out the location of a resource could be
unethical. Maybe I don't understand your question.

Joe, Jerrold, etc.

I didn't want to imply that race, gender and class are not in some ways very
important criteria.  I'm just saying that in many ways they seem to have become
the only criteria.  I'm a nobody in a backwater of academia, and so am perhaps not
as in touch with many of you regarding these finer points.  I don't know anybody
on this board -- although I met Maria when I was 19 one summer -- and haven't
heard of her again until I get on this board some six months ago. I was a
late-=blooming academic -- not returning to school until my mid-thirties, and have
only worked in America for about three years.

So if I brought up Aldon's books merely from the titles that's because that's all
that I have read.  The books sound more interesting, and I will try to read one
over the break.  He has read mine on Corso, he said, and I didn't think that
anybody at all had read it.  I am not even aware of many of the authors in this
field.  I started out writing about humor and humorists, and have only recently --
about three years ago -- decided to get more into poetry again.

In my very primitive anatomy of contemporary criticism -- I would say that there
were three canons when I went back to graduate school, and they all circled around
certain questions.

1.  The social work canon -- is it good for the "oppressed"?

2.  The aesthetic canon -- is it good for the art (this was the tail end of what I
have called elsewhere the classical liberals who got their start in the 60s and
70s)

3.  The postmodern canon (by this I mean Lyotard and Lyotardians and some
Deleuzians) who asked -- "Is it novel?"

As I saw it demographically the social work canon was sponsored by almost all of
the women (there were some Eastern European holdouts), and many of the younger men
(under 50).

The classical liberals were white men, principally, many of whom still wore ties
and suits.  The few women wore very nice dresses.

The postmodern group was really Steven Shaviro -- who was a funny brilliant nut
who wore T-Rex t-shirts and had green hair when I met him.  I extrapolated from
him that there were probably tiny groups of these academics elsewhere.  Very
experimental in their tastes, and with a sense of a drug counterculture that has
glued together a few circuits in fascinating new paradigms.  He was my favorite,
and the guy who guided me through graduate school.

I saw these questions the different groups asked as radically indifferent to one
another -- separate spheres, that created what Lyotard would have called a
differend (Robert Corbett brought him in yesterday) between the different groups.
As I have paid attention in my own rather lazy fashion, it seems to me that the
social work canonical question has triumphed, and driven out the other questions,
and people don't even remember other questions, or realize that other questions
might be put.

So, what other questions might be put of a poem?

1.  Is it funny?  (And the social work canon people would immediately say, "To
whom?"

2.  Is it perpetually interesting (Kant, Pound), and the s.w. canonizers would
immediately ask the same question -- to whom?

3.  Is it local (WCW, Olson)?

4.  Is it good for the environment (Snyder, Berry)

5.  Is it erotic-explosive (surrealists -- of whom there are still some in the
poetry world)?

6.  Is it good for the soul (there are a lot of Christian poets -- and there are
millions of these but often not in state schools -- who worry about that question)

So part of what I'm doing is trying to open up the questions that can be asked,
although I did say that not only are the race, gender and class criteria
important, they are seemingly all-important.

When we judge poetry we have a central question in mind.  The Poundians asked, is
it perpetually interesting.  Today, we tend to ask -- but is it good for the
oppressed (the hermaphrodite discussion turned on this).  The surrealists asked
whether it was Dionysian.

Are any other questions legitimate?  In the Soviet Union it was only asked -- is
this good for the proletariat?  And people who went against this and made art
considered useless, or had poetry along others lines went to Siberia.

Today I think a similar closure is happening to those who dare to ask other
questions.  I think this is bad.  I do think that the central questions of
oppression are central, but I also thnk the question has become oppressive, so I
am also asking what other questions can be put, if that's permitted?

When I read a poem I still think -- is it perpetually interesting?  For instance,
when I wrote on Corso it was because he had obsessed me for twenty years.  Part of
my own criteria of criticism remains somewhat in that older classical liberal
question (although the people who obsess me were not in that canon but are usually
very weird humorists, and people with at least one foot in a kind of Dionysian
surrealism).  I won't write about someone until they have obsessed me for at least
a decade.  I don't think I can write good criticism unless I am driven to go back
to a work (for whatever reason) repeatedly for at least that long.  It takes me
that long to open a work and get at least the gist of what's inside it so that I
feel acquainted with it to the point of having absorbed, and read all of the
criticism, and then can say something about a poet or a poetry that I find crucial
to me -- many times for reasons I don't really understand until I begin to explore
it as a critic.

At any rate, I am not trying to close down questions.  I am only trying to open a
few, if that's ok.  As I said, I'm a nobody, and have no influence at all, and
don't even know anybody in this field.  I hope people will continue to post places
poems, as I'm very drawn to that for whatever reason.  You could have white person
in ghetto poems, or males in the lingerie dept. poems, and bring in those issues
-- rich academic at blue collar party, or whatever, or a reverse of those, as
places ARE transected by those issues, some places more than others.  I am also
hoping that the poems are inherently fascinating -- of perpetual interest -- for
whatever reason -- that's the ones that I will be voting for in two weeks.

These are pretty short, so I have three.  The first is about Niagara Falls.


The Place Where I Grew Up

One stroke clouds
Starving artist trees
Electric cornfields
Pert green ponds
Majestic and pathetic
Once a city, now a town
*********************************
The second I wrote driving in my car home from my parent's house.

BFLO

A hundred beacons stretch before me
Past family wagons and barren green expanses
Toward beer bottle flower beds and vehicular bonsais
Crackled college radio becomes clearer
Through the bellies of steel whales
Down rain splashed dirty streets
Gas writhes in glass bars
As cocooned masses rush to escape a long winter’s chill
I am home
***********************************
The third is a true story, also in Buffalo.

Sunday Night at 10 O’clock

Stressed neon flits against
Cracked dirty asphalt
Chain smokers exchange confessions
In tinted SUVs
The underemployed grab tonight’s six-pack
As a middle aged man picks up a hooker in a rain streaked rabbit coat
I buy some chicken and roll into the night

People exchange links.  I've "invited" people to link.  Others have invited
themselves.  When I write article, I cite web sites, which isn't the same,
but if it happened to me, and I wasn't aware of the posting, then I would
contact them.  I think it depends on the situation.  Are they giving them
"free" advertising?  Is the site in any way misrepresenting them, etc.

This poem is dedicated to all who place gazetteer information on the web
so that we can produce accurate research results.



Bowmansville, NY

Bowmansville is located
on the banks of the Ellicott River.

Ellicott River? Ellicott Creek

Bowmansville is
named for Isalah Bowman

His name was Eli
He ran a frigging grist mill

Pop. 600
maybe well all right

Is everyone who lives in Bowmansville
blood-related I ask

No he says
New people are coming in all the time

Oh I say
Do they know they are coming to Bowmansville

Here's one about a little town in New Hampshire a little ways north of
Hanover on the Connecticut:

"Lyme, NH"

At the general store, you can buy cantaloupes
and tamed singing tigers with long, thin
whiskers flat against their muzzles.
The intown graveyard like the spiked
bottom of a running shoe.  The left cannon on the green
balanced now like a man on a high girder --
some elaborate show for the what in the belfry,
jump down.  In the library, the shelf for septic tanks bulges
like a grocery bag full of cans.
Each year, the platinum librarian considers expanding.
With so many hills,
the residents are always leaning.

This poem was written when I lived in Mt. Pleasant South Carolina, just
outside Charleston, on the edge of the marshland edging the harbor.
"Pluff" is the rich, black marsh mud famous in "the Lowcountry," tho the
word isn't in any of my dictionaries.

Steve

--

at edges

it comes into view at edges,
this bird knows how to read,
eats, perches in pluff, obscure
in shadow struggles, the worm,
out/side is in/side, like flip
& flop, heard you breathing,
plasm wriggle, across this
distance,       day unstops each
moment, a secret from the next,
a bounding line, jumps without
thickness,       vision held
in mist, looks askance
& fall into my own step,
step into my own fall

her brown and gurgling hill-born swill

Whether or not the task is the task is not certain. What it does put out

through. A snapshot. Little more.

The occasion warrants us. Living each word and coming through... coming out

Even as attentive as we can be as searchers, we're never mastering
positions.

Lester wants you to know he's not a sock puppet, though he does deeply appreciate the kind attention lavished on his perpetually unpublished book by Ron.

Lester's book is currently unavailable, though allegedly he is working on a movie deal in conjunction with Poetry Magazine.

I think Schwerner does not turn inside-out Lester, and Lester doesn't quite turn Schwerner inside-out.  If anything, Lester's concerns are quite similar.  Both works are fake fakes.  (of which there aren't many - I can only add to this list Barry MacSweeney's Postcards from hitler and Jack Spicer's After Lorca - please see Jacket #17 for further discussion: http://jacketmagazine.com/17/herron.html )

I would say that one major difference between Les and AS, since both are poetic series, is that Schwerner's diachronic approach is present-to-past while Lester's is future-to-present.  Both are concerned with the perceived authority of poetic language.  Lester's book plays with the immediate and imagined future in order to tap into the manipulative gestures of timelessness, while Schwerner's taps into the distant and imagined past in order to tap into the manipualtive getures of contemporary meaning.  (Maybe this is how they are in reverse?)  Neither Lester's future nor Schwerner's past ever happened or will happen.

Ron - I hope that all goes well with Krishna's procedure.  My thoughts are with you and your family.

The pantoum Ron quotes on the blog is in Selected Shorter Poems (Junction
Press: 1999,
142 pages), which is available from yours truly. Cover price is US$16 ($13
for list members) plus postage. It gathers poems from his difficult-to-find
books, as well as about a dozen poems never collected before. Armand made
the initial selection and allowed some additions and subtractions at my
request. We finished it a few months before his death. Many of the poems
are, in their very different way, as wonderful as the best of The Tablets.

The translations of Dante (he completed 12 cantos of the Inferno) with
incredibly generous notes, not only on Dante's text but on his translation
process, was published by Talisman in 2000, cover price $13.95. It's
brilliant. I don't know if it's still available but my guess is that it is.

I'm editing a posthumous volume, containing unpublished poems from all
periods in his career (about 150 pages) for publication in 2004 or 2005.
Armand was one of the small handful of US poets of his generation that I
think should be required reading.

"I've always believed everyone has more than one age, and I carry three ages within myself. When I was 20 I felt old and wise,
but now I feel like a child. There's an element of melancholy to this, because although I feel young in my heart, I know objectively that I'm not young. The second age I carry is my real age of 72, and every day I'm confronted with signs that remind me of it. The third age I carry -- and this is something I only feel in France -- is the age I was when I began to publish, which was 35. It's as if
I stopped at 35 in the cultural world where I work. Of course that's not true, because in many circles I'm considered an old, well-known professor who's published a lot. Nonetheless, I feel as though I'm a young writer who just started publishing, and people are saying, 'Well, he's promising.'"- Jacques Derrida.

Would that it were so simple. I might have added that the visual artist in
question is out of pocket, in the Canadian wilderness for several months.
Thus the reason for my question. I agree that hot-linking to specific images
is a no-no. The general tenor of responses seems to be that a simple URL
would be acceptable, though.

You wrote:

It's unclear exactly what you're describing. It almost sounds like it's not a "link" but a use of a HTML <img> tag to appropriate an online image into your own page (the sort of thing bloggers do all the time, for ex.). I'd say, if the image spontaneously appears inline on your poetry page with the poem, then it's certainly bad practice.

If, however, you simply provide a button or text link that directs the reader to the artist's page and lets her or him find the image in question -- that's might or might not be okay.

It would be bad if you are sending someone to an "inner" page on a site that the artist might not want users to jump to directly, particularly if it means they see the artist's work without encountering prefatory copyright or descriptive text first.

Of course, either way, I would urge you to contact the artist and get his or her blessing or permission.

Good luck,
Ron Henry, AUGHT

kirby, my experience with contemporary poetry in academe is that
there are generally only a few faculty (more than one can be rare)
who know, or care, anything about it... let alone register the number
of concerns/questions you indicate in your post (and i'm with you,
btw, as far as asking new/old questions)...

i think rasula's ~american poetry wax museum~ goes a helluva long way
to unpacking this unfortunate state of affairs...

but i don't see in any case why the emphases you outline are in any
sense mutually exclusive... one can want art to do any number of
things, yes?... that some scholars (let's just say) might be
insensitive to some kinds of questions, well---i'll grant that right
off... but creative writers, poets incl., are often equally
insensitive to other kinds of questions...

best,

joe

Actually, I don't think it's a problem at all. If the artist's work is
online and you link to it, she'll likely appreciate the new visitors you
send her way.

A link is a reference--like a footnote or other citation--for the reader to
follow for further information. As long as you don't actually post the
artist's work itself (for instance, by grabbing a jpg or gif of a painting
from the original site and reposting it on another), you should be in the
clear. What you're saying, basically, is "Hey, look at that!" and "that" is
already an approved use of the work.

As with most cases of permission, when something is clearly fair use--and
directing readers of your poem to the art about which you're writing
certainly doesn't infringe on the artist's copyright--it's best NOT to ask
permission. The Chicago Manual of Style recommends this approach to offline
writing, at least. Though the artist might appreciate knowing you've written
about her!

Here's Miami, Michael R.

------------------------------

GRASSHOPPER

                for Erika



Lately I fear I'll die, suddenly, at a critical time

In my career, outside of history



And she will know



I've always loved her

blighted palms, coral ruins



Blood-shapely artifacts, lightning

Pasted on black sky, high-rise hotels



Teeth in salt-worn jaw

clamped on a planetary skyline



Tragic city!

You love everyone but can't live with yourself



Dozing under clouded weight of a gray storm

Hammers pummel concrete

into limestone graves



There goes the ghost

of the man who was my doctor



Bouquets scream with summer's melting petals



                                        Miami

True Story

Cut-N-Shoot's a town in Texas
population one one five eight,
an hour north of Houston
and east a bit from Conroe.
The highway sometimes say "and"
but the citizens don't pronounce it.
"I'm gonna cut around the corner and
shoot back through them bushes
in a minute," a local boy remarked,
in the middle of a town-wide argument
about their choice of new church steeple,
or who should be the preacher,
or who owned the church's land,
or something like that.

and here is my current home. the oldest city in north america, St. John's,
Newfoundland.

The Foghorn

a mitten covered yawn
floats through the mist
attack watery decay
beats on my house
through my kitchen wall
that light from a church
inadequate blue guide
lost on the water
nautical disaster
breaking like a promise
on the radio
listened for the harbour
listening like sonar
searching for connections
my feet are cold on this kitchen floor
and the table is telling me stories
hearing the horn often
the rising and the falling
writing to this rhythm

Hi everyone,

I am a poet and editor of BlazeVOX2k3 and I dabble in Gastroenterology.
Right now I am looking for other poets and non-established medical
practioners to help with a paper on prolonged and inducible transgene
expression in the liver using gutless adenovirus as a possible therapy for
liver cancer. Any help would be wonderful.

Best, Geoffrey

I agree. Normal linking is by most people regarded as the same thing
as a reference in a book - the only exception (and I don't believe
this is a crucial difference) is that the very access to the
referenced work is much easier - it's a mouseclick away.

There is a movement nowadays among lawyers and others to
"criminalize" this kind of linking and force people to ask permission
for this. Or to permit linking to the start page but not "deep
linking" to pages further down in the site hierarchy. I personally
have always encouraged people to link and deep link to my pages (The
Art Bin Magazine I have tried for about eight years to preseve with
the same file structure in order not to make all the deep links out
there invalid). I think this is an essential quality in the web that
should be defended. Without links there wouldn't be any web. I never
understood why people appear on the web with their work in the first
place if they don't wish to get linked.

Using frames or "kidnapping" somebody else's image via an IMG tag to
one's own web page is as is said above a totally different matter.
Then you use another persons content for your own purposes out of the
original context. I suppose there could be cases were this borders on
the right to quote within the concept of fair use, but in most cases
it does not.

Here's a very old poem indeed about a suburb north of Chicago.=20

-Ravi=20

Lake Forest, Illinois =20
        For Sonya Sklaroff=20

The way was through the lawns and past the purr
of luxury sedans turning into
driveways gated by electronic eyes=20

and marble beasts. You spoke of how light steals=20
away each dawn which compels the brush=20
to sweep hue across the canvas, not to distill=20

the moment=92s sky=97it has already forgotten
how to look=97but rather, to satisfy=20
some twinge, the reason why you wake=20

at five each morning to paint. Overhearing=20
two mothers debate the merits of cash-
mere versus the pragmatism of wool,=20

we concluded that these suburbs were so safe
they were lethal. And then conversation
stopped; looming into the fog, without=20

an ocean=92s roar or salty slap, and down=20
a forested precipice was Lake Michigan:=20
vast, imbued and unfathomable.=20

you're also 'stealing' someone else's bandwidth in this instance...which is
a legal no-no...

One for Arizona from _What Of_:

Letter of Endearment #23

He died and went to Hell, but Hell wouldn't have him.  So he went to
Arizona where the standards are lower.  State with the highest per
capita of lavender R.V.'s outside Kuwait, Arizona is the national
birthplace of the twisted hardon.  Bases thick as rattlesnakes, it
bristles with pause, ham radio waves zazzing the peace like cactus
plants on steroids.  Arizona's sons and daughters bemoan the Ship of
State afloat upon the lacrymosian waters wrung from the national
conscience by the liberal press core while they lick each other all over
under there; they eat soft cheese and dream of luring multinationals to
a deep pocket luncheon, grab ass, group grope, gang bang covered by
Eyewitless News for a slot at six.  But the social and cultural blight
of that geography, Yuma to Four Corners, can only be cured by the
self-disembowelment of every man, woman, and child in the state.
Requiescat in seltzer.

CALGARY, AB or How Poetry Comes to Me

Like a young & wrested totality, mechanical
Bull how real is it, somebody wants to know, like

Oh, it's 1949 Twelve O'Clock High
Channels History, Aldon's nice guy-rope

Sort of Canada except "_so_ funny," roads north have a sense of
Paper Frank, tho I'm not writing you

Made peace with Vladimir -- how even is that, like
Bingeing Beats amping the night-

Lights (doctoral screenplays), words out
Like a shine dark gasoline, elbow

Somebody here leers sweetly
Never times seven, somebody's clever

Ad a Camus Klein worm in undies please
A ban on open sores abandoned, a Ralph band, a bust top, a puling rag

4 Lost Towns

        “I haven’t founded any towns, but frequently have
         trouble finding them.”
                              —Heilan Yvette Grimes

1.
Sadeville, Ohio (pop. 3417). Last seen heading for
Kansas. No visible means of support.

2.
Kronos, Maine (pop. 278). Perpetually wrapped in fog.
Unsighted from the mainland now for thirty years.

3.
Pennington, Virginia (pop. 5342). This Piedmont
town was raptured up to Heaven, September 21, 1974.

4.
Gruff, Vermont (pop. 178). A survey of 56,000 Vermont
farmers revealed you can’t get there from anywhere.

Howdy folks,

A former student of mine is planning on looking into "the knife as a metaphor
and symbol, both in literature and art" for a grad (art) paper. Care to suggest
some texts?  Of course cut-ups immediately occurred to me, and also the
Pound/WCW emphasis on cutting/precision.  But anything you can think of would
be appreciated back or front channel.

below is something by two canadian poets that i enjoyed while a teenager.

best,
david

---

Drivin' home this evening
I coulda sworn we had it all worked out
You had this boy believin'
Way beyond the shadow of a doubt

The I heard it on the street
I heard you mighta found somebody new
Well who is he baby - who is he
And tell me what he means to you

I took it all for granted
But how was I to know
That you'd be letting go

Now it cuts like a knife
But it feels so right
It cuts like a knife
But it feels so right

There's times I've 'bin mistaken
There's tines I thought I'd 'bin misunderstood
So wait a minute darlin'
Can't you see we did the best we could

This would be the first time
Things have gone astray
Now you've thrown it all away

Now it cuts like a knife
But it feels so right
It cuts like a knife
But it feels so right

These may be a little far afield, but doesn't Dickinson have a poem
with the line "the severed hand is an ugly thing"--or is that
Jeffers--and speaking of, if an ax counts, there is Jeffers' _The
Double Axe_ (and LOTS of his stuff), also Gary Snyder's "Ax Handles."

apollinaire's Zone ends with the brilliant "adieu soleil cou coup=E9,"
which is echoed ("soleil cou coup=E9") in the title of one of Aim=E9

A Chide's Alphabet Issue Three

at

http://www.chidesalphabet.org.uk

is now open to the public.

Its many angular, curvy, oblong or rhomboid delights include a Special (note
capital 's') feature on contemporary German language poetry (Germania and
Manuskripte) with 'Missing Bandwidths', an accompanying essay by Andrew
Duncan, poetry by Sheila Murphy, Philip Nikolayev, Tom Bell, Tim Allen (with
an extensive 'Duck'), Mark Weiss, Harriet Zinnes, Douglas Barbour, Peter
Riley, Robin Hamilton, Jill Jones, Angela Gardner, Pierre Joris, Chris
Jones, Dee Rimbaud, Jeff Harrison, Paul Croucher, Patrick Herron, extended
translations of poetry by Gregor Laschen and, from the Dutch, Nachoem
Wijnberg (translated by Andrew Duncan and Karlien van den Breukel). It
covers in all work from three continents, with too a short story by Jonathan
Taylor and prose from Paul Murphy and, last and of course least, as a sop to
editorial exhaustion, a sampler of David Bircumshaw's hyper-text prose or
poem 'The Ghost Machine', complete with an interview with a ghost and a
talkative bird with doubts about the Almighty and views on literary theory.

The German language poets in translation are: Thomas Gruber, Sabine Techel,
Hansjörg Schertenleib, Ulf Stolterfoht, Dorothea Grünzweig, Gerhard Falkner,
Peter Gosse, Günter Herburger, Heinz Czechowski, Jan Faktor, Max Gad,
Gerhard Ochs, Annette Brüggemann, Felix Philipp Ingold, Martina Huegli, JP
Jacobs, Paul Wühr, Ute Eitinger, Helwig Brunner and Laschen. All blunders
and bad wiring are courtesy the editor and views and credit belong to the
contributors.

Here is a place poem of mine under 15 lines
that appeared in House Organ:


------------

Living near the Ohio River



Water rises to its own level
they said meaning

leave
this location

these people
are low to the land.

Water people,
like the captains

of wooden cross-continental
ship voyages

who never learned to swim
so they’d drown quickly.

Be well

how interesting you feel this way about HOWL--perhaps
only your aesthetic response to it? or ethical
response to it?

i remember having huge arguments about why the third
section (and sometimes the second section too) is cut
from the poem when it is anthologized.

i mean wanting Carl Solomon to get better was the
whole point of the incantation wasn't it?

but i've read it and frequently go back to it. for wonder.

For those unfamiliar with my work, Chris Murray is offering generous samples

On a non-me local moment, very much recommend Lyn Hejinian's new book,

beautifully.

this gesture of knives
left behind rusting
in otherwise bare=20
country rooms
                         byzantium
the beginning of icons
relates me at once
to the sanction of your eyes
brown metal on brown floor
the homing of milk goats
tamper of small parallels
the contiguous spill
of tongues

here now I come upon it
as a maker of street songs
my own white on white collar
rolled into infinity

The Metaphorist


A self-involved forest asks
what the rabbit does
when the heart gets involved.
First, he makes some jet models
out of painted wood
a horizontal petrol engine.
Art is about craft: craft industry usually
comes from vending machines,
artist signed.  When the heart gets
looped, art gets the
hangman’s noose, tied from concrete.

The clean restrooms down the hall need flowers
and alphabets need capital
to have stems pull a loop tight around
the military message at the back of the photo.
There’s a real audience for plays on art.
A real pent-up demand for culture.  Self-defined?
A fine for casting multiple votes?  Thump,
thump.

Over a century ago, my small woollen mitt
could be cleaned without chemicals, but microbes
switch to Ultra-Low sulphur diesel cleaner.
Products relieve bottlenecks: Who needs ostranenie?
Sharp and contoured poo-poo and pee-pee.
Your belief system bright orange with fonts.

Can’t govern self?  Hegemony needs baby steps.
A chief contributor to global climate, The Metaphorist
has a tool pouch, with a
head screwdriver.  Let’s fund new school buses!
Queue some kids up!  How about self-defined
election cycles?  Nah,
an electron dance throws eyes in spirals.

Even the rabbit knows to fuck – see the bioenergy?
Exhibits of cardboard conceptions of love:
a global climate contributor.  A geothermal
pivot point at the gunwale.  Thump,
thumbs push heat to beat.  Wait,
flatten out any wrinkles using a sharp knife
will be afraid.  Poetry is an open-ended
envelope, paper side up.  Just before the canoe
hits the paddle, the water paddles itself.

The emperor could not have chosen a better subject
for the forest to discuss.  Whisper your own name
during periods of endearing juvenilia;
endearing trees to urea primarily
through the gills.  Decore for peak streamflow
re-enacts civil war.
Our base is a posterboard, so, yes,
appearance counts for marks.
Although there are rudimentary lungs,
breathing seeks hiccups.  A distraction
even cancerous tumors might like.

A convenience store with benchmarking for
petroleum marketers.  I envision a road
system that gambles an arm out the bus
window; I envision glitter!
Could I get a bottle of air out here?  Write coin on post-
it notes.  It’s current.  Our production
values straighten out with new scissors.

Like action, expression has perfect timing.
At best, our cities are far from perfect.
These cameras are a stand-in for police officers:
casting was perfect.  Everyone needs a job.
In a craft economy, poets craft metaphors,
similes, metonymies, underground sensor loops
at three intersections.  Pulse of the heart.
War societies preserve ancient cannons
in parks with plaques and lacquer.
A tree compares the cannon with itself: a cannon
is a cannon.  The New Literariness
invokes realism.  Two weavers are as good
as a metaphorist.  Wait, it could be reverse
facial gusts.  Bluster.  A bear and a balloon
help bees sell honey.

These gallery-like interiors
begin as a book of poems.  Sometimes I exaggerate
the budget.  One of our dinner choices was rent;
our table sets itself with forks
in the babbling stream.  Why can’t it shut up?
You need to see it.  You can’t do it and believe it.
A widget and some airplane model glue
can’t get caught huffing.  The emperor’s right
to re-write.  Chains re-right trees by the stream.

When the heart gets involved, do ears
lose symmetry.  Can they see
fuzz on TV or are they closer to pencils
and erasers.  Movement and balance in composition; sharp
wood arms on a chair.  Watch the freshly paved road;
a staged event is an event on a stage.  Page after page
of code.  Instructions for manufacturing an endtable.

A window overlooks a bank of ATM’s; I can breathe
through the sides of my neck.  The new science says
fantasy.  A breakfast nook inspired by Danielle Steel
and Louis Zukofsky.  A tree isn’t a tree
without these posters of trees I can hang
over my bed.  Vote for me!  Poetry will be
a national holiday.  Poetry will create jobs.
These trees can’t govern themselves.

Brian Kim Stefans is the author of Fashionable Noise: On Digital Poetics

JAI-LAI FOR AUTOCRATS on the ocassion of Stefans' talk/reading at Casper
Jones. Stefans writes numerous reviews, many of which can be found on his

*****************************************************************

SUE LANDERS is the author of 248 mgs., a panic picnic (O Books,
2003)

This book explores the emotional and socio-political lives of a cast of
characters based on autobiography, but devised by sound. Some characters
are the same character under different names. The book's claustrophobic
tercets combined with spiraling repetition help foreground the importance
of artifice and code, the very elements the book's characters undermine,
complicate, and expose. The code is a score. To sound out the story.

"This is a daring and contemporary voice that speaks of pills, guns, and
of shame. The story is captivating, the echoes of recurring themes and
stanzas are haunting: this book is a blast"--Anne Tardos.

She is also is co-editor of the magazine Pom2. She lives in Brooklyn.

After Miekal's odd find from the Viagra spam, I've been checking my spam
much more closely and have found, much to my surprise and delight, odd
August Highlandesque haiku-like 'poems' strategically placed right at the
bottom of the message (after about 10 lines of plain white space). These are
from a peculiar spammer from Hard to Treat Diseases Inc. Can anyone decipher
them?

The Institute of African-American Affairs at New York University

presents

The Legacy of Aimé Césaire:
Reflections on his 90th Anniversary
International Colloquium, December 4-6, 2003, New York City

"Ce que je veux c'est pour la faim universelle, la soif
universelle."

--Aimé Césaire
Aimé Césaire, who has been termed the father of African literature,
is 90 this year. This colloquium is the last in a series of
celebrations in his native Martinique as well as in France, Mali
and Switzerland. After 47 years as mayor of Fort de France and
representative of Martinique to the French National Assembly, Aimé
Césaire has put an end to his long and fruitful political career.
In his retirement, he remains a monument, an institution and a
symbol. His writings, be it prose or poetry, are a call
to revolt. They provide all of us with the miraculous weapons which
challenge the world of prejudice and allow the emergence of a new
history written by the wretched of the earth - the formerly
oppressed and silenced people. As he put it in his seminal
poem: "Return to My Native Land," he foresees the day when they
will be:

"Standing in the hold
Standing in the cabins
Standing on the deck
Standing in the wind,
Standing under the sun,
Standing in the blood,
Standing
And
Free."
--Aimé Césaire

I assume you have read Derrida's "Cogito and the History of Madness,"
collected in Writing and Difference.  Faucault's furious comeback accused Derrida of
practicing an insane logic, effectively labeling Derrida a madman and
thereby--inadvertently-- supporting Derrida's critique.  Best, Bill

Hey Bill,

The jury is still out on who won that little encounter.  For my money,
the title of Foucault's rebuttal, "My Body, This Paper, This Fire," is
much the more winning.

"Circumstance not existence made me" (with strings, 56)

The guillotine, Mike... But, on the knife specifically, it arguably begins a
new life - a modern one - in 1793 with the painting by Jacques-Louis David,
that is in the context of a Jacobin social imaginary, of Marat's
assassination ("Death of Marat"), displayed in Paris as part of the Ordre du
march of the day, same day as M. Antoinette's beheading. For TJ Clark, this
painting inaugurates the modern exactly because for the first time
"[c]ontingency enters the process of picturing. ... There is [now] no other
substance out of which paintings can be made - no givens, no matters and
subject-matters, no forms, no usable pasts". See first chapter of Farewell
to an Idea for analysis of this painting and its day of public exposition
(Yale UP, 1999). And the instrument by which the politics of contingency
enters aesthetics, say, is the knife.

Somebody asked about the prize for the contest.  It's bragging rights.  How
it will work is that all entrants get one vote, but the rule is that they
have to vote for somebody else.  We'll do that after the contest closes on
the 13th at midnight.

Votes will be taken on the 14th, and posted on the 15th.  You can vote
backchannel or front, but if you vote frontchannel, it would be fun if you
laid out your criteria.

there's a poem in Joshua Clover's collection, _Madonna Anno Domini_, that
takes up the conjunction Louis mentions (Marat, the knife)--can't remember
the title right now.....ah, "Bathtub Panopticon" I think...

Hi all. In response to the collborative or rather group poem about one's crying, I propose something 'physical': group sex. No, just kidding. (Well...) How about this. For anyone who is interested, I will send one sheet of very durable paper, and they can do what they like on it; but i'm stressing the fact that I want you to actually write draw TOUCH the paper and add yr own skinpoem top it. I will be collecting these in the future and binding them into a proper artists' book, as a relic of solidarity.

Please write me directly with an addie if yr interested. I'm hoping everyone will partake.

If anyone needs more details, write write.

Chris

i wake in the holograph


i wake in the holograph and storm to the computer i am ready for
conversion. the screen won't let me in. the program-net beckons. the
screen is flat like a door is flat. i think now i will never arrive. it
remains inert like the real is inert. i write in complete silence except
for the sound of 'type'. my hands tremble and are these words correct. my
life is a continuous correction. my life is a continuous erasure. i can
almost hear you. i can almost see you. there is something uncanny about
the flatness.:i am always in the state of erasure. my thoughts are in the
way of my thoughts. i continue to shudder. i i i i i you can never get
enough of it. jennifer helps on my left and nikuko on my right. why can't
i see everything upside down instead of left right reversed. nikuko and
jennifer double. it is said that everything has its counterpart which
devours it. what is not know that the devourer is also devoured by the
devoured. the world is lamina - animal not vertical lacitrev. :this flat
screen where i work alone. i collaborate badly. i bristle. my thoughts
infuriate me. when someone talks 'behind my back' they are in front of me.
my work is constantly signing off. today i thought today i shall surely
die. nothing happened but the need of codeine. emmett grogan was born on
my block. willie sutton lived down the street. grogan writes about sutton
and died young. i am always in the state of waiting.:there are lips
slightly parted and slightly drawn:there are lips and curtains drawn there
are flat worlds


Does this flat screen where i work alone. i collaborate badly. i bristle.
my thoughts infuriate me. when someone talks 'behind my back' they are in
front of me. my work is constantly signing off. today i thought today i
shall surely die. nothing happened but the need of codeine. emmett grogan
was born on my block. willie sutton lived down the street. grogan writes
about sutton and died young. i am always in the state of waiting. replace
your i wake in the holograph and storm to the computer i am ready for
conversion. the screen won't let me in. the program-net beckons. the
screen is flat like a door is flat. i think now i will never arrive. it
remains inert like the real is inert. i write in complete silence except
for the sound of 'type'. my hands tremble and are these words correct. my
life is a continuous correction. my life is a continuous erasure. i can
almost hear you. i can almost see you. there is something uncanny about
the flatness.?


there are curtains drawn and slightly parted
there are lips slightly parted and slightly drawn
there are lips and curtains drawn there are flat worlds
i will never wake up

One of my favs is that very early dylan

something like

a lot of people don't have much food on their table
but they got a lot of KNIVES and forks
and they gotta cut something

(i love the way the 2nd, and especially the 3rd, line,
changes what one might be inclined to think he means at first in the first
line)


then there's this:

we could sit in darkness
in a theatre spotted with our lives
or be naive as food that's sick
of trying not to eat the knife

Chris - Can I make a suggestion? Though it would be a greater financial
commitment of postage and paper, that this great idea would be a greater act
of collaborative solidarity, if all participants were to receive their own
unique copy. You could short cut your paper and postage expense, by giving
the specs on the size of the sheet, and maybe the weight of the paper stock
(or unacceptable stock as non-acid free paper), and give people the freedom
of choosing appropriate colors, weights etc.  and letting people send you
their finished works. It would also create much variation in the variety of
input, which is always fun.

To protect your expenses, I would do an edition of 55 copies. Over the years
you could sell your additional copies to dealers, with the additional
pleasure of knowing contributors had each received and enjoyed one.

On this level, I would happily participate.

An old hand at most imaginable limited editions - collaborative and singular
- produced by and for poets (and poetry). And sensitive, bruised and happily
otherwise, by all related issues.

Stephen Vincent

my question is is this like "assembling" and we should make, oh, 50
copies, or should it be reproducible? or ...

Entertainment is all about history
maintenance is a way of life
the victim is cited by new victims
patent is bleeding us dry

entertainment is currently in progress
maintenance is starting to thrive in Athens
the victim is ignored in the calculation
patent is more prone to failure than flying

entertainment is essential for good yield
maintenance is king of form
the victim is published
patent is a sort of bra

entertainment is due
maintenance is exclusive
the victim is declared invalid
patent is in twilight

entertainment is omen
maintenance is a jungle
the victim is shaky
patent is why I'm here

entertainment is optional in developing countries
maintenance is as cheap as reading
the victims are coming
patent is a plea

entertainment is certainly not the response
maintenance is the key to local success
the victim is strong
patent is a child

entertainment is thinking about you
maintenance is making a statement
the victim is now being validated in Europe
patent is 14 years old or less

entertainment is not a department
maintenance is accumulated in all things
the first victim was the victim of untethered biocracy
patents are stigmatizing

A fool tried to sweat me acting like he was hard,
I stuck him twice in the neck, left him dead in the yard.

It was smooth how I did it, cause nobody could see it,
with my jacket on my arm, & my knife on the side of me.

Chris, That's "Talkin New York Blues" from his first, self-titled album.  I
think it's "forks and knives" not "knives and forks" but any-hoo - great song:
"You sound like a hillbilly.  We want folk singers here."  And "Headed out for
western skies...so long New York. Howdy East Orange."

Let's not overlook Norman Mailer's tender insight from 1962:



"So long as you use a knife, there's still some love left."



I understand the point, but disapprove of the practice. Pillow fights are
more fun.

Paul LaFarge and Frances Richard

Paul LaFarge is the author of two novels, The Artist of the Missing (1999)
and Haussmann, or the Distinction (2001). He received a Guggenheim
Fellowship in 2002 and is currently working on his third novel, about flyin=
g
machines and the weather. He lives out of his car. Frances Richard is
nonfiction editor of Fence, a member of the editorial team at Cabinet, and =
a
frequent contributor to Artforum. Her first book of poems, See Through, is

Fanny Howe and John Wilkinson

California Press), One Crossed Out (Graywolf), and Saving History and Nod
(Sun & Moon). She has won a Lenore Marshall Award (2000), the Commonwealth
of California Award, two National Poetry Foundation Awards, the American
Book Award for fiction and two NEAs. She is currently teaching at the New
School. John Wilkinson is a British poet associated with the =B3Cambridge
school=B2 of writers, whose work he has recklessly contrasted with US
=B3Language=B2 writing as having no outside where typically theirs has no
inside. Consistently with this comment, his poetry is made of a dense lyric
fabric and is gathered in four substantial volumes: Oort's Cloud: Earlier
Poems (Barque and subpress, 1999), Flung Clear: Poems in Six Books
(Parataxis Editions, 1994), Effigies Against the Light (Salt, 2001), and th=

works in London for the National Health Service. He is currently nearing th=
e
end of a year in New York as a Fulbright Scholar at the Center for the Stud=

of Issues in Public Mental Health, where he is studying theories of risk an=
d
their application.=20

The rules aren't clear to me.  If the topic is group sex, I'm out.  Is
there an address you're supposed to send 50 copies of something to?
What does it mean that skin is to be touched or something.  Personally
signed?  Did this imply that a drawing was to be made?  50 drawings?  Or
one drawing, plus a poem, and then xeroxed, and then hand-signed?  I'm
new at this, and should probably just stay out of it.

Subject:      configuration
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII

configuration

configuration is pure thought. it's the alignment of abstraction and
ideology with machinery. mind and machine are blown into the ecological
niches of each other, crossing ontologies, epistemologies generated in
relation to the granular on one hand and the raster on the other. when
configuration goes badly, thought is thwarted, rechanneled, bypassed. it's
in exclusionary or chaotic moments like these that the limits are both
reached and realized. the future is already crossing borders,
transgressing the present.

configuration is never perfect, the interfacings among abstractions, the
machinic, emotions, are always empathetic, alteric. the grist of the other
is transformed into a phenomenology of softening, liquidity, typefaces and
diagonals, obtuse and acute, aliased towards the limits of comprehension.

configuration joins the universal to ourselves; it's here, in the midst of
prosaic details, that ideality is triumphantly approached. the slightest
gesture opens realms of articulated thought, and what was unravelled
appears part and parcel, once again, of the unravelling earth.

In Syracuse, NY, Federal Express no longer has any competition.  But
not the package delivery system, where there are formidable rivals
such as United Parcel Service.  No, we're talking about copyright
infringement.  It seems FedEx has triumphed in its three-year battle
against a local coffee shop.

First, the shop called itself Federal Espresso.  Agreeing to change,
the owners then came up with Ex-Federal Expresso.  The shipping giant
still wasn't amused.  Now the two have reached a settlement, and the
java business has adopted the name Freedom of Espresso.

Maria:

I can see when a name can be misidentified, but don't see this with Federal
Expresso, which sounds like a Mexican coffee bean joint. But these
corporations have lawyers who think they must earn their keep, and thus
pursue such cases as this.
 I love the "shipping giant," which is almost mythological. "One day a titan
named FedEX..."

Been staying in because of the snow?  Tired of hibernating?  Then come to the party!

Opening reception:
Sunday, December 7 from 6 - 9 PM

on the Lower East Side)
New York, NY 10002

Performances starting around 7pm by:

Wanda Phipps, Carl Watson, Marc Sloan, Jim Feast, Merry Fortune,
Kristan Ryan, Steve Dalachinsky, John Farris, and Howie Solo

The FusionArts Museum is the only space in New York City that is
dedicated to showing fusion art exclusively: the technique of melding
or fusing different art disciplines into another art form. Like the previous exhibit
 Transfusion,  this show will open the doors to an array of international artists
all of whom are  transfusing  the old into the new, all of whom understand that
the future of art, be it politically, socially, economically, physically and/or
intellectually is in the generation of hybrids which allows for endless creative
artistic possibilities. In essence, the future of art is in fusion.

Hi Kazim,

Maybe I just don't buy the whole premise of the poem that there is a
monstrous Moloch stalking Allen and all his pals.  What killed Kerouac
or Neal Cassady?  Booze, self-inflicted, in the first case, and speed,
self-inflicted, in the second.  I get tired of this idea that there is a
massive state gobbling people up.  I used to be interested in anarchism,
and perhaps the idea of mutual aid still seems to me to be the ruling
principle.  I see this everywhere.  I just don't think that the world is
so competitive and beastly as others do, and so I find Ginsberg's resort
to this old gnostic notion gets on my nerves.  Even between races,
classes, and genders I see mostly mutual aid and mutual appreciation
much more than the violent competition others attribute to these
supposedly Manichean dividing lines.  Or perhaps that's just my
experience?  Even in Iraq with whom we are supposedly at war we can see
this spirit of mutual aid everywhere -- the guy who chose to save
Jessica Lynch is just one part of that unfolding story.  It's not really
human to want to hurt other people so it's a very rare freak that
indulges in it.  I was saying this to a class the other day when they
were asking me about how I felt about the war, and I was saying that
it's just a way to make things exciting to create a war.  It's not
natural though.  We'll end up being friends with the Iraquis, just as we
are friends now with the Vietnamese.  Everything always ends up as
friendship.  It's almost disappointing as it seems to lack drama, but it
is a basic human law.  So they said what about NYC (they're mostly from
there) and they said, let's watch Gangs of NY.  So we did, and I did
research on the film.  Bill the Butcher never existed (there was a guy
named William Poole who it's based on, but he never killed anybody) and
so on.  It's just a way to sell tickets -- same as sports.  After the
game everybody is friends again.

Carl Solomon ended up working in a bookstore in Grand Central Station.
He may still be working there.  He's fine.

I think Solomon wanted his name out of the text because he was tired of
the freak show.  That's what I think he said once at Naropa.

He was just fine.

Ginsberg's hysteria is just too much for me.

Hi all.


I am working on a project in which I want to look at 20th century
representations of Emily Dickinson in art and poetry. So many poets, from
Hart Crane to Susan Howe have written poems about Miss D and many visual
artist have also done representations of her or with her work (Leslie Dill
for example)


I am asking this knowledgeable group to send me any references to poems or
artist that they can think of so I can look up their work!


thanks for your time--

Mike & All,

Just came across this from Artaud:

"I seek to isolate those discoveries which lucid reason does not
provide.  I surrender to the fever of dreams, but only in order to
derive from them new laws.  I seek multiplication, subtlety, the
intellectual eye in delirium, not rash vaticination.  There is a knife
which I do not forget.

    But it is a knife which is halfway into dreams, which I keep inside
myself, which I do not allow to come to the frontier of the lucid
senses."
A. Artaud, "Manifesto in Clear Language," 1925

hooks up nicely with this, from "The Theater and Its Double":

"In the state of degeneracy in which we live, it is through the skin
that metaphysics will be made to reenter our minds."

Look out, Jackson--Antonin's packin'.  Off to find my fork ...

Dear Julie,

Here's something I published 20 years ago!


Defector

The year that Mr. Lincoln died --
You wrote almost one Poem a Day --
Winnowed the Groans the Wounded made --
Selected your own Society.

You nursed some Trifle in your Soul --
Some Hurt too small to justify --
Impatient -- pallid -- punctual --
It wrung your cramped Garrulity

And -- Page after Page -- delinquent Years --
Your Self behind your Self -- possessed.
You weighed the World the Others wore --
You felt God fumbling at your Breast --

Until the opening of a Door
Silenced the Angel in your Bed --
A dot upon a shrinking Sphere
Marring the Page your white Sheet made.

The War, for all you knew, was fought
By buzzing Flies -- on Window Panes!
Consummate Civilian -- yet -- in Death --
You skulk behind the opposing Lines.

It has most recently been published in This Old Man Reclines on the Field of
Heaven: Poems 1979-2000 by Exile Editions in Toronto.

Best wishes,
Don Summerhayes

Kirby:

It was written during the 1950s, of which these days of Terrorist paranoia,
instead of Communist paranoia, Ashcroft instead of McCarthy, remind me. So
maybe Howl actually is still relevant!
 But you're right about self-inflicted wounds. I'm not for that, although an
artist must have a degree of madness, must be able to take emotional and
physical, as well as aesthetic, risks, which the best of the Beats did, and
is sadly lacking in these tenure-oriented times.
But I like your thought that "Everything always ends up in friendship." So
why do we have to go through the steps of killing people first? Why can't we
go directly to friendship? Something like this was on Allan's mind during
his latter years. There was a life after Howl.

This poem is rather misleading.  I don't think E.D. ever got published
with idiosyncrasies intact during her lifetime, and certainly all the
"early" book publications re-punctuated and generally scrubbed up the
work.  Only relatively recently have we had editions that attempt to be
more faithful to the manuscripts.

The film touches on some of the impossibility of making a "traditional" =
documentary about E.D., and the filmmaker does a nice job tracking down =
some of the more eccentric homage to her life and writing.  It played =
locally in Providence - perhaps Mike Magee saw it also?

This:

Knife

I was out one night
acrawling and acreeping.
I spied a fair maiden
asnoring and asleeping.
Just lay your leg over me, do.
Says I, "My pretty monarch,
I'll come to bed to you."
She snored, and replied,
"Just come to bed to me,
and lay your leg over me do."
"Your drawers are so tight
that I can not undo them."
She snored, and replied,
"Then take a knife to them.
Just lay your leg over me, do."
"I haven't owned a knife
since I can remember."
She snored, and replied,
"There's a knife in the window.
Just lay your leg over me, do."
The knife was got down
and the drawers was cut under,
and then they went at it
like alightning and athunder
and alay your leg over me, do.
In about nine months,
this maid fell aweeping,
and then she remembered
the snoring and the creeping
and the "Lay your leg over me, do."
The babe it was born.
It was an awful wonder
that it wasn't killed
by the lightning and the thunder
and the "Lay your leg over me, do."

From Vance Randolph's ROLL ME IN YOUR ARMS, a collection of "unprintable" folk
songs from the Ozarks, edited by Gershon Legman (University of Arkansas Press,
1992)

I first heard the song on my friends' album, SPINE. Check out the band

Buenos noches Senores y Senoras. Bienvenidos.

Well, let's see. My guess is that a pineapple is more macho than a

Si! Correcto! Pineapple es mas macho que knife.

Barbara Penn (see <http://web.cfa.arizona.edu/people/bio.php?bio=160> did
an installation piece, maybe more than one, with representations of
Dickinson's work. Some of that work was in a group exhibition in 1997
titled Language as Object: Emily Dickinson and Contemporary Visual Art, at
Mead Art Museum, Amherst, MA -- so you might contact that museum and see if
you can find other artists who had work in that show.

I suggest Susan Howe's book "The Birth-mark" as a very
interesting look at the editorial work of Mr.
Franklin--while he did exhaustive and brilliant work
in reordering the poems and returning fragments to
pages by matches stationery types, doing deep
handwriting analysis, and comparing water-marks,
placement of rough-edges etc to try to recreate
fascicle order (the booklets were mostly cut apart,
and re-ordered by the various camps of editors), he
still refutes Howe's notion that Dickinson's lineation
was intentional, and that the marks on Dickinson's
manuscript should be read visually--they are also not
merely long uniformly sized dashes, often plus marks,
slanted dashes, periods in the middle of sentences,
etc--

Howe reproduces some manuscript pages in the article,
which if memory serves, is called "Flame Generosities"
(part of this work is linked at the Howe page at EPC),
but one comes away from article thinking only to find
the actual Manuscript Book facsimiles that Franklin
put out several years ago: it does not contain all of
the Dickinson poems, but is better than even the
Franklin varorium (did I spell that right?) as that
regularizes lineation also--

Perhaps, Julie, the most radical and subversive
"representation" you could do of Dickinson would be to
include in your project Dickinson herself: in her own
handwriting, her own poems, own self--

Please share more information as you continue working:
it sounds very very interesting; best of luck with it,

Kazim

THEEE strangest thing I ever saw in this vein was a self-help tape, by
Marion Woodman, called "Emily Dickinson and the Demon Lover."  Strangest
reading of Dickinson EVER.  The helper's voice, reading several Dickisnon
poems (Johnson edition versions!), shudders in a way I can only say seems
maybe creepy, but may be almost campy.

Ever wonder why you want to shut yourself away and just quit?  This tape
may be for you!

The documentary that somebody mentioned, _Loaded Gun_, was a great success
with my class earlier this semester. One highlight is the tatoo of ED that
Philip Jenks has across his entire back. The same class had to visit an
exhibit by Leslie Dill, a contemporary artist who uses lines from Dickinson
throughout her work, such as a dress with the poetry lines running through
the seams.

Also check out Elaine Equi's poem, "The Movie Version." Here are the first
two stanzas:

I was reading Emily Dickinson
when suddenly her poem begins speaking
in the voice of Mia Farrow--a young Mia
as she was in _Rosemary's Baby_

recites: "Heart! We will forget him!
You and I--tonight!" with resolution
in her strange faux English accent
as if she were speaking about Frank Sinatra...

(from _The Cloud of Unknowable Things_, Coffee House, 2003)

Hi Julie, here's one I did for a celebration. Each of us was given
one of her recipes to bake/bring to a reading (Orono, Maine). This
appeared in Codrescue's Exquisite Corpse way back when it was on
paper.

For Emily Dickinson, The Centennial of her Death

                To make a cake
                according to her recipe
                you have to break
                a fresh coconut.
                First, though,
                you have to
                drive a spike
                through its eyes.
                It isn't easy.
                It has the face
                of a baby fur seal
                and when the spike
                pierces the eyes
                it weeps,
                leaving wet trails
                across the dry brown fur.
                You must not slip
                or lose your nerve--
                you need a cupful
                of this liquid
                for the cake.
                To steady your hand,
                think of the many times
                she must have
                filled the cup with tears,
                and turned away to bake.

If it's really Open Knife Season, I would like to dust off my very
favorite, from Neruda's "Walking Around." I think it's from 1931 or '32:

Sin embargo ser=EDa delicioso
asustar a un notario con un lirio cortado
o dar muerte a una monja con un golpe de oreja.
Ser=EDa bello
ir por las calles con un cuchillo verde
y dando gritos hasta morir de fr=EDo.

"Nevertheless it would be a delight
to menace a notary with a single cut lily
or bring death to a nun with one blow to her ear.
How lovely
to go through the streets raising shouts and a green knife
until I am frozen to death."

The question, Kirby, is friendships on what terms?  Yes, we are friends
with Vietnam, but that took years, and only after their economy came to a
grinding halt.  The problem is that the US never wants friendships of
equality, but only of subordination.  Less the French & the English, more
the Russians and their ex-satellites.

If this country is predominated by the notion of mutual aid, why have we
since the 19th century tried to manage the politics of Central and South
America?  Why haven't we even tried to resolve our conflict with Cuba,
which surely would evolve back into a US friendly, but distinctly other
nation if we would simply stop the embargo.  Mind you, the rest of the
international community isn't unhappy about our intransigence.  And if the
reason is principally anti-communist or anti-totalitarian, then why we do
we curry favor with China is not yet capitalist and remains authoritarian?
Is it because international politics can only be carried out in a
hobbesian manner?  Then what does this say about domestic relations?  And
yet there have been massive movements where mutual aid, trust, and support
were the mechanisms.  I know some on this list will dismiss the Marshall
Plan, but compare it to what is happening now, where we are acting like
Israel with its occupied territories.

We don't live in a hobbesian world.  A hobbesian world is where mutual aid
only occurs because of fear of the other.  This is the "natural" state,
and the explanation for how culture arises out of violence.  But it seems
to me wrong.  Rousseau's depiction of the natural state is far more
accurate, if there was such an ontological entity.  We would simply walk
around in our solitude and only solicit attention when we needed to
reproduce out of some unfathomable imperative.  We only have love,
culture, buildings, even capitalism, because we can trust each other and
depend on each other at least some of the time.  Yet our leaders either
believe we live in a hobbesian world, or want us to believe we do, the
better to hold on to power. I believe that acting in the international
sphere as if it was hobbesian has been what has brought this time about.

The idea that the Iraquis will be our friends is naive.  The Arab world
doesn't particularly like its former colonial powers, England and France.
Africans don't like the British particularly.  In the US we can point to
our internal colonies, or even to Canada.  If you want to be world power
one, you don't have friends.  Of course, many of these cultures are
hospitable, generous, even forgiving of the US, but that is simply what
older cultures do.  After enough fighting, you realize that there are
better things to do.  But don't mistake it for friendship.

Let's hope that the trauma that has created this time will the put the US
on a steep learning curve once we realize the source of the anger.  We're
certainly not all bad.  But we are young.  And I mean young in terms of
culture, not in something relatively ephemeral such as a political system.

best,
Robert

When my daughter Mischa was a child I would offer to pay her to read
challenging books and talk about them with me.  It was low key and fun.  An excuse to
talk about things together.  And it helped her, I think, to think and feel
confident--to extend herself a little.

Anyway, she's working on a doctorate in political science now and recently
asked me for a list of 20 "literary" books that I think everyone should read.  A
pretty challenging request, really.  My answers would vary over time.  Here,
though, is the list as it stands now:

1. If Not, Winter: Fragments of Sappho by Anne Carson
2. Tender Buttons by Gertrude Stein
3. Collected Fictions of Jorge Luis Borges
4. Any book of poems by Paul Celan
5. Remembrance of Things Past by Marcel Proust
6. Emerson's Essays
7. Collected Poems of Robert Creeley
8. My Life by Lyn Hejinian
9. Ulysses by James Joyce
10. My Emily Dickinson by Susan Howe
11.Letter to His Father by Kafka
12. The Divine Comedy by Dante
13. Ketjak by Ron Silliman
14. Walden by Thoreau
15. Reading Rilke by William H. Gass
16. Watt by Samuel Beckett
17. The Pleasures of the Text by Roland Barthes
18.  Collected Works by Lorine Niedecker
19.  Steal Away by C.D. Wright
20. Oracle Night by Paul Auster

Of course, I post this with all sorts of misgivings for what's not included.
But these are definitely 20 books I could not have done without.

There are a lot of Corso poems with allusions to Emily D.  Especially in the
first two volumes.  It's an odd poet for him to become enraptured by, but he
was.  The Boston period -- and the poems in Vestal Lady on Brattle -- have a lot
of allusions to Emily D.  But even in the last poems he sometimes will allude to
her in a line or two.  I wondered about this briefly in my book but not knowing
Dickinson's work to the ground didn't want to make a mess of it, and had other
fish to fry.  In Michael Skau's book on Corso he guesses that the prison library
at Danemora Prison where Corso was ensconced in the forties must have had a
Dickinson book on its tiny library shelf.  Still -- it really stuck with him,
and nobody's ever mentioned it in the criticism except in passing.  In his poem
Columbia U. Reading -- there are four lines from an Emily D. poem cited -- see
Skau p. 159.  I can't remember all the places Corso cites her or alludes to her,
and didn't take notes on this.

Joel,

Allen's later years are the Buddhist ones, and I suppose the Dalai Lama when he
talks about all hostility being based on igorance is one answer.  But what do
you do with an unbearably ignorant person like Charles Manson, or Adolf Hitler?
Or even the communist Chinese who have taken over Tibet and killed hundreds of
thousands, and go on doing so.  The DL just wants to wait and see, and smile a
lot.  He doesn't want to get his hands dirty.

It's very hard to understand what to do and on what basis, but somethng has to
be done. George Bush has said that his political hero is Jesus Christ.  I think
this is a major mistake.  Christ is God.  To act as he would act is not within
our capability -- our actions are always tainted by selfishness, and blindness.
And we can't clean up the world -- Christ even says we should not try because we
are so silly that we will just make a mess of it.  HE says this by implication
in the parable about the separation of wheat and chaff.  It's not really within
our power to understand, and he says when we try to do it we'll just kill the
whole harvest.

There is something in this, but I don't think you can just let Manson run free
either.  Or Adolf.

In some ways hatred does seem to be based on illusion.  I lived in France for a
long spell and frequently visit and usually the French start off hating me
because I'm an American but then it turns out I know their literature as well as
they do, and can speak French, and slowly they start to like me, and then invite
me for dinner, and then we're friends.

I can't believe that the same thing is not happening in Iraq.  Most people just
naturally want to be friends.  It's the norm.  There are freaks who try to do
depressing things but they're freaks.  There is another curious paradox -- even
people who are completely evil never seem to realize this.  I think that
everybody believes that they are good, and that what they are doing is good.
Even Manson must have felt this when he ordered the hit on Sharon Tate and co.
He felt that they deserved it because they were capitalists, or because they had
scorned him in an orgy (I read this somewhere).

My answers for these things all come from within Lutheranism, and the two
kingdoms doctrine, but the Buddhist ones are more palatable in present company.
So we'll leave it at illusion.

I do think Bush has gone too far with his hasty attack, and that our alliances
are stretched pretty thin.  But there is no country that is without evil.  Even
the charming French with their blistering attack on the Rainbow Warrior.  The
French still have a powerful security apparatus which occasionally will react
very destructively -- there are all kinds of dark secrets within the French
nation -- even though they are currently posing as a yogurt company.  There was
a charming actress named Pauline Laffont who had worked as a prostitute in the
French diplomatic service, but when she told about this in an interview she
ended up dead in a forest two days later. If you live in France, or in Finland,
you see things like this all the time in the newspaper.

So my belief in ultimate friendship is tempered with paranoia and terror.  I'm
just talking about what Burroughs used to call the loooooooooonnnnng view.

And maybe he and the Dalai Lama had something in common there in that they had a
lot of patience.

I don't know any short cuts.  This kingdom runs on an animal basis, and is
different from the next.  I draw on the next one in hope that it will have the
universal love that is promised.  At the same time, I am afraid I will find the
next one a little dull by comparison to this.

the publication of:

THE ESCAPE
by Jo Ann Wasserman


Thursday, December 11, 2003
7:00 P.M., FREE

Teachers & Writers Collaborative
5 Union Square West, 7th Floor, NYC
(between 14th and 15th Sts.)

with readings by Wasserman, Brenda Coultas, David Cameron & Gillian
McCain
& Wine and cheese reception.


"In these brilliant sestinas of assemblage and their tenuous enkomion
asides, the reader is taken/taking place, as if in detailed alignment
with the poet-family footage scattered over the floor and glued back
warily as Wasserman constructs her map of escape from that loving
tyranny.  An extraordinary first book in which every utterance is
compelled by the imagination's fleeing from the known."
- Kathleen Fraser

"The Escape is a kinetic maelstrom in which Wasserman's attention is
always laconic and precise...a calmly breathless, run-on sentence that
gathers information at every instant, while careening downhill...prose
where diary and fiction slip around each other...a music that is
intoxicating and unmistakable in its honoring of the turbulence of
being alive in the not so distant present, past and future."
- John Yau

"There is much at stake in this book: 'motherhood, fortune, providence,
the stars and then depression...the false Italy' or false anything vs.
a real me or you.  This book is 'round, soft, sad, expensive,
pink'...it is also dark, sharp-limbed, heart-wrenching, hilarious and
smart.  Kafka once declared ' A book must be the axe for the frozen sea
within us.' In form and in content, this is one of the bravest books of
poetry I've read."
- Eleni Sikelianos

JO ANN WASSERMAN is the author  of two chapbooks of poetry "What Counts
As Proof (Sugarbooks) and "We Build Mountains" (a+bend press).  Her
work has appeared in The World, Grand Street, can we have our ball
back? and The East Village.  She is the former Managing Editor of How2,
an online journal of innovative writing by women, and former Program
Coordinator at The Poetry Project at St. Mark's Church. She recently
earned an M.F.A. in poetics from the New College of California and
currently lives in New York City where she works for Granary Books.

The Escape is book #3 in the Futurepoem series, selected by 2002/03
editors Brenda Coultas, Anselm Berrigan, Laird Hunt and Dan Machlin.

Futurepoem is supported in part by grants from The New York State
Council on the Arts Literature Program, The New York Community Trust

...and how odd Ian Fraser has always been the head man in charge of
harassing me and my dog (who is pure-bred) and trying to take him away
from me.  He who has harassed me to the point where I can't enjoy
walking with my buddy like I use to. people ask where he is (they are so

use to see us together) but Ian Fraser has shown a far too close and
threatening interest and our lives. I've said this earlier that I got
more of the impression that he wanted the dog for other reasons was
trying to figure out ways to get him from me. This time using the CRD
position to get him.

well read on to the latest news

Ian Fraser -- New Victoria Poundkeeper

After a secret meeting last Thursday morning, Victoria City Council made

it public that it has decided to give the Victoria dog management/animal

control/enforcement contract to Ian Fraser -- a well-known CRD Bylaw
Enforcement officer operating in Victoria. The three year contract will
provide for Ian Fraser's company, which he's calling Victoria Animal
Control Services, to operate a pound out of a notorious pet store on
David Street called 'All Creatures Great and Small'.  The pet store's
speciality are so-called 'exotic' animals -- though they also sell
'bred' puppies and kittens.  Conflict of interest??

Some of you may have had some experiences with Ian Fraser or may have an

opinion about this move, questions about his qualifications, etc.

If so, it is vital that you make a point of letting City council know
about your feelings right away.

This piece of business will get official endorsement during this
Thursday eveningís City Council Meeting (December 11). If you have an
opinion, please make sure to share it with the Victoria City Council by
letter, telephone or e-mail asap.  There has been no public forum on
this issue.

As far as "Howl" goes I'd say irregardless of one's personal "beliefs" concerning A.G.'s use of "Moloch" that what, hopefully, carries the poem-- insuring its end result as a Thing of "use"-- is the over-all Form with which A.G. lined the Thing up, especially in how it calls forth Whitman and Blake, along with the Old Testament, etc.

As for "hysteria" I'd say A.G. summed it up pretty good with the phrase "insanity-inducing-institution" which may be applied to various institutions: Catholic Church, CIA, FBI, etc.

i don't know
why i used it
al ginsberg
says different
what's his face says ancient
birch trees form letters

white paper white assertions
no perpendiculars in nature
a priori modes more than erstwhile rage ?
content to stream beyond my hand the milky way ?
summon the muses i don't know
i buy the whole theory frankly

one is always addressing somebody
it is you i address not her or her or her
it is you i shall address her then zing
gimmee i need a name is all
no nothing without a name
i don't desire refurbishment

rearrangement of anyone's basement doormat intact
it is flower's heavy sway how the fuck no rage
predominate o.k. only confusion ?
clarity you said i heard
you opened a door i
there's something wrong with you

funny odd strange horror is
old i saw black shroud last night
& shiver goes & sees things lucid
i said " confusion "
you said " hell's bells mixes help alone "
my love was so true

you want me for what something ?
i imagine any hell i'm due
involvement knows candor when
i don't know a p.o. box # from chairman mao's long march
some hole here all this & want
one night i lay here in the sky

& saw some maybes & what was there before i quit ?
maybe confusion all said maybe not
there's another goddamn letter or more nights somewhere
hesitation pills arrive in pictures
loss needs oxygen to free its' molecular anyway
how is it that it occurs on this place outside & between bodies ?

how devoted withheld glory
fuck these words stuck to the ground
& reinforce tremulous cloud  parades terminal shuffle ?
long gone empty air aspires to
a mistake it always returns before
indispensible logic tells logistics brain

"  digit replacement equals love in a two tiered metropolis "
i saw her eye glow
din of an aeroplane brought nothing
no rhythm
no poems
no nothing

not a goddamn thing
how disgust poetry thievery no escape from sight
buddhism wrong-way street joy ride
cogitate undulate i don't exist
maybe write longer lines is all undone ?
world seen heard felt ill retrieved

no bound at disaster's marvel nearly
instantaneous language accuracy spilt arrows
on going on alongside actual death of blather ?
telegraphic corporeal parameters measured in moans & sighs
exclamatory remarks incendiary pavement
she said everything broken this life

a  space where a door opens & closes
why not make a list of any woman's carnation ?
sky azure vast awhile waves
& just like that
the fucking enemy shows up

look up every week in our big OED; the one with the magnifying glass in
the little drawer so that you can read the tiny onion paper text.

As for your list I'd include Aristotle's Poetics and Erich Auerbach's
Mimesis : the representation of reality in Western literature.

there you go,

not quite so. jay leno made many canny remarks that could be
construed as mildly subversive during the opening phase of the
never-to-be-ended 2nd gulf war, last march and april...

Hi,
I'm wondering about any sort of influence that futurism may have had on
dada. i imagine that Tzara would have heard (or hear of) Marinetti's
sound poems but then i always think of Ball's poems with out words as a
sort of beginning.

the first futurist manifesto was in 1909 and the cabaret voltaire gets
going in 1916 but did any of the italians to to zurich? also, the dadas
were an international group but were the futurists initially influencial
outside italy? i know that marinetti visited moscow but the zaumnauts were
refuseniks when it came to italian futurism.

i guess i'm really intersted in any first wave crossover between the two
groups.

thanks,
kevin

RoseLee Goldberg's _Performance Art: From Futurism to the Present_ traces a
helpful timeline and lineage for Futurism and Dada, but I'm not sure if she
addresses Italians going to Zurich. I think it's  fair to say that the
Russians were informed by Futurism but reinterpreted it for their own
specific puposes. this might be a kind of influence..

Kevin - In 1990, when I was publishing books under the Bedford Arts,
Publishers imprint, we did a reprint of Marinetti's Futurist Cookbook -
A wonderful collection of mainly inedible recipes served in for different,
imaginary dining rooms of the most fantastic sort. (My Monday morning brain
is too fogged to report from ROM!) The book was a big hit in concurrence
among nineties installation/performance artists - particularly with Punk
Artists and musicians bent on blowing away every conceivable inherited yoke.
(Boy, do we need that energy - poet, visual, theatrical - from the young now
before the Evangelicals of the Bush Right bring on a total case of National
Collective Asthma! )

But your question does bring up a vague memory of Marinetti traveling to
European capitals to spread the Futurist gospel, sell work. America, I
forget. I am sure all traceable via Google.
As with Pound,  Marinetti was a brilliant innovator who got his nose stuck
up Fascist fantasy solutions - which pretty much impaled interest in the
value of his work.
Paul Vangelisti, the poet - I think he is at the Otis Art Institute in Los
Angeles - published Marinetti over the years, and is probably expert, if you
can reach him. It can be wonderful stuff, even just the typography of it.

I believe that some members of your list might be interested in the
Conference I am hosting at NYU in July. A brief announcement with links
follows:

PALA, The Poetics and Linguistics Association (http://www.pala.ac.uk/),
one of the oldest and most successful international organizations
dedicated to the study of stylistics and related fields, is holding its
24th annual conference, its first in North America, at New York
University, July 25-28, 2004. The full call for papers can be found at
the conference web site at

http://www.nyu.edu/gsas/dept/english/PALA2004/.

The theme is "Prospect & Retrospect": the first PALA conference in the
"new world" will focus on both old and new "worlds" of poetics and
linguistics. We invite abstracts and proposals for panel discussions and

workshops in the following and related areas of interest: stylistics,
narratology, literariness, literary linguistics, stylistics and
pedagogy, critical discourse analysis, gender and writing, literary
translation studies, linguistics and philosophy, metaphor, cognition,
cognitive poetics, pragmatics, text-linguistics, corpus linguistics,
text world theory, corpus stylistics, and statistical stylistics.

Deadline: January 30, 2003

hi betsy and all,

we had a thread last month, "Review magazines for a new poetry title," where
we covered this topic somewhat, so it might be a good place for you to look.

boog city reviews all printed matter, including chapbooks, and we have a
monthly free distribution of 2,000--more than most any other publication
that would review a chapbook.

if you want yr title considered for review, you can mail it to our printed
matter editor, Joanna Sondheim, to the below address.

best,
david

The biggest influence on Tzara was a guy named Urmuz -- he blew his brains out
after publishing about twenty pages of very strange little prose poems, and an
essay about the universe from a Schopenhauerian viewpoint.  I'm working on a
book about Andrei Codrescu and hit this huge vein of Urmuz -- I think he blew
his brains out about 1919, and Tzara tried to block the publication of Urmuz
translations in France in the 1950s so as to not have his lack of originality
widely known.  Ionesco and many other Romanian greats such as Cioran and others
point to Urmuz.

As for Marinetti, I know that the top surrealists met him and were wowed by his
style in about 1922.

Soupault mentions this in his autobiography.

But I don't know the links if they exist between the Italians and Tzara.
Romanian and Italian are mutually comprehensible, or almost, I think that
Codrescu said this in one of his autobiographies when he mentions first getting
out of Romania and living in Italy for some time with his friend Julian
Semilian.

It would seem more likely that the influence cam from the Russian
Cubo-futurists through artists like Malevich?

Kevin,

I'm on my way out the door but I can' pass this up.=20

Actually there was a huge amount of animosity between the two groups,
possibly because they had so much in common, especially when it came to =
the
topic of sound. In fact, Marinetti sent Russolo and his famous noise
machines to Paris on at least one occasion (around 1921) to deliberately
upset Tzara and the other Dadaists. And upset them it did! Apparently =
the
Dadaist came to the show with threw fruit and other things to throw at
Russolo in addition to the shouting etc. Its funny because a very =
similar
thing happened to Russolo in Milan (I think) performing in front of your
average crowd of theater goers (in that case the whole thing ended up in
punches).

As for traveling, Marinetti did travel a lot. As far as I know he did go =
to
Russia, as you say, but was not totally despised. Kruchenykh didn't have
much nice to say though! M. also went to London where he got a much =
warmer
reception.

I've got to catch a train plufff plafff.

More later, if you need.

-Ben

There are three good sources in English, but the best one is hard to find.
Look up Urmuz using World Catalog in your library and you'll see one book
translated by something like Stavrogitch.  That book is in four libraries in
the U.S.  Get one of them to lend it to you.  Xerox it.

The other is a journal called Adam that was published in London in the 80s by
a Romanian emigre.

They have a whole issue on Urmuz.

The third source is if you read French the translations by Ionesco.  I think
those are still in print.  That's probably the best writing as writing.  I
don't read Romanian, unfortunately, although I've dabbled at it for two
decades, I never really get rolling in it -- I do two weeks and then quit.

There is a Romanian critic by the name Ion Cornis-Pope who wrote a book
called Romanian Postmodernism: The Unfinished Battles in Romanian Literature
(I'm recalling the name off the top of my head) -- this book makes an
argument for the centrality of Urmuz to the entire western XXth century
avant-garde via Ionesco, Tzara, E.M. cioran, and many others who worked in
Paris with the surrealists such as Gherasim Luca.   All of them are using
Urmuz as a shooting star.  Even Codrescu has admitted that Urmuz is the
atomic bomb that he brought in his suitcase with him from Romanian
literature.

It's a fascinating small corpus -- about twenty five pages in all, but almost
every sentence is super-rich, and needs to be read carefully.  I think there
is a deeper cultural level for all this stuff -- but you have to be very
versed in Romanian literature and history to see all the links and richness
that the Romanian would see.

I believe that Julian Semilian -- Codrescu's colleague with whom he escaped
from Romania on the same plane -- is translating this material once more into
English.  He teaches somewhere in North Carolina at an art institute after
thirty years as an editor in Hollywood.

There is a massive underground Romanian avant-garde in America -- probably
three hundred individuals with high-level jobs and amazing multifarious
minds, and all of them relish this Urmuz, and see it as a touchstone.  This
avant-garde is widespread -- you can meet these people in France, in Israel,
and I even met an amazing Romanian intellectual once in Lisbon and spent the
day going to different gardens with him.  He spoke quite excellent English.
That's a weirdly rich country from an intellectual viewpoint.  In Bucharest
you make about ten dollars a month to work as a professor.  I've met some of
those profs and they are so profound and erudite that it's almost ridiculous
-- hence Urmuz.

They hang the man and flog the woman
That steal the goose from off the common,
But let the greater villain loose
That steals the common from the goose.

Constant apprehension of war has the same tendency
to render the head too large for the body.  A standing military
force with an overgrown executive will not long be safe.

"America is a quarter of a billion people totally misinformed and disinformed
by their government. This is tragic but our media is -- I wouldn't even say
corrupt -- it's just beyond telling us anything that the government doesn't
want us to know."

o.k
this is a very naive question
that entails a lot:

i am a graduate student at the poetics progran @ UB BUFFALO
that due to non poetic ( what is non-poetic?) circumstances will be
travelling as much as she can between buffalo and NYC
what would be , according this  "poetics discussion group" (labels are
labels) the best places that i could start correponding  with

in   order to (maybe) be able to read my work
(post scriptum: the poet does not require , at all, to be paid  for a
reading, in fact every reading is, according to this poet, another step in
the editing/ revision process


thanking in advance for feedback

Hi,

I gather Futuirism's style of aggressiove manifestos & manner of
promotion was an influence around Europe.  Often this was seen before
the actual work: which meant that their specific manifestos around
each medium were read in the abstract & were influential that way: ie
the recommendation of the new industrial materials (glass & plastic
etc in sculpture) were influential in Germany & Russia.

Picasso & Braque's work was not exhibited so widely tho it was held
in high esteem: so often Cubist 'forms' were first conveyed outside
Italy by exhibition of the lesser Cubists (Delaunay, Metzinger,
Gleizes, Le Falconnier et al I suppose) & by the Italian Futurists.
This I think was the case in Germany (probably influencing the Blue
Rider crowd & the Die Brucke people when they moved from Dresden to
Berlin, & in Russia influencing Goncharova & Rayonists & Russian
Futurists, Gabo & Pevsner-the Russians were a big influence on the
Bauhaus artists-so here Futurist influence could be filtered of its
Fascist & anti-pacifist colorings).

There are books like The Avant-Garde In Exhibition (by Altscxuler,
Uni of California Press) that look at specific watershed exhibitions
of the twentieth century & their influence.

Cheers

"AP=A0=A0=A0=A0SUSQUEHANNA, Pa. -- Always conscious of its past, the Mormon church
has opened temples at two important historic sites in recent years and now
has made another purchase inspired by faith -- about 25 rural acres
contaminated by diesel fuel and other chemicals.
=A0=A0=A0The land is needed for the church's plan to rebuild the home of founder
Joseph Smith and improve access to the nearby Susquehanna River, where Smit=
h
was baptized in May 1829."

Be it the Mormon's Smith or the Coleridge/Wordsworth Romantic duo, there
must be something in the Susquehanna River that produces utopian visions. I
wonder what powers the local Indians ascribed to the waters before or
simultaneous with the European advent.  Perfection seems to have eluded
everyone. Though Military and other officials in Washington and Iraq
continue to insist things are still promising, etc., and moving towards an
ideal society, issues of oil contamination non-withstanding. Ah Wolfolitz,
the Late Romantic, and religious, too.

Patterns: In Aging, Distress Takes Its Toll

disease, according to a study published today.=20

Dr. Robert S. Wilson of the Rush Alzheimer's Disease Center in=20
Chicago, the study's lead author, said that earlier research had shown=20
that chronic stress undermined the functioning of the part of the brain=20
governing memory. He and his colleagues wondered if a lifetime of=20
stress could make people more vulnerable to Alzheimer's.=20

They tested the idea on members of the Religious Orders Study,=20
whose life experiences were more similar than the general population's.=20
Eight hundred members, with an average age of 75, completed=20
surveys in an effort to gauge what researchers called "distress=20
proneness," how likely reactions to stress would result in gloom or=20
anxiety, a trait also known as neuroticism. Various memory and=20
other mental tasks were also measured.

The subjects were re-examined an average of five years later. In=20
the meantime, Alzheimer's had been diagnosed in 140 of them.=20
People who had scored the highest on the neuroticism test were=20
twice as likely to have developed the condition as those who scored=20
the lowest, whom Dr. Rush described as "secure, hardy and generally=20

Dear Alex,
At one time I was fascinated by this, and wanted to write a book of
poetry about it.  Instead I wrote a long poem, based to some extent on
Southey's Life of Nelson, on Horatio Nelson.  Southey and Coleridge were
in this together (I think they were married to 2 sisters); the movement
was called Pantisocracy.  One or other of them actually got as far as
Liverpool to inquire about boats.  I know very little after all this
time: but it's still an episode I find intriguing.  I was interested in
it mainly because of Coleridge (the over-riding image of whom is still,
in my brain, the picture of him digging impacted feces out of his anus
with a pen in the latter stages of debilitation as a result of
addiction).  There was something comical about the enterprise: something
that would have very much ceased to be comical if ever the poets and
their wives had actually arrived and started wresting lives out of the
fresh air.  I was also interested in the prospect of parallel lives:
what might have been; but more interested in what stopped Colerdige and
Southey proceeding with the realization of their dream.  If you do any
work on this, I'd be interested in seeing it.

apologies in advance to those of you who've already received this. / ES.

December 8, 2003

Dear Friend(s),

I'm writing to encourage you to subscribe, re-subscribe, and/or
subscribe a friend to CHICAGO REVIEW for the coming year. With the
holidays right around the corner, we're pleased to be able to sweeten
the deal through an arrangement with two new energetic presses: for
each subscription we receive by January 15, 2004, we'll include the
book of your choice from Flood Editions or The Gig Editions. This way
you'll get, or give, both a fine book and a year of CHICAGO
REVIEW--all for a paltry $22!!!

Established in Chicago in 2001, Flood Editions has rapidly made its
mark both locally and nationally with its handsome editions of poetry
and prose. Established earlier this year in Toronto, Canada, The Gig
Editions is the book-publishing wing of The Gig, a journal of
Anglophone poetry and criticism. Both presses have longstanding

Over the years CHICAGO REVIEW has specialized in special
issues--whether those are anthologies in translation such as "New
Writing in German" (2002) and "New Polish Writing" (2000), or
collections of archival and critical materials on neglected twentieth
century figures, such as "Stan Brakhage: Correspondences" (2002) and
"On Robert Duncan" (1999), to name just a few recent examples. These
special issues are complemented by our general issues, where we
publish some of the best writing being done today in poetry and
prose, along with critical essays, interviews, and reviews. (Our
recently renovated website, http://humanities.uchicago.edu/review,
has a complete archive of recent and past issues--take a look and
see!) We like to think we've maintained a balance between taking
risks and remaining relevant, and hope you agree. We're well underway
with producing and planning another stimulating year of issues and

NEW BOOKS FROM FLOOD EDITIONS

LISA JARNOT, BLACK DOG SONGS
Black Dog Songs is Lisa Jarnot's third volume of poetry. Decidedly
lyrical, these poems move through pastures and politics to the quick
of thought. What emerges is a catalog of loves and laments: "Just the
eldergrass and him, the fog, unpoliced and safe inside the train, the
thoughts of rain, Apollo, and the sun . . ."

GRAHAM FOUST, AS IN EVERY DEAFNESS
Graham Foust's first collection sounds the depths of need and loss
through narcotics and the bleak interiors of winter. Although
suspended in indefinite, sometimes desperate states of desire, these
spare poems move toward an honest recognition of the damage incurred:
"Welcome, autumn, / to my room / of empty things. / / Welcome to a
room / like you."

ROBERT DUNCAN, LETTERS: POEMS 1953-56
First published by the Jargon Society in 1958, Letters announces the
major phase of Robert Duncan's writing. Though long unavailable, it
stands as a foundational book of postmodern poetry, setting
"self-creation and self-consciousness in constant interplay" (in the
author's own words). Edited by Robert J. Bertholf, the present
edition includes an afterword as well as a series of memos from
Duncan to the typesetter Claude Fredericks.

WILLIAM FULLER, SADLY
Drawing equally on Buddhist sutras and country blues, Sadly derives
compassion from its ironic vision. Quick and sometimes elusive, these
poems observe fluctuations in consciousness, economic markets, and
the weather. In the Chicago Tribune, Maureen McLane has written of
Fuller's "dense, elliptical meditations," finding "luminous images
that consistently marry the cerebral and the sensual."

NEW BOOKS FROM THE GIG EDITIONS

REMOVED FOR FURTHER STUDY: THE POETRY OF TOM RAWORTH
Removed for Further Study brings together new writing on the British
poet Tom Raworth by 24 poets and critics from both sides of the
Atlantic, four previously uncollected texts by the poet, and a
detailed bibliography. The contributors are: David Ball, cris cheek,
Ian Davidson, Nate Dorward, Ken Edwards, Gunnar Harding, Anselm
Hollo, Fanny Howe, Doug Lang, J. C. C. Mays, Peter Middleton, Alan
Munton, Tom Orange, Marjorie Perloff, Simon Perril, Joan Retallack,
Peter Robinson, Claude Royet-Journoud, Robert Sheppard, Ron Silliman,
Jonathan Skinner, Keith Tuma, Ben Watson and John Wilkinson. Removed
for Further Study provides a fresh and engaging set of responses to
the work of one of the major poets of our time.

MAGGIE O'SULLIVAN, PALACE OF REPTILES
The long-awaited followup to O'Sullivan's In the House of the Shaman
(1993), Palace of Reptiles is a dance and a ritual conducted in
language, a plumbing and sounding-out of buried histories and
vocabularies. Ranging from the brief and beautiful "Ellen's Lament"
to the central long poem "DOUBTLESS," the eight poems of this book
touch on multiple genres--elegy, celebration, performance art,
poetics talk--in order to transform them.

Sir, have you ever written or read a poem?  Do you know poets?

they pay ATTENTION and REFLECT on what they have attended to.  the world

Alexander, this is fascinating.  I wonder if the site is marked or commemorated in any way.  It could be a point for civic reconstruction.  I think a single idea circulating like this can help to rebuild a town's sense of itself.  I remember reading this, but cannot at this point contribute anything concrete in terms of location.  I would like to know what is currently on the site that Coleridge once owned (I assume it is not
still owned by his family, or heirs?).

The site should be pinpointed, and honored in some way.

I want to say that Joseph Priestley did make it out to Susquehanna.  He
was far more practically revolutionary than his younger poetic peers.  As
a consequence, the church, constitution, and crown mob basically torched
his house in London.

a side note is that the early romantics/Jacobins tended to be men (and
women) of a certain age--most over thirty and already in careers that (as
shown by the above) could be harmed by professing views contrary to the
state. (Blake, Holcroft, Wollstonecraft, and Godwin belong to this group).
The younger (first-generation) romantics (Coleridge, Southey, Wordsworth)
dallied with being radicals, but apostasized when it was clear the wind
was blowing in a different direction.  Hazlitt, nearly alone of his
generation, kept the faith.  It's perhaps no coincedence that he was
dissenter; i.e. a non-C of E communicant, and thereby disenfranchised by
the English political system

 As I recall there were disagreements over the question of the ownership of
property, whether everything should be held in common or not, basic issues
like that. And that these disagreements were what sunk the scheme. Coleridge
gave quite a few public lectures on Pantisocracy in an effort to raise money
for the venture.

Dear Alex,
At one time I was fascinated by this, and wanted to write a book of poetry
about it.  Instead I wrote a long poem, based to some extent on Southey's
Life of Nelson, on Horatio Nelson.  Southey and Coleridge were in this
together (I think they were married to 2 sisters); the movement was called
Pantisocracy.  One or other of them actually got as far as Liverpool to
inquire about boats.  I know very little after all this
time: but it's still an episode I find intriguing.  I was interested in it
mainly because of Coleridge (the over-riding image of whom is still, in my
brain, the picture of him digging impacted feces out of his anus with a pen
in the latter stages of debilitation as a result of addiction).  There was
something comical about the enterprise: something that would have very much
ceased to be comical if ever the poets and their wives had actually arrived
and started wresting lives out of the fresh air.  I was also interested in
the prospect of parallel lives: what might have been; but more interested in
what stopped Colerdige and Southey proceeding with the realization of their
dream.  If you do any work on this, I'd be interested in seeing it. Mairead

The "Poems about Places" contest incited new interest in an old subject for
me.  Decades ago I remember reading that the English Romantics, specifically
Coleridge and Wordsworth, actually purchased a plot of land in New York
state where they intended to begin to develop a city-state that was to
become the location of their "perfect society."

Dear Chris,

My answers to your questions, though probably too late for this
semester.

1. is the task of poetry to communicate? what, then, does it/does it not
communicate and how?

Poetry disdains tasks.  Poetry is a shirker, a Mary to Martha, a Mary
with delicious long hair and a fiery or sibilant tongue.  But like Mary,
and everything except the lilies, poetry is given tasks, which she
morosely fulfils, crying, considering no compensation enough.  Actually,
I realize this describes myself rather than poetry.

I think poetry principally communicates backwards: all the dead poets
whom one loves and whom one would too shy or too wrong to converse with
in life are there, in whispers, at just the right volume.  Poetry
readings can be a lot of fun, personally I love (giving) them, but
poetry, whether communicating backwards or forwards, seems best adapted
to gaps in time or space or language or concepts or presence: which cry
out for leap-frogging as much as poetry likes to leap-frog. A marvelous
symbiosis.

2. does poetry communicate meaning? is signification meaning? is poetry
a communicator of ideas? actions?

Sure.  Sure.  Sure.  Sure.  It's also fun for the tongue, fun for the
ear, fun for the eye, and fun for the weird little brain.  I am speaking
from the heart.

3. is the writer a "giver of consciousness"? (Sartre) a liberator? does
this confer on the writer an ethical responsibility?

If the poet is a liberator, the person being liberated is herself.
Notice how close to "Satire" is "Sartre"!  Everyone who deals with words
and/or human beings has an ethical responsibility.  That's everybody.
Nobody's out there conferring anything on poets.  Except tasks.

4. is it the task of poetry to take positions?

Like ballet or chess.  Did you see AVERAGE JOE last night?  Wasn't it
funny when the handsome guy said chess was beyond him so they played
lifesize checkers for a bit and then realized the white pieces should be
on the white squares, ditto the black?  I also liked the bit in the
boudoir where the furry dog caught fire.  This is a very hard question
and I have now used up the 20 mins a day I allot to poetry.

I doubt this has been any help at all, Chris, but I have been looking
forward to doing it for some time.

With every good wish,

Mairéad

 As I recall there were disagreements over the question of the ownership
of
property, whether everything should be held in common or not, basic
issues
like that. And that these disagreements were what sunk the scheme.
Coleridge
gave quite a few public lectures on Pantisocracy in an effort to raise
money
for the venture.

Dear Alex,
At one time I was fascinated by this, and wanted to write a book of
poetry
about it.  Instead I wrote a long poem, based to some extent on
Southey's
Life of Nelson, on Horatio Nelson.  Southey and Coleridge were in this
together (I think they were married to 2 sisters); the movement was
called
Pantisocracy.  One or other of them actually got as far as Liverpool to
inquire about boats.  I know very little after all this
time: but it's still an episode I find intriguing.  I was interested in
it
mainly because of Coleridge (the over-riding image of whom is still, in
my
brain, the picture of him digging impacted feces out of his anus with a
pen
in the latter stages of debilitation as a result of addiction).  There
was
something comical about the enterprise: something that would have very
much
ceased to be comical if ever the poets and their wives had actually
arrived
and started wresting lives out of the fresh air.  I was also interested
in
the prospect of parallel lives: what might have been; but more
interested in
what stopped Colerdige and Southey proceeding with the realization of
their
dream.  If you do any work on this, I'd be interested in seeing it.

The "Poems about Places" contest incited new interest in an old subject
for
me.  Decades ago I remember reading that the English Romantics,
specifically
Coleridge and Wordsworth, actually purchased a plot of land in New York
state where they intended to begin to develop a city-state that was to
become the location of their "perfect society."

Academic rumor has it that the site proposed by the poets for locating
their
political paradise was at the confluence of the Chenango and the
Susquehanna
rivers, which as some of you know, is just a short distance from down
town
Binghamton.

I have since my early U.G. days, trashed all my old notes; I'm having a

their

Dear Chris,

My answers to your questions probably also too late for this
semester. but they are from the hip:

1. is the task of poetry to communicate? what, then, does it/does it not
communicate and how?

i think poetry only offers something to the reader, i.e. the reader
communicates with his/herself through an understanding of a poem.  it does
not offer an author's view or give a reader a view of the author behind the
emerald curtain.  this is an illusion.  such  an understanding of a poem is
only a construct of the reader and only demonstrates the reader's choices in
what to understand from the text.  a writer becomes a reader the minute he
or she edits a poem or writes with a purpose, albeit a reader with a special
privilege, that of changing the visual appearance of a written poem or aural
appearance of a spoken one.  the minute a writer begins to understand what
is being written by him or herself, he or she becomes a reader.

2. does poetry communicate meaning? is signification meaning? is poetry
a communicator of ideas? actions?

poetry doesn't communicate anything.  readers read meaning.  signification
is an act of recognition on behalf of the reader that offers a handy system
for supposing meaning.  poetry doesn't communicate ideas or actions, these
things are  read into/from a poem by a reader.  ideas, actions, meanings,
these are decisions a reader makes.


3. is the writer a "giver of consciousness"? (Sartre) a liberator? does
this confer on the writer an ethical responsibility?

the writer and the reader have ethical responsibilities.  poetry can't
liberate it is an inanimate thing, a concept.  a person can use poetry or
their reading of a poem to prompt action, yes.  the writer doesn't give
consciousness, the reader reads it into the prose that is supposed to create
a character as in _Ulysses_; the reader is the presence which connects, and
maintains the characters in that story.

4. is it the task of poetry to take positions?

no, though, and by now you've probably guessed my answer, it can be the
'task' of the reader.  the question is a curious one though.  does it take
positions?  well, a poem can take a position, as in elicit a reading which
suggests a certain position, or stance of the reader's thought...  and in
that sense it takes a position as in literally removes it from the reader.
the reader gives that position to the text...

thanks for the questions.  they may have seemed simple, but sometimes simple
questions can offer great opportunity for insight into more complex
situation.  Deleuze points to the correspondence between Spinoza and
Bleynbergh, suggesting that Bleynbergh's letters were somehow simple, but
the answers they elicited in Spinoza were well worth the apparent simpleness
of the corresponder (In:  _Deleuze, Spinoza: Practical Philosophy_, pg 30).

Now playing in 2,600 home theaters: Bush's lies about Iraq
Director Robert Greenwald's "Uncovered" reveals the deceptions and
distortions used to sell the invasion. And from the limousine liberals at
Moby's bash in NYC to the regular folks in Billings, Mont., antiwar and
anti-Bush audiences are eating it up.

- - - - - - - - - - - -
By Michelle Goldberg



Dec. 9, 2003  | NEW YORK -- Early one morning in June, film director
Robert Greenwald settled into the study of his Los Angeles home with the
day's newspaper. Midway through an article was a seemingly innocuous quote
from a Bush administration official assuring the country that weapons of
mass destruction programs would be found in Iraq.

Greenwald says he got a knot in his stomach. The administration wasn't
talking about finding actual weapons anymore. Now the rhetoric was about
weapons programs, which might mean little more than sheets of paper. "I
had no faith or confidence that the media would catch them on their moving
of their goal," he says. "Suddenly, I could see the headline in a month
where they're going to announce victory because they found programs. I
flashed back on all those news conferences where they said Iraq is a
danger and invoked Armageddon.

"I felt I could do a service by nailing them on this complete change in
why they went to war," Greenwald says. "Two or three days later I read
about this group of former CIA experts from different branches who were
coming out against [the administration]. I thought, 'Wow, this is
interesting.' So I put the two instincts together." Thus the documentary
"Uncovered: The Whole Truth About the Iraq War" was born. Within a few
months, it was completed.

Since then, "Uncovered" has emerged as a kind of liberal master narrative
about the run-up to Operation Iraqi Freedom. It's for sale on several
major progressive Web sites, including those of the Nation, Buzzflash,
John Podesta's Center for American Progress, and MoveOn.org (both MoveOn
and the Center for American Progress helped fund the film). So far, it's
sold more than 40,000 copies. Financier and Bush foe George Soros held a
screening of it in New York. Podesta, Bill Clinton's chief of staff,
showed it to an audience of 100 at the International Spy Museum in
Washington, and his center sent a copy to every member of Congress. When
Greenwald screened it at a 500-seat theater in L.A., people jammed the
aisles, stood in the back, and cheered when it was over.

And on Sunday, people gathered in more than 2,600 American homes, cafes
and community spaces to watch "Uncovered" at parties organized through the
progressive group MoveOn.org. As Greenwald points out, 2,600 screens is a
huge release for an hour-long documentary. Hollywood blockbusters, he
says, typically open on about 4,000. The showings were held across the
country, from a living room in Clearfield, Utah, to a luxury apartment in
a Donald Trump building on Central Park South, where pop star Moby and
money manager Boykin Curry hosted about 40 people. At 8:30 p.m. EST,
parties nationwide called in to a massive conference where Eli Pariser,
speaking from Moby's party, interviewed Greenwald, who'd dialed in from
Los Angeles. The questions were submitted by MoveOn members.

There's nothing new in "Uncovered," but there's power in the accumulation
of expertise that Greenwald presents, which is one reason Bush's opponents
are embracing it. It consists largely of interviews with former American
intelligence agents, military officers and diplomats who eviscerate much
of the White House's case for war. Among them are Joseph Wilson, the
retired diplomat who investigated claims that Iraq was shopping for
uranium in Niger and found them baseless; Patrick Lang, former chief
Middle East analyst for the Pentagon's Defense Intelligence Agency; Chas
Freeman, former ambassador to Saudi Arabia; CIA veteran Robert Baer; and
more than a dozen others. The film opens by introducing each of them and
telling how long each served the United States. The weight of all their
experience gives their criticisms of the Bush administration a heft
missing from news reports that just quote one or two disgruntled veterans.

The movie does more than just present the case against the hawks, though.
Greenwald wants to make sure that the administration's prewar claims don't
disappear down the memory hole now that most of them have proven false. To
this end, he compiles footage of Bush and Condoleezza Rice warning of
mushroom clouds and of Paul Wolfowitz telling Congress that Iraq can pay
for its own reconstruction. Lately, conservative pundits like Andrew
Sullivan have claimed that the administration never suggested that Iraq
was an imminent threat. Greenwald offers an implicit rejoinder with a
montage that begins with Bush saying, "Delay, indecision and inaction
could lead to a massive and sudden horror." It then cuts to Rice, who
says, "It simply makes no sense to wait any longer." Then Rumsfeld: "Take
action, before it's too late." And Bush: "We will not wait." The sequence
ends with Vice President Dick Cheney saying, "As President Bush has said,
time is not on our side."

"I believe it's irrefutable that we were lied to and information was
distorted in the effort to get us to go to war," says Greenwald. "I hope
the film is an element in communicating that. I hope it will reach people
who already feel that, people who are uncertain, and people who disagree
and will be able to look at the film and make an educated response to what
I think will go down as one of the great tragedies in the history of this
country."

Because Sunday's screenings were hosted by MoveOn members, it's likely
that many viewers already agreed with Greenwald. Yet even at Moby's
Manhattan party, views were far from uniform about the justice and
justifications of the war.

Boykin Curry, a 37-year-old friend of Moby's who lent his sprawling
apartment for the event, is strongly pro-war. "I support the war for
ultimately liberal reasons," he said. "To free 30 million Iraqis from
brutal repression and foster the only liberal democracy in the Middle
East." If that sounds like Paul Wolfowitz's position, Curry doesn't mind
-- in fact, he says he "loves" the deputy secretary of defense.

Nor were some of his guests particularly political. The apartment,
decorated in earth tones and Asian details, was full of lovely women with
highlighted hair wearing pointy-toed boots and $150 jeans. Guests were
served pizza, warm fruit pie à la mode and Veuve Clicquot champagne. Some
attendees had never even heard of MoveOn, but showed up because Curry had
invited them. Curry himself is dismissive of MoveOn's politics, and of
Howard Dean, the favorite candidate of MoveOn members. A Lieberman
supporter, he said if Dean gets the nomination, he'll vote for Bush.

Yet Curry considers himself a staunch Democrat, and he's furious about the
way the Bush administration deceptively sold the war and then bungled the
occupation. "Like Joe Lieberman said, George Bush has given a noble war a
bad name," he said. In fact, Curry blames Bush for ruining the righteous
project that Wolfowitz worked for.

"This isn't about being for the war or against the war," said Moby. "It's
about a president who lies."

Moby got involved with MoveOn a month and a half ago, when he agreed to
judge the group's "Bush in 30 Seconds" contest, a competition to create
the best anti-Bush advertisement. He first saw "Uncovered" in the basement
of the Tribeca Grand Hotel on Nov. 6, at a screening that included Janeane
Garofalo, Nation editor Katrina vanden Heuvel and Joseph Wilson. Moby
called the film "powerful" and said that before seeing it, "I didn't
realize the extent of the deceit. Everyone in the administration knew
beyond a shadow of a doubt that there were no weapons of mass
destruction."

It's not hard to see how "Uncovered" would leave viewers with that
impression. Again and again, Greenwald juxtaposes scare-mongering quotes
from the administration with expert debunking. First, he shows Bush
saying, "Saddam Hussein had the materials to produce as much as 500 tons
of sarin, mustard and VX nerve agent." That's followed by Peter Zimmerman,
former chief scientist for the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, saying:
"Any sarin that they were making in 1990, 1991, had a known shelf life of
about two months. Well, if you made it 12 years ago and it had a shelf
life of two months, it may not be safe to drink, but it isn't sarin nerve
gas any longer. And there's no way the agency could not have known that."

After a clip of Secretary of State Colin Powell's presentation at the
United Nations on Feb. 5, Ray McGovern, a 27-year veteran of the CIA who
founded Veteran Intelligence Professionals for Sanity to protest the
administration's distortions, says, "I would have to comment here on
Secretary of State Colin Powell's debut as an imagery analyst. It was
highly embarrassing for those of us who know something about the business.
We couldn't tell whether this was an honest mistake by those who now do
the imagery analysis ... or whether perhaps Colin Powell was being set
up."

Much of what these administration critics say has since proved correct.
What's missing from Greenwald's film, though, is an acknowledgment that
people in the Bush administration were not the only ones who believed that
Iraq had some kind of prohibited weapons. The sarin Saddam had in 1991
might have broken down, but that doesn't settle the larger question of
whether Saddam continued to produce biological or chemical weapons after
the U.N. weapons inspectors left in 1998. Greenwald doesn't interview
anyone like Kenneth Pollack, former director for Gulf affairs at the
National Security Council, a liberal Iraq hawk who at least could have
explained why some well-meaning, seemingly well-informed people believed
that Iraq was a threat, if not an imminent one. The only journalist in the
film is the Nation's David Corn, who makes important points but who might
usefully have been balanced by pro-war writers like the New York Times'
Thomas Friedman or the New Republic's Peter Beinart.

"Uncovered's" weakness isn't that it has a point of view, but that it
hardly bothers to take on opposing ones. Frontline's October documentary,
"Truth, War and Consequences," is just as damning as Greenwald's -- and
covers much of the same ground -- but it's even more persuasive, because
it allows players like Iraqi exile Ahmad Chalabi and Pentagon advisor
Richard Perle to make their cases, and arguably to hang themselves. It
also suggests the extent to which the administration may have deceived
itself even as it was deceiving the nation, a hypothesis missing from the
fairly black-and-white world of "Uncovered," in which the administration's
possible motives remain opaque.

Still, even if "Uncovered" lacks nuance, it's largely accurate and
politically effective. Even Curry couldn't find much to disagree with in
the documentary, though he did think that it trivialized and distorted
Wolfowitz's vision. "I thought 85 percent of it was legit," he said.

"This was a movie about Bush and his lies," said Curry. "Not about whether
this war was justified."

Greenwald doesn't disagree. "I think it's legitimate to debate whether to
go to war on the neoconservative argument that we need to go in and fix
the Middle East," he says. "It's illegitimate nonsense to talk about
weapons of mass destruction and terrorism."

Not that the administration is talking about either anymore. On Sunday,
White House chief of staff Andy Card appeared on CNN and declared that
questions about prewar intelligence are now "moot" given Saddam's
atrocious human rights record.

And what about weapons of mass destruction? "We think there's evidence of
some programs that they had," Card said.

The Pantisocratic project is sadly comic. For instance, the site on the
banks of the Susquehanna was chosen because of the melliflousness of the
name, the principal reasons for the failure of the idea was that the
Pantisocrats could not find anyone willing to pay for their sea passage.
Southey began his long retreat to conservatism as a result and Coleridge
found Nether Stowey and Persons from Porlock to leave his visions safely
fragmentary.

Poets Nathaniel Tarn and Janet Rodney have had to postpone their upcoming
POG reading (scheduled for this Saturday, December 13).

We're trying to reschedule them for this coming spring (if not, for next
fall).

We'll resume programming in January, and should have a terrific (and busy)
spring schedule.

Please check our website in a couple of weeks to see what's coming up . . .

or email us at mailto:pog@gopog.org

good holiday wishes to all,

Dear Friends of POG:

I’m writing to introduce you to POG, a Tucson-based non-profit arts
organization whose mission is to present to the public the work of
innovative poets and other artists, and to ask you to consider becoming a
POG Patron or Sponsor.

This is POG’s eighth season of public arts programming.  Our Poetry in
Action series presents nine or ten Tucson events per year, typically pairing
a reading by a poet with a presentation by a visual artist or musician, and
a visiting presenter with a local one.  This cross-over programming helps to
build an audience base for experimental artists working in various media,
and draws attention to the ways in which Tucson’s own avant-garde artists
are part of a wider process of innovation.

POG is supported annually by the Arizona Commission for the Arts, the
National Endowment for the Arts, and the Tucson-Pima Arts Council. However,
these public monies cover only about one-third of our annual budget, which
in recent years has typically exceeded $6,000.  We need to raise the
remainder through a combination of event admissions, special fundraisers,
and private and corporate donations.

We hope you’ll consider becoming a 2003-2004 Patron, for the modest amount
of $100, or a Sponsor, for $50.  Both Patrons and Sponsors are listed in all
POG publicity.  In addition, Patrons receive two free gifts and two free
admissions to all POG events; Sponsors receive one of each.  For
contributions exceeding $100, POG will gladly negotiate additional
perquisites.

POG is an IRS recognized 501(c)3 non-profit corporation.  All contributions
are fully tax deductible to the extent allowed by law.

If you’d like to purchase a Season Subscription or become a POG Sponsor or
POG Patron, simply complete the accompanying form and mail it, along with
your check  made out to POG, to: POG, 5029 N Post Trail, Tucson, AZ  85750.

Thank you for your interest in POG programming.

Sincerely,



Tenney Nathanson
President, POG Board of Directors

This Welcome Message updated 24 March 2003.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Above the world-weary horizons
New obstacles for exchange arise
Or unfold,
O ye postmasters!

1. About the Poetics List

With the preceeding epigraph, the Poetics Listserv was founded by Charles
Bernstein in late 1993. Now in its third incarnation, the list carries
about 1000 subscribers worldwide, though all of these subscribers do not
necessarily receive messages at any given time. A good number of other
people read the Poetics List via our web archives (see web-address above).

Our aim is to support, inform, and extend those directions in poetry that
are committed to innovations, renovations, and investigations of form
and/or/as content, to the questioning of received forms and styles, and to
the creation of the otherwise unimagined, untried, unexpected, improbable,
and impossible.  We recognize that other lists may sponsor other
possibilities for exchange in this still-new medium. We request that those
participating in this forum keep in mind the specialized and focused nature
of this project, and respect our decision to operate a moderated list. For
subscription information or to contact the moderators, write to
<poetics@acsu.buffalo.edu>.

This is a private list and information about this list should not be posted
to other lists or directories of lists. The idea is to keep the list
membership to those with specific rather than general interests, and also
to keep the scale of the list relatively small and the volume manageable.
The current limits of the list are 50 messages per day, and two messages
per subscriber per day.

The Poetics List is a moderated list. Due to the high number of
subscribers, we no longer maintain the open format with which the list
began (at under 100 subscribers). The specific form of moderation that we
employ is a relatively fluid one: in most cases, messages are reviewed
after having been posted to the list, and difficulties resolved on that
basis; however, the list moderators may shift with impunity between this
and a pre-review mode which calls for all messages to be read and approved
before being forwarded to the list. We prefer to avoid this option, as it
hampers the spontaneity of discussion that we hope to promote. In addition
to these options, the list moderators may place subscribers who find
themselves unable to abide by the rules of the list under individual
review, in which case only their messages would be received for moderators'
approval before being forwarded to the list. We remain committed to this
editorial function as a defining element of the Poetics List (for further
information please see section 6 of this Welcome Message).

Those few individuals who are no longer welcome to post on this list have
forfeited that right because of their refusal to abide by list policies as
stated in this Welcome message. While we adhere to a practice of not
discussing particular cases on the list, the areas of our greatest concern
include flaming of other list subscribers, including the list owners,
and/or giving us false registration information. Please note some
individuals have publicized false accounts of the policies of the Poetics
List. We have deemed it unwise to respond directly to the flames of the
list, preferring simply to note here that the Poetics List exists to
support and encourage divergent points of view on Modern and contemporary
poetry and poetics. We are committed to do what is necessary to preserve
this space for such dialog. For this reason, the list has always been
private or moderated.

Further information on posting to the list for subscribers, publishers and
series-coordinators, see sections 5 and 6.

In addition to being archived at through the EPC (http://epc.buffalo.edu)
and at http://listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu/archives/poetics.html, some posts
to Poetics (especially reviews, obituary notices, announcements, etc.) may
also become part of specific EPC subject areas. Brief reviews of poetry
events and publications are always welcome; we also encourage posts that
announce events important to our subscribers. See section 5 for details.

----------------

2. Subscriptions

Subscriptions to the Poetics List are free of charge, but formal
registration is required. We ask that when you subscribe you provide your
full name, street address, email address, and telephone number. All posts
to the list should provide your full real name, as registered. If there is
any discrepancy between your full name as it appears in the "from" line of
the message header, please sign your post at the bottom.  PLEASE NOTE: All
subscription-related information and correspondence remains absolutely
confidential.

To subscribe to the Poetics List, please contact the moderators at the
lists' administrative address <poetics@acsu.buffalo.edu>. Your message
should include all of the required information. All other questions about
subscriptions, whether about an individual subscription or subscription
policy, should be addressed to this same administrative address.

PLEASE NOTE: IT MAY TAKE SEVERAL WEEKS TO PROCESS SUBSCRIPTION REQUESTS.

The most frequent problem with subscriptions is bounced messages. If your
system is often down or if you have a low disk quota, Poetics messages may
get bounced. Please try avoid having messages from the list returned to us.
If the problem is low disk quota, you may wish to request an increased
quota from your system administrator.  You might also consider obtaining a
commercial account. In general, if a good number of Poetics messages are
bounced from your account, your subscription to Poetics will be temporarily
suspended. If this happens, you may re-subscribe to the list by contacting
the moderators at<poetics@acsu.buffalo.edu>.

-----------------

3. Subscription Options

We encourage you to alter your subscription options via the link on the
right side of the screen at
http://listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu/archives/poetics.html.  If you would
prefer not to use the web-interface, you may also email
<listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu> the following commands:

*to receive posts in the default option (you will receive individual
postings immediately), send <listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu> this one-line
message with no "subject": set poetics nodigest

* to receive the list in digest form (you will receive the day's individual
posts in one email sent just after midnight EST), send
<listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu> this one-line message with no "subject":
set poetics digest

* to receive the list in index form (you will receive a list, without the
text of the posts, of the subjects discussed each day along with the
author's name and address and the number of lines it comprises; you can
also choose to have the index sent to you in either plain text or in HTML
format with hyperlinks), send <listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu> this one-line
message with no "subject": set poetics nohtml index  --or--  set poetics
html index

*to temporarily turn off Poetics mail send <listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu>
this one-line message with no "subject": set poetics nomail

*to reactivate Poetics mail send <listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu> this
one-line message with no "subject": set poetics mail

PLEASE NOTE: do not leave your Poetics subscription "active" if you are
going to be away for any extended period of time.  Your account may become
flooded and you may lose not only Poetics messages but other important mail.

-----------------------

4.  To Unsubscribe

To unsubscribe (or change any of your subscription options) go to the
right-hand side of the screen at
http://listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu/archives/poetics.html  You may also may
unsubscribe by sending a one-line email to <listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu>
with no "subject": unsub poetics

If you are having difficulty unsubscribing, please note: sometimes your
e-mail address may be changed slightly by your system administrator. If
this happens you will not be able to send messages to Poetics or to
unsubscribe, although you will continue to receive mail from the Poetics
List. To avoid this problem, unsub using your old address, then return to
your new address and contact the moderators at <poetics@acsu.buffalo.edu>
to resubscribe. If you find that it is not possible to unsub using your old
address, please contact the moderators at <poetics@acsu.buffalo.edu> for
assistance.

--------------------------

5.  Posting to the List

The Poetics List is a moderated list. All messages are reviewed by the
moderators in keeping with the goals of the list as articulated in this
Welcome Message (see section 1).

Please note that while this list is primarily concerned with discussions of
poetry and poetics, messages relating to politics and political activism,
film, art, media, and so forth are also welcome. Feel free to query the
list moderators if you are uncertain as to whether a message is
appropriate. All correspondence with the moderators regarding submissions
to the list remains confidential and should be directed to us at
<poetics@acsu.buffalo.edu>.

We strongly encourage subscribers to post information on publications and
reading series that they have coordinated, edited, published, or in which
they appear. Such announcements constitute a core function of this list.
Brief reviews of poetry events and publications are always welcome.

To post to the Poetics List, send your messages directly
to the list address: <poetics@listserv.buffalo.edu>

Please do not send messages intended for posting to the list to our
administrative address <poetics@acsu.buffalo.edu>

For further information on posting to the list, see section 6 below.

-------------------

6. Cautions

"Flame" messages will not be tolerated on the Poetics List. In this
category are included messages gratuitously attacking fellow listees or the
list owners, also messages designed to "waste bandwidth" or cause the list
to reach its daily limit. These messages are considered offensive and
detrimental to list discussion. Offending subscribers will be placed on
temporary review (see section 1). Repeat offenders will be removed from the
list immediately. Please do not put this policy to test.

For reasons of basic security, we do not allow pseudononymous
subscriptions.  We also discourage the sending of HTML-formatted messages
to the list. All messages intended for the Poetics List should be sent in
Text-Only format.

Please also do not send attachments or include extremely long documents
(1,000+ words) in a post.  Messages containing attachments will be presumed
to be worm- or virus-carrying and will not be forwarded to the list.

Please do not publish list postings without the express permission of the
author. Posting on the list is a form of publication. Copyright for all
material posted on Poetics remains with the author; material from this list
and its archive may not be reproduced without the author's permission,
beyond the standard rights accorded by "fair use" of published materials.

As an outside maximum, we will accept no more than 2 messages per day from
any one subscriber. Also, given that our goal is a manageable list
(manageable both for moderators and subscribers), the list accepts 50 or
fewer messages per day.

Like all systems, the listserv will sometimes be down: if you feel your
message has been delayed or lost, *please wait at least one day to see if
it shows up*, then check the archive to be sure the message is not posted
there; if you still feel there is a problem, you may wish to contact the
moderators at <poetics@acsu.buffalo.edu>.

i don't desire refurbishment

rearrangement of anyone's basement doormat intact
it is flower's heavy sway how the fuck no rage
predominate o.k. only confusion ?
clarity you said i heard
you opened a door i
there's something wrong with you

funny odd strange horror is
old i saw black shroud last night
& shiver goes & sees things lucid
i said " confusion "
you said " hell's bells mixes help alone "
my love was so true

you want me for what something ?
i imagine any hell i'm due
involvement knows candor when
i don't know a p.o. box # from chairman mao's long march
some hole here all this & want
one night i lay here in the sky

& saw some maybes & what was there before i quit ?
maybe confusion all said maybe not
there's another goddamn letter or more nights somewhere
hesitation pills arrive in pictures
loss needs oxygen to free its' molecular anyway
how is it that it occurs on this place outside & between bodies ?

how devoted withheld glory
fuck these words stuck to the ground
& reinforce tremulous cloud  parades terminal shuffle ?
long gone empty air aspires to
a mistake it always returns before
indispensible logic tells logistics brain

"  digit replacement equals love in a two tiered metropolis "
i saw her eye glow
din of an aeroplane brought nothing
no rhythm
no poems
no nothing

not a goddamn thing
how disgust poetry thievery no escape from sight
buddhism wrong-way street joy ride
cogitate undulate i don't exist
maybe write longer lines is all undone ?
world seen heard felt ill retrieved

no bound at disaster's marvel nearly
instantaneous language accuracy spilt arrows
on going on alongside actual death of blather ?
telegraphic corporeal parameters measured in moans & sighs
exclamatory remarks incendiary pavement
she said everything broken this life

a  space where a door opens & closes
why not make a list of any woman's carnation ?
sky azure vast awhile waves
& just like that
the fucking enemy shows up

He introduced Joe Massey first, who loosened up with some of Leslie &

as a practice& called me on a past =B3no more rhodedendrons=B2 rant.

Corina Copp read from her new chapbook SOMETIMES INSPIRED BY MARGUERRITE

reading style kept everyone on board. Her poems are lesson plans on how to
go to bed still human.

The crowd stayed late, where there were wandering hands, threats of
auto-defenestration, dancing & threats of dancing in the basement. We
retired back to a happening Dirty Frank=B9s, then 260 for a nightcap. Sunday
afternoon, Corina went to see her reflection in Duchamp=B9s urinal at the PMA=

Just wanted to remind everybody that the deadline for the poems about
places contest is midnight on Saturday December 13th.  On the fourteenth,
the voting tallies will begin.  Evrybody who entered the contest can vote
for one OTHER poet's poem, and will hopefully provide criteria for their
choice.  I'm still rather puzzled as to how and who to choose as there
were so many good poems!

Each entrant will get one vote.  Voting tallies will finish by midnight
on December 15, and the winner will be named on the 16th.

Non-entrants can also vote I have decided, but their vote only counts for
half a vote.

You still have several days to enter so that you can have a full vote.
You can vote either front channel or back channel.

====================================
An ex-Black Panther remembers
By Sis. JoNina M. Abron, in Chicago Defender,
3 December 1994

Below is an article written by Sis. JoNina Abron which was published in
the Dec.
3, 1994, issue of the Chicago Defender, commemorating the 25th
anniversary of
the assassinations of Fred Hampton and Mark Clark. The sista who was
interviewed
for the article, Tondalela Woolfolk, died last December. She was 46.
Fred
Hampton and Mark Clark were murdered by Chicago police on December 4,
1969.
________________________________________________________________________

On the morning of Dec. 4, 1969, Tondalela Woolfolk and her fellow Black
Panther
Party members here awoke to learn that their leader, Fred Hampton, and
Mark
Clark, a party organizer from Peoria, had been shot to death by police
in a
pre-dawn raid.

For Woolfolk, then 19, the death of the charismatic Hampton meant "the
loss of
the organization that I had devoted my life to...which meant that a
great part
of my life was gone."

Woolfolk, the second of eight children, grew up on the West Side. As a
teenager,
she was active in an Upward Bound study group where she first heard
about the
Black Power movement that was spreading among militant young Blacks
during the
mid-1960s.

She was also active in the Ecumenical Institute, which ran anti-poverty
programs
on the West Side.

Afer participating in a program for inner-city high school students at
Yale
University, Woolfolk joined the BPP in early 1969 in New York City's
Harlem.
After 21 Black Panthers were charged with conspiring to blow up several
buildings in New York City in April, 1969, police repression of the BPP
escalated. Woolfolk decided to return home.

"I knew everybody [in the Chicago BPP] because these were people from my

community. I went to Providence High School [with several Panthers]...I
knew who
I could trust, who I would be (protected) under fire with. I also knew
the area
better, the physical layout," she said in an interview.

Hampton maintained tight discipline among his charges, said Woolfolk,
who is now
44 and an affirmative action compliance officer for the U.S. Department
of Labor
in Grand Rapids, Mich.

"Fred would call you up at 3:00 and 4:00 in the morning and ask you to
recite
the [BPP] 10-point platform and program [and] if you didn't know it, you
would
be disciplined.

"He was always looking for this alertness. You had to be where you were
supposed
to be at a certain time doing what you were supposed to be doing,"
Woolfolk
said.

The Free Breakfast Program and the Free Health Clinic were two of the
BPP'smost
successful programs here, Woolfolk recalled.

"...[Fred's] emphasis was on building a movement that would tear the
[political]
structure down and put in another more humane, more equitable structure.
His
emphasis was on program-building. That's why the programs were so strong
and
lasted so long even after he died," she says.

Hampton organized a coalition of Black, white and Hispanic youth gangs
in the
area, which Woolfolk described as the "original" rainbow coalition.

"They were beginning to deal with political education. I remember the
meeting
where everybody announced their solidarity with each other at the
People's
Church," Woolfolk said.

The popularity of the BPP community "survival programs" and Hampton's
organization of the gangs brought greater visibility to the Chicago
Panthers. It
also increased the FBI's scrutiny of the group.

According to FBI records, on Nov. 18, 1969, about two weeks before
Hampton was
killed, his name was added to the bureau's "Rabble Rouser Index," a list
of
people whom the FBI said "demonstrated a potential for fomenting racial
discord."

By this time, Hampton's life had been threatened and he was convinced
that "any
minute he was going to be offed," Woolfolk said.

She said Hampton believed there were "agent provocateurs and
infiltrators" in
the party. Shortly before he was killed, Hampton expelled the entire
membership
of the Illinois BPP Chapter, Woolfolk said.

"Fred called a meeting and said everybody was purged until further
notice. I
kind of felt like it was the beginning of the end. It felt awful,"
Woolfolk
said.

After the police raid, Woolfolk went to the apartment at 2337 Monroe
Street,
where Hampton and Clark were killed.

"The blood was what really got me," Woolfolk said. "The mattresses
[where
Hampton had slept] were soaked in blood."

To convince the public that Hampton had been assassinated, Black
Panthers led
hundreds of people on tours of the apartment [for] several days after
the raid.

"There were bullet holes everywhere," Woolfolk said. "You could see how
the cops
[had been] up against the wall and how they had to know where everybody
was
because the bullets were no more than six inches above the cots. They
were
shooting at people who were prone," Woolfolk said.

Chicago police had been "whipped up into this frenzy of fear about the
Panthers," she said.

"It was well known that Panthers were not afraid of 'pigs' [Panther term
for
police]. If you laid your hands on us, we would defend ourselves."

To Woolfolk, Hampton was "a peace-loving, caring individual. I was
horrified at
the violence that was done [to him]. The way [police] paraded his body
afterwards, like he was some kind of prize kill or something.

"It showed their savagery. They had been hunting for this Panther or
that
Panther, or this lion, something that they were afraid of and they had
killed
it," Woolfolk said.

Like many other Chicago Black Panthers, Woolfolk left the party soon
after
Hampton and Clark were killed.

"Until then, it never occurred to me the lengths that people would go to
remain
in power," Woolfolk said.

"They will try to take you off this planet. They took Fred Hampton's
body off
this planet. His spirit and my memory of him will never fade away."

The Panthers said their breakfast programs, health clinics and other
"survival"
programs were created to bring a measure of relief to the lives of poor
blacks
until they would do better.

In the 25 years since Fred Hampton and Mark Clark were killed, the
quality of
life for African-Americans has deteriorated, Woolfolk said.

"Either we get a second life and get up and walk, or we die on the
table," she
said.

"What we should be involved in is setting up survival programs on a
local,
grassroots level following the [BPP] 10-point platform and program.

"Those of us who have the knowledge to identify resources should make
oursevles
available to people in the community."

36 definitive essays by New York arts writer and poet, documenting the
international contemporary art scene. Speaking strongly of an
allegiance to sensual color and stylistic diversity, themes at the core
of this collection are visual pleasure, formal complexity and the
erotics of abstraction.   Subjects include: Norman Bluhm, Shirley Jaffe
and George Sugarman.  Rubinstein looks at postwar European
avant-gardes, long neglected and not understood by the art audience in
America.  And he  turns our attention southward to contemporary Latin
American as well. Rubinstein's writings have helped position the work
of such artists as David Reed, Jessica Stockholder, Fabian Marcaccio,
Jonathan Lasker and Karin Davie. He also draws the reader's attention
to the strong tradition of poet-painter collaboration. Rubinstein's
writing has appeared in Art in America, Flash Art, Arts Magazine,
ArtNews and Artforum and he has written major essays for exhibitions
catalogues for museums in America and Europe.  He was the managing
editor of Flash Art  in Milan and is currently Senior Editor of Art in
America.

Polychrome Profusion is published by Hard Press www.hardpress.org

Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

Dear Friends:

I'm very happy to invite you to a Los Angeles celebration of the poet Carl
Rakosi's 100th birthday. If you're not familiar with Carl's magnificent
work and would like to be, look him up on the internet -- you'll find
numerous examples of his writing, as well as interviews and short prose
texts. I'm excited at the prospect of engaging Carl's poetic practice and
philosophies in the company of other readers and writers, and would be
delighted to see you at Beyond Baroque this weekend.

Warmly,

Jen

A CELEBRATION OF CARL RAKOSI'S WRITING ON THE OCCASION OF HIS 100TH BIRTHDAY
With Carl Rakosi, Wanda Coleman, Tom Devaney, Patrick Durgin, Jen Hofer,
Jerome Rothenberg, and Paul Vangelisti. Carl Rakosi, born in Hungary, moved
to the U.S. in 1910. A key figure in a group of poets who came to
prominence in the 30's, known as the Objectivists - including Charles
Reznikoff, George Oppen, and Louis Zukofsky (who regarded Rakosi as the
lyric poet in the group) and later Lorine Niedecker - Rakosi's poems first
appeared in The Little Review, where Joyce, Eliot, Pound, and Hemingway
were first published, and in Pound's The Exile. Wallace Stevens said about
Rakosi's work: "What excites you most of all is real things. . .actual
objects and people... In short you view the imagination as a foil,
something for contrast." Rakosi has won many awards, including 5 NEA Awards
and a PEN Literary Award and has published 15 books, most recently The Old
Poet's Tale and The Earth Suite (Etruscan Press, available through Small
Press Distribution); Poems 1923-1941 (Ed. Andrew Crozier, Sun & Moon
Press), and The Collected Poems of Carl Rakosi (National Poetry
Foundation). He lives in San Francisco, where he continues to write poetry
and essays.

13 December, Saturday - 1:00 PM

A CONVERSATION WITH CARL RAKOSI AND FRIENDS
It's not often we have the chance to talk in person with a writer who has
been alive - ardently, voraciously, attentively, keenly alive - for an
entire century. Join poet Carl Rakosi along with Tom Devaney, Patrick
Durgin, Jen Hofer, Jerome Rothenberg, and Mark Salerno for a conversation
about a wide range of topics limited only by our imaginations.

Somewhat amused at Mr Gioia's choices to use in a discussion of postwar
British poetry. It's not that I would make a blanket condemnation of the
writers above but rather would point out that it is largely representative
of certain strands in, er, British, I think he means English, culture and
thus is somewhat weakened as a basis for discussing cultural disconnections
as it is based on a somewhat neo-conservative, in literary terms,
representation of 'Brit-glish' poetry. Of the writers above the nearest to a
poetic 'radical' is the late Ted Hughes and that, by any true standard, is a
radicalism that is more of temperament than aesthetic.
If Gioia's list included J.H.Prynne, say, AND Wendy Cope; David Jones AND
Larkin; Geoffrey Hill AND Tom Leonard AND John Cooper Clarke; Peter Reading
AND John Wilkinson AND Denise Riley AND Rosemary Tonks there would, from
such a range, and those are examples only, be the beginning of a frame of
some scope of reference.

Winner of the Gertrude Stein Poetry Award, 2001

"Selected by Dennis Phillips for the 2001 Gertrude
Stein Poetry Award, Letters to Unfinished J. is
comprised of 66 "letters," composed from 1994-1996, in
which poet Sheila Murphy further establishes herself
as a major author of the prose poem. Her text
is equally at home in depths and surfaces that conjoin
as she excavates and questions at multiple levels.
Unexpected images, perceptions, and word combinations
emerge, resulting often in political and societal
critiques. Each of the letters is tightly composed,
highly concentrated, and fraught with motion."

One of our most exciting thinkers explores the look and feel of our cultura=

CONNECTED, or What It Means to Live in the Network Society
Steven Shaviro
University of Minnesota Press | 240 pages | 2003
ISBN 0-8166-4362-8 | hardcover | $49.95
ISBN 0-8166-4363-6 | paperback | $17.95
Electronic Mediations Series, volume 9


Connected is made up of a series of mini-essays=8Bon cyberpunk, hip-hop, fi=
lm
noir, Web surfing, greed, electronic surveillance, pervasive multimedia,
psychedelic drugs, artificial intelligence, and evolutionary psychology,
among other topics. In this breathtaking work, Steven Shaviro investigates
popular culture, new technologies, political change, and community
disruption and concludes that science fiction and social reality have becom=
e
virtually indistinguishable.

Shaviro argues that our strange new world is increasingly being transformed
in ways, and by devices, that seem to come out of the pages of science
fiction, even while the world itself is becoming a futuristic landscape. Th=
e
result is that science fiction provides the most useful social theory, the
only form that manages to be as radical as reality itself.

/Sky Girl/
Rosemary Griggs
$12
0-9713189-8-0
"In her wonderful first collection of poems, many of which trace the post-9/11 experiences of a flight attendant named Kimberlie, Rosemary Griggs shows an astonishing ability to represent the subtleties of a mind in fear. In the poem 'DEN-EWR,' Kimberlie explains to a pilot that her fear of flying is comparable to that of wildebeests on the Discovery Channel who must cross a crocodile infested river 'knowing a few of them will be eaten but the majority of them will make it.' In another poem, she takes an unexpected comfort from the squareness of a patch of grass on which she has chosen to lie down. In its existential accuracy and glamour, /Sky Girl/ reminds me of Knut Hamsun's novel /Hunger,/ or the perilous emotional landscapes of Peter Handke's stories. Griggs's fictive detail, accuracy of idiom, and offbeat cadences lend themselves to the long line: 'It's that you keep saying you're tired makes me want to weep' or 'I said please tell me I won't be mad at you but I need to
know as a girl to a girl please help me out here.' This is that rare book in which the sentences are as beautifully observed as life."*—Paul Hoover*

/"Sky Girl/ is an answer, within an echo, to an earlier generation's /Coffee Tea or Me/ legacy. A fierce and savvy writer, Griggs is by turns whimsical and elegiac, and always very much of this moment."*—Brighde Mullins*

"As tender as a fresh contrail overhead, as spare as a quiet moment along a river. Wry, sexy, introspective, sad, and all the while alert to her absurd perch on the first civilian line of defense against terror, here is a voice that brings sharply forward one uniform we may have taken for granted. 'Coffee, tea,' or, better, let the attendant as poet usher us into the attentive world of /Sky Girl./  With a fine use of found materials, striking images, deft turns on old stories, and sad songs, Rosemary Griggs, who is 'not sure you can have a secret and / also have love' has learned that 'when you're poor you have to be magical,' as many of these absolutely unpretentious and hard won poems prove to be."*—David Hamilton*

Note: I sent a few of the inquiries about Coleridge, Binghamton, and the
confluence of the Chenango and Susquehanna Rivers to a poet friend, Michael Kelly,
who lives in Binghamton.  To find out what he knew, if anything, because I
used to live there, too, and I wanted to know.  This is what he had to say (with
his permission):

AMB

Dear Ann,

     Your paper clips are fascinating, but confusing. I used to do Yoga
and Tai Chi exercises at the confluence, and have found it to be a place
of  Romance. But Romanticism...how would Coleridge know of  Bingham's
lot, the Chenango, or the Susquehanna? What about Priestly at
Susquehanna--the town, the tribe, the river? I don't think that that land
would have been for sale at the time. I'll see if anyone  is still alive
at the Historical Society who might know. Otherwise, I'll have to look it
up. Exciting. Excited.

     Rosemary Waldrop--a poet I have admired; what's she got to do with
all this? Did she make a little chap (is it chap and why?) book about
Clara Schumann? How do I find out?

     Mary  Wollstonecraft--I have written about her and Blake, and their
relative feminism. Did she ever want to buy any of Bingham's land?

     I.M. Pei designed the railing for Binghamton's Memorial Bridge which
overlooks the confluence of the Chenango and Susquehanna rivers.

     General Clinton utilized the two river's junction  as a jumping off
point during an ongoing genocide of the local citizenry.

     Thank you. Please Clara--no clarify, answer questions, or otherwise
respond ASAP as I am intrigued. Bye. Love to you from MJK.




]That is fine. Forward away, but what about the stuff I asked you about
(Priestly, Wollstonecraft, Waldrop)? What was all that? There were just
blurbs and dots. Are they excerpts from the Poetics List? Where is this
list. Who has it now? Who keeps it? Who gets to read
it???????????????????????????????????????

Few utopian communities have survived the rigors and realities of the
human. Shakers: 230; Movers: Zip. Folk Hill is still there, and that's
where my Piano lives.

Clarity and answers. Love and kisses. Bye. Love MJK.xoxoxoxoxoxoxoxoxox

Yup, another good name to conjurate. Or W.S.Grahame, Maggie O'Sullivan,
Trevor Joyce, Bunting, Raworth, Pickard, MacSweeney, Iain Hamilton Finlay,
Edwin Morgan etc etc. I think my point holds: that if Gioia's book aims to
dispel misconceptions about post war British poeytry then presenting a
false, and somewhat cultuarlly safe, version of it does not seem to be the
way to do so.
I hust had a look at the site, to avoid retyping below are some quick
thoughts already posted elsewhere:

the book seems to be strung together from
occasional essays..., it is hard to
read the blurb without suffering from an attack of irony rampant, as the
cluster of writers it focuses on seems to be largely of the kind that have
switched off interest in the States. Interesting that the word novelist is
mentioned, I can't comment on the essay as I haven't seen it but in my mind
it triggers a particular bete-noir: that is that side of the failure of
nerve in some strands of British poetry, and certainly in its 'official'
versions, for example the kind promulgated by Anthony Thwaite's British
Council booklets, partly revolves around a seeking of refuge in the
verisimultude of the realist tradition of the novel, the eye for detail and
its comforting illusions of incontestable actuality. It's not insignificant
that the hinge figure of Larkin was a semi-novelist. I'm toying with names
for it all - how about:

'Dylan Thomas doesn't drink here anymore"

Of course, too, there is a certain parallel to the Fifties and after in
British poetry, post-Dylan and post-Apocalypse Not Now, to the Edwardian
hearties and the Georgians in the great outdoors of their back-gardens,
which was in some respects another retreat to respectablity, that time
post-Wilde.

Dear Ann and all,
The episode is pretty well-documented.  If you read a good biography of
Coleridge or Southey (don't have such an article myself today maybe for
Christmas hint hint Daddy Warbucks)you can learn all about it,
place-names and all.  I think the Pennsylvania connection rings a bell.
Sorry to be so vague.  My rocky memory says no to Binghamton.  I lived
in Ithaca for 3 years and while Binghamton warmed the cockles of my
heart it didn't do it in the particular way it would have if I'd
associated it with Coleridge and Southey and I was closer to remembering
specific details then than now.  All of which goes to show that
scholarship is a noble pursuit, my vague mumblings the worst kind of
self-indulgence, and a big hard-backed biography of Coleridge or his
once good mate Southey must needs be stuffed into my Christmas stocking.
Yours,
Mairead

Note: I sent a few of the inquiries about Coleridge, Binghamton, and the
confluence of the Chenango and Susquehanna Rivers to a poet friend,
Michael Kelly,
who lives in Binghamton.  To find out what he knew, if anything, because
I
used to live there, too, and I wanted to know.  This is what he had to

Dear Ann,

     Your paper clips are fascinating, but confusing. I used to do Yoga
and Tai Chi exercises at the confluence, and have found it to be a place
of  Romance. But Romanticism...how would Coleridge know of  Bingham's
lot, the Chenango, or the Susquehanna? What about Priestly at
Susquehanna--the town, the tribe, the river? I don't think that that
land
would have been for sale at the time. I'll see if anyone  is still alive
at the Historical Society who might know. Otherwise, I'll have to look
it
up. Exciting. Excited.

     Rosemary Waldrop--a poet I have admired; what's she got to do with
all this? Did she make a little chap (is it chap and why?) book about
Clara Schumann? How do I find out?

     Mary  Wollstonecraft--I have written about her and Blake, and their
relative feminism. Did she ever want to buy any of Bingham's land?

     I.M. Pei designed the railing for Binghamton's Memorial Bridge
which
overlooks the confluence of the Chenango and Susquehanna rivers.

     General Clinton utilized the two river's junction  as a jumping off
point during an ongoing genocide of the local citizenry.

     Thank you. Please Clara--no clarify, answer questions, or otherwise

Let's not forget the place that was bought for Marie Antoinette outside of
Wilkes-Barre; I've been shown it (a large building on a hill), but can't
testify to the truthfulness of it. It was intended to be an escape for
her, one which didn't work.

I didn't realise there was confusion about the whereabouts of
Pantisoc-hope-ia, it was  "on some 300,000 acres along the Susquehanna River
north of the small frontier community of Northumberland, Pennsylvania. It
was in this area that Samuel Taylor Coleridge and Robert Southey dreamed and
planned of "Pantisocracy," the idealized community for English lovers of
liberty."

There's a goodish account of the "Northumberland Settlement" at:

Microsoft to cut swastikas from software

Friday, December 12, 2003 Posted:   9:28 AM EST (1428 GMT)


SEATTLE, Washington (Reuters) -- Microsoft Corp. said on Friday that
its latest version of Office software inadvertently contained a font
featuring two swastikas, and said it would offer tools to remove and
replace the offending characters from the program.

The swastika, which was made infamous by Nazi Germany, was included in
Microsoft's "Bookshelf Symbol 7" font. That font was derived from a
Japanese font set, said Microsoft Office product manager Simon Marks.

"It was discovered by one of our customers a couple weeks ago," Marks
said, adding that there was "no indication of malicious intent."

The Redmond, Washington-based software maker said that it had contacted
various Jewish organizations about the font and said a utility would be
immediately available on its Web site that would remove the characters
from the system.

Microsoft said it will release other tools at a later date to remove
only the offending characters.

A form of the swastika has been used in the Buddhist religion to
symbolize the feet or footprints of the Buddha. The symbol, which was
also used widely in the ancient world including Mesopotamia,
Scandinavia, India and the Americas, became common in China and Japan
with the spread of Buddhism.

German dictator Adolf Hitler adopted the swastika as the symbol of the
Nazi Party because of its nationalist identification, according to the
Los Angeles-based Simon Wiesenthal Center, an international Jewish
human rights group.

If this is indeed the location of the Coleridge/Southey land deal,
I have pictures of it, because my gg-grandparents lived and
owned land in the area. Hillsgrove is near the foot of North Mountain,
the escarpment that begins (or ends, if coming south) that line of
"Endless Mountains" that mark the southernmost descent of
the glaciers. It's a very beautiful, and difficult to navigate or farm,
piece of land still.

But if the land was at a confluence of rivers, I'd
guess that it was a bit farther west, in Williamsport, where the
East and West branches of the Susquehanna meet. (This is
supposing that Binghamton is not the site, just for the sake of
conversation).

It seems equally likely that the stories of Priestley's land
deal and Southey's have been conflated, and that Southey's land
might have been at the Susquehanna and Chenango's meeting.
The rootsweb account seemed, like many genealogical constructions,
somewhat confused in its chronology.

Shaviro was my mentor in graduate school.  He's completely brilliant.  He j=

there.  Steve is a genius -- very kind and down deep very fair and just abo=
ut
perfect.  He completely despises George Bush.  When I met him he had just g=
ot
tenure and had dyed his hair green and was wearing a t-shirt with a dinosau=
r on
it.  He tells very good jokes and is curious about everything from string t=
heory
to Yoko Ono (he thinks Ono was the best of the Beatles).

I recommend all his writing, and am glad to see his book make it to this li=
st
thanks to Alan Sondheim.

Graham Foust, AS IN VERY DEAFNESS
(Flood Editions, 2003)

Graham Foust's first collection sounds the depths of need
and loss through narcotics and the bleak interiors of winter.
Although suspended in indefinite, sometimes desperate states of
desire, these spare poems move toward an honest recognition of
the damage incurred: "Welcome, autumn, / to my room / of empty
things. // Welcome to a room / like you."

"Though As in Every Deafness recalls the wintry meditative
intensity of William Bronk, it's a new millennium: 'Our economy
proceeds / as if life were an unlearning.' Graham Foust has an
unerring sense of the exact contours of a particular thought and
is able to express them with mathematical precision and emotional
delicacy; yet pushing against lyric constraint is wildness, uneasiness,
sometimes terror." Susan Howe

MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="iso-8859-1"
Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable

Cuneiform Press is pleased to announce the publication of derek =
beaulieu's "with wax."


"with wax" was published by Coach House Books in 2003. This selection of =
four poems is printed in three colors on a Vandercook 4 letterpress in =
the autumn of 2004 in an edition of 100. Each copy of this oversized =
book-work has been painted by hand & bound in Fabriano wrappers at the =
press. All for the low, low price of ten dollars - including S&H!=20



But wait - there's more! An additional 26 copies will soon be available! =
This edition is printed on 100% rag, hand painted, lettered & signed by =
the author. The cover is printed on suede (that's right - suede) riveted =
through black boards. These go for thirty dollars a pop.



But what's the best part of all? All the funds procured from the sale of =
this title will be donated to the Rare Book School in Charlottesville =
Virginia - an independent, and non-profit center for the history of the =
book and printing since 1983. Donations to RBS, reviews and =
correspondence may be sent directly to the press.=20



Check out some images of this "book" at: http://www.cuneiformpress.com




Fred Wah writes: "The non-sentencing of the poems in with wax releases =
us from the shackles of syntax into the surprise of juncture, double =
exposure and an attention to words and phrases melting and flowing into =
new shapes. The effect is mesmerizing when the excess language pools and =
hardens as 'often syntax penetrates platen streaks . difficult to =
discern.' These are poems you can burn at both ends."



derek beaulieu lives in Calgary where he has been involved in editing =
the magazines dandelion, filling station and endnote. He is the =
editor/publisher of housepress, a micropress dedicated to radical =
poetries and poetics.




Cheers!

for wireless and signed up for tmobile but it's quite expensive. i am
using both cf and sd cards for storage, and have been reading materials
from iran. i had to configure a number of programs and found a small perl
which runs beautifully with my text scripts. i also bought a small rubber
keyboard which will be replaced by a hard plastic infrared one in the near
future. the zaurus synchronizes with the hp laptop running winxp home. i
then sold my mac g3 powerbook and turned my 300 mhz compaq desktop into a
local store to have a new 1.4 motherboard installed with the older 24 gb
hard drives and 200 mhz ram. i had originally tried running redhat 9 and
then fedora on it; both ran impossibly slow, but i liked redhat better.
when the box was returned with the new hardware, including a new video
board as well, i installed redhat 9 again, and it ran well, but was on
occasion producing kernel errors which were forwarded to the root account.
and x window wouldn't run at all until a second video board replaced the
first with considerably more ram. at this point i tried to install
mandrake 9.2 after a bad crash in redhat 9 - i had turned off the machine
without shutdown -h now in text mode and after that x wouldn't come up
except in such a safe mode that a black screen and cursor were all that
remained - and during the install, i went through numerous partitionings,
settling finally on the recommended, after which the error appeared that
no ide devices found, and the install disk wouldn't exit the cdrom tray.
so i tried using the redhat floppy boot disk i made since the formatting
hadn't started, and the floppy drive was also inoperable. the cdrom
install disk had to be manually removed. now that the machine was empty, i
tried rebooting, only to have it stall, not even reaching, as far as i
could tell, the bios, since i couldn't bring the bios up, again getting
the message search for ide devices and coming up empty. so the machine is
back at the shop. meanwhile we installed verizon dsl which went in easily
with ethernet to the hp laptop, and i added a linksys wireless-b, all i
could afford, router instead of the cable; due to my abysmal ignorance,
verizon had to walk me through the desktop configuration. the zaurus
immediately responded well, but in the other room, i found i couldn't
connect an old win 98 desktop because it wasn't se and the software was
problematic if i had managed to get the ethernet card working in the first
place, so this has been put on hold. when all goes well in the future, if
it ever does - azure said i should have bought that 350 usd linux box now
made by hp and she's right - i'll install cinelerra, xmovie, etc.; one of
the biggest problems with linux is the lack of mid-range to low-range
applications for video editing in common formats; i haven't found anything
reasonable for qt yet for example. on the zaurus i've had some luck with
image processing software for still images, but have yet to get any of my
own work to run on it; i've got the older operating system rom at the
moment, and if i upgrade, sharp promises not only will the work be lost,
but the backup/restore function won't work. when i was installing the
verizon software on the hp laptop by the way, one tech advisor completely
gave up and i used the winxp restore to take all of it off and start over,
after which things were at least, although barely, recognized. there's
nothing like restore points as a safety net; too bad we can't do that with
real life. meanwhile i've been working with gimp since on occasion even on
windows photoshop crashes and gimp doesn't, and creating small videos
which are also based, as today's, on drawings completed in a sketch
program for the zaurus; oddly, the zaurus has been quite useful for
content creation. i have given the older dell 600 mhz linux laptop i had,
to my brother, along with the redhat 7 and 8 disks i had; i wasn't able to
configure the orinoco wireless card for it, no matter how i tried. and it
wouldn't work with the mac - not this particular card, according to
orinoco. a third laptop, an old ast at 100 mhz but with 40 megs of ram,
was used for text-based linux, but i finally gave that away, as well as a
small phenom with wince 2.1, slightly upgraded, that had a bad backup
battery and an annoying habit of losing applications as a result. i had
also received an older palm pda which i had configured with numerous
programs; i also gave my brother this one, after i found that the zaurus
did pretty much all i needed. there were no palm applications on the
zaurus of course, but there are several readers that can do the doc and
pdb etc. files, although i stopped short of putting on the emulator, since
there are too many things close to conflicting already at the moment. i
installed the avant browser on the hp laptop which i quite like, as well
as the konqueror browser for the zaurus in addition to the opera which
comes with it, but the former tends to add various cache files while the
opera erases them, and since there is very little ram on the 5500, even
with an optimizer i installed, i tend to use the latter. it's difficult
to configure the linux in the zaurus, since everything seems peculiarly
linked - go in a couple of directories, and you'll find yourself looping
back to root or something that seems awfully similar. i still can't find
the favorites.txt i want to configure for the webcam application; it's got
to be somewhere (the app runs on jeode, zaurus' java environment), but so
far everything's turned up empty. i found zauruszone one of the best sites
for configuration and downloads by the way, although there are numerous
others i use as well. the sony f717 digital camera wouldn't work, by the
way, with redhat 9, no matter what i did; the machine went down before i
had the opportunity to try it with the new board, or with fedora or
mandrake 9.2. i had also installed suse at one point, running off the
cdrom; suse laid down a few files in the linux root directory, and for all
of this naturally the bios had to be changed so that the machine would
boot in the first place from cdrom. i've now got another problem, an older
sparc-like workstation i want to use with my current dell monitor, but the
workstation has a four-bnc output cable, and the dell monitor, a five-bnc
input; i'm not sure what to connect where and am a little bit worried
about overloading either voltage or scan rate. for the zaurus, i also
bought an extra battery and a small device which takes 4 nimh rechargables
- down below 6 volts, which might harm the power supply, but the zaurus
has difficulties recognizing the latter, and the zaurus' apm command and
graphic power meter is incredibly primitive and useless - although i heard
it's better on the newer rom - the one i mentioned is only one of several,
but i'm really tiring of configuring things - there are times i've
installed linux say 7-8 times of an evening, and need to have some sort of
stable environment to work in, which seems a long time coming, now that
the refurbished desktop is back in the shop again.

Palestinian poet Fadwa Touqan dead at 86=A0

NABLUS, West Bank (Reuters) - Fadwa Touqan, revered among Palestinians=20=

as the "Poet of Palestine", died on Friday in the West Bank. She was 86.

Her writings, popular across the Arab world, focused on themes ranging=20=

from romance to resistance against Israeli occupation.

In one poem, "Waiting at the Alleby Bridge", Touqan wrote of the=20
humiliation Palestinians feel undergoing Israeli security checks at the=20=

border crossing between Jordan and the West Bank.

"Miserable eyes, waiting, begging to pass," she wrote.


The Wandering Dove

Fadwa Touqan
I wander everywhere, a frightened dove,
Displaced, denied, and deprived of love :
Snakes always coil to block my path,
Hissing, menacing, and full of wrath;
And hounds, chasing me, continue to bark,
So that my memory of love is pale, dark.
The images of my dreams are lost, worn,
And I always seem to tread on thorn!
Night has slaughtered my moon;
And in nightmares I writhe and swoon:
The Zionists robbed the stars of my night,
And nobody cares about my painful plight.
Ghosts tear my heart as I bitterly cry,
And the indifferent world never wipes my eye!

If this is indeed the location of the Coleridge/Southey land deal,
I have pictures of it, because my gg-grandparents lived and
owned land in the area. Hillsgrove is near the foot of North Mountain,
the escarpment that begins (or ends, if coming south) that line of
"Endless Mountains" that mark the southernmost descent of
the glaciers. It's a very beautiful, and difficult to navigate or farm,
piece of land still.

But if the land was at a confluence of rivers, I'd
guess that it was a bit farther west, in Williamsport, where the
East and West branches of the Susquehanna meet. (This is
supposing that Binghamton is not the site, just for the sake of
conversation).

It seems equally likely that the stories of Priestley's land
deal and Southey's have been conflated, and that Southey's land
might have been at the Susquehanna and Chenango's meeting.
The rootsweb account seemed, like many genealogical constructions,
somewhat confused in its chronology.

FOR THE HARD ONES: A LESBIAN PHENOMENOLOGY
PARA LAS DURAS: UNA FENOMENOLOGIA LESBIANA
by/por tatiana de la tierra
Cover art by Maya Gonzalez.

FOR THE HARD ONES/PARA LAS DURAS is a lesbian celebration written in
Spanish
and English.

This philosophical exploration of the fantasy of being a lesbian is a
poetic
vision from the heart of the matriarchy. FOR THE HARD ONES/PARA LAS
DURAS
looks at different aspects of lesbianism, from the fingernails and the
tongue to the literature and the herstory. A lesbian manifesto for
hardcore
dykes, baby dykes and wanna-be lesbians.

"De la Tierra's poetry, with its humor and penchant for repetition,
lends
itself to performance, and while it philosophizes on lesbianism her work
is
still accessible to a general audience. Highly recommended for public
and
academic libraries with collections of poetry and gay/lesbian studies. "

AS OUR BARRIO TURNS...WHO THE YOKE B ON? by alurista
With cover art and book design by Sal Barajas.

alurista poet-filetero filÛsofo snaps shots of his singular history in
wickedly funny, blasphemous travelogues through his youth and activist
days.
He twists our tongues in the vernacular that we as Chicano Mexicanos
find
snugly familiar and exhilarating. alurista summons nostalgia like those
brown or black and white faded photos which our jefitas and tÌas dust
off
for the holiday family get-togethers. His scrapbook leapfrogs from
military
academy in MÈxico to militant politics in ë60ís San Diego, boyhood
challenges of Catholic dogma, adult challenges in building a Chicano
cultural movement and on.

ìPick up your Neo-Aztec battle armour and get ready to rumble in a
vortex of
language corridos and time-space slippage. Here are the lost codices of
Xicano Being reclaimed in Alurista's unchained automythographical codes

"She is chanteusse, diva, storyteller, rebelde, rabblerouser, and all
poeta.
The pages of Razor Edges are filled with the voices of the women next
door,
las comadres who work, live and struggle in the barrio. Leticia engages
her
reader throughout; she's questioning and challenging, and knows exactly
when
to weave in her song. To read Leticia's chapbook is to experience tongue
twisting, bilingual, meaningful mouthfuls of reality. It's like sitting
in a
cafÈ, smelling the burnt and provocative aroma, and sipping the foam of
a
rich warm beverage."
- Elba Rosario S·nchez, When Skin Peels

"Leticia Hern·ndez gives voice to a generation that is culturally
kaleidoscopic, urban-edgey, and infused with the spoken
resistance-sensibility of the hip hop generation. But she is mindful of
history, too: in these poems the past sings harmony with the present.
There
is something of Roque Dalton, the late great revo Salvadoran bard, in
these
lines (of course!), with a dash of the beats and then the Beat of the
Postmodern Bass that keeps the proceedings anchored rhythmically &
thematically. It is a rousing performance -- as raucous on the page as
Leticia is on stage."

SANTA PERVERSA AND OTHER EROTIC POEMS by alejandra ibarra
Cover art by Adriana Y. Gallego.

"Self love. Power. Shamelessness. Sexual curiosity. All of these are
elements of the erotic that alejandra ibarra invokes in these poems.
They
speak to a yearning, a jonesin', a hunger that feeds Chicana
spirituality
and sexuality. The poems in this collection are located at the crux of
experience, imagination and expression... Their lyricism invokes the
rhythm
of the clave beat, as well as the repetition of a lover's
whispers...ibarra
creates new models for talking about love within Chicana feminist
discourse.
Santa Perversa is one incarnation of a new subjectivity."
- From the Forward by Eliza Rodriguez y Gibson.

"San Valentin is finished: enter La Santa Perversa, the new name for
desire."

APOCALYPSE MANANA: Opera ElectrÛnica for the New Millenium
A new genre defying spoken word audio CD by pioneer performance artist
Guillermo GÛmez-PeÒa  and composer  Guillermo Galindo

"This is old-fashioned West Coast vision and prophecy time-warped into a
future of digital polyculturalism that's already here. GÛmez-PeÒa
speaks,
shouts, whispers, and gushes in forked and curled tongues... Galindo
surrounds him in cut-up sound clouds of opera, speed metal, and urban
noise
-a jagged electro-ambience that converts the Hotel California into "la
mansiÛn de la muerte." These are chants for ethnic robots, rituals for
post-millennial Mexican, and balms for the identity beleaguered. In
other
words, it's fantasy and paranoia and hope and it comes in any language
you
want to make up."

Cuneiform Press is pleased to announce the publication of derek =
beaulieu's "with wax."


"with wax" was published by Coach House Books in 2003. This selection of =
four poems is printed in three colors on a Vandercook 4 letterpress in =
the autumn of 2004 in an edition of 100. Each copy of this oversized =
book-work has been painted by hand & bound in Fabriano wrappers at the =
press. All for the low, low price of ten dollars - including S&H!=20



But wait - there's more! An additional 26 copies will soon be available! =
This edition is printed on 100% rag, hand painted, lettered & signed by =
the author. The cover is printed on suede (that's right - suede) riveted =
through black boards. These go for thirty dollars a pop.



But what's the best part of all? All the funds procured from the sale of =
this title will be donated to the Rare Book School in Charlottesville =
Virginia - an independent, and non-profit center for the history of the =
book and printing since 1983. Donations to RBS, reviews and =
correspondence may be sent directly to the press.=20



Check out some images of this "book" at: http://www.cuneiformpress.com




Fred Wah writes: "The non-sentencing of the poems in with wax releases =
us from the shackles of syntax into the surprise of juncture, double =
exposure and an attention to words and phrases melting and flowing into =
new shapes. The effect is mesmerizing when the excess language pools and =
hardens as =91often syntax penetrates platen streaks =85 difficult to =
discern.=92 These are poems you can burn at both ends."



derek beaulieu lives in Calgary where he has been involved in editing =
the magazines dandelion, filling Station and endnote. He is the =
editor/publisher of housepress, a micropress dedicated to radical =
poetries and poetics.

The power of a twisted symbol.

The Christian cross is the symbol of a slow, very painful, death. The empty
cross seemingly waits for its worshipper, or wearer, to mount it. It is not
a symbol of resurrection, but wrongful death. One wonders why the millions
of people who wear one don't examine its implications. It's ubiquitous
symbol that's literally empty of meaning. Better to wear a fish instead.
Although they're disappearing too.

Musings


Take any chain of N unit vectors mutually orthogonal. The chain is defined
such that at most two vectors meet at any vertex, and the endpoints are
necessarily disparate. Then the chain defines a unique measure polytope of
dimension N. The length of the chain = N, and if N is the maximum chain in
any space, then N is the dimension of that space.

Connect the two endpoints of the chain. Then the length of the connection
is N^1/2, and the vector is a major diagonal of the measure polytope.
Connect the endpoints of any two adjacent vectors; the length is 2^1/2.
Connect the endpoints of any X adjacent vectors, and the length is X^1/2.

If the dimension is N create a table such as:
1 2 3 4 5 6
6 5 4 3 2 1 . There are 6 vectors of length 1, 5 diagonals of length
2^1/2, down to 1 diagonal of length 6^1/2. In three dimensions
1 2 3
3 2 1
and the total defines the number of edges of a tetrahedron embedded in a
cube (6 of course), such that for any dimension N, E = (N+1)(N)/2 for the
number of edges. Note that these tetrahedrons are only regular when N = 1.

The point of the exercise is that the awkwardness of the chain resolves
quickly when the diagonals are added in; clearly the chain forms a
tetrahedron of dimension N within a stable measure polytope; the diagonals
create strength and stability, and the chain itself is embedded and
comfortable with its new surroundings.

Does anyone have an e-mail address for Clayton Eshleman?
I'm working on cave art and French poetry and have a question
or two for him.

Thanks,
Sasha

Even more, it is a *heathen* tradition to worship idols and to engage in
idolatry. Christians of faith do not wear crosses 'as symbol,' or any
other idols for that matter (like a fish). The whole point of
Christianity is to leave idolatry behind to follow the true God.

Ok, the voting has begun on the places contest.  So far I have only one
vote tallied.  This vote is for Skip Fox.

The voting works like this -- you can vote for anybody except yourself,
and you get one full vote if you entered a poem in the contest, and half
a vote if you didn't.

The voting will end at midnight tomorrow night on Monday (I'm figuring
that a lot of people can only open their email from school, so I wanted
to give Monday to vote).

I'm now going to offer some commentary on selected poems, because I
actually like to read commentary on poetry better than poetry (this is
weird, I know, but I love commentary, even in basketball, again more than
the game itself) -- and this is partially an attempt to bring out the
commentator in others -- I'll announce my vote at the end --

I found it hard to judge because quite frankly there was an embarrassment
of riches.  I was very happy to receive Francis Raven's two poems right
away to open the contest.  I read them very carefully, and then did a web
search for this poet, and found out that we both went to Evergreen State
College and that he/she (there appear to be this name listed as a poet
under both genders, but maybe this is two separate poets, or maybe we're
back to the transgender conversation):  I especially liked Bayview
Wetland -- this poem reopens the question of whether an objective reality
exists and whether we can know it aside from language -- a conversation
dear to many.  Does the SF Bay Wetland have an independent existence
outside of Francis Raven's poem?

"95 percent of SF bay wetlands destroyed.
Bay also a third smaller.
Where did that water go?"

I like the factual data (is all date theory-determined?), followed by the
lyrical question.

2.  Because I am not Canadian I didn't get the references in Rob
McLennan's poem.  I don't know the manx pub, and don't watch hockey, and
don't know Kathleen Edwards, so couldn't grasp this poem, but I could
picture the snow and the cold in the accompanying letter.

3.  Keri Thomas' Buffalo-oriented poems -- I could picture coming closer
to town and the radio getting clearer.  That was a strong image

4.  Martha Deed's poem on Bowmansville was great -- nice jumps, with good
precise details, and interesting humor at the end.

5.  I wondered if Ken Rumble's poem about Lyme was where the Lyme's
Disease came from.  I didn't understand the last line about leaning due
to hills, but I guess they are walking on the sides of hills and trying
to compensate.

This is the level on which I read many of the poems.  I didn't take it to
a larger theoretical level.  I read them for information, but was
delighted by Kevin Hehir's funny formatting, and was delirious about
hsn's list of leaping names.  Samaria!

Also, some of the poems left out a lot of information.  Mairead Byrne's
poem leaped some thirty years and I needed the interim info, but it made
me wonder about the caesura there.

Rosalie Calabrese's poem I tried some theory on -- it's about an
individual on Fire Island in mid-summer.  You get a plover (what's that?
I know it's a kind of bird, but I don't think it's a symbol of anything,
but the ending is a kind of merger with the shore line -- where land and
sea intermingle.  Also, there is a boom box that interrupts -- could this
be intermingling of races (I'm assuming Calabrese is Italian from the
name, and the boom box is African American, but it needn't be) there
might also be gender in this, or even class.  Plus you could do an
ecological reading of it.  Somehow I loved the merger in the end -- it
was quite lovely.

But I'm voting for Michael Rothenberg -- his leaps are the weirdest while
maintaining a perfect tone -- the poem seems almost anonymous and yet
personal  -- opening with a fear of death, but you get Miami Vice type
images -- "lightning/ pasted on black sky, high-rise hotels"  and
"blighted palms, coral ruins" -- so there's an interweaving of a huge
theme with very precise details, plus fear of death and failure to live
until career completion mixed with love -- for Erika.  The poem leaps
like an atomic grasshopper, huge leaps.  It made me want to read this
poet's whole work.

At any rate, thanks to everybody for sending these poems.  If I was to
edit a journal called Geography & Poetry, I would put all these poems in.

I hope others will vote.  Right now there is one vote for Skip Fox's
strange prose poem on Arizona (he doesn't like it), and one for Michael
Rothenberg on Miami.  Perhaps we are drawn to the heat!  It's going to
snow two feet in the Catskills today.

I'll announce the overall winner on Tuesday at some point.

Subject:        Places Contest Voting Begins
Ok, the voting has begun on the places contest.  So far I have only one
vote tallied.  This vote is for Skip Fox.

The voting works like this -- you can vote for anybody except yourself,
and you get one full vote if you entered a poem in the contest, and half
a vote if you didn't.

The voting will end at midnight tomorrow night on Monday (I'm figuring
that a lot of people can only open their email from school, so I wanted
to give Monday to vote).

I'm now going to offer some commentary on selected poems, because I
actually like to read commentary on poetry better than poetry (this is

Mainstream Christian thought on iconography sees Jesus as a theophany of Go=
d -- or as a representation of God on earth (this is not to say that he lac=
ked substance, as he was also a man, and suffered as a man) but that since =
God had Himself made a representation or a likeness, that it is therefore p=
ermissable for us to do so as well.  This is a very troubled history of cou=
rse, and I mostly know only the Lutheran side of it, and some of the postmo=
dernist Catholic Pierre Klossowski's take on
this.  Sergei Michalski -- a Polish scholar -- has an excellent book on som=
e of the various Christian positions in regards to iconography.  Orthodox J=
ews take literally the first commandment to Moses against imagery of any ki=
nd.  Many Christians do not take it literally.  Luther specifically counter=
manded it and said that art and artists were free to do exactly as they lik=
ed, and that art had nothing to do with theology or salvation, that they we=
re in separate categories.  This is an immense
tradition encompassing thousands and thousands of books -- and all kinds of=
 schisms and splits and loopholes.  Augustine and Tertullian are two of the=
 most interesting commentators, but even to fully understand one of them is=
 a lifetime's work.  -- Kirby

Joel quoted:
..|  All theism is idolatry...


What use are idols to those who have faith? Indeed, if you are justified
by idols then you have your reward. (God is not mocked.)

A reading of the very short Galatian letter (in the NT, only 3-4 pages)
explains this with clarity.

Dear readers,

    Well as this year is drawing to a close I just want to thank all of
you for the emails and support I have received in the past year and
since the release of Five Years of Solitary.  It has been an incredible
journey so far and I hope you have enjoyed the ride.  If  you haven't
purchased the book as of yet...hopefully you will soon and they make the
perfect stocking stuffers, at $10.95 its equivalent to a drink or two
depending where you live and you don't have to worry about waking up
hung over next to someone you have to throw out the morning after.  You
will just have my words.  You know I had to throw the plug in there.
     Well if you enjoyed Five Years of Solitary, you will enjoy  my
second book which is scheduled for a Summer 2004 release.  I have been
busy at work on it and working on several photo shoots for the website
and promotion for the upcoming book.  The second book is a continuation
of FYS (September 1999-Present). Thatís all I will mention for now...the
rest I will keep a mystery until the Summer. So be  sure to return to
the website soon.  New content, photos, and sections will be added early
in the new year.
    Be sure to check out the new issue of QV Magazine.
http://qvmagazine.com/qv31/
They interviewed me and we spoke about Five Years of Solitary, love,
relationships, my likes and dislikes and everything else in between.  It
can purchased nationwide at retailers such as (Tower Records, Barnes &
Noble, Borders, Hastings, and Books million).
    Happy Holidays and may you have a happy and healthy New Year.

Much Love,

Lauryn Hill disses Da Pope

By Philip Pullella

VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - American singer Lauryn Hill, from a stage used
by the Pope, shocked Catholic officials at a concert by telling them to
"repent" and alluding to sexual abuse of children by U.S. priests.

The broadside came during the recording Saturday night of a Christmas
concert attended by top Vatican (news - web sites) cardinals, bishops
and many elite of Italian society, witnesses said.

Hill made her comments when taking the microphone to sing at the
concert, held in the same huge hall and stage Pope John Paul (news - web
sites) uses for his weekly general audiences and other events. The Pope
was not present.

"I did not come here to celebrate the birth of Christ with you but to
ask you why you are not in mourning for his death inside this place,"
she said according to a transcript of her statement run by the Rome
newspaper La Repubblica.

A spokesman for Prime Time Productions, the concert's organizers, said
the newspaper's quotes were accurate.

"God has been a witness to the corruption of his leadership, of the
exploitation and abuses ... by the clergy," she said.

This was an apparent reference to the scandal in the United States last
year over the sexual abuse of children by priests.

Hill told the crowd to seek blessings "from God not men" and said she
did "not believe in representatives of God on earth."

A few feet away in the front row sat five cardinals, including Edmund
Szoka, American governor of Vatican City.

Hill, 28, did not sing the song listed on the program but instead sang a
song about social injustice.

Organizers said Hill's outburst and performance would most probably be
cut from the show when it is aired on Christmas Eve.

Hill shot to fame in the mid-1990s with band The Fugees, whose album
"The Score" sold 17 million copies, to become one of the biggest hip-hop
chart successes of all time.

She went on to win five Grammy awards for her debut solo album, "The
Miseducation of Lauryn Hill." She has a son and daughter by Rohan
Marley, the son of Reggae legend Bob Marley.

Realizing that new lineations and a newer comma notwithstanding, I =
flouted the rules of engagement by sending "a truly old poem indeed," I =
nevertheless offer the following as my personal criterion for selection =
- a poem about place in cadence and form need embody the ineffable =
character of said place, without lapsing into the symbolic (so the =
cheesesteakness of Philadelphia would not work but how faucets in a =
Peorian summer are wrung tighter than a cow's ass in flytime might). By =
that code, my ballot reads: Michael Rothenberg (with Kevin Hehir as vice =
president).=20

Incidentally, does anyone have Williams, "A Place (Any Place) to =
Transcend All Places," written in reply to Stevens's "Description =
without Place," handy?=20

More or less in a finished state (there is though a map near the middle with
its legends not yet in attendance) is a middling-long poem/ poem-sequence by
my good, bad or indifferent self, entitled, um, Parousia. It's almost a
detective story, except .... and could be seen as something metaphysical,
but for .... while there is case for arguing that it .... it certainly
though is ....

There are occasions on which it rhymes. But fortunately few.

Aaron,

            Apples

Apples amply fall.
Folderol.
Apples fall amply
Foldimply.

Hooray!
Politics as usual
In play.

Imply apples fall
Folderol.
Apples amply fall.

So let's sit
and chomp.

I have several more if interested - I'm teaching her a word a day.

The following poem was inspired by a

The voting at 4:59 pm on Monday is:

Skip Fox 1
Michael Rothenberg 3
Martha Deed 1

I hope others will still vote, but I am going home now and won't count them until tomorrow.  I am particularly interested in other viewpoints in terms of criteria.  I liked all the poems, but limited my discussion of them simply because I find it difficult to read long posts in cyberspace, so was trying to be brief.  I could have written twenty pages on most of the poems, I'm sorry to say.  I just love to comment!  I hope this calls forth the commentator in others, yet.  I loved the Nyack poem yesterday -- the blinking yellow lights -- I cross through Nyack whenever
I hit NYC and love the great Catholic church up on the hill to the left as you cross the bridge from West to East.  I even love how decrepit it looks.

".....at a time when I am speaking to you about the paradox of desire -- in
the
sense that different goods obscure it -- you can hear outside the awful
language
of power.  There's no point in asking whether they are sincere or
hypocritical,
whether they want peace of whether they calculate the risks.  The dominating
impression as such a moment is that something that may pass for a prescribed
good; information addresses and captures impotent crowds to whom it is poured

forth like a liquor that leaves them dazed as they move toward the slaughter
house.
One might even ask if one would allow the cataclysm to occur without first
giving
free reign to this hubbub of voices...."

THE ESCAPE
by Jo Ann Wasserman
ISBN: 0-9716800-2-7
$14.00 | Paper | 136 Pages
Poetry/Prose

Order online from Small Press Distribution at:
http://www.spdbooks.org
http://www.futurepoem.com/bookpages/escape.html

The Escape is book #3 in the Futurepoem series, selected by 2002/03
editors Brenda Coultas, Anselm Berrigan, Laird Hunt and Dan Machlin.

"In these brilliant sestinas of assemblage and their tenuous enkomion
asides, the reader is taken/taking place, as if in detailed alignment
with the poet-family footage scattered over the floor and glued back
warily as Wasserman constructs her map of escape from that loving
tyranny.  An extraordinary first book in which every utterance is
compelled by the imagination's fleeing from the known."
- Kathleen Fraser

"The Escape is a kinetic maelstrom in which Wasserman's attention is
always laconic and precise...a calmly breathless, run-on sentence that
gathers information at every instant, while careening downhill...prose
where diary and fiction slip around each other...a music that is
intoxicating and unmistakable in its honoring of the turbulence of
being alive in the not so distant present, past and future."
- John Yau

"There is much at stake in this book: 'motherhood, fortune, providence,
the stars and then depression...the false Italy' or false anything vs.
a real me or you.  This book is 'round, soft, sad, expensive,
pink'...it is also dark, sharp-limbed, heart-wrenching, hilarious and
smart.  Kafka once declared ' A book must be the axe for the frozen sea
within us.' In form and in content, this is one of the bravest books of
poetry I've read."
- Eleni Sikelianos

JO ANN WASSERMAN is the author  of two chapbooks of poetry "What Counts
As Proof (Sugarbooks) and "We Build Mountains" (a+bend press).  Her
work has appeared in The World, Grand Street, can we have our ball
back? and The East Village.  She is the former Managing Editor of How2,
an online journal of innovative writing by women, and former Program
Coordinator at The Poetry Project at St. Mark's Church. She recently
earned an M.F.A. in poetics from the New College of California and
currently lives in New York City where she works for Granary Books.

Subject:      response to Silliman's blog
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="iso-8859-1"
Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable

Dear Ron, I e-mailed you a private response to your remarks (on your =
blog) about my parents and about my writing. You did not respond. So I =
will give the gist of my reply here. I pointed out to you that you are =
misrepresenting my father's views and nature. You've attacked him to =
other poets many times during the time I have known you, over twenty =
years. On your blog, you portrayed him as a right-winger. My father is =
and was always a supporter (and even active in) the Civil Rights =
movement. He supports Affirmative Action. He has always favored women's =
rights and job equality for women. He is not a sexist. He is pro-choice. =
He opposed the Gulf War, the recent war on Afghanistan, the present war =
on Iraq. He opposes the Israeli treatment of Palestinians. He voted =
against Reagan, against papa and baby Bush. A person with the politics I =
just described can't be called right-wing in America. Further, he is a =
good father.

                Two friends responded to your comments about my parents: =
One stated that months ago you were attacking my father to this =
particular friend who thought "it was dirty" since, they maintained, =
what does that have to do with Leslie Scalapino or with poetry? I am not =
my father and can't change his views. Nor can I change your views. I =
asked you: Could you change your father's views? Is your life his?

                The other friend who commented said: "They (Watten and =
Silliman) are not attacking your father they're attacking you." I think =
this is accurate. You're searching for a way to disparage the writing. =
You once said to me: "You are conservative." I have never been =
conservative and I will not be so limited.

                You've got an abusive father complex and should consider =
that in yourself and dispel it (as should Watten), and not try to find =
an excuse to go after a woman doing the work,  while you hold her =
responsible for your sense of another man's life, decisions, and views, =
who is not herself. You place him in front of her and seek to undermine =
her as him. Although you yourself have tremendous anger, perhaps for =
perfectly good reasons (nor am I disparaging anger, which is phenomena =
only, neither absurd nor criminal), you define my writing, thus limiting =
it, as being detailing of the emotion of anger, every sense of insult =
and humiliation. As I described to you: Particularly in earlier writing, =
I was strongly influenced by Gandhi's views of non-violence and I sought =
to make writing which peeled apart social formations in the instant of =
their forming, or before they form, without leaving them out of the =
writing, thus including the emotion of anger and including =
pre-conceptions. By entering the action of reading, the reader is in it =
seeing there is no such generalization as "humiliation" in the sense =
that: that which is coming from others is not oneself. My gesture is: to =
undercut force by not basing the writing on a stance of 'strength' even, =
except that which arises from the act of attention.

                One other person made a comment to me about your blog: =
"Ron Silliman seems to be like a right-wing commentator on one of those =
right-wing talk shows. He says he is left-wing but he demonstrates no =
goals, beliefs, or actions that are left-wing."

The Department of Theatre, Film and Creative Writing at the University of
British Columbia invites applications for a tenure-track Assistant
Professor in the writing of poetry. An MFA or related graduate degree, or
an MA or PhD with a major component in Creative Writing, is essential. The
candidate should have a record of excellence in teaching in Creative
Writing, a significant publication record which should include no less
than three books of poetry, and an impressive history of public readings.



The candidate should have a genuine interest in a wide variety of poetic
styles and techniques in order to deal with the diversity of work from
students at the graduate and undergraduate levels in the Creative Writing
Program at UBC. A demonstrated capacity to translate work from other
literary traditions and an ability to use translation as a tool for the
development of writing techniques would be useful: previously this
position has involved teaching literary translation. A further interest or
experience in editing and managing a literary magazine would be an asset
because the successful candidate might eventually be expected to
contribute as Advisory Editor to our literary magazine, PRISM
international.



We offer workshops in the writing of poetry, fiction, non-fiction,
children’s literature, literary translation, screen & TV, stageplay, lyric
and libretto, and radio play and features. Please consult the Program
website www.creativewriting.ubc.ca for details.



This position is subject to funding, and salary will be commensurate with
qualifications and experience. Applicants should send a letter of
application along with their curriculum vitae (including e-mail address
and telephone numbers), list of publications, teaching experience,
readings and all related experience, and should forward three reference
letters from national, and, ideally, international, sources (including at
least one from a senior academic) to Chair, Search Committee for Poetry,
Creative Writing Program, The University of British Columbia, Buchanan
E-462 –1866 Main Mall, Vancouver, BC, Canada, V6T 1Z1. If sending by
courier the address is Buchanan E-462 – 1866 East Mall, Vancouver, BC,
Canada V6T 1Z2. Complete applications and letters must be received by 28th
January, 2004. The position start date is January 1st, 2005.



The University of British Columbia hires on the basis of merit and is
committed to employment equity. We encourage all qualified persons to
apply; however, Canadians and permanent residents of Canada will be given
priority. Applications should identify citizenship and immigration status.

Dear Poetics:

As a poetics list reader for almost three years (usually without much to add
or post) and as a reader who initially read every post (every post!) for a
month, I want to report that Leslie Scalapino's post from today woke me up from
my reticence (if that's what it is) or woke me along the lines of writing
(perhaps what I write or why I write or how I write) and also: along the lines of
our fathers.

I, too, had a good father, and now he is dead.  He died in 1992, while I was
still studying at University of Houston in the Ph.D./M.F.A. program in
fiction.  He was a chief ally in my writing, in endeavor itself.  On one of our
Saturdays he called and asked, "Do you know who this Clarice Lispector is?"  He had
started riding the bus, tired of his two-hour commute from the suburbs, and
wanting the exercise of walking.  He had befriended, while reading fiction by
women authors on the bus, a man who was a translator of Clarice Lispector, who
rode the bus to the U of Minnesota.  Yes, I had heard of her; I had even
taught her.  I was thinking, Lispector is too weird for my father to be mentioning
on the phone and, people at my school don't even know much about her, yet he
does.  He had traveled on business several times to South America and had taken
Spanish before the trips to be able to participate.  These are things I left
out of my self-presentation in Houston.  Rarely were the descriptions of
people's fathers complicated.  Each woman said it once, and everyone remembered it
forever:  "doctor," "movie producer," "came over on the Mayflower."  I was
quiet on the topics of the past probably because I had already written a novella
based on childhood and thought I was done with that.

By the next summer (1991) I had been scouring for "guides," books that would
let me categorize something I had been writing myself.  I wanted to know that
what I was writing WAS categorizable, not that it wasn't, because I was having
a breakdown writing it.  I felt that just knowing that it belonged somewhere
in a tradition would help me buck up (under the scrutiny of the class who had
categorized my short stories as "experimental").  No one else was having a
breakdown while attending.  Later I heard that one woman had had a breakdown (and
been to the hospital) after an Illinois state supreme court ruling against
her for having used someone's real first name in one of her short stories and a
man had had a novelist's breakdown during a fellowship year.

Years afterward, well out of it, I found, a little late, Lispector's
CRONICAS, a collection of short "intimate" essays published in a major Brazilian
newspaper, Journal do Brazil (collected and translated decades later by New
Directions).  Perhaps what I wrote in the early 1990s was most like that, though I
had written without an audience, and she had written for a huge audience,
Saturday readers.

My father was a microbiologist who visited my fourth-grade class to teach the
children about germs, about how germs collect on their fingers, even after
they wash, and how these germs incubated in petri dishes and grown in augur
sprout fungal clouds, each one a little different like fingerprints.  He handed
back the kids' germs in the petri dishes on a return visit (the dirtiest of the
kids, the baddest of the boys, did not seem riled then by their overgrowths;
they thought their germs were THE coolest because the MOST or the BIGGEST).
This is the type of memory I wonder about in considering autobiography now:  If
the children grown were to remember my father's visit to the school, would
they remember it as a dirty trick or as a lesson: Germs are all around us,
washing only does away with some of them, and some germs are even good or normal.
For a prize, he gave each kid a bottle of Tame cream rinse that he had brought
in a box from his company, Gillette.  He was inventing Fathers-in-the-Schools.
 He was not doing evil university research or stashing the kids' germs or
itemizing them in any way.  It was a lab science lesson before we were quite old
enough to have lab science.

As it happens, I have been reading Leslie Scalapino's AUTOBIOGRAPHY this very
week, and I have been filled with the images and vivid scenes of it, even
though they are so economically traced.  The father, in fact:  When he speaks, he
SOUNDS in it.  Ellen Goodman published a column about stiletto shoes last
week, reminding every one of footbinding.  The column ends, "Ginger Roger did
everything Fred Astaire did, but she did it backwards in high heels."  Goodman
does not connect, as Scalapino does in her autobiography, that a foot-bound
woman was of a higher class, perhaps never intended to labor.  Perhaps footbinding
protected her from ever having to labor and was meant almost as an "excuse"
not to labor.  There is a foot-bound laboring woman in the autobiography,
someone too old who has somehow slipped out of her class.

From Silliman's blog about Scalapino's Autobiography:

[Scalapino's] Autobiography is for all its marvels also an accounting of
every slight, each humiliation, especially in/of childhood.

When I found these notes at Silliman's blog two months ago or so, I was
looking for references to Scalapino as also a fiction writer (references that had
been coming out recently).  His sentence excited me.  I felt familiar enough
with her poetic mind and positions, and I wanted to read what "angry"
autobiography was in her hands.  Reading it this week, I couldn't remember where I had
read that about the Autobiography.  I wasn't feeling it the way I had looked
forward to it being, full of each slight.  There are mentions of responses to
racist teachers in the public school and of hurt emotions that make the young
author fight tears in school -- emotions caused by having felt free while
traveling, even when in a baking-hot poverty zone, by comparison to being caught in
a structured place "at home."  These don't read as "slight" to me; they read
as constructing how a sensitive person responds early on to slights against
others or as empathy.

Subject:      which '03 journal was Jackson Mac Low's Stein piece in?
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

Out of the many, many literary journals I've bought
this year, most of them through spdbooks.org, there
was one that had sections from Jackson Mac Low's
recent Gertrude Stein ~Tender Buttons~ re-working.

---But, for the life of me, no matter how I'm
rummaging through my stacks of '03 journals, I can't
seem to determine which journal it was in.

Does anyone happen to recall which '03 journal it
might've been that published that Mac Low?

Thanks.  (Front-channel preferred, please.)

Jeffr

Spawned last January, SDPG (http://sdpg.blogspot.com) is pleased to
announce the 1st Annual Year in Ideas: Bright notions, bold inventions,
genius schemes & mad dreams that took off (or tried to) in 2003.

With the year now drawing to a close, the San Diego Poetry Guild looks
back at the year through an unusual lens: ideas. We conscripted a team
of researchers and reporters to investigate the latest thinking in every
subject imaginable -- not just poetry, politics, and plagiarism but also
alchemy, assembly, and puppet technology -- and to bring back the most
innovative, intriguing, mystifying and promising ideas they could find.

Although the predictable big thinkers are represented here -- Walter
Benjamin, Ivan Illich, Dziga Vertov, Lyn Hejinian, and Johnny Cash -- an
unusual proportion of this year's crop of ideas comes from lone-wolf
thinkers of one stripe or another: basement tinkerers, armchair
philosophers, mad scientists.

This blog, then, is not just a compilation of some of the year's most
significant and thought-provoking ideas. It's also a salute to the
schemers, oddballs and other unorthodox geniuses toiling away in their
labs and libraries, their classrooms and blogospheres, bent on changing
the world armed with nothing but a brand-new big idea.

Places Entrants -- Michael Rothenberg won the Places contest, but there were
many more backchannel votes -- and this one at least agreed that I could
forward her comments, after excising the name.  So I've done that.  As you
can see, Kevin Hehir gets her vote.  It's too bad -- I don't think writers
should take their poems personally, or others comments on them personally.  A
poem is a vehicle, like a car.  If it takes somebody some place, that's
good.  If it doesn't, or if the doors fall off, you might want to know this,
and build a better car.  It's just a vehicle, and feedback helps you build
for speed or beauty or whatever your values are.  At any rate, I thought
these were intelligent and pithy comments, so here they are.  Thanks so much
to everyone for joining my contest, and congratulations to Michael
Rothenberg, whose poem about Miami takes the cake!  -- Kirby

Dear Kirby, I second the thanks (Mairead who came second for one poet,
thank you very much).  I had just made a note to read through the poems
again today, and vote, when I read your post stating curtains.  Kirby,
aren't Leslie Scalapino and Ann Bogle's posts wonderful enrichments to
your earlier thread about poet's fathers/mothers?  Let's have more poems
and lines of poems!  I almost feel we're in a big old poetry mansion,
each in our room, scribbling away under the bed or in the tub.  Or maybe
we're more of an Advent calendar ....
Mairead

This is probably the last argument I should get into, but I was wondering=
 why Leslie Scalapino didn't dismiss Silliman's attack as falling into th=
e flimsy structure category of the ad hominem argument?  This is another =
way of saying that this is name-calling.  I teach freshman composition, a=
nd one of the rules is that you can't do this because it is considered ir=
relevant.  I use this wonderful book by Connie Missimer called Good Argum=
ents.  In the chapter called Flimsy Structures, she discusses Ad Hominem,=
 and gives several examples of it.

"The author was guilty of an ad hominem argument when he impugned Ms. Man=
ners's reputation instead of discussing her ideas" (p. 178).

"It's a shame when the discussion sank to the level of ad hominem argumen=
tation.  Dislike of a person's affiliations is not relevant to the issue"=
 (p. 178).

In short, as Missimer puts it, "An ad hominem attack is the discounting o=
f another person's ideas by discounting the person instead of showing why=
 the idea is not good.  The name-caller is off the issue."

"The assumptions beneath the conclusion that name-calling is a pitfall ar=
e, as always, that everyone is a member of the community of thinkers and =
no one should be excluded.  Of course, the people we want to exclude are =
the people whom we dislike.  With so many juicy things we can say against=
 our neighbor, it's often easier to backbite than to bother with the argu=
ment at hand."  (all from p. 178)

That Scalapino however accepts that it is wrong for her father not to be =
a leftist, but that even if he was, it would not taint her, since she wou=
ld have been unable to change his ideas, is right.  I also like that she =
clearly loves her father.  But the whole problem of the ad hominem attack=
 is what's so wrong about American academia now.  Unless you have one pos=
ition you are considered unworthy to be heard. Is that right?  It's the u=
nderpinning of both arguments and seemingly both agree that this is the c=
ase -- that unless you are leftist 24/7 on every topic you should be sile=
nced.

hat have to do with Leslie Scalapino or with poetry? I am not my father a=
nd can't change his views. Nor can I change your views. I asked you: Coul=
d you change your father's views? Is your life his?
>
>                 The other friend who commented said: "They (Watten and =
Silliman) are not attacking your father they're attacking you." I think t=
his is accurate. You're searching for a way to disparage the writing. You=
 once said to me: "You are conservative." I have never been conservative =
and I will not be so limited.
>

an excuse to go after a woman doing the work,  while you hold her respons=
ible for your sense of another man's life, decisions, and views, who is n=
ot herself. You place him in front of her and seek to undermine her as hi=
m. Although you yourself have tremendous anger, perhaps for perfectly goo=
d reasons (nor am I disparaging anger, which is phenomena only, neither a=
bsurd nor criminal), you define my writing, thus limiting it, as being de=
tailing of the emotion of anger, every sense of insult and humiliation. A=
s I described to you: Particularly in earlier writing, I was strongly inf=
luenced by Gandhi's views of non-violence and I sought to make writing wh=
ich peeled apart social formations in the instant of their forming, or be=
fore they form, without leaving them out of the writing, thus including t=
he emotion of anger and including pre-conceptions. By entering the action=
 of reading, the reader is in it seeing there is no such generalization a=
s "humiliation" in the sense that: that which is coming from others is no=
t oneself. My gesture is: to undercut force by not basing the writing on =
a stance of 'strength' even, except that which arises from the act of att=
ention.

Dear Everybody,
Thank you for being so kind about Grasshopper. I think this is the first
time I've won a contest since I was 12. I hope to continue in this vein.
It's cloudy here today. I hope it clears up.  Love, Michael

MSA 6 - Vancouver, BC  October 21-24, 2004
CALL FOR SEMINAR AND PANEL PROPOSALS

Deadline for Submission of Seminar Topics: Monday, February 23, 2004

Deadline for Submission of Panel Proposals: Monday, May 3, 2004


Please note:

*=09All  who attend the MSA conference must be members of the
organization with dues paid for 2004. =20

*=09MSA rules do not allow participants to lead a seminar and
present a paper at the same conference. Participants may, however,
present a panel paper and participate in a seminar, or chair a panel and
lead a seminar.=20

*=09MSA rules do not allow panel organizers to chair their own
session.  Organizers are encouraged to identify a moderator and include
this information with their panel proposal, but the MSA Program
Committee is also able to help you secure another conference attendee's
service as moderator.
Please see the announcement of MSA's new event, "What Are You Reading?", at=
 the end of this message.=20



CALL FOR SEMINAR LEADERS
Deadline: Monday, February 23, 2004=20

Participation of conferees in seminars is one of the most significant
features of the MSA conference. Seminars are small-group discussion
sessions for which participants write brief "position papers" that are
read and circulated prior to the conference. Seminars generate lively
and valuable exchange during the conference and in some cases have
created a network of scholars who have continued to work together. The
seminar format also allows most conference attendees to seek financial
support from their institutions as they educate themselves and their
colleagues on subjects of mutual interest.

Seminar Topics
There are no limits on topics, though seminars that address the
conference theme of Other Modernisms/Modernism's Others are particularly en=
couraged. Past experience has shown that the more clearly defined the top=
ic and the more guidance provided by the leader, the more useful the disc=
ussion has been to people's individual projects.=20

If you would like to know what kinds of seminars have been selected in
the past, go to the "Conference Archives" page on the MSA website
(http://msa.press.jhu.edu/archive/archive.html), click the link to a
prior conference, and then click on "Conference Schedule" or "Conference Pr=
ogram." You'll find seminars listed along with panels and other events.


Proposing a Seminar

Seminar proposals must include the following information. Please assist
us by sending this information in exactly the order given here:
* Use as a subject line: MSA 6 SEMINAR PROPOSAL / [LAST NAME OF SEMINAR LEA=
DER]
* List the seminar leader's name, institutional affiliation, discipline
or department, mailing address, phone, fax, and e-mail address
* Provide a current curriculum vitae for the seminar leader
* Give a brief description (up to 100 words) of the proposed topic
* Note: Seminars are two hours in length
Submit proposals by February 23, 2004 to:
Kate Scheel, Department of English, Simon Fraser University
Email: msa6@sfu.ca

Seminar proposals must be submitted by email.

Seminars will be selected in late March 2004.


Leading a Seminar

Seminar topics will be listed on this website in late March with
instructions on how to enroll in the seminars. To promote discussion,
the size of seminars is limited to a maximum of 20.=20

Leaders may, at their option, invite one or two individuals to join the
seminar in some special role. Some leaders will wish to share the work
of reading and responding to papers with the invited participants;
others will simply want to assure a high standard of discussion by
involving scholars whose work they know to be important for their topic.
Please note that invited participants will not be specially listed as
such in the conference program; nor will MSA cover their registration
fee and travel expenses.
E-mail addresses for all seminar registrants will be provided to seminar
leaders in May.=20

At that time, leaders should:=20

* Initiate communications by e-mail, introducing themselves and
providing addresses to all participants
* Set guidelines for the seminar, which might include questions to be
addressed, reading to be done, and a specified length for the position
papers (normally 5-7 pages)
* Set firm deadlines, no later than September 3, 2004 for the actual
exchange of papers
* Exchange and read papers during the 6-7 weeks before the conference
* Plan the seminar format (MSA will provide guidance, but leaders are,
within reasonable limits, free to use the two-hour time period as they
see fit)



CALL FOR PANEL PROPOSALS
Deadline: Monday, May 3, 2004

There are no limits on topics. Panels that address the conference theme
of Other Modernisms/Modernism's Others are encouraged. Particularly
welcome will be panels that focus on Canadian modernism; Pacific Rim
modernisms; African-American modernism; global modernisms; gendering modern=
ism; queer modernism; modernism and identity; and modernism and nationali=
ty.=20

Proposals for panels must include the following information. Please
assist us by sending this information in exactly the order given here:

* Use as a subject line: MSA 6 PANEL PROPOSAL / [LAST NAME OF PANEL ORGANIZ=
ER]
* Session title
* Session Organizer's name, institutional affiliation, discipline or=20
department, mailing address, phone, fax, and e-mail address
* Chair's name, institutional affiliation, discipline or department, and

contact information (if you do not identify a moderator, we will locate
one for you)=20
* Panelists' names, paper titles, institutional affiliations,
disciplines or=20
departments, and contact information
* A 250-word abstract of the panel as a whole

MSA policy on panels:=20
1. No participant may present more than one paper at one conference, and
no participant may both present a paper and lead one of the conference's se=
minars.=20
2. We do not accept proposals for individual papers.=20
3. We encourage interdisciplinary panels, and discourage panels on
single authors.=20
4. We encourage panels with three participants. Panels of four and=20
roundtables of five or six will, however, be considered.=20
5. Panels composed entirely of participants from a single department at
a single institution are not likely to be accepted.=20
6. MSA does not allow panel organizers to chair their own session. If a
panel proposal does not include information about a moderator, we will
assume you need us to locate one for you.=20

Send panel proposals by May 3, 2004 to:
Kate Scheel, Department of English, Simon Fraser University
Email: msa6@sfu.ca

Panel proposals must be submitted by email.

Panels will be selected in early June.



NOTICE OF NEW CONFERENCE EVENT: "WHAT ARE YOU READING?"

In accordance with its goal of continuous innovation in conference
programming, the MSA will introduce a new kind of discussion group at
the Vancouver conference. "What Are You Reading?" is designed to take
advantage, in a productive new way, of the presence in one place of
modernist scholars from many locations, institutions, and fields.

Each ninety-minute "What Are You Reading?" forum will consist of 8 to 10 pa=
rticipants and a moderator. Led by the moderator, each participant
will report for a few minutes on a recent scholarly or critical book in
modernist studies, sketching the work's content and explaining why she
or he found it exciting to share with other scholars. After all have
presented, the moderator will lead an open discussion in which
clarifications can be sought, connections drawn, and suggestions for yet
further reading offered.

A major goal of "What Are You Reading?" is to foster interdisciplinarity
by exposing participants to work in modernist fields other than their
own. Each forum will therefore be designed to maximize diversity of
specialty, ideally bringing scholars of visual art together with
literary critics, musicologists together with historians, students of
European culture together with experts on the Pacific rim, and so on.

"What Are You Reading?" is meant to facilitate the sharing of exciting
new scholarship. It is not intended primarily as a venue for discussion
of primary texts or works, for self-promotion, or for the enacting of
intellectual conflicts. Participants will therefore be asked not to
present on primary texts or works (though new editions and catalogues
are welcome), their own publications, or scholarship they did not
substantially admire.

To participate, all you will need to do is check the appropriate box on
your MSA registration form and name a book you might be interested in
presenting. MSA registration will begin mid-April; look for
announcements at that time. Please note that you will have to register
by 1 September to be included in "What Are You Reading?"

You will be notified of the time and location of your forum in late
September. There is no need to submit any proposal or paper in
connection with this event, nor do you need to contact your moderator in ad=
vance. Simply check the box, receive notice of your time and location, an=
d show up ready to share a book!

As MSA Vancouver marks a trial run for this event, places are limited,
and will be distributed on a first-come, first-served basis. If the
event is as successful as hoped, more meetings will be added in future
years.

Dear everyone,

A friend of mine is looking for freelance publicity work for the holiday season and perhaps beyond. Tennessee Jones is the Marketing Director for Soft Skull Press (as well as a writer, editor, and zine publisher) and we've worked together on a million projects. I have consistently been amazed at his creativity and drive, and recommend him without reservation. Press releases, promotions, events, marketing plans, sales kits, etc. He can be reached at tennessee@softskull.com and I'm also happy to foward any leads!

Thanks!
Shanna

I think that the point was that it was an ad hominem atttack delivered with
no opportunity for response since it was delivered via blog.  I am looking
forward to further discussion on the list as well as to the apearance of
Leslie's blog?

Subject:      Autobiography & Zither
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; format=flowed

Dear all,
I just wanted to add to the discussion that I though Scalapino's work in the
Autobiography published by Wesleyan (I've not yet read the one from FC2 but
am eager to) was an exquisite evocation of childhood, and works utterly in
the ways she describes in her post. I think it is a brave book. Certainly
braver & more important than any blog I've seen. Also I thought her
characterization of her father was loving and complex. There are instances
of description of his care for her which upon reading I felt if not envious
of, sad again about my own father's limitations.
Anyway, she certainly does not deserve to be attacked. Quite the opposite,
please. Not only is she an important writer, she is also a very generous and
attentive publisher, especially when it comes to paying attention to the
younger generation.
I'm quite uninterested the Watten/Silliman bloc, in fact it does not concern
me except where they try to quash the writers who really matter to me, of
whom Scalapino is one.

Ron Silliman is a terrific writer and a fascinating personality but he has a
disturbing need to put one in one's place.  For example, when he accepted my
text "The Picture Window" for _In the American Tree_ he made a point of writing
that it was the weakest piece in the anthology and that he was only taking it
on another poet's recommendation.

Years later those remarks still rankle.  It's not so much what he wrote as
that he needed to write it, needed to italicize my marginality, needed to place
his acceptance of my work under erasure.

I was heartened by Leslie Scalapino's post.  It's about time that someone of
her stature called Ron on his behavior.

And now I will return to the spider hole of my mediocrity far away from the
bright lights of the WorldWideWeb.

Hello Kirby,
I just wanted to thank you for organizing the places contest and for the
kind comments on my poem. It's funny, I was at the Place(less) Place
Gathering in Buffalo a few years ago and no one really talked about  the
physical space as in "You are Here". For me the place was rife with
placeness. Hassled at the border. First because our folders of poems were
suspected to be harbouring resumes. Second because of a prior arrest.
The fact that we were told not to walk to the pub because it wasn't safe.
Place was everywhere.

I found with these poems I actually got a chance to hear a bit of honesty
from the list. Whether we wear where we live like an old shirt or
tight and pricey new shoes, it informs us. I would guess that Alan
Sondheim's Florida is a lot different than Taylor Brady's (from Tampa).

 I too liked Ravi Shankar's poem about Illinois. It reminds me that what
fascinates me about the US is not what I get from the big news services
but from the local news that is beamed into Canadian houses. Did you know
that they could be watching the Detroit 6 o'clock news in saskatoon? and
this isn't just a product of the million channel universe. this has been
like this for decades as cable in canada used to just mean american
channels (NBC,ABC,CBS).

anyway a bit of a ramble. i've lived in six provinces in this country and
i'm not even a canadian citizen. i think about place a lot.

as for the foghorn poem. when i first moved to st. john's, newfoundland i
had never heard a foghorn before. It wasn't until after about two months
of living there that i finally made the connection. that sound i was
hearing on nights walking home from my work pod at school. that sound that
was a "mitten covered yawn' was in fact the foghorn coming from the
harbour. The definitive book on soundscapes is R. Murray Schafer's The
Tuning of the World.


 i read that poem in Halifax and a fellow came up to me and told me how
when he has spent time away from Halifax (another port town) he misses the
foghorn. He asked for a copy of the poem. i was blown away because i grew
up in saskatchewan which is about as inland as you can get in North
America. i guess i got it right and i attribute that to the flaneur gene
that poets have.

I'd be curious to know whether the the person who commented on my poem
lives by the sea.

all the best,
kevin

"...Things are very frightening these days in Baghdad. Going from one area
to another is like going from one city to another- the feelings and emotions
vary so drastically it feels like only a matter of time before we may see
clashes..."

From blog, Baghdad Burning, http://riverbendblog.blogspot.com/

I continue to find this Iraqi guy a very good first hand reporter from
Baghdad - at least from an educated, probably upper-class perspective. No
one, presumably, can blog from the perspective of the Baghdad neighborhood
poor. Unless we think of our own poor and middle class soldiers whose lives
have been hijacked into these territories - many whom, I suspect would be
very sharp on non-media-network reportable conditions, feelings, perceptions
and thoughts on being there. Needless to say, I suspect it's hard to find
such articulations that can escape Rumsfeld's retribution. (Any good leads
on soldier's writing/blogging accurately and well??)

Yes - Civil War or alternatively a US trust (!) that genuine indigenous
interests want and  can command a reconfiguration of democracy in Iraq.
Already a hard one to imagine with US looting of Iraq's resources under the
righteous claiming of the "spoils of war." (quo Haliburton, etc. etc.).

It's going to be a long time before this is a "pretty mix."

HI,
I just wanted to thank everyone who sent i responded to my post about
geneology of these two movements.

The reason I asked is because I was reading a review in an arts mag
(http://www.artsatlantic.ca/) and it mentioned that Dada was the
forerunner of Italian Futurism. I only read the article quickly and i was
hoping to actually have a copy before discussion happened on this list. oh
well.

as for Romanian super brains. i was taught by one. Calin-Andrei
Mihailescu.  our summer
seminar schedule was made to work around world cup soccer matches. amazing
command of languages and intellectual history. when I asked him to write
one of my letters for admission to grad school he told me that creative
people tend get frustrated but if I really wanted to go he'd support me.

I was at a conference and was talking to a current comp lit student and he
told me that they still talk about how Calin dominated the seminars. and
he was there almost twenty years ago.

cheers,
kevin

Did anyone listen to and/or have a problem with the following =

herself and her son in earlier this year.=20

http://www.npr.org/features/feature.php?wfId=3D1550015

There seems to have been some sort of conscious effort not to name the =
poet in question, as if Reetika was so beyond the pale of comprehension =
that to name her would be to summon, as they tactlessly put it, =
"demons." The anecdote about spending night in the dining room as if it =
were some kind of courageous act was rather sickening and the idea of =
changing all the paintings there because they were witnesses bespoke of =
a kind of self-absorbed privilege and lack of compassion that really =
bothered me. Certainly it's hard to deal with something like that =
happpening in one's home, but I hope that I would be more concerned =
about the tragedy of my friend (who was, after all, good enough to house =
sit for me) than about reclaiming the space in question. Perhaps I'm =
biased, but the whole discussion seemed nimby in the worst way to me. =20

Yes, I heard the discussion and found it disturbing. I can understand the
Norman's rage against being violated and the need to cleanse and exorcise
their home space. Yet, the piece did seem built around the pathos of
"important writers and family violated" rather any compassion for whatever
grief that drove the poet caretaker to this self-extinguishing extreme, let
alone that of her child.
The Normans seemed to have been spared previous personal association with a
suicide and what that investigation and sorrow may yield.

My sympathies and condolences, Ravi.

I did hear the story on the way to work.  I did wish they had been more
forthcoming about the whole affair, but I felt more that they were trying to
protect privacy and memory.  I think that it would be quite tramatizing to
have an event such as this take place in one's own sanctuary.  I didn't feel
there was any disrespect made, but I thought the haunted house analogy was a
bit morbid on NPR's part.  I think I'd replace the portraits too, but that's
just how my head works.

Yes, listening to the broadcast this morning
I couldn't help but almost say to myself aloud:
"What is the motivation of these two to make
themselves available for this kind of demonstration?"

Then I thought: "Are we so
bound up in the myths of Plath and others?"

Such a "reclamation", if, indeed, that is what
their insensitive egos insisted on, should have
been shuttered.

One thing is for certain -- they may "reclaim"
their house, but the world (which THEY do not
inhabit) will remember and remember.

My best thoughts for you as you deal with
your sad ones,
Jerry Schwartz



Did anyone listen to and/or have a problem with the following conversation
on NPR's Morning Edition? It has to do with Howard Norman and Jane Shore and
how they reclaimed the home that Reetika killed herself and her son in
earlier this year.

http://www.npr.org/features/feature.php?wfId=1550015

There seems to have been some sort of conscious effort not to name the poet
in question, as if Reetika was so beyond the pale of comprehension that to
name her would be to summon, as they tactlessly put it, "demons." The
anecdote about spending night in the dining room as if it were some kind of
courageous act was rather sickening and the idea of changing all the
paintings there because they were witnesses bespoke of a kind of
self-absorbed privilege and lack of compassion that really bothered me.
Certainly it's hard to deal with something like that happpening in one's
home, but I hope that I would be more concerned about the tragedy of my
friend (who was, after all, good enough to house sit for me) than about
reclaiming the space in question. Perhaps I'm biased, but the whole
discussion seemed nimby in the worst way to me.

Hi All,

Apologies for not getting on it sooner.

First off, thanks to everyone who will be contributing to the artists' book project. I want to clear up a few things before we go along: the project was never meant to be distributed or reproduced. It was meant to be a collection for public use during our reading series (and as a growing donation to the Baltimore Poetic community, i.e. schools, libraries, museums, etc.) and to elicit a response in the form of contributions (this is an ongoing project, in which will document the various manners of action poets take, and to be combined in an enormous book form for public use). I'll be sending out specs as soon as possible with one exception: Rather than sending out paper gifts I'd rather folks send me their own work in the manner they deem fit, no matter what size, to be added to the growing collection. If this is still feasable, anyone who wants can send work, after january 1st, 2004, to the following address:

Christophe Casamassima
8414-D greenway road
baltimore, md 21234

the specs are as follows: any size paper, any style necessary that involves a hands-on approach to forming, be it pure textual or graphic or both. so, there really are no specs but hands on is crucial.

Also:

We're beginning a series of pamphlet size chaps, 5 1/2" by 8 1/2". If you'd like to be a part, please send work electronically or physically to the address above, anything that fit's comfortably within this size. send 4 to 6 pages of text, and any artwork you'd like to appear on the cover, black and white.

Any questions? Happy holidays and not so holidays that are as yet unexplored.

Ciao, Chris

If I 'own' a blog I don't have to publish aything I don't want to publish.
While this is true of other forms of publication it's most obvious when one
person controls all.

tom, i'd agree with you in part if Silliman didn't have Squawk Box.

but he DOES, which means that he has taken care to be certain
that anyone out there who reads a post may click on "comments"
and engage with him and the rest of his readers.

this is not to defend what he has said about Scalapino,
but it is to defend Silliman's chosen Blog format.  he's one
of the few who in fact sees to it that we all have space for
our say about what he says.

when he publishes dissent, so can you, right with him.
or against him.  or even against the others in the Squawk Box.
that's kind of exciting when you think about it, allowing us to
all engage at will, no one filtering what is said.

he's also made the effort to include links to just about every
single poetics Blog in the world on his Blog.  if ever you
forget someone's Blog address in the poetry community,
just go to Silliman's Blog, and it will be there.

blogs are shops, while the list is the public square.  you can control
discussion in a blog, but not on list.  (though a strictly monitored list
becomes a mall).

note:  my capitalist analogies are not meant to be disrespectful, although
at the moment they do seem appropriate.  let us all remember that Watten
and Silliman stopped posting to the list because a number of people flamed
them for being who they are, not for their arguments.

SHELLEY ON BLOGS

I met a traveller from an antique blog
Who said:=97Two vast and trunkless legs of stone
Stand in the desert. Near them on the sand,
Half sunk, a shatter'd visage lies, whose frown
And wrinkled lip and sneer of cold command
Tell that its sculptor well those passions read
Which yet survive, stamp'd on these lifeless things,
The hand that mock'd them and the heart that fed.
And on the pedestal these words appear:
"My name is Ozymandias, king of blogs:
Look on my works, ye mighty, and despair!"
Nothing beside remains: round the decay
Of that colossal wreck, boundless and bare,
The lone and level sands stretch far away.

This is a bit of a sore point with me as I have asked Ron 3 times to
include my blog.  The first time, I guess he just forgot.  The second
time he said it wasn't active.  The third time was just yesterday.
As they say, if you have to ask more than twice you should probably shut
up.  Ron doesn't owe me or my blog anything.  But as another power
circuit, the blog thing is interesting.  One poet, for personal reasons,
removed my link from his list.  In the case of Ron's blog, I don't mind
hugely.  The man is no doubt busy.  But I think the claim below is
dangerous and untrue: I don't consider myself outside the poetry
community because Ron hasn't got around to including me on his list.
Though the way these things work, that may well be so.

Subject:      Correction on Scalapino
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"; format=flowed

I don't know why my name was mentioned in connection with Ron's remarks on
Robert Scalapino. I haven't discussed him in public, and only once with
Leslie in private, sometime in the late 1980s. So--whatever else is going
on here, the linkage is an *ad hominem*. Whatever Ron wrote, which I
haven't seen, should be responded to on its own merits.

During the Vietnam War, Robert Scalapino was well known for his support of
administration policy in Vietnam--on the Berkeley campus, he was a virtual
synecdoche for liberal academic complicity with the war. Ron and I were, of
course, opposed to the war. The university we experienced was suffused with
social and intellectual violence of all kinds. I've written on that in a
piece on poetry and Berkeley in the 60s.

An academic specialization of the last fifteen years is "trauma theory."
Leslie's post, and even some of her work, can be placed in relation to the
long-term consequences of the Vietnam War. "That war, in which we certainly
could not believe, because we meant not to believe in it." One of the
questions I ask in *Bad History* is, How can one ever end it? There is a
vicious circle around words like "attacking" and "conservative" in her post
that tries to name and distance pain and suffering but ends up continuing them.

I think there is a crucial distinction between 'theory' and clinical
resolution:  the distance of 'theory' keeps the trauma frozen in time.  My
impression of Scalapino's post was that she had moved beyond this and was
dealing with her father as a person rather than a frozen symbol?

My brother was in Vietnam while I was in SDS so we have different
experiences of the 'trauma' but we have in common that we are not for the
current Bushite saga.

I think this 'theory' approach to 9/11has kept the US frozen and the trauma
has not been resolved clinically - I'd welcome Nick's view on this.

What's a "vicious circle?"

I'd agree with Tom Bell (if I understand you aright, Tom) that you're
probably not qualified to practice psychotherapy.

This site is apparently kaput. I tried to check, because the assertion is
simply astonishing, much as I might wish it had been true. At least at
Columbia (I was there 1966-1970) there were plenty, mostly in the social
sciences, who supported presidential policy to the bloody end, and plenty
in the hard sciences who were more than happy to engage in secret military
research supportive of those policies. And still more from all disciplines
who supported "either" Kennedy's, or Johnson's, or Nixon's war "over [its]
course." Note the tricky grammar.

Hal, I don't know if you're agreeing with me or disagreeing with me but
I agree with you.

Alan, you say:

"This is the problem with blogs - they create
reifications/classifications - one is either in or out. I keep looking
for my name among Ron's topics -
of course that won't occur. But his blog becomes a kind of
power-filter,and the more we think about it, the more we grant it that
-"

I understand your desire for inclusion.  Though I don't understand your
simultaneous assumption that
Ron will not address your work.  Why do you think this is?  Your work is
unique and phenomenal.

I was amusing myself this morning speculating on the extent of my own
marginality:  I am the lint on the fringe on the scarf on the margins of
marginal poetry.  No, I am the speck on the lint on the fringe on the
scarf on the margins of marginal poetry.  No, no, I am the dust-mite on
the speck on the lint on the fringe on the scarf on the margins of
marginal poetry.  From this point I have to delve into the anatomy of
dust-mites which I plan to do later today.
But dammit to hell ain't I a poet?  I claim my seat.

That said, I have to admit the severely non-networking character of my
own blog, which does not even include my email address.  On the other
hand, Ron and many others have developed blogs on which I would like to
be listed, although that makes my blog available for ranking or
exclusion.

Subject:      Trauma theory
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"; format=flowed

Tom, I hope you are not taking a dogmatic position in the old debate
between clinicians and theorists. "Trauma theory" is, indeed, not a
clinical approach but an interpretive method (for literature, culture,
politics) that is based both in psychoanalytic literature and clinical
experience. Both the major figures in trauma theory--Dominick LaCapra and
Cathy Caruth--read literature, the psychoanalytic tradition, and practicing
theorists, but what they do is not intended to substitute for what
clinicians do in a therapeutic setting.

Scalapino herself, I'm thinking particular of her work
"War/Poverty/Writing," which Lyn and I published in the last *Poetics
Journal*, is clearly both reflecting on and working through issues
connected to trauma. Her writing on Charlotte Delbo's Holocaust journals is
precisely about that. The notion that "theory" or "literary" approaches to
trauma simply objectifies it is just untenable, and it's one of the reason
for the *form* of Leslie's work--in which narratives are anything but
objectified but multiperspectival and self-reflexive, even free-floating
and dissociative.

In *Bad History*, I actually used (read, cited, took lines from) trauma
theory and even more to the point critical historiography--to get at
questions of individual and collective narrative that were entirely
involved in the narrative of the Vietnam War, which was supposed to have
been ended with the Gulf War. Now, it turns out we are in another Vietnam
quagmire where bodies are being blown up, where pain and suffering are
being produced on a daily basis. A question I would ask is, How does
contemporary clinical discourse--the discourse of healing and recuperation
from trauma, very much in public discourse since 9/11--create narratives of
complicity with the current war? *We* are traumatized--we are Jessica
Lynch--but that ignores the trauma that *we* are inflicting on others who
are not *we*. To return to Scalapino's work, much of its moral force has to
do with the suffering of those who are not *us*--often as, if I read her
correctly, our suffering.

Sonnet:   In an Uncertain World

On an airplane, I saw the face of imperialism reflected
in your eyes. The shrieking eagle wheels, Damascus
down below--brown on brown. I'd read your piece
in *Foreign Policy*, but hadn't believed a word of it.
We'd find a way to commemorate the average man,
you said. This is unreal, I thought. Let us pray for this
man, sang the eagle, stunningly. No sentence of banish-
ment that can not be reversed upon appeal to a higher
court. The dead continue with their swimming motions,
graced with courage and long preparation. Naked as
ever,  naked as air-controllers unprotected by unions.
An alternative view: exterminate them like mice, don't
mourn them uselessly. The furniture of home--our un-
expressed fondness for it, whatever the dictators do.

Subject:      Ron's blog posts on Leslie's writing
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; format=flowed

I've read Ron's three blog posts on Leslie's autobiography several times
now, and I can't for the life of me understand where anyone gets an "attack"
or attempt to "disparage" or (worse) "quash" Leslie's writing from what, to
this reader, seems like unqualified glowing praise.

Ron reads Leslie's writing, he says, with "awe," says that she has
"integrity," compares her favorably with Robert Duncan, says that she writes
with "a high degree of parataxis & torque," calls the work "breathtaking,"
says that "commitment to truth telling may be the rarest of all human
virtues, but is one that Scalapino has in spades," calls her writing both
"precise" and "moving," in passing refers to a collaboration Leslie wrote
with Lyn, Sight, as his favorite collaboration of all time, calls her one of
the "significant" poets of the Bay Area, and describes a recent reading of
hers as "the most fascinating reading I’ve been to in years. So much so in
fact as I drove west out to Paoli afterwards, I tried to think of another
reading that had struck me in just that fashion &, in all honesty, the one
that came to mind was a trio of Friday night readings Robert Duncan gave in
Berkeley around 1970 in which he read all the sections of his long poem
Passages that had been written to that point."

This is disparagement? An attack? An attempt to "quash" Leslie's writing? It
sounds like he's describing one of his favorite writers of all time.

I also don't see the word "right winger" anywhere in the blog w/respect to
Leslie's father, nor did I get the sense that Ron thinks of him as one.

Could someone who has spoken here against Ron's "attack" on Leslie parse out
for me the negativity you're seeing in these (only apparently?) wildly
appreciative blog entries?

Barrett,  I didn't intend to be dogmatic so I'm sorry if I came off that
way.  I only wanted to say that my reading of Leslie's post was that through
her writing (apparently) she seems to have resolved her 'trauma'.  I
apologize for the public nature of this, Leslie.  Sorry.

     Is any of this trauma theory available on the web?  I have very poor
access to libraries. What I meant to say in a general way was that the
country (in my reading of the news and views, etc.) has not 'resolved' 9/11
and probably the Vietnam trauma.  perhaps this needs to be confronted if we
are to move on into the 21st century?

I think Barry brings a strong theoretical reflective and critical mirror
into the "Post-which war" historical context. Intuitively I like the
metaphor of the chronological burden of the wounded body, one that refuses
to heal, and one that is denied exposure and refused the opportunity to heal
in the light of witness, whether that be through language or ritual action,
or, inevitably the combination of both, or what poets are most likely to
initially invest in the making and exposure of the book, such as in Leslie's
work, the book, at its best, being an effective and persuasive cultural
tool.

"We", meaning those born in the United States, or those choosing to
integrate one's life into the history of this country, carry an extensive
shadow, whether it begins with the atomic bomb and the destruction of
Hiroshima and Nagasaki, or before, is inevitably subject to debate. What's
clear in terms of anybody who lived through the sixties is the
assassinations - in fairly rapid succession - of John F. Kennedy, Malcolm X,
Martin Luther King and Robert Kennedy - cast the shadow both open and more
deeply asunder. No matter the limits, particularly of the Kennedy's, one can
say that that each of these figures was variously trying to unwrap "frozen
trauma", particularly in terms of of race, and definitely in terms that
re-opened black/white issues manifest going back to the Civil War, but
implicit also to history of Indians, Hispanic and Asian Americans - the new
political  language crossing deep boundary (color, religion and class)
issues into the promise of liberation of that "other" - a multiple series of
sites in which much blood had been spilled in its repression.

Unclothing the wound caused hysteria, particularly on the "white right" in
which assassination became its wish and redemptive tool. As a consequence,
there has not been one person on the Left - at least in terms of the
Democratic Party - who has had the courage (under fear of death) to make any
dramatic public steps towards "unclothing the wound" again, one that would
also include a full acknowledgement of the infliction of nuclear death. And,
as a further consequence of what might be called the Left's "assassination
paranoia", the Right has risen relatively uncontested (whether one sees it
in Bush, Gingrich, Cheney, the Fox Network, it's an extensive list) until,
it now seems, we have (minimally) a partial military coup, a Junta, in which
some like Rumsfeld and his Defense Department Associates are making major
political decisions of State, incidentally, and shades of Hiroshima,
resurrecting the sanctity of nuclear weapons as a tool of terror and
domination.

Leslie's father participated in the Viet-Nam shadow. Leslie's work is
committed to abducting the shadow. One hopes, one among many, (off the top)
one that includes portions of the work of Barry W. and Carl Harryman.
Clearly it's step by step before the country gets to the next full scale
public accounting and large encounter (a currently - to me - culturally
familiar vibration of Civil War - as in both the 1860's and 1960's). The
language of the approach - its syntax, (content, tone and perspectives) use
and persuasive value - will be on-going debate and subject to multiple tests
and constructs.

Before the darkest day of the year,

Ryotaro Shiba, Kukai The Universal: Scenes from His Life, trans. Akiko
Takemoto from Kukai no Fukei, Muse ICG, 2003:

9th-century Kukai founds esoteric Japanese Buddhist Shingon after
traveling to China, the book a brilliant account of physical/body and
philosophical transmission, virtual carried on the shoulders of desire and
flesh. Saicho, founder of Tendai - both travel together to China, known to
each other only later. Later still, Ennin, translated by Reischauer, who
also writes a commentary on him, two books: Ennin's Travels in Tang China,
and Ennin's Diary: The Record of a Pilgrimage to China, which occurred
838-847. Kukai was deified, more tendrils described in George Tanabe, ed.,
Religions of Japan in Practice. Accounts are endless, for example Bai
Letian (Bai Juyi), Waley's favorite, appears in Shiba for his Chang'an (NW
capital of Tang) descriptions - I found his work elsewhere in several
transliterated volumes complete w/ the Chinese. There are meanderings back
and forth, everyone crossing from Japan to China and back on ill-equipped
and poorly-designed boats, many of which never returned. These journeys
read like spirit-journeys of skin and soul; Ennin goes in Search of the
Law, and his diary records Tang's Wu-Tsung's search for immortality,
complete with Taoist tower, as well as his persecution of the Buddhists,
almost to extinction. Later Ennin continued Saicho's work; Saicho and
Kukai had a problematic relationship, with the former declaring himself a
student of the latter - in Shiba, Saicho is presented as hurrying through
the Sutras (much as I do), not as therapeutic (in the Freudian sense), but
as knowledge; Kukai refused him a loan of some manuscripts, and, rude, the
falling-out intensified. Kukai was at Koya, Saicho at Hiei, later
destroyed. Of Kukai, later sainthood, legends, including his survival
beneath the tomb, eternal meditation, mummification. But then there are
accounts of cremation. Kukai wrote The Ten Stages of the Development of
Human Mind, 830, described in Shiba, and certainly critical in the rising
up and annihilation of world and consciousness; all these agreements and
disagreements are a far cry from monotheism with its tired and dogmatic
narratives necessitating loyalty, violence, and belief. There is always
space, such as the liminality within the sculptural mandala at To-jo,
founded by Kukai - who has also been credited, rightly or wrongly, with
the hiragana and katakana syllabic characters (that appear related to
Sanskrit, a language he knew well). Kukai also founded a university,
dammed a reservoir, built on top of Mount Koya, organized and reformulated
the Sutras he brought back with him from China. And within his writings
and travels - and within those of Saicho, Ennin, and others - one can
almost envision the origins of vision, invisibility, the accompaniment of
absence, the horizons of enlightenments. Not to return primarily with the
relics of Buddha (although these were also carried), but to emphasize the
inscription of the world - all those sutras brought from China - as well
as the necessity of transcendence. It's the letter and its erasure, a
semiotic formation that has never been equaled, I think, anywhere else -
and a formation that's neither Chinese nor Japanese, nor of this world,
nor of any other. One might move from these books to the sutras themselves
- as much as possible, I recommend the translations of Bill Porter / Red
Pine, and at least glance at the Chinese and the weights and absences of
the characters themselves.

Tom: We haven't "resolved" the Civil War or the Indian wars. I wouldn't be
too optimistic.

I'm more than a little bit leery of analyzing anyone in public, and still
more troubled by doing so on the basis of writing. Freud and others have
had fun analyzing the dead (yet another level of remove), but I'd suggest
that they write fiction when they do so. Leonardo is beyond complaining,
but the living it seems to me have every reason to be miffed. We are, after
all, talking about a human life.

Ok, I am now going to try to listen in on the Silliman/Scalapino differend, as I
don't know much about either writer, and am increasingly fascinated to hear all
the different ways people are reading this conflict.  I have read something of
both writers -- and find them both very tough going.  Could anybody post the
original Silliman article about Scalapino or give me a link?  Apparently this
original document is read in quite a different way by the men than by the women.
I need to read it to get the gist of this unfolding debate.

in the Periscope section of Newsweek, Dec. 22, 2003:


Poetry: No Rhyme or Reason


 - As Congress creates new rules to prevent Web surfers from drowning i=
n a
sea of spam, the literati are crying foul. More than 8 billion pieces o=
f
spam are sent worldwide daily, making it one of the most prolific avenu=
es
of expression. It seems that, within the deluge of refinancing plans an=
d
penis-enlargement offers, there's fodder for spam poetry. Bloggers have=

been forming the often-racy verse from the subject lines of e-mails.
"They're liberating language from meaning," says University at Buffalo,=

N.Y., poetry professor Loss Pequeno Glazier, who calls spam poets the
descendants of William Burroughs. A (sort of) family-friendly sample:

"Number 1," by Kristin Thomas: Quality Ink up to 80% off/Answers Now on=

"Napoleon," by Stephen Dann: With this your dreams become true/governme=

"James Writes," by Spencer Fleury (honorable mention in SatireWire's 20=
02
spam poetry contest): James in San Francisco writes:/MARRY your BROTHER=

Hi All--

I have a student (a former student, actually--I have trouble letting go) who's writing a critical paper on Lydia Davis.  Does anybody have any suggestions of influences on Davis she might look at, as well as critical writing (on or by her) or interviews?

Thanks.

BANJO:  Poets Talking
(transcriptions of conversations between poets)

The following conversation transpired between Kaia Sand and Carol Mirakove on Saturday afternoon, November 15, 2003, on the beach of Point Lookout in Southern Maryland. Kaia had organized an event the previous day called "Women in the Avant-Garde" at St. Mary's College, in which Carol, Laura Elrick, Heather Fuller, Kristin Prevallet, and Deborah Richards engaged a panel/dialogue with approximately 75 people, including Kaia's students, colleagues, and members of the St. Mary's community, and poets from DC and NYC.

Mime-Version: 1.0

Hi Gary et al,
Judge me as you will, I've responded to both Ron and Barrett privately.
I relied on Leslie's book and her post in forming my response.
I don't read blogs.
I do read literary history and my response was informed by the history of
the suppression of women's writing. If interested in this re for example the
development of the novel in English, you might see Backsheider & Richetti's
Popular Fiction by Women 1660-1730 and or Janet Todd's The Sign of
Angellica. Todd is an amazing writer and critic, tres de la enjoyable to
this reader.
I do think "significant Bay Area poet" is a bit of an understatement of LS's
importance.
Best regards and happy winterdays to all,
Elizabeth

Hi,
Some of her condensed short stories are reminiscent of Thomas Bernhard's
_The Voice Imitator_, which is 104 stories in 104 pages. I wonder if she
borrowed from it? It seems plausible because she has one about Glenn Gould
(cf. Bernhard's _The Loser_). I think she has an interview up at Salon.com.
She's also translated Blanchot & now Proust. I'd love to hear if your
student comes across any good essays on her.

Poetics List persons:

I encourage you to drop by the University of Alabama Press booth at MLA.
I'd like you to see the various books in the Modern and Contemporary
Poetics Series. Various MCP authors will be at the MLA convention and
hanging out at the UA Press booth. I will be at the booth

Sunday, Dec. 28: 2-3:30
Monday, Dec. 29: 9-11
Tuesday, Dec. 30: 10-11

I'd be pleased to talk to anyone about projects that you're working on
that might become future MCP Series titles. And I'd be glad to talk to
you about forthcoming MCP books by Michael Magee, Jed Rasula, Marjorie
Perloff, Aldon Nielsen, Rosmarie Waldrop, Brian McHale, Ben Friedlander,
Abigail Childs, Peter Middleton, and recent MCP books such as
Architectural Body by Madeline Gins and Arakawa and Another South:
Experimental Writing in the South (ed. by Bill Lavender).

Additional information about the MCP Series can be found at:

http://www.uapress.ua.edu/authors/poetics3.html

or in an ad in the current issue of Rain Taxi.

I hope to see many of you at the group poetry reading on Dec. 28, 6-9,
at the Museum of Contemporary Art downtown.

Her spareness and use of repetition foreground style in a way similar to the writing in
Hemingway's _In Our Time_, published in 1925 -- a book of stories (several quite short) that
he wrote with the help of Gertrude Stein's editing him toward repetition.

***Can you write poetry about (or in) Excel? (Writers for the Future)

Someone told our writer in residence Tim Wright: 'People don't want to read poetry about Excel spreadsheets.'

Tim says "So is this really rather wonderful genre of software - that did more than any other to establish the PC in the workplace and then the home - an inappropriate subject for poetry. I think not.

A small prize of my choosing goes to the person or persons who submit the best poem about Excel by Jan 1st 04."

Subject:      A Picasso Sampler on ubu.com
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="iso-8859-1"
Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable

The following addition to Kenny  Goldsmith's ubuweb site =
(http://www.ubu.com/) may be of interest to some on the poetics list:

Pablo Picasso, "A Picasso Sampler: excerpts from The Burial of the Count =
of Orgaz, & Other Poems" (1935-59)

The introduction, excerpted from the forthcoming Exact Change =
publication and preceding a selection of the poems, reads as follows:

I abandon sculpture engraving and painting to dedicate myself entirely =
to song. -- Picasso to Jaime Sabart=E9s April 1936
When Pierre Joris and I were compiling Poems for the Millennium we =
sensed that Picasso, if he wasn't fully a poet, was incredibly close to =
the neighboring poets of his time, and when he brought language into his =
cubist works, the words collaged from newspapers were there as something =
really to be read. What only appeared to us later was the body of work =
that emerged from 1935 on and that showed him to have been a poet in the =
fullest sense and possibly, as Michel Leiris points out, "an insatiable =
player with words ... [who, like] James Joyce ... in his Finnegans Wake, =
... displayed an equal capacity to promote language as a real thing (one =
might say) . . . and to use it with as much dazzling liberty."

It was in early 1935, then, that Picasso (then fifty-four years old) =
began to write what we will present here as his poetry - a writing that =
continued, sometimes as a daily offering, until the summer of 1959. In =
the now standard Picasso myth, the onset of the poetry is said to have =
coincided with a devastating marital crisis (a financially risky =
divorce, to be more exact), because of which his output as a painter =
halted for the first time in his life. Writing - as a form of poetry =
using, largely, the medium of prose - became his alternative outlet. The =
flow of words begins abruptly ("privately" his biographer Patrick =
O'Brian tells us) on 18 april XXXV while in retreat at Boisgeloup. (He =
would lose the country place the next year in a legal settlement.) The =
pace is rapid, violent, pushing and twisting from one image to another, =
not bothering with punctuation, often defying syntax, expressive of a =
way of writing/languaging that he had never tried before:

if I should go outside the wolves would come to eat out of my hand just =
as my room would seem to be outside of me my other earnings would go off =
around the world smashed into smithereens

as one of us has tried to phrase it in translation.

Yet if the poems begin with a sense of personal discomfort and malaise, =
there is a world beyond the personal that enters soon thereafter. For =
Picasso, like any poet of consequence, is a man fully into his time and =
into the terrors that his time presents. Read in that way, "the world =
smashed into smithereens" is a reflection also of the state of things =
between the two world wars - the first one still fresh in mind and the =
rumblings of the second starting up. That's the way the world goes at =
this time or any other, Picasso writes a little further on, not as the =
stricken husband or the discombobulated lover merely, but as a man, like =
the aforementioned Joyce, caught in the "nightmare of history" from =
which he tries repeatedly to waken. It is the time and place where =
poetry becomes - for him as for us - the only language that makes sense.

That anyway is where we position Picasso and how we read him.=20

I went to Silliman's blog, and opened it.  Just go to google and put in "ron
Silliman" and then blog, and bam, you have it.  The second entry is a response
to this list.  In the second line, he gives you a link to his original entry.
What's weird is that this is the most positive writing I can imagine short of a
back cover blurb.  There are no doubt deep deep deep nerve endings having to do
with the father, as is expressed here, and perhaps any reference to the father
is enough to set someone off, especially with a famous and wonderfully eccentric
dad like this one, but really, read this and you'll shake your head and wonder.
I wouldn't mind at all if someone wrote such a blog on me.  Perhaps this is all
a "blague" ?  -- Kirby Olson

forward from psyart:

You are quite right - 'Inner Vision' by Semir Zeki is the seminal work
on visual art and the brain. Prof Zeki has instigated a very interesting
virtual institute - 'The Institute of Neuroesthetics' which can be
visited at http: www.neuroesthetics.org. He is also a guiding patron of
the forthcoming 'Winchester Festival of Art and the Mind' which takes
place - in Winchester, UK - on the 5, 6 and 7 March 2004.  The Festival
will not only examine the visual arts but music, dance and literature.
Among our patrons are Prof Richard Dawkins, Prof V S Ramachandran and
the distinguished science writer Rita Carter. The programme is just
about complete and will include not only lectures and forums but dance,
exhibitions (an major installation by Anthony Gormley in the Great Hall
in Winchester), performances of magic, music and a major literary input.
The novelist A S Byatt will be speaking. You can find our more about it
at www.artmindfestival.com

This web site is still under construction but will be up and running in
a few days. At the moment it will give you most of what you want to know
so is worth a visit. It would be marvellous if some Psyarters would like
to be involved in this project. If you need any more information you may
contact me directly.

with best wishes,

Garry Kennard
Director, Winchester Festival of Art and the Mind

well folks i did not prevail in the mla poetry division executive
election.  i suspect a significant number of members of my department
voted for the other candidate on principle, but i am given to
conspiracy theories.
speaking of which, a poetry event *not* sponsored by said poetry
division --it's a special session) is a panel on gender in american
cold war poetry, featuring me (on bob kaufman), michael davidson
(talking on elizabeth bishop's hairdos!!), hilene flanzbaum (on anne
sexton i think), and steve axelrod on lowell and ginsberg??? can that
be right?

Many thanks to those who responded to me over this. In fact everyone
is giving me the same email address, but for some reason I keep
getting the 'system administrator undeliverable message' each time I
send it (and I have pasted it on /typed it in a million times!! )
According to this message there is some problem with the server at
the other end, but I seem to have reached a stalemate with this.

Anyway many thanks again

that they're going to get a majority against gay marriage, but right now
slightly more than half are voting in favor of gay marriage. Add your

The short prose pieces in the Samuel Johnson book remind me of Michaux's short prose in Grand Garabagne and Au pays de la magie (In the land of Magic? not sure how it's translated) both in the collection Ailleurs (Elsewhere). Their narrators share that self-effacing acceptance of total absurdity that makes the work so funny.

Best,
Sasha

Thanks for putting this on line, Daisy.  It's about time we stopped
examining each other's gender choices for "significant other."  I look
forward to a day when "hetero" and "homo" can be as private or public as
the individual wishes, not a gateway to acceptance or rejection.

Best wishes,
Martha Deed

kristmas greetings frenz. wut appeers beelow is totallee self eksplanatoree

 December 16, 2003

 deer frenz uv bill bissett,

 We had a poetic idea. It was endorsed by lunarians. Now
 we ask for your earthly participation.

 The Idea: We noticed each time we talked to bill bissett
 we learned something about ourselves. We listened
 to him and he inspired us to write. Sometimes we wrote
 poems about him. We imagined he must have the same effect
 on other poets. We thought, why not collect poems about bill
 from his friends and fellow poets? (pause: what a great idea!)
 We believe a range of insightful voices speaking about bill
 will create an intoxicating kaleidoscopic reflection-portrait
 almost as interesting and multi-faceted as bill.

 The Endorsement: We presented the idea to bill
 for his blessing and this is what he wrote:
 "yr idea is brillyant love it fine totalee dont know tho
 if thers enuff around abt my work or me 2 make a book
 wud b way fun tho thanks a lot 4 yr brillyans
 raging happee trails mor as it cums in much love
 totalee n rockin love yu bill"

 The Collection: We know bill is modest. Certainly
 we're not alone thinking he's inspired hundreds, if not
 thousands of electric/eclectic poems from friends all
 over the continent, if not galaxies beyond. We welcome
 you to send us your poem(s) about bill for consideration
 in this meaningful anthology. And, we encourage you
 to forward this email to as many friends of bill you think
 might want to write and submit a poem. We are looking
 for poems by poets, painters, songwriters, dancers, actors,
 waitresses, gas jockeys, bus drivers, movie house
 doormen...anyone who knows and loves and
 is inspired by bill.

 The Logistics: We will be in touch with bill, seeking
 his guidance along the way. A visionary publisher
 will be chosen. We imagine a great book release
 reading party in bill's honour. Please submit
 your poem(s), list of people to contact,
 and willingness to participate
 in a timely manner (deadline:
 March 20, 2004) to:
 frenzuvbillbissett@hotmail.com

 Many excellent and raging thanks!
 Sincerely,
 Jeff Pew and Stephen Roxborough,
 Project bill Editors

Poet in its original sense: "maker," "creator," suggests that there's no
necessary crossover to be discussed, no genres to be parsed. When G. Stein
said. "Pablo, stick to painting," or something to this effect, this wouldn't
rule out constructing images through the agency of words. What I'm
approaching is that now, with the advent of digital work, whether one
creates with words or images is a cast of talent and expediency. Perhaps we
need to re-view Art History from the perspective of this century's
aesthetics.

(http://www.ubu.com/) may be of interest to some on the poetics list:

of Orgaz, & Other Poems" (1935-59)
>
> The introduction, excerpted from the forthcoming Exact Change publication
and preceding a selection of the poems, reads as follows:
>

song. -- Picasso to Jaime Sabartés April 1936
> When Pierre Joris and I were compiling Poems for the Millennium we sensed
that Picasso, if he wasn't fully a poet, was incredibly close to the
neighboring poets of his time, and when he brought language into his cubist
works, the words collaged from newspapers were there as something really to
be read. What only appeared to us later was the body of work that emerged
from 1935 on and that showed him to have been a poet in the fullest sense
and possibly, as Michel Leiris points out, "an insatiable player with words
... [who, like] James Joyce ... in his Finnegans Wake, ... displayed an
equal capacity to promote language as a real thing (one might say) . . . and
to use it with as much dazzling liberty."
>
> It was in early 1935, then, that Picasso (then fifty-four years old) began
to write what we will present here as his poetry - a writing that continued,
sometimes as a daily offering, until the summer of 1959. In the now standard
Picasso myth, the onset of the poetry is said to have coincided with a
devastating marital crisis (a financially risky divorce, to be more exact),
because of which his output as a painter halted for the first time in his
life. Writing - as a form of poetry using, largely, the medium of prose -
became his alternative outlet. The flow of words begins abruptly
("privately" his biographer Patrick O'Brian tells us) on 18 april XXXV while
in retreat at Boisgeloup. (He would lose the country place the next year in
a legal settlement.) The pace is rapid, violent, pushing and twisting from
one image to another, not bothering with punctuation, often defying syntax,
expressive of a way of writing/languaging that he had never tried before:
>
> if I should go outside the wolves would come to eat out of my hand just as
my room would seem to be outside of me my other earnings would go off around
the world smashed into smithereens
>
> as one of us has tried to phrase it in translation.
>
> Yet if the poems begin with a sense of personal discomfort and malaise,
there is a world beyond the personal that enters soon thereafter. For
Picasso, like any poet of consequence, is a man fully into his time and into
the terrors that his time presents. Read in that way, "the world smashed
into smithereens" is a reflection also of the state of things between the
two world wars - the first one still fresh in mind and the rumblings of the
second starting up. That's the way the world goes at this time or any other,
Picasso writes a little further on, not as the stricken husband or the
discombobulated lover merely, but as a man, like the aforementioned Joyce,
caught in the "nightmare of history" from which he tries repeatedly to
waken. It is the time and place where poetry becomes - for him as for us -
the only language that makes sense.

Joel,
    This raises the 'doppelganger' phenomenon - those poets who do 'art
work' as well as write.  As an example of one when I draw or otherwise work
gesturally with images the 'poetry' comes from a different place in my body
or more likely my brain.  That's why I'm intrigued by neuropoetics.

Thank goodness for that!  How could I keep feeling
hugely superior to the MLA if they ever let YOU get
some kind of office, Maria!  But if you wanted to get
anywhere in the MLA--of ANYwhere, for that matter--
you shouldda held off on getting published as
co-author of a book with *mIEKAL aND*, for gawdzsake!

Since I'm not a member of the MLA, I saved them great embarrassment. If I
had belonged and they had nominated me, I would have had to resign, in
keeping with Mencken's statement about belonging to any group that would
have him as a member---or officer.

Sorry to intervene here, but Maria should NEVER have published with a guy
whose last name is a conjunction.

For one thing it leaves authorship open: Miekal and who?

SPD will have a table at MLA. A good place to take a look, if you haven't
seen it, at Across the Line / Al otro lado: The Poetry of Baja California,
edited by Harry Polkinhorn and yours truly. Not to mention all the other
goodies they'll be showing.

I watched the Britney Spears bio on E! the other night -- it said that
when she was 12 she tried out and was rejected by the Mickey Mouse
Club.  She was deeply depressed for about a year, and then began to
reinvent herself with a savage fury.  And now look at her career!  The
MLA is about the equivalent of the Mickey Mouse Club in my estimation.
The future looks good for you  from this vantage point. It just means
that there are better things for you to do.

Another viewpoint -- Charlie Altieri once said in a conference that the
reason everybody loves Kafka is that everybody feels that they can't get
justice, and can't even find a proper judge, and they are waiting at the
doors of the palace only to never be let in.  The MLA is just that kind
of institution, I guess.  So big that nobody feels like they are inside
of it, and if you could only get in, life would be different.  But it's
just another Mickey Mouse Club.

Subject:      question about "Defoe" by Leslie Scalapino
In-Reply-To:  <a06001a00bc0b911c998b@[64.48.221.21]>
MIME-Version: 1.0

I am reading this book now and finding it quite
compelling and newly--sadly--relevant as it with
precisely this: historical amnesia during "first" Gulf
War--also how experience is mediated and how language
is whored--

so my question to anyone who has read this book (or
anyone who wrote it!)--do the first and second parts
function as discrete units separate from each other or
is it a unified work with a part 1 and a part 2. the
"narrative" doesn't point this out, neither do the
characters, neither does (oddly) the jacket copy--so
is it strictly a reader's choice or is there an
authorial intent in it.

There's been a lot of discussion about Leslie
Scalapino on the list lately, and it strikes me that
she is one of those writers (I know there are others)
where sometimes you are talking about Leslie Scalapino
but most of the time you are talking about "Leslie
Scalapino" who's less an actual person with quirks and
hurts and personal needs, desires, or even
selfishnesses, and more a socially constructed
aesthetic position. The other thing that's occurred to
me is that many people who discuss Leslie Scalapino or
"Leslie Scalapino" may not (or maybe may--) have read
some of the books she (I mean she--because "she"
hasn't written any books, though this is often argued)
has written.

I'm of the latter, at any rate--hadn't really read
much (a piece here and there) but the recent
discussion made want to read some of the actual text.
I'm not an expert, nor can I really put anything
together in words to describe why I am enjoying
"Defoe" so much, but let me just, as a new reader of
Leslie's, recommend the book as a very interesting,
odd, lyrical, compelling read.

 "Defoe" is resonating oddly against the quotidian
life: driving to work, feeling cold, remember what
I've forgotten, worry about my dad, hearing war
coverage on the radio, etc.--it is like life but also
not like it--perhaps it is written in the same key or
written using the same instruments, or something like
that--in terms of trying to actually *enact* life in
language it feels like Woolf or Stein or Sarraute or
the evening news or the public world/syntactically
impermanence.

so that's it--does anyone know the answer to the
question--?

As more and more scholars demand tolerance it is somewhat exasperating
to watch public spaces close into themselves.  There are now walled
suburbs, and malls in which it is forbidden to "loiter," or to pass out
any kind of political information in that every inch of a mall is owned
by its owners.  City centers are vanishing in the newer towns such as
Silicon Valley and Beaverton, Oregon.  There is no place to exchange
conversation except through cyberspace.  Once or twice a year I can
afford to go to a conference, and there I hope to have some new
impressions, and to meet one new person, and talk with them for several
hours.

And when I read about how lonely and psychologically depressed many of
the poets on this list were a few weeks back it seemed to me that this
is a pervasive phenomenon.

This is partially why I turned to the church.  It's made up of
grandmothers and grandchildren, and all kinds of people in between.
There is no requirement that one be brilliant, or even intelligent.
Retarded people are as acceptable as witty fast talkers.  People of
every race come, and they're accepted.  What I like best is being able
to sing together.  It's so wonderful.  It's really the only bright spot
in terms of a large community (larger than my family) where I don't have
to arrange things for days in advance in order to get together with
people.  The schedule is printed out, so you just have to follow it.

As you look back through English and American literary history a great
number of poets have found sustenance in the church.  EVen gay poets
such as W.H. Auden have found a home there, and this will be
increasingly so -- not only in the Episcopalian church but in many
others.  We have gay people who come to our tiny rural church, and
they're totally accepted.  They're no different from masturbators, my
pastor has told me privately, and who doesn't masturbate?  You have to
look at the bigger picture of who a person is, he said.  This is a rural
church, and even here gay people are totally accepted. In the big cities
many of the members of churches are gay, and increasingly are going to
be leading the services, especially among Episcopalians.

At any rate, I was feeling sorry for all the poets on this list who've
listed themselves as very depressed.  Churches, synagogues, mosques, and
so on, all are open at this season when people can get very isolated.
I'm going to be off list until after Christmas due to family stuff so I
wanted to extend this invitation before I took off.  If you are feeling
lonely on Christmas Day when everything is closed, just go into a
church.  No matter who or what you are you will be accepted.

Churches and religious institutions generally are for all the miserable
outcast people who feel left out and forlorn.  They were like this in
the beginning, and still are -- a place for everyone who has been beaten
by life (and who isn't?) to come and feel safe and in a sense of
communion for a few hours.

Feel welcome.  You don't have to believe in God.  Nobody really does.
Luther himself said that only a lunatic could believe in God.  I don't.
Well, I do when there's a very good song, and I get involved in it, but
for the most part I don't.  Since poets are pretty close to lunatics
maybe they'll have a better chance to believe in God than me.  At any
rate, you don't have to believe in God to go in.  It's not really
possible to be a reasonable person and to believe in God anyway.

Happy Holidays -- Kirby Olson

Hot off the press:

The University of Alabama Press and the Modern and
Contemporary Poetics series are pleased to announce that the
latest title in the series, Brian McHale's "The Obligation Toward the
Difficult Whole: Postmodernist Long Poems" has just been
released. Copies will be available at Alabama booth in the exhibit
hall at MLA. McHale's study is an eclectic analysis of nine long
poems by postmodernist poets both familiar and marginalized.
Addressing subjects as wide ranging as angelology, the court
masque, pop art, caricature, the cult of the ruin, hip-hop, Spencer's
Irish policy, and the aesthetics of silence, McHale identifies a
repertoire of elements characteristic of these long poems, and the
ways they overlap, interfere, echo, amplify and reinforce one
another, forming in the end "a difficult whole."

McHale's book is the winner of the 2002 Elizabeth Agee Prize for
Outstanding Scholarship in the Field of American Literary Studies.

Dear Travis,

  At your request, I'm posting again:

On Dec. 28th, from 6:00-9:00 the Museum of Contemporary Art San Diego at 1001
Kettner
(at Broadway) will host a group reading by poets participating in MLA,
followed by a reception and book signing. 26 poets are scheduled to read for about 5
minutes apiece. Obviously, we didn't know about every poet coming to San
Diego. Putting a list together was a bit of a shot in the dark. We looked through
the PMLA book on top of whatever personal info we had. Sorry to any of you
unjustly overlooked. Hope to see you there anyway.
  Readers include:  David Antin, Rae Armantrout, Susan Briante, Louis Cabri,
Joshua Clover, Michael Davidson, Richard Deming, Stacy Doris, Dan Featherston,
Gloria Gervitz, Carla Harryman, Nancy Kuhl, Hank Lazer, Nicole Markotic, Mark
McMorris, Laura Moriarty, Eileen Myles, Jena Osman, Ted Pearson, Peter Ramos,
Joe Ross, Jerome Rothenberg, Juliana Spahr, Lorenzo Thomas, Pasquale
Verdicchio, Barrett Watten and Elizabeth Willis.

The reading will proceed in more or less alphabetical order. The museum is
near the convention center and hotels.

Hi all -

People have been so nice to my work and Lester's work as of late.  It's
frankly astonishing to me, a thrill.  I want to thank these individuals
for making my holidays softer, warmer.

Here's the rundown:

Andrei Codrescu's journal _Exquisite Corpse_ has published one offensive
poem (picking a fight), one morbid poem (death in 3/4 time), and one
political poem of mine (ahh, the horrors of fighting for an improved
self) in their latest issue:
http://corpse.org.  WARNING: Not for those who have negatively
experience discomfort.  Heh.

Ron Silliman recently reviewed Lester's book, _Be Somebody_.  Get this:
a review while in manuscript(!) form.  It's almost unheard of.  Yeah,
the book remains unpublished; Lester has been known to shudder at the
cruelty of this world.  No longer.  How kind of Ron to not only read it,
but to review it, review it glowingly, review it intelligently, and
place the review on his highly-regarded blog.  As a conceptual work
Lester's book has puzzled even the best of readers, but not Ron, not in
the slightest.  Lester and I are both stunned, shocked, overwhelmed, &
excited at its reception.

(If you can't use the above long web addresses, you can also get to the
articles via links at the top of:
http://proximate.org/works/htm).

Chris Murray runs a wonderful blog called _TexFiles_
(http://texfiles.blogspot.com/) where she regularly runs a "Poet of the
Week" feature.  She made me poet of the week this week.  Each day this
week she will post a poem of mine along with an mp3 for each piece.
Thanks Chris!

Dave Bircumshaw runs a great journal called _A Chide's Alphabet_ which
recently released its third issue.  He has given a number of my poems
the light of day in his new issue.
http://www.chidesalphabet.org.uk/
How nice of David to include some of my poems alongside the work of such
fantastic writers as Philip Nikolayev, Sheila Murphy, Mark Weiss,
Harriet Zinnes, and Pierre Joris.

On the home front, I wrote a poem for the Town of Carrboro (my home in
North Carolina) which at a later yet-to-be-determined date will be
placed on a public mural in the downtown area.  The poem is entitled, "I
am not a wall."  Thanks to the hard work of the Carrboro Arts Committee,
Jackie Helvey-Hayes and Catherine DeVine, for putting the mural in
motion and for asking me to write a poem for it.  I feel honored and
privileged.  Jackie and Catherine have worked hard to improve the
quality of community arts initiatives, and have taken a bit of heat for
that hard work.  They deserve every bit off appreciation due to them.

Finally (phew!), I will be giving a reading along with Joe Donahue at
Sizl Gallery in Carrboro (http://sizlgallery.com/) on January 22nd at
8pm.  Poet Ken Rumble has moved his Desert City Reading Series from
Winston-Salem North Carolina to Carrboro.  The reading should last about
an hour and wine will likely be served.  The date is not yet fixed in
stone.  Thanks Ken.

So thanks Andrei, Ron, Chris, Dave, Jackie, Catherine, and Ken.  Thanks
for making my efforts feel appreciated.

Oh I need to add a big hearty thanks to shirlette ammons, Doug Stuber,
Chuck Fager, and Evie Shockley for reading at the Poets Against the
Shrub reading this past October.  I learned a lot about how not to run a
reading, but despite my organizational shortcomings, they were
marvelous.  A special thanks to Temple Ball and Rick Ramirez for making
it happen.


Patrick

Looking from across the Atlantic here, a few things come to mind.

1. I'm not a blogger nor a blog-looker in the main, but Ron's is one I do
drop in on because of its range, its links, and its general food for
thought, that always hungry creature.

2. Of particular interest to me of late has been Ron's engagement with James
Rother's articles in CPR - I've been following the same - my perspective
being that of a Brit who is dissatisfied with the predominant poetic culture
over here and who is scratching his head ion bewilderment at why some US
editors seem to want to take that establishment voice as a model for the US
and its poetics, pace Hall's standard of desirable British models and, too,
more recently, Dana Gioia's resurrection of something similar. Rother's
wonderfully over-written and over-charged articles are a delight, both in
what one could contend with and what one agrees with. My own perspective
remains one of head-scratching, what on earth is Neo-Formalism and why do
some Americans want it? Although it can seem so, I don't think there is an
equivalent over here, gestures towards such, maybe, but no more, if anything
it is a matter of neo-bourgeoisisme, sometimes on the surface formal, but
really being a congerie of socially-coded language that transmits a message
of being in positions of importance, like our anodyne Poet Laureate, whom
Andrew Duncan rightly characterised as having 'the right combination of
reason and mediocrity'. It is very difficult to see someone like Simon
Armitage, whose declared metrics consist of 'making sure the lines are of
roughly the same length' as any kind of a formalist, rather as a kind of
voice for literate young-to-middling arts administrators and their like, a
voice of the jaunty joking up-and-coming.

Some of them I can quite like at times: last night on BBC 4 there was a
programme linked by Sean O'Brien about piano tuners, it was warm and human
and not presented by the poems of O'Brien the literary bully-boy, which he
can be, but rather a human being speaking other humans with humanity. I know
that in the States you do not have quite anything like the Beeb, nor our own
culture's peculiar combination of awareness of the arts (where else in the
world could there have been a Parliamentary debate on the declining
standards of national poetry, as there was in The House of Lords a few years
back?) with out-and-out philistinism, not for nothing are we the home of the
gutter press, nor does our arts funding, apart from the lucky few, compare
with the dollars that can still be awash in Uncle Sam's domains.

3. Nowhere could I be more aware of being an outsider looking-in than in the
furore over Ron's remarks on Leslie - I just thought it was a piece of
fulsome praise but realise from the responses that there are signals,
issues, going on that I simply cannot read. One little note - remember, you
wonderful infuriating gifted noisy Americans that what is native to you is
not necessarily meaningful outside the States, try to understand that we are
other, that is.

All the Best AND A MERRY CHRISTMAS

Kirby, I agree. Churches are full of normal people, and that's one reason I
love mine. In St. Louis, what better place to hang out than at New City
Fellowship with people from Mexico, Congo, Ethiopia, France, students from
Washington University, University of Missouri, Forest Park Community
college, truckers, carpenters, lawyers, artists, poets, musicians, doctors?
Singing, dancing, eating, talking, laughing, and arguing!   By george, it's
Whitmanesque! Everyone's invited.

And everyone is also invited to my yearly bowling party --
http://belz.net/2004/ -- Just let me know how many people you plan to bring.
We'll probably have 200 this year. I got wind that all of the New City
Fellowship Ethiopians are going to be there with all their kids, so that
would be a good chance to meet them.

And more to the point of this list, I DO HOPE you will consider attending a
reading or two in the City Museum series -- http://belz.net/readings/.  Why
not visit in April to see Mary Jo Bang and Susan Schultz?  The Cardinals
will kick off their summer schedule then, too, so you have the opportunity
to kill two birds with one stone.

With warm regards,
AB

Tuesday, Dec. 30: 10-11

I'd be pleased to talk to anyone about projects that you're working on
that might become future MCP Series titles. And I'd be glad to talk to
you about forthcoming MCP books by Michael Magee, Jed Rasula, Marjorie
Perloff, Aldon Nielsen, Rosmarie Waldrop, Brian McHale, Ben Friedlander,
Abigail Childs, Peter Middleton, and recent MCP books such as
Architectural Body by Madeline Gins and Arakawa and Another South:

fantastic writers as Philip Nikolayev, Sheila Murphy, Mark Weiss,
Harriet Zinnes, and Pierre Joris.<

Your fine poems were fit for their company, Patrick. All the Best from a
flu-and-cold-afflicted Britain (where it seems that a higher proportion of
the population die from hypothermia and related illnesses than do in Finland
or Russia, typically pensioners who can't afford their winter fuel bills, it
is expected that somewhat over 2,000 will die in the cold spell that hangs
over this festive week, however we are only the +fourth+ richest economy in
the world so obviously the cost would be too high and the government has
sent out leaflets and they do get Cold Weather Payments - after the bills
they can't pay. A govt spokesman has said that 'strenuous efforts are made
to persuade elderly people to keep warm but winter always takes Britain by
surprise)

Hi all -

People have been so nice to my work and Lester's work as of late.  It's
frankly astonishing to me, a thrill.  I want to thank these individuals
for making my holidays softer, warmer.

Here's the rundown:

Andrei Codrescu's journal _Exquisite Corpse_ has published one offensive
poem (picking a fight), one morbid poem (death in 3/4 time), and one
political poem of mine (ahh, the horrors of fighting for an improved
self) in their latest issue:
http://corpse.org.  WARNING: Not for those who have negatively
experience discomfort.  Heh.

Ron Silliman recently reviewed Lester's book, _Be Somebody_.  Get this:
a review while in manuscript(!) form.  It's almost unheard of.  Yeah,
the book remains unpublished; Lester has been known to shudder at the
cruelty of this world.  No longer.  How kind of Ron to not only read it,
but to review it, review it glowingly, review it intelligently, and
place the review on his highly-regarded blog.  As a conceptual work
Lester's book has puzzled even the best of readers, but not Ron, not in
the slightest.  Lester and I are both stunned, shocked, overwhelmed, &
excited at its reception.

(If you can't use the above long web addresses, you can also get to the
articles via links at the top of:
http://proximate.org/works/htm).

Chris Murray runs a wonderful blog called _TexFiles_
(http://texfiles.blogspot.com/) where she regularly runs a "Poet of the
Week" feature.  She made me poet of the week this week.  Each day this
week she will post a poem of mine along with an mp3 for each piece.
Thanks Chris!

Dave Bircumshaw runs a great journal called _A Chide's Alphabet_ which
recently released its third issue.  He has given a number of my poems
the light of day in his new issue.
http://www.chidesalphabet.org.uk/
How nice of David to include some of my poems alongside the work of such
fantastic writers as Philip Nikolayev, Sheila Murphy, Mark Weiss,
Harriet Zinnes, and Pierre Joris.

On the home front, I wrote a poem for the Town of Carrboro (my home in
North Carolina) which at a later yet-to-be-determined date will be
placed on a public mural in the downtown area.  The poem is entitled, "I
am not a wall."  Thanks to the hard work of the Carrboro Arts Committee,
Jackie Helvey-Hayes and Catherine DeVine, for putting the mural in
motion and for asking me to write a poem for it.  I feel honored and
privileged.  Jackie and Catherine have worked hard to improve the
quality of community arts initiatives, and have taken a bit of heat for
that hard work.  They deserve every bit off appreciation due to them.

Finally (phew!), I will be giving a reading along with Joe Donahue at
Sizl Gallery in Carrboro (http://sizlgallery.com/) on January 22nd at
8pm.  Poet Ken Rumble has moved his Desert City Reading Series from
Winston-Salem North Carolina to Carrboro.  The reading should last about
an hour and wine will likely be served.  The date is not yet fixed in
stone.  Thanks Ken.

So thanks Andrei, Ron, Chris, Dave, Jackie, Catherine, and Ken.  Thanks
for making my efforts feel appreciated.

Oh I need to add a big hearty thanks to shirlette ammons, Doug Stuber,
Chuck Fager, and Evie Shockley for reading at the Poets Against the
Shrub reading this past October.  I learned a lot about how not to run a
reading, but despite my organizational shortcomings, they were
marvelous.  A special thanks to Temple Ball and Rick Ramirez for making
it happen.


Patrick

Hi everyone, just sending along a last minute shameless plug: I'll be presenting
a paper at the MLA conference on what should prove to be a very interesting
panel, "Emersonian Poetics in Contemporary Avant-Garde Poetry." My paper is
entitled, "The Motives of Emancipated Prose: Emerson and the Collaborative
Reader," and is distilled from a chapter in my forthcoming U Alabama book to
which Hank alludes below, _Emancipating Pragmatism: Emerson, Jazz and
Experimental Writing_.  The other panel particpants are Hank himself, Joel
Bettridge and Richard Deming.  Hope to see some of you there!

I find this site most better than most of what I read in the news - at least
as a way of taking the human/Iraqi temperature in Baghdad. It's clearly
unpretty scary if you are there. No one sure of what's to come, what can
unwind its dark source. The intimations and implications of Civil War.

INFO: new york city--amiri baraka/black music symposium
==============================================

Symposium to Examine the Study of Black Music


Yonkers, NY, December, 2003 - Inspired by the work of Amiri Baraka (LeRoi

Jones), particularly his 1963 history Blues People: Negro Music in White

America, a generation of scholars in the field of jazz and blues music

criticism was born, creating a legitimate space in the academy for the

serious study of African American music. "Blues People: 40 Years Later, A

Symposium" to be held at Sarah Lawrence College February 6 - 7, will

honor Baraka's artistic legacy as well as focus attention on the

pioneering scholarship that has grown out of those early years of the

study of this uniquely American culture.


Blues People was the first book-length history written by an African

American that addressed the social, musical, economic, and cultural

influences of the blues and jazz (which Baraka refers to as "Negro

music") on American history. Symposium panels and lectures will speak to

diverse aspects of jazz studies, including women's roles, black

nationalism, and the development of rap music.


Baraka's approach to music criticism was different from anything else

that existed when he first began writing in the 1950s and 60s, partly

because    he was the only black writer in a field of white critics. Komozi

Woodard, professor    of history at Sarah Lawrence and the organizer of the

symposium commented: "He    was not simply describing the music, but he

fashioned a type of writing that was itself an artistic performance about

music."


The symposium will culminate in a music and poetry performance by Baraka's

group, "Blue Ark" that includes poets, blues singers, and other    musicians

led by saxophonist and professor of jazz studies at Rutgers University,

Herbie Morgan. The group has performed in numerous countries around the

world.


The symposium's participants themselves reflect the growing recognition

of jazz's academic significance in higher education. Blues and jazz have

come of age in the university. For example, one of the featured
panelists is

Ingrid Monson, first appointed holder of Harvard University's Quincy Jones

Chair created in 2000 to devote scholarship to jazz music and its

implications in the African American experience. Monson will speak on a

panel along with John Szwed of Yale University who will address "The Folk

Communities of Amiri Baraka and Ralph Ellison," as well as Travis Jackson

of the University of Chicago.

I have never bought this Happy Holidays poppycock-- If you celebrate
Christmas, Merry Christmas, Chanukah, Happy Chanukah and also Happy Kwanza,
Happy Eid . But I for one am not celebrating generic Wal Mart holidays. I
hate Santa Claus, I hate the commercialism. I think the real spirit of the
season is a belief in miracles, weather those miracles are found by extra
oil in temple, God born as a child, or the the fact that Abraham stopped
Sacrificing his son by god's hand (Eid) that is what it is about and you
dont have to believe in God G-d or Allah to believe in miracles. Miracles
are in full view everyday in fine poems, the birth of children, great art,
and more.

Happy Holidays was invented by retailers to make as much money as possible
which is the opposite of miracles.  So look for the miracles eat too much,
get drunk, sleep all day, revel, revel, revel. Enjoy it all for all these
miracles are ours because we are human.

god took us away from ourselves, god brought up back!

these words, printed on the starry heavens!
what could they mean?
thousands flock to cathedrals and synagogues!
there are hosannas on earth and in heaven!
through god the world has been restored!
humanity is bathed in holy joy!
prayers rise to the vaulted ceilings!
miraculous sounds and lights!
angels flock bringing peace to one and all!
praise to worlds and deities!
praise to the lowest and highest!
hosanna! hosanna!

Subject:      Critiques of Trauma Theory
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii" ; format="flowed"

Last week sometime the topic of theories of trauma was raised. Sorry
to be a bit tardy w this, but I think some of the most incisive
writing on trauma theory's deployment in recent literary/cultural
criticism appears in the Fall 2000 (#46) issue of Cultural Critique,
titled "Trauma and Its Cultural Aftereffects," guest-edited by one of
Maria Damon's former students, Karyn Ball. Karyn gives a useful
introduction to the history of its emergence in recent criticism,
adding in the end only as much Heidegger as is healthy, and John
Mowitt's wonderfully written article "Trauma Envy" really does some
nasty neo-Marxist damage to the attempts of
hot-airballoonshot-spitbaboonshot-babespitoons like Slavoj Zizek to
reappropriate "the Wound."

Also of interest is a special issue of West Coast Line (spring 2003,
double-numbered as #40 and 37/1) "Violence and its Alternatives,"
eds. Trish Graham, Coleen Gold, & Jerry Zaslove, that includes
several interesting essays on trauma and poesis. Under the editorship
of Glen Lowry (a former student of Roy Miki in Vancouver, he of the
amazing poetry book Surrender), WCL has really reached new levels of
quality and intellectual focus.

Cathy Caruth, one of the pioneers of recent literary critical use of
theories of trauma, was also mentioned in an earlier post on this
list. In an interview of the eminent psychoanalyst Jean Laplanche
that Caruth conducted in 1994, JL gives an innovative description of
trauma as the belated pre-linguistic translation of undecipherable
force. (I don't have time to unpack that, but if you're interested,
go to the book Topologies of Trauma: Essays on the Limit of Knowledge
and Memory, eds. Linda Belau and Petar Ramadanovic [NY: Other Press,
2002].) From what I've read, Caruth seems to be an admirably humble
scholar who has not hesitated to declare her own work's inadequacies.
But, in my present thinking, her early book Unclaimed Experience
still remains more helpful than most of the thousands of pages that
have been published since on trauma and culture/literature (excepting
of course such work as what I've cited above). One reason being the
insightfulness of her close readings (see her interpretation of the
film Hiroshima, Mon Amour) and another being that one of the
paradigms that, following Freud, she focuses on from the beginning is
one in which the aggressor is also traumatized by his own unknowing
wounding of beloved others. This necessarily leads to important
debates and remonstrations, but it takes courage to maintain
consideration of this aspect in the face of polarized "wound culture."

Thanks for the info, Walter.  I suspected it was a complex issue.  It's
unfortunate this hits the list over winter break.  Happy holidays all.

I have been querying the usual suspects about how/where to find
Anglophone scholars/scholarship on the great Turkish poet Nazim
Hikmet, esp. in regard to the relation of his work to his communist
nationalism. But have not been coming up w much. Wd be deeply
appreciated if someone cd point me to something or someone besides
Randy & Mutlu Konuk Blasing's translations and Goksu & Timms'

valuable work). Dankon.

Now, now, mIEKAL, you know that the reason no one
wanting to stay in the good graces of the MLA should
associate with you is not your academic standing but
the fact that you are a Menace to Proper Literature!
In spite of when your birthday is and its standing
(which is less, by the way, than Groundhog Day, which
is my birthday).

Hmmm, at first I read the above as "I'm not, Bob,"
Not-Bob.  That some reader might take you to be saying
about myself what mIEKAL said about himself really
worried me because I only dropped out of college 7
times, and my birthday is CERTAINLY not 25 December.
So I thought I had better clarify everything right
away.  My whole career could go down the tubes due to
a misreading of what you said.

Dear Friends:

I realize suddenly that MANY of you did not receive my announcement
regarding Involuntary Vision. If you have received this twice, I
apologize. Perhaps it will make you twice as eager to purchase the
book??!

Involuntary Vision: after Akira Kurosawa’s Dreams is finally available
from Avenue B books. It is the first representative collection of “The
New Brutalism,” and it’s sure to knock your socks off!  Included here
are new poems by Eli Drabman, Geoffrey Dyer, James Meetze, Tanya
Brolaski, Cynthia Sailers, Trevor Calvert, Stephen Ratcliffe, Elizabeth
Willis, Julia Bloch, Ryan Bartlett, and myself.

Here’s a little tidbit:

Elizabeth Willis:

The tree has an eye
for temporary stardust
It’s Tuesday on Wednesday
The woman left you
to wooden shoes
Forget what you see
that never was
your sweetest georgic

Tanya Brolaski:

II. Iconostasis (The Peach Orchard)

We speak with apples in our mouths, like animated meats. Nothing is
worse than the improbable evil twin, our pigness. With her peach shrine
my breath, a spy in the brigade. The menacing peaches paused. And so?
I’m swearing in the gilded lily, the pansiest of pansy that cried at
the behest
of blossoms. Baltic’s taken her new lover to a green, a green, a green.
And
tucked her nicely...

Involuntary Vision is stunningly produced and is readily available via
Small Press Distribution (www.spdbooks.org—search the title) or Amazon
(www.amazon.com—again, search the title). Though Amazon is often a
favorite for its convenience, I ask you to consider SPD first, as it is
an extremely important service available to small presses, and it is
not for profit (meaning it needs our support!). And really, when it
comes down to it, SPD is just as convenient! You may also purchase
Involuntary Vision by sending a check for seven dollars (big discount!)
to my home address: 434 Ashland Ave / Buffalo, NY 14222. A copy will be
placed promptly into the hands of our trusty national postal service,
and delivered to your door in a number of days.

Also, if you happen to be in the Bay Area on January 4th, many of the
poets represented in the collection will be reading at Diesel Books in
Oakland (on College Avenue in the Rockridge District) at 2:00pm. Join
them for fun and libations.

I hope you all are well!

Michael

Thanks to Walter Lew for the heads up on the recent issue of *Cultural

when trauma theory is good, it's very good, but when it's bad--. I don't
know of any online sources, to return to an earlier discussion.

I guess you are right, Barrett, I was taking a clinical perspective but it
does seem to me that if 'trauma theory' is to intrude on people' and
authors' lives as happened here recently although probaly not intentionally
it should be based on psychological research.  For example there is good
research which has built up over the last ten or fifteen years that suggests
that writing that does resolve trauma doesn't have to be 'good' writing and
the search for quality interferes at times with resolution.  It's also
'clinically' true that talking about trauma theory is a way of not dealing
with trauma although I haven't seen any research on this.  In any event best
wishes all for a happy and healthy holiday.

Your reference to Hikmet's "communist nationalism" is interesting. Nazim=20
Hikmet was a supporter of Kemal Ata=FCrk, the founder of the modern Turkish=20
Republic. The Turkish left supported the War of Independence against the all=
ies. But=20
Atat=FCrk banned the Communist party after the Republic was established in 1=
923.=20
Nazim Hikmet was put in jail I think around 1930.

Nazim Hikmet's work, particularly Human Landscapes from My Country, reflects=
=20
that basic ambiguity between (or sythesis of) his feelings for the Turkish=20
landscape and an internationalist humanism.

The introduction to my anthology Eda: an Anthology of Contemporary Turkish=20
Poetry, which is definitely coming out by Talisman at the end of February,=20
discusses Hikmet's relation to Turkish poetry. My translations are full of H=
ikmet's=20
peculiar synthesis. A passage from Human Lanscapes from My country ends with=
=20
a specific reference to Atat=FCrk. His prison poems fuse a yearning for the=20=
city=20
of Istanbul and his wife with a universalist ideology. This occurs through=20
sweeping cadences, which I call eda and are the essential aspect of Turkish=20
poetry.

We here in North Carolina have also been cold/flu afflicted for some
time.  I spent the last three weeks of November sick sick sick.  I
thought I was better about a week and a half into it, and then 36 hours
it came roaring back, with an debilitating cough that wouldn't let me
sleep or rest.  So many others have been stricken.  Quite a few healthy
people have died as a result of that cold/flu.  So if you get it, or if
anyone you know gets it, make sure they have some strong cough medicine
and get plenty of water.  And stay in bed!

I believe that much of the wealthy in Britain like in America cherish
the misfortunes of those with lesser fortune(s): wealth can only
distinguish itself if it makes the bearer of said riches seem better
than those without the riches.  So "make sure that the wealth deprives
others!" is the tacit catchphrase of the rich of America and their
cousins (in many cases, literally cousins) to the right of the pond.  If
that wealth does not deprive others of money, then it doesn't really
feel like wealth at all, right?  Wealth that does not deprive others
obscures the addictive illusion of privilege and higher rank, of being
better than others.  (Backchannel defenses of the filthy rich are
welcome but only if you let me post them to the list.)  Charitable work
and philanthropy merely provide opportunities for the wealthy to
experience their fortunes by observing the lack of fortune experienced
by those less fortunate.  Oh and the demonstrated dependencies entailed
by philanthropy and charity bring along with them additional sadistic
pleasure.  "...generosity is the coin flip/of calamity."  I must defer
to Bunuel & Carrierre for this insight.

"By surprise" my a$$!

Your fine poems were fit for their company, Patrick. All the Best from a
flu-and-cold-afflicted Britain (where it seems that a higher proportion
of the population die from hypothermia and related illnesses than do in
Finland or Russia, typically pensioners who can't afford their winter
fuel bills, it is expected that somewhat over 2,000 will die in the cold
spell that hangs over this festive week, however we are only the
+fourth+ richest economy in the world so obviously the cost would be too
high and the government has sent out leaflets and they do get Cold
Weather Payments - after the bills they can't pay. A govt spokesman has
said that 'strenuous efforts are made to persuade elderly people to keep
warm but winter always takes Britain by
surprise)

Hi all -

People have been so nice to my work and Lester's work as of late.  It's
frankly astonishing to me, a thrill.  I want to thank these individuals
for making my holidays softer, warmer.

Here's the rundown:

Andrei Codrescu's journal _Exquisite Corpse_ has published one offensive
poem (picking a fight), one morbid poem (death in 3/4 time), and one
political poem of mine (ahh, the horrors of fighting for an improved
self) in their latest issue:
http://corpse.org.  WARNING: Not for those who have negatively
experience discomfort.  Heh.

Ron Silliman recently reviewed Lester's book, _Be Somebody_.  Get this:
a review while in manuscript(!) form.  It's almost unheard of.  Yeah,
the book remains unpublished; Lester has been known to shudder at the
cruelty of this world.  No longer.  How kind of Ron to not only read it,
but to review it, review it glowingly, review it intelligently, and
place the review on his highly-regarded blog.  As a conceptual work
Lester's book has puzzled even the best of readers, but not Ron, not in
the slightest.  Lester and I are both stunned, shocked, overwhelmed, &
excited at its reception.

www.ronsilliman.blogspot.com/2003_11_01_ronsilliman_archive.html#1069851
89792633838
(If you can't use the above long web addresses, you can also get to the
articles via links at the top of: http://proximate.org/works/htm).

Chris Murray runs a wonderful blog called _TexFiles_
(http://texfiles.blogspot.com/) where she regularly runs a "Poet of the
Week" feature.  She made me poet of the week this week.  Each day this
week she will post a poem of mine along with an mp3 for each piece.
Thanks Chris!

Dave Bircumshaw runs a great journal called _A Chide's Alphabet_ which
recently released its third issue.  He has given a number of my poems
the light of day in his new issue. http://www.chidesalphabet.org.uk/ How
nice of David to include some of my poems alongside the work of such
fantastic writers as Philip Nikolayev, Sheila Murphy, Mark Weiss,
Harriet Zinnes, and Pierre Joris.

On the home front, I wrote a poem for the Town of Carrboro (my home in
North Carolina) which at a later yet-to-be-determined date will be
placed on a public mural in the downtown area.  The poem is entitled, "I
am not a wall."  Thanks to the hard work of the Carrboro Arts Committee,
Jackie Helvey-Hayes and Catherine DeVine, for putting the mural in
motion and for asking me to write a poem for it.  I feel honored and
privileged.  Jackie and Catherine have worked hard to improve the
quality of community arts initiatives, and have taken a bit of heat for
that hard work.  They deserve every bit off appreciation due to them.

Finally (phew!), I will be giving a reading along with Joe Donahue at
Sizl Gallery in Carrboro (http://sizlgallery.com/) on January 22nd at
8pm.  Poet Ken Rumble has moved his Desert City Reading Series from
Winston-Salem North Carolina to Carrboro.  The reading should last about
an hour and wine will likely be served.  The date is not yet fixed in
stone.  Thanks Ken.

So thanks Andrei, Ron, Chris, Dave, Jackie, Catherine, and Ken.  Thanks
for making my efforts feel appreciated.

Oh I need to add a big hearty thanks to shirlette ammons, Doug Stuber,
Chuck Fager, and Evie Shockley for reading at the Poets Against the
Shrub reading this past October.  I learned a lot about how not to run a
reading, but despite my organizational shortcomings, they were
marvelous.  A special thanks to Temple Ball and Rick Ramirez for making
it happen.


Patrick

Subject:      RE Hikmet and the genocide
Mime-Version: 1.0

Maria:
This is an excellent question. I'm sure I shd defer to Murat on it,
but let me just mention that Kurdish and Armenian activists regularly
quote Hikmet and consider him a hero for speaking out against not
only the Armenian genocide, but also brutal treatment of the Kurds,
as well as resistance to imperialism all around the world (as in
Korea). Even now (I believe) the Turkish government cannot resolve to
restore his citizenship posthumously (one issue being whether or not
Hikmet wd have accepted it). Hikmet's communism placed him in
opposition to fascist attempts to eradicate all traces of culture and
ethnicity that were not assimilated to official Turkish culture. As a
consequence, he spent nearly a third of his life in prison and lived
his last years in exile in the USSR. The situation is complicated by
the fact that the Turkish government knows that Hikmet is a
world-class poet, but only wants to honor him if all mention of his
criticisms of the Turkish nation-state are excised. Thus, to give an
example, during the recent centenary celebrations of his birth, those
who sang or recited his poems for CDs, concerts, etc. regularly cut
out of his poems those verses that allude to the violence perpetrated
upon the Armenian and Kurdish peoples. I found a schizophrenic
nationalist website that, in one section, protests against feature
films, such as Atom Egoyan's _Ararat_ (which I have not seen), that
deal w the Armenian genocide while in another it celebrates Hikmet's
poetry w/o of course mentioning why he is so revered by those who
seek to commemorate what the Turkish state denies.

I have only a superficial knowledge of the history and biographical
questions involved here, have many questions myself in regard to the
chronology of Hikmet's political stances, and, like I sd, defer to
Murat or anyone else more familiar w the topic. Unfortunately the
book that I shd be looking at for more detailed research is locked
away in the university library, closed until January due to state
budget cuts. ARNOULD, pleez komm and blast the doors open! Merry
Christmas.

ACTION: stop a modern day lynching
=============================

Please share this information with the people on your list serve.  This
is

an innocent man's life at hand.  PLEASE SHARE THIS WITH ANYONE WITH A
HALF A

MIND AND CAN READ AND UNDERSTAND THE INJUSTICES GOING ON HERE!



My name is Maurice Thompson and I would like to bring to your attention
the

injustices that are being perpetrated through the judicial system here
in

Middle Georgia. The Yamassee Native American Moors of the Creek Nation,

U.N.N.M., B.I.A. Registry No. 208/1999 have been enduring an ongoing
feud

with the Sheriff of Putnam County, Sheriff Howard Richard Sills, Badge#
117,

since 1997 mostly dealing with building and zoning violations on our 476

acre Native American Village, Wahanee, in Putnam County, Georgia, which
got

extensive media in national newspapers such as the Weekly World News,
The

New York Times, Time Magazine, The Hartford Inquirer, The New York
Press,

The New York Daily Challenge, Amsterdam News and the Source. This feud
has

lead up to the current incarceration of our Maku ‚ÄúChief‚Äù Black
Thunderbird

‚ÄúEagle‚Äù AKA Malachi York on child molestation charges in the State
and

Federal court systems and their only evidence admittedly is double and

triple hear say. They have NO DNA, NO MEDICAL OR PHYSICAL EVIDENCE that
any

of these alleged crimes ever occurred NO VIDEO TAPES AND NO PICTURES.
Maku

‚ÄúChief‚Äù Black Thunderbird ‚ÄúEagle‚Äù has been indicted 5 times to
cover up

previous mistakes over the past 2 years. Maku ‚ÄúChief‚Äù Black
Thunderbird

‚ÄúEagle‚Äù was recently indicted now on RICO charges stating that our
entire

tribe was established to molest children; this is a blatant misuse of
the

judicial system. The federal government has filed a civil case to
forfeit

our land and is also seeking to forfeit the property in the criminal
case.

THIS IS CLEARLY A MOTIVE FUELED BY VINDICTIVENESS.


It has been almost 2 years since the arrest of our Chief on May 8, 2002.

Maku ‚ÄúChief‚Äù Black Thunderbird ‚ÄúEagle‚Äù AKA Malachi York, a 58
year old man

with a life threatening illness, Hereditary Angioedema, has been
tortured

and held with out bond or a trial for almost 2 years, while the State
and

Federal court prosecutors search for evidence to prove their case that
has

obviously been fabricated due to the power and prestige, that America

classifies as a ‚ÄúBlack Leader‚Äù. In fact who they have incarcerated
is a

Chief of a Native American Indigenous tribe that has continued to exist

since before the formulation of the United States of America in 1776
A.D.

The Yamassee Native American Moors of the Creek Nation, U.N.N.M., B.I.A.

Registry No. 208/1999 respect the laws, rights, and freedoms of all

governments and nations as perpetuated in the Human Rights Declaration
of

the United Nations.


The Yamassee Native American Moors of the Creek Nation, U.N.N.M., B.I.A.

Registry No. 208/1999 have existed in peace and will continue to exist
in

peace yet our cries are going unheard. We are calling upon you to assist
us

by exposing the blatant misuse of the judicial system due to vengeance
and

negative aspirations of racist local government officials. We have
presented

facts to show how the case against Maku ‚ÄúChief‚Äù Black Thunderbird
‚ÄúEagle‚Äù
is

racially motivated, we have exposed the lies of the alleged victims
granted

immunity by the federal government and state government, yet these facts

remain ignored and our chief having been denied bond, remains
incarcerated

for the simple fact of being defined a leader.


On December 16, 2003 Judge C. Ashley Royal the presiding judge over the

Wally Hedrick, 75, a Beat-Generation Painter, Is Dead
By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

BODEGA, Calif., Dec. 25 (AP) - Wally Hedrick, an iconoclastic artist and
leading member of the Beat generation in San Francisco, died at his home
in Sonoma County on Dec. 17. He was 75.

The cause was congestive heart failure, his family said.

Mr. Hedrick was a prolific painter whose works shared gallery space with
painters like Jackson Pollock, Bruce Conner, Jay DeFeo and Deborah
Remington.

He founded the Six Gallery, a major gathering spot for Beat artists and
writers in the 1950's. It was there that Allen Ginsberg gave the first
reading of his poem "Howl."

Despite his renown, Mr. Hedrick tended to shun the art world and rarely
made appearances even at his own exhibitions.

"He had a love-hate relationship with the art world, wanting to be part
of it and not wanting to be part of it," said Catherine Conlin, his
partner for the last 13 years.

Drafted into the Army in 1951 against his will, Mr. Hedrick's works took
on an antiwar stance after he was sent to the Korean War.

To protest the Vietnam War, Mr. Hedrick canceled classes at the San
Francisco Art Institute, where he taught.

"For two semesters he put a big black sign saying `Classes canceled
until the end of the war,' " said his son, Max La Riviere-Hedrick.

Mr. Hedrick was married to Jay DeFeo, best known for her two-story-tall,
2,300-pound painting, "The Rose." Their marriage ended in divorce.

In addition to his son, Mr. Hedrick is survived by his sister, Patty
Hedrick.

this is so important-- but-- as Wal Mart is getting into the book business
it might be good
to try to unionize Wal Mart.

My instant two thoughts when hearing about the attempt
to unionize bookstore workers are:

(1) what would more likely finally completely ruin
independent bookstore proprietors than a bookstore
workers union?

(2) the unionization of theatre workers is at least as
responsible as the greed of theatre owners for the
dismal state of American Drama

To avoid not being CONSTRUCTIVE, here's an idea I just
had for helping out the really exploited workers,
writers with functioning minds: make it a law that
anyone buying a book put out by a commercial publisher
must at the same time buy one small-press title, or
two micro-press titles, at the same price.  Two
obvious problems: (1) pseudo small and micro presses
would outdo genuine small and micro presses because
they could print throw-away books cheaply and would
have no writers or editors to pay, and their  wares
would be as likely to be taken as serious small or
micro press books; and (2) hardly anyone would read a
small or micro press book he'd been forced to buy.

Solution to the first problem: the publisher of any
small or micro press book taken with a commercial book
would be paid only his cost of publication (to be
determined from some set of guidelines involving
number pages, type of cover, grade of paper, etc.).
The extra money would go to the bookstore owner to
help make up what he'd lose by being forced to, in
effect, double the cost of his best sellers.

I think the second problem would be minimal because
having to take a second book would force best-seller
buyers to find small or micro press books they thought
they might like.  They'd have to experiment!  In any
case, the small and micro press books would be
circulated.  Perhaps, since people would have to buy
them, they'd be discussed in the media, too.  Some
would jump into commerciality--at least my assumption
is that a fair number of small and micro press books
fail to gain a readership only because of their
obscurity, not because they lack appeal.  And small
and micro press publishers would not lose any more
money than they lose already.

Okay, I'm through.

--Bob G.

Subject:      For the translation
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii; format=flowed
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

What happens to a poem when it is translated into a language that has
passed through vastly different historical experiences, if it's the
problem of access to the history in which the poem in its first
language is immersed that the translation encounters, and which one
tends to read past, even when the languages mirror each other on
facing pages?

"If we are truly interested in historicizing the literature we teach
[and the literature we read and write?], then we must develop subtler
means of assessing the historical and political functions of
literature in its own and for our times. We need more varied standards
of political and thus aesthetic judgment if we are to respect the
complexity of literature's 'action' in a historical moment, especially
when such a moment is defined by crisis and conflict." (79).

This particular authority (John Carlos Rowe, Literary Culture and U.S.
Imperialism, Oxford: Oxford Univ. Press, 2000), gives particular
attention to Du Bois' 1934 eulogy to Stalin, "With his confidence in
the emancipatory project of Enlightenment rationality ... Du Bois made
some of the same mistakes as many twentieth-century Marxists, who
clung to the modernist ideals of social revolution long after they had
become irrelevant to the economic, political and cultural hierarchies
dictated by First World postindustrialism." (215). The apparent need
to defend Du Bois for inclusion in a 'post-nationalist' curriculum in
American Studies brings to mind Zukofsky's Vertov-like use of Popular
Front materials in "A"-8, although the rhetorical means applied by the
scholar are hardly subtle, i.e., "One of the few intellectuals of his
generation to understand that modern imperialism had to be combated at
a cultural level, because such imperialism relied as much on cultural
as on economic and military forces." (215).

If, for example, "A"-8 remains untranslated into Russian or Polish or
any other languages that have passed through vastly different
historical experiences than English (the thought about this more
concrete than not, having been shown Piotr Sommer's translations of
Reznikoff into Polish from 20 years ago, in addition to a two-volume
collection of essays in Polish on 20th Century American literature
that hasn't entered the bookstores yet, here, and which includes
chapters on Black Mountain, the Objectivists and the San Francisco
Renaissance), does the work in its native English gather an immunity
or at least the appearance of innocence which tends not to be
conferred to the world poetries translated into English? Whose world
is being translated?

Would a Russian version of "A"-8 sound like an affirmation of State
Terrorism? So what was once conceived by its author as writing in
opposition might be heard in a near reversal of intentions closely
aligned to the contemporary imperial moment and enter a future that
could hardly have been imagined for it, though the question is only
speculative, occasioned by the thought that the translation, among all
the other work that it does, allows "for a certain residual
indeterminacy, a sort of liminal region of narrative in which the
contact between different cultures and their relative powers are
foregrounded."

Web site picks year's top word

Friday, December 26, 2003 Posted:  10:07 AM EST (1507 GMT)

LOS ANGELES, California (Reuters) -- A U.S. Web site specializing in
language named what it called the top word, phrase and name of the year
on Thursday, picking them all from the war in Iraq.

"Embedded," as in the reporters assigned to accompany military units
during the war, beat out "blog" and "SARS" as the top word of 2003, Web
site yourDictionary.com said.

"Embedded was the best word to distill the events of an extraordinary
year into eight simple letters," Paul JJ Payack, president of
YourDictionary.com, said.

Previous top words include 2000's "chad" (from the hanging squares of
paper on Florida presidential ballots), 2001's "Ground Zero" (the site
where the World Trade Center collapsed) and 2002's "misunderestimate"
(a presidential slip of the tongue that became frequent comedy fodder).

"Shock-and-awe," the phrase the U.S. military used to describe the type
of campaign it would wage in Iraq, topped other Iraq-related terms like
"rush to war," "weapons of mass destruction" and "spider-hole" as the
top phrase of 2003.

The name most on people's lips during the year was Saddam Hussein, the
former Iraqi leader recently captured in a hole in the ground.

He beat out "Ahh-nold" (as in newly-elected California Gov. Arnold
Schwarzenegger) and "W." (as in U.S. President George W. Bush).

The site's lists, created by taking nominations from users around the
world and then having them judged by "professional wordsmiths," take
some liberties with Bush.

One of 2003's leading words is "Bushisms," to describe the president's
oft-satirized verbal style. The site published a list of the
president's top-five mispronunciations, including "new-cue-ler" (for
nuclear) and "Anzar" (for Spanish Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar).

As for 2004, Payack said there was already an early contender. "'Mad
cow' was on the list a few years ago, because of what was happening in
the U.K. 'Mad cow' could be big next year."

FOR GUILLAUME APOLLINAIRE
fins of an ancient world, a burger
beneath the Eiffel tower a troupe of matadors
assess the lives of antique grocers
Romaine lettuce peering out from automobiles
religion is resting still nude upon the grass
Europe of the soul, Christianity smells
of modern equations, Pope with your robes
reticent observer walking these streets
confessor of eggs and wallpaper
the prospect of these catalogs in the rain
25 cents for the adventures of a policeman
divers beneath the shadows, your portrait Guillaume
lends joy an obsolete moon, clarion of sun
director of beautiful dinosaurs, flesh trumpets
resound beneath the mural on the wall
JAMES INDUSTRY TONIGHT BULLFIGHT LONELINESS
streets of Paris resound in your mighty charms
violins of June, an encore of strange beautiful infants
white habits dancing in the glass
fame is an ancient friend among the pews, stained glass
pompadour of love and you there with your hours
blue casements of forgotten collage
amethyst profundity pronounces torch-lit red vents
gas creeping silently along the skin
eternity is honored among six branches
seven if you count resuscitation
Christ was merely an aviator to the birds
landing on a record playing venerable hymns
oceans of Africa, fountains of mercurial blood
forgive us of our sins this immaculate night of panthers
dripping instants, a siren awakes and calls your name
Paris dances, a foul maintenance man
roulette wheels spinning monasteries and short piers
dropping off into nothing but blackness
sad music of presidents regard the women beautiful
you are an orange or else the moon
a house, a table, the lips of a rose
you resemble a song, familiar as yourself
brilliant son of lost waters.=20

In keeping with my persistent belief that experimental writing can be
healthy I am starting a monthly column for August Highland's MAG
http://www.muse-apprentice-guild.com which I'm calling Write for the Health

(or mental health or illness if you must I'm looking to feature one person's
work every month.

Why not, "Debedded"  as irrefutably the best way "to distill the events of
an extraordinary year into 8 simple letters."
As far I can see, anyway, the "embedded" USA reporters with the military
operatives of Rumsfeld-Wolfolitz-Cheney-Bush & etc. have done little to
"distill" "facts on the ground" - in fact, mostly to the contrary.
It is those reports - particularly from other Iraq based blogs, internal and
foreign media that have provided the debedded and "off angle" news that I
have found most refreshing.
"Embedded" - quite differently - is synonymous with the quiescent consent to
authoritarian control in exchange for the illusion of security - something
that has apparently not about to arrive yet in Baghdad.

"Debedding into the New Year" - O well, barely after last night's meal (a
boxing day splurge of everybody's mostly left over deserts). I guess those
are called the "Sweets of Saturnalia."

what a great idea. i mean, the democrats are so much further to the left
that it will make such a difference when they get in. there really is a

Your sarcasm is incredible. Tell it to every ecosystem threatened with
death because of Bush's attempted repeal of Clinton's executive orders.
Tell it to every country suffering from or threatened by the doctrine of
pre-emption and all the widows and orphans that that one's made. Tell it to
our ertwhile allies as they tool up faster than planned to become serious
competitors. Tell it to everyone whose rights are casually violated in the
name of homeland security. Tell it to the recipients of public services who
will have less to receive because of the tax cuts (and that includes school
children of all ages and their would-be teachers who find themselves
graduating from PhD or MFA programs with no jobs in sight).

I think most of us would like to see more than the democrats are likely to
do--I for one would like socialized medicine for a start. But only children
play all or nothing. I'd suggest while you're growing up you read a few
newspapers.

was clinton really that much better? i mean, what was income-tax like
when he was there? and public healthcare? unemployment benefit?
regulation of corporations? funding of public education?

or foreign policy? desert fox, for example - clinton was in the
whitehouse then, right? is there any reason to suggest that he wouldn't
have invaded iraq even sooner than bush did?

or the environment? remind me again, how much do people in the US pay
for a litre of petrol? how much CO2 was produced by the US while clinton
was in power? what happened these levels, even after clinton had
subsribed to the Kyoto protocol? and what about the talks in teh Hague
in 2000 - who was president then?

more to the point, you're implicitly saying that it's fine to reject the
one alternative that involves confronting these issues, and vote
democrat instead. even to the point of encouraging nader not to stand.

You don't have the choice of a green in the white house. The green party
has very sensibly been concentrating on local elections, even at the
schoolboard level, in order to build the infrastructure of a party that can
eventually compete nationally, and not just as a spoiler. The Greens have
no chance nationally until they do so.

Voting one's conscience is a luxury that one rarely has in our
non-parliamentary democracy--just as in the legislature itself the ballot
box involves compromise.

To argue that those who didn't commit some known evils are just as bad
because they probably would have if given the opportunity seems a bit of a
stretch.

Clinton had one of the best environmental records of any president. Not
perfect, but we'll have a lot more of southern Utah to walk around in. His
curtailing of mercury levels has been rescinded, the Tongass national
forest is about to become toothpicks, and Bush actually reinterpreted the
clean air act to allow massive pollution (that one's in court at the moment).

What you see as a sliver of difference between the parties can be fairly
massive. If (when, alas) Bush wins expect a Scalia-dominated Supreme Court.
Then take a look at all the recent 5-4 splits that went against Bush.

On the other hand, a vote for Nader would help enrich the abortion clinics
on our borders. Call it foreign aid.

This afternoon, took in David Ireland's very fine retrospective at the
Oakland Museum. Talk about stripping the world down to its literal concrete
material - only letting the orchestration of facts permit the investiture of
an outside presence, metaphor and/or thought. A kind of subtle radiance
implicit in all.  And a sweet way to impact the senses!
I came right home and stripped Shakespeare's Sonnet #1 - one way of many, I
suspect, to clean one's poetic house down to the cross beams and nails
(initial letter of each word).  A process similar in some sense parallel to
Grenier's "I hate speech" to "I hate text." I actually love them both. To
get back to what is central to both, the requirement of the carpenter's
plane, shaving each to the original grain. Provocation here is central.

... actually, Mark, it's quite freaking odd how [public] politics play
differently on the two sides of the Pond.

Here, with a (technical) three-party system ***, the idea of
"vote-Nader-and-let-Bush-in" flips -- here the (moral) quandry is to vote
tactically -- Shall-I-vote-for-the-Lib-Dems-to-keep-the-Conservatives-Out?

I really thought I was a Raving Lefty till I discovered that my ex-wife and
my son wouldn't indulge in tactical voting to save their lives, whereas I
would.

Talk about sticking to the union ...

... Wobbly style union, in case anyone's confused.

Hey, I'm a dumb Brit, so explain, how do Chomsky and Sokal, the general
soft-left American activists, fit into this equation?

Thanks for sending this along. I had no other way of finding out. I only met
Enid once and corresponded with her several times about her work appearing
in an anthology I was editing. She seemed to project a basic kindness. It's
very sad news. I feel very much for Donald, as well.

the ontological status of the image
the epistemological stake of representation
the potentiality of historical discourse
the discourse tends to slip away from the data
and the desiring subject becomes a fearful one
no discourse is ever able to say what it wishes to say
the very saying of what is to be said depends on another saying left
unsaid, the reciprocal interrogation of the inherited hierarchy
the play of projection and identification with imaginary others

"which theoretical-political avant garde do you want to enthrone in
order to isolate it from all the discontinuous forms of knowledge that
circulate around it?"

'the analysis of discursive practices must take into account the
dynamics of the social space that its object occupies'

'a designation of difference that remains viable only in condition of
its potentiality for the violation of its closure'

Where is Santiago Alvarez' "79 Springtimes of Ho Chi Minh"? (1969)

Where is Chris Marker's "Letter from Siberia"? (1958)

rightwing/leftwing appropriations of the image

--to expect to be able to proceed with those meanings would be to expect
to be able to refer to them, when it's the attention to the operation
of those meanings, the exposure of how they are constructed

--those meanings? whose meanings? 'our' meanings?

--trying to read instead of manipulating the sentence into the
discursive illusion that the reading knows what it has read

--the illusion of knowing is the dodge of discourse
(Olson, Human Universe, "the dodges of discourse")

Even so, in a work of scholarship like Rowe's can be remarked an
ideological positioning in advance, raising new icons and refurbishing
former ones to mobilize an anti-imperialist 'post-nationalism,' an
opposition that does not need any other tradition than Twain, Du Bois,
Douglass, Melville, etc. The threat of the translation of this
tradition that might be said to span a continuum across the U.S. civil
war and World War II (if it can be said that there is an end to this
continuum, modernity, the problem of assigning an end to which reading
Benjamin reminds one), involves confronting a history and culture of
Marxism that cannot be dispatched by such anti-imperialisms as Rowe's
conflation of Du Bois' mistake about Stalin with 20th century Marxisms
and their project of social revolution. How can these Marxisms refuse
to go away after the collapse of the command economies and their
regimes?

"the impending Americanization of what has been called, imprecisely,
our postcapitalist world" (Bercovitch, "The Rites of Assent")

"this commercial and technological penetration of every corner of the
globe, which at the same time works to render invisible the peoples so
dominated" (Rowe, "Literary Culture and U.S. Imperialism")

The note of pathos in the anti-imperialist tendency developing in
American Studies since the shock of the first Gulf War should not
deflect attention from the century-old problem of opposing wars of
aggression and the arming of nations without the fall from innocence
that the discourse of defense against this aggression represents, and
whatever else it is and does, the modernist project of social
revolution articulates 'the peoples so dominated' both within and
without the imperialist nations in a war of defense that has been
called class struggle and which no one wants to remember.

That would be use towards some other ends separate from the
materiality of the writing process immersed in conflict--something
other than itself--when it can't be, however much it wants to be,
self-referential--as though there were any verbal object that could
contain the representation--the imposition of ideologies are always
external to the writing and yet there is no writing which exists
outside of these imposed meanings, and these are cultural meanings,
and they begin to become part of the history of the writing as soon as
it enters a time that is not the time of the writing itself--process
conflicts with the very historicity which presupposes it--and the
conflict over the representation and the imagined future for the
representation which made it possible to write in the first place
commences.

Zukofsky alone among the poets of his generation had the courage to
commit to historical memory the affirmation of the modernist project
of social revolution as the only defense against imperialist war, and
whatever the errors involved (embedded in the Popular Front itself),
in his parallel montage (Eisenstein, "Strike," 1924) the act and event
of reading "foreign" materials tracked by the notational rhythm of
quotations produce an expanse of writing and reference that one might
almost claim for its English the condition of being illusory, and
would this claim be that extreme? If I am reading it I must be reading
it in English, but the world I am reading is unfamiliar, proletarian
and immigrant, multilingual, translated. "A"-8 commits the
transgression of introducing through the high art of the Poetic
modernity's international project of social revolution into the
history of American literature. Does this long poem exist only at the
other end of the continuum situating the U.S. civil war and World War
II in a telos of closure, a poem that belongs to a history that's
over, having been overcome by the pure passage of time and the promise
of 'postindustrial' globalization? There are boundaries around
language and history and culture that collapse there, and which recall
the crime of the workers movements in all countries to claim to speak
in a common language regardless of whatever language was being used
(Mandelstam's account of the Peasants' conference and his interview
with Ho Chi Minh). Does the 'foreigness' of "A"-8's scale of reference
locate another tradition in 'our' literature, one that according to
such ideologists of a post-Marxist America like John Carlos Rowe, may
not even belong there?

"There is political conflict. And forms clash as they are political
meanings, are in political conflict both as meaning and for the
meanings they 'contain.'" (Peter Gidal, "Materialist Film." London:
Routledge, 1989).

why is it so difficult for people to consider the conversation that maybe
the Democrats were responsible for NOT reaching the voters in 2000?

why is it so difficult to understand that they have the same responsibility
for the upcoming election in 2004?

for instance, do we vote for Howard Dean?  who CLAIMS in every speech
he makes that he cares so much for the elderly, yet says we need to raise
the retirement age to 68.  or his bright idea that we should send hundreds
of thousands of MORE troops to Iraq, instead of taking Kucinich's lead in
stating "US out, UN in!"  do we throw a vote to Dean SIMPLY because we
fear Bush?

and furthermore WHY are we wasting our time with such polls as to
whether Nader is worthy or not of our vote?

San Francisco's recent election for mayor is something to look at for the
test of Democrats and Greens working TOGETHER for a change.  granted,
Green Party candidate Matt Gonzalez did not get elected, but it was so close,
so inspiring, mainly due to the enormous number of Democrats walking the
bridge to fill the gap for a candidate who was closer to their ideals than the
Democratic candidate Gavin Newsom.

instead of talking about what we DON'T want in the Greens, how about we
start talking about what we DO want in a Democrat.  and look at who
that could be.

the truth is i'm registering Democrat, after having been registered Green,
because i want to vote in the primary for Kucinich.

Maybe because, even after an incredibly inept campaign, and even with the
loiss of a lot of votes to the Greens, Gore did win the popular vote, and
would have taken Florida too if there had been less hanky-panky?

A Green endorsement could go far to swaying the Democratic party leftwards.

Craig, I like Kucinich, too.  He's the best of the Democrats.  As I winnowed out
the others it was partially the plain common sense of Kucinich.  He reminds me of
the recently passed Senator Paul Simon.  Simon is the only presidential candidate
I ever campaigned for.  I liked the bow tie, it's true, and I suppose that most
people didn't.  I also liked that he was literate enough to write plain good sense
books about hunger, and sidewalks.  He was wiped out after one or two state
primaries and never really got going, but he had ideals, principles, and he was an
authentic character.  Howard Dean is too cynical for me I guess.  He reminds me of
a tough doctor who tells you the diagnosis and then you can't ask questions
because he has another patient to see.  I really hope he doesn't get the
nomination.  Sharpton is nuts, but he's tremendous fun -- it might be worth it to
vote for him just to have an INTERESTING election.  Kerry is turning out to be
lifeless, as is Edwards (they make such vague proposals I can't remember anything
they say).  Only Kucinich seems clear-minded and folksy with downhome common
sense.  Lieberman sounds just like Bush to me, and then there's the awfully weak
chin to consider.

I don't know how Kucinich would come off to foreigners.  We have a public
relations problem with Bush to say the least.  I think he has good basic
principles but zero sense of how to implement them, and a lack of patience.  I
didn't vote for Bush, and was mad that he got in on such a fluke, but since then
he didn't turn out to be quite as bad as I had actually feared.  He can give a
speech now and then, and he has some emotional presence.  Somehow this is the
major flaw within the leading Democrats.  I can't pick up on any emotional
presence in ANY of them.  It's as if they are cardboard figures, AGAIN.

Most of my green friends will not vote for a Democrat.  They won't vote in fact
for anything but a green.  Nader has genuine moral authority after forty years of
working without a high salary to actually improve American life.  I like to read
what he says, and he is intelligent.  But to vote for a small party?  I did that
for Barry Commoner in 1980, but it is in a sense as Mark and Ron is saying a
tossed vote.  Unless the Democrats can come up with a guy with an emotional spark
nothing is going to matter.  Bush is going to win because he has emotions, and can
convey them to the audience.  He cries, he laughs, and he has motion in the center
of his body.  When he walks he looks like a dancer.  He can turn his feet and sway
his hips.  This drives women wild.  The voters don't trust the Democrats I think
because they all appear to be lifeless with the exception of Sharpton, who does
have a body.

Bush may not have much upstairs but his logic is clear when he speaks.  Also, he
has a body and a heart.  Out of the current group of Democrats, I just register
nothing when I listen to them.  Even Kucinich just appears lifeless even when next
to Senator Paul Simon, who is actually dead.

Hi all:

I'm trying to collect info on the best organizations to donate to for the
relief effort going on in Iran. I want to avoid orgs with high overhead to
prevent cash going to middlemen (e.g. Unicef, RedCross).  I found
Relief International and MercyCorps through a blog, but don't know anything
about them, and would love additional suggestions. I read Bam had 80,000 and
the death toll is around 30,000 (!). I can't begin to imagine losing half of
the population of my city. If anyone knows something about relief efforts,
please share.

Thanks,
Sue

loyalty to a particular political party is such an extension of football,
baseball, whatever ball that's being tossed or kicked around.

the fact that there are Greens who cannot see the value of certain Democrats
is as idiotic as Democrats who cannot see the value of certain Greens.

if Nader had been the Democrat and Gore the Green, i STILL would have voted
for Nader in 2000.

we like emblems, symbols, elephants or asses.  slap a logo on the can and the
ideas inside are suddenly worth looking at a little closer.  but then there's
the guy selling the can opener to get inside, and maybe he's really the guy
we should be voting for in the first place?  i mean, maybe we should pass an
amendment that all CEOs of American corporations have to be voted into their
jobs by the nation?

my mother would do a great job screwing up Nike for instance, i'd vote for
her.

Hello unto you,

Presenting a double whammy from Sleepy Brain: a review of the mockumentary
Nothing So Strange, about the assassination of Bill Gates, and an interview
with GI Joe, from Toydeath, who use kids toys to create "music".

****************************************************
Sleepy Brain (Extra-Retinal)
NOTHING SO STRANGE: Kill Bill Gates, Volume 1
http://www.sleepybrain.net/strange.html
****************************************************
Nothing So Strange is a new mockumentary about the assassination of Bill
Gates. It1s also the first feature film to have its worldwide commercial
debut on the internet. Footage from Nothing So Strange has been released as
open source, and the film follows the efforts of the conspiracy/activist
collective Citizens For Truth, who attempt to disclose the LAPD1s cover up
of evidence associated with Gates1 assasination. Alek Hiddell, an
African-American who was shot by the police moments after the assassination,
is blamed for the killing, but evidence suggests he may be innocent. An
attack on the LAPD1s real history of corruption is woven into the story,
with footage of the Rodney King beating.

Rebecca Cannon enters this strange, alternate universe...

TOYDEATH: Annihilating Childhood Fantasies

****************************************************
Imagine a hyper band of aliens channeling through a broken AM radio, and
someone's playing with the speed control. But the Hendrix-worthy feedback
wails are actually the sirens of toy fire engines, the spastic beats
courtesy of model helicopters. Toydeath proves that punk ain't dead, it's
just moved into a toy box. Upon returning from their recent tour in Germany,
Holland and Belgium, Toydeath1s more recent alter egos include band member
Michael Lira1s trangressive adaptation of Donny Darko and the new,
transgendered Le-booby.

Mikelangelo gets behind the translucent mask of GI Joe, Toydeath1s core
circuit-bender.

>>DIA: stop a modern day lynching
===========================

Dear Kalamu,

       I don't know if you are aware, but Dwight York is a long time
hustler
and cultist and blight on black folks. Previously he has held himself
out as
the descendent of the Prophet Muhammad, as the Mahdi (promised guide or
Messiah) of Islam, as a modern-day Christian prophet, and now a Native
American
chief! He has left a long trail of broken and abused and disheartened
and sexually
exploited and financially impoverished Black folk. He has a great number
of
children by his followers in his various incarnations, many of whom
thoroughly
despise him. He appears to be a sociopath; certainly his long list of
mutually
exclusive identity claims proves him to be a pathological liar. At the
very
least he is an exploitive cultist.
       Brother Kalamu, I write this not to badmouth or to pass gossip
about
an innocent brother, and I certainly don't have any personal ax to grind
against York. I'm just sharing this because I know the man of integrity
that you are
wouldn't want to unwittingly support anyone who wreaks such havoc on our
folks.
       Peace and grace,
       Obery Hendricks, Ph.D.
-------------------------------


--------------------------------
bro. kalamu;

be careful with this group.  Maliki York aka Imam Isa aka Al Khadir and aka

several other names is a well known crook to the conscious community in NYC

where he was the founder and head of the Ansar Allah Community, in which he

mentally enslaved young black men and women to make himself rich.  Research

this matter further.  Talk with your Brooklyn, New York comrades before

forwarding anything else from this group.


peace


bro. kazi
-------------------------------
Kalamu,

Hi there.
I had fowarded the piece on the group who is trying to
keep their land in Georgia to some lists in Chicago.
This was one of the replies that came back.
I thought you should be aware of it.
Thanks.

Tobe

There are swing voters.  I don't think I have ever met one, though.  Everybody I
know makes up their mind according to the label.  In my whole life I've never met
a single swing voter.  Does anybody know these people?  They will apparently
determine the election, since the nation seems to be about 50-50 Democrat or
Republican.  Maybe these swing voters are people who need glasses or something
and just punch away at the voting cards, hitting willy nilly.  I can't believe
that anybody actually weighs the issues, and rethinks after about age 25.  I also
don't know anybody who has actually changed parties except possibly Norman
Podhoretz and David Horowitz, who I don't know personally.  The green party
people that I know are completely loyal to the green party.  But I only know four
or five of them -- they are all on the west coast, and all anarchists, four are
teachers at Portland Community College, and one is a mountain climbing guide
(college room-mate).  Even with thumb screws or 72 virgins you couldn't entice a
change.

Ron S., Mark Weiss, and others:

Have forwarded two letters (emails) to Nader, one through the Nader link you
supplied and another a week or so ago through moveon.org or Dean website ( I
forget which).

Was blunt, not particularly polite in my messages to Nader.  Been a Nader
adherent for many years and do NOT blame him for Bush getting elected, but
"strongly" discourage his consideration of running for president and
siphoning off votes for Dean, whom I support with both money and local Dean
campaign work.

My two cents: Ain't so keen on Green party right now.  "Idealism" does NOT
reduce to their ideals alone, and "practical political ends" (getting Bush
out of of power) cannot suffer selfish ideals of any spoiler parties or,
similarly, Bush-lite candidates like Lieberman and Gephardt, running because
their egos tell them that they need to add "President" to their lists of
career achievements at this time.  I.e., too many "life or death" issues at
stake to permit Green goals separating greater Progressive movement from
baseline priorities (namely, remove the sociopaths from office).  If we can
remove Bush, all the "higher" desires and needs can be attended to.  With
Bush Co. still in power, simple survival needs are at risk.

Blah blah blah, my two cents.

Five more years of this and there won't be enough of the democracy left to
put the Constitution back together again. It would take not a political
party but a Resistance Movement, an Underground. So that, as much as I like
Nader's ideas it would be too risky to support him. I'd rather he speak to
keep the Democratic candidate focused on the green side of the spectrum, and
I hope the candidate will be Howard Dean.

FBI urges police to watch for people carrying almanacs

Monday, December 29, 2003 Posted:   7:18 PM EST (0018 GMT)

WASHINGTON (AP) -- The FBI is warning police nationwide to be alert for
people carrying almanacs, cautioning that the popular reference books
covering everything from abbreviations to weather trends could be used
for terrorist planning.

In a bulletin sent Christmas Eve to about 18,000 police organizations,
the FBI said terrorists may use almanacs "to assist with target
selection and pre-operational planning."

It urged officers to watch during searches, traffic stops and other
investigations for anyone carrying almanacs, especially if the books
are annotated in suspicious ways.

"The practice of researching potential targets is consistent with known
methods of al-Qaida and other terrorist organizations that seek to
maximize the likelihood of operational success through careful
planning," the FBI wrote.

The Associated Press obtained a copy of the bulletin this week and
verified its authenticity.

"For local law enforcement, it's just to help give them one more piece
of information to raise their suspicions," said David Heyman, a
terrorism expert for the Washington-based Center for Strategic and
International Studies. "It helps make sure one more bad guy doesn't get
away from a traffic stop, maybe gives police a little bit more reason
to follow up on this."

The FBI noted that use of almanacs or maps may be innocent, "the
product of legitimate recreational or commercial activities." But it
warned that when combined with suspicious behavior -- such as apparent
surveillance -- a person with an almanac "may point to possible
terrorist planning."

The publisher for The Old Farmers Almanac said Monday terrorists would
probably find statistical reference books more useful than the
collections of Americana in his famous publication of weather
predictions and witticisms.

"While we doubt that our editorial content would be of particular
interest to people who would wish to do us harm, we will certainly
cooperate to the fullest with national authorities at any level they
deem appropriate," publisher John Pierce said.

The FBI said information typically found in almanacs that could be
useful for terrorists includes profiles of cities and states and
information about waterways, bridges, dams, reservoirs, tunnels,
buildings and landmarks. It said this information is often accompanied
by photographs and maps.

The FBI urged police to report such discoveries to the local U.S. Joint
Terrorism Task Force.

I should inform you of the sources of the numbers in my note to Kirby; =
they come from my personal computations of information gleaned from =
National Voter Registration data available from each of the 50 states =
and the voting districts of Puerto Rico and D.C.  You are free to do =
your own computations and dispute these numbers, of course, and I =
readily acknowledge the fact that some of the categorization results are =
from my personal interpretations of the listings some voters have chosen =
when they registered.  And on some, I guessed...not having a clear cut =
statement from the registrant.  =20

But, the veracity of the data notwithstanding, I thought you all might =
find the numbers  in my note to Kirby Olson interesting. =20

Kirby,
My understanding of the definition of a swing voter is this:
approximately 10% OF THE VOTER BASE IS RIGHT WING CONSERVATIVE
approximately 10% OF THE VOTER BASE IS LEFT WING RADICAL
approximately 15% OF THE VOTER BASE CLAIMS NO PARTY AFFILIATION.
approximately 25% OF THE VOTER BASE CLAIM TO BE REPUBLICANS
approximately 30% OF THE VOTER BASE CLAIM TO BE DEMOCRATS
the balance    10% of the VOTER  BASE are a mish-mash collection of =
folks

THE SWING VOTERS ARE THOSE IN AN ELECTION WHO CAN BE CONVINCED TO ALIGN =
WITH OR CAST THEIR VOTES IN FAVOR OF A CANDIDATE FROM ONE OF THE TWO =
MAJOR PARTIES.=20

THESE NUMBERS ARE ESTIMATES, BUT UNUSUALLY CLOSE TO REALITY...AS YOU CAN =
SEE BY DOING THE MATH, 35% of the base is Republican and 40% is =
"Democratic...the other 25% of the voters have the power to "Swing" the =
election one way or another. More importantly, they lack sufficient =
power to elect any candidate on their own. =20

But there's more to the issue than this media explanation.   In my view, =
if you know anyone who voted for Ralph Nader in the last election, you =
know a swing voter too, because those who did cast such votes, for the =
most part, were people more inclined to have voted Gore rather than Bush =
had they voted mainstream.   And that too did swing the outcome...IMHO.

yeah, some kith & kin. it is kind of unbelievable but they are pretty
unbelievable, so there's that.
some friends who voted for nader will now vote dem.& i've heard quite a few
people call into c-span the last few months announcing their switch to the
dems from repubs.
of course, xian fundamentalism is rampant after 9/11, with folks and dogs in
terror of End of Days, Eternal Damnation & such. i'd like to know the rate
of born-agains per day to gauge increase in repub voters.

2 cent:
some adept strategists in the repub. party  have anticipated a good number
of voters (&/or pollsters) to be gullible, i.e. dumb, divided, bewildered,
idealistic or jaded. so far they've not been far off. they've counted on it
& it's been worth the risk for them. they're still counting on it.  we'll
see unless not.

There are many written works available on palm --

you can purchase them (although I've received no information from Palm
after querying them several times about vending the poem in my book
DaDaDa I wrote specifically for delivery through palm, "Palm Anthology")

http://www.palmdigitalmedia.com/

Soft Skull has stuff for palm you can buy

There's also a sort of html "lite" which is palm markup.  I have some
palm markup switches in my poem.  They work better in the poem if you
know they're switches. /x

also, of course, there's all sorts of software on palm; I'm working on a
dictionary / translator poem and an address book poem, among other
things,
but my favorite software is freeware --

there is acrobat reader for Palm which is free; you have to download and
install it:

http://www.adobe.com/products/acrobat/acrrpalmdload.html

then you can read .pdfs on your palm (still not great for stuff which
wasn't reformatted for the tiny screen, tho) (and still the infernal
adobe ad),

including the poems at beehive, which, although I've never been able to
get anything there, has some reg. poems formatted for palm download --

though I know yr fiction, I'm a sicker fr "cabinet" plays, etc.:

MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="iso-8859-1"

Politics Once Again:
The question to ask is not, which democrat, or third party, or =
non-affiliate candidate can defeat president Bush, but rather, how can =
the middle/left-leaning majority of the nation regain control of the =
political mechanism in the nation? =20

And to answer that question, we need to analyze exactly how it is that =
the right-wing minority conservative element managed to wrestle control =
of the nation's political scene?

The right is in control for three reasons:
1. they have brilliantly structured a program that works within the =
mainstream major party system...they became Republicans. =20
2. they were patient and diligently, patiently chartered a course of =
action that led to small victories.  Collectively, those small victories =
led to the White House in 2000. =20
3. they relied heavily on the ability of the voice of the conservative =
element, Rush Limbaugh, to continue to persuade the aging population =
that the youngsters were running amuck..e.g. Clinton's getting blowjobs =
in the oval office...can anything be worse than that?  (note that all of =
that publicity which afflicted Clinton, never hurt the GOP sinners...how =
many girlfriends, wives, consorts, did Newt Gingrich have all the while =
he served in the House? And what did the left do to bring all that news =
to light? Newt is, after all, on his third wife, and he was schtooping =
his girlfriend/third wife while his second lady was in a care facility.  =
WOW,what's worse, adulty when your partner is ill, or blowjobs in the =
Oval Office?  Ok, maybe both are not good, but only one was used as a =
weapon.)=20

So, what can the left leaning learn from all this?=20
1. Stop running around like wounded animals being mistreated by the =
"system."  And that means stop all this juvenile demonstration crap from =
the 60's.  Demonstrating may be a way to get your name in the papers, =
but it won't sway voters who might otherwise agree with your =
politico-philosphical views.  And by the way, IMHO, Ralph Nader is doing =
just this, as are all Green Party folks.  {Note to Greens...become =
Dems!!! Tell Nader to grow up and learn to work within the two party =
system...if he can't do that, maybe he needs to accept the fact that he =
has failed.}
2. Martial a plan that works within the two party system, and work that =
plan.
3. Be patient!  It did take the conservatives better than 40 years to =
gain control...regaining control for the left leaning won't happen in 40 =
hours, or even 1 election.=20

And who really gives a shit whether it is Dean or Kerry of Kucinich (and =
sorry, but that last name just ain't gonna make it today in the =
"mainstream")?  That debate wastes energies and monies that would be =
better spent on answering the question: "How can we collect the fringe =
folks and form a unified political force that can oust the current, Big =
Business monsters masquerading as politicians?"   Here's the note: Free =
Market is nothing more than a new name for Freedom for the rich to =
plunder the poor...and wage earner is a two word substitute for "slave." =
 Or worse, why is it that 50% of the world's population continues to =
labor at an international poverty level at the same time that the =
directors of the world's leading big businesses continue to increase =
their wealth at an annual growth rate nearly twice that of the USA's =
annual CLI (cost of living index)? =20

I don't give a good god damn about trees or oil lands or global warming; =
I care about people.  And the big business monsters, while they molest =
the environment will do worse, they will continue to abuse people, all =
those people whose labors they rely upon to build their fortunes.

Pardon my ranting here, but...if you really want to keep the Alaskan =
North slopes from being further plundered, or if you really give a good =
god-damn about the plight of laborers in the nation, you have to =
stop...repeat: STOP!!! trying to build a third or fourth party unit and =
START working to gain control of one of the two major parties currently =
in control in the country. =20

If you doubt my message here, examine the success of the billionaire =
Ross Perot's efforts at starting his party...the big-eared ego idiot =
wasted tons of greenbacks getting nowhere.

So, if you are seriously interested in defeating Bush, I suggest you get =
your lazy asses off your ideological pillows and start working to elect =
Democrats; we may not elect one to the post of president this time, but =
we need to start somewhere.  And if that fringe eqo-freak Ralph Nader =
can't join us in the fight...let him go his own way...alone, he'll =
succeed in changing nothing; you on the other hand may actually save a =
small portion of your world.

bush is a plague

bush is a plague - the bushes are - they are all plagues - the father the mother - the son in the
white house - the son in texas - it's because they are white - why are they white? - white is
pretty - THEY are not pretty - how can a plague be pretty? - the president should not be called bush
either - why is he called a bush? - bushes are pretty - and they are good for you - bush is not good
for me - he is not a bush - if he was a bush he would be pissed on - do you see his dog pissing on
him? - i don't - and why did bush win the presidency? - is it because there are so many white
people? - i am not a white person - i am jewish - i DID vote for bush though - why does a jew vote
for bush? - a jew votes for bush because jews are smart and all jews knew he would win - every jew
knew - the jews are also the reason that the twin towers were attacked - it's every jew's fault -
including jews who are only half-jewish - who REALLY won the election was al gore of course - every
single jew knows this - i didn't vote for gore though because i was FOR gore - i was sure that if i
voted for gore bush would win - my plan failed - not because of me though - it's the supreme court's
fault - they are all white - there is not one jew or african american on the supreme court - there
is not one woman on the surpreme court - they wear make-up to look like they are not white and get
dressed up to look like non-white people - but they HAVE to be white because they stole the
election - how does that work? - the supreme court which is all white steals the election from the
american people who are white - it makes no sense - none at all - unless americans are jews - this
is why they practice christianity - only a jew would practice chritianity - is bush a jew? - his
DAUGHTERS are jewish - they converted - but not their father - still i will vote for bush again -
and he will get re-elected - why? - because white america is a plague and we get what we deserve - i
mean YOU get what YOU deserve - I am not white - even though i DID vote for bush i have been
bar-mitzvahed AND i have washed in a mikvah - still even though i have been bar-mitzvahed and have
washed in a mikvah i don't know shit about judaism - that's because i am a WHITE jew - a white jew
who wants bush's daughter - the hot one - the party animal - and she wants ME too - and it's not
because i am drop-dead gorgeous jew and not because i am well-hung jew - i am neither - i am 40
pounds overweight and i have a small pecker - but this is what turns her on - i was shocked too!! -
would the president want me for a son-in-law? - i wouldn't want HIM for a father-in-law - i don't
care if he has a lot of money - i have a lot of money too! - i am a jew! - everyone knows jews are
rich - it's obnoxious - hitler thought so - he thought we were a plague - if hitler thought we were
a plague then we are - whatever hitler says is true - whatever bush says is true - whatever bush's
daughter wants i give her - but i don't have a chance - it's because i am dead - the bushes don't
want their daughter to marry someone who is dead - how could i be dead? - answer the question
yourself - but baby bush has definitely got the hots for me - we have phone-sex - she fantasizes how
she wants a dead white jew with a schnauzer-sized dick to fuck her- but laura the queen bitch has
her on 24-hour watch - how do i know? - duh!! - i just got a call from the libyan embassy - it was
from laura - laura libyan bush told me to leave her girls alone - she said her child's marriage was
already arranged - it was arranged with her cousin - isn't that what white people do? - they
inbreed - that's how they become president - she also laughed at my stutter - when i asked for her
daughter's hand in marriage the words would not come out - she let out a shriek of laughter -
because
i'm dead - because i stutter - because i'm a jew - and because i'm white - laura's tone then changed
and she confessed that she was a double agent working for al quaida and that she was training her
daughters for the taliban - the WHITE taliban - then i heard the receiver slam down with a bang -
that's when i threw my cell through the window - when my neighbor (who is white and paranoid) heard
the window shatter she called the police - the officers arrived immediately and marched in through
the open door of my apartment in santa monica california which is all jewish - i am writing this
down right now in the back seat of their cruiser - no i am not handcuffed - why would i be? - i
asked Joe and Daryl to give me a lift - YES i know both the cops - my wife is one - she is at the
station - she is black - and an evangelist - and she has nipple hairs - which she does not pluck -
it doesn't bother me - why would it bother me - nothing bothers me - nothing at all - in fact i love
her nipple hairs - AND her anal hair - bush's daughter has a thick growth sprouting in her
ass-crack - but i can't have her - it doesn't matter - whether i get to fuck his daughter or not
bush will get re-elected - unless the messiah comes - then this is who i would vote for - until then
i am waiting for the next suicide airstrike - i hope i am reaming my wife's ass when it happens -
it's bound to happen - and when it does happen i want to be enjoying life to the fullest

Dear Poetics List,

In the spring I will be curating an exhibit of poetry chapbooks at Poets House in New York. If you are a chapbook publisher, or know someone who is, I encourage you to send copies of chapbooks as well as a short paragraph (either some sort of mission statement or anecdote describing how the press got started, why it got started, etc.).The text will be included in the exhibit. The exhibit was of course inspired by Steve Clay and A Secret Location on the Lower East Side, and is intended to be a loose follow up, featuring books that have been published since 1980. It will also include some historic publications from the Poets House archives (early Adventures stuff, Tibor, Burning Deck, etc.). The exhibit will open in April and there will be a reception, reading etc. so please consider sending your books in soon. They can be mailed to Poets House (attn Ryan Murphy) 72 Spring St. New York, NY 10012.

Please feel free to back channel for more information.

with Best wishes for the New Year,

Ryan Murphy

Willie Nelson, who has endorsed Dennis Kucinich for President, and who will=20

What Ever Happened To Peace On Earth



There's so many things going on in the world
Babies dying
Mothers crying
How much oil is one human life worth
And what ever happened to peace on earth



We believe everything that they tell us
They're gonna' kill us
So we gotta' kill them first
But I remember a commandment
Thou shall not kill
How much is that soldier's life worth
And whatever happened to peace on earth



(Bridge)
And the bewildered herd is still believing
Everything we've been told from our birth
Hell they won't lie to me
Not on my own damn TV
But how much is a liars word worth
And whatever happened to peace on earth



So I guess it's just
Do unto others before they do  it to you
Let's just kill em' all and let God sort em' out
Is this what God wants us to do



(Repeat Bridge)
And the bewildered herd is still believing
Everything we've been told from our birth
Hell they won't lie to me
Not on my own damn TV
But how much is a liars word worth
And whatever happened to peace on earth



Now you probably won't hear this on your radio
Probably not on your local TV
But if there's a time, and if you're ever so inclined
You can always hear it from me
How much is one picker's word worth
And whatever happened to peace on earth



But don't confuse caring for weakness
You can't put that label on me
The truth is my weapon of mass protection
And I believe  truth  sets  you free



(Bridge)
And the bewildered herd is still believing
Everything we've been told from our birth
Hell they won't lie to me
Not on my own damn TV
But how much is a liars word worth
And whatever happened to peace on earth

Dear sidereality Readers,

I hope that everyone is having a wonderful December!

As you all know, a new issue of sidereality is scheduled to be released
in January. I expect to publish this issue -- featuring the poetry of
Anyssa Kim -- on January 15th, as I'm currently in the time-consuming
process of redesigning some of the webpages.

In the mean time, please do make an effort to revisit the
October-December issue <http://www.sidereality.com> , as the work
contained therein is excellent and deserving of more attention. During
the month October, we received over 100,000 hits for this issue! In
addition, two reviews were added to this issue's contents in early
November: Vernon Frazer's review
<http://www.sidereality.com/volume2issue4/reviewsv2n4/reviewofl@xl.htm>
of Ric Carfagna's e-book L@XL, and Takuya Murata's review
<http://www.sidereality.com/volume2issue4/reviewsv2n4/reviewofmesmeranda
.htm>  of Chris Sawyer's chapbook Mesmeranda.

In late November, six poems -- pulled from the previous four issues of
sidereality -- were nominated for 2003 Pushcart Prizes: "What
<http://www.sidereality.com/volume2issue1/poemsv2n1/whatwatches.htm>

Jonathan Minton, "Rain

<http://www.sidereality.com/volume2issue3/poemsv2n3/theafterdeathhistory
ofmymother.htm> After-Death History of My Mother" by Sandy McIntosh,
"Vertigo

to Eros" by Kristy Odelius, "Death
<http://www.sidereality.com/volume2issue3/poemsv2n3/deathofagirlineverkn
ewinpassing.htm> of a Girl I Never Knew in Passing" by Sirrus Poe.
Although there were several other sidereality poems that I would liked
to have nominated, the Pushcart only takes six pieces per calendar year
from each publication, unfortunately.

Finally, if you've recently submitted work to sidereality, please bear
in mind that response times will be slow until December 29th.

Best wishes,

Clayton

MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="iso-8859-1"

Friends,

It has been a busy and strange little autumn for me, hosting 11 poets in
what has turned out to be a carnival side-show of a reading series
(http://belz.net/readings), with pinball ding-dongs and kids screaming
within earshot.  Beatnik Bob's Theater is a dimly lit venue, with full
ashtrays atop dirty café tables and miscellaneous people drifting in and
out. The stage is rickety, the microphone is from the 50's, and the PA
system is basically a stereo with a soundboard sitting on top of it.  This
series has a bit of a garage-band atmosphere, and I don't entirely mind
that.

A lovely write-up graces the newest issue of St. Louis Magazine --
http://www.belz.net/readings/stlmag.html

The original challenge was to give oral literature some street currency, let
it stand for itself in a non-sanctuarial environment (non-coffee shop,
non-bookstore, non-library, non-academic), in a tough Saturday night time
slot, at a cost of $5.  The question was: Is poetry able to compete, or
does it need the props it has come to expect? And the answer so far has
been: oh gosh, it's hard to tell. Let's keep pressing forward and see what
develops.

Although I have been discouraged with technical difficulties (esp at
Hess/Gudding ), noisiness of the venue (esp at Seely/Robinson/Greenberg),
and smallish crowds, I have been equally encouraged by responses I have
received from individuals --- one person emailed me:

"The best part about the reading was the way the poets used the surrounding
sounds of the City Museum to create readings that were very musical.  The
City Museum is a place of steady beat. While I closed my eyes and listened,
I could always feel a steady pulse, delivered in music playing in some part
of the building, or the clashes and clangs of kids playing in MonstroCity. I
assumed the poets would become quickly annoyed with the background sounds
and try to speak over them. However, both poets used the 'music' around them
to emphasize their works.  The first poet almost sounded like a rap artist
free-styling to random city beats."

And Jonathan Mayhew blogged thus:

"Kari Edwards at the City Museum in STL on Saturday, reading with local
talent Jarek Steele, the latter accompanied by numerous friends and
well-wishers, even a younger sister. I bought a copy of Kari's Iduma, with a
wonderfully busy graphic design and some trenchant and memorable poems--one,
a near faithful copy of a Dept. of Justice document, was frightening and
hilarious at the same time. I enjoyed meeting her, since she is both funny
and warm. (I haven't been to a reading this good since ... the last reading
I went to at the City Museum a few months ago.)

"J. Steele, who works at Left Bank Books, read an effective autobiographical
prose piece about growing up male in an ostensibly female body. I didn't get
a complete sense of him as a poet, since he didn't read very many poems, but
his reading worked well thematically with Kari's more indeterminate gender
bending.

"Aaron Belz, organizer of the series, read a poem by Arielle Greenberg, who
is coming next month. There were fewer technical glitches this time--only a
door propped against a door-frame that came down a few times for some
welcome comic relief. There were no injuries."


My feeling is, if Readings @ City Museum actually does something different,
casts literature in an alternative light, or makes a real connection with a
handful of people, it's doing something important. Something that, pardon
me, the stiff, obligatory, wine-and-cheese MFA reading doesn't generally
accomplish. There is no power brokerage at the City Museum; only a mad,
Willy-Wonkaesque atmosphere. There are no laurelled literati or cloying
introductions or coteries of loyal followers clutching books to be signed.
Rather, there is a slate of working poets, a bevy of whomever the cat
happened to drag in on that particular night, me at the back trying not to
go crazy -- and all of us swept into the Cabin Inn afterwards.

We are looking forward to the January 10 reading, featuring Dale Smith and
Kent Johnson.  Kent is pissed about a recent article in "Believer," and
rightly so. Dale will fly in from Texas, ready with his own unique sense of
language and place.

In upcoming months we are pleased to also present --

      March 6 - Tsipi Keller & Jane Delynn
      April 3 - Mary Jo Bang & Susan Schultz
      May 1 - Kristy Odelius, William Allegrezza,
               Garin Cycholl, & Chris Glomski


In closing, a petition: if you are wondering whether or not to come support
Readings @ City Museum, please just come on down.  It has been a friendly
party thus far.

And if you're wondering whether to spam your entire address book to let them
know about the series-- go right ahead and do that.  Although I am serenely
confident in the readers we have lined up and increasingly confident in the
venue (future readings may be held in St. George's Chamber, a beautiful
oblong room full of art deco prints), I am less confident in my own ability
to appease the gods of publicity.  I don't know what they want or how to get
their attention.


                                Viva la revolución,

Dear folks,

Many of you have recently asked about the spring schedule for the Frequency
Series at Shortwave. I regret to announce that the final Frequency reading
was held on December 14 and that we do not plan to continue the series into
the spring. We have had a lovely time--Daniel and Richard and myself, and
all of the readers, regulars, and guests--but we've outgrown our space and
our various schedules are more complicated these days. The press continues
to grow (yay!) and the new staffers and interns use the bookstore floor as
much-needed office space, which makes regular events difficult.

We've got a few Shortwave non-Frequency events on the current calendar, but
these too will taper off. BUT, we WILL continue to entertain you from the
stage of the Bowery Poetry Club (http://www.bowerypoetry.com).

Apologies if I have not replied personally to your request or inquiry
regarding the series! As always, you'll find our full schedule of nationwide
and NYC events at http://www.softskull.com (click EVENTS).

Thanks again to all of you who came out to read or listen of have a pint.
It's been swell.

Best,
Shanna

Alexander, I think another thing that Republicans have decided on is the strategy of not being too burningly sarcastic toward the people who are working with them.  I think this kind of righteous sarcasm has permeated the left and has alienated many people.  I for one am too shy and timid to answer this sort of thing in person, but basically don't wish to work with overly zealous activists without a sense of humor much any longer.  It seems to me that the Republicans are more polite and forgiving within their fragile coalition. I always think of Shakespeare when I think of politics --
Henry IV and Vth are unified by the end, while Hotspur's faction has fallen into a fratricidal bewilderment of mixed communication and one-upmanship as well as ad hominem attacks and so on.  There are many independent groups within the democratic left -- black activists, feminist activists, ecological activists, and so on, and they often distrust one another.  The Republicans have lower numbers according to your chart, but I sense they are more unified.  Remember Henry Vth in France.  They destroyed the French because they were unified even though outnumbered ten to one.  There are
numerous examples of this -- the Finnish fought Stalin's tank divisions to a draw even though they were outnumbered 50 to 1.  This is because they were unified and actually loved one another as brothers.  The Finnish leader was Gustav Mannerheim, and he wrote, "The strength of a small country lies in its unity."  We speak so much about diversity, but I don't think there is any longer anything that unifies that diversity.  We are now no longer even Americans, but hyphenated thises and thats.  I sense that many democratic factions see other aspects of the group as at best a hindrance, and
at worst something to destroy when the revolution's over.  The Republicans may therefore have an advantage in that sense: they still see themselves as Americans.  Your idea of unification within the one functioning existing party is a good one, though I doubt if it will happen.  There's too much ill will, and the style has moved more and more to a merciless shrill bear-baiting, it seems.  Even the presidential candidates of the democratic party have fallen into this rhetorical style.  It reminds me of Hotspur and Glendower, or the French in H5.  I could be wrong, it's just my perception.
When I remember how the green party people that I've met speak of democrats, or anybody who thinks about anything in even a slightly different way from how they do, I think the possibility of a coalition is fleeting.  The rhetorical style to recapture is Paul Simon's: simple, inclusive, non-threatening, humble, and focused on specific concrete results.  Your style seems to still be in that manner, Alex.

The day-in-the-life of the city sympathies
the equivalent of a default value

you make a mistake when you stake that
analogy as orientation to exploded facing
frames: Esther Shub (Strike, 1925)
        Bill Brand (Coalfields, 1984)

what has already happened
when the airstrikes happen
and you think you see them:
did you catch that clip of the Movie Camera Without A Man

"In the recounting,
we hear what someone says about an event
that has long since happened while we see
'authentic' archived images of the event itself.
Does this strategy not confer
greater truth-value on the spoken word than it deserves?

"Is the spoken word not a re-enactment
in its own right, an interpretation aided by hindsight
and motivated by an implicit point of view
shaped over time? Testimony and commentary
give priority less to what happened than to what we now know?

The camera can give you "the feeling of being there."
The apparatus detached from the invisible body
and the matter of authenticity is finally resolved.

The authenticating location heightens credibility.
Empty your clip until ordered otherwise. The gap
between the moment and its capture is up for grabs.

How can it be organized within a single controlling frame.
Conventions of all kinds for one kind of imaginary,
the motivated subjectivity of the authoring of affect.

The reality-effect,
those accused and those accusing others
without addressing the peculiarity of the camera
on its own, put on display in the distance we inhabit

That captivating glimpse of sustained
Chance, being in the right place at the right time
and the state of mind it induces (anything can happen)
the rhythm of physical motion without the mind

Believe you me,
the enunciator, the one that "voices"
what you will see and hear was really there
the uncut footage freed the image from its moorings
as definitive as surveillance records
and that includes not a single spoken word

into the rhetoric that sustains its force
as the legitimate referential weight"

The DWP rips out the insides of paperback books and
puts an author's stuff in there. Supposedly, authors
are encouraged to do the same thing on their own and
they can list the DWP as their publisher. A pretty
wild group.

Also, POG in Tucson once put out a chapbook made out
of the author's denim blue jeans. I still have that
book.

=B3Continuing Revelation,=B2 Installation and Meeting in Washington, D.C.
(Gothics News Service, December 29, 2003)

The Sidwell Friends School =AD which is normally closed during the Christmas
vacation =AD is the Meeting site for what many participants now consider a
powerful installation and public gathering to honor and grieve for the dead
and living victims of the on-going war in Iraq. Entitled =B3Continuing
Revelation,=B2 the private Quaker School has invited neighbors, residents and
visitors to Washington to a unique, candlelight vigil that takes place each
night in the campus=B9 basketball gymnasium.

There is no admission charge. People may either bring a candle of their
choice, or pick up a free one with a Installation Meeting brochure at the
entrance ticket office. As one enters the darkened gym, a person dressed in
a luminous white gown lights the candle before each person proceeds in a
slow moving line around the edges of the full basketball court. On a typica=
l
evening, several hundred people hold up their candles, quietly walk, pause
and gaze while the combined candle flames illuminate and cast long shadows
on to a haunting series of tall, multiple-column stacks of black and white
plastic bags - some of them towering close to the building=B9s steel rafter
beams =AD each of the combined stacks hovering over multi-colored piles of
gunnysacks that fill the entire gym floor.

Looking closely, one can see four black, diagonally placed and relatively
small columns of over 500 black bags rise from the =B3tip-off=B2 circle at the
court=B9s center. A Friends brochure - printed for the installation -
indicates that these stacks =AD as of December 29 - represent the number of
American and Coalition troops killed in either hostile or so-called
=B3non-combat=B2 situations, as well as over 50 suicides. Surrounding the four
stacks, are a series of quite tall columns of white plastic bags, radiating
out from the center, each of them cumulatively met to represent the 9000
plus wounded in combat, the injured and those made too sick to continue,
including the over 500 psychiatric casualties.

Rising from the floor spaces between the columns =AD and covering the entire
length and width of the court. In stunning contrast to white and black
columns, the strokes of the candle lights illuminate interwoven, tall piles
of misshapen gunnysacks covered and sewn with diverse kinds and colors of
Iraqi cloth to represent diversity and ages of the estimated more than
10,000 civilians and soldiers who have died of gunshots, artillery fire,
mines and bombs during the last seven months. The cloth patches vary from
green uniforms, black bandanas, dark business suits, bright blue, yellow,
red and white from dresses and children=B9s clothes, and oil covered worker=B9s
trousers. The crumpled character of the gunnysacks make it look as though
the majority of the now dead were caught off-guard, accidents of chance
rather than direct combat. The brochure apologizes for not having space to
represent the yet to be fully estimated, but certainly much larger number o=
f
Iraqi wounded and the psychologically scarred still living within the
country, as well as the lack of adequate space to represent United Nations
and other expatriate civilian deaths.

After proceeding in absolute silence around the edges of the court, many
people rise to fill the surrounding bleachers to continue to observe what i=
s
clearly a memorial occasion and a space of great sadness for the gathered.
Indeed one hears an occasional muted sob and the frequent patting of the
eyes with tissues. Other than the brochure=B9s various estimated figures on
all the dead and wounded =AD no one at the School gym is available for public
comment and Sidwell=B9s administrative offices are closed for the Holidays.
The person handing out the candles and brochures quietly points to the
installation=B9s title, =B3Continuing Revelation=B2, which is also, incidentally,
a mainstay of Quaker Meeting practice. Those leaving the campus preferred
not to talk about their experience, apparently too moved or shaken to want
to further publicly reveal their thoughts on this seemingly unique occasion
within the Nation.=20

Man trapped under mountain of books, papers

Tuesday, December 30, 2003 Posted: 9:10 AM EST (1410 GMT)

NEW YORK (AP) -- A man who says he sells books and magazines on the
street was rescued after being trapped for two days under a mountain of
reading material in his apartment.

Patrice Moore, 43, had apparently been standing up when the books,
catalogs, mail and newspapers swamped him on Saturday. Firefighters and
neighbors rescued Moore on Monday afternoon and he was hospitalized in
stable condition Tuesday morning with leg injuries.

"I didn't think I was gonna get out," Moore told the New York Post,
adding that he called for help repeatedly.

His landlord discovered him Monday after coming to the apartment to
give Moore a small loan and heard a strange voice inside. The landlord
pried the door open with a crowbar, found Moore trapped and alerted the
fire department.

The apartment was stuffed from wall to wall and floor to ceiling with
stacks of paper.

Emergency workers and neighbors dug through the debris to reach Moore,
filling 50 garbage bags with paper. He was freed about a half hour
later, said Fire Department spokesman Paul Iannizzotto.

Moore, a former mailroom clerk now receiving public assistance, said he
collected books and magazines for more than 10 years and earned money
by selling them on the street.

The incident recalled the legendary case of the Collyer brothers, who
in 1947 were discovered dead in their house in Harlem after one of them
became trapped under a pile of papers and the other died of starvation.

                                 Y-E-S!
                   We're bringing in another New Year
                  despite the state of the right wing.
                        We're still cognizant of
                        the Beauty of Ourselves
                 that comes to us as Human Difference.
                      However you choose to count,
                     depending on what you've read:

                         It's now the Year 6004
            given the estimated moment when the one we call
               Menes had reunited Upper and Lower Egypt.

                          & in the same breath
                    Jan. 22 will begin the Year 4702
              at least, according to the Chinese calendar.

                     & yes, it's also the Year 5764
                 estimatedly from the time of Abraham.

                       & it's even the Year 2003
                       (give or take four years)
     the generally accepted estimated year since the birth of Jesus

                         & it is the Year 1424
     given as the Hijjra; the moment of Mohammed's flight to Medina

                                finally
                          This January 1, 2004
                       Also marks the 200th Year
                      Since the Haitian Revolution

                ...However you wish to read any of this:
                         HAVE A HAPPY NEW YEAR!

Everything is already perfect: I walked home from work
last night in the cold, skimming stoned and worried
over you across the flimsiest crystalline flesh of a
sky, leaving behind dodging stars the wet trail of my
tongue so I wouldn't lose myself, dying with each step
closer to home.

On the way I inhale, and night air shapes my lungs to
fit.

The body is social, signed with misgiving. Coat it
with cool tar and winter tourniquet and still it
moves, the only thing visible to cars flowing through
Cooper Foster. In my head I tie flowers together of
acrylic-crinkled chassis, hand each spinning bud to
you. You, however, prefer quicker food: light, heat,
Guinness, laughter. You're always lying back to watch
everything careen on Cooper Foster; but you're still
in love with something you can't see.

I think of you perfect, like these stars. I am a
performance.

hi all,

it's year-end time, and thought i'd try and start another one of those what you
liked this past year threads. so, my blog of the year:

Katie Degentesh's Bloggedy Blog Blog
http://katied.blogspot.com/

for me it isn't even close. i know katie, broke bread and drunk with her in
poetry packs a few times over the past three years since she's moved to new
york city, but i don't really know her at all. but this blog shows me her
journalistic eye for detail and smart-aleckedy-ness i've seen at times, all in
a nice here's a story i wanna share with you feel. And, and here's the key, she
barely writes in it so you never get bored of her. She posted something three
days ago, but before that it had been more than a month since her last post. I
check it daily, have my cursor in the close window box, and click away when i
see the same old entry appear, a bit disappointed. But, on a day like today,
when a new to me entry appeared, it's a quite wonderful day.


happy new year all.

as ever,
david

Hey Folks--I'm afraid I'm not all that up on my Kristeva these days.  Can
anyone tell me where she talks about the problem of a "destroyed"

========================================

CALL FOR SUBMISSIONS

GIBRALTAR POINT INTERNATIONAL ARTIST RESIDENCY PROGRAM

JUNE 2004 TERM: JUNE 1 - 30, 2004


DEADLINE FOR APPLICATIONS: MARCH 4, 2004 by 4:00 P.M.


The Gibraltar Point Residency Program provides professional artists with
a

subsidized opportunity to live and work on Toronto Island (Toronto,
Canada)

for one month. The program is open to Canadian and International artists


who are engaged in the research or creation of work. It is designed to

provide participants with time to think, create and experiment in the

diverse community at The Gibraltar Point Centre for the Arts.
Participants

receive accommodation, a private work studio and all meals at no cost.


Artists are responsible for their own travel, materials and all personal


expenses. International artists are responsible for making all
visa-related

arrangements and must provide proof of their own medical insurance
coverage

for the period of their stay at Gibraltar Point no later than May 1st,
2004.


Gibraltar Point Centre for the Arts is a unique facility operated by

Artscape. The 30,000 square foot building provides permanent studio
space

to more than a dozen artists and a Retreat Centre which can be rented
for a

variety of functions. The Centre also features Artscape Lodge - a

short-term rental service with accommodation and work studios for up to
13

visiting artists.


Situated on the south-western beachfront of the Island, The Gibraltar
Point

Centre for the Arts owes its name to its location marked by Toronto's

oldest landmark - the Gibraltar Point Lighthouse, which was erected in

1808. The Toronto Island is a 230 hectare regional park in Toronto's

harbour. The Island is part of the Carolinian Zone which includes flora
and

fauna not found anywhere else in Canada. Naturalized areas and wildlife

reserves make it a popular stopover point for southern song birds. The

Island is also home to approximately 800 individuals whose remarkable

community boasts one of the highest per capita populations of artists in


Canada. For more information on Toronto Island please visit the Toronto

Island Community website at http://www.torontoisland.org.


FACILITIES AND EQUIPMENT

Gibraltar Point Centre has a variety of private work studios ranging in

size from 250 square feet to 800 square feet.  Several of the studios
are

ideally suited to writers; the composers' studio features a Baby Grand

Piano; others are equipped with large, adjustable drafting tables and

spacious work/wall surfaces for visual artists. All studios have
excellent

natural light. The program will assist artists with their equipment and

applicants are asked to include a detailed list of their needs.

Photographers are expected to process their work off site, at their own

expense. None of the studios are soundproof and as a result only
projects

that are quiet in nature are suitable at this time.


ACCOMMODATION

On site accommodation consists of bright, cozy, residency style private

bedrooms, shared bathrooms and showers.  Residents have access to a
laundry

room, common lounge, a fully equipped kitchen, a shared computer with

internet access and an amazing beach.



TRANSPORTATION

A ten-minute voyage on a vintage ferry boat is an integral part of the

Gibraltar Point experience. The Mainland Ferry terminal, located at Bay

Street and Queen's Quay West, is a ten-minute walk from Union Station.

Public transit to the Terminal includes the Bay #6 bus and the
Harbourfront

L.R.T. Bicycles can be taken on the ferry. Ferry boats run on seasonal

schedules to docks at Hanlan's Point, Centre and Ward's Islands. In cold


weather, the Ongiara ferry offers cozy heated cabins. Ferry fares are $6


return for adults. Once on the Islands, you can walk, cycle, rollerblade
or

take the Gibraltar Point shuttle bus which offers limited service beyond


your initial move in and your move out. Artists in residence are given

bikes for the duration of their stay.

I went yesterday to see the Lord of the Rings and was frankly bored, even
when I was 12 I found LoR a real bore. But as I sat through the last part of
the trilogy I began to become a little disturbed by the movie. Here are some
reflections of mine would ask for other comments;

1) All the "good characters" are not just white, they are Nordic, it is like
Reich Films cast the show. The elves, the men, even the dwarfs are nordic
and white.
2) All the "bad characters" are dark, even the Elephant army men are black
or dark.
3) The culture that is revered is one that is modelled on Nordic religion
and myths which is fine except that the whole phenomonology asserts that
this tradition is a good one.
4) Patriarchial Kingship is viewed as the ideal.

Now I realize that this is a movie but it says allot about things that not
one of the main characters in this movie is black, or even southern
European. Some friends have argued that Tolkien was British and was writing
a Myth from the Celtic-Germanic tradition. But I see the problem more with
the film-- I am not saying that we ought to be politically correct or have
racial quotas within a film but I find the whole package a little
disturbing. Especially the last big scene where the whole multitude looks
like extras from Valhalla.

This is why the left fails in the USA even when the dems are in control

1) In 1964 America was moving towards a  Social Democratic consensus.
2) Conservatives realized that the only way that they could survive this
consensus  was to create a shadow establishment because in 1964 most
institutions, colleges, think tanks and groups were left leaning and the
left was growing.
3) Conservatives also realized that two communities that in 1964 were 'left
leaning' Urban Catholics and Southern Whites did not like the disorder of
the later 60's and also that they were economically liberal but socially
conservative.
4) Conservatives built from this a shadow establishment that created ideas-
and mailing lists to make money for their movement. They also created wedge
issues.
5) Liberals/Social Democrats on the other hand abandoned organizing as a
mass movement later in the 60's as Civil Rights Movement spawned Black
Power,and the other splinter groups and the left broke into the many
"pressure groups" that the left is made of today, Feminists, Gays,
Environmentalists splintering a whole progressive agenda.
6) The Democrats rather than building a Social Democratic consensus as was
formed in Europe where the welfare state had benefits for ALL of society,
build a series of programs to "LIFT UP" certain groups hence resentment was
created within the taxpayers that the Right exploited. If the Dems had built
a structure like in Europe that the Middle Class bought into there would be
no conservative movement today. But the left chose to splinter and chase
small gains rather than the big idea as was won in Europe.
7) The right however remained intact and with simple organization and its
shadow establishment was able to weather Watergate while the left could not
recover from McGovern and the loss of Carter in 1980.

The key for the left in the USA is move away from "special interest"
politics rather than being a list of "groups seeking justice" the Left ought
to try to create a consensus for a certain social compact.

Imagine if someone here in the USA could articulate a Social Democratic
vision-- cogently--- that said look you are going to pay more taxes but
university will be free, health care will be universal, and we are not going
to let our cities fall apart, you will have mass transit et cetera.

If a left politician could articulate this-- versus the right's harping on
'autonomy''freedom'and 'free markets' the left can win but if the left
remains the 'special interest' party the right can use that as a way to
separate people and win every election. But instead we spend our resources
on corporate welfare, and wasteful social spending that does not address
real issues. Until the left has a cogent vision and an articulate spokes
person for these values they will not win.

Haas, this is a brilliant summary.  I liked it.  I think you are right.  What
are you going to do with all the separatists within the democratic party?  You
have lesbian separatists, black muslim separatists (mutually exclusive, in many
cases) and separatists of all kinds. In Finland for instance they don't have
many of these problems.  98.7 percent of people living in Finland are Finnish.
Others come for a while but they don't stay.  The winters are harsh, the
language is very difficult to master, and you tend to get beat up.   So it's
easier to attain unity.  This country is such a welter -- even with the
remainder of states' rights -- you have a feeling of a coalition of 50 countries
all of whom have border issues, and possessiveness problems.  To create a unity
like you envision would require a great leader -- perhaps someone like Lincoln
could do it.  We need a new Lincoln: someone who can articulate principles and
then create brilliant rhetoric to set them in motion.  I don't see that but I do
believe in miracles.  Perhaps a spirit will rise in one of these leaden
candidates. -- Kirby

Move left; move right. No good Murrican gives a shit

{    This is why the left fails in the USA even when the dems are in control
{
{    1) In 1964 America was moving towards a  Social Democratic consensus.
{    2) Conservatives realized that the only way that they could survive this
{    consensus  was to create a shadow establishment because in 1964 most
{    institutions, colleges, think tanks and groups were left leaning and the
{    left was growing.
{    3) Conservatives also realized that two communities that in 1964 were 'left
{    leaning' Urban Catholics and Southern Whites did not like the disorder of
{    the later 60's and also that they were economically liberal but socially
{    conservative.
{    4) Conservatives built from this a shadow establishment that created ideas-
{    and mailing lists to make money for their movement. They also created wedge
{    issues.
{    5) Liberals/Social Democrats on the other hand abandoned organizing as a
{    mass movement later in the 60's as Civil Rights Movement spawned Black
{    Power,and the other splinter groups and the left broke into the many
{    "pressure groups" that the left is made of today, Feminists, Gays,
{    Environmentalists splintering a whole progressive agenda.
{    6) The Democrats rather than building a Social Democratic consensus as was
{    formed in Europe where the welfare state had benefits for ALL of society,
{    build a series of programs to "LIFT UP" certain groups hence resentment was
{    created within the taxpayers that the Right exploited. If the Dems had built
{    a structure like in Europe that the Middle Class bought into there would be
{    no conservative movement today. But the left chose to splinter and chase
{    small gains rather than the big idea as was won in Europe.
{    7) The right however remained intact and with simple organization and its
{    shadow establishment was able to weather Watergate while the left could not
{    recover from McGovern and the loss of Carter in 1980.
{
{    The key for the left in the USA is move away from "special interest"
{    politics rather than being a list of "groups seeking justice" the Left ought
{    to try to create a consensus for a certain social compact.
{
{    Imagine if someone here in the USA could articulate a Social Democratic
{    vision-- cogently--- that said look you are going to pay more taxes but
{    university will be free, health care will be universal, and we are not going
{    to let our cities fall apart, you will have mass transit et cetera.
{
{    If a left politician could articulate this-- versus the right's harping on
{    'autonomy''freedom'and 'free markets' the left can win but if the left
{    remains the 'special interest' party the right can use that as a way to
{    separate people and win every election. But instead we spend our resources
{    on corporate welfare, and wasteful social spending that does not address
{    real issues. Until the left has a cogent vision and an articulate spokes
{    person for these values they will not win.

Hass,

Saw LoR a few days ago myself.

Same sort of take (although I did like the movie, as I do most, for their
"escape" value -- opportunity to almost completely get away from realtime
daytime reality, etc.).  But Yes, like you, had a similar take.  Especially
at the end, two prominent points stood out: (1)For the most part, all the
heroes (and main characters) are male, from the hobbits to the humans to the
elf and the troll (or whatever he is); at the end, they're all living, and
they're all celebrated. (2)The solution to the "problem" is military
victory; regardless the global issues and strife, everything comes to "war,"
and Good cannot overcome Evil by any means except WAR and victory or defeat.

Naturally, this IS, after all, a movie based on Tolkien's narrative, and
"his" epic is an epic of "war."  I guess it remains for others with newer
imaginations to frame human strife and global threats in non-war terms and
narratives.  I'd love to have seen LoR characters jumping straight out of
their scripts and electing to "fight" the whole narrative of war, but that
script hasn't been written yet(?).

Similarly, <The Last Samarai> foregrounds male characters and tries, in my
opinion boldly and honorably, to make the analogy between "war profiteering"
by Winchester/Remington salesman of the late 1800's and war profiteering by
you-name-'em of this era -- the crooked military expert from the U.S. and
the crooked advisor for the emperor of Japan are just like Perle and
Wolfowitz et al, and I think this latter film DOES courageously try to make
the public see these kinds of scoundrels and their treachery to "life,"
human and other.  Still, the movie makes "competition," in it's worst
extension (war), "exciting" and "fun" and "glamourous," really, and the lead
characters are all male, really; further, it's Tom Cruise, the American, who
survives at the end, not the Japanese samarai, Kasumoto.

Someday, some sharp and forward-seeing screenwriter is going to write an
epic "untrue" to the male history of the last 10,000 years.  It will depict
something like the "cooperation-based" civilizations of 20 thousand years
ago; foreground female main characters; and develop a plot whereby they
circumvent the entire development of the male hierarchy and male-dominance
and "wars" at the critical split that occurred some 10-15 thousand years ago
and forced the species down the "competition"/war road/narrative (Eisler,
<The Chalice and the Blase>).  Or it will be a plot that takes the American
Civil War, say, and shows "female-brained" leaders nipping that struggle and
military contest in the bud, deconstructing the framing of human
disagreement so that war is no longer an option or "step" in the conflict
resolution.

Catherine Daly, like many others, surely, rejects in her <DaDaDa> the term
"avant-garde" for its militaristic roots and associations.  Speaking of
Catherine Daly (and David Bromige), can Catherine or David if out there say
if the reading up in Sonoma County for the 23rd is still a go?  I need to
make arrangements if I will be able to attend.

Happy New Year to all!

Steve Tills
