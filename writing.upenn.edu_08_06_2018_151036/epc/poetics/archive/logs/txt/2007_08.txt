I was going to lurk this one out.  But then Antonioni had to fly off--on the
same day as Bergman!  Wow: speechless.

Love to hear that conversation.  Whatever the topic at St. Peter's Gates,
I'm sure there'd be plenty of long, pregnant silences . . .  just looking at
the clouds.

Picking only five directors from a century of cinema feels absurd.  But I
admit I was tempted to write in Antonioni.  If I could only pick one
Italian, I'd pick Antonioni.  (A hard choice: Pasolini, Fellini, Visconti
and others superb too.)  Pasolini was one of the greatest neorealists (Mama
Roma, Accatone) but got too literary for film as he went on.  That said,
he's probably in my top ten list of poets.  Don't get me wrong: it's all
great stuff.  But if I had to choose between Pasolini's best films and
Antonioni's . . .

I feel I owe my eyes to L'Avventura.  It's probably the number one film, if
I had to choose.  (Sight and Sound puts L'Avventura second, behind Citizen
Kane.  Have to think about that one.)  I remember first feeling the pleasure
of the medium, the edges of the frame, the texture of celluoid, with
L'Avventura.  No one makes angst look so good (with the help of Vitti,
Mastroianni, Scheider, Nicholson and others).  And no director had a more
architectural sense for film, than Antonioni.

This, and the religious experience, was confirmed with the restored release
of The Passenger, last year.  You have to see it on the big screen.  In the
otherwise excellent NY Times obit (for once, an obit written like an obit
should be--I guess Lyman had a few years to work it), the final shot of that
film is mischaracterized as "meandering": in fact, the camera describes an
omega.

I'll go out on a limb and say that Zabriskie Point may be one of the best
films made about California, probably just behind Chinatown.

Let's not forget the great Michel Serrault, also flown yesterday.  "C'est la
fin de la reflexion," says Isabelle.

MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII; format=flowed

_NOTES AND DIALOG ON CODE_ (7/31/07) (Sandy Baldwin and Alan Sondheim)


NOTES ON CODE (Alan Sondheim)

Major modality:
Relationship between modeling and codework:
mapping within the subtext/substructure of the metric.
Visual modeling: Visual as thetic  - modality of happenstance (i.e.
modeling becomes dependent on the physiology of visual bandwidth).
Aural modeling: Visual with similar field, different spatial modality.

How is the thetic (is that the correct word?) in relation to ideality?
Does political economy depend on visual/aural physiology?

Scanning as doubled text: coded software / parameterization of the real
tending towards results which are residue (separate the results from the
structure). But within the phenomenology of the real, the results and
structure are inextricably tangled.

Motion capture (mocap) - see scanning. In scanning, the static object is
standard; in motion capture, the dynamic object. Think perhaps of the
latter in terms of a second-order differential - doubled modeling of
changes (1. through mocap; 2. through 'accelerated modeling').

The results: the 'code carapace' or chiten - Barrier/revelation code.
(Older work: The relation of consciousness to structured systems: what are
the manifestations of those systems?) Code as armor.

Seeing and hearing seem 'tawdry,' unable to sustain the abstracted or
philosophical weight placed upon them. To see or hear text philosophically
churns on transparency; everything else stumbles. We turn to writing
because it gets away from us to the extent that it's also reflective of
deep abstraction, alien-code (all code is alien).

All code is alien because it calls from elsewhere - or rather, doesn't
call at all; it's as if someone created it, it's as if it wasn't created,
not a bit of it. Which is the fundamental phenomenological status of code:
some of it is created, but some of it isn't.


DIALOG

Sandy Baldwin:

Thanks for these notes - always helpful. It would be interesting to
present them somehow with the video. I'm trying to think about your
question about the relation of the thetic to ideality. Now, the former
references taking a position (thesis) and signification (cf Kristeva); the
latter references Husserlian phenomenology and the constitutions of
objects. Are the second set of distinctions (political economy - visual /
aural physiology) parallel to the first two? Anyway, I wonder if you would
venture an answer to the question?

Alan Sondheim:

I'm not sure I understand all the modalities or connotations of the
thetic; online we have (among other things): 2.  Presented dogmatically;
arbitrarily prescribed. and derived: Greek thetikos, from thetos, placed,
from tithenai, to put; see dh- in Indo-European roots

So I was thinking of the thetic as arbitrary proffering, gesturing; if
code might be construed from ideality, the thetic might be construed from
code.

The visual/aural/sensory modalities seem clearly arbitrary in the larger
scheme of things, if such exists; the electrical senses of fish obviously
map the world completely differently (not to mention magnetism in birds,
bees sensing of solar polarization etc.). So this is the thetic, the shown
and it's in relation to political economy, which is dependent on culture
and organism. The ideality - and this for me is where a kind of
neo-platonism comes into play - is a structure which underlies everything
- a structure which _might_ map through propositional logic or Wolfram's
cellular automata or etc.

The structure is alien to the extent that a rock is in-itself, ding an
such. It's possibly here that the uncanny of codework appears (and coding
in general, mathematics/mathesis in general) - that code, no matter how
written, always seems, in part, to come from somewhere else, to appear, to
have appearance, whatever the sensory modality.

Sandy:

Thanks for the elaboration of the thetic. Some thoughts: As to the
visual/aural modalities (you mention fish, for example), I wonder if
inter-species animal display such as "stotting" (sp?) or "organs to be
seen" and the like, apply here. Here the code of display, in the large
sense of code from Eco or elsewhere, implies a semiotics that can't simply
be understood in terms of a return to the individual or even the species,
that gestures towards a general not-political economy. I'm thinking that
we, insofar as we are just such animals in the world, are on display for
the other (substitutable in the sense Levinas talks of).

Alan:

Had to look up stotting! The sp. is right. But I'm not sure that it
doesn't imply a 'return to the individual' insofar as the communication is
a signal? This isn't the 'mutual orienting of cognitive domains' - it's
masquerade or camouflage in a sense? But the display has to be readable by
the other, in both cases, stotting or display for the other, and the
modalities are always limited; in fact, with stotting, the limitation is
absolutely necessary - for a signal to be a signal.

Sandy:

I take this substitutability I refer to above as the alien you refer to *
the alien that I am. The thetic (as arbitary positing and also as a
"thing" in the scopic field) is always ideological. I think this is where
I'm coming to your point about ideality, and when you mentioned
neo-platonic I thought of Barthes' on the photograph as a kind of
"emission" (in the sense of
Plotinus).

Alan:

Yes, I think we're in agreement here perhaps. The alien is the source
structuration of code; the propositional calculus can't be consumed...

Sandy:

Agreed. Obviously, I'm thinking, on the one hand, of Bataille or Lingis
and their insistence and foregrounding of economies of excess and
non-return; but then, thought is made to account for and come back to
itself. Now, this dialectical reason is inseparable from philosophy, yet
we know there are other philosophies and unreasonable ways of thinking. I
could see this as life within and against the human.

Alan:

Interesting... I agree with you but then there's the 'selfish gene' issue
- if the stotting is common and in various species, then it's not leaky at
all but highly efficient; certainly it would be evolutionarily (?)
determined more than other signals, since it's at the fulcrum of life and
death...

Sandy:

Here's a different but not unrelated question - returning to the alien as
"source structuration of code." I wonder about the following: it seems to
me the subject relation to the symbolic online, let's say to the ideality
of ascii, is like that of the subject of film. There's is something like
suture occuring, and so on; at the same time, there's a difference and
even a complete reversal. I think this has to do with time, but I'm not
sure? Any thoughts here - again, if it's too much, there's no need.

Alan:

I'm lucky to be online. A HUGE storm is coming, lightning etc. out here.
Anyway - the subject online is an actant of course; the suture is similar
but different in that the filmic subject is predetermined - and therein
lies it's power - I think it relates to a fundamental masochism. The
viewer is held in thrall by the film, and/or the actions of the viewer
change nothing about the film itself - which continues to unravel at its
own pace - but only about the diegesis, which is always in dialog. The
subject in relation to the online symbolic, I assume you're referencing
jectivity (projecting, introjecting) is in a sense too much in control, as
if that control were offered to us elsewhere, outside online being as
well. In that sense, time is 'supple' for the online subject - in film,
it's not linear, but shuttled, and that dialog is set into motion by the
obdurate quality of the film, which just unravels. Of course this obdurate
quality relates, I think, to the inert of the real as well. Then when one
brings dream, dream-screen, all these other aspects into it, the whole
situation becomes muddled? Perhaps hopelessly so?

Sandy:

Thanks, yes. I think in the suppleness of the online subject: ASCII gives
me life, I give ASCII life, but I also ask more of ASCII than it can give,
and it gives more than I can ASCII. (In the otherness of it.) Also,
interesting that there's no "apparatus theory" of the net, beyond your
internet text of course (which does explain all).

of foreign language poets of the past who have fallen under the radar of
American readers. We are especially excited to show translation as the
vibrant, necessary interaction that it is. A biannual publication,
Circumference prints all poems in the original language side-by-side with
their English translations.

allow a combined dynamism to move their faction closer to a place of

can lead to an ideological metropolis within the macrocosm of corporate
publishing, and FP hopes to foster some of that in our unruly sort of way.

hi poetics friends....for those who emailed and wanted
to know more about the poetry foundation's big public
party (a variety of free books, journals, zines,
stickers, music, booze, people, fun) being busted by
the chicago police, i've posted the sun times article
below.

basically, it's another case of the time resistant
daley machine showing people its muscles.  a strange
result: the poetry foundation got hassled, yet gained
a tiny bit of d.i.y. poet credibility.

onwards,

Poetry slam: Police raid Bridgeport 'Printer's Ball'
PUBLIC SAFETY
Cops in combat gear make 1,000 leave party

July 25, 2007
BY FRAN SPIELMAN
City Hall Reporter

Nobody turned into a pumpkin at Chicago's third annual
"Printer's Ball," culminating a monthlong festival
celebrating the printed word.  They didn't get a
chance. The party Friday night ended up being shut
down by the police long before midnight in a dispute
over whether the Bridgeport gallery hosting it had
been inspected, had the proper city licenses and could
safely accommodate a large gathering.

Oskar Friedl, director of the Zhou B Art Center, 1029
W. 35th St., said "at least 30" police officers came
to his gallery "in full-fledged combat gear" shortly
after 10:30 p.m. and made more than 1,000 people
leave.

"It felt like the Gestapo," Friedl said. "I'm not even
blaming the city for what they're doing, but the way
they did it was very upsetting.

"If you want to be known as a sophisticated city, you
have to work on a sophisticated level. And it's not
just a few sculptures in Millennium Park that make a
city sophisticated. It's what happens on the community
level."

Rosa Escareno, a spokeswoman for the city's Department
of Business Affairs and Licnesing, said City Hall was
responding to an anonymous complaint about events
being held every third Friday with large crowds lined
up outside.

Police and city inspectors found hundreds of people on
second and third floors, which Escareno said are "not
licensed for any type of activity." There were live
music and disc jockeys on the upper floors, where
liquor was being served, and candles were lit
throughout the building near "very flammable,"
oil-based paintings, Escareno said.

"There was a lot of activity -- all of which requires
licenses and inspections, but the two floors above
were unlicensed and uninspected," she said."

She said several citations were issued.

"There was only one entrance and exit and no signs
indicating where the exits were," she said. "Stairs
leading up and down were less than three feet [wide],
only allowing people to go up or come down. It was
extremely unsafe."

Anne Halsey, spokeswoman for the Poetry Foundation,
the organizer of the Printer's Ball, said the police
were "extremely pleasant and courteous."

yeap, ridiculous -- strange that you 'muricans seem to swoon
exclusively over eurappian directors -- if I think back on my
eurappian youth, & the movies that counted then (for me & my buddies,
but also for a number of those european directors mentioned as among
the 5 best) I would have to put 1/2 dozen american directors in there
immediately: Ford, Wells, Hawks, Walsh, Hitchkock (the Us version),
Peckingpaw to begin with & then all the great US comedy directors
such as Wilder and all those whose names don't jump off my tongue
right now...  good lord! I want at least fifty movie makers in there
from Eisenstein & Abel Gance to Woody Allen & Stan Brakhage & beyond!

I expect that neither Fidel nor his allies are ideal critters.
But Cuba and Venezuela are certainly spearheading the current leftward
turn of
South America. I don't know, for example, how much the typical USA
newspaper
or television news will cover what is happening in Uruguay or Ecuador,
but Chavez is certainly one of the hopeful signs that Latin American
countries can start to
escape control by US military and industry.

I agree about L'Avventura. But I don't understand these lists and ratings;
they remind me of Sartre's hit parade. Films open different and complex
worlds and picking directors cuts through that complexity, reduces it to a
list which has nothing to do with them, their meanings to us, the way we
live through them, the diegesis of our lives. I'm surprised that listing
was a close to initial reaction. Antonioni had a great affect on my own
video- and filmmaking, just as, in another world, Derrida or Lyotard had.
But I think of sitting in theaters, walking out with amazing gifts I never
expected, or reading texts that illuminated everything for me, that arced
from horizon to horizon, that opened portals to thought and then quietly
allowed the portals themselves to vanish - thinking of these, of them, of
so many other deaths, our own among them, as if we are also in the very
way of passing. - Alan

Thank you for including the wonderful Thai director of Syndromes & A Century. (Is that the correct name of his recent movie?  I think so. I saw it not long ago at the IFC movie house in NYC. )  It will be interesting indeed to see where his films go from here.  Thanks, Tom Savage

I was also there and it is popular to slam Mayor Daley but the rules of safety are the rules.

The venue had two tiny staircases for hundreds of people this was dangerous.

There were kids all over the place and alcohol was being served the venue was not appropriate for the type of gathering.

When I am not being a poet I work as an Events Director and I would not have hosted this many people in a space without getting the right permits.  The space is great but not for 1000 people most of whom were drinking.

If there had been a fire these people would have died.  That has nothing to do with "gestapo tactics" it has to do with event planning and insurance and safety.

A person who had a great influence on esp Godard as well as Truffaut and wo=
rked a number of times with Samuel Beckett is Buster Keaton, one of the mos=
t extraordinary of film makers, and one with a strange and life and career,=
 moving from comedy to tragedy to--Beckett!  Since almost all his films' "k=
nown copies" were destroyed in a fire, for some time his work was "invisibl=
e" except to memories of those who had seen them and via old stills.  It wa=
s discovered, however,  that his ouevre had been lovingly preserved by none=
 other than the Stalin regime.  Stalin, the enemy of capitalism loved Ameri=
can films--and every film that came into Soviet Union to play for him as we=
ll as ones allowed to be shown publicly, was carefully made copies of.  And=
 so it was that a lot of the "lost Classic American Cinema" survived in the=
 world of the Gulags.         (Another great fan and preserver of many Amer=
ican films was Hitler, who, for those noting George W. Bush's cheeseburger =
pizza "you are what you eat" diet, it should be reminded that Hitler was a =
vegetarian and drank cocoa rather than coffee.)         Three directors who=
 had a huge effect in the Third World of the immediate post colonial period=
 are Ousmane Sembene, Sergio Leone and Pontecorvo (Battle of Algiers).  Leo=
ne was a Marxist and his "Dollars Trilogy" (A Fistful of Dollars, For a Few=
 Dollars More, The Good, the Bad and the Ugly) had a huge impact stylistica=
lly and in terms of the portrayal of a popular "revolutionary hero".  Clint=
 East wood became a huge international star actually before he was anything=
 more than a tv actor in the USA--especially in Third World counries.  (You=
 can see the huge impact of the Spaghetti Western hero/anti-hero in the Jam=
aican film The Harder they Come, in which Jimmy Cliff identifies with these=
 characters and their actions.  There was also a Jamaican DJ Toaster (rappe=
r) named Clint Eastwood.)             Pontecorvo's Battle of Algiers had an=
 immense effect through out the world--and on the rise of independent Cinem=
a in  areas combating colonialism, imperialism, suppressions of ethnic iden=
tities.  Cinema Novo in Brazil, for example and the new cinema in Quebec us=
ing a lot of documentary as in the work of Jean-Louis Breault (i have to ch=
eck the name spelling  on him been a long time) and West and North Africa. =
           A French director with origins in American film noir much strong=
er than the other French New Wave (he even changed spelling of his last nam=
e to be "more American") is Jean-Pierre Melville, a very great director not=
 well enough known in the USA.              A lot of the most interesting a=
nd films I have seen in recent years have come from South Korea, in visual =
terms and use of sound/silence as well as some of the most interesting form=
s of "narrative" and "subject matter".  Some of the best independent cinema=
 in the world right now is being made in Thailand, Malayasia and by Palesti=
nians. These are films which are as unusual formally as in terms of "conten=
t".            These are just feature films --if one went into the document=
ary, animation, video, "art films" underground cinema, experimental cinema.=
 cult cinema classics, or even one genre alone--Film Noir say, or Neo-Reali=
sm, the "Women's Film", the Juvenile Delinquent Genre, the Women in Prison =
genre, the Sci-Fi etc etc--of any one or of all countries--War Films, films=
 of Resistance, classics of montage, revolutionaries n the fields of sound =
or lighting, special effects, of improvisation, of control (Bresson for exa=
mple), of Propaganda, of the musicals, Westerns (and Easterns), Samurai, Bo=
llywood, etc etc etc--any one area would keep one busy for a long time.    =
          The archeology of the cinema--its Anarkeyology--is never ending a=
nd added to continually from the arrival of the new and the discovery and r=
ediscovery of the past. And the latter becomes part of the production of th=
e new--which in turn becomes a recent past influencing the very next new--i=
n yet another form of "New Wave"--you used to have to travel to the Cinemat=
heque in Paris to learn things which now you can find at the tap of the key=
board--which greatly helps in the proliferation of awarenesses and availabi=
lities of film languages, techniques, examples--(of course you don't get to=
 meet all the people who hang at the Cinematheque--)             And now it=
 is August--the anniversary of the "Atomic Age"--a cinema that has spawned =
everything from Godzilla to the latest propaganda productions of the Minist=
ry of Fear (title also of an American WW2 film directed by Fritz Lang which=
 Brecht worked on) in the War on Terror and Nuclear Threats, Weapons of Mas=
s Destruction . . .             Thank you to Anny for noting Pasolini and A=
my for naming Kieslowski. TCM last month had a tribute to Ida Lupino, a fav=
orite of mine--a very rare figure in cinema history as in the forties she b=
ecame a star actress and in the Fifties a director, producer and screen wri=
ter also.  She made some very good films noir--The Hitch hiker and The Biga=
mist for example. Agnes Varda and Catherine Breillat named before are two d=
irectors whose work I think about a lot.

Yes, and that list could begin with King Vidor and perhaps continue along

For the very little that this thread is worth, it seemed to be
post-Renoir, i.e., post-Citizen Kane and much of the best Ford,
Sturges, Hawks, etc.

The most interesting US directors of the past say 20 years, in my
book, are Jonathan Demme and Alan Rudolph, both of whose careers have
suffered bigtime from the demands of Hollywood. I've never understood
the appeal of Woody Allen.

Anne, THANKS!  I just forwarded the link to your Buffalo List response to
the others.  If you get a chance to read Dodie Bellamy's essay on Kathy
Acker, DO SO!  It's incredible!  In fact I should see if there's now a
recording of her reading it from PENNSOUND.  She blew our minds in
Philadlephia reading that essay.  And she had one of Kathy Acker's dresses
hanging next to her during the reading, a black, sheer dress.  A bit
haunting, but incredibly beautiful to have both Bellamy and the dress in the
room together like that.
Thanks again, and yes, please spread the word, these women INSPIRE!
IN FACT I WANT EILEEN MYLES TO RUN FOR PRESIDENT AGAIN DAMMIT!

Haven't seen any mention of Guy Maddin yet. Only time is keeping him
from the eventual "top x directors" list.

I recently saw an early Bergman film ("Port of Call") and was amazed
at how cemented his vision was so early on.

Bergam was basically August Strindberg mixed with some Kierkegaard. Has anyone read his novels? I haven't, but he turned to writing novels after he retired from filmmaking and directing plays. Noone has mentioned any contemporary filmmakers. Paul Anderson, a young American, has religious symbols in his movies. Martin S ain't so bad either. In d.c., we're not getting much outside the States unless one can make it to the National Gallery. I'm fond of Wim Wenders...

As long as Murdoch doesn't buy the New York Times, he remains a moloch who has little influence on my life, although the extent of his power is scary because he owns myspace or youtube or another one of those newly popular, populist places for everyone to post and see and be seen by other posters.  Anyway, no one lives forever or holds power forever.  That goes for Lord Rupert I and for George Bush II, thank the heaven in which I do not believe, anyway.

Are there also journals for the 50s, 70s and 80s, or are they not
academic disciplines yet?

If you suspect that I think this is more than a little silly, you're
right. On the other hand, it's a good field for truly lazy academics,
and one wouldn't want them underemployed. Hell, they might even get
into drugs, sex and rock and roll.

I’ve generally found Bergman just a touch over-wrought though I endlessly admire “Persona” and the oddly insistent “Smiles of a Summer Night.”  (And, for that matter, “Shame.”)

I saw Antonioni’s “Blow-Up” when it first came out, when I was in high school—the Catholic Motion Picture Office/ Legion of Decency ratings were posted once a week in the school library and “Blow-Up” was “Condemned” which made it a must-see.  The film of course gave me a great deal more than I expected—certainly it was one of the big events of my adolescence—and I’m glad this week that I was able to see Antonioni himself when he was a visiting artist, a “Professor at Large,” at Cornell in the 1980s.  The main public event of his visit was a screening of the three-hour, almost unbearably bleak, version of “The Passenger.”  He stepped up to the microphone, softly thanked the audience for coming, and simply had the projectionist start the movie.

And since Steve Russell mentioned “Pennies From Heaven,” I’ll note that it was written by Dennis Potter, who died a few years ago.  Potter, who was British, had decided at some point that he would work exclusively in television and he used his decision to good effect.  “Pennies From Heaven” was made originally as a mini-series for the BBC in 1978 and starred Bob Hoskins—I found it when it was re-broadcast on PBS in 1980 or so.  It’s still probably the best thing I’ve ever seen that was done for TV.  Potter also wrote the very fine “Singing Detective,” also a BBC mini-series—both it and “Pennies From Heaven” are findable these days and quite worth watching.

I believe Maria flew to Cape Cod earlier today, that's what she told
us yesterday...  This is absolutely gut-wrenching to watch--

I'm in the Twin Cities.  Was on campus at the University (less than a mile
from the bridge, maybe half a mile) rehearsing a show when we got the news
and saw the thing with my own eyes within about the first 15 minutes after
it happened.  Traumatized but otherwise ok from here.

Thanks for the check in.  I too would like to hear from everyone.

What you say about Steve Martin was true.  He made a great movie called The Man With Two Brains quite a few years ago.  The movies he's made lately seem mostly aimed at the low IQ set so I haven't seen them.  In thirty years of movie making, Woody Allen has made only one bad movie.  Regards, Tom Savage

I was still at work in Eagan (about 15 m south of the 35W bridge site)
-- heard about it on the radio. I drive over two bridges twice daily to
get to and from work (spanning the Mississippi and the Minnesota
Rivers), but lower down from where the 35W bridge gave way.=20

my favorite back-door route into Minneapolis is now cut off, under the
wreckage -- otherwise, thankfully, everyone I know is safe and accounted
for this morning.=20

Agreed. I've rarely seen more than one bad Woody Allen film at a time.

amazed by the double standard for celebrity pedophiles)

Steve Martin is pretty fantastic though as a comedian.  If anyone could
FINALLY put A CONFEDERACY OF DUNCES to the screen properly it's Steve
Martin!  And if he asked Lily Tomlin for help in putting it together it
would probably be one of the finest comedies of our lives.

By the way I JUST LOVE IT when you guys get on here and measure your cock
sizes by how many years of school you have, or other such crap!  It cracks
me up for hours!  YOU'RE THE REAL COMEDIANS!  HEHEHEHE!

Meanwhile I was thrown out of college for arguing with the professors.  It's
always amazed me I was asked to leave for THAT, and NOT because I slept with
one of them.  Well, that's for his wife to sort out, not me.

it is the long sixties, so it includes the 50s and 70s; Barry S is saying
that this is the late modern period

just like the long sixteenth century is the former baroque period called the
early modern period

actually this sort of jockeying for position & "new areas" seems like
academia being entrepreneurial

Dear List,

I'm compiling as comprehensive a list as I can of bookstores in North

i looked it up. Steve Martin didn't write or direct Pennies from Heaven.
  He starred in it. His second novel The Pleasure of My Company is worth reading.

  I love posting. It's therapeutic. I'm insufferably opinionated. Dogmatic. I dropped out of college in my Senior year.  Instead of inflicting my neurosis on friends...

I'm the one to be blamed, I started this. My initial 5, or ok, lets say
10, pertained to Bergman's generation. Now we have names
from virtually every age of cinema. What makes me glad is that
from a "silly" naming game we are now into a movie-mood sharing
specific films, personal experiences, nostalgias etc.

Great names have come up. Talking about American cinema,
we went as far back as Vertov, but sadly no one mentioned
D W Griffith whom I would call the father of modern cinema.
Also, we forgot Charles Chaplin - he made a lot of films here, in Chicago
and NY. Going around the world, I can't think of a film director better
known internationally.

Notable omissions I can think of are -

Hungary - Zoltan Fabri, Marta Meszaros, Zanussi,
the Czech new wave heros - Milos Forman, Jiri Menzel, Vera Chitilova
France - Louis Malle, Robert Bresson
India - Ritwik Ghatak, Mrinal Sen
Cuba - Tomas Alea
Poland - Roman Polanski
Germany - Volker Schlondroff, Marguerite Von Trotta
Turkey - Yilmaaz Gunay
Iran - Mohsen Makhmalbaf, Zafar Panahi
Brazil - Nelson Pereira

I just watched L'ECLISSE for the 5th time (I wrote a piece on it; be
out soon), but love the inexplicable actions of THE PASSENGER and
L'AVVENTURA.

Haven't watched Bergman since last year (AUTUMN SONATA); will return to
him, "my first film love".  I think PERSONA was the first I saw of his,
at the Brattle Theater in Cambridge, MA.  My film school.  I remember
one particular evening, at the end of a failed love affair that hadn't
quite ended, I watched three Bergman films (WILD STRAWBERRIES was one)
in a row.  But sadly, I've always attempted to watch THE SEVENTH SEAL
late at night, and I've always fallen asleep.  He taught me about
light, dark, silence and the layered frame (I think someone said
something about his depth of field, or some suchness).

Bergman's women...and Woody Allen's, Godard's, Cassavetes', Fellini's,
etc...it's more than amazing, what these women have done for film, in
film,  made visible, palpable...in an expression of the inexpressible
(to quote Blonde Redhead, a propos a Vitti), from director to actor.
didn't a book on Monica Vitti just come out?  I remember reading a
review in BookForum, I think.

My "Indelible Imagemakers" list, in no order, hella long, and really,
it could change tomorrow, and well it should; there are at least 20
filmmakers for my every mood.  As for the top whatever, and voting,
etc?  Not interested.  I'll leave that to some academy.  These folks'
works haunt, mark, stay with me, and I keep returning, seeking them out
for more:

Antonioni
Bergman
Jean-Pierre Melville
Alain Resnais
Renoir
Fellini
Almodovar
Kubrick
Godard
Kurosawa
Cassavetes
Sembene Ousmane (died last month; was also a novelist)
Bela Tarr
Coppola
Ozu
Jacques Rivette
Billy Wilder
Charles Burnett (and not just for KILLER OF SHEEP)
Satyajit Ray
Flora Gomes (and all the overlooked "African New Wave" filmmakers of
the late 80s -early 90s, along with the "Hong Kong New Wave")
Otto Preminger
Shohei Imamura
Tsai Ming Liang
Chris Marker (I dare!)
Scorcese
Luchino Visconti
Stanley Kwan
Claire Denis
Oscar Micheaux
George Cukor
Chantal Akerman
Nancy Savoca
Fassbinder
Spike Lee
John Sayles
Apichatpong Weerasethakul  (let's see, 10 years from now, what's up)
Tarkovsky
Agnes Varda

It's all so intertextual!  That's what makes the ongoing conversation
of cinema so interesting to me.  And why the list, really, means
nothing.  But I couldn't help it!

About to watch Pasolini's MAMA ROMA, and Theo Angelopoulos' THE WEEPING
MEADOW; some buyer's on point at the Brooklyn Public Library.  I also
really liked Bertolucci's BEFORE THE REVOLUTION.

Peace and light to the spirits of Igmar Bergman and Antonioni as they
pass through this world to the next, and much thanks to them for
leaving so much of themselves, and their vision, with us.

Yes, but the list probably will need constant updating. It seems that
we lose such stores with great regularity, and while others come up,
sometimes, to replace them, those seem to have very short lives. The
story here in Tucson would have been quite different at various
points here in the last 20 or so years. Even different now from 2
years ago. The last two lost that held such events or had such
selections (generally the events were better than the selections)
were Biblio (Congress St.) and Reader's Oasis (Speedway).

Gee, Woody Allen? Only one bad film?...I hope you're talking about The  Curse
of the Jade Scorpion b/c it doesn't really get any worse than that...as if
slobbering over one way-too-young-for-his-libido chickie at home wasn't enough,
 he had to cast himself as ubermensch-stud yet again charming a sweet young
thing  into pretending he's hot man-meat...thank god for scripts which are
kinder than  the gods to old men like woody...making pretty girls coo unfathomable
 sentiments....

I think people still discuss him and see him because he IS funny quite
often...the Tolstoy send ups and such...and I guess when he matured it was
interesting to watch him explore/adopt the theme of amorality (with movies like
Crimes & Misdemeanors), which I think paralleled his own life, and his  embracing
of Nietzschean ideas he had once mocked....

Manhattan is still a great big silvery kiss for New York and I think it's
still a beautiful work, it really holds up. Go, Diane!

He seems perfectly fine with making really schlocky films quite  often...like
The Purple Rose of Cairo....I still like Interiors mostly because  it's so
fun to watch the way Diane Keaton cottons to all the BIG cliches about  how a
poet is "supposed" to act and feel....and Maureen Stapleton was fabulous  in
it....if the ex wife had discovered IKEA she would still be alive and there
would be no tragedy in that movie, but tra la....

Side Effects is great bathroom literature...good job, Woody...

Radio, fossils, sound, abjection

Some extremely old (crystal) radio equipment I'll be working with in
New York and West Virginia:

The cylinders are the oldest - they're called a 'loose coupler' - this is
probably an 'Arlington' type and is an adjustable inductor used for
tuning. I think the date is between 1912-1914 which is extremely old for
radios. The earphones are newer, but I'm not sure how new, since I have a
Western Electric 1903 linesman telephone set (I showed it to you ) that I
has roughly the same design. So probably around the same time. The 'box'
is a tunable spherical inductor - I have no idea how to use this (yet; I
do have schematics back in Brooklyn); I'm guessing the date is between
1915-1919 at the latest. So all of this stuff is extremely early. The cat
whisker and galena crystal mounted on the loose coupler is much later; I'm
guessing the 50s or so. The loose coupler would have attached to elements
spread out on a bench - there weren't any 'sets' that I know of from this
period, although I may well be wrong. In other words, this is a more
modern crystal that someone attached to the board to complete the set.

I want to set all of this up with an extremely long wire antenna; I don't
think it will be that difficult and I'll probably have the thing running
in a week or so after returning to NY. The eventual idea would be to
record the roar of the world, as well as VLF signals, and then to study
the result with a modern signal analyzer, either hardware or software.


Now part of the theory here - again, thinking of mirror as digital - and
then one might think of sound and its reflections as neither or both
digital and analog - 'uncanny':

Sound always within the imminence of presence - the same sound or
granularity whether present nearby or at a distance - echo etc. gives an
indication of distance (as if there were a 'distance function), but it's a
'spread' of the original which is always already spread (in time). The
original is always present. The original is always present. Sound is
always interior and exterior, it relates to abjection (as in opposition to
the mirror (stage)); it's second person, it speaks within the body, it's a
'voice in the head' - the mirror on the other hand is all exteriority,
purification -

Echoes are uncanny - they're a dislocation of granularity; at the same
time they preserve it as a kernel (within an aura). - They re/present the
kernel as if it were within the abject.

The visible has no aura.

hello all,

was on my way to a twin cities book festival meeting (rain taxi, and
everyone there ok) when the bridge went down, saw the smoke from the truck
fire obscuring the mpls. skyline from the Lake street bridge. the reports
of missing and casualties is lower than they projected last night, though
the divers are still looking in the cars through the day and into the next
week.

can't tell you what a shock it is, to have traveled that bridge so many
times. A physicist friend of mine works in a lab at the base of the bridge.
she'd left early yesterday to help a friend move. the building, which
houses a particle accelerator, was ok, and they're now using it for
recovery operations.

so far, haven't heard of anyone in the TC lit community who was involved or
near the bridge.

also can't describe the gratitude I feel for the concern here on the list
for all here. thank you *all* for your thoughts and good wishes.

if you're looking to donate, check out www.kstp.com and the red cross.


on a lighter note, to follow the bergman thread, for those of you who turn
to DVDs of old tv show for comfort, from Northern Exposure:

Grandma Woody: "The thing that's so amazing about Bergman, aside from his
terrific Swedish gulit . . . is he doesn't try to explain away the apparent
meaninglessless of life. His films are not mere quietist exercises anymore
than they're, uh, pat expressions of radical subjectivism . . ."

Ed Chigliak:  "yeah . . ."

Proposal to reboot and de-cruft US Copyright Law

Pam Samuelson is one of the most important copyright scholars in the world, someone respected by players on all sides of the debate, and she has just published a paper modestly entitled "Preliminary Thoughts on Copyright Reform." "Preliminary Thoughts" is a brisk and readable 16-page paper that traces the origin of the present, 200+ page copyright frankenstatute, a law that has been amended 20 times since it was codified in 1976, so that it can barely be understood by experts, let alone by laypeople. However, laypeople are ever-more under its jurisdiction, since practically everything we do on the Internet involves making copies.

So Pam wants to revisit copyright, redraft it from the start, refactoring it like a Wikipedia article that has grown too large and weird to be properly understood. This is a capital idea, and her very concrete suggestions set out both a plan of attack and a set of principles that would make copyright safe for the age of the Internet.

    "By focusing on these core elements of copyright, I do not mean to suggest that nothing but these elements should be in a model copyright law or principles document. Yet perhaps anything else nominated for inclusion in the model law or principles should have to be accompanied by a justification as to why it needs to be there, and why it should not be achieved through common law evolution of copyright law by judges or delegated to an administrative rule-making process.102"

    "A model copyright law should also be written in plain English so ordinary people, and not just the high priests of copyright, can understand what it means and the normative reason that it should be part and parcel of the basic statutory framework.103 A model copyright law should also articulate the purposes that it seeks to achieve and offer some guidance about how competing interests should be balanced, perhaps through a series of comments on the model law or principles.104 "

No, I liked Curse of the Jade Scorpion.  The bad film of Allen's I'm thinking of was, I believe, called Celebrity.  His other films seem wonderful to me.  Mighty Aphrodite, for instance, is a wonderful, possibly underappreciated film.  Women may have some reason to disapprove of Allen's private life.  But what that has to do with his films, I'm not so sure.  Admittedly, some of his later films take chances with some spillover between his life and his art.  Even his latest, London-based, noncomedic film which I reviewed, called Match Point, if I remember correctly, was an extremely well-made and compelling film.  I don't expect to change any minds with this posting.  But if someone checks out Mighty Aphrodite on DVD or whatever, I will have accomplished something.  Regards, Tom Savage

I think people still discuss him and see him because he IS funny quite

the guy's an uneven filmmaker. when he was learning how to make films, and trying to be funny, he usually managed to entertain. the bourgeoisie angst of so many of his films get tiresome. Bullets over Broadway was a good movie. Allen seems best when he's not straining to become an American Bergman.

Jacket copy: “Not since *On the Road* has a book been so thoroughly of
the road. *Rhode Island Notebook*--written in Gudding's Toyota during
twenty-six roundtrips between Illinois and Rhode Island—-chronicles the
breakup of a marriage and the separation of a father and daughter. At
turns angry, comic, kitschy, and lyrical, this book-length poem is an
exorcism of violence both historical and personal. Ultimately intended
as a gift for the driver's daughter, the book also includes essays on
literary narcissism and dung; radio broadcasts; a surreal attack on
Nancy Reagan; much about Iraq; and the story of one man's friendship
with the Shenango River.”

Blurbs on jacket:

“Rhode Island Notebook is a modern/postmodern epic as a
poem-including-everything. An incredibly human/humane book at bottom, it
is also Gudding’s road of excess, as Blake once had it, leading him (&
us) to the palace of wisdom.”
-- Jerome Rothenberg

“What might have been an experiment in conceptual writing has emerged
into an exhilaration that makes me glad I’m still alive, in the midst of
critique and highways. This is the first 21st-century classic.”
–- Alan Sondheim

Sections, poems, essays from this book were first published in New
American Writing, Jacket, Aufgabe, LIT, Action Yes, MiPoesias, Salt

I refrained from listing any more directors than I did!

I have also had a hard time accepting the cinematic genius of DW =20
Griffith because of the racist narrative he was putting forward using =20=

it.  Other people are able to make the needed separations in order to =20=

see; to say he offends me isn't saying much.  For me BIRTH OF A NATION =20=

is a feature-length overlay in assaultive practices, and I've never =20
bothered to see anything else he's made because of it.  But seeing DJ =20=

Spooky's REBIRTH OF A NATION at a special screening in Providence =20
allowed me to see and understand his craft, in terms of what he, =20
technically, was doing with the camera and its cinematic, not national =20=

narrative, effects, though we're still (not) reckoning with where the =20=

twain did and still meet, on screens around the world.  I finally =20
watched all three hours of it two years ago.  I was still infuriated, =20=

but then I was like, "Oh.  That's an iris shot."  Still, my response to =20=

that as-yet-unspoken call to Griffith was the oft-unappreciated Oscar =20=

Micheaux.  I do, however, love Steve Erickson's novel invocation of =20
Griffith and cinema, DAYS BETWEEN STATIONS.

Though I've seen works from all the directors on your list of omissions =20=

(except Ghatak and Sen, so I'm on the move), Chaplin, for instance, =20
isn't part of my body because I've spent scant time watching his films, =20=

my four-year tenure at Modern Times Bookstore and left-leaning politics =20=

notwithstanding.  All the Buster Keaton I've seen in my life has been =20=

during a meza plate lunch at Olive Tree on MacDougal & W. 3rd.  Busby =20=

Berkeley: I've seen "That's Entertainment" profiles on him, then the =20
obvious references to him in Matthew Barney's CREMASTER cycle.  If =20
anything, I see for myself a need to revisit these works, since I may =20=

simply be having some psycho-trigger issues around all American silent =20=

films, thanks to Griffith.  This gets conflated into what I see as the =20=

aesthetic *scariness* of silent films: contrast, frames per second and =20=

jerky motion, mouths moving with no sound, etc.  Unintentional =20
eeriness.  I saw NOSFERATU as a child at Camp Lapham when I was 8.  =20
Keaton's makeup freaks me out.  Then, in terms of the gaze, I can't =20
comfortably project myself into that (or the majority of cinematic) =20
landscape(s); it's not *my* neck that cranes back for a kiss from X =20
leading man, nor am I that man, though a project of my own version of =20=

PURPLE ROSE OF CAIRO, for instance (what happens when a 1980s black =20
girl steps into a circa 1939 movie) could be very interesting.  I do =20
love Julie Dash's short film, ILLUSIONS, for engaging in the old =20
movie/identity conversation with panache.

Pierre said something about Americans  going for foreign films, and I =20=

want to comment on that, briefly, and expand on the above, just to say =20=

that I must, for continued mental health, allow myself cinematic =20
escapes from the American national narrative as its perpetuated in =20
film, because there are other possibilities for the =20
image-not-as-metaphor, not as racial or Other marker than the Griffith =20=

legacy allows.  Something about survival, subjectivity and perspective, =20=

than simple swooning.  We Americans are quite varied in that respect, =20=

and, judging from what I've seen from Francophone African filmmakers =20
(and Vietnamese filmmakers, too, I believe), so are the French. Etc.

I do swoon over Lubitsch, though, and Cukor, Wilder, Hawks, Huston, =20
Sturges, Vidor.  I especially like b/w films that have that =20
glitter-gloss, like THE SWEET SMELL OF SUCCESS, or BORN YESTERDAY.  I =20=

also love melodramatic films like Sirk's, and those of his ilk, and =20
enjoy the continuum as evidenced in Fassbinder and Todd Haynes, among =20=

others.  If the Brattle Theatre was film school for me, my mom was film =20=

school K-12.  Before AMC on cable, it was all about UHF on weekends for =20=

old (30s, 40s, 50s) film.  It's been a delight to spend time seeing =20
what the rest of the world was up to, cinematically, during those =20
times, dig the cross-pollination, especially during/after WWII.   I =20
also loved/hated the Rock Hudson/Doris Day/Bobby Darin-esque romantic =20=

romps.  To be that carefree....

I was just working on this quote from Tarkovsky, in which he says that =20=

people go to the cinema for time, time spent, not had or lost.  For an =20=

enhanced living experience.

So our lists, if we agree with Tarkovsky, are not ridiculous and to be =20=

I posted a note on my website today that might be of interest to some on
this list.
Based on an essay Eirik Steinhoff wrote for Chicago Review's
sixtieth-anniversary issue, the note describes the peculiar circumstances
surrounding the publication of Charles Simic's first poems in 1959, and why,
by rights, he owes something of a debt of gratitude to William S. Burroughs.

Northern Exposure was one of the smartest shows on TV in the early 90s

great episode that parodies Fellini, among others)

just put up a map on my blog showing where the bridge is/was in relation

Subject:      A Religion for Darwinians?
MIME-version: 1.0
Content-type: text/plain; charset=iso-8859-1
Content-transfer-encoding: 7bit

"A Religion for Darwinians?" is a review by H. Allen Orr of Philip Kitcher's
recent book "Living with Darwin: Evolution, Design, and the Future of
Faith". You can pick it up in the Aug 16/2007 issue of the New York Review
of Books. I see a digital copy of the review is already up at
http://badscience.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=43906 (the review isn't
available for free at http://nybooks.com).

The review actually makes me want to buy the book, though that doesn't seem
to be the primary aim of the review. The main reason I'd like to read
Kitcher's book is the way Orr discusses Kitcher's historical approach to
creationist arguments. Not simply to 'intelligent design', but to the
lineage of related arguments. And how these arguments were defeated, how
they died. Yet how they continue, in different forms.

From Orr's review:

"Kitcher hopes to accomplish two things in 'Living with Darwin'. One is to
survey various versions of creationism and to recount the arguments against
them. In doing so, he hopes to present a positive case for Darwinism and "to
formulate it in a way that people with no great training in science,
history, or philosophy could appreciate." Kitcher's other goal is more
ambitious and--given the current noisy debate over science and
religion--perhaps more important. He hopes to get at just what it is about
Darwinism that's so threattening to religion. Why is it that of all
intellectual enterprises, this one "particular piece of science provokes
such passions, requires such continual scrutiny, demands such constant
reenactment of old battles?" Kitcher believes that unless this question is
answered, we are destined to repeat the wars between evolution and creation.
In the final part of his book, Kitcher thus offers his diagnosis of the
difficulties Darwinism poses to faith and describes the adjustments to
religion that he believes are demanded by science."

http://vispo.com

ps: Just as Darwinism has provoked creationist arguments for 150 years, the
question of whether there is some part of us that is not machinistic will
undoubtedly provoke related debate for the next 150 years (at least). In
other words, the question of whether there are thought processes of which
humans are capable and computers are not is a similarly controversial issue.
But while Darwinism has primarily provoked religious people, the
human/machine issue seems to provoke a broader audience who believes that
machines cannot, even in theory, be capable of all human thought processes.

Awesome!

And thanks for the map; I've never been to Minneapolis.  I made my
first real visit to the midwest just last year, Wisconsin (both Kenosha
and Wausau), so I'm still pondering the wonder that is Lake Michigan.

Question to all: should we be worried that Mark Nowak hasn't said
anything about being okay?  Did I miss something?

for me, the sixties really began with the assasination of JFK and ended with
the advent of disco -- but that's just how I remember it -- which must mean I
wasn't there --

at least one of the northern exposure writers was one of a contingent of
hampshire college grads (from my era, the 70s) who relocated to homer,
alaska, for a # of years after college.  i guess he turned his adventure
into something substantively creative.  sorry, all, i just can't help
bragging about hampshire college, my hippie school from way back

What about you folks?
I went to Minneapolis sometime in the eighties or early nineties to do
some readings
and so on.
And in 2003, on a baseball trip, I passed THROUGH Minneapolis. You can
do that
on the highway, so deep in a groove that you can see only the tops of
buildings.

if you cannot believe these are true, you are naive
if you believe these are true, you truly see through things
things as they are are not things as they seem to be
to see through things is to understand true conspiracies
by definition all conspiracies are true
the transparency of these images implies their opacity
the world is encrypted
to believe otherwise is to live and die on the surface
the wise follow themselves no matter where they lead
leaders speak other languages
conspiracy implies the regularity of the surface
surfaces close ranks behind the naive
one sees only the tips of signs like icebergs
signs emerge at unexpected moments of everyday life
the rule of conspiracy:
((( a -> b ) & ( c -> d )) -> (( e -> a ) & ( e -> c )))
the center is the peripheral
belief in conspiracy is not belief
there are those who do not want you to believe this
that there are those who do not want you to believe this makes you
  important
i am important since i have discovered that there are those who do
  not want you to believe this
because i am important you are important
because i write this you are important
listen: sound, not sight, travels through walls
linear sight disrupts the signs revealed by scripture and inscription
conspiracy is aural
this is an absolute and absolute truth

In Barry Bonds I See The Future of Poetry

The inevitability of Barry Bonds serves notice to all poets invested in the Humanist
tradition: your tenure is doomed. Barry Bonds is not only the future of athletics, but
he's also emblematic of the future of poetry. More machine than man, chemically enhanced,
Bonds is our first mainstream Posthuman public figure. Moving awkwardly, robot-like,
festooned with machines -- a barrage of cameras following his every move and enormous
noise-canceling headphones to silence the jeers -- he's a media-made
technologically-supplemented Frankenstein. We dismiss him a as fraud, but we know in our
hearts that his way is the way of the future; regardless, we cheer his accomplishment. We
disdain his Posthumanism, but we shall soon come to realize that we created the
phenomenon of Barry Bonds. We demand our athletes to be super-human and super-human they
shall be. Bonds just points to the fact that being human has ceased to be enough: we
demand the precision and complexity of machines, in athletes, in politicians, in business
and in the arts. And what we demand, we now have.

Barry Bonds has become the embodiment of Posthuman: "the [hypothetical future] present
being whose basic capacities so radically exceed those of present humans as to be no
longer unambiguously human by our current standards." We react in kind: we deny Bonds his
humanness ("He is either unfazed by negativity or internalizes every hostile remark," one
newsman recalls) and call him cold, unresponsive, selfish ("'I take care of me,'' Bonds
tells reporters). Futurism made flesh, Barry Bonds is a lovechild of William S. Burroughs
("We ourselves are machines") and Andy Warhol ("I want to be a machine"):

Bonds' milestone signifies an end to the humanist discourse. In the classic sense of
Baudrillard's "The Precession of Simulacra," the idea of Barry Bonds has long preceded
the actual event, hence predetermining the outcome. And the outcome is obvious. Barry
Bonds is being crucified for the inevitable; he is a martyr for the future. And in the
future, just as our children will reminisce about when humans beings still played
baseball, we shall reminisce about the time when human beings still wrote poetry for
other humans.

I enjoyed reading your long response to my "sinful" confession.
As for the cinematic genius of D.W.Griffith, yes, I meant his technical
contributions which were really ground breaking and much needed at
that time. His technical contributions must have advanced the art of
cinema several years or maybe decades. Likewise, Robert J Flaherty
made an unequivocal contribution, I tend to think, with his 1922 documentary
Nanook of the North.

Satyajit Ray, back in the seventies, said in an interview, " I think what
six hundred years of English literature had achieved from Chaucer to
Joyce, cinema had covered in sixty years". If that is true, Griffith
Flaherty etc. deserve a heartfelt thanks from their successors.

Ghatak's films, like Gunay's, might be hard to find. He is an absolutely
brilliant, sound and cerebral auteur who would simultaneously overplay
with emotions, at times, purposely. A large gamut of his films deal with
the partition theme - Partition of a country, a society, culture,
disintegrating
morality, dilapidating humanism etc. But it is also balanced with hope,
with the lust of living on. Many believe, if he had a little luck
on his side, was a little more diciplined, a little less alcoholic and much
more compromising, Ghatak would have shot into fame even before Ray,
in Indian scene. Today he is hardly known in his own country except his
state. His films once had a wide Russian audience, also French, George
Sadoul was his best connoisseur. Some University libraries here in the US,
have him archived- I don't know which ones.

The Tarkovsky quote is really poetic and will continue to spark for a long
time.
Just last night, I was interviewing poet John Ashbery. Many of us have our
own special reasons to hate or love his poetry. I have a very deep
admiration
for his work although I have read him in the recent years only. He is known
to
have drawn a lot from cross-artistic, multi-aesthetic domains.
He was telling me last night that lately he watches movies a lot and is
influenced by many younger directors like Guy Maddin, Jorgen Leth etc.

I can't explain why, but Ashbery's poem "This Room" have always reminded me
of Ingmar Bergman's "Wild Strawberries". That didn't Ashbery, he said, "yes,
I think there is a scene in the film where the old Professor enters a room
which he seems to remember"....I think it wasn't a room but a mansion-garden
where he revisits his younger days.

The garden I entered is the reverie of this garden

For me, films excite poetry, they let us juggle with our memories (time
spent), hand-holding us and at a point we begin to realize we are juggling
more than what was ours, other experiences have been thrown into the mix,
the cloth we wear, have spun out to cover lives that were not ours.

Thanks for providing a little doze of inspiration

I refrained from listing any more directors than I did!

I have also had a hard time accepting the cinematic genius of DW
Griffith because of the racist narrative he was putting forward using
it.  Other people are able to make the needed separations in order to
see; to say he offends me isn't saying much.  For me BIRTH OF A NATION
is a feature-length overlay in assaultive practices, and I've never
bothered to see anything else he's made because of it.  But seeing DJ
Spooky's REBIRTH OF A NATION at a special screening in Providence
allowed me to see and understand his craft, in terms of what he,
technically, was doing with the camera and its cinematic, not national
narrative, effects, though we're still (not) reckoning with where the
twain did and still meet, on screens around the world.  I finally
watched all three hours of it two years ago.  I was still infuriated,
but then I was like, "Oh.  That's an iris shot."  Still, my response to
that as-yet-unspoken call to Griffith was the oft-unappreciated Oscar
Micheaux.  I do, however, love Steve Erickson's novel invocation of
Griffith and cinema, DAYS BETWEEN STATIONS.

Though I've seen works from all the directors on your list of omissions
(except Ghatak and Sen, so I'm on the move), Chaplin, for instance,
isn't part of my body because I've spent scant time watching his films,
my four-year tenure at Modern Times Bookstore and left-leaning politics
notwithstanding.  All the Buster Keaton I've seen in my life has been
during a meza plate lunch at Olive Tree on MacDougal & W. 3rd.  Busby
Berkeley: I've seen "That's Entertainment" profiles on him, then the
obvious references to him in Matthew Barney's CREMASTER cycle.  If
anything, I see for myself a need to revisit these works, since I may
simply be having some psycho-trigger issues around all American silent
films, thanks to Griffith.  This gets conflated into what I see as the
aesthetic *scariness* of silent films: contrast, frames per second and
jerky motion, mouths moving with no sound, etc.  Unintentional
eeriness.  I saw NOSFERATU as a child at Camp Lapham when I was 8.
Keaton's makeup freaks me out.  Then, in terms of the gaze, I can't
comfortably project myself into that (or the majority of cinematic)
landscape(s); it's not *my* neck that cranes back for a kiss from X
leading man, nor am I that man, though a project of my own version of
PURPLE ROSE OF CAIRO, for instance (what happens when a 1980s black
girl steps into a circa 1939 movie) could be very interesting.  I do
love Julie Dash's short film, ILLUSIONS, for engaging in the old
movie/identity conversation with panache.

Pierre said something about Americans  going for foreign films, and I
want to comment on that, briefly, and expand on the above, just to say
that I must, for continued mental health, allow myself cinematic
escapes from the American national narrative as its perpetuated in
film, because there are other possibilities for the
image-not-as-metaphor, not as racial or Other marker than the Griffith
legacy allows.  Something about survival, subjectivity and perspective,
than simple swooning.  We Americans are quite varied in that respect,
and, judging from what I've seen from Francophone African filmmakers
(and Vietnamese filmmakers, too, I believe), so are the French. Etc.

I do swoon over Lubitsch, though, and Cukor, Wilder, Hawks, Huston,
Sturges, Vidor.  I especially like b/w films that have that
glitter-gloss, like THE SWEET SMELL OF SUCCESS, or BORN YESTERDAY.  I
also love melodramatic films like Sirk's, and those of his ilk, and
enjoy the continuum as evidenced in Fassbinder and Todd Haynes, among
others.  If the Brattle Theatre was film school for me, my mom was film
school K-12.  Before AMC on cable, it was all about UHF on weekends for
old (30s, 40s, 50s) film.  It's been a delight to spend time seeing
what the rest of the world was up to, cinematically, during those
times, dig the cross-pollination, especially during/after WWII.   I
also loved/hated the Rock Hudson/Doris Day/Bobby Darin-esque romantic
romps.  To be that carefree....

I was just working on this quote from Tarkovsky, in which he says that
people go to the cinema for time, time spent, not had or lost.  For an
enhanced living experience.

So our lists, if we agree with Tarkovsky, are not ridiculous and to be
apologized for or silenced, but, yes, Aryanil, the beginnings of a much
bigger, deeper conversation.

Thanks for starting this!

back to work....

I finished my graduate school coursework at SUNY Buffalo in 1971.
My first alert to the change from the '60s came when I went to the
Rathskeller to look up some friends I hadn't seen in a few months.
In the section where, for years, the poets, musicians, painters &
sundry freaks had hung since c. '63 (post-Dallas), business majors
had moved in; in fact, they seem to have taken over the whole scene.
So, weirdly, for me, the shift began at the University. The city hung
on for several more years--in fact, a popular query of the time ran,
"When will the '70s begin?" (As they say, "be careful what you ask
for.") Because I stayed pretty broke untill '77, the '60s lingered on
for me. Still, I agree with Aldon about disco as death knell: the
week of April 30, 1976, Johnny Taylor's "Disco Lady" topped the
pop charts (the first song with disco in the title, I believe); the week
of June 10, 1977, John Travolta & Olivia Newton-John hit the top
with "You're the one that I want." So America had, basically, 200
years before the shit hit the fan. For me, the '70s meant, pretty much,
the Carter years. From Reagan on, catastrophe: a deluge, interrupted
briefly by Clinton's finger in the dike, and now tsunamified by W. So:
'63-'77, I'd say, for the Sixties; '78-'80 for the Seventies, & '81-now
for It Just Don't Matter Any More (at least, at 62, to me; no doubt
younger folks will have more acute senses of 'decade' than I do, but
it really seems to me that nothing new has happened in a long time).

Hi,

I'm doing research on shamans, griots, & the role of orally transmitted
poetry in indigenous cultures. Can anyone please recommend any good books
that relate to this subject? Jerome Rothenberg's "Technicians of the Sacred:
A Range of Poetries from Africa, America, Asia, and Oceania" and Stephen
Berg's "The Steel Cricket" are excellent.

Thanks,

Dan

Went to Minneapolis in 1983 for the first time, from Madison
Wisconsin where I had begun making books & publishing handmade
editions by various writers, to hear Robert Creeley talk & read on
the occasion of a major Jim Dine retrospective at the Walker Art
Center. Moved to Minneapolis in 1993 (from Tucson Arizona) to direct
Minnesota Center for Book Arts, taking Chax Press there for that time
and publishing books while there by Kathleen Fraser, Norman Fischer,
& Myung Mi Kim, among others. Got to know & really appreciate Maria
Damon & Mark Nowak & Gary Sullivan & Marta Deike (the latter two in
St. Paul at the time before moving to New York), and tried to turn
some of MCBA attention toward literary projects & literature/book
arts conjunctions. Very much enjoyed time there & was on that bridge
many times, although not on anything like a daily basis. Must have
just missed George Bowering if he was there in the early nineties.
Left in August 1996 to return to Tucson. Would like to get to
Minneapolis/St. Paul more these days, if possible.

Hi Dan,

I think there was a good feature on the griot in Talisman back in the
day....I think it was in an issue focusing on Nate Mackey but I'm not sure...or
maybe it was written by Mackey...now I'm thinking that is more  plausible...

wait...let me check my old Talis....okay...number 9 is the Mackey issue and
the whole shaman/griot thing is strongly present...number 8 has the concluding
 part of Mackey's Gassire's Lute which is his really interesting reading of
Duncan and the lineage is interesting...I assume # 7 would have the first part
 of this work...

And of course I'm sure you got the Maria Sabina thing from Mr. Rothenberg
which umbilically connects to Anne Waldman's work...

just first thoughts on an endlessly deep  well....

I just watched The Land of Look Behind, Alan Greenberg's 1982 movie
visiting Jamaica at the time of Bob Marley's funeral (in the features,
Werner Herzog confesses he never really was that gone on reggae, who
knew).  It's sort of a horrifying movie in that ugliness & poetry,
extreme poverty & elegance, the sublime & the ridiculous tangle rawly &
heartstoppingly.  These guys speak nonstop in a kind of overflowing
blaze -- it's all hitched to a ridiculous & functional out-and-out
commitment to Rasta.
I guess I'll stick with humanism until the crowd thins out.

(a section of a post of mine with references to Griffith and many silent
film makers etc didnt get through for some reason--thogh the rest of letter
did, a few days ago--which was re Buster Keaton and Sembene, Leone and
Pontecorvo and listed many other directors and grnes etc--)

     D W Griffith is crucial viewing if one is to understand film history
and the development of an immense amount of film language.  He made a very
large number of excellent, great,  films and to ignore him due to one seems
a way of denial of film's history and the bases of much of its initial
language, still in use to this day.
        One of the interesting things going on in early Griffith is how he
is trying to find a cinematic language through the examples of the popular
theater of the times and stereotyped images from photogrphy as well as
trying to see what the film can do with the novel and "epic".  The heavy
weight of the late Victorian the popular theater and much of the popular
literature of the time's tropes has to be somehow battled through --and
watching Griffith's films is a "birth of cinema" process in action from film
to film.  Like many "pioneers" and "inventors" --Pound and Stein for
example--the personal views and politics of Griffith are backward looking
while the vision in terms of cinema is ever moving forward from out of the
immense sort of crap that both Stein and Pound were also combating in their
work.  The paradox of the simultaneous existence of the very conservative
and the very radical or "new" in a great deal of art and a great many
artists since time began is of course a never ending puzzle, an enigma of
the contrary (supposedly --) impulses towards the new on fringes of what is
seen at the time as chaos--and the old, the embodiment of order.  The
fusion--or fission--of the contrary elements--does produce inded
"groundbreaking" "pioneering" works while often enought the person doing the
producing may well be mired in the longing for the good old dyas and froms
of repressive order.

         The way in which the awareness of cinema and its history,
languages, can be learned has evolved greatly with dvds, videos,
downloadable materials of all kinds.  In a very real sense a person can
study cinema without ever going to the cinema. The privatizing of the
"screening room" so to speak, to one viewer comfortably ensconced in one's
own controlled domain--is different from the social experience of the cinema
whether one watches outdoors at drive ins or court yard cinemas with a
hanging sheet as the screen, or at the shrines of the cinema located in big
cities (cinematehques, museums etc)--or in the airplane like seatings of
megaplex theaters. The shift in the context of viewing films closes some
avenues of thinking and opens others.  I think a great deal of interesting
work can be done on this shift--and the proliferation of new forms of
development of conciousness of the viewing experience--as well as the way it
can shift also the viewer's ways of perceiving the "world outside".  Being
able to frreze frame, slow forward, fast fowrad,watch at many different
speeds or study one frame of one image for hours if one wants, to be ble to
view a filmover and over and over or to view in selected parts over and over
only--the viewer becomes an obsessive fetishist, or a new form of auteur via
editing and amplification visually of the selected frames--and the speeds at
which they are "run". And many mnay other possibilities open--

             When i was 16 years old i was a throughgoing film fanatic--and
at the time the only real place in the world to be for such a person was the
Cinematheque Francaise in Paris. I'd work before school, after school,
weekends and then the first 38 straight days of summer--to get plane ticket,
passport and throw togtehr a tiny shoulder bag of things to take along.
Sleping in parks and abondoned buildings, once under the Eifel
Tower--walking the streets endlessly--the Coinmatheque, then located in the
Musee de l'homme across the Seine from the Eifel Tower--was mecca--they ran
five different films a day, each one of them part of a related series based
on a theme, a director, actor, etc--a genre--a country's cinema and so
forth--I went so often and started helping with some clean up work--and
brining postage stmps on letters from USA to the woman in charge of the
ticket stall--that earned a Free Pass sort of badge one showed when ever
attending a screening.  (Which at the time cost roughly fifty cents american
for students).  Not al the versions of films one saw were the best in the
world--as M. henri Langlois in building the world's largest collection of
films had beg cajoled stolen and accomplished by all sorts of "Arabian
Nights" fantastic adventures the obtaining of whatever prints he could get
his hands on.  Thus I saw a version in Portuguese of Hitchock's film
lifeboat, with subtitles in Farsi.  There were many such multi-lingual films
one saw--and though some groans here and there--the hard core cinephiles--of
course--no objection!  After all one was there to "see the film" and even at
the most literal level of this, the possiblity of learning a great deal more
in one's never ending travels into the wilds of the cinema.  There were  a
hard core group of Parisian cinephiles always there and a great many like
myself who had come from all over the world just to be at the Cinematheque.
Being the youngest and one of the most fantic denizens of this world, had
also some percs--as one was introduced to M. Langlois, who became a sort of
benevolent Uncle--and via him , Truffaut and Godard when they came--and by
literally being run into on the stairs by her--Anais Nin, there for a mini
festival of films by her husband. All the time of course, everything was
cinema--conversation in between the films, then the near-silent bordering on
the religious vieiwing of the films, then more talk, then back into the
screening room--
         Paris at the time had more movie theaters and more different films
showing than any other place on earth--so not only the Cinematheuqe to go
to, but many others, many of which specialize in only one genre--Westerns,
or Films Noir from around the world, etc--comedies, foreign films--silent
films--there were all night cinemas where one could sleep rather
uncomfortably when raining outside--and very dark ones to hide in after some
various anarchist undertakings--(after all Oswald was arrested in a
cinema--and John Dillinger gunned down on exiting from one--)--and through
the various cinemas and cinematheque making a n ever widening circle of
friends, acquaintances, contacts, and having many strange adventures. some
very brutal, some in the CRS prisons, some living in an Anarchist cell of
four others in a building i realized a month later had been an address of
Rimbaud's at one point--after a while one would wonder--what was  "real",
what was a dream in the few hours of sleep--what was part of a film--and
what a memory of a memory of a film seen in a dream about watching
films--dreamed while walking in one's near-sleep at two am across Paris to a
room put in charge of for a month--
           The impulse of the cinema obsession spilled over into everything
else--the walls of the cinema dissolve into the spaces of streets--one lives
among the fluidities of states of being and ways of perception, hearing,
moving--cinema, dream, memory, imagination, concrete fact--all of it
swirling about one --in dreams five camera set ups for the scenes and
immediately the editing process at work--then the projection work--(later i
worked as projectionist, film reviewer, usher,cleaner of cinemas)--

            Today one has access to far more films than the Cinematheque can
hold--one doesn't need to go anywhere to see the history and languages of
cinema in the "privacy and security of one's home". In a really weird way,
one can be as Stalin and Hitler were--who each had access to world
cinemas--much of it never seen by their subjects--and viewed the films in
privacy and security--
              One can now create a Cinemathque in one's home, if having the
money for it--and track down things which used to be impossibly rare--films
one might well read a lot about yet never in a lifetime think one would
see.  Today's situation is like a kind of Nirvana of the future for the
cinephile of the past--except that a great deal of the viewing experience
and life involved with it--is not present--the audience is missing--and a
"Mass Art" or "Art for the Masses" becomes a privitzation, paradoxically in
many cases, of ownership of out of print, hard to find dvds and vcr
cassettes--and from the Mass Art of the age of mechanical reproduction one
finds again a strange re-manifestation of the "aura" of the rare object.  A
public Cinematheque can be surpassed or subverted  by a private one, which
eschews the public open doors of the Cinema and opens instead those of a
private domain of untold of luxuries . . . which may, unlike the public
collections of libraries etc--seen but by a very few . . . so again the
Cinema is returned to a state of "rare screenings"--though in many cases
ones not in the least "open to the public".
            One can envision in this way the revisionism of new histories of
Cinema, new ways of altering the languages of the cinema, erasing here,
adding there, moving this director in and that one out, redeploying the
contexts of the time of production and distribution into an aestheticized
re-representation of re-reworkings of histories, audiences, locations,
languages . . .

            One has the immense advantage now also of very good copies of
very good prints of films, complete with the extra dvd of interviews, scenes
cut out of the orginal release, etc etc-- and books with a wealth of
knowledge and information that is incredible.  Again, this is something
which seems like an immense Nirvana of what would have been--and was, very
much!-- dreamt of in various ways by the cinephiles attending yet another
screwy version of the hodge podge collection at the Cinematheque.
           A curious effect though of man of the poor copies with the multi
dubbed and multi subtitled languages accompanying the cinematic language and
soundtrack musics--a strange effect of this blurring of boundaries of
images, languages, sounds--is that it also gave brith to much cinema made by
the people who had been coming to this realized manifestation of the single
minded will of M. Langlois, one of the great colorful figures in cinema
history.
         The Cinematheque and others like it devoted as the ones in NYC are
to their own cinemas--the underground etc--these still exist--and also a
great many excellent film societies and series throughout the world--in
which there is still the viewing of the harder to see films by an audience
brought together by the passion and interest of the cinema.
          To understand cinema--an industry producing products for
audiences, whether mass or smaller, selected ones--the sense of the audience
needs to be contact with physically even in the age of the private screening
which can turn into a form of dictatorship--just as the conglomerate control
of distribution, production, marketing--is a form of dictatorship. An
awareness of the complexities involved in making, distributing, marketing
cinema and in turn the ways in which it is from a megaplex to a tiny film
society borrowed room, to the private viewing in one's home-fortress--needs
to be continually brought to bear on the ways in which the cinema is being
viewed and understood, as an art form, and as an art form within historical
and economical and ideological contexts, within very differing cultural
environments happening at many different "times" of film history
simultaneously--with one area be more "advanced" in one way, another in
another--and others--"discovering cinema" at a later time in its
development--how this has effected ways of seeing cinema differently from
cultures which have been involved with cinema viewing since earlier phases
of its development.
      The same sense of time holds true for people in one's own
life--according to their ages, where they entered into the history of
film--how it was made, distributed, shown--when they first started watching
films--
          Re the silent cinema--I had the immense good fortune at one point
to see a series of Chaplin silents and other silent films (Keaton, etc,
Classics from abroad also) with my grandparents. (English wa my
grandfather's second language; his original being Joual.) They were laughing
and responding to the movements of the faces on the screen--without waiting
for the boards with the printed words to appear.  They said that in their
youth everyone read the lips of the actors and knew the dialogue that way.
But the really treasured moments were the actors and actresses who instead
of saying (mouthing) the words of the script--would be smiling sweetly as
the director demanded, while their lips were at the same time visibly saying
to the educated audience (educated in reading lips by the cinema--)--"screw
you you old SOB"--and lovers on screen telling each other how loathsome the
other was, what a complete *** and impotent to boot!--M grandparents also
pointed out that if one watched carefully body language and hand signs--very
often there was an entirely different dialogue going on that what  the
mouths were pronouncing. apparently the "inexplicable popularity" of many
stars of the time had as much to do with their abilities at literally
appearing to say one thing while actually saying another.  With the coming
of sound, this whole wild subterranean aspect of cinema was lost--now the
actors and actresses had to say what they were supposed to say--rather than
being able to say two or three things all at once, and each one
contradicting or subverting the others.  The coming of sound my grandmother
said, was actually a very sad day for a lot of the fun of the movies
disappeared.
      (The early days of sound with the very stationary mic set ups also
made the cinema go backwards as afr as locomotion of humans was
concerned--now they had to restrict movements to within mic range--and hence
the period dominated in US for a breif period by the film versions of a
great many plays, a return paradoxically to an aspect of the early cinema,
in which the film is finding its way through the immense clap-trappings of
the Victorian theater--as the Naturalists and Pound and Stein, etc etc etc
Anderson, Hemingway, Williams et alia- were finding ways to write through
the heavy folds of late 19th century poetry and prose--sound brought things
back to the stage temporarily--and seemed at first a reactionary mode after
the heights of the Silent Film visually---many of them still among the
greatest films ever made--)
        A great history of the early cinema is Kevin Brownlow's classic The
Parade's Gone By. Sadly many of the great Silent Films, like Keaton's were
"lost" (and then found in Stalin's vaults) along with a great many others
never found and others existing, like Stroheim's great epic Greed, and a
number of Abel Gance's projects, among hundreds of others, only in a
fragmentary state--(though roughly four hours of it, out of the seven plus
have survived--a lotof Classic Silent Cinema existing in a manner not that
much different from surviving fragments and trunks, torsos, of Classic Greek
Poetry or Sculpture, for one example of such--)
         (Godard and Eisenstein both took a lot from Griffith's films--and
have written on him--as has Stan Brakhage--whose Brakhage Lectures are on
silent and silent/later sound directors Melies, Eisenstein, Dreyer as well
as Griffith)
      The Dancing Chicken actually was greatly popularized by Colonel Tom
Parker, before he became Elvis Presley's manager.  The trick is to have the
chickens standing on a heated metal plate which is concealed beneath a cloth
from the audience's view.  The extremely hot metal of course, even through
cloth, causes the chickens to hop from leg to leg and give them the
appearnce of "dancing".  A classic old Carnie con on which the Colonel built
his reputation throughout the South.  (Carried further by another Colonel,
who went from hot plates for dancing chickens to simply frying them by the
millions . . . a food favored by Colonel Tom's client, the King.)

I'm planning to move there in a few years--need to get things settled here first. I consider Mpls./St. Paul area a good place to live. Years ago when I wanted to move there, I didn't think that it was a good idea  because I was a single mom w/2 kids and housing was too expensive. (It's cheap compared to other cities, but I was on the welfare plan at the time.) I am certainly looking forward to moving there, lots of music, theater, and friends.  I'm not sure about the poetry scene, but I do know that there are some great small publishers in the area. I go to the Twin Cities Book Publishers, and it's always wonderful.

  The bridge--I probably walked across it when I lived in Dinkytown back in the early 70's, but I don't know for sure. In my opinion, the collapse of the bridge is political. Someone reminded me that the whole no new taxes thing began with the Reagan administration. Taxes are good--too many politicians and greedy americans have forgotten that. I see that Pawlenty has agreed to increasing the gas tax, and he was against it before he was for it.

i think i saw something on the list about identity splicing earlier,
so I'm trying to track it down as well as to hear about any other work
related to this.

it's hard to explain what identity splicing is yet, but I think that
Juliana Spahr and Eugene Ostashevsky are doing it.

Juliana Spahr (in Everything With Lungs) seems to have shown how
(since the advent of chaos theory) it seems to be appropriate to cycle
through everything else in order to deal with your own identity.

Eugene Ostashevsky, with his DJ Spinoza series, suggestst that some
kind of synchonizing would be in order to deal with what I think Allen
Sondheim has been calling dispersed identity.


2) this is where the swarm intelligence and autopoesis theory comes
in, or emergent patterns...

3) eventually, i'll try to trace all of this back to explain how it's
the next step after Samuel Becket and Gertrude Stein, who made
articulations in the "stream of consciousness" and started showing us
mixable atoms...

In fact it is much more fun to just look at people figuring all of
this out creatively though, so if anyone knows of any good works on
this, i'd be much obliged.

I was thinking that too.  The fatalities themselves were pretty low -- more
injuries than fatalities.  Hopefully he's just traveling or hasn't been

Awesome!

And thanks for the map; I've never been to Minneapolis.  I made my
first real visit to the midwest just last year, Wisconsin (both Kenosha
and Wausau), so I'm still pondering the wonder that is Lake Michigan.

Question to all: should we be worried that Mark Nowak hasn't said
anything about being okay?  Did I miss something?

It might be smart to step out of discipline. Browse the anthro

No,

The worst impulses of Woody Allen (his desire to be the critics' darling)
meets the weeker Bergan. For me the great Bergman movies are the later ones,
made for T.V.: Fanny and Alexander and Scenes from a Marriage, when he had
stopped talking to dead people on the beach playing chess. Is that not
embarrassing after a certain age?

I though perhaps I will still like Smiles of A Summer Night, but I am not
sure. I was never able to go through Persona a second time.

Fanny and Alexander is absolutely great, a haunting movie. I love the Hamlet
production in it and the incredible decor of the house and that wierd horse
carriage in which some members of the family travel.the Sergio Leone movies,
maybe Who Shot Liberty Valence

At one time, woody Allen had made an analysis of Shane for The New York
Times, as one of the few American movies he liked. He gave the impression he
was slumming. Who among lovers of Westerns consider Shane as their favorite
Western? Nobody. Maybe The Man Who Shot Liberty Valence, maybe The Man from
Laramie, but Shane? Alright, maybe The Searchers or The Red River or even
the one where Spencer Tracy is a severe pater familia and has a Mexican
wife. Has anyone seen the Western directed by Marlon Brando?

My favorite Woody Allen movies: Broadway Danny Rose (where he has learnt to
laugh at himself), Radio Days (I just love this one), Crimes and Other
Misdemeanors, Bananas.

Has anyone sat through an Antonioni movie recently?

I see one major problem with that software, which is that people who edit
controversial pages or pages that were prone to vandalism prior to being
locked will be ranked as less trustworthy than those who stick to quiet
backwaters. Furthermore, while it may be true "that there's no easy way to
separate the wheat from the chaff" on Wikipedia, there certainly is one way
available: check the sources, which is something people should learn to do
anyway, whether they're dealing with Wikipedia or a book from a university
press.  Granted, it's always good to have more information available, but I
would have my reservations about using the software with students, as it
seems likely that many of them would simply come to rely on its judgments
rather than developing their own critical thinking abilities.

Notes from the scene of the crime. First clue, poetry. Think outside the
page...

To kick start some dastardly acts of poetry, National Poetry Week invites
poets to hide their poems in public spaces and to submit clues to the
Director for publication on the National Poetry Week  website. You can then
launch your poetry campaign to see if anyone can find your poems.

Best way to submit is to send to jfk@nationalpoetryweek.com with the word
'submission' in the subject line.
Submit in the following format.

Example

Poem: Emergency
Poet: Jayne Fenton Keane
Clue:  It is hidden in the grass behind a tanned person wearing a red and
yellow hat between Surfers Paradise and Magic Mountain.

Enjoy!

I do not thing what is being described is such a new process. Pessoa's
heteronyms are the most prominent example of it.

I am just reading Charles Bernstein's interview with Douglas Messerli's on
Messerli's poetry in  "My Year 2005: Terrifying Times," just published by
Green Integer. Messerli  elaborates on his poetry and his other work as
playright, novelist, publisher of books, etc. completely in heteronymic
terms.

The anniversary of Hiroshima  6 August 1945 8:15 a.m.

Sembrar la Memoria

the following excerpts are from Nine Who Survived Hiroshima and Nagasaki
Personal Experiences of Nine Men Who Lived Through the Atomic Bombings
 Robert Trumball, E.P Dutton, 1957.

        Ten years after the bombings, it was learned that a search of all
Japanese records indicated that 18 people had survived both the Hiroshima
and the Nagasaki atomic blasts.  An extensive search throughout Japan
located eleven of the 18.  Nine agreed to speak of their experiences.
       The bombs dropped on the two Japanese cities are barely firecrackers
compared to the weapons that the USA and Israel are discussing dropping on
Iran.  Radioactive elements in weapons used in the First Gulf War and since
in Iraq and Afghanistan, as well as the as yet unknown, uniidentified
Israeli weapons used in Lebanon last summer, have been causing new forms of
illness, as yet inexplicable burns and wounds for which there are no cures
as yet. The effects of nuclear weaponry being dispersed, in smaller doses,
across populations and soldiers, using persons as "living laboratories" of
effects bringing slower or faster deaths, polluting gene pools, and, via
human waste, corpses, planting the poisons in water supplies and the soil.
      Populations and landscapes made radioactive, slowly burning alive,
without having to drop the bombs first.

Trumball:

    "Instantly the sky was blanked out by the incandescent white light of
the monstrous fireball.  Scientists estimated that the ball was 250 feet in
diameter and a hundred times as bright as the sun, with a heat of 1,000,000
degrees Centigrade. he same as the sun's interior There was a roar of sound
that is indescribale. for there is nothing with which it can be compared.
Then came a wave of concussion that instantly leveled 6,820 buildings, and
badly damaged 3, 750 more.  The earth for a mile around the blast center was
bombarded with deadly gamma rays and neutrons and showered with radioactive
fission products..  The fireball sucked up millions of tons of dust and
pulverized debris that quickly began to form the the great, ugly mushroom
cloud.  The city fell under a dark pall, and a muddy rain began to fall . .
.
      "In the city of approximately 255, 000, more than half the population
was instantly dead or incapicitated (dead above 64,000, injured 72,000).
Casualties who escaped death  in the blast were badly burned. or injured by
falling timbers, or flying glass.  No city was ever more prostrate.  All
means of comminication were gone.  Seventy per cent of the fire fighting
equipment was destroyed, and 80 per cent of the fire-fighting personnel were
killed, wounded or otherwise unable to respond to the emergency.  Concussion
had broken the water mians, and pipes were melted in the incredible heat.
Many burning buildings were inacessible anyway,blocked off as they were by
the debris of fallen structures . . .
     "Of forty-five hospitals, only three were left standing.  Only
twenty-eight out of 290 physicians in the city were unhurt, and 126 of the
1,780 nurses . . .
     "With all facilities virtually nonexistent, the city was at the mercy
of the flames, and by two o'clock in the afternoon the six islands (of the
city) were a sea of fire.  Terror was heightened by the flaming windstorm
caused by convection as the air was drawn at thirty to forty miles an hour
to the blazing center of the blast . . .

     "The door facing Yamaguchi opened, and five boys, fifteen or sixteen
years old, came running out.  They were unclothed except for torn
underpants, and Yamaguchi saw that theywere covered in blood . . .
     "'I had never seen such a horrifying sight as those five shivering
boys.  Blood was pouring in streams from deep cuts all over their bodies,
mingling with their perspiration, and their skin was burned deep red, like
the color of cokked lobsters.  At first it seemed, strangely, that their
burned and lacerated backs and chests were growing green grass! Then I saw
that hundreds of blades of sharp grass had been driven deep into their
flesh, evidently by the force of the blast." . . . . (these boys had been
inside a small factory building--not outdoors)


     "Hirata set out for home . . .
      "'There was not a house standing as far as I could see . . . Although
I knew the city well,  it was actually difficult to find my way, for al the
familiar landmarks were gone, and the streets I often walked were now buried
in debris and ashes' . . .
         "Hirata noticed, with a shock, that there wasn't a living being in
sight. "It was as if the people who had lived in this uncanny city had been
reduced to ashes with their houses,' he said . . .
        As he moved slowly through the ashes, he came to the first ghastly

       "'The first was a little boy,' he recalls. 'He was completely naked,
his skin was all peeled off as if he had been flayed, and the nails were
falling from the ends of his fingers.  His flesh was all deep red.  When I
first saw him I wasn't sure if I was looking at a human being

       "'There were numberless injured persons all around me, lying on the
ground, some held down by fallen timbers, all screaming and shouting for
help.  I saw that they were all still alive,m but horribly injured.  Many
looked like ghosts, with the skin peeled off their faces and hanging down
over their shoulders like thin silk pennants.  All those facing in the
direction of the blast had their exposed skin torn off in a thick layer
whgich had blown back.  The sight left me numb with horror.' . . . .

Sitting through those is always a pleasure for me.
Last one was The Passenger, just a week or two
ago. Currently looking forward to sitting through
La Notte and L'Eclisse--again, for the first time
in years.

Try D.W. Griffith's Intolerance, if you can find a decent print of it.  It's the great film he made immediately after Birth of a Nation, which you can bury if it bothers you, as it should.  There is another good one called Orphans Of The Storm.  Still, while there's no denying the sinister impact of Birth of a Nation, not only are some of Griffith's films wonderful, they played an important role in the development of film narrative. Regards, Tom Savage

Tisa Bryant <tisab@EARTHLINK.NET> wrote:  I refrained from listing any more directors than I did!

I have also had a hard time accepting the cinematic genius of DW
Griffith because of the racist narrative he was putting forward using
it. Other people are able to make the needed separations in order to
see; to say he offends me isn't saying much. For me BIRTH OF A NATION
is a feature-length overlay in assaultive practices, and I've never
bothered to see anything else he's made because of it. But seeing DJ
Spooky's REBIRTH OF A NATION at a special screening in Providence
allowed me to see and understand his craft, in terms of what he,
technically, was doing with the camera and its cinematic, not national
narrative, effects, though we're still (not) reckoning with where the
twain did and still meet, on screens around the world. I finally
watched all three hours of it two years ago. I was still infuriated,
but then I was like, "Oh. That's an iris shot." Still, my response to
that as-yet-unspoken call to Griffith was the oft-unappreciated Oscar
Micheaux. I do, however, love Steve Erickson's novel invocation of
Griffith and cinema, DAYS BETWEEN STATIONS.

Though I've seen works from all the directors on your list of omissions
(except Ghatak and Sen, so I'm on the move), Chaplin, for instance,
isn't part of my body because I've spent scant time watching his films,
my four-year tenure at Modern Times Bookstore and left-leaning politics
notwithstanding. All the Buster Keaton I've seen in my life has been
during a meza plate lunch at Olive Tree on MacDougal & W. 3rd. Busby
Berkeley: I've seen "That's Entertainment" profiles on him, then the
obvious references to him in Matthew Barney's CREMASTER cycle. If
anything, I see for myself a need to revisit these works, since I may
simply be having some psycho-trigger issues around all American silent
films, thanks to Griffith. This gets conflated into what I see as the
aesthetic *scariness* of silent films: contrast, frames per second and
jerky motion, mouths moving with no sound, etc. Unintentional
eeriness. I saw NOSFERATU as a child at Camp Lapham when I was 8.
Keaton's makeup freaks me out. Then, in terms of the gaze, I can't
comfortably project myself into that (or the majority of cinematic)
landscape(s); it's not *my* neck that cranes back for a kiss from X
leading man, nor am I that man, though a project of my own version of
PURPLE ROSE OF CAIRO, for instance (what happens when a 1980s black
girl steps into a circa 1939 movie) could be very interesting. I do
love Julie Dash's short film, ILLUSIONS, for engaging in the old
movie/identity conversation with panache.

Pierre said something about Americans going for foreign films, and I
want to comment on that, briefly, and expand on the above, just to say
that I must, for continued mental health, allow myself cinematic
escapes from the American national narrative as its perpetuated in
film, because there are other possibilities for the
image-not-as-metaphor, not as racial or Other marker than the Griffith
legacy allows. Something about survival, subjectivity and perspective,
than simple swooning. We Americans are quite varied in that respect,
and, judging from what I've seen from Francophone African filmmakers
(and Vietnamese filmmakers, too, I believe), so are the French. Etc.

I do swoon over Lubitsch, though, and Cukor, Wilder, Hawks, Huston,
Sturges, Vidor. I especially like b/w films that have that
glitter-gloss, like THE SWEET SMELL OF SUCCESS, or BORN YESTERDAY. I
also love melodramatic films like Sirk's, and those of his ilk, and
enjoy the continuum as evidenced in Fassbinder and Todd Haynes, among
others. If the Brattle Theatre was film school for me, my mom was film
school K-12. Before AMC on cable, it was all about UHF on weekends for
old (30s, 40s, 50s) film. It's been a delight to spend time seeing
what the rest of the world was up to, cinematically, during those
times, dig the cross-pollination, especially during/after WWII. I
also loved/hated the Rock Hudson/Doris Day/Bobby Darin-esque romantic
romps. To be that carefree....

I was just working on this quote from Tarkovsky, in which he says that
people go to the cinema for time, time spent, not had or lost. For an
enhanced living experience.

So our lists, if we agree with Tarkovsky, are not ridiculous and to be
apologized for or silenced, but, yes, Aryanil, the beginnings of a much
bigger, deeper conversation.

Thanks for starting this!

back to work....

Allen has a new book of comic shorts out; I haven't read it yet (my husband
just checked it out of the library).  While I won't argue that he is a
brilliant story writer, I want to mention that the first footnote I saw in a
work of fiction was in a Woody Allen story. Aren't all footnotes out of
context essentially comic?  Eileen Tabios -- opinion?

Then he makes all his actors give out of context performances.  Hmm.

Sleeper is a great movie.  It completely revises the chase scene.

Shane is a great movie.  Is it a great Western?  Who cares.  They just redid
3:10 to Yuma with Russell Crowe.

P.S.  The album of the Italian folk whistlers who did all the whistling on
the Leone soundtracks is just wonderful.

To kick start some dastardly acts of poetry, National Poetry Week
invites
poets to hide their poems in public spaces and to submit clues to the
Director for publication on the National Poetry Week  website. You can
then
launch your poetry campaign to see if anyone can find your poems.

Best way to submit is to send to jfk@nationalpoetryweek.com with the

Since you (Tisa?) mention Alain Resnais, did you know he just made a marvelous new film called Coeur (in French) but relabeled here as Private Fears in Public Places?  It played at IFC in New York City for quite awhile.  I don't know where it is available now but it is definitely worth tracking down.

It's the great film he made immediately after Birth of a Nation, which you can bury if it bothers you, as it should. There is another good one called Orphans Of The Storm. Still, while there's no denying the sinister impact of Birth of a Nation, not only are some of Griffith's films wonderful, they played an important role in the development of film narrative.

I have also had a hard time accepting the cinematic genius of DW
Griffith because of the racist narrative he was putting forward using
it. Other people are able to make the needed separations in order to
see; to say he offends me isn't saying much. For me BIRTH OF A NATION
is a feature-length overlay in assaultive practices, and I've never
bothered to see anything else he's made because of it. But seeing DJ
Spooky's REBIRTH OF A NATION at a special screening in Providence
allowed me to see and understand his craft, in terms of what he,
technically, was doing with the camera and its cinematic, not national
narrative, effects, though we're still (not) reckoning with where the
twain did and still meet, on screens around the world. I finally
watched all three hours of it two years ago. I was still infuriated,
but then I was like, "Oh. That's an iris shot." Still, my response to
that as-yet-unspoken call to Griffith was the oft-unappreciated Oscar
Micheaux. I do, however, love Steve Erickson's novel invocation of
Griffith and cinema, DAYS BETWEEN STATIONS.

Though I've seen works from all the directors on your list of omissions
(except Ghatak and Sen, so I'm on the move), Chaplin, for instance,
isn't part of my body because I've spent scant time watching his films,
my four-year tenure at Modern Times Bookstore and left-leaning politics
notwithstanding. All the Buster Keaton I've seen in my life has been
during a meza plate lunch at Olive Tree on MacDougal & W. 3rd. Busby
Berkeley: I've seen "That's Entertainment" profiles on him, then the
obvious references to him in Matthew Barney's CREMASTER cycle. If
anything, I see for myself a need to revisit these works, since I may
simply be having some psycho-trigger issues around all American silent
films, thanks to Griffith. This gets conflated into what I see as the
aesthetic *scariness* of silent films: contrast, frames per second and
jerky motion, mouths moving with no sound, etc. Unintentional
eeriness. I saw NOSFERATU as a child at Camp Lapham when I was 8.
Keaton's makeup freaks me out. Then, in terms of the gaze, I can't
comfortably project myself into that (or the majority of cinematic)
landscape(s); it's not *my* neck that cranes back for a kiss from X
leading man, nor am I that man, though a project of my own version of
PURPLE ROSE OF CAIRO, for instance (what happens when a 1980s black
girl steps into a circa 1939 movie) could be very interesting. I do
love Julie Dash's short film, ILLUSIONS, for engaging in the old
movie/identity conversation with panache.

Pierre said something about Americans going for foreign films, and I
want to comment on that, briefly, and expand on the above, just to say
that I must, for continued mental health, allow myself cinematic
escapes from the American national narrative as its perpetuated in
film, because there are other possibilities for the
image-not-as-metaphor, not as racial or Other marker than the Griffith
legacy allows. Something about survival, subjectivity and perspective,
than simple swooning. We Americans are quite varied in that respect,
and, judging from what I've seen from Francophone African filmmakers
(and Vietnamese filmmakers, too, I believe), so are the French. Etc.

I do swoon over Lubitsch, though, and Cukor, Wilder, Hawks, Huston,
Sturges, Vidor. I especially like b/w films that have that
glitter-gloss, like THE SWEET SMELL OF SUCCESS, or BORN YESTERDAY. I
also love melodramatic films like Sirk's, and those of his ilk, and
enjoy the continuum as evidenced in Fassbinder and Todd Haynes, among
others. If the Brattle Theatre was film school for me, my mom was film
school K-12. Before AMC on cable, it was all about UHF on weekends for
old (30s, 40s, 50s) film. It's been a delight to spend time seeing
what the rest of the world was up to, cinematically, during those
times, dig the cross-pollination, especially during/after WWII. I
also loved/hated the Rock Hudson/Doris Day/Bobby Darin-esque romantic
romps. To be that carefree....

I was just working on this quote from Tarkovsky, in which he says that
people go to the cinema for time, time spent, not had or lost. For an
enhanced living experience.

So our lists, if we agree with Tarkovsky, are not ridiculous and to be
apologized for or silenced, but, yes, Aryanil, the beginnings of a much
bigger, deeper conversation.

Thanks for starting this!

back to work....

The best work i know re the swarm  the great study by Kristen Ross, The
Emergence of Social Space  Rimbaud and the Paris Commune.  Ross presents the
swarm across many manifestations and bodies, spaces, objects, ideologies of
daily life, and the ways in which the swarm constitutes Rimbaud's poetry as
an embodiment in action of the Commune. This is a really fantastic book and
I can't recommend it highly enough.
    And of course, re "identity splicing"--it is Rimbaud who writes "Je est
un autre"--"I is an other"  "I is somebody else"--
      In the Ross book, the swarm is that which is against the State, and in
many ways the State is a manifestation of autopoesis, if not, along with
corporations, its non plus ultra as THE autopoesis. (And as the blurring
between the corporations and the State makes way for their emergence as the
autopoesis of the corporate-State fascism currently occurring "before our
very eyes".)  ("Vice President Haliburton", "Secretary of Defense
Blackwater" "Secretary of the Interior Caterpillar" and so forth--)

      Re heteronyms and identity-splicing there is a great multiplicty of
ways in which this may occur.  One example is the Yasusada texts, in which
Yasusada notes that he wants to make a book "After Spicer"--which is
inspired by Spicer's "After Lorca" work.  In the Yasusada, as in the Spicer,
there are moments in the writing in which the identites merge--and it is
very difficult to distinguish if at all where Lorca ends and Spicer begins,
and where Spicer ends and Yasusada begins. And that is just one of the
multiplicities which perform identity-splicings in the two texts.
Ultimately, the activities of these "correspondances" (made literal by the
Letters to Lorca, Yasusada's Letter to Spicer)--a term Spicer uses which is
picked up by Yasusada--allow for a voyaging among "identities" "authorships"
in the Baudelairian sense of both "le Voyage" and "Les Correspondances".
Baudelaire's "voyage to the end of the unknown" would lead finally to an
unknown author--a kind of identity splicing in reverse--in which by a
continual splicing and resplicing of elements, the "single author" has
vanished, into the nameless--one/many--a dispersion into particles which
from and reform continually different swarms of "identity"--manifesting in
an endless series of texts "after"--
        The writing "after" makes room, space for this endless swarming
outwards proliferartion--"after' is productive of series, not as linear
procession, but as a rhizome--
I sometimes think of "after" as something the opposite of "post"--as "post"
is a vague posting of something occurring when that which preceded it is in
a sense dead--"post mortem"--it seems to be a rupture with the dead, ended,
preceding events, autopoesis, yet it carries within it the viruses which
inhabited the former "stage" of development.  In other words, what a "post"
constructs is a "post mortem effects"--which, having as its "center" a
corpse, "lying in state"--generates a "corpus" of work which is based on a
machinery of Death---a "killing off" as it were of all entities not subsumed
under its rubric of autopoesis. A "term limit" is set, an "event horizon"
which means the constructing of borders, walls--and necessitates a form of
censure or censoring activity, in order to maintain a "status quo" within a
hierarchical structuring of "the chain of commands" delivered from "top" to
bottom". The problem with this closed system is that after a certain point
it reaches the state at which entropy sets in--a steady State.
        Opposed to this, at leatst in this paltry formulation i amessaying,
opposed to his is the kind of swarming generated by the activity of
"after".  Rather than heading to a "steady State of entropical
finality"--the "after" swarms and moves onwo/ards, encapsulating ever more
"identities" and splicings of these which in turn produce further slicings,
a nomadic rhizomatic activity which proliferates "texts without authors",as
"authors" may be anonymous, or pseudonymous, splicings as in the Pessoa
cases.
      This activity has in fact a historical foundation, the examples being
found in travel literature of the 18th century, in which anonymity and
pseudonymity play a great role.  Indeed, an author will produce a text,
itself made up of plagiarized passages, exagerations, outright falsehoods at
times, and often enough these are included already in the pages plagiarized.
The text may appear under a 'real --legal--name" or a psuedonym.  It is
translated immediately into other langages as the rage for and need of
travel accounts is crucial to an "age of discovery"--voyages into the then
"unknown"--seeking for sometimes anactual place, others unkwoingly chasing
chimeras until they in turn "discover" where they are is a "nowhere".  The
translation, sometimes done by the "orgianl author", sometimes bya
bootlegger--is done ina more or less rough fasion--and thn translated again
into another language via another translator or the one of the
first--sometimes continuing with the original "name", sometimes under yet
another name, adopted to the society which is going to be reading th text.
         This rhizomatic swarming can also operate back into the original
language--texts that may be translated by the "original author" under
whatever name has been used, who becomes the translator--under another name,
of his own work into another language.  The translation having altered a
number of things--is then translated back into the first language, appearing
with a different title and a different author's name, as a "new book from
the French"as it were.  The identity splicing of this continual swarm of
different authors, different languages, translators and titles and shifts in
the text with each swarm into another language--another
unknown--proliferates the identity splicing as a continual play of
"differents"--who may in fact be one person in one body--yet is in print
many names producing two translators,and three texts in two languages.
These three texts in their turn become part of the immenese reserve, ever
proliferating, of travel books from which further "authors" in turn
plagiarize, alter, misquote deliberately or not--and on and  on and on this
goes, creating ever more 'voyages" by ever more "authors" who many of them
have never left their studies, their writing desks.
             (Out of this huge seething, teeming ocean of texts their
emerged at one end of the spectrum the novel.  Daniel Defoe, who produced
roughly two hundreds texts, many many authors, many years work of identity
splicings being carried out with great aplomb--finally reached the shores of
th novel with "the true account" of Robinson Crusoe.  The text in the novel
purports to a "true account" of actual events by a fictional author
(Robinson Crusoe)--much as the name Yasusada turns out to belong to a
fictional personage, pointing towards an "autho"r who has swarmed into this
being from elsewheres known or unknown or both together, a splicing of the
known and unknown into yet another "author" and "text".  And a text which
among many allusions and claims, imagines itself creating a text "after
Spicer's After Lorca" among many other texts which have disappeared in
transit, been left out by the "editor/s" and "translators"--a travel through
many identity  splicings traveling through the Orphic underworlds ,
emerging, and submerging again, a negentropic ever spiralling activity of
the swarming "names" of "identies/idenity splicings".
               These voyages into the unknowns of identity splicings,
others, "differents", has been "the story of my life". In various countries
at various times, the accusation of a forged or stolen pass port has been
made to me--that is, one is not who one's identity papers claim one is.
Sometimes this turns out to be a case of "mistaken identity"--which often
makes things more suspicious depending on whom one is thought to be.  More
often, it is a riddle which is well nigh unsolvable--if this person cannot
prove with official documents who they are-who are they?  If their documents
are stolen or forged--does one have any confidence that they will reveal a
"real identity"? Or a continual series of false claims, other identities,
further papers, documents, leading further afield or back, in a circle, to
the rebus without reference or signification  before one?
        To further complicate things, hand writing at the time of interest,
interrogation--often does not match that  which was made at the time of
signing.  Once in jail, three seperate finger printings produced no match
among them.  The identity via fingerprints changed from one imprinting to
another.
   So who is it makes the shadow that walks beside one?  Who is it that
looks back from the other side of the mirror through which Orpheus and
company travel into the underworld?
      All these swarming splicing identities traveling among "names" and
"locations' in texts, in space, in time--
         Dmitry Prigov, recently discussed on this list upon the sad
ocaission of his 'death" physically--created splicings of identities that
continue to proliferate--in fact, the Russian writer Mikhail Epstein has
posited the hypothesis that Prigov--and/or also another Russian writer,
Bitov- is the "real author" at the core of the Yasusada texts-because in
part each of these writers had intended to produce "Japanese" texts in
Russian--which never appeared in Russian--and  yet did appear in English, as
the Yasusada, transferred to the American poet Kent Johnson while he was
working on an anthology which included these writers and met with them
during a conference in Leningrad--, and carried by him to the "names of the
translators" listed in the Yasusada texts-- who proceed to translate the
never-to--appear Russian texts into an English which purports to be
translated from the Japanese.
            In my own case, I have even without being the author--produced
via the (some very creative) "mis/readings" of "authorities" of one's
"profile" literally as one's appearance, and also as one's "papers,
documents", fingerprints, produced several "identities" and "unknowns" which
swarm around and in and through me--in turn creating texts themselves of
varying identities of "authorship".  Yet "who" is "the one sole author" who
is "David Chirot"?  Apparently its for some authorities "unknown", "forged"
"stolen" a "complete mystery", "a spy", a "terrorist", an "associate of
outlawed group" and so forth.  The possibility of deportation exists--yes,
but to where?--as Baudelaire would say (title in English)--"Anywhere out of
this World"!
             Given the history of the travel literature and the forms of
proliferations, swarms, in Pessoa, Rimbaud, Yasusada-, Spicer--Epstein,
Prigov, Bitov, Johnson, a pseudonymous author said to be "the author" of
Yasusada--given the history and examples, one may be able to see the swarms
of identity splicings as ways of subverting the entropical State-Corporate
autopoesis.
          With the signing into Law today, the democrats having capitulated
yet again to the President, with the signing into Law of what had been
illegal wire tappings--one finds yet another attack as it were by the
autopoesis of a continually more centralized-in-the-office-of the-President
against the swarm of proliferating identities which essay the creation of
lines of flight which elude the steady State of Control.
             For poetry, for writing, the traveling swarm is one strategy to
resist and to create others, "differents" which elude the continual efforts
to make cultural efforts conform to various formations of the autopoesis
steady State.  In a time in which the crack down on identity is very
severe--profiling, "illegal aliens", "suspected terrorists"--"rendition
flights"--questions of torture, indefinite incarceration without
charges--the continual asking by faceless businesses for information in
order to apply for things which proliferate one'
s name on cards which can at any time be stolen--and yet you, the one whose
name appears, are taken to task and entered into the system also--by
association--you find yourself ocoked up as it were ahead of time--your
having been "already identified" and al that is needed if circumstances call
for it is a "crime" with which to "match" you.
           In such an environment the swarming of splicings of identity
indeed seem ever more a necessity, Indeed, when such things lead to actual
arrests, one has learned that one has entered a zone in which the challenge
to authority--is as much their creation as one's own.
     So without even intending it, one has produced yet another
"author"--who intends to "get to the bottom" of one's identity, one's text.
The "author" one has unwittingly provoked into action, is it a monster, a
Frankenstein--or an ally--a friend?  The very author one creates may in turn
erase one's identity--alter it, edit it, translate it--take "possesion"--or
one may be "possessed by it"--and in this swarming struggle among 'authors"
and "identities", "texts"--what is that will come "after"--"who's gonna come
for you/bad boys /bad boys, who's gonna come for you"--or, turning the swarm
on the flailing "author"--seeing it 'explode into thin air"--and become a
rain of particles--creating materials for further splicings . . .which
voyage in to ever more unknowns . . . unknown authors . . . producing
"texts" as signs from the places beyond formations, formulas, forms, beyond
the autopoesis realms until . . .
           On this day of Hiroshima--
            "Furthermore, when we speak the word "life,"  it must be
understood we are not referring to life as we know it from its surface of
fact, but to that fragile, fluctuating center which forms never reach.  And
if there is still one hellish, truly accursed thing in our time, it is our
artistic dallying with forms, instead of being like victims burnt at the
stake, signaling through the flames."

other key locations. The same program will be presented in Madrid in
April 2008 and in Berlin in June 2008.
Those three events will propose an international programming focusing on
new cinema, video and multimedia, gathering works of artists and
filmmakers acknowledged on the international scene along with young
artists and not much distributed filmmakers.

+ + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +
ANY INDIVIDUAL OR ORGANISATION CAN SUBMIT ONE OR SEVERAL PROPOSALS. THE
CALL FOR ENTRIES IS OPEN TO FILM, VIDEO AND MULTIMEDIA CYCLES, without
any restriction of length or genre. All submissions are free, without
any limitation of geographic origin.

+ + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +

The 'Rencontres Internationales' offer more than a simple presentation
of the works. They introduce an intercultural forum gathering various
guests from all over the world - artists and filmmakers, institutions
and emerging organisations - to testify of the vivacity of creation and
its distribution, but also of the artistic and cultural contexts that
often are experiencing deep changes. The festival reflects specificities
and crossings of art practices between new cinema and contemporary art,
explores media art practices and their critical purposes, and work out
this necessary time when points of view meet and are exchanged.
The festival aims at presenting those works to a broad audience, at
creating circulations between different art practices and between
different audiences, as well as creating new exchanges between artists,
filmmakers and professionals. The 'Rencontres Internationales
Paris/Berlin/Madrid', an event without competition, are supported by
French, German, Spanish and international cultural institutions.

PLEASE FEEL FREE TO SPREAD OUT THIS PIECE OF INFORMATION to creative
organizations, art networks, production companies, artists and
filmmakers you are in contact with.

Best wishes.

A person whose practice of the intellect is made public through
publication,
for example, in the NY Times op=ed pages, or French public radio, or

Thanks, Tom, and yes, I did see Private Fears in Public Places at IFC, =20=

and really loved it.  I'm glad he's still working with theatrical =20
staging in his films, and I was also intrigued by how smooth his =20
narrative line is.  I was ready to work harder, but was also just happy =20=

to feel charmed by it.   A kind of pathetic magicalism.  I loved the =20
color, and the transparencies of emotion, season, as well as secret =20
desire/pasts.  Lots of fun.  I wish I spoke better french, though.  =20
Something about the title of the film (in French) confused me.

I think my favorite films of his are Mon Oncle d'Amerique, Stavisky, =20
and Providence.  Well, Muriel, too.  And Night and Fog.  Okay.  I love =20=

all I've seen of his films.  I haven't seen Pas sur le Bouche yet, =20
though.  Gotta move it up in my queue.  It's buried.

I'll also check out Griffith's other films; thanks for the suggestions.

Best,

Moveable is proud to announce the release of Apikoros Sleuth Limited =20
Edition. This remarkable book has already won four major =20
international awards for design and typography, and has garnered rave =20=

reviews. Only 231 copies of this collector's edition were produced, =20
each individually numbered and signed by the author.

In the Review of Contemporary Fiction, Laird Hunt wrote: "If Dashiell =20=

Hammett had written the stream-of-consciousness detective novel he =20
once claimed he would like to, and that manuscript had been passed on =20=

to Edmond Jab=E8s for severe line editing, then stolen by early-career =20=

Samuel Beckett to be dosed with bursts of hot humor and jaunty =20
textures, then revisited by late-career Samuel Beckett for cooling =20
and quieting, then borrowed by the late poet Jackson Mac Low to =20
undergo various destabilizing textual operations, we might, if we =20
could lay our hands on the resultant hybrid wonder, have some sense =20
of the baffling, polymorphic territory limned in Robert Majzels=92s =20
stunning antinovel, Apikoros Sleuth."

Please visit http://www.apikorossleuth.com for more info and images.
Even if you are not likely to buy the book, I think you will enjoy =20
the website!

Thank you.

I would say a public intellectual is someone who is listened to by a wide audience beyond the institution or college in which most of them teach.  Henry Louis Gates would be a good example of one who has a currency about him.  Edward Said was another.  In France, of course the public intellectual is or was a widely honored tradition with the likes of Sartre, DeBeauvoir, and Derrida participating far beyond the classroom to which many of them were not even affiliated.

an interesting insect* recording


http://www.asondheim.org/cricket1.mp3
http://www.asondheim.org/cricket2.mp3

*might be amphibian but very doubtful

unlike most crickets, cicadas, grasshoppers, these sound continuously, on-
ly pausing with what seems like exhaustion. the sound is intensely direc-
tional; turn 90 degrees and it disappears, even though we were within a
few feet of the creature (which remained hidden in the bushes). now here
we are with the semblance of a neuron; there are threshold firings that
one might consider digital (sound on / sound off) but there's also a fine
structure that i assume goes well into the ultrasonics, conveying coded
information that's analogically based. this is similar to 'counting chirps
to determine temperature'; in this case, there are no chirp bursts and
whatever's going on is invisible - and perhaps invisible to the insect
that hears and responds, the insect that autonomically decodes and acts
accordingly.

again, any information you might have would be greatly appreciated. the
sounds were recorded at ground level (dangling mono microphone) early
night in aurora, colorado, early august.

Very interesting. Is it an airplane I hear as well?

Alan, a friend of mine here in Sweden has adopted the old Chinese
technique of keeping crickets, tuning them (with resin) and playing
music with them. He has around 500 in his apartment and it takes
about three hours a day only to feed them. He has made two CD records
with these small musicians, and he has also performed with them on
stage together with various improvising jazz musicians. I will pass
on this to him ...

Dear all-
I'm hoping that someone out there can help me identify the copyright
holder for audio recordings of Robert Creeley reading.  I am seeking
research copies from UC San Diego and Stanford, and neither of those
libraries have been able to identify the copyright holder yet so that I
can seek permission for said copies.  I know that New Directions is
holder for his print works but haven't heard back from their Permissions
Department on this query either.
Any help would be much appreciated,
Seth

good recording alan

the plane adds a lot
did u know that only the males "sing"

(Males form dense, loud acoustical choruses that females visit in
order to mate.)

and when they sing they expose themselves to potentitally deadly toxins
so it is a dodgy business

for mating ofc

as often is the case;)

I went to the cricketing recording site but there didn't seem to be any
mp3s available.

On another list, some folks thought the sounds were from tree frogs, but
the location makes that unlikely - the sounds originated near the ground
on dry barren soil, with a couple of shrubs and that's all...

Stairs and Us

I coupled an ancient homemade variometer or variocoupler with the loose
coupler (in series with the antenna. I reset the slider bar and repaired
the crack in the front coil support. I made a new slider contact out of a
smooth alligator clip. I attached a very think wire to the cat's whisker
tip to improve contact. I refiled the primary coil contacts. I repaired
the 1918 509W 1100 Wester Electric headset leads and placed cloth over the
rubberized ear pieces which seemed to be deteriorating. I reattached a
loose while on the variocoupler. I rewired the connections I made with the
alligator clips. I bypassed the internal secondary coil of the loose
coupler. I glued shims under the outer rail support for the secondary
coil. I set up a short 30 foot antenna in a garage. I attached a 15 foot
ground to a door frame. In the day I pick up 1090 and nothing else, at
night I pick up KOA and nothing else. They're on very different parts of
the AM band. I pick up a faint buzz but this is with or without the
crystal so I imagine it's nothing more than 60 hz inducing in the
vicinity. I think the signals will be stronger in New York - greater
humidity, more and closer stations, and a very long wire antenna and good
ground. I think I'm running this on no energy. I think I'm stealing
energy. I think it's there and free for you and me. I think I'm making a
secret. - http://www.asondheim.org/vario.jpg - While I am doing this, I
think again of the paradox - theoretically one can run upstairs faster
than down since there's only gravity, no foothold, down, and upstairs one
pushes off the stair surfaces for speed. Near a black hole I imagine the
two speeds would be more or less equal. In zero gravity, going down the
stairs would be at 0 kilometers / hour; there's nothing moving the body
one way or another. On the other hand, moving upstairs would still be
roughly at any speed; the obstacle, of course, the inertial mass of the
body and the 'foot force' at hand. I think, why is this? Why is it easier
to fall for someone downstairs, but there are limits based on the planet
the two of you are on - while running upstairs, fleeing the raptor - why,
there's no inherent limit except what the body imposes, against whatever
gravity happens to be around. (I think, downstairs, it's the pulsing of
the planet - upstairs, it's the pulsing of the speaking body, listening
planet, or speaking planet, listening body, always this dialog as one
approaches an indefinite absolute, the planet's masquerade.)

Seth - Don't know the answer, but maybe Steve Swallow does - I have 2
CD's of Creeley reading to Swallows's music. One is titled So There,
the other "Have We Told You All You'd Thought to Know."  Try him on
Google.

Could everyone please stop using Internet Explorer? Thanks!

I ask because, yet again, I've just spent literally HOURS cludging
together a wobbly tower of otherwise useless code in order to trick IE
into rendering web pages into a reasonable semblance of the way other,
standards compliant, browsers do with a tenth of the code.

If you are only viewing the web in IE, and you have any appreciation
for the subtleties of good design and elegant typography, you're
really missing out on a much richer experience.

Try one of these, please. Spend a day browsing with one of them, or
better yet, each of them.

http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/
http://www.apple.com/safari/ (yes it works on a PC now)
http://www.opera.com/

And think of it like driving a new car. OK, maybe the key is a
different shape, maybe the gas tank is on the other side, but the
doors actually LOCK, and it goes three times as fast on half the
fuel. And it's free. And any critical repairs happen faster.

You don't even have to uninstall your IE, go ahead, keep it on your
desktop "just in case". But I'm here to tell you that the only time
I've needed IE in the past 4 years has been when someone tells me a
page I've coded is broken and I need to spend a couple of hours fixing
what ain't broken.

</soapbox>

Dan

John Latta has an interesting entry re what Geoffrey Gatza calls "the recent
row at Lime Trees".

http://isola-di-rifiuti.blogspot.com

in response to Gatza's note and posting of Kent Johnson's response and 88
lined piece (I am interested in"  (a Grand Piano also has 88 keys . . . )

at:
http://www.blazevox.org/072-kj.htm

(Gatza's original note is below)

The issue of censorship on a personal blog within the contexts of a specific
community, depending on the reader, may or not be "a tempest in a teapot".

Censorship in many forms, under many guises, is being continually deployed
through out the media and the academic and cultural spheres.  The violence,
virulence and strong arm tactics used against Professors Finkelstein and
Berubee earlier this year, with very little outcry from any direction, are a
chilling example of how easily and how much the fear, hate and bullying
methods of the Fascist and Stalinist Thirties and McCarthyite Fifties have
been able to rush into American life after 9/11.  Now the "new" Congress has
rubber stamped into legality even more and more extreme illegal wire
tappings, surveillances, than had already been in routine operation.
Yesterday on Amy Goodwin-hosted Democracy Now, the British author,
journalist and film maker whose film The War on Democracy is just being
released in Britain, spoke of the censorship and distortions of the media,
as it becomes the purview of an ever tinier group of conglomerates, all of
them working ever closer with the governments of countries, with the known
dis-translation services such as Memri.

The more America fights for "democracy" and the "spread of democracy" and
all its attendant Freedoms--the more censorship, denial of election results,
bullying lobbies, blogos-fears, "suspected terrorists", "rendition flights",
there will be, along with more conformity in every way, from thought to
(non) action/activism, the arts, everything.  How "radically different" are
the "radical, innovative" from the "School of Q" poetries really,  at some
fundamental level? It sounds like another version of the "two party
system"--different parties, same system. One could essay name
substitutions--"Edgar Guest" for "Charles Bernstein" or a New Yorker short
story writer for "Ron Silliman"--with a little touch here and touch there
how much difference is there really?  Maybe a lot, maybe a little, but
rather than conforming to assumptions, which is a form of censorship in
itself, at least to question the huge assumptions trumpeted in heavy handed
sloganeerings.

Without a continual disbelief and questioning, everyone might as well be
called a member of the School of Q--and thus be prepared for the day of
Liberace-ation when, echoing President Hoover's famous dictum, that "the
Business of America is Business", George Bush, casting aside all earthly
fear, shall proclaim--"the Language of America is L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E"

Liberace after all as Grand Pianist, was the originator of these "Parole in
Liberace"
Is it any crazier than Der Arnold evolving "before our very eyes" from a
"mere body builder" to "Conan the Barbarian" to the high techness of "The
Terminator" and then into "Governor Schwarzenegger"???

"I can't believe it's not butter!"
Hold that thought, Fabio!

I did find a way to listen to the crickets, and believe it or not I
preferred your lonely cricket, Alan. I cannot remember how I got there, just
click around and there are several mp3s.

Ok, my literarily-informed friends, my son, Jack,  will be a high school
jr this year taking AP American Lit.  Given that doing well enough in the
course and on the AP test is considered the equivalent of passing a
college course on the subject I suppose we could consider this a possible
reading list for an Intro Am. Lit class.  The list is below:

If you have the time and inclination, I'd love to read your responses.

If you teach this course, I'd be curious to see your reading list.  Jack
would too.

We know what we think, but I don't want to bias your responses.

Adventures of Huckleberry Finn
The Awakening
Catcher in the Rye
The Crucible
The Great Gatsby
In Our Time
Intrepreter of Maladies
Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglas
Passing
The Scarlet Letter
Their Eyes Were Watching

I just asked the Poetry Center at the U of Arizona who holds the
copyright to all of their recorded readings (including Creeley in
2003), and I was told that the poet holds the copyright; or, in the
case of Creeley now, Penelope holds the copyright. I imagine that
would generally be true unless the poet has specifically given such
rights away.

Very interesting. Is it an airplane I hear as well?

Alan, a friend of mine here in Sweden has adopted the old Chinese
technique of keeping crickets, tuning them (with resin) and playing
music with them. He has around 500 in his apartment and it takes
about three hours a day only to feed them. He has made two CD records
with these small musicians, and he has also performed with them on
stage together with various improvising jazz musicians. I will pass
on this to him ...

re: comments/no comments on blogs, I recently enjoyed (and concurred
with) "Joel on Software"'s take:

http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2007/07/20.html

one small excerpt to encourage the trip (the Dave he mentions is Dave
Winer whose ideas about comments precede Joel's in the full piece):

"The important thing to notice here is that Dave does not see blog
comments as productive to the free exchange of ideas. They are a part
of the problem, not the solution. You don't have a right to post your
thoughts at the bottom of someone else's thoughts. That's not freedom
of expression, that's an infringement on *their* freedom of
expression. Get your own space, write compelling things, and if your
ideas are smart, they'll be linked to, and Google will notice, and
you'll move up in PageRank, and you'll have influence and your ideas
will have power."

and there's more where that came from at the link above.

Regards,
Dan

this is pretty much what we read in am lit in my crappy catholic high school
20 years ago; it has been my understanding that nowadays in better schools
and in advanced placement-type courses, students are expected to have read
catcher, huck finn, etc. in jr. high (6-9th grade), freeing them to read
faulkner & o'connor, whitman & dickinson jr year and to write themes on
themes, regions, culture, interrelation, or close readings of more complex
texts rather than book reports on relatively straight forward stories

beloved is usally on these lists

I have complete ignorance about what might be on the ap or clep tests for am
lit, tho

the people I went to college with had gone to good prep schools, and they'd
read, oh, existentialist novels, plays, and nonfiction in french by senior
year philo in lit; nothing I'm reading here -- except the products of the
harlem renaissance & lost generation taught well -- would prepare your son
for that type of (imagined in envy then and recalled now) course next year;
it just seems like it is going to be the crucible as a play to round things
out, not the crucible as a 50s miller play, you know?  their eyes as a novel
by am african american woman, not as anything else...

(my high school did soph honors/jr am lit, jr honors/sr brit lit, sr honors
philo in lit)

I have a shared sense of disappointment, I guess; at the time I was a demon
for a reading list and I went ahead and did read lots more of the authors we
were assigned on my own, because I aware that I was missing something
crucial I would need for a non-science major in a top tier college -- but of
course, reading Nine Stories isn't really the way to get it.

Not accurate, Sullivan. A blog's a personal space offer'd to the public.=20
Mine's always been that, and always with my e-mail address prominently=20
display'd. You want to comment, you write to me. Simple.

A blog with a comment box makes a somewhat different contract with the=20
public. If one offers a space for immediately-published (unmoderated)=20
comments--as Lime Tree did when I post'd my (now disappear'd)=20
remarks--one's public contract (in the comments box) is inevitably that of=
=20
open, democratic, free-wheeling exchange. It's an all or nothing=20
situation, open or closed (unless one is so completely contriving for=20
control that one moderates *each* comment *beforehand*--not the case=20
here). So, if one--say, Mohammad at Lime Tree--suddenly thinks "Kent=20
Johnson's cleverness here in my public comments box is making me look=20
bad," or "I hate that smart-alecky snip Latta" and petulantly removes *all=

trace* of comments in the box: that's a breach of public trust, in short,=
=20
censorship. Airbrushing out the record of an exchange which had been=20
enter'd into by the participants in good faith.

As for the Stalin comment? What that's just "inappropriate"!!! Aww yeah!=20
(One'd think a flarfy boy like you'd see that toot, as I hear they say in=

I don't know if I agree with this critique of censorship on webspace.  I
mean, a lot of time censorship is winnowing.  And winnowing is censorship.
A lot of times it is editing.  And editing is censorship.  A lot of
times censorship is translating.  Or bringing speech into text -- you know,
writing = censorship.

Also, having not been to many blogs recently, some display the comments, and
others link to them.  But really long comments like 88 lines about 88 women,
er, imaginery notes, well, the original idea of comments is that they be
short and dialogical.  Speech like.   Informal.  Perhaps the software should
allow one to limit their length, automatically create a collapsed section or
link to a long piece.

Latta, your attempt at righteous indignation is amusing, but misplaced. Per=
sonal blogs are never entirely open spaces;  for that matter,  neither are =
 online bulletin boards nor listservs. When the administrator of Lucipo, fo=
r instance, decided to change the list from national and open to regional a=
nd no-longer-Web-searchable, that was the owner's right. Just as it is your=
 right to decide against posting an e-mail to your blog. A blog is not a bo=
ok or magazine or newspaper, and it's a bit silly to expect anything on a b=
log to remain there, as though it were "in print," and even sillier to laun=
ch a campaign against someone simply because they've made a decision about =
what to include, or not.

My daughter took this class two years ago. I remember her reading
some of these works, maybe most of them, though I don't recall In Our
Time, Interpreter of Maladies, or Passing. She did read Moby Dick
(and intensely disliked it, mostly because she intensely disliked the
character of Ahab). Other included writers were Whitman & Dickinson.
She also read other works on her own, including novels by Edith
Wharton, and I think that was the year she wrote a paper on a Robert
Creeley poem. I thought she had a very good experience in the class.

Any reading list for a single class is a bit like an anthology, isn't
it? I mean, we would all wish some works removed & others included. I
wonder about the lack of poetry in the list below. But then even some
bookstores have a "literature" section and a separate "poetry"
section, as if poetry is not quite considered as literature. Very
odd. I would certainly like this list better if it included William
Carlos Williams, Ezra Pound, Langston Hughes, and any literature
after 1930 or so (though of course The Crucible is a more recent
work). This seems like a fairly safe list, and one designed to teach
continuing American themes.

I would worry more about the approaches to the works below than the
limitations of the list itself. It seems better than some lists I've
seen. Let's hope your son Jack has a very good teacher.

Gary:If you'll notice, in my post, I set those issues apart, in a paragraph=
 separate from what follows, noting these are issues for the persons concer=
ned with these events in re blogs and specific communities and their reader=
s to determine in whatever ways they will.    I did this because I didn't i=
n a comment to the blog in question, take sides, but hoped for a "diplomati=
c discussion" so that poets would listen to each other and try to understan=
d each others' points of view and reach an understanding without having to =
resort to strikes and post pre-emptive strikes and the like, before anythin=
g of this sort happened.  Sadly, the discussion stage was skipped and hence=
 the subsequent events.  But then, people have their reasons one often does=
n't know. I personally think the issue with blogs is much more complicated =
by issues personal and with the fields of interest of the specific blogs in=
 question--so that the blog, by "belonging" (while actually belonging to "b=
logger.com or some such outfit)--belonging to a blogger, makes of that pers=
on at once an inviting host and/or the host/bouncer.  Given it is poets inv=
olved, of course the words chosen, tones of the discussion, analogies and s=
o forth, create further blog appearances at the host blog and among a proli=
ferating group of blogs, creating poems, critical works, guidelines, and th=
e like--until the next such event.    It is an area of one might say "marke=
d ambiguity"--if one invites comments, where does one draw the line at leng=
th or language, personal invective or public humiliation--written rules and=
 unwritten rules--it's a not as yet very clearly  "determined" or "agreed u=
pon"  sphere of discourse, since human beings have a penchant, a hankering =
really, to test and push any envelope one is presented with and equally str=
ong tendency when really pushed to lower the boom.  That's why discussions =
of blog choices in action can become such a mess.           (Maybe "Fight C=
lub" blogs could be created, blasting gansta Rap and Elvis singing "If You'=
re Looking For trouble You've Come to the Right Place"--old school Celtic P=
oetry contests--hangouts for the dozens--)             You'll notice i comp=
letely  bracketed this blog issue from the really serious and dangerous exa=
mples of the censoring of Finkelstein and Berubee and the examples John Pil=
ger was speaking about on Democracy Now this morning.   Jewish Voices for P=
eace produces an email newsletter called Muzzle Watch that is very disturbi=
ng on things going on in the "free press" and media and academic world in t=
he United States.  The laws signed into being the other day are really frig=
htening.  So is the fact there is so little protest, comment, concern from =
citizens, let alone poets or "radical" poets, whom one would think would be=
 concerned by such things.  I think part of the lack of concern is in fact =
a sign of how heavily things are censored--very few people are really very =
aware of what is going on, and if they are, are trained for the most part t=
o think that what is happening "couldn't happen here", or--don't really see=
m to care.  Formalist Radicalism has been the norm for so long--the New Sen=
tence and Reagan's New Morning in American began about the same time-- it i=
s hard to get people to think that "activist poetry" etc is anything but "n=
ostalgia" or kind  of cool strangeness like Anarchist vegan kids into "ragi=
ng"--I mean who knows perhaps Marshmallow Flarf is more radical than figuri=
ng out some kind of action more direct to take to derail the giant Death Ma=
chine coming around the bend?  Go with the flow of the spam and all that--S=
ome Post Avant apres ski anyone?--If the president and Attorney general don=
't know what what is going on, why should we, eh?--        That's the resul=
t of the kinds of censorship Pilegr was talking about this morning, which i=
s made al the easier by the removal of "dissidents" like the Professors at =
DePaul.                Kevin:the post from Geoffrey Gatza was at poetics tw=

OK, it's a prose list. But still, no Poe, no Melville? At least The
Man of the Crowd and maybe Benito Sereno or Bartleby. I'd also want
to see On the Road and Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas on the list--I
taught them in a college intro to amlit course--but I understand why
they're absent.

Hello Jack
I teach high school English, sometimes Juniors,
usually seniors; this booklist is pretty standard. The
Crucible, The Scarlet Letter, Douglass and Hurston are
included in our list, as well as Puddin'head Wilson
instead of the Adventures of Huck, sometimes Night is
taught, sometimes Hiroshima, one year we used
Invisible Man. The Harlem Renaissance is a research
area and we access the slides available to local
teachers from the RISD musuem. (Just because a book is
not on the list doesn't mean the author/area is not
read.) Handouts, research, other resources will be
used.. Poe, "the graveyard poets", Emerson,
Thoreau..usually get thrown in too. The excerpts from
these texts are commonly used on the SAT'S ( a base
reality to ponder, yet a reality). Hopefully the
students will be expected to read the entire texts
too. This is actually an issue, kids don't read, they
are masters of the short cut.  This is American Lit,
high school, and a survey class..what are your
concerns? What are your thoughts?

How much will they write, get a chance to form their
own  *uestions? (sorry the "cue" key on my keyboard
doesn't work) Will their teacher read and correct
their work or is it all peer editing? Process,
rewriting, investment in their work; hopefully all
these things will be generated in the class.

Feel free to backchannel me.

Am currently working with others towards the formation of a self-sustaining writer's collective, where both technical support and access to resources are provided to Tibetan writers operating in Himachal Pradesh, India.

  I am interesting in communicating with those who would be willing to donate a single book towards the formation of a reference library - and we are looking for the kinds of print materials that most of us most probably would not consider rubbish bin filler.

  Please note that absolutely no money is being requested.

  As many of you know, I have been working in Himachal Pradesh for the past year or so - and that my activities and interests have taken me to nearly ever corner of the world. The poet Kathup Tsering, a close friend in exile just visited, and I am currently in Kolkata, will be the person in charge of providing center support to writers in the Dharamsala area looking for access to centers of organization and distribution.

  Email me back channel.

Charlie:

I agree with Charles. It's not the list that matters, it's the approach. I'd
be interested to hear what that is. I would hope that all classes, not just
AP classes, had a bit more contemporary prose, poetry, and drama. I know,
though, one is limited often to what's in the book room. Where I teach, we
only get book adoption monies every six years (book list change is glacial
as a result). One solution of course is to ask students to buy their own
books (you can't require that like one can in a college class), but that's
not possible for every student... Another solution is to pick up as many
used copies of a recent book and run book groups in the class. Contemporary
poetry's a lot easier to include especially with so much on the web and a
smartboard in the classroom...

Another limiting factor in book choice in a public school is censorship,
often parent-driven; only one f-bomb or sex scene can get a book or film
banned, e.g. The Perks of Being a Wallflower (which actually has many of
both) banned from a Milwaukee AP class a few years back.

In a perfect world, we wouldn't need book lists...

Best, Crag

Yeah, obviously everyone who has a blog has the right to run it as he or =
she sees fit. And everyone who owns a basketball has the right to stop =
the game, take the ball and go home. But this debate isn=92t about =
rights; it=92s about intellectual responsibility.

Someone (maybe Ron Silliman) said a while back that the comment sections =
of some blogs are closer to listservs. I think that=92s accurate, and =
that=92s why I think it=92s intellectually suspect (to put it mildly) to =
delete comments that aren=92t clearly offensive. Blog owners sometimes =
ban people from commenting, but if they do they sure as hell shouldn=92t =
delete comments from others who object to the ban, or retroactively =
scrub threads related to the ban.

Seems odd to me that some of the Flarf bloggers use such a heavy hand in =
their comment sections.=20

Latta, your attempt at righteous indignation is amusing, but misplaced. =
Personal blogs are never entirely open spaces;  for that matter,  =
neither are  online bulletin boards nor listservs. When the =
administrator of Lucipo, for instance, decided to change the list from =
national and open to regional and no-longer-Web-searchable, that was the =
owner's right. Just as it is your right to decide against posting an =
e-mail to your blog. A blog is not a book or magazine or newspaper, and =
it's a bit silly to expect anything on a blog to remain there, as though =
it were "in print," and even sillier to launch a campaign against =
someone simply because they've made a decision about what to include, or =
not.

"Stuck Between Stations," a song of the Hold Steady's most recent
album, deals with Berryman's fatal jump into the Mississippi, as does
a song on the brand new Okkervil River album, "The Stage Names." That
track is titled "John Allyn Smith Sails."

Don't know much about Okkervil River, but Craig Finn of the Hold
Steady is a damn good lyricist.

Not sure what AP refers to, but the book that turned me around the
most in high school lit was Autobiography of Malcolm X.  But its been
so long since I've read it, not sure it would make it thru the
censorship radar that Crag speaks of.

For three years, I lived in a town in the foothills of the Indian Himalayas called Dalhousie.  Six months of each year, I lived with Westerners and a wonderful community of Tibetan exiles (this was in the early 70's) including the now world-renowned Gyuto Tantric College/Choir.  I would be glad to send you a good book for the region.  Just give me your mailing address and I will do it by snail-mail, still the only way to send printed books, I believe.  Regards, Tom Savage

I first read all the more obscure novels of Herman Hesse in McCloud Ganj.  I
just threw or gave away CASES of books, but may still have some.

Any use for VHS or DVDs?  We've already packed ours, but maybe somebody else

Thinking more on this question, framing it as "intellectually suspect" is a
very good way of putting it. Thank you Mr Feind.

       The deleting in the present of an already approved and placed
comment, and its attendant comments by others, seems like an "instant
replay" method of "reconsidering the call"--some time later in the
game--when the comments have already taken on a life of their own at the
blog--and elsewhere.  To  delete then, and proceed to work backwards through
time and erase every trace of the persons involved--is to be employed at
Winston Smith's job in 1984--essentially the re-writing, re-visioning, of
history--a shared history, a social history, and in this case a literary
history since it involves poetry directly (a poem) and indirectly
(discussions of poetics prior to the poem and after--and discussions in the
past--).  Yes it is one's own blog--but one has allowed the comments to be
there, and made space for a social activity to occur involving others--those
social spaces no longer in a sense "belong to me"--because of the collective
work involved.
      Since the collective work is a shared history of several participants
as well as readers--who may want to return to the discussion at some
point--or a person trying to trace the development of an idea, a poem, the
dissonances among various theories and methods of writing--to erase it is a
way of suppressing knowledge that having been allowed there in the first
place, is trusted to be remaining there for later reference.  The deletions
are also a way of erasing and denying part of one's own life and work--to
deny one ever had an exchange or contact with certain persons and works--and
so suppress part of one's own history and identity, effectively "burying the
past" as much as possible--yet at the same time going on as though one were
the same person anyway.
         (And yet out there some where these messages, comments, replies,
poems, all saved and at some point in the future come back to haunt
one--cause one to commit perjury in denying their having happened-- and then
there being discovered copies to exist--)
         What if one began to be treated by others as actually missing these
gaps in one's life--or--treated as if  everything you deleted they have
never forgotten anything of in the tiniest detail and will endlessly remind
you of all of them?
         Allowing comments means one is entering the care taking of a
social, historical record--that particular shared space is no longer one's
own  to control in terms of eradicating writing "that is of Interest" to
paraphrase the title/subject of the poem and of the blog owner's initial
theme. If one starts deleting comments and then all comments by related
persons back through time, a historical record is being wiped off the map
so to speak, and a suppression of history is occurring.
            Taking a look at Lime Trees today, it states that it is the
owner's blog and he can do anything he wants with it, basically on a whim,
with or without a reason refusing or removing comments.  In that case, one
wonders who is going to want to respond--comment--participate--when a change
of mood from one moment to the next will, like Caligula's shifting fancies,
suddenly eradicate several persons from the face of the earth and further
action in history, neighborhoods from existence,whole libraries' worth of
certain kinds of poems or books, plays, novels  from use,  or other,
competing Gods from their pedestals.
             The suppression of debate, discussion, "dissidents" is part of
the Homeland Security Bunker and Wall mentality, in which fear of
difference, fear of "alternative energies", fear of critique leads not to
the "end" of the author, the narrative, history, but on the contrary, their
ever more fortified and solidified Monuments. More and more firmly
entrenched become a few chosen viewpoints, selected & approved writers,
networks, sites, methods, procedures, definitions, techniques as well as the
narratives of their origins, constructions, receptions, productions,
distributions and pedagogies.  The shaping of what becomes the Uber
Narrative of various schools and movements is posited on a systematic denial
of other alternatives, different and/or dissident "takes"--and so what can
be described as a whimsical deleting of things which don't please one
today--can just as easily be defined as a cover for a deliberate deleting of
anything which does not conform.
               Every time a poet or poets start being censored, deleted and
wiped out retrospectively not for being beyond the pale in some truly
hideous way--but on a "whim" or due to their view point not conforming--it
sends a message to others that this is indeed a perfectly fine thing to do.
Pretty soon certain poets or viewpoints will have a harder and harder time
of being heard--or--if heard, subjected to a baragae of attacks and backlash
of all manner of personal attacks, attacks on everything they have ever
stood for, out of  mere association and so on--A lot of the time it makes
one wonder if that poet isn't speaking 'truth to power" if they are causing
such an uproar.  At least one needs to be given a chance somehow to hear
others in order to understand why they are wrong, right?--Or why such a fool
and so forth--let them be heard.  But if not, then seems something is being
hidden. Not only s"seems"--something IS being hidden--
         In the present, it is  entirely possible for one to read and write
with great empathy for writers and writings that suffered such fates in the
past---or do now, in another society--subculture---and may still also be
participating in the present  in just such treatment of others close to
hand.

You are talking about the book 'Disappearances". I have told him this is the showcase of his talent on many occasions. He was discouraged at this book not selling. Within 10 years he had sold the screenplay for "New York Stories" and was living large.  "LuLu on the Bridge" wasn't far behind that.

The poems in Disappearances are concise and hard hitting.

Scribe

The name
never left his lips: he talked himself
into another body: he found his room again
in Babel.

It was written
a flower
falls from his eye
and blooms in a strangers mouth.
A swallow
rhymes with hunger
and cannot leave its egg.

He invents
the orpan in tatters,

he will hold
a small black flag
riddled with winter.

It is spring,
and below his window
he hears
a hundred white stones
turn to raging phlox.


He had a great deal of potential. I would love to see what he might be doing now with his verse.

That looks pretty similar to what I recall of my IB World literature class in the 11th grade.

I think it's interesting that Passing is on there as well as Their Eyes Were Watching God. Seems like over representation of the Harlem Renaissance, unless both books are intended to be part of a comparison study. My favorite comparison of that sort is Autobiography of an Ex-Colored Man with Black No More, so you might suggest those to your son if he does any independent study or takes a liking to Harlem Rennaisance literature. Passing also strikes me as a strange choice for a High School lit class as it's a very subtle novel.

Huck Finn and Gatsby are pretty standard fair at this point, although I very strongly believe that young readers of Gatsby should be told that they should read the book again in their twenties to see if the book is markedly different from their memory.

Also Scarlet Letter and the Crucible seem to be over burdening the poor new england colonists with excessive disapproving hindsight.

I also think Interpreter of Maladies is an odd contemporary choice and have visions of really horrible test questions about "asian american experience."

My girlfriend loves that book though.

Just so the boy gets some good healthy Kathy Acker, preferably a few titles
with lots of unhealthy f*cking and thoughts on why we're all whores from birth
 thanks to governments which make sure to make the struggle for survival, of
necessity, a whore's game...

compared to Acker, Salinger looks like Seinfeld....when will the future
catch up with the past in literature anyway?

What I think is particularly amusing about this thread is that it sounds as
if the AP course is actually trying to teach high schoolers American
Literature. I think it's about branding and advertising and labeling "rigor"
rather than really understanding American Letters. There's more than one AP
English course by the way -- my daughter just completed her junior year and
has taken one AP English (which included Bodega Dreams as a novel heavily
influenced by  The Great Gatsby) -- and is about to take her second AP
English course. There was no poetry at all last year and I'm not sure she'll
get any this year. She is reading Invisible Man this summer.

My two cents

I think of my blog as my living room -- my parlor, really.  If a
guest behaves rudely, I feel I have every right to make him leave.
If he later turns out to be spreading nasty rumors about me or trying
to defame me in some way, I don't think it's Stalinist of me to
excise his face from group photographs, cross his name out of my
journal, and spray air freshener on the spot he used to sit.

D.B. Chirot's metaphor of the comments field of a blog as a
historical record/ exercise of democracy is interesting (and
idealistic), but overblown -- and to my mind, it's inaccurate. A blog
is not some kind of  microcosm of the polis -- it's a private space
whose occupant sometimes invites collegiality, discussion, and
response; it may be wiser not to, but then it's also less fun.  (I
personally like to entertain, and practically live for repartee.)

On the other hand, I'm not much of a fan of abuse. My comments boxes
were being haunted (anonymously) for a while by someone who had done
something terrible to me many years before; he was leaving obnoxious
insults like so many toxic droppings. Not only did I ban him from
commenting on my blog, but I did in fact delete his comments from the
"historical record."

Now, the case under discussion here on Poetics may be less extreme,
but when Bill Freind says that "it's intellectually suspect (to put
it mildly) to delete comments that aren't clearly offensive"  --
could we not keep in mind that "clearly offensive" is entirely
subject to interpretation?  For example, the man who did "something
terrible" to me,  in my view, date-raped me; I'm sure he thought he
was just having a good time -- different interpretations of events,
there you have it. Blog-owners have a right to determine what does
and does not offend them.

D.B. Chirot says that blog comments are "a shared history, a social
history, and in this case a literary history since it involves poetry
directly" -- but is anything, and especially a blog comment, just
about poetry?  Aren't all speech acts driven by all kinds of
motivations including rage and power? Isn't there always an emotional
subtext a "neutral" reader may or may not get? It's specious to say
that any discussion about poetry is only ever about poetry.

We're throwing around metaphors here, and some just don't feel right
to me.  My blog is decidedly NOT a basketball game, a historical
record, or a social history.  It is a party -- MY party.  If Kasey
Mohammad wants to rid his blog of what he perceives of as a kind of
taint, he has every right to do so, without being compared to
CALIGULA or HOMELAND SECURITY.  Please!

If people feel that their comments are SO IMPORTANT that they should
not let them run the risk of disappearing or being disappeared, there
are two options:  1) start their own blogs! or 2) at the very least,
save their comments as documents "for the historical record."  And
please, just let people enjoy their parties. Everything is temporary
anyway.

Actually, I have my own complaint. Safari is the enemy of all poetry. It
truly is. There is, in the CSS "laws", a combination of commands that
should, I say should, be absolutely perfect for poetry.

Every single web browser that I've encountered (OK, I didn't try lynx)
handles the particular combination of environments correctly so as to
produce perfectly set poems.

Except Safari! It does not implement word wrap correctly in the
environment, meaning that poems with long lines have the breaks inserted
in the middle of a wor
d like that.

It is an outstanding disregard for standards, but only (as far as I can
tell) poets have pushed the correct buttons in the correct order to
trigger it.

This set us back at least two months with absent because basically I had
to overcome my depression, rip out masses of gorgeous CSS and start again.

In high school we read Hemingway & Charlotte Bronte; we had an  excellent
newspaper.  Besides this, I remember reading May Sarton's novel  about an old
folks' farmhouse, an alternative to nursing homes.  The  exact title I cannot
recall; it was something like That They Were or They Were  That Way.  The story,
though very quiet, affected me for a long  time.  The whole time I was in
college I imagined meeting friends who would  cooperatively save each other from
this disaster that had happened in late life  to people's grandparents:
people's grandparents were parked in these  unimaginative buildings with boring green
grass and without gardens (the  grandparents had grown gardens), with small
TVs and plastic chairs, without  cars, in nursing homes to whom they had turned
over their holdings; they were  put on drugs.  I carried that little novel in
me like a song, but people I  knew were not thinking of old age yet.  Before
they'd thought of turning  old, one or two had thought of pushing much younger
people to the side NOW, even  of putting them on drugs, of blocking access.
Sometimes I made friends  with people foreign in that sense that we didn't
appreciate each other.   Life-long writing friends were friends one met in the
writing schools and who  could read each other's work over time, who would offer
encouragement in living  as people who write.  These were good thoughts &
daydreams that started  with reading that novel by May Sarton.

The high school class was among the few -- creative writing workshop was  the
other likely place -- in which we read American writers.

I agree with George.  The trick to doing well on the test, at least the essay portion, is to pick one book and know it really, really well.   Canonical helps, but I picked Hesse's Siddhartha and scored a five, despite misspelling Hesse throughout my essay.  That, plus getting lots of practice in how to analyze bits and pieces of text, being able to accomplish weird tasks like matching random paragraphs to their corresponding literary periods, and otherwise having a broad knowledge of American lit -- whatever's in Norton's.  The contemporary is fun but it won't be on the test.

Other than your book(s) in plain sight,  there were no
hidden poems. I've been had! I was a foolish woman
checking between and behind all the B's. Did someone
steal your hidden gift to the curious?  I did check

away, away, away from the sun

away, away, away from the sun
as if it were something of the light to shun
the light, as if the light were something
beyond what weather might cause it to bring
further darkness, emanating rays
disappearing against the length and breadth of days
it was old kant who said beware of such phenomena
that broil up against the space of noumena
or rather there might be that arc of aristotle
just before it decays into so much silly prattle
so what are these rays but longing for the dark
light fleeing light, the world turned stark
and raving, mad and luminous, at a loss for light
along the highways of the mind, the byways of delight

A week or so ago, I posted to WOMPO re: blogging practice & (gasp)  theory
and got only one reply backchannel.  I had tried to find a blogging  list but
not found one, except one pertaining to academics & teaching.   This discussion
about blogging & comments boxes is interesting.  I  rarely think of comments
boxes; I should.  A few people posting  here said blogs are not books; they are
private parlors; they are repartee not  writing.  My blog really is more like
a book in progress, that readers can  watch in its accretion if they desire.
I love the form of it.   My parlor is my talking in my house -- who would
hear it?  In the house, I  give talks on personal life & on books I have read, on
figures.  I  do architectural dances.  At the blog, there are rarely
comments.  My visitors or readers, so many of them from  overseas, or writers I know
(?) just sail over.  I myself have placed  a comment or few.  I used to write
in my books: this is the spot that  impresses me about life; I was not very
"pencil," more "pen," but it was my  copy.  As a blog-goer, I get embarrassed
later when I have soapboxed  in comments.  It does go into the long onion life
of the internet, doesn't  it?  The thing to write as a comment is "brilliant."
I read  a brilliant entry at Texta called "Design Flaw," about humans and
communicating.

There's not much early American Lit--Bradstreet? Wheatley? Taylor? "Sinners
in the Hands of an Angry God"? Taylor:

O woe is me! Was ever Heart like mine?
A Sty of Filth, a Trough of Washing-Swill,
A Dunghill Pit, a Puddle of mere Slime,
A Nest of Vipers, Hive of Hornets-stings,
A Bag of Poyson, Civit-Box of Sins.

Was ever Heart like mine? So bad? black? vile?
Is any Divell blacker?

How much fun is that?

Anyone who wants to take a practice test, can give it a try:
For â€œEnglish Literatureâ€ (more accurately literature in English)
http://www.collegeboard.com/student/testing/ap/english_lit/samp.html?englit
for multiple choice (starts on page 49)
http://www.collegeboard.com/prod_downloads/ap/students/english/ap-english-0607.pdf

For â€œEnglish Languageâ€ (a â€œcompositionâ€ rather than a
â€œliteratureâ€ course/exam)
http://www.collegeboard.com/student/testing/ap/english_lang/samp.html?englang
for multiple choice (starts on page 12)

It's been some time since we've given you an update about the papertiger:
new world poetry #07 CDROM, slated for release, well, about now-ish.

For issue #07 we thought we'd try something new, or at least new for us: a
themed issue. Despite attracting a mountain of submissions addressing the
theme of 'the end of the world', it ended up, somewhat ironically, to be the
end of the world for our beloved poetry CDROM - at least for 2007.

Submissions of text poems were voluminous, but not of the quality we were
seeking. Multimedia works were few and far between, numbering only a
handful - and this despite extending our submission period.

Only recently, after much anguish and careful consideration, did we decide
against publishing the issue at this time. Quite simply, we'd rather pass on
the issue, instead of forcing out a CDROM that we really felt would
undermine all that we've worked to achieve over the past seven-and-a-bit
years.

We thank you for your submission and support; apologise for the delayed
response, and for any inconvenience it may have caused you.

Please note that this is not the final end of papertiger: new world poetry -
not by any means. We're currently licking our wounds, but we'll be back!

In the meantime, you may like to consider submitting poems to our ezine,
hutt  -www.papertigermedia.com/hutt/.

Once again, thanks for your support.



The Editors.

Although this may be true at many schools, I teach 10
weeks of Indigineous Literature and culture in 12th
grade so students are  exposed to it within their 4
years. I should add that I get a lot of crap for it
too..from admin and other teachers. Prison Writings,
Shaking the Pumpkin, environmental essays from Orion,
etc.

geez, i can't believe you've got me thinking abt my english AP
test...from 1972! i wrote about andre gide. not an english book. but i
got a 5 too (can't believe i remember this) but ended up going to
hampshire college where it didn't make any difference.  oh, no, wait a
minute, that was for my french AP. i've forgotten the english one...but
then i learned that my dad, back in the 1930s, wrote about Pierre Louÿs
for his AP or equivalent thingie.  so he had guts.  what next, are we
going to compare SAT scores?

Canonical helps, but I picked Hesse's Siddhartha and scored a five, despite misspelling Hesse throughout my essay.  That, plus getting lots of practice in how to analyze bits and pieces of text, being able to accomplish weird tasks like matching random paragraphs to their corresponding literary periods, and otherwise having a broad knowledge of American lit -- whatever's in Norton's.  The contemporary is fun but it won't be on the test.

You'd rather he was compared to a violently repressive
Islamic regime? Give me a break.
The comparisons are certainly hyperbolic -- Homeland
Security, etc, etc, but remember that people respond
by implicitly comparing Kent Johnson to a truly
"toxic" blogstalker and...a rapist. I'm not going to
discuss the relative merits of the apparently
contentious personages involved: my point is that the
rhetoric has clearly spun out of control.
My opinion is that the Lime Tree guy, one way or the
other, acted like a Real Jerk. That's the real issue,
as far as I'm concerned, and not differing conceptions
of blogs as public or private. It's about etiquette,
really: the outburst against Kent was inappropriate
and very rude; if there was a problem, it would have
been better addressed "backchannel", off the
blogwaves!
If there's one thing I've learned about electronic
communications in the last few years, it's never to
write while angry. It only worsens matters, and one
ends up making blunders like the Lime Tree guy's.
About the AP list, I very much agree with Maria Damon,
and lament the absence of Melville. But I also didn't

Melville at age 17, and based on discussions with
others, I'm inclined to believe that's a common
problem. But it depends on how you teach it, too....

I get the posts delivered to me by the once-daily method so I just this
(Friday) morning had the pleasure of reading your responses re: the
reading list, AP tests, Am Lit etc.  Thanks so much and also  thanks to
the folks who wrote me directly off-list.

Most astonishing thing I learned--people sometimes teach a course called
American literature and omit poetry.

Specific book recommendations were interesting and appreciated.

Other common omissions seem to be Native Americans (I'd give them
something by Alexie) and I don't see anything like new journalism/gonzo
journalism mentioned...Fear and loathing of some sort would probably be
good.

The main thought that arose in my mind when I first thought about the list
is: what exactly should this course take as its focus?

Should it be "important" works of American Lit?

Should it be "culture-defining" works of American Lit?

Should it be "genre advancing" works of American Lit?

Should it be works by Americans that are distinctly different from the
work of authors who are NOT American?

Should it be "history" of American lit?

Those questions interest me and no doubt interest many of you but I
suppose they are irrelevant within the formal structure of Advance
Placement courses and tests

Anyway, thanks again.

Charlie

P.S.
This is written with apologies to Canadian friends for the conventional
terminology--of course it's really U.S. Lit. we're talking about, we're
just not precise enough in that regard with our language usage down here.
If it were really American Lit I'd have everyone read a little Margaret
Atwood and Alden Nolan.

1) a) I am reminded of a time, a very long time ago, when for whatever
reason, a friend of mine, a poet, a librarian, a web developer, found that
he had an ideosyncratic collection of wet wipes (seeing this on his site I
sent him some I had collected in casinos in vegas -- that money is dirty!),
and made a web site.  he then had an increasingly venomous and competitive
correspondance with a wet wipe collector who took his own collection and web
site very seriously.  as this became a time suck, my friend deleted his
site.

b) this is related to the pattern which led Kent and Henry and a few others
to be ejected from this listserv (and others)

2) a lot of poets I know have had occasion to delete their blogs and sites
or portions thereof; employers have started searching them, for example.  I
myself have been asked to delete certain of my posts and certain comments
from my blog, even last night.   I comply, as I do when people complain
about me writing about subjects they revere or idealize so much they cannot
broach.  A lot of people would rather be correct or silent.  And they would
prefer that other people stop being outspoken and wrong.

Catherine and all,

I've actually gotten multiple calls from the same creditor that basically
went like this:

 "How can't you pay this debt, you own your own business."
"What are you talking about," I asked them.
"Boog City. You put out a newspaper, you put on all these events. Here's one
with Kurt Cobain."
"I don't make any money from any of it."
"What are you talking about, that doesn't make sense."
"Well, I can introduce you to hundreds of other people who are doing the
same thing."

"You have all these websites, who put them up, who's doing the upkeep?"
"They're called blogs, and if you give me five minutes I can teach you how
to put your own up."
"How about I teach you how to pay your debt?"

if poetry, more women, interestingly--dickinson, stein, HD, rich, rukeyser,
levertov, some contemporaries like LangPo, jorie g. etc.
the idea of context shd always be taught, in my opinion, & what is
considering great in various contexts & why, & how lit points to that
context & what it does with it.

All,
I was just very reasonably taken to task by a member
of the list regarding my previous post, for which I
feel somewhat embarrassed, so I'd like to set the
record straight, especially in regard to Kasey
Mohammed, with whom I'm not personally acquainted:
consequently, I intended to judge his behavior in this
particular instance, and not the character of the man
himself. I offer him my apologies for the
inappropriate vitriol, and to the list as well, for my
excessive rhetoric!
Sheepish and tout contrit,
Alex

George,

are you saying that Ulysses is an "Irish" book? I beg to differ. Joyce was =
an American acting as an Irishman when the shit hit the Sin Fein. Joyce's r=
eal name (which no one but my family knows) was Bob Silverberg, a New Yorke=
r who had a very influential steel business, and he wrote a book called "Wh=
en Atlas Shrugged", but had to change all the names, dates and action to fi=
t the Irish attitude he adopted when he became embroiled with the pre-IRA d=
eal. This would be a great AP course - I learned these facts from my father=
, Carmine Casamassima, who taught AP American Literature in Bari, Italy. He=
 was also from China.

My wife Jean Baird is working on a project that concerns Canadian
literature in Canadian highschools. She is interested in this exchange,
and has some questions.
Could someone tell us what a "foundations course" is?

an artist named abner preis, apparently an american living here in

met Abner, and clicked through, clicked around, and found some interesting
commentary on war mongering =AD childishly scrawled letters with compellingly
coloured childrens drawing of jackboots and m16=B9s in iraq (i think).

here are a few of the verses;

Dear Becky,=20
People are so poor here.

anyway, i find this type of social commentary interesting =AD a reminder,
constantly necessary, that it=B9s not normal to kill people in other
countries, on the contrary. I was living in america when they started
invading countries about 5 years ago and ended up leaving, found it all so
disheartening. Feel kind of cowardice about it, actually, just leaving.

Anyway, this sort of art is strangely heartening.

Aha. You think I don't know all that stuff?
When I was a kid in school the Martino boys' parents were from Bari.
In 1985 I drove through the outskirts of Bari. They weren't much.
And I have read Henry James, eh?

Hello, All.

A few years ago my wife Jean Baird did a 90pp report for the Canada
Council,
the subject being the relationship between Canadian literature and high
school
syllabi across canada. Now she has acquired a grant for an outfit here
in Vancouver,
and is working on a project to improve the incidence of CanLit in our
schools. (Almost
every school kid in Canada reads To Kill a Mockingbird, for example,
instead of a
Canadian book. Jean has been studying the situation in Canada and in
Australia,
and has some search engines out there gathering references. So she came
across
this thread. She has asked me to ask you some questions about the AP
American Lit
course. For example:

Is it a mandatory course?

What grade level? It sounds as if it would be for final year of high
school.

Is it national, or is it tailored state by state? And does it exist in
all states?

Thanks.

George Bowering,

   A very busy day--my apt mate learned his mother in Mississippi had a
heart attack and had to pack in a hurry and hit the highway with a heavy
heart, then there was an exciting shooting, and a bit after the ice cream
truck arrived, right on schedule. The exultant cries of children mingled
with the clickety clack of crack hos' heels as the impassive dope dealers'
various "eyes" stayed on the lookout . . .
     Turning to poetics and all the talk of parlors, living rooms and
etiquette, is a very welcome and soothing experience after so much turmoil.
      As Robert Musil writes, quoting from his own Diaries as an epigram for
his little essay "Art Anniversary", : "It is easier to predict what the
world will be doing a hundred years from now, than how it will write. Why?
The entire answer isn't fit for a dinner table conversation."

        I think a problem with my letter which has caused some criticisms is
due to on the one hand poor readings of it.  and on the other poor writing
on my part,  in that what was meant to be humorous exagerration satirizing
the kind of overblown rhetorics that had been already expended in this
discussion at the time.  If you read what I wrote carefully, it does NOT say
Kasey is a Caligula, and it does NOT equate him with Homeland Security.  It
says that if tKasey's blog can be changed any time on a whim, a
hypothetical  reader might fancy the blog owner as a Caligula, wiping out
all sorts of things with the wave of the delete button finger.  The basic
idea is that a reader might be frightened from venturing a comment, if they
think at any moment it may vanish.  The Homeland Security reference is that
the mentality the society has these days of having to control at any cost
borders etc seems to be so pervasive as to be found among poets' blogs.  I
think if you read carefully you will see I do not say Kasey=Caligula nor
that he equals Homeland Security.  I'm making use of exagerrated imagery in
both cases to show how the imagination may be carried away by the instances
of what is happening. That I didn't succeed very well means I have to do a
lot of work with making the lines clearer between humor and what is misread
as "fact" or as my intentions..

     Mr Sullivan writes very self-righteously about etiquette and "getting
facts straight"--yet he didn't read my words very carefully and also as for
etiquette I am surprised no one has found his race-baiting comments anything
but deeply offensive.  Are people cowed by his tone and so let it go by?
Apparently. Or perhaps it is etiquette not to say anything, who knows. "Not
good form, you know." At any rate, the Leader for the Quest in Righteousness
and Rightness of Facts did not check his.

I'm a mixed Caucasian-Ojibwe Indian and my first wife is a Mohawk.  I have
one of the only blogs there is from the USA which has presented cultural
works from Palestine, Lebanon, Iran including grafitti and stencils and
support the End the Occupation movement, Jewish Voices for Peace and other
organizations' events and communiques, alongside visual poetry, poetry, art
works from around the world, and an over year long series of works to do
with (illegal) Walls, including the Israeli, the American one in Baghdad and
the American one with Mexico,  in many different ways.  There are continual
announcements of events, exhibtions, Calls, conferences, performances and
images, music, poetry from around the world, in English, Spanish, Portuguese
and French primarily.  Free Jazz clips and the Francophone Gene Vincent
Society are there, the visual/poetry collabs of Kenward Elmslie & Joe
Brainard, Bern Porter & Takahashi Shinkichi on Hiroshima etc etc The
Disappeareds show from the El Museo de la Barrio in NYC, the works of
Clemente Padin, Roberto Bolano, with many clips----and lot of Mail Art and
Visual Poetry last year for an International Call "For Lebanon, For
Palestine  Human Rights Peace Liberty" curated at the blog. Lettrisme, the
Urban  Painting of the Congo, various forms and makers of Outsider Art,
collagists, copier artists, grafitti, writings on the "art of looking" and
things hidden in plain site/sight/cite. There are also many American visual
poets and independent poets, some small press and journals, as well as  from
UK and Canada represented and much more will be.  (Behind on putting things
up as so much--more to do-especially with these latter.)

       I don't really expect anyone to know any of this as is off the beaten
track from the worlds more familiar found here.  However, since Mr Sullivan
insists on the facts, facts, facts here, I wanted to show he checked on
nothing at all before making his most unetiquettely race-baiting remarks.  I
think he owes both Kasey and myself an apology.

        For myself, I find it important to think on these issues with the
framework of the direction of the society, the State.  This does NOT mean
equating such and such an event or person with Homeland Security or El
Diablo Bush,what it does mean is, again I speak for myself, to essay being
aware of and working towards an understanding of the methods and mechanisms
of what happens, how it happens, to whom it happens. The basic issue is
POWER and its sidekick CONTROL--who has it, who wants it, what they do with
it, and to whom do they do it to.
          The first Terror was not of the "terrorists", but of the State.
In the writing of the Jacobins especially, the State is to be maintained by
a twinned force:  TERROR and PURITY.

         By whose standards of etiquette is it determined what and who is
PURE enough to be permitted?

         As Robert Musil wrote:  "The entire answer isn't fit for a dinner
table conversation."

         As an Anarkeyologist, one must continue to develop awareness of
that which is hidden in plain site/sight/cite----"Poetry no longer imposes
itself, it exposes itself" --Paul Celan.

              One might say that indeed, much is exposed--and to counter
this, there is always that which demands the return of the Power and the
Glory of Control and its Beloved Purity, its Terror.  The imposition of a
poetry, THIS poetry, rather than poetry exposing itself--and being found by
many, many, many--
                  isn't that one of the many questions here--

Sorry I hit the delete button instead of the reply button.=0A =0AAs I view =
it a "foundations course," or survey course, is a college level, or equival=
ent, course that attempts to present a broad survey of historically importa=
nt and/or influential texts in such a way that the student is prepared to p=
ursue further, more specialized, study in the subject area having been prov=

the more specialized topic as an aspect of the overall topic.=0A =0AFor exa=
mple Huck Finn is read in a foundations course so that later exposure to te=
xts such as "Beloved," "Invisible Man," "Blood Meridian," and/or "Tripmaste=

 upon whether or not there may be issues of influence by or dialog with the=
 earlier text. =0A=0AWil Hallgren

     The Floor of Heaven

     by John Tranter

ISBN            9780975698001

Release Date:  July 1st, 2007         AUD$26.95

A real-estate shark, a Vietnam veteran who can't forget, an Australian artist fighting drugs and despair in New York... In these four interlinked tales, these vividly drawn characters and their friends, lovers and enemies reinvent themselves as they search for love against a background of passion, ambition, risk, betrayal and death.

PRAISE FOR THE FLOOR OF HEAVEN

"A rattling good read..." JOHN ASHBERY

"The Floor of Heaven is a tour de force, a devious and profoundly subversive conjuring trick by a poet writing at the peak or his powers... the book pulses with a curious resonance... reminded me irresistibly of the best moments in Twin Peaks ... a strange lyricism." ANDREW RIEMER, Sydney Morning Herald

"Stories that are elegantly linked not only by some of the characters but by images and signatures... the swish of tyres in the rain, the hint of perfume ... A hypnotic read."
CARMEL BIRD, Australian Book Review

Folks:

b/channel if you know where I can find/buy Kamau Brathwaite reading "Stone"
and/or "How Europe Underdeveloped Africa" (both found in World Beat, the
excellently edited by Eliot Weinberger anthology of international poetry,
New Directions 2006, a book I hope to adopt for a World Lit course...). I
would prefer mp3 or cd formats. Leonard Schwartz' "Cross-Cultural Poetics"
on PENNSound has a Brathwaite program, but I haven't listened to all of it
yet...

This call is for a curated section on performance that
will appear in the journal How2 -
http://www.asu.edu/pipercwcenter/how2journal.

If you have any new work (previously unpublished)
please do send it along, this includes poetry and
critical writing.

Contact:
Elizabeth-Jane Burnett and Sophie Robinson,
Royal Holloway, University of London.
ejlburnett@yahoo.co.uk
sophie_amelia_robinson@yahoo.co.uk

Deadline:
September 1st 2007.

We are looking for papers, interviews, reviews and new
writing that relate to issues of poetry and
performance. We invite papers that focus on a range of
approaches to poetry and performance, including the
relationships between live art / performance and
poetics and what has been termed in the UK,
Performance Writing.

We would like our contributors to consider some aspect
of performance poetry or poetry in performance in
relation to contexts of collaboration, networks and
communities, and / or, its crossover into digital
writing and new media. We are also particularly
interested in the concept of a "poetic economy", which
examines the way that gift cultures can be suggestive
of possibilities for developing poetic networks.

Poetry's oral tradition is finding new relevance
within this type of economy and we welcome submissions
that address the recent development of poetic
practices that focus on the spoken word such as those
supported by a range of venues including; Naropa
University and the Bowery Poetry Club. We are also
interested in poetry's
relationship to live-art, music, sound poetry, and
performance in new media.

Submissions:
Please send your work as a Word document with the
suffix .doc to preserve formatting (not in the body of
an email).  The standard fonts for How2 are Georgia
and Times New Roman; submissions should be in 12 pt
and 1.5 or double-spaced.  Please include How2 in the
subject line of your email.  CLEARLY LABEL each
submission with your name and email address.

Visuals should be submitted in any of the following
formats:
Jpeg (.jpg, .jpeg)
TIFF (.tif, .tiff)
GIF (.gif)
PNG (.png)
BMP (.bmp)

If your submission contains graphics which are
intended for printing and must be high-definition,
please submit them in AT LEAST 300dpi. If they are
only intended for display on screen, 72dpi will
suffice, so please choose your resolution according to
need. Images should be no larger than 15 x 10 cm, and
must take into account file size (in kb). Please do
not send us larger files without consulting us first.

The Overlook Press has recently published Auster's Collected Poems. "Disappearances" is included in the collection. My favorite piece was the long prose poem "White Spaces."
  I'm new to Auster's poetry. He's written about other poets with considerable erudition.
  It was a revelation and a pleasure to read his poetry. I'm disappointed that my post didn't generate more responses. I guess very few people think of Auster as a poet, or perhaps because he's a commercial success, he isn't taken very seriously in some circles. Who knows? I loved the book. I'm glad there are other people who've read his poetry.

  You are talking about the book 'Disappearances". I have told him this is the showcase of his talent on many occasions. He was discouraged at this book not selling. Within 10 years he had sold the screenplay for "New York Stories" and was living large. "LuLu on the Bridge" wasn't far behind that.

The poems in Disappearances are concise and hard hitting.

Scribe

The name
never left his lips: he talked himself
into another body: he found his room again
in Babel.

It was written
a flower
falls from his eye
and blooms in a strangers mouth.
A swallow
rhymes with hunger
and cannot leave its egg.

He invents
the orpan in tatters,

he will hold
a small black flag
riddled with winter.

It is spring,
and below his window
he hears
a hundred white stones
turn to raging phlox.


He had a great deal of potential. I would love to see what he might be doing now with his verse.

Subject:      that's really interesting
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII; format=flowed

that's really interesting

it's always a wonder, what's really interesting, and whether interest, in-
terest-in, is a reasonable category of philosophical discourse. philosoph-
ical writing often appears scholastic, dry, abstract; it seems to contain
the semblance of power, that is argument for production's sake, production
for motive's sake, motives for lifeworld's sake. the latter is crucial -
that one inhabits one's work, replies, missions, admissions - exists with-
in the life of worlds, structures accordingly. but is that of interest
elsewhere, and what constitutes interest - there are two ways to think of
'having an interest in' - one, fascination with discourse on a particular
subject - two, an interest in the sense of economic or other interest ab-
stractly controlled by a steering mechanism, habitus of power, and so
forth. i have a conversation recorded w/ david antin perhaps 30 years ago
we were discussing astrology and about what was of interest and what was
not and what sort of steering mechanisms or correlations there were and
how they connected to the universe and i remember beyond or before the
tape david saying that even if astrology were true it's not of much inter-
est and i could only agree since personality and mute matter correlations
mean relatively little and prove nothing in the long run, at first i was
going to quote from the tape we made but then this particular section of
interest was elsewhere, outside the thing itself so to speak. {} truth is
never interesting; if truth were interesting then it would not be the flat
greyness of existence. then it would be corrupted into landscape, furn-
ished with ridges, serrated edges, graspable, something fallen into lang-
uage - i have often said nothing could be farther from the truth. then and
there interesting philosophy embraces evil, abjection, obscenity; it rides
these, dis/comforts these, dis-inhabits the abstract, something's at stake
- what remains elsewhere is physics, let's hear and see it for physics.
"find the david antin text and what david antin says about things being
interesting also try to talk about the notion of truth as being inherently
neutral and not of interest because there's no error which allows distance
and through that reflection and opening up possibilities connected with
the lurid and abjection and perhaps one of the reasons systemic philosophy
went out of favor in the twentieth century was because of the amazing
amount of interesting information exploding everywhere and all of it veer-
ing in interesting directions, not those of axiomatic conclusions, but
those of interesting conversations always continuing. the more the world
becomes (seems to become) more interesting, the more systems are retired,
those systems which are steering mechanisms and not dialogs, even bell's
theorem on the other hand is a dialog of sorts." crystal radios, constant
chirping, western grebes, are interesting, tantra is very interesting and
full of sights, sounds, tastes, touches, smells, extremely interesting and
its truth is that of the back of the human being world-consorting, every
thinking of the motive and intention of thinking. and curvature, curves,
mathesis of every sort, is always of interest, the thinnest of beams
enabling nothing, holding up even less. {} now crystal radio is interest-
ing because it's driving high-impedance earphones and it makes me wonder
of course why the same electromagnetic waves couldn't be harnessed to
charge lithium batteries, run low-power computers, etc. i've often thought
of living in pre-transmitter times, turning on a radio - of course there'd
be static and atmospherics, but i think, am almost certain, there would be
something else. i am the last person on earth to await the carboniferous.
{} if philosophy could be presented in an interesting manner, what then?
would philosophy then be of interest? i'm thinking of nietzsche, kierke-
gaard, but also of witold gombrowicz, a guide to philosophy in six hours
and fifteen minutes. now the text is fascinating but i wonder if terms
such as consciousness, object, subject, being, existence, nothingness,
reduction, etc. couldn't be considered placemarkers for other terms such
as anhinga, tibet, arlington coupler, hohner victoria harmonica, vegan
sushi, and so forth? in which case the discourse might well be more inter-
esting - and what is the substrate of the original terminology, what holds
it both to a more philosophical habitus and to a re/configuration of the
world and what the world holds? texts are of course texts of substitution,
deferral, differance, narration, holding language much as the phaistos
disk holds language. and the phaistos disk is interesting perhaps because
it remains mute, presenting us with a diacritique of language itself. {}

Subject:      on hearing of the American soldiers refusing to return to America
              after Iraq
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1

I'm still haunted by hearing conscientious objector Agustin Aguayo and his
wife Helga speak in Philadelphia a few nights ago.

They told us horrifying stories of what happened to their lives after
Agustin realized he couldn't withstand the daily brutality of life as a
soldier in Iraq.

Something Agustin briefly mentioned was that he had met American soldiers in
Germany who refuse to return to the states.  During the Q&A I asked him to
elaborate on that statement.  It turns out there are soldiers (and
apparently there is a growing number of such soldiers doing this) who,
after finishing their tour of duties in Iraq, go home to the states, only to
be confronted with the world we have going on here.  Meaning a world of
denial.  A world so selfish, so nihilistic that we would DARE, as tax
payers, fund the chaos, brutality, and murder that is in the lives of anyone
living in Iraq these days, yet continue life as we always do.  These
soldiers (mostly men it seems) lose it, literally lose it when back in the
states, in restaurants, in shopping malls, and start screaming at people
about the war that is going on.  Our endless American war.  And they simply
can't take it, these soldiers, and they move to Germany, marry German
citizens, and vow to never return to the states.

Of course there are probably soldiers doing this all over the world, not
just in Germany, but Germany is where Agustin and his family were stationed,
so that's where he's met such soldiers.

And I have to say about these soldiers who have left America for good, I
understand, a little.  I certainly have not experienced what they have, but
for a long time now I have been saying to myself that it's the fault of the
media that we lose track of the war.  It's the news stations and newspapers,
it's them, it's their fault.  But no, it's not really.  People just don't
want to think about it.  People are tired of it.  Americans are fatigued.
And Americans are having babies by the millions, ready to focus on the
nuclear family.  Ready to pull the margins in a little closer.  Ready to
forget a little more.

Some days it's almost impossible to believe our world is real.  I go to my
stupid job where I'm surrounded by incredibly wealthy, stupid assholes who
have such a sense of entitlement, and are so mean spirited and selfish, and
they really have no idea what they really deserve.  As much as I Love this
beautiful country, and Love the many people I know here, it just wrecks the
heart to see so much indifference every single day.

I'm grateful to brave men like Agustin Aguayo for saying FUCK NO, and for
refusing to return to Iraq after they go home on leave.  As many as possible
saying NO!

hi,

since the list (or part of the list) is discussing curricula i wonder
if anybody can give me some pointers as to where and how models of
creative writing practice have been integrated into a more
conventional degree in English ?

i know i know . . . the term Creative Writing does not do it to me
either. I'm kinda stuck with it atm (tbc)

There are many English Departments (in the USAmerican system) offering
Creative Writing and English Literature, for example, as well as
Composition and Rhetoric and Technical and Scientific Communication at
undergraduate and graduate levels.

How many of those seriously intertwine creative writing "practice"
into a straight forward English degree, so that students emerge with
an English BA (say) rather than a Creative Writing BA and so that Lit
students will have struggled with the material practicalities of
creative writing practice?

Keen to hear of any mixes out there, anecdptes etc . .  attempts . . .
i know this *might bore the clothing off list members but am grateful
for any leads either up front or back channel.

love and looking forwards
cris

The Phantom of the Optical: An Online Illustration Trove

BibliOdyssey gives entree to a gorgeous and idiosyncratic gallery of rare
art.

by Damien B. M. English

The Phantom of the Optical

Somewhere in Sydney, a man quietly communes with his computer, poring over
visual "materia obscura" from every corner of the world and a wide spectrum
of centuries. Through RSS (Real Simple Syndication) feeds, bookmarked links,
e-newsletter subscriptions, and search engines, he sifts through the Web
looking for art collections, exhibitions, archives of old engravings, and
portfolios of contemporary graphic artists to share with the world.

This man isn't looking for any particular thing; rather, it seems he's
looking for every beautiful, peculiar, or haunting piece of art that has
ever graced the pages of a book. But what he's looking for exactly is not
important -- what matters is that he's gathering up the gems and oddities he
finds for a visually rich site called BibliOdyssey, a splendid
classroom-discussion tool and entree into art and its history.

The Webmaster, Paul (he has asked that his last name not be printed), is a
mysterious man in his early forties who was born and raised in Sydney and
has spent some time in Vietnam. Known on the site only as peacay or pk, he
says his digital guise isn't an effort to create what he calls a "secretive
persona" but rather the result of a desire to take a backseat to the art,
"because, after all is said and done," he adds, "I'm just a curator, and it
is the content that deserves center stage."

Paul's BibliOdyssey began with what he describes as the "vague notion" to
find interesting but obscure book illustrations. Coupled with this desire
was his growing experience with (and eventual expertise in mining) the
riches of the Internet. Using the burgeoning blogosphere, Internet
communities such as Metafilter, and the online bookmarking site del.icio.us,
he began saving images, then learned how to tweak them for presentation.
Like any bricks-and-mortar gallery curator, he wanted to share his personal
pleasures, so he began posting his rare finds to a Blogger.com hosting site.
The rest of his Odyssean venture naturally fell into place from there.

"The most profound change to the site took place with my gaining more
confidence handling the images," he says. "From this flowed an increase in
the number of images per post, along with an eventual belief that the site
functioned best as a visual magazine rather than just one or two images per
post."

At this writing, BibliOdyssey offers more than 700 posts, all organized,
tagged, indexed, hyperlinked, and readily available to any art lover with a
modem. Each posting of images includes Paul's meticulously researched
commentary, as well as more links for those students or teachers interested
in continuing the exploration.

"What you see in a single post may have taken days, and sometimes months, to
collect, research, write, and edit," says Paul. "For every hour of work in
producing a post, there have probably been ten hours of not-quite-fruitless
searching, reading, and editing."

This attention to detail, and in the quality of the art itself, can draw
teachers and students alike into a world of odd, elegant, and often
surprising images -- each with its own story to tell. A journey through
BibliOdyssey gives art students a chance to sample an eye-peeling exhibition
of art and illustration ranging from a powerfully imagined sketch of a
stormy sea during the Permian age to the funny and peculiar skeletal "Funny
Bones" color sketches of Louis Crucius, displayed in the window of a St.
Louis pharmacy during the late nineteenth century.

One of the most significant things to be learned from BibliOdyssey is how
the Internet can open astonishing new worlds to anyone. Paul has no
background in the visual arts (his resume mentions experience in nursing,
biochemistry, the insurance business, and teaching English as a second
language, but no design background). Wide-ranging curiosity and a natural
gift for spotting memorable art, combined with the modern miracle that lets
us search archives around the globe, have made possible something as
engaging as this site.

The man behind the screen isn't reaping any financial gain from his work,
other than some advertising revenue. He calls the site his "online
manifestation of a personal midlife crisis," joking that it's an obsessive
hobby that "keeps me off the streets." His Web browsing is never topic
based; the primary goal is just to find what he considers "artistically
viable" images that catch his eye and appear in enough numbers to merit a
post. "I can react to something if it's bizarre or elegant or gorgeous or
smart," he says. "But I can -- and very often do -- find beauty or interest
in the minutiae: the technical virtuosity of an engraving or the possible
meanings of some motif in an allegorical picture, or simply the exquisite
beauty of a particular color. I like obscure and weird, certainly -- images
that are often less well known -- but, like everyone, I have a wide
potential for visual interest."

Sharing this interest with others is the main reason Paul plays the
assiduous curator, along with the creative freedom it grants him.

"Without delving too far into the psychology, BibliOdyssey allows me an
outlet for my research tendencies and, in an ongoing way, positive feedback
makes me feel that I'm doing something that's appreciated," he says. "That,
in turn, provides justification for continuing to search for weird and
wonderful visual images."

And there is no doubt he takes pride in his site and works hard for the
greater good of the free, easy-to-access information the Internet is
celebrated for.

"I had a duty to be as accurate as possible," he says. "Otherwise, I would
feel as if I wasn't making any real contribution. I pride myself on
providing, to the best of my modest abilities, the most interesting and
important information as an accompaniment to the images. Images can be
magnetic invitations to learn. BibliOdyssey is a good example of using
image-based enticements to draw people to the stories, history, and
backgrounds of many subject areas."

In case you have lost sight/site of Chris Sullivan (poet, photographer and
song maker) he continues to live in post-Katrina New Orleans where he makes
careful record of the catastrophic tragicomic particulars to be found there.
His website is:
http://8letters.blogspot.com

Chris's visual collection of over one hundred refugee basketballs, Poboy
signage and 'underperforming billboards' becomes a visit to an underworld (a
macro-mirror of the 'disappeared'.) The Federal Gov's continued complicity
with Katrina to make permanent the urban removal of a population of the poor
is more than self-evident.

If you are in Charleston, Chris Sullivan's work is on exhibit at the Light
Factory. Details: http://lightfactory.org

a 12-hour durational performance by Natalie Loveless, Dillon Paul, and Davi=

On August 18th, Natalie Loveless, Dillon Paul, and David Buuck will create =
simultaneous durational performances using the concept of containment-confi=
nement-circumscription as a conceptual framework.  Performing for a duratio=
n of 12 hours, they will be wrapped, trapped, and disciplined, both literal=
ly and figuratively, grappling with the physical, social, institutional, ps=
ychological and political implications of their conditions, as well as sear=
ching for points of friction and resistance.=20

Natalie Loveless will perform the third in a trilogy of wrapping pieces, a =
twelve-hour durational exploration using invisible thread.  In this perform=
ance, Loveless explores the transparent as both an active physical material=
 and a conceptual agent.  Like an ideology, like the unconscious, the invis=
ible moves us.  Both aesthetic and political, this durational action explor=
es the force of the innocuously transparent as a mode of active opposition.=
 =20

Dillon Paul will perform Capture #3, a solo performance inside an enclosed =
wooden box.  The structure of the work conjures images of imprisonment and =
isolation, while the private viewing mechanism evokes a peephole or one-way=
 observation room.  In a suspenseful cat and mouse game, the viewers are en=
ticed to "capture" the performance using a digital camera, acknowledging th=
at, like Schroedinger=C2=B4s Cat, the audience is implicated in the possibi=
lity that their observation inherently changes that which it observes. =20

David Buuck will perform actions from The Treatment, an ongoing performativ=
e writing project. In this iteration, the mundane work of the writer confro=
nts the durational experience of the writing/thinking/performing body withi=
n the institutional spaces of the cubicle, and the broader "white cube" of =
the gallery, or the living-book. Reading and writing thus become public act=
s of presence, tuned to the charged sites of the social.

Back Home, More Frustration

By Elizabeth Williamson
Washington Post Staff Writer
Sunday, August 12, 2007; Page A06

BRUNSWICK, Maine The woman stood waiting amid the lunch counter clatter at
the Grand City Variety Store to confront Olympia J. Snowe....

...Nor does it seem to to Gary Lawless, the long-haired, bearded proprietor
of Gulf of Maine Books, a poet who told Snowe that he is teaching writing to
combat-stressed veterans "to get their stories literally out of their
bodies, so they're not carrying them around by themselves."

The senator, nodding, told him, "I've seen what they put people through."

They seemed to be talking from two distant places. The poet musing on his
veterans and their pain. The senator using Washington words to say she
understands. She has been to Iraq twice and said she will go again in
September, that she has spoken to the president. "On an individual basis, if
you know of anything our office can do to help," she said, motioning to an
aide.

Lawless shook his head. "They don't trust the government to help them."...

Thank you for plugging us into the OBSERVER and Pierre Joris's blog post.

Agustin Aguayo's story also needs to be heard.  The horror he has seen in
the eyes of children in Iraq needs to be known.  He was supposed to be a
medic for crying fucking out loud, but of course the human resources are
stretched so thin that they make the medics go on patrol with guns to shoot
and kill one shift of the day, then go to the hospital and put other bodies
back together for the rest of the day.

Agustin's wife Helga told us he was sending her letters explaining that he
was a destroyed man, and that he would never be the same again.  It
frightened her of course.  But neither of them realized that his letters
were being read by the army.  Then officers showed up at their apartment in
Germany to convince Helga to write back to Agustin and encourage him to be
the man she knew he could be.  And she did this at first because she wanted
her husband to be safe, wanted him to be strong in order to remain safe.

Last night I went to a party to see a good friend who is moving to Buffalo
to study poetry.  She wanted me to tell her about Agustin and Helga because
she couldn't make the talk, and so I did, and we were outside and away from
the rest of the party to do this.  Then another friend came out, and was
actually ANGRY that we were discussing the war.  We got scolded for
discussing the war while a party was going on.

Not being eaten alive by what's going on seems almost criminal to me some
days.

Subject:      ever since the 3rd anniversary of our American invasion of Iraq
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

The first few years of occupation seemed to be years where everyone was
discussing, attending marches, keeping the fever pitch, spreading the
descent.  But on the morning of the 3rd anniversary of our occupation  I
remember not moving in bed, just staying still and thinking about the war.

And thinking too about thinking about the war.  And asking myself quite
honestly if in fact I thought about the war every single day.  And it seemed
an honest answer to say Yes, that I did.  But I was worried about the
future, was worried about continuing to think, to remember the many lives my
tax dollars pay to destroy.

It was that morning that I wanted to make something, just for myself,
something that would remind me every single day without fail that we are a
country at war.  A handwritten, or painted sign could easily be gotten used
to and lost in the room.  So many ideas kept coming.  I even considered a
tattoo, but felt that that too could get lost in the routine of survival and
pain of routine.

My hair.  When I finally thought about my hair I knew that I had the
answer.  And ever since the 3rd anniversary of our American invasion of
Iraq I have refused to cut my hair.  Every morning I have to see it, and
feel it, and wash it.  It's grown beyond my shoulders, and the longer it
gets the more care it needs.  And I've had long hair in the past, but I
didn't care for that hair like I do this hair.  It's a personal metaphor to
live with, this War Hair of mine.  I've never spent money on conditioners
like I do now.  Being with this hair keeps me in check, keeps me angry,
keeps me mournful, keeps me far FAR FAR from sentimentality and other
stupidities, and sets me down in the middle of this breathtaking landscape
of American denial.

This hair will not be cut until we are out of Iraq.  And my friends keep
asking what that means exactly.  Does it mean when our soldiers are out?  Or
when the war itself is over?  Or?  Or peace?  Or?

It would be nice to not die with it is all I can answer.

are offerred at each level: first year includes a course called
Reading/Writing/Text, second year offerings includes Creative Writing:
Introduction, and Writing and Culture, at the third (final BA year)there
are five courses: Poetry off the page, focusing on live and electronic
performance, Writing poetry, and Writing the short story, Rhetoric and
Compositonand The Art and craft of the Essay. There is no BA in Creative
Writing but students can make a speciality of writing in their English
major by availing themselves of the range of offerings. There is now,
however, a Masters in Creative Writing--started this year. There are
other courses at the Masters level, such as Pragmatic, Literacy,
Poetics; Topics in Poetics; as well as undergraduate courses, such as
Contemporary poetry at third year, that are of use to students
interested in writing creative or otherwise. This development of a
portfolio of writing courses has
Been developed over the last few years, partly in reponse to student
interest and partly through a determination to take writing as such,
seriously, which means leaving remedial, vocational, purely applied
teaching to others.
I teach Writing Poetry and Contemporary poetry at third year, and the
graduate course, Topics in Poetics. We also have a Drama programme which
includes 4 graduate courses in dramatic writing. There are 4 poets and a
novelist among the permanent staff. =20

Subject: models of praxis??

hi,

since the list (or part of the list) is discussing curricula i wonder if
anybody can give me some pointers as to where and how models of creative
writing practice have been integrated into a more conventional degree in
English ?

i know i know . . . the term Creative Writing does not do it to me
either. I'm kinda stuck with it atm (tbc)

There are many English Departments (in the USAmerican system) offering
Creative Writing and English Literature, for example, as well as
Composition and Rhetoric and Technical and Scientific Communication at
undergraduate and graduate levels.

How many of those seriously intertwine creative writing "practice"
into a straight forward English degree, so that students emerge with an
English BA (say) rather than a Creative Writing BA and so that Lit
students will have struggled with the material practicalities of
creative writing practice?

Keen to hear of any mixes out there, anecdptes etc . .  attempts . . .
i know this *might bore the clothing off list members but am grateful
for any leads either up front or back channel.

love and looking forwards
cris

hi all.  I am in Kailua-Kona on Hawai'i Island helping friends who are
responsible for protecting and preserving Ahu'ena Heiau, which was King
Kamehameha I's personal heiau and the place where he began the Hawaiian
Kingdom.  He was also prepared for burial there.  The heiau is now
surrounded by a hotel, which was recently sold to an investment company
that preserves its investors' assets by buying prime hotel property in
coastal areas.  They are trying to evict Kulana Huli Honua, the Hawaiian
stewards of the temple.  Here are 10 facts about this desecration.  Click
on website addresses further down to hear Mikahala Roy, kahu of the heiau,
Jimmy Medeiros, a cultural practitioner with Keopuka Ohana, and Uncle
George Naope, a renowned hula teacher and cultural practitioner.

10 FACTS ABOUT KAMAKAHONU AND AHU'ENA HEIAU

1.	Kamakahonu was home to high chiefs of Hawai'i.
2.	From 1812-1819, it was the personal residence of King Kamehameha
the Great.
3.	Kamakahonu was the first capitol of the Hawaiian Kingdom.
4.	Ahu'ena Heiau, located at Kamakahonu, was originally a luakini for
Ku and was restored and rededicated by Kamehameha to Lono.
5.	Kamehameha died at Kamakahonu in 1819; the Hale Lua platform,
where he was prepared for burial is adjacent to Ahu'ena Heiau.
6.	Today, beside the Heiau and the Hale Lua, the King Kamehameha's
Kona Beach Hotel holds its nightly luau and Polynesian extravaganza with
fake ali`i, dancing and drinking, and tourists eating at tables within a
few feet of the Hale Lua, which still holds 'iwi [bones] of our ancestors.
7.	The waters that surround the Ahu'ena Heiau complex are sacred, but
are used today by tourist for swimming, snorkeling and their enjoyment.
8.	Kamakahonu and Ahu'ena Heiau are the anchor to countless sacred
sites along the Kona Coast that are being swallowed up by real estate
ventures.
9.	The new owners of the hotel, Pacifica Hotels Corporation of Santa
Barbara, CA, and Black Point Capital Advisors of Honolulu, are claiming
ownership of Ahu'ena Heiau and its history; this is an insult to all
Hawaiians past and present, and it violates Article 12, Section 7 of the
Hawai'i State constitution, protecting traditional religious practices of
native Hawaiians.
10.	Kamakahonu and Ahu'ena Heiau represent the Ea [sovereignty] of the
Hawaiian people; this sacred site is literally where our international
nationhood began.

it was late in the evening
with all the music seeping through.

that's a snazzy rhythm machine, that song. and poem. and melody. and those
horns!

think of a piece of software art that has a sense of rhythm in the movement
of its parts. it moves the data on the machine in rhythm. it moves like
music. maybe it isn't music. maybe it's visual or something else or all.

anything that i can say to you that doesn't need you to be creative is
boring, as poetry.

he says he turned his amp up, began to play, and blew that room away. but
it's the horns that do it. no, it's you, ramon fernandez!

cris, this is a very timely query for me because I am trying to rethink
the undergraduate creative writing program at the (art & design) school
where I teach.  In this case, it's a matter of creative writing courses
within a BFA, not a BA.  I don't have a problem with the term "creative
writing" (though I probably like Kenny Goldsmith's "uncreative writing"
even more), as I'm very conscious of the history of the discipline in
America; in some ways I'm even proud to own the term.  There is enough
uneasiness about it though to warrant a next move -- I'll be interested
to hear what you come up with.

I don't teach writing within a BA, but within a BFA (studio majors).
It's very difficult to build progression into our curriculum, though we
try.  We have a fantastic faculty of two full-time people; and a core
group of  part-time faculty, widely published & experienced.  One
question I have concerns courses like the second year course Wystan
mentioned, "Creative Writing: Introduction," i.e., introductory courses
in more than one genre.  How do faculty, whose practice and achievement
is in one genre, teach the craft of a second?  Is the expectation that
the lessons learned in one genre transfer to a second or third?  Or do
faculty teaching introductory courses generally have experience in more
than  one genre?  And the concomitant question: to what extent
can/should you detach curriculum from faculty?  In creative writing,
have teachers tended to teach from their own practice more than from an
agreed curriculum?

I'd love to hear more about what you're doing or trying to do, cris.
For example, can students repeat courses for credit?  How many books do
you customarily assign in creative writing workshops (when I was a
graduate student, books were not necessarily assigned, but I tend to
assign lots, too many maybe, up to 10)?   What's your take on
genre-based workshops?
(My own is: the more amorphous/pervasive poetry becomes for as a form,
the more I want to teach its conventional forms!  ).  What are the
interest points in this discussion for you?  What are the conflicts?
What have you been able to apply from your experience and contexts in
England?  What would you like to apply?

Another thing that's a problem, as time goes on, and as experience in a
genre deepens, is that the gap between teacher and student widens.  I
often assign texts on the basis of my own interest -- I may be bored by
texts students haven't even read yet.  So, as check-and-balance, the
notion of a creative writing curriculum becomes a little attractive, as
in Wystan's portfolio of courses, i.e., the best thought of a range of
faculty is employed to design an overall structure, within which
individuals teach.  In my own experience, overall structure in creative
writing programs has either been very, very basic, e.g., Intro to
Creative Writing, then Beginning, Intermediate, or Advanced workshops in
genres; or madly proliferating, with a wide range of faculty offering a
bouquet of similar but different courses.  I'd love to hear some "best
thought" on undergraduate creative writing curricula, also from those
who feel they are achieving good results.

hi all,

thanks for the many and provocative responses both on the list and off
it. I feel maybe i should say just a little more about what's pushing
my search for other models.

We have (i am being approximate) 340 students in the Creative Writing
program and 390 in Literature. Students get awarded a BA in Literature
or a BA in Creative Writing (there are graduate programs in both too
ofc). The idea is to begin to consider an "integration" so that a
degree in English will result, without losing the strengths of both
programs.

I see an opportunity to discuss praxis being a core of such
integration, both in and out of the classroom. Praxis *might not be
the best term, so i'll gladly take friendly ammendments on that
score;) But a pedagogical shake-up between existing mores of
"creative" and "literary" models.

keep it coming

love and looking forwards
cris

May I recommend to you a new movie called "Sunshine"?  It's the best sci fi movie I've seen in many years.  It's about a group of astronauts heading toward the sun to save it from imminent self-destruction by hitting it with an atomic payload the size of Manhattan island?  It is a truly amazing film and not militaristic or pro-militaristic at all?  If you're located in NYC, it is being shown at (where else? ) the Sunshine theater on Houston St.  Regards, Tom Savage.  By the way, I liked this poem.  It has a certain added resonance after just having seen the movie.

away, away, away from the sun
as if it were something of the light to shun
the light, as if the light were something
beyond what weather might cause it to bring
further darkness, emanating rays
disappearing against the length and breadth of days
it was old kant who said beware of such phenomena
that broil up against the space of noumena
or rather there might be that arc of aristotle
just before it decays into so much silly prattle
so what are these rays but longing for the dark
light fleeing light, the world turned stark
and raving, mad and luminous, at a loss for light
along the highways of the mind, the byways of delight

Stephen thank you so much for that article about Gary Lawless's poetry
workshops for veterans.

With some embarrassment I admit that I was angry by Dana Gioia's decision a
few years ago to create funding at the NEA for Iraq veterans to write their
memoirs.

Of course Gioia was also CUTTING funding to all kinds of other organizations
at the time, which helped fuel my anger.  But I also am one of the only men
in my family to not be in the military, and I have great disdain for the
men of my family who are some of the most brutal human beings I've ever
known.

But having been exposed to the stories of Iraq war veterans it's very clear
to me that this war is very different in many ways, and no one could
possibly document it better than the soldiers themselves.  And no one could
help us end this war than these veterans.

And I'm sure they have far more to tell us than the daily horrors of the
war.  What do these soldiers have to say for instance about the private
armies and other corporate interests?  Presidential candidate (he has my
vote!) Dennis Kucinich says (and he is the ONLY one saying such things) that
"Iraq has become the world's best example of privatization."

Light Factory is in Chalotte, NC not Charleston, SC.


In case you have lost sight/site of Chris Sullivan (poet, photographer and
song maker) he continues to live in post-Katrina New Orleans where he makes
careful record of the catastrophic tragicomic particulars to be found there.
His website is:
http://8letters.blogspot.com

Chris's visual collection of over one hundred refugee basketballs, Poboy
signage and 'underperforming billboards' becomes a visit to an underworld (a
macro-mirror of the 'disappeared'.) The Federal Gov's continued complicity
with Katrina to make permanent the urban removal of a population of the poor
is more than self-evident.

If you are in Charlotte, NC (not Charleston), Chris Sullivan's work is on
exhibit at the Light Factory. Details: http://lightfactory.org

Some will hate to tell you, Conrad, what hair conditioners are doing to
poison the Global, including the American landscape: the water supply,
rivers, oceans, etc.  I have a suspicions that 'biodegradable' as a term is
as suspect as 'organic' or 'free range' these days!

To go bald may be more ecological and - in some traditions - penitent and/or
reverential of 'right actions' in a time of war.

With and in total respect for your outrage.

I hope or recommend that folks here read the Jane Mayer essay in last week's
New Yorker on 'The Black Sites' (i.e., CIA run torture chambers in foreign
countries). Impossible to read it, I think, without a gut response that the
perpetrators and policy makers behind the torture will need to be brought to
justice - no doubt by International courts - if this country is going to
ever regain a moral and democratic center.

Otherwise, similar to the effect of the growing black waters  in the artic -
that cannot reflect the sun back from melting down the Artic ice cap and
gradually raising the waters over us - at least on the coasts - the rule of
law and institutions in this country will face a total meltdown.

Poetry - as a public act - will either be activist or nostalgia.

Mark,

Thank you for asking that important question. For me, whether or not a book
of translation is bilingual is a primary concern. Whether or not I know the
language. Didn't that information used to be included more frequently than
it is now? It's even left out of most reviews. One wants to know.

And another issue that is near and dear to my heart--the incarceration of poor people and people of color in this country. I just finished reading an article (actually book reviews) in The Nation. It is mind boggling to me that so many Americans believe that we are the greatest country in the world. Certainly I don't think that we can claim that title now, and I wonder if we have ever been as great as we claim to be.

Diane di Prma,

It's great to read yr posts since I have always thought you are a vastly
underappreciated poet--of course many do love your poetry but still...

Good to have you with us,

Ruth L.

I might add that although Auckland's writing 'portfolio' of courses is
comphrensive and perhaps unusually integral with our academic degree in
English, it is quite new, evolving, and understaffed. Also that I am
myself very new to teaching creative writing. And enjoying it.  For
these reasons in particular I'm interested in hearing more from mairead
and others on this topic.  =20


I'm so new at it that I've been overhauling my course ( 3rd year, called
Writing Poetry) each time I teach it. I'm in favour of an  integrated
model, I'm not interested in teaching  craft courses per se, nor in
courses that are simply genre particular. I like the proposition that
learning to write is a way of learning to read and vice versa.  I like
'praxis' as a term; it pairs with theory ('poetics') for one thing.
Would you say there's  a key role for 'poetics'/theory in the
integration you are considering?

hi all,

thanks for the many and provocative responses both on the list and off
it. I feel maybe i should say just a little more about what's pushing my
search for other models.

We have (i am being approximate) 340 students in the Creative Writing
program and 390 in Literature. Students get awarded a BA in Literature
or a BA in Creative Writing (there are graduate programs in both too
ofc). The idea is to begin to consider an "integration" so that a degree
in English will result, without losing the strengths of both programs.

I see an opportunity to discuss praxis being a core of such integration,
both in and out of the classroom. Praxis *might not be the best term, so
i'll gladly take friendly ammendments on that
score;) But a pedagogical shake-up between existing mores of "creative"
and "literary" models.

keep it coming

love and looking forwards
cris

only reason I pointed it out (apart from me being a picky editor-type)

Yes, I have the book, Loba, that I've had for almost 30 years. It cost $5 when I bought it. I've kept it through all my moves--and those have been many.

So many of the young people who have been sent to Iraq did not join the
military because they were warlike, as may perhaps be the case with the men
you mention in your family, but because of economic pressure or because they
genuinely believed that it was a way to do some good in the world.  That
contributes greatly to the ability of these surviving soldiers to speak the
truth about this war.

That said, I understand very well your initial anger about NEA funds being
directed to help veterans write their memoirs.  The proliferation of war
stories, particularly when they are written at the expense of other stories,
seem to contribute to a cultural idolization of the soldier.  Even stories
meant to show the brutality of war may be taken wrong.

this reminded me of the death notice in today's paper: speaking of
funding, does that mean the Astor estate is going to start paying out
the incredible sum she willed to the Poetry Foundation?=20

again thnx for keeping this discussion evolving (Mairead, Wysten, Pierre,
Heidi, Scott, Catherine and all)

I can say that i have been teaching both "creative writing" and "literature"
courses and both have involved perspectives drawn from cultural studies and
critical/literary theory and poetics (i realise i am
being incredibly washy with my brush) . . .

here undergraduates get an "Introduction to Poetry" in their freshman year;
an "Introduction to Creative Writing" in their sophomore year (taking in
poetry / fiction / creative non-fiction to the professors taste) 7 sections
of this were taught last
semester; Contemporary Poetry (focussing on discussion of works from
the past decade or so . . . sometimes with assignments for hybrid
creative/essay responses); Intermediate Poetry and Intermediate
Fiction (yes they are separated out at this stage); u guessed it
"Advanced Creative Writing" in their Senior year plus a Capstone
course "Issues in Creative Writing".

They can only take each course once ofc, so need a lot of other Literature,
Linguistics etc in their credit mix.

Mairead i recognise the issue of teaching from either a "fiction" or a
"poetry" perspective. My way into it is to explore issues of restraint in
all forms of writing (Oulipian ideas, the found, procedural / processual
works, format-restricted bookworks . . .) and to explore boundaries between
"poetry" and "prose" thru prose-poems, flash fictions etc including
works that just do not simply fit into category (of which there is a growing
number) including digital writing(s) (flash pieces like those by Yung-hae
Chang and so on) and "live" work(s).

But yes their are those who desperately adhere to category;)

love and love

  Seems to me that the creative writing majors should have the same
required courses as the traditional lit majors, plus their
workshops--it wouldn't be horrible to have would-be writers who've
read something written before yesterday. Do undergraduate programs
still have survey courses, medieval, 19th century, etc ?

I'm less clear what benefit creative writing workshops would have for
protoscholars and critics. In theory trying to write poems would be
helpful for understanding the writerly process (any of the dozens of
writerly processes), but I doubt that could be taught to resistant
students in one or two courses. Presumably most poets have already
begun writing poems a long time before they know they want to be
poets--coming to it on assignment would be a whole nother process.

Mairead's students I'd guess are a different breed--they already know
they want to be artists.

Introducing students to a body of theory that's designed to say
something about a set of phenomena might be smarter if the students
are already aware of the phenomena, otherwise it's just building
perceptual walls. Theory, it seems to me, is an endpoint, not a beginning.

Responding primarily to Mark Weiss:

1)  Yes, those old undergrad distribution requirements still exist,
though my sense of things is that there are fewer of them, and that,
generally, the English major is less hierarchical than it was 20 yrs
ago...

2)  I took a CW workshop, and would say this:  anybody who wants to
study contemporary lit can benefit greatly from an insider's view of
compositional practices &/or the ideology of CW--just as they might
benefit from interning at the New Yorker and reading a bunch of NYer
short stories.....the extent to which the future scholar of medieval
poetry will benefit from their time in the workshop is more
complicated....

Mark,re-would-be writers & proto-scholars, I reckon  most of the
students who do these courses will not become either.  It is one of the
features of the teaching of academic student writing--which everyone
does in all departments/ disciplines, whether they think they do or
not--that the model is the scholarship model, unquestioned. Maybe its
ok, certainly it serves one of the narrow purposes of tertiary training,
to replace the trainers, but ...
I have an idea that most would-be writers don't become writers but they
do become/remain keen readers. What is the case is that students, large
numbers of them today,  like the idea of writing courses, and so the
university does too. That shouldn't be a bad thing. It's in fact up to
us to make it a good thing.=20

My concerns are a couple here:

1. Students who aim to become PhD Scholar/Profs (or high school teachers for
that matter) may well benefit from taking creative writing courses, and be
able to recognize and support the efforts of students who veer into creative
work.  On the other hand, PhD's who - by virtue of their creative writing
class 'training' - authoritatively decide what constitutes good versus bad
poetry, etc., may end up being a total, conservative pain in the ass.

2. Not to mitigate the aim of having well read and critically sharp
students, I am wonder if a hard-ass approach to literary criticism might end
up knocking out creative students with x,y and z issues around traditional
forms of learning. Punitive reverence is often a killer! Also, I am sure
many of the poets on this list - as well as in the world - have crazy heads
when it comes to adhering to orthodox teaching practices. (Left brain versus
right brain, and all of that).

For all the benefits people are praising for good reasons, I think it is
still important to recognize we are mixing two cultures here.  Some of my
favorite professors from University universally hated any poetry after
Eliot, etc.  I think you have to be careful here,or you are going to get the
syndrome this country has recently experienced with the Neocons enacting
their creative models for invading and establishing democracy in Iraq.

I think a lot of care has to go into this.

I think its also fair to propose that Creative Writing majors get a good
dose of history, political and otherwise, plus other disciplines, science,
geography, philosophy, linguistics, history of film, music, typography and
book design, etc.  All those kinds of input are vital, I think, to shaking
up writing, its content, etc.

Shouldn't a creative writing major have open as many resources as a good
filmmaker?

Increasingly, MA students at UH are asking to take exams in Creative
Writing Pedagogy, and increasingly
I'm being asked to be an examiner in this field.  As to what that field
might be, I'll perhaps know better after
conducting a directed reading with 5 or so grad and undergrad students
this coming semester.  But my impression
is that the "literature" on the subject is flimsy, east coast centered,
mono-cultural, and generally speaking, pretty
unhelpful.

I did find a decent introduction to the field here:

_The Elephants Teach: Creative Writing Since 1880_, by David G. Myers.
I also like, as a tool, Hazel Smith's _The Writing Experiment_, though I
confess I haven't yet used it to teach by.

But my strong sense is that there needs to me more and better writing on
the subject, because if the lists I'm seeing
are any indication, the field is pretty anemic.

the  best thing you can do for smart students in a poetry workshop is to get
out of the way. have been giving workshops for many yrs & this works best
for me, for them. be a super high energy construct when you enter the
classroom & that will allow you to keep up w/ them. give them your response,
sure, but get to the essential, not pedantic niggling stuff, & encourage
them. bring in poems by terrific poets you love. meet w/ them individually &
point out their strengths. that's all. really. fuck the exercises. unless
they come up spontaneously.
creeley came to some of my classes & I saw & heard. he might demonstrate how
he structured the sounds of the poems but left the mystery intact. talk
about technique & how it creates meaning. technique. sound.
bring in some lang poetry theory abt person, tone, truth, stuff like that,
that keeps things spacious & thought-provoking.
have fun. laugh. ask why they do what they do. sometimes they know.

Thank you, Ruth and Barry and Mary. I have always believed the work finds
its own way--anyone's work.

Mary, you might want to know that the Loba now out with Penguin (horrible
cover, by the way) is twice the length of the Wingbow Press edition ou are
probably referring to (1978). It's Loba Books I & II. There's been more
written since, but that's another story.

Perhaps it might interest some of you to know that the biennial Haiku North
America conference will run this Wednesday through Sunday (August 15 through
19,  2007) in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. It's a packed-full conference
devoted to  discussion, workshops, presentations, readings, and more, featuring
Sonia  Sanchez, Kalamu ya Salaam, William J. Higginson, Cor van den Heuvel, Jim
Kacian,  Richard Gilbert, George Swede, Charles Trumbull, and many more (see
the full  presenter list at
_http://www.haikunorthamerica.com/hna_2007_presenters.html_ (http://www.haikunorthamerica.com/hna_2007_presenters.html) ).

Complete info on the conference is at
_http://www.haikunorthamerica.com/hna_2007.html_ (http://www.haikunorthamerica.com/hna_2007.html) ,  and you can read
a newspaper story (which gets only a few minor things wrong) at
_http://www.journalnow.com/servlet/Satellite?pagename=WSJ%2FMGArticle%2FWSJ_BasicArticle&c=
MGArticle&cid=1173352334467&path=!living&s=1037645509005_

id=1173352334467&path=!living&s=1037645509005)  (now  there's a memorable
URL, eh?).

Should be a superb conference. Past conferences have been in San Francisco
(1991, 1993), Toronto (1995), Portland, Oregon (1997), Chicago (1999), Boston
(2001), New York City (2003), and Port Townsend, Washington (2005).

Stephen I appreciate your worries about my conditioner for my War Hair and
the environment.  I'm not using regular drug store crap, but health food
store conditioner with essential oils.  And I also have a friend who makes
her own and have used that, rosemary and other things from her garden.

There are a host of problems with being part of the environment we pollute
of course, as we all know.  It always blows my mind (for instance) when I
meet an activist for the environment who eats meat.  Now I admit that I
didn't become a vegetarian in 1988 for the sake of animals or the
environment, but for my own health, but since then I've learned an awful lot
about not only what suffering there is in America for animals (worse than
anywhere else on the planet in many ways), but also the insatiable amount
of resources needed to maintain the insane production of, slaughter of,
shelving of. etc., etc.  Which is why those fighting for the environment
need to stop eating meat.  Al Gore by the way is not a vegetarian.

And the Amish everyone likes to think of as quaint, dear folk, are some of
the worst when it comes to animal abuse of all kinds.  I grew up in rural
Pennsylvania and know all about these people.  I've called them The Nazi
Amish for years to the confusion of many ears.

But when I became vegetarian it was through Macrobiotics.  And through
this we learn how the Big Life (as the term goes) includes being certain to
eat locally, not only for your health through your own climate's food, but
to also cut down on the incredible amount of resources (of all kinds, oil,
human, etc.) going towards shipping a banana.

But I'm not macrobiotic now, and haven't been for about a decade, just
vegetarian.  But I must admit that I felt better those first ten years with
macrobiotics.  You can't drink whiskey though, or beer, or smoke cigarettes,
and I have to admit that I like some whiskey and beer and cigarettes.  I'll
probably not be macrobiotic again like I once was, but a close version of it
can be had, I think, with some vice thrown in.

And for those who might think talking about these things not proper for a
Poetics List, I have to say I very much disagree.  All of these things shape
poetry.  What we eat, drink, breathe, and how we relate to or ignore our
environment will be in the poems one way or another, for better or worse.
I've been working on a series of poems where I eat a single color of food
all day before writing the poem for that day, and let me tell you, eating
nothing but BLUE all day while listening to Bobby Vinton's "Blue Velvet" on
a continuous loop from six a.m. to midnight will turn a poem out like little
else.  I'm calling the series "(Soma)tic Midge," for those interested.

The possibilities for poetry really are endless.  There is not a morning you
wake up where you can't imagine some new way to the poems.

aliens from space

once the trick is discovered, it's discovered that the real is no trick.
that is all that can be said about the real; there is much to be said
about display and tricks. consider this trick, whose illusion is entirely
transparent: there is no trick. or perhaps the trick is that there is no
trick, that what is there is here, present, presencing. and it is clear as
well that this presencing is the result of digital deconstruction: of
what? of the vagaries of the wind which are apparent by virtue of timed
mappings. that is to say: paths are chosen, or the parameters are chosen,
and the rest follows. i would go so far as to argue that reality is a
trick or masquerade, hiding nothing, the scaffolding such as it is. the
question about a trick is how is it done, but the trick of the real is
that it is never done, never performed; one characterizes the real as that
which is never performed. here by the real i include reality, and by
reality i include the real; think of this as irrelevant epistemological
slides.

still there is the wonder of the thing or process. it is the wonder of it
that keeps it interesting; it is the wonder that implies that we ourselves
and the trick are on the same side of the real, which is the real.

Elizabeth Kate Switaj, and others.  Thank you for addressing the issues
behind joining the armed services.  And yes, while the men (and some women)
of my family are brutal, war hungry souls, they've all joined primarily out
of economic necessity.  I come from a family of factory workers.  Many of
them worked in the casket factory near where I grew up, making coffins bound
for every direction on the planet imaginable.

But like many, many factories, it moved to Mexico, thanks to Bill Clinton.
No one wants to think about NAFTA as being a Bill Clintonism, but, it is his
hand being the one to finally push it through.  And this while his wife was
on the board of directors of Walmart (for 6 years she sat on that board),
and she has very publicly (and more than once) referred to Sam Walton as a
"great American."  A GREAT AMERICAN!?  Wow, the word GREAT is some kind of
cartoon rubber in her mouth stretching clear around our eyes.

And of course if you want to talk about the poorest of the poor, Bill
Clinton's infamous Welfare Reform went right at the heart and soul of those
who had little to lean on.  You may recall his "Presidential Summit" in
Philadelphia during his presidency?  He had all of the living presidents
(they waited for Nixon to die of course), and Nancy filling in for Ron, show
up at the Philadelphia Convention Center to "celebrate" this most heinous of
atrocities.

At the time I was working for Metropolitan Bakery in Philadelphia, and we
were "chosen" (so to speak) to be the providers of bread at this summit, and
I worked that table with others.  And I got hear the likes of Al Gore and
Oprah Winfrey give mind blowing Herbert Hoover style speeches about the poor
needing to pull themselves up by their bootstraps.  Oprah being the shining
example of IF I CAN DO IT....  The ONLY one to make a speech about all of
this that didn't fit into the package was Jimmy Carter.  Carter was quite
freaked out by the whole process of the summit and what the summit
ultimately meant for millions of poor people.  And I'm sure Carter received
many an icy shoulder after saying what he had to say.

The brutality against the poor is layered in so many ways in this country
that it's become impossible to figure it all out.  And we are the only
country in the West to have private prisons being publicly traded on the
stock market.  And these prisons have an army of lobbyists in DC who are
constantly pushing for tougher and tougher laws to hold people longer and
longer.  And while in these prisons people are working factory work which is
from factories otherwise moved out of the states, leaving countless people
on the "outside" without work, desperate, and turning to crime in many
cases.  And winding up in prison to do the job they lost on the "outside"
when the factory went into the prison and/or down to Mexico.  (This reminds
me of walking down the streets of Philadelphia with poet Etheridge Knight
after he got out of prison, his hands up in the air stating, "Now I'm in the
BIG prison!")

A couple years ago I had a rather strange argument with this hippie kid
parking his VW bus with a bumper sticker on the back that said, "MORE JOBS?
HOW ABOUT LESS PEOPLE!"  And I asked him what he felt that meant to him.
And we got to talking about factories moving to Mexico, to which he said,
"Yeah but the people in Mexico need jobs too!"  Yeah, but how do you
explain, if you're so interested in the environmental side effects of a
factory, closing down a factory in the states that had the EPA looking over
its shoulder all the time to control pollution, and opening up one in Mexico
where no such standards exist?  Not only that, but you already had a
factory, a series of buildings and structures that took many many resources
to build and maintain, and now you literally blow that one up and dump it
into a landfill and use even more resources to build a new one somewhere
else.

The poor and working classes have gotten shit on in every direction since
Reagan, without stop, right on through with the Clinton years.  Bill Clinton
is no rock star of hope, he's a tyrant like the rest of them.  And his wife
is the same song trying to replay itself.

Who cares about those blowjobs Bill got, I care about his blowhard years of
annihilating people's lives.  He had such a charming, disarming smile while
doing it all though.  If charm counts for something, that he had.

Yes, Diane, I was referring to the 1978 edition. I just picked it up and was re-amazed by the poems in there. I don't think that many women were writing like that then--with the breath/breadth of your writing. The writing is both so wild and so tender. It is a wonderful book.

Mary, you might want to know that the Loba now out with Penguin (horrible
cover, by the way) is twice the length of the Wingbow Press edition ou are
probably referring to (1978). It's Loba Books I & II. There's been more
written since, but that's another story.

ye Susan

wholeheartedly agreed

and here there is some resistance from some faculty to really examining
pedagogy and reading lists and so forth (altho some colleagues are engaged
in serious conversation on the same)

i have worked a little with Hazel Smith's book . . and students responded
well both to it and in themselves

love and love

Yikes, hold on a minute.  I have a lot of Amish friends that live
around us.  While I too have some issues with various cultural
assumptions within the Amish community, they are not  all caught up
in puppymills.  We have more than a 100 Amish families as producer-
members that work for our company & to even begin to be organically
certified like all of them are, they have to meet fairly rigid
standards of animal welfare.  I do agree with you that it's a
continuing absurdism to romanticism their lifestyle,  but the
families I know around here are good folks, always more than willing
to help out others when they need it.

Thanks for the breath of fresh air CA. I relate to so much of what you say,
personally, as a one time military brat among other things. Back then, as my
otherwise despicable old man said, the U.S. Army, with free, quality health
care and excellent education for dependent children, and decent apartments
for families and the food commissaries, offered the best socialism on the
planet (who knows if he was right). Clearly the benefits that he loved have
eroded vastly since 1962.

Then there is the issue of casket companies. My first job was in the Granite
State Coffin Company, in front of the third oven on the finishing line
(speaking of sweaty slave labor), sanding gritty little bubbles from the
surface, after the third coat of shellac, had baked onto the wood. All the
labor there in Nashua New Hampshire, myself excepted, was Greek, Lithuanian,
and Lebanese. That experience was the subject of my first published poem,
"Inside the Granite State Hardwood Coffin Company" in Zahir, maybe in 1972.
Granite State was purchased by Batesville, still the largest supplier of
military caskets, and that factory like their other U.S. plants has
relocated its production to Mexico. Now the old Granite State or Batesville
factory is being converted with federal funds into apartments to warehouse
the elderly.

  Please mention this to your friends and all others who might be interested!

  Electronic and mailed entries must meet these requirements:
  1. The manuscript should be at least 48 pages of poetry and no more than 70 pages of poetry in length. Separations between sections are NOT a part of the page count.
  2. A one page cover letter. Include a brief biography, the book's title, your name, address, and telephone number, and, if you have e-mail, your e-mail address. This should be followed by a page which lists publication acknowledgments for the book. For each acknowledgement mention the publisher (journal, anthology, chapbook etc.) and the poem published.
  3. The manuscript should be bound with a single clip and begin with a title page including the book's title, your name, address, and telephone number, and, if you have e-mail, your e-mail address.
  4. The second page should have only the title of the manuscript. There are to be no acknowledgments or mention of the author's name from this page forward. Submissions to the contest are blind judged.
  5. There should be no more than one poem on each page. The manuscript can contain pieces longer than one page.
  6. The manuscript should be paginated, beginning with the first page of poetry.

  Each year Pavement Saw Press will publish at least one book of poetry and/or prose poems from manuscripts received during this competition. Selections are chosen through a blind judging process. The competition is open to anyone who has not previously published a volume of poetry or prose. The author receives $1000 and five percent of the 1000 copy press run. Previous judges have included Judith Vollmer, David Bromige, Bin Ramke and Howard McCord. This year David Baratier will be the judge; past students, Pavement Saw Press interns and employees are not allowed to submit. All poems must be original, all prose must be original, fiction or translations are not acceptable. Writers who have had volumes of poetry and/or prose under 40 pages printed or printed in limited editions of no more than 500 copies are eligible. Submissions are accepted during the months of June, July, and until August 15th. All submissions must have an August 15th, 2007, or earlier, postmark. This is
 an award for first books only.

  If you wish to send via regular mail your manuscript should be accompanied by a check in the amount of $18.00 made payable to Pavement Saw Press. All US contributors to the contest will receive books, chapbooks and journals equal to, or more than, the entry fee. Add $3 (US) for other countries to cover the extra postal charge. Do not include an SASE for notification of results, this information will be sent with the free book. Do not send the only copy of your work. All manuscripts are recycled and individual comments on the manuscripts cannot be made.

  If you wish to submit electronically, you should send $25.00 via paypal to info@pavementsaw.org. We will then send you an e-mail confirmation as well as where to e-mail the manuscript. Electronic submissions need to be sent as PDF files or as word (.doc) files. Other formats are not accepted. The extra cost is to cover the paypal fees as well as the time, labor, ink, and so on, to print out your manuscript. In addition to the prize winner, sometimes another anonymous manuscript is chosen, if enough entries arrive. This “editors choice” manuscript will be published under a standard royalty contract. A decision will be reached in November. Entries should be sent to:

Susan,

I, too, know little, and am very suspicious of it. Have not yet been called
upon to write exams in the field (and since my colleagues know how I feel .
. .).

But, my god friend and colleague, Jerry McGuire (and a good poet, check
Anny's site), instituted the cw pedagogy course for here at Univ. Louisiana
at Lafayette, so I'll ask him when I see him and report back.

By the way, being from south Louisiana, I know how Hawaii must be feeling
now and the music you might be hearing. Hope it reduces and misses you.

Meanwhile we have a depression we've been watching for a day now in the
North Atlantic. It's beginning again,

ye Susan

wholeheartedly agreed

and here there is some resistance from some faculty to really examining
pedagogy and reading lists and so forth (altho some colleagues are engaged
in serious conversation on the same)

i have worked a little with Hazel Smith's book . . and students responded
well both to it and in themselves

Dear others;

I'm quite interested in this thread. I am in charge of the creative writing program that I developed here in the McGhee Division.
Our pedagogy is based on notions of improvisation and constraint (someone mentioned this before -- a la Oulipp. Chance
operations, the Magic Worhops, surrealist games and so forth. In addition our practice is grounded in Winnicottian notions of
play and Wittgentstein's notions of language games and speech acts.

Our students take a Foundations course -- this involved them in meeting writers each week (one class) and engaging in
improvisational writing each week (one class). Students then take studios (2) and workshops (2). They also take two Methods
and Theory courses, one of which is a course in reading and literary influence. The other methods and theory course is an
Advanced Improv class in which the students learn how to develop their own procedures for writing and also learn the theory
that underpins the work they have done earlier in the program, They also write a senior project that has both a critical and
creative component.

This chunk of courses describes a concentration, not a major. Our students must major in humanities. Thus I want our students t
take the bulk of their "major" courses in literature. Writers must read. Literature concentrators often take creative writing
courses. A double concentration is quite usual and what distinguished the two concentrations is the kind of senior project that
gets written and the methods and theory courses that are taken.

The improvisational pedagogy is one I've developed over the years; I've trained most of our faculty.  I might also add that our
students are largely "non traditional"  (what used to be called "adult" ) students and so the pedagogy that is most effective for
them is not necessarily what is most effective for traditional age students.

When I started the program in 1995 I knew that what I did not want was the conventional "workshop" model. The resuts of this
experiment have been encouraging. In 1999 I started a summer program (2 weeks) based on my own theories about teaching
and writing and that has been enormously successful. Many of the disntinguished guest teachers have commented on the fact
that the students actually become better writers during the two weeks they spend with us.

I hope this will be interesting to others. I'd love to have comments.

but clinton's charm is the problem. he's a narcissist, leaving behind a
stream of embittered people, from women he hurt (incl his wife) to people
who wnted to go into business w/ him only to find he had forgotten about
them when he moved on to the next people to be charmed. he has many great
ideas & is a genius at politics but his narcissism got him to make promises
he didn't keep. for ex he sd during his campaign that if elected the first
thing he'd do is help the haitian boat people--and he didn't. and rwanda--he
himself says that was the big failure of his presidency--to allow that
holocaust. the blow jobs are very important--the personal is political--he
cheated on his wife & hurt her--and if you don't think that influenced his
politics, or was his politics, well...I disagree. his globalization stand is
anothere ex of promises, promises, then a sea change when expedient.

Stan Apps and Ryan Daley will be reading poetry next Sunday, the 19th, at
Unnameable Books in Park Slope, Brooklyn, at 8 PM.  The address is 456
Bergen St, which is close to the Bergen St. 2-3 Train, between 5th Ave and
Flatbush.

Stan will be reading from two new books, Info Ration from Make Now Press,
and Princess of the World in Love from Cy Press.  This is the first time
these books will be unveiled in New York City.

Ryan is a new arrival in NYC, and will be reading from his first book,
Armored Elevator (BlazeVOX, 2007).

Info about Stan's new books is at http://www.makenow.org/books.htm and
http://www.cypresspoetry.com/ .  Info about Ryan's book is at
http://www.blazevox.org/bk-rd.htm .  Info about Unnameable Books is at
http://www.unnameablebooks.net/

Here are blurbs about the writers:

Stan Apps is a poet, essayist, and spiritual intermediary.  His books
include soft hands (Ugly Duckling Press, 2005), Info Ration (Make Now Press,
2007) and Princess of the World in Love (Cy Press, 2007).  A book of essays
is forthcoming from Combo Arts and a book of theological opinion is
forthcoming from Les Figues Press.  Stan has recently moved from Los Angeles
to Tampa, Florida, which is not similar to Los Angeles.  Stan's work has
been described by several people, among them K. Silem Mohammad, who writes
that "Apps is heroically unafraid to push past the obvious consequences of
becoming-involved, and into the really lonely spaces of intense
communicative dysfunction that allow us to stop right in the middle of a
sentence if another one suddenly seems more interesting. Once this is
possible, everything seems correct."

A recent arrival in New York City, Ryan is part of Homeland Security's plan
to keep New York safe. His work has appeared in JACKET magazine and Combo.
His study of superstructures, and first book, ARMORED ELEVATOR, was
published by BlazeVOX Books this year. Mike Magee has said that, "Ryan Daley
writes like a traveler who's never seen an airport in his life..But fear
not! Daley speaks the pidgin of many a safe haven and after hours joint. A
bad fit for the 'coterie of alphabetical choir guys,' he's our best hope for
finding the real murderer."

i remember that he said he'd legalize gays in the military; and we ended up with "don't ask, don't tell," a terrible quasi-compromise.

i'm sorry to admit that i was somewhat taken in by clinton's charm and "slept" a bit, politically, through many issues of the 90s (i remember a friend taking me to task for not staying abreast of the welfare-reform bill; and he was right, i should have). it took the unmissable ugliness of this president, and this presidency, to wake me up again.

'i' Cyborg 1.1
Experiments in Random Control:  "I don't remember"

In 'i' Cyborg 1.1 Experiments in Random Control, fragmented and
repetitive narrative forms are used to explore the legitimacy of
language within cybernetic systems, in this case, the Internet.

The narratives, presented as textual performances of a cyborg self,
are constructed using text fragments generated from entering various
three word search terms beginning with 'I' into blog search engines.
At first, the viewer is compelled to read the narrative as a cohesive
work yet the performative acts of textual repetition of the search
phrase exposes the nonsense of the narrative, subsequently challenging
the legitimacy of the text as meaningful.

poems

These poems all respond to a comment made by one of my students during
a discussion of Dickinson (informed, in part, by a parallel one of
Kafka). While we examined a line, the student grew visibly frustrated
with the (narrow) focus of our comments. Exasperated, she exclaimed,
"But we have no idea what comes before or after that poem. We don't
know the secret or imaginary poem she cut away." Since then, I have
been making of my poems a blooded attempt at creating the imaginary
poems that precede and follow them. The imaginary ones, like evidence
of wind, can only be observed by the words they ruffle. Kind reader,
it is your job to find said secrets, in the roughness of your own
wonderfully bizarre brainscape.

Outlimb: Artist Statements & Stills

1.  As a means to heal the phantom pain, the limb is shortened, again
=96 as if the limb was at fault. What I can't say isn't apparent in the
painting, but for me, the desire to escape genre could be likened to
the desire to transcend gender. How many times do I have to say it?
"It isn't futile; it's about futility." Things that arrive on a
conveyor belt, that you eat, half-dead by the machinery alone. "Run
your potatoes through a metal sieve, for more iron." The sun is
over-exposed, and as a result, so is everything in its way. Light
should be measured by volume, so it can be turned down, to just the
right temperature. Editing, erasure, and the paradox of things coming
into being. The edges were wet from premature decay, weather damaged.
There had been too much handling, you could tell, so we just had to
leave it alone. The miracles of progress, of puberty. Industrial
suits, protective rubber shoes, insulation powder. Camouflage as
therapy. What did you say about contamination? It had a metallic taste
to it. Can we shoot a close-up of that? The border was wide, like
water, but I can't remember how it felt when my ear drum collapsed. To
stand in the middle of a room, everyone else looking in; it was like
being folded into an envelope and never waking up until I arrived. The
stillness of travel, the sleepiness of a letter; sealed within a
pocket of time. Shopping for the right fit, I extended myself. Please,
leave me unattended. An accumulation of earnestness, of vulnerability,
apprehensive of the laughs to come. Granted, my pupils can't
physically get any smaller, though I try.

I don't know if this fits, but there's the Palgrave Poetry and
Pedagogy that came out recently. I've found it interesting. I'm going
to be presenting with some friends from Iowa at the Midwest Writing
Center Association conference this fall on using writing center
techniques to teach creative writing. Specifically, we're trying to
find and discuss alternative to the "workshop" model that we found
lacking because, in my case, it was far too limiting on students'
output, too product-oriented and normative.

I'd really be interested in the lists you've generated so far, both
of the helpful and unhelpful materials.

Are these MA comps exams? Or is it some sort of certification exam
aborning (as if an MA comps exam isn't, I suppose).

I'm really interested in this primarily because I like teaching
writing, and though I tend to be paid for teaching comp or ESL, I
like encouraging and assisting young creative writers too. I'm also
interested because my M.F.A. experience was unhelpful to my writing.
I found the PhD in literature to be much more helpful to my writing,
but then again I'm a sort of bookish person and not particularly
successful as a professional poet.

I wonder if things like Bernadette Mayer's experiment or other lists
of procedures could be considered as pedagogical theory for poets?
Are books like Koch's Wishes Lies and Dreams, though aimed at
children, be considered useful pedagogical theory for us (maybe too
East Coast for your needs?). I guess this move may be a tired one,
but it's still useful: I'm asking if this is an opportunity to
broaden what we might consider a poetry pedagogy text. Does it
overlap literature; can we include A Test of Poetry, How to Write,
and so on?

Donald HOLY SHIT, is this a conspiracy!?  You talk about the Granite State
Hardwood Coffin Factory being converted into homes for the elderly!  About a
year and a half ago I drove my friend Frank Sherlock and others out to where
I grew up.  More than anything I wanted to see the old coffin factory, The
Boyertown Casket Factory, so I drove us out there, only to discover that IT
WAS CONVERTED INTO AN OLD FOLKS HOME!  It was so creepy, especially because
it was late at night.  And Frank said, "WHAT!?  They're working in reverse
now!"

 And for years my friends had heard the stories of the KKK running the town
(it's all true, and they still do), and we went to the giant farmers market
where the KKK sells its patches right out in the open.  A few years ago the
poet Marcella Durand gave a reading in Philadelphia the same week that she
had relatives moving near to where I grew up.  I told her about the KKK, and
what it was like, and she acted like I was nuts, or making it up.  Well, it
didn't take long for her to find out on her own, and the next time I saw her
she was horrified by the incredible racism, anti-Semitism and homophobia out
there.

My mother and I landed in that town when I was four, from a previous
marriage, and I was kind of a wild kid.  We had lived in her car for a
little over half a year as vagrants, staying at churches, with hippy
friends, The Salvation Army (where they literally make you sing hymns for
your supper) before making it to Boyertown, and that town was owned and run
by the Pennsylvania Dutch, a very serious, stoic bunch.  The Conrad family,
who literally adopted us, went about its business of trying to tame me, to
no avail, thank god.  But I remember riding my little bicycle up to the
factory, and my aunt Darlene was carrying a very small coffin to the loading
dock, and I asked her who that one was for.  She never really liked me or my
mother, and she yelled in her thick German accent, "HEADED FOR OKLAHOMA!
SOME YOUNGSTER OUT THERE WHO DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO BEHAVE HIMSELF!"  "What was
his name?"  "NEVER YOU MIND HIS NAME!  GEET BACK TO THE HAUS CREEK!"  My
name is Craig, but they could only pronounce it as Creek.  This whole thing
cracks me up now of course, but at the time I remember always feeling like I
had committed a crime, or something.  HEHEHE!

My best memories of that factory are when they would let us in at
Halloween.  My mother has a picture of me in a vampire costume with my arms
folded over my chest in a coffin.  Another of me sitting up in the coffin
showing my fangs and claws.  I think I liked the coffin factory a little too
much.  Oh, and then there's my first kiss believe it or not.  Being queer in
the paranoid KKK regions of rural Pennsylvania is no joke.  But my boyfriend
Jason and I knew that no one went near the factory at night.  It was
deserted, and the perfect spot.  Experiencing first Love pressed against
a coffin factory's walls seems all too appropriate.  It sets the mood
directly in alignment with a sudden and spastic notion of life being NOW,
you know what I mean?

Oh, and I smoked a lot of dope behind that factory, and even tried to grow
some pot back there once, but someone found it and cut it all down.  Fucking
bastards!  HEHEHE!  The poet Yuri Hospodar also grew up in this town, and
also had family working there, something we discussed at a fever's pitch in
Kevin Killian and Dodie Bellamy's apartment about six months ago, having not
seen one another in person since high school.  Yuri was a couple years ahead
of me, editing the school magazine.  We were both of course closeted for
excellent reasons, such as not wanting to be murdered.  But it was great to
talk about these things with Yuri because I've been away so long that
sometimes the brutality and paranoia of it all seems too dream-like to have
really happened.

My cousin Jonas, also queer, and about 10 years older than me, knows better
details of this than I do, but we have a cousin named David Conrad who used
to be Dolly Conrad. And Dolly worked in the coffin factory when she decided
to have the sex change, and remained working there after she came back
David.  David was not allowed to use the women's room, nor the men's room,
and instead had to use a hole in the floor of the janitor's closet that went
to the sewer.  David was my hero for a long time, someone with guts who was
threatened by the Klan and others, always an outsider, always ready to die
in order to stay alive in the world the way he wanted to be.  But later I
found out that he went to jail for beating up his girlfriends, and then
he became nothing more than just another asshole man in town.

Oh and Donald, it's weird too how different generations of army people react
to one another.  My grandfather fought in WW2, and was kind of full of
himself.  Actually he was a tyrant asshole.  And as a little kid I recall my
uncle Dennis being incapable of attending family functions from his post
traumatic stress disorder from his time served in Vietnam.  My grandfather
called him a pussy, literally, more than once.  And he even said that if he
and his buddies had been in Vietnam that the war would have been won.  What
a jerkoff.

unfortunately, most of the exercise books and form books out there are

mIEKAL, it's certainly good to hear that there really are Amish in the world
like the ones near you.  Wow, how about that?  And of course while it seems
that I'm generalizing, because I am, it's also true that the Amish of rural
Pennsylvania have a very tight world, and are all knowingly part of, and
complicit in the brutality of animals.

Puppy mills are what you chose to focus on.  Puppy mills are only the tip of
iceberg.  My cousin Jonas got his degree in German Studies and lived with an
Amish clan in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, and it literally turned him
into a vegetarian.  The TOTAL disregard for the welfare of animals is
apparent in Lancaster County's Amish.  They will work a horse in the field
until it drops dead.

My good friend Steven Fries is a chiropractor for animals in Philadelphia.
When we first met we bonded over our distrust and anger for the Amish
because of what we both know about their treatment of animals.  He has done
much equestrian work over the years, and he's said if you ever want to see
anything that can possibly be wrong with a horse you need to visit Lancaster
Country.  The dominion over the animals from the bible to the sharp edges of
their bonnets.  Pigs, chickens, all treated with equal brutality.

And yes the puppy mills.  The Amish are our nation's LEADING puppy mill
providers with the highest count of violations to date.  This year alone in
Lancaster County the Amish have been arrested by inspectors for finding
conditions so unbearable that some puppies were both dead and close to
death.

It's good too to hear the Amish near you are interested in growing organic
foods.  Not in Lancaster County.  My cousin Jonas and I drove through the
county once and he pointed out the eerie blue, gray color of the vegetation,
and told me it was the No-Till Spray.  They jump on every experimental
chemical product through government or corporate sponsored programs.  And
nothing's creepier out in the country than miles of fields with the No-Till
Spray, it's like chemical warfare.  Well, it IS chemical warfare!

But once again it is good to hear that there are Amish elsewhere who have
chosen to live the way most of the world chooses to believe that they live.
Thanks for letting me know.

Teachers & Writers Collaborative publishes a wealth of books with a wealth
of experience from poets and novelists in their programs.
If you go to their website, they be a big list.
Some of books are appropriate no matter the age level.
Ron Padgett was the Publications editor and coordinator for a zillion years.

Institutionally and pedagogically I don't think T&W has ever proposed,
instituted, exercised, or imposed  a book of Pedalogical Standards for its
writer employees. The good stuff just keeps coming up from 'the bottom' to
be shared and variously worked with (even variously rejected) by writer
teachers in the field. Such is I think is best!

That's fantastic!  I TOOK that course with Prof. Casamassima in
Barii!!!!!!!! That's incredible.  So you're his son.....
I later wrote a book about Joyce, I really couldn't have done it without
the prof.  Now I teach Irish literature too
(this semester "The Irish Avant-Garde, 1930-1950"; "The Non-Lyric
Tradition,"  "Mime in Irish Theatre," "Irish Men Poets," "Flash Fiction
as Gaeilge", and "Irish MInimalism," yes we teach a lot of courses).
Your father was a gem, Christophe.  None of us could understand how one
small head could carry all he knew -- and he did it without books too!

George,

are you saying that Ulysses is an "Irish" book? I beg to differ. Joyce
was an American acting as an Irishman when the shit hit the Sin Fein.
Joyce's real name (which no one but my family knows) was Bob Silverberg,
a New Yorker who had a very influential steel business, and he wrote a
book called "When Atlas Shrugged", but had to change all the names,
dates and action to fit the Irish attitude he adopted when he became
embroiled with the pre-IRA deal. This would be a great AP course - I
learned these facts from my father, Carmine Casamassima, who taught AP
American Literature in Bari, Italy. He was also from China.

ANNOUNCEMENT

Oasis Press Broadside Series, edited by Stephen Ellis, is once more open for
submissions.  Prose (ie., journal entries, trip reports, "prose poems" - not
stories) okay; poems preferred.  No guidelines beyond page number, which
must total three, seven, or eleven pages, or a close proximity (setting the
text can permit of some adjustment).  Email or write to below addresses for
sample copy.

Those previously published include Daniel Zimmerman, Richard Blevins, Duncan
McNaughton, Joe Napora, Kenneth Warren, Halliday Dresser, Ray DiPalma,
Theodore Enslin, Peter Ganick, Kenneth Irby, Gavin Selerie, Skip Fox, Ange
Mlinko, Jeff Gburek, Patrick Doud, Susan Gevirtz,
Mark DuCharme, Edward Foster, Dale Smith, Thomas Meyer, Michael Basinski,
Allen Fisher, Jordan Davis, Micah Ballard, Kristin Prevallet, Jennifer
Moxley, Anselm Berrigan, Drew Gardner, Peteris Cedrins, John Clarke, Joel
Lewis, Michael Boughn, Joe Safdie, Tom Beckett, Tod Thilleman, Gabriel
Gudding, Henry Gould, Susan M. Schultz, William Sylvester, Nada Gordon, Gary
Sullivan, Mitch Highfill, Kimberley Lyons, Ivan Arguelles, Lee Ann Brown,
Elizabeth Willis, Peter Gizzi, Rod Smith, K. Silem Mohammad, Hank Lazer,
Edmund Berrigan, Alice Notley, Daniel Bouchard, Charles Potts, Alissa Quart,
Jack Kimball, Karen Weiser, Kent Johnson/Jacques Debrot, Jim Behrle, and
Philip Jenks.

The Oasis Press Broadside Project - usually single 11 x 17 folded sheets
printed all sides - was begun as a continuation of and adjunct to the
monthly magazine :that:, co-edited by Stephens Dignazio and Ellis in the
early 90s.  Oasis Broadsides 1 - 34, plus fascicles 1, 2 and 4 (fascicles
are extended broadsides of usually more than 20 pages; publication of this
length may be available at a future date) were edited out of Tel Aviv,
Israel, 1994 - 1996; issues 35 - 39, 42 - 45, 47, and fascicles 3 and 5 - 12
were produced in Amman Jordan 1996 - 1998.  Subsequent issues were edited
out of Portland, Maine (41, 46 - 87, and fascicles 12 & 14), published in
transit by the Oasis Press Mobile Unit (92b) or in various locations in
southeastern Ohio (93 - 104).  Editorial advisement and funding is "through
you the listener", and via the Mercy Seat Collective, a non-federated union
of loose persons of typically carbon manufacture, who are aware of
everything but their membership.

Some - but not all - broadsides still available.  Backlist with prices can
be had through the Press

I agree with Stephen, Teachers & Writers Collaborative (www.twc.org)
publishes an amazing range of texts for classroom use. Here are some of my
favorites that I have used while working with young people on poetry writing
projects:

"Third Mind: Creative Writing Through Visual Art," edited by Tonya Foster &
Kristin Prevallet

"Sing the Sun Up: Creative Writing Ideas from African American Literature,"
edited by Lorenzo Thomas

"The Art of Science Writing," by Dale Worsley & Bernadette Mayer

"How To Make Poetry Comics," by Dave Morice

"Dr. Alphabet," by Dave Morice

"The Teachers & Writers Guide to William Carlos Williams"

"Old Faithful: 18 Writers Present Their Favorite Writing Assignments,"
edited by Christopher Edgar and Ron Padgett

"The Alphabet of the Trees: A Guide to Nature Writing," edited by Christian
McEwen & Mark Statman

"The Grammar of Fantasy: An Introduction to the Art of Inventing Stories,"
by Gianni Rodari

"Poetry Everywhere: Teaching Poetry Writing in School and in the Community,"
by Jack Collom and Sheryl Noethe

"Tolstoy as Teacher," edited by Bob Blaisdell

Sears

Teachers & Writers Collaborative publishes a wealth of books with a wealth
of experience from poets and novelists in their programs.
If you go to their website, they be a big list.
Some of books are appropriate no matter the age level.
Ron Padgett was the Publications editor and coordinator for a zillion years.

Institutionally and pedagogically I don't think T&W has ever proposed,
instituted, exercised, or imposed  a book of Pedalogical Standards for its
writer employees. The good stuff just keeps coming up from 'the bottom' to
be shared and variously worked with (even variously rejected) by writer
teachers in the field. Such is I think is best!

Jasper Bernes' first book of poems, Starsdown, is now available from
SPD (link below). It is a beautiful book, well-made, 96 pages
(perfect bound, 4-color and offset printed). It is the first
publication of the mysterious press in girum imus nocte et consumimur
igni.

"Jasper Bernes' magnificent and multi-layered first book, Starsdown,
emerges as a record of Los Angeles as its physical space collapses
into specters and marks, where "the sky is a swimming pool" and the
signs and stars keep switching places. Beneath the glittering surface
of the last American city, this book animates the profusion of
irreconcilable vernaculars and histories that the city's "pastel-
washed meta-burglaries" have contrived to make disappear. An
archaeology of futures past and futures to come, Starsdown improvises
a poetry which stands finally as actual invention and possibility."

Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; format=flowed

Hello Everybody

I've put three short videos of poems from my sequence Harsh up on You Tube.
The sound comes from work by Steven Lowe who worked on my readings of the
poems, and is the best bit I think.

Still working on the mixed quality of the visuals. Having to save in unusual
formats to get them down to you tube size.

Anyway, best way to find them seems to be to type 'ian davidson harsh' in
the you tube search box. three videos will come up.

It's been a wet summer in Wales.

Ian

Subject:      Dear Buffalo List,
              a message from Rosemary Ceravolo on her husband Jospeh Ceravolo's
              "Fits of Dawn"
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
Content-Disposition: inline

 I promised that I would make this as public as possible.  That PDF file of
the Ceravolo chapbook "Fits of Dawn" as it turns out was made by someone who
did not have permission from Rosemary Ceravolo, who is the literary executor
to her late husband's work.

She wrote me an angry e-mail after finding out about this PDF.

She was convinced it was Joe Massey who had made the file, but I assured her
it was not, and that neither of us have any idea who made it.  And this is
true, and my hope is that the person who DID make it finds out through this
post somehow and has the sense to take it off their server before she finds
them.  The sooner the better, trust me on this one, she's not happy, and
she's not messing around!

But she has, as you can imagine, asked us to no longer forward the PDF file
to those requesting it.  And since I've still been getting about half a
dozen new requests each week since the initial FLOOD of requests, I've
decided to agree to make the message from her public.

I'm very sad about this news.  She wants us to refer to the website:
http://josephceravolo.com/
No disrespect to those who made this site, but it's awful.

But not as awful as living in a world of bookshelves empty of Ceravolo's
poems.  It makes no sense.  So many of us Love his poems.  So very many of
us.  What is all this protection about I wonder?

I'm sad about this because the experience of the PDF file with the help of
Joe Massey has made it clear that there are HUNDREDS of us hungry poets!
It's been great being in touch with so many of you over the "Fits of Dawn"
PDF that none of us knew was, well, illegal.

But I encourage EVERYONE to march your asses over to your local library and
ask the interlibrary loan department to order his books.  You cannot, must
not, ever be deprived of this amazing poetry!

LET'S HAVE THE CERAVOLO REVOLUTION ANYWAY!
Hey, is anyone interested in helping me getting about a hundred of us
together to sit on Rosemary Ceravolo's lawn and read his poems through a
bullhorn until she agrees to put out a collected?

Suppose she doesn't have a lawn?  We'll figure it out, don't worry.  Life's
too fucking short to worry.  But not so short we can't imagine doing
whatever we need to do to change things.

Dear Friends,

I am overwhelmed with the wonderfully supportive outpouring from all
friends of Elizabeth’s and mine.

Thank you.

Please forgive my lack of individual responses at this time.

I want you to know a couple things: 1, she died peacefully at our place
in the country, which she adored, on Sunday of rest, August 12 at 12
noon. Dakota, Sophie, Daisy and I were all there. Dakota’s wife Lisanne,
too, and Maureen our amazing health care worker, and Rima, our dear
friend. The grandkids were upstairs watching a video, fine. Birds in
breeze. Elizabeth just breathed gently into the day.

2, there will be a Praise Day at Bowery Poetry Club next Saturday, August
25
, will remember and yak and lie and kiss and dance, the usual. Please
invite all friends.

3, the formal ceremony will be at MOMA in Nov.

Stay tuned,

and Love,

Bob

The fly in the ointment:

How do you know that his widow isn't doing as Joe Ceravolo wished?

I'm thinking of the latest case with Elizabeth Bishop's "Edgar Allan Poe & the Juke-Box".  If a poet doesn't want his or her "posthumous" work published, must he or she burn everything?

Is it okay to entrust original drafts et al to a friend or widow with specific instructions and hope for the best?


I just took a cursory look at the website; she seems to be making plans to show some of the unpublished work (as well as create a better site), so maybe camping on her lawn is not so urgent?  Did she mention a projected date to you for these happenings?

"Exciting new plans are in progress for the new
official home on the Web of Joseph Ceravolo's Poetry. Audio recordings
of his readings and never before published poems will be made available
to the public in the near future. Check back often as the Web site will
be experiencing a complete redesign very soon."


Best,
Amy

I took the first Poetry Therapy course--awful--at Indiana U of Penna in
Indiana Penna. One night at the bar on the main street my friend & I met
some guys & when they found I was Jewish they sd, Wait right here don't go
anywhere--& they got their only Jewish frat brother to come back to the bar
w/ them & they sd, Guess what she is! They thought we shd go out. 'What's it
like being Jewish?' they asked me.

She may be doing exactly as he wished.

Let's broaden this a bit. I've dealt with a lot of descendants of
poets. It's sometimes not a pretty picture. Many do an excellent job.
Others know nothing about poetry or publishing and could care less,
except, sometimes, about the stray dime. I've had distant cousins ask
for outrageous sums of money for  use of their relative's work, in
effect making publication by anyone unlikely. The heir of one Cuban
poet I would have dearly liked to include in my anthology asked for
considerably more than the entire budget for the book. The nephew and
heir of one important South American poet (who had barely met the
deceased) when faced with a choice went for a small selected by a
third-rate translator because the publisher offered 12 %. That book
fell off the shelves with almiost no notice, but no one else can
publish translations of thepoet for several years. Junction Press, my
imprint, had offered 10%, staying in print basically forever, and a
definitive, large collection with no restrictions as to other
translations. There are heirs who don't answer queries, and one at
least, of an important English-language Caribbean poet, who may or
may not be sitting on a pile of unpublished work, but she wouldn't
know because of the heroin.

The message is: don't leave this casual or by default. Write a will,
appointing as executor(s) someone you trust, and spell out what you
want done with the work and what the rights of the heirs are to be,
presuming they're not the same person/people.. Be sure to ask your
proposed executor beforehand whether she/he is willing to take on the
job. Don't wait till you'r old to do this--one never knows.

And it doesn't hurt to have a lawyer look over the will and make
suggestions. This costs, but presumably the cost will be the least of
the expenses poetry has entailed for you.

A related issue. What should an executor or heir do if the writer
instructs them (think Dickinson and Kafka) to destroy the work or
suppress it forever? There are legal implications, but the moral
implications are I think more important. I don't have an answer for
this one. In the case of the overhyped posthumous Bishop, she might
have been wise to specify the manner of permitted publication, say as
a scholarly footnote rather than a collection of lost treasures. The
heirs would probably have made less money, though.

Daniel,
This is a terrific raft of books, thank you (which brings me to another =
problem: how to balance an insatiable appetite for books with real life =
constraints (one solution: cut out email)).  I frequently use Ron =
Padgett's The Teachers & Writers Handbook of Poetic Forms, and will be =
using it this fall. =20
And to all teaching creative writing within a department,
Do you have pedagogies in common?  I was very interested to read Ruth's =
post about the creative writing curriculum in the McGhee Division at NYU.  =
To what extent is the improvisational pedagogy you use shared by other =
teachers?  For example, is Improvisational Writing a course which various =
full-time/part-time teachers teach?  (I also have another question, Ruth: =
what is the difference, in your program, between a studio and a workshop?  =
I'm not talking about the preliminary writing workshops but say, the =
Poetry Studio and the Poetry Workshop?  In what ways is it valuable to =
have the two terms?  Do they relate to different pedagogies?  Different =
levels?)
Another aspect of this question of program pedagogy/pedagogies, Wystan -- =
I understand that in your department creative writing teachers team-teach. =
 Is this something that happens at both undergraduate and graduate level?  =
What's the rationale and reward, in your view?
cris, I have a question for you too.  I couldn't discern any clear shift =
in focus informing the Miami University 2003 overhaul of creative writing =
requirements.  On the ground, what did that shift represent for students/te=
achers?  Also, more to the point, your creative writing program is large =
compared to my situation; it's also very uniquely balanced with the =
literature program.  They seem pretty much half-and-half in terms of =
student numbers.  This seems very unusual to me, even to have a BA in =
creative writing is unusual, let alone one of comparable size to the BA in =
literature.  Is there any split in the faculty of the Department of =
English along lit/creative writing lines?  As you probably know (and D.G. =
Myers The Elephants Teach is great on this), there are longstanding =
tensions between creative writing and literature within English Departments=
 (Myers' title derives from Roman Jakobson's contemptuous What next, will =
the elephants be teaching zoology, when he heard Nabokov was being =
considered for a chair of literature).  Such tensions have been apparent =
to me in most departments I have had contact with, in some cases they've =
led to creative writing establishing an independent department, or leaving =
the English Dept -- along with all writing per se -- to become part of a =
Communications department.  In an integrated department, there is often =
still a feeling of a ghetto, where creative writing teachers (often with =
an MFA as terminal degree)  are not offered teaching in the PhD in =
literature programs.  I feel this divide is much worse in Ireland, where =
creative writing has been introduced to universities only in the last =
decade or so.  I'm guessing this is not such a problem at Miami --your =
recent question about integrating the two BAs suggests a merger between =
equal partners, where both have much to gain.  The product might seem, at =
face value, to be a traditional BA, but that can't be the outcome you =
imagine, right?  What is your best case scenario?  The move toward an =
integrated BA seems incredible: sort of a forward backward step ... it =
seems you're in a very interesting position there, I'd love to hear more =
about it.

Teachers & Writers Collaborative publishes a wealth of books with a wealth
of experience from poets and novelists in their programs.
If you go to their website, they be a big list.
Some of books are appropriate no matter the age level.
Ron Padgett was the Publications editor and coordinator for a zillion =
years.

Institutionally and pedagogically I don't think T&W has ever proposed,
instituted, exercised, or imposed  a book of Pedalogical Standards for its
writer employees. The good stuff just keeps coming up from 'the bottom' to
be shared and variously worked with (even variously rejected) by writer
teachers in the field. Such is I think is best!

Dear Buffalo Poetics List:


The University of California Press  is pleased to announce the publication o=
f:

A Wall of Two: Poems of Resistance and Suffering=20
from Krak=F3w to Buchenwald and Beyond

Henia Karmel and Ilona Karmel were born to an=20
affluent and distinguished family in Krak=F3w.=20
After the war, they both eventually emigrated to=20
the United States, where they continued to write.=20
Henia Karmel is author of _Marek and Lisa._ Ilona=20
Karmel is author of _An Estate of Memory._ Fanny=20
Howe is the author of, among other books, _On the=20
Ground_, _Gone_ (UC Press), and _Selected Poems_=20
(UC Press), winner of the Commonwealth Club Gold=20
Medal for poetry and The Lemore Marshall Poetry=20
Prize from the Academy of American Poets.=20
_Selected Poems_ was also one of the Village=20
Voice's Best Books of the Year.

http://go.ucpress.edu/Karmel

"The book is a riveting read. The subject, of=20
course, is very compelling and the poems move=20
with great plainness, vividness, and force. The=20
girls survived, though barely, because they were=20
young and strong and because the German war=20
machine needed their bodies. The book is artfully=20
designed to convey the arc of their story from=20
capture to freedom in 1946, and there is, as far=20
as I know, nothing quite like it in the vast=20
literature of the Holocaust. A unique and moving=20
book, of historical significance, rendered into=20
English by one of our most gifted American=20
poets."-Robert Hass



Buchenwald survivors Ilona and Henia Karmel were=20
17 and 20 years old when they entered the Nazi=20
labor camps from the Krak=F3w ghetto. These=20
remarkable poems were written during that time.=20
The sisters wrote the poems on worksheets stolen=20
from the factories where they worked by day and=20
hid them in their clothing. During what she=20
thought were the last days of her life, Henia=20
entrusted the poems to a cousin who happened to=20
pass her in the forced march at the end of the=20
war. The cousin gave them to Henia's husband in=20
Krak=F3w, who would not locate and reunite with his=20
wife for another six months.

you

they can see it in you.
most of them won't say anything, but they know.
they can tell what's happened.
there's something in you that seems different.
you can tell when you look at them.
they act differently to you.
they seem somehow different but you can't pin it down.

all of you know they're going to die.
they don't have to say anything, it's taken for granted.
it's a smell you can't get rid of, everyone smells it.
you don't know where it comes from, but it's there.
it's from them, you're almost certain, you're sure they're
dead, or almost dead, you know it's not from you, there's

you can hear them behind you, but when you turn around, no one's
there and you think, no one's ever been.
you're following them down the street, there's something about
them, you think to yourself, they bear watching

Hi all --

I'm responding to Mairead's questions concerning the McGhee program. The Foundations courses -- as well as all of the other courses -- are rotated among faculty members. I am full time and I have one full time colleague-- otherwise all faculty are part-time. Some of the people I have hired studied with me privately and learned the methodology that way. Others learned by team teaching with me or someone else familiar with the project. I've already hired one of our graduates to teach in the program. (She went on to an MFA at Warren Wilson.) I'm hoping to hire another of our graduates who got an MFA at Brown. Since Creative Writing and Expository Writing are joined at the hip in this program (and we like it that way) many of the methodologies of creative writing find their way to the expository writing classes. We have a reading series and I ask the expository writing faculty to bring their students to these events. This has worked well. Faculty teach both creative writing and
expository writing and I try to spread the courses around in some fair way. We also run pedagogical sessions for faculty in addition to regular faculty meetings.

The studios and the workshops are different. The names are meaningful. The studios are half way between the pure improv of foundations (and foundations presumes no genre) and the more standard workshop practice of the workshops. (I want students to be fully capable of functioning in graduate school workshop classes). In the studios the students do in class writing but not as much as in Foundations. Additionally they work on craft issues (studios are in Prose, Poetry and Performance and our students must take two out of three) and they read in the genre(s) they are being exposed to. In the workshops the students focus more on writing and revising work and they continue to read. The workshops are even more specialized (Poetry, Fiction, Non Fiction, Screenwriting, Playwriting). In the summer we offer a Special Topics course that allows us to enrich our offerings without having too many courses in a small program. Each summer we offer the Intensive. This year, our tenth annivers
ary year, we are focusing attention on global writers -- i.e. writers who in one way or another touch more than American culture. So far we have Bei Dao and Peter Balakian coming and I am working on the fiction writer.

If anyone's interested in knowing more about any of this don't hesitate to backchannel or post a question for all to read.

As you might have guessed I love our program and love thinking about it.

Thank you, Mairead, for your quesitons.

Ruth

As I suggested in earlier post - reiterated here  by Mairead - it's, at
best, an often delicate relationship, if not hostile, between scholarly and
creative practices. Obviously there are poets who have well established
their authority as scholar-critics, and similarly, good scholars who write
good poetry, and where are the two comfortable and respectful of the
different practices.  And where the two 'disciplines' feed each other, all
the merrier, or, sometimes, the pedantic worstest. I suspect the knee jerk
reaction of suspicion to poets who present papers as scholars at the MLA is
part of the rankle, too.  But, in my opinion, no need to have closure one
way or the other. Proof be in the pudding.

Seems to me, one of the ways to neutralize the Creative Writing Academic
Degrees equation of 'pedagogy' with 'imposition' of 'this is the way to pass
the test in order to teach creative writing'  is to challenge students to
come up with their own creative strategies (exercises) for teaching writing,
as well as reading poetry, and  in a variety of contexts (the young, middle
aged, impoverished or well-educated, ethnically diverse, the old, cancer
survivors, etc.)  Not in any way to negate the continuing value of exercises
that have worked for other 'writers in the field', but to both encourage and
look for creative writing students who have the imagination to come up with
their own ways of working imaginatively, intuitively, etc. with others. I
think this should be part of the 'professional filter', anyway, if needs be.

The thought of Writing graduates going out and routinely repeating 'Approved
Pedagogical Norms' for teaching Creative Writing, I suspect, is oppressive
to most of us here.  Writers who spark both work and delight in and out of
the classroom is, at least, my idea of a good 'Norm.'

Daniel,
This is a terrific raft of books, thank you (which brings me to another
problem: how to balance an insatiable appetite for books with real life
constraints (one solution: cut out email)).  I frequently use Ron =
Padgett's
The Teachers & Writers Handbook of Poetic Forms, and will be using it =
this
fall. =20
And to all teaching creative writing within a department,
Do you have pedagogies in common?  I was very interested to read Ruth's =
post
about the creative writing curriculum in the McGhee Division at NYU.  To
what extent is the improvisational pedagogy you use shared by other
teachers?  For example, is Improvisational Writing a course which =
various
full-time/part-time teachers teach?  (I also have another question, =
Ruth:
what is the difference, in your program, between a studio and a =
workshop?
I'm not talking about the preliminary writing workshops but say, the =
Poetry
Studio and the Poetry Workshop?  In what ways is it valuable to have the =
two
terms?  Do they relate to different pedagogies?  Different levels?)
Another aspect of this question of program pedagogy/pedagogies, Wystan =
-- I
understand that in your department creative writing teachers team-teach. =
 Is
this something that happens at both undergraduate and graduate level?
What's the rationale and reward, in your view?
cris, I have a question for you too.  I couldn't discern any clear shift =
in
focus informing the Miami University 2003 overhaul of creative writing
requirements.  On the ground, what did that shift represent for
students/teachers?  Also, more to the point, your creative writing =
program
is large compared to my situation; it's also very uniquely balanced with =
the
literature program.  They seem pretty much half-and-half in terms of =
student
numbers.  This seems very unusual to me, even to have a BA in creative
writing is unusual, let alone one of comparable size to the BA in
literature.  Is there any split in the faculty of the Department of =
English
along lit/creative writing lines?  As you probably know (and D.G. Myers =
The
Elephants Teach is great on this), there are longstanding tensions =
between
creative writing and literature within English Departments (Myers' title
derives from Roman Jakobson's contemptuous What next, will the elephants =
be

literature).  Such tensions have been apparent to me in most departments =
I
have had contact with, in some cases they've led to creative writing
establishing an independent department, or leaving the English Dept -- =
along
with all writing per se -- to become part of a Communications =
department.
In an integrated department, there is often still a feeling of a ghetto,
where creative writing teachers (often with an MFA as terminal degree)  =
are
not offered teaching in the PhD in literature programs.  I feel this =
divide
is much worse in Ireland, where creative writing has been introduced to
universities only in the last decade or so.  I'm guessing this is not =
such a
problem at Miami --your recent question about integrating the two BAs
suggests a merger between equal partners, where both have much to gain.  =
The
product might seem, at face value, to be a traditional BA, but that =
can't be
the outcome you imagine, right?  What is your best case scenario?  The =

... it seems you're in a very interesting position there, I'd love to =

more about it.

Teachers & Writers Collaborative publishes a wealth of books with a =
wealth
of experience from poets and novelists in their programs.
If you go to their website, they be a big list.
Some of books are appropriate no matter the age level.
Ron Padgett was the Publications editor and coordinator for a zillion =
years.

Institutionally and pedagogically I don't think T&W has ever proposed,
instituted, exercised, or imposed  a book of Pedalogical Standards for =
its
writer employees. The good stuff just keeps coming up from 'the bottom' =
to
be shared and variously worked with (even variously rejected) by writer
teachers in the field. Such is I think is best!

I looked at the web site containing some of Ceravolo's poems.  I could be wrong because I've never seen this poem before but the first poem appeared to be more than one poem without any indication of that.  Am I wrong?

How do you know that his widow isn't doing as Joe Ceravolo wished?

I'm thinking of the latest case with Elizabeth Bishop's "Edgar Allan Poe & the Juke-Box". If a poet doesn't want his or her "posthumous" work published, must he or she burn everything?

Is it okay to entrust original drafts et al to a friend or widow with specific instructions and hope for the best?


I just took a cursory look at the website; she seems to be making plans to show some of the unpublished work (as well as create a better site), so maybe camping on her lawn is not so urgent? Did she mention a projected date to you for these happenings?

"Exciting new plans are in progress for the new
official home on the Web of Joseph Ceravolo's Poetry. Audio recordings
of his readings and never before published poems will be made available
to the public in the near future. Check back often as the Web site will
be experiencing a complete redesign very soon."

From: CA Conrad
Subject: Dear Buffalo List,a message from Rosemary Ceravolo on her husband Jospeh Ceravolo's "Fits of Dawn"

I promised that I would make this as public as possible. That PDF file of
the Ceravolo chapbook "Fits of Dawn" as it turns out was made by someone who
did not have permission from Rosemary Ceravolo, who is the literary executor
to her late husband's work.

She wrote me an angry e-mail after finding out about this PDF.

She was convinced it was Joe Massey who had made the file, but I assured her
it was not, and that neither of us have any idea who made it. And this is
true, and my hope is that the person who DID make it finds out through this
post somehow and has the sense to take it off their server before she finds
them. The sooner the better, trust me on this one, she's not happy, and
she's not messing around!

But she has, as you can imagine, asked us to no longer forward the PDF file
to those requesting it. And since I've still been getting about half a
dozen new requests each week since the initial FLOOD of requests, I've
decided to agree to make the message from her public.

I'm very sad about this news. She wants us to refer to the website:
http://josephceravolo.com/
No disrespect to those who made this site, but it's awful.

But not as awful as living in a world of bookshelves empty of Ceravolo's
poems. It makes no sense. So many of us Love his poems. So very many of
us. What is all this protection about I wonder?

I'm sad about this because the experience of the PDF file with the help of
Joe Massey has made it clear that there are HUNDREDS of us hungry poets!
It's been great being in touch with so many of you over the "Fits of Dawn"
PDF that none of us knew was, well, illegal.

But I encourage EVERYONE to march your asses over to your local library and
ask the interlibrary loan department to order his books. You cannot, must
not, ever be deprived of this amazing poetry!

LET'S HAVE THE CERAVOLO REVOLUTION ANYWAY!
Hey, is anyone interested in helping me getting about a hundred of us
together to sit on Rosemary Ceravolo's lawn and read his poems through a
bullhorn until she agrees to put out a collected?

Suppose she doesn't have a lawn? We'll figure it out, don't worry. Life's
too fucking short to worry. But not so short we can't imagine doing
whatever we need to do to change things.

With an exhilaration of Love for the poems that never feels depleted,

DEAR BIRDS, TELL THIS TO MOTHERS
Education consists in instilling into them the universal mind.
     –W.T. Stace after Hegel
 Fly, birds, over all grieving mothers.
 Tell them, if they know more,
 They will grieve less.
 Tell them that the children they grieve for
 Are as mysterious as the God they pray to;
 For God’s way is in them.
 Tell them that the children who came from their bodies
 Have come from so far away,
 And from so much;
 And that these children
 Are going for so much
 Of Hell and Heaven, dark and light—
 That mothers can be as away from them
 As lost lines in the early poetry of France.
 Find the lost lines in
 The writing that is your child, mothers
 (Dear birds, tell them),
 And you will not grieve;
 You will stand up
 In sweet universality.
 You will be God’s mothers,
 Not just your own.

that news really hurts -- last time I saw him was on a stage at Howard

moved really slowly on his way to the stage, so slowly that I was worried about
him -- but once he was behind his drums, it was as if the years fell away and

The discography is way rich. But so important to many of us - way back - was
Freedom Now Suite (1961) - with Abbey Lincoln (incredible 'primal scream'
vocals), Olatunji (also on drums), and Coleman Hawkins. (Check out the great
cover of the original). It was unavoidably one of initial, touch stone
anthems of what was brewing in more ways than one. You could not hear it
without knowing that things were about to rip.   Max Roach was clearly -
here - the fathering spirit.

A real passing for many of us.

Indeed that is the case. (That's the end of my reply to Ruth. The
rest is addressed more generally.)

Stand back while I swat the flies off this poor dead horse.

This started with someone talking about Iowa in Hawai'i. That is:
someone asked for a degree, a certification, and they got exams.
Surprise. ACT and NCS are both based in Iowa City, really close to
the Iowa Writer's Workshop. Some folks work in both places. (If
you're wondering why I bring this up, I think you're on the right
track. If you see my point, you're also on the right track.)

The question remains, and I mean this sincerely: can we consider such
reminders and provocations pedagogical, as proper in a classroom? I
do. I think such wholistic approaches, linking creation and critique
(the left hand of creation) with daily life is one of the best ways
to proceed individually. This may be quite different from the best
way to proceed institutionally. It is easy to dismiss advice like
"write at the same time every day," but research (which means someone
with a license to make more licenses says so AND means that some
someones have found it to be so) suggests that this really works.

I think taking seriously lists like Mayer's is to take our own egos,
both personal and professional, a little less seriously and also to
take risks, which is to take ourselves very seriously in deed. In a
way I see participants in this thread recapping the argument between
Duncan and Levertov over the value of his decision to attempt ballad
forms, as he (perhaps condescendingly) said to Levertov to disrupt
the sure course of his work. There's the secure course. And there's
the productive course, which may be sure. Then there's the course
that comes with a number, which may be sure, productive, or some combo.

What on earth is the value of criteria? They establish their own
values. Evaluation becomes a value. The question is where that is
located: in the institution, in the writer, reader, Rasula's wreader?
I think Hejinian is really useful when she reminds us that a poem is
an investment of energy and that both poet and reader gamble on the
value of the outcome.

These are old, old arguments, known to even junior faculty. I prefer
to stick with the verb end of it. Whatever gets material on the page
or screen whatever, reading is generative. That's not the classroom,
though I earn my bread there. But the classroom can make room for, if
not contain, the idea that reading and writing is a practice
measurable only on an ever-shifting scale.

In this way I ask if we can consider works like A Test of Poetry that
is at best an odd manual of poetry production to be a legitimate
manual of poetry production?

Okay so that's one response to the challenge of poetry pedagogy.
Here's another: There are any number of schools, and we can't escape
that. But must we begin by placing ourselves in this or that school
self-consciously or can we attempt in some way to derange our
experience toward the experience of our materials. Are our students
materials in some sense? Should we allow our words to be as free as
we'd have our students be? Or: here we are in our school; let us work.

A third response, with a post-test: maybe we should certify people as
suitable teachers of poetry ONLY after their students have
demonstrated something we recognize as success. For example, might we
now and only now give Duncan a certification to teach, based on
Palmer, Mackey, and some others? Or maybe we can give H.D. one for
her work in producing a Howe? Or do we not offer certifications based
on distance learning? ((Can we offer an certificate to an existent
non-entity, to, for example, a pidgin?) safely buried)

An Exam.

Question One. Why isn't Bromige's "I Read This Someplace" different
from Pound's first canto?

Question Two. Why should YOU give a damn?

Question Three. We are all liars. Our pants burn for love of it.

((To be less snotty, here's the Bromige:

I Read This Someplace

The lyre bird
amid the eucalyptus
listening for every sound he hears
to trip him into sound he makes.
He has no call or song
his own. He imitates. Each time
he utters something chances are
it is his soul that speaks.

Both Paul Nelson and Mairead Byrne were interested in the entire
bibliography so I wrote Rebecca and she promptly sent it. I hope it =
comes
through as the rest of this post (it's imported from a Word file). =
You'll
probably have to allow for the lose of italics and breaks at the end of =
long
lines. Is there a better way to do this?

Here is the original bibliography that Rebecca Brown compiled (and was =
nice
to so promptly send me)  with (she told me) Dan Sargeant and the help of =
Joy
Whitehall.=20

She asks me to say that she knows it's a bit dated and has incomplete
bibliographical information at times.

All I've done is to put double asterisks (**) before the ones poet and
professor Jerry McGuire recommended.

(It would be great if someone would compile the recommendations from all =
the
replies to Susan's praxis query. Of course, if that someone was an =
annotated
bibliographer, a text might result which would be of great use to anyone
teaching the teaching of creative writing as well as those teaching it.)

A SPACE for CONTEMPORARY ART

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Drafting a Common (Abstract) Language:  Seismosis as Conversation

Saturday, August 18th, 2PM @ GO NORTH GALLERY

Go North is please to present "Drafting a Common (Abstract) Language:
Seismosis as Conversation". Co-authors of the book Seismosis (1913
Press, 2006), John Keene and Christopher Stackhouse will explore the
process and practice of conversation across and through distinctive
generic lines--visual art and literature--by discussing and reading
poems from and selected texts related to this collaborative project.
Issues they hope to touch upon include the question of formal and
thematic abstraction in specific genres, its relation to questions of
race, identification, and authorial agency and autonomy, and the
problematics of interpretation.  How can the artist and poet speak to
each other, and are there languages other than the ones they enact
through which to enter their conversation?

"Drafting a Common (Abstract) Language: Seismosis as Conversation" is
organized in conjunction with "Out of Line" an exhibition of work by
11 artists who use line as an expressive, formal, or conceptual
element within traditional and non-traditional mediums. The show will
be on view from August 4 to August 26, 2007. Copies of Seismosis will
be available for purchase in the gallery.

Participating artists in "Out of Line" include: Elizabeth Beckman,
Thomas Egan, Pamela Hardenburg, Erica Hauser, Kit Keith, Adam Menzies,
Jon Patrick Murphy, Christopher Stackhouse, James Walsh, Eleanor White
and Mike White.

Founded in September 2006 by artists Karlos Carcamo and Gregory Slick,
Go North's mission is to exhibit and promote art by local, national,
and international artists. Its focus is contemporary art that is
dedicated to exploring cutting-edge cultural and artistic issues by
pushing the boundaries of traditional media. The gallery gives artists
the opportunity to expand and explore new dimensions in their work
while providing an important cultural resource to the growing arts
community of Beacon, New York.

Gallery hours: Saturday and Sunday 12 - 6 PM, Friday by appointment.

If you are in New York City, traveling or have friends there, I want to
urge/encourage folks to see, Things Dey Happen, Daniel Hoyle's one person
performance piece that explores the characters, craziness and politics of
Oil in Nigeria's delta region. Hoyle - who lived in Port Harcourt and
traveled extensively among the villages, the refineries and drilling sites =
-
is extraordinary in his capacity to mime and enact the voices of Nigerian
rebels, villagers, oil rig workers, Refinery community relation liaisons,
and U.S Embassy reps.
The piece can be hilarious, but the vision way dark, gratefully with heart.

As some of you may recall, vispo.com hosts the Web site of PRIME, the Peace
Research Institute in the Middle East. PRIME is mainly run by Dan Bar-On, an
Israeli scholar, and Sammi Adwan, a Palestinian scholar.

There are two new documents on the Web site you may find of interest.

LEARNING EACH OTHER'S HISTORICAL NARRATIVE
http://vispo.com/PRIME/leohn1.pdf
This is a preliminary translation into English of a document developed by
Israeli and Palestinian High school teachers that presents to grade 9 and 10
students in Israel and Palestine something of the historical narrative of
the 'other side'. This project is an attempt to "disarm the teaching of
history". There are articles about this project at
http://vispo.com/PRIME/patience.htm (a copy of a USA Today article) and at
http://vispo.com/PRIME/herzog.htm (a copy of an article from the Globe and
Mail). This PRIME project was awarded the inaugual Goldberg IIE prize for
peace-building in the middle east (see
http://vispo.com/PRIME/goldbergprize.htm ).

recorded from 1912+ loose coupler in combination with parallel diodes and
variocoupler (in series with ground): the loose coupler has connections
only to the primary - the secondary is passive/tuning. the variocoupler
(two spherical coils, one within another) tunes by revolving the inner
coil. the antenna is a dipole, one length around 20', the other 100+'
after passing through a coil. the variocoupler and long antenna are from
1920+/1. the diodes are modern (the crystal is problematic). there are no
capacitors/condensers or resistors. the output goes to a low impedance
active speaker set with all but the cradiodirect; the recording is through
the speakers using an olympus voice recorder (which easily covers the
audio frequency of the radio). the direct connection results in hum for
the most part. the usual connection for the radio is a pair of 1918 high
impedance western electric earphone, but these proved inadequate for
recording.

the signals were processed in Cool Edit Pro, using hiss and noise reduc-
tion as well as amplitude normalization and hard limiting. the recording
was done around 12:30 a.m. here in brooklyn. i searched for station pile-
ups as well as 'gaps' between signals which were then amplified. the radio
had broad tuning - the five coils tuned broadly but surprisingly well. i'm
now waiting for a very large coil to see if vlf or anomalous signals may
be received; i'm also looking forward to recording lightning and other
sounds during thunderstorms. in its current configuration the radio pulls
in around 20 stations all over the a.m. band; there are hints of low
frequency beacons, but nothing certain.

tuning is done with a variety of methods in combination - the primary coil
of the loose coupler has a single slider; the secondary coil move within
the primary coil; the variocoupler rotor can be turned; and the vario-
coupler, large antenna coil, and loose coupler can all be moved in rela-
tion to each other. if the secondary coil is directly connected, it can be
tapped at various points. only the slider changes stations 'drastically'
the variocoupler and sliding secondary loosely isolate stations. unlike a
modern radio with a single 'action,' this radio (and other sets) require a
skein-like approach to tuning; everything modifies everything else, and
everything is brought into resonance by sliding, stepping, rotating, and
so forth.

theoretically, i want to explore notions of 'tending' equipment, adjusting
and re-adjusting, as well as thinking of this kind of technology as rela-
ted in a different way to earth (not only to grounding, but to notions of
soil, geology - there's something of heidegger in the background). they
are raw agents of 'earth-fields,' free atmospheric energy, world-static.
at one point, years ago, i wrote about the 'spectral mother' of short-wave
listening; the idea applies here as well - one listens to universal chora.

the recordings are hopefully sufficiently different to be of interest.
the subtextuals (for lack of a better word) are difficult to hear but
fascinating; some are clearly from 60 hz power grid stuff, but there are
others, which i hope to somehow amplify in the future, that seems unusual.
and then there's tapping the energy, running leds, future-cars and rumors
as lightning conductors...

Solved: The mystery of the 'Poe toaster'

Aging historian claims to have created legend of the shadowy grave =20
visitor

WILEY HALL

Associated Press

August 16, 2007 at 5:09 AM EDT

http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20070816.wpoe16/=20
BNStory/Entertainment/home

BALTIMORE =97 The legend was almost too good to be true.

For decades, a mysterious figure dressed in black, his features =20
cloaked by a wide-brimmed hat and scarf, crept into a Baltimore =20
churchyard to lay three roses and a bottle of cognac at the grave of =20
Edgar Allan Poe.

Now, a man in his 90s who led the fight to preserve the historic site =20=

says the visitor was his creation.

"We did it, myself and my tour guides," said Sam Porpora. "It was a =20
promotional idea. We made it up, never dreaming it would go worldwide."

Mr. Porpora is an energetic, dapper fellow in a newsboy cap and a =20
checked suit with a bolo tie. He's got a twinkle in his eye and a =20
mischievous smile, and he tells his tale in the rhythms of a natural-=20
born storyteller.

No one has ever claimed ownership of the legend. So why is he coming =20
forward now?

"I really can't tell you," he said. "I'm doing it because of my love =20
for the story."

Mr. Porpora's belief that he resurrected the international fame of =20
Poe, that master of mystery and melancholia, is questioned by some =20
Poe scholars. But they do credit Mr. Porpora, a former advertising =20
executive, with rescuing the cemetery at the former Westminster =20
Presbyterian Church, now called Westminster Hall, where the writer is =20=

buried.

"I don't know what to say," said Jeff Jerome, curator of the nearby =20
Poe House, who has nurtured for years the legend of the so-called Poe =20=

Toaster. Confronted with Mr. Porpora's assertion that the whole thing =20=

is a hoax, Mr. Jerome reacted like a man who's been punched in the =20
stomach by his beloved grandfather. He's sad. He feels betrayed. But =20
he's reluctant to punch back. "To say the toaster is a promotional =20
hoax, well, all I can say is that's just not so."

Could it be, to quote Poe, that "all that we see or seem is but a =20
dream within a dream?"

Mr. Porpora's story begins in the late 1960s. He'd just been made =20
historian of the church, built in 1852 at Fayette and Greene Streets. =20=

There were fewer than 60 congregants and Mr. Porpora, in his 60s, was =20=

one of the youngest. The overgrown cemetery was a favourite of =20
drunken derelicts.

The site needed money and publicity, Mr. Porpora recalled. That, he =20
said, is when the idea of the Poe toaster came to him. The story, as =20
Mr. Porpora told it to a local reporter then, was that the tribute =20
had been laid at the grave on Poe's Jan. 19 birthday every year since =20=

1949. Three roses - one for Poe, one for his wife and one for his =20
mother-in-law - and a bottle of cognac were placed there, because Poe =20=

loved the stuff even though he couldn't afford to drink it unless =20
someone else was buying.

The romantic image of the mysterious man in black caught the fancy of =20=

Poe fans and a tradition grew. Poe wrote such horror classics as The =20
Fall of the House of Usher, The Pit and the Pendulum, The Masque of =20
the Red Death and The Raven.

In about 1977, Mr. Jerome began inviting a handful of people each =20
year to a vigil for the mysterious stranger. The media began =20
chronicling the arrivals and departures of a "Poe-like figure." In =20
1990, Life magazine published a picture of the shrouded individual. =20
In 1993, he left a note saying "the torch would be passed." Another =20
note in 1998 announced that the originator of the tradition had died. =20=

Later vigil-keepers reported that at least two toasters appeared to =20
have taken up the torch in different years.

Members of the E. A. Poe Society insist they recall members of the =20
old congregation - all now dead - talking about the Poe toaster =20
before Mr. Porpora says he made it up. Stories since the 1970s refer =20
to older newspaper accounts about the visitor. Mr. Jerome found a =20
1950 newspaper clipping that mentions "an anonymous citizen who =20
creeps in annually to place an empty bottle (of excellent label)" =20
against the gravestone.

Mr. Porpora's account isn't consistent. He said in an interview with =20
a reporter in 1967 that he invented the stranger, but the story to =20
which he refers appeared in 1976. Shortly afterward, the vigils and =20
the yearly chronicles of the stranger's visits began. During the same =20=

interview, Mr. Porpora said both that he made the story up and that =20
one of his tour guides went through a pantomime of dressing up, =20
sneaking into the cemetery and laying the tribute on the grave.

Mr. Porpora acknowledges that someone has since "become" the Poe =20
toaster.

Mr. Jerome said the vigils wil

Hey, poets.

My girlfriend Jeanne Baron is moving to Philly from Portland, ME to produce a radio show called Justice Talking. She'll be in Philly 4 nights a week. She's looking for a share, sublet, her own lease, whatever somewhere in the city.

Any leads? Good realtors? Friends who need great roommate? Please backchannel me. Thanks much, Betsy

About THE THIRDEST WORLD:


The Thirdest World includes the work of Gina Apostol, Eric Gamalinda, =20=

and Lara Stapleton, winners of the Philippine National Book Award, =20
the Philippine Centennial Literary Prize, and the Pen Open Book =20
Award, respectively. The three writers, from three greatly varied =20
perspectives, take a look at the histories of struggle, travel and =20
loss inherent to the colonial experience. Two works of fiction are =20
included by each author, along with an essay that discusses the =20
relationship between identity and narrative in each writer=92s work. =20
All three writers see a profound relationship between postmodern =20
structures and the disjointed history of a twice-colonized country: =20
the Philippines changed hands  from Spain to the United States in =20
1898. Passionate, intricate, witty, subtle, wise and wildly fresh and =20=

new, The Thirdest World will give readers fascinating trips over the =20
Pacific and into novel worlds of creativity.

=93These stories chart the strained divide between loyalty and =20
identity: the tough blossoms that flower in the shadow of the =20
American tree. The Thirdest World is an important book, not only for =20
its prescient chronicling of postcolonial Filipinos, but also for its =20=

hic et nunc observations of Filipino identities. Apostol, Gamalinda, =20
and Stapleton are three writers who deserve an international =20
audience.=94 -- Sabina Murray, author of Forgery and The Caprices

"Reading The Thirdest World had me contemplating once again just how =20
far we=92ve come from the (necessary) cultural nationalisms in the =20
Asian American movement of the 1970s to the feminist and queer of =20
color=92s interventions of the 1980s to the embrace of mestizaje and =20
borderlands theory in the 1990s to the liberatory irreverence and =20
playfulness of today, which I can only believe is made possible by =20
the resilient confidence that comes with being comfortable with and =20

About THE BIG MELT:



The demise of American democracy accompanied by the militarized =20
ascent of Americanization is a big drag for everyone. The Big Melt =20
maps both in the spectacle of the 2004 US presidential election. The =20
unmitigated travesties buttressing the deep structure of the Bush-=20
Cheney regime are illuminated with great zeal. The proletariat=92s =20
fight against crime is on.

=93President of the United Hearts has always pushed me over the cliff.=94 =

-- bell hooks

=93The Big Melt, with a wit that is certainly a model for all =20
composition, contains a handful of poems that are weak not only in =20
structure but in diction that gives real beauty to poetry.  Let us =20
condemn these poems therefore, by saying that the President=92s soft =20
head is no match for the razor sharp blade of its heart.=94  -- H=E9l=E8ne=

message is a beacon of hope in an exceedingly dark time.=94 -- Michael =20=

Amy and others who have the same question, it's come up quite a bit that
Rosemary Ceravolo doesn't allow the work to circulate.  I have friends (and
I'm not going to say who so don't ask) who have tried to use some of his
work for various reasons, and it's just impossible to do in most cases.
It's like the poems are in a tightly sealed vault.

So when the PDF started circulating I thought WOW, maybe the work is FINALLY
coming back to us!  (wrong)

But your question is also if maybe his wife is fulfilling his wishes by
keeping the work locked down.  He wrote right up to his death.  And
published and published and published book after book.  Do you really think
it's possible that his last wish was that the MOMENT he died his work
suddenly go into the basement and collect dust?

Granted, maybe you're right.  But it just doesn't make sense to me he would
ever make such a request.  For his short life he wrote a large body of
work, and had an endless supply of poems in him it seemed.  And he was NEVER
shy about publishing.

As much as I'm no a fan of the website devoted to his life's work, it's
good some of the poems are there, but there are literally HUNDREDS of more
poems beyond the website.

The GREAT news is that he kept publishing while he was alive, meaning that
the work is out there.  We can get to it with no one's permission!  The
interlibrary loan department here in my neighborhood was able to order every
single one of his books with no problems.

We do NOT have to live a Ceravolo-deprived life,

There was a Renaissance or Baroque Italian composer named Nicola Porpora.  Was he any relation?  Are we speaking of ghosts here?  Sounds like the beginning of a Poe-like story here.

Aging historian claims to have created legend of the shadowy grave

BALTIMORE — The legend was almost too good to be true.

For decades, a mysterious figure dressed in black, his features
cloaked by a wide-brimmed hat and scarf, crept into a Baltimore
churchyard to lay three roses and a bottle of cognac at the grave of
Edgar Allan Poe.

Now, a man in his 90s who led the fight to preserve the historic site
says the visitor was his creation.

"We did it, myself and my tour guides," said Sam Porpora. "It was a
promotional idea. We made it up, never dreaming it would go worldwide."

Mr. Porpora is an energetic, dapper fellow in a newsboy cap and a
checked suit with a bolo tie. He's got a twinkle in his eye and a
mischievous smile, and he tells his tale in the rhythms of a natural-
born storyteller.

No one has ever claimed ownership of the legend. So why is he coming
forward now?

"I really can't tell you," he said. "I'm doing it because of my love
for the story."

Mr. Porpora's belief that he resurrected the international fame of
Poe, that master of mystery and melancholia, is questioned by some
Poe scholars. But they do credit Mr. Porpora, a former advertising
executive, with rescuing the cemetery at the former Westminster
Presbyterian Church, now called Westminster Hall, where the writer is
buried.

"I don't know what to say," said Jeff Jerome, curator of the nearby
Poe House, who has nurtured for years the legend of the so-called Poe
Toaster. Confronted with Mr. Porpora's assertion that the whole thing
is a hoax, Mr. Jerome reacted like a man who's been punched in the
stomach by his beloved grandfather. He's sad. He feels betrayed. But
he's reluctant to punch back. "To say the toaster is a promotional
hoax, well, all I can say is that's just not so."

Could it be, to quote Poe, that "all that we see or seem is but a
dream within a dream?"

Mr. Porpora's story begins in the late 1960s. He'd just been made
historian of the church, built in 1852 at Fayette and Greene Streets.
There were fewer than 60 congregants and Mr. Porpora, in his 60s, was
one of the youngest. The overgrown cemetery was a favourite of
drunken derelicts.

The site needed money and publicity, Mr. Porpora recalled. That, he
said, is when the idea of the Poe toaster came to him. The story, as
Mr. Porpora told it to a local reporter then, was that the tribute
had been laid at the grave on Poe's Jan. 19 birthday every year since
1949. Three roses - one for Poe, one for his wife and one for his
mother-in-law - and a bottle of cognac were placed there, because Poe
loved the stuff even though he couldn't afford to drink it unless
someone else was buying.

The romantic image of the mysterious man in black caught the fancy of
Poe fans and a tradition grew. Poe wrote such horror classics as The
Fall of the House of Usher, The Pit and the Pendulum, The Masque of
the Red Death and The Raven.

In about 1977, Mr. Jerome began inviting a handful of people each
year to a vigil for the mysterious stranger. The media began
chronicling the arrivals and departures of a "Poe-like figure." In
1990, Life magazine published a picture of the shrouded individual.
In 1993, he left a note saying "the torch would be passed." Another
note in 1998 announced that the originator of the tradition had died.
Later vigil-keepers reported that at least two toasters appeared to
have taken up the torch in different years.

Members of the E. A. Poe Society insist they recall members of the
old congregation - all now dead - talking about the Poe toaster
before Mr. Porpora says he made it up. Stories since the 1970s refer
to older newspaper accounts about the visitor. Mr. Jerome found a
1950 newspaper clipping that mentions "an anonymous citizen who
creeps in annually to place an empty bottle (of excellent label)"
against the gravestone.

Mr. Porpora's account isn't consistent. He said in an interview with
a reporter in 1967 that he invented the stranger, but the story to
which he refers appeared in 1976. Shortly afterward, the vigils and
the yearly chronicles of the stranger's visits began. During the same
interview, Mr. Porpora said both that he made the story up and that
one of his tour guides went through a pantomime of dressing up,
sneaking into the cemetery and laying the tribute on the grave.

Mr. Porpora acknowledges that someone has since "become" the Poe
toaster.

Mr. Jerome said the vigils wil

Like you, Craig, I too was excited about the pdf.  I also know Joe died suddenly and unexpectedly.  I don't think we're disagreeing on hoping to see more of his work in print.  But I don't think we can presume to know what his wishes were for his work prior to his death, unless the trustees of his estate make his wishes public.  Also, I can't imagine that any poet would want his widow to be the recipient of aggressive demands as she deals with his estate -- this observation is not synonymous with not wanting to see his work made more available.

  But good news, I have heard from a friend of his that the book is possibly slated for publication, and though said friend named a publisher, he's not certain, so I can't spread that rumor.  Overall, I'm sure Joe would be glad to know that hundreds have been clamoring for his work, which will make the publication of the book so welcome.  You're also right to point out that some of his work is currently available and not in a basement collecting dust, as presumed.

For what it's worth, i have every intention of leaving whatever poetry I leave behind, of whatever dubious value it is to anyone anywhere, and I doubt that it will mean much to anyone, in the public domain and I would encourage other poets to do the same. I have a hard time getting behind teh way our culture allows the work of dead artists to make more money for their heirs than they ever could have made for tht artists. it seems like a loophole in the estate tax.

Spoken like a man with no children, or with a great deal of other
property. Do you feel the same about, say, real estate? I buy a
worthless piece of land, my heirs sell it for a mint when the mall
opens next door.

The story of the Ceravalo file is now completely clear, I think, if
there's a book coming out. Widow deals with publisher who would
probably be upset to have his book pre-empted by a bootleg. Widow
wants control of what's left of her loved one. Widow wants to make
sure things are done correctly. Widow feels she has a moral right
(her legal right isn't in question) to what little return there might
be for her sacrifice in making the poems possible, which may be considerable.

If you do want your poems out there in public domain after you die
you'd better specify as such in a will. The next of kin automatically
owns everything in the absence of one, and no publisher in her/his
right mind will touch the poems unless the heir can be found. If you
do decide to specify that the poems are public domain, of course,
your heirs have no recourse if they are mangled or plagiarized, and
whatever press thinks it can make a profit on your work will simply
make more profit.

Smarter would be if the heirs or executor know and honor your
intention. I plan a posthumous book by a poet whose heirs want
nothing but preapproval of the text, to make sure I don't screw it
up. They know that their cut would in any case not amount to much.

I think this hits my limit for the day, but I did want to respond. I'll say that I feel this way specifically about poetry, and while i have similar sentiments about other genres, novels for example, and to a greater extent music. I have a hard time seeing things that I create as my property, particularly after they've been published. At that point I honestly don't care about them very much anymore. I could see it bothering me if someone reprinted something i wrote and screwed it up really badly and still put my name on it. But that would hurt my ego and vanity more than anything else. I wouldn't feel like they'd keyed my car, which would be the better analogy to property.

what it comes down to though is that I never really expect to ever make any money from my poetry, and i don't have any burning desire to either. I write it because i like to write it, and i try to publish it because i like it when people read it. that's the only value there is in it for me. I'd much rather after i'm gone that if it has any readers that they be able to get it without having to shall out for an expensive book by an exceedingly obscure dead guy than for my heirs to be able to buy a couple of six packs of PBR with the royalties from a post-humous publication of something I wrote.

If i someday manage to finish a novel that I can sell and it sells in decent numbers, I might feel differently about that. Somehow authorship and the monetary aspect of novelized entertainment seem more valuable to me. At the same time, as far as my heirs (although i don't have any biological children just yet) are concerned I think a person takes care of their legacy while they're alive. My folks didn't inherit much from their parents, some jewelry and a few grand, an old car, and I won't inherit much more from them, but while they were alive they took care of eachother and at the risk of sounding like a hallmark card, that's worth more than real estate.

wow cris, this is timely but i'm coming in late as i was on retreat this
past week. our creative writing program is housed w/in the English dept
but has a tense relationship to it, with each party (the "lit/theory"
side/ the "writing" side of the faculty) feeling misunderstood,
marginalized and/or exploited. it's hard to get any dialogue going, and
it's the students who suffer.

For the readers of a poet like Ceravalo, tho, I don't think the "leaked" pdf
is going to disturb sales.  Not in the same way that leaking Justin
Timberlake's new album would affect sales for the casual buyer.  But,
honestly, I don't think there is really such a thing as a "casual" poetry
buyer.  We're all reading the bootleg because that is all we can get our
hands on!  If more Ceravalo was made available, I'd buy it.  Without
question.  I hope Rosemary will consider putting out even a small run of her
husband's work; clearly there are a great deal of us clamoring for it!

I'm glad I got hold of some Ceravalo, at any rate.

Max Roach was an amazing drummer and bandleader. He will be missed.

The third video in "On the Edge," narrated by Derek Bailey, features Max
Roach: http://www.ubu.com/film/bailey.html.

He created a lot of great, signature sounds and rhythms out of the whole
drumset, but it's astounding what he was able to do with just the hi-hat:
http://youtube.com/watch?v=dNpDQztqWQw&mode=related&search=.

He collaborated with Oscar Brown, Jr. & Abbie Lincoln on the masterpiece "We
Insist: Freedom Jazz Suite." Brown wrote the lyrics for for "Driva' Man" and
"Freedom Day":

weather of the sea

there's an audience in a large hall. they're listening to lightning. they
have to listen through lots of radio they're not interested in. they're
interested in lightning but lightning comes at a price. there were
silences then and lightning dwelled in many mansions. think of the
mansions and the forgetting of words and music. think of forgetting the
sounds and cries for help and wars of mass destruction. think of wars of
mass destruction and the silence of proper-name-one. think of the silence
of the destruction of capitol-one. think of the noise of capitol-two,
capitol-three, -four -five. lightning hisses, crackles, stutters, roars,
shudders. there's an audience in a large hall. there's radio in the hall
and outside, why outside it's storming. think of the weather of the sea.

I knew Joe Ceravolo in the last seven years of his life. My fellow jrsey poets and I had him read in our reading series and published him in our magazines -- in a period when many of his NYC friends thought he had stopped being an active poet. My anthology of NJ peots is co-dedicated to him.

The issue around Joe's posthumous poetry career are old news. After his death, a number of younger poets offered to run work in magazines and even do collections, but were rebuffed by the estate. Not that Joe's work was easy to find when he was alive--Millenium Dust was barely availible even from the publication date, INRI (which was not included in the selected) was done in a small run and Spring in this world of poor mutts only seemed to start ciculating at the time of his death.

I had heard stories that Rosemary (who under the name Mona Da Vinci is an important pioneer of feminist based art) initially resisted the Coffeehouse selected -- she was hoping that a major commercial would do the book... & who wouldn't want to have that for Joe who barely had any recognition beyond a devoted few.

I remember him reading at a Wm. carlos Williams festival in rutherford. Daniel Halpern had the audience in stiches laughing at his numerous refrences to suburban lawn care products. Joe followed and actaly read each of his poems twice "so you can better understand them" he said --he could have read each 10 times as the audience seemed totaly tuned out.

I do hope that Fits of Dawn and his uncollected work see print. And I am heartened that despite the scarcity of his work he has a fan base
among a whole group of younger writers.

 Ah!  What noble sentiments poets do espouse, on contemplating their
own mortality and the immortality of their works!

Let alone what should be the fate of the works of others---!

Perhaps there can be instituted Living Wills for poets, writers--"When
the plug is pulled, launch Plan 9 for 'The Resurrection and Continuing
Life Everlasting of My Corpus of Works, including the Juvenilia and
the Posthumous' with proper legal guardians thereof to be Strictly
Enforced for the best possible publication & distribution
arrangements, whether by a Press, Web Site or Public Domain."

I consider myself very fortunate, having been clinically dead 4 times
(this is true).  This makes it possible to be producing simultaneously
truly "posthumous" works and "living" works.  In a sense, one may also
be considered as one's own "ghost writer" and thus producing
"ghosthumous works".

Free to produce simultaneously and literally works of the living, the
dead and the after-effects varieties, (a Trinity so to speak-)--the
authors (living, posthumous, ghosthumous) can amuse themselves on
rainy days by tossing into heaps which works will be which--over
there, by the collapsing ceiling's rubble, the living works.  In
another corner, among the spray paint cans and industrial fragments,
the posthumous works.  And there, beside the broken bookshelves filled
with the remnants of birds' nests,  levitating in the eerie
phosphorescent airs of an electrical storm, the ghosthumous works.

With so many "creators" working on so many forms of creation,
simultaneously, continuously, sending some works out, throwing others
away, losing still others--with so much indeterminacy in play already
among the living, the dead, the ghosts, perhaps the best that can
hoped for is that fate to which an opposing general consigned the
population confusing a subordinate.  When asked which were the
Cathars, to be killed, and which were not, and how to tell them apart
and separate them,  the general had a most elegant solution to the
indeterminacy:  "Kill them all, and let God sort them out."

A living writer, poet, can be killed--but an already dead, a ghost?
Perhaps "literarialy" as opposed to "literally".

And what if no God--no literary historian, critic, fellow poet,
relative, heir-- is remotely interested in sorting these post and
ghosthumous writers out among the heaps of works flung about in the
heaps of rubble, bone and ash?

Ashes to ashes, dust to dust, Chaos to Chaos . . . "The most beautiful
world is a heap of rubble tossed down at random (or: in confusion)"
--Heraclitus

Thank you for the image you are giving us of Ceravolo.

I would like to introduce another poet of Italo-American origins, probably
more forgotten than Ceravolo whose poetry has lately been revisited and made
available to potential readers through Dennis Barone: Emanuel Carnevali.
Thanks to Barone I opened a page for him on the Poets' Corner:
http://www.fieralingue.it/modules/poemreviews/corner.php?pa=printpage&pid=260

Dear Joel, thanks for this information, very important.

I'm glad what I've heard is partially WRONG!  And of course I hope very much
that Amy King's friend is right!  How fantastic is this news!?  A Joseph
Ceravolo COLLECTED is something I'll want to buy every poet I know for
Halloween, or Bastille Day, provided I win some cash in Atlantic City.  Not
a problem though, as I've got an amazing arm on the penny slots!

Also Joel, I bought some books you sold to Molly Russakoff here in
Philadelphia.  You had doubles of a bunch of books from your library and
sold them or donated them, or something, to her book shop.  Great stuff!
Hope you do that again some day soon!  When she called and told me she
bought a HUGE amount of Joel Lewis books I made the mistake of telling too
damn many other poets and it was pretty much picked clean by the time I got
there, GEESH!  Fucking vultures!  But I Love them, they're my friends!

BUT!  I was fortunate to buy an amazing (and very rare) Christopher Dewdney
book from your collection!

Thanks again for the note on Ceravolo!  Sounds like maybe a dream is coming
true soon!  And I don't care if this sounds shallow of me, but I hope the
hell there's some good photos of him included!  He was one handsome looking
fellow, GRRRR!

In fact there was that naked poets calendar, you know the one I'm talking
about?  Aren't you in it?  Maybe not, but I only saw it once, briefly, and I
looked for Joseph Ceravolo, only to be disappointed!  But Ted Berrigan was
in there, that was cool.  Who else?  Ah, they need to reprint that thing!
It was great!  Poets have all kinds of funny looking penises, just like
everyone else, so what's the harm, right?  Was there ever a calendar of
naked women poets I wonder?  I don't think so, but maybe I'm wrong.

As far as I know, the only printing of *Fits of Dawn* by Joe Ceravolo that
exists is the "C Press* book published- as a mimeo book - by Ted Berrigan in
1965. I'm one of the lucky ones that has a copy- which I bought (now to his
stated dismay) from Steve Clay a number of years ago.

Since Berrigan obviously created this mimeo manuscript himself by hand-
having read it many times, I often wonder how much of this book consists of
-fascinating- and possibly brilliant- mistypings by Berrigan. Hopefully,
someday, scholars will have the opportunity to do that all-important job of
checking all the manuscripts against the one existing book we have.

there was a southern california poetry swimsuit calendar a while back
which I refused to appear in; it is a little different to be a younger
female poet and asked to be in such a thing, and it not being as
political and more a funny novelty for people who are quite different
from those who would normally appear in such publications

eleanor antin's greek sculpture photo project is GREAT

On television *The Simpsons* can be watched in the Middle East on both the
Star Network (nightly) and Showtime Arabia. You can also purchase the season
collections in stores. As for the new film, it is playing all around the

Charles Bernstein's version of writing experiments is here.  At first
glance it looks to be a different set tho Mayer is acknowledged as
being the inspiration for the list.

Dear Maria and others,

Here's the list of experiments and journal ideas that used to be available
on the Poetry Project site.

Best,

Ed Friedman

-----

Bernadette Mayer's List of Journal Ideas:
Journals of:
* dreams
* food
* finances
* writing ideas
* love
* ideas for architects
* city design ideas
* beautiful and/or ugly sights
* a history of one's own writing life, written daily
* reading/music/art, etc. encountered each day
* rooms
* elaborations on weather
* people one sees-description
* subway, bus, car or other trips (e.g., the same bus trip written about
every day)
* pleasures and/or pain
* life's everyday machinery: phones, stoves, computers, etc.
* answering machine messages
* round or rectangular things, other shapes
* color
* light
* daily changes, e.g., a journal of one's desk, table, etc.
* the body and its parts
* clocks/time-keeping
* tenant-landlord situations
* telephone calls (taped?)
* skies
* dangers
* mail
* sounds
* coincidences & connections
* times of solitude

Other journal ideas:
* Write once a day in minute detail about one thing
* Write every day at the same time, e.g. lunch poems, waking ideas, etc.
* Write minimally: one line or sentence per day
* Create a collaborative journal: musical notation and poetry; two writers
alternating days; two writing about the same subject each day, etc.
* Instead of using a book, write on paper and put it up on the wall (public
journal).
* and so on ...


Bernadette Mayer's Writing Experiments
* Pick a word or phrase at random, let mind play freely around it until a
few ideas have come up, then seize on one and begin to write. Try this with
a non- connotative word, like "so" etc.
* Systematically eliminate the use of certain kinds of words or phrases from
a piece of writing: eliminate all adjectives from a poem of your own, or
take out all words beginning with 's' in Shakespeare's sonnets.
* Rewrite someone else's writing. Experiment with theft and plagiarism.
* Systematically derange the language: write a work consisting only of
prepositional phrases, or, add a gerund to every line of an already existing
work.
* Get a group of words, either randomly selected or thought up, then form
these words (only) into a piece of writing-whatever the words allow. Let
them demand their own form, or, use some words in a predetermined way.
Design words.
* Eliminate material systematically from a piece of your own writing until
it is "ultimately" reduced, or, read or write it backwards, line by line or
word by word. Read a novel backwards.
* Using phrases relating to one subject or idea, write about another,
pushing metaphor and simile as far as you can. For example, use science
terms to write about childhood or philosophic language to describe a shirt.
* Take an idea, anything that interests you, or an object, then spend a few
days looking and noticing, perhaps making notes on what comes up about that
idea, or, try to create a situation or surrounding where everything that
happens is in relation.
* Construct a poem as if the words were three-dimensional objects to be
handled in space. Print them on large cards or bricks if necessary.
* Write as you think, as close as you can come to this, that is, put pen to
paper and don't stop. Experiment writing fast and writing slow.
* Attempt tape recorder work, that is, recording without a text, perhaps at
specific times.
* Make notes on what happens or occurs to you for a limited amount of time,
then make something of it in writing.
* Get someone to write for you, pretending they are you.
* Write in a strict form, or, transform prose into a poetic form.
* Write a poem that reflects another poem, as in a mirror.
* Read or write a story or myth, then put it aside and, trying to remember
it, write it five or ten times at intervals from memory. Or, make a work out
of continuously saying, in a column or list, one sentence or line, over and
over in different ways, until you get it "right."
* Make a pattern of repetitions.
* Take an already written work of your own and insert, at random or by
choice, a paragraph or section from, for example, a psychology book or a
seed catalogue. Then study the possibilities of rearranging this work or
rewriting the "source."
* Experiment with writing in every person and tense every day.
* Explore the possibilities of lists, puzzles, riddles, dictionaries,
almanacs, etc. Consult the thesaurus where categories for the word "word"
include: word as news, word as message, word as information, word as story,
word as order or command, word as vocable, word as instruction, promise,
vow, contract.
* Write what cannot be written; for example, compose an index.
* The possibilities of synesthesia in relation to language and words: the
word and the letter as sensations, colors evoked by letters, sensations
caused by the sound of a word as apart from its meaning, etc. And the effect
of this phenomenon on you; for example, write in the water, on a moving
vehicle.
* Attempt writing in a state of mind that seems least congenial.
* Consider word and letter as forms-the concretistic distortion of a text, a
mutiplicity of o's or ea's, or a pleasing visual arrangement: "the mill pond
of chill doubt."
* Do experiments with sensory memory: record all sense images that remain
from breakfast, study which senses engage you, escape you.
* Write, taking off from visual projections, whether mental or mechanical,
without thought to the word in the ordinary sense, no craft.
* Make writing experiments over a long period of time. For example, plan how
much you will write for a particular work each day, perhaps one word or one
page.
* Write on a piece of paper where something is already printed or written.
* Attempt to eliminate all connotation from a piece of writing and vice
versa.
* Experiment with writing in a group, collaborative work: a group writing
individually off of each other's work over a long period of time in the same
room; a group contributing to the same work, sentence by sentence or line by
line; one writer being fed information and ideas while the other writes;
writing, leaving instructions for another writer to fill in what you can't
describe; compiling a book or work structured by your own language around
the writings of others; or a group working and writing off of each other's
dream writing.
* Dream work: record dreams daily, experiment with translation or
transcription of dream thought, attempt to approach the tense and
incongruity appropriate to the dream, work with the dream until a poem or
song emerges from it, use the dream as an alert form of the mind's activity
or consciousness, consider the dream a problem-solving device, change dream
characters into fictional characters, accept dream's language as a gift.
* Structure a poem or prose writing according to city streets, miles, walks,
drives. For example: Take a fourteen-block walk, writing one line per block
to create a sonnet; choose a city street familiar to you, walk it, make
notes and use them to create a work; take a long walk with a group of
writers, observe, make notes and create works, then compare them; take a
long walk or drive-write one line or sentence per mile. Variations on this.
* The uses of journals. Keep a journal that is restricted to one set of
ideas, for instance, a food or dream journal, a journal that is only written
in when it is raining, a journal of ideas about writing, a weather journal.
Remember that journals do not have to involve "good" writing-they are to be
made use of. Simple one-line entries like "No snow today" can be inspiring
later. Have 3 or 4 journals going at once, each with a different purpose.
Create a journal that is meant to be shared and commented on by another
writer--leave half of each page blank for the comments of the other.
* Type out a Shakespeare sonnet or other poem you would like to learn
about/imitate double-spaced on a page. Rewrite it in between the lines.
* Find the poems you think are the worst poems ever written, either by your
own self or other poets. Study them, then write a bad poem.
* Choose a subject you would like to write "about." Then attempt to write a
piece that absolutely avoids any relationship to that subject. Get someone
to grade you.
* Write a series of titles for as yet unwritten poems or proses.
* Work with a number of objects, moving them around on a field or
surface-describe their shifting relationships, resonances, associations. Or,
write a series of poems that have only to do with what you see in the place
where you most often write. Or, write a poem in each room of your house or
apartment. Experiment with doing this in the home you grew up in, if
possible.
* Write a bestiary (a poem about real and mythical animals).
* Write five short expressions of the most adamant anger; make a work out of
them.
* Write a work gazing into a mirror without using the pronoun I.
* A shocking experiment: Rip pages out of books at random (I guess you could
xerox them) and study them as if they were a collection of poetic/literary
material. Use this method on your old high school or college notebooks, if
possible, then create an epistemological work based on the randomly chosen
notebook pages.
* Meditate on a word, sound or list of ideas before beginning to write.
* Take a book of poetry you love and make a list, going through it poem by
poem, of the experiments, innovations, methods, intentions, etc. involved in
the creation of the works in the book.
* Write what is secret. Then write what is shared. Experiment with writing
each in two different ways: veiled language, direct language.
* Write a soothing novel in twelve short paragraphs.
* Write a work that attempts to include the names of all the physical
contents of the terrestrial world that you know.
* Take a piece of prose writing and turn it into poetic lines. Then, without
remembering that you were planning to do this, make a poem of the first and
last words of each line to see what happens. For instance, the lines (from
Einstein)
* When at the reception
* Of sense-impressions, memory pictures
* Emerge this is not yet thinking
* And when. . .
* Would become:
* When reception
* Of pictures
* Emerge thinking
* And when
* And so on. Form the original prose, poetic lines, and first-and-last word
poem into three columns on a page. Study their relationships.
* If you have an answering machine, record all messages received for one
month, then turn them into a best-selling novella.
* Write a macaronic poem (making use of as many languages as you are
conversant with).
* Attempt to speak for a day only in questions; write only in questions.
* Attempt to become in a state where the mind is flooded with ideas; attempt
to keep as many thoughts in mind simultaneously as possible. Then write
without looking at the page, typescript or computer screen (This is "called"
invisible writing).
* Choose a period of time, perhaps five or nine months. Every day, write a
letter that will never be sent to a person who does or does not exist, or to
a number of people who do or do not exist. Create a title for each letter
and don't send them. Pile them up as a book.
* Etymological work. Experiment with investigating the etymologies of all
words that interest you, including your own name(s). Approaches to
etymologies: Take a work you've already written, preferably something short,
look up the etymological meanings of every word in that work including words
like "the" and "a". Study the histories of the words used, then rewrite the
work on the basis of the etymological information found out. Another
approach: Build poems and writings form the etymological families based on
the Indo-European language constructs, for instance, the BHEL family: bulge,
bowl, belly, boulder, billow, ball, balloon; or the OINO family: one, alone,
lonely, unique, unite, unison, union; not to speak of one of the GEN
families: kin, king, kindergarten, genteel, gender, generous, genius,
genital, gingerly, pregnant, cognate, renaissance, and innate!
* Write a brief bibliography of the science and philosophy texts that
interest you. Create a file of newspaper articles that seem to relate to the
chances of writing poetry.
* Write the poem: Ways of Making Love. List them.
* Diagram a sentence in the old-fashioned way. If you don't know how, I'll
be happy to show you; if you do know how, try a really long sentence, for
instance from Melville.
* Turn a list of the objects that have something to do with a person who has
died into a poem or poem form, in homage to that person.
* Write the same poem over and over again, in different forms, until you are
weary. Another experiment: Set yourself the task of writing for four hours
at a time, perhaps once, twice or seven times a week. Don't stop until
hunger and/or fatigue take over. At the very least, always set aside a
four-hour period once a month in which to write. This is always possible and
will result in one book of poems or prose writing for each year. Then we
begin to know something.
* Attempt as a writer to win the Nobel Prize in Science by finding out how
thought becomes language, or does not.
* Take a traditional text like the pledge of allegiance to the flag. For
every noun, replace it with one that is seventh or ninth down from the
original one in the dictionary. For instance, the word "honesty" would be
replaced by "honey dew melon." Investigate what happens; different
dictionaries will produce different results.
* Attempt to write a poem or series of poems that will change the world.
Does everything written or dreamed of do this?
* Write occasional poems for weddings, for rivers, for birthdays, for other
poets' beauty, for movie stars maybe, for the anniversaries of all kinds of
loving meetings, for births, for moments of knowledge, for deaths. Writing
for the "occasion" is part of our purpose as poets in being-this is our work
in the community wherein we belong and work as speakers for others.
* Experiment with every traditional form, so as to know it.
* Write poems and proses in which you set yourself the task of using
particular words, chosen at random like the spelling exercises of children:
intelligence, amazing, weigh, weight, camel, camel's, foresight, through,
threw, never, now, snow, rein, rain. Make a story of that!
* Plan, structure, and write a long work. Consider what is the work now
needed by the culture to cure and exact even if by accident the great
exorcism of its 1998 sort-of- seeming-not-being. What do we need? What is
the poem of the future?
* What is communicable now? What more is communicable?
* Compose a list of familiar phrases, or phrases that have stayed in your
mind for a long time--from songs, from poems, from conversation:
* What's in a name? That which we call a rose
* By any other name would smell as sweet
* (Romeo and Juliet)
* A rose is a rose is a rose
* (Gertrude Stein)
* A raisin in the sun
* (Langston Hughes)
* The king was in the counting house
* Counting out his money. . .
* (Nursery rhyme)
* I sing the body electric. . .
* These United States. . .
* (Walt Whitman)
* A thing of beauty is a joy forever
* (Keats)
* (I summon up) remembrance of things past
* (WS)
* Ask not for whom the bell tolls
* It tolls for thee
* (Donne)
* Look homeward, Angel
* (Milton)
* For fools rush in where angels fear to tread
* (Pope)
* All's well that ends well
* (WS)
* I saw the best minds of my generation destroyed by madness
* (Allen Ginsberg)
* I think therefore I am
* (Descartes)
* It was the best of times, it was the worst of times,. . .
* (Dickens)
* brave new world has such people in it
* (Shakespeare, The Tempest, later Huxley)
* Odi et amo (I hate and I love)
* (Catullus)
* Water water everywhere
* Nor any drop to drink
* (Coleridge)
* Curiouser and curiouser
* (Alice in Wonderland)
* Don't worry be happy. Here's a little song I wrote. . .
* Write the longest most beautiful sentence you can imagine-make it be a
whole page.
* Set yourself the task of writing in a way you've never written before, no
matter who you are.
* What is the value of autobiography?
* Attempt to write in a way that's never been written before.
* Invent a new form.
* Write a perfect poem.
* Write a work that intersperses love with landlords.
* In a poem, list what you know.
* Address the poem to the reader.
* Write household poems-about cooking, shopping, eating and sleeping.
* Write dream collabortations in the lune form.
* Write poems that only make use of the words included in Basic English.
* Attempt to write about jobs and how they affect the writing of poetry.
* Write while being read to from science texts, or, write while being read
to by one's lover from any text.
* Trade poems with others and do not consider them your own.
* Exercises in style: Write twenty-five or more different versions of one
event.
* Review the statement: "What is happening to me, allowing for lies and
exaggerations which I try to avoid, goes into my poems."




Jonathan Mayhew's Writing Experiments (with apologies to Bernadette Mayer)
1.            Make a list of writing experiments.
2.            Write a poem in which you include some reference, explicit or
implicit, to everyone you know who has committed suicide.
3.            Write poems designed for a particular magazine (a la Jack
Spicer), even if this magazine doesn't publish poetry. Send the poems to the
magazine as you write them until they either publish you or tell you to
stop.
4.            If you are an academic, give an academic paper composed
entirely of heroic couplets. Don't tell anyone what you are doing.
5.            "Ghost-write" poems for politicians or celebrities.
6.            Write non-stop for 6 months, in every waking hour not devoted
to any other necessary activity.
7.            Compose a poem employing as many metaphors or examples as
possible derived from Wittegenstein's Philosophical Investigations.
8.            Read only poetry written before 1800 for a year. See if your
writing has changed. If it has changed for the better, do the same with
1700.
9.            Take a book of poetry by someone else and compose poetic
responses to every single poem. Try this with a poet you hate and then with
a poet you love. Try writing your poems directly in the book, if you can
stand to deface it.
10.            Invent "heteronimos" a la Pessoa.
11.            Compose a "Japanese Poetic Diary"
12. Write an autobiography, but including only events having to do with
particular "subjects" (cooking, jazz, landlords, shoes).
13.            Write the eleventh "Duino Elegy."
14.            Write a book of poetry in which the letter B never appears.
See if
anyone notices.
15.            Parody your own style.
16.            Stage elaborate contests (sestina contests, memorizing
contests,
rhyming contests).
17.            Invent multiple ways of "gambling" on poetry (e.g. on the
contests
devised above).
18.            Create a "neo-classical" style that is as regular and
normative as
Racine. The vocabulary should be fairly limited, the syntax limpid, the
versification utterly smooth. Use this style as your normal mode of
communication as much as you can get away with.
19.            Try to get non-poets to collaborate with you on grandiose
poetic
projects. Test your persuasive powers.
20.            Convince famous painters to illustrate your work or paint
your
portrait, or composers to set your poems to music.
21.            Practice thinking in complete sentences. Do not write these
down.
22.            Be a Platonic "name-giver" of the type described in the
Cratylus. Work at giving things their exact or "proper" names. Then practice
with "misnomers."
23.            See if Wittgenstein was right: try to invent a "private
language" for your sensations.
24.            Adopt a variety of social "identities" in your writing (race,
ethnicity, class, sexual identity). However, avoid any explicit
"identifying" reference in the poem itself (e.g. don't use the word "barrio"
in your chicano poems).
25.            Invent a private slang (a la Lester Young); attempt to get as
many people as you can to use the words you coin. Don't use these words in
your writing; rather, conceive of the invention of this language as an
independent poetic activity.
26.            Write "vocalese lyrics" to a recorded jazz solo.
27.            Practice speaking in blank verse as "naturally" as possible.
28.            Create your own avant-garde movement; make sure you
officially dissolve the movement after 6 months or a year.
29.            Invent an imaginary city, complete with geography, history,
architecture, prominent citizens, etc... Keep a sort of "bible" of all the
information you compile. Then write poems set in this city.
30.            Write nothing but sestinas and pantoums for a month. Then
"cannabilize" them, using the best lines to write other poems

Received some wonderful feedback and prompt replies. And a special thank you (and you know who you are). By week's end, I will send a reply with address and detailed information related to the project.

As said, I, and with lots of support, including the active participation of both Kathup Tsering and Santanu Bandyopadhyay, and this is a cooperative matter, which is to say that none are gonna receive accolades for doing what is right, are in the midst of planting the seeds, as they say, of a writer's collective in the midst of the Himalayas. And as for me, to be honest, this is being done at my own peril, not to be dramatic - but one can't believe in Tom Paine and pluralism without actually putting one's belief on the line (the word more invidious than any bullets).

With 2008 approaching, and the need ever present, we are looking for those who are willing to donate a single book to this cause (postage included) - and that seed being planted towards the development of a reference library to accompany equipment already donated towards the formation of a support center providing access to those in greatest of need. I am talking about those who, one might argue, have more important things to say and offer than, say, many of those living Stateside or in Europe, and most of whom are writing for reasons far more important than those engrossed in typical "tea culture" - or the newest fad in Brooklyn or Chicago poetics (most of which both scholars and time won't bother to honor).

No insult intended, be sure. But when you cross into Nepal, Mainland gun sites planted on you, barefoot and frostbitten, entering what is really your cultural homeland, because the Mandarin and Tibetans have little in common, leaving family and so-and-so behind, and write - well, then. A book, just a book, postage and no possibility of tax break, is what is asked and the return only in thanks.

Please. Back channel for email. Again, those who have already contacted me will receive a reply by week's end. Just returned to China.

Regards,
Alexander Jorgensen

NYLUND, THE SARCOGRAPHER
by Joyelle McSweeney
Tarpaulin Sky Press
ISBN: 978-0-9779019-4-4
Fiction. 5"x7", 132 pages
Ships October 1, 2007
http://www.tarpaulinsky.com/Press/McSweeney/index.html


NYLUND, THE SARCOGRAPHER is a baroque noir. Its eponymous protagonist is a
loner who tries to comprehend everything from the outside, like a
sarcophagus, and with analogously ornate results. The method by which the
book was written, and by which Nylund experiences the world, is thus called
sarcography. Sarcography is like negative capability on steroids; this
ultra-susceptibility entangles Nylund in both a murder plot and a plot
regarding his missing sister, Daisy. As the murder plot places Nylund in
increasing physical danger, his sensuous memories become more present than
the present itself.

If Vladimir Nabokov wanted to seduce Nancy Drew, he'd read her NYLUND one
dark afternoon over teacups of whiskey. Welcome to fiction's new femme
fatale, Joyelle McSweeney.

-Kate Bernheimer, editor of Fairy Tale Review and the author of The Complete
Tales of Ketzia Gold and The Complete Tales of Merry Gold


If Wallace Stevens had written a novel it might have come close to Joyelle
McSweeney's NYLUND, THE SARCOGRAPHER. But any imagined effort of Mr. Stevens
would pale next to Nylund's journey through the butterflied joinery of
syntax, the jerry-rigged joy of this tour de joist. And you thought you knew
your own language. This book hands it back to you on a platter and includes
the instructional manual for its further use.

-Michael Martone, author of Michael Martone

Dear Catherine, a swimsuit poetry calendar?  Wow, so, who was in that one?
Were they studio shots?  On the beach?  Or reading poems at SPT in bikinis?
Any surf boards?  Anyone in big straw hats?  Anyone drinking martinis or
milkshakes?  Volley ball?  In the library?  Any men in it?  Why have I been
assuming it's just women until now?  Only I can answer that of course.  But
how about sunshine?  Is there lots of sunshine?  A swimsuit poetry calendar
could use a little sunshine, maybe not a lot of sunshine, but a little,
right?  Were there any books in the photos?  Hmmm, I feel like I need to see
this.  I feel like my mind won't rest until I do.

Joel Lewis got back and said Lewis Warsh and Jim Brodey were also in the
naked poets calendar.  That makes me happy as I now remember.  And I swear
it was Brodey where we all gasped and said, WOW, BRODEY IS REALLY HUNG!  But
maybe it was someone else.  But whoever it was he scared us quite a bit.
Well, we weren't really scared, just a little overwhelmed maybe.  But no, I
think it was Brodey though.  In any case HEART OF THE BREATH is one of the
most well hung books of poetry I've ever read.  Remarkable book.  What's
that one line of his I always think of when watching the news?  "lift the
weight of ignorance with music"  I think that's right, or close to it at
least.  I'd like to invent a special recipe and call it the Jim Brodey.  I
need to work on that, something with lots of spice!  Something so spicy you
cry when you eat it.  We should cry when Brodey comes to mind.  But what the
fuck do I know?  Maybe we should laugh?  Or scream?  Or just shut up and sit
still?  Or maybe everyone should just do whatever they want when Brodey
comes to mind.

There are so many tedious poetry calendars every year, year after year.
Well, they're tedious to me because I generally don't like the poems in
them.  I'm not even suggesting we do a better one.  I just wish calendar
making would come to a complete halt frankly.  Fuck calendars.  Aren't you
sick of them?  Maybe it's just me.  Today is Sunday, and I hate how knowing
it's "Sunday" makes a difference.  It does make a difference, and I don't
want it to make a difference.  I want my Tuesdays to be Sundays from now
on.  What a bunch of bullshit this world is, people making up calendars with
days, and numbers.  Temperature of cherries and beans should be enough.

Going to find some beans for a personal forecast,

Thank you, Ed.

Isn't it that the selection of how to write determines what to write?

If so, how is the process really random? Are we not chasing our own tails
here, in more or less interesting ways?

Finally, is it possible to escape oneself, only a certain given version of
ourself?

Ciao,

Murat

What I want you to understand is this:

With over 1000 people on this list, or so I am told, if a mere few hundred could donate a book - or even, oh gosh, two hundred. Well, c'mon now... One less steak, packet of organic what-not, highly fortified and regurgitated refortified and heavily processed to extreme - one less trip to 7/11??

As said, I, and with lots of support, including the active participation of both Kathup Tsering and Santanu Bandyopadhyay, and this is a cooperative matter, which is to say that none are gonna receive accolades for doing what is right, are in the midst of planting the seeds, as they say, of a writer's collective in the midst of the Himalayas. And as for me, to be honest, this is being done at my own peril, not to be dramatic - but one can't believe in Tom Paine and pluralism without actually putting one's belief on the line (the word more invidious than any bullets).

With 2008 approaching, and the need ever present, we are looking for those who are willing to donate a single book to this cause (postage included) - and that seed being planted towards the development of a reference library to accompany equipment already donated towards the formation of a support center providing access to those in greatest of need. I am talking about those who, one might argue, have more important things to say and offer than, say, many of those living Stateside or in Europe, and most of whom are writing for reasons far more important than those engrossed in typical "tea culture" - or the newest fad in Brooklyn or Chicago poetics (most of which both scholars and time won't bother to honor).

No insult intended, be sure. But when you cross into Nepal, Mainland gun sites planted on you, barefoot and frostbitten, entering what is really your cultural homeland, because the Mandarin and Tibetans have little in common, leaving family and so-and-so behind, and write - well, then. A book, just a book, postage and no possibility of tax break, is what is asked and the return only in thanks.

Please. Back channel for email. Again, those who have already contacted me will receive a reply by week's end. Just returned to China.

Cecelia Wolloch wore a black bikini.  Larry Jaffe.  Suzanne Lummis.
I think Elizabeth Iannacci and Brendan Constantine, and I think Eliz
was wearing a leopard print bikini.  Someone wore a trench coat.  I
flipped through it once; it was issued by Tebot Bach, and may be
online somwhere.  I'm sure more of the Tebot Bach people were in it.
Jack Grapes? maybe.  Hopefully Philomine Long and John Thomas (who was
alive then); I really wouldn't do a calendar without Philomine in it.
Probably some of the former hyperpoets?

Frankie Drayus and I proposed wearing parkas.  I was in a fashion show
at an art gallery and they let me wear a parka and carry the teeny

Maryrose Larkin's Whimsy Daybook is a great poetry calendar.  Well,
daybook. No scantily clad or unclad poets in it, though.

what remains


because of the faces and powers among our second lives
and third and others in-between the others; because of
swollen faces thinned back to pages bones and shadowed flesh
that nothing stays what was simple and illusion

and then poetics rounds and fills the world
among lost pages and inscriptions freed
from every symbol and symbols freed and world;
the less are said the farther truth transcends

because of truths and songs and lights and place
where bodies turn; because of bodies churned and stretched
among beams of those lights and those songs; those truths
nothing stays back nothing; valleys fill with jostled things

and things churn symbols; the world
fills silence; skies get dark kiss; welkin

Immigration activist Arellano arrested
By Antonio Olivo

An illegal Mexican immigrant who sought refuge inside
a Chicago church for a year was arrested in Los
Angeles on Sunday afternoon after taking her campaign
on the road.

Elvira Arellano was arrested about 4:15 p.m. Chicago
time by law enforcement officials after leaving Our
Lady Queen of Angels Church in downtown Los Angeles,
said Emma Lozano, an adviser who was there during the
arrest.

After talking to news media inside the church,
Arellano and her supporters got into their van to head
north to San Jose, where she was scheduled to speak at
another church, Lozano said. Moments after they got in
the van, an unmarked vehicle stopped them.

The driver of Arellano's van, Roberto Lopez, poked his
head out of the van because he wanted to see why they
were being blocked. Several other unmarked vehicles
surrounded their van.

Agents came out of all the cars screaming at the top
of their lungs for her to get out, Lozano said. Her
8-year-old son, Saul, started to cry, and Arellano
said to everyone in the car, "Calm down. Don't have
any fear. They can't hurt me."

Then she turned to the people who were about to arrest
her and she said, "You're going to have to give me a
minute with my son," Lozano said. She spent time with
her son in the car, and then surrendered.

It was over in less than two minutes. She was arrested
Sunday on Main Street, near Our Lady Queen of Angels,
where Arellano slept Saturday night and where she's
held several press conferences Saturday and Sunday.

In a statement released Sunday night, U.S. Immigration
and Customs Enforcement said that its "officers in Los
Angeles today arrested criminal alien and immigration
fugitive Elvira Arellano."

"Arellano, who was taken into custody without
incident, is being processed for removal to Mexico
based upon a deportation order originally issued by a
federal immigration judge in 1997," the statment said.
"Arresting and removing criminal aliens is one of
ICE's top enforcement priorities and the agency will
continue to pursue these cases vigorously."

Much of the anger from all parts of the political
spectrum surrounding illegal immigration has been
crystallized by Arellano's story. After entering the
country illegally twice, she became an activist
shortly after she was arrested in 2002 during a
federal sweep at O'Hare International Airport, where
Arellano cleaned airplanes. She was later convicted of
using a fake Social Security card.

Rick Biesada, director and founder of the Chicago
Minuteman Project, lauded the arrest, but he said it
came a year too late.

"I was wondering why the police were dragging their
feet," he said. "By not going in there and getting
her, other illegals were going to churches seeking
sanctuary. Now we're going to have hell to pay in this
country trying to extract these people."

Local Spanish-language radio host Javier Salas said he
felt badly for what happened to Arellano. But in
leaving the sanctuary of Adalberto United Methodist
Church and heading to Los Angeles, it was only a
matter of time before she was arrested.

"I'm not happy that this happened, but it was bound to
happen because she was challenging the system," said
Salas, the host of the morning-drive talk show La
Tremenda on WRTO AM-1200.

By Sunday afternoon Salas was already talking about
the arrest on the radio, and callers were weighing in
too.

Callers were "saying that she was traveling to Los
Angeles and around the United States, she would
provoke [Immigration and Customs Enforcement] and the
anti-immigrant groups," he said. "There would be
checkpoints everywhere."

Salas questioned why it appeared that mainstream media
make Arellano out to be the face of undocumented
immigrants, when her actions have exacerbated the
animosity toward them.

"She wasn't down to earth," he said, adding that
Arellano acted "entitled" to rights "when there's
thousands and thousands of people in the same
situation."

"She made everything worse," Salas said. "She's not a
face of the immigrants. My family without papers, she
doesn't represent them."

Activists in the Chicago area who have followed
Arellano's story weren't surprised that the law caught
up to her.

"Everyone knew it was probably a question of when, not
if " she would be arrested, said Joshua Hoyt,
executive director of the Illinois Coalition for
Immigrant and Refugee Rights. "It just made me feel
really sad because she knows she's looking at time in
prison. I feel bad for her and for her child and for
all the other people in that situation."

Hoyt said he met Arellano nearly three years ago after
she was arrested in a sweep of undocumented immigrants
working at O'Hare International Airport.

Arellano had been cleaning planes at night, he said.
At the time --"before she was famous," Hoyt noted--she
was afraid, intimidated and ashamed because she had
been arrested by federal agents in front of her son.

"She was really emotional and really hurt. She was
deeply offended that she would get arrested in front
of her child and be treated like a criminal," Hoyt
said. "She thought someone who comes here to work hard
at night so she can support her child is not a
criminal."

In the intervening years, however, she turned her pain
to activism, organizing the families of those being
deported, he said.

"I think she's an incredibly brave person who's put a
human face on the suffering of the undocumented in
this country and because of the cowardice of
politicians, many more families are going to be
destroyed and many more people are going to die on the
borders," Hoyt said. "America needs to look itself in
the face and ask if we want to be that kind of
country."

The church where Arellano sought sanctuary for the
last year became the command center where friends and
organizers gathered to plan a vigil on Sunday night to
show support for Arellano after her arrest.

Those who lived with her and knew her best at Alberto
United Methodist Church cried together and hugged each
other but quickly brushed aside the tears, channeling
their grief into action.

Less than an hour after the arrest, Jacobita Alonso
arrived at the front of the church in tears. For
several minutes, people inside the church struggled to
open the padlock on the gate that for a year had kept
Arellano protected from the outside.

Work immediately began for a vigil, from phone calls
to alert supporters to getting batteries for the
speakers they would use to take their message to the
street.

Jacobita Alonso, a lay leader at the church who stayed
with Arellano on the second-floor apartment over the
last year, felt propelled to action.

"We cannot sit here only grieving. All we can do is
organize our people. We want her to know she is not
alone. The community is crying. Her fight is a fight
for all people," she said Sunday. "There are thousands
of Elviras. There are thousands of mothers just like
Elvira who just want to keep their families together."

Alonso and a dozen other supporters sat in the
second-floor apartment where Arellano lived, watching
television news broadcasts and sending out messages by
e-mail.

The group has already organized a vigil for 7 p.m. at
the Immigration and Customs Enforcement office
downtown at Congress Parkway and Clark Street and
another at 9 a.m. at the same location to show support
for Arellano, but also to protest the arrest.

George Atkins sat in the sanctuary, quitely observing.

"I'm sad she was arrested, but I'm proud that she was
a member of this church and that I got to know her,"
Atkins said. "She always knew she could be arrested.
She could have slipped quietly into the night like
many others do but she chose to stand up for what she
believed in."

Questions swirled up and down the church stairs. What
would happen to Arellano's son? Where would Arellano
go? Alonso said the boy was with Lozano, her closest
advisor, but she wondered if he would be returned to
Chicago, as Arellano had expressed hope to her many
times before.

"All I can say is that miracles exist and we're
praying," Alonso said.

Amid heavy rainfall, about three dozen people sang,
prayed and read passages from the Bible during a vigil
tonight outside the ICE's Chicago headquarters, 536 S.
Clark St., to show their disapproval of her arrest.

One of the attendees, Ald. Ricardo Munoz (22nd), said,
"It's a sad day. We need comprehensive immigration
reform that keeps families together. A young boy, a
U.S. citizen, lost his mother to a broken system."

Munoz said, "Elvira has put a face to this struggle.
There are 12 million illegal immigrants that head to
work every morning, not knowing if they'll come home
at the end of the day."

He said other aldermen would be reaching out to U.S.
Sens. Dick Durbin and Barack Obama for help in
diffusing the situation, and preventing Arellano from
being deported.

Jorge Mujica, an organizer of the March 10 Committee,
which earlier this year set up a large scale protest
downtown advocating immigration reform, said Arellano
would not have been arrested in Chicago because she
has so much support from city officials and the Latino
community.

"They waited for the right time. She could not live in
the church forever," Mujica said.

Up until now, she had been a symbol of the immigration
debate, Mujica said. But now with her arrest she has
become a martyr because "she has suffered unjustly."

"People who had not heard of Elvira before are going
to hear her story and better understand the debate,"
Mujica said.

FIGURES FOR A DARKROOM VOICE
by Noah Eli Gordon & Joshua Marie Wilkinson
with images by Noah Saterstrom
Tarpaulin Sky Press
ISBN: 978-0-9779019-5-1
Poetry. 5.5" x 7", 94 pages

In FIGURES FOR A DARKROOM VOICE the rhetorical twisting of Noah Eli Gordon's
abstractions meld with the ominous narratives of Joshua Marie Wilkinson's
fragments, turning Wallace Steven's notion of a supreme fiction toward a
supreme friction, one where the work of these two poets is fused into a
voice as singular as it is sinister. Imagine a gallery in which Cornell
boxes talk back, a Maya Deren film in which the audience dissolves into
projector light, a Philip Glass composition played exclusively on medieval
weaponry, such are the compelling results of this collaborative work.

In prose poems, syntactically elusive sonnets, and haunting, haiku-like
fragments illuminated by the ink drawings of Noah Saterstrom, one encounters
a recurring cast of logically-skewed images, inauspicious yet arresting
aphorisms, and characters rendered fully bizarre in the lightest of
brushstrokes. Here, the slippage and disruptions of textually investigative
work collides with the mind-expanding project of conjuring paradox, while
never quite leaving linearity behind. When these poets write, "I am trying
to draw you a simple picture of explanation," one realizes the monumental
nature of such a task. And this task is made more complex, and ultimately
more rewarding, by the inclusion of Noah Saterstrom's dynamic images. "Who,"
Gordon and Wilkinson ask, "operates the levers in this darkroom dress-shop?"
Who, indeed! The rich history of literary collaboration just got richer.


These two guys tell us,
"There is nothing that summer can do to us
That we could not ourselves develop in the basement"
so we know
"the sleepwalkers enter a swimming pool
With their haggings& black dresses,"
"raising private horses"
Therefore it's true
"What mammal wouldn't want its own vibrant egg?"
They glitter. This book glitters.

About 18 months ago I published an experimental collaboration between Robert
Kelly and Birgit Kempker titled "Shame." For the occasion I issued a short
catalogue about that book and two other Kellys that we'd published
previously, "The Garden of Distances" (on drawings by Brigitte Mahlknecht)
and "Unquell the Dawn Now" (a homeophonic translation of Holderlin, with
Schuldt's subsequent elaborations), and including also an earlier "writing
through" piece that Kelly had performed on a poem by P.B. Shelley. For the
catalogue Kelly contributed by invitation four pieces of commentary,
description, reflection and theory about collaborative writing in general
and these in particular. Since these short texts have not appeared
elsewhere -- and I think listmembers may find them especially illuminating
and useful -- I've placed the catalogue on my site now as a PDF download
(about 385 kb):
https://www.mcphersonco.com/share/pdfs%20for%20website/Kelly%20Collaborations.pdf
I'd be happy to mail anyone on this list a copy of the remaining actual
catalogues -- simply e-mail me off-group your postal address (send to
bmcpher@verizon.net).

>=20

>=20

>=20

>=20
> Arellano had been cleaning planes at night, he said.
> At the time --"before she was famous," Hoyt noted--she

>=20
> "She was really emotional and really hurt. She was

>=20

>=20

**Olive Juice Music
http://olivejuicemusic.com/

Olive Juice Music is a D.I.Y. label, studio, and mail-order distributor
based in New York City and interested in helping people who are in the
developmental stages of trying to do something with their art. Olive Juice
Music is not a traditional record label. The artists associated with Olive
Juice take an active part in how their music is produced, financed, and
marketed. They in turn receive more of the profits gained from the sales of
their records directly, which is how it should be. The strength of Olive
Juice relies upon the active participation of its members to share resource=
s
and help promote a communal spirit among everyone involved as well as
claiming responsibility for taking their art to wherever they would like it
to go.


**Boog City
http://www.welcometoboogcity.com/

Boog City is a New York City-based small press now in its 16th year and Eas=
t
Village community newspaper of the same name. It has also published 35
volumes of poetry and various magazines, featuring work by Allen Ginsberg
and Lawrence Ferlinghetti among others, and theme issues on baseball,
women=A9=F6s writing, and Louisville, Ky. It hosts and curates two regular
performance series--d.a. levy lives: celebrating the renegade press, where
each month a non-NYC small press and its writers and a musical act of their
choosing is hosted at Chelsea's ACA Galleries; and Classic Albums Live,
where 5-13 local musical acts perform a classic album live at venues
including The Bowery Poetry Club, CBGB's, Cakeshop, and The Knitting
Factory. Past albums have included Elvis Costello, My Aim is True; Carole
King, Tapestry; Nirvana, Nevermind; and Liz Phair, Exile in Guyville.

**Jim Behrle
http://www.greatestlivingpoet.blogspot.com/
http://gawker.com/news/kreepie-kats/

Jim Behrle's She's My Best Friend was released in 2006 by Pressed
Wafer. His cartoons appear on Gawker, in The Stranger, and on his above
site.


**Allen Callaci
http://www.myspace.com/lonesomesurprise

Allen Callaci is the singer for the band Refrigerator who have been putting
lo-fi noise pop things out on Shrimper records (home of Herman Dune,
Mountain Goats, the Woods etc) since the crayola colored era of the
cassette. He is probably best known for appearing on the Mountain Goats
"Nine Black Poppies" CD on the Goat's cover of Refrigerator song "Lonesome
Surprise"...or maybe not. Mr. Callaci hails from the smog infested
tragically comic suburbs of Southern California's Inland Empire which
probably explains a lot...


**Toby Goodshank
http://www.myspace.com/tobygoodshank

A prolific performer, Goodshank inhabits the stages of NYC both solo and
with bands Double Deuce (along with sister Angela Babyskin) and The
Tri-Lambs (with Angela and her sister Crystal Babyskin). These projects hav=
e
"Goodshank" written all over them, with his signature heart-felt
pornographic tendencies lending the songs a sense of erotic wonder and
innocence. If Anti-Folk has ever known a legend in the making, destined to
have his records collected by the troubled teenagers of the future, it is
Toby Goodshank.

**Bob Hershon
http://www.thebrooklynrail.org/books/fall02/roberthershon.html

Robert Hershon is the author of 12 books of poetry, the newest being Calls
from the Outside World, (2006). Others include The German Lunatic and Into =
a
Punchline: Poems 1986-1996. His work has appeared in more than 40
anthologies and in such journals as American Poetry Review, Poetry
Northwest, The World, The Nation, TriQuarterly, Verse, Chicago Review, and
New American Writing. Among his awards are two Creative Writing Fellowships
from the National Endowment for the Arts and three from the New York
Foundation on the Arts.
=20
Hershon also serves as co-editor of Hanging Loose Press, one of the
country=A1=AFs oldest independent publishers. Hanging Loose has published a
magazine since 1966 and has done books since 1972, presenting the work of
such writers as Sherman Alexie, Ha Jin, Kimiko Hahn, Hettie Jones, Tony
Towle, Chuck Wachtel, Harvey Shapiro, and Paul Violi.
=20
Hershon has taught for Teachers & Writers Collaborative and Saint Ann=A1=AFs
School, as well as fulfilling shorter residencies at the University of
Michigan and the College of William and Mary. Since 1976, he has served as
executive director of The Print Center, Inc., a non-profit facility which
provides printing services to literary publishers, schools and colleges, an=
d
other arts and community organizations. He also curates the popular Poets
Coffeehouse reading series at the Brooklyn Public Library=A1=AFs main branch.
=20
He lives in Brooklyn, N.Y., with his wife, Donna Brook, a poet and
children=A1=AFs book author, and has two grown children.

colleagues and friends,

my blog is updated at www.peaceraptor.blogspot.com

brief statements on independence and autonomy
scrolling down, a brief meditation on my father, a chemist who worked in
copper and salt mines, and who was killed in 1981

other than that, a hiatus from online work until 2008, being on the road

peace, and on with the good work to stop all forms of totalitarian, military
agression

Dear Jim--

does this organization still exist?

trying to learn more of it online, the last dated entries for it i can
find are from October 2005

i noted on the information at your site that of phases listed as
having been completed, the last one seems to be 2004.

The funding for the first three years is listed as from the US State
Department and Ford Foundation.

Most of what is at the site seems to be about proposals, rather than
actual current or recent events. Is there any way to find out what the
current status is?

East Jerusalem, mentioned in one of the articles as being the source
for a student quote, is now almost impossible for Palestinians from
the outside to enter.  The new "Separation" road on which Palestians
are allowed to travel on the other side of a Wall --painted to
simulate mosaics--has only three exits in toto, none for East
Jerusalem.
(The road was featured in a front page story on the NY Times as i
recall 11 august 2007.)

The Wall, Security Fences, "Settlers Only" roads, continual
checkpoints and the annual growth rate in numbers of the illegal
settler population now exceeding that of Israel itself, have all put
so many obstacles in the way of Palestinians attending schools, tech
schools and Universities that the educational system for Palestinians,
along with everything else, is in ruins. (500, 000 in the West Bank
currently receive 67% of the amount of water per person per year
considered the minimum for human survival.  80% of Gaza is on the
verge of starvation. Demolitions, arrests, beatings, deaths from IDF
and settlers occur on a daily basis. Amnesty International has issued
Ethnic Cleansing calls for a stop a few days ago in the Jordan Valley.
The Knesset is debating a law prohibiting Israeli Abba citizens from
purchasing their own land from the National Public Lands in Israel. )
Just to get to a still existing school is becoming prohibitively
difficult, as well as more and more dangerous. (Amnesty International
reported that of 124 Palestinian children killed last year, 80 were
due to sniper fire from the IDF or settlers.  The children's fatal
wounds were in the area of the upper back and neck at base of the
skull. They had been shot from behind, execution style.)
A great number of schools throughout the Occupied Territories have
also been bulldozed, or appropriated by the IDF for surveillance
posts, or given to settlers to use for other purposes.

Education to bring understanding and a desire for peace is being
destroyed, while the seeds of hate, despair, death, are being sown.

Inside the Walled off out door prisons, without water, starving, shot
at, bombed, homes, hospitals, schools demolished, electricity long
gone,  continually threatened and bullied, arrested, disappeared, if
the prisoners turn against themselves, all the better for the warders.

Meanwhile, the Occupiers, the only nuclear power in the Mideast, now
the world's 4th largest exporter of weapons and security systems,
technologies, equipment will be receiving over 3 billion dollars a
year more in US military aid starting shortly.

U.S. deports sanctuary movement's symbol
By Elliot Spagat, Associated Press Writer
August 20, 2007

TIJUANA, Mexico --An illegal immigrant who took refuge
in a Chicago church for a year to avoid being
separated from her American-born son was deported from
the United States to Mexico, where she vowed Monday to
continue her campaign to change U.S. immigration laws.

Elvira Arellano, 32, became an activist and a national
symbol for illegal immigrant parents as she defied her
deportation order and spoke out from her sanctuary.
She announced last week that she was leaving the
Adalberto United Methodist Church to try to lobby U.S.
lawmakers.

She had just spoken at a Los Angeles rally when she
was arrested Sunday outside Our Lady Queen of Angels
church and deported, said the Rev. Walter Coleman,
pastor of Adalberto United Methodist.

"They were in a hurry to deport me because they saw
that I was threatening to mobilize and organize the
people to fight for legalization," Arellano said in
Spanish outside a Tijuana apartment building where she
was staying with a friend. "I have a fighting spirit
and I'm going to continue fighting."

Arellano, who said she is a single mother, left her
8-year-old son, Saul, in the care of Coelman's family.
She said he might be brought to her in Tijuana
sometime Monday.

"He is a little bit sick because of the situation we
find ourselves in," she said. "I'm going to ask if he
wants to stay with me or if he wants to return to his
school" in the United States.

The boy hid behind the pastor's wife and wiped away
tears during a news conference in Los Angeles. Mexican
authorities did not know the identity or whereabouts
of the boy's father, said Luis Cabrera, Mexico's
general consul in San Diego.

Opponents of illegal immigration said Arellano's
arrest was overdue, and a U.S. immigration official
said she had been a criminal fugitive.

Mexican authorities said the deportation highlighted a
need to overhaul U.S. immigration laws.

"It's tragic when a mother is separated from her son,"
Cabrera said.

Arellano asked to speak with Mexican officials in Los
Angeles but was denied, Cabrera said. She was not
given access until hours later, at San Diego's Otay
Mesa immigration detention center.

U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement was unaware
of any request that Arellano made to speak with
Mexican officials in Los Angeles, and Arellano was
given extensive access in San Diego Sunday night,
agency spokeswoman Lauren Mack said.

Arellano was deported at San Diego's San Ysidro border
crossing around 10 p.m. PDT after U.S. authorities
determined that she had exhausted her legal recourse.

"This was a very, very sensitive removal for us as
well as Mexico," Mack said.

Arellano said the deportation process was "very
quick."

She said she may return to her home in the Mexican
state of Michoacan and then return to Tijuana in
September for a demonstration coinciding with planned
immigration protests in the United States.

Jim Hayes, director of ICE in Los Angeles, said
"proper perspective" should be placed on the woman's
case. Using a false identity, as in the case of
Arellano, who was convicted of using someone else's
Social Security number, can be a threat to national
security, he said.

"We don't think she's a martyr," Hayes said. "She was
a criminal fugitive who is in violation of the law."

Anti-illegal immigrant groups applauded the arrest.

"Just because the woman has gone public and made an
issue of the fact that she is defying law doesn't mean
the government doesn't have to do its job," said Ira
Mehlman of the Federation for American Immigration
Reform.

Arellano arrived in Washington state illegally in
1997. She was soon deported to Mexico, but returned
and moved to Illinois in 2000, taking a job cleaning
planes at O'Hare International Airport.

She was arrested in 2002 at O'Hare and convicted of
working under a false Social Security number. She was
to surrender to authorities a year ago but instead
sought refuge at the church on Aug. 15, 2006.

Immigration activists said they will continue
Arellano's plan to go to Washington, D.C., and take
part in a prayer meeting and rally for immigration
reform on Sept. 12. They also called for a national
boycott on that date.

The sentiment was echoed outside an ICE office in
Chicago on Monday.

"Her voice will not be silenced," activist Jacobita
Alonzo told a crowd of about 50 supporters.

is anyone in List-land involved with this festival? I've been deputized =
by the Consul General of Norway to get the word out about Steinar =
Opstand, a Norwegian poet who is expected to attend... I can't find a =
formal website for the festival.=20

here's a piece by Opstand:

Jeg har delt kropp med enfoldige og opplyste
med straffed=F8mte og l=E6rde
men aldri har jeg forenklet min sjel
For gaven jeg fikk var enkelheten

Og det vi gir naturen f=E5r vi tilbake fra naturen
For naturen er et menneske
mindre enn et sandkorn og st=F8rre enn et fjell
Og kj=E6rligheten ligner synene til et jaget dyr

I enkelheten f=E5r enhver seire eller forg=E5
Jeg sukker, der andre roper
Jeg ler, der andre sovner
Jeg kysser =F8ynene dine og lukker mine



I have given my body to the ignorant and the enlightened=20
the sentenced and the studious=20
but I have never simplified my soul=20
For the gift I received was simplicity

And what we give to nature we receive from nature=20
For nature is a human being=20
smaller than a grain of sand and greater than a mountain=20
And love lies like the visions of a hunted animal=20

In simplicity all will triumph or perish=20
I sigh, while others shout=20
I laugh, while others sleep=20
I kiss your eyes and close mine=20

Apparently, announcements of blog writings are allowed by the List

 Liam Rector, a well-regarded poet and educator whose work appeared in
many distinguished publications, shot himself on Wednesday morning at
his home in Greenwich Village. He was 57.

  Mr. Rector, who had been treated for cancer and heart trouble in the
past, left a note in which he expressed distress over his health, his
wife, Tree Swenson, said.

  At his death, Mr. Rector was the director of the Writing Seminars at
Bennington College; he had founded the seminars there in 1994. He had
also taught at Columbia University, New School University, Emerson
College, and elsewhere.

  Mr. Rector's work appeared in The Paris Review, The New Republic,
Ploughshares, and other publications.

  He published three volumes of poetry: "The Sorrow of Architecture"
(Dragon Gate, 1984); "American Prodigal" (Story Line, 1994); and "The
Executive Director of the Fallen World" (University of Chicago, 2006).

  Reviewing "The Executive Director of the Fallen World" in the
Washington Post, Robert Pinsky said that Mr. Rector "expresses a
stringent yet generous tone toward the profane, ignoble world of his
title." He added: "There's a forgiving element, a sad shrug and smile,
in the idea that the vulnerabilities, failings, and dreams of our
early 20s persist, somewhere in us, for the rest of life."

  Ronald Edward Rector was born in Washington on Nov. 21, 1949; he
took the name Liam as an adult.

  Mr. Rector did undergraduate work at several colleges without
receiving a degree. He was nonetheless accepted for graduate work in
the Writing Seminars at Johns Hopkins University, from which he
received a master's degree in 1978.

  In 1992, he earned a master's in public administration from the
Kennedy School of Government at Harvard.

  Mr. Rector's first two marriages ended in divorce.

  Besides his wife, Swenson, the president and executive director of
the Academy of American Poets, Mr. Rector leaves a daughter from his
second marriage, Virginia of Brooklyn, and two stepbrothers.

I got a review copy of the book.  Frankly, it is sitting right here on
the floor next to me because I really don't know how to review such
censored material (the intro mentions that the people involved feel
the best poets detained are not included, because they and their poems
are too political, which in some ways seems another ploy).  It does
seem to have been published in order to sell books.  It is kind of
like the Romeo & Juliet story set in Boston flower shops I just read.
It is made for a book club discussion.  The book tells you the talking
points.

All best,
Catherine

THE SORROW AND THE FAST OF IT
by Nathalie Stephens

Nightboat Books
ISBN: 0976718553 or 978-0-976718550
Literature. 5.5" x 7", 108 pages
http://www.nightboat.org/The_Sorrow.htm

THE SORROW AND THE FAST OF IT exists in a middle place: an overlay of
indistinct geographies and trajectories. Strained between the bodies
of Nathalie and Nathana=EBl, between dissolution and abjection, between
the borders that limit the body in its built environment--the city and
its name(s), the countries, the border crossings--the narrative,
splintered and fractured, dislocates its own compulsion. This text
addresses the maddened and the maddening, but what is madness away
from the language(s) that might enclose it?

These finely calibrated, delicately gauged sentences =96 one could say
prose verses =96 walk along the echoic edges of urbanism. They compose a
book-length monologue that remains deeply solitary, even when it
modulates and reappears as erasure, or rather, corrective, into
dialogue. Attuned to a canine pitch beyond the threshold where pain
manifests in human organs, Nathalie Stephens navigates as a river a
close course over surfaces we may have overlooked without her guiding
voice, eye, and persistence, from source to sea. =09=09=09 =96 Matthew Goul=
ish

THE SORROW AND THE FAST OF IT is a severe and tender book in its
"incalculable" correspondence between ocean and ground; the one who
writes, and the one who receives. A "paper thin" and "fretting" text,
Nathalie Stephens writes from the city to where the road "caves in,"
breaking her own heart, and ours, in the process.  This is a necessary
work.
=96 Bhanu Kapil

The son-daughter of H=E9l=E8ne Cixous and Jean Genet, Stephens is obsessed
by breaking free, only to find herself broken, brakeless.  Eroded by
what she cannot erase, halved by a dual 'I,' she writes in a splayed
metropolis of traces and of trauma, where "it is reductive to speak
either of autonomy or a bind.  The madness disallows this."
=96 Andrew Zawacki, How2


Nathalie Stephens (Nathana=EBl) writes l'entre-genre in English and
French. She is the author of a dozen published works, including TOUCH
TO AFFLICTION, a finalist for the 2007 Lambda Literary Awards, PAPER
CITY, JE NATHANAEL, and L'INJURE, a finalist for the 2005 Prix
Alain-Grandbois and Prix Trillium. Born in Montreal, she currently
resides in Chicago, where she teaches at The School of the Art
Institute.

You can't trust those American angels.  They all work for the government and get paid by the number of people they turn in.  What a sin!  Children get abused, too.

U.S. deports sanctuary movement's symbol
By Elliot Spagat, Associated Press Writer
August 20, 2007

TIJUANA, Mexico --An illegal immigrant who took refuge
in a Chicago church for a year to avoid being
separated from her American-born son was deported from
the United States to Mexico, where she vowed Monday to
continue her campaign to change U.S. immigration laws.

Elvira Arellano, 32, became an activist and a national
symbol for illegal immigrant parents as she defied her
deportation order and spoke out from her sanctuary.
She announced last week that she was leaving the
Adalberto United Methodist Church to try to lobby U.S.
lawmakers.

She had just spoken at a Los Angeles rally when she
was arrested Sunday outside Our Lady Queen of Angels
church and deported, said the Rev. Walter Coleman,
pastor of Adalberto United Methodist.

"They were in a hurry to deport me because they saw
that I was threatening to mobilize and organize the
people to fight for legalization," Arellano said in
Spanish outside a Tijuana apartment building where she
was staying with a friend. "I have a fighting spirit
and I'm going to continue fighting."

Arellano, who said she is a single mother, left her
8-year-old son, Saul, in the care of Coelman's family.
She said he might be brought to her in Tijuana
sometime Monday.

"He is a little bit sick because of the situation we
find ourselves in," she said. "I'm going to ask if he
wants to stay with me or if he wants to return to his
school" in the United States.

The boy hid behind the pastor's wife and wiped away
tears during a news conference in Los Angeles. Mexican
authorities did not know the identity or whereabouts
of the boy's father, said Luis Cabrera, Mexico's
general consul in San Diego.

Opponents of illegal immigration said Arellano's
arrest was overdue, and a U.S. immigration official
said she had been a criminal fugitive.

Mexican authorities said the deportation highlighted a
need to overhaul U.S. immigration laws.

"It's tragic when a mother is separated from her son,"
Cabrera said.

Arellano asked to speak with Mexican officials in Los
Angeles but was denied, Cabrera said. She was not
given access until hours later, at San Diego's Otay
Mesa immigration detention center.

U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement was unaware
of any request that Arellano made to speak with
Mexican officials in Los Angeles, and Arellano was
given extensive access in San Diego Sunday night,
agency spokeswoman Lauren Mack said.

Arellano was deported at San Diego's San Ysidro border
crossing around 10 p.m. PDT after U.S. authorities
determined that she had exhausted her legal recourse.

"This was a very, very sensitive removal for us as
well as Mexico," Mack said.

Arellano said the deportation process was "very
quick."

She said she may return to her home in the Mexican
state of Michoacan and then return to Tijuana in
September for a demonstration coinciding with planned
immigration protests in the United States.

Jim Hayes, director of ICE in Los Angeles, said
"proper perspective" should be placed on the woman's
case. Using a false identity, as in the case of
Arellano, who was convicted of using someone else's
Social Security number, can be a threat to national
security, he said.

"We don't think she's a martyr," Hayes said. "She was
a criminal fugitive who is in violation of the law."

Anti-illegal immigrant groups applauded the arrest.

"Just because the woman has gone public and made an
issue of the fact that she is defying law doesn't mean
the government doesn't have to do its job," said Ira
Mehlman of the Federation for American Immigration
Reform.

Arellano arrived in Washington state illegally in
1997. She was soon deported to Mexico, but returned
and moved to Illinois in 2000, taking a job cleaning
planes at O'Hare International Airport.

She was arrested in 2002 at O'Hare and convicted of
working under a false Social Security number. She was
to surrender to authorities a year ago but instead
sought refuge at the church on Aug. 15, 2006.

Immigration activists said they will continue
Arellano's plan to go to Washington, D.C., and take
part in a prayer meeting and rally for immigration
reform on Sept. 12. They also called for a national
boycott on that date.

The sentiment was echoed outside an ICE office in
Chicago on Monday.

"Her voice will not be silenced," activist Jacobita
Alonzo told a crowd of about 50 supporters.

On the 80th anniversary of the deaths of two American political
prisoners, Sacco and
Vanzetti-

Highly recommend the book by Bruce Watson just out:  Sacco and
Vanzetti  The Men, the Murders and the Judgement of the World

 Ryan and Tom:

 Don't you both think that what you are thinking and saying here is
exactly what you are SUPPOSED to be thinking and saying?

"Chiasson's 'Forget Guantanamo Poetry' review"
(Ryan)

"I'm certainly not going to pay for it"

"And of course, it is suspect"
(Thomas Savage)

The Military and the Poetics Powers will both be proud of you!!

A "bad poetry" book by "bad" people held as "suspects" in the "bad"
prison and given a "bad" translation , a product of both the "bad"
Pentagon and "bad" poets/suspects and "bad" "exploiting" of the
situation.

A great victory for the safety and security of the American way, in
truth, justice and poetry!
No "terrorist" will be allowed to challenge the hegemony of American
poetics on our own shores!

you know, i really don't think this a US govt enterprise. that the
pentagon cleared a few poems doesn't make it a govt-sponsored or
govt-produced event.  i was skeptical too until i got the book. dan
chiasson was just sounding off and trying to find a way to not respond
from the heart.

The review of Poems from Guantanamo leaves me with the impression that what
is not in the book and why it is not in the book are at least as germane as
what is.

It's chilling, isn't it, when even poetry is shackled, gagged, and tortured.

That sort of repression is mainly associated with totalitarian regimes.

The silence is deafening.

David:

I don't find this review strange, but right to the point. You have to be =
living in an alternative universe to think that this book represents the =
real feelings of the prisoners. Not only was it censored, but the =
original language wasn't allowed to be published, on the pretense that =
it contains secret messages! What could the secret message possibly be =
from someone in prison for so many years? One wonders if this is =
paranoia, playacting, or just plain stupidity.=20
In any case, I think the review is basically sound, and that this book =
should not be taken seriously, certainly not by poets! If I have any =
problems with the review, it's with the author's contention that a poem =
can't reveal the reality of one's life. I think the opposite is true, =
only not in the case of this book.

Best,
Joel Weishaus

     It's been over a year now that the story as well as some of the
poems of this book have been making the news, and now come the
reviews, and even the posts here noting that the book is "suspect".
(After all, it IS written by "suspects"--!)"
      A book produced by the Pentagon, or a book of bad poetry by bad
people----already the poems are being put into their own form of
Guantanamo--the military-controlled translations, the use of the word
"suspect" with regards to a book of poetry by "suspects", the
immediate response that the poems are bad, and their only reason to be
read at all is that they issued from Guantanamo, a sort of curiosity
that in time--and the quicker the better!-- will be forgotten.
         The responses to the book only reinforce the military's
judgement--the work is "suspect"  (may contain hidden
messages/contains no message and/or formal qualities worthy of
attention)--it is "bad"--(written by a bunch of very bad guys/by a
bunch of bad poets) and, as the reviewer perhaps  subtly implies,
written by persons from cultures inferior to those of the Russian
Mandelstam or the Japanese interned by the Americans.  After all,
Russian and Japanese poetry is far better known to/by the American
reader than that of the languages and cultures of the prisoners.
         When Foucault wrote that the "author" is a product, a nexus,
of the discourses of her times, he could as well have included the
reader.  "Who reads?"  It's easy enough to figure out "who is reading"
in most cases, by the readers' responses.  It becomes more difficult
to tell "who" is reading when the interrogation light is turned on
oneself.  What a bunch of cobbled together nonsense, knee jerk
reactions, leanings on the authority of someone's theory or "Word",
adherences to an  ideology, a prejudice--spews forth like a burst
sewer main!  "Hard headed realists' clarities", "brutal analyses",
"convincing critiques", "radical readings"--how much of it is not just
regurgitated internalization of the discourses of one's personal
preference?  And how much of it is not based on a "willing suspension
of disbelief"--in other words, a belief in fictions which one takes as
facts, "truths", as "self-evident"?
       Hasn't this book been placed already in the position of being
"set up" to "fail"--in terms of "quality" and "quantity" also if
people know what's "good for them"?  One can pretty much imagine what
many a blog and web site, pundit and poet, will have to say ahead of
time about the weaknesses and failures of the book.  And its
"triumphs" it will immediately be pointed out, are all of them very
much "suspect".
          Who wins?  The "American discourse" so to speak, employed
with equal disdain by the military and the poetry community, as well
as a lot of people who won't want to read/see/hear the words of
"terrorists" or "Islamo-Fascists" or simply "Moslems" to begin with.
Once again "America" has triumphed!!  Even over a "triumph of the
human spirit"--something we know cannot belong--or be allowed to
belong-- to suspected terrorists, Moslems, or Third World persons all
supposedly violently opposed to OUR  definitions of "democracy",
"freedom", "post-avant poetry" "borders" and the like.
         The more one thinks about it, the more this book makes
America look Great, doesn't it?  Whichever way you look at it, "we"
come out looking even better than ever than "them". I mean isn't it
satisfying and somehow very myself-as-an-American confirming to find
out these bad guys are also bad poets?  And doesn't that put in their
place a bit all those "bleeding heart" types who will fall for any
kind of poetry providing it is written by the the "right kinds" of
subject positions?  Look how free "we" are--reading only the "right
kind" (the ood") poetry regardless of ideology, subject position and
so forth!  You see, the more the poets of Guantanamo "lose'"-the more
"we" all regardless of ( which American) point of view stand to gain!
      The Guantanamo book does however raise very interesting
questions regarding translation in times of War, and especially in the
loudly and long declared Wars Without End--the War on Poverty, War on
Drugs, War on Terrorism, a Trinity each of which effects greatly the
other.  The Imperialist American agenda abroad is just as much a War
at home, on those of the American people "not worth saving". The
"Health Care" system in this regard is really a program of eugenics,
working in tandem with the other methods of limiting the elite and
powerful of the society to the right few and their various sycophants,
assistants, collaborators, undertakers, prison wardens, media and
institutions.

   In light of these Wars,  i thought the review interesting as in
itself it creates its own possible "after" review or meta-review, in
many strange ways, among them the little discourse on translation.  I
recall reading in an article from last summer in it may have been the
Guardian----a little bit about one of the poets mentioned, the first
one of whom there was an account of having written his poetry incised
in styrofoam cups.  (A very interesting way to write in that one may
read it with the touch rather than the eyes alone; a haptic poetry,
literally--).  This particular poet was Pashtun, and what  to the
reviewer may seem hackneyed or trite phrases, in Pashtun and in the
other poetry traditions within which the prisoners write, these lines
are filled with centuries of echoes, allusions, references to
sites/sights/cites which are profoundly evocative of one's homeland
and personal home.  Even through the non-literary translations done by
military approved translators, there is always going to be a certain
amount of the poetry which slips through the bars, in between the
lines, as well as in the themselves.  Some of it may be recognized by
an attentive reader, and/or many other aspects be present even in a
poor translation, yet unrecognized due to a non-recognition of the
writer's culture.
         In other words, the poetry may be there, for all the
dis-translation and dissing, yet, just as the military feared, it is
camouflaged, hiding in plain sight, or long ago departed for parts
unknown, seen as clouds floating over a distant land by someone who
will recognize the poem from their friend, relative, fellow country
person.

        Artaud, in the Preface to The Theater and its Double:

                 Furthermore, when we speak the word "life," it must
be understood we are not referring to life as we know it from its
surface of fact, but to that fragile, fluctuating center which forms
never reach.  And if there is still one hellish, truly accursed thing
in our time, it is our artistic dallying with forms, instead of being
like victims burnt at the stake, signaling through the flames.

        Isn't this exactly what the criticisms of the book are all
about?  That is doesn't measure up in regards to the "artistic
dallying with forms" while all the while the visible/visible hooded
person's signals vanish behind the asphyxiating smokescreens which
have been deliberately cranked full mass and volume to hide them?
Isn't the discourse about the "bad" poetry and Pentagon interference
all a way to ignore that somewhere inside all the smokescreens there
is indeed someone burning at the stake?

      Obviously, someone must have seen Artaud in Dreyer's film La
Passion de Jeanne d'Arc--and doesn't want  any poet in "our custody"
to die a martyr, "signaling through the flames"!
        God forbid there be any interruption in "our" "artistic
dallying with forms"!


         An aspect of this that is quite striking is to find how
dangerous poetry can be not only to the military, who rightly know
that poetry can conceal messages they would rather not allow to get
out, but that this paranoia carries over to the reviewer also.  The
reviewer essays to restrict the poems within the limits of being
witness-only poetry--and not even very good witness poetry at that.
It's as though there is a fear that some form of otherness, if
unbounded from the restraints of a narrowly confined  genre, might
indeed be producing a poetry which he won't be able to hear,
understand, grasp--the same fear the military has.  Maybe these poets
in spite of everything just may be sending messages out there to
someone somewhere!  I.E someone reading them as poetry (in a
tradition, in a language) with far more depth than the reviewer will
allow them to have.
          The War on Terror,  of which the Guantanamo prisoner poets
are such a powerful, hooded, simultaneously visible/invisible example,
opens also the the mine fields of translation in relation to
"intelligence" and "news" as well as (and AS)  propaganda.  The War on
Terror, which would seem to require the most exacting forms of
intelligence and translation, instead seems to have taken an alternate
route--into the realms of controlled translations, deliberate
dis-translations, the removal of feared words and their replacement
with words giving a happier picture of things, or a more frightening,
as the occaision demands.  Translation--which, in the case of a great
many ancient and modern classics is always being done over and over
again--is always trying to keep pace with "today's new, modern usage"
and "latest researches and forms".  The same demands are put on
translations of intelligence and the news, and when one essays
filtering poetry through this, it begins to create a small to very
huge  disturbance of the methods of deceit  that are employed against
its supposed and feared methods of deceit.
      The language of poetry, already super charged, creates a
difficult problem for military translators used to identifying "hidden
messages" in a way oddly analogous to literary critics approaching a
text which they have a pre-formed intention towards--whether it be an
animus or a friendly welcome.  "Objectivity", which one would think
would be a goal of intelligence, starts to corrode, and in the
presence of poetry i think the corrosive effects are acting in ways
that the translators feel is getting a bit out of hand, though not
being able to identify quite where or in what way.
         In order to try to maintain control, the spin doctors go to
work, and the poetry is reconfigured, reworded, until it conforms as
closely as possible to the desired template. Even then, something in
its very awkwardness and "bad poetry-ness" seems to indicate that it
is still "suspect", that something is still "troubling".
        This same anxiety seems to be haunting the reviewer.  If the
texts can be kept confined to being witness poetry only, then he can
make a very easy judgement.  If they start to corrode the walls of
this further confinement, then he doesn't know what to do with them.
One gets a feeling that he would much rather keep things confined and
in that manner be done with the issue.  After all, the prisoners it is
implied are not Mandelstam, and not Japanese interned in
America--people who it seems to be implied are of a higher poetical
character than the prisoners of Gitmo.  The bios of these men seem
reassuringly simple to comprehend, while their poems do not. (Even if
they are "bad" poems--they keep inducing an anxiety, as though being
more "complex, ambiguous"  than they seem so obviously NOT to be.)
     Again, there is the feeling, as with the military, that somehow,
something is slipping through the critic's grasp and making its way
into the world where someone somewhere at sometime  will indeed
recognize it in some way.
         Translation itself with the War on Terror has become a
further field of manipulated and controlled propaganda--with
independent organizations attempting to get out alternate versions of
translations than does MEMRI, the mega mouthpiece for a good part of
the world's versions of texts from the Middle East that are used in
newspapers, radio, tv around the world.  MEMRI is known for subtly to
greatly altering articles to fit their agendas, as well as planting
stories in various Arabic and Farsi language newspapers and then
providing the "translations" (i.e. the "originals") of these very
stories to the world at large--again all done with an eye to the
agenda.  News becomes propaganda via dis/translation and the
translations/pre-writings of "real" fake stories planted in real
newspapers which are "found" and then "translated" into the readymade
original language as well as into others and then distributed
throughout the world as "real" news found in a real journal/online
site.
       The reader/listener/watcher of all this propaganda requires,
like the fiction reader, a "willing suspension of disbelief."  History
has proven over and over again that in times of fear, of concern for
Security of the Homeland, the willing suspension of disbelief is one
of  the first modes of response chosen by the majority of people.
Complete fictions trigger wars, hatreds, massive arms races, enormous
security and cleanup contracts, the building of corporate mercenary
forces above any law, national or international, the construction of
ever bigger and more lethal Walls.  No one running for office or in
office wants to look anything but tough on Crime, Dope, Terrorism,
Immigrants, the Poor, the Sick, all of them pitched into the same
roiling pot of gumbo.
     The "news" becomes a vast spectacle of partial facts, a few
"safe" facts, fictions, lies, distortions, all guaranteed to make one
feel "up to date" in the "most modern efficient way".  The tricks of
the intelligence community get fed back outwards into the news, to
effect events and opinions, ideas, which in turn effect actual events,
creating further distorted and falsified "translated" versions of
these.  To attempt to control and spin these continuous streams of
information, disinformation, dis-translation and out right fictions,
news organizations become ever more dependent on "government sources",
"intelligence briefings" which in turn feed them their own mixtures of
facts, fictions, disinformations.  The resultant texts are either
taken seriously or provide fresh fodder for comedy shows.  Either way,
the status quo is maintained.
       The continual fear is that for all the elaborate constructions
of fictional "intelligence" and "news"  there will always be something
that gets through unnoticed, igniting questions which need to be
muzzled, controlled, censored.

      Oddly, since the "free press"'s cited  (real or fake--) source
is claimed to be the enemy's newspaper/tv/radio/blog/web site in order
to give it "authenticity", it is considered on the one hand "false",
"suspect" and on the other "real", the "real voice of the Arab
world/street. These constructedly  fictional or severely
dis-translated as possible bits of "intelligence," these supposedly
hardened, "irrefutable" "facts" have the very instability they were
meant to replace and suppress. The constant fear that something will
"leak out" or "leak through" requires ever more vigilance,
surveillance, and ever more censorship.  Attacks need to be launched
on various individuals, presses, books, speakers, to discredit them
and silence their criticisms. Mass responses to such outbreaks of
criticism have to be contained by a deluge of media "reporting" and
"discussion" whose intent is to annihilate the
person/publication/professor/poet in question.  The fewer critics of
the fiction there are, the more the fiction can triumph. The more
emphatically and forcefully critics are made to disappear, the less
likely new ones are going to come forward and take a similar risk.
           In this way, the reader/writer may disagree in general but
not in the particulars with the viewpoints presented by the
controlling powers.  The responses of poets to the Guantanamo poems
may not be all that far at all from being nearly the same as the
military's.  "The poems are suspect".  "The poems are bad."  "I won't
buy the book."  "I won't read the book."  "I'll satirize the book."
          With the Guantanamo poets, the reviewer seems to have a fear
that poetry somehow has made it through every effort, including his
own, to muzzle it. For, after all, a great many poetries that have
endured through time and space have done just that. Don Quixote began
his chase after the "impossible dream" in a prison, and to quite some
astonishment found himself conquering the El Dorados of Broadway.  At
various times, any writer worth their salt was expected to have done a
good turn or two in prison!  Johnny Cash and Thoreau only needed one
night there to profoundly move millions with their jail inspired work.
The list of prison writings that are both powerful bearers of witness
and very good pieces of writing is very very large indeed.
      Perhaps, just as the military --and the reviewer--and
readers--feared, their is something there in the poems, which has yet
to be found--and yet that remains very much a question of who controls
the dis-translations and who --as a native speaker--will be able to
read through the English into the heart of the original languages of
composition, inside the manacles and under the hoods.  One can always
also "suspect" that concealed somewhere in the layerings of fictions,
constructions, censorings, dis-translations, there are still traces of
lines of poetry which have issued from the anarkeyological strati of a
"mother Earth" "mother tongue" and poetic tradition. Until one knows
much more what the poems are, passing a swift judgement on them seems
to be to participate in the discourses of power which Foucault thought
of in "Who is an author?"
        Because Who IS the Author here--the poet, the military, the
translator, the press, the publicity, the opinions of poets found
here, the reviewer, myself?  Because of the muzzling and censoring and
dis-translating of the poems, ironically the reader becomes very much
what a lot of theoretical-critical positions advocate--a co-producer
if not more of the (nearly absent, hooded, manacled) poem's "meaning,"
"quality," and "direction," "category," "value," "cliches,"
"witnessing."   The reader becomes complicit in the creating of the
poem as "bad," "suspect" in a way not too far removed from that of the
military.  The effort on both parts is to be able to render the poetry
as absolutely ineffectual as possible.  The worse, the weaker, the
more pathetic the poems can be made to be read and received, the
better and safer and more secure the good American reader/military can
feel. All is truly for the best in this best of all possible worlds!
        And American poetry is safe and "free" from the "threat" of
there being any "good" Guantanamo poetry, composed on what after all
are "our shores".

       If one finds "suspect" the Guantanamo poetry, why not subject
to an equally "suspect" level of investigatory consideration o the
news, the poetics,  the words of the "great leaders" in all walks of
American society and the arts  that everyday participate in the
construction of various levels of fictions one is supposed to
"willingly suspend one's disbelief" for?

     Earlier this year was the appearance of IMPOUNDED  Dorothea
Lange's Censored Photographs of Japanese American Internment Camps
with texts by Linda Gordon and Gary Y. Okihiro  .   97% of the books
images have never before been published.  The photos, shot primarily
in 1942, were never shown but for a very few, as Lange, despite
following the contrainsts placed on her choices of things to
photograph, still conveyed far too much of the reality of the camps.
Or--allowed the realities and people to express themselves too cleary
through her being open to what was being said.  What makes the book
even more haunting is the inclusion of the original titlings for each
photo, which give a "positive" light to the most grim, stark image.
The juxtapostion of image and official caption can be extremely
disturbing in a way no detourned caption could ever be.   Again, there
is the issue of translation--the photographic translation as it were,
then the military approved captions, then the present day texts. There
is also the fascinating ways in which these photos are finding their
way in a development of the methods and "look" of Lange's famous
Depression Era photos. Since the book gives one both the censored
images and the original military dis-translation captions, as well as
the contemporary commentary to put things in historical perspective,
it is perhaps prototype of what may or not become someday of the
Guantanamo poetry and the history of its censorings and final release
of the original poems, not just by the poets included in this book,
but all the poems by all the poets. It took over sixty years for
Lange's work to reach the American public--who knows when if ever the
same may be possible for the poetry?
       Another very interesting book of an American incarceration and
its expression in art that has many eerie foreshadowings of Guantanamo
is:  Warrior Artists Historic Cheyenne and Kiowa Indian Ledger Art
Drawn by Making Medicine and Zotom by Herman J. Viola with Commentary
by Joesph D. and George P. Horse Capture.  This is the story of the
capture, and thousand mile train and forced march journey of the
warriors and chiefs  of four tribes to the 17th Century Spanish-built
Fort Marion Prison in St. Augustine, Florida. There the Indians were
taught to read and write and speak some English, sing Christian hymns
and say the Lord's prayer, listen to sermons and be trained in the
discipline of the American army. They were also given pencil and paper
and the result was a flood of "ledger" books in which the lives of the
imprisoned "terrorists" are recorded.  (Some of the prisoners had
killed men, women and children settlers in an effort to stem the tide
of settlements and the attendant killing off of the buffalo and
Indians both. Others were teenagers who hadn't done a thing.  The
choosing of prisoners was done in a completely arbitrary way.)
           Translation with regards to the Indians involved
translating them into White terms, behaviours, handicrafts,
disciplines, religion and language.  If the former "savage" could be
rewritten into an acceptable, well behaved, simulation of a White--why
he or she could go free--i.e. be allowed to leave the prisons and go
live on the reservations where their families had already been shipped
off to. There, they were supposed to teach the ways of the Whites and
maintain discipline and order. This was hoped to be a "kinder,
gentler" way of vanishing the Indian than simply to continue killing
every last one of them.
          Better a poor imitation, a bad translation, of a White
version of being, safely confined on reservations, dependent on the
Bureau of Indian Affairs for food and aid, than a terrifying,
"terrorist" savage!
            So isn't it much better to have "bad" poetry from "bad"
people safely confined in Guantanamo, safely dis-translated, safely
dismissed, than to have to read the terrifying, "terrorist," "savage"
alternative?  Isn't it much better to "know" "our" poetry and ways
will always be better than "theirs"?
            After all, what could be more frightening than if the best
poet on American soil turned out to be an imprisoned "terrorist"
"suspect" or a reservation Indian?  What might happen to the "willing

            What if after all one was confronted with signalings

              Would the flames and signalings reveal too much of the
"still one hellish, truly ccursed thing,  . . our artistic dallying

what is not there (in the book) is more powerful than what is, from all
accounts. we use our imaginations on what is not there.

the unsaid. the invisible. the unknown. that everyone knows.

the poems from guantanamo are apparently most notable for their having been
detained. detained, shackled, gagged, and tortured. poetry itself detained.
as well as these men.

we are used to such things occuring in dictatorships and tyrannies. now in
the usa.

chilling.

so this book should be taken very seriously. not simply concerning what is
in it, but what isn't, and why it isn't there.

Mairead;

 If you mean the arguments around the book should be taken seriously, I
agree. If you mean the poetry should be taken seriously, I disagree.
Firstly, most of these poems, as I understand the situation, were not
written by poets. Thus, for a poet to take them seriously is like a
cosmologist taking the Book of Genesis seriously. Further, even those that
may have been written by persons of talent,  they are not their poems, but
fabrications made up by the military. The real poems and stories we will get
someday when these people are free to write them and publish them without
being censored by the very people who tortured them. You are right that it
does raise interesting questions, but political ones, not poetic ones.

my intuition is that you're mistaken, joel.

what's interesting in contemporary poetry, to me, is not usually the
well-crafted poem. though that can be interesting.

there are books being created now, such as ken goldsmith's work and, say,
kervinen's "(no subject)" that are of real interest but are quite different
from the well-crafted poem or novel or book.

just about everything is unsaid. i'm not sure what's really interesting
about all poetry is what's said. instead, it can be the inroads it makes
into the unsaid.

books are often famous not for what they say but as materializations of or
testaments to a situation or time or to people or peoples etc. or as objects
emblematic of a concept.

poets, when they are famous, are sometimes famous not so much for their
poetry as their place in a network or a movement or a demographic or
whatever.

part of what is significant in poetry is the nature of its intensities of
language, its relations with language, the way that language and its
contemporary states are drawn into the vortex of the poem or book or site or
whatever the manifestation of the language/poetry is.

the poems from guantanamo--the poems themselves and also the whole frame,
the whole situation--should be of deep concern, particularly in the usa.
poetry detained. poetry is detained not only in the usa but in other western
countries. not only poetry but art and thought. by the authorities? well
usually we are our own authorities, aren't we.

you speak of "the real poems and stories" as opposed to the "fabrications
made up by the military". it's of course true that the poems and stories in
the book are tortured by the military.

but perhaps what is significant is not the authenticity of the poems but the
nature of their inauthenticity. perhaps what is significant is not the poems
themselves, authentic or inauthentic but the whole complex of the situation,
situated as art. i know it is more of a sort of approach generally
associated with visual art than literary art, but it has its usefulness. in
this case, it allows us to see significance where a more traditional
literary approach to the well-crafted poem leaves us in a situation where,
as you say, we can only see the significance of the book in political terms,
not in relation to art and language.

i am uncomfortable with the aesthetic hierarchy espoused here, reified
in the word "talent." it is true that such a thing does and does not
exist, but it is certainly not  the only, or the most salient, criterion
by which we determine whether something has worth.  to reify the person
of the "poet," is , to my mind, even more dangerous. talk about
policing!  i do agree, though, that  discussions around the poetry is at
least as important as the poetry itself, but i might argue this about
any "poem."

On the 80th anniversary of the deaths of two American political
prisoners, Sacco and
Vanzetti-

Highly recommend the book by Bruce Watson just out:  Sacco and
Vanzetti  The Men, the Murders and the Judgement of the World

 Ryan and Tom:

 Don't you both think that what you are thinking and saying here is
exactly what you are SUPPOSED to be thinking and saying?

"Chiasson's 'Forget Guantanamo Poetry' review"
(Ryan)

"I'm certainly not going to pay for it"

"And of course, it is suspect"
(Thomas Savage)

The Military and the Poetics Powers will both be proud of you!!

A "bad poetry" book by "bad" people held as "suspects" in the "bad"
prison and given a "bad" translation , a product of both the "bad"
Pentagon and "bad" poets/suspects and "bad" "exploiting" of the
situation.

A great victory for the safety and security of the American way, in
truth, justice and poetry!
No "terrorist" will be allowed to challenge the hegemony of American
poetics on our own shores!

you know, i really don't think this a US govt enterprise. that the
pentagon cleared a few poems doesn't make it a govt-sponsored or
govt-produced event.  i was skeptical too until i got the book. dan
chiasson was just sounding off and trying to find a way to not respond
from the heart.

The review of Poems from Guantanamo leaves me with the impression that what
is not in the book and why it is not in the book are at least as germane as
what is.

It's chilling, isn't it, when even poetry is shackled, gagged, and tortured=
.

That sort of repression is mainly associated with totalitarian regimes.

The silence is deafening.

The Department of English invites applications for a
poet to join the MFA faculty at the level of Assistant
Professor, advanced Assistant, or new
Associate.

We are looking for a colleague of distinction,
although not necessarily seniority. Candidates should
have a strong record of publication (a minimum of one
book published or in press, two books preferred) & a
history of excellence in teaching. As a member of our
department, the candidate will teach graduate & &
undergraduate poetry workshops & other courses
reflecting his/her interests & departmental needs.

Members of the MFA Program share administrative
duties on a rotational basis, so evidence of
administrative talent & experience & willingness to
serve will augment an otherwise strong application.

Send letter of application, c.v., writing sample (no
more than 15 pages; published material only), &
evidence of teaching excellence to:
Professor Sidonie Smith, Chair
Dept of English Language & Literature
University of Michigan
3187 Angell Hall
Ann Arbor, MI 48109-1003
Attention: Recruitment Coordinator

Review of applications will begin September 30 &
continue until the position is filled.

In any case, I think the review is basically sound, and that this book =3D

Subject: Re: Poems From Guant=3D?ISO-8859-1?Q?=3DE1namo:?=3D /Lange' s Impo=
unded Photos/Warrior Artists

     It's been over a year now that the story as well as some of the
poems of this book have been making the news, and now come the
reviews, and even the posts here noting that the book is "suspect".
(After all, it IS written by "suspects"--!)"
      A book produced by the Pentagon, or a book of bad poetry by bad
people----already the poems are being put into their own form of
Guantanamo--the military-controlled translations, the use of the word
"suspect" with regards to a book of poetry by "suspects", the
immediate response that the poems are bad, and their only reason to be
read at all is that they issued from Guantanamo, a sort of curiosity
that in time--and the quicker the better!-- will be forgotten.
         The responses to the book only reinforce the military's
judgement--the work is "suspect"  (may contain hidden
messages/contains no message and/or formal qualities worthy of
attention)--it is "bad"--(written by a bunch of very bad guys/by a
bunch of bad poets) and, as the reviewer perhaps  subtly implies,
written by persons from cultures inferior to those of the Russian
Mandelstam or the Japanese interned by the Americans.  After all,
Russian and Japanese poetry is far better known to/by the American
reader than that of the languages and cultures of the prisoners.
         When Foucault wrote that the "author" is a product, a nexus,
of the discourses of her times, he could as well have included the
reader.  "Who reads?"  It's easy enough to figure out "who is reading"
in most cases, by the readers' responses.  It becomes more difficult
to tell "who" is reading when the interrogation light is turned on
oneself.  What a bunch of cobbled together nonsense, knee jerk
reactions, leanings on the authority of someone's theory or "Word",
adherences to an  ideology, a prejudice--spews forth like a burst
sewer main!  "Hard headed realists' clarities", "brutal analyses",
"convincing critiques", "radical readings"--how much of it is not just
regurgitated internalization of the discourses of one's personal
preference?  And how much of it is not based on a "willing suspension
of disbelief"--in other words, a belief in fictions which one takes as
facts, "truths", as "self-evident"?
       Hasn't this book been placed already in the position of being
"set up" to "fail"--in terms of "quality" and "quantity" also if
people know what's "good for them"?  One can pretty much imagine what
many a blog and web site, pundit and poet, will have to say ahead of
time about the weaknesses and failures of the book.  And its
"triumphs" it will immediately be pointed out, are all of them very
much "suspect".
          Who wins?  The "American discourse" so to speak, employed
with equal disdain by the military and the poetry community, as well
as a lot of people who won't want to read/see/hear the words of
"terrorists" or "Islamo-Fascists" or simply "Moslems" to begin with.
Once again "America" has triumphed!!  Even over a "triumph of the
human spirit"--something we know cannot belong--or be allowed to
belong-- to suspected terrorists, Moslems, or Third World persons all
supposedly violently opposed to OUR  definitions of "democracy",
"freedom", "post-avant poetry" "borders" and the like.
         The more one thinks about it, the more this book makes
America look Great, doesn't it?  Whichever way you look at it, "we"
come out looking even better than ever than "them". I mean isn't it
satisfying and somehow very myself-as-an-American confirming to find
out these bad guys are also bad poets?  And doesn't that put in their
place a bit all those "bleeding heart" types who will fall for any
kind of poetry providing it is written by the the "right kinds" of
subject positions?  Look how free "we" are--reading only the "right
kind" (the ood") poetry regardless of ideology, subject position and
so forth!  You see, the more the poets of Guantanamo "lose'"-the more
"we" all regardless of ( which American) point of view stand to gain!
      The Guantanamo book does however raise very interesting
questions regarding translation in times of War, and especially in the
loudly and long declared Wars Without End--the War on Poverty, War on
Drugs, War on Terrorism, a Trinity each of which effects greatly the
other.  The Imperialist American agenda abroad is just as much a War
at home, on those of the American people "not worth saving". The
"Health Care" system in this regard is really a program of eugenics,
working in tandem with the other methods of limiting the elite and
powerful of the society to the right few and their various sycophants,
assistants, collaborators, undertakers, prison wardens, media and
institutions.

   In light of these Wars,  i thought the review interesting as in
itself it creates its own possible "after" review or meta-review, in
many strange ways, among them the little discourse on translation.  I
recall reading in an article from last summer in it may have been the
Guardian----a little bit about one of the poets mentioned, the first
one of whom there was an account of having written his poetry incised
in styrofoam cups.  (A very interesting way to write in that one may
read it with the touch rather than the eyes alone; a haptic poetry,
literally--).  This particular poet was Pashtun, and what  to the
reviewer may seem hackneyed or trite phrases, in Pashtun and in the
other poetry traditions within which the prisoners write, these lines
are filled with centuries of echoes, allusions, references to
sites/sights/cites which are profoundly evocative of one's homeland
and personal home.  Even through the non-literary translations done by
military approved translators, there is always going to be a certain
amount of the poetry which slips through the bars, in between the
lines, as well as in the themselves.  Some of it may be recognized by
an attentive reader, and/or many other aspects be present even in a
poor translation, yet unrecognized due to a non-recognition of the
writer's culture.
         In other words, the poetry may be there, for all the
dis-translation and dissing, yet, just as the military feared, it is
camouflaged, hiding in plain sight, or long ago departed for parts
unknown, seen as clouds floating over a distant land by someone who
will recognize the poem from their friend, relative, fellow country
person.

        Artaud, in the Preface to The Theater and its Double:

                 Furthermore, when we speak the word "life," it must
be understood we are not referring to life as we know it from its
surface of fact, but to that fragile, fluctuating center which forms
never reach.  And if there is still one hellish, truly accursed thing
in our time, it is our artistic dallying with forms, instead of being
like victims burnt at the stake, signaling through the flames.

        Isn't this exactly what the criticisms of the book are all
about?  That is doesn't measure up in regards to the "artistic
dallying with forms" while all the while the visible/visible hooded
person's signals vanish behind the asphyxiating smokescreens which
have been deliberately cranked full mass and volume to hide them?
Isn't the discourse about the "bad" poetry and Pentagon interference
all a way to ignore that somewhere inside all the smokescreens there
is indeed someone burning at the stake?

      Obviously, someone must have seen Artaud in Dreyer's film La
Passion de Jeanne d'Arc--and doesn't want  any poet in "our custody"
to die a martyr, "signaling through the flames"!
        God forbid there be any interruption in "our" "artistic
dallying with forms"!


         An aspect of this that is quite striking is to find how
dangerous poetry can be not only to the military, who rightly know
that poetry can conceal messages they would rather not allow to get
out, but that this paranoia carries over to the reviewer also.  The
reviewer essays to restrict the poems within the limits of being
witness-only poetry--and not even very good witness poetry at that.
It's as though there is a fear that some form of otherness, if
unbounded from the restraints of a narrowly confined  genre, might
indeed be producing a poetry which he won't be able to hear,
understand, grasp--the same fear the military has.  Maybe these poets
in spite of everything just may be sending messages out there to
someone somewhere!  I.E someone reading them as poetry (in a
tradition, in a language) with far more depth than the reviewer will
allow them to have.
          The War on Terror,  of which the Guantanamo prisoner poets
are such a powerful, hooded, simultaneously visible/invisible example,
opens also the the mine fields of translation in relation to
"intelligence" and "news" as well as (and AS)  propaganda.  The War on
Terror, which would seem to require the most exacting forms of
intelligence and translation, instead seems to have taken an alternate
route--into the realms of controlled translations, deliberate
dis-translations, the removal of feared words and their replacement
with words giving a happier picture of things, or a more frightening,
as the occaision demands.  Translation--which, in the case of a great
many ancient and modern classics is always being done over and over
again--is always trying to keep pace with "today's new, modern usage"
and "latest researches and forms".  The same demands are put on
translations of intelligence and the news, and when one essays
filtering poetry through this, it begins to create a small to very
huge  disturbance of the methods of deceit  that are employed against
its supposed and feared methods of deceit.
      The language of poetry, already super charged, creates a
difficult problem for military translators used to identifying "hidden
messages" in a way oddly analogous to literary critics approaching a
text which they have a pre-formed intention towards--whether it be an
animus or a friendly welcome.  "Objectivity", which one would think
would be a goal of intelligence, starts to corrode, and in the
presence of poetry i think the corrosive effects are acting in ways
that the translators feel is getting a bit out of hand, though not
being able to identify quite where or in what way.
         In order to try to maintain control, the spin doctors go to
work, and the poetry is reconfigured, reworded, until it conforms as
closely as possible to the desired template. Even then, something in
its very awkwardness and "bad poetry-ness" seems to indicate that it
is still "suspect", that something is still "troubling".
        This same anxiety seems to be haunting the reviewer.  If the
texts can be kept confined to being witness poetry only, then he can
make a very easy judgement.  If they start to corrode the walls of
this further confinement, then he doesn't know what to do with them.
One gets a feeling that he would much rather keep things confined and
in that manner be done with the issue.  After all, the prisoners it is
implied are not Mandelstam, and not Japanese interned in
America--people who it seems to be implied are of a higher poetical
character than the prisoners of Gitmo.  The bios of these men seem
reassuringly simple to comprehend, while their poems do not. (Even if
they are "bad" poems--they keep inducing an anxiety, as though being
more "complex, ambiguous"  than they seem so obviously NOT to be.)
     Again, there is the feeling, as with the military, that somehow,
something is slipping through the critic's grasp and making its way
into the world where someone somewhere at sometime  will indeed
recognize it in some way.
         Translation itself with the War on Terror has become a
further field of manipulated and controlled propaganda--with
independent organizations attempting to get out alternate versions of
translations than does MEMRI, the mega mouthpiece for a good part of
the world's versions of texts from the Middle East that are used in
newspapers, radio, tv around the world.  MEMRI is known for subtly to
greatly altering articles to fit their agendas, as well as planting
stories in various Arabic and Farsi language newspapers and then
providing the "translations" (i.e. the "originals") of these very
stories to the world at large--again all done with an eye to the
agenda.  News becomes propaganda via dis/translation and the
translations/pre-writings of "real" fake stories planted in real
newspapers which are "found" and then "translated" into the readymade
original language as well as into others and then distributed
throughout the world as "real" news found in a real journal/online
site.
       The reader/listener/watcher of all this propaganda requires,
like the fiction reader, a "willing suspension of disbelief."  History
has proven over and over again that in times of fear, of concern for
Security of the Homeland, the willing suspension of disbelief is one
of  the first modes of response chosen by the majority of people.
Complete fictions trigger wars, hatreds, massive arms races, enormous
security and cleanup contracts, the building of corporate mercenary
forces above any law, national or international, the construction of
ever bigger and more lethal Walls.  No one running for office or in
office wants to look anything but tough on Crime, Dope, Terrorism,
Immigrants, the Poor, the Sick, all of them pitched into the same
roiling pot of gumbo.
     The "news" becomes a vast spectacle of partial facts, a few
"safe" facts, fictions, lies, distortions, all guaranteed to make one
feel "up to date" in the "most modern efficient way".  The tricks of
the intelligence community get fed back outwards into the news, to
effect events and opinions, ideas, which in turn effect actual events,
creating further distorted and falsified "translated" versions of
these.  To attempt to control and spin these continuous streams of
information, disinformation, dis-translation and out right fictions,
news organizations become ever more dependent on "government sources",
"intelligence briefings" which in turn feed them their own mixtures of
facts, fictions, disinformations.  The resultant texts are either
taken seriously or provide fresh fodder for comedy shows.  Either way,
the status quo is maintained.
       The continual fear is that for all the elaborate constructions
of fictional "intelligence" and "news"  there will always be something
that gets through unnoticed, igniting questions which need to be
muzzled, controlled, censored.

      Oddly, since the "free press"'s cited  (real or fake--) source
is claimed to be the enemy's newspaper/tv/radio/blog/web site in order
to give it "authenticity", it is considered on the one hand "false",
"suspect" and on the other "real", the "real voice of the Arab
world/street. These constructedly  fictional or severely
dis-translated as possible bits of "intelligence," these supposedly
hardened, "irrefutable" "facts" have the very instability they were
meant to replace and suppress. The constant fear that something will
"leak out" or "leak through" requires ever more vigilance,
surveillance, and ever more censorship.  Attacks need to be launched
on various individuals, presses, books, speakers, to discredit them
and silence their criticisms. Mass responses to such outbreaks of
criticism have to be contained by a deluge of media "reporting" and
"discussion" whose intent is to annihilate the
person/publication/professor/poet in question.  The fewer critics of
the fiction there are, the more the fiction can triumph. The more
emphatically and forcefully critics are made to disappear, the less
likely new ones are going to come forward and take a similar risk.
           In this way, the reader/writer may disagree in general but
not in the particulars with the viewpoints presented by the
controlling powers.  The responses of poets to the Guantanamo poems
may not be all that far at all from being nearly the same as the
military's.  "The poems are suspect".  "The poems are bad."  "I won't
buy the book."  "I won't read the book."  "I'll satirize the book."
          With the Guantanamo poets, the reviewer seems to have a fear
that poetry somehow has made it through every effort, including his
own, to muzzle it. For, after all, a great many poetries that have
endured through time and space have done just that. Don Quixote began
his chase after the "impossible dream" in a prison, and to quite some
astonishment found himself conquering the El Dorados of Broadway.  At
various times, any writer worth their salt was expected to have done a
good turn or two in prison!  Johnny Cash and Thoreau only needed one
night there to profoundly move millions with their jail inspired work.
The list of prison writings that are both powerful bearers of witness
and very good pieces of writing is very very large indeed.
      Perhaps, just as the military --and the reviewer--and
readers--feared, their is something there in the poems, which has yet
to be found--and yet that remains very much a question of who controls
the dis-translations and who --as a native speaker--will be able to
read through the English into the heart of the original languages of
composition, inside the manacles and under the hoods.  One can always
also "suspect" that concealed somewhere in the layerings of fictions,
constructions, censorings, dis-translations, there are still traces of
lines of poetry which have issued from the anarkeyological strati of a
"mother Earth" "mother tongue" and poetic tradition. Until one knows
much more what the poems are, passing a swift judgement on them seems
to be to participate in the discourses of power which Foucault thought
of in "Who is an author?"
        Because Who IS the Author here--the poet, the military, the
translator, the press, the publicity, the opinions of poets found
here, the reviewer, myself?  Because of the muzzling and censoring and
dis-translating of the poems, ironically the reader becomes very much
what a lot of theoretical-critical positions advocate--a co-producer
if not more of the (nearly absent, hooded, manacled) poem's "meaning,"
"quality," and "direction," "category," "value," "cliches,"
"witnessing."   The reader becomes complicit in the creating of the
poem as "bad," "suspect" in a way not too far removed from that of the
military.  The effort on both parts is to be able to render the poetry
as absolutely ineffectual as possible.  The worse, the weaker, the
more pathetic the poems can be made to be read and received, the
better and safer and more secure the good American reader/military can
feel. All is truly for the best in this best of all possible worlds!
        And American poetry is safe and "free" from the "threat" of
there being any "good" Guantanamo poetry, composed on what after all
are "our shores".

       If one finds "suspect" the Guantanamo poetry, why not subject
to an equally "suspect" level of investigatory consideration o the
news, the poetics,  the words of the "great leaders" in all walks of
American society and the arts  that everyday participate in the
construction of various levels of fictions one is supposed to
"willingly suspend one's disbelief" for?

     Earlier this year was the appearance of IMPOUNDED  Dorothea
Lange's Censored Photographs of Japanese American Internment Camps
with texts by Linda Gordon and Gary Y. Okihiro  .   97% of the books
images have never before been published.  The photos, shot primarily
in 1942, were never shown but for a very few, as Lange, despite
following the contrainsts placed on her choices of things to
photograph, still conveyed far too much of the reality of the camps.
Or--allowed the realities and people to express themselves too cleary
through her being open to what was being said.  What makes the book
even more haunting is the inclusion of the original titlings for each
photo, which give a "positive" light to the most grim, stark image.
The juxtapostion of image and official caption can be extremely
disturbing in a way no detourned caption could ever be.   Again, there
is the issue of translation--the photographic translation as it were,
then the military approved captions, then the present day texts. There
is also the fascinating ways in which these photos are finding their
way in a development of the methods and "look" of Lange's famous
Depression Era photos. Since the book gives one both the censored
images and the original military dis-translation captions, as well as
the contemporary commentary to put things in historical perspective,
it is perhaps prototype of what may or not become someday of the
Guantanamo poetry and the history of its censorings and final release
of the original poems, not just by the poets included in this book,
but all the poems by all the poets. It took over sixty years for
Lange's work to reach the American public--who knows when if ever the
same may be possible for the poetry?
       Another very interesting book of an American incarceration and
its expression in art that has many eerie foreshadowings of Guantanamo
is:  Warrior Artists Historic Cheyenne and Kiowa Indian Ledger Art
Drawn by Making Medicine and Zotom by Herman J. Viola with Commentary
by Joesph D. and George P. Horse Capture.  This is the story of the
capture, and thousand mile train and forced march journey of the
warriors and chiefs  of four tribes to the 17th Century Spanish-built
Fort Marion Prison in St. Augustine, Florida. There the Indians were
taught to read and write and speak some English, sing Christian hymns
and say the Lord's prayer, listen to sermons and be trained in the
discipline of the American army. They were also given pencil and paper
and the result was a flood of "ledger" books in which the lives of the
imprisoned "terrorists" are recorded.  (Some of the prisoners had
killed men, women and children settlers in an effort to stem the tide
of settlements and the attendant killing off of the buffalo and
Indians both. Others were teenagers who hadn't done a thing.  The
choosing of prisoners was done in a completely arbitrary way.)
           Translation with regards to the Indians involved
translating them into White terms, behaviours, handicrafts,
disciplines, religion and language.  If the former "savage" could be
rewritten into an acceptable, well behaved, simulation of a White--why
he or she could go free--i.e. be allowed to leave the prisons and go
live on the reservations where their families had already been shipped
off to. There, they were supposed to teach the ways of the Whites and
maintain discipline and order. This was hoped to be a "kinder,
gentler" way of vanishing the Indian than simply to continue killing
every last one of them.
          Better a poor imitation, a bad translation, of a White
version of being, safely confined on reservations, dependent on the
Bureau of Indian Affairs for food and aid, than a terrifying,
"terrorist" savage!
            So isn't it much better to have "bad" poetry from "bad"
people safely confined in Guantanamo, safely dis-translated, safely
dismissed, than to have to read the terrifying, "terrorist," "savage"
alternative?  Isn't it much better to "know" "our" poetry and ways
will always be better than "theirs"?
            After all, what could be more frightening than if the best
poet on American soil turned out to be an imprisoned "terrorist"
"suspect" or a reservation Indian?  What might happen to the "willing
suspension of disbelief" continually required to keep on believing in
the Empire's New Clothes, New Writing, New Threats, New Bread and
Circuses?
            What if after all one was confronted with signalings
through the flames, rather than smokescreens, Walls, border security
fences, prisons, distranslations, fictions, lies?
              Would the flames and signalings reveal too much of the
"still one hellish, truly ccursed thing,  . . our artistic dallying
after forms"?

I find the claim that this book shouldn't be taken seriously, "certainly =

not by poets," to be extraordinary.  The extent to which this book is =3D
embroiled in economic realities, both publishing and political, offers a =
=3D
very strong invitation to this poet, at least, to take it seriously.  =3D
Joel, why do you say the book shouldn't be taken seriously, "certainly not =

interesting to think and talk about, in my view; as does the tension =3D
between the stated and very visible challenges to its meaning, and all the =
=3D
less visible and apprehensible challenges.  It's like a cup which has lost =
=3D
every single drop of poetry, except one maybe -- or even just the smell of =
=3D
poetry in its pores.  Or maybe it's just a cup which, because it has been =

used to carry poetry, someone is still willing to carry.  There is =3D
meaning, maybe not centrally located.   In the short essays, it's clear =3D
how compromised the book is, yet it speaks.  Not fluently, but fluently.  =

David:

I don't find this review strange, but right to the point. You have to be =
=3D
living in an alternative universe to think that this book represents the =
=3D
real feelings of the prisoners. Not only was it censored, but the original =

language wasn't allowed to be published, on the pretense that it contains =

secret messages! What could the secret message possibly be from someone in =

=3D
just plain stupidity.=3D20
In any case, I think the review is basically sound, and that this book =3D
should not be taken seriously, certainly not by poets! If I have any =3D
problems with the review, it's with the author's contention that a poem =3D
can't reveal the reality of one's life. I think the opposite is true, only =

what is not there (in the book) is more powerful than what is, from all
accounts. we use our imaginations on what is not there.

the unsaid. the invisible. the unknown. that everyone knows.

the poems from guantanamo are apparently most notable for their having been
detained. detained, shackled, gagged, and tortured. poetry itself detained.
as well as these men.

we are used to such things occuring in dictatorships and tyrannies. now in

chilling.

so this book should be taken very seriously. not simply concerning what is
in it, but what isn't, and why it isn't there.

Mairead;

 If you mean the arguments around the book should be taken seriously, I
agree. If you mean the poetry should be taken seriously, I disagree.
Firstly, most of these poems, as I understand the situation, were not
written by poets. Thus, for a poet to take them seriously is like a
cosmologist taking the Book of Genesis seriously. Further, even those that
may have been written by persons of talent,  they are not their poems, but
fabrications made up by the military. The real poems and stories we will ge=
t
someday when these people are free to write them and publish them without
being censored by the very people who tortured them. You are right that it
does raise interesting questions, but political ones, not poetic ones.

Joel,

I don't get where you're coming from. The poems are indicative of what
can happen to language in such a repressive state of affairs as
Guantanamo. They don't need to be taken seriously as accomplished
works, but as a warning of how poetry can be misused, and what
official tampering with language and art looks like.

A good cosmologist should take the Book of Genesis seriously; not
because he or she believes that there is any scientific truth there,
but because one can only really understand one's own position after
absorbing other positions and realizing how they differ. Basic debate
tips, really.

I received the letters below from Joseph Parsons, Acquisitions Editor of the

our discussion, and my viewpoint, was based.

Dear Joel (if I may)--

I've been following the thread on the Buffalo listserv and wanted to correct
what I take to be a misconception on the part of many people.  The poems
were translated by linguists hired by the habeas attorneys, not by military
translators. The confusion may arise from the fact  that the linguists hold
"top secret" clearance, but the same is true  for the pro bono lawyers, one
of whom is Marc Falkoff, the volume  editor. All of the attorneys submitted
to background checks before
being cleared to represent their clients.

The poems that form the body of the book--and, I'd argue, it does a
disservice to critique the work without having read the essays that  appear
in the front and back--were submitted for release. How the PRT  (privilege
review teams) decided what would be cleared and what would  be held back is
unclear to all of us. According to Marc and the other  attorneys, there
seems to be little logic too it. In many cases, the  translations were
cleared but the Arabic or Pashto versions were not.  One poem in particular,
"The First Poem of My Life," was actually  retranslated by Flagg Miller from
the original Arabic and appears in
his form in the book. He deemed the remaining poems for which we had
originals in Arabic to be at worst workmanlike translations.

To fully appreciate the poems, it's worth reading Flagg's essay, which
places them in the context of traditional Arabic qasida verse. Meghan
O'Rourke, in contrast to Dan Chiasson, devotes some space to this theme.

(As an aside, the censorship reached absurb levels.  In one case, a  letter
from a child to her father being held in Guantanamo was  entirely redacted
except for "I love you dad." In another case, "One,  two, three, four, five.
Once I caught a fish alive" was redacted in a  letter from a child to a
father.)

What's key to keep in mind is that the translators were working  without the
benefit of their usual resources--dictionaries and other  supporting
material, for example--and had to make the best of it. In  every case, Marc
and the translation team reviewed the poems that  found their way into the
book and corrected whatever errors they were  able to identify. (It's worth
mentioning that Marc also holds a Ph.D.  in English literature and taught
for several years at Purchase before  going to law school, so he's not
simply dabbling in this.)

In any case, I resist the urge to interpose myself in these  discussion, but
in this case I decided to break my usual self-imposed  rule.

In response to a question I had on how the poems were chosen, Mr. Parsons
wrote: "It's difficult to answer that question of choice. In the case of the
choices we--Marc and I--made, it was simply a matter of publishing pretty
much everything we had. In a few cases--for instance, Moazzam Begg, who is
now free and back in the U.K.--we had handful of poems on hand and opted to
limit the number simply to keep the collection from being dominated by a
single poet.
As for what the Pentagon chose to release, I can't even venture a guess."

Jim,

This is a great post. Yes, the work of interest for me must be infested with
its times. "Infested" here is  both a positive and negative value, for what
it is, belonging to its time. What may belong to Guantanamo than suppression
and suffering, in your words Jim the absence around suffering.

Ciao,

Murat

I am not sure if a post i sent earlier re the Guantanamo poetry was
read or not re this discussion (it shows up on hotmail but not as yet
at gmail; sent 12 hours ago)--forgive me if i may repeat two or three
of its points while adding some others--

      Even though written by non-poets and distranslated via the
military approved translators, it has been noted in several pieces re
the Guantanamo Poetry that the writers were using images, forms,
allusions, meaphors, rhmes that are part of their traditional cultures
as well as that of Arabic literature.  A phrase which may come across
as trite and "bad poetry" --made worse by the distransaltions by non
literary translators--in the original language,  if Americans knew
more of the writer's literary traditions from which he or she is
drawing,  the same phrase would be seen to have a deeper and more
poetic reverberation, resonance, allusion and meaning. I think that
the rush to judgement that the poetry is "bad", "not poetry", is a
further form of muzzling, in that it assumes that there is no such use
of language and poetic culture being made by even non-poets who have
grow up immersed in a very immense literature, oral and written, as
well informed by the cadences, images, teachings of Islam and the
verses of the Koran.
      (Do not American poets draw on the images and cadences of their
religious texts, the Bible, Buddhist Sutras, American Indian sacred
songs, the majestic rhythms and call and response of the Black Church,
the frenzied and ecstatic speaking in tongues of Pentacostalism ,
Hindi chanting and song, Ginsberg's "Kaddish", the Kabbalah and Torah,
the sounds of the Cantor's phrasings used in the creation of poems?)
     I don't think the questions the book brings up are solely
political; I think many of them have very much to do with poetry, one
of the examples being the immediate  assumption that "non-poets" in
any culture don't have access to a great many poetic devices, images,
rhythms taken from their culture, cultural traditions and religious
texts, as well as song lyrics and the "brut" imagery sounds of
colloquial speech and slang. There is also the assumption that poets
writing from another culture somehow do not have a reason for using
the conventional seeming (to "us") imagery that they do, when it is
possible that for the writers the same line may be a correspondance
with a classical verse or famous contemporary poem, or one taught in
schools.
        The military, and as I wrote earlier, the times reviewer, and
I think many positions easily adopted re the poetry as "not poetry" or
"bad poetry" are based on the same fear--that there is indeed
something that is somehow getting through all the obstacles placed in
the writings' paths, some kind of "message" or "meaning" being
smuggled out in plain sight and being found and understood by someone
somewhere. That element which gets past all the censors and
non-literary translations, criticisms, may this not be what is at the
heart of poetry, in no matter how mangled and "bad" a form?  isn't
that what prompts the need to erect further barriers, such as poetry
cannot be made by non-poets.  Frankly, who is to say who can and
cannot make poetry?  Is poetry a kind of gated, heavily secured
community open to only the few?  Is this poetry "suspect" because the
writers are "suspects",  "terrorists", non-poets, poorly or
distranslated by non-literary translators?
 The doubled layering of non-poet and non-literary translator --who is
to say that poetry isn't capable of being created and communicated
nonetheless, in ways not recognized by the
  professional poet, literary critic, literary translator?  Isn't
there a fear in this poetic regard analogous to that of the military
in regards to messages, communiques, somehow getting past the best
professionals no matter how many boundaries are set up?  The
professional poet, like the professional military, has a fear of the
"insurgent," the (poetic) "terrorist," the person "not with us" but
"against us".
         The issue of the translations, thenon-literaryy translations
is  very "poetic" issue also.  A lot of "avant" poetry techniques for
a good hundred years have made use of various forms of "alternate" and
distorting translation in order to create
creative mistranslations" as well as censoring forms of non-literary
and/or distranslations, altering texts to fit better within a given
poetic ideology or canon, history or criticism, to overturn some other
text or create a missing text in a mosaic being arrayed to construct a
new genre or category.
      In fact, the Military's and lawyers'  use of non-literary
translators seems very much a kind of "avant" technique for the
creation of "post avant critiques of the discourses and disciplines of
translation"--a breaking down, a "transgressing" of borders, a
"rupturing" of categories, of norms, astonishingly like many an
example by a practicing, professional, certified poet. Aren't some of
the little writing exercises advocated here recently in Bernstein's
list not unlike this practice being used by the military and attorneys
military and othewise who had to be involved?  "Translate a poem from
a (poetic) language you don't really know"!  "Translate poems by
amateurs using non-literary techniques of composition in your own
language"!
"Translate poetry in a language you know written by amateurs in
conventional forms common to their language while doing everything you
can to break down the semblance of the poetic--conventional or
avant--in your own language"!
     Is there perhaps a fear on the part of the poetic that a book
which supposedly can be valued only by  being in the "witness"
category of writing may actually, via the military, attorneys,
agendas, be the product of the poetic's own ideas and practices of the
"post/avant"?
     In other words, yet again, that POETRY may have in spite of
everything made it past the censors, the guards, the critics, the
professional military and poets?

it is pretty interesting to consider as a book, as a poetry anthology.
 for example, it asks for you to read the cover copy, press release,
and intro more than most; it asks you to read the bios by putting them
before the poems by that poet, and by writing the bios in atypical
ways (also, they are in a different typeface and color, and flipping
through I saw one and thought, "oh a prose poem! how surprising from
arabic, and, you know, it was a BIO)

it does lay bare the political aspects of all antholgising, although
some publishers I know claim anthologies don't sell well, and others
say anthologies put their presses on the map, sell well, get
extraordinary distribution, etc.

I was initially reminded of the old short story anthologies from the
former "eastern bloc" -- I bought a lot of them, they had appealingly
scary bloody sickles and things on the covers, just the items to bring
to a catholic high school; on further reflection, perhaps like those
compilation albums from pretty awful metal bands in "CCCP"

All best,
Catherine

This is deeply saddening. I knew Grace a little and like I think
everyone who knew her at all I loved her. Totally without
affectation, and her spoken language was astonishingly the language
of her stories. Enormous generosity.

As someone who knew Grace Paley for fifty-five years (I met her when I was four years old) I am deeply sad to learn of her passing.  She was such a wonderful writer and a great person.  Although I knew her mostly when I was a child, I would see her at her readings and she would remember me.  Her books of short stories and poems will continue to shine for a long time.  Regards, Tom Savage

This obit overlooks the fact that Grace was also a wonderful poet--one who,
without simplifying or degrading the tasks proper to poetry, showed that
poets could and needed to be responsible to more than poetry.  "I wrote a
lot of poems, and I went to a lot of demonstrations," she said.  She was a
feminist who wrote great poems about fathers.  She was an environmentalist
who straddled the urban-rural divide--a poet laureate of Vermont, with
Yiddish roots and a green thumb.  And she was a fabulous performer: indeed,
a natural storyteller.  She wrote without sanctimony, with great wit and
humor, about all-too-human life in a more-than-human world.

Acclaimed Writer Grace Paley Dies at 84
By Adam Bernstein
Washington Post Staff Writer
Thursday, August 23, 2007; 12:14 PM

Grace Paley, 84, an American writer who achieved literary renown as a master
of the short story and forged a small but influential body of work that
illuminated the frustrations and joys of women's lives, died Aug. 22 at her
home in Thetford, Vt. She had breast cancer.

Ms. Paley's output was relatively small -- several dozen short stories as
well as a few collections of poetry and essays -- but the quality of her
work attracted superlatives from the country's brightest literary figures.

Novelist Philip Roth praised her "understanding of loneliness, lust,
selfishness and fatigue that is splendidly comic and unladylike." Writer
Susan Sontag called her "a rare kind of writer, a natural with a voice like
no one else's: funny, sad, lean, modest, energetic, acute."

Ms. Paley was often regarded as a feminist writer because her stories
brought rare and early insight into how urban women struggle with emotional
and physical vulnerabilities; demanding children and lovers; and absent,
often misogynistic husbands.

She found the feminist label confining, yet she gave credit to the movement
for elevating her stature. "Every woman writing in these years has had to
swim in the feminist wave," she wrote. "No matter what she thinks of it,
even if she bravely swims against it, she has been supported by it -- the
buoyancy, the noise, the saltiness."

Her earliest stories were rich in humor and irony. In "The Loudest Voice," a
Jewish child's vocal stamina makes her the ideal narrator of a school
Christmas play.

Ms. Paley gradually gave way to grimmer themes ranging from rape to mental
illness. She also ventured into character studies less driven by plot.

She tended to draw more mixed reviews for the later work. Still, Robert R.
Harris, an editor for the New York Times Book Review, once noted that Ms.
Paley's literary reputation remained largely untarnished because "her best
stories have staying power, and a few can justifiably be called brilliant."

Her first collection, "The Little Disturbances of Man" (1959) contained some
of her most anthologized works, including "Goodbye and Good Luck." The story
is narrated by the vivacious Rosie, who has a long affair with a married
Russian actor known as "the Valentino of Second Avenue."

"Goodbye and Good Luck" contained many of the hallmarks of her prose -- the
uncluttered sentences, the flawed but sympathetic female narrator and the
pitch-perfect Bronx street vernacular of her youth that U.S. poet laureate
Robert Pinsky once called "the lyrically yakking cadence of New York City
speech."

The title of the collection referred to a line in another short story, "An
Interest in Life," in which a housewife named Virginia sums up in the
opening sentences the husband who has deserted her: "My husband gave me a
broom one Christmas. This wasn't right. No one can tell me it was meant
kindly."

Virginia later takes a lover who discourages her from trying to get on a
game show called "Strike It Rich" because the program is meant to help
people who "really suffer" in natural catastrophes, not those enduring "the
little disturbances of man."

Ms. Paley wrote her fiction slowly and sparingly, spending a great deal of
time focused on her deepening political involvement as a pacifist concerned
with environmental and anti-military causes. There was a 15-year gap between
her first short-story collection and "Enormous Changes at the Last Minute"
(1974), which received mixed reviews as she experimented with style and
darker content.

The short-story collection "Later the Same Day" came out in 1985, the same
year as her book of poetry called "Leaning Forward." She also wrote "365
Reasons Not to Have Another War," published in 1989. In her fiction, she
often rekindled her alter-ego, a single mother named Faith, to comment on
sex, friendship and, ultimately, aging.

Although Ms. Paley once attempted a novel, she said she had no luck and
shrugged off the effort by saying "art is too long and life is too short."

She was the daughter of Jewish-Ukrainian immigrants who had been dedicated
anti-czarists and punished with exile. The family name was changed from
Gutzeit to Goodside upon arrival in New York. Her father, Isaac, became a
doctor and a painter.

Grace Goodside was born Dec. 11, 1922, in the Bronx. She later recalled the
neighborhood as "a world so dense with Jews that I thought we were the great
imposing majority."

As a child, she developed a keen ear for the Yiddish, Russian and broken
English spoken around her. A bright but indifferent student, she entered
Hunter College at 15 and was expelled the next year for absenteeism.

"I really went to school on poetry," she later told The Washington Post. In
the early 1940s, while working as a typist for an elevator repair company,
she studied under English poet W.H. Auden at the New School for Social
Research in New York.

She was deeply influenced by his criticism of her work. He advised her not
to borrow words from his prose, such as "subaltern," and instead find her
own voice.

In 1942, she married Jess Paley, a movie cameraman. They had two children
before divorcing, Nora Paley, now of Thetford, and Danny Paley, now of
Brooklyn, N.Y.

Besides those two children, survivors include her second husband, author
Robert Nichols, whom she married in 1972, of Thetford; three stepchildren,
Duncan Nichols of Thetford, Eliza Nichols of Manhattan, N.Y., and Kerstin
Nichols of Hartford, Vt.; and seven grandchildren.

As a young mother, Ms. Paley drifted away from writing for more than a
decade and became involved in community activism in Greenwich Village.

Then she had what she called "the first of two small lucks": a bout of flu
that kept her away from her children and gave her time to think and write;
and meeting a father of her children's friends who was an editor at
Doubleday. He encouraged her writing and ultimately urged Doubleday to
publish "The Little Disturbances of Man."

The book received elaborate praise and established her reputation. However,
Ms. Paley, who once described herself as "a somewhat combative pacifist and
cooperative anarchist," was willingly distracted from her writing by other
pursuits. She gave more attention to teaching fiction at Sarah Lawrence
College north of New York City and especially to her political activism.

During the Vietnam War, she encouraged young men to avoid military service,
participated in rallies against the war and in 1969 went to Hanoi as part of
a U.S. delegation to bring home prisoners of war.

She once spent time at Greenwich Village's Women's House of Detention for
blocking a military parade. She described her time there in the essay "Six
Days, Some Rememberings," noting among other things that the bullpen is "an
odd name for a women's holding facility."

In 1978, she and other members of the War Resisters League were arrested and
fined $100 for unlawful entry on the White House lawn and unfurling an
antinuclear banner. During this period, she also attended peace conferences
in the Soviet Union and El Salvador, meeting in the second with mothers of
the disappeared during a bloody anti-government struggle.

A New Yorker, she also maintained a second home in Vermont, where she
protested the war in Iraq in a low-key manner she once described as
"vigiling on the common."

Ms. Paley could talk wryly of her activism. In her introduction to the
"Greenwich Village Peace Center Cookbook," she warned the reader that "this
cookbook is for people who are not so neurotically antiauthoritarian as I am
-- to whom one can say, 'Add the juice of one lemon' without the furious
response, 'Is that a direct order?' "

A poem only has to be a good poem, whether by a "professional poet" or not.  Who makes this judgment?  All of us, each individually to him or her own self, and none of us.  The decision about what is "great" poetry is usually not up to us.  We get by by writing what we write.  Nevertheless, I'm astounded that the U.S. government has bothered to publish a book of poetry by Guantanamo detainees.  Of course, it's suspect as I said before.  But poetry usually being a very low priority in the U.S. of A., it's still surprising that this book, which I have not seen, has emerged at all.  Let us hope that all of the innocents who are held captive in Guantanamo are released soon, as well.  Regards, Tom Savage

Jim,

This is a great post. Yes, the work of interest for me must be infested with
its times. "Infested" here is both a positive and negative value, for what
it is, belonging to its time. What may belong to Guantanamo than suppression
and suffering, in your words Jim the absence around suffering.

Ciao,

Murat

fyi (I've probably mentioned this here before):=20

"poet, poem, poetry" derive from the Greek poiein, "to make", also "to =
cause, effect, create, render, grow, produce, invent..."=20

Greek pots were often signed by their makers "X me epoien" -- "X made =
me"

I bring this etymology forward to our time by seeing poetic work as a =
made thing, a crafted object -- while you can become a master =
craftsperson through diligent study of the way objects like this are =
made, someone else can just as easily pick up a lump of clay and mold =
their own pot with the same tools (their hands) as the master -- the =
result will be different from the master's, but (theoretically) it will =
still carry water.=20

based on this line of reasoning, the act of writing a poem makes the =
author a poet.=20

does this fit with what Maria is saying in her comment, or am I off on =
my own simplistic tangent?=20

You are off on your tangent which is not simplistic. There are other
definitions of poetry. I am also repeating myself, and I apologize to those
who did follow me before.

Dear David,

> does this organization still exist?

Yes, PRIME is still in existence. The next phase of the "Learning Each
Other's Historical Narrative" project is to build a Web site for the
Palestinian and Israeli High school teachers who teach
http://vispo.com/PRIME/leohn1.pdf . I'm hoping to be able to help them with
the site. Of course it will be in Arabic and Hebrew, mainly. But I can help
with design and perhaps programming, if appropriate.

> trying to learn more of it online, the last dated entries for it i can

Yes, that's right. The http://vispo.com/PRIME site is not, of course, their
central concern.

As you note in your post, things are pretty tough for this sort of
initiative. Peace-building in the Middle East. Hardest job in the world?
Pretty slow going, I think.

As you know, David, I forwarded your post to Dan and Sami, hoping one of
them might reply. But English is not their first language, so I think it's
tough for them to respond without a translator for their response.

Thanks for your great post, as always, though, David, and sorry I can't
address your post in more detail. I'm just their HTML guy for their site.
It's beyond me to try to address some of the issues you raise.

I while back, I offered some information related to an online debate related to the usefulness of the internet with regards to art. Most of the replies, and I chose to sit back on the discussion, seemed quite defensive (perhaps not surprisingly) and dismissive.

Anyway, here's another to ponder:

                                                                                                                                                                                                         Much like Friedrich Nietzsche, who scandalized 19th-century Europe by declaring that "God is dead," Mark Cuban has some bad news for all the true believers who are investing billions in the Web.

The internet is "dead and boring," Cuban says in an interview with Portfolio.com. "We have reached the point of diminishing returns with today's internet. The speed of broadband to your home won't increase much more in the next five years than it has in the last five years. That is not enough to work as a platform for new levels of applications that will require much, much higher levels of bandwidth."

Of course, the 49-year-old Cuban made his $2.3 billion fortune as an internet entrepreneur. In 1999, he and business partner Todd Wagner sold their Web TV company, Broadcast.com, to Yahoo for $5.7 billion in Yahoo stock, then cashed out before the tech market imploded -- leaving Cuban with plenty of money to buy a basketball team, the Dallas Mavericks; launch a high-definition television network, HDNet; hire Dan Rather; and start a vertically integrated entertainment company, 2929 Entertainment, that makes and distributes movies and owns a chain of theaters.

He apparently still has enough left over to bid on the Chicago Cubs, recently put on the block by the Tribune Co., though he's uncharacteristically mum about his plans. "If I told you I would have to kill you," says Cuban, who last month officially joined the list of prospective buyers by applying to Major League Baseball to examine the team's books. "I'm sworn to secrecy."

Answering questions by email from the Cayman Islands, where he was vacationing with his family and recovering from hip-replacement surgery, Cuban also shared his views on Rupert Murdoch's acquisition of the Wall Street Journal, Yahoo versus Google, day-trading, his personal investment strategy, and why he won't pull the plug on his much-criticized business journalism operation, Sharesleuth.com, in which he shorts companies that the site plans to trash-hoping to turn a tidy profit on his pre-publication insider knowledge.
Lloyd Grove: As recently as May 2007, you told the House Subcommittee on Telecommunications and the Internet that government policy could encourage internet providers to make the necessary investment in fiber optics to significantly increase bandwidth to home users, in line with industrialized nations such as Japan, Germany, and South Korea, and that the economic benefits would eventually outweigh the costs. But last month, you declared: “The internet is dead. It’s over.” You said it’s “for old people” and it’s a “stagnant consumer platform.” Did you change your mind between May and July? Who or what killed the internet? And aren’t you biting the hand that fed you?

Mark Cuban: The internet of today versus what I suggested to the committee would happen if internet speeds to the home increased to 1 gigabyte per second, is like comparing the plane Orville and Wilbur Wright built in 1903 to a brand-new Boeing.

We have reached a point of diminishing returns with today’s internet. The speed of broadband to your home won’t increase much more in the next five years than it has in the last five years. That is not enough to work as a platform for new levels of applications that will require much, much higher levels of bandwidth.

Broadband to the home isn’t fast enough for downloads of movies at DVD quality to be ubiquitous. That means it’s no longer a platform for technological innovation.

Think of it this way. Way back when, electricity changed the world. It was the platform for everything electronic that we do today. Do you get excited about electricity or is it just a utility? Maybe old people who remember the advent of electricity still get excited about it. No one else does.

The internet is in the same position today. It’s no longer an exciting platform for societal and business change. It’s a utility. It’s something that is exciting to people who remember the old days of the internet.

The only way to change that is to upgrade the platform for bandwidth transport across the country to a minimum of 1 gigabyte per second throughout to every home. At that point kids will come up with new and unique applications that we can’t imagine today. That’s when it becomes exciting. Until then, it’s dead and boring.

L.G.: What percentage of U.S. households have access to HDNet and HDNet Movies, and what will that number be a year from now, and when will there be 100 percent penetration? What percentage of households have HDTVs? Other than Time Warner, what other major cable providers carry your channels?

M.C.: Since we are on DirecTV and Dish Network, pretty much 100 percent have access to us. On the cable side, we are on Time Warner, Verizon, AT&T, Charter, Mediacom, Insight, and about 30 others in the U.S. as well as Canada; there is a full list at www.hd.net, or better yet, just call your cable, telco, or sat provider and just order us. It’s easy.



L.G.: Why the resistance from Comcast and Cablevision? How many viewers are actually watching HDNet programming? Where do you see HDNet in five years? And five years from now, will Dan Rather still have his own show on HDNet? M.C.: I don’t have exact viewership numbers; no one does. But where we are rated in and around L.A., we often, if not usually, have a bigger share of the HD viewing audience than the other networks: ESPN, Discovery, TNT, Universal, MTV, HBO, Showtime, Cinemax, and sometimes even more than the broadcast networks on weekends.

We plan on continuing to have great programming that people love to watch and growing our subscription base.

We are the only individually owned network available today. I think that puts us in a unique position. Sure, it’s tough competing against huge conglomerates like G.E. and Comcast-owned programming for carriage. No question they have the leverage and use it. But our viewers love us and we think that still counts for something, and fortunately we have great partners like DirecTV, Dish, Time Warner, Charter, Verizon, etc., that have happy HDNet subscribers because of our partnership.

And yes, we hope Dan Rather continues with Dan Rather Reports for another 100 years.

L.G.: How much of your time do you spend on—and how big an investment have you made in—2929 Entertainment?  Why movies? Why low-budget art-house movies? Are you in it for fun—and hanging out with George Clooney—or profit?

M.C.: Most of my time is spent on HDNet and the original movies that HDNet makes or buys for our unique Sneak Preview program (where we release movies to our HDNet subscribers and our partners up to two weeks before they are in theaters).

We have a vertically integrated entertainment company. We make movies; we show them in Landmark theaters; we show them on HDNet; we release them through our own DVD company, Magnolia Home Entertainment, and distribute them through Magnolia Pictures. Being vertically integrated gives us the unique opportunity to distribute our movies how and where we want to.

And low-budget? You need to do some homework. Have you seen Akeelah and the Bee, We Own the Night (which comes out October 12), Good Night, and Good Luck. We don’t make dumb-ass budget movies like some people. We make great movies at the budgets that give us the opportunity to make money.

L.G.: Has buying a distribution company and a chain of 57 theaters worked out well thus far?

M.C.: Yep. They are making money, and they give us the unique opportunity to control our product. No other studio can do a nationwide sneak preview of their movies like we can because no other studio owns a national theater chain. No network other than HDNet can offer Ultra V.O.D. [video on demand], where we allow our V.O.D. partners to sell movies two weeks before they are in theaters. Only HDNet can offer a sneak preview of a movie the Wednesday before it’s released in theaters.

The ability to offer consumers what they want is a great opportunity for us. If any other studio tried it, the other theater owners would boycott the studio in a heartbeat.

L.G.: And have you found customers willing to pay $30 (or more?) to see new releases on their HDTVs instead of $10 in see them in theaters?

M.C.: Yes. We give them a choice. If you have to hire a babysitter, pay for parking and then the movie, the $19.95 we now charge is cheap. If you want to go on a date and get out of the house away from the kids, then seeing a movie at a Landmark Theatre is a great date experience for grownups.

L.G.: In 2002, you criticized Yahoo  for having a bureaucratic, “consensus-first, action-second” culture that stymied the company’s success with Web TV shortly after you and Todd Wagner sold Broadcast.com to Yahoo for $5.7 billion. But you seemed optimistic about the company’s potential with a change in management. What’s your assessment of Yahoo’s performance and strategic direction in the five years since then? What were Terry Semel’s successes and failures? And what do you think Yahoo’s future holds?

M.C.: I have no idea. Jerry Yang is a smart guy, so if anyone can do well, he can. I think Yahoo’s real problem is that they are being compared to Google. Used to be that companies struggled in comparison to Yahoo; now Google is the top of the heap. At some point it will be someone else.



L.G.: Was Rupert Murdoch smart to spend $5 billion on Dow Jones and the Wall Street Journal?  Why or why not? How, for better or worse, will the Journal be transformed? If you were Murdoch, how would you integrate this acquisition into News Corp.’s journalistic enterprises, including the soon-to-launched Fox Business Channel, and what do you think of Murdoch’s stated plans to invest $200 million in the Journal’s online operations?

M.C.: He got a great bargain. The W.S.J., brand can be applied to all of his business operations. The Fox Business Channel can be the Wall Street Journal Channel and gain immediate credibility.

As far as how to integrate them, I have no idea, and Rupert doesn’t need my advice. There are things I know and things I don’t know. I don’t know the internals of Fox, so there is no reason to speculate.

L.G.: How much time do you spend day-trading?

M.C.: None, zero. I think only idiots day-trade. Over the last 10 years the business of trading stocks has been very specialized. There is more professional brainpower and money applied to picking stocks than ever before. Anyone who thinks they can beat the market day-trading over the long term is just waiting for their luck to run out.

L.G.: What percentage of your net worth do you have in the markets, versus C.D.’s and other risk-averse investments, and how do you decide where to put your money? What stocks do you like, dislike?

M.C.: I don’t know the percentages. I stay pretty conservative and try to stick to things that pay me rather than things I just pray go up because someone else decided to buy some shares.

I have some stock investments that I have made over the years but don’t look at them very often and haven’t traded them much if at all over the past few years.

L.G.: And most important, how have you done?

M.C.: I do fine. I bought things that paid dividends or interest, and they go up over time. I will take positions in strategic shorts, meaning I don’t go through and read all the S.E.C. filings. I look for companies that are out-and-out liars or are in a business that I don’t think has a future. (And no, I’m not going to name names. Companies that are shorted tend to put more effort into being litigious rather than spending time trying to actually run a profitable business.)

L.G.: Is the subprime-mortgage scare likely to have lasting impact on the Dow? Do you believe Bernanke and the Fed  have responded reasonably? Where do you think the markets are headed in the next few months? How should the average investor respond? Should any of this be of concern to a billionaire in the media, entertainment, or sports biz?

M.C.: I have no idea, and neither does anyone else. All I can say is to remember the months of July and August and how you felt every time you saw what the market was doing. Imprint the volatility and angst that most in the market felt in your brain. Then when one of these funds tries to come along and explain to you how wonderful buy-and-hold is and how it always works, think about these couple months. Then make a decision whether the upset stomach from watching the markets go up and down, plus the risk of losing some, or possibly all, your money, is worth the few percentage points you might make over the 5 percent or more a C.D. is paying.

L.G.: In July 2006, you launched Sharesleuth.com  with veteran business journalist Christopher Carey, with the stated goal of uncovering waste, fraud, and abuse in publicly traded companies. But business journalists quickly condemned you for your allegedly unethical plan to pay for the site with profits from shorting targeted companies in advance of publication. So far, Sharesleuth.com has investigated two public companies, Xethanol and UTEK, and their stock prices tumbled immediately after publication. This June, Sharesleuth.com attacked a private company, Orthopedic Development. A couple of weeks ago, on the occasion of Sharesleuth.com’s first anniversary, business blogger Gary Weiss  declared your venture “a flop in every way imaginable.” Anything you’d do differently with the benefit of hindsight? Has the site lived up to your expectations? You said you made around $90,000 by shorting Xethanol but were “underwater” on your UTEK trades. In the end, have you made or lost
 money, and beyond that, was your business model a P.R. mistake? Did you ever hear from the S.E.C. concerning your stock-shorting plan? Do you intend to continue with Sharesleuth.com, or will you pull the plug?

M.C.: Gary Weiss is a nice guy, and I actually like checking out and reading his blog. We agree on more than we disagree on, but Gary’s commenting on Sharesleuth is nothing more than trying to get his name in the paper or a magazine somewhere. Sharesleuth is doing everything it has set out to do. It is there to find companies that are not what they say they are. It is an approach that is not based on having to publish to a schedule or within a number of words. We can spend a year researching a company and write or not write, at our discretion. That freedom alone makes it a success. And as far as my profits on the site, I’ve more than covered my costs with trade ideas brought to me by Chris.

Our emphasis is not on the companies that will make me the most money; it’s on covering the companies that aren’t who they say they are.

Writing the truth about XNL and UTK was great. Making money made it a little nicer.

L.G.: You have said that you read four to five hours a day to keep up. Specifically what publications and websites do you read and visit regularly, and where else do you get your business information?

M.C.: Other than Portfolio? I can’t even begin to list them all. Technology, entertainment, sports, general business . . . Some that I read are Make; PC Magazine; CPU magazine; a Macintosh journal, I think; Adweek; Advertising Age; Film Journal [International]; the Producers Guild [newsletter]; HighDef; BusinessWeek; the Wall Street Journal; the New York Times; Good; Billboard; the Economist; Entertainment Weekly; TV Week; Multichannel News; Broadcasting & Cable; CableWorld; Variety; the Hollywood Reporter; MMA Worldwide; Tapout; Kagan reports; [Street & Smith’s] Sports Business Journal; Forbes; and Fortune—and that’s off the top of my head. Then I probably have RSS feeds from another 100 websites.


L.G.: What gets you out of bed in the morning, and what makes you enthused?

M.C.: All of it. I love challenges. I love challenging conventional wisdom. I love the satisfaction of being right and the motivation of being wrong.

L.G.: Aside from bad officiating against the Mavs, what makes you mad?

M.C.: I’m not a big fan of politicians and politics or bureaucrats in general, but generally, the only time I raise my voice is at a Mavs game. People always expect me to be volatile or outrageous, but I save it all for Mavs games or when I’m playing basketball. That’s when I let it all come out. It used to be during rugby games, when I played, but when I couldn’t play any longer, the Mavs became my outlet. What cracks up my friends and family is that they knew that I was the same way before I bought the team. I would be just as crazy, if not more so back then. There just weren’t any cameras pointed at me back then.

L.G.: What makes you scared? What do you lose sleep over?

M.C.: My family’s health.

L.G.: What’s going on with the Chicago Cubs?  The Tribune Co.has put the Cubs on the block as part of its agreement with Trib buyer Sam Zell, and last month you put yourself in the running to buy the team by submitting an application to Major League Baseball  to examine the books. Why would you want to buy the Cubs? The conventional wisdom is that the bidding will start at $600 million and may go as high as $1 billion. Are you seriously moving ahead? Can you afford it? And what, if anything, are you doing to convince Bud Selig and the M.L.B. establishment that, as an owner, you wouldn’t make their lives hell on earth?

M.C.: If I told you, I would have to kill you. I’m sworn to secrecy.

L.G.: Since you bought the Dallas Mavericks  in 2000 with $280 million of your Yahoo cash, you’ve turned the team from a ragtag bunch of losers into one of America’s more exciting sports franchises—and turned yourself into a brand-name celebrity. You’ve spent untold millions on players and facilities, and you’ve demonstrated brilliant showmanship and won over the fans. But are you making money? In general, can one make big bucks by owning a professional sports team—or is it more a vanity play for rich guys?

M.C.: I can make as much money as I want to from the Mavs. There is a tradeoff, however, between losing and maximizing tradeoffs. As I have said, my emotional release is with the Mavs, so winning is more important to me than making money. That said, I should make a few shekels this year.

L.G.: Given your storied antagonism for the refs of the N.B.A. and your sometimes fractious relationship with Commissioner David Stern—who has fined you approximately $1.5 million for voicing expletive-laced opinions on and off the court—the recent gambling scandal involving referee Tim Donaghy might have been a golden opportunity for you to say “I told you so.” Instead, as soon as the scandal broke, you expressed your “complete confidence” in Stern to “proactively put in place people, processes, and transparency that will forever silence those who will question the N.B.A.’s integrity,” and you added that “the N.B.A. and our officiating will be all the stronger for it.” Hey, Mark, what gives? Are you a changed man?

M.C.: Nope. I’ve said and done what I have said and done. There is no reason to rehash it. My goal has always been to make the league better, better as a business and better as a product for the fans. It makes no sense to look back. I think it’s smarter to take the hand you are dealt and make the most of it.

L.G.: On your blog, you seemed to suggest that Barry Bonds’ use of steroids shouldn’t detract from his accomplishment of breaking Hank Aaron’s non-steroid-enhanced home run record. “In 25 years, any controversy associated with Barry’s quest for the record will be long forgotten,” you wrote. What are you saying here? That in order to achieve our goals in this competitive world, we are justified in exploiting any advantage at our disposal, even if it’s against the rules? Where does one draw the line?

M.C.: I’m saying that the media tries to make a big issue out of things most fans couldn’t care less about. Back when Babe Ruth set the mark, there were allegations of every sort to explain why he was able to do things no other player was.

When my kids or grandkids look back on Barry Bonds, they will know him as the home run champ. They won’t invest the energy to try to find out what the context of the record was any more than any of us explore the context of when Ruth broke the record.

In reference to exploiting any means possible, that is an individual’s choice. Each person lives with the decisions they make. The only certainty is that no one really cares about how and why others, whether it’s Barry Bonds, Babe Ruth, or you&#8209;name&#8209;it, make the decisions they make, because they are nothing more or less than entertainers to us.

Just because the media depends on glorifying it for ratings and sales, doesn’t make it anything more than it really is. All you have to do is ask when a scandal had a negative impact on a sport or entertainment business. It certainly hasn’t been during the digital era of ultracompetitive media.

L.G.: How have you been spending your time in the Caymans? How’s the new hip?

M.C.: Hip is great. I’m working out every day. Two months in, and the only thing I can’t do is run, dunk, or cut with the ball like Barry Sanders :). I only wish I would have done it sooner.

Wandering Around an Albuquerque Airport Terminal
  by Naomi Shihab Nye

After learning my flight was detained 4 hours, I heard the announcement:
If anyone in the vicinity of gate 4-A understands any Arabic, please come
to the gate immediately.

Well -- one pauses these days. Gate 4-A was my own gate. I went there. An
older woman in full traditional Palestinian dress, just like my grandma
wore, was crumpled to the floor, wailing loudly. Help, said the flight
service person. Talk to her. What is her problem? We told her the flight
was going to be four hours late and she did this.

I put my arm around her and spoke to her haltingly. Shu dow-a,shu-biduck
habibti, stani stani schway, min fadlick, sho bit se-wee? The minute she
heard my words she knew -- however poorly used -- she stopped crying. She
thought our flight had been cancelled entirely. She needed to be in El
Paso for some major medical treatment the following day. I said no, no,
we're fine, you'll get there, just late, who is picking you up? Let's call
him and tell him. We called her son and I spoke with him in English.

I told him I would stay with his mother till we got on the plane and would
ride next to her. She talked to him. Then we called her other sons just
for the fun of it. Then we called my dad and he and she spoke for a while
in Arabic and found out of course they had ten shared friends. Then I
thought just for the heck of it why not call some Palestinian poets I know
and let them chat with her.

This all took up about 2 hours. She was laughing a lot by then. Telling
about her life. Answering questions.

She had pulled a sack of homemade mamool cookies -- little powdered sugar
crumbly mounds stuffed with dates and nuts -- out of her bag and was
offering them to all the women at the gate. To my amazement, not a single
woman declined one. It was like a sacrament. The traveler from Argentina,
the traveler from California, the lovely woman from Laredo -- we were all
covered with the same powdered sugar. And smiling. There are no better
cookies.

And then the airline broke out the free beverages from huge coolers --
non-alcoholic -- and the two little girls for our flight, one
African-American, one Mexican-American -- ran around serving us all apple
juice and lemonade and they were covered with powdered sugar, too. And I
noticed my new best friend -- by now we were holding hands -- had a potted
plant poking out of her bag, some medicinal thing, with green furry
leaves. Such an old country traveling tradition. Always carry a plant.
Always stay rooted to somewhere. And I looked around that gate of late and
weary ones and thought, this is the world I want to live in. The shared
world. Not a single person in this gate -- once the crying of confusion
stopped -- has seemed apprehensive about any other person. They took the
cookies. I wanted to hug all those other women, too. This can still
happen, anywhere.

Not everything is lost.

Thanks for your thoughtful comments.
A few students do seem to benefit--i.e., write more readily--from using
exers., &  give them as many as they like--but most don't. It's a matter of
sensibility, or once in a while of confidence--classical vs. free jazz,
maybe. One can give them optional exers.

Anny,=20

thanks for sending that link -- not surprisingly, the work of the =
Guant=E1namo prisoners/poets seems to meet most if not all of these =
criteria for being "poetry" (I also noticed that none of the quotes used =
the term "talent" when defining poetry)...=20

one aspect of written work (and poetry in particular) that I find =
fascinating is the way it is "handled," from the time it is first =
composed/created by the writer through the process of evaluation, =
editing, acceptance for publication, produced in a format available to a =
mass audience, and finally received by individual readers. each of these =
baffles or bottlenecks affects the nature of the piece, so that the =
final result(s) of the received work will be similar to but not the same =
as the original written object.

Robert Grenier's work gives one example of a limited process, whereas =
for the Guant=E1namo poets it's anyone's guess how much vetting was =
involved in getting the collection published. (I want to stress that =
neither example is more or less valid, on these terms: just processed =
and packaged differently.)

this is something I tend to focus on in my own critical reading: how did =
a given piece get to "where I'm at"?

I disagree that discussions around any poem are as important as the poem itself.  The poem or poems always take precedence over any verbal (live or in print) emanation which emerges as a result of their existence and is thus obviously dependent upon it.  As someone who writes poetry constantly and only occasionally criticism (usually reviews,only occasionally of poetry, available at Tribes.org), I don't see expository writing about poetry as being all that important, anyway.  The discussions on these listservs ( this one and Wryting-L) are entertaining and often informative but the poems themselves are ultimately what I and I believe all of us are truly about.  Regards, Tom Savage

based on this line of reasoning, the act of writing a poem makes the author a poet.

does this fit with what Maria is saying in her comment, or am I off on my own simplistic tangent?

Yesterday afternoon - from a return flight from abroad - I went through
customs clearance in San Francisco. My partner was - for no apparent reason
- told to put her bags through the screener. While I waited for her to go
with relative ease through this process, I watched an entire Arab family of
six or seven have their bags open and thoroughly investigated - the agents
rifling through everything in each suitcase, asking questions about jars and
containers with spices, etc.

At another, inspection station, I watched an agent take two books and a note
folder out of a man's brief case and then proceed to go through all the
pages of notes, and then leaf through the books. The uniformed inspector's
action gave me a very uncomfortable feeling - the sense of the State being
able to have the unquestionable right to go through private papers. I
suspect this is all done under the pretext that anyone is a potential
terrorist and its done for 'our' protection.

There is that sense of that thin line - the crossing of which becomes an act
of state terrorism in which we are terrorized by these folks that are given
this authority. What happens to your notes and books, for example, if you
are found at the border to be carrying notes that are critical of the Bush
regime, or the Christian Church, etc. And if you happen to be an Arab
visitor, or Chinese, or...let alone a USA citizen ??

Nye's piece - kind as it is - does not go there. I wish that it would.

Speaking as someone who is a legal guest worker in a foreign country, what
makes a person who enters a country illegally and then creates a false
identity (not her SSN) in order to work there ... what makes her an
"immigrant rights activist"?

Is it because of birth citizenship and the appeal to emotion? If a person
mothers or fathers a baby they should - for emotional reasons - share in the
baby's automatic citizenship?

Does a person's insistence to stay illegally in the US because her child was
born in the US make her an "immigrant rights activist"?

The US is rather unique in its practice of birth citizenship. I think most
of the world's countries do not practice this.

Does it make legal sense to restrict birth citizenship to people in the
country legally? Has the US passed the phase in its development when birth
citizenship was practical?

Or, are all Latin American non-citizens automatically "immigrant rights
activists" because the gringos are pillaging usurpers who stole the land
that Spain stole first? I've always liked that one.

I don't know.

I didn't watch/listen/read this unfold dramatically day-by-day, though it
was covered by Al Jazeera on TV here.

As I wander the globe and mingle in the situations of various expatriate
workers, I wonder about the immigrant worker situations in the US, and visas
and borders in general - if we can have a free-flow of global capital, why
not a free-flow of global labor?

Of course, as an "privileged American" I can't compare my experiences with
most others, can I? Almost any country will let me in and most of those
would give me a work visa.

Or maybe I've also just grown less sentimental.

If the US could run a guest worker program without the indentured servitude
experienced by South Asians in the Arabian Gulf, we could avoid some of this
pain. Maybe.

Mother Teresa's Crisis of Faith -
By David Van BiemaJesus has a very special love for you. As for me, the silence and the emptiness is so great that I look and do not see, listen and do not hear.
 — Mother Teresa to the Rev. Michael Van Der Peet, September 1979

 On Dec. 11, 1979, Mother Teresa, the "Saint of the Gutters," went to Oslo. Dressed in her signature blue-bordered sari and shod in sandals despite below-zero temperatures, the former Agnes Bojaxhiu received that ultimate worldly accolade, the Nobel Peace Prize. In her acceptance lecture, Teresa, whose Missionaries of Charity had grown from a one-woman folly in Calcutta in 1948 into a global beacon of self-abnegating care, delivered the kind of message the world had come to expect from her. "It is not enough for us to say, 'I love God, but I do not love my neighbor,'" she said, since in dying on the Cross, God had "[made] himself the hungry one — the naked one — the homeless one." Jesus' hunger, she said, is what "you and I must find" and alleviate. She condemned abortion and bemoaned youthful drug addiction in the West. Finally, she suggested that the upcoming Christmas holiday should remind the world "that radiating joy is real" because Christ is everywhere — "Christ in
 our hearts, Christ in the poor we meet, Christ in the smile we give and in the smile that we receive."
 Yet less than three months earlier, in a letter to a spiritual confidant, the Rev. Michael van der Peet, that is only now being made public, she wrote with weary familiarity of a different Christ, an absent one. "Jesus has a very special love for you," she assured Van der Peet. "[But] as for me, the silence and the emptiness is so great, that I look and do not see, — Listen and do not hear — the tongue moves [in prayer] but does not speak ... I want you to pray for me — that I let Him have [a] free hand."
 The two statements, 11 weeks apart, are extravagantly dissonant. The first is typical of the woman the world thought it knew. The second sounds as though it had wandered in from some 1950s existentialist drama. Together they suggest a startling portrait in self-contradiction — that one of the great human icons of the past 100 years, whose remarkable deeds seemed inextricably connected to her closeness to God and who was routinely observed in silent and seemingly peaceful prayer by her associates as well as the television camera, was living out a very different spiritual reality privately, an arid landscape from which the deity had disappeared.
  And in fact, that appears to be the case. A new, innocuously titled book, Mother Teresa: Come Be My Light (Doubleday), consisting primarily of correspondence between Teresa and her confessors and superiors over a period of 66 years, provides the spiritual counterpoint to a life known mostly through its works. The letters, many of them preserved against her wishes (she had requested that they be destroyed but was overruled by her church), reveal that for the last nearly half-century of her life she felt no presence of God whatsoever — or, as the book's compiler and editor, the Rev. Brian Kolodiejchuk, writes, "neither in her heart or in the eucharist."
  That absence seems to have started at almost precisely the time she began tending the poor and dying in Calcutta, and — except for a five-week break in 1959 — never abated. Although perpetually cheery in public, the Teresa of the letters lived in a state of deep and abiding spiritual pain. In more than 40 communications, many of which have never before been published, she bemoans the "dryness," "darkness," "loneliness" and "torture" she is undergoing. She compares the experience to hell and at one point says it has driven her to doubt the existence of heaven and even of God. She is acutely aware of the discrepancy between her inner state and her public demeanor. "The smile," she writes, is "a mask" or "a cloak that covers everything." Similarly, she wonders whether she is engaged in verbal deception. "I spoke as if my very heart was in love with God — tender, personal love," she remarks to an adviser. "If you were [there], you would have said, 'What hypocrisy.'" Says the
 Rev. James Martin, an editor at the Jesuit magazine America and the author of My Life with the Saints, a book that dealt with far briefer reports in 2003 of Teresa's doubts: "I've never read a saint's life where the saint has such an intense spiritual darkness. No one knew she was that tormented." Recalls Kolodiejchuk, Come Be My Light's editor: "I read one letter to the Sisters [of Teresa's Missionaries of Charity], and their mouths just dropped open. It will give a whole new dimension to the way people understand her."
 The book is hardly the work of some antireligious investigative reporter who Dumpster-dived for Teresa's correspondence. Kolodiejchuk, a senior Missionaries of Charity member, is her postulator, responsible for petitioning for her sainthood and collecting the supporting materials. (Thus far she has been beatified; the next step is canonization.) The letters in the book were gathered as part of that process.
  The church anticipates spiritually fallow periods. Indeed, the Spanish mystic St. John of the Cross in the 16th century coined the term the "dark night" of the soul to describe a characteristic stage in the growth of some spiritual masters. Teresa's may be the most extensive such case on record. (The "dark night" of the 18th century mystic St. Paul of the Cross lasted 45 years; he ultimately recovered.) Yet Kolodiejchuk sees it in St. John's context, as darkness within faith. Teresa found ways, starting in the early 1960s, to live with it and abandoned neither her belief nor her work. Kolodiejchuk produced the book as proof of the faith-filled perseverance that he sees as her most spiritually heroic act.
  Two very different Catholics predict that the book will be a landmark. The Rev. Matthew Lamb, chairman of the theology department at the conservative Ave Maria University in Florida, thinks Come Be My Light will eventually rank with St. Augustine's Confessions and Thomas Merton's The Seven Storey Mountain as an autobiography of spiritual ascent. Martin of America, a much more liberal institution, calls the book "a new ministry for Mother Teresa, a written ministry of her interior life," and says, "It may be remembered as just as important as her ministry to the poor. It would be a ministry to people who had experienced some doubt, some absence of God in their lives. And you know who that is? Everybody. Atheists, doubters, seekers, believers, everyone."
  Not all atheists and doubters will agree. Both Kolodiejchuk and Martin assume that Teresa's inability to perceive Christ in her life did not mean he wasn't there. In fact, they see his absence as part of the divine gift that enabled her to do great work. But to the U.S.'s increasingly assertive cadre of atheists, that argument will seem absurd. They will see the book's Teresa more like the woman in the archetypal country-and-western song who holds a torch for her husband 30 years after he left to buy a pack of cigarettes and never returned. Says Christopher Hitchens, author of The Missionary Position, a scathing polemic on Teresa, and more recently of the atheist manifesto God Is Not Great: "She was no more exempt from the realization that religion is a human fabrication than any other person, and that her attempted cure was more and more professions of faith could only have deepened the pit that she had dug for herself." Meanwhile, some familiar with the smiling mother's
 extraordinary drive may diagnose her condition less as a gift of God than as a subconscious attempt at the most radical kind of humility: she punished herself with a crippling failure to counterbalance her great successes.
  Come Be My Light is that rare thing, a posthumous autobiography that could cause a wholesale reconsideration of a major public figure — one way or another. It raises questions about God and faith, the engine behind great achievement, and the persistence of love, divine and human. That it does so not in any organized, intentional form but as a hodgepodge of desperate notes not intended for daylight should leave readers only more convinced that it is authentic — and that they are, somewhat shockingly, touching the true inner life of a modern saint.
   Prequel: Near Ecstatic Communion
   [Jesus:] Wilt thou refuse to do this for me? ... You have become my Spouse for my love — you have come to India for Me. The thirst you had for souls brought you so far — Are you afraid to take one more step for Your Spouse — for me — for souls? Is your generosity grown cold? Am I a second to you?
 [Teresa:] Jesus, my own Jesus — I am only Thine — I am so stupid — I do not know what to say but do with me whatever You wish — as You wish — as long as you wish. [But] why can't I be a perfect Loreto Nun — here — why can't I be like everybody else.
 [Jesus:] I want Indian Nuns, Missionaries of Charity, who would be my fire of love amongst the poor, the sick, the dying and the little children ... You are I know the most incapable person — weak and sinful but just because you are that — I want to use You for My glory. Wilt thou refuse?
 — in a prayer dialogue recounted to Archbishop Ferdinand Perier, January 1947    On Sept. 10, 1946, after 17 years as a teacher in Calcutta with the Loreto Sisters (an uncloistered, education-oriented community based in Ireland), Mother Mary Teresa, 36, took the 400-mile (645-km) train trip to Darjeeling. She had been working herself sick, and her superiors ordered her to relax during her annual retreat in the Himalayan foothills. On the ride out, she reported, Christ spoke to her. He called her to abandon teaching and work instead in "the slums" of the city, dealing directly with "the poorest of the poor" — the sick, the dying, beggars and street children. "Come, Come, carry Me into the holes of the poor," he told her. "Come be My light." The goal was to be both material and evangelistic — as Kolodiejchuk puts it, "to help them live their lives with dignity [and so] encounter God's infinite love, and having come to know Him, to love and serve Him in return."
 It was wildly audacious — an unfunded, single-handed crusade (Teresa stipulated that she and her nuns would share their beneficiaries' poverty and started out alone) to provide individualized service to the poorest in a poor city made desperate by riots. The local Archbishop, Ferdinand Périer, was initially skeptical. But her letters to him, preserved, illustrate two linked characteristics — extreme tenacity and a profound personal bond to Christ. When Périer hesitated, Teresa, while calling herself a "little nothing," bombarded him with notes suggesting that he refer the question to an escalating list of authorities — the local apostolic delegation, her Mother General, the Pope. And when she felt all else had failed, she revealed the spiritual topper: a dramatic (melodramatic, really) dialogue with a "Voice" she eventually revealed to be Christ's. It ended with Jesus' emphatic reiteration of his call to her: "You are I know the most incapable person — weak and sinful but
 just because you are that — I want to use You for My glory. Wilt thou refuse?"
 Mother Teresa had visions, including one of herself conversing with Christ on the Cross. Her confessor, Father Celeste Van Exem, was convinced that her mystical experiences were genuine. "[Her] union with Our Lord has been continual and so deep and violent that rapture does not seem very far," he commented. Teresa later wrote simply, "Jesus gave Himself to me."
 Then on Jan. 6, 1948, Périer, after consulting the Vatican, finally gave permission for Teresa to embark on her second calling. And Jesus took himself away again.
    The Onset
    Lord, my God, who am I that You should forsake me? The Child of your Love — and now become as the most hated one — the one — You have thrown away as unwanted — unloved. I call, I cling, I want — and there is no One to answer — no One on Whom I can cling — no, No One. — Alone ... Where is my Faith — even deep down right in there is nothing, but emptiness & darkness — My God — how painful is this unknown pain — I have no Faith — I dare not utter the words & thoughts that crowd in my heart — & make me suffer untold agony.
  So many unanswered questions live within me afraid to uncover them — because of the blasphemy — If there be God — please forgive me — When I try to raise my thoughts to Heaven — there is such convicting emptiness that those very thoughts return like sharp knives & hurt my very soul. — I am told God loves me — and yet the reality of darkness & coldness & emptiness is so great that nothing touches my soul. Did I make a mistake in surrendering blindly to the Call of the Sacred Heart?
 — addressed to Jesus, at the suggestion of a confessor, undated
    In the first half of 1948, Teresa took a basic medical course before launching herself alone onto the streets of Calcutta. She wrote, "My soul at present is in perfect peace and joy." Kolodiejchuk includes her moving description of her first day on the job: "The old man lying on the street — not wanted — all alone just sick and dying — I gave him carborsone and water to drink and the old Man — was so strangely grateful ... Then we went to Taltala Bazaar, and there was a very poor woman dying I think of starvation more than TB ... I gave her something which will help her to sleep. — I wonder how long she will last." But two months later, shortly after her major triumph of locating a space for her headquarters, Kolodiejchuk's files find her troubled. "What tortures of loneliness," she wrote. "I wonder how long will my heart suffer this?" This complaint could be understood as an initial response to solitude and hardship were it not for subsequent letters. The more success
 Teresa had — and half a year later so many young women had joined her society that she needed to move again — the worse she felt. In March 1953, she wrote Périer, "Please pray specially for me that I may not spoil His work and that Our Lord may show Himself — for there is such terrible darkness within me, as if everything was dead. It has been like this more or less from the time I started 'the work.'"
 Périer may have missed the note of desperation. "God guides you, dear Mother," he answered avuncularly. "You are not so much in the dark as you think ... You have exterior facts enough to see that God blesses your work ... Feelings are not required and often may be misleading." And yet feelings — or rather, their lack — became her life's secret torment. How can you assume the lover's ardor when he no longer grants you his voice, his touch, his very presence? The problem was exacerbated by an inhibition to even describe it. Teresa reported on several occasions inviting a confessor to visit and then being unable to speak. Eventually, one thought to ask her to write the problem down, and she complied. "The more I want him — the less I am wanted," she wrote Périer in 1955. A year later she sounded desolate: "Such deep longing for God — and ... repulsed — empty — no faith — no love — no zeal. — [The saving of] Souls holds no attraction — Heaven means nothing — pray for me
 please that I keep smiling at Him in spite of everything."
 At the suggestion of a confessor, she wrote the agonized plea that begins this section, in which she explored the theological worst-possible-case implications of her dilemma. That letter and another one from 1959 ("What do I labour for? If there be no God — there can be no soul — if there is no Soul then Jesus — You also are not true") are the only two that sound any note of doubt of God's existence. But she frequently bemoaned an inability to pray: "I utter words of Community prayers — and try my utmost to get out of every word the sweetness it has to give — But my prayer of union is not there any longer — I no longer pray."
 As the Missionaries of Charity flourished and gradually gained the attention of her church and the world at large, Teresa progressed from confessor to confessor the way some patients move through their psychoanalysts. Van Exem gave way to Périer, who gave way in 1959 to the Rev. (later Cardinal) Lawrence Picachy, who was succeeded by the Rev. Joseph Neuner in 1961. By the 1980s the chain included figures such as Bishop William Curlin of Charlotte, N.C. For these confessors, she developed a kind of shorthand of pain, referring almost casually to "my darkness" and to Jesus as "the Absent One." There was one respite. In October 1958, Pope Pius XII died, and requiem Masses were celebrated around the Catholic world. Teresa prayed to the deceased Pope for a "proof that God is pleased with the Society." And "then and there," she rejoiced, "disappeared the long darkness ... that strange suffering of 10 years." Unfortunately, five weeks later she reported being "in the tunnel" once
 more. And although, as we shall see, she found a way to accept the absence, it never lifted again. Five years after her Nobel, a Jesuit priest in the Calcutta province noted that "Mother came ... to speak about the excruciating night in her soul. It was not a passing phase but had gone on for years." A 1995 letter discussed her "spiritual dryness." She died in 1997.
    Explanations
   Tell me, Father, why is there so much pain and darkness in my soul?
 — to the Rev. Lawrence Picachy, August 1959    Why did Teresa's communication with Jesus, so vivid and nourishing in the months before the founding of the Missionaries, evaporate so suddenly? Interestingly, secular and religious explanations travel for a while on parallel tracks. Both understand (although only one celebrates) that identification with Christ's extended suffering on the Cross, undertaken to redeem humanity, is a key aspect of Catholic spirituality. Teresa told her nuns that physical poverty ensured empathy in "giving themselves" to the suffering poor and established a stronger bond with Christ's redemptive agony. She wrote in 1951 that the Passion was the only aspect of Jesus' life that she was interested in sharing: "I want to ... drink ONLY [her emphasis] from His chalice of pain." And so she did, although by all indications not in a way she had expected.
 Kolodiejchuk finds divine purpose in the fact that Teresa's spiritual spigot went dry just as she prevailed over her church's perceived hesitations and saw a successful way to realize Jesus' call for her. "She was a very strong personality," he suggests. "And a strong personality needs stronger purification" as an antidote to pride. As proof that it worked, he cites her written comment after receiving an important prize in the Philippines in the 1960s: "This means nothing to me, because I don't have Him."
 And yet "the question is, Who determined the abandonment she experienced?" says Dr. Richard Gottlieb, a teacher at the New York Psychoanalytic Society & Institute who has written about the church and who was provided a copy of the book by TIME. "Could she have imposed it on herself?" Psychologists have long recognized that people of a certain personality type are conflicted about their high achievement and find ways to punish themselves. Gottlieb notes that Teresa's ambitions for her ministry were tremendous. Both he and Kolodiejchuk are fascinated by her statement, "I want to love Jesus as he has never been loved before." Remarks the priest: "That's a kind of daring thing to say." Yet her letters are full of inner conflict about her accomplishments. Rather than simply giving all credit to God, Gottlieb observes, she agonizes incessantly that "any taking credit for her accomplishments — if only internally — is sinful" and hence, perhaps, requires a price to be paid. A mild
 secular analog, he says, might be an executive who commits a horrific social gaffe at the instant of a crucial promotion. For Teresa, "an occasion for a modicum of joy initiated a significant quantity of misery," and her subsequent successes led her to perpetuate it.
 Gottlieb also suggests that starting her ministry "may have marked a turning point in her relationship with Jesus," whose urgent claims she was finally in a position to fulfill. Being the active party, he speculates, might have scared her, and in the end, the only way to accomplish great things might have been in the permanent and less risky role of the spurned yet faithful lover.
 The atheist position is simpler. In 1948, Hitchens ventures, Teresa finally woke up, although she could not admit it. He likens her to die-hard Western communists late in the cold war: "There was a huge amount of cognitive dissonance," he says. "They thought, 'Jesus, the Soviet Union is a failure, [but] I'm not supposed to think that. It means my life is meaningless.' They carried on somehow, but the mainspring was gone. And I think once the mainspring is gone, it cannot be repaired." That, he says, was Teresa.
 Most religious readers will reject that explanation, along with any that makes her the author of her own misery — or even defines it as true misery. Martin, responding to the torch-song image of Teresa, counterproposes her as the heroically constant spouse. "Let's say you're married and you fall in love and you believe with all your heart that marriage is a sacrament. And your wife, God forbid, gets a stroke and she's comatose. And you will never experience her love again. It's like loving and caring for a person for 50 years and once in a while you complain to your spiritual director, but you know on the deepest level that she loves you even though she's silent and that what you're doing makes sense. Mother Teresa knew that what she was doing made sense."
    Integration
   I can't express in words — the gratitude I owe you for your kindness to me — for the first time in ... years — I have come to love the darkness — for I believe now that it is part of a very, very small part of Jesus' darkness & pain on earth. You have taught me to accept it [as] a 'spiritual side of your work' as you wrote — Today really I felt a deep joy — that Jesus can't go anymore through the agony — but that He wants to go through it in me.
 — to Neuner, Circa 1961     There are two responses to trauma: to hold onto it in all its vividness and remain its captive, or without necessarily "conquering" it, to gradually integrate it into the day-by-day. After more than a decade of open-wound agony, Teresa seems to have begun regaining her spiritual equilibrium with the help of a particularly perceptive adviser. The Rev. Joseph Neuner, whom she met in the late 1950s and confided in somewhat later, was already a well-known theologian, and when she turned to him with her "darkness," he seems to have told her the three things she needed to hear: that there was no human remedy for it (that is, she should not feel responsible for affecting it); that feeling Jesus is not the only proof of his being there, and her very craving for God was a "sure sign" of his "hidden presence" in her life; and that the absence was in fact part of the "spiritual side" of her work for Jesus.
 This counsel clearly granted Teresa a tremendous sense of release. For all that she had expected and even craved to share in Christ's Passion, she had not anticipated that she might recapitulate the particular moment on the Cross when he asks, "My God, My God, why have you forsaken me?" The idea that rather than a nihilistic vacuum, his felt absence might be the ordeal she had prayed for, that her perseverance in its face might echo his faith unto death on the Cross, that it might indeed be a grace, enhancing the efficacy of her calling, made sense of her pain. Neuner would later write, "It was the redeeming experience of her life when she realized that the night of her heart was the special share she had in Jesus' passion." And she thanked Neuner profusely: "I can't express in words — the gratitude I owe you for your kindness to me — for the first time in ... years — I have come to love the darkness. "
 Not that it didn't continue to torment her. Years later, describing the joy in Jesus experienced by some of her nuns, she observed dryly to Neuner, "I just have the joy of having nothing — not even the reality of the Presence of God [in the Eucharist]." She described her soul as like an "ice block." Yet she recognized Neuner's key distinction, writing, "I accept not in my feelings — but with my will, the Will of God — I accept His will." Although she still occasionally worried that she might "turn a Judas to Jesus in this painful darkness," with the passage of years the absence morphed from a potential wrecking ball into a kind of ragged cornerstone. Says Gottlieb, the psychoanalyst: "What is remarkable is that she integrated it in a way that enabled her to make it the organizing center of her personality, the beacon for her ongoing spiritual life." Certainly, she understood it as essential enough to project it into her afterlife. "If I ever become a Saint — I will surely
 be one of 'darkness.' I will continually be absent from Heaven — to [light] the light of those in darkness on earth," she wrote in 1962. Theologically, this is a bit odd since most orthodox Christianity defines heaven as God's eternal presence and doesn't really provide for regular no-shows at the heavenly feast. But it is, Kolodiejchuk suggests, her most moving statement, since the sacrifice involved is infinite. "When she wrote, 'I am willing to suffer ... for all eternity, if this [is] possible,'" he says, "I said, Wow."
 He contends that the letters reveal her as holier than anyone knew. However formidable her efforts on Christ's behalf, it is even more astounding to realize that she achieved them when he was not available to her — a bit like a person who believes she can't walk winning the Olympic 100 meters. Kolodiejchuk goes even further. Catholic theologians recognize two types of "dark night": the first is purgative, cleansing the contemplative for a "final union" with Christ; the second is "reparative," and continues after such a union, so that he or she may participate in a state of purity even closer to that of Jesus and Mary, who suffered for human salvation despite being without sin. By the end, writes Kolodiejchuk, "by all indications this was the case with Mother Teresa." That puts her in rarefied company.
    A New Ministry
   If this brings You glory — if souls are brought to you — with joy I accept all to the end of my life.
 — to Jesus, undated     But for most people, Teresa's ranking among Catholic saints may be less important than a more general implication of Come Be My Light: that if she could carry on for a half-century without God in her head or heart, then perhaps people not quite as saintly can cope with less extreme versions of the same problem. One powerful instance of this may have occurred very early on. In 1968, British writer-turned-filmmaker Malcolm Muggeridge visited Teresa. Muggeridge had been an outspoken agnostic, but by the time he arrived with a film crew in Calcutta he was in full spiritual-search mode. Beyond impressing him with her work and her holiness, she wrote a letter to him in 1970 that addressed his doubts full-bore. "Your longing for God is so deep and yet He keeps Himself away from you," she wrote. "He must be forcing Himself to do so — because he loves you so much — the personal love Christ has for you is infinite — The Small difficulty you have re His Church
 is finite — Overcome the finite with the infinite." Muggeridge apparently did. He became an outspoken Christian apologist and converted to Catholicism in 1982. His 1969 film, Something Beautiful for God, supported by a 1971 book of the same title, made Teresa an international sensation.
  At the time, Muggeridge was something of a unique case. A child of privilege who became a minor celebrity, he was hardly Teresa's target audience. Now, with the publication of Come Be My Light, we can all play Muggeridge. Kolodiejchuk thinks the book may act as an antidote to a cultural problem. "The tendency in our spiritual life but also in our more general attitude toward love is that our feelings are all that is going on," he says. "And so to us the totality of love is what we feel. But to really love someone requires commitment, fidelity and vulnerability. Mother Teresa wasn't 'feeling' Christ's love, and she could have shut down. But she was up at 4:30 every morning for Jesus, and still writing to him, 'Your happiness is all I want.' That's a powerful example even if you are not talking in exclusively religious terms."
  America's Martin wants to talk precisely in religious terms. "Everything she's experiencing," he says, "is what average believers experience in their spiritual lives writ large. I have known scores of people who have felt abandoned by God and had doubts about God's existence. And this book expresses that in such a stunning way but shows her full of complete trust at the same time." He takes a breath. "Who would have thought that the person who was considered the most faithful woman in the world struggled like that with her faith?" he asks. "And who would have thought that the one thought to be the most ardent of believers could be a saint to the skeptics?" Martin has long used Teresa as an example to parishioners of self-emptying love. Now, he says, he will use her extraordinary faith in the face of overwhelming silence to illustrate how doubt is a natural part of everyone's life, be it an average believer's or a world-famous saint's.
   Into the Light of Day
   Please destroy any letters or anything I have written.
 — to Picachy, April 1959     Consistent with her ongoing fight against pride, Teresa's rationale for suppressing her personal correspondence was "I want the work to remain only His." If the letters became public, she explained to Picachy, "people will think more of me — less of Jesus."
 The particularly holy are no less prone than the rest of us to misjudge the workings of history — or, if you will, of God's providence. Teresa considered the perceived absence of God in her life as her most shameful secret but eventually learned that it could be seen as a gift abetting her calling. If her worries about publicizing it also turn out to be misplaced — if a book of hasty, troubled notes turns out to ease the spiritual road of thousands of fellow believers, there would be no shame in having been wrong — but happily, even wonderfully wrong — twice.

Steve,

My books and poetry broadsides were confiscated at the Canadian border in
1969 when I was going to do a reading at Simon Fraser University. True, the
broadside had a photograph of Amiri Baraka and all caps "Poetry is
Revolution" headline style. But still.

My friend Irma Paule in NYC in 1966 had her tiny macrobiotic store and
restaurant invaded, all the sacks of grain etc. cut open and poured on the
floor and insecticide sprayed on them. Then she was arrested because selling
books about using food as medicine in the same locale where you sold the
same or similar foods constituted prescribing without an MD license.

I worked at the Phoenix bookstore in NYC in the late 1950s and could have
been arrested everytime I took a book by Henry Miller or Jean Genet or Alex
Trocchi out of the back room for a customer (needless to say, the customer
had to be someone we knew very well).

My point, I guess, is that it's all been going on for a long time. This
administration is particularly invidious, but aside from openly condoning
torture and turning the entire globe into an American prison complex--none
of the stuff is new. Yet. Not the stuff at the airports, anyway.

It's good to fight it, but perhaps both surprise and indignation are
luxuries we can no longer afford.

Nye's piece is important because we need to hear everything we can that will
give us heart. No way we'll be distracted by such stories--but one can only
go so far on anger, however righteous, before hitting a wall.

With love & solidarity

skipping and ghost-traps


skipping as the third walk/run/skip gait -
where is OUR ethnography of skipping

BUT

radio waves - shortwaves, spherics, whistlers:
ionosopheric skipping

in the samples here, the GROUND of the crystal radio is
connected to the ANTENNA of a second crystal radio

the OUTPUT of the first (large loose coupler) c.r. connects
to the INPUT of a VLF (very low frequency) radio

the OUTPUT of the VLF radio connects to the INPUT of a
minidisk recorder

the two crystal radios operate with DIODES and COILS:
INDUCTORs

the COILS are ghost-traps absorbing everything within
their spectral range

nothing but wound wire self-inducting, mutually inducting,
everything around

they capture invisible spirits how close to the speed of
light

_mdos_ or 'thread-cross'

'In other cases the _mdos_ fulfills the same purpose as a
_gtor ma_; it provides a temporary abode for a deity.'

'The patches of wood which are often attached to the sticks
forming the _mdos_ are in this case supposed to represent the
clouds floating around the heavenly abode.'

(Oracles and Demons of Tibet, The Cult and Iconography of the
Tibetan Protective Deities, Rene deNebesky-Wojkowitz, Paljor,
1998)

the RANGE appears to cover the medium-wave (AM)
band as well as somewhat above and below it.

On the contrary, I think discussions around a poem can be extremely importa=
nt.
On the one hand, they can elevate a work to the Canon--and on the
other to the scrap heaps of history--
or simply to nowhere--

The fragments-- and even a poem--by Sappho, found inside the wrappings
of tenth rate mummies thrown on to the smoldering dusty heaps of
ancient waste dumps, scuttling about for centuries in the raggedy
winds of battering and forgetful histories--

The Israelis withholding the entrance into Gaza of this year's school
supplies--no paper, no pens, erasers, inks, textbooks, notebooks--for
any young Palestinian to write a poem!--Let alone read one, study
about them--except to resort to scratching them in the dirt,
learningthem by memory--shipping the young poets off to some other
period of the creation of poetry--outside the "civilized" present--

One book of Guantanamo Poetry is enough, don't you think?--Can't allow
too much sympathy in the outside world for the hordes of confined and
tortured "suspects" can we now?


Something i  think about often is there may have been throughout
history and are still--many truly great, gifted, visionary poets,
artists, of all kinds--who were and are  not allowed to learn to read
or write, use paints, clay, express themselves in song, dance or oral
poetry--

Given that women have been so long excluded from learning writing,
painting, sculpture, music, any of the arts--or, even when allowed,
confined to the realm of the domestic expression of these through
"accomplishments" such as playing the piano nicely, or as
"handi-work,"handicrafts" "pastimes"--or confined to "lower forms" of
the various arts--"excellent cooks" but not "chefs", "seamstresses"
but not Tailors for the VIP--"good at decorating the home" but never
Interior Designer to the So and Sos--great stenographers but never
Lawyer, Poet, Entrepreneur-- how many poets and artists were never
even given the means of expression let alone allowed to take their
"minor" contributions outside of the house or family circle?

How many geniuses toiled as slaves through history--prohibited from
any learning--how many whose ethnic or religious or economic group not
allowed to participate in any way in any form of the cultural?
Or--creating works, not having the works recognized--not just the
great poets and artists unrecognized in their own time, but the
progenitors of Art Brut--their work consigned to the looney bin, the
prison, or simply as being the eccentricities of "common folk."

For there to be the poem to consider in the first place, there has to
have been a route by which it is allowed to arrive at this state.
"Allowed" because as one knows, many works were never allowed to
arrive anywhere until much later or far from their sites of origin.

And many are never allowed to arrive anywhere at all. Not even on a
piece of paper or papyrus or clay tablet.

There also along the way has to be for many works the recognition
brought to bear by another poet, artist, who can see and hear and
think through the layerings of obscurities covering up the work deep
inside, almost lost in space and time--a Breton discovering
Lautreamont in the Paris Library, a Jean Dubuffet with the vision of
Art Brut--and before him, Prinzhorn and his Artistry of the Mentally
Ill, a Picasso bring African art into the conscioussness of modern
Western Art--the examples of such findings are a very great many.

An immense matrix may be involved with the poem--its being made in the
first place, then read--by a reader who recognizes it as a poem. The
routes and methods, quantities, qualities of the modes of publishing,
distributing, promoting or not--the poem. Which person first brings it
to the attention of others--"now HERE is a POEM!!"--well if
critic/blogger BIG says this--suddenly many somnolent heads look up
and eager arms reach out to get hold of a copy of that POEM!  If
critic/blogger small says 'now here is a poem" (smaller case in
keeping with the much smaller voice-range of the voice)--then who the
heck really cares?

Say the poem does make its way out into the world and have something
of it enough to garner a bit of attention--well--then where does one
put this poem, this poet--within the types of poetry being made, the
heirarchies within those types--and within those ever smaller
circles--once properly placed--how does this immediately alter the
poem--in terms of how many read it once classified--and how it is read
by this group of people--coming to it with a pre-conception of the
poem's type--what to expect, to demand, to subject it to--by what
selective criteria to"weigh it"--determine it's "value"--

You see, this is all a very serious "business"!  The incomes of many
Deciders, teachers, publishers, printers, web masters, bookstore
owners, libraries, depend on it!! And poets, too!

Because this whole industry--this serious business-- of Decidings--in
itself creates an audience--some classifications being "better" than
others to be sure--depending on the ideologies of writing and reading
of the times.

George Bush often calls himself "the Decider" ("That's my job. To
Decide. To be the Decider.")  This is also the role often assigned to
the  Authorities, the Deciders,  whom one places varying degrees of
trust in in re poetry, the poem.  The BIG critic/blogger. Silliman
gives it two thumbs up!!!  Bernstein says wow!  Perloff places it in
the context of Radical Displacements within the Dewey decimal System
and so forth.  Harold Bloom says a jeremiad.  So and so is tickled
pink.  And some else is calling out for takeout, a real down home
celebration of the true thing come home at last. Or one turns to yet
other BIGs--the ones one prefers. AHHH! The BIG one says this book is
the shit!  You bet I'm gonna buy it!  I just know it will be great!
And yes, it won't be too long and there will be an other and yet
another one one just has to have!  That "poetry fix"!--

You see--it is indeed serious business-which poems one buys to
consume--to own--to get a fix--or build a library--of the right
poems!!--the good ones, the ones worth, yes, worth reading!!!  one
must after all expect some sort of return on one's
investment----whether a quick fix--or a nice long shelf of the poems
that "really matter to me"--and do so indeed, right there, in all
their materiality as chunks of matter--"you can always use it for a
door stopper"---"or throw it at the mice"--

All this while the poem is picking up steam, or losing gas--or "really
taking off, mark it with a bullet". Or else on the one way lonely walk
back to Palookaville.

Even in regards to the poet who wrote it--what is the life of the
poem?  Does it end up in the waste basket, used for wrapping up a fig
for later, shoved into the parrakeet's cage in place of another old
poem, now covered with excrements? Does it sit forever in the hard
drive, or on the can--or actually get shipped off someplace?

And does a poem even live the life the poet would want it to?  Might
not a poem indeed have lives and skies of its own as Petra Backonja
writes in an essay, "The Lives they Wish"?

The poem may have for itself quite another life in mind than that
rather humdrum classifiable one planned by the poet!

And not care a rap about the BIGS and smalls --or the poet----at all
and take off for quite some other destination entirely--finding its
own company--

Running into a Dubbuffet of its own choosing perhaps someday--and
teaching him a thing or two--or--going underground--or--simply
"blending in" among people at a bus stop on a rainy day--

On the one hand the discussion around a poem can very greatly
determine the actual existence of the poem--and by extension, that of
the poet, where and when and how they will be placed, seated at the
banquet, or at the picnic table, or outside the fence, looking in at
the gay revelers--

Will the poem "arrive" in a place where it wil be read?--and read by
whom? and with what methods of reading? in what  spaces of reading
find itself being handled ?--what responses receiving?--in what
media?--and for how long?--

Or will it--not arrive anywhere--
and the poet maybe not even arriving at the writing of a poem, though
filled with poems--

and on the other hand--the poem may not at all have this life as "the
poem" that the poet might want it to have--or the BIGS and smalls--
and go off to find its own places visible or invisible in the world--

leaving the poet to hang on to her or his seat in the tenuous waiting rooms=
--
among the others awaiting their turn in court--
the tennis court, the kangaroo court, night court, criminal court,
court of public opinion, Royal Court, divorce court, Military
Tribunal, the Court of Last Resort---the courting of Dame Fortune and
Fame---
clutching a document where a poem used to be--
claiming to be a poet--
"When traveling to a town new to you--take a good look at the faces of
the people on their way back from it"
--French Proverb
(If there are any people coming back from it--)
Is that really a place anyone might want to go--any poem-any poet?--
Is it for one to decide--or for others--???
Or various compromises, negotiations, diplomacies, tributes paid,
bribes proffered, to work out some "some form of agreement"---
Necessity is the motherfucker of invention---and--whose
necessities--may invent further circumstances--

Today I received my bill from AT&T with this interesting Brand or Tagline on
the envelope:

"AT&T - the most complete provider for the way you live."

Interesting, and more than a bit spooky, in light of the current court cases
against AT&T and the Government on account of the company's cooperation with
the Department of Homeland Security  in the warrant less surveillance of
phone calls and emails. (If not, the info is easily Googled.)

That word "provider" - in the sense of provision - in terms of surveillance
(i.e., total invasion of privacy without permission) is curious. Time - as
these suits suggest -to put Providence (Cheney, Bush, et al) on something
more than probation, certainly under public and judicial surveillance.

Or consider "surveillance" as one of the objects of poet and poem. To
witness, etc.

Hi,

Can any of you recommend some good books & other sources about fonts,
typewriters, page design, & printing?

I just bought Darren Wershler-Henry's "The Iron Whim: A Fragmented History
of Typewriting," just started it. Here's the NPR interview with DWH:
http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=12900006.

Jaroslav Andel's "Avant-Garde Page Design 1900-1950" is an amazing book, and
so is Steven Clay & Rodney Phillips' "A Secret Location on the Lower East
Side."

Then there's "Helvetica," the movie: http://www.helveticafilm.com/.

Thanks,

Dan

Hello everyone...I'm resending this CFP for Critiphoria, which is a little =
more fleshed-out after further discussion today.Best, Tim*  *  *  *

CRITIPHORIA
A Journal of Poetry and Criticism

Edited by Stephen Paul Miller, Tim Peterson, and Cecilia Wu



Contributing Editors: Denise Duhamel, Peter Frank, Karen Alkaly-Gut, Bob Ho=
lman, Maria Damon, Carolee Schneemann, David Shapiro.

Critiphoria is a journal
partially funded by St. Johns University which seeks submissions of
"poetry-criticism" in
all its forms for a first issue to be published in late 2007. This new
journal will energize poetry and criticism through one another,
exploring their intersection in the possibility of a "third genre" that
grows out of such precedents as Charles Bernstein's "Artifice of
Absorption," Stephen Paul Miller's poem reviews and essay/lectures, Lyn
Hejinian's poetic nonfiction, David Antin's talk poems, and
a variety of dialogic critical-poetic objects (we enthusiastically
anticipate new models). We will publish essays
in poetic form, essays using poetic methodology, poems with critical
content, "poetry-criticism," essays concerning
poetry-criticism, statements about poetic production. We also invite
items of a more general nature pertinent to these topics, including
essays, poems, visual art, vispo, audio, and e-poetry.


Submissions may include a statement concerning the
submission and how it concerns dynamic interaction between poetry and
criticism.

Critiphoria will appear at http://www.critiphoria.org, and a print edition =
will also be published. Subscriptions are $20/two issues. Email submissions=
 or other correspondence to the
editors: Stephen Paul Miller, Tim Peterson, and Cecilia Wu at critiphoria@g=
mail.com.

I can insert 100 left-margin xhtml line breaks in 10 seconds, no
right-clicking or searchnreplaces or macrofunctions involved.
(So the page source looks competent to other web designers, who count
for one third of non-peak direct traffic.)

Yes, that is one cool thing you know about me.
And it follows, I must tell you two cool things about other people.

Someone says she's an "amateur photographer."  She is capable of
borrowing your soul on that day.
Someone says he's an "intermediate" chess player.  He is capable of
mopping the floor with you.

Also, when I require a "stronger objection" to my edition of your works,
And then you do, then why don't you have an MFA?

Diane,

Your email brings back the '60s in a real way--of course it was mixed--and
as I remember you are talking in a film about the Beats about how the
repercussions were different (harder) for women then--another reality. Thank
you for the complexity.

Even if you're not a type geek the Helvetica film will seduce you--great
soundtrack to boot. There's a short bibliography on the DIY page at the
Cuneiform Press site that I think people with a literary (rather than
strictly graphic arts) background might enjoy. Charles Bernstein's Textual
Conditions syllabus is a great 'survey' as well.

At what point does "making visible" cross over into "rendering invisible"--fron "rendition flights" to secret torture chambers to the mass erasure of former legal boundaries by "redrawing the lines" with Walls, bulldozers, tanks, drones, surveillance "eyes in the skies" of ever greater power and definition?

Walls become a site behind which the work vanishes, is locked away, hidden from "the eyes of the world"--while an other "projection" is played on the surfaces of the "society of the spectacle", one of "safety" for the "pursuit of happiness" of gated communities and countries, corporations.

>
> Gaza in the hands of Hamas, with masked militants sitting in the president's chair; the West Bank on the edge; Israeli army camps hastily assembled in the Golan Heights; a spy satellite over Iran and Syria; war with Hezbollah a hair trigger away; a scandal-plagued political class facing a total loss of public faith.
>
> At a glance, things aren't going well for Israel. But here's a puzzle: Why, in the midst of such chaos and carnage, is the Israeli economy booming like it's 1999, with a roaring stock market and growth rates nearing China's?
>
> Thomas Friedman recently offered his theory in the New York Times. Israel "nurtures and rewards individual imagination," and so its people are constantly spawning ingenious high-tech start-ups--no matter what messes their politicians are making. After perusing class projects by students in engineering and computer science at Ben Gurion University, Friedman made one of his famous fake-sense pronouncements: Israel "had discovered oil." This oil, apparently, is located in the minds of Israel's "young innovators and venture capitalists," who are too busy making megadeals with Google to be held back by politics.
>
> Here's another theory: Israel's economy isn't booming despite the political chaos that devours the headlines but because of it. This phase of development dates back to the mid-'90s, when Israel was in the vanguard of the information revolution--the most tech-dependent economy in the world. After the dot-com bubble burst in 2000, Israel's economy was devastated, facing its worst year since 1953. Then came 9/11, and suddenly new profit vistas opened up for any company that claimed it could spot terrorists in crowds, seal borders from attack and extract confessions from closed-mouthed prisoners.
>
> Within three years, large parts of Israel's tech economy had been radically repurposed. Put in Friedmanesque terms: Israel went from inventing the networking tools of the "flat world" to selling fences to an apartheid planet. Many of the country's most successful entrepreneurs are using Israel's status as a fortressed state, surrounded by furious enemies, as a kind of twenty-four-hour-a-day showroom--a living example of how to enjoy relative safety amid constant war. And the reason Israel is now enjoying supergrowth is that those companies are busily exporting that model to the world.
>
> Discussions of Israel's military trade usually focus on the flow of weapons into the country--US-made Caterpillar bulldozers used to destroy homes in the West Bank and British companies supplying parts for F-16s. Overlooked is Israel's huge and expanding export business. Israel now sends $1.2 billion in "defense" products to the United States--up dramatically from $270 million in 1999. In 2006 Israel exported $3.4 billion in defense products--well over a billion more than it received in US military aid. That makes Israel the fourth-largest arms dealer in the world, overtaking Britain.
>
> Much of this growth has been in the so-called "homeland security" sector. Before 9/11 homeland security barely existed as an industry. By the end of this year, Israeli exports in the sector will reach $1.2 billion--an increase of 20 percent. The key products and services are high-tech fences, unmanned drones, biometric IDs, video and audio surveillance gear, air passenger profiling and prisoner interrogation systems--precisely the tools and technologies Israel has used to lock in the occupied territories.
>
> And that is why the chaos in Gaza and the rest of the region doesn't threaten the bottom line in Tel Aviv, and may actually boost it. Israel has learned to turn endless war into a brand asset, pitching its uprooting, occupation and containment of the Palestinian people as a half-century head start in the "global war on terror."
>
> It's no coincidence that the class projects at Ben Gurion that so impressed Friedman have names like "Innovative Covariance Matrix for Point Target Detection in Hyperspectral Images" and "Algorithms for Obstacle Detection and Avoidance." Thirty homeland security companies were launched in Israel in the past six months alone, thanks in large part to lavish government subsidies that have transformed the Israeli army and the country's universities into incubators for security and weapons start-ups (something to keep in mind in the debates about the academic boycott).
>
> Next week, the most established of these companies will travel to Europe for the Paris Air Show, the arms industry's equivalent of Fashion Week. One of the Israeli companies exhibiting is Suspect Detection Systems (SDS), which will be showcasing its Cogito1002, a white, sci-fi-looking security kiosk that asks air travelers to answer a series of computer-generated questions, tailored to their country of origin, while they hold their hand on a "biofeedback" sensor. The device reads the body's reactions to the questions, and certain responses flag the passenger as "suspect."
>
> Like hundreds of other Israeli security start-ups, SDS boasts that it was founded by veterans of Israel's secret police and that its products were road-tested on Palestinians. Not only has the company tried out the biofeedback terminals at a West Bank checkpoint; it claims the "concept is supported and enhanced by knowledge acquired and assimilated from the analysis of thousands of case studies related to suicide bombers in Israel."
>
> Another star of the Paris Air Show will be Israeli defense giant Elbit, which plans to showcase its Hermes 450 and 900 unmanned air vehicles. As recently as May, according to press reports, Israel used the drones on bombing missions in Gaza. Once tested in the territories, they are exported abroad: The Hermes has already been used at the Arizona-Mexico border; Cogito1002 terminals are being auditioned at an unnamed US airport; and Elbit, one of the companies behind Israel's "security barrier," has partnered with Boeing to construct the Department of Homeland Security's $2.5 billion "virtual" border fence around the United States.
>
> Since Israel began its policy of sealing off the occupied territories with checkpoints and walls, human rights activists have often compared Gaza and the West Bank to open-air prisons. But in researching the explosion of Israel's homeland security sector, a topic I explore in greater detail in a forthcoming book (The Shock Doctrine: The Rise of Disaster Capitalism), it strikes me that they are something else too: laboratories where the terrifying tools of our security states are being field-tested. Palestinians--whether living in the West Bank or what the Israeli politicians are already calling "Hamasistan"--are no longer just targets. They are guinea pigs.
>
> So in a way Friedman is right: Israel has struck oil. But the oil isn't the imagination of its techie entrepreneurs. The oil is the war on terror, the state of constant fear that creates a bottomless global demand for devices that watch, listen, contain and target "suspects." And fear, it turns out, is the ultimate renewable resource.

Bringhurst may be OK, but  he's quite conservative as a typographic
theorist, and that should be kept in mind. Make sure you counter him
with various sources of futurist typography, etc. Johanna Drucker has
one or two books on those subjects, as well as her massive The
Century of Artist's Books. I haven't found any book specifically on
typography that has influenced me as much in type work (typesetting,
page design, etc.) as many books of poetry, such as Olson's Maximus
(the original volumes, not so much the California Press edition), the
Awede Press Susan Howe book The Articulation of Sound Forms in Time,
Mallarme's Un Coup de Des . . ., the works of Walter Hamady's
Perishable Press (particularly early books of that press, previous to
about 1978 or so), and far too many other books to mention, and not
only "fine press" books. Karl Young's books from Membrane Press are a
marvel of possibilities, and various bpNichol publications are
informative. Something Else Press books are a treasure trove of
possibilities. And there are so many more.

This is my part of a talk (Sandy Baldwin is also speaking) for the DRESS-
CODEAVATAR show/performance tomorrow at 2 p.m. NYC time - please attend
if you're interested. You can find info online; it's in Second Life and
real life for that matter. Thanks, Alan

I think if you go to
http://xxxtenxion.blogspot.com/2007/08/lets-do-it-tun-wirs.html
and click on
3 weeks of fine art.xxXtenxion
- a bit confusing but there -


Avatar Dress Codes (talk for DRESSCODEAVATAR.)


Of course the dress-code is code and what protocol structures;
I have no idea what Linden knows;
If it's anything like MOO-Wizardry, Linden knows or has the potential
for knowing - everything.
So there's that limit.

I think of build as masquerade, participating in dubious economy.
Dubious, because I can't afford it! And would want, as with any land-grab,
some sort of assurance of ownership beyond the corporation.

I've spent something like $2.40 on Second Life.

To the more serious issue - I identify with Gaz' work because of the dis/
comfort it causes; it's this dis/comfort and the attendant psychoanalytics
that fascinates me, that I think is important in virtual space.

Because virtual space is cleansed, purified, and one can always sign out
when things get too hot. But investigating, producing, corrupting,
exalting, the abject body, that's something else, this body which is both
prim and flesh, which doesn't quite let go when you hit delete or quit.

It's this body that reminds you of flesh in the midst of non-flesh, that
speaks for that _matter_ of the number tattooed on a survivor's arm - and
the relation of that number to the system of integers.

Every arm, leg, big rez, hot car, agro, hack, swollen outfitting, is sex,
most often phallus, writ large. Every phallus is a masquerade, null point,
whose transcendent meaning disappears in the vagaries of real and quite
weak flesh.

Avalanches kill people, they're just snow.

I'm quite possibly in the wrong place, but I miss issues of governance in
Second Life, issues implicit in the software, not riding the World Wide
Web. We're allowed to talk endlessly.

Just a word here about MOOs - anyone could and can set one up, look at the
code, thank you Pavil Curtis. Now the SL engine is far more complex; it's
unary, there, as far as I know; we're in an obdurate space in a manner not
unlike the earth itself.

On an email list, someone complained that there's no Guernica in Second
Life. But there is; Gaz dressed/de/codings, my body, these are Guernicas.
But response Guernicas, not masterpieces, which, with all their delicacy,
are left behind.

Back to the dress-code. My avatar appears to bleed. My avatar is a woman,
sourcing speech, behavior, chora, abjection, Timaeus, Kristeva. Her body
distorts, her body always returns from distortions. She came out of my
work with another avatar, Nikuko, who appeared in print and video for a
number of years. Nikuko was a demiurge; this avatar is demiurgency.

It uses the name Alan and writes me within her. The very interactivity,
dialectic, of Second Life, ensures she's only in partial control, just as
one might wander, Situationist-like, through any city.

She's dressed nude or blood-covered or organ-covered; she's tantra-fierce,
I'm her consort, not the other way around. Inhabiting her, I face myself
in an _uncanny manner,_ it's not comfortable; when she leaves the space
through extreme behavior, I can't find her or find myself any more than
you can.

Her motions are behaviors or behavior collisions - combinations of
behaviors that result in contradictions. The behaviors themselves are, for
the most part, constructed from motion capture equipment using life human
performers. But the motion capture sensors are re-arranged to create
virtual bodies in real physical space, and it's these virtual bodies and
their motions that are mapped onto the Second Life avatar.

There's relationship to dance as well. I work with Azure, Foofwa
d'Imobilite, worked with Maud Liardon. A fair amount of this work is nude
- not to create a pure body, but to give the cultured, acculturated, body,
room to breathe. If you've seen our videos, you'll find real-world
imitations of avatar imitations of real-world behaviors; the spaces
shimmer and meld, both in virtual and live performance.

Sexuality is always in the eye of the beholder; it's not in the prims. I
enter the sheaved interior of my avatar; there's no clothing, only triply
articulated space: 1. Articulated by the exigencies of the avatar-
construct itself; 2. Articulated by motion-capture; 3. Articulated by the
Linden contextuality and all that's implied there.

The avatar behaves, one way or another, variously in various spaces. I
want to work at the edge of the game-space, where physics is different,
and where I'm mostly alone (or working with my colleague on-line, Sandy
Baldwin).

...but then I imagine furiously dancing across the landscape, inscape,
outscape, roiling, creating havoc everywhere I go, just churning like a
star half-way burnt to a cinder, burned-out, dead before 1914, 1939,
2002...

thank you

Hi all,

I'm not quite sure what happened but I have actually recommended twice
within the month that two of my non-poet friends read the *Dream Songs*.
They were both looking for good reads, and this was the first thing that
came to mind.

It forced me to pick up my third copy I've owned--this is a book that I give
away on moves and then rebuy shortly after--and song #14 (Life, friends, is
boring...), while making its way into all those anthologies and being a good
stand alone poem and all, does little justice to the overall accruing
strength of the whole.

It may not be at the level of *Leaves of Grass, *the *Cantos, or A*, but I
need to reread the thing and consider why I think this *might* be the case.

Thoughts?

Great piece, Barry--I interviewed Walcott at my university for one of our "lecture" series--the lecture consisying of the interview. Age has slowed down this infamously irascible character but he still had a punch or two left..."The Schooner Flight" is still one of my favorite poems of the 20th century...

The Helvetica film was excellent. Where I saw it there were picketers decrying
the global hegemony of sans-serif fonts - designers with Times Roman shoulders
to chip.

Perhaps, seemingly, the most left-field theorist of typography, was published
under Bringhurst's conservative watch at Hartley and Marks out there in Point
Roberts, BC-WA. Derrek NordZij, a Dutch typographer, encounters letter-form
through a series of strokes in negative space. His sense of the
three-dimensional character of the 'face' is fascinating. There are two
identical versions of the book: 'Letterletter' and 'The Stroke'.

Of course there's the venerable rags 'Type' and 'How'. Expensive eye candy.

David, et. al.,

  Before I go further, I'm a huge fan of DS #22- "a teenage cancer, with a plan"

  Personally, I like it a lot more than Leaves of Grass, although they are pretty similar in a lot of ways.  I find them both self-serving for their particular poets as well as an interesting chronicle to the periods in which they were living (I have a paper on DS about this point, but it's awfully executed).

  JB's such a strange guy with his own mixed up views on himself and everything around him, and that to me ends up being the humor in DS, which to an extent may have been a conscious attempt.

  I have bought several copies, but only one for myself:  I've given two to friends and one to a college literary society I was a member of in my younger and more vulnerable days.

  David:  Go get sucked into JB's world and report back!

  Best,
  Amish

Charles Olson's Letters to Origin (meaning Cid Corman) give a wonderful
sense of 'out loud' thinking about the relationship between the poet, the
editor, the designer and the poem its ideal typographic representation on
the page. Olson's insistence (naturally!) on the chemistry and materiality
(physiology) of this relationship,  I found - when I (as editior and
publisher) was working with both poets and designers - to be vital.

Type - in that projectivist sense - as similar to a musical score for an
accurate reading of the poem.

Bringhurst may be OK, but he's quite conservative as a typographic theorist, and that should be kept in mind. Make sure you counter him with various sources of futurist typography, etc. Johanna Drucker has one or two books on those subjects, as well as her massive The Century of Artist's Books. I haven't found any book specifically on typography that has influenced me as much in type work (typesetting, page design, etc.) as many books of poetry, such as Olson's Maximus (the original volumes, not so much the California Press edition), the Awede Press Susan Howe book The Articulation of Sound Forms in Time, Mallarme's Un Coup de Des . . ., the works of Walter Hamady's Perishable Press (particularly early books of that press, previous to about 1978 or so), and far too many other books to mention, and not only "fine press" books.

There's a tendency to skip the basics. This list would make most
beginners pack up and go home.

But as long as we're at it, look at a lot of old books. Two that come
to mind are the Van krimpen Homer and the Eric Gill Hamlet. Actually,
anything by Gill or Van Krimpen. Not to speak of William Morris. And
all the way back to medieval manuscripts.

And just so that you know there are different schools of letterpress,
check out (in rare book collections) Leonard Baskin's Gehenna Press
and Andrew Hoyem's Arion Press. With Perishable Press, they've
spawned much of the subsequent crop of letterpress designers and
printers, and represent quite different ways of going about it. They
of course share many things, most important a fanatical attention to
detail and quality of impression.

When I was a beginner, that list didn't make me pack up and go home;
it excited me and made me go forward. But you're right, the basics
shouldn't be skipped, but they should be taken as tools, not ends,
unless that does end up being just where one wants to reside.

I absolutely agree with Mark about looking at Eric Gill's and Jan Van
Krimpen's work, also the work & writing of Jan Tschichold, Victor
Hammer, Stanley Morrison, Frederic Goudy. Tschichold, in particular,
in Die neue Typographie, had a great influence on 20th Century
typographic directions, though he would later tend to go away from
his own more avant positions. His Sabon is one of the most graceful
fonts developed in the 20th Century. Hermann Zapf is also someone
whose work bears attention.

When looking at William Morris, don't forget his somewhat lesser
known contemporaries in book making, whose aesthetic ideas were
somewhat different from Morris but whose works are, to me, equally
compelling -- particularly the Ashendene Press of C.H. St. John
Hornby, and the Doves Press of T.J. Cobden-Sanderson and Emery
Walker. In general, both of these presses produced books that were
less showy, but arguably more elegant, than Morris's Kelmscott Press.
I say that, though, with absolute respect and amazement at what
Morris accomplished.

In terms of influences on designers & printers who started in the
late 20th Century, I'd disagree slightly with Mark, or at least would
have to add Harry Duncan (Cummington Press, and subsequently Abbatoir
Editions) to the list of those who spawned people active in printing
& design, and probably even put him at the very top of that list. I'd
also have to add Claire Van Vliet and her Janus Press, although
possibly more of the people she influenced have gone into artists'
bookmaking and handmade paper works than have got involved in
printing literary works.

These are all very fine artists and craftspeople who trained in
calligraphy, design, and traditional bookmaking skills; I think there
are equal influences coming from other directions, such as from the
lettristes (Isidore Issou & others), and from Fluxus & other
avant-garde movements. We may look back on the current period and see
what mIEKAL aND has done with Xexoxial Anarchy and other presses &
magazines he has developed, as more definitive of
literary/typographical conjunctions in our time, than any "fine
press" of the period.

I'd also suggest looking at the books, and the books about books,
produced by Granary Books in the last couple of decades. Individual
beauties, and, collectively, an informative and generous vision about
the state of the book. Possibly begin with The Book of the Book, but
don't stop there.

This is interesting Mark. Any advice on finding out more about letterpress
schools and differences? It seems necessity would curve these differences or is
there more?

Another good read in the basics might include Frederick Goudy's professional
autobiography: "The Alphabet: Fifteen Interpretive Designs."

"I had no feeling for poetry."

Did that come as a surprise to anybody?

I remember the reaction of C.L.R. James, who had been an early champion of
Naipaul, to the publication of AN AREA OF DARKNESS.  "The only area of
darkness," said James, "is in Vidia's mind."

This discussion makes one think of typography and page design in different
ways -- traditional, experimental, abstract, expansive, etc.

Here's an interview with Hannah Higgins wherein she talks about her mother
sawing a book page in half with a blow torch in a performance:
http://www.mouthtomouthmag.com/higgins.html. Fire as typeset...?

Is a graphic score typography for musicians?

Charles Olson's Letters to Origin (meaning Cid Corman) give a wonderful
sense of 'out loud' thinking about the relationship between the poet, the
editor, the designer and the poem its ideal typographic representation on
the page. Olson's insistence (naturally!) on the chemistry and materiality
(physiology) of this relationship,  I found - when I (as editior and
publisher) was working with both poets and designers - to be vital.

Type - in that projectivist sense - as similar to a musical score for an
accurate reading of the poem.

Not at all a surprise...and in the interest of "balanced" reporting, I should note that during the interview I asked Walcott about his assessment of the relationship between Negritiude and the Harlem Renaissance. He claimed--live, on stage, to have never heard of the latter...ASdmittedly, as I noted, he is frail, but still...

I think that mIEKAL is getting back to the first question which was less on=
 how to design (great suggestions, by the way) or how to display=
 information (isn't Tufte great?), and more on whether or not anyone has=
 done much work on the impact of the typewriter and the Courier font on=
 poetry, not just on what it says but on how it looks and the impact of how=
 it looks on what it says. Drucker does address the look of the poem, but=
 does she look at this question exactly?

mIEKAL says that he started with the IBM typewriter, which must have=
 represented the first moment of font style selection (was the default=
 selectric font set Times New Roman?), but many poets on this list had no=
 font choice (i.e., no extra selectric sets). What was the effect on poetry=
 of a shift from the open letter form, now seen as archaic, of Courier, to=
 the much more closed and formal form of Times New Roman? The only=
 expressive tools, too, on typewriters were capitalizations or not and=
 perhaps punctuation as visual mark. Word processor programs of various=
 sorts began to open up the font availability, but I would guess that most=
 poets used the default font style.

I also think that word processors removed features available with=
 typewriters, like removing a sheet of paper and re-entering it with=
 different placement, or positiioning the paper exactly so that a letter or=
 letter group could be placed on the page in a very specific space. With=
 word processing, it became impossible to overlap lines or letters, but=
 also, I suspect that the hyphen practically disappeared. Not everyone used=
 hyphens with typewriters, but just leaving a word unfinished at the end of=
 a line set up a moment of hesitation that automatic word wrap removes.

I suspect, too, that few poets use (or perhaps in early word processing,=
 did use) layout programs, for they were only available on Apple computers=
 and were prohibitively expensive. It is these programs that mIEKAL=
 lists--Quark and InDesign, especially--that permit font style and size=
 choice and letter/word/line placement to an exact degree. To what degree=
 are poets using these tools?

I wonder if early word processing created a dearth or at least a radical=
 change in concret poetry forms.

The bibliography is endless, as Charles' posts demonstrate. But I
don't know of any work on the geneologies and differences. It's

Not only are most of the players still active, but many of them,
across genealogies, are friends, or know each other, and are
influenced by each other's work. Plus, people influenced by Walter
Hamady may also be influenced by Harry Duncan and Claire Van Vliet.
Some people came into Hamady's sphere already with more of a Harry
Duncan kind of sensibility, and vice versa. Even before the computer,
the 1960s through 1980s were a time of lots of communication among
people with different training, and that communication continues.
While there are students of Duncan who want to be as much like Duncan
as possible (in style, aesthetic, etc.), there are probably many more
who took the tools Duncan gave them and went very much their own
direction with it. The same is true with Hamady students, and, I
would guess, with those who began under the influence of Hoyem or
Baskin or Van Vliet. Many of the students of these people also have
worked extensively in various centers for book arts, i.e. Center for
Book Arts in New York, Minnesota Center for Book Arts, programs at
University of the Arts in Philadelphia, Nexus Press (no longer
active) in Atlanta, San Francisco Center for the Book, etc., picking
up other influences and cross-fertilizations of their work. I would
imagine that a work on current schools and differences would be very
challenging to write, though it would be possible to trace out who
studied with who, etc. One of the telling differences for me is among
those people who consider themselves book makers, i.e. responsible
for the whole of the book (not content, necessarily, but materials
choice, structure of the book, typography, binding, etc.), and those
who consider themselves specialists, i.e. letterpress printers OR
hand bookbinders OR hand papermakers, etc. And while the Hamady
school certainly encourages the artist as total bookmaker, it is also
true that sometimes Walter Hamady himself worked with master
bookbinders such as Bill Anthony. When I was directing Minnesota
Center for Book Arts in the mid-1990s, one of my first big surprises
was how specialized the artists/craftspeople in that community
considered themselves within a specific area of book arts, whereas I
had studied with Hamady and was used to artists taking on the whole
of the bookmaking project, not just a part of it.

This all gets more complicated as more people, from any and all of
the schools of handmade booking, began working with computers and the
possibilities of design that computers brought along.

I read Dream Songs many years ago and was fascinated with it.  Then, somehow, I tired of it.  Maybe I need to read it again, who knows?  The poet of Berryman's generation who fascinates me at the moment is Muriel Rukeyser. (Am I generationally correct here?) I've had her Collected in my home for decades but could never get the key I needed into it.  I found it this weekend.  It's a great poem called, appropriately enough, "The Key".

Before I go further, I'm a huge fan of DS #22- "a teenage cancer, with a plan"

Personally, I like it a lot more than Leaves of Grass, although they are pretty similar in a lot of ways. I find them both self-serving for their particular poets as well as an interesting chronicle to the periods in which they were living (I have a paper on DS about this point, but it's awfully executed).

JB's such a strange guy with his own mixed up views on himself and everything around him, and that to me ends up being the humor in DS, which to an extent may have been a conscious attempt.

I have bought several copies, but only one for myself: I've given two to friends and one to a college literary society I was a member of in my younger and more vulnerable days.

David: Go get sucked into JB's world and report back!

Hi all,

I'm not quite sure what happened but I have actually recommended twice
within the month that two of my non-poet friends read the *Dream Songs*.
They were both looking for good reads, and this was the first thing that
came to mind.

It forced me to pick up my third copy I've owned--this is a book that I give
away on moves and then rebuy shortly after--and song #14 (Life, friends, is
boring...), while making its way into all those anthologies and being a good
stand alone poem and all, does little justice to the overall accruing
strength of the whole.

It may not be at the level of *Leaves of Grass, *the *Cantos, or A*, but I
need to reread the thing and consider why I think this *might* be the case.

Thoughts?

Mary Rising Higgins died last night, August 26, about 7pm.

I know she was in hospice care, but I don't know the details of her
medical condition.

Her books in recent years: Cliff Tides (Singing Horse Press, 2005),
Locus Tides (Potes & Poets Press, 2003), O'Clock (Potes & Poets
Press, 2000), Red Table(s (La Alameda Press, 1999), presented an
amazing body of work over a short period of time. I felt lucky to
know her and hear her read her work.

Well, there's myself at least -- I've taught "Omeros" twice and keep coming back to "The Schooner Flight," perhaps his finest work.  And the Naipaul piece is indeed "astonishing" -- the mere fact Vidia would write anything about ANY Caribbean writer today is worthy of note.

I am writing to announce the publication of my translation of Pura=20

http://www.shearsman.com/pages/books/catalog/2007/lopezcol.html

or here:

http://jasonstumpf.blogspot.com

Composed of five extended sequences, Aurora contemplates the pacts we=20

explore what happens when those bonds of trust and dependence are=20
weakened or broken by infidelity, death, and time. In her writing,=20
L=C3=B3pez-Colom=C3=A9 combines a highly associative lyrical sensibility =
with an=20
insistence on philosophical exactness.

Of the collection, Michael Palmer writes, =E2=80=9CPura =
L=C3=B3pez-Colom=C3=A9=E2=80=99s poems=20
trace spare, vibrant arcs between the realms of matter and spirit,=20
illuminating each with the light of the other. By means of a quiet yet=20=

fervent lyricism, at once celebratory and elegiac, they set out again=20
and again on a voyage beyond self towards a site perhaps impossible=20
fully to determine: mare magnum, 'first scene / of the next day.' It is=20=

our privilege indeed to be invited along.=E2=80=9D

I agree that his poetry resonates with a lot of contemporary music...not that its necessarily played on MTV...but for instance I remember Stephen Malkmus in an interview specifically citing Ashbery as an inspiration.

I loved Dream Songs. I'm not sure whether it's a legit long poem, or a series of monologues. But it is brilliant. Berryman never played it safe. He was always reinventing his verse. Too few poets do this anymore. Louis Gluck, in a very different fashion, does it, which is why she's among a dozen or so major poets still writing.

Not music, but well known actor, David Duchovny often cites Ashbery in interviews as his fave poet.  I think he studied his poetry (w H Bloom?) toward earning his grad degree.  From a Movieline interview:
  "My editor thought you might take a look at this," I say, removing a wad of disorganized fax pages from my bag. Duchovny takes a page and reads aloud: "As Parmigianino did it, the right hand bigger than the head, thrust at the viewer and swerving easily away, as though to protect what it advertises..." He starts to laugh. "Jesus, this is one of my favourite poems. How did she know? It's called Self-Portrait in a Convex Mirror by John Ashbery. It's about a man who's painting a self-portrait, but he's looking into a mirrored ball, and the closer he gets to it, the further away his image seems to be going. For me, that would be the acting style that I'm trying to do. I'm trying to protect what I advertise. That's my stance on any kind of self-expression. That's as far as I need to go." He pauses, then says, "You could look at this poem for weeks, just weeks."

Hi David,

Dan Bar-On of PRIME responded to your email. I forward it below.

I sent it earlier, but I didn't see it posted to Poetics; I guess the system
hiccuped or something.

I hope this finds you well!

ja
http://vispo.com/PRIME


I find David's question more of a statement than a question. There is no
doubt that the situation of the group is very bad, and I agree with most of
David's statement that we have to move as fast as possible to craete a
Palestinian state, and if there is a way (he as a poet) can help to change
the politics of our region, I would be more than happy.

When I ask myself what I can do, but shout at my government, try to convince
others to do so, I try to do something that can help and change the minds of
the people, mainly the young ones to stop dehumanizing the other, and
understand that their historical narrative is meaningful for them, what
drives it and how can the two be incorporated together.

Yes, we are working, and you can see several things we did lately, and are
doing to make our work wider spread. We got more funding in the meantme,
from the State Department through the AU in DC, and now also from the
European Union, through the Eckert Institute in Germany. We need a lot more
funding to make our book more wide spread, and develop two additional
projects we have in mind.

Thank you for your interest and I hope you can help us too.

Yours

Dan

if it's a writing course, i picked up William Packard's "The Poet's Dictionary" recently at a half price books and while it's not perfect, it had occurred to me that with all the more or less solid examples it would make a pretty good intro to writing poetry text. new it's not too pricy either, so it might be a good choice for that reason too.

The late Kenneth Koch taught poetry in nursing homes. He found it rewarding and wrote at least one book on the subject. The name of the book escapes me, but it wouldn't be hard to find.

Kenneth Koch - I Never Told Anybody:  Teaching Poetry Writing to Old People

One review from Amazon, "This book is a must for anyone working/playing with poetry and involved in introducing others to poetry. What is most astounding is Kenneth Koch's humility and honesty, and his willingness to admit mistakes made in teaching poetry to a group of old people at a nursing home. He divides the book very usefully as well. First he introduces the process from start to finish of the workshops, including some of the seniors' works. In the second half of the book, he prints the poems done by participants for each exercise first, then discusses what occurred during the session. One participant in particular is very much a poet, although he'd never written poetry before, and I fell quite in love with him. However, as the book went to press, Kenneth says, this man passed on. You will thoroughly enjoy this book. Aside from the poetry, it has alot to say about the assumptions we make about old and/or infirm people. "

I Never Told Anybody by Kenneth Koch.  It is available through Teachers & Writers Collaborative, NYC.  I once used it to teach poetry in a senior center, too.  Good luck to you.  Keep it simple and don't insist too hard that the seniors write modern poetry unless you're a genius teacher/poet as Koch was.  Regards, Tom Savage

When I had Poets Press, 1960s, there was the IBM typewriter which had
"proportional spacing" but you couldn't change fonts. If you wanted another
font (italics, for instance) you went to another typewriter, typed up those
lines, or whatever, and then "stripped them in" to the main body of the
camera copy using a light table and single edge razor & white tape. And if
you wanted to justify the right hand margin you counted hairline spaces left
to fill on any given line, and divvied them up amongst the words on that
line, by typing the page over and hitting a hairline space bar the right
number of times between each two words. In effect, you typeset every page
twice.

This was some time before the "Selectric Composer" with its changeable type
balls, and easier justification. My first Selectric Composer cost $2700 --
more than cars in those days.

Before any of this the electric typewriter itself was a great miracle, after
many years of typing on huge, heavy, slow "manual" typewriters. At last you
could compose as fast as, and in the rhythm of, your thought -- or so it
seemed to me. I used it for prose, and actually didn't write much prose till
then. For me, poetry has been a matter of the pen and the notebook, for at
least sixty years.

As to some of the larger questions you bring up: I think Robert Duncan has a
bit to say about the typewritten page vs. the typeset page in his intro to
"GroundWork: Before the War". Both volumes of GroundWork were offset from
his typing. It took some work on his part to convince New Directions that
that was truly how he wanted to go.

Tom, I would suggest not looking at the old as a separate - but often a more
interesting species than the young. Interesting in the sense that the
teaching and writing experience can be more akin to the surprises of the
archeologist (where teaching the young, say, is interesting more in terms of
words like 'potential', and 'future.')

In the last couple of years I have been teaching older adults in communities
as various as centers of folks who have not gone beyond high school (if!),
to extended learning programs where the members are highly educated, retired
from upper echelon careers, etc.  They all got stuff.

In terms of poetry, as stimulus for writing I use many of the same exercises
(or improvisations on such) that work with college and other young adults -
Oulipo, Teachers & Writers, Benadette, etc., etc.  The exercises work to
bring up stuff from various depths, histories, and humor.

An adult who has worked in Civil Rights, or non-profits all her life, or an
ex-Banker or a high school teacher (etc.) puts a different, often fresh
angle on the envelope.

The most difficult or resistant are the folks who got A's in English in
college, studied with a famous Mr. Or Mrs. X, as well know the xyz's of
poetry form as a religious form of conviction. Those ones can be a
predictably pain in the ass, if you do things that go contrary, or bend the
bow in a different direction.

On quick inroad is to get people to draw maps - maps of their rooms, maps of
what they remember of where they grew up. Maps create a means into getting
at the images/details that are or have been most local to their lives.

In terms of writing memoirs, there are no doubt road maps to get people
going - and I think those classes are often quite popular, though I have not
gone there.

Good luck,

Stephen V

I tried using this. I don't think Kenneth was really into this - as he was
with the kids.  There is something proforma about the approach and results.
Some OK stuff, but not much that I found useful.

It is John Ashbery, the prolific 80-year-old poet and frequent award winner=

Koch's book is interesting, not real useful, but it points out
possible points of discussion, teaching the elderly.  For example, the
people Koch taught in a nursing home were very infirm.  Fewer older
people are very infirm for a long period anymore.  That might be an
interesting discussion to include in the course if you use the Koch
book.

For example, the friends of the library here is in the energetic
grandparents raising a second generation of children group, 65-85ish.
The president turned the group into an oral history / local history
group sponsoring arts workshops and events at the branch library.

My paternal grandmother LOVED her local senior center -- this was
about 30 years ago, tho.  My maternal grandmother wouldn't be caught
dead there.  My paternal grandmother also went straight to a nursing
home during her decline, while my grandmother lived in assisted living
-- she had her own apartment, but didn't have to cook dinner or clean
-- from her very late 80s until her mid 90s.  During most of that
time, she was not infirm or isolated from the larger community.

A lot of seniors I've met as book fests in particular are really
interested in diy publishing: how to make a chapbook on the computer,
dos and don'ts of lulu.com, what a broadside is, or something like
that might go over really, really well and be fun besides.  Maybe a
collaborative book or collection?

I've had good results with occasional verse, postcard poems, mail art, renga....

Mr. Bell,

I am a community poet (not an academic) active in the
Albany, NY area. I have an MFA degree and years of
workshop experience.

I have presented some informal poetry sessions to
older writers.  I own the handbook by Kenneth Koch
entitled "I Never Told Anybody: Teaching Poetry
Writing to Old People." It is a good guide; however,
most of it is targeted to "nursing home" residents.
Your writers in a senior center will be different from
nursing home residents with regard to manual
dexterity, attention span, memory, hearing acuity,
extent of personal loss and sadness, and ability to
commit to a series of scheduled classes.

I don't know whether your "course" is a formal
composition class or a more informal writing session.
Nor do I know whether it teaches all kinds of writing
(which would be a real challenge) or just poetry.
But if you want to give me a call or a personal email
query, I can share my experiences with you in more
detail.

Words of advice: whatever you do, do not underestimate
the sharp intelligence, wise insight, broad
experience, depth of feeling, or probably
already-in-place strong writing (and memorization)
skills of your seniors. If you are one of them, then
you already know that.

There's not a lot of poetry on Youtube yet, but go there and search Rita
Dove and watch/listen to her at Neruda's grave.

This is sad, sad news.  I'm surprised though not shocked as I know Mary had
survived cancer earlier in life.  Indeed, I believe that was the new lease
that impelled her to such an amazing and radical production.

From the 1999 Red Table(s on she has published some of the most exquisite
and uncompromising poetry of our times.  Ran her "Scaffolds to K" in an
issue of ecopoetics (no. 3).  One of the most beautiful things we were luck=
y
to be able to publish.

More than almost any other contemporary writer I know of (post-Ronald
Johnson), Mary's work has explored the fractal patterns at work in all
materials, across species and languages.  A kind of no holds-barred cosmic
fire irrigating her elegant compositions, informed and structured by
specific (observed) knowledge of other lives, especially botanical and
avian. =20

We'd lost touch in the past year, though I continued to look forward to
meeting her in person.  Another reminder how little one can take for
granted, in this short life . . .

I still have Locus Tides, and O'Clock, waiting to be reviewed.

In the meantime, thanks for the adventures in writing, Mary.  Happy travels

Is it me or are we way overdue for women to be considered for all these recently filled Poet Laureate decisions? (Not that I think the position is indicative of a poet's importance)  Naomi Shihab Nye is an excellent candidate for the voice of America and the voice of the MTV generation right now.

Small Press Distribution still has a few copies of Alan Loney's The Printer
Printed with an introduction by Steve Clay of Granary Books. This
meditation/manifesto was delivered in the Poetry Collection at the
University at Buffalo when Bob Creeley invited him to read there in 2003.

Alan is a terrific poet, skilled printer and a refined thinker on the
relationship between the two. He now lives in Australia where he continues
to print under the sign of Electio Editions.

I'm sorry but whoever repeated that "peaches and herb" anecdote re  Ashbery
is gul-gul-gullible.....you can't live in America and move twenty feet  without
hearing a pop song...clearly that was Ashbery being "cutesy" with his  "high
culture" image....he's heard it all...in elevators, restaurants, and every
where else..if you think he can't sing along with "Can't Touch This,"
octogenarian or not, I have "hair in a can" i want to sell you..it, like,  totally
FOOLS people...

But "Reunited" did Rock. My bff Tammy and I used to perform it at
neighborhood barbecues when we were ten...sigh...memories!

Whatever one may make of his various works, I think Sherman Alexie
would be a great candidate for an MTV laureate. (I'm not his biggest
fan, but do think he'd be great Mtv Laureate.) His work continually
makes use --hilarious, angry, bitter, turned upside down inside
out--of popular culture, movies, music, tv, basketball, popular
/assigned books, comic books, He often writes and says a lot of things
that the American culture high and low, select or mass--would prefer
to go unsaid and unheard, that keep things unsettling and
uncomfortable.  He can be devastatingly annihilatingly analytical of
the   gigantic crock of BS in the US and hysterically funny within the
same sentence.
      (Ah! But he doesn't write New Sentences!-- some might
object--protesting the "Marginalization of ['Real'] Poetry."  But
doesn't John Ashbery already cover some of this "Real Poetry" ground?)

     Heard him recently give talk with a reading in which he described
airline profiling from the point of view of an American Indian.  In
the first place--WHAT are you?   WHERE are you FROM?  Asia?  Southwest
Asia? Latin America? Not like you see a lot of Indians flying the
friendly skies of America!
       After all, aren't America's First Peoples also its first
Guantanamo Poets?

        Americans build "Seperation" Walls and fences in Baghdad, on
the Mexican border and give billions for the world's biggest, best
equipped, Super-Max Security one in Palestine.  And why not?  Don't
they already have a long history and expertise in this form of ethnic
cleansing, anti-terrorism, National security?

         "They are still calling us 'savages,' 'terrorists,'" says
Leonard Peltier from his prison cell.   So what do you do when "one of
them" gets on the nice airplane?

Call for Papers:  FEMINIST ACTIVISM IN THE ACADEMY

The slogan that the personal is political has not
always made clear how feminists navigate the
professional realm.  We seek to compile a volume
entitled Feminist Activism in the Academy.  Articles
for the volume will examine the intersections among
the personal, political, and professional realms and
the ways in which feminist activists come to life in
the Academy.  The proposed volume will bring together
perspectives on activism in the academy from a variety
of disciplines and interdisciplines.

Primary areas of focus include: self-identification of
women academics; activism in and out of the classroom;
activism in and out of formal Women's
Studies curricula; women*s status in the academic
workplace.  This special volume will provide a forum
in which scholars will come together to identify and
define problems in their work lives and/or examine
their own brand of activism as it pertains to their
professional day-to-day lives and their careers as a
whole.  Essays can focus on one particular experience
or location or can be comparative in nature.

The larger arch under which we wish to gather essays
in this volume is bell hooks' notion that the
classroom remains the most radical space of
possibility in the academy, the place where activism
starts with the essential movement against and beyond
boundaries, a movement which makes education the
practice of freedom. In light of this notion, we
encourage discussions and explorations of the
interconnections between feminist pedagogies and
activism and between the status of feminist scholars
and teachers in the Academy and institutionalized
politics of exclusion, silencing, or marginalization
that adversely affect the overall status of women in
the academic professions.

Essay topics include but are not limited to:
Student activists:  Programming with a feminist
consciousness
Women as professor-activists:  Making a difference
Women administrators:  Making changes without getting
fired
Women's Studies curricula
The personal as political
Local activism
Service-learning
Inclusion of local women activists
Extra-curricular programming
Celebrating women's anniversaries in the Academy (e.g.
Co-education, First woman X)
Quid pro quo and/versus hostile environment harassment
Benevolent sexism in the Academy
Training for change in the Academy
Title VII and the Academy
Title IX and the Academy
What works for women scholars in other nations:
learning and applying, others'lessons
Mothering/grandmothering in the Academy

Essays of 15-25 pages in length should be submitted
electronically by February 1, 2008, to Domnica
Radulescu (radulescud@wlu.edu) and Ellen Mayock
(mayocke@wlu.edu).

Essays should be submitted in MS-Word format,
with parenthetical notes and complete references
formatted according to the MLA Handbook of Style.
Brief, 75-word bios must accompany essay submissions.

Yes! Although I would have, as first choice, Kathy Acker if she were
still alive. For me, Anne Waldman or Erica Hunt or Alice Notley or
Harryette Mullen or Dodie Bellamy or . . .

My Eclipse


"Are there bread-crumbs on the moon?" I ask M.
"There's precisely one bread-crumb on the moon."
He offers me whiskey and I drink half-glass; he won't stop otherwise,
We're staring at the stars.
A large Hudson drives down the street below us, full of merry-makers;
it's the total eclipse of the moon!
It's three in the morning and we haven't seen anything yet.
It's four.
It's five in the morning and the curtain descends at a distance.
You can see earthlight as frustrated earth denies its own shadow.
"There you are, that's the disk I've been telling you about."
"The moon is round, isn't it?"
The bread-crumb would have dried up by now, blown hither and yon by
lunar winds.
"There aren't any lunar winds."
"Are you telling me... because of the vacuum... the very absence of air...
that the moon is windless? I don't believe it!"
"I've heard that, it must be true! Not a breeze!"
"Nothing! Not a breeze!"

Why not Bob Holman on MTV? I haven't been to the bleeding apple in years, but he seemed to do a good job at the Nuyorican Cafe. No, he's not exactly Ashberry, but the man can perform. He'd keep the kids tuned in.

Samples of up to 30 pages of literary fiction or creative nonfiction
or 10 poems may be submitted in August only for book or chapbook
consideration.

full-length books. Novels will not be considered. There is no reading
fee. Please label your envelopes "Open Submission" and include SASE.
Full manuscripts will be requested if necessary. This year's open
reading period will extend to September 15th (postmarked).

Spire Press is now requesting poems and short prose (fiction and
non-fiction =96 no essays =96 less than 3,000 words) for a new anthology
with the theme: Class in America. We need work that explores economic
class from all groups and angles, no boring sob stories. Please be
fascinating and reflective. The title for this anthology is still
undetermined.

Please label your envelopes "Anthology Submission" and limit your
submission to three poems or one prose piece. Include SASE for reply.
All other submissions will be discarded.

Holman should have been on MTV during his stretch as emcee at the Nuyorican.
I think around 1992 he and some of the Nuyorican Poets actually appeared on
MTV. His style would bring people in and keep them interested in the
spectacle, if not the poetry per se. And some people might watch him for the
hype and later discover they like poetry. I'm a little surprised that it
hasn't happened already.

In the meantime can't we ask that the male laureates appear half the year in
drag? Though, in Washington parlance, that might be called a 'cover-up.'
But such Laurel enhancing gear has legit Roman & Greek roots - if what I see
on some of those vases is true. Non?

We got it - here on the West Coast -  while it was still real dark. Great
sustained moment:


 My Eclipse - Journal

 I rose about 1:15 to see the first ink drop shadow.
Woke back up again at three o'clock and stood spellbound on the back porch
for the next hour and a half. Wow. Had me rocked!  The gradual intense
dwindling of the light. The banana red marble in the darkness. Complete with
the shooting star at about full eclipse, like a long thin white arrow
fleeting under it. Then a flicker, speedy red flickering light, that dashed
above across the darkened sky. (Was it a plane...so fast??).
 Then a thin a vibrating yellow yoke, a crown about the sides and edges.
A stillness
Then, the sunny white cap piece strikes the left side of the upper pole. The
initial solar flash, floating there.  That was down right spiritual - the
awakening sense out of darkness.

I'd go for a repeat. Hear another one is supposedly coming in 2008(?). Maybe
this one was special because it was also a full moon(??).

Wow.

Brilliant!  Charles Simic as Anne Sexton. But if we can't achieve this then my male votes for Poet Laureates of the MTV gen go to Thomas Sayers Ellis, Terrance Hayes, Eugene Gloria and Louise Gluck (because she has brass ones and she's just cold and distant enough in her work to be gender questionable-- sans the tell-tale head shot on back covers.

(No offense my sensitive poet brothers and no offense to you,Louise, you are the real awe-inspiring poetic deal.)

My choices for females not still living: Reetika Vazirani and Sarah Hannah (And this applies to any generation not just our MTV gen. What sadness and loss for us all to be without such gifts that surely would have made it into our poetic canonicals (the female one at least-- right up there with Bishop in my opinion.)

Nemesis eh?  Well, I'll even go with the brilliant breathtaking poets Eleanor Wilner, Anne Marie Macari, Kimiko Hahn, Diane Gilliam Fisher, Sarah Manguso, Sonia Sanchez, Annie Boutelle, Ellen Dore Watson ect.. ect..  I guess my point is its our time too and there are plenty to choose from without dipping into the same masculine barrel.  I like all our male poets fine -- even love and adore many (Mark Doty, Mathew Zapruder, Frank Bidart, even our two "winners" ) but I can do with some really good strong female voices  that represent our country outside the worshipping circle of Maya Angelou.

I am very fond of someone's idea of a celebrity deathmatch between Simic and Ashbery--now if I can only choose which Victorian female poet they each should "duel read" against eachother. Emily Bronte's stinky "Hope" in slam fashion as read by Simic? Now that I would pay good money for, if I made good money as a poet.

The press release seems to be hyping this as a novel sort of idea. I
originally was hoping that this contest for "college students" would be
limited to undergraduate (that is what college implies isn't it) students.
The guidelines quite clearly show that all university students undergraduate
or graduate may send in submissions. My question is: how is this any
different from any first book contest?  It is an uphill battle to be taken
seriously as an undergrad writer and this contest does nothing to address
that. Am I off base here? Why hype the contest as a search for young college
talent blah blah blah hype-cakes and then open it up to so many poets who
are already finding avenues for their work? I have a feeling I am repeating
myself so I will stop now. I am sorry if I have offended graduate students.

poet Ross Martin (THE COP WHO RIDES ALONE) used to work in some sort
of senior producing capacity at MTVu, I thought

when I see this sort of thing, I think of probably someone like Ross
who is pushing for something for poetry because he can, and I find it
difficult to grouse about it

 The Yak Blessing
Kathup Tsering

"Drum of a dying nation, Kathup Tsering demonstrates in his new work that breath is one's license. For thirteen years, he has dreamed, built, and graciously shared a consciousness constructed by three significant cultural forces - Tibet, the People's Republic of China, and India - and all while living in exile, much of it amid the cleansing waters and cross-cultural clime of Himalaya's ancient spires. It is with an acuity and sternness of words that Tsering conveys the most intimate of painful experiences with sensitivity, and an anticipation for renewal. With brilliance seated in both the traditional and contemporary sphere, his achievement is that he is helping to shape and re-define contemporary Indian poetry; and in doing so, reaffirms that one's voice need not be relegated to any particular genre. As with the penetrating "Don't Be Afraid, Mother," each word chosen seems to delicately trace itself, the poet's observations and passions rooted in what is open and
 beautiful. His collection re-animates, one could say, those lost in such areas as Barkhor, or the dedicated snowy trails leading to Nepal -- and eventual freedom." --Alexander Jorgensen.

Some interesting video on Larry Craig online. Seems he was singled-out during a Washington investigation of a cocaine and page boy ring during the 1980s.


---

The complaint said Craig then tapped his right foot several times and moved it closer to Karsnia's stall and then moved it to where it touched Karsnia's foot. Karsnia recognized that "as a signal often used by persons communicating a desire to engage in sexual conduct," the complaint said.


 Craig then passed his left hand under the stall divider into Karsnia's stall with his palm up and guided it along the divider toward the front of the stall three times, the complaint said.

The officer then showed his police identification under the divider and pointed toward the exit "at which time the defendant exclaimed `No!'" the complaint said.

For the rest of the story:

Dear All, I just received notice from Eric Mader that Drew Stroud/ Ryu
Makoto, fine poet and owner of Saru Press suffered a serious stroke on
June 25th and has been in a coma at UC Medical Center ICU, San
Francisco, ever since.

Friends may contact the hospital social worker, Elizabeth Manning at
manninge@surgery.ucsf.edu.  I can also share Ms. Manning's work and
pager numbers back-channel.  Perhaps poets on this list who reside in
and around San Francisco can find out what's happening and let us all
know.  Thanks, Jesse Glass

Listmembers might enjoy some of these "totally unfounded rumours".

     http://unfoundedrumors.blogspot.com/2007_06_01_archive.html

Actually, I don't know whether they are "genuine" totally unfounded rumours...

... or maybe someone made them up, and so they may be "untrue" totally unfounded rumours, but some of them are strangely poetic, whatever the origin.

I love the one about Charles de Gaulle:

     French General Charles de Gaulle once killed a man
     during World War II by cutting his throat with a
     deep-frozen flounder.

Although I'm glad to learn the specifics of this story which I only heard briefly on the radio this morning, I'd like to know what this scandal has to do with poetry until someone writes a poem about it.  Matthew Shepard's anthology is a great book by the way.  I only rediscovered it yesterday.  It has a poem in it by John Ashbery, of all people.  Regards, Tom Savage

There have been plenty of women poet laureates in recent years, among
them Rita Dove,
Louise Gluck, and others.  What there have not been are gay or lesbian
poets.  So I stand
in support of John Ashbery for MTV poet laureate!  Plus he's a wonderful

either Camille or Carroll would work on MTV. Jim Carroll was, and perhaps he still is, a legit rocker. He's probably still younger then anyone in the Stones.  His Catholic Boy album was one of the better pieces of vinyl produced in the eighties. He's a very good poet. Check out his "The Book of Nods." & Paglia too. She can entertain, and she's into rock and poetry, although she's not an Ashbery fan. Harold Bloom was her mentor at Yale. Bloom, Mr. Canonized himself, a guy who has always been in Ashbery's corner. Having a mouth as biting as Paglia's would be fun. Why not Carroll and Paglia?

I wouldn't exactly say there have been "plenty of women poet laureates", though they were appointed more recently than earlier:

U.S. Poet Laureate Timeline [1937 - 2006 =  37 Men and 8 Women] --
http://amyking.org/blog/?p=192

But agreed:  Ashbery is a good choice for MTVu because his poetry is lively and will appeal to the "multi-tasking" and "multi-associating" attention spans of those raised with the internet on their screens and in their hands ...  his range of work will certainly appeal to those new emerging literacies.  As for Paglia, I think she'd be a short-lived choice as her poetry wouldn't have the reach among the teen and twenty somethings that Ashbery's would.

As for Susan's point about the gaping lack of missing gay and lesbian poets -- a hearty yes!

Cryptic Philosophy of Dispersion


Reification as false consciousness in relation to mediation of labor

BUT commodities in relation to exchange-value are transformed into
fields of exchange - the ontology of commodities becomes a process-
ontology (as opposed to state)

Statements are reification / residue - their communality establishes
virtual community (all communities are virtual)

Commodities and statements are field phenomena (re: Minsky, mind)

(Field phenomena are virtual) (Processes are virtual)

BUT what do we mean by virtual?

Processes and communities are measurable through verification
procedures inhabiting inscriptions

Don't all verification procedures inhabit inscriptions?

What constitutes the MATERIAL SUBSTRATE of verification?

One can imagine an OBJECT, but one can also imagine a REPORT

OBJECTS REPORT

Inscriptions are REPORTS OF REPORTS

REPORTS SPLIT into constituent syntactical elements

Semantics : MATERIAL SUBSTRATE :: syntactics : INHABITED INSCRIPTIONS

Rewriting Marx via Lukacs: "A commodity is therefore not a thing at all.
The social character of human labor appears to us as an objective
character stamped upon processes which problematize the very concept of
objective character. Social relations are smeared among processes and
consciousnesses, among the social and a hypothetical objectivity. Not
commodities, but commodification is simultaneously perceptible and
imperceptible, and commodification undermines the very concept of 'thing'
as well as 'ding an sich.' The relationships among humans and processes
are incapable of disentanglement; we are far from the techne of Marx and
classical reification of Lukacs."

Rewriting Foucault: "Concepts such as discontinuity, rupture, threshold,
limit, series, and transformation all characterize, not only the analogic
and digital, but the liminal regions of consciousness and physicality
inhabiting (not existing within) the virtual. Now we can call 'formula-
tion' the individual or collective process that construes signs, signing,
tagging, and/or inscription (keeping in mind that THE VIRTUAL IS ALWAYS
INSCRIPTION). Formulation, if an event at all, is a smeared or stained
process which can never be localized (located by its spatio-temporal
coordinates); it need not relate to an author, issue from an author (real
or virtual or bot or any Other/other); if one insists that formulation is
performative, then one must also insist that THE WORLD ITSELF IS PERFORM-
ATIVE. There is no getting around the sign, getting around with it; it is
easier than one might think to get around without it."

"_Letter Deity._ Then, think that [the mind realizing the ultimate deity]
appears in the sky in the aspect of the written letters of the mantra of
the appropriate deity. Think that the mind having the aspect of [realis-
ing] the suchness of oneself and the deity as undifferentiable has become
a moon disc and that on it [the letters] are set in order [the sounds of
the letters mixing with the form] like very pure mercury adhering [that
is, mixing completely with] grains of gold. This is the letter deity."
(Tsong-ka-pa, The Yoga of Tibet, The Great Exposition of Secret Mantra,
trans. Jeffrey Hopkins.)

Akasa (space, principle of accommodation): "Akasa ever remains untouched
by dust and darkness. Dust and darkness appear and disappear; they are
contingent; but akasa ever remains as it is. They are not anything that
itself arises and perishes, nor do they ever become dirty; not becoming
dirty they cannot even be said to have become pure, for they never were
impure; in truth they lie beyond the determinate natures of pure and
impure. They ever remain untouched by dust and water." (Reworked from
Nagarjuna's Philosophy as presented in The Maha-Prajnaparamita-Sastra, K.
Venkata Ramanan.)

Begin with singularities within a classical Wittgenstein (TLP) / Hertz
axiomatic tradition; subtract the logicism; liquify the singularities;
channel them through Waddington's chreods; channel them through hierarchic
networks; channel them through holarchic networks; eliminate the nodes and
channels; transform the liquidity into dust-motilities; transform the
dust-motilities into radiations; transforms the traditions into groundless
flux-processes; whirl the flux-processes around the interned memory of
singularities and axiomatics; report back to the reports; report nowhere;
whirl the flux-processes around the reports; remember deaths and annihila-
tions; whirl the deaths, the annihilations...

big penis rock hard balls joy ride history of the world

teenage boys drive big penises and wear big penis ornaments and we're all
pushing our tiny penises around the playing field or looking for a rhyme
to hid our tiny penises while we arm ourselves with big penis guns and
missiles all pointy and the like to kill big and little penises anywhere
we can, we want to be the only penises in sight and we want our tiny
penises hidden but our big penis houses and big giant penis top-fuel
dragsters in sight so we can raise big-penis fear while we stain books and
canvas with big penis smearings while our tiny penises throb and shake,
teenage boys send big penis smearings across networks and wires smearing
tags blowing bits and bytes while big penises announce they are hot and
ready and there and their tiny penises shake with joy and happiness and
our big penis arms push tiny penis boys into dirt and girls and big penis
legs throw bombs into books made from bombs and we big-penis love
everything that thumps and throws giant balls into girl ball party groups,
makes big penis sound jump the curb, when we drive we say Our big penis
has arrived, Yes, Our big penis is here, we write big penis books, we
point big penises, big giant penises, enormous penises, things disappear

That's a laudably bold and clear stand for a great poet any language should
be proud of.
I remember, you wrote - "John Ashbery is America's greatest living poet, he
is also greatly misunderstood".

Whether Ashbery and MTV go together is a mute point, but the "old folks
can also write" verbatim confounded me. Poets aren't soccer players, I
always thought. There are scores of old poets, both men and women,
that I can think of in a large number of languages around the world who
have written/write competent (if not good or new) poetry. Adonis, for
example,
at 75+ is an outstanding example - a probable Nobel candidate for 2008.

Ferlinghetti still writes good poetry (if not inspiring) at 88. So does
Snyder.
There are others, don't forget Diane di Prima.

I'd like to quote Ashbery here on the challenges and virtues of older poets
from a John Tranter (& Jacket Magazine) interview of JA from 1988 -

"Also I think the fact that the older one gets - for many people, at least -
the more prolific one gets, realising there aren't the oceans of time that
seem to be stretching ahead when one was young. And one learns to use it,
and realise how precious it is."

I have been working with John Ashbery for about three years now
on a self-funded translation (into Bengali) project which I recently
concluded
with an interview (to appear in Kaurab, September 07) , the Bengali version
of which is due to appear in Kabisammelan, a poetry-monthly published
from Kolkata, India. Here is a little sneak preview from that interview - a
response
which I liked a lot...see that as exemplary for younger poets like us - when
asked
about if he still reads his contemporaries, JA reflects -

"I don't read the work of my friends anymore (smiles)...specially my own
work, which I don't read at all. So I don't have much idea as to what New
York School poetry is like. Basically, of late I like to read the more young
contemporary poets, many of them have been influenced by me and who have
then gone on to write their own and are now influencing me. "



I'll put my hands together for such an "old folk".

34 men--three were repeats.

Since it's a political appointment, there should obviously be
something like proportional representation. Has anyone checked which
states they came from? If we say that Frost represents New Hampshire,
for instance, shouldn't there have been 20 from New York? Clearly
impractical, but is the breakdown by regions appropriate? Could the
injustices be righted by appointing posthumously poets for all of the
unclaimed years between 1776 and 1937? Like the conversions of the
dead practiced by the (unrepresented) Mormons? An advantage of this
solution is that the dead rarely complain about how they're identified.

No First Nations laureates. No handicapped. No Little People. Too
many Jews. No Asians. Not a single Moslem, Hindu, Buddhist. Are there
enough Catholics? William Carlos Williams is the closest thing to Latino.

I spot one gay and one lesbian, but there may be others whose
orientation I don't know. Shouldn't those short-listed be asked and outed?

A wrinkle is that the demographics of 1937 and 2007 are not the same.
So maybe the population breakdown for the entire period should be
averaged. Just so we know what's fair.

How about the relative dearth of essential poets, regardless of group
identity? The great ones seem to have been appointed almost by
mistake, and way too many are conspicuous by their absence.

Camille Paglia actually writes poetry and doesn't just criticize it?

That's an amazing quote. Ah, to be read by John Ashbery! Far and above the new smartass answer I'm going to have the next time someone at a poetry slam gets bewildered and asks me who I'm supposed to be writing for, the fanboy thrill I get at speculating "I wonder if Ashbery has ever stumbled across one of my measly publications?!?!" is a fantastic reminder that the point of writing poetry is not publication, money, awards or tenured professorships, nor is it therapy, making political statements, or developing your spirituality. I suppose poetry can be used for all of those things, but i think when it comes down to it the point, for most of us who take the writing seriously, is to be read by intelligent, sympathetic eyes. Personally, I think that's as admirable as goals come.

I think Jim Carroll would be an excellent MTV laureate. Or going the other direction for someone who's more rocker than poet, Patty Smith might be a good choice.

Also, to chime in on the carroll book recommendations, anyone who hasn't read forced entries and living at the movies is missing a treat.

> either Camille or Carroll would work on MTV. Jim Carroll was, and perhaps he still is, a legit rocker. He's probably still younger then anyone in the Stones.  His Catholic Boy album was one of the better pieces of vinyl produced in the eighties. He's a very good poet. Check out his "The Book of Nods." & Paglia too. She can entertain, and she's into rock and poetry, although she's not an Ashbery fan. Harold Bloom was her mentor at Yale. Bloom, Mr. Canonized himself, a guy who has always been in Ashbery's corner. Having a mouth as biting as Paglia's would be fun. Why not Carroll and Paglia?

Your's a great comment too. Agreed and Encore. That's precisely what
thrilled me too.
Also, we are not getting younger, so it was wonderful to hear of such a
promising recipe
one could fall back on during some of those moribund phases that are soon to
come along.

Ashbery talked about young film-directors too, who had been influenced by
him, and now
he is trying to reverse the admiration trying to come full circle.

An ideal laureate for ANY-TV.

All,

  I'm seriously waiting for there to be a Bravo program with the above title coming out soon.  Challenges could include writing poems FOR events/occassions/people, making  chapbooks of poems, or selecting poems out of a stack for a collection.  Maybe one challenge could be dealing with rejection letters!

  At first I thought this was a terrible idea, and then it occurred to me that some of the shows on Bravo now deal with industries the "average American" (who has no maps, I learned this week) has really no clue about.  These shows don't really give insight into these industries (do people really have to make bar food when interviewing for jobs as chefs?) and yet people watch them with great eagerness.  I think it can totally be done.  Maybe another Ashberry project?

  Also, I realized I never introduced myself to the list.  My name is Amish Trivedi and I live in Iowa City, Iowa with my wife Jennifer.  I "maintain" the most self-centered and whiny blog, The Trivedi Chronicles (http://trivedichronic.blogspot.com).  I work at the University of Iowa's Main library and use said library to fuel my need for poetry and, well, money to buy poetry.

  I just thought I'd share.

  Best,
  Amish

A 41-year old musical colleague....
               MTV is 27 years old, so what is the MTV generation
anyway?

       Anyway, Steve's a great guitarist/singer...combined some nice
soulful melodies and some "avant" noise aspects
              for many he, and P Harvey and others, were the essence
of that "indie-rock" 90s,
      in contrast to the more commercial 90s indie rock, after
Cobain, went into Pearl Jam/STP/Live/Creed progressively more macho
late 90s arena postures.
I'm sure Wiki says this better.
    It was cool working in the studio with him in '98; he's just
finishing up a new album....

WCW never actually got to serve, despite what you may read in that timeline.
There was effective McCarthyite opposition to his appointment -- As this was
also the time of his failing health, the effective eventual disguise for what
actually happened was that he was unable to serve for health reasons --





I attended a huge reading of former LOC Poetry Consultants (what it was called
before it became the Laureateship) that included Bishop -- When I asked her to
sign a book, she heard my name, said "Danish, right?" and spelled it correctly

They were "consultants in poetry to the Library of Congress" until
1986, when we ceased to be a democracy. They have almost no duties,
though in recent years they've acted more importantly. WCW did
nothing--he wasn't allowed to serve because he was a red.

Any day now we'll have other honorary appointments--maybe "gentleman
of the President's bedchamber" or "royal equerry."

I imagine that there's a point after which embarrassment will set in,
no matter how good the gig. Maybe not.

BE IN DC ON SEPTEMBER 15, 2007!

HERE'S WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW:
~ The Plan for the Day - Gathering time and place, maps & housing
~ How to get to DC - By bus, van, car, plane, train and metro

~ THE PLAN FOR SEPT. 15 ~

On Saturday, September 15, tens of thousands of people from across the country will gather at 12 noon at the White House (north side, in and around Lafayette Park) and then march to the Capitol (west side). (The Ellipse on the south side of the White House is closed for maintenance repairs.)

Please see below for detailed information.

Click below to view and print a map (8.5x11 inch PDF):
http://www.pephost.org/site/R?i=eNyyj-qrnDjvFSU0zSCgvg..

The march will go from the White House to the Capitol Building. The front contingent of the march will be Iraq war veterans, family members of soldiers and marines and other veterans. When the march arrives at Congress, the Iraq War Veterans and family members will be the leadership of a mass die-in symbolizing the deaths of an estimated 4,000 U.S. servicemembers. A powerful representation of the death of hundreds of thousands of Iraqis will be the other central component of this dramatic confrontation with Congress at the time that they will be debating spending another $100 billion to sustain the criminal occupation of Iraq.

The Die-In is a civil disobedience action and those participating may risk arrest. There will be a permitted rally taking place simultaneously with the Die-In. All those who cannot afford to risk arrest will be able to participate in the permitted rally that will take place on the West Lawn of the Capitol Building.

Sign up today:

YES, I can join the mass march in Washington DC on September 15. Click this link to sign up:

There will be information packets about logistics and legal Know Your Rights information sent to all those participating. The National Lawyers Guild Mass Defense Committee and the Partnership for Civil Justice will be providing legal support for the demonstration.

An email update with details about the September 16-21 Week of Action will be sent out later this week.

Airports

There are three airports in the Washington DC area:

Ronald Reagan Washington National (DCA)

WE CAN'T DO IT WITHOUT YOUR HELP ~

The ANSWER Coalition has provided thousands of dollars as a scholarship to help Iraq veterans and other veterans get on the bus to join the September 15 protest. Thousands of Iraq war veterans want to join the protest. The biggest obstacle is lack of money. If you cannot come to Washington DC yourself but would like to provide a transportation subsidy for others, you can do so by clicking this link to make a generous donation:

I agree that it doesn't. That was meant as sarcasm; however, many people in the US still have a childlike faith in capitalism and "the system."

is to be read by intelligent, sympathetic eyes. Personally, I think that's

also, there's Jeffery McDaniel, author of The Splinter Factory. He's a fine poet, and I think he's still in his thirties. Another slammer, Patricia Smith. If I'm not mistaken, she's also a woman. I'd like to see  Billy Collins or Robert Pinsky get their dignity ruffled up in a Jerry Springer exchange, find the rowdiest, most anti-authoritarian kids on the block and let them have a go at an ex poet L. Go at them HENRY ROLLINS style...

Also, to chime in on the carroll book recommendations, anyone who hasn't read forced entries and living at the movies is missing a treat.

His Catholic Boy album was one of the better pieces of vinyl produced in the eighties. He's a very good poet. Check out his "The Book of Nods." & Paglia too. She can entertain, and she's into rock and poetry, although she's not an Ashbery fan. Harold Bloom was her mentor at Yale. Bloom, Mr. Canonized himself, a guy who has always been in Ashbery's corner. Having a mouth as biting as Paglia's would be fun. Why not Carroll and Paglia?

one of my students at the NEng Conservatory has been taken over by poetry &
Ashbery is his fave--maybe he should send him a poem, which he has hesitated
to do.

I think Amiri Baraka would be a great Laureate.  He's by far one of
the best reader/performers i've ever seen/heard/met.  Not only
vocally--his accompanying himself with drumming--on a lectern last
time i saw him, this Spring, when he electrified a huge young urban
crowd at University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee.  He also gave the only
talk i ever heard that made you really want to go to school, get
educated and keep on educating yourself the rest of your life.

   Baraka's a walking encyclopedia of Black Music and Culture and one
of the greatest writers ever on the subject as well as bringing it
into and keeping it real in his writing and life.  The recordings he's
made since the 1960's are among the best you'll ever hear by an
American poet.  Sonny's Time Now lp is one of my favorite recordings
in any genre of all time--with "Leroi Jones", Don Cherry, Sonny Murray
et al.  Don Cherry turned me on to The System of Dante's Hell which
remains as Pound wd say "news that stays News" to this day.

     I imagine he wouldn't be allowed to be the laureate,  an immense
loss.  He's one the great cultural figures of the last almost half
century now, what the Japanese call "a National Treasure".

      (I know he's controversial--but remember when and how much
Cassius Clay/Muhammad Ali was?  Before everybody decided they loved

Baraka before it's too late. He is, let's face it, old. During the filming of Prairie Home Companion, Paul Anderson filled in for Altman just in case. I wish we could have a more
  controversial Laureate, lose the tweed factor.

I agree.  Naomi Shihab Nye would be a great candidate among current women poets.  It's not a competition, fortunately or unfortunately.  I don't think nominations by us or almost anybody matter much.  Still, her poetry is not only outstanding, it's also incredibly accessible for a current poet of major importance and interest.  Thanks for bringing her up.  I don't think I've ever seen her name mentioned on this listserv during the three years I've been on this service.  Regards, Tom Savage

hm, talk about shameful fannish paranoia. I'm going to pretend that mr. ashbery is unaware of the existence of this list in order to prevent my self from constantly thinking "I better make sure this sounds good, i don't want Ashbery (or anyone else for that matter) to think I'm an idiot."

actually, that might be a good thing. one should probably always consider what one is about to say is going to make one look like an imbecile. I've never really had that particular gag reflex, unfortunately.

Far and above the new smartass answer I'm going to have the next time someone at a poetry slam gets bewildered and asks me who I'm supposed to be writing for, the fanboy thrill I get at speculating "I wonder if Ashbery has ever stumbled across one of my measly publications?!?!" is a fantastic reminder that the point of writing poetry is not publication, money, awards or tenured professorships, nor is it therapy, making political statements, or developing your spirituality. I suppose poetry can be used for all of those things, but i think when it comes down to it the point, for most of us who take the writing seriously, is to be read by intelligent, sympathetic eyes. Personally, I think that's as admirable as goals come.

As September is almost upon us, I'm putting out the sometimes word on =
the list of links I keep for Portland State University's English =
Department.
This is a list mainly of on-line literary journals with legs, and =
personal sites and blogs of digital literary artists, along with some =
research sites.=20
As it's on a public university's server, no sites that have anything for =
sale are allowed.
If you want to be added to this list, which I'm happy to hear is quite =
popular around the Net, please let me know:
weishaus@pdx.edu

The page is at: http://web.pdx.edu/~pdx00282/cew/cew.htm

Thanks,

I agree with most of your enemies, but in my experience your friends Effort Concentration and Awareness are like the salesmen of the enemies, pushing them on us like a drug. "Hey kid," says Awareness, "Howzabout you and me go over here and smoke us some doubt." "Good idea," says Concentration, "and while we're at it I've got some liquid Craving we can drop, and I'm sure my buddy Awareness has some powdered A&A we could snort." "A&A" says Effort. "What's that?" "It's a speedball of Aversion and Agitation, that gives rise to Apathy which is almost as good as being blissed out on Sloth, but cheaper."

to counter this effect, I have learned to make a friend of the wu-wei of writing. of writing without writing. not writing effortlessly, not exerting oneself to effortlessness, but rather through a holistic cultivation of the sloth alkaloid which can be profitably extracted from sick days, three day weekends, and late nights watching DVDs of old movies. A much maligned but endlessly useful entheogen, I have found that sloth, if not abused, can be used to transcend the efforts of Effort and Co. to move into a mystical state of notwriting in which my best writing is always produced.

Of course, it's difficult to be in this state, and difficult to move away from it, because again in my experience, the more you try not to write the less writing actually gets done. Note that this is not counter intuitive.

The end method, if it can be called such a thing, is to attempt to cultivate an activity in which one is neither writing nor notwriting. It is in this state that notwriting will begin, so long as you don't overdose on sloth and unintentionally give way to intention.

The danger exists, of course, of becoming a sloth junkie, and those of us who have learned how to ride that particular horse have all fallen by the wayside from time to time, spending months, sometimes years strung out on the stuff. But then, that's when you really have to turn to Aversion and Agitation to straighten out and get back on the path...

The First Amendment is the first "security" and Protection Under the
Law Americans and residents in USA are supposed to have, yet as the
translation of the Guantanamo poetry shows, there is a rampant
suspicion that foreign languages, especially Arabic, are automatically
"suspect" the moment they are spoken, written, read and taught. (The
huge storm over an Arabic language school in NYC for example.)
  Fear of illegal aliens from Mexico especially is in part due to a
fear for the "National Language of America" (English) having to rub
shoulders with a rapidly growing number of Spanish and bi-lingual
citizens if the illegals "are allowed to have their way/say."
    Now, coming to a campus near you in October, will be National
Islamo-Fascism Awareness Week--further coupling Islam and Terror and
adding on  the Arabic language for ever increased vigilance and
"Homeland Security."
     The War on Terror turning into a War on a Language becomes a
threat to Freedom  of Speech.  Ironically, insanely, rather than
simply fighting the War "over there" so it will not come "here," the
War against "the Arabic-Islamo-Terrorism" World (all three being
equated as one) is being brought straight into the American schools,
Universities, Campuses as well as two in Israel.
       Suddenly Hate Speech is "defending" the country against Freedom
of Speech.
        Welcome to the Land of the Brave & the Home of the Free.

never seen anything quite like it in my life. i'll be damned if i'm

Five Enemies

Doubt: Three kinds of doubt:

Doubt in oneself; doubt in the efficacy and usefulness of writing in
general; doubt in the writing project before one.

>> It's the opposite for me; if I didn't doubt almost to the point of
annihilation, I couldn't work at all. It's intrinsic in the process.

Aversion (ill will, anger): I dont want to do this. I dont want to write
right now. Writing is stupid. This project is stupid. I dont feel like
writing right now. I hate writing in general. I hate this whole book idea.
This task is boring. I dont like this aspect of that. I dont like that
aspect of this. I dont like, I dont like, I dont like.

>> The same. As PIL says Anger is an energy. I need it.

Craving: Two kinds.

Extrinsic: Desiring to do something else. Desiring a state that is not
present. I want to do something else, watch a movie, I want to go
bicycling instead of writing.

>> But I do! Writing is too difficult and the sooner I get it sent off,
the sooner I can breathe again.

Intrinsic: Craving an outcome from the writing itself. I want to have this
outcome from this writing NOW or SOON or like next week, I want to write a
masterpiece now, I want to write a great line now, I want to write a great
paragraph now. And we become disappointed because we inevitably crave more
than we acquire.

>> I absolutely believe this. I want to write masterpieces / mistress-
pieces, period. Anything else, I lose energy. I might live in disappoint-
ment but the craving drives me.

Agitation (restlessness, worry): This is boring. Im bored. Gyawd, Ive got
to write ALL THESE words??!

>> And agitation, yes, writing in a state of fury or despair or the sense
of total destruction, yes.

Sloth, Laziness: General lassitude leading to inaction and inanition.
Nothing written, nothing discovered, nothing made.

>> This is the only one I agree on; if you don't have the energy, you're
silent, which is not necessarily a bad thing and might lead to something
terrific day after tomorrow.

For me there are NO enemies to writing except for internal or external
States that prohibit taking up the pen or keyboard.

i think i agree with you on all yr points, alan

in fact, i don't disagree, really, with anything you say below. i'm with
you in all these points. this was written for some undergraduates who
are not yet used to writing and whose writing concerns are sometimes on
a different order than yours perhaps most often are. i agree that these
things can act as goads -- and if anything, for me, they are sometimes
the ways my heart and mind find their way again to flourishing. for some
folks though, i think they can become complete impediments. otherwise,
yes, doubt of a certain kind is essential; *not wanting* is essential;
wanting is essential; rhythmical inaction and inanition are essential.
these all, so long as we continue to make the effort, enrich us if we
refuse to allow them to destroy us. thx for yr response, alan, and may i
say how happy i am to be here with you. love, g

thanks, diane, for yr kind response. - gabriel

Yes, exactly. And even being prevented from writing may turn out to have been a good thing, later.

I think that if I didn't doubt, I'd write even more crap than I do already.
Maybe the diamonds that I flatter myself are in there now would still be
around, but they'd be a lot harder to find.  It's really that way with
everything that seems to hamper writing; even sloth-- or in my case,
exhaustion-- keeps me away from writing the unnecessary.  The enemy of my
writing is my friend.  (Does that mean writing is my enemy?)

Alan,

Yours is a poetics of panics, as I think many of your most vibrant pieces
are around panic.

What is that sword's edge where panic leads to energy and not paralysis?

The same way, what is the distinction between sloth and negative capability?
I, on my part, these days I am full of negative capability. If it goes on
another day, it'll be sloth.

In those five enemies, isn't Gabe not referring to the "internal State"?

Ciao,

Murat

I love the fact that you did a thesis on Muriel Rukeyser.  I've had her Collected Poems in my home for over ten years without reading it.  I lacked a "key" to her poetry which I found,a week or so ago, in a marvelous poem called "The Key".  Now I feel like a great fan of her work and am finally reading her book, or at least two thirds of it, from "The Key" onwards.  I agree with you (or Cid Corman) that it is uneven.  But when it works, it is among the best the twentieth century produced.  Regards, Tom Savage

i'm back and forth with Ashberry. sometimes i find his stuff to be little more than day dream dribble, and too Godddamn cute for their own good.  but the long poems: Flow Chart, Self Portrait, 3 poems, keep me coming back. If Ash isn't major, he's awfully innovative.

Actually, if Harold Bloom were reading this, he would probably point out that unfortunately, most of us are just one of him. (Ashbery, that is.)

Joe Brainard's Pyjamas is seeking submissions of poetry for the next month (until October 1st) to post to my blog. Prefer shorter poems (say 60 line max) and request submissions in batches of 3 at a time only. Form and subject matter wide open. If you have a book to promote, give me the relevant info and I'll post alongside if I post your work. Payment is self-gratification: feel free to gratify yourself as desired. I am changing my name for the duration of this solicitation to Orgazmatron Prime, so feel free to address the poetry editor as such. After October first, I will revert to my given birthname. Or you can just put "poetry submission" in the subject line (risk being deleted unread if you don't). Email is Bewitjanus@aol.com. Merci and have a great troika weekend!

Well, you are right.
But the idea of English as the national language of America
is funny.
Most of America speaks Spanish, Portuguese, French, Dutch, etc.

CALL FOR PAPERS
for "Contemporary Poet's Theater:  L-A-N-G-U-A-G-E and Beyond":
A Proposed Panel for the 20th Century Literature Conference in Louisville
(February 2008)

        In recent contemporary poetics, the term "poet's theater" has
become  linked with the "Language" group of writers and often directors of
poetry-plays produced as low-budget staged
performances in the late 1970's and '80's.  Today,  new  productions of
classic "Language"-oriented poet's theater abound, by writers  including
Leslie Scalapino, Carla Harryman, Charles Bernstein, among  others.  Yet
there are also many contemporary playwrights in other settings  doing work
that is not only aesthetically related to  "Language"-oriented theater, but
which might be productively  critiqued in terms articulated by Language
writers and others writing on avant-garde performance art.  These "other"
are theater writers are those who are engaging in "poet's theater," by
virtue of treating a written text as an act of performance -- the drama
thus emerging not from some external "signified," but from within the
"signifier," the poetic language, itself.
         This panel is an attempt to ground a definition of the term
"poet's  theater" in a potentially expanding notion of the contemporary
working scene of today's American  theater, both through underfinanced smal=
l
public venues (like cafes or coffee houses or art-spaces) or in venues  lik=
e
Off-Broadway.  And it is an attempt to look at what the embodied stage and
poetic experiment have to offer one another.      It is a given that
contemporary- American poet's theater (which this panel-coordinator views a=
s
a  major but often overlooked postmodern genre that
perhaps defies many attempts to identify and categorize it) stands well
outside  the established American "realist" theater tradition of, say,
O'Neill, Miller, or Tennessee Williams.  The poet's theater we speak of is
more likely to be  influenced, instead, by early 20th-century European
experimentalists of the stage, like Brecht, Beckett, and Artaud.  American
modernists, of course =96 like Stein, Pound, and Djuna Barnes =96  wrote po=
etry
plays that defied the conventions of narrative drama.  However, the focus o=
f
this  panel will examines their more contemporary inheritors.   We will
consider for the proposed panel any papers about works and theater
practitioners who have emerged during or since the early stages of Language
writing (for example, John Ashbery, Bernstein,  Ntozake Shange, Harryman,
Scalapino, Amiri Baraka, Cherie Moraga, Tracie Morris, as well as "non-poet=
"
playwrights like Adrienne
Kennedy, Anna Deavere Smith, or Suzan-Lori Parks -- the latter of whose
works are based in
a non-linear use of lyrical language and the performativity of individual
and community speech acts.)
         Please send a 250-300-word abstract and title describing your
proposed topic
no later than SEPTEMBER 12, by e-mail only, to Laura Hinton, Professor of
English, The
City College of New York (laurahinton12@gmail.com).  Accompany this abstrac=
t
with the following cover-sheet information needed per conference
requirements:
   * Name
   * Address (preferably home)
    * E-mail address
    * Telephone number
    * Academic affiliation (if applicable)
    * Personal biographical note, (100-150 words)

i always thought ashbery was for superbrains i.e. not me; then i had a
student, kind of a stoner, who never said anything but in the journal i
had them keep for class would profess his love for john ashbery and his
desire to drop out of society, sit around and read ashbery.  he had also
fallen in love w/ a girl by the end of class, and so it became: drop out
of school, sit around being in love and reading john ashbery.  he didn't
mention any spliff, but i kinda inferred that.  i never thought of
ashbery as seriously countercultural or appealing to youth until then.

Texas State University | English Department | 601 University Drive | San
Marcos, Texas | 78666

*Front Porch * (http://www.frontporchjournal.com), the online literary
journal of Texas State University's MFA program, seeks submissions for its
FALL and WINTER 2007 issues.

Since our debut in November 2006, we have published the work of several
well-known writers such as Charles D'Ambrosio, Roddy Doyle, Heather McHugh,
Eleanor Wilner, C.D. Wright, and Charles Wright. In addition, we are able to
draw from the extensive audiovisual archive at the Katherine Anne Porter
House to provide media content alongside poetry, fiction, nonfiction, book
reviews, and interviews. Recently, we've featured video of Carole Maso and
Yiyun Li.

If you are interested, please visit our site and follow the online
submission process. Obviously, I would extend the same advice to
contributors that all editors do -- read the work that's already been
published to get a sense of what we're looking for. By the same token, don't
assume that your work is too experimental or adventurous for us; as the new
poetry ed, I'm looking for new, original work that pushes the envelope, and
I promise to give everything a fair read.

MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII; format=flowed

Two things this week --

"the youth of today": some responses and engagement with Mark Wallace and
K. Lorraine Graham about what the kids are up to:

http://rhubarbissusan.blogspot.com/2007/08/youth-of-today.html

More updates to the "end of wikipedia as we know it" post, which has
occasioned a small avalanche of denials and obfuscations from Jimbo Wales,
wikipedia administrators and trustees of the foundation board.

This is a serious matter even if you're not a wikipedia dork. If you've
ever read or edited a wikipedia page it *will* affect you directly. As far
as I can tell, only Chris Lott and I have blogged this; I encourage you to
take a look and spread the word.

Thanks for tuning in,

Just a minor point, not panic, perhaps a feeling that the end of the world
as at nigh, that we're on the brink of further mass extinctions - but not
panic, there's far too much control in what I do, it might not show, but
as in Poe there's that composition.

They're not around panic at least for me, they're around a kind of fulcrum
related to foundation of language, sexuality, world, real, more or less
ontology.

There's no paralysis, there never has been, since there's no hysteria, no
wandering, but learning how to see.

It's a minor point, but for me critical, just as not reading my work
autobiographically is equally critical, although there are elements of
autobio present as there are in everything, including Bohm for example
(whose hidden variables might well relate to seams of coal not far from
where he and I were born).
