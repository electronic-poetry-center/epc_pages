Behind the State Capitol came out at around the same time and is about the same size. The two are close to a collected up to that date.

Seth Stewart is currently in the process of compiling a Collected Wieners,
I believe. Apparently the issues that existed in terms of the estate
(which, of course, controlled unpublished material and the rights to the
published work) have been resolved and the project is moving ahead at a
good clip.

Here's hoping!

No prejudice, for sure. UC has drastically cut its poetry list--after the next round of books, now in process, that will be more apparent. It's a matter of severe money shortage. But, tho doing any collected is an enormous amount of editing work, John and Steve Jonas present special problems. Behind the State Capitol was largely gathered from the floor of John's Joy Street apartment by Charley Shively. That said, I'd be first in line for both volumes.

ons, Continuities, Evolutions=0Ahttp://andnowfestival.com/program.html=0A=
=0A&NOW is a festival of fiction, poetry, and staged play readings; literar=
y rituals, performance pieces (digital, sound, and otherwise), electronic a=
nd multimedia projects; and intergenre literary work of all kinds, includin=
g criti-fictional presentations and creatively critical papers. We particul=
arly encourage pieces that promote linguistic and genre transgressions, alo=
ng with literary artworks that promote interdisciplinary explorations and c=
onversations with past, present, or future literary concerns and movements.=
=0A=0A&Now's 2012 theme "Exchanges and cross-fertilizations" addresses the =
idea of innovative literary art in terms of importation from and thriving o=
n different genres, forms, fields and media. When today's art clearly expos=
es many a traditional literary and more generally artistic category and not=
ion as obsolete, how is art to be described, criticized and reviewed? Shoul=
d categories be done away with altogether and new modes of speaking about w=
orks, representing and promoting them be invented, as well as innovative mo=
des of conveying the aesthetic and artistic experience? This special Paris =
edition of the &Now Festival will also tackle the issue of exchanges and in=
fluences across the Atlantic and throughout time, exploring and continuing =
a long-lasting tradition of mutual fertilization and respect. =0A

Alan Sondheim, Azure Carter (Brooklyn) & Helena Espvall (Philadelphia)
Trio:

RECORD RELEASE SHOW! .The animists of Mari El aren.t the last pagans, not
by a long shot. Cauldron is on the job, too, working the hot-stick on Ley
lines from Giant.s Despair to Kingdom Come, with a backpack full of old
tube equipment and spools of magnetic tape. Cauldron spins secret messages
encoded in lace and tosses the achillea millefolium to see where to go
next. Cauldron wants to remind you that all you see is not all there is.
The margins of .things. are crawling, if you know how to look: ancient
spirits, saints, faeries, fractal elves, jeweled self-dribbling
basketballs, etc. etc. etc. The trick is to find your way back to an
unmediated life. So take Cauldron.s hand. Ignore the fire-exit signs
warning you that an alarm will sound. It won.t. Push the door open.
stumble into brighter light. the untended back lot behind our shared
reality. where weeds push stark flowers through cracks in the cement. once
you get out there everything is so quiet, all you hear is the
breezes-s-s-s. butterflies and blue lizards flit and skitter amid the
rubble of forgotten thoughts. .How wonderful that you're here!. they say.
.You come so rarely! We're so delighted to see you!.

Cauldron deals out a three of cups: Alan Sondheim, a pioneer of mystical
ear-tweak and sci-fi sonic ritual sound, chamber-improv gypsy cellist
Helena Espvall, and eco-trance singer Azure Carter. thrice to thine and
thrice to mine, and thrice again, to make up nine. Channeling the ghosts
of Opal Whiteley and Lou Harrison, Cauldron conjures the scratch and shush
of the Big Bang out of wood, wind and cat-gut. Whenever you listen to it,
this album is always over too soon, just like life. Fire Museum and
Tequila Sunrise Records deal out a two of pentacles: not to get all
.Yankee Candle. here, but we only made 250 of these, so grab one before
they melt away like chemtrails in the sunset sky." - Fred Astarte, Tequila
Sunrise Records

Dan Joseph (Brooklyn):

Dan Joseph is a free-lance composer based in New York City. He began his
career as a drummer in the vibrant punk scene of his native Washington,

Jesse Kudler (Philadelphia) & Barry Weisblat (Brooklyn) Duo:

Jesse Kudler, born 1979, creates concrete music on the computer, composes
low-tech multi-channel sound works, and improvises on cheap consumer
devices: a no-name electric guitar, hand-held cassette recorders, radios
and transmitters, various small junk, and pedals/electronics. In his
various travels, Kudler has performed with Matt Bauder, Kyle Bruckmann,
Chris Cogburn, James Coleman, Tim Feeney, Brent Gutzeit, Bonnie Jones,
Jason Kahn, Mazen Kerbaj, Toshimaru Nakamura, Pauline Oliveros, Bhob
Rainey, Vic Rawlings, Christine Sehnaoui, Mike Shiflet, Jason Soliday,
Howard Stelzer, Christian Weber, Matt Weston, Jack Wright, Jason Zeh, and
many others. Current and "recent" projects include: sound installation; a

duo with Tim Albro; duos with Chris Cogburn, Christian Weber, and Chandan
Narayan; Benito Cereno (with Dustin Hurt, Chandan Narayan, Tim Albro, and
Ian Fraser); Tweeter, a treble-intensive noise trio with Alex Nagle and
Eli Litwin; and various ad hoc groupings. Kudler is the co-founder and
co-Director (with Ian Fraser) of the Philadelphia Sound Forum.

Barry Weisblat was born in 1975 in Brooklyn. He is a sound artist and
electronic instrument builder who extensively experiments with
electro-magnetic devices, solar technology, homemade and modified circuits
for application in sound generation/manipulation, audio engineering and
photography. Weisblat has collaborated with Margarida Garcia, Tower
Recordings, Mattin, Tim Barnes and Tetuzi Akiyama, and has built
instruments for Peter Kowald, Toshio Kajiwara, Manuel Mota and Matt
Valentine. He has sound engineered for Erstwhile Records, Dean Roberts and
Jon Gibson. - bios

Subject:      Larry Fagin's Complete Fragments
Mime-version: 1.0
Content-type: text/plain; charset="ISO-8859-1"
Content-transfer-encoding: quoted-printable

Cuneiform Press is pleased to announce the publication of
=20
COMPLETE FRAGMENTS
 by Larry Fagin
=20
Complete Fragments is Larry Fagin=B9s first trade edition book of poems since
I'll Be Seeing You (Full Court Press, 1978). Cover drawing by Glen Baxter.
=20
Larry Fagin's new work, like fine mosaic, is an essay, a threshold, and
something like figures in a landscape blasted apart. Unlike Rimbaud=B9s lush
prose poems which so many try to imitate, these engage in an aesthetic of
deflation. They are the art of sinking while remaining solid. They are
wittier than most of the prose poetry we know, sober and also hilarious.
Comedy is never mere. Each of the poems here adds up to something grander
and with more genuine pathos than one might have thought possible. As Fagin
says vatically: =B3Not to know me is not to not love me.=B2 He surrounds you, a
strange sensation.=20
=8BCharles North=20
=20
If poetry is, as Paul Val=E9ry proposed, a holiday of the mind, Larry Fagin i=
s
the intellectual=B9s Henny Youngman. His witty, staccato concatenations of
one-liners cum prose poems are highly disorienting yet exhilarating,
combining low and high comedy (and erudite cultural reference) in what
amounts to a high-wire act on each page. Nor, as in the best comedy, are
important human concerns ever far removed. I don=B9t know any other poet who
manages parataxis with such =E9lan, or who casts so many lines that reeling
them in is a virtual impossibility=8B until the poems accomplish just that.
=8BCharles North=20
=20
What doesn=B9t Larry Fagin remember. Where is he, as the writing appears to
generate itself inevitably, colliding from the prior phrase=8Ban alloy of
semi-secret knowledge, huge distance, and mandarin taste. So he=B9s standing
back, for the long view, but also up to his eyeballs in the material nougat=

Subject: Larry Fagin's Complete Fragments

Cuneiform Press is pleased to announce the publication of
=20
COMPLETE FRAGMENTS
 by Larry Fagin
=20
Complete Fragments is Larry Fagin=B9s first trade edition book of poems since
I'll Be Seeing You (Full Court Press, 1978). Cover drawing by Glen Baxter.
=20
Larry Fagin's new work, like fine mosaic, is an essay, a threshold, and
something like figures in a landscape blasted apart. Unlike Rimbaud=B9s lush
prose poems which so many try to imitate, these engage in an aesthetic of
deflation. They are the art of sinking while remaining solid. They are
wittier than most of the prose poetry we know, sober and also hilarious.
Comedy is never mere. Each of the poems here adds up to something grander
and with more genuine pathos than one might have thought possible. As Fagin
says vatically: =B3Not to know me is not to not love me.=B2 He surrounds you, a
strange sensation.=20
=8BCharles North=20
=20
If poetry is, as Paul Val=E9ry proposed, a holiday of the mind, Larry Fagin i=
s
the intellectual=B9s Henny Youngman. His witty, staccato concatenations of
one-liners cum prose poems are highly disorienting yet exhilarating,
combining low and high comedy (and erudite cultural reference) in what
amounts to a high-wire act on each page. Nor, as in the best comedy, are
important human concerns ever far removed. I don=B9t know any other poet who
manages parataxis with such =E9lan, or who casts so many lines that reeling
them in is a virtual impossibility=8B until the poems accomplish just that.
=8BCharles North=20
=20
What doesn=B9t Larry Fagin remember. Where is he, as the writing appears to
generate itself inevitably, colliding from the prior phrase=8Ban alloy of
semi-secret knowledge, huge distance, and mandarin taste. So he=B9s standing
back, for the long view, but also up to his eyeballs in the material nougat=
,
being so thoroughly informed. Apposites don=B9t just naturally gel in such
recognizable shapes that you can=B9t see it coming. And then you do, breathin=

Hi,

In a little under two months, to mark our 21st anniversary, we'll be =20
putting on our sixth annual Welcome to Boog City poetry and music =20
festival, featuring poets, musicians, political speakers, public radio =20=

personalities, and playwrights performing at two venues, in two =20
boroughs, over four days, from Thurs. Aug. 2-Sun. Aug. 5. Among the =20
over 50 performers taking part are poets Jillian Brall, Richard =20
Deming, Amanda Deutch, Ted Dodson, Claire Donato, Thom Donovan, Sam =20
Donsky, Rita Doyle, Micah Freeman, Ed Friedman, Drew Gardner, Jamie =20
Gaughran-Perez, David Henderson, Barbara Henning, Laura Henriksen, =20
Jeff T. Johnson, Jamey Jones, Patricia Spears Jones, Rebecca Keith, =20
Nancy Kuhl, Krystal Languell, Dorothea Lasky, Bridget Madden, Dawn =20

Michelle Tarransky, Genya Turovskaya, Ken Walker, Tyrone Williams, and =20=

Angela Veronica Wong.

Ten days before the event, we'll be putting out the festival issue of =20=

Boog City. This issue will feature pieces on some of the performers =20
and a full schedule, illustrated with images of each of the =20
performers. Here's what lst year's looks like:

http://boogcity.com/boogpdfs/bc69.pdf

Advertising in the festival issue of Boog City means you will reach =20
more than 3,000 readers, poetry lovers, and small press aficionados =20
throughout the East Village, other targeted areas of lower Manhattan; =20=

Williamsburg and Greenpoint, Brooklyn; as well as bonus distribution =20
at Boog City events. That's an increase of 33.3% over our regular =20
issues for no additional cost. And, since this issue is also a program =20=

for the festival, readers will give it a closer read as they check to =20=

see who's up later on that day and throughout the festival.

Boog City continues to offer our special Small Press Ad Rates. That =20
means when you advertise with us you will save 50% off of our regular =20=

display ad rates.

      * Full Page        $250
      * Half-Page       $130

      * Eighth-Page     $40

Here is a link to our full rate card:

http://boogcity.com/adrates.pdf

As I mentioned in previous emails, Boog City focuses on getting the =20
word out about lesser-known artists, be they poets, prose writers, =20
musicians, painters, photographers, or cartoonists. Each month we =20
publish poetry from the likes of Anselm Berrigan, Renee Gladman, Lisa =20=

Jarnot, Eileen Myles, Kristin Prevallet, and recent Pulitzer Prize =20
winnr Tracy K. Smith, alongside our Urban Folk music section, small =20
press book reviews, political commentary, art, comics, and photographs.

We look forward to working with you to bring your message to the local =20=

arts community to increase awareness and sales of your publications in =20=

the New York area.

as ever,
David

MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1

Dear Friends,

We at Delete Press are thrilled to offer up our most recent chapbook, a
poem, KEVORKIAN, by Zach Keebaugh.  We feel privileged and honored to be
publishing it.  It doesn't disappoint!

Zachary Keebaugh holds an MA in Philosophy of Aesthetics from SUNY
Buffalo.  Along with producing theoretical work on Animals, Ghosts,
"Strange Intelligence" and the Uncanny, he has an exclusive and cult
virtual-presence as an interpretive dancer and occasionally performs
"Comedy."  A native of Georgia, Zach currently resides in Wisconsin where
he is working on an epistemological polemic entitled "Against
Eclecticism."

KEVORKIAN was printed on Somerset paper from photopolymer plates using a
Vandercook 4 letterpress and handbound as an accordion structure in 28
panels.  The original cover and title page art was provided by Meg
Fransee.  Alex Kvares donated the image which appears within the poem from
his drawing "mondegreen 22."  KEVORKIAN is 77 in (w) x 7 in (h) with a
printing of 75.  KEVORKIAN is $12, which includes shipping.

Samples from the book can be found on the Delete Press website, where you
can also pick up a copy:

All best,
DP

Buffalo.  Along with producing theoretical work on Animals, Ghosts,
"Strange Intelligence" and the Uncanny, he has an exclusive and cult
virtual-presence as an interpretive dancer and occasionally performs
"Comedy."  A native of Georgia, Zach currently resides in Wisconsin where
he is working on an epistemological polemic entitled "Against
Eclecticism."

KEVORKIAN was printed on Somerset paper from photopolymer plates using a
Vandercook 4 letterpress and handbound as an accordion structure in 28
panels.  The original cover and title page art was provided by Meg
Fransee.  Alex Kvares donated the image which appears within the poem from
his drawing "mondegreen 22."  KEVORKIAN is 77 in (w) x 7 in (h) with a
printing of 75.  KEVORKIAN is $12, which includes shipping.

The new ebook from Argotist Ebooks is =E2=80=9CAt Times Your Lines=E2=80=9D=
 by Susan Lewis
=20
Description:
=20
The prose poems in =E2=80=9CAt Times Your Lines=E2=80=9D muster compression=
 and elision, irony and parable in the pursuit of the necessary impossible;=
 tracing life and fault-lines between the lived and the created, the recogn=
izable and the strange. =E2=80=9CThese poems are terse yet opaque, jokey ye=
t unapologetically consequential... off-beat, perfectly tuned, and compulsi=
vely readable.=E2=80=9D (Wayne Thomas, editor of The Tusculum Review).=20

My apologies. An update on this.

My publisher now tells me there are issues with the website re ordering, =
so in their words, if you wish to order one of the books 'send orders to =
sales[at]vagabondpress.net for now, rather than use the site'.

MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1

Hello all -

The latest from quarter after is Of language|s| the rain speaks by Felino
A. Soriano
http://quarterafter.org/2012/06/14/of-languages-the-rain-speaks-felinoa-a-soriano/

Of language|s| the rain speaks is a documentation of observed content,
specific to the manifestation of interpreted devices composed in the
direct/indirect ambulation of reactive notions to sensorial involvement.
Through physical and allegorical windows (too, of corporeal inferring sans
resource of ocular understanding) observation is the emotional involvement
to adaptation of specialized communication with rain and the multiple
bodies its spectrum of spatial engagement inhabits.

Subject:      COMPLETE FRAGMENTS by Larry Fagin
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset = "utf-8"
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Cuneiform Press is pleased to announce the publication of

COMPLETE FRAGMENTS

by Larry Fagin

Complete Fragments is Larry Faginâ€™s first trade edition book of poems
since I'll Be Seeing You (Full Court Press, 1978). Cover drawing by Glen
Baxter.

Larry Fagin's new work, like fine mosaic, is an essay, a threshold, and
something like figures in a landscape blasted apart. Unlike Rimbaudâ€™s lush
prose poems which so many try to imitate, these engage in an aesthetic of
deflation. They are the art of sinking while remaining solid. They are wittier
than most of the prose poetry we know, sober and also hilarious. Comedy is
never mere. Each of the poems here adds up to something grander and with more
genuine pathos than one might have thought possible. As Fagin says vatically:
â€œNot to know me is not to not love me.â€ He surrounds you, a strange sensation.

â€”David Shapiro

If poetry is, as Paul ValÃ©ry proposed, a holiday of the mind, Larry Fagin is
the intellectualâ€™s Henny Youngman. His witty, staccato concatenations of
one-liners cum prose poems are highly disorienting yet exhilarating, combining
low and high comedy (and erudite cultural reference) in what amounts to a
high-wire act on each page. Nor, as in the best comedy, are important human
concerns ever far removed. I donâ€™t know any other poet who manages parataxis
with such Ã©lan, or who casts so many lines that reeling them in is a virtual
impossibilityâ€” until the poems accomplish just that.

â€”Charles North

What doesnâ€™t Larry Fagin remember. Where is he, as the writing appears to
generate itself inevitably, colliding from the prior phraseâ€”an alloy of
semi-secret knowledge, huge distance, and mandarin taste. So heâ€™s standing
back, for the long view, but also up to his eyeballs in the material nougat,
being so thoroughly informed. Apposites donâ€™t just naturally gel in such
recognizable shapes that you canâ€™t see it coming. And then you do, breathing
again.

â€”Alan Bernheimer

While it is to be hoped that someone is busying themselves gathering the best
of Larry Faginâ€™s earlier uncollected poemsâ€”the â€œNarrative Techniquesâ€ series
(and related pieces), the â€œEleven Poemsâ€ for Philip Gustonâ€”we have Cuneiform
Press to thank for publishing this long-in-the-works book of Faginâ€™s wonderful
prose poems. This latter form has been Faginâ€™s primary focus as a poet for much
of the last twenty years (it is, astonishingly, almost thirty years since his
last collection, the seventeen-page Nuclear Neighborhood), and it is a joy to
have the fruits of his researches in this area collected between two covers at
last. While Fagin well understands that 1+1=3, the greater mystery of his prose
poems is that they are as much allover as additive works, their every sentence
joined to its neighborsâ€”and not only thoseâ€”by sensible glue, which, here, is
duplicitous in the very best sense: alive as in thickly a-hum. Some of the
poems are antic, yes, but every â€œka-powâ€ is balancedâ€”maintained in exquisite
suspension, in factâ€”by a corresponding â€œpa-dow,â€ such that the overall
arrangement of poemsâ€”which is perfect, as you might expectâ€”constitutes a poem
in itself. Other pieces contain elements that may, upon first glance, strike
the reader as arch (there is such a thing as a â€œLarryismâ€), but this material,
more often than not, is inducted into the poem via an utter delicacy of
ostention: selection as caress, show and tell reimagined as intimate act.
These Fragments constitute impressions taken on a writing pad that might best
be imagined as a stack of index cards shot in natural light on black-and-white
â€™Scope; their sum is entirely equal toâ€”but at no point a copy ofâ€”the world.

â€”Miles Champion

Larry Fagin doesn't want to be famous. At times he's published his poems
anonymously and at times insisted that his students & colleagues do likewise.
The students insist that he is the best teacher ever or at least since X, Y or
Z, all long dead (Z for centuries). The poems themselves are small, modest as
Fagin is modest, yet built to last for generations. What if Cavafy were a
member of the New York School? Or if Catullus had been a part of the Spicer
Circle? They're powerful & opaque like the Barnett Newman sculpture in 2001,
tho the design preference is that each one should be no bigger than a breadbox.
I think of them as the blood diamonds of the Lower East Side. That is so not
Brooklyn, you say. Exactly.

â€”Ron Silliman

Larry Fagin is the author of 14 books of poetry. He is the co-publisher of
Adventures in Poetry books, and edits Sal Mimeo, a little magazine. He lives in
New York City, where he teaches privately.

"The Acadamisation of Avant-Garde Poetry" New Feature now online at The Arg=
otist Online:=20
http://www.argotistonline.co.uk/The%20Acadamisation%20of%20Avant-Garde%20Po=
etry.htm
=20
Details:
Jake Berry=E2=80=99s essay, "Poetry Wide Open: The Otherstream (Fragments I=
n Motion" deals with the issue of certain types of avant-garde poetry (and,=
 indeed, some mainstream poetry) as not yet having found favour within the =
Academy, or with poetry publishers of academically =E2=80=9Csanctioned=E2=
=80=9D avant-garde poetry. The damaging aspects of this exclusion, and the =
concept of an =E2=80=9Capproved=E2=80=9D versus an =E2=80=9Cunapproved=E2=
=80=9D avant-garde poetry, are also examined in the essay. And these things=
 could well be described as =E2=80=9Cthe acadamisation of avant-garde poetr=
y=E2=80=9D.=20
One could say that the term "avant-garde" has now, essentially, been approp=
riated by the Academy, and, as such, has become associated with the sort of=
 poetic writing practices that could be fairly said to represent =E2=80=9Ce=
stablishment=E2=80=9D poetry, to the extent that the historical resonances =
of the term =E2=80=9Cavant-garde=E2=80=9D have become meaningless.=20
In contrast, Bob Grumman=E2=80=99s term, =E2=80=9Cotherstream=E2=80=9D, whi=
ch Berry uses in his essay to describe poetry that is marginalised by the A=
cademy, can be seen as a more apt replacement for the term =E2=80=9Cavant-g=
arde=E2=80=9D, which has now become obsolete as an appropriate description =
for poetry that isn=E2=80=99t anecdotal, descriptive or prose-like.=20
This Argotist Online feature presents Berry=E2=80=99s essay, the responses =
to it from poets and academics it was first shown to, and an interview with=
 Berry where he addresses some of the criticisms voiced in these responses.=
=20
Many poets and academics (including those most famously associated with Lan=
guage Poetry) were approached for their responses but declined. Other poets=
 and academics that had initially agreed to respond ultimately declined. I =
mention this not as criticism but merely to explain the absence of people w=
ho one would normally expect to have responded and taken part in such a dis=
cussion.=20

Content-Type: text/plain; charset="ISO-8859-1"

City Lights Publishers is pleased to announce the release of=20

ADVICE FOR LOVERS=20
by Julian Talamantez Brolaski=20
City Lights Spotlight Poetry Series No. 7=20

If Philip Sidney had been a third-gender queer poet, he might have writte=
n
the highly erotic ADVICE FOR LOVERS...=20

The latest publication in the City Lights Spotlight Poetry Series, Julian=

Brolaski's ADVICE FOR LOVERS is a highly wrought collection inspired by
Ovid's instructional Ars Amatoria, with overtones of Renaissance sonnet
cycles. Intricate in form but modern and tawdry in diction, Advice for
Lovers walks a fine line between the anything-goes orthography of the
Elizabethans and the shifting etymologies of Finnegans Wake. With the
inclusion of trans- and third-gender pronouns, the work also argues for a=

proliferation of pronouns beyond a gendered dichotomy. Yet in the midst o=
f
its classical splendor we encounter more contemporary figures like Johnny=

Cash, Ricky Martin, and Jack Spicer. Sexy, kinky, disquieting, Advice for=

Lovers blazes an erotic trail into the 21st century.=20

Praise for ADVICE FOR LOVERS:=20
"What if I'm spirited away to live in a torch song?=97Where the landscape=
 is a
lover's discourse? Julian Talamantez Brolaski has me in thrall! In this
enchanting book, Julian jacks up the artifice and jacks up the feeling."

=96Robert Gl=FCck=20

"In this aesthetically audacious collection of poems, Julian Talamantez
Brolaski offers xir 'advice to lovers' in unabashedly voluptuous language=
.
This is dithyrambic verse, variously festive and feisty, impudent and sad=
.
It is beautiful, but never serene. And how could it be? The difference
between 'seeing to' and 'singing to' is not large, and everything in this=

book suggests that to advise is to love. In giving it, Julian exercises x=
ir
native tongue with linguistic amorousness over a wide range of poetic
registers. Guidance has never been this much fun; jouissance has never be=
en
smarter."=20

=96Lyn Hejinian=20

About the City Lights Spotlight series:=20
City Lights Spotlight shines a light on the wealth of innovative American=

poetry being written today. We publish accomplished figures known in the
poetry community as well as young emerging poets, using the cultural
visibility of City Lights to bring their work to a wider audience. In doi=
ng
so, we also seek to draw attention to those small presses publishing such=

authors. About the author: Julian T. Brolaski is the author of gowanus
atropolis (Ugly Duckling Presse, 2011) and an editor at Aufgabe and Litmu=
s
Press. Xe studied with Nathaniel Mackey, Elizabeth Willis, and Robert Has=
s.
Julian lives in Brooklyn, curates vaudeville shows, and plays country mus=
ic
with Juan & the Pines. Xe rejects gendered pronouns and teaches at Th=
e New
School.=20

bass knockoff and said, "I'm starting a rock & roll band and we don't =20=

have a bass player. You wanna learn?" Jay was 13 and never looked =20

=0A=
Jake Berry=92s essay, "Poetry Wide Open: The Otherstream (Fragments In Moti=
on" deals with the issue of certain types of avant-garde poetry (and, indee=
d, some mainstream poetry) as not yet having found favour within the Academ=
y, or with poetry publishers of academically =93sanctioned=94 avant-garde p=
oetry. The damaging aspects of this exclusion, and the concept of an =93app=
roved=94 versus an =93unapproved=94 avant-garde poetry, are also examined i=
n the essay. And these things could well be described as =93the acadamisati=
on of avant-garde poetry=94. =0A=
=0A=
One could say that the term "avant-garde" has now, essentially, been approp=
riated by the Academy, and, as such, has become associated with the sort of=
 poetic writing practices that could be fairly said to represent =93establi=
shment=94 poetry, to the extent that the historical resonances of the term =
=93avant-garde=94 have become meaningless. =0A=
=0A=
In contrast, Bob Grumman=92s term, =93otherstream=94, which Berry uses in h=
is essay to describe poetry that is marginalised by the Academy, can be see=
n as a more apt replacement for the term =93avant-garde=94, which has now b=
ecome obsolete as an appropriate description for poetry that isn=92t anecdo=
tal, descriptive or prose-like. =0A=
=0A=
This Argotist Online feature presents Berry=92s essay, the responses to it =
from poets and academics it was first shown to, and an interview with Berry=
 where he addresses some of the criticisms voiced in these responses. =0A=
=0A=
Many poets and academics (including those most famously associated with Lan=
guage Poetry) were approached for their responses but declined. Other poets=
 and academics that had initially agreed to respond ultimately declined. I =
mention this not as criticism but merely to explain the absence of people w=
ho one would normally expect to have responded and taken part in such a dis=
cussion.=0A=

Hi, Rebecca.  What you have here is the Atlanta Poets Group (APG).  been around
17 years. If you want to get an idea of the stuff we write, check out the blog,
(http://atlantapoetsgroup.blogspot.com/
which doesn't give a representative sampling but will do to start out with.
 There is an anthology (link on blog) a bit more representative.  We meet to
read our poetry Wednesday nights, do performances, though no workshops, did a
meeting at UCSanta Cruz where we performed a paper, etc.
If you write the kind of poetry (loosely speaking) that we do, or would like to
share with us, send us some mss and we'll get back to you.
influences: Stein, L-A-N-G-U-A-G-E poets
We'd be delighted to meet you even if you're not interested in joining the group
erika

Hi all,

I'm relocating to Atlanta to become a Brittian Fellow at Georgia Tech, and
I would love to know about poetry events, readings, poets in town!

Feel free to backchannel if you have the time and are inclined.

I hope you're all having a lovely summer!

The MFA program at LSU is looking to hire a one-year Visiting Assistant
Professor with specializations in poetry writing and African-American
lit. The poet would be responsible for teaching grads and undergrads in a dynamic, thriving CW program. Laura
Mullen and I are the poets on faculty, and there's a real chance this
visiting spot could roll over into a TT job. The deadline is June 28th.

*Maged Zaher, */*The Revolution Happened and You Didn't Call
Me,*///2012, 67 pp., $15, designed by Allison Hanabusa


Maged Zaher is an Egyptian engineer who lives and writes
English-language poetry in Seattle, Washington; his previous chapbook
with Tinfish Press was co-authored with Pam Brown and titled /farout
library software /(2007)/. /Zaher writes with haiku-like brevity and
precision about his return to Egypt shortly after the 2011 revolution.
Already foreseeing the counter-revolution, his eye gravitates toward the
absurd paradoxes of global capitalism and local revolution, as he moves
from coffee shop to public square and then back. Anthony McCann writes
of the book: "I find it hard to read this book without looking up and
wondering who and what and where I am. It returns me again and again to
wondering what a person is, what speaking is, and what we mean by 'the
world'. Deterritorialization is one of its main concerns and main
activities, something that I think can be said about Zaher's work in
general, whether he is undermining the reality effects of nation states
and their borders, or of corporate spectral omnipresence, or unpeeling
his own personal multiply-deterritorialized lyric self. It is vital,
lucid, and uncompromising work that leaves this reader feeling more
alive and open to 'our moment,' and less secure than ever about what
that might mean. Despite its often slashing irony, I find it a very
tender book as well. The gentleness and the slightness of the form
cradles a reader (this one anyway) preventing panic and interpretative
foreclosure.

11, 2011 at 9.0 magnitude earthquake followed by a giant tsunami devastate=
d parts of Japan's Tohoku and Kanto regions. Quake Notes is a journal of p=
oet Scott Watson's experience in Sendai. Originally appearing as emails to=
 friends/relatives around the world, these notes helped to sooth and focus=
 Watson while surviving with no electricity and water, scarce food and sup=
plies, and frequent after shocks. He writes: "We sleep, but it is a very l=
ight sleep and we are startled throughout by more rumbling and shaking. We=
 have socks on too and are ready to run out of our house should the shakin=
g get too violent. How does one tell? How does one know when to ride it ou=
t or when to get out?" And then there is the looming situation in Fukushim=
a, along with Watson's wife's radiation treatments. "I'm planning our esca=
pe. The roads North are clear. Winter snows are melting. Morie's radiation=
 sessions: ten days more. Will Fukushima's nukes hold off until then, or w=
ill the danger zone expand?" Not just a survival diary, Quake Notes is a c=
ultural critique and a poetic meditation that culminates into a political =
song against the worst nuclear disaster since Chernobyl.=0A=0AFrom the for=
word by John Martone:=0A=0A"Watson's Quake Notes would translate well into=
 Japanese. The diary, from Sei Shonagon's Pillow Book, through Basho and I=
ssa to Kenzaburo Oe's Hiroshima Notes, has been a prized Japanese art form=
, and readers familiar with those writers will see how clearly Watson's wo=
rk stands in their light. Watson is never explicit about this heritage; th=
ere is nothing self-consciously literary about this little book, but like =
its antecedents, Quake Notes is all poetry, the language of survival, life=

Here's a different version of my talk about Joe Keenan's digital poem
MOMENT: http://vispo.com/keenan/2

This is the next version.

One thing I didn't mention is that the DNA motif in the poem is mainly a
matter of reference to code. Joe was involved with Ted Warnell and the other
'code poets'. The DNA motif in MOMENT refers to code (DNA is code) but,
also, the visual poetry in MOMENT is often quite sinusoidal, helixical,
spiral.

I've been looking at the source code today. Joe is a super duper JavaScript
programmer.

Electronic Literature Organization Conference

Morgantown, WV
http://www.flickr.com/photos/asondheim/sets/72157630231324990/
Some images - ranging from interesting to mundane. The last group
is best looked at small. The panoramas work best at original size.
This isn't a recording of anything except my carrying cameras;
a few people; hiking around Cooper's Rock; walking around Morgan-
town; the 123 club where I've played a few times; some buildings
of interest including a few the conference was held in; a true
bug (hemiptera) I need to identify; young rattlesnake; etc. The
talks were great - our panels were terrific, and I met some good
people and saw some friends, Tim and Helen and Frances and Rachel
and Frank, wonderful!

My book A Common Strangeness: Contemporary Poetry, Cross-Cultural Encounter=
, Comparative Literature has just been released from Fordham University Pre=
ss.=20

"A Common Strangeness is unique among studies of contemporary poetics in be=
ing genuinely global in its perspective and its reach. At home in Russian a=
nd Chinese as well as American poetry and that of his native New Zealand, J=
acob Edmond pinpoints the crucial relationships that exist between what are=
 seemingly disparate poetic cultures. The Chinese poet Yang Lian, who lived=
 in exile in Auckland, is read under the sign of Benjamin and Baudelaire. T=
he American Language poet Lyn Hejinian's important dialogue with the Russia=
n avant-gardist Arkadii Dragomoshchenko is studied carefully, and Bei Dao, =
Dmitri Prigov, and Charles Bernstein are treated as representative figures =
of cross-cultural thinking in the age of globalism.  Edmond's is a provocat=
ive, exciting, and genuinely original study of the new poetics; we will all=
 be learning from it!"
--Marjorie Perloff

"This bold triangulation of six Chinese, Russian, and American poets advanc=
es lively current debates about global literature by exploring encounters t=
hat challenge the old binarisms and chart possibilities of literary singula=
rities for a future poetics.  Edmond's shrewd account of literary crossings=
 in post-Cold War history helps us imagine how we can experience the challe=
nge of new literary configurations."
--Jonathan Culler

think of a pen with four nibs attached by loose springs to the pen. the nibs
don't stream ink but, instead, they stream lettristic animations. animations
from nio and an animation of the word 'time'.

you can fire up the interactive pen itself at

which of course you should for the sake of your immortal soul.

We read some of the poets in your breakthrough anthology in my contemporary
Am poetry course this spring, and we found it deeply affecting & we learned
a great deal about the non-normative body & the perceptions of these fine
poets. It's an essential book now.

2013 Furniture Press Poetry Prize for a Full-Length Collection of Poetry
and its Derivatives

Deadline: Postmark by September 1, 2012

Judge: Thomas Devaney

Thomas Devaney is the author of two poetry collections, A Series of Small
Boxes (Fish Drum) and The American Pragmatist Fell in Love (Banshee Press),
and a nonfiction book, Letters to Ernesto Neto (Germ Folios). Recent poems
have been published in The Brooklyn Rail, Zoland Poetry, The Awl, and BOMB
Magazine. His essays on art have been published by Tibor de Nagy Gallery,
the Institute of Contemporary Art, and the artblog. His poetry reviews have
been featured in The Philadelphia Inquirer, Jacket, Double Change, and The
Poetry Project Newsletter. He teaches at Haverford College and is the
editor of ONandOnScreen (poems + videos). Devaney's book The Picture that
Remains, with photographer Will Brown, is forthcoming from The Print Center
of Philadelphia.

The 2013 Furniture Press Poetry Prize will be awarded to the writer that
best exemplifies the poetics and particularities of Furniture Press Books=
=92
aesthetics. This year, Thomas Devaney graciously accepted the role of judge=
.

The judge will read anonymous, unidentifiable texts. Only the editors of
Furniture Press Books will know the identity of the applicants and his/her
work. Each text will be assigned a number and distributed to the judge.

After the initial round of readings the judge will assign one finalist. The
winner of the Prize will receive a publishing contract in which the winning
manuscript will be published as a full length collection in 2013. The poet
will also receive 20 copies of the book. A subsequent round of readings
will also take place to examine the =93highest tier=94 of applicants. In th=
e
past, some writers who had submitted to the prize but lost were ultimately
considered for publication because of their outstanding work. Submitting to
the contest is also a good way to alert the editors of Furniture Press
Books to greater possibilities for publication.

Please follow these guidelines when submitting an application:

1. Send one unpublished manuscript per entry. Include a cover letter with
your name, address, eMail and short bio. Do not put your name nor the title

individual manuscript.

2. Submit a $10 fee per manuscript at
furniturepressbooks.com/furniture-press-poetry-prize. Be sure to also give
us your name and the title of your manuscript in the PayPal notes field.
100% of the cash goes to the pressing and publishing of the winning book.

Jim, if you ask me, I wouldn't use our video with MOMENT to lure people to
digital poetry. Your interface has to do with clicking and seeing what
happens -after a little not much. There are much more interesting examples
requiring a much fuller involvement from the participant.

Ciao,

Murat

the polis.=94

the tough intractability of things (politically and perceptually)=85=94

Il libro dell'oppio (The Book of Opium), namely: the cursed years of a prot=
agonist of the internationalelectronic art and poetry.
Opium and opiates, literary vice par excellence - with a history and person=
alities in the literary scene, from Baudelaire to De Quincey, from Coleridg=
e to Burroughs - find in this work a space unencumberedby victimism or prej=
udice, with a delirious perspective, but free from censorship and taboos.
The author writes in the introductory note:"These are sick (and hellish) pa=
radis artificiels... It is better not to talk about certain diseases of bod=
y and soul, it is better to conceal them, not to upset the sensibility of t=
hose who, in the world, can so surelyseparate good and evil, health and aff=
liction, heaven and hell. In fact, this book remained unpublished, and I wo=
uld say secret, for more than twenty years".
We can define The Book of Opium a work by a young poet: it contains, in fac=
t, lyrics created byDavinio when she was from seventeen to thirty years old=
.
Mauro Ferrari points out in the afterword: "This is poetry which brings tog=
ether in one bundle a life experience which is anyway full and painfullyjoy=
ous - I too suggest an oxymoron- that in Italy this poetry has very few equ=
als, and that it takes refuge neither in a more or less cursed attitude, no=
r in moralism. [...]The poetry of Caterina Davinio drips vitality, corporea=
lity and physicality, which, I think, makes us love life beyond measure, be=
cause it sinks its nails into abjection, into hazard and death - into a cha=
llenge to death, even, without rhetoric, neither in theconstruction of the =
verses nor in the narrative dimension of this lucid and hallucinated diary.=
 [=E2=80=A6] History? Yes, the dates (between 1975 and 1990) tell us about =
the years of terrorism and heroin; but the single texts, however, tell us a=
 story - rather they offer to us fragmented instants, a heap of broken imag=
es,that do not aspire to total organicity - where the pursuit of pleasure (=
momentary and fleeting, as always pleasure is, according to the poet Leopar=
di) merges with the immersion in pain like systole and diastole. The desper=
ate search for drugs is wandering, delay and waiting ("the waiting is every=
thing"); the resurrection to life after a night of drugs, or the lucidity t=
hat shines between two chasms, is then the terrible confirmation of the val=
ue of "that life which is missing", confirmation of how life should be wooe=
d, to feel alive one more day, drunk on the edge of the abyss."
Caterina Davinio, writer, poet and artist, is known for her work in new med=
ia, which has brought her, since 1990, in contact with the international av=
ant-garde circuits, in publications, festivals, exhibitions and meetings of=
 global significance, such as the Venice Biennial, the Biennale of Sydney, =
of Lyon, of Liverpool, of Athens, of Merida,E-Poetry festival (Barcelona an=
d Buffalo, NY), Manifesta and many others, with over three hundred appearan=
ces in meaningful exhibition contexts. This book gives us an opportunity to=
 know a dark periodpreceding 1990, in the Seventies and the Eighties, offer=
ing a gallery of situations, characters and atmosphere from the world of dr=
ug addiction, with moments of hedonism, nihilism, but also playful, or dram=
atic, such as in "Overdose","Anorexia", "Flash (Poem of Heroin)".
"The Book of Opium" presents one hundred and fourteen selected poems from t=
he collection "Fatti deprecabili"(Deplorable Facts), almost entirely unpubl=
ished, whichcontains texts written from Davinio's early adolescence. Davini=
o began writing poetry at the age of fourteen years, composing, from 1971 u=
ntil 1997, over four hundred poems and performance texts; some of them were=
 included in anthologies, readings and theater performances in the late Eig=
hties and Nineties. The poems included in this book, never printed or prese=
nted before, are a first attempt toorganize and arrange part of those manus=
cripts for publication.
The themes of drugs and marginality are not new in Davinio's literary produ=
ction, already present in her novel Color Color, in various poems, and in h=
er book SerialPhenomenologies (2010).
The Book of Opium, with its language directed, up from its origins, to expe=
rimentation, with a vocation for breaking the syntactical structures, the v=
erses, and, sometime, the words, with the unpredictability of some unexpect=
ed passages and variations, provides, in a not merelyneo-realistic way, an =
unprecedented insight into life and the youthculture of the Seventies and t=
he Eighties, perhaps the generationmost affected by what has been called th=
e drug culture.
***
Born in Foggia in 1957, Caterina Davinio grew up in Rome, where, after a de=
gree in Italian Literature at Sapienza University, she dealt with contempor=
ary art and new media, as a writer, as a curator and a theorist. Featured i=
n international anthologies and journals, she has published the poetry coll=
ection SerialPhenomenologies, Campanotto, 2010, special mention in Nabokov =
Prize 2011 and in Lorenzo Montano Prize 2012, withparallel English text, af=
terword by Francesco Muzzioli and a criticalnote by David W. Seaman; the no=
vel Color Color, 1998; the essays: Techno-Poetry and Virtual Realities, 200=
2, with preface by Eugenio Miccini, and Virtual Mercury House. Planetary &a=
mp; Interplanetary Events, book with dvd, 2012, about net-poetry. She gaine=
d recognitions as a finalist in the awards: Lorenzo Montano,Franco Fortini,=
 2011, Scriveredonna 2010 (Pescara), for unpublished poetry. Among the pion=
eers of digital poetry and art in 1990, she has exhibited in more than thre=
e hundred expos in many countries of Europe, Asia, America, Australia. Sinc=
e 1997 she participated and has created poetry and multimedia art events in=
 seven editions of the Venice Biennale and collateral events.              =

[Forwarding appreciated]

Leap second festival

Festival program

The leap second is approaching... The coming Saturday at midnight,
30th June 23:59:60 (UTC), the first Leap second festival will take
place. It will last until the 1st of July 00:00:00 (UTC). Within this
leap second all the works of the festival are exhibited and performed.
There are thirty-seven participants exhibiting and performing works of
different types - video, audio, text, poem, visual, visual text,
animation, conceptual, instructional, narration, dedication, musical
score, polemic (if we want to categorize them as such).

The participants are A. Andreas (Andreas Maria Jacobs), Cristina
Andries, Sissel Berntsen, Brian Blaney, Ana Buigues, Yiorgos
Chouliaras, Elisabeth S. Clark, Simon Coates, Roger Cummiskey, Chris
Funkhouser, Peter Grass, Mathias Hauan Arbo, Martin Howse,
INTERLICHTSPIELHAUS, Karl Heinz Jeron, Halvard Johnson, Irena
Kalodera, Daniel Kelley, Jyrki Kirjalainen, Bonnie MacAllister, Bj=C3=B8rn
Magnhild=C3=B8en, Nick Mattan, albert negredo, Pasha Radetzki, Stefan
Riebel, Jesse Scott, Alan Sondheim, Anthony Stephenson, Otto Tall,
andrew topel, jurgen trautwein aka jtwine, Nico Vassilakis, Visuel
Sound : Blaise Merino & Ir=C3=A8ne Strubbe, Paul Wiegerinck, Jan Windle,
Margo Wolf.

Most works are shown in digital format and using the net as their
venue, though their content might as well refer to other formats,
venues and domains - whether online, offline, outline, site, on-site,
non-site (or how we prefer). The festival is a distributed event
coordinated on the net.

Most works last one second. Though some are time-independent (in
format), the basic idea of a miniature work that can be
exhibited/performed within one second is followed.

Since the festival only lasts one second, everything has to be shown
simultaneously. So, Saturday at midnight, 30th June 23:59:60 (UTC),
people going to the Leap second festival site will be able to see all
the works executed, exhibited, and performed (or what it takes).

In reality, the festival is an event that happens in a particular
time, and not in any particular place. And since we all share the same
time living on this free oscillating ball, disregarding relativity
theory for the moment, the festival will actually take place
everywhere and at the same time. We earthball-people operate with
timezones, so take care to check when 30th of June 23:59:60 (UTC) is
likely to happen in your temporary zone (autonomous or not), because
the leap second does not occur on June 30 everywhere. Have a look at
what UTC time is and compare to your clock to know when it's due.

With this in mind, we proceed to the festival program, and have a look
at what will happen during the leap second.

All @ 23:59:60

A number of video and visual works will be shown. A mini movie with
and without media by Paul Wiegerinck investigates the minimal
requirements of the movie media. Bending Time and Space 1 Second for
10 Times by Jyrki Kirjalainen explores the perceptional illusion of
time contraction through a repetition of a one-second sequence of the
earth exploding. Change Brief Abridged by Anthony Stephenson is a
series of motion studies based on the multi-paneled painting titled
"Change - 3 Coins 64 Times". Martin Howse describes in
container//mpeginmpeg a set of content-free, protocol-driven code
objects which are embedded Russian-doll-style within themselves, in
this instance one single video frame, and further explains, "The code
for each object (commandline, Python or C code) is self-consciously
literal, describing the process as algorithm without shortcuts. The
container project embraces the use of the quine with any compiler
considered as an embedding device. Future container examples will
extend to include film-in-film and pornography-in-pornography. The
container project raises the question of where any protocol boundaries
for embeddings can be established". Irena Kalodera's film suite I-II
can be considered, in the festival's opinion, self-referencial 'motion
pictures' and meta-framing. millisecond(s) by Jesse Scott is an
executable/applet of generative, random programming.  shut@#%$^$up by
Cristina Andrie=C8=99 is described as "The necessary solution to an
unnecessary situation" and might be said to be a short and brutal
political statement. INTERLICHTSPIELHAUS is showing six approximate
seconds, based on 3D-model animations (as far as we know). The stitch
by Ana Buigues demonstrates in the textile arts the extra stitch at
the end of every round that one has to do, and without which the next
round gets too tight. Whatever by Jan Windle is a 0.8 second polemic
on the relationship of the present to the future (leaving some time
for reflection before the festival ends). Bonnie MacAllister will be
showing What the Water Wore filmed on location in Solomon's Island,
MD. Also on the program are Caveat 1.1 by Simon Coates, Geschenke by
Visuel Sound : Blaise Merino & Ir=C3=A8ne Strubbe, Mumble Sign by Otto
Tall, Jump/cut//Impossible continuous action by Bj=C3=B8rn Magnhild=C3=B8en=
, and
Phony Lounge by Pasha Radetzki.

Event/intervention. During the light intervention En un clin d'=C5=93il by
Elisabeth S. Clark, 218 street lampposts in Bad Ems, Germany, will
simultaneously be switched off as a split-second negation of light.
This single second non-(street)light orchestration is ephemeral but
will nevertheless signal and question the very measurement and
distribution of time. At the leap second, Elisabeth S. Clark proposes
that Bad Ems encounter a glimpse of non-time.

Music, sound, and audio related work embrace many different types of
work. With Leap Second Split the sculptor Sissel Berntsen will in an
action record the sound of a 13100 kg piece of black diabase stone
splitting in the moment of the leap second. This action will take
place in Johansen Monumenthuggeri, Skjeberg , Norway. Frenchmebeer by
Jurgen Trautwein AKA jtwine is ordering a draft beer in french. Jaa
Nee - Yes No by Karl Heinz Jeron, a computer voice, a possible
reference to Joseph Beuys, the bible, the digital, or all... . Daniel
Kelley is for this 25th leap second presenting the musical score L25,
A Free Oscillation of Earth During the Leap Second of 30 June 2012. In
the informal notes, L25 for dummies he says about the work, "Using the
Earth as a model of a couple of large bells, which can be excited by a
Great earthquake, such as the 2004 Sumatra-Andaman, one of the bells
represents the uniform ringing of the atomic time scale, the other
bell beats slightly out of phase based on the prediction of change the
Earth rotation rate between 29 and 30 June." Another poignant sound
work for the festival, concerning global instability and precarity
(whether political or physical), is The sound of money by A. Andreas
(Andreas Maria Jacobs). This is the sound of 5 years Germany daily
electricity prices from 2008 - 2013, squeezed to 1 second and
compressed to the audible frequency range.

To continue pigeonholing and hair-counting the works, we've come to
textual based ones. Chris Funkhouser's three work that are to be shown
- Ascend Pole, Oceans Pled, Placed Scaled Planes Spaced Places - are
digital poetry text animations, dealing with anagrams for/of the leap
second (which itself can be considered an anagrammatic operation on
time). Buffering... by Bj=C3=B8rn Magnhild=C3=B8en is an instruction piece =
about
the stopping of time and mind. Classic Outlines (part of the Fast Food
Classics) by Yiorgos Chouliaras is a poem which can be read in less
than 1 second (by an epically fast narrator/reader). Dedication Pieces
by Stefan Riebel is a performative textual piece, dedicating to the
leap second. The Four videos by Nico Vassilakis are visual poetry
pieces exploring narratives between text, image, and motion. k!: cal
1752 by Alan Sondheim presents a textual command that outputs the
singular calendar of 1752 when it went from Julian to Gregorian.
Halvard Johnson's word-poem deals with an aspect of spacetime. Andrew
Topel's [untitled #1], [untitled #2] are instruction pieces for
anybody to perform during the leap second. The sun is bright by
Mathias Hauan Arbo is a 1 second video of rewriting a text. Also to be
exhibited are Nick Mattan's text animation [untitled], John Connor is
Peter Parker by Margo Wolf, Messi by Roger Cummiskey, One Second Om by
Peter Grass, and Records by Albert Negredo.

In addition there's also a small text section of the festival that
consists of: Dead moments in time - The micromanaging moments of a
cave man - By Ana Buigues. L25 for dummies - Notes on the musical
score L25 by Daniel Kelley - A correspondence between Daniel Kelley
and Bj=C3=B8rn Magnhild=C3=B8en. Leap second perspectives - Poem - By Brian
Blaney. mafestOmarch (doc) - An art-social initiative - an art march
rather than an art movement - by Pasha Radetzki. One should produce
that thought which is nowhere supported - A commentary on a sentence
from the platform sutra (teachings of Hui-neng) -  By Bj=C3=B8rn
Magnhild=C3=B8en. VR Improvised - A improvised meditation on the virtual
and the real - By Alan Sondheim.

What's with "our video" and "Your interface", Murat? The piece under
discussion is Joe Keenan's MOMENT; it isn't a work of mine. But the video
about it is mine, not "ours".

Here is the final version of the video I made about MOMENT:

If, as you say, you're simply clicking to see what happens, then you're not
getting it, Murat. Seek out the metaphors. Then explore how they are
developed. That way, you will stand a better chance of enjoying the piece as
a work of writerly visual, kinetic and interactive poetry by exploring the
texts, visuals, animation, and programming. Via clicking, reading, viewing,
and getting under the neath text.
