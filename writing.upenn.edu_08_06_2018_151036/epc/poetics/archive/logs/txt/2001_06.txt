Subject:      "Speech" as whatever corporations want it to be

This story, from the LA Times, is too surreal to characterize. If you're of
the mind that the Supreme Court's characterization of $$ as "speech" (and
thus uncontrollable in elections) is nutsy, this will really make your head
spin. The list that I saw this on -- net-time -- had a note that an op-ed
piece had circulated in times past that computer viruses (viri?) should
likewise be protected as a form of speech and that to block them was to
censor.

Personally, I preferred it when Speech was just the lead singer in Arrested
Development.

Corporate Free Speech Battle Is Escalating


By EDMUND SANDERS, Times Staff Writer




    WASHINGTON--When the founding fathers established the right to free
speech, they hardly could have had AOL Time Warner Inc. and AT&T Corp. in
mind.
     But major corporations are increasingly casting themselves as 21st
century Thomas Paines whose commercial pursuits are a form of speech that
should be shielded from government regulation, just as anti-war activists
and abortion opponents believe they should be free to express their views.
     In recent months, some federal court rulings have suggested that
corporate America is making headway, particularly in the cable television,
Internet and information industries.
     These successes are rekindling a debate over how far to extend
free-speech protections and whose constitutional interests should prevail
when citizens are pitted against corporations.
     Consider some of the legal questions: Does a telemarketer have a
constitutional right to call at dinner time? Can Time Warner exceed
government-imposed market caps because it has a 1st Amendment right to sell
HBO and Cartoon Network to cable customers? Would a ban on the sale of
Social Security numbers violate the free speech of credit bureaus, private
investigators and information brokers?
     Critics lament that businesses are hijacking a cherished American tenet
and using it as a tool to make money and escape government regulation.
     "If the founding fathers were alive, they would never stop throwing
up," said Robert W. McChesney, media professor at University of Illinois,
borrowing a famous Woody Allen line.
     "Once you say that the right to make money is protected by the 1st
Amendment, you turn the marketplace of ideas into a junkyard. It's only a
matter of time before the 1st Amendment covers everything."
     Business leaders exult in what they say is a long-overdue recognition
that corporations have constitutional rights too.
     "In the United States, we still have certain legislation and certain
rules that were designed for another period," AOL Time Warner Chief
Executive Gerald Levin said recently. "Increasingly, through the help of the
courts--that is, the reach of the 1st Amendment--we'll have opportunities."
     Marv Johnson, legislative counsel for the American Civil Liberties
Union, said, "Free speech in the commercial areas seems to be gaining in the
courts and getting closer to the kind of protections that you see on
so-called traditional speech."
     Lawrence Lessig, a constitutional scholar at Stanford Law School,
worries that corporations are using 1st Amendment arguments primarily to
stifle competition, circumvent antitrust rules and gain a stranglehold on
emerging industries, particularly the Internet.
     AT&T, for example, cried 1st Amendment foul after Broward County, Fla.,
using an "open-access" ordinance, tried to force the cable giant to lease
its high-speed Internet wires to rivals.
     The goal, county officials say, was to ensure consumers had more
options in connecting to the Internet, not to interfere with content or
viewpoint.
     But AT&T convinced a federal judge in November that the local law
violated the company's constitutional rights because it forced AT&T to carry
the "speech" of a rival--in this case, the other company's Internet service.
     "That's data transmission, not speech," said Andrew Jay Schwartzman,
president of Media Access Project, which has opposed many of the
corporations' 1st Amendment claims.
     Under the 1st Amendment, it's not unreasonable, Schwartzman said, to
argue that the government may not block companies from expressing viewpoints
that the government finds offensive. But it's a long way from that argument
to using the free-speech argument to combat government rules designed to
serve the public interest, he said.
     Time Warner scored another big victory in March when the U.S. Court of
Appeals in Washington tossed out federal rules preventing any single cable
operator from controlling more than 30% of a market.
     The judges ruled that Time Warner had a 1st Amendment right to grow
larger--that is, to "speak" to additional customers--and that the Federal
Communications Commission had not demonstrated the government's overriding
interest in interfering. The FCC had set the cap at the behest of Congress
because it wanted to ensure a diversity of cable programming.
     The ruling suddenly threw into question long-standing ownership caps
affecting other industries, such as broadcasting and publishing, even though
those rules had withstood constitutional challenges.
     Viacom Inc. last month won a stay of an FCC order that would have
forced it to sell some of its television stations to comply with the
agency's broadcast ownership rules. (Tribune Co., owner of the Los Angeles
Times, would benefit from the removal of rules preventing cross-ownership of
newspapers and broadcast stations in the same market.)
     Companies say it's a mistake to view the free-speech rights of
corporations as less important than those of citizens.
     "When you have an individual speaker, it's easier to put a face on the
free-speech issue than it is with a multinational corporation," said Robert
Corn-Revere, a Washington attorney who has represented cable and Internet
companies in their 1st Amendment claims. "But you are still talking about
bedrock 1st Amendment principles."
     Others warn that ranking free-speech rights is a slippery slope. "If
you start chipping away at 1st Amendment rights, pretty soon you don't have
anything left," said Richard T. Kaplar, editor of Commercial Free Speech
Digest, a newsletter advocating the rights of businesses.
     Schwartzman said companies don't deserve equal protection.
"Corporations are artificial entities," he said. "Yet they are being
afforded speech rights as if they were living, breathing, voting citizens."
     When the U.S. Supreme Court first recognized the free-speech rights of
companies in 1976, it afforded commercial speech less protection than
traditional speech. Companies have been fighting to tear down the two-tiered
system ever since.
     Privacy is expected to provide the next 1st Amendment battleground.
Attempts to outlaw or restrict the sale of personal information and public
records are being met by 1st Amendment challenges from information vendors,
which say they have a right to communicate with their customers.
     Pending bills that would ban unsolicited commercial e-mail or prohibit
telemarketers from calling during the dinner hour would violate companies'
constitutional rights, said Jerry Cerasale, attorney for the Direct
Marketing Assn.
     Even the requirement that a Web site post its privacy policy is
vulnerable to being struck down as a form of "compelled speech," said UCLA
law professor Eugene Volokh, who believes 1st Amendment protections should
trump privacy rights.
     If the government is allowed to restrict the spread of one kind of
information, such as Social Security numbers or public records, it might be
tempted to try to restrict another type of information, such as newspaper
articles, Volokh said.
     "The 1st Amendment is about stopping the government from restricting
the content and flow of information," he said.
     That argument was pushed recently by credit bureau Trans Union Corp.,
information brokers and consumer database companies. They sued the Federal
Trade Commission, saying their free-speech rights were violated by a
proposed regulation that would restrict the sale of Social Security numbers
and other data from credit reports.
     The federal District Court in Washington rejected the claim, saying the
government's interest in protecting consumers' privacy outweighed the
companies' 1st Amendment rights.
     Last year, the U.S. Supreme Court took a different view by letting
stand a U.S. 10th Circuit Court of Appeals ruling that struck down an FCC
privacy rule on 1st Amendment grounds. The rule required telephone companies
to get customers' permission before using or selling their personal
information for marketing purposes.
     Despite such rulings, the legal challenges to corporations' rights to
free speech have frequently forced government agencies to back down from
regulatory actions.
     FCC Chairman Michael K. Powell has said his agency will need to
reexamine the constitutionality of ownership caps in light of the Time
Warner case. In Florida, county commissioners abandoned their efforts to
force AT&T to open its cable lines to rivals.
     "It has greatly undercut the power of the government," said former FCC
Chairman Reed Hundt. "These decisions inhibit good policy and create delay.
And at the end of the day, they defeat the very goal of the 1st Amendment by
putting the free-speech rights of powerful companies ahead of the
free-speech rights of everyone else."

Murat. Maybe you could quote more of what was said because on the face of it
it seems ridiculous to want anything to be boring. I did read of a report of
a John Cage lecture that was held to be "boring" but I'm not sure about
that...I wasnt there! But maybe the reference is to those aspects of things
that are - at first sight - seemingly tedious _ that John Ashbery has
referred to - those experiences we have waiting in ques or whatever. Thus it
becomes a challenge of the person or witer or poet or whoever is in this
"boring" situation, to turn it around, to not let it make you angry or
whatever...but that's probably not what you were talking about.
   Poetry - the same poetry - can seem to be boring to one person and not
another. I'm not interested in Shakespeare's sonnets: I find them boring.
Although I liked them as a teenager at school...or the ones we studied...but
I've no doubt if I attended lectures by someone who was a great enthusiast
for Bill's sonnets I would become "unbored".
  If I were to set out now to write something meaningful in poetry or
whatever you call it, my aim would not be to bore people! But maybe I
wouldnt be interested in writing what is "beautiful" or what is  _perceived_
to be poetic: thus some people will find it boring. Maybe everyone, who
cares? To set out to be uninteresting per se might be a project, or a
strategy, to avoid "over the top" lush stuff...that (the lush stuff)I like
doing myself. A kind of check or discipline.
  I dont think a poet can control a reader's response though.  Your kind of
putting the cart before the horse. The question is which poems are you
looking at and why dont you like them. There's a poet I know whose work is
sub lang poetry but I simply cant read it: as you say, it bores, or to say
it better, I cant engage with the writer's work. I conclude: 1. I dont get
it. or 2. It is simply bad poetry. 3. At the moment I'm not in the right
"space" to appreciate it.
  So I leave it aside. I still read eg Ron Silliman etc but I can enjoy as
they call it some of the more "conventional" poets eg in Fence...poets who
are highly intelligent but not "experimental"... in other words...variety is
the spice of life! I dont want to be saying  all the time: "Should I like
this poetry? Oh gosh, Charles Bernstein would say that this poem is crap. Oh
bother I cant read that." No. I happen to be reading that gentleman's essay
his book on poetics, not  because I have to, but because I'm curious about
it...but reading Bernstein or whatever doesnt commit me to liking or
agreeing with everything or anything he says or any other so-called Langpo
or anyone. I think poets are too much individualists eg for the author to
diseappear for example (not that Bernstein neccessarily is in favour of
that)) and I dont read philosophy much. I try to think for myself and i
write for myself. Probably why I'm hardly published but its good fun for me.
  I agree with the idea of resistivity but there's a limit for me: some
stuff i find too "difficult" or too simplistic. Sounds as though I like to
have my cake and eat it ... to use another cliche.  Another direction maybe
not exhausted is David Antin's "talk poems" which BEGIN the process of an
interchange between the author and the audience. I suspect by the way, that
many Langpos (and Official Verse people or whatever you pigeon hole them as)
never really want much feedback. Cage's poem/composition (music) based on
Finnegan's Wake was an attempt in that direction.(The lectures he held as
reported in Radical Artifice by Marjorie Perloff.) Maybe one day we will see
a total participation of the audience...its been done somewhat.  I had  a
short stint teaching how to write poetry...it was fairly "loose" so I tried
to get the people to make the poem. I also asked questions. I was asked
questions but i could only say what I knew...but people are still habituated
to being lectured to.But Ididnt reallly want that (part of me the ego-child
did tho!) What iconsciously wanted was for tose people to braqnch out and
say: to hell with convention, I'll do MY own thing...to hell with Richard
Taylor....the teacher succeeds by putting him'herself out of a job! Becomes
a motivator..rather than a fact Gradgrinder. Children , by contrast,  love
to take over once they are given reign. Their inhibitions to conform are
less set in concrete: and a good teacher encourages self sufficiencey and
the ability to question and research. Contrast the old bourgeious (I can
never spell that word) Dickensian ways (not that Dickens was in favour he
hated them and rightly satirised them in Nicholas Nickelby and Hard Times
etc) or even some teachers nowdays. If the poetic practice (cf somwhat this
list) encourages people to be self starters and "indivdualists" without
being ugly egotists: that is to be quietly proud of one's work regardless of
its reception, to enter into discussions, to be open, compassionate...and so
on.  I dont think you should knock some of the great  aspects of American
culture: they should be pursued and the terrible things attacked. We may be
poetic "geniuses" but, well Roger Horrocks (who by the way has just written
a biography of Len Lye (artist poet and experimental film maker) the
NZ-American-French-British (but born here in NZ and fundamentally a NZr))
told me one day how he had met Zukofsky. He said of him that he was a very
nice man. He means, and Roger is a very good man, a good man as far as  he
could see at the time. OK Z had his faults no doubt...whatever. Let's love
ourselves in order to love others: I think that, without the accompanying
sentiment, as Lynn Heijinian says in an interview: the Langpo movement was a
utopian project. That's a start. The whole movement had many ideas and there
are many "offshoots"...look, its better for me, I'm RIGHT on the outside.
NOBODDY love's me!! (Except my children I hope.) I'm on a very low income,
have very little published, very few close friends in lit circles at all,
let alone Langpo card carryers...it can all go to fuck except that I'm very
interested in literature and art (as well as other things of course). The
guys who got tossed off the list should have an input (as long as they dont
go crazy abusing everyone..).but apart from that we should open things up. I
know there is a tendency for any "movement" to form its coteries and
cliques...Kleinzahler was over here (1992) (Auckland) and that was one of
his complaints about Langpo (which I think he hated - from memory). I have
to admit that I find his work rather obscure: I can get into Andrews or the
others more easily...besides which Andrews I find very funny. But some of
Kleinzahler's stuff was good. But its better  to be on the outside and "do
one's own thing" as far as that is possible.Maybe good top keep away from
the "politics" of it all. Go your own way. But dont endorse "boring" poetry
or writing: sounds like an oxymoron...of course you dont like it because you
are bored by it! Its the reason I dont read much philosophy eg the modern
French guys that Bowering likes so much. They write a lot of long-winded
crap. But that's my opinion...maybe not all of them. Just some thoughts of a
dry brain in a dry time. Richard Taylor.PS It sounds as though you are
already "going your own way" so forgive that comment..I think you know the
import of it.

I think it's important to keep in mind that this claim for a useful or
poetic boredom predates and is hardly limited to LANGUAGE poets -- I
recall, for one of many examples, an interview with Robert Kelly in which
he spoke of having learned from reading Enslin that a certain sort of
boredom in the long poem could have value -- this was in the context of his
writing of THE LOOM, if I remember --

Funny.  I bumped into a a local first generation "Language Poet" the
afternoon of the article, and he had taken a resentment to what Myles
said about her dislike for middle class poets who temporarily drop out,
do the bohemian scene, and then re-enter their predestined professional
class.  This peripatetic "Language Poet" said he likes Eileen very much
--- who couldn't?! --- but that he read that remark as an "attack" very
specifically targeted at your scene, Ron.


For my own part, I found the most edifying news in the article to be the
musician-poet hybrid/collaboration scene that's emerging.

Apropos of this Digital Haiku reiteration of "The Return of the Haiku,"---

I'm having trouble finding an in-print report on it, but did people hear about Usurper Bush and HAIKU in his recent Yale speech?  I had expected there'd be some EPC commentary.

It was very under-reported in The Times: "Bush, returning to the school he did his darnedest to downplay when he was Texas governor, jokingly blamed a haiku poetry course for his bungled English.".

But I hear a radio report on it, and the sound bite was much more provocative.  In essence, Ubu Bush said:

Many of you wonder about my stammering,--- halting--- way of speaking.  In fact--- the way that I talk--- is a perfect re-creation--- of the ancient Japanese poem form--- of the haiku.


I thought it the right time to write to The White House on the subject of poetry, don't you think? to see how his team would respond to inquiries after his plans to serve his experimentalist poetry citizens.

Okay. The collective cold shoulder routine is working, and I'm beginning to
realize from the emphatic non-response that I'm barking into the Duino wind with
this one-man agenda about post-modern classical meter---  However, since I have
been nicely back-channeled by lurker, I'll continue in my unattended rant (I'm
beginning to see how Alan Sondheim must feel).

Tinkered this brief (unimpressive and discardable) metrical exercise the other
evening (below), on THE DOCHMIAC, a five-syllable Greek "foot":

_ / / _ _ /

What I hoped my earlier "Well-Wishers" posting would demonstrate --- by the
relative inaudibility of its rhythm, as opposed to New Formalist buh-BUM-buh-BUM
iambics --- is that "true" classical meter is subtly nuanced and varied in a way
that keep it quite suited to progressives.

Dicta: New Formalism is misrepresenting the very models they point to.  Metrics
has been re-politicized by their misappropriation of Athenian democracy.
Neo-classicism is entirely a Modernist legacy (H.D., Pound, "Kora in Hell,"
Martha Graham, Elliot Carter's "The Minotaur" and "Syringa," Isadora
Duncan...!).  An ear trained to hear minute shifts of cadence is better prepared
to catch the hesitancies and falsities of politicized language. Go Greek.

The five verses below are "dochmiac dimeter," two dochmiacs per line. (Classical
metrics is fun obfuscation for Langpo-lovin' obscurantists too, because it has
so much burrogrove terminology: cola, biceps...!)

(The dochmiac alone sub-divides into no less than --- get this! --- 32, yes,
thirty-two recognized variations.  The variations begin to proliferate after
"resolution," that any long syllable can be replaced by two shorts.  It's about
the freedom of the dochmiac, in fact, that Amy Dale spoke of "Prometheus Bound"
sections as "vers libre.")

I have tried, very Tennyson-Swinburne, to fuse English qualitative and Greek
quantitative stress (or "quan./qual." vice-versa, never recall which) by using
long vowels and diphthongs only on stressed syllables (three exceptions: "cor-",
"-ty", and "bou-").

There's a superb post-modern neo-classical poem after Davenport's Archilochus in
the latest Fence.  ...Taking also as a new raised bar Stacy Doris' Ovid spoof in
her new Krupskaya "Paramour."

P.S.  Thanks for all the "Get Well" cards and flowers about my left middle
finger injury--- especially the bird-of-paradise from J.D. McClatchey!

[why art should not exist to appease]

I

The well-measured resentments spilled forth
From the cup – left each grain
In a separate square of the grid.
“How unique!” We exclaimed – and swirled them
About as though there were a game,
A predetermined sequence that may lead
To a questionable condition of Victory,
As though furrowing the brow meant thought.

II

All empty gestures of meaning were meaning by
Their merest relations. Philosophers who
Were raised on the sands of the beach, and flung
Rhetorical bottles to Poseidon, quarreled with
The philosophers who lived among the sands
Of the desert, with tomes more ponderous
Than the unfortunate camels that bore them,
But both were in agreement that the urbane poet
Was doubly cursed, for they were promiscuous
In their dealings with the psyche – and some
Of the worst people – it is certain – are poets.

III

What single act could astonish if performed by
that
Quaint Enlightenment notion, our “fellow
Man.” Still… We relent to the curious turnings.
Invent new glues each year weaker than those
Previous, until the chicken-wire underpinning
Goes kaput  and we are left astray in a field of
hexagons.
Options reduced to only six horizontal
directions.

III

It’s been expressed that the purity
Of lunar frequencies
Contrasting
Is responsible for one in seven
Acts of social madness and civil
Disobedience.
How many accepted ones?
Who knows?
Let’s say three.
The anxiety of the sketch artist
Dealing with the soft facts of space
As though “reality” were not
A mistress of tender harshness,
A higher standard than that of
“The Old Masters”,
Who are after all dead and myth,
While the present
Is ever present
And wholly mythic.

IV

“Why does my pen get nervous as I get near the
end of the page?”
I asked my (who else?) therapist.
Silence. Her wisdom being such
That I was immediately thrown back
On the availability of my own resources.
After a single session I was cured of my
melancholy
And a life-long phobia of stick-men vanished over
night.
Now, some of my best friends are stick men!
Truly affable fellows, with small appetites, and
words few but insightful.
Their presence a rebuke to artistic pretension.

V

Of course the media is
Incestuous!  And onanism in this
Belated hour can rightly be termed “necrophilia.”
I would turn
And face the day.
But my eyebrows are false,
Cemented to the ruins of my skull
With spirit-gum.
This is the price
For dwelling in the apogee of the sun.
Stray rays lacerate my organs
Like a cat-o’-nine-tails.
Some think Space to be empty.
I know that it is full of gray delirium
And spare archetypes.

VI

Failsafe mechanism
An oxymoron.
I had not the lobes
To listen.
Of course
We could
Give our souls
Fully to the discipline
Of passion – but instead…
The eyes have – and eyes
Are –  eyes of greed.
Some more assiduous
At meeting their need than others.
Some eyes are stealthy.
Others operate on a principle of brute force.
The difference being the same as that of
A lily of the field
God cradles in His Mercy,
And one inked and anchored
Directly to flesh.

VII

Labeled “self-indulgent” when another’s self not
being indulged.
I will not be falsely accused if I cannot track
where one’s selfhood is complete
And another begins.
If the map is faithfully rendered,
We will easily perceive that debated territory,
With lines that could well be drawn otherwise.
Colors that delineate lakes from “not lakes” are
arbitrary,
But pretty, even so.

VIII

Thus I release the debates to clouds
That are without verb.
Allow the garden of language to usurp,
And spill bright leaves into neighbourhood yards,
Though they protest the wandering of winds,
In their secret hearts they bless the wealth of
autumn.
Bring closure to deliberations.
May faith bury faith.
Sew new gaudy buttons on old navy suit-coats.
Relive prophecy through days
As though they were remaindered blue boats.

Jeannie Bergmann





Jeannie runs a website for poetry news/events in Madison,
Wisconsin –  http://www.madpoetry.org – which now has a link to RealPoetik.
She notes, "Please note some necessary alterations in the text below –
to wit: in the first poem, Change of Life, the words "wonderful" (#1) and
"poetry" in the second line should be struck through...."  Which turns
out to be significant, actually.  She's had work in Connected: Poetry
In the Age of Computers.

But mostly, I couldn't resist the shameless flattery.




CHANGE OF LIFE (an epistolary homage)
I’m moved beyond recognition by your simple peasant ways. Here, have some
toluene
        from Optima Suavidad by Sal Salasin

Dear Mr. Salasin,
        Your wonderful book of wonderful poetry poems
        changed my life!
        the second book, not the first book;
        I’m sure the first book is wonderful, too,
        but I haven’t read it yet.
I know it’s time to change my life
        when I throw it at the wall
        and it sticks.
I was going to try to change my life on a regular schedule;
        twice a year, when I turn over the mattress,
        but I have a waterbed.
There’s nothing like the soothing sound of water
        to give you pleasant dreams
        and wake you up in the middle of the night
        to go to the bathroom.
I always turn on the light
        and look in the toilet before I sit down
        because you never know.
        They keep saying, “There is nothing living in there!”
        but ask them to drink out of it:
        they’ll change their tune.
I need to change my tune.
        Does anybody know a good place to get jingles removed?
I often feel limited by not understanding modern trends in poetics.
        Of course, I don’t really want to understand those trends that well;
        just enough to make fun of them.
Sometimes I feel at a cultural disadvantage compared to other poets
        because I haven’t ever had a drug problem
        been alcoholic
        had an abortion
        been a lesbian
        been colored (I mean, besides beige; I guess Magic Marker doesn’t count)
        gotten a tattoo (I guess Magic Marker doesn’t count for that, either)
        gotten divorced
        been on welfare (I guess Medical Assistance doesn’t count)
        been homeless,
        but today is the first day of the rest of my life.
I have been hopeless,
        more or less, but that was because I was molting.
I lived in the ghetto once,
        but it was a tiny one,
        and everybody was nice to me.
I was thinking of being polyandrous,
        but the waterbed is crowded enough as it is.
I’ve never had a criminal record or done time,
        although that may change,
        now that we’ve got a new President.
George Bush said on tv
        that the most important thing in his life
        was possessions.
        His handlers seem to be way below standard
        for Republican presidents.
        I think his tune needs changing.
        And while he’s at it, he should change his life, too.

sometimes they'll be in logs and memories of configured software
sometimes they're gone forever and in any case no one cares
caring is a reaching-out and empathy which displaces emptiness
but emptiness remains alone when the other or one has left
fragility is the day's order in the guise of magnetic domains
domains are swept by magnetic fields of earths and moons and stars
there's such sadness when someone leaves the talker moo or mud
there's such a loss that the space is oddly emptied and incomplete
moving around there's no one in any of the rooms or programmed spaces
there's no one digging or creating or posting secret messages or mail
the wizards have gone home taking gods and programmers with them
no visiting guests come in to entertain the solitary speaker
the leaving is remarked but the entering is lost and never so

Jeffrey. Doubt you're being cold-shouldered. I personally eg havent yet had
time to look close at what you've emailed. Willdo. Others maybe also
hard-pressed, Re Alan Sond.  He's very interesting but he purs out so much
one (at least I)  feel overwhelmed by it all. But nothing wrong just that
one cant comment on everything. He's had a lot of feedback over the last six
months or so. Regards, Richard.

I am lurker mentioned above and quite obscure.
And sometimes engage Alan Sondheim in the 'hood
(Park Slope, Brooklyn, New York, US of A).

Jeffrey Jullich said on 5/11/2001:
>  > Given the new fluidity (Deleuzian flux) and commented-upon variousness that

Blame it on the Beats, perhaps, and their influence
on poets such as I who are befuddled since
elementary school by stress. I could never
quite get it right when asked to mark the accented
syllables in words. To me the accent could go
on any syllable. Even when vocalized
a word's stresses would shift this way and that in my
hearing. The idea of syllable length seems less
shifty to me than stress but from what I gather
it's stress that is the metric scanned for in English
language meter. Qual' rather than quan'. So over
the years (I'm now thirty-nine) I've practically
ignored the whole topic of poetic meter.
Until now that is.

More J.J. from his post of 5/11/2001:
>  > Parenthetically, "post-Language" as a term of course referred to
>>  "post-L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E," that is, ~after~ that movement named after a
>>  journal,--- like "post-GQ."  Curiously, though, the EPC sees it progressing

>>  entering a new sort of post-literacy.


Greg Ulmer at Univ. of Florida has written about ~electracy~.
http://web.nwe.ufl.edu/~gulmer/disseminar/invent.html
He says there: "Electracy is to digital technologies
what literacy is to print."

As a Telecommunications Engineer in corporate America,
I've lately been pursuing knowledge of how this thing
called data communications actually works under the hood.
Topics like VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol), IP routing,
MPLS (Multi-Protocol Label Switching), etc. Besides being
mesmerized by the plethora of acronymns, I groove on
the bit patterns of Ethernet frames and IP packets. (Bits
are digits used in the binary numbering system. Their value
is either 0 or 1, off or on, absence of voltage or presence
of voltage.) For me this resonates with the binariness
of poetic meter, unstressed or stressed, short or long.

Jeffrey. I cant work pout what you're saying here. You are making a critique
of....what?  What is the poem..your take on a Greek drama? Your translation?
It looks quite good but I cant decipher your notes to it. Sicerely, Richard

Does anyone know anything about the "League to Support Poetry"? It seems to
have begun in 1938-39 and was still happening in 1945-46. At first, at least,
this group sponsored "an experimental program contest," published an
anthology of selections, and awarded prizes. If you can help, please reply to
me directly: afilreis@english.upenn.edu.

Many thanks. - Al Filreis

It features many poets:

As always I am looking for poetry and poetic theory articles.  A new

experimental poetry books.

Contents

Attributes of Love | Espresso | Our Father
Certain Trees | Yearning To Be Beautiful
Light | When


Michael Hettich's book A SMALL BOAT was published by the University Press
of Florida (1990). His most recent chapbooks are SLEEPING WITH THE LIGHTS
ON from Pudding House Publications and MANY SIMPLE THINGS (1997) and
IMMACULATE BRIGHT ROOMS (1994) from March Street Press. He teaches English
and Creative Writing at Miami-Date Community College.


from The Moon Beneath The House

Our Father

wanted to taste the milk of every
species of mammal in North America
because he believed our human trace
started in milk, and because he loved

breasts. After that, he hoped to make
a journey collecting eggs, not only
bird but lizard, spider, insect
eggs as well, to taste them, moving

ever lower on the great chain until
he understood the diversity and subtle
textures of life on this continent with
knowledge he carried
on the tongue and in the blood.

He walked everywhere, and he slept outside
most nights. He believed that if he learned to focus
well enough he would eventually be able
to tell the size of a field with his eyes

shut, to be able to smell what mammals
lived in a forest and how many different
species of tree lived there too. He wanted
to fashion a language that incorporated barks

and purrings of all the wild creatures he encountered
so maybe a more nearly universal language
might be sung, at least in some
rudimentary form, and he tried to move

exactly like certain wild creatures, to make
only their sounds for days, to sleep
in the positions he'd observed them sleeping,
to hide the way they had, to vanish

the way they did. Eventually he'd learn to fly,
to breathe underwater, to live without thinking

Note the repeated use of the word "fraud."  The local police handed this
"case" over to the FBI.  Jeez.

A Beautiful Life, an Early Death, a Fraud Exposed


By KATIE HAFNER


On May 14, Kaycee Nicole Swenson, an effervescent 19-year-old, died from
complications surrounding leukemia, which she had been battling for nearly
two years. From her home in Kansas, Kaycee, an unyieldingly optimistic high
school basketball star, had chronicled her remissions and relapses in her
online diary, or Weblog, which she had dubbed Living Colours.

For nearly a year, thousands of people went to the site to follow her
travails. Many came to feel as if they knew her, and a few talked with her
regularly on the phone. Some sent her gifts. Others with cancer spoke of her
as an inspiration. On May 15, when Kaycee's online followers went to her
Weblog, they found a small image of a rose, accompanied by an announcement
of her death:

"Thank you for the love, the joy, the laughter and the tears. We shall love
you always and forever."

Hundreds of people, none of whom had ever met Kaycee, were crushed by the
news of her death. "So many people reached out to this beautiful girl who
was so positive in the face of adversity," said Saundra Mitchell, a
screenwriter in Indianapolis.

But Ms. Mitchell was one of the first to cast doubt on what turned out to be
an intricately detailed fabrication. A few days after the death
announcement, Debbie Swenson, a 40-year-old homemaker, confessed to having
invented the life and death of Kaycee. Ms. Swenson, who has two teenage
children and lives in Peabody, Kan., a small town about 50 miles northeast
of Wichita, had posed as Kaycee's mother.

In an interview at her home on Tuesday, Ms. Swenson, who appeared
embarrassed and contrite, acknowledged that she had been the one to create
the Kaycee character but said she had not intended to hurt anyone. She said
she was surprised to learn how many people had been reading about Kaycee and
to learn how emotionally invested people had become.

"The whole idea of an online journal is to write what you want to write,"
she said. "I wanted it to be something positive."

The Internet, of course, is no stranger to hoaxes. Cyberspace has become
home to so many jokes, stunts and fabrications that entire Web sites exist
just to keep track of them all. Usually the ruses are uncovered and
forgotten within a few days.

But Ms. Swenson's fabrication was constructed so expertly and made so
emotionally compelling that even when faced with evidence that it was not
true, many people who were sophisticated Internet veterans set aside their
skepticism and continued to believe it. Others put their online expertise to
work to ferret out the truth about the fictitious Kaycee.

The incident is revealing not only for what it says about the Internet as a
safe redoubt for deception but also for the role it played when dozens of
people, at once curious and angry, became electronic gumshoes and used the
Web to root out the fraud.

The online life of Kaycee Nicole began two years ago on a home page at a
site called CollegeClub.com, where Kaycee appeared as a sunny blonde whose
page was filled with photos, poetry and allusions to heaven.

A year later, Randall van der Woning, a fiction writer living in Hong Kong,
met Kaycee on CitizenX.com, a Webcam site. She told Mr. van der Woning that
she had leukemia, which was in remission. Last July, she said the cancer had
returned, and he offered to set up a Weblog and administer the site for her.
Her first posting in her online journal began last August:

"I'm beginning a new exciting journey," she wrote. "It's a journey into my
survival. I want to win! I'll fight to the finish!"

Not only did Mr. van der Woning, unaware of deception, spend countless hours
working on Kaycee's behalf, posting prose, poetry and photographs to the
site, but he also paid the cost of maintaining the site.

Occasionally Mr. van der Woning spoke on the telephone to someone he thought
was Kaycee, but most conversations took place using instant messaging. "I
spoke with her every day," Mr. van der Woning said. "Sometimes I spoke with
both Kaycee and Debbie at the same time. Figure that one out."

Ms. Swenson's own Weblog, also administered by Mr. van der Woning, offered
fine- grained descriptions of Kaycee's travails. This entry came during one
of Kaycee's hospital stays:

"I told her I loved her and everything was going to be alright. She was told
not to talk or move around. Green, glassy eyes looked at me as blood
trickled out of her mouth. The urge to hold her as I had when she was a
child was fierce."

"This is much more intricate and involved than anything I've been exposed
to," said John Halcyon Styn, a self-described "professional Web explorer"
who is a founder of CitizenX.com and lives in a house equipped with Webcams
in San Diego. Mr. Styn first encountered Kaycee about two years ago, when
she was on CollegeClub.com and went by the nickname Kutebabe.

Like Mr. van der Woning, Mr. Styn occasionally spoke on the phone with the
person he took to be Kaycee. Both he and Mr. van der Woning now believe that
the person on the other end of the line was Ms. Swenson. (Last year an
article in The New York Times on computer use by college students included
quotations and anecdotes attributed to Kaycee Swenson; the information was
based on a telephone interview that resulted from a referral by
CollegeClub.com.)

Many people who grew close to the character of Kaycee now point to signs
that should have made them more skeptical. Jim McCormick, a registered nurse
in Toms River, N.J., who communicated with Kaycee frequently via instant
messages, said he grew suspicious last November. "She blew a hepatic artery,
and I started having strange feelings when she didn't go into the I.C.U.,"
he said.

Mr. Styn used to work for CollegeClub.com, and at that time Kaycee was a
volunteer chat-room monitor. He found it curious that when he offered Kaycee
a paid position, she turned him down, explaining that she preferred to work
without pay.

Others noticed inconsistencies in dates or striking similarities between
spelling mistakes made by Kaycee and those made by Ms. Swenson on her own
Weblog site. Still others found it curious that a 19-year-old would quote
lyrics from the 60's and 70's.

In April, Kaycee told Mr. van der Woning that her liver was failing and that
she was dying. Mr. van der Woning posted the news on Kaycee's site.
Distraught, he called her and told her that he would like to visit her. "I
was quite insistent about that," he said, "because I didn't know how much
time there was going to be." Kaycee told Mr. van der Woning that she would
be glad to have him visit, but that first she was planning to drive with her
mother to Florida to visit a friend in Miami and see the ocean.

When Ms. Swenson called Mr. van der Woning on May 15 to report that Kaycee
had died unexpectedly from an aneurysm, she wept inconsolably. "She was
playing the part of the grieving mother all the way," Mr. van der Woning
said. When he posted the news on Kaycee's Weblog the following day, her
online friends grieved as if they had lost someone in their immediate
families.

But it was not until after the death that skepticism emerged full tilt. Ms.
Swenson told well-wishers via Mr. van der Woning that there was no address
for sending cards and flowers. She also said the cremation and memorial
service had already taken place, just two days after the death. The doubters
began to build their case.

"It was way too quick for it to happen," said Rogers Cadenhead, a writer in
St. Augustine, Fla. "That's what set a lot of people off, including me, who
thought it was real."

Matthew Haughey, a computer programmer in San Francisco who runs Metafilter,
an open Weblog where Kaycee and her illness had frequently been mentioned,
saw site traffic "go sky high." Upon comparing notes, people discovered that
no one, not even those who spoke to Kaycee frequently by phone, had ever met
her in person.

Ms. Mitchell, a 27-year-old crime buff, was one of the first to raise doubts
publicly, on her own Weblog. She used the Web to search for a death notice
in newspapers around Newton, Kan., where Kaycee presumably lived, but found
none.

The tone on Metafilter, meanwhile, grew heated. Then, through more
electronic sleuthing, one member of a Metafilter group of 50 or so people
now calling themselves the Scooby Doos discovered that Kaycee's CollegeClub
page was tied to the same account held by Kelli Swenson, Debbie Swenson's
real 15-year-old daughter. Another Metafilter member announced that three
days after Kaycee was supposed to have died, she logged on to her
CollegeClub.com account.

Early in the morning of May 19, Mr. van der Woning got a call from a tearful
Ms. Swenson, who offered an explanation: Kaycee's real name, she said, was
Katherine Marie, and she was the unwanted child of one of Ms. Swenson's
sisters. Ms. Swenson said she had brought up the girl as her own. Mr. van
der Woning must, of course, keep all of that secret, she told him.

Metafilter, meanwhile, was engorged with skeptical postings. When the
evidence of a hoax appeared incontrovertible, Ms. Swenson quickly sent Mr.
van der Woning via e-mail a full confession, which he then posted on Ms.
Swenson's Weblog on May 20.

"Debbie must have been reading all this and realized she wasn't going to be
able to hide anymore," Mr. van der Woning said, "and that's why she
confessed."

In her confession, Ms. Swenson said the Kaycee character had been a
composite of three people she knew who had died of cancer. "What I did was
wrong and I apologize for it," she wrote. "I regret any pain I caused."

Mr. van der Woning suspects that it was when he and others started making
plans to visit Kaycee that Ms. Swenson decided to kill off the character so
swiftly.

Even after Ms. Swenson's somewhat muddled public confession, the sleuthing
continued. Dan Engler, a Metafilter user in Seattle, used Photoshop to
resize a picture of Kaycee playing basketball. The enlarged shot revealed a
lion's head on the floor of the gymnasium. Metafilter users then did a
search that identified the team as the Lady Lions from a high school in
Oklahoma. They matched the No. 10 jersey to a student named Julie
Fullbright, who, it turned out, had once been acquainted with the Swensons
and was very much alive and attending college in Oklahoma. Ms. Fullbright
knew nothing of the hoax until Monday, when Ms. Swenson called her to
apologize, said Ms. Fullbright's father, Vernon.

"It was like a story being reported by locusts," Mr. Cadenhead said of the
diligence of the Scooby Doos. "They swept in and just pulled facts out of
the air."

The Peabody Police Department looked into the case, then handed it over to
the Federal Bureau of Investigation's field office in Kansas City, which in
turn decided not to investigate. "The loss isn't great enough for the F.B.I.
to open up a federal criminal investigation," said Jeff Lanza, an F.B.I.
officer. Mr. Lanza said the fact that Ms. Swenson had not actively solicited
money was another factor in the decision not to pursue the case.

Ms. Swenson said she had hired a lawyer because of the many angry phone
calls she had received. Nevertheless, Ms. Swenson said on Tuesday that she
believed the Kaycee character had been more helpful than harmful. "A lot of
people have problems," she said. "I know I helped a lot of people in a lot
of different ways."

She could be right. So compelling was Ms. Swenson's creation that powerful
online connections were made among those who believed in the Kaycee persona
and among those who pulled it apart.

Mr. Styn, whose gifts to the fictitious Kaycee had included a care package
filled with hats to cover her head during periods of baldness, said that he
refused to become cynical in the incident's unsettling wake.

"One lesson you can learn from this is to trust less, but I'm choosing not
to pick that one," Mr. Styn said. "The fact that she wasn't really there
doesn't mean that thousands of people weren't able to trust and give love to
a stranger. The fact that the Internet is a medium where people can feel
those things is encouraging."

"There could be something comforting to this, but the process is all too
slow." --Aaron Levy

Handwritten Press is pleased to announce the release of Tombe, by Aaron
Levy.

Unlike previous Handwritten Press books, this chapbook contains an
interview with photographer and poet Aaron Levy by Handwritten Press editor
Kristen Gallagher.  Nine of the photographs being discussed are reproduced
throughout.  These photographs engage with a particular post-industrial
ruin during the last days of its life before being "salvaged."  Ruins such
as these are indeed all around us.  Levy's photographs bring a new kind of
attention to the ruin, calling forth its anamonumental status as forgotten
archive and signifier of cultural memory loss.  Al Filreis put it this way
about Tombe: "The pictures of a ruin - familiar yet unclear - are enacting
a process of perceptual dementia; at a certain point a central room,
especially when printed in color and taking on a rosy-yellow Sabbath eve
glow, looks ever so much like a synagogue. (A fuzzy analogical mneumonic:
think Hungary 1944 projected onto any contemporary eastern American city.)"


In forgetting to take the ruin for granted, these photographs bring an
almost religious light into the darkness found there, and through that
indicate an inability to truly see the archive or retrieve the life found
there.  Louis Cabri describes Levy's work here in terms of the artist's
imperative to breach and realize limits: "In the relations and interstices
between logos and image, the real erupts as a command: tombe (fall)! We
fall, at once into the real, seduced, and away, repelled. 'Art' and 'life'
fail us, yet in doing so, conceptualize their limit." Jean-Michel Rabate
receives this same conflicted command as an invitation: "following Aaron
Levy's lead, let us free fall into the paradoxical grammar of death and
reach into the gaps and crevices of the allegorical landscape it deploys.
These singularly performative fault lines provide the visual equivalent of
Antonin Artaud's inner 'focal collapse', an 'essential and fugitive erosion
in thought' ... the unthinkable dark room of a thought from which we are
trying to awake."

29 pp., 9 full color reproductions of photographs, handmade w/ velour paper
cover, hardware bindings, $12.50.

    I missed the double-header of Amiri Baraka and Jane Cortez doing the Vision Festival at the Knitting Factory becaue I was home watching the Met game. But reports have reached me that it was the same ole tired inimitading act. The audience at 20 bucks per pop was 95 per cent white and the stray African American must have made a wrong left turn somewhere.

    Ms Cortez was loud and energetic...the 4 piece band including her son played back ground...'cause as is known...the message is... which the white audience ate it up...esp. poems they could understand...women is etc adj verb etc ad infinitum...man is adj verb etc ad infinitum...the audience which could actually get 'this stuff"... 41 bullets 41 bullets onebyone...bang bang...bang BANG...

    Mr. Baraka let the band actually play...he left the 'jew landlord stuff back in Newark..& with the petculiar hatred of the career civil servant...whose money in fully invested in the Stock market by NY State..let loose the East German rants of his youth...

    This is not the poetry of Kobe Bryant, Jerry Rice, the sec. of state, the national sec. advisor, the African-American woman just engineering grad of Cornell, the genuis Afro-A internet hacker, the hordes of A-A hampshire oberlin reed usc ucla strivers..this is minstrely for white folk..doo wop done again and again...it's time to retire these acts..& let 'em play the Euro festival trash circuit where Anti-Americanism still has its gone good name...and real bucks can be made off it.....Drn...

Got this response:

Wayne Dodd has previously made public apologies for that reading.
Do we really have to disgrace Ohio, yet again, by discussing the
particulars in public?

It's about as bad as the Devo scandal.

---------------------------------
To which I MUST respond:

        Wayne assures me that there WAS no DEVO scandal, it was just
some PhD dissertation on OVID that went, well, horribly awry. That's
all he'd say. Promise. Except to extend his condolences to the poor
David Baratier who's had to contend with that line for all these
moons.
        Gads, one can only imagine . . .

Richard,

As Aldon quotes Richard Kelly as saying, to be boring is a right some poets
feel they have as poets (Kelly's words, "a certain sort of boredom could be
of value.")

The comment I referred to was directly made to me by Charles Bernstein many
years ago at the Poetry Project in relation to someone who was reading that
day (I don't remember who the person was). Charles himself may or may not
remember the event. I don't think it is an idea (the right to be boring, the
value of boredom, etc.) he would disagree with though I can't talk for him.

It is not an idea that I don't understand (the idea is not the same as
different people finding different writers boring); I just utterly disagree
with it. To me, pleasure it is at the heart of reading or writing, a true
test.

Murat

Subject:      source of Perelman quotation?
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII

I'm trying to find the original appearance of the following quotation by
Bob Perelman - anyone know where this is from?:

"This writing does not concern itself with narrative in the conventional
sense.  Story, plot, any action outside the syntactic and tonal actions of
the words is seen as secondary...Persona, Personism, the poet as trace of
the poet-demiurge-these, too, are now extraneous."

If you do know the source, please backchannel to dkane@panix.com.  Thanks
in advance.

COME ONE, COME ALL & PLEASE HELP SPREAD THE WORD!
Two FREE Lapis Magazine Evenings at The New York Open Center, 83 Spring
Street, NYC, 212 219 2527. With host, Contributing Editor JP Harpignies

I New Dimensions in the Corporate Manipulation of the Arts With Natalie
Jeremijenko, Jacqueline Stevens, & Christina Cobb

Corporate appropriation of art and popular culture to sell products is
nothing new, but two recent, very high-profile shows, "Paradise Now:
Picturing the Genetic Revolution," and "Perfecting Mankind: Eugenics and
Photography," as well as several other exhibitions and events, highlight a
new level of sophisticated, covert campaigns to further corporate agendas
using the arts. How can artists, activists and informed citizens respond to
these extremely subtle, stealth propaganda methods? And how can we strive
for integrity and clarity in a society which commodifies every aspect of
life? Join some artists, scholars and activists as we explore these
difficult questions.

II Inner Cultivation & Outer Engagement
With Charmaine Crockett, Yasmine Sherif, Sally Fisher, and Jonathan Granoff

One of Lapis magazine's core missions is to provide a forum where
"real-world" environmental and societal issues and the cultivation of the
inner spiritual dimensions are viewed as equally relevant to contemporary
life. And certainly in many cases an inner spiritual equilibrium or
grounding in a faith lead to "right action" in the world. But these two
impulses are often also at odds, both in the larger culture and within
individuals. Some religious and esoteric teachings can encourage withdrawal
rather than engagement, or can promote reactionary and authoritarian
movements. Join us for a lively exploration of the delicate relationship of
the spiritual and the socio-political in modern life.

-----Original Message-----
From: kent johnson [mailto:kljohnson45@hotmail.com]

Claudia Keelan, in new Fence (#8), leads off her notational essay "An Ethics
of Practice: Reading and Writing Spiritual Utility" with the following quote
from Keats: "A poet is the most unpoetical of anything because he has no
identity-- he is continually in for-- and filling some other body..." She
expalins in a footnote that it is this Keatsian spirit which the
"avant-garde" extends, as opposed to those poets of the Self, who, following
Wordsworth, promenade themselves "under a banner named authenticity." Those
poets who laudably follow in Keats's step see, according to Keelan, "No self
but in other. No poem but in the destruction of the poem by the reader whose
reading makes a new exchange."

So my "question": If this is so, why is it that there is such a dearth of
*actual experiment* in forms and unfoldings of "poetic identity"? Why is it
that even the most radical textual "experiment" seems to bring itself up
short at the inner threshold of the legal self and its name, the latter
always stamped, without a thought, onto the poem, so that any "new exchange"
is, ipso facto, a transaction restrained within the bounds of a delimited
cultural economy, the very coin of which instantiates and guarantees a value
to the Self *vis a vis* the Other?

That's not to say that ethics are any less relevant or true within habitual
and protocoled arrangements; but might there be an *ethical
poetic praxis* yet waiting to be explored beyond the limen of
conventionalized Authorship? Might tentative, speculative moves in such
direction today tend to readily be given the stigma of 'hoax', 'fraud',
'fake', 'forgery' in great part *because* of the comfort of habit and safety
of protocol?

There is indeed such a shortage because the discussion and explanation of
the subject is reduced to an oppositional dyad in traditional
English-speaking intellectual culture.  Poetry, however, should not take
sides (yes I am using this as a criteria for judgment).  The poetry is in
the third thing, the unseen, the that-which-is-of-keats-but-not-of-keats,
that-which-is-wordsworth-but-not-of-wordsworth: the notion that, well,
selves may or may not exist.  the notion that we just have no fucking idea
whether selves are real or essential, the notion that we cannot answer the
question, the notion that, as far as poetry should be concerned, the
question itself is the answer.  contradiction, manifest repugnance,
ambiguity, paradox, agnosticism:  the poetic space of self rests in these
worlds that push and possibly exhaust the very possibilities of language.
but then, isn't poetry supposed to do just that: push and possibly exhaust
the very possibilities of language?

to quote from Eliot (this quote isn't strictly about Jesus, I assure you):

Who is the third who walks always beside you?
When I count, there are only you and I together
But when I look ahead up the white road
There is always another one walking beside you
Gliding wrapt in a brown mantle, hooded
I do not know whether a man or a woman
—But who is that on the other side of you?

neither side of the *traditional* oppositional dyad exhausts the
possibilities of self, neither side is inspired, neither side is radical.
it is when the agnostic/ambiguous space of the self in poetry, this third
that walks besides us, is expressed, when the question itself is made the
answer cast into poetry, that radical possibilities open.  sadly, we have
not seen such wisdom in poetry frequently.  but when we do, it is, at least
to me, incredible, beautiful, chilling, inspiring.  such poetry has
something special that is rare but beautiful.  To me.

I will give three examples that are an inspiration:
Araki Yasusada's _Doubled Flowering_
Barry MacSweeney's _Pearl_ and "I am Lucifer" from _Postcards from Hitler_.

Both of the above works from MacSweeney capture the ambiguity and
contradictory nature of self without rejecting the possibility that the self
does exist in a way different from _DF_.  In both of MacSweeney's works, the
narrator IS and IS NOT the author, IS and IS NOT the subject (crucially) of
the poem.  "I am Lucifer" the poem reads repetitively, but who is the "I"?
Is it Lucifer?  Is it Barry?  Are Barry and Lucifer the same?  They are the
same, then they are not, back and forth.  MacSweeney's works capture a more
aesthetic end of such notions but they do fall short of realizing the role
of language, books, and authors in the world.  The book, after all, is still
Barry's.  Whereas _DF_ has the very issue of its own reality perfectly
realized and is like an onion that may not have a center.  And perhaps it,
like all literature, does NOT have a center.  Perhaps it does.  The
important aspects are: NOT knowing, maintaining the wonder, the questioning,
the search, the fascination of self and with that fascination, all of its
paradoxes, complexities, confusions, tensions, contradictions, and
ambiguities.

Murat. I agree that pleasure of reading is largely,  but not
totally,primary; but by boring Kelly may have meant that certain poetic
devices work to counteract what is conventionsally a lush or "invigorating"
poem: i think that most poets of whatever ilk would be with you against
boredom...it sounds to me that C.B. probably threw that one out...but in
reading A Poetics which I am finding very interesting he talks about
absorptive versus anti-absorptive "attacks" or tactics ...which he (as far
as I can tell) enjoys as a method so that his work (or others maybe) will
have say rhyme one minute,be boredom the next, lyricism the next...a mix of
"texts" etc and these modulate so that the work encountered by a potential
reader is neither too facile nor so opaque that it either becomes tedious by
its very "beauty" (too mellifluous..."drowns the sense in odours"... to
quote Eliot - whom C B doesnt quote by the way) ... and also counteracts the
"numbing" effect. So writing in a "plain and dull" style for a few passages
might assist in the object of poetry that is like  a swoon except that it
brings one to one's senses. (to semi quote CB's The Klupzy Girl or from
that) I think it does depend somwhat on who one is and even when one is
reading a text (poem or whatever): to compare it to music...I was just
listening to Ligeti who is quite "avante garde" (correct spelling?) but
although I  enjoyed that and it was a good contrast to a lot of Bach I'd
been listening to..and I taped it...I'll probably go back to Bach and not
replay it for  a while...there was a time when I listened to Bob Marley for
hours and so on. I think this poetry making is never as simple as your
implied pleasure: that pleasure varies from reader to reader and writer to
writer.
  Your "true test" sounds suspiciously as if you hankered after something
"rousing" like Hiawatha or something "straight from the heart" like
something by Ella Wheeler Wilcox, or Keats who'se good but how much Keats
can you read? The worst poetry is the pseudo poetic stuff that gets into
mainstream mags: if one has to "work" a bit on a poet then that's also a
kind of pleasure. Also boring may be vailid in that to sidestep "boring"
you're sidestepping "reality"...difficult as that thing is to pin down. Life
is very often boring (or we think it is or make it so)(but it is an
experience or hasbeen "mentioned in despatches" as being so). You say "a
true test"...but why should it be a test? Whose marking? The test I think is
the originality, intelligence,emotive qualities sound and so on all
combined: whether it works on and worrys at the reader. Pleasure isnt good
enough on its own. Some hard "yakka" before you get your pudding I say.
Regards, Richard.

Nudel,

I can't believe you are doing this again!

Why are you wasting your, my, & everyone else's time
sending such drivel??  I'd like to see instead your
_real_ anti-anti-imperialist (or anti-racist, anti-liberal, or anti-whatever
agenda), rather than taking swipes at people who are actively doing
something to provoke a changes in thinking & perhaps even promoting a
cultural renaissance.

After last year's despicable account on the
Baraka / Cecil Taylor reading, you have the nerve
to report on a reading you didn't even go to again??

I'm sorry to say that the reports that reached
you were WAY off the mark. The readings by Cortez
and Baraka on Saturday night were incredible, really potent,
as I'm sure any a/v documentation would demonstrate.
Both poets performed with excellent bands, completely tight,
and at the top of their game. The poetry all the way around was
extraordinary. And the audience was hardly 95% white.  The SRO crowd
included great scholars (Fred Moten, Brent Edwards, Alan Gilbert),
artists, (including dj Spooky & many other musicians, Eliot Katz) ETC ETC.
Your accounters could not have presented you with more misinformation.

I don't have time to do a full analysis of the gig, which
also included Daniel Berrigan, Other Dimensions in Music,
Raphe Malik, and others.  Jayne Cortez was absolutely radiant, her band
sharp, & message righteous. But since you again diss on Baraka
so badly, I'd like to write a few sentences because I had a
totally different perspective on it than you (esp. cause I was there),
& think he's still an important voice.

The band (Blue Ark): Amina Baraka (voc.), D.D. Jackson (piano), Wilber
Morris (bass), Pheeroan Ak-Laff (drums), Herbie Morgan (sax), Dwight
West (voc.).  They played an hour set that never dragged, an arc of word and
music that effectively and overtly set up a thoughtful dialect between MLK &
X, with the history of the "railroad at the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean
made of human bones" as the overall backdrop. Not some kind of retro thing,
either. What you also get is Baraka as preacher/anti-preacher railing
against "A Fake President for a Counterfeit Democracy," & persecutions faced
by all. Mid-set he offered a number of his "lo-ku" poems, including a bunch
of new ones ("for bush II":  "the only problem with you is that you're not
in jail"). the group's stage presence is mature, professional, & baraka
himself himself, hunched over, dropping his
pages all over the stage, shuffling them just right, hitting the
mic right at the right moment. His brother in law Dwight with a
deep deep voice next to him at least 2 feet taller thrusting
fist upward. Amina, soulful in voice &
presence to his other side.  & all of this is poetry of and for his people,
nudel, & for all of us.  you're dead wrong in your last
paragraph; your scouts must have gone to a spike lee movie, or much
worse.  What authority do you have on the subject anyway, & what
are you doing about the problems besides sending us this crap?

& when Baraka says "evil was an experiment," that's poignant & hopeful.  If
it's a vision
on the world, & we can get beyond the experiment, great for us.  i think it
can also be heard apologetically, and one thing Baraka has done steadily in
the
past 20 years is acknowledge earlier misdirections.

anyway, clearly you're down on Baraka, & that's fine but wish
you'd actually engage w/what he's got going on, or with what's
going on it the world rather than ignorantly gripe.

what is your real beef, bro?

    I missed the double-header of Amiri Baraka and Jane Cortez doing the
Vision Festival at the Knitting Factory becaue I was home watching the Met
game. But reports have reached me that it was the same ole tired inimitading
act. The audience at 20 bucks per pop was 95 per cent white and the stray
African American must have made a wrong left turn somewhere.

    Ms Cortez was loud and energetic...the 4 piece band including her son
played back ground...'cause as is known...the message is... which the white
audience ate it up...esp. poems they could understand...women is etc adj
verb etc ad infinitum...man is adj verb etc ad infinitum...the audience
which could actually get 'this stuff"... 41 bullets 41 bullets
onebyone...bang bang...bang BANG...

    Mr. Baraka let the band actually play...he left the 'jew landlord stuff
back in Newark..& with the petculiar hatred of the career civil
servant...whose money in fully invested in the Stock market by NY State..let
loose the East German rants of his youth...

    This is not the poetry of Kobe Bryant, Jerry Rice, the sec. of state,
the national sec. advisor, the African-American woman just engineering grad
of Cornell, the genuis Afro-A internet hacker, the hordes of A-A hampshire
oberlin reed usc ucla strivers..this is minstrely for white folk..doo wop
done again and again...it's time to retire these acts..& let 'em play the
Euro festival trash circuit where Anti-Americanism still has its gone good
name...and real bucks can be made off it.....Drn...

my heart throbs for you
you sail the uncharted seas of distant lands and bleak horizons
you move through mountains and valleys and the darkest forests
my heart yearns for you, my eyes cry for you
your love follows you in your beauty and your long flowing tresses
your love follows your long golden hair and your eyes of deepest blue
my arms dream of you, my legs take me towards you
"for i will follow you until the ends of earth and time
"for i will walk behind thee until mountains fall and valleys rise
my heart, my heart, my eyes, my arms, my legs
your golden voice, the pause in the middle of a word, eyes wide open
eyes wide open and open wider, and eyes wider open, and open wider
my heart throbs for you
"for i dream of you and think of you, your voice whispering on the wind
"for your beauty is deeper than the ocean and your eyes bluer than the sky
my arms long to hold you in my arms, my legs yearn to hold you in my legs
your eyes wide open, your eyes open wider
my heart yearns for you, my crying open eyes

Yes, why would anyone read poetry but for pleasure. Especially the kind of
poetry congenial with the agenda of the Poetics Digest . Yes,  academics
--one of my colleagues says, he finds most contemporary poets exceedingly
boring but feels he has to read some Ezines just to "keep up on things."
The question is simply the old question of what's "pleasure."

Actually, how many people in the world are audience for this poetry/poetics,
just a small  handful. Most of the writing /writers are  compulsive--yes
there's excitement & spurts & perhaps even waves of it,  but in some cases,
no names mentioned, we witness the runs.  One must have compassion for the
dissatisfaction, the dis-ease, the writhing that fills writing.  One MUST
surmise from the words. Much /most writing  serves as reciprocal
masturbation, please, polish my ego, give it some luster, some shine. For
friends to read & critique, read mine, now read mine, read mine.  People
writing for money--eventually know there's none--  then writing for face,
writing for voice, writing to blame, writing for reasons questionable. Who's
saying what's exemplary, fine, the essence of our time ( that was the
orthodox line), can move us  beyond conventional, intellectual horizon of
mind, higher, a bit beyond, ah ha.  Not just more  stimulation, getting off
on agitation, itching a wound.

Me thinks the matter a matter of aesthetics,  actual  experience(not just in
the head) of   higher, subtler, more refined pleasure. Pleasure too is
hierarchical.  Always ready & easy & able to let go  the coarser for the
finer. The generation (the language folk, born too late for  acid, never
knew DMT, to early and too late to meditate),  frogs in a well view of
mind, still projecting  shadows onto  THE world & seeing the  A &  B & C
without  sensuality. Engrossed (to the point of obsession) &  engorged with
ideas and views, never quiet, never  at rest.  Again, a question of what's
best. What's the goal & is there one or, is it  just fresh drivel, just a
queer way to say or to see.

Better me thinks get back in the body, calm and clear  and  expand the mind
& watch, observe quietly what's going on , moment by moment & not  more &
more & more proliferation, fabrication, excitation keeping us spinning &
whirling about, about & about & about & more just about.

Has someone some thing enlightening to say, mind expanding, moving-- at
least the romantics were romantic,  not just running sores of  the  tongue &
mouth.  The fetid breath as poetic presence becomes increasingly
unappealing, students yawn at the thought of poetry, the beats become a bit
boring, the language folk& they're snoring.  Although not repetitive in the
usual sense, you finish reading & you're always asking:  yes, but so what?
So what? Perhaps we can't, shouldn't, needn't ask more from  poetry/poetics,

I'm forwarding this notice for a screening/video-viewing from some of The
Poetry Center's American Poetry Archives videos in Oakland this coming
Sunday, part of the Second Sunday series at the Stork Club.

Steve

=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D
Hi everybody,

Here's a special invitation from Mary and me to join us for the last
Second Sunday of the Spring---

This Sunday, June 10th, we're showing videos from the archives at the
Poetry Center, of (a few of) our heroes, Louis Zukofsky, Frank
O'Hara, Kathy Acker, Alice Notley, and Mei-mei Berssenbrugge.

See---
Zukofsky's fabulous black beetling brows,
O'Hara with a cigarette or was it a typewriter and a charming grin,
Kathy Acker recruiting a young Kit Robinson and Rae Armantrout to say
"fuck" quite a number of times,
Notley in spaghetti straps and the alabaster skin of a 40's film star,
Berssenbrugge just in from the New Mexican desert sands, all long
hair and beatifically shrewd demeanor.

Also, Alex Cory's band Blades of Grass will close out the afternoon
with what may be their only public performance.  Their music, what
I've heard, is Appalachian-inspired, root-fed ballads, with haunting
lyrics by poet Alex.  Perfect for a mid-afternoon, early summer beer.

Hope to see you!
Beth

Vital stats, as ever:

Sunday, June 10 @ 2 p.m.
Admission $2.00.
21 and over only

The Stork Club is in downtown Oakland, 2330 Telegraph Ave between
23rd and 24th St.
By BART: get off at 19th St, walk one block west to Telegraph, then up
about 5 blocks, just past 23rd.  The Stork Club has a large and vivid sign.
(Our printed calendar mistakenly lists two addresses for the club;
2330 Telegraph is correct.)

Subject:      LANGUAGE PROSODY (ex. 3: hypodochmiacs in Susan Howe's "Pierce
              Arrow")
MIME-Version: 1.0

[Slight error in the previous "lesson":  Daley found "vers libre" not in
"Prometheus Bound" as misstated, but in Euripides' "Hercules" (sometimes titled
"The Madness of Hercules" {"Hercules Furens," not to be confused with "The
Children of Hercules" or "Heracleidae"}).]

----------------------------------------

PRELIMINARY INTERJECTION:

Graeco-Roman neo-classicism may have characterized ethnically monolithic
European cultures, such as Racine's France, Holderlin's Germany,
turn-of-the-20th-cent. America.

OFF-SHOOT THOUGHT:

Unsubstantiated generalization: Most first generation Language Poets appear to
have come from single-language (Eng.) "American stock" ethnicities, without the
sort of dual language developmental home environment of 2nd/3rd generation
American families of the Eastern-European or Italian immigration waves(where a
"grandparents'" language was spoken in the home. (With exceptions: Jewishness
may have retained a trace Yiddischkeit.)

---  Hence, perhaps, a certain ~monolingualism~ in '80s/'90s Language Poetry,
and the over-all ~English only~ focus of its Language critique,--- versus, at
least by comparison, the sort of Joyce-Pound polyglot poetry of Modernism.

----------------------------------------

Now, on to the topic: classical meter and Language/"post-Language" poetry.

Susan Howe's '99 book "Pierce Arrow" strikes me as her perhaps most audibly
metrical book.  This may be due to a gradual rhythmic shift in her practice,
over a long career (away from an earlier, more strongly spondee-molossus meter
[ _ _ and _ _ _ ], or the heavy use of quoted material in "Pierce Arrow" that
imbues the surrounding poetry of her own invention with "infectious," un-Howe
cadences).  By ignoring her line-breaks, the rhythms can be read as often
breaking open in long stretches of quite standard iambic/dactylic/trochaic
meter.

There are ample internal references in the book to nominate it as a proof text
for an exploration into contemporary class metrics: the book's strong Hellenism
(from the opening "Phenomenology of war in the Iliad," through Hecuba, Hector,
"fate metes out this and this dactyl", Achilles, Chorus of Thessalonian women,
Thetis, Apollo, Patroclus, etc., etc., etc.).

One of the first, easiest observations is whether a line ~starts~ with a
"rising" or "falling" rhythm, based mainly on whether the first syllable is
stressed or unstressed.

As a starting point:

One of the first verse-length metrical units that "jumped out at me" on reading
is a particular, irregular 5-syllable line: / _ / _ /.  By potentially being
alternately catalectic (no tail, missing a final short) or acephalous
("headless," missing an initial short), it is ambiguated and cannot in and of
itself be read as either iambic or trochaic.  (See below for further
definitions of / _ / _ / as hypodochmiac.)

hi maria.
hi all

i have a few problems.

the avant-gardes of the early 1900s were against an establishment.
the establishment was government, the academy and professors.
the l=a=n=g=u=a=g=e poets were an avant-garde of the seventies, also
often contrary to the government, professors and academy, but working
within that establishment as students.
many of the l=a=n=g=u=a=g=e poets of the seventies are now professors.
at e-poetry and dac 2001 it seemed that an e-poetry avant-garde is
being led by professors. does this make the student body the
establishment?
does this mean that the avant-garde of the early 2000s has become the
establishment?
or is the academy split into establishment and avant-garde?

if so, has literature become a wholly academic issue totally internal
to the academy?

and does it mean it will disappear up its own arsehole?





is the article on eileen just the awakening of some young journalist,
unaware of the history and existence of a 'performance
poetry/non-mainstream scene'?

1...Creativity Workshop: General Information

We are all born creative, curious and imaginative but these qualities
sometimes fade with the passage of time. The Creativity Workshop's goal
is to help people get their imaginations back. Find your particular way
of expression and break through the fears associated with creation.
This internationally renowned intensive workshop brings together people
of all backgrounds, cultures, and interests to discover new and
exciting tools for generating creativity and thinking and working in
new and exciting ways.

Process not Product
The Creativity Workshop is for anyone interested in expanding their
creative potential. The workshop is attended by educators, artists,
business executives, writers, lawyers, doctors, homemakers, advertising
and design people--all with the common goal of experimenting with their
imaginations and finding new ways to stimulate and expand their
creative potential. Shelley Berc and Alejandro Fogel have developed a
series of exercises designed to help participants develop and recognize
their individual creative processes. Participants explore different
artistic materials and mediums in order to discover their own unique
ways of expression and to learn to break through the fears and
distractions that inhibit creativity.

Tools for a Lifetime
The exercises used in the Creativity Workshop are intended to become
the tools for a lifetime of creative expression. Participants are
encouraged to draw from all kinds of resources of creativity -such as
the oral tradition, dreams, childhood memories, sense perceptions and
intuition. Working both individually and in collaborative groups,
participants explore their imaginative potential through exercises in
writing, drawing, collage, map making, story telling and guided
visualization.

4...What people say about the Creativity Workshop

"The new millennium needs bold, creative men and women who can turn
their dreams into reality... Shelley Berc and Alejandro Fogel show how
you can do this through their challenging and inspiring creativity
workshops...even a simple first contact will prove what these two
talented teachers can do for your own gifts." Dr. Kirpal Singh, Writer,
Professor, Singapore Management University.

"The Creativity Workshop in Spoleto has been a very special experience
for me. It opened up new ways to look at my work and I found new
friendships. I spent 15 fantastic days in an incredible place. Shelley
and Alejandro are superb teachers!" Vera Eisenberg, painter, Argentina

"The Workshop was such a powerful experience for me, something I never
expected nor would I ever be able to repeat it." Rolfe Werner,
Engineer. Canberra, Australia.

"I found the workshop extremely valuable in generating awareness of my
creativity and in stimulating ideas." Jeanne Arthur, Executive Officer,
ACT Board of Secondary School Studies. Canberra, Australia.

"I feel as though I now have a focus, a method, a way of evolving my
ideas and that the means are just as important as the end. I have
created environments just to create in, and environments just to
display the work in. My vision of attending to each detail, sound,
smell, texture, substance... is starting to find a home. Thanks for
opening my eyes to these essential aspects of creating through your
guidance and example." Student. University of Iowa, Iowa City, USA.

"This class was THE MOST enriching, enlightening, inspirational class I
have ever taken. The way I work and what I create will never be the
same." Student. University of Iowa, USA.

"Shelley and Alejandro's Creativity Workshop is amazing in that it
breaks down all your fears about thinking and writing. If it wasn't for
them I fear I never would have finished my master's thesis. I was
blocked until I took this course." Francesca Salidu PHD candidate in
Shakespeare, University of Pisa. San Miniato, Italy.

"Shelley Berc and Alejandro Fogel taught their Creativity Workshop as
American Cultural Specialists under the United States Information
Service auspices. To say that they were extremely effective is a vast
understatement. I would unreservedly recommend their course. They have
abundant creativity, energy, and a wealth of skills." Gloria Berbena,
Asst. Cultural Attaché, US Information Service, US Embassy. Rome,
Italy.

"A special experience. Berc and Fogel opened us up to new and wonderful
ways of looking at our creativity." Belkis Bottfeld, PHD, psychologist.
Istanbul, Turkey.

"An unforgettable course!" Gulnur Ayaz, MD. Istanbul, Turkey.
----------------------------------------------------------------------

5...The teachers

Shelley Berc is a writer and teacher. She is a professor of the
International Writing Program at the University of Iowa. Her novels,
plays, and essays which include 'The Shape of Wilderness', 'A Girl's
Guide to the Divine Comedy' and 'Theatre of the Mind' have been
published by Coffee House Press, Johns Hopkins Press, Heinemann Books,
Performing Arts Journal and Theatre Communications Group Press. Her
plays have been produced by theatres such as the American Repertory
Theatre, the Yale Rep, and the Edinburgh Festival.

Alejandro Fogel is a visual artist and teacher working in painting,
site installations, video and digital art. He has exhibited his works
in galleries and museums in Argentina, Bulgaria, Cuba, France, Hungary,
Israel, Italy, Netherlands, Spain, United States and Germany. His
ongoing project 'Root to Route' chronicles his father's journey through
the Holocaust years. His work is in private collections and museums
around the world.

Berc and Fogel explain in theory and demonstrate in practice the
concepts of originality, 'appropriation', memory and imagination. Under
their guidance, participants explore their own creative processes
through different writing and drawing exercises. They emphasize the
intimate link between personal and public spheres, individual and
social practices, history and myth, dream and reality. The focus of the
workshop is on process not product and to help participants find
life-long tools of creative expression. Shelley Berc and Alejandro
Fogel have taught their Creativity Workshop internationally. They have
lectured on creativity and their own work at universities and cultural
centers throughout the world. They currently teach the Creativity
Workshop as an intensive semester long course at the International
Writing Program of The University of Iowa.

This has to be bout the most bizarre posting I've ever read on this list --
Nobody who has actually read Jayne Cortez's works or heard recordings of
her with musicians will recognize the hateful portrayal below -- And,
having sat not all that long ago in a room at Howard University filled with
a mostly black audience from all over the city, I can testify that Mr.
Nudel's rather condescending effort to speak on behalf of the "real?" black
audience misses the mark by a couple of continents -- What the hell is
motivating this???????

Nudel,

I respectfully second Mr. Funkhouser's comments...
though I was in Baltimore at the time,
I've seen Baraka oft before, and CF rings true....

excuse the promotion but...

rOlling COMBers -- John M Bennett
        $14 / 200p

just a note to say that Potes & Poets Press has just published rOlling
COMBers by John M Bennett. Mr Bennett is an iconoclast. his work has been
called concrete poetry but that term, like the term language poetry (which
might apply to Bennett's work as well), seems merely limiting at this point.
leave it to
say that the work here utilizes different fonts and typography as well as
John's unique
hieroglyphic to produce an almost 3-dimensional effect. crosscurrents of
sound and sight combine with 'meaning', whatever that might be, upon the
playground called Poetry. the effect is rare, rich and exhilarating. John's
work is seen all over in print magazines and on line, but the Derby distance
of this book (some 200 pages) provides a terrific, even exalting, momentum.
one can take an absolutely giddy reading from this work, an excitement of
language at work and play. best of all, this work is purchasable, via:

www.potespoets.org

or use a stamp and send to: Potes &Poets World Headquarters at

I suppose this means that the only poetry Mr. Reuven finds pleasurable is the
poetry congenial with the Poetics Digest agenda. Otherwise, I don't know
where he got the idea from my words.

Twelve Possible Reasons For Reading Poetry Other than Pleasure
(whether aloud or quietly to myself)

1.   I read poetry out of habit.

2.   I read poetry out of an unconscious need for suffering.

3.   I read poetry because I feel I must force myself to see other ways of
writing, of saying.

4.   I read poetry because my eyes are bored and they need something to do.

5.   I read poetry to annoy other people.

6.   I read poetry because *flash* there it is, I've read it without
thinking about it, without reason.

7.   I read poetry to resurrect dead friends.

8.   I read poetry because language is a virus and I've been infected.

9.   I read poetry to stroke another person's ego.

10.  I read poetry to do favors for others.

11.  I read poetry to get pissed off or disappointed.

12.  I read poetry to become invigorated (which is not the same thing as
pleasure).


Being a poetry editor, for one, is one way a person would read poetry for
reasons other than pleasure.  I'm sure many editors suffer through much of
their submissions.

My point here is that there is so much of what we do has "no reason" or no
conscious propagation; some of us just end up reading it.  I'm obviously
reluctant to admit poetry is some sort of hedonistic enterprise.

For me, poetry is just way too complicated a thing for me to find one
central root, one core reason, for reading it.

Unknowing you may be sleeping in dreams unowned.

Thanks,
Patrick

Doesn't "The performance/non mainstream scene" become mainstream by virtue
of its existence and history?  Doesn't everything overtime "regularize"
itself, and isn't that regularization simply an outcome of the consumer
culture that even poetry belongs to?  Maxine Chernoff

I am sorry for the delayed reply. You quoted me wrongly. I did not say

reader) is a right of the poet. Well, I don't think so.

Let's not forget Frank O'Hara who insisted that poetry should be at least as

he liked his poetry with a dash of glamour.  Best, Bill

Please excuse the blatant self-promotion, but I wanted to make my
Buffalo friends aware that my interview on WBFO's Spoken Arts Radio with
Mary Van Vorst will be broadcast this week, at three times: Thursday
morning, June 14, at 6:30 am and 8:35 am, and Sunday, June 17, at 8:35
am.  The interviewed was taped a couple of weeks ago, and I discussed my
book, Endorsed by Jack Chapeau, and tangential issues -- language,
sentences, politics, the Gulf War & the late Timothy McVeigh, etc.  WBFO
is 88.7 FM in Buffalo.

If you never want me to tell you anything like this again, please reply
with the subject line Go Away.  Some recipients in the past have
complained that writing Go Away Loser in the subject line stimulates a
flurry of unintelligible responses, many of which verge on invective.  I
regret this, but cannot be held reponsible for the sensitive nature of
my automatic response program.

 hi kominos
 hi all
       I can understand you have problems. you need more history, or memory.
For instance,the avant-garde wasn't against an establishment.
i can remember when establishments began--it was sometime in the 1960s.
about the same time as modernism came along. and if there had been an
establishment in the 1900s it wasn't the one you describe, but one which the
church, the class system,had a part to play. L= poets in the 70s were
getting a formal education and getting a job like everyone else in their
generation, i don't call that 'working within the establishment as
students'. i'm comfortable about their being an avant-garde circa 1900-1910,
but not with there being one circa 2000-2010. change happens. Though
arseholes are forever.
             wystan

hi maria.
hi all

i have a few problems.

the avant-gardes of the early 1900s were against an establishment.
the establishment was government, the academy and professors.
the l=a=n=g=u=a=g=e poets were an avant-garde of the seventies, also
often contrary to the government, professors and academy, but working
within that establishment as students.
many of the l=a=n=g=u=a=g=e poets of the seventies are now professors.
at e-poetry and dac 2001 it seemed that an e-poetry avant-garde is
being led by professors. does this make the student body the
establishment?
does this mean that the avant-garde of the early 2000s has become the
establishment?
or is the academy split into establishment and avant-garde?

if so, has literature become a wholly academic issue totally internal
to the academy?

and does it mean it will disappear up its own arsehole?





is the article on eileen just the awakening of some young journalist,
unaware of the history and existence of a 'performance
poetry/non-mainstream scene'?

Many readers of this list knew or knew of Ramez Qureshi, critic and poet,
who died in March of this year. Ramez and I corresponded quite a bit by
email, during and after the period he was working on a review of my book
"Theoretical Objects". Ramez was an engaging and challenging writer who
could openly express support and enthusiasm,  yet hold strongly to his own
convictions, questioning facile stances and categorizations. Despite the
fact that I knew him all too briefly, he will be greatly missed. Some of
these complex aspects of his thinking and personality came into play, I
feel, in the course our correspondence, which is now available, virtually
unedited, at the Electronic Poetry Center. A bibliography of some of his
writing, along with URLS, is available also at the EPC, in the latest issue
of Read Me. My thanks to Loss Pequeno Glazier for his generous work on this
project.

"This writing does not concern itself with narrative in the conventional
sense.  Story, plot, any action outside the syntactic and tonal actions
of
the words is seen as secondary...Persona, Personism, the poet as trace
of
the poet-demiurge-these, too, are now extraneous."

Dear Daniel Kane,

I know I'm supposed to be the horse's mouth in this particular case, but
I don't know where this is from. I looked through my computer files, but
couldn't find it. It's probably from the mid-70s, one of my stiff
baby-steps toward criticism. Best-case scenario, "This writing" refers
to some particular anti-narrativist gesture. But if it's read as a
characterization of Language Writing, it's reductive, useless. Nothing
is "now" "extraneous" in writing. Unilinear avant-garde time, where the
activity of every reader and writer is inexorably cicumscribed by some
Absolute Poetic Zeitgest--I've been against such a notion for quite
awhile.

                       IS THERE A CLASSICIST IN THE HOUSE?


". . . It would have
been a mistake however
to cast the sonnets in
the same metrical mode
as Shakespeare's
Christmas 1898 -- T.W.-D."

           -- Susan Howe, "Pierce Arrow"

-----------------------------------------------------------------


Sorry for the earlier interruption.

To continue this start along the same lines,--- I'll carry on with this
initial presentation of the raw empirical observations first, and only
then move back in on them to critique-theorize afterwards and
incidentally.


After these readily audible "hypodochmiacs" (previous posting), another
recurring classical meter line throughout the book (Susan Howe's "Pierce
Arrow"):

the adonic ( / _ _ / / ).

The adonic may currently be the most popularly familiar classical meter,
as it is the concluding, short verse of Sapphic stanzas (and Sapphics
have been greatly popularized and appear among widespread schools of
poetry, owing perhaps to their easy recognizability).

Howe:

Buckling his seat belt    (p.49)**
Where are my damn boots    (54)*
consciousness grows dim    (57)*
Often as black ice         (78)*
world in its first three   (87)
air but she did not        (103)~
gathered no blind threat   (134)~


( * ends stanza; ** begins stanza: Verses beginning or ending stanzas
are given greater emphasis and, in the case of the adonic, end of stanza
is its appropriate location viz.-a-viz. Sapphics.)

On p. 86, adonic and hypodochmiac appear back to back:

world in its first three
paragraphs the Sixth


[NOTE: (1) I generally leave out of these analyses all the books' pages
of prose, pp. 5 - 24 and 116f, and the stanzas on pp. 33f, 36, 38, 40-4,
48, 50f, 53f, 56, 60f, 66f, 71, 73, 75-8, 80f, 83f, 86, 84,
96-100,105-9, 111f, 120-6, which I find to be closer to the prose pages
in their style, discursivity, grammar/syntax, and diction.  They do not
sound characteristically "Howe," at least by the model of her earlier
books. (AND I left out the seven-verse dedication that appears
unpaginated prior to the table of contents--- ~because I neglected to
notice it until now!~) (2)  The weight of certain syllables of course
becomes ambiguous depending on the cadence of the surrounding
absolute-value accents,--- principally some connective one-syllable
words, pronouns, prepositions, such as "your," "who," "is," "of," etc. I
tend to read secondary stresses as full stresses/long syllables.]


Aside from these two rhythms (the hypodochmiac and adonic), all the
pentasyllables (five-syl. lines) in "Pierce Arrow" conform to similar
regularity by proving classifiable into a small number of meters, for
the time being left unnamed (catalog proceeds from stessed to
unstressed, as a rule).

[IMPORTANT NEW CONCEPT: THE SYLLABA ANCEPS.  Omitted or lost from "New
Formalist"-style metrics is a pivotal feature of classical meter, the
"syllaba anceps."  Syllaba anceps was where designated syllables in
certain fixed line-meters could legitimately be ~written~ as either long
or short (examples to follow in future summer "lessons"). --- Applying
that concept to this reading of post-modern/Modernist metrics, it allows
near-identical rhythms to be read as alternative versions of the same
meter, and greatly streamlines the scope of the taxonomic results.
Syllaba anceps are marked "X," rather than "_" or "/". --- Also, by
applying the prerogative of syllaba anceps, it allows certain lines that
are similar to hypodochmiacs/adonics to be read as such, and it expands
the evidence of their presence and use, from the list of seven (above)
to seventeen: (below) the three lines under / _ / / / and four lines
under / _ / _ _ as hypodochmiacs, and the three lines under / _ _ / _ as
adonics, where hypodochmiacs/adonics would be understood as / _ / X X
and / _ _ / X, respectively.  (Such analytical practices are also a part
of traditional, "New Formalist" readings: a spondee can substitute for
an iamb, etc.)]

{ ~ = contains one or two ambiguous accents }

* an important line, as it the full passage is: "he had written Mary
Ellen's / name and an inscription / in Greek "Earthly love is / soon
forgetful/the heavenly / remembers always---".  The English (and Howe's
poetry), then, is a second- or third-level translation-transparency over
some originally Greek meter.

Similarly, "ruin, lust, lechery ~humanum est / errare~ Patroclus' armor
three times" (p. 28): as in Pound's verse or any such English poetry
incorporating foreign languages, those insets confound any metrical
scheme,--- here by mixing a language of quantitative meter (Latin) into
qualitative English.  The tendency is to read "humanum est / errare" as
"hu-MA-num EST / er-RA-re", but "er-" is a long syllable in Latin by
virtue of preceding double consonants, etc.


----------------------------------------------

MORE ON HYPODOCHMIACS:

One of the elements in "Pierce Arrow" confirming the presence of
hypodochmiacs, I found, was a single word in the line "Bottom's other
monopolylogue" (p. 62).  "(M)onopolylogue" is accented as a
hypodochmiac.  ---  Elsewhere, the verse "Mirror-impulse ask Fortinbras"
(p. 95), / _ / _ / / _ / , would be unanalyzable without the
hypodochmiac as a "foot" (T2.S.I: trochaic dimeter, spondee, iamb?
T2._.cret: trochaic dim., _ , cretic (/ _ /)?? even assuming a
"swallowed," sprung-rhythm beat after "ask" still leaves the verse as
acatalectic or acephalous, neither clearly iambic or trochaic; etc.). It
is analyzable as hypodochmiac-cretic.  --- (Likewise {upcoming summer
"lesson"}, that the book-length poem establishes its preliminary rhythms
with the prominence and prevalence of four-syllable _ / _ _ English
words such as such "Mortality," "humanity," "interpretant,"  etc., and
four-syl. _ _ / _ words and names such as "Iliadic," "Polydorus," and so
on, also promotes a 2nd/3rd epitrite analysis of the meter in a way that
solves unanalyzables.)

----------------------------------------------

HYPOTHESIS: Metrical analyses of XXth cent. poetry failed to explain or
systematize so-called "free verse" because it relied upon a deceptive
convention (the "New Formalist" tradition) of metrical analysis based on
disyllable and trisyllables: iambs-trochees ( _ / and / _ ) and
anapest-dactyl ( _ _ / and / _ _ ).

"Free verse" yields to discernible patternings when the standard of
measure is expanded from di-/trisyllable to tetrasyllable.

(As was the case in classical meter: there never did exist and ~could~
not exist any such thing as "iambic pentameter" in classical poetry, as
its uneven count was unallowable.)

A yardstick measuring by groupings that are a minimum of ~four~
syllables can explain the meter of free verse.

I Said Coffee



I said coffee
I didn't say,
"would you
like to cup
my warm
soft breasts
in your
un-calloused,
long,
tapered,
ring less fingered
hands?"

I said coffee
I didn't say,
"would you
like to
run your tongue
along my neck
just below
my left ear-lobe?"

I said coffee
I didn't say,
"would you
like to
hold me
in your arms
and feel my heart
skip beats
as you press your
hard body
up against mine
until I melt
into you
with desire?"

I said coffee
as we stood there
in the jasmine
scented night
my car door
like some modern day
bundling board
separating us,
protecting us
from ourselves
and lust

I said,
"would you

a cup of coffee?"
I didn't say,
"would you
like to brush
your lips
across mine
as you move
silently
to bury your face
in my long, silky,
raven black hair?"

But you said,
"I can't
I'm married
I can't trust myself
to be alone
with you."
So I looked you
dead in the eye
and repeated
"I said coffee"

List subscribership by country as of this afternoon.

Caveat Lector: The accuracy of these statistics, with regard
to the number of countries represented, is suspect, given that
the Listserv program assumes all addresses that lack a country
code (e.g., "nz" for New Zealand) are resident U.S. addresses -
a fact particularly relevant given the current prominence of
web-based email.

Hmmmmmmmmmmm.

How is being critical of posts one finds offensive hampering?

These (Nudel's) have never struck me as creative posts.
And since no one ever responds to them either in support or in dissent, they
just seem to dangle out there.
I think Chris' response was intelligent and detailed.
If these posts of DrN's are creative ones, I think we all would enjoy some
details respecting their foundation.
And the tsk tsk comment regarding the misquote below just appears silly and
ineffective in its dismissal of Mr. Funkhouser's letter.  What does that
have to do with either objection?  Perhaps you could provide us with details
concerning the creative content of these posts.  Maybe they are the work of
sheer persona.  Unfortunately, up to this point these emails have seemed
nothing more than bellicose and aggressive.  And in fact, I think most
people simply ignore them because they feel as if they are just pokes at
poets in hopes of getting attention.  But maybe I've missed the point
entirely.  I certainly would like to be enlightened.

Makes me a little leery of submitting!!

By the way, what is the status of the Nation as a poetry venue?  Still taken

Patrick,

When one says that they do anything  for  a*n*y  single reason there's
always an exception, sure, nothing's that simple and someone with a quick
wit can point to that exception & you have. However, I hope there's tongue
in check in the twelve reasons you note for reading poetry other then
pleasure ( you say you're "reluctant to admit poetry is some sort of
hedonistic enterprise" & why the reluctance?)

Out of habit. Out of an unconscious need for suffering(perhaps). Because I
feel I must force myself to see other ways of writing. Because my eyes are
bored and they need something to do. To annoy other people. Because *flash*
there it is, I've read it without thinking about it, without reason (seems
du*b, might as well watch the gluetube). To annoy other people (perhaps your
worst  reason/motive; no reason to hurt or harm others, surely there's
tongue in check here, an attempt at humor).  Because language is a virus and
I've been infected ( surely affectation, not you being true, just cute, no?
you really mean it,  fine then there's not much I can say except be happy. &
this comment  holds true for most of your remaining 12 reasons. To stroke
another person's ego. To get pissed off or disappointed.

 Maybe I'm out of it, and maybe people nowadays read for such reasons , but
are they REALLY good reasons & if not I'd say give them up, change your
habit, get better habits. At least  a  tad of  higher pleasures:-) Still,
everyone has their own shtick, so be  bored if you must, be unhappy if you
please, .....no, that won't work either, please too close to pleasure:-)

I find much that gets written to the digest is just overflow,  a chance for
display, a chance to  preen one's literary feathers. I read  this digest
to see what new presses are around, what new Ezines are on line, &  what new
books are in print. My preference in poetry & poetics seems best to mesh
with the folks who subscribe to this digest  &  so I really enjoy browsing
here.

Reuven BenYuhmin

You try to get what you want & what you want you desire & what you desire
you find somehow pleasurable, isn't that the way it works? The rest comes
via blindness, ignorance.

Dear Geoffrey et al
It has been a long time since I made headlines on POETICS, at least 5 or 6
years since the days of the anti-hegemony project and alt.fan.silliman.  &
now for being wrong!  Superb!  I won't bask in it (& do need to change my
meds).

I'd agree with you that it is largely unproductive to respond to nudel by
being partially indignant (mainly informative hopefully) but couldn't help
it at the moment-was so incredulous that he could make such fiction out of
what I knew of as the "real."  Plus, there's a little history to this as I
mentioned in my post.  I vow to be more creative in responding to such posts
al futuro.  I appreciate yr complaint, to tell the truth, as part of my life
is as critic & often need to be told how to be better at it...what works and
what doesn't.  & since we're not having an argument at a bar here,
spontaneously ripping into someone else's post could very well be a faulty
approach.

As far as my own creativity goes, there's plenty happening.  Just launched,
in collaboration with Baraka, amiribaraka.com in its preliminary format.
Though it has not been much publicized yet, invite everyone here to check it
out (& offer suggestions if inclined).  We'll see how that goes.  We Press
has just published the text of the piece I performed with Amy at e-poetry
2001, "The Idea of Switzerland," made out of MOO transcripts, & I'll be
interested to hear peoples' responses to it (a few *review* copies are
available, backchannel wepress@con2.com).  Don Byrd & I did a reading on
Sunday at zinc bar that went very well.  But mostly spending the summer
writing about pre-WWW computerized poetry & spending time w/the family.

Anyway, can you tell me (backchannel if you please) what you mean w/yr
reference to WCW.  Do I misquote him somewhere?  That would be entirely
possible, & I'd be grateful for the correction.


paz,

I enjoy this drivel as you call it. If I were you I would stop hampering
someone's creativity and work on your own!
Or at least re-read your WCW to properly quote him

Presumably a pleasurable habit.

Take pleasure from suffering do we?

Again, sounds close to pleasure to me. The
pleasure of new ways of seeing. The same reason
one might travel or read National Geographic

And relieving boredom is not simply another way

You must enjoy annoying other people.

Perhaps - there are other metaphors of contagion

Well you can read poems like that to me anytime!

I'd have a hard time seeing the reading of a poem
as a favour in the same way picking up milk at
the store is a favour.

Bad poetry does that to me - but I hardly seek it
out

Close enough in my books...

I suspect most editors take a "neutral" stance
towards unsuitable submissions. Clearly the
"pleasure" of finding publishable work overcomes
the "pain" of reading mediocre or unsuitable
work.

I disagree - everything we do is based on some
prior condition or concept of self. I don't think
we need to posit an "unconscious" mind to see
that people move towards pleasure, and avoid
pain. Yes, even masochists.

Perhaps - but a multiplicity of situations can be
seen as a single gestalt. A rainstorm is a
confluence of circumstances resulting in a single
thing - namely, the rainstorm itself. Poetry is a
confluence of words creating a single object
capable - if it is a "good" piece of work - of
bearing many interpretations. Likewise the
"reasons" for reading poetry can come from
multiple sources, but ultimately is fulfilled
completely in its own design.

one thing everyone seems to forget about the so-called assimilation of the
language poets is that they held out about as long as they could, and some
(esp the women) do not have academic posts or doctorates.  reaganomics made
it impossible to do the kinds of community service jobs and/or survive
doing art.  several of the langpos who went for doctorates did so at
considerably older ages than is considered normative precisely because they
were not career academics but poets when others in their age group were in
doctoral programs.  so they got a late start, which puts them not in the
most cushy position --assistant prof in your late forties???  you can say,
yeah, but anyone who gets tenure is eventually defanged as a potential
revolutionary and in a certain context that argument has some merit.  as
far as i'm concerned anyone with a retirement account, myself included, is
living off other people's labor.  but so is anyone who buys clothing not
tailormade or not from secondhand stores or yard sales, etc.   these things
have to be seen in context, and sometimes it's hard to sort out the merits
of the anti-academic argument from the ressentiment that can get interlaced
with it.

that's not an establishment?
and weren't church and class prescribing standards in literature, and art
in general, weren't they the political and literary establishment?

i'm not being critical of the L= poets just descriptive, if my description
is wrong please illuminate me as to the 'real' situation.

you weren't at e-Poetry or DAC 2001 or at the elo literature awards.
you would have witnessed some revolutionary poetry.
revolutionary in the sense that is challenging the creative process of
poetry, the way poetry is read, the publishing and distribution of poetry,
and the selection and elevation of poetic works. challenging the literary
establishment, if not the political.

yes, i would say as a performance poet for 15 years, my sole source of
income  from being a performance poet, i was adopted by the literary and
political establishment in the pluralist days of the mid-eighties, i began
working to their agenda. i do so now too as a university full-time tenure
track lecturer. if you know how to live in australia without being cushy
with the establishment please let me know, unless you are advocating the
relationship you maintain with humanity.

> > > > Synopsis: The 12hr-ISBN-JPEG Project began December 30, 1994.
A `round-the-clock posting of sequenced hypermodern imagery by Brad
Brace. The hypermodern minimizes the familiar, the known, the
recognizable; it suspends identity, relations and history.


                       The 12-hour ISBN JPEG Project
                       -----------------------------
                          began December 30, 1994


Pointless Hypermodern Imagery... posted/mailed every 12 hours... a
stellar, trajective alignment past the 00`s! A continuum of minimalist
masks in the face of catastrophe; conjuring up transformative
metaphors for the everyday... A poetic reversibility of events...

A post-rhetorical, continuous, apparently random sequence of
imagery...  genuine gritty, greyscale...  corruptable, compact,
collectable and compelling convergence. The voluptuousness of the grey
imminence: the art of making the other disappear. Continual visual
impact; an optical drumming, sculpted in duration, on the endless
present of the Net.

An extension of the printed ISBN-Book (0-9690745) series... critically
unassimilable... imagery is gradually acquired, selected and
re-sequenced over time... ineluctable, vertiginous connections. The
12hr dialtone...

~ This interminable, relentless sequence of imagery began in earnest
on December 30, 1994. The basic structure of the project has been over
twenty-four years in the making. While the specific sequence of
photographs  has been presently orchestrated for more than 12 years`
worth of 12-hour postings, I will undoubtedly be tempted to tweak the
ongoing publication with additional new interjected imagery. Each
12-hour posting is like the turning of a page; providing ample time
for reflection, interruption, and assimilation.

All the life on this list seems to have gone on
vacation.  I miss the Queen of Spleen, David
Benedetti.

A few words about National Poetry Month.
Now that we've heard from members of the Academy
protesting that it's sponsored by the Academy, and an
apocryphal tale of the poetry gulag in high
school,(wasn't high school ever thus?) I'd like to
describe what actually happens in public libraries -
the other sponsors of National Poetry Month (through
the American Library Association)- during April.  We
have poetry readings, usually by local poets, usually
NOT academics, frquently young people, frequently
representative of the diverse communities that public
libraries serve. We create displays of books,
frequently the rare books in our collections that are
the work of local poets, NOT usually academics, more
like small press books, more like real people. We host
things like the Favorite Poem Project, which brings
people of every possible, description into the library
to share their favorite poem. In our library in Taos
last year that meant citizens reading Charles
Bukowski,  Kenneth Patchen, Robert Frost( yeah, yeah,
you knew that) Anna Ahkmatova, Ani De Franco, and a
couple of tiny little boys who read Shel Silverstien.
I actually heard someone express an objection to this
because the idea came from Robert Pinsky, whose work
they didn't like. Jeez
We give poetry a place in the community. Who else does
that?

I have to agree with Patrick. Reading poetry is often pure existential
engagement, nothing more.  So is writing it.  Can be like watching birds
landing on a highway.  Just watch; it's automatic.  Many other activities
fall into this category, very often-- most of which, in some way, are
thought to give pleasure.
    1. eating
    2. smoking
    3. biking
    4. TV
    5. sex/masturbation
    6. music
    7. pedestrian life (walking around, shopping)

 These activities can be distinctly like-- Staring at shapes-- or like web
surfing: clicking around.

Also, I've found, that if I can't write in this mode (of soul sleep?
something?) in which I'm not receiving pleasure, then I can't write.  Some
of my best work is developed in those unpleasurable times.

Go boredom!  it works.

Michael

Answer to your question: Is pleasure is the *only* reason & the *only* cause
for doing *anything*?  I would not be so sure.

My little twelve step program for withdrawing from the dimension of pleasure
isn't necessarily a confession of my "self" though some things may be
nominally true about my nominal little self.  these 12 reasons are reasons
anyone could have given for doing anything.  these are just some of the
things in this world that motivate people to do things.  motivations quite
possibly are not all towards pleasure, and motivations are not necessarily
the substratum for activity.  i cannot say for sure that you are wrong, i
cannot say that every action, every effort does not reduce to
pleasure-seeking with any certainty, but i sure have my doubts you can know
that it does.  besides, that would make "pleasure-seeking" a sort of
tautological theory of behavior.

weird thing is, i trust language on a certain level.  it can tell us things,
perhaps false things, but reasons enough for speculating on the possibility
that we are not all so fundamentally egocentric, where we are not something
like mystical acorns lodged deep within our bodies or spirits, etc.  what
self is, is and will likely remain a mystery.

and, well, some people who are miserable in this world do read poetry,
people with f'ed up reasons of all sorts, or people with things beyond their
control (or some combination of both).  it happens on this planet, or at
least I believe so.

you also said: "everything we do is based on some
> prior condition or concept of self"

whoa.  how can you be so sure?  i don't think you can be so sure.   though i
guess it's possible you are.

i agree with your comment about positing an unconscious mind... change that
to "body".

i wrote the following last night, a sort of obvious joke on the surface (if
you dig philosophy, & I believe you do) but then a not so obvious joke
underneath.  things can get complicated quickly, and then they get sort of
strange, into a world without answers.  it's based on some very excellent
graffiti i saw last night that said, "everything you know is wrong."  i
laughed at it, but then i don't believe we can know we know, and so on....



justified true belief

is knowledge


some of the things you know

are wrong



after all, at the end of your post, i think what we believe is not that far
apart.  i don't think you're just aware of your uncertainties.  after all as
you mention a gestalt can be made of many things into one thing, hence the
possibility of all things boiling down to pleasure-seeking.  yet you
acknowledge something that you agree with about what i wrote those possibly
many things forming the gestalt.  the uncertainty itself is a sign.

thanks for your sincerity michael.

best,

Patrick

I take it you mean in respect of a little number, Aaron. It doesn't surprise
me. This is still the land of snob-culture, repackaged now as chatty newgen.
The last thing many in Britculture want is communication, they thrive on
frustrating others. So the general tone of literary culture is that of a
talking corpse, most of what life there is comes from expats from out of the
sea's ozone haze surprises.

The Nation has always struck me as being most un-progressive a journal with
regards to poetry, or at least it has in the 25 or so years that I've been
reading it. You're right about the death row bad humor on the submissions
page browser title. If I had wanted to submit, I would think twice.

If St. Louis is "a bit out of the picture," then where is the picture? I
thought it was dispersed to all dimensions.

I am reluctant perhaps because really chose to be a poet, and I never chose
the circumstances that made me this way.  Those circumstances, I can assure
you, were frequently not pleasurable.

I am quite sure, now that I have socialized with other poets, that I am not
alone in this experience.  Looking at history, poets often become poets out
of personal torment (mental illness, substance abuse, ill fortune, and so
on).  The relief of such torments that takes the form of poetry can only
tenuously be called pleasurable.  Sometimes it's as pleasurable as removing
a gaffing hook from one's own side. Sometimes writing damn well tastes like
Castor Oil, but then there's this something inside or outside of me that
does not give me much choice in the matter.  It is intimately bound with my
very existence, so for me, choosing to "change my habits" would not be good
for me.  Reading poetry, as I'm sure you know, is an integral part of
writing poetry, and so for many of us, the reading bit is in union with the
writing bit.  So, reading poetry is not necessarily pleasurable, and I doubt
I am some marginal exception to the dominance of pleasure-seeking.

Of course, sometimes poetry IS pleasurable.  But the pleasure is, for me, as
much of an exception as any other reason.

"> You try to get what you want & what you want you desire & what you desire
> you find somehow pleasurable, isn't that the way it works? The rest comes
> via blindness, ignorance."

Sometimes desire is overrated.  Consciousness is perhaps overrated, too.
Blindness and ignorance, hmm.  it depends what sort of blindness we are
talking about.  Ultimately we are ALL blind, every single one of us.  Poetry
that fails to know that it doesn't hold much in the way of knowledge often
fails to be poetry.  This isn't necessarily a search for happiness or
pleasure; it could be a search for some peace, some quiet.  Sometimes the
search just ends up finding you.

If poetry is read for pleasure, then should we not consider *anything* that
is either difficult, painful, or tragic "marginal"?  Surely tragic poetry is
hardly marginal, for one.

Display is absolutely necessary to communication.  If you didn't display you
would not communicate.

As far as the content of this list, I'd much rather see MORE of the personal
displays you criticize (we caught you preening too!) and less of the
marketing displays.  More discussion, less advertising.  But that's not
something I'd like to get into and we've all heard this by now.  It's a
widened cup pounded flat.

Thanks for your thoughtful reply and adding to the substantive discussion.

Best,
Patrick

This Could Be More Useless

People read poetry. I do not understand them.
Of course I am writing this because
it pleases me to do so. My pleasure is
in publishing poetry. Since people can

pay money for the books, we publish
these, they are good poetry books consisting
of good poems. Through publishing
more poetry each year that I am told people relish

and these people talk to me I ordinarily
would not talk to want to talk to me
and I respond in all sorts of awkward
manifestations that seem fitting, leotards
of language, lets say,  we just bend the bow
prance out the poetry in Columbus, Ohio.



Be well

Michael. your critique of Patrick's "Poem/Statements" is concise and i take
some of your points. But Patrick hs written some excellent stuff: and you
dont comment on what Patrick was attempting - perhaps I agree not the "best'
of what he is capable, but it's good to see some 'take' on the discussion
...such as it is. There's not enough put on the list...but I think that
Patrick was attempting a kind of tabulated series which enters into the
spirit of discussion. But its good to see this kind of interaction. Patrick
I think stuff closer to:

        Unknowing you may be sleeping in dreams unowned.

   As a series would be good.... Even detached or contrasted this works
well: maybe with some revision your series would be great. But I'll see what
if anything the incisive Mr Amberwind hs to say about my "The Red"
post.Themn we might have the chance to view his own wonderful gems. Regards
all, Richaard Taylor.

Ruevin . I like the way you say what you say. But rea "A Poetics" by Charles
Bernstein...he invokes (in avery brillliant and no-boring language) such
poets as Swinburne, Emly Dickinson, Morris as well as points out that a
cntral one-canonaonical English is as an "outworn creed"...a misconception.
Writing is many englishes, many styles...Gertrude Stein was aware that the
Swiburne of "Hendecalsyllabics" with all his transgressions (sexual and
over-kill if you like in mellifluity etc) had literally reached "the end of
the line" ...in France Mallarme was into symbolism and the new open field
prose poem...Wilde was going wild: his innovations being more
social-sexual-intellectual...Stephen Crane is also invoked: this is not
boring writing...the idea of sometimes a contrasting or undercutting
"dryness" is perhaps not new but useful.  The language poets were not too
young for acid it was around over here in little old New Zealand in the
sixties, but I'd stopped writing by the end of 1969 and i have never "done
drugs" per se...."ecstasy" is the latest way for young people to go crazy
 or die)...reciprocal masturbation: a bit strong...its good to hear praise
but then that praise is useless if hollow: but you use interesting
language...your email is interesting, not boring!
  At the moment though its all a bit abstract: what do you think of Alan
Sondheim's writing...or his project?  My poems "The Red" and "Summer
Sonata"?  "The Red" is (I think) a brilliant poem but it is totally
(totally?) self-contained: paradoxically or predictably it uses iambics.It
has a skipping beat as it began: beating in my head. It has no inherent
meaning and is (nearly) absolutely self-referential ..altho I realise that
such a state (of non-referentiality) is actually somewhat illusory. It's
closer to symbolism than language poetry although there is no intentional
symbolism in it. To me red is simply red, and the whole poem only means
itself. This doesnt mean that the reader receiver cant comment or construct
or "re-write": what that poem does illustrate is artifice - absolute
artifice - but not artful artifice. The poem was simply written when I first
encountered Stein's writing (about 1992) and has not much (directly) to do
with that writer...the poem just "came into my head" ...it was as though I
was writing music.

Here's "RED"...you can get it probably from the Poetics archives or
wherever:

     The blocks of red on red on red by black  around
     by  black by  black  by  line by line by round. The
     red in red of red in red where  black  by  back the
     white around.                Around the  bound about
     the white the red more red comes up  the  red.  It
     rears its head.      The eye the see the sight to see.
     The eye the see the light the sight.

                        And   Light.

   The  light  not  light not bright  not  dim not sun.
   The sun not round not nup not down. The blue
   not there not green not grey.  The grey ungrey
   not grey not black. The up not down the down
   not up.

  And the black not black not black on night. The
  light alight but light not light.

                The Clock Is Dead.

  The clock awake alive like Head. The Head like
  blood like hot is red.

  The squares  the slabs  the reds   the blocks  are
  chops of chunks: the chunks the chunks tghe bits.
  The monks. And  the red  and red and round the
  black.   (There is no black.)

  To you my red my Square my Thing:  I fall  and
  blubber like a sun-struck King.

  The red on red of red the blocks.The orange the
  green the blue.       The see the sight the steel the
  grey.    The shape the tall the dark the great. The
  high the high.   The finger like a finger on the sky.

            The eye the seen.

            The green.

  O my blocks my reds my reds my blocks: orange
  is not is gnomes is gone.

  And  the  red  in    red.     (There is no red.)
  The square thats not  thats never thats there.
  If   red   be   red    not    _is_     not   green:
  then red on red of red is you my Thing. And
  if  that  is  you by  blocks by  black  are red
  around.

  And black is black is black is black.

      And red is red is red.


Connoiseuers of my oeuvre ( and they are legion) (joke) will immediately
notice I have capitalised some of the nouns...hinting  at  Dickinson
perhaps? And that (because since i wrote it I discovered justification: I'm
sruggling to "justify" the text of this Great Poem...and seriously, i quest:
what thinketh or careth mein readers of this mein innovation and the "holes"
thus left in the "blocks" of the poem...but the thing mainly about it is to
read it aloud: all poetry should at some time be read aloud...(there's a
book featuring the Nuyoriscan Poets (I went to the Nuyorican in 1993) called
"ALOUD" its in my local Panmure library.) but especially this which is
equalled perhaps only  by Blake's "Tyger" ...maybe not...anycase this is an
opportunity for feed back. Posi or posi neg but let's avoid the Nyquist
criteria. But "Summer Sonata" is quite different...more "sprawly"...but I
had no idea per se what I was doing in either poem. Thus the idea comes now
to write on top of these old poems,palimsestincestically, perhaps literally
by hand, perhaps not. (possibly to be copied later things in large writing
written like a child's like: BULLSHIT or  CRAP or something like THE
EXECUTION WILL POSSIBLY BE LIVE AT 12 PM NZ TIME SET CLOCK FOR THE
EXCITEMENT  and other stuff.  It's all great fun. I'm all for fun and
pleasure..but if Charles von Bernstein get's jollies from "boring" then so
be it...he needs to explain that...but that is probably only a fraction of
what he is or was talking about. Murat should put more on line himself. See
the way i "put myself on line" in lines I'm online so drop me a line and we
can line things up in a line and maybe light a lime: lineate the line, aline
the line... and so ine.....My compatriot Wystan von Curnowine  is too
briefly on line. I dont know what his brief is. I dont know if he likes
wine. I think he likes to dine. Do i have to be respectful to W C and C
B..after all Wystan was my lecturer in 1990 and 1992 when I went back to Uni
as an adult student. I'm 53. I'm short fat and balding. That's me. Or is it?
What are ya...who are ya...and so on....that's MY  line. Whats your line?
Anycase..I'll try to put "Summer Sonata" on another email and you etal might
also comment on that. I'm wanting to move away from that semi-unmediated
stuff though...but its always something in my "arsenal"....

I agree somewhat re the Beats...they've been a bit "done to death".... a bit
like Dylan Thomas and Cohen but Thomas was a great poet...I'm not so
interested in him/them now. (I mean at this very now.) But you have the
whole world of writing ... and there's a lot out there of interesting and
often moving writing. I'm kinda talking to myself as well as responding..I'm
not criting ...I liked your email and the thoughts contained. And this
Boring Debate is Interesting. Regards, Richard Taylor.

long as you know it's not official until the end of this week. I just want to
see who's interested. This circulation is 119,00 and this will run for six

Hi all,

Does anyone happen to have contact info for Tina Darragh,
such as e-mail, phone number?

Also, does anyone know anything about the whereabouts of one Marc Lowenthal,
who published a series of small chapbooks
called the Club of Odd Volumes
out of Buffalo a couple of years ago?

Please backchannel

and thank you much,

No apologies for cross-posting
But apologies if you get this twice and that annoys you
------------------------------------------------------------------

REVIEW: red shifts / Maggie O'Sullivan
Etruscan; £7.50 / $US14.95; ISBN 1 901 538 25 7
distributed by Peter Riley (UK), SPD (N America) Collected Works (Australia)

A square book, well-produced, in colour. It's a size format I think that I
first saw in Bob Cobbing's _Bill Jubobe: selected texts 1942-1975_ from
Coach House in 1976 and which Etruscan used for Cobbing's _Shrieks and
Hisses_ in 1999; but that may all be coincidence.

It opens into a red-printed double page. On the left-hand, a thrice-drawn
line, pointing towards, on the right, on the title page, that is... a bat? a
rat or mouse? unexpected, visible, there, the way they are, we and they,
living in different coincident spaces, different realities, different points
of view, different movements and vectors. Us and words. Us and sight. You
and me.

Over, on the next page, a thin vertical twisting line, top to bottom, draws
a line "under" the title and continues the theme somewhat; then separate and
after (reading left to right), a horizontal jagged line.

Above it, text follows, up and down, child's mountains, rhyming the
thrice-drawn line in the previous double spread where each of the three is
following and leading the other two, a wavering trodden path, birds in a
flock, varying and repeating, drawn in red, red shifts.

The text, like clouds above the angular mountain line, starts "thrine"
(uphill) & "roam" (downhill). The book roams. I roam through the book.

Thrine! An invented word. Thine... through... line... What else? Enthralled?
Shine? (I, just now, checking this for obvious typos, think of D H
Lawrence's Paul Morel talking of the shine on leaves signifying their life -
a little sententious, but not wrong)

Elsewhere the text is also horizontal and centred, and left-margined and
right-margined, words in fields and systems, up to the edge of cliffs
created by the printer's guillotine, a double spread as one spread, text
block cut in two and falling each way away from the book spine, analysed;
"breathing breathing breathing" it says. Look at it again and I see ribs (of
"breathing") exposed, a torso fashioned from words and pages, itself each
other's companion...

"reach of the peacock's / blistering blistering thresholds" - How Maggie
O'Sullivan can write! (exclamation stolen from Forster on Austen)

Single and double pages drawn wordless, but not voiceless; and words found
in words, new lexicons: "fe(th)ur"

Stories forming. Not fragments of stories, but cells of telling, forming
into the told, swimming over each other, combining. The breath of the
author.

Red shift is a consequence of viewpoint in a world of relative motion.
Change standpoint and you change viewpoint. If you would see things as they
are, then you must see things from all points of view!

The view is partial, a red shift.

I am partial to this book.

Red shift is an indication that things are expanding, flying apart from that
maybe centre which may not hold, individual things become separate, more -
seemingly - themselves.

Emptiness of the observation room - "sometimes she cries", printed - type
text - alone, in the white.

Black on white, together, meditational.

All manner of cries! Figurative non-representational drawings in the text as
well as *of the text.

Land-texts.

I suppose I could be clearer, but I might be less true. There is nothing
else like this writing, though there is writing akin to it. *I feel akin to
it in my writing, or a desire to be akin to it.

I recognise it. I know where I am with it, as I do *not know where I am with
most other writing, a world I recognise when I am given the opportunity to
read of it, a world I could not have thought of without the reading. A door
in a wall. It is hard to speak of.

O'Sullivan has moved on and out from "In the house of the shaman" (Reality
Street, 1993), combining the painterly and the literary more fully.

Brilliant.

Hello all--  I just joined the list and thought some of you might want to
peruse the happenings at the Naropa Summer Writing Program this year.  I
have coordinated the program for the past several years and think there is
some good poetic food there.
It's a long document, but if any of you have ever thought about checking it
out this is a draft of the day to day schedule.

CROSS GENRE/ INFRA-STRUCTURE STRATEGIES
Twenty First Century poetics suggests a hybrid of form, language, context,
subversive technical awareness and the continuing role of the writer as
navigator, gadfly, dreamer, agitator in the belly of the corporate beast.
Are the differences between "prose" and "poetry" set in stone?   Are they
pedagogical? Philosophical? Economic? Explore the possibilities with some o=
f
America=B9s most radical experimental writers.  This week we will also be
honoring artist/writer Joe Brainard (who during his life worked with hybrid
form himself) whose show will be mounted at the Boulder Museum of
Contemporary Art concurrent with our program.  We will also feature an even=
t
with compadres from The Poetry Project at St. Mark=B9s in New York and discus=
s
ways in which writers can also create programs, centers, "temporary
autonomous zones" outside the academic mainstream.

1:30-3:30 Lecture: Bill Berkson on Brainard: "Working with Joe"
intro: Michael Smoler
Joe Brainard (1942-1994) was a brilliant artist and writer whose friendship=
s
with poets--among them, Frank O'Hara, Anne Waldman, Ted Berrigan, Ron
Padgett, John Ashbery, Robert Creeley, Kenward Elmslie and
Berkson himself--often extended to collaborating with them on collages and
comics, as well as to designing covers for their books and sets for their
plays. Recollecting, surmising, mulling over a friendship of some thirty
years, reading from his own and the artist's writings, showing slides of
works Brainard created with him as well as with other poets, Bill Berkson
will present compendious evidence on the one-of-a-kind Brainard genius,
together with thoughts on artistic collaboration, generally. This lecture i=
s
given on the occasion of the first major retrospective of Joe Brainard's
art, curated by Constance Lewallen, opening on June 22 at the Boulder Museu=
m
of Contemporary Art.
Location: at Boulder Museum of Contemporary Art Theater -- 1750 13th Street

10-12 Dharma Art with Bill Scheffel
Music is permanent, only listening is intermittent-- H..D.  Thoreau
"Dharma Art refers to the lively and liberated quality of any gesture
executed with attention, without aggression or too much self editing.  As
Basho said of haiku ""the composing must be done in n instant, like felling
a massive tree o, like leaping at a formidable enemy, like cutting into a
watermelon, or biting into a pear."
 In this course we learn and practice sitting mediation and study the
teaching of Chogyam Trungpa (and others, including Allen Ginsberg and her
Mind Writing  Slogans) on space awareness, object arranging, and poetic
composition.  Every class includes a talk, mediation, "hands on" awareness
exercises and writing.    (Open to all interested participants registered

WEEK TWO: June 25-July 1
POLITICS OF IDENTITY/GENDER/QUEER THEORY
At a time when diversity is artistically rich and strong, the very nature o=
f
the right-wing intolerant "political covenant" threatens the rights and
well-being of people "of difference" everywhere. Join major writers who hav=
e
investigated their own cultural, racial, sexual metabolisms with bravery an=
d
skill, and who rise above the cliched sitcom mediocrity that controls and
makes mockery of dissent.  Is the issue one of body, of mind, of
imagination? The  Naropa writing community  has long been struggling with
these issues in the bubble town of privileged Boulder, articulating the
beauties of "transgression", and the linguistic powers of torquing the
"father" tongue. Poet and  scholar Robin Blaser, warrior of the legendary
San Francisco Renaissance will honor our academe, along with Samuel R.
Delany whose elegant science fiction narratives defy old models and define
an exquisitely imagined "future" turf.

INVESTIGATIVE POETICS/  "TOTAL SATURATION JOBS"

From some point of view it=B9s ALL investigative. But this week attention
focuses on writers  who have taken on the scholarship of biography,
documentation, translation, and memoir. What bag of tricks & skills does on=
e
need to suss out a subject and its subtext? What is the voyeur=B9s pleasure  =
-
in the realm of empathy -  through words?  Charles Olson conjures "istorin"=
,
the sense of "finding out for oneself". Ed Sanders=B9 PHRASE "total saturatio=
n
job" is useful in that it posits a requisite immersion. Guest lecturer Pete=
r
Lamborn Wilson will dazzle us this week with insights on "Hieroglyphia."
Documentation (of facts & figures) seems urgent as the planet requires
guardians and  keepers of the flame to insure that literary inquisitiveness
is passed on. Young generation activists and archivists Lisa Jarnot and
Kristin Prevallet will give us the latest scoop.

Women Writers of the Beat Generation"     intro: Anne Waldman
This presentation introduces the field of women Beat writers, positing some
criteria for their identification as Beat and inclusion in that literary
movement. The discussion examines the way women beat writers have been
elided from constructions of the Beat, situates the elided writers within
the movement, and recounts the processes by which the women writers have
instantiated themselves in the Beat, even against the elisions of popular
history and the dominant male writers in the group. Finally, the discussion
suggests some ways Beat is expanded and altered by the inclusion and
consideration of the negated women writers of the movement. Those writers
provide another way of understanding Beat's relation to successive
postmodern movements and artistic directions.

PERFORMANCE/ INTER-ARTS/ SANGHA

dedication of its ongoing, supportive, alternative community. Students are
welcome to take the vow to "keep the world safe for poetry" (& all the othe=
r
genres & myriad genders) - it is at the heart of the agenda - in this final
week of performance, inter-arts and community. Long time Summer Faculty
guest, the ecological writer and activist Peter Warshall will instruct us i=
n
the beauties of inter-species art and communication. Other guests this week
embrace the page and the stage with their innovative words & music.
Saxophone artist and composer Steve Lacy and singer Irene Aebi will teach a
workshop on how they work with poets=B9 lyrics. Kenward Elmslie will provoke
with his canny gestures and mind-boggling text.  Erica Hunt will team up
with Marty Ehrlich to show us how it -the duo - is done.  Sangha, Sanskrit
for community, carries our sense of purpose and commitment.

1-2  The Lyric Lately Lecture by Marjorie Welish        Location: PAC
on "The New York School and the Metapoetic Lyric"
 The extended New York School experiment draws attention to the literarines=
s
of poetry.  To differing degrees, the principal poets incorporate the
resources of writing, and comment on its codes.  In retrospect, the poetics
of the New York School may come to be read less through utterance and more
through construction, thanks in part to the belated transmission of semioti=
c
literary theory from abroad which only further invited further literariness
in the production and reception of this poetry.

SATURDAY July 14

10-12 Dharma Art with Bill Scheffel
Music is permanent, only listening is intermittent-- H..D.  Thoreau
"Dharma Art refers to the lively and liberated quality of any gesture
executed with attention, without aggression or too much self editing.  As
Basho said of haiku ""the composing must be done in n instant, like felling
a massive tree o, like leaping at a formidable enemy, like cutting into a
watermelon, or biting into a pear."
 In this course we learn and practice sitting mediation and study the
teaching of Chogyam Trungpa (and others, including Allen Ginsberg and her
Mind Writing  Slogans) on space awareness, object arranging, and poetic
composition.  Every class includes a talk, mediation, "hands on" awareness
exercises and writing.
 (Open to all interested participants registered for the week-- it is ideal
to take all four classes but you may attend all, one, or any combination
thereof)

Michael,

Kudos on a fine post , intelligent ,  unequivocal & to the
point(s). Good that you had the patience to go point by point, & to
illuminate  some fuzzy thinking.  When I got to the "annoy people," I
thought, well, he must be kidding, & for his sake I would hope he is.

Strange the things that give others pleasure, & I'd guess, after thinking
about this a bit more, that  the 12 reasons he gives are a source of
pleasure, which makes me think things are worse then I suspected.  Many of
Patrick's points (habit, an unconscious need for suffering, my eyes are
bored, to get pissed off, to annoy, because language is a virus) disavow
any responsibility for his actions. I thought the goal to envision was
becoming more mindful, more conscious, rather then to fall back into
mindlessness.

Again, sounds close to pleasure to me. The

I'd have a hard time seeing the reading of a poem

Bad poetry does that to me - but I hardly seek it

Close enough in my books...

I suspect most editors take a "neutral" stance
towards unsuitable submissions. Clearly the
"pleasure" of finding publishable work overcomes
the "pain" of reading mediocre or unsuitable
work.

I disagree - everything we do is based on some
prior condition or concept of self. I don't think
we need to posit an "unconscious" mind to see
that people move towards pleasure, and avoid
pain. Yes, even masochists.

Perhaps - but a multiplicity of situations can be
seen as a single gestalt. A rainstorm is a
confluence of circumstances resulting in a single
thing - namely, the rainstorm itself. Poetry is a
confluence of words creating a single object
capable - if it is a "good" piece of work - of
bearing many interpretations. Likewise the
"reasons" for reading poetry can come from
multiple sources, but ultimately is fulfilled
completely in its own design.

Subject:      death to new formalism
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii" ; format="flowed"

Interesting discussion about form.  It strikes me that the question
is not "Who wants to be bound by a lot of quite arbitrary rules?".
In fact, lots of postmodern poets do, whether they are exploratory
poets or new formalists.  There is not really a huge amount of
STRUCTURAL difference between the rules of a sonnet or those of a
patterned Mac Low piece or those of Tjanting or Quindecagon.  All
involve repetition of one language element or another.  Ron is right
that "work as diverse as Bob Grenier's and Lee Ann Brown's and
Bernadette Mayer's can certainly be read as a new formalism in the
most literal sense."  The difference of whether a form has been used
for centuries or invented for the particular poem is superficial, and
not sustainable.  All that's new becomes old soon enough, and if a
poet is challenged by writing in an old form that has been tested
over centuries rather than by inventing a new form, does that make
them automatically an aesthetic reactionary?   The examples Mike
cites make it clear enough that the answer is no.  Rhymed couplets
and ballads are some of the most ancient forms, but the poems by
Ostashevsky and Mohammed, not to mention Stein and Mullen, are of the
moment.

Nonetheless, if 99% of the formal DNA is the same--as it is between
us and a chimpanzee--or even 98%--as it is between us and a
banana--there is still that 1 or 2% difference to argue over.  The
smallness of that difference, the closeness between the two sides
insofar as both are excited by language as a material, is a direct
cause of the bitterness of the argument, as in Ireland or Israel, so
that the majority of langpoets and new formalists still mistrust each
other years after much of the mainstream has abandoned its anger
against formalism.   I think that the 1% or 2% difference is a
crucial one and is, as Mike points out, a matter of recognizing and
foregrounding the materiality of the signifier, of respecting the
artifice of form and not trying to naturalize or normalize or
fetishize it or use it transparently in the service of a message.
It's just a miniscule difference in dosage that distinguishes a
substance as poison from the same substance as medicine.  But we feel
the difference.

  ( A personal note--I am relieved by this turn of events since I have
for years been dubbed a "new formalist" because I chose to be
challenged most deeply by old forms a decade ago, but have always
felt that my project was at base an exploratory one.  Maybe finally
there are emerging categories that make sense).
PS  Using the ghost of Swift to attack the New Formalists seems a bit
self-defeating.

Apologies for this promiscuous cross-posting, but for anyone interested in
the matter of the FOIL anthology, the only attempt at saying something
different in bookform on a largescale in stale Britannia in recent days,
whether you agree with its ambience and contents or not, it was better than
nothing, there is a review of the same at:

http://www.greatworks.org.uk/

by a certain Andrew Duncan. Plus other bits.

cheers

Richard,

I delayed my response to your post because I didn't want to give a glib
answer and also because so many were writing in response to the word
"pleasure."

There is no question that readers may get pleasure in all sorts of ways, as
Patrick's wonderful 12 point list implies. My basic idea in using "pleasure"
as true test was to say that at the end of the day if someone still doesn't
like a poem ("like," in whatever sense of the word) he or she should have the
freedom to acknowledge it, instead of rationalizing it away. The word
"pleasure" was used as call for liberation.

Ciao.

Murat

Aaron etal.  Well there are 13 from NZ. New Zealand was (and still is
somewhat) culturally and historically hence somehow politically tied to
Britain and from the sixties or mid fifties a shift to the US culture. In
fact Christchurch is touted as being a more English town than any in
England. Its also a place where people of a certain ilk will accuse you of
being "a bloody pom". The England of my affections is, and shall probably
forever remain, in my imagination: both my parents being English.  But the
feeling I get from British or English people is a certain acid conservatism:
mind you these are terrible generalisations...it is also the country that
produced some of the most brilliant thinkers innovators and so on. I think
that the US is so large in size and population that that in itself generates
enthusiasm: the need and the desire to communicate (more).....this sort of
thing can be argued forever.  Its strange that a highly "progressive"
country such as the US still has the death penalty, but then some of the
countries that crit the US are a bit dodgy: places in the Middle East and
parts of Europe and India where ...well: they may have history, and
museums... a friend of mine said once: "Euroe is one big museum".  But the
numbers. Probably there are fewer magazines and outlets in England the UK
that are not dominated by "the official verse culture"...this problem
happenning in the US but simply because of numbers there (albeit a bit
marginalised) more small mags and more counter cultures. It "goes on" you
know in England but probably the critics there are more dismissive of
"experiment".  It pertains here too...Wellington being more clustered around
Victoria University where Bill Manhire (undoubtedly a good poet) has his
"factory" to produce pseudo-modernist Manhire clones who specialise oin
writing boring...well, perhaps I'd better choose another term!...terminally
dull slobber that passes as "fascinating" and "new" while Auckland
University (clustered around a few rather tired old gurus of language-centre
d poetry) are producing ... well at least they are encouraging some
alternative views. Then there was Scott Hamilton's SALT that published
myself, Michael Arnold, Scott himself, Hamish Dewe,Leon Mathews, Simon
Field,Miriam Bellard, Jack Ross, Thorin Kerr, James McGoram, Kenn Mitchell
and Miriiam Bellard to name some in the last issue. It was never meant to be
on going or official. BRIEF which attempts to be avant-garde is interesting
...edited by John Geraets...but there is not much else: a poet called Kapka
Kassabova was touted about because she was attractive and from Romania! She
was described as young and (implied exotic) but writes rather dubious
stuff.One had to hear how beautiful she was before seeing her work!! A
certain Mark Pirie (whose work is terminally dull) sells massively.  So -
apart from SALT - and writers such as myself, Scott Hamilton, Hamish
Dewe,Jack Ross, Michael Arnold and Leon Mathews etc and my friend Leicester
Kyle (whose on his own brilliant  "trip") and last but most Richard Taylor:
the lit scene here is pretty dead.
They keep republishing Allen Curnow - who is undoubtedly a great poet - but
well there's not much else...unlesss you go to the pubs and readings where
sometimes some sparks are seen. But there are obviously at least 13
(enlightened?) lurkers....out there...as to Britain. My mate spent years in
London and apparently it still shuts down at 11 pm like  a mausoleum so God
knows why people go there. My father "escaped" from England of the class
system to make a life in NZ as did my uncle, who from owing ten pounds on
alighting pre the Second WW in this domain, became the director manager of a
large chemical company and very well to do. No hope of that in cold old
England....not the "real" England of my immagination. THAT England is MINE.
I claim it.
   Openness. That's what people lack. Openness and friendliness. Be open.
  Anycase 13 and 19 are odd numbers...there's something odd about the whole
thing. Regards, Richard. PS Mind you I keep re-watching "84 Charing Cross
Road" ("Father forgive me....")....so....

        Did I miss a slur??? Let me go back and look. I mostly like his rantings as
its fun. But I in no way uphold bullshit. I did witness Chris blatantly
misuse WCW's red wheel barrow to defend his argument for something or
another.  It came from a direct misunderstanding of general poetic knowledge
which is directly responsible for the art he creates. This just irked me and
to see his quick response in another form of what I perceived as another
form of snuffing out creativity - well I just shot back. I should have
looked further into what m&r had to say. Thanks for pointing out racism,
which I will never uphold as art!

Poetics People and Wystan.  I think there's a problem of definitions. The
'establishment'  refers maybe to those so-called middle class who in fact
existed both in the 1900s and the 1970s and still exist. How to decide
whether the 1970s onwards LangPoets were contra an establishment? Well some
were and the degree to which they were consciously driven against the
conservative establishment compared to say a difficult to define avant-garde
somewhere in the 1890s or 1900s is hard to determine. Avant-garde: is that
always meaning "leading" and against the establishment and or revolutionary
or simply the advance guard?
  It's probably impossible to separate a "cutting edge" movement and any
general political movement: but a "revolutionary" in literature or poetry
may not be so also in strict political terms. Kominos has a complaint or
problem that is quite general. Hierachies...we need and dont need them and
love them and hate them and need or dont need to love or hate them or
support or destroy them.
  An example of a major innovator /avant-garde in literature and poetry is
Gertrude Stein, but as to her general political outlook, it seems to have
been relatively either non-existent or naive or conservative by default.
Pound was a great innovator but he couldnt be accused of being
revolutionary: he had rather simplistic notions of economics and politics
and seems to have gone mad and even more right wing as he got older. Very
few innovative writers, artists, musicians can ever be seen or even
connected (except perhaps indirectly) with opposition to the status quo. Its
in the interests of most to maintain the status quo. Quite a number are
"liberal' and vaguely "left" but very few are heartily opposed to the system
they basically feed off.
  A number of the Langpos were interested in Karl Marx etc and Zukovsky had
some references to Marx.....but also to Bach and Spinoza etc
   Change happens but how do the avant garde somehow get miraculously
expunged? If there isnt now an avant garde then we may as well pack up and
do something else: there has to be an avant garde at all times...even if
they or it is "invisible". And if there is an avant garde, regardless of
their politics or the politics: the church and class systems are still
playing their part. Perhaps the role is not always obvious. Nor is it
obvious who is in what class or whether any artistic action is
"revolutionary" or comes with any revolution or change of political import.
   But that certain writers become teachers or professors is almost
irrelevant. It's a simple fact that we have all got to earn a living
somehow.
   I think as well as the class struggle etc there is always another
struggle and that is against a fairly natural tendency for societies to be
in conflict between the young with new ideas and the old whose ideas have
become somewwhat "set in stone" although in many cases the young are equally
conservative. There are other intra-societal struggles that continue
whatever the era or political climate. But age is always somewhat in
struggle with youth.
  If the Lanpos were all of a mind politically revolutionary as well as
poetically some sense could be made of this debate but the reality is that
poets artists etal are mostly and invariably individualists - and perhaps
necessarily and not neccessarily detrimentally - self-absorbed
individuals.Maybe not totally self-absorbed though. Selfish in the best
sense. Bu hopefully not in the sense of becoming indifferent to injustices
and the need for good political change and maybe even revoution: but I
suppose that (as with all of us) they need to look to themselves first. A
starved or sick professor or ex LangPo or (non-ex) is just as useless as a
happy and healthy non-innovative conservative...but back to kominos's
comments it is possible for the professors at e-poetry to be either
conservative and or innovators and in and not in the establishment...not
neccessarily in that order and that might change as their life-circumstances
and thoughts etc change.
  Do they thus run the Academy as a whole? I dont know I doubt it I'm not in
the academic world as such. I mean I dont teach or attend a school or
university at the moment. As always people of whatever occupation or
economic "status" are variously conservative or avant-garde or whatever. I
dont see any "danger" from English Lit professors either leading or
thwarting a revolution. Opinions differ everywhere.
  It's probably "better" for such as myself on low incomes who are "outside"
everything...I have no hopes or pretensions, my back is against the wall, I
might consider blowing up a very large building for sufficient money or if
it brings about some kind of revolution or it excites me: but then I would
probably  be too scared of the bomb going off too early. Terrror is the
purest emotion. Regards, Richard.

                               we are strange
                               and made from fire

                               who look  out side
                               with evil eyes

Subject:      McVeigh's face
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii" ; format="flowed"

Hi All,

Kevin (Killian) and I were in Indiana when Timothy McVeigh was
executed. We were staying at my mother's house, where, if one got up
early one was forcefed incendiary talk-radio.  Imagine making your
morning coffee to the voice of Dr. Laura.  I usually skirted the
issue by sleeping until 10, when Martha Stewart was on TV and the
radio was turned off.  Coffee with Martha was fine, learning how to
make handbags decorated with the impressions of weeds dipped in
paint, etc.

But, we were flying back to SF the morning of McVeigh's execution,
and thus, the talk-radio was on.  It was mostly pro-execution.  One
Chicago broadcaster was actually calling McVeigh the McMurderer.

So, when I got back, I read the online reportage in the New York
Times, and there was a very interesting passage about people
struggling to interpret McVeigh's face as he was dying.  It reads
like the beginning of a Roland Barthes essay:

>As the witnesses to the execution spoke through the day, their
>jarringly different descriptions offered a lucid but unexplored
>commentary about the power of the camera. The two network
>journalists chosen by lottery to watch, Byron Pitts of CBS and
>Shepard Smith of the Fox News Channel, were careful not to read
>anything into Mr. McVeigh's expression. Mr. Smith was especially
>nuanced in reporting that Mr. McVeigh's skin had turned yellow and
>that he had seemed to die painlessly; yet Mr. Smith was rare in
>remaining so astutely aware that each witness would read the event
>differently. As Paul Howell, whose daughter died in the bombing and
>who was also a witness, said, "We didn't get anything from his face."
>
>But many family members who watched on closed circuit television in
>Oklahoma City saw something else. After seeing images from a
>stationary camera above Mr. McVeigh that stared into his face, they
>said things like "We saw hatred" and "It was like I was looking at
>the face of evil."
>
>That lesson about the camera seemed willfully lost on the
>commentators, even when they noticed it. On the Fox News Channel,
>John Gibson rhetorically jumped up and down after a woman who had
>watched on closed circuit said it was "a slap in the face" when Mr.
>McVeigh turned his head away. Mr. Gibson, inflammatory as usual,
>didn't spend time wondering whether the people watching thousands of
>miles away were imposing ideas on an image they could not truly come
>close to.

Subject:      death to new formalism
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii" ; format="flowed"

Interesting discussion about form.  It strikes me that the question
is not "Who wants to be bound by a lot of quite arbitrary rules?".
In fact, lots of postmodern poets do, whether they are exploratory
poets or new formalists.  There is not really a huge amount of
STRUCTURAL difference between the rules of a sonnet or those of a
patterned Mac Low piece or those of Tjanting or Quindecagon.  All
involve repetition of one language element or another.  Ron is right
that "work as diverse as Bob Grenier's and Lee Ann Brown's and
Bernadette Mayer's can certainly be read as a new formalism in the
most literal sense."  The difference of whether a form has been used
for centuries or invented for the particular poem is superficial, and
not sustainable.  All that's new becomes old soon enough, and if a
poet is challenged by writing in an old form that has been tested
over centuries rather than by inventing a new form, does that make
them automatically an aesthetic reactionary?   The examples Mike
cites make it clear enough that the answer is no.  Rhymed couplets
and ballads are some of the most ancient forms, but the poems by
Ostashevsky and Mohammed, not to mention Stein and Mullen, are of the
moment.

Nonetheless, if 99% of the formal DNA is the same--as it is between
us and a chimpanzee--or even 98%--as it is between us and a
banana--there is still that 1 or 2% difference to argue over.  The
smallness of that difference, the closeness between the two sides
insofar as both are excited by language as a material, is a direct
cause of the bitterness of the argument, as in Ireland or Israel, so
that the majority of langpoets and new formalists still mistrust each
other years after much of the mainstream has abandoned its anger
against formalism.   I think that the 1% or 2% difference is a
crucial one and is, as Mike points out, a matter of recognizing and
foregrounding the materiality of the signifier, of respecting the
artifice of form and not trying to naturalize or normalize or
fetishize it or use it transparently.  ( A personal note--I am
relieved by this turn of events since I have for years been dubbed a
"new formalist" because I chose to be challenged most deeply by old
forms a decade ago, but have always felt that my project was at base
an exploratory one.  Maybe finally there are emerging categories that
make sense).  It's just a 1% ot 2% difference that distinguishes a
substance as poison from the same substance as medicine.  But we all
feel it when we see it.

PS  Using the ghost of Swift to attack the New Formalists seems a bit
self-defeating.

Lyn Hejinian asked me to forward this appeal to the list.

----------
It is well known that poetry is the least financially-rewarded of the arts,=
 and that, unless they can find other sources of employment or are=
 independently wealthy, poets live on the economic margins; should an=
 emergency arise, they are vulnerable to its worst effects. To respond to=
 such emergencies, the Poets in Need fund, a non-profit organization, has=
 been established. Donations to it are tax deductible. The official=
 statement of purpose of Poets in Need is as follows: Poets in Need is a=
 non-profit organization providing emergency assistance to poets who have an=
 established presence in the literary community as innovators in the field=
 and a substantive body of published work. Assistance is given only in cases=
 of current financial need that is in excess of and unrelated to the=
 recipient's normal economic situation and that is the result of a recent=
 emergency (due, for example, to fire, flood, eviction, or a medical=
 crisis). The organization is run by a Board of six members. They are=
 Michael Rothenberg, Leslie Scalapino, Norman Fischer, Lyn Hejinian, Suzi=
 Winson, and Hal Bohner.

The organization is currently fundraising. Checks can be made out to Poets=
 In Need and mailed to Lyn Hejinian, Treasurer, 2639 Russell Street,=
 Berkeley, California 94705.

It is interesting to me that the most blatant thing
you found in either Funkhouser's or Nudel's email
was this misuse of Dr. Williams' language.
I find it very peculiar that this annoyed you as
much as it did.  And in the effort of defending
Nudel.  Why is that? Why did this bother you so much
and all the other vitreol not at all?

        Did I miss a slur??? Let me go back and look. I mostly like his
rantings as
its fun. But I in no way uphold bullshit. I did witness Chris blatantly
misuse WCW's red wheel barrow to defend his argument for something or
another.  It came from a direct misunderstanding of general poetic knowledge
which is directly responsible for the art he creates. This just irked me and
to see his quick response in another form of what I perceived as another
form of snuffing out creativity - well I just shot back. I should have
looked further into what m&r had to say. Thanks for pointing out racism,
which I will never uphold as art!

Patrick, I most certainly agree with Murat.  For me, your list sends a simple
and sensible message, i.e., that there are no "proper" reasons for enjoying
poetry -- anything will do if it gets you home.  Case closed.  Best to all,

i meant not to indicate that these twelve things are all routes to pleasure.
quite the contrary.  in and of themselves, these twelve reasons for reading
poetry have *nothing* to do with pleasure, unless of course the term
"pleasure" is rendered trivial (in the logical sense) and then each item is
reduced in accordance with the trivial definition.  Not only are these
things not necessarily routes to pleasure, they are certainly are NOT
pleasurable in and of themselves.  I frankly do not see how sorrow could be
pleasurable.  That just makes no sense.  I expected someone would do render
my 12 points to the point of triviality reducing each one to pleasure;
michael did that, but in all earnestness. I thought at first he was making a
joke; when he revealed he was serious, i was actually startled.

I think this term "pleasure" has been rendered trivial by so many people
around here except perhaps aaron belz.  thanks aaron, thanks for letting me
know i'm not nuts, that people can be pretty complicated, that it may not be
just my imagination.  i think i was making a simple point but perhaps many
are unwilling to accept that it is entirely possible for people to do things
for reasons *other* than rewards/pleasures.  such a theory of behavior and
motivation seems overwhelmingly reductionist.

actully, one could argue that ALL things are done to:
preserve DNA
preserve the initial concentrations of chemicals in the primordial seas
(inside our cells)

at least these theories have something to them,  other than, "well you do x
for pleasure, because everything you do is for pleasure."  egardless, i want
evidence!!!

and richard, i misquoted myself .  the line should read:

thanks murat.  you got exactly what i was trying to do, open up things, move
them past "people act only for pleasure" stuff.

i mean have any of you ever done anything FOR LOVE?  not everything done for
love is done for pleasure, i can assure you.  "oh down the road the pleasure
comes," blah blah blah.   sometimes altruism that costs a person  is
possible.  and heck, how can we be so sure we are ther in the first place?
oh boy, i'll spare y'all.

Hi Richard.  Stein's "general political outlook" was perhaps toward the right
(by today's standards), judging from her writings, especially the sections on
the war in Alice B.  Her statements that writers should focus on the sentence
and not the paragraph, that paragraphs were vehicles for emotion while
sentences were not, also suggests a certain puritanical streak in the author.
 All this is, in fact, pretty general, I admit.  She did, we should not
forget, live off a series of family investments which meant she never needed
a "real job."  This, quite obviously, enabled her to buy paintings by up and
coming artists (like Picasso) which in turn led to what may be the greatest
example of networking anywhere, anytime.  She certainly believed in a firm
aesthetic/social/political sympathy between the USA and France.  When friends
of hers wondered aloud if America would support France or Germany in the war,
she staunchly defended America's sisterhood with France.  Unfortunately, she
also (like so many of her now famous friends) evinced certain suburban
prejudices, particularly on the subject of race.  At one point in Alice B.,
she writes (I'm paraphrasing) that the black culture is not so much primitive
as it is unredeemably narrow.  Again, by today's standards, such attitudes
are "a droite."  Her sexual politics were no doubt considered quite radically
liberal for her time.  I think I agree with you that her general outlook may
have been naive.  Her views of human psychology were most certainly an
oversimplification.  None of this, of course, alters her claim as a major
innovator.   Best, Bill

Annie has me thinking again about this issue.  If anyone would like a copy
of the conversation between my brother and I to which she alludes (the
first in a series of "COMBO x/tras") I'd be happy to send it along free of
charge.  I don't have time just now to elaborate, but I thought it might
be useful to provide an example.  I don't have any interest in what *most
often* gets characterized as New Formalism.  Nor am I looking to build any
bridges *or* start any fires - - I'm just trying to keep my own poetry
open to various possibilties and keep in dialogue with the poets I know
and/or like.  Having mentioned Ostashevsky, Mohammad, Sardinha, (as well
as Sharma, Mlinko, Jagannathan) here's, perhaps, an earlier precedent for
the sort of rhyme I'm interested in, from Zukofsky's "29 Songs":

Now, one might appropriate something more regular, say, not unlike Donne's
quatrains in "The Ecstasy," but I'm interested in situating it so it
feels, as it does in Mohammad's work, more like Zukofsky.  Perhaps that's
the interesting new development.  Wish I could say more, perhaps soon.

I was struck by the news report lead sentence which read something
like "Timothy McVeigh died today unknowingling staring into the eyes
of OK City bombing survivors who watched through a hidden camera
mounted in the ceiling..."

how do they know it was "unknowingly?"

and the strange dissatisfaction engendered by this -- that at the end
he got to stare them in the face but they werent able to return the
stare -- thus it must have been "unknowingly" -- and an odd parallel
to the act he committed: having offed 150+ people without looking any
of them in the eye, the ultimate act of cowardice, he wd be offed by
the will of the masses w/out any of them looking him in the eye...

hence the fascination w/ his face... the need to draw some kind of
relief from that... the utter inability to do so.

Subject: McVeigh's face


Hi All,

Kevin (Killian) and I were in Indiana when Timothy McVeigh was
executed. We were staying at my mother's house, where, if one got up
early one was forcefed incendiary talk-radio.  Imagine making your
morning coffee to the voice of Dr. Laura.  I usually skirted the
issue by sleeping until 10, when Martha Stewart was on TV and the
radio was turned off.  Coffee with Martha was fine, learning how to
make handbags decorated with the impressions of weeds dipped in
paint, etc.

But, we were flying back to SF the morning of McVeigh's execution,
and thus, the talk-radio was on.  It was mostly pro-execution.  One
Chicago broadcaster was actually calling McVeigh the McMurderer.

So, when I got back, I read the online reportage in the New York
Times, and there was a very interesting passage about people
struggling to interpret McVeigh's face as he was dying.  It reads
like the beginning of a Roland Barthes essay:

>As the witnesses to the execution spoke through the day, their
>jarringly different descriptions offered a lucid but unexplored
>commentary about the power of the camera. The two network
>journalists chosen by lottery to watch, Byron Pitts of CBS and
>Shepard Smith of the Fox News Channel, were careful not to read
>anything into Mr. McVeigh's expression. Mr. Smith was especially
>nuanced in reporting that Mr. McVeigh's skin had turned yellow and
>that he had seemed to die painlessly; yet Mr. Smith was rare in
>remaining so astutely aware that each witness would read the event
>differently. As Paul Howell, whose daughter died in the bombing and
>who was also a witness, said, "We didn't get anything from his face."
>
>But many family members who watched on closed circuit television in
>Oklahoma City saw something else. After seeing images from a
>stationary camera above Mr. McVeigh that stared into his face, they
>said things like "We saw hatred" and "It was like I was looking at
>the face of evil."
>
>That lesson about the camera seemed willfully lost on the
>commentators, even when they noticed it. On the Fox News Channel,
>John Gibson rhetorically jumped up and down after a woman who had
>watched on closed circuit said it was "a slap in the face" when Mr.
>McVeigh turned his head away. Mr. Gibson, inflammatory as usual,
>didn't spend time wondering whether the people watching thousands of
>miles away were imposing ideas on an image they could not truly come
>close to.

For most of us, or at least for me, the rejection of the New Formalists was never a rejection of form, let alone new forms -- maybe not even new formalisms -- What was detestable was the presumed undebatable accompanying polemic that held Modernists responsible for rejecting the very stuff of verse/poetry -- This argument required a willful a-historicism -- deliberate ignorance, for instance, of Pound's expertise in matters of form, Zukofsky's, the new modes of Moore, Stein, Williams,,,,, and a refusal to credit efforts with novel forms, or even such retrievals of neglected forms as practiced by Oulipo --

though the worst thing about the major proponents of New Formalism was an evident inability to count!

Jim has put his finger on a key trait of academic propriety, though I
myself do not make the contrast with activism on the street.  I find such
activism as fraught with treachery as dealing with academics  Why?  Because
the psychology of fascism has so deeply infected all social classes in this
society, members of all classes are militantly arrayed against the
penetration of critical thought into their worlds.  It comes under one
guise in academia, under another in different spheres.  Just to give you
one example that still has me steaming: yesterday I was sitting around
drinking coffee with some black women.  In the course of conversation, I
made a strong attack on the DC police officers who recently strip-searched
a number of black school kids in the course of a field trip to the City
Jail.  Do you know that all but one of these black women defended the strip
searches, and went on with their predictable defense of the
spare-the-rod-and-spoil-the-child philosophy that I've heard a zillion
times since I moved down south?  This is barbarism, and it is a barbarism
that demonstrates how deeply committed people are to their unfreedom.  As
for my alleged loyalty to the working class, I find it, to say the least,
rather difficult to deal with people under such conditions.  I do not
pander to people in order to win their favor, no matter who they are.

However, the academics are the last people to defend any intellectual
standards, as they have no intellectual or ethical standards to
uphold.  They are part of the Matrix, and all of their pretenses at
politics effectively reflect the containment strategies at work in the
milieu into which they are socialized.

I must add that this newcomer really pissed me off when he said he came in
search of an academic list.  Then when he found it was not sufficiently
academic, he went to the administration to squeal.  This is how all
academics behave, with few exceptions.  Had this fellow mentioned he was in
search of an INTELLECTUAL list, I would have sympathized with his
frustration.  But he sought out an ACADEMIC list, suggesting what a timid
little toad he really is.  An intellectual list is not an academic list;
the two are mutually exclusive.  Academia exists to contain and restrain
intellectual activity.  Of course I think people should get paid for
intellectual work, and it's mighty hard to do in your spare time, though I
know independent scholars who have worked miracles.  But if you are going
to be in it, as you have every right to be, then you must understand you
are in the enemy's camp.  And if your intellectual output is crap, then you
are a traitor to your calling no matter how political you think you are, no
matter how many embassies you get arrested in front of, no matter how many
petitions you sign, no matter how many picket signs you hold up.  You
cannot be a team player and be an intellectual.  A critical intellectual is
never ever a team player.  And an intellectual never seeks
collegiality.  The nature of critical thought is that it is utterly
ruthless; it knows neither friendship nor fellowship; it is free,
independent, and absolute.

It was Adorno who called the cops in the 60s.  One must remember though,
that the 60s activists were not very bright, not in the USA
anyway.  Germany I don't know.  But that cohort was not all that
intellectually sophisticated.  Perhaps that's why they were defeated so
easily.

Turned as well from crazed and lunar night? Nay, were a literal moment in
some crazed transcendent metaphysics... Increasingly crazed; my loftspace
will be one and one, or one against another. The clock is crazed, and I
wait for hetaDburnoma74:crazburnotail. Random capitalization implies
pastiche, pasting, crazed breath and simulacrum of the crazed. One can
only imitate so far, before the Real takes us. We snuggle together and

Annie. I got a bit carried away at the time I wrote that maybe wanting some
feedback which you've given. I since thought: why an I so vehement (if i am
re New formalism?) maybe equated it with a kind of reactionary thing, or a
turningback...but as you say the whole question is more subtle. A very
interesting email. Warm regards, Richard.

Dear Geoffey,

I'm grateful to know what you were referring to in your last message re:
WCW,  & appreciate your criticism on this matter as well (& am provoked to
offer an explanation).  I don't know how much background is needed here, but
clearly the event you are referring to is the 9-way mind performance at
Hallwalls during the e-poetry 2001 festival in Buffalo.  I know people were
irked by various aspects of the show-mainly that it went on too long (about
61 minutes) at the end of a full day of conferencing-though I can believe
that some were put off by some of the content as well; obviously you were!
At least 1/3 of the audience had left by the time we finished, which was
perfectly OK esp. since after 45 mins. of our set we invited people to leave
if they wanted.  Anyway, since it has come up, let me explain what was
happening.  The segment of our performance that you take offense to is a
Simultaneity (a la Mac Low) constructed by Don Byrd.  There are three
different texts involved:  one is Don's poem "The Greatest Show on Earth", &
two collaborative pieces written online by the group ("April Fool's Day jam"
& "Bots Arise").  Group members were assigned to read each piece in unison,
then at the end improv (or sample) fragments from any of the pieces.  I
think I was reading from "The greatest Show on Earth" (& can't remember why
he wasn't reading it, or even what he was reading), which goes:

Once upon a time and far away, Gertrude
Stein, William Carlos Williams, Ezra
Pound, Hilda Doolittle, and James Joyce
Set sail in a beautiful pea-green boat, a pea-
Green boat on a timeless sea.

And let's say,

Not
A damned
Thing
Depends
Upon the
Red
Wheel barrow
Glazed
With rain
Water
Nor upon
Those
Damned chickens

And there are
No ideas
In tings
Dings
Rings
In pea-green boats

The undergraduate, back during the Cold
War, said the Red wheel barrow was the
Russians and the white chickens were the
Americans, and the Americans had better
watch out or they'd get run over in their
ideas and things.

I am not going to be run over to day or die.
I am going to write this poem instead,
This poem;

I am not going to die today;
I am going to write this poem instead.

and how will I know it's a poem,
if it doesn't whine or sigh,
if it doesn't jog-trot
or sing-song like those newyorkpoets

later I might record it and screw around
with its digits
until I can't understand a word I said

I might tear
into four parts
And call it
my first symphony

But that hasn't happened yet

I am still writing this poem

Still an interesting time is coming
When I will (or won't)
screw around with the poem's digit

And at some point if I do
I almost won't be able to understand my
words
and I will or won't still be writing this
poem then.

The truth value
And the temporal character of the previous
passage
Will suffer a curious and beautiful upset.






One way to express the idea of entropy
Is to say that
More is forgotten than remembered.


What was ironic about me reading this piece (that becomes mine only in voice
and moment) in mid-April is that I had just been teaching the Objectivist
poets in my cultural history class (20th century world) at NJIT a week
prior.  I played them a recording of Williams reading "The Red Wheelbarrow"
(in '55) & spent a lot of time discussing the poem, having different
students recite it, interpret it, and so on.  Most of them couldn't really
grasp it.  Nothing about USSR/US politics came up in the discussion, and
I've never seen the poem from that angle.  That day, I was seeing it from an
eco-poetic viewpoint, fwiw, and the discussion was exciting.  I am well
familiar with the poem, been reading Williams since college & was really
lucky to have been in a seminar with Ed Sanders in '86 where he spent at
least an hour coming at that poem from many directions, scanning it, singing
it, picking it apart.  Anyway, back to the present where I actually think
Don's quip is funny, and does say something about e-poetry (& the larger
culture it is a part of).  Call it a duality, but I had no absolutely no
problem vocalizing the words/ideas therein (maybe this is a little bit like
Elton John singing all those love songs to women in the 70s).  So much
depends upon a *lot* of things at this point, in terms of art & humanity.
Sure "the red wheel barrow" (in form and substance) is still somehow a part
of all of it but if we don't get to other important realities, isn't
Williams' sentiment practically relegated to quaintness & possibly total
annihilation?  For worse or better what we saw at e-poetry was a far cry
from Williams' big little poem.  Anyway, we/I weren't trying to irk you or
anyone else, just raising the possibility & question, checking in with an
alternative view.  What I regret having done, now that you mention it & I
remember it, is to make it in to somewhat of a mantra, there was perhaps no
need to have the phrase repeated several times during improv sections of the
set.

I do wish my general poetic knowledge were more intact; it's hard for me at
this point to see things in one (or even three) dimension(s)!


Enjoying the conversation, from station to station, & other
threads here as well.

As for Nudel, who knows....

Did I miss a slur??? Let me go back and look. I mostly like his rantings as
its fun. But I in no way uphold bullshit. I did witness Chris blatantly
misuse WCW's red wheel barrow to defend his argument for something or
another. It came from a direct misunderstanding of general poetic knowledge
which is directly responsible for the art he creates. This just irked me and

to see his quick response in another form of what I perceived as another
form of snuffing out creativity - well I just shot back. I should have
looked further into what m&r had to say. Thanks for pointing out racism,
which I will never uphold as art!

I really could not care for any passive aggressive pseudo-subtle ad hominem
at this point in time.  "mindlessness"?  how about being mindful of that
which you *cannot* be mindful of?  that's the point i tried to make.  i can
assure you i was not disavowing my own personal responsibility, Mr.
BenYuhmin.  not everyone is a confessional poet and/or writes like one.  you
don't know everything (I hope that's not ad hominem!), especially about the
universe, the self, to go writing off all possibilities except that of
pleasure-seeking.  you completely eliminate the possibility for
selflessness.  altruism.  deep-rooted suffering.  loss of control.  mental
illness.  accident.  there are more things....

and i can't equate egocentrism with any form of spirituality, or poetry, for
that matter, except for that secular spiritualism in america known as
"compassionate conservativism."  <sarcasm>but them i'm just one of those
damn bleeding heart pinko liberals always blaming everything else for my own
problems.</sarcasm>  ugh.  oh and <sarcasm>people with (problem x) just need
to get over it and pull themselves up</sarcasm>.   double ugh.  perhaps the
world is not all in our heads, or perhaps we don't have heads.  or yes,
perhaps i've lost mine.  i've considered that before.

By the way, what's with the "Reuven BenYuhmin" alias, Mr. Robert Front?  I
find this very interesting indeed.  Though I think your real name, given
your own alter ego, is straight out of a Pynchon novel.  Bravo!

Richard,

Have reread & meditated on your long post before responding & so the delay.
My most sincere comment on your poem "The Red" and "Summer Sonata"  is a
counter question. The same question I ask students: did you really get into
it, did you thoroughly enjoy the creative process while engaged in it, did
you rush back to read it over the next morning,  do you still get off on it=
,
& does it continue to inspire you. & if all the answers here are =B3yes,=B2
then, surely you=B9ve done all you can do &  gotten all you can get , the
enjoyment, the  excitement, as well as that refined & most rare delight of
inspiration -- the electrical thunder wrought by the poetic  potential.

Each poem. A beginning, always a beginning, Though it would like to point
towards something more, every poem only means itself. They all end up as
words written down on paper, or canvas, or on a wall, or on a computer
screen (unless they=B9re performed, & if so should be viewed & reviewed  as
akin to theatre). Composed from letters & words & their  spaces they  only
point to other words. Noting more nothing less!

Poetry derives its quintessential power from the potency of its words &
their calligraphic or typographic transcription.  Always stop there, I say.
Not who wrote it.  Not what  s/he says it means. Not how it fits into some
oeuvre (this, often used as an excuse for the bad poems that highlight the
good ones, the awkward, unfit poems that were transitional, all the  so to
speak =B3failures=B2 that could well have been deleted). Why does every word
that someone writes have to be printed, or posted, to be read by everyone
unless the ego has become so swollen & engorged with its own importance tha=
t
it believes it has incorporated godhead unto itself & feels justified in
compelling everyone to intone its name & read its pronouncements (this
comment can serve as my response to your query regarding Alan Sondheim's
writing-- not whether it=B9s good or bad  but that there=B9s excess, & excess
destroys).

For  the poem as poem. No hiding. No cover.  No refuge. Words out there
naked.  Take any writing & read it over & over, & over, & over again. Does
it still excite, inspire,  enkindle, enliven & awaken the mind & its
imagination,  does it somehow expand consciousness, then it works. Words
that can be read over & over again, without diminution, without disablement
Here, a reminder. This is just an aesthetic, my aesthetic. I acknowledge it
for what it is & what it isn=B9t & am happy & satisfied with it. For me poetr=
y
/good writing cannot be just anything; it can=B9t be boring, or an attempt at
nonsense, or meaninglessness. That=B9s my view & it is not stated in the hope
of soliciting any anyone else's applause. Everyone, as I=B9ve said before, ha=
s
their own shtick.

I dislike excess & being drawn into debate, so some abbreviated remarks tha=
t
me thought might be relevant & helpful in (re)planting this discussion on
more fertile ground.

Some write to stretch meaning to the limits, to extend the horizon of
language. The  syntax & the look of their writing is often contorted,
disfigured, amorphic. Some others who read such writing, mistake the means
for the end & blindly appropriate & re-use the  techniques or ends as their
goal. So a confusion:  some contemporary writing aims to extend the meaning=
,
stretch the boundaries; some mistaking the means as the end, use these mean=
s
as the end in itself & so misread the goal to be meaninglessness ( for
example, Aaron Belz & his recent  comment =B2 Go boredom!  it works.=B2& the
site name he has chosen, meaningless.com. This is not to single him out,
there are oodles of others). Mac Low, Bernstein, Silliman & Co.  might wish
to comment on this drift & swerve which has taken off ( is a take off on) a=
s
a result of  their  poetic experiments.  In any case, those who have
mistaken means for ends, those playing follow the leader, are not  strong,
innovative poets, & so their damage to any public poetic presence (if there
is such) should, in the longer run of things, be negligible.

My own take on  poetry, of the past as well as of the present, is that it
has & continues to be, with few exceptions, a kind of backtracking. The tim=
e
& energy used to build conceptual bridges to confront reality seems an
indulgence & dissipation.  The poet, confronting the elephant of her search
need not follow the footprints backwards & then retrace them again to the
elephant. Formulating concepts about & then returning to the fact of.

comes between
this thinking that
awakened wonder
not wondering about that
it wit hat one
atone wit hit

adding i dears
makes it other
then it is
it is as it is

Raw, uncooked & unseasoned. You, are you  ready. Are you really ready, & ar=
e
you really able to attain subtlest awareness to an extraordinary degree.
Beyond imagery. Seeing things as they are. Did I hear you say, =B3things, why
they  can be seen in any number of ways.=B2  Then take up with both hands tha=
t
enormous sledge hammer & smash to smithereens your darlings, your I dears,
your everythings.

        I read an anthology of these formalists. And the one common theme was the
sexual repression that imbued the poems. Now I can't be sure if this is akin
to the poetry style, which makes sense, or was it the repressions of the
editors. In the end I found that it wasn't interesting enough to pursue. I
see it like this, formal rhyme & meter schemes were set in place to
establish a sense of civilization. The more rules the better we know how to
use our new tool, right. But now we have come to that and shrugged it off.
After Yeats, and WW1, really - it didn't represent the voice any longer. So
if one wants to continue to do it - there are good reason why. But when it
comes to elementary school teachers pointing out what a poem must be then it
just gets plain old tedious.

Best, Geoffrey

Subject: death to new formalism

Interesting discussion about form.  It strikes me that the question
is not "Who wants to be bound by a lot of quite arbitrary rules?".
In fact, lots of postmodern poets do, whether they are exploratory
poets or new formalists.  There is not really a huge amount of
STRUCTURAL difference between the rules of a sonnet or those of a
patterned Mac Low piece or those of Tjanting or Quindecagon.  All
involve repetition of one language element or another.  Ron is right
that "work as diverse as Bob Grenier's and Lee Ann Brown's and
Bernadette Mayer's can certainly be read as a new formalism in the
most literal sense."  The difference of whether a form has been used
for centuries or invented for the particular poem is superficial, and
not sustainable.  All that's new becomes old soon enough, and if a
poet is challenged by writing in an old form that has been tested
over centuries rather than by inventing a new form, does that make
them automatically an aesthetic reactionary?   The examples Mike
cites make it clear enough that the answer is no.  Rhymed couplets
and ballads are some of the most ancient forms, but the poems by
Ostashevsky and Mohammed, not to mention Stein and Mullen, are of the
moment.

Nonetheless, if 99% of the formal DNA is the same--as it is between
us and a chimpanzee--or even 98%--as it is between us and a
banana--there is still that 1 or 2% difference to argue over.  The
smallness of that difference, the closeness between the two sides
insofar as both are excited by language as a material, is a direct
cause of the bitterness of the argument, as in Ireland or Israel, so
that the majority of langpoets and new formalists still mistrust each
other years after much of the mainstream has abandoned its anger
against formalism.   I think that the 1% or 2% difference is a
crucial one and is, as Mike points out, a matter of recognizing and
foregrounding the materiality of the signifier, of respecting the
artifice of form and not trying to naturalize or normalize or
fetishize it or use it transparently in the service of a message.
It's just a miniscule difference in dosage that distinguishes a
substance as poison from the same substance as medicine.  But we feel
the difference.

  ( A personal note--I am relieved by this turn of events since I have
for years been dubbed a "new formalist" because I chose to be
challenged most deeply by old forms a decade ago, but have always
felt that my project was at base an exploratory one.  Maybe finally
there are emerging categories that make sense).
PS  Using the ghost of Swift to attack the New Formalists seems a bit
self-defeating.

Doh! Homer Is An English Classic

We are really excited here at Pavement Saw as the:
- Mullet -- 1980s haircut, tipped for comeback
a word we have been touting for years
and Doh!
have made it into the OED
and are now an official part of the
English language . . .

OXFORD, England -- A rich and colourful language that
has developed over many centuries and which is now
spoken by half the planet has a new word -- Doh!

The famous catchphrase of cartoon character Homer
Simpson has made it into the updated online edition of
the Oxford English Dictionary, published on Thursday.

It means "Doh" is now an official word of the English
language, along with about 250 new entries.

Puritans who will not agree with the editors' choices
can now think them to be "pants" -- as that is a new
inclusion as well.

Inspiration for the new additions to the dictionary
were taken from a wide variety of sources -- from
teenage chatter, the pop music charts and even Bridget
Jones's Diary.

Although "bad hair day" has been around for some
years, it was the neurotic Londoner's use of this
phrase in the best-selling novel by Helen Fielding
that prompted the dictionary to include it to describe
times when things are not going quite right.


OED's Top Ten New Entries:

- Balti -- popular curry dish
- Bollywood -- Indian film industry
- Doh! -- Homer Simpson's catchphrase
- Big Beat -- a popular music trend
- Ladette -- a feisty, outgoing woman
- Mullet -- 1980s haircut, tipped for comeback
- New Labour -- Tony Blair's party
- The Full Monty -- to go naked
- Alcopop -- bottled alcoholic drink
- Six-pack -- muscular stomach


The "planet Zog" is a "place or situation which is far
removed from reality or what is currently happening",
while "singletons" -- also made famous by Bridget
Jones's Diary -- are described as women without a
partner.

Bollywood -- the Indian version of the US film
industry Hollywood -- now also has an entry in the
dictionary.

And the new meaning for the Full Monty that arose
after five unemployed steelworkers became male
strippers in the film of that name in 1997 gets an
entry.

The "full monty" now means to be naked.

Among other new entries is "new man." Originally, the
term was used by the Christian Church in the 14th
century for anyone spiritually renewed but now it
refers to a man in touch with his feminine side.

Going to discos is now officially called "clubbing."
And to do that you need to have "street cred" -- a
desirable reputation.

There is good news, too, for shopaholics as
"shopaholism" -- or "shop 'n' roll" - is officially
recognised.

Shopaholics looking up "retail therapy" can now claim
with confidence that what they do is in fact a
therapeutic experience invented in the U.S. in 1986 --
known as "conspicuous consumption" or "shopaholism."

The concept of "lifestyle drugs," or pharmaceuticals
that aim to make people's lives happier or more
comfortable -- though not necessarily relieving or
curing a serious medical condition -- is another
entry.

Hot potatoes
"Serial monogamy" is also acknowledged as an official
lifestyle, reportedly the most common way in which
young people in the 1990s conducted their
relationships.

"Once a word has been used a certain amount of times,
appeared in print a certain amount of times and has
become current, it is entered into the dictionary,"
OED spokeswoman Claire Pemberton told CNN.

They range from political hot potatoes such as 'GM
foods', 'human BSE' and the 'postcode lottery,' to
cultural icons such as 'Bollywood,' the 'mullet
haircut' and Homer Simpson's "doh," another
spokesperson added.

The dictionary's editors have spent the year sifting
through popular culture for words that have become
popular.

"My job is the perfect excuse for watching action
films, soaps, quiz programmes -- where the language is
busy right now," said chief editor John Simpson.



Be well

There are several new features in development at the durationpress.com
website. Most are completed & on-line, others will be appearing over the
next few months...

New bookstore section: This section currently features a new e-books section
with downloadable (for free) PDF files of contemporary poetry & poetics. The
first book is Patrick Durgin's SORTER. The bookstore will, in coming months,
feature an extensive listing of books by poets from Germany & France with
direct links to ordering information from online bookstores amazon.fr,
bol.fr, & bol.de (all of which ship overseas...& which have all been
extremely reliable).

New additions to the out of print archive, as well as a reformatting of the
texts previously available. All texts in the archive are now available only
as PDF files (in order to preserve the formatting of the original
documents).

The international poetry section has been reformatted. This section features
biographic & bibliographic information on numerous contemporary
international poets. This is an ongoing feature of the site & is constantly
updated.

An in-progress list of my favorite books at the moment, with cover images, &
back cover blurbs.

Features currently in development: a monthly column featuring rotating
contributors; an exhibits section which will highlight the work & careers of
various international poets (the first, coming late Fall, will be dedicated
to Edmond Jabès); &, again, the French & German bookstore.

Enjoy.

Happy Bloomsday, list (even though this will be late
by the time it's posted)!

I am looking for book suggestions for a fall writing
course I want to teach focusing on American youth
subcultures.  We'll be reading plenty of articles and
non-fiction accounts, I'm sure, but does anyone have
suggestions of fairly recent novels (or poetry
collections) which deal in-depth with a certain
subculture?

I am looking for, you know, goth/punk/rave stuff, but
I'm particularly interested in finding accounts of
subcultures which DON'T revolve around middle-class
whites.  Recreation/sport, regional, hobby-based,
music-based, etc.

Backchannel would be great.  Thanks a lot.

For a class I will be teaching, I'd be grateful for any film titles that =
portray/dramatize/ficitonalize the lives of poets (in major-- or even =
minor roles with a fair amount of onscreen time)--esp. 20th century poets. =
Films like The Bell Jar... but what else? Many thanks!

Writers Forum Workshop Saturday, 16 June 2001

Writers Forum met yesterday, as it has every few weeks for half a century,
in one guise or another.

In the 70s they were called _The Experimental Workshops_ at the then
National Poetry Centre, seeking to concentrate on sound one week, sign the
next and performance the next. Those of us who cut our teeth there played
merry hell with that agenda.

The workshops also go by the name of _Bob's workshop_ and _Cobbing's
workshop_

Many have been involved over 5 decades, but the one remaining constant is
Bob Cobbing, now in his 81st year. & he was there yesterday. He convenes it
and he chairs it though without any overt movement!

There's something of a Quaker meeting about it, the perhaps embarrassed
quietness before and between performances, the intensity of attention, the
good humour and good will.

I say performances, and sometimes they are, but they are often in a real
sense performance experiments and tests...

Some of the contributions yesterday were as follows.

Sean Bonney performed new sections of his _Heresy_ book, still very much a
work in progress; and some prose pieces which he said himself are unlike
anything else he has ever written

Adrian Clarke read final sections from his election piece i.e. he takes the
election process and news as his subject input to a preconceived form of so
many words a line, so many lines to a page and so many pages. What he does
with that rigidity is spectacular. It's dense and witty writing and I am by
no means clear about it at all; and won't be at all clear, I suspect, until
I have had a chance to hear it several times - and he's still editing and
rewriting - and to read it.

Mike Weller launched his new booklet _Climb a free Weller_ (Writers Forum,
as publisher) with a lively performance which included an imaginative
performance of a page which bore very little more than the letter z in
various patterns. Weller links graphic novels and cartoons, story-telling
and sound poetry.

Lawrence Upton and Bob Cobbing launched a new pamphlet (also WF) by Michael
Basinski, Basinski being in Buffalo, NY: _MOOL3 Ghosts_ , which utilises
characters from a wide range of character sets, except spaces, not just the
usual alphanumerics, in blocks of text.

It gives no indication or instruction on the *how of performance...

Upton read the first page, finding words and near words where they could be
found, finding sounds and or gestures for every printed character upon the
page, working up a sweat. Cobbing read the second page, seated, moving
steadily through, finding sounds for every character, composing a sound poem
on the hoof. Then they made a simultaneity of page 3, each at the same time
applying the method previously employed solo.

Before that, Upton had read about one third of his text _Tyranny_, some of
which has been shown on _Wryting_ and some of which is included in the
Barque Press pamphlet _100 days_

Cobbing runs the workshop without much overt control. Unlike some workshops,
there isn't a post-mortem to find what is *wrong with what is done; nor, for
that matter, what is right. Sometimes people will suggest approaches - I
made a very small contribution to Weller's performance when he said he
wasn't sure how to approach a line - and often people congratulate each
other.

But it is an open and democratic process  and you learn from each other.
Mostly, one learns by doing. Using myself as an example again, I made quite
a few discoveries during my approach to Basinki's poem yesterday; and have
made some changes to _Tyranny_ this morning, in the light of what I read
yesterday: 2 entirely different kinds of writing, 2 entirely different
lessons. It may be that _Tyranny_ is really finished now, and ready for
final publication.

So the workshops enable one to find out what others are up to - a number of
sub voicive poetry performances have been invited in response to what I have
seen there - and they also enable one to experiment in a supportive
atmosphere, to take big risks in a context where everyone understands what
is happening. The ability to perform to a group of one's peers every few
weeks is extremely valuable.

The workshop is open to anyone in sympathy with these aims. As and when you
are in London, if this interests you, contact me or Cobbing to find out when
the next one is. [Usually there is a break in August]

On the weekend of 14th and 15th July there will be a two day event in London
marking the half century of WF. Cobbing's organising it (because the
Offficial Poetry System has no interest) so I can't give you many details -
I don't think he knows it himself yet. There will be an exhibition - this is
at Klinker, a music and poetry venue based in the backroom of a pub in North
London - of WF publications, now well over 1000 in number, and two
performances, one on the Saturday and one on the Sunday

Many are dead now, of course, so the performances may well represent
relatively recent years - I was one or two years old when it started (and
apparently that is a hard moment to define as the activities and the names
used to designate and market them (Group H, Arts Together, all gone under
the hill now) have changed over the years, separated from each other,
combined with each other)...

Klinker's worth a visit before then, for those who can, because there is an
exhibition of Cobbing's _triptychs_ at present, the earliest being 30 or 40
years old

I used to post reports like this on The British and Irish Poets List but I
am not on that now. In part I did it to encourage newcomers, and that hope
was much greater on britpo than on the lists I am about to post on; but I
also think it is worthwhile to leave some record of what is going on. There
is little other documentation. Sometimes recordings and photographs are
made; but the bulk is unrecorded in any way.

I don't know if this will have been of any interest. Should I report later
events, of course, I would not repeat the background information.

Apologies if you get this twice - I'll send it to a couple of lists and also
to the WF mailing list I run, and which anyone can join by mailing me -
Cobbing himself is not online yet, though that may change soon

 hey, richard,
         who are you calling a 'rather tired old guru' of 'language centred'
poetry?? you watch your mouth, young richard. I maybe old, i deny 'guru' as
would any self-respecting  'language centred' person, and i'd match my
energy levels with yours anyday--if i look tired its because i've got less
than my usual 6 hours sleep. What a miserable account you give of the NZ
scene, you traitor!

Aaron etal.  Well there are 13 from NZ. New Zealand was (and still is
somewhat) culturally and historically hence somehow politically tied to
Britain and from the sixties or mid fifties a shift to the US culture. In
fact Christchurch is touted as being a more English town than any in
England. Its also a place where people of a certain ilk will accuse you of
being "a bloody pom". The England of my affections is, and shall probably
forever remain, in my imagination: both my parents being English.  But the
feeling I get from British or English people is a certain acid conservatism:
mind you these are terrible generalisations...it is also the country that
produced some of the most brilliant thinkers innovators and so on. I think
that the US is so large in size and population that that in itself generates
enthusiasm: the need and the desire to communicate (more).....this sort of
thing can be argued forever.  Its strange that a highly "progressive"
country such as the US still has the death penalty, but then some of the
countries that crit the US are a bit dodgy: places in the Middle East and
parts of Europe and India where ...well: they may have history, and
museums... a friend of mine said once: "Euroe is one big museum".  But the
numbers. Probably there are fewer magazines and outlets in England the UK
that are not dominated by "the official verse culture"...this problem
happenning in the US but simply because of numbers there (albeit a bit
marginalised) more small mags and more counter cultures. It "goes on" you
know in England but probably the critics there are more dismissive of
"experiment".  It pertains here too...Wellington being more clustered around
Victoria University where Bill Manhire (undoubtedly a good poet) has his
"factory" to produce pseudo-modernist Manhire clones who specialise oin
writing boring...well, perhaps I'd better choose another term!...terminally
dull slobber that passes as "fascinating" and "new" while Auckland
University (clustered around a few rather tired old gurus of language-centre
d poetry) are producing ... well at least they are encouraging some
alternative views. Then there was Scott Hamilton's SALT that published
myself, Michael Arnold, Scott himself, Hamish Dewe,Leon Mathews, Simon
Field,Miriam Bellard, Jack Ross, Thorin Kerr, James McGoram, Kenn Mitchell
and Miriiam Bellard to name some in the last issue. It was never meant to be
on going or official. BRIEF which attempts to be avant-garde is interesting
...edited by John Geraets...but there is not much else: a poet called Kapka
Kassabova was touted about because she was attractive and from Romania! She
was described as young and (implied exotic) but writes rather dubious
stuff.One had to hear how beautiful she was before seeing her work!! A
certain Mark Pirie (whose work is terminally dull) sells massively.  So -
apart from SALT - and writers such as myself, Scott Hamilton, Hamish
Dewe,Jack Ross, Michael Arnold and Leon Mathews etc and my friend Leicester
Kyle (whose on his own brilliant  "trip") and last but most Richard Taylor:
the lit scene here is pretty dead.
They keep republishing Allen Curnow - who is undoubtedly a great poet - but
well there's not much else...unlesss you go to the pubs and readings where
sometimes some sparks are seen. But there are obviously at least 13
(enlightened?) lurkers....out there...as to Britain. My mate spent years in
London and apparently it still shuts down at 11 pm like  a mausoleum so God
knows why people go there. My father "escaped" from England of the class
system to make a life in NZ as did my uncle, who from owing ten pounds on
alighting pre the Second WW in this domain, became the director manager of a
large chemical company and very well to do. No hope of that in cold old
England....not the "real" England of my immagination. THAT England is MINE.
I claim it.
   Openness. That's what people lack. Openness and friendliness. Be open.
  Anycase 13 and 19 are odd numbers...there's something odd about the whole
thing. Regards, Richard. PS Mind you I keep re-watching "84 Charing Cross
Road" ("Father forgive me....")....so....

susan graham, there's something going on, well she said,
     look over there, you can see the police cars at a distance,
          well she said, they've got their lights on, it must mean
               something, there were flurries in the air, just a light
               coating
      really, you c
      uldn't see much in the black night but the lights
      looked like
         towns, you'd hear the occasional siren and a
         woman's cry,
              it was heartbreaking, we didn't know what it
              could be, it
       was a mile or so away, the lights were
       swinging above the
        street, flashing as
          well, as if they knew, an
            electrical charge in the air,
            sheet lightning or snow
            thunder,
       there was a feeling of
       danger, i noticed a dark
       shadow crossing
            the street, you
            didn't know what was
            going on, it looked
           all like stars,
           with the

           traffic
           light above
        it all l

        sometimes
        a shadow
        would pass
             or
             the
             sirens
             would
             start up

             the

             town
             moaning
             and

             weeping,
             for
             whatever
             was
             going

             went
             back
             inside,

             another

             the

             slide
             guitar
             mourning,
             for
             the dead,
             for you,
             you

Richard,

Your surmise is not correct as my own electrical thunder comes through
meditation, tantric sex, and Chinese calligraphy, rather then just poetry s=
o
I was not , as you phrased it,"elevating"  poetry,  signaling it out as
ranking higher then other activities that inspire, but surely one of the
many activities that readily offer that kind of "charge." That was not my
intended meaning. Surely,everything one does, if done in a concentrated &
mindful way, has that potential.

Nothing more to say, I've said  what I have to say until I know much more,
then,  perhaps, say something again:-) There's always the mind's propensity
for more proliferation.  I much prefer (here, pleasure again) to incline my
energy/attention  towards subtler states of mind thus leaving such
discussions  behind, seen as idle chatter that hardly matter, a bit
"boring" --  not to belittle it, just where I'm at.

All best blessings on your pommes & poetics,

reuven benyuhmin

Dodie/Kevin:

Apologies for the lengthiness.  A pamphlet-in-the-making.

Some quotes about William Ernest Henley, the poet behind Timothy’s
valedictory, “Invictus” (correct title: “I. M. R. T. HAMILTON BRUCE (1846
- 1899),” a requiem for a life-long friend of Henley’s):

----------------------------------------------------

Tantalizing excerpts, from below:

“LONG LISTS OF UNPRINTABLE SYNONYMS
FOR THE HUMAN ORGANS OF GENERATION”

“THE SWIRL AND SCENT OF APRIL BLOSSOMS, THE BLUE SKY, AND
THE TWO YOUNG MEN IN THE HIRED CAR”

----------------------------------------------------


Buckley, Jerome Hamilton, “William Ernest Henley: A Study in the
‘Counter-Decadence’ of the ‘Nineties’” (Princeton: 1945):

After the end of their friendship, Henley called Stevenson the “Shorter
Cathechist of Vailima,” an “artist in morals.”

“. . . despite its truculency as an aesthetic unit, ‘Invictus’ attains all
the emotional and intellectual impact of true poetry . . .

. . . an inversion of Victorian defeatism in terms of a personal assent.
It proclaimed the militant optimist . . . an Everlasting Yea . . .”


Robert Louis Stevenson’s dedication to Henley’s copy of “Virginibus
Puerisque” (Stevenson was a close friend of Henley’s [more below, on
innuendos that theirs was a homosexual friendship]):


“. . .  this world appears a brave gymnasium, full of sun-bathing, and
horse exercise, and bracing, manly virtues . . .”


Connell, John, “W.E. Henley” (London, Constable: 1949):

Leslie Stephens’ 1875 visit to Henley’s sickbed, while in Edinburgh to
lecture on the Alps:

“I had an interesting visit to my poor contributor.  He is a miserable
cripple in the Infirmary, who has lost one foot and is likely to lose
another . . .  and he has a crippled hand besides.  He has been 18 months
laid up here and in that time has taught himself Spanish, Italian and
German, and he writes poems of the Swinburne kind.”

PLAYED DOMINOES ON THE COUNTERPANE WITH THEM

Robert Louis Stevenson:

“in a little room with two beds, and a couple of sick children in the
other bed; a girl came in to visit the children, and played dominoes on
the counterpane with them . . .  the poor fellow sat up in his bed, with
his hair and beard all tangled, and talked as cheerfully as if he had been
in a King’s palace, or the great King’s palace of the blue air.  He has
taught himself two languages since he has been lying there.”

Connell, on the friendship between Henley and Stevenson:

PASSING THE LOVE OF WOMEN

“. . . quotation is it is usually followed by the observation that ‘thus
began one of the greatest literary friendships which history records’ . .
. It was a romantic friendship, in the strict sense of that term . . . its
deep emotional facet  . . . sides of it which were sordidly practical . .
. its undertones and echoes, its major insistence and its minor
plaintiveness, are a dominant factor in all that either of them, from this
day onward, did or wrote or said or suffered. . . . For between them there
was a strong, bitter, binding love, passing the love of women. . . .”

WHIBLEY TITTUPPED DELICATELY

“Charles Whibley tittupped delicately round the truth about that
friendship when he said that it brought both men something of the warmth
and romance of youth.  Boys at boarding schools pass ordinarily through
this phase between fifteen and eighteen.

Neither Henley nor Stevenson had been to boarding school.

Henley’s awakening affections . . . Stevenson’s brief and transient  . . .
no development of romantic affection with boys of his own age . . .”

BOYS . . .  HAD PLAYED TOGETHER --- UNDER CUMMY

“Stevenson . . .  thought of the men . . .  who had been boys with him as
brothers.  There was nothing in the least exotic about them; they had
played together --- under Cummy’s supervision . . .  He loved them dearly;
but romanticize his relation with them he could not.”

DELICIOUSLY UNEXPECTED . . .  DELICIOUSLY RIGHT

. . . the element of strangeness, of the deliciously unexpected which was
so deliciously right.  Each found in the other something of the
long-dreamed of part of himself, . . .”

NARCISSUS

“. . . the dim Narcissus evocation . . . In the lives of some he never
turns and steps into reality.  Others, looking up from brooding over a
book of poetry, or walking home in the dark after a school match, or
listening to music, are suddenly troubled with recognition and longing.

If it happens at sixteen or seventeen, it passes without losing the
tenuous, fragile quality of a dream.  When it happens on the edge of or in
manhood it is much more disturbing or scarring . . . “

DOOMED AND BOUND . . . MEN, NOT BOYS

. . . the presage of inevitability.  From that first moment they were
doomed and bound.  They were men, not boys; and some part of their natures
made them act and think and feel as boys. . . .”

ALL THE MORE DELECTABLE

“all the more delectable . . . come to them in the time of marbles,
moonshine and pimply necks. . . .”

THEIR LITTLE BOY WAS NOW FULLY  A MAN

“Stevenson, delicate mollycoddle . . . bewildered but loving parents that
their little boy was now fully a man.  Each, agonized by manhood’s
demands  . . . could --- in their friendship --- become a boy again.”

GLORIOUSLY . . . OUT OF SIGHT OF
CUMMY

“Spiritually knickered and jerseyed (and, gloriously enough, out of sight
of Cummy), they would roam and romp and tease and giggle and play pranks .
. . or, halted on the blissful, mist-wrapped summit . . . they could argue
portentously and write each other poems.  They could both be utterly
irresponsible.”

Henley was the editor who printed Wilde’s rebuttals during the Wilde
scandal.  Wilde reviewed Henley’s poetry, calling it

half-Marsyas, half-Apollo.

Connell:

“. . .  the tattle of twilit London . . .

That at exactly this time Henley and Whibley were engaged in the
industrious correction of long lists of unprintable synonyms for the human
organs of generation, in order to help Farmer in his ~Dictionary of
Slang,~ was a fact of which Wilde was unaware . . .

. . . under the pseudonym ‘H,’ which was mistaken for a disguise of
Henley’s . . .”

Henley was the source for the character Long John Silver in Stevenson’s
“Treasure Island.”

He worked on the research staff building the Encyclopedia Brittanica.

“THE FIXED POLE” & “THE FLICKERING NEEDLE”

“His was the fixed pole to which the flickering needle of Stevenson’s
personality was pulled back again and again.

Many years later, . . . after he and Stevenson had quarreled, he made a
sentimental pilgrimage . . . Then it was not spring; and there was no
spring in Henley’s heart, but nostalgia. . . . Henley remembered the swirl
and scent of April blossoms, the blue sky, and the two young men in the
hired car.”

i'm not sure either - it may be possible that
there are individuals who do not seek pleasure
but pain, or its equivelant - i've simply never
met them

that i would agree to - we are certainly
mysterious being in a mysterious world - so then
why *trust* the self that creates language?

i am not so willing to relieve people of the
responsibility for even their smallest acts,
including (perhaps esp.) the reading and writing
of poetry - while we are all "f'ed up", our
reasons or excuses depending on yr bent or mood -
i've never actually seen anyone forced to read
poetry - even in school i often made the choice
simply to *not* do the reading that was required
of me, preferring to follow my own predilictions
-for this i was rewarded with bad marks, which
closed many avenues and opportunities, and opened
up others - this was, for lack of a better term,
a choice

on my planet, people make those

it is not to hard to see that everything an
individual does is based on some notion of their
self perception - the field of psychology is
largely devoted to viewing the self in a more
healthy light so that one's actions might be
altered

poetry too is based on both previous conditions
(the writer's state of mind - literary influences
- cultural influences - ad infinitum)
and the poets concept of self

i would argue that there is nothing in the
universe that does not arise from previous
conditions - time is real, physics tells us this

"everything you know is wrong" creates some
paradoxes (presumably suitable for 1st year
Philosophy students and the like)

personally i like the title of Robert Anton
Wilson's film script for an unmade film "Reality
is What You Can Get Away With"

and entropy

Announcing the following very special event:

Monday, June 25th at 8:00 pm
TED WILENTZ MEMORIAL
Theodore (Ted) Wilentz was co-owner of the legendary Eighth Street Bookshop
and co-publisher of Corinth Books. The program will include music and
commentaries by family, friends, and writers who have known Ted over a
lifetime devoted to books and publishing.

Mr. Wilentz, whom the New York Times called "A Bookman Extraordinaire,"
established the Eighth Street Bookshop in Greenwich Village in 1947, first
at the corner of MacDougal and Eighth Streets and later at 17 West Eighth
Street. The publisher Jason Epstein described the store as "a
bibliographer's paradise," one that inspired him to launch Anchor Books, one
of the first lines of quality paperback books. Mr. Wilentz was a past
president of the American Booksellers Association and, under the imprint of
Corinth Books, published books by Allen Ginsberg, Jack Kerouac, Diane di
Prima, John Ashbery, Ted Berrigan, and many others who frequented his store
and became lifelong friends. Ted Wilentz died in Washington, DC on May 1,
2001 of complications of lung and heart disease at the age of 86.

This event is free and open to the public. The Poetry Project is located in
St. Mark's Church at the corner of 2nd Avenue and 10th Street in Manhattan
and is wheelchair accessible with assistance and advance notice. Please call
(212) 674-0910 for more information or visit our Web site at
http://www.poetryproject.com.

chris i've just sent don a dv video of the performance you speak of.
i got very involved in it since i was videoing it and felt a part of
the performance.
it was a bit long though.
hope you get a chance to see it, it's pretty dark, well it was dark
in there, and what it doesn't capture is the smell of citrus that
pervaded the space as oranges(or was it mandarines) were being peeled.

cheers

What comes to mind:

        Tom & Viv (Eliot. Hated it)
        Barfly (kinda about Bukowski. Liked it)
        Poetic Justice (not really about a poet but it does include some
verse by Maya Angelou. Hated it)
        Mrs. Parker and the Viscious Circle (Dorothy et al. Liked it)
        Henry and June (on Miller & Nin, kinda fun, I thought)
        Il Postino (Neruda. Skiped it)

For a class I will be teaching, I'd be grateful for any film titles
that portray/dramatize/ficitonalize the lives of poets (in major-- or
even minor roles with a fair amount of onscreen time)--esp. 20th
century poets. Films like The Bell Jar... but what else? Many thanks!

In the USA,  maybe, but while Rude Dutschke got smacked in the head by a
bullet, Danny the Red is now a Green Euro MP.  And quite a lot of several of
the current French and German top-gun politicos were sixties activists.  Not
to speak of the line of New Labour sell-outs in Britain, like Jack Straw.

Many things they might have been, but "not all that intellectually
sophisticated" wasn't one.

But then, maybe things +were+ different in America ...

Hello, list.

The good kids at can we have our ball back?
(usually at www.canwehaveourballback.com)
wanted me to reassure the world that they
indeed still exist and soon will have a
new (their 7th) issue--perhaps by this
weekend.

When this fine 'zine reappears, I'll let
you know.

Take care.

Agree or disagree, but it has been said that one of Bob Dylan's greatest

or rather in the seemingly felt perception of it?  Best, Bill

Dear list

               I have to apologize for violating the privacy of a fellow
poet on this list. I responded publicly to a private email. This was in
bad form and I apologize fully for this. I included this letter to
demonstrate that the correct ideal was pointed out to me my a friend /
person whom I respect as an artist. For a collective list which I shot my
mouth off to ... this appeared to be the most relevant method of calming
the waves, so to speak.

 ... not that I hold anything against Chris Funkhouser, I like him fine as a
poet, performer, and educator but I tend towards Pound's notion of an
accurate report. And it is a poets jobs to know and understand poetics to
disseminate accurate representations of what the poets, whom we uphold,
have said. I do feel that I have a valid complaint against his
interpretations.

               And I can understand the icky feeling that Nudel gives,
               but I
am confident that this is his art and his intention. Whether the act of
pissing on personal boundaries is art I can't answer :) but assume for a
moment that he is legitimate going under an collectivist credo that "the
passion for destruction is also a creative passion" Mikail Bakunin.
               The Baraka post was a form of racist I agree, but directed
towards white America not black. Which is just as ill advised as any other
group, I agree. However, on a re-read I consider this a review of a
performance of the 2 main stream artists. Nudel points out that at 20
dollars a ticket the small majority of poetry fans who can affords this ñ
95% were white. He suggests that Baraka and Cortez are throw backs to
minstrels, which is the same point that Spike Lee made in his recent film
"Bamboozled." Now I am a fan of both, and own collections of both authors.
But, what Nudel is suggesting is along Sartre's quip people turn to
objects when they are watched. Here we have a mainly white poetry
audience of a certain socio-economic background gathered for an event.
And Nudel is alluding that we could assume that the audience and authors
have walked down very different life paths. And this is the context the
post ñ a 95% white audience can feel good about themselves for paying to
watch a radical man and woman accompanied with jazz in a comfortable
environment. Then he comes back to his usual theme of money and poets and
tailoring the performance to the gathering surrounding him. So I see this
post as a throwing of stones to an unusual situation of audience who
supports Baraka and Cortez for whatever reason / title we may bestow on
them. This is a form of racism, and provocation can make for good art in
its way, but this doesn't fit that bill, does it. But it is also not the
thing to which one should associate it with real violent and non violent
actions that take place everyday. This is a Nudel's trickery to get
generally thoughtful people to stop and re-evaluate their setting in the
backdrop of a very difficult living arrangement of people coping with
people who are different than themselves. And that is his creative bent
that I should warn anyone from trying to stop. He reminds me of the funny
old guy on the street corner with the crumpled hat. He screams to the
people all day long but harms nothing. I always wonder how people like
this can keep coming up with this Ö so the end result is that Nudel is
one of ours and there is enough people out there who couldn't care what
we have to say or incite Ö so one telling another what is moral without
placing something with the context of where it comes from and where is
going is yet another -ism which can hold back art from taking place.

Poor old Wystan! Might be useful for Richard to frame
a presentation of the 'Language-influenced' curren t
in NZ lit with a discussion of the recent volume of
autobiographical writings by Alan Loney, who probably
counts as the chief 'guru' of the trend. A
repudiation, an extension? Extraordinary, to see such
an elliptical, dour, recalcitrant talent turn suddenly
to the memoir, to the oldest, the most traditional,
genre of all? And to write more poetically than ever!?
Have you read it Richard?

Cheers

I've been off on holiday so am only now catching up on this thread,
in bits.  Had to jump in as one reductionist who believes that
(properly functioning) human beings can't willingly do anything for
anything other than pleasure.  On the other hand, the pleasure
continuum is very broad, and what Patrick calls non-pleasure would
be in the indirect pleasure end.  I can't give empirical evidence
for this, just say that common sense makes it difficult to accept
that Nature would not make that which helps the species survive
pleasure for individuals to do, and all that does the opposite not.
Etc.  Nor do I think distinguishing between degrees of directness of
pleasure trivial.

http://www.atlanticcenterforthearts.org

I've just finished a residency at the Atlantic Center for the
Arts that I enjoyed so much I thought I should tell this list
about it, and encourage people on it to apply for similar
residencies.  Go to the above URL to get details.

My residency was under Richard Kostelanetz.  I had to pay
to get to the place, but room, board, and the use of all kinds
of terrific computer hardware and software, and studio space,
was free (except for a $20 application fee).  The residency was
for three weeks.  Fellow associates, as we were called, included
Kathy Ernst, Scott Helmes and John M. Bennett, friends of
mine (as is Richard).  I'd personally met both John and Richard
before but not Kathy and Scott, so doing the latter was a big
plus, as was meeting the four younger associates in our group--
and the associates in the only other group at ACA with us, and
their "master-artist"/group-leader, A-1 painter Kerry James
Marshall.

It was probably the best inter-personal arts experience I've
ever had, for I learned a lot about using computers for
doing colored visual poetry--and making movies!  I picked up
a bunch of ideas from the work and talk of the others, and from
collaborations.  (I got to make three new mathemaku with John,
for instance--one of which I like close to as much as the best
I've done entirely by myself.)  I made ten new (single-authored)
mathemaku--thus equalling my entire output as a poet in all forms for
the past three YEARS!  Of course, most of the new works were based on
sketches I'd brought with me.  Still . . .

Very nice Florida wildernessy place, too--with a particularly
good beach for swimmers and sun-bathers nearby.

The center has no advertising budget, so if anyone has any ideas
as to how to give it free advertising, please let Rachel Ward
at the above URL know.  Rachel is also looking for master-artist
recommendations.  Master-artists get a stipend and lots else.

That then asks, what is poetry?  What do we mean by
poetry?  I think the answer to this depends on the
direction in which we read/some psycho-bio readings on
why one reads poetry:

READING 'POETRY' THAT LEADS TO  GREATER UNDERSTANDING
AND/OR TO TRUTH:

1.  Morphous fluid sensory experience like phermone
rush experienced by homoeostatic system (consciousness
for ex.)

2.  The morphous fluid sensory experience abstracted
to precept.

3.  Precept abstracted to sound/word, "phermone rush"
or "crush" or "in love" etc.

4.  Collection of sounds arranged in time to represent
experience. "I felt a phermone rush, an in love crush,
an etc blush"

5.  Emotion abstracted, arranged; while ambiguity
contained so the experience can be imagined as
uncontradictory, and reality not fluid but stable via
poem.

6.  Homeostatic system has abstracted the disruption,
controlled it, reduced its power.  Fluidity of
existence made to seem solid ala experience boxed in
words and stacked in sentences and stored in
paragraphs/stanzas.

7.  Sense in understanding, truth.


READING 'POETRY' THAT LEADS TO LESS UNDERSTANDING
AND/OR TO TOO:

1.  Homeostatic system contains abstracted
disruptions, experience interpreted through language,
consciousness controlled and reduced and housed.
Fluidity of existence seems solid.

2.  Homeostatic system experiences words placed into
off-kilter contexts so that the abstracted
disruptions, the seemingly solid perceptions reliquify
via contradictions and unresolvables in relationships
between parts.  There is no room in which the boxes
are, the boxes are not on top of each other/their
relationship to each other is what?, and there are no
walls to boxes, and whatever is in them spills out.

3.  The contradictions and unresolvables loosen the
denotations and connotations associated with sounds,
words experienced as sound and rhythm.  Sound and
rhythm spill out.  This is all.  No essential thing
inside, just a wave.

4.  Sound and rhythm experienced as morphous fluid
sensory experience, sound wave registered in way
similar to waves of sea or birdcall in prewaking
hours.

5. Other rooms lose the lines and angles that
designate walls, boxes begin to fall off stacks,
relationship between consciousness and outside world
less mitigated by abstractions.

6.  Break in homeostasis.

7.  Sense in sensation sense elation not since
nonsense.


This is my most re: sent mod hell for thanking a bout,
'it'.

Comments: To: rovasax@rova.org

Rova Saxophone Quartet and all--

I've worked on some death penalty cases, and I'd bet that Timothy McVeigh
DID know what that camera was and who he was looking at.

A Spanish poet (Antonio Machado, I think) wrote a proverb that goes:  "The
eye that sees you is an eye/ not because you see it/ but because it sees
you." ("El ojo que ves no es/ ojo porque lo ves/ sino ojo porque te ve."
The original has rhyme and a lot of close-rhyme).  That means on several
levels, but the one I see here is this:  Timothy McVeigh's eyes were eyes
while he was staring out of them; afterwards, just flesh.  In his last
moments, the only action he was free to choose to take was to stare up at
the camera lens; from what we know of his character, he probably WAS
expressing hate (many witnesses thought so).  That may have been  an evil
thing to do, but it's consistent with the rest of his life.  Anyway, I think
it would have been wrong to deny him that last choice after taking away all
other choices.  Also, a better choice (if he made it) than "Invictus"--a
whiny adolescent poem if there ever was one.

Total Eclipse, directed by Polish director Agnieszka Holland, is about the
relationship of Rimbaud and Verlaine. Leonardo diCaprio as Rimbaud, and
David Thewlis as Verlaine.

If you can still get your hands on it, Witz no. 6.1 (Spring 1998) has a
terrific and very humorous piece by Gilbert Alter-Gilbert on "literary
portraits in the movies." As I recall, it takes the form of a catalog of
poetry-related movies from 1990 to 1998, by title, with a few lines on each.

To contact Christopher Reiner at Witz, see the magazines web site, under
the Mags section of the Electronic Poetry Center <http://epc.buffalo.edu>.

See _Regeneration_ based on a novel by Pat Barker,
about Siefried Sassoon going to a mental hospital

the war was an obscenity.

To John and Chris

Thank you both for being dedicated and thoughtful poets and for being real
allies.  It's important to call people out and ask them to own and back up
their sentiments.  It should be done more in the non-cyber world.

Thanks to all who made it out to the first Anti-Reading in April. Please
join Loudmouth Collective on Saturday for the second Anti-Reading at

Tonic ...

For Immediate Release

Anti-Reading

Tonic
(107 Norfolk Street)

June 23, 2001

1:30 ? 4:00 pm

Free

For those that are tired of being read to, Loudmouth Collective presents
an anti-reading of new work by Matvei Yankelevich, Joel Schlemowitz &
Wanda Phipps, Ryan Haley, James Hoff, Julien Poirier, Filip Marinovic
and Ellie Ga, among others.

Following the success of the premier anti-reading at Tonic on April 28,
Loudmouth Collective is presenting the second installment of this
bi-monthly literary carnival. Expect video audio poetry, live typewriter
art, concrete poetry, paperless books, poetry film and flash paper
fiction.

By providing a bi-monthly forum for the experimental presentation of
literature, Loudmouth Collective seeks to re-evaluate the literary
reading as it has come to be known today, recasting it as something more
than an exercise to sell books. The anti-reading couples authors with
the public through intermedia encounters, providing the basis for an
ongoing dialogue between the writer and reader.

Loudmouth Collective is a young, Brooklyn-based press dedicated to
portable fiction and abstract poetry, cultural criticism and sound art.

Hey there.

Could anybody point me to a good, brief account of Amiri Baraka's
moment-of-transition from New American Poet to Black Arts Poet?  (I
know, I know, the road to Damascus conversion narrative is a bit too
simple: I'm looking for an essay or chapter that will complicate it for
me).

Thanks,

MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

unless i am mistaken the word being added is
"duh" which is *not* a Simpsons word - i recall
it being used as a term denoting a statement so
obvious that to suggest otherwise would be stupid
- i remember using it as a child long before the
Simpsons

e.g.

Person #1: You know, the people on the UB Mailing
List are the most attractive and intelligent
individuals to ever make use of the internet.

Person #2: Duh!

Homer's famous "d'oh" (either dough or duh -
ough) always denoted where Homer made some
particularily stupid mistake, or an accident

i suspect that the television series would need
to be off the air and for "d'oh" to continued to
be in the common lexicon for a period after it
for the OED to pick it up - otherwise it might
simply be a "fad" word - unless they include
those as well? i am not familiar with the OED
rules for inclusion

i would be all for it - as well as adding the
word "Homer" as a synonym for a really stupid
error as in

"He pulled a Homer."

i suspect including "The Bartman" might be a
little much

"Who Killed Kerouac?" is, I think, the title of a movie I saw. In it,
Gregory says "Who names a generation after four people?"

The Baraka chapters in Mackey's DISCREPANT ENGAGEMENT are a good place to
start.  And Lorenzo Thomas's new EXTRAORDINARY MEASURES has some very
interesting things to say about the USE of Black Mountain poetics by Black
Arts poets (as oppsoed to a repudiation).  -Mike.

Unfortunately for Gregory, the generation was, for a long time, named after
three people.  His own status was certainly "ify."  As his scenes in "The
Source" surely indicate, he was more than a little pissed off about this (his
complaint about not being included in a Jeopardy answer/question is actually
quite funny in a pitiful sort of way).  Thankfully Corso is now getting more
of his due, though it has taken his death to stir the embers (not exactly an
uncommon impetus within literary governments).  I respect a good deal of what
Corso accomplished on the page, and am delighted to see him quoted once
again.  Best, Bill

Pull My Daisy (starring Ginsberg, Kerouac and Corso as Groucho, Harpo and
Chico.  Forget the name of the guy who plays Zeppo.  Plenty of fun!)

Naked Lunch (depicting Burroughs, Jane and Paul Bowles, Ginsberg, Keroauc
etc. at play in interzone.)

Heartburn (I think that's the title, about Kerouac love-triangle with Neal
and Carolyn Cassady.)

Garcia Lorca (about a guy who idolized Lorca as a boy returning to Spain to
find the truth about his murder.  Great flick!)

Hal Hartley put out a great movie a coupla years back about the lives of two
fictional poets that probably doesn't exactly fit your needs but is
definitely worth watching for your own pleasure.  Think the title is Simon
Fool.

This is a canadian film board production that has Rip Torn as Whitman!

Beautiful Dreamers

                   1990, 105 min 00 sec


                   This film can be viewed on site at the Cin=E9roboth=E8que=
 in
Montreal


                   Abstract
                   The superintendent of the London insane asylum, Dr.
Maurice Bucke, despairs of the
                   treatment methods in use during the Victorian era, which
consist essentially of restraint
                   and electroshock. At a conference in Philadelphia, he
makes the acquaintance of poet
                   Walt Whitman. This meeting will radically change his
life, and that of his wife and patients.
                   Whitman, who travels to London at Bucke's invitation,
has avant-garde ideas about mental
                   illness, sexuality, the emotions and life in
general--ideas that are profoundly humanistic
                   and enlightened. This film is based on historical events.

Dear Poetics Folks,
Here are some brand spankin new titles from

They're running a special buy one get one free right
now, so you might want to check it out.

(I tried to kinda hide the shameless self-promotion
aspect . . .)

The Angelus Clock, Edward Foster
100 pages
$12.00

=93Let no one seek [in The Understanding] a secure
sense of self. . . . To have read these poems is to
have entered another self, to have felt the vital

Gentlemen in Turbans, Ladies in Cauls
John Gallaher
Winner of the 2000 Spuyten Duyvil Book Award
Michael Heller, Judge
$12.00

The technique employed here is not so much
presenting the reflected world in its shard-like state,
but a dogged attempt at saying the world as directly
and wholly as possible. By neither pretending
wholeness, nor embracing the fragmented language
as if it were good enough, John Gallaher is producing
a powerful new kind of poem.

She is the author of More Hungry (Voces Puerulae,

Puerulae, 1988), Koi Maneuver (1990), Anime (Voces

The Open Vault
Stephen Sartarelli
$12.00

In an era of mawkish kitsch on the one hand and
mannerist grammar on the other, Sartarelli steps in
with a luminous poetry at once intelligent, exigent,
compacted and of a rare inexhaustibility. In these
lyrics something philosophical, narrative and yet
light withal takes its place among the new
definitions of poetry: =93and by some single spirit
raging in wild unison.=94

Poetics folks, here's the rest of the Summer 2001
Spuyten Duyvil new titles list. If you order any SD
title from the online catalog you get to choose one
title free!
http://www.spuytenduyvil.net/

Black Lace
Barbara Henning
100 pages
$12.00

Barbara Henning=92s Black Lace is clearly written by a
poet. But its prose is straight as an arrow. As third
person narrator and I, Henning pins the cut-loose
characters of this sparse novel against a gray Detroit
dropcloth, connecting them through soul sickness,
helplessness, and a scary, uncontrolled eroticism.
 =97Charlotte Carter

Kaleidoscope 1969
Joanna Gunderson
79 pages
$12.00

Kaleidoscope 1969 is about people in a time of
revolution. It is non linear, inspired by a photo of a
large family seen at the Museum of Modern Art
=93taken from no particular place at no particular time.=94
Fragments from underground cinema of the 60's as
well as that of the Russian Revolution run through it.

Spin Cycle
Chris Stroffolino
287 pages
$16.00

Chris Stroffolino=92s amazing Spin Cycle is written from
the inside out. It engages the world of contemporary
avant-garde poetry as well as clear ways that
Shakespeare can speak in and to that world; it
engages an interest in post-Enlightenment theories
of reading as well as trends in current academic
criticism; and it takes these engagements through
Stroffolino=92s own poetic insides, demonstrating a
strong belief in the power of experimental literary
language and how we read it.
=97Lisa Samuels

The Poet
Basil King
209 pages
$14.00

King=92s art can be viewed on the following sites:
www.poetrypress.com/avec (scroll to the bottom of
the page); www.spuytenduyvil.net (click on Authors,
Basil King);
http://www.thing.net/~grist/l&d/lighthom.htm
(forthcoming) and in Jacket magazine #12 at
http://www.jacket.zip.com./

Little Tales of Family & War
Martha King
100 pages
$12.00

These are more than domestic tales, they give a
spinning feel to the cultural assumptions that are
opened like a papaya to reveal a possibly menacing
clutch of squishy black seeds.

That's right, Henry Fool.  I think the other main character is named Simon
Grim or something like that.

Subject: Basic Webdesign & Other Courses : New websites from trAce :
    deadline for frAme 6 : MiMe

Hi

trAce would like to inform you of a couple of new websites we've recently l=
aunched, the deadline for submitting writing to our ejournal frAme6, and a =
great new course now available from the Writing School starting 16th July.

***Basic Website Design for Writers/Artists: starts 16th July

A course designed for beginners: Basic Website Design for Writers/Artists
will guide students step by step through the maze of Hypertext Markup
Language, webpage design, and going online. Although the course is geared
for absolute beginners, it will stress creativity and experimentation. The
course will offer extended exercises for those students who feel
comfortable tinkering with the basic material.

The tutor, Randy Adams, is a journalist, writer and Web artist from
Canada. He has published a non-fiction book, poetry and articles. He was
the first writer/artist to be awarded a trAce Writer's Studio.

Other courses on offer in July include scriptwriting, novels, poetry,
writing for children, writing about families and gardens, and more

Information about all courses starting July 16th at
http://trace.ntu.ac.uk/school/courses/


***trAce is delighted to be hosting the website of the widely-published
and award-winning poet Alison Brackenbury.

Alison's site has new poems, recently included in major poetry magazines,
at the heart of her site. There are also details of her prize-winning
poetry collections, and links enabling the visitor to buy them online.
Background information is given on the poet's life, availability for
readings,critical writing about her, awards, anthologies, broadcasts, and
newspaper and magazine publication. There are links to a variety of lively
online poetry magazines, and to poetry sites, and an email form to contact
Alison directly.

trAce offers custom website building services and web hosting at a variety
of competitive rates depending on the kind of site you need. Suitable for
personal sites, arts organisations, festivals and businesses. Contact
helen.whitehead@ntu.ac.uk to discuss your requirements.

***The deadline for submitting contributions for frAme6, on the theme Net
: Spirit, is 1st July.

Is there a new kind of spirituality happening out on the Net? Do you get
the sense you're connecting with something greater than yourself? Have you
ever meditated online? Does code have a zen all of its own? What are the
new spiritual patterns, symbols, and icons of cyberspace? Why all these
coincidences, mindmelds, serendipities and downright unrealities? Is this
religion? Who are we online? What do multiple identities do to your head?
What does it all mean?

http://trace.ntu.ac.uk/news/article.cfm?news=3D144



***More stories added to Migrating Memories website

What is most precious to you when you have to leave your country? What make=
s your memories? It could be an object, a fragrance, a poem or a song, or p=
erhaps the way the sky looks or the wind feels. Migrating Memories, a Europ=
ean Culture 2000-funded project, works with newly-settled people in Malm=F6=
 (Sweden), Tampere (Finland) and Nottingham (England) to address the import=
ance of memory. New pictures, stories -- and translations of stories -- hav=
e been added. The programme for the INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON MEMORY, Mal=
mo, Sweden, 12-13 September 2001, has now been added. You are invited to le=
ave a comment in the guestbook.

Scott & The List & Wystan.   To be fair...now be fair...(be fair
Dud!)...both wystan and I were a bit tongue in cheek...actually the scene in
NZ as descibed by me is obviously more exstensive...I dont think we should
"poor old" wystan wystan. I was making a bit of a joke about the usual
cliches one hears: hence the Wellington versus Auckland thing. A bit of a
simplistic summary by me but the kind of thing one hears eg your friend the
editor of NZ Poetry rages about "academics"....but to be fair (!) to
Alistair he HAS published two of my poems.
  Hey, wystan! Probably you're right about the energy levels, and I confess,
I surrender, I AM honarary British! All along!  My little dream of England
(see in next post my "poem" (or when I get around to it ny "BEGIN AGAIN"
thing that the notorious Scott published in his SALT mag.... which shows my
feeling in this regard))....I am a traitor...fortunately we are not at
war:..
..to diverge  I have often felt that NZ should be towed to Australia and
appended to that vast austere and wonderful land...
  Of course things are better......there are a lot of good poets and you are
one of the best readers as well as I have three of your books and I like
very much things you have written eg on "happennings" and so on as well as
.... well the reality is that I owe the Auckland University English
department a lot and in fact it was there that the lecturers for the quite
excellent "American Poetry" included Wystan Curnow, Roger Horrocks, Murray
Edmond, Michelle Leggott and Alan Loney was there: all of them are excellent
writers who inspired me on that course. To the List: Wystan is bringing out
a new book...which is called "From the Art Hotel" and is reading at Auckland
Wed 6 pm Auckland Art Gallery auditorium Auckland  on the 27th of
June..Wystan can supply the other details.
  Juliana Spahr was very good on the first night with a poem that integrated
or contrasted detailed scientific references to blood type constitution etc
with "human" statements...and she has a fascinating poem in the mag she
co-edits (is it CHAIN?) which uses the image or correlative of the struggle
beween a tarantula and a wasp as indicative or illuminating of human
struggle conflict power relations etc Spahr was the first reader in the
series organised by Wystan and Leigh Davis. The second reader was Ian Wedde
who was interesting...but without seeing his new book I cant comment on
where he's "at" at present....he has taken to writing "trivia" (albeit
enlightened and "meaningful trivia) apparently in the manner of or after
Horace. Charles Bernstein is to be beamed in like Scotty (not Scotty
Hamilton) on  the 11th of July which proves the omnipotence of that latter
personage...so no the scene is better than I painted of course but some
things i'll let to stet.  Everyone's list would be unique..a lot would come
from the Anthology of NZ Poetry...whichever was the last.  a lot are young
students and some "on the outside"....
  Scott...is this something in the latest Brief? My problem with Alan Loney
was not his poetry which I feel is always excellent or at least interesting
but his editorials were always much of a plaint, a kind of mournful song
about being "oppositional" when infact he has had considerable exposure has
been published by AUP has published and so on: if he's on the edge then I'm
vanishing at light speed...but to be fair again as Peter Cooke says to
Dudley Moore re Jane Mansfield in their discussions of  "the worst job I
ever 'ad".. to be fair it probably doesnt matter...Spicer gets it right:
"No one listens to poetry." In the way he's meaning (I think) I think it has
to stay that way.
  Probably my problem with another thing on Alan...or do you mean the
previous Brief Scott? ..would be that its been done and its time to
introduce new writers. Michael Onslow-Osborne might be an emerging "talent"
although I think the most recent poems in Brief were a bit derivative of
LangPo writers...altho I confess its hard not to be derivative in some ways
of something...but I stick to my list of those writers in SALT such as
Michael Arnold, yourself, me, and the others. Jack Ross's book "nights with
Giordano Bruno" is a brilliant first book and Leicester Kyle is always
challenging...has his own style. My addendum here: I think poets will emerge
who are simply unique because they ARE unique (in a sense everyone is) but
we need more intense, inspired, passionate and beautiful stuff...maybe
something that comes from (maybe it already is) LangPo and so on...eg
Kendrick Smithyman's influence versus Baxter's and Alan Curnow'sd and so on
and some of the "crazy" British writers eg Prynne etal and even Geoffrey
Hill and some of the Australian influences that you know about...obviously
poetry and lit is going well here but it needs its resident devil's
advocate...that's my story anyway.

             we  are  strange
             and built from fire

             who stare out side
             with evil eyes

regards to all, Richard Taylor.PS Scott you can do your "rave" about Leigh
Davis at this point! I couldnt or just didnt want to fight thru the Auckland
traffic to get to it.( his reading)...a man earning about $5000 a year to
listen to a man earning probably millions and who extols the wonders of
Capitalism and is valorised by Brief!! Supposedly "oppositional"!! But I
must "be fair".......

Paula. Good on you. It;s strange, but evil or whatever they call it, always
fascinates people. The truth (terrible as it was) of what McVeigh did gets
forgotten...and people  remember the fact that he stared at the camera: it
doesnt matter what Hitler did or caused he is perennially fascinating:
Albert Schweitzer has less of a following. McVeigh thought he was right...in
fact he had to believe it or he would have gone mad or whatever term you
want to use. Regards, Richard.

BEGINNING MY STUDIES

BEGINNING my studies the first step pleas'd me so much,
The mere fact consciousness, these forms, the power of motion,
The least insect or animal, the senses, eyesight, love,
The first step I say awed me and pleas'd me so much,
I have hardly gone and hardly wished to go any farther,
But stop and loiter all the time to sing it in ecstatic songs.

"behind every beautiful thing there's been some kind of pain..."

Bob Dylan

Much of comedy is taking pleasure in pain suffered by others; Chaplin as the
little tramp falling on his ass, Moe nailing Curly in the eyes, Wiley
Coyote, Super Genius, getting crushed beneath a big ol' boulder. Part of the
pleasure of course lies in their elan vital, they all get back up!

Van Gogh refused to paint portraits of the rich ladies of Paris because
there was no character in their faces, preferred to paint portraits of
miners, farmers, etc., whose faces were shaped by suffering.  Artistic
representations of sorrow are pleasurable because they are not real sorrow,
merely a finger pointing at the moon not the moon itself.

I write about Invictus, not McVeigh.

Invictus may be whiny in its high school, forced memorization
context.  But, its fascinating origins shed a different light on the poem.

Wm. Henley, its author, had lost one leg to osteomyelitis at 18. He was in
danger of losing the other when he went to see Joseph Lister.  He placed
himself in Lister's care for almost two years, in hospital all this
time.  Lister saved his leg.  So, it was through this personal struggle
that Invictus was born.  It is also a very radical poem in its period,
since it tears faith from the heavens and embeds it in the individual who
wins through great personal risk via individual struggle. Of course,the
struggle was not entirely individual...there was also Lister...but not God.

Henley is Stevenson's model for Long John Silver.

I have read both the Odyssey and Iliad rather closely.  And I don't recall
Homer ever using any "d'oh" in the text.

Dear Robert,

I say go to the horse's mouth:  _The Autobiography of
Leroi Jones/Amiri Baraka_ tells the tale well.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE:
.
Lyric/Anti-lyric: essays on contemporary poetry
Writer as Critic: VIII
Douglas Barbour
.
Lyric/Anti-lyric: essays on contemporary poetry, by Douglas Barbour, is the
latest addition to NeWest Press' award-winning Writer as Critic Series.
.
Douglas Barbour is a well known Canadian poet living in Edmonton, Alberta.
Lyric/Anti-lyric begins with his well known essay by the same title and
includes a number of his recent essays on the poetry of various Canadian
poets-including Michael Ondaatje, Phyllis Webb, E.D. Blodgett, Roy Kiyooka,
Sharon Thesen and others-as well as some Australian and New Zealand poets,
and one long essay on American poet Susan Howe. Lyric/Anti-lyric brings
together the best of Barbour's criticism over the past two decades.
.
Since first visiting Australia and New Zealand in 1984 Barbour has
developed a growing interest in the poetry of both countries which share a
wide range of colonial and postcolonial experiences with Canada. He has
always been interested in US poetry in the Pound-Williams line, and this
has led to his recent work on Howe.
.
"This accessible collection of essays represents twenty years of Douglas
Barbour's thinking about modern and contemporary poetry. Barbour is a
careful reader who attends to poetry's nuances and responds with the
subtlety of a scholar and the passion of a poet. 'I tend to write essays as
a series of notes,' Barbour writes, 'little travels over the body of single
words, trying to see and hear what I can, and to articulate that response
as accurately as possible.' His readers are fortunate indeed to join
Barbour in his travels through a variety of works by Canadian, Australian
and New Zealand poets."
        -Manina Jones
.
Douglas Barbour is a professor in the Department of English, University of
Alberta, where he teaches creative writing, modern poetry, Canadian
Literature, and science fiction and fantasy. A teacher, writer, critic,
theorist, editor, publisher and poet, Barbour holds degrees from Acadia,
Dalhousie and Queen's Universities. His latest book of poetry, Fragmenting
Body etc was published by NeWest Press and SALT Publishing in 2000.

Hello


I am trying to put together a list of living poets who's work is absurd/
surreal or otherwise humorous.  The aesthetic leaning is toward poets with
some sort of spiritual or experimental underpinning.

Russell Edson is on top of the list so far...

I wondered if anyone might have suggestions.


  Thanks

Let's not overlook the AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF LEROI JONES / AMIRI BARAKA -- the subject is also treated in fictive form in SIX PERSONS -- essays in RAISE, RAYS, RACE etc -- and his own retrospective look at the Black Arts period, now included in updated version of the BARAKA READER -- Komosi Woodard's recent book, while it doesn't really address the poetics, does a good job on the politics and organizing activities of the period --

 There's a film from the 80's called "Ruben, Ruben" w/ Tom Conte --the main
character (a poet) seems to be based loosely on the life of Dylan Thomas
(particularly Dylan Thomas' american adventures)

-- I also remember seeing a film bio of Stevie Smith in that period

Collins Named U.S. Poet Laureate

By CARL HARTMAN, Associated Press Writer

WASHINGTON (AP) - Billy Collins, a popular poet who makes money at the job,
was named Wednesday as the 11th U.S. poet laureate.

Collins can collect $2,000 for a single reading of his poetry and Random
House has reportedly offered him a publishing contract of at least $100,000
for three books.

He also is a distinguished professor of English at Lehman College in Somers,
N.Y.

His one-year post as laureate will net him a $35,000 salary, a Washington
office at the Library of Congress (news - web sites) and few duties except
to give more readings.

Collins, born in 1941, succeeds 95-year-old Stanley Kunitz and Robert
Pinsky, whose project to collect Americans' favorite poems drew the
participation of President Clinton (news - web sites) and first lady Hillary
Rodham Clinton (news - web sites).

There's no problem interpreting Collins' poetry. He has written a sonnet in
the conventional 14 lines but with little regard for such matters as rhyme
or meter. Four of the lines read:

``How easily it goes unless you get Elizabethan

and insist the iambic bongos must be played

and rhymes positioned at the end of lines

one for every station of the cross.''

He wrote one poem about a neighbor's barking dog who annoyed him so much
that he started playing a Beethoven record to drown out the noise.

``... but I can still hear him muffled under the music

barking, barking, barking

... and now I see him sitting in the orchestra

his head raised confidently

as if Beethoven had included a part for barking dog.''

Let's Pour
Coca Cola
On the Priest
While he's asleep!

This day is long
The cherries blossom
Life is strong
And he's asleep!

Each temple garden
Awakes from sleep
The sand is strong
In shining mist.

Let's go, pour
Coca Cola on
The Priest
While he's asleep!

Total Eclipse, directed by Polish director Agnieszka Holland, is about the
relationship of Rimbaud and Verlaine. Leonardo diCaprio as Rimbaud, and
David Thewlis as Verlaine.
See _Regeneration_ based on a novel by Pat Barker,
about Siefried Sassoon going to a mental hospital
during World War I to be cured of his observation that
the war was an obscenity.

Wallis Leslie
The "Life and Times of Allen Ginsberg" is another good film/ poet thing to
see.

Julie Kizershot
antonin artaud acted in many films--such as dreyer's "passion of Joan of =
arc"
and Abel gance's "napoleon"
Cocteau made two great films about poets--"orpheus"
and "blood of a poet"
Tom & Viv (Eliot. Hated it)
        Barfly (kinda about Bukowski. Liked it)
        Poetic Justice (not really about a poet but it does include some
verse by Maya Angelou. Hated it)
        Mrs. Parker and the Viscious Circle (Dorothy et al. Liked it)
        Henry and June (on Miller & Nin, kinda fun, I thought)
        Il Postino (Neruda. Skiped it)
Total Eclipse (Rimbaud and Verlaine -- AWFUL)
The Basketball Diaries (Jim Carroll -- not awful, but not good either)
Gothic (Shelley and Byron -- AWFUL)
Pull My Daisy (starring Ginsberg, Kerouac and Corso as Groucho, Harpo and
Chico.  Forget the name of the guy who plays Zeppo.  Plenty of fun!)

Naked Lunch (depicting Burroughs, Jane and Paul Bowles, Ginsberg, Keroauc
etc. at play in interzone.)

HeartBEAT (I think that's the title, about Kerouac love-triangle with Neal
and Carolyn Cassady.)

Garcia Lorca (about a guy who idolized Lorca as a boy returning to Spain =
to
find the truth about his murder.  Great flick!)

Hal Hartley put out a great movie a coupla years back about the lives of =
two
fictional poets that probably doesn't exactly fit your needs but is
definitely worth watching for your own pleasure.  Think the title is Simon
Fool.
This is a canadian film board production that has Rip Torn as Whitman!

                   1990, 105 min 00 sec


                   This film can be viewed on site at the =

                   Abstract
                   The superintendent of the London insane asylum, Dr.
Maurice Bucke, despairs of the
                   treatment methods in use during the Victorian era, =
which
consist essentially of restraint
                   and electroshock. At a conference in Philadelphia, he
makes the acquaintance of poet
                   Walt Whitman. This meeting will radically change his
life, and that of his wife and patients.
                   Whitman, who travels to London at Bucke's invitation,
has avant-garde ideas about mental
                   illness, sexuality, the emotions and life in
general--ideas that are profoundly humanistic
                   and enlightened. This film is based on historical =
events.

Dianne Keaton plays a poet who publishes in the NYer in INTERIORS; Jeff

"Mrs. Parker and the Vicious Circle" does Dorothy
Parker and the early New Yorker gang...there's a movie
where Leonardo DiCaprio plays Arthur Rimbaud, can't
think of the name but I'm sure you could find his
filmography online.  God, there must be more but those
are the ones which first come to mind.  There are also
plenty of documentaries around about the 60s which
have footage of Allen Ginsberg.  Oh, and "Stevie" is
great -- a biographical pic about Stevie Smith.

SLANT is an upcoming under-grad print magazine that aims to challenge
racism, both personal and systemic. Ten students from the UofC are hoping to
create a space for anti-racist discussion and debate and are looking for
original and thought-provoking articles, interviews, reviews (books, music,
anything!),
 opinions, fiction, poetry, artwork, recipes, jokes, trivia - anything at
all that is engaging, entertaining and interactive!! So sharpen your pencils
and send in something! anything!  There are no guidelines! Obviously, we
want something that falls into our mandate, and "interesting", "engaging",
and "informative" are key.  I know each and every one of you has something
to say, and if you've ever wanted a textual space for it, don't lose your
chance.  The deadline is July1.

 The basics:
 Deadline: July 1 2001

Hello all,

Emerging out of lurkerdom with a couple of queries:

Who has written well about the significance of the poetry reading and
audio documentation in the last 50 years of poetry culture? I know about
Bernstein ed., *Close Listening,*  Michael Davidson's great chapter on
tapevoice in *Ghostlier Demarcations,* and Ammiel Alcalay's recent Times
Op/Ed. Anyone read/written anything else good?

Beyond the Poetry Project, Naropa, and The Poetry Archives at SFSU, what
would you say are the most important audio poetry archives?

Thanks!
Libbie

Very telling that the first two paragraphs of the article, as well as the
fourth, focus on money.  Poetry and money. That's the key, I guess. And I
notice that every paragraph is a one-sentence paragraph. Now that's writing.

Hi everyone!  For "poets in film" you should see the Australian film "Moulin Rouge," I've seen it twice, it is great, the=
 character Ewan McGregor plays is a poet in Paris in 1899.  It's the kind of film some of you will hate, some will love, =
but people in the audience were clapping and cheering after the different musical numbers and at the end everyone stood u=
p and applauded, how often do you see that in the cinema?

And one extra plus, "Moulin Rouge" has a cameo appearance by Australia's greatest pop star Kylie Minogue, she plays the g=
reen fairy on the absinthe poster who comes to life and sings and dances and flirts with Ewan once he is drunk with the p=
owerful absinthe!!  Worth seeing just for Kylie!!!

There's quite a collection of audio tapes at the Poetry Center of the
University of Arizona, which go back to that Center's origin in about 1960.
I believe there is a project either going on, or to start soon, that will
convert those tapes to digital media. The Center is "between" directors at
the moment, so I'm not certain how that analog to digital conversion
project is going. I don't believe the job listing seeking a new director
has been posted. When it is, I'll try and forward that to the list. For
info, call the center in Tucson at 520-626-1185 and speak with Frances Shoberg.

(comes with CD), Adalaide Morris, U. of Carolina Press
1997.

material held by the Poetry Archive at UCSD.

Hello all,

Emerging out of lurkerdom with a couple of queries:

Who has written well about the significance of the poetry reading and
audio documentation in the last 50 years of poetry culture? I know about
Bernstein ed., *Close Listening,*  Michael Davidson's great chapter on
tapevoice in *Ghostlier Demarcations,* and Ammiel Alcalay's recent Times
Op/Ed. Anyone read/written anything else good?

Beyond the Poetry Project, Naropa, and The Poetry Archives at SFSU, what
would you say are the most important audio poetry archives?

Thanks!
Libbie

Dear Poetics List,

Nate Dorward has just pointed out to me a couple of errors regarding my
discussion of _The New British Poetry_ collection in my chapter on
anthologies in _Leaving Lines of Gender_.  Due to a proofing error, the
date of publication reads 1998 rather than 1988.  More importantly,
however, I had mistaken Gael Turnbull for a woman which the biographical
notes at the back quickly dispel.  My apologies to Gael for this.  I would
also like to add that I found _The New British Poetry_ an excellent
anthology and had only wanted to make the point that the four categories
(edited by four different people) tended to create a few artificial
distinctions between writers who did have much in common.

Best,

Ann Vickery

"Life is rushing by like a mad swollen river?"  That's
supposed to be accessible?  Surely only another poet could
appreciate such a brilliantly apt, original, and deep simile.

Censorship at the National Press Club
By Russell Mokhiber and Robert Weissman

Henry Kissinger came to the National Press Club here in Washington, D.C.
last night to give a talk, sell his latest book, Does America Need a
Foreign Policy? and take questions from an audience of about 300 people.

We weren't as interested in the talk or the book as much as the question
period. We figured, correctly as it turned out, that Henry hadn't change
over the years -- his unspoken theory of foreign policy was still the
same: the corporate state -- including his client corporations -- should
dictate the country's foreign policy. As usual, his words barely masked
that reality.

But scattered throughout the ballroom at the Press Club were little white
note cards for questions, and it appeared that perhaps 100 questions were
scribbled and sent up to the moderator, Richard Koonce, a member of the
Press Club's book and author committee.

It was Koonce's job to sift through the questions, pick out some
interesting ones, and ask Henry some probing questions. This system seemed
to work well at luncheon talks, where the past three presidents of the
Press Club -- Doug Harbrecht of Business Week, John Cushman of the New
York Times and Dick Ryan of the Detroit News -- would ask speakers some
pretty tough and newsworthy questions. We never got the sense that Press
Club moderators were pulling punches.

Last night, things changed.

Earlier this year, Harper's magazine published a two-part series of
articles by British journalist Christopher Hitchens, "The Case Against
Henry Kissinger that has since been published as a book, The Trial of
Henry Kissinger (Verso).

Hitchens has drawn up an indictment, charged Kissinger with war crimes,
and is begging some government to go after the former Secretary of State
under Richard Nixon for the killings of innocents in Laos, Cambodia, South
America, East Timor and elsewhere.

Magistrates in three countries -- Chile, Argentina, and France -- have
responded and summoned Kissinger to answer questions.

Le Monde reported earlier this month that when French Judge Roger Le Loire
had a summons served on Kissinger on May 31 at the Ritz Hotel in Paris,
Kissinger promptly left the hotel, and then left town. The judge wanted to
ask Kissinger about his knowledge of Operation Condor, an effort by the
dictators of South America to kill or "disappear" dissidents.

The fact that Kissinger was being sought for questioning didn't make the
mainstream media here in the United States, until yesterday's New York
Times reported that the Chilean judge wanted Kissinger to "testify about
the disappearance of an American in Chile when the dictator Augusto
Pinochet seized power in the 1970s."

Kissinger began lashing back at Hitchens last week, not by answering the
substance of Hitchen's argument, but by smearing the journalist.

Kissinger told Detroit radio talk show host Mitch Albom that Hitchens had
"denied the Holocaust ever took place."

In response, Hitchens, who says both and he his wife are Jewish, told the
New York Post: "Mr. Kissinger will be hearing from my attorney, who will
tell him two things he already knows -- what he said is false, malicious
and defamatory, and if he says it again, we will proceed against him in
court."

So, you can imagine that the Press Club audience had questions. And so did
we.

We wrote down six questions -- about the report in the Times, Kissinger's
interview with Albom, the incident at the Ritz Hotel in Paris, Hitchen's
articles in Harper's, about the three magistrates and simply this one: "If
you are indicted for war crimes, will you defend yourself in court?"

We met a friend there who told us that in the 1970s, when Kissinger was
asked about the bombing of Laos and Cambodia, he responded this way:
"sometimes we have to operate outside the law."

Her question to Kissinger: "How do you square that with our Constitutional
values?"

Koonce had other ideas. He lofted six or seven puff balls about Kissinger
in China, about Kissinger on Nixon, about his generic views of foreign
policy. Nothing about war crimes, nothing about operating outside the law,
nothing about Hitchens.

After the event, we sought out Koonce.

"Was there an agreement with Dr. Kissinger not to ask questions related to
Christopher Hitchens and allegations of war crimes?"

To our surprise, Koonce did not deny it.

"There was a definite sensitivity to that," Koonce said. "He [Kissinger]
was afraid that if we got into a discussion of that, for the vast majority
of people that, it would take so much time to explain all of the context,
that you know, he preferred to avoid that, and so . . ."

And so Kissinger's wishes were accommodated and the questions were
avoided.

We asked Koonce how many written questions dealt with Hitchens or war
crimes? Two or three, Koonce said.

We knew this not to be true. We handed up six ourselves. And we suspect
that there were many more. (Only Kissinger knows for sure, since it's
Press Club policy to deliver the written questions to the guest after the
event.)

According to Press Club standards, these book events must be held in
accordance with the Club's "Code of Ethics."

So, we want to know -- how can it be ethical to agree secretly with an
author before hand not to ask a certain set of questions?

We're tracking down the Code of Ethics. Stay tuned.

Collins Named U.S. Poet Laureate


By CARL HARTMAN, Associated Press Writer


WASHINGTON (AP) - Billy Collins, a popular poet who makes money at the job,

was named Wednesday as the 11th U.S. poet laureate.


Collins can collect $2,000 for a single reading of his poetry and Random

House has reportedly offered him a publishing contract of at least $100,000

for three books.


He also is a distinguished professor of English at Lehman College in Somers,

N.Y.


His one-year post as laureate will net him a $35,000 salary, a Washington

office at the Library of Congress (news - web sites) and few duties except

to give more readings. >>

Really! Poet Laureate only gets 35 thou per year! Jeez!  It's interesting (or
pathetic)--isnt it?--that Hartman's lead is all about money, as if a poet's
good if s/he can bring down $2,000 for "a single reading."  How many for
three readings? A package deal of $5,000? I get $500.00 and change per class
as a veteran adjunct professor. How about y'all?

Oh well. Just jealous, I suppose.

Hey, Ron.

Dove came before Pinsky -- before Robert Hass, in fact -- and held the
position from 1993 - 1995.  There's a complete list of laureates at
http://poetry.about.com/arts/poetry/library/weekly/aa101497.htm?terms=laurea
te  I strongly doubt that the omission of Dove's name from the article
suggests anything sinister.

Hi All, I'm late on this but I didn't take Eileen's comment as an attack
on anything but the idea of "art" as being somehow separate from "life" --
ye olde art=scary or life=cushy or v-v. I didn't take it as an indication
of her class resentments, in other words (and wouldn't be bold enough to
try to define anyone's statements as such), but simply as an irritation
with the ways a writer's life is sometimes framed.

I had a slight problem with the girl culture she referred to, although I
am all for girls, but aren't we all in it together? (shouldn't say that on
this list!)

And on topic here at work, our spt web site is getting spruced up this
summer. I'll let you know when it's up.

Happy 2nd day of summer,

"The offspring of famous musicians often have a hard time creating a career

I don't know how much has been written on taped poetry readings. I was
trying to find a web link to an audio cassette series that I couldn't
remember the name of, couldn't find it or remember it, but did run across
http://www.laurable.com/sites.html , which has a large collection of links
to sites concerned with recorded poetry. And
http://www.poetrymagazine.org/pip_cassettes.html has quite a few.

There's no end of such links if you go to a search engine on the web and
search for "poetry cassettes" or "audio poetry" or such. Those links would
probably take you to the writings you're looking for.

Most of these audio recordings will be bookish, not sound poetry or audio
writing, which I find more interesting and which has been written about more
than taped recordings of poets reading their print poems, but to each her
own.

And, yes, Martin Spinelli has done some wonderful work at the Electronic
Poetry Center at http://writing.upenn.edu/epc/authors/spinelli . You might
also enjoy the work of Gregory Whitehead at
http://search.freefind.com/find.html?id=17493&pageid=r&mode=ALL&query=gregor
y+whitehad at ubu.com.

Also, Helen Thorington produced a series called New American Radio in the
eighties and early nineties (she now does www.turbulence.org), some of which
is reachable from http://www.somewhere.org/NAR/NAR_home.htm . This has some
writings about the art of radio/recorded sound, many of which are by people
with a background in writing.

Hope this helps.

Well, except that I do think the first three on the list fairly
good poets, my impression is that thinking a homosexual poet
should be on it is an insult to the level of poetic accomplishment
of homosexual poets.

What's interesting to me about the list is that, if you take out
Rita Dove, and add Frost at the beginning, since he was long the
unofficial poet laureate, each poet on the list is more mediocre than
the previous one.  McKuen surely has to be next, but who after him?

At UCSD they've got the Archive for New American Poetry, which is hugely
extensive and "important." Before entering one has to wear gloves and be
de-loused and leave a social security card up at the front desk. So, that
must make it important, right? No, really. It's a good archive. They've got a
whole bunch of very compelling Larry Eigner stuff (documents, drafts,
ephemera, signed first editions, etc.) which I worked on when I was there.
There's a great audio tape and a video tape as well (of Eigner). They've got
everybody's number since 1950, and the library looks like a space ship.

South America.  He worked there for 35 years.  See Mariani,

Daniel,

Gizzi says, "William Carlos Williams once wrote 'If it ain't a pleasure it
ain't a poem." Not quite (far as I know). He did speak these lines (?)
between poems in a reading which I heard via Harvard tapes and consequently
used as audio epigraph for "United States of Poetry" tv series.

so happy to see her getting such deserved attn! Elizabeth

Libby:

I attended hundreds of readings in the Bay Area in the 1980s and 90s. A
man named Kush was present at many of those, dutifully audiotaping them
(then later, videotaping). His collection may be limited by his tastes
-- I think more Beat and neo-Beat -- but it still has to be worth
checking out.

Best, Crag Hill

*Henry Fool*.  An absolutely hilarious story, great literary high n low

on the Moulin Rouge front, i thought it was a terrible film....indicative
of a post millenium frenzy gone wrong, a director using a clutch of
scabrous pop-cultural references in a showy, attributive, repeditive
way...the illusion wasn't even palatable, let alone the "plot"...

baz should have stopped at R&J.

I agree with you completely, Bill.  But does beauty equal pleasure, or does
it merely lead to pleasure?  I would strongly suggest the latter, and I
would also add that beauty does not always lead to pleasure.  Sorrow in
itself is painful, but perhaps something beautiful can be seen in the
sorrow, and so it may lead to pleasure, but it is not bound to do so.  As
for your last question "Is there pleasure in beauty, or rather in the
seemingly felt perception of it?" I wish to maintain some ambiguity...my
answer is "maybe."

Thanks,
Patrick

isn't so sinister, but that list of poet laureates in the last 15 years

paul blackburn always brought his tape recorder to readings all over the city, where are those tapes.
Allen DeLoach had a large archive is that in Buffalo?
Allen Ginsberg used his taperecorder like Blackburn and would send tape letters including his new poems to Creeley, Olson, Creeley would occasionally play these tape letters for us. In Canada, Capilano College
has important Duncan Lectures(mothers day, etc.)I've been meaning to mention this to Lisa Jarnot if you see her. Special Collections at Simon Fraser University has a great collection too including Zukofsky. Bob Rose from Tufts and Buffalo I believe sold his tapes to SFU. San Francisco state has an awesome video collection. maybe UC at Davis as well?
good luck wystan.

hiya kev et al --i thot the movie quite over-the-top idiotically good fun,
especially the scene in which kidman is clutching herself orgasmically
crying out "poetry!  poetry!  yes!"  i think i need that clip to show my

is this so? or does it have more to do with who you talk with, what
circles, etc.? here in tucson, in which the 'official' poetry scene is
certainly dominated by a university and its poets, if you in fact dig a
little deeper, most poets in town are decidedly not academics or mfa grads.
they are also not getting much work published (except for a few), except
possibly in very locally circulated journals and chapbooks. they are,
however, very actively involved as poets and in creating poetry
communities. I think that the notion that all poets are academics generally
comes from an academic point of view, and one that privileges certain forms
of publishing and circulation far above others. that said, it's still true
that more poets I work with at chax press have either some academic
connection or at least some very good educational backgrounds, if not mfa
ones (some have that, too). But I think one has to discount the majority of
poetic activity, even if a whole lot of that activity is somewhat under (or
sometimes far under) the radar screen, to think that most poets are
academically inclined.

He's still at it, so the collection must be quite large by now. Last I heard
he was in the process of registering the archive as a non-profit
corporation, which might improve access. Right now, that can be a bit dodgy
(and expensive -- I've heard $25 quoted as his price to dub a VHS cassette).

B/c me if you need contact info, and I'll try to track him down.

I attended hundreds of readings in the Bay Area in the 1980s and 90s. A

Yeah, I felt the same way.  Heard a couple of people rave about it before
seeing it, too.  What a let down.  A nice looking movie but dumb dumb dumb.
Kept wishing he'd chosen to collaborate with Willy Shakes again and that

High court rules for freelancers' rights

By Reuters

June 25, 2001, 8:00 a.m. PT

WASHINGTON--The U.S. Supreme Court ruled Monday that publishers violated
freelance contributors' copyrights by putting their articles in electronic
databases, extending the reach of copyright protections in an online age.

The Supreme Court, by a 7-2 vote, upheld a ruling that the publishers must
pay freelance writers, photographers and artists extra for work included in
online and CD-ROM databases or must remove the material.

The decision was a defeat for The New York Times Co; The Tribune Co.'s
Newsday; AOL Time Warner's Time Inc.; Lexis-Nexis, a unit of Anglo-Dutch
publishing group Reed Elsevier; and Bell & Howell's University Microfilms
International.

The law does not authorize the copying at issue here, Justice Ruth Bader
Ginsburg declared for the court majority.

National Writers Union and UAW Hail Supreme Court Ruling As Victory for
Creators and Consumers
DETROIT, June 25 /PRNewswire/ -- Leaders of the National Writers Union and
the International Union, UAW described today's Supreme Court ruling -- which
upholds copyright protections for free-lance writers -- as a victory for
creators and consumers. Union leaders also offered to begin negotiations
immediately with the publishing industry to develop a comprehensive and fair
system for compensating free-lance writers for electronic reuses of their
work.

``The Court has upheld the spirit of the Constitutional protection for
copyright, which was written for the benefit of individual authors,'' said
Jonathan Tasini, president of the National Writers Union (UAW Local 1981)
and the lead plaintiff in Tasini vs. New York Times. ``Now, it's time for
the media industry to negotiate to pay creators their fair share.''

The Court upheld a September 1999 unanimous ruling by the U.S. Court of
Appeals, 2nd Circuit, which found that The New York Times and publishers had
committed copyright infringement when they resold free-lance newspaper and
magazine articles, via electronic databases such as LexisNexis, without
asking permission or making additional payments to the original authors.

``We're proud to have supported our members in the National Writers Union in
their fight to be treated fairly by the publishing industry,'' said UAW
President Stephen P. Yokich. ``Today's decision paves the way for writers
and other creators to be fairly compensated for their work. That's good news
for all of us, because we all benefit when the legal protections of
copyright encourage the creation of new art, science, and literature.''

The International Union, UAW, has provided legal and financial support for
the groundbreaking litigation, which was filed by nine free-lance members of
UAW Local 1981, the National Writers Union, in 1993.

``Our message to the publishing industry now is: let's negotiate,'' said UAW
Vice President Elizabeth Bunn, who directs the union's Technical, Office and
Professional Department. ``The way to deal with these obligations is to meet
at the bargaining table so we can find solutions that are fair to writers,
to the industry, and for consumers.''

``The NWU,'' Tasini said, ``is already party to a class action lawsuit,
which will enforce the copyright protections affirmed today by the Supreme
Court.''

``We want to settle past claims in a reasonable fashion, and establish a
mechanism so that free-lancers can be compensated fairly from now on,'' said
Tasini. The Publication Rights Clearinghouse (PRC), said Tasini, established
by the NWU in 1993, offers a way for writers and publishers to track the
ownership of copyright, and payment for authorized re-sale of copyrighted
works. Free-lance writers, whether or not they are NWU members, can use the
PRC to license their works by visiting www.nwu.org .

Further details regarding the Tasini vs. New York Times litigation can be
found at: www.nwu.org/tvt/vichome.htm .

The National Writers Union has 7,000 members nationwide, including
journalists, book authors, technical writers and poets. It is the only union
dedicated solely to advancing the interests of free-lance writers.

The International Union, UAW has more than 1.3 million active and retired
members, including more than 100,000 members in its Technical, Office and
Professional Department. In addition to free-lance writers, the UAW also
represents attorneys, clerical workers, educators, firefighters, graphic
designers, health care workers, graduate student employees, librarians,
museum workers, public employees, and many others.

The answer to that (unless you're using poet as code for class circumstance,
which actually might be what things have come to) is-- yes.  Yes, in that
you can DO the work & even publish it in academic channels without being
asked to present your credentials. But speaking as one MFA grad who doesn't
work in the 'profession,' writes & publishes a lot of poetry & socializes
mostly with professors who are poets, & some poets who aren't professors,
the gap between inside & outside is sometimes very strange indeed.

There's a classic book by P.Adams Sitney called _Visionary Film_ which is
about the poetic wing of avant -garde cinema.  You'd probably find it useful.

Re: Moulin Rouge -- I was sad that after the opening
scene, there were very few shots of
interestingly-patterend stockings with clashing
petticoats and Weimar Republic-style creepiness.  I
wanted more "Voulez Vous Couchez" sort of stuff.  It
got pretty sappy pretty damn quick -- just another
drowning-in-its-own romantacism Titanic.  I did like
the Absinthe fairy, though.  And the "Like a Virgin"
scene.  Although how many times can one
turn-of-the-last-century film reference Madonna?

I would like to hear from our Australian/NZ
counterparts on this burning issue.  I am fascinated
by the over-the-top camp aesthetic I seem to see in
all the Australian art house films which get shown
over here -- I am thinking of Muriel's Wedding,
Priscilla, even Holy Smoke.  What's up?

Before Warren's 1987 term, though, they weren't "laureates" but merely
"Poetry Consultant to the Library of Congress."  The LoC published a longish
history of the pre-laureate consultants in a book called _Poetry's
Catbird Seat_ around the time Warren was appointed.

I think the transition from Consultant to Laureate has resulted in more
conservative poets occupying the position, although the prelaureate
consultants were conservative enough.  It would be hard to imagine a
current laureate akin to Lowell, who began as poetry consultant just a few
years after serving time as a World War II C.O.

Given the fact that the Poet Laureate Consultant in Poetry (official
title) is appointed by the Librarian of Congress, how are we linking the
Collins appointment to the Bush II Administration per se? Just
rhetorical/coincidental?

...could be a possible antidotal approach 2 the almost mandatory grounding
of the ozzie
post-convict-primary-industrial-anecdotally-dependant-survivor-and-[anti]her
oically-challenged-mythology that most of the well-known [read:financially
successful] oz films of the early-mid 20th C portray...at the same time
pandering to the quirky "downunder" strand of individualistic character
formation.....mix these and u get a oz art-house industry desperate to
illustrate the charm of [cultural and geographical] isolation and the
"sidekick" drawing card....

just my 2 cents worth.

i must say this makes me proud to be a member of the National Writers'
Union (assuming i remembered to renew my membership which i've been known
to forget to do).  Jonathan Tasini is the president of the union and
brought the suit on behalf of the union and writers everywhere.

I hadn't really looked/listened much to http://www.laurable.com/sites.html
when I mentioned it. I've spent more time with it now, particularly on her
'complete audio links' page at http://www.laurable.com/audio.html . And I
have to say it's surprisingly large, very enjoyable, and certainly the most
extensive collection of links to poetry in audio I've come across. A labour
of love for sure.

I still haven't run across any notable writings, though, about poetry
readings or about tapes of poetry readings. I suspect that the best material
is on tape/CD rather than in print.

I would like to mention a radio show I did on Seattle's Joseph F. Keppler in
1989. He is a fine poet and the show I did on his work includes
readings/performance and audio writing, interviews with some of his Seattle
peers, and interviews with Joseph himself. This show was a kind of turning
point for me in the way I was producing radio, also, and Joseph helped me
with that transition; we worked together on the material for that show; he
sent me some audio writing from Seattle and we taped a few phone interviews.
Joe's poetry has changed dramatically since that time, but the radio program
shows what he was up to quite well at the time, I think. I have read
elsewhere on the net that his readings in Seattle from that time are
considered legendary, and you will know why after listening to the show.

http://vispo.com/audio/JosephKepplerSideOne.ram
http://vispo.com/audio/JosephKepplerSideTwo.ram

Each of the above two links is about a half hour of Real Audio.

I produced over a hundred such shows and have about a hundred of them on
cassette. The show was called Fine Lines and, later, ?Frame? and was aired
on fifteen campus/community stations across Canada each week from 1984-90.

the films of dirk de bruyn would interest you many of them hand coloured his
nostalgic document of his return to his birthplace has some fine
handcoloured footage,, but most of the films being talked about on this list
so far are "entertainments" simple narrative things, maybe you people need
to look at the whole area that the sitney bros were in to and documenting
also chase up jonas miekas he'd show you some fine things the ART HOUSE
crowd wouldn't know how to follow//pete spence

Has anyone considered blaming the poor quality of famous American poetry on
the Iowa Writers Workshop??  I was just looking at the website, and noticed
this statement:

"The program has produced a dozen winners of the Pulitzer Prize (most
recently Jorie Graham in poetry,1996), three recent US Poet Laureates (Mark
Strand, Mona Van Duyn and Rita Dove), and numerous winners of the National
Book Award and other major literary honors. A list of prominent graduates
and faculty would be too long to reproduce. Noted graduates include:
Flannery O'Connor, John Irving, Robert Bly, Tracy Kidder, Allan Gurganus,
W.P. Kinsella, Wallace Stegner, William Stafford, Bharati Mukherjee, Jane
Smiley, Thom Jones, Bob Shacochis, Margaret Walker, Andre Dubus, Phil
Levine, Donald Justice, Raymond Carver and T. Coraghessan Boyle."
(from http://www.uiowa.edu/~iww/iww2.htm)


So--- *three* poet laureates!!  Maybe there's something fishy with our basic
poet-producing machinery.  Maybe the industrial revolution is taking a final
toll on Western culture.  Or is there some hitherto unnoticed connexion
between the Bush Clan and the Iowa City Chosen?

I remember Michael Anania telling me how he argued against the change from
"consultant" to "laureate" for precisely this reason: as soon as a grand title
was attached, the possibility for radical or aesthetically adventurous poets
being installed would be virtually nil.

I say we take a vote on the anti-laureate -- you know, sort of like the
anti-popes at Avignon, or Exact Change's great "anti-classics" book series.

I need to think about this more but, off the top of my head, a few points -
perhaps the most interesting is that these films are not considered art
house here, they've all had a large audience which includes kids. I think
the humour is part of the attraction - this country has produced quite a
wonderful variety of comic performers and/or writers and satire is always
popular. I don't know if anyone OS (as Australians sometimes term the rest
of the world) has seen a TV series called The Games (just one of many
examples), an almost uncannily prophetic satire combining the meticulous
observation that characterises a lot of the best Australian comedy, the
always beautifully underplayed performance of John Clarke (a Kiwi) and
fellows, and a streak of sheer silliness that is particularly appropriate in
satirising politics in this country.
Didn't mean to say so much about the above so i'll briefly hit on the 'camp
aesthetic' without knowing quite what to say other than there's clearly an
interest/attraction in the idea/practice of men dressing as women - everyone
knows about the Gay Mardi Gras, I'd imagine, but it's not uncommon to see
footballers, for instance, grabbing the opportunity to put on drag
ostensibly for a laugh, it also crops up in ads - I suspect a major part of
the thrill is the sense of licence perhaps, the otherness maybe - it's
certainly quite opposite to the stereotyped Australian male and yet that's
precisely the sort of person who is often attracted by it. What makes it
more interesting (and deserving of a much more informed comment than I can
provide) is the strong homophobic tradition in this country which some
social commentators (I'm thinking of someone whose name temporarily eludes
me)
link to that significant section of our past where Australian society was
chiefly male and there was undoubtedly the sort of activity which is
described as homosexual but where the participants don't acknowledge it as
such. (See The Fatal Shore for accounts of this among the convict
population.) And of course, Waltzing Matilda (the unofficial anthem) also
refers or rather, comes out of, that world of men without women.

1...Creativity Workshop: General Information

We are all born creative, curious and imaginative but these qualities
sometimes fade with the passage of time. The Creativity Workshop's goal
is to help people get their imaginations back. Find your particular way
of expression and break through the fears associated with creation.
This internationally renowned intensive workshop brings together people
of all backgrounds, cultures, and interests to discover new and
exciting tools for generating creativity and thinking and working in
new and exciting ways.

Process not Product
The Creativity Workshop is for anyone interested in expanding their
creative potential. The workshop is attended by educators, artists,
business executives, writers, lawyers, doctors, homemakers, advertising
and design people--all with the common goal of experimenting with their
imaginations and finding new ways to stimulate and expand their
creative potential. Shelley Berc and Alejandro Fogel have developed a
series of exercises designed to help participants develop and recognize
their individual creative processes. Participants explore different
artistic materials and mediums in order to discover their own unique
ways of expression and to learn to break through the fears and
distractions that inhibit creativity.

Tools for a Lifetime
The exercises used in the Creativity Workshop are intended to become
the tools for a lifetime of creative expression. Participants are
encouraged to draw from all kinds of resources of creativity -such as
the oral tradition, dreams, childhood memories, sense perceptions and
intuition. Working both individually and in collaborative groups,
participants explore their imaginative potential through exercises in
writing, drawing, collage, map making, story telling and guided
visualization.

4...What people say about the Creativity Workshop

"The new millennium needs bold, creative men and women who can turn
their dreams into reality... Shelley Berc and Alejandro Fogel show how
you can do this through their challenging and inspiring creativity
workshops...even a simple first contact will prove what these two
talented teachers can do for your own gifts." Dr. Kirpal Singh, Writer,
Professor, Singapore Management University.

"The Creativity Workshop in Spoleto has been a very special experience
for me. It opened up new ways to look at my work and I found new
friendships. I spent 15 fantastic days in an incredible place. Shelley
and Alejandro are superb teachers!" Vera Eisenberg, painter, Argentina

"The Workshop was such a powerful experience for me, something I never
expected nor would I ever be able to repeat it." Rolfe Werner,
Engineer. Canberra, Australia.

"I found the workshop extremely valuable in generating awareness of my
creativity and in stimulating ideas." Jeanne Arthur, Executive Officer,
ACT Board of Secondary School Studies. Canberra, Australia.

"I feel as though I now have a focus, a method, a way of evolving my
ideas and that the means are just as important as the end. I have
created environments just to create in, and environments just to
display the work in. My vision of attending to each detail, sound,
smell, texture, substance... is starting to find a home. Thanks for
opening my eyes to these essential aspects of creating through your
guidance and example." Student. University of Iowa, Iowa City, USA.

"This class was THE MOST enriching, enlightening, inspirational class I
have ever taken. The way I work and what I create will never be the
same." Student. University of Iowa, USA.

"Shelley and Alejandro's Creativity Workshop is amazing in that it
breaks down all your fears about thinking and writing. If it wasn't for
them I fear I never would have finished my master's thesis. I was
blocked until I took this course." Francesca Salidu PHD candidate in
Shakespeare, University of Pisa. San Miniato, Italy.

"Shelley Berc and Alejandro Fogel taught their Creativity Workshop as
American Cultural Specialists under the United States Information
Service auspices. To say that they were extremely effective is a vast
understatement. I would unreservedly recommend their course. They have
abundant creativity, energy, and a wealth of skills." Gloria Berbena,
Asst. Cultural Attaché, US Information Service, US Embassy. Rome,
Italy.

"A special experience. Berc and Fogel opened us up to new and wonderful
ways of looking at our creativity." Belkis Bottfeld, PHD, psychologist.
Istanbul, Turkey.

"An unforgettable course!" Gulnur Ayaz, MD. Istanbul, Turkey.
----------------------------------------------------------------------

5...The teachers

Shelley Berc is a writer and teacher. She is a professor of the
International Writing Program at the University of Iowa. Her novels,
plays, and essays which include 'The Shape of Wilderness', 'A Girl's
Guide to the Divine Comedy' and 'Theatre of the Mind' have been
published by Coffee House Press, Johns Hopkins Press, Heinemann Books,
Performing Arts Journal and Theatre Communications Group Press. Her
plays have been produced by theatres such as the American Repertory
Theatre, the Yale Rep, and the Edinburgh Festival.

Alejandro Fogel is a visual artist and teacher working in painting,
site installations, video and digital art. He has exhibited his works
in galleries and museums in Argentina, Bulgaria, Cuba, France, Hungary,
Israel, Italy, Netherlands, Spain, United States and Germany. His
ongoing project 'Root to Route' chronicles his father's journey through
the Holocaust years. His work is in private collections and museums
around the world.

Berc and Fogel explain in theory and demonstrate in practice the
concepts of originality, 'appropriation', memory and imagination. Under
their guidance, participants explore their own creative processes
through different writing and drawing exercises. They emphasize the
intimate link between personal and public spheres, individual and
social practices, history and myth, dream and reality. The focus of the
workshop is on process not product and to help participants find
life-long tools of creative expression. Shelley Berc and Alejandro
Fogel have taught their Creativity Workshop internationally. They have
lectured on creativity and their own work at universities and cultural
centers throughout the world. They currently teach the Creativity
Workshop as an intensive semester long course at the International
Writing Program of The University of Iowa.

first the query -- can anybody b.ch. me with a mailing address or email for Gerrit Lansing?

-- anti-laureates  -- I doubt that you could argue persuasively that the poets named to the laureateship have been, on average, any more conservative than those who held the consultantship -- the most aesthetically radical was Williams, who was never permitted to assume the position -- but with the advent of the new title, the LOC set about rapidly recycling the oldest and most conservative of those who had already held the post as Consultants -- there had always been an unspoken rule that you got two years max and couldn't be reappointed beyond that-- but the powers that would be apparently felt that some Consultants were more equal to the task than others --

-- as to writings on readings -- there was a whole book of them some years ago -- I THINK edited by Stephen Vincent (forgive my bad memory -- the book itself is in a box waiting to go to PA) -- I'm sure somebody on the list can produce the title --

i smell an Illuminati conspiracy centered in Iowa
- a kind of re-education/hypnosis program
convincing its followers that they are "poets"

they do this so convincingly they manage to fool
the highest levels of power - and the buyers of
poetry

why do you think poetry isn't carried in
bookstores? because no one reads it? Hardly!
forget Bush - he's just a pawn

be afraid - trust no one - deny everything

If the question "poets in films" can be expanded as "the exploration of the
nature of art in films," the argument may become more fruitful.

But before that let me refer to a few films involving poets which nobody
mentioned before:
a) in many of Rudy Burckhardt's films poets (and painters) appear and read
their own or others' work, particularly John Ashberry's work.

c) The bard-poet character who appears in the movie "....the Fool??" also
appears in the movie "My Private Idaho," as the bard/guru around whom street
hustlers congregate. This character, I understand, was based on a real
Seattle street poet who died a few years ago.

As for the wider question of exploring the nature of art and its processes in
films: besides the obvious ones -which represent the cliche versions of
creative process, e.g. Pollock (art as business), Scorcese's awful movie
about a "painter" with Nick Nolte (artist as a romantic egoist)- two gems:

First, "The Kiss of the Spider Woman." The parallel this movie creates
between the visual phantasies, the camp style of a nazi movie and the
conditions in the prison cell itself are one of the most profound statements
about the relationship between "life" and "art."

Art as consolation, art as wooing, art as passing the time, etc.

Second, the movie, called "Art" I think, about a lesbian photographer (forgot
her name). In this movie also a style representing the photographer's life
and loves is intercut with her color photography which has a more intense
version of the color palette of the rest of the film. Once again, the movie
embodies a stylistic dialectic, one reflecting, intensifying, commenting on
the other. Also, in the movie, an affair between her and a magazine
interviewer ends up her taking the interviewer's nude photos to be published
in the magazine -a subtle exploring of the relation between creation and
mutual exploitation.

I have an unrelated question from the list. A poet friend of mine has just
moved to Orlando, Florida. Does any poetry community, readings, poets, etc.,
exist in the area? Please let me know, preferably directly: Muratnn@aol.com.

Ciao.

go around and use whatever bricolage you can find
gathering dust and clutter in whatever debris
detritus or excreta whatever's available

suddenly an error and suddenly a piece
everything becomes fodder for the text
the text is a devouring maw
the text hungers for content, i lose sleep, i don't know just when i'm
   going to be able to stop, just when advance occurs

   when i think i have it right, there's an advance
   or a relief that the clutter has coagulated into the semblance
      of content

      when i think nothing of it, "don't think anything of it,"
      "i didn't mean anything by it," there's stasis, prolongation

    sexual content mixes with the debris, it holds me there, fastens,
     fashions, fascinates
 it's what i found when i pulled inside you with my fingers, hand, wrist,
   arm
   what comes out mixes with error and excreta, debris and denouement

   coupling with lassitude, languor
 so you can think about what has happened to you and the words
 so you can think about the world and what is happening
    it's built on debris and bricolage, on fragments and accumulations,
   on fair and unfair portions, on shares and certifications

    again and again i have it right
    again and again the world advances

Okay, folks, I'm taking this Anti-Laureate idea global.

In the tradition of the Russian Belyi prize for unrecognized literature,
the award will take the
form of one bottle of vodka, along with an announcement of the winner in
this summer's edition
of Samizdat (which features Michael Heller and Belgian Surrealism).

Add to that the possible printing of a limited edition chapbook by the
winner from Samizdat Editions.

Send your nominations to me at archambeau@lfc.edu until July 3, and I'll
annouce the winner
of the first Anti-Laureate competion to the list on July 4th.

All poets are eligible (non-US poets too), except those with Iowa MFAs,
Pulitzer Prizes, or
strong personal ties to Helen Vendler.

Nominees so far are:


John M. Bennett

Karl Kempton

Will Inman

Alan Sondheim

Ron Silliman

Kathy Ernst

Richard Kostelanetz

Alice Notley

and (my nominee) Pierre Joris

(who has the added alure of being from Luxembourg, a country
grossly underrepresented among U.S. Poets Laureate).

Yes -  Kenneth Koch, for god's sake -- all the work he's done promoting
poetry to a larger populace, while maintaining fidelity to an
experimental, innovative, hilarious poetics.

I think we're missing something implicit in "anti." Aren't we looking for
the most opposite to the laureate possible? I therefore nominate Bob
Kaufman, who is more opposite to Billy Collins than any of the previous
nominees, because Collins is alive and Kaufman is dead.

This is the first reading this new museum, right at the Hudson River.

"The movie, called "Art" I think, about a lesbian photographer (forgot
her name). In this movie also a style representing the photographer's life
and loves is intercut with her color photography which has a more intense
version of the color palette of the rest of the film. Once again, the movie
embodies a stylistic dialectic, one reflecting, intensifying, commenting on
the other. Also, in the movie, an affair between her and a magazine
interviewer ends up her taking the interviewer's nude photos to be published
in the magazine -a subtle exploring of the relation between creation and
mutual exploitation."

I think this film was called "High Art."  I remember when it came out
a few years ago, people were commenting on how the director or writer
Lisa Chodolenko seemed to have taken all of Nan Goldin's seediest
traits and told Ally Sheedy to play her like a tragic heroine.  I
would have liked to be a fly on the wall when Goldin met Chodolenko!
"High Art" is kind of an East Village "All About Eve" as the young
straight woman attempts to outdo her wounded mentor in both art and
sexuality.  The younger woman if I recall was played by the
Australian actress Radha Mitchell who later became an action heroine
in one of my other favorite pictures PITCH BLACK!  Mitchell is always
great.  Like Kylie Minogue, Russell Crowe, Guy Pearce she began her
career on the Australian soap "Neighbours."

"High Art"  by the way also features in a small part a really great
NY writer, Laurie Weeks, who appears during a party sequence and
stares into the camera looking drugged out and decadent.  And nobody
who sees it ever forgets Patricia Clarkson, who plays the Nan Goldin
character's best pal, a washed-up German actress and chanteuse who
once worked for Fassbinder et cetera.  Clarkson does a really funny
job she is like Patsy on Ab Fab channelling Nico.

Ok, enough background from me!  Keep up this enjoyable thread of
"Poets in Film."  have we all seen Charles Bernstein yet in the Van
Sant film?  -- Kevin K.

Yes, this one was sort of interesting.  The title is "High Art," if I'm not
mistaken.  Ally Sheehey played the drug addict photographer.  Best, Bill

i fail to see how one individual appointed by
elites (even anti-elites elites) to speak for
poetry (or anti-poetry poetry) is different from
another officially recognised poet appointed to
speak for or to the elites

*scratches head*

can anyone untangle what i just said for me - i
am confused...

*breaks out Strunk & Whites style guide and
shudders*

i nominate Scott Carlson for Poet Laureate of the
U.$.A.

my reasons?

1) He'd never accept the position
2) None of you have ever heard of him - he is
only published in six magazines
3) He has embraced complete rejection of
tradition as the path to Pure Art
4) I love and hate his work
5) He's a good friend of mine
6) He's Canadian - I think the true anti-Laureate
of North America would be Canadian... or Mexican
7) He could use the cash
8) I'd love to crash all the parties he would no
doubt be invited to and make an ass of myself
9) His poems make absolutely no sense whatsoever
10) Even though I am a MUCH better poet than he
is - something I tell him all the time but (to
his credit) he never believes me. He is a vastly
over-rated poet by himself, and vastly
under-rated one by all others.

Robert,

        OK, I'll bite. The Anti-laureate, in my mind, would have to be a
writer of high accomplishment who is way too "hot" for the culture
industry to handle. Someone who remains close to the art, at the
expense of "professional" recognition.

I have several nominees. Hoards, actually. But to narrow it to two:

Rae Armantrout
Gustaf Sobin

--JGallaher


----------------------------------Previous Message:
Okay, folks, I'm taking this Anti-Laureate idea global.

In the tradition of the Russian Belyi prize for unrecognized
literature, the award will take the form of one bottle of vodka, along
with an announcement of the winner in this summer's edition of
Samizdat (which features Michael Heller and Belgian Surrealism).

Add to that the possible printing of a limited edition chapbook by the
winner from Samizdat Editions.

Send your nominations to me at archambeau@lfc.edu until July 3, and
I'll annouce the winner of the first Anti-Laureate competion to the
list on July 4th.

All poets are eligible (non-US poets too), except those with Iowa
MFAs, Pulitzer Prizes, or strong personal ties to Helen Vendler.

Nominees so far are:


John M. Bennett

Karl Kempton

Will Inman

Alan Sondheim

Ron Silliman

Kathy Ernst

Richard Kostelanetz

Alice Notley

and (my nominee) Pierre Joris

(who has the added alure of being from Luxembourg, a country
grossly underrepresented among U.S. Poets Laureate).

The anthology (titled, aptly enough, The Poetry Reading: A Contemporary
Compendium on Language and Performance) was edited by Steve Vincent and
Ellen Zweig, and published by Vincent's Momo's Press in 1981. Several
copies can be found online at Advanced Book Exchange (www.abebooks.com),
which, as many listees must know,  is far and away the best online
resource for out of print books. (For transparency, I should reveal that
I am one of the five or ten thousand bookdealers who list there.)

Can anyone bc with an email address for Charles Borkhuis?

Thanks,

        I'll third this nomination. Even though I understand this is foolishness,
and agree that a laureateship for Koch would be a hoot. Alice Notley,
embodies all things avant-garde poetry endeavors after.  The poetry that she
has lived with, produced and nurtured is truly an American treasure. I guess
that I should just say treasure so as not to insult. I am not sure if she
enjoys the US and all it is. So 3 cheers for Alice Notley

Yow!  My mailbox runneth over with anti-laureate nominees!

Remember the rules, though, folks: an august institution such as the
U.S. Anti-Laureate Commission will only retain its legitimacy and the
respect of the great American public if the competition is run
fair-n-square.  So: no Pulitzer winners, no Iowa MFAs, and no close
friends of Helen Vendler.

Barrett Watten tells me that this disqualifies him from consideration
(not a scandal yet, since no one has nominated him).

But oh no, there's more: B.W. tells me this disqualifies Alice Notley,
who was one of the front runners as of this morning (behind only two
others, Anselm Hollo and Rosmarie Waldrop).

Shock!  Horror!  The United States Anti-Laureate Commission is rocked by
scandal, and Juan Antonio Carlos Ortega Sammawich, High Commissioner of
the USALC has resigned, retiring to his private island near Corfu to
sulk and tearfully paw over the pages of "The Descent of Alette."

But keep those cards and letters (well, those emails, anyway) coming --
the race for Anti-Laureate continues, and at this point it is anyone's
game (except for Alice, apparently, who can now feel the anguish of
being marginalized by the margins for her one-time affiliation with a
pseudohegemonic outfir -- a situation that has my irony meter
redlining).

winning poet
(apologies to Alice Notley, who is really an amazing poet, and who must
now join the ranks of those amazing poets who have been denied
recognition by the Institutions of Poetic Consecration [alternative
version]).

Please join us at this event on Vine Street between Third and American
Streets to benefit the Philadelphia Fringe Festival, with food and
refreshments
provided by Marco's. Be among the first to see images from
the soon-to-be-published Fringe Festival Postcard Book, featuring photographs
by Steve Belkowitz of notable local performing artists. A silent
auction of 11"x17" Iris prints of the original postcard photographs will
take place at the 222 Gallery (222 Vine Street) during the party; the
photographs
will remain on display at 222 through July 28.

2. Tom Tom Club at TLA July 5th, with Echo and the Bunnymen
actually Tom Tom Club is opening for Echo and the Bunnymen, but i think it
should be the other way around....
I'm definitely going to this, Tom Tom club is known for hits like "Pleasure
of Love" and "Man with the Four Way Hips"....Echo and the Bunnymen are known
for "Lips Like Sugar, Sugar Kisses", both bands were big in the 80's
The Tom Tom Club key members are Tina Weymouth and Chris Frantz of The
Talking Heads, she is the bass player and he is the drummer, and they are
married.
While they were in The Talking Heads, they formed the Tom Tom club as a side
project, but actually sold more records than the Talking Heads did, kinda put
David Byrne in his place. They all met at RISD, Rhode Island School of Design.

3. Roxy Music at The Tweeter Center, July 19th, i have excellent tix at cost

contact me directly at GasHeart@aol.com if you want excellent tix at cost for
this soldout show. defined glamrock in the early seventies, and bryan ferry
is one of the best singers on the planet today, a real crooner in the style
of the 30's. all the original members are touring after a 20 year hiatus,
except for the ephemeral brian eno. this show will be a masterpiece.

7pm-11pm.  $6.  All ages.  Free snacks.
+Home made visuals via slides & random video wackery.
-----A night of fusing the classical with the experiment,
the dance instinct with the zone-out desire

CONVOLUTION (NYC, Barcelona): progeny of Mark Cunningham (key player in New
York No Wave scene, was in Mars, Don King (which at points included Arto
Lindsay and Pere Ubu's Tony Maimone), Thee Magesty, worked with Thirwell, etc
etc.) & Silvia Mestres (Barcelona artist). instruments: deeply distorted
guitar, breathy vocals, trumpet, synth.  Sounds like:  balloon animals
mid-contortion, Latin Jazz, rainy island nights locked inside of a haunted
house, and the hot & cold soundtrack to an ever-morphing poetry book.
Incidentally, Mark & Silvia contributed sounds to a CD book of William
Blake's poetry.   More info: http://www.arrakis.es/~silmes/convolution.html
(some tour info has yet to be updated).  If you feel adventurous and can read
Basque (i know, those crazy Spaniards):
http://www.amanitarecords.com/ertz/convolution.htm
convolution(math.): The behavior of a linear, continuous-time, time-invariant
system with input signalx(t) and output signal y(t) is described by the
convolution integral

FURSAXA (Philadelphia): brainchild of Tara Burke (solo and with Grant Acker &
Matt Shiley), formerly of Clock Strikes Thirteen, formerly of Ted Casterline
and his Perfectly Perfect Pieces of Fruit, formerly of the Siltbreeze band
UN.  Instruments used when performing live: casio keyboard, farfisa organ,
haunting vocals, "bells" made from empty, cut fire extinguishers, and more.
The sounds whirling about remind me of a Druid ceremony, lush vocals and rich
melody abounding.  By the way, Tara's CD is titled _Mandrake_, which further
reminds me of spells and grimoires of times past.  In a spell book, I once
read of the mandrake: "In order to gather this plant without being
killed...the soil around the root is loosened, preferably with a silver
trowel. Then a stray dog is tied by its leg to the root and enticed by
promised meat to pull up the root. As the mandrake is torn from the earth it
utters a terrible shriek. If the gatherer does not block his ears or sound a
horn, he or she will go insane at the sound."  nice thought, eh.  more info &
pictures:  http://www.simpletone.com/pacman/artists/tara_burke/

MURCURY (NJ, Philadelphia):  Murcury's most recent appearance was at
Tryptic's premiere at Silk City.  He rubs drum n bass with jazz' taunts soul
with talk radio voices; and spikes hip hop with religious testimonials.  His
DJ work is brilliant yet lighthearted and goes far beyond the mere jukebox
work many DJs use.

Additional local act to be announced shortly.

10. Implosion at 10th and Poplar, Sunday at 8am, will be on channel 6 TV

this Sunday, July 1st, at 8 am there will be a building implosion....of the
Cambridge Housing Projects, located south of Girard, but looks like the
center of North Philly, knocking these things down will help the whole area
around there. go scope it out before they blow it up, between 9th and 11th
sts., from poplar to girard. watch the implosion live, or watch it on TV. it
will only take about 20 seconds, tape it if you're not up that early on a
Sunday morning.

Hi Folks,

I'm going to be teaching a grad poetry workshop for San Francisco
State's second summer session:

CW 0804, ADVANCED POETRY WRITING, 16-JUL-01 - 19-AUG-01

It meets five Monday and Wednesday nights from 6 to 10, with breaks
included.  It'll be a pretty straightforward, relaxed workshop, and
will include readings and presentations from the Norton Anthology of
Postmodern Poetry.

SF State workshops are normally very difficult to get into, but since
it's the summer, enrollment is more open, and I have lots of leeway
on who I admit.  In other words, you don't have to be enrolled at
State to take this class.  If anybody's interested, please
backchannel me.

Information about SF State can be found at http://www.sfsu.edu

Best,
Dodie
