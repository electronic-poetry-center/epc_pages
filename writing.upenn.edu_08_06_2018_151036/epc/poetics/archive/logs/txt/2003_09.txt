I agree with Maria Damon that the fact that there are bad performance poets
doesn't discredit slam poetics.

My complaint against the slam haters is more general.

I think much of what bothers people about performance and/or slam poetry is
the fact that it isn't textual. The same reason why TV haters hate TV,
because it ain't books.

I recall reading Ron Silliman's afterward to _Close Listening_ (Ed. Charles
Bernstein) in utter bafflement. Here, in a volume devoted to sound in
poetry, poetry in performance, etc. was a backhanded attack on the performed
word because it didn't do what "the text _as text_" could do, didn't act as
the same kind of reservoir for deep structures of significance. Well, of
course it doesn't. It's a different medium. Why the need to make performance
answerable to textuality? Why is there so little comprehension within poetry
discussions of performance as a self-sufficient medium? Why the urgent need
to dissociate signification from embodiment?

allow me to suggest:

||||||||||poetry is not a unity, it is a multiplicity||||||||

"It is only when the multiple is effectively treated as the substantive,
'multiplicity', that it ceases to have any relation to the One as subject
or object, natural or spiritual reality, image and world. Multiplicities
are rhizomatic."
Giles Deleuze and Felix Guattari, 'A Thousand Plateaux; Capitalism and
Schizophrenia', 1980.

|||||||||| poetry is not  only  physical archives, printed, sounded or in
digital format ||||||||||
||||||||||||||||||||||||||| poetry is an ideas domain, a problematic
||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||

"There are three conditions which together allow us to define the moment at
which an Idea emerges:
(1) the elements of the multiplicity must have neither sensible form nor
conceptual signification, nor, therefore, any assignable function. They are
not even actually existent, but inseparable from a potential or a  virtuality.
(2) These elements must in effect be determined, but
reciprocally, by reciprocal relations which allow no independence
whatsoever to subsist.
(3) A multiple ideal connection, a differential relation, must be
actualised in diverse spatio-temporal relationships, at the same time as
its elements are actually incarnated in a 'variety of terms and forms. The
Idea is thus defined as a structure. A structure or an Idea is a 'complex
theme', an internal multiplicity - in other words, a system of multiple,
non-localisable connections between differential elements which is
incarnated in real relations and actual terms.'"
Giles Deleuze
'Difference and Repetition', 1968

||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||| poetry is a problematic, a virtual
|||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||

"The virtual is opposed not to the real but to the actual. The virtual is
fully real in so far as it is virtual. Indeed, the virtual must be defined
as strictly a part of the real object - as though the object had one part
of itself in the virtual into which it plunged as though into an objective
dimension."
Giles Deleuze
'Difference and Repetition', 1968

||||||||||||||||||||| poetry is actualised in many physical formats
||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||

"The field of literary studies is in a state of permanent civil war with
regard to what constitutes its valid objects."
Espen Aarseth, 'Cybertext: Perspectives on Ergodic Literature', 1997

||||||||||||||||||||| we waste our time and energy  setting up oppositions
between different actualisations  when they are all a part of the same
virtual - poetry ||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
|||||||||||||||| we create false problems based on differences of degree
not kind|||||||||||
||||||| instead of celebrating multiplicity we try to impose a unity
|||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
|||||||||||||||||||||||poetry is dead, long live poetry!
|||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||

Notice to those who have now read and digested Andrew Duncan's 'The
Failure of Conservatism in Modern British Poetry' (Salt '03).

Owing to the length and complexity of the issues raised in the book, and
the differing opinions on Duncan's success or failure with it, the
Terrible Work website intends to have a three-way review of the book. In
addition I would welcome any other reviews, comments, however long or
short, by others who have delved into it seriously and these can be put
out at the same time as the main three-part review. On the whole I am
more interested in people's views on the things Andrew says, than in
appraisals of the structure, a topic which will probably get enough
airing in one of three main reviews. There are so many important issues
raised in the book, it is so rich in starting points and so relevant, or
should be, to the concerns of members of this list.

Please pass on this information to anyone not on this list who might be
interested and please include any replies in body of email or check with
me first before sending any attachments. Or post to 21 Overton Gardens,
Mannamead, Plymouth PL3 5BX UK.

All best

Hi Gabe,

Well, ok, I was thinking about your call for a public poetry, and like Kazim was
worried that this would be tub-thumping for the party in power.  So I decided to
write up a couple of poems that would embody this characteristic, and wondered
if this is the sort of thing you wanted our laureates to write:

E. Pluribus

Who was it fought the Civil War?
Was Lincoln mercantile, mean?
His motives fraudulent, money-driven, ajar?
Pigs with tails, demons, sought peace among men.

George Bush is a man of war like Daniel.
Limited men sometimes see the essential.
Lincoln saw through the Civil War.
Bush will chart us through this new trial.

Would Christ today speak with a Tomahawk?
With every blast a thousand terrorists die.
Would Christ stun them with awe and shock?
Or would he try Chomsky's subtle lies?

Many today would leave slavery intact as a cultural wonder --
They would not have fought in the Civil War either.



How's that for a public poem? Here's a kind of Dr. Suess version:

Give War a Chance

It worked against the British.
Give war a chance!
It worked against Jefferson Davis!
Why not give war a chance?
Against the Hohenzollerns
And Hirohito, too.
It worked against Hitler,
Why not let war do its thang for you?

At any rate, Gabe, I think after a little more of this you might be asking for a
private poetry again.  When you think of Shakespeare's history plays -- what
stunners -- and maybe this is what you mean -- a vast interrogation of history
with all kinds of sly digs -- the procession of liars across the great stage --
Richard III with his amazing and stunning evocation of evil for the sheer fun of
it and because he's too ugly to be a viable Don Juan with his hunch-back.  I
think Charles Olson tried to write this kind of poetry -- he openly espouses
Shakespeare throughout Call Me Ishmael.  Olson couldn't find a viable political
hero, however, within American history.  He plugs Captain Smith, but only
because he never got into power.  Then Melville himself did write political
poetry -- he wrote against the draft riots for instance, but the poetry isn't
great.  Maybe Shakespeare did this best.  I just happen to be rereading Richard
III --

And therefore, since I cannot prove a lover
To entertain these fair well-spoken days,
I am determined to prove a villain,
And hate the idle pleasures of these days.
Plots have I laid, inductions dangerous,
By drunken prophecies, libels, and dreams,
To set my brother Clarence and the King
In deadly hate, the one against the other...

At any rate, you raise a fun question.  What I don't understand is exactly how
the laureate is chosen.  It's an appointed position on a one-year basis.  Does
anybody know the exact process?  Is there a ratification by the house & senate
as there is for Supreme Court appointees?  What exactly does the position
entail?

the slam / performance poetry I hate I do not hate because it is not
textual, although it certainly isn't

but that it is not performance art (while it claims to be)
AND
it is generally not performance of anything which is designed to be
performed; it IS very much like watching, oh, some terrible family show
like "Yes Dear" or "Girlfriends" (to cite shows whose writers I know and
whose writers or actors I know some performance poets aspire to be, ie,
to cite influences on performance poetry) and not anything like watching
a Bill Viola video

Be well,

The fact that slam isn't textual doesn't bother me.
It's the fact that slam is this sacred cow of the
people, that any effort to discuss why it does or
doesn't work has to be cloaked in the most innocuous,
politically correct language possible, or out comes
this zealous denial of all things intellectual or
written or non-slam as somehow old-fashioned or
elitist. If slam is ok, then let's certainly hope that
the other poetics are also still viable. I think, that
if so much of what slam is about is getting your
message out, and a free exchange of ideas, then
squelching ideas that may be contrary to what's in
fashion is hypocritical.

BlankAMNESTY INTERNATIONAL CASE:

Hearing on AMINA LAWAL--sentenced to be stoned--IS SET

FOR 27 AUGUST

2003



The Nigerian Supreme Court has upheld the death

sentence for Amina Lawal,

condemned for the crime of adultery on August 19th

2002, is to be buried up

to her neck and stoned to death.  Her death was

postponed so that she could

continue to nurse her baby.  The hearing on her

execution is now set for 27

AUGUST 2003.



If you haven't been following this case, you might

like to know that Amina's

baby is regarded as the 'evidence' of her adultery.



Amina's case is being handled by the Spanish branch of

Amnesty

International, which is attempting to put together

enough signatures to make

the Nigerian government rescind the death sentence.  A

similar campaign

saved another Nigerian woman, Safiya, condemned in

similar circumstances. By

March 4th the petition had amassed over 2,600,000

signatures. It will only

take you a few seconds to sign Amnesty's online

petition.



Please sign the petition now, then copy this message

into a new email

(please don't simply forward it since you will be

giving the next person

much unnecessary verbiage) and send it to everyone in

your address book.

My desire to discuss (deconstruct) this issue, as
unpleasant as it may seem, is because of the article
I'm writing. So, it may seem unnecessary, but it helps
to have opinions, both pro and con, about the state of
slam poetry. Although the piece will have a local
angle, I felt that writers from all over the country
can give a more comprehensive vision of the
phenonmenon: why it resonates, how it relates to
modern media, who's going, who's not, etc. So, it
doesn't come from a desire to discredit it, and I hope
this clears that up for anyone who feels I'm
"slam-hating."

>the slam / performance poetry I hate I do not hate because it is not
>textual, although it certainly isn't

I believe that the recently deceased Father Ong would argue that it
certainly -is- textual, in the sense that acts of "secondary orality" (one
current limit we are all inside of) are underwritten -- could not exist in
the absence of -- literacy, textuality. It would possibly benefit slammers
to know this, I guess. Bob Holman certainly knows, so I'd think many of the
rest of them do too.

Likewise, poets who shun what they think of as orality ought to be at least
minimally aware of the -fact- of secondary orality, and of the
performative/rhetorical nature of even the most resolutely -written- of
nonsense juxtapositions. And everything else.

In other words, I agree with Scott Pound (hey Scott, what's the Turkish
slam scene like?), and Walter Ong, and, for instance, Kathleen Welch
(-Electric Rhetoric-, MIT, 1999). That covers slams, screens of every sort,
orations, and all other species of epideictic that bounce around in this
frightening world.

The few slams I've seen have bored me almost to the point of nausea. (In
this they seem not so different from -most- poetry readings.) However, I'd
blame the performers, not "the performative" or whatever. You wait:
there'll be slam geniuses. Maybe there already are.

Also, I BELIEVE

that Jerome Sala invented slam poetry. Because it pleases me to believe it,
even though it's almost certainly not true. Gary Sullivan did invent flarf,
however.

By grassroots, of course, I mean that there's usually no sponsoring
organization: no publisher, educational institution, nonprofit corp. Commercial means
sets out to make money, yes? which slam does not do. "Performance art" I have
difficulty with -- first it's redundant (if it's performance, it's art), then,
it's what dada/Futurists/surrealists did with their bodies so there's the
poetry lineage.

You don't like eminem's poetry? Hmmmm.

"I recall reading Ron Silliman's afterward "
So do I, Scott, and I remember it being about the pervasive role that
criticism, broadly speaking (selection as evaluation, etc) - ie
"ventriloquizing" for poetry - plays in poetry, whether text or performance
based. Reading in double sense of giving a reading, versus an
interpretation. How they are in conflict. Silliman actually privileges
presence, ie the event status of poetry (whether text or performance based,
whether that performance is slam or the act of silent reading), which is I
think a tremendous assertion.

"The Greek root for "idiot" meant a private person."
That would mean slaves and women - ie the disenfranchised of the oikos. But
it's funny in contemporary context. I am a private person! I am an idiot!

Can imagine bad man gun a run under discipline,
Man from Tivoli, Matches Lane, Dunkirk, Southside,
Man from Grants Pen all bout dun with war,
Is all about peace and love and unity.

Wi see dem loving and shoulder rubbing, nobody bugging,
And every man act equal only God above him,
Eye water mek wi eye full,
Wi see every one a live like dem a brother,
And a big up one another,
What a joy and what a pleasure
Man a help dem brother up di ladder,
Money a run and every man a share the pleasure,
No man nah seh dem bigger or better or richer,
And socialist and labourite a friend oh what a pretty pictur,
And wi see every man a try, nah be hitcher,
Food a run and evey man a eat.

Louis, Kevin,

As Kevin seems to suggest, I think there is a prevalent kind of phonophobia
running throughout literary critical discussions about performance--no doubt
the legacy of postructuralist theories of phono(logo)centrism. That's my
beef anyway. The exception of course is criticism devoted to African
American poetics where the situation is sometimes the opposite: the
uncritical imposition of an exclusively oralist poetics onto work that fuses
aspects of textual and oral poetics.

I spoke with Aldon Nielson in Orono a few years ago. I said I was working on
recuperating orality as a viable critical concept for addressing modern and
postmodern poetics. He said he was doing the opposite, arguing against
orality as a critical trope. But I think we were on the same page insofar as
we were both reacting against a kind of theoretical monologism that took a
single theoretical trope for granted as the key to unlocking a particular
poetics.

I don't know, Louis, if Silliman is making as positive a gesture as you
suggest, but I'm on my way back to that essay for a second look (it's been a
while).

I wish I knew what the spoken word / slam scene was in Turkey. I don't get
out much after dark, except to take out the recycling. There is certainly a
huge amount of secondary orality in Turkish culture. The closest I've come
to seeing poetry performed was a few months ago when I went with two of my
students to a special hospital for children with Leukemia to teach and sing
some English nursery rhymes. The house was rockin.

hey poetics,

I'm even finding some argument on the origins of the
modern slam. Can anyone point me in the direction of a
reliable source for info on this? Does anyone have an
opinionson when/where/who and so on? And are there any
slam manifestos floating around?

hey poetics,

I'm even finding some argument on the origins of the
modern slam. Can anyone point me in the direction of a
reliable source for info on this? Does anyone have an
opinionson when/where/who and so on? And are there any
slam manifestos floating around?

SMALL PRESS TRAFFIC OPENER & LIST OF OTHER FALL EVENTS

Friday, September 12, 2003 at 7:30 p.m.
Renee Gladman & Hung Q. Tu

Tisa Bryant on Renee Gladman?s new book, The Activist (Krupskaya, 2003): "A
covert narrative operating as an event disguised as a report?. Is dreaming the
medium for crossing the ambiguous borders of talk, responsibility,
collectivity, solitude?  Or does reading anatomize a phantom bridge that
carries you over to an unmappable reality and calls you by your secret name?
 You may ask how Renee Gladman knows that this city of slippage is your city,
how she holds you within it, riveted.  And therein lies the magic of this
book." Gladman?s previous works include Juice (Kelsey St. Press, 2001).
Formerly the editor of Leroy Books and Clamour magazine, she returns to San
Francisco for this reading.

Rodrigo Toscano on Hung Q. Tu?s new book, Structures of Feeling (Krupskaya,
2003): "[His] poetic modules are not ?pieces? in the traditional sense?that
is, thematically staged, subjectively actored and assumedly audienced, they
are more like an intelligent arraying of graffiti that you?d run into in a
modern city?s sub-throughway, perhaps a bit run-down, but with a shiny glass
building across the street?that is, a city intra-imperialized in every way,
its complicit fractals, its bio-bit patois scrawled all about?. Here?s not (in
the web sense) a ?content rich? pixelscape of vain worderies, but rather, the
very packets of that packet-switching on the broadband of globalist ideology."
Also the author of Verisimilitude (Atelos, 2000), Tu joins us from San Diego.

Hi,

been taking a keen interest in this emerging discussion around performance.
Whilst I like your emphasis against a developing phonophobia Scott I also
feel icky about the simplistic hierarchy implied by Ong's 'secondary
orality.'

My drive has been to explore all writing as performance, from the more
private note-taking and making of linguistic assemblages to more public
events. That is I see them all as performance. I understand and practice and
engage with writing as performance. There are differing kinds of performance
for sure and often versions of poems, a kinship between exophonic (sounded
out) and endophonic (sounded within) body-mind on page as 'stage' and stage
as 'page.' I'm being a bit too brusque here with big issues but wanted to
sketch another possibility from that which I think I've been reading up on
the list lately.

Readers, which can include the writers of course, are temporary operators of
a text. That text need not at all be printed on a page as we know. it might
be being improvised as talk, extemporised from (all those minutiae of
interjections and framings around even the more bookish reading).

Writings are performances that include reading and readings are performances
that recontextualise writing.

lots more but wanted to dip in briefly

love and love
cris

ps. if anybody's remotely keen to hear more about what i'm getting at here
there's 35,000 words on the subject which i can send on b/c. I'd be keen for
feedback on it.

Thank you Komninos--
Yes--poetry is a multiplicity--
some of this debate reminds me of Olson's writings on history--as
"istorin"--to find out for oneself--
Olson's putting forth Herodotus as a model--the inclusiveness of all forms,
rather than the Aristotelian divisions into categories--
one thing i found interesting with the slams i have been to is the lack of
an interest in the connection of sounds with visuals--
i was thinking of the early days of hip hop in NYC--my brother Jed used to
work on stage sets for Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five and also the
Sugar Hill Gang--
(he had also worked for Robert Wilson before that--)
there was a profound interrelationship among the rappers and the
"bombers"--the graffiti artists who worked on trains and walls--and often
provvided backdrop settings for rap and break dancing--
the graiffiti, tagging--was incredible--we used to ride the trains with
bombers--the visual notations, visual poetry--
there was a deep understanding of the connections of visual notations with
vocal sounds and rhythms, emphases, code languages differing from street to
street almost--
Jean-Michel Basquiat came out of this scene, had a band and was with the
rappers and bombers--
his work of course is very inclusive of music and verse, words, the visual
life of sound notations--
personally i think with Komninos that poetry is a vast multiplicty,
unlimited in its manifestations--
cracks on walls, sidewalks, provide sound scores as one walks--tree limbs,
electric wires, the world is full of notations--which pulsate with an
extraverbal form that finds expressions in sound/visual poetry
notations--
a number of slam poets i know actually write out their pieces in notebooks--
also, though there may be no written text in the strict sense of the word,
the text happens in the mind--via the ear and eye--the body--an inscription
(or encrytption-!) is taking place--
over the last half century in American poetics, there seems to be a deep
either/or going on with orality/textuality--
on the one hand the claims that orality has been suppressed, on the other
the claims that the text has been subservient to the spoken word--
why an either/or instead of a both/and--
from the intensities of Bob Grumman's Infra Poetry (see his superb essay on
MNMLST POETRY at Light and Dust)--to Philadelpho's Poetry of the
Intersign--which opens poetry ever further--
there is a profound inclusiveness and interconnectedness among the oral, the
verbal and the visual--
thinking of this discussion, two days ago i found in a pile of things being
thrown out--(lot of people moving in and out this time of year)--a huge
photo album--almost a hundred photos of graffiti in MYC and Miami, in both
Spanish and American English--
in some is a person performing poetry--body movments, movements of the face
and mouth--
huge walls covered with signs, words, colors, notations--
and a person pouring forth a vocalization of the neighborhood--
in my neighborhood, West Central City Milwaukee, you can walk down the
street and hear preachers with microphones and painted signs with Gospel
texts hand painted on them--homemade paintings with words surrounding
angels--people painted in at churches--
also on same streets, rap of the dope man continually, hookers talking up
trade--and kids with portable CDs rapping aloud along with it--
or people inventing raps and trading them back and forth--
hand painted signs on corner stores, clothing stores, hair dressers, palm
readers, small churches, 12 step clubs, food pantres, car washes, check
cashing places, garages--an incredibile array of visual/vocal notations--
insteading of dividing poetry into categories which are set up as
antagonists to one another, holding on to turfs in a continual war--
opens up the mind, eye, ear, body if one lets go of these and finds the
poetries all around one--
my sense of the slam scene that i know is like a narrower version of the
music scene--stars, wannabes, hangers on, various antagonisms and allies--
often times, the focus becomes narrowed to the point it excludes a good deal
but then any form of poetics seems to feel it requires this, to mark turf--
as Heraclitus noted, it is from strife that things come--usually war!--
better to dispense with this in one's own mind, listening, reading and
seeing--and become attentive
with the flows of multiplicitiies
as Mayakovsky (himself a great verbal/vsiual/sound/perfomrance poet) noted--
every street corner, every encounter, every sign/sound  is material--
for me, a hieroglypyh of site/sight/cite-
one finds ways to make use of anything, everything--
in this context, Slam is Slam--one area of poetry among many--take and learn
from it what you will--
in whatever form one finds--
onwo/ards--

Unofficial Bio:=20

=20

A prodigy who obtained his Literature degree while still in his teens, =
Geoffrey Gatza was a gifted poet, whose inability to work within the =
system led him outside of established literary circles. As the "Midnight =
Poet," Gatza used his great wealth, talent and formidable network of =
contacts to provide Avant Garde poetry for a wide range of readers for =
whom orthodox poetry had failed.

=20

While investigating the influx of a new and dangerous bio-mimetic =
languages, Gatza was infected with a mutagenic virus which interacted =
randomly with other chemicals in his bloodstream. As a result Gatza lost =
his vision except while using special goggles of his own creation.

=20

It has been speculated the energy Gatza received from his father was the =
catalyst for this insanity but this is not entirely true. Something else =
has been infecting his mind ... something very powerful. Gatza has =
dedicated himself to protecting the downtrodden of his city from a =
continuing series of deadly schemes by the insidious Iowa writers.

Subject:      Watten reading in Buffalo Friday
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="iso-8859-1"

Very much enjoyed the Barrett Watten reading at Rust Belt Books in Buffalo
Friday, the 29th.  Further enjoying reading BAD HISTORY and THE
CONSTRUCTIVIST MOMENT.  Especially BAD HISTORY is particularly interesting
and useful (and I commend Phil Metres' essay regarding it, too, by the way
article on watten's bad history
</cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind0308&L=poetics&D=1&O=D&F=&S=&P=67086> ).
I guess most of the list is already pretty familiar with it (BAD HISTORY),
and I see some threads going back to November 2002, for example.

Phil Metres on Baudrillard and Chompsky replies to Gulf War I:

"Each paradigm seems to supply the perspectives that are absent from the
other, and yet something is missing from both. Neither critic manages to
capture his own positionality, or rather, his own subjective history."

Yes, first thing that came to my mind is that both present their critiques,
however salient, reliable, or useful FROM OUTSIDE, from the enormous
distance of critical perspective on
THAT OUT THERE, OVER THERE, HAPPENING TO THOSE CITIZENS.  At the end of the
day (as "they" say in TV land), what do the critiques serve, peoples
struggling to stomach humankinda's latest militarism or Baudrillard and
Chompsky's latest chapters in lit history?  (Not that they're bad chapters -
they surely aren't - just to say that such distanced perspectivizing MAY
shed more light on the respective critics' criticism than the objects
critiqued, AND the act itself MAY BE disingenuous given the fact that other
acts - anything from actually going to the Middle East and starting a
business there or establishing journalism or medical assistance there to
more proactively fighting the institutions and purveyors of imperialism
here, like undoing the Carlyle Group or whatever, would more genuinely and
directly work on the causes of war rather than the, I might say
"priviledged," reactions to war.)

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------

A pleasure to meet several Buffalo locals -- including Lauren, Jessica,
Colin, Geoffrey, Donna, Michael, and Katya, among others -- at gracious Kyle
Schlesinger's house afterwards.

Look forward to attending more such readings in Buffalo community when I
can.

ALAN DAVIES, LEONIE WILSON and ALAN SONDHEIM at the FLYING SAUCER!



FLYING SAUCER CAFE READING/TALKING/MEDIA SERIES


PLEASE COME!

TUESDAY, September 9, 7:00, At the FLYING SAUCER CAFE in BROOKLYN -


(See below for details)



ALAN DAVIES is the author of several books including CANDOR, RAVE and
SIGNAGE. At present, he lives in New York. His poetry neither expels nor
avoids any of reality. A dynamic of inner ideal and inner mind links up with
all substance, all happening, all being. He'll be reading and talking about
his latest output, a group of war poems.

LEONIE WILSON recently moved to Brooklyn from Edinburgh in Scotland. Plays
trumpet, has worked with numerous jazz/big bands.

ALAN SONDHEIM works in sound, text, video, image, internet, etc. He thinks
his early records with ESP-DISK were a disaster. He promises to do better
this time.



*****



The Flying Saucer Cafe series pares up new media artists with poets who
instead of giving a reading present a talk relating to their poetry and
ideas.



THE FLYING SAUCER READING/MEDIA SERIES

exception). Please come and support us!

.----  A word or note here.... My experience with the majority of spoken
word "poetry" is that it is simply boring. So what self-respecting reader
amateur poetry lover would care for it. There are performance poets and slam
poets and these poets and thoese poets and some are interesting and sexy and
alluring and others are just plain janes of boredom. ... I think
O`Hara`s comment about the metric fitting like a pair of jeans is apt... for
spoke word, it either works or it doesn`t. I also read the Close Listening
book and don`t recall Mister Silliman making any comments that could be
construed as less than just. And if they were less than just perhaps the
stuff merits being kicked around in the pants a few times,
just to get it going.

“In order to save something, you must kill part of it”



One of the original aspects of Soviet cinema is its daring in depicting
contemporary historical personages.  Deploying words in complete sentences
like who would Jesus bomb?  How about Allah?
Click small metal bobs in solder while tinhorn terrorists
gear shift stuck toward neutral.  Film canister wields spin as spinsters
stroke
dark plastic.  Hack, cough.  Statue on a horse as ash spills from chisels.
Tone of detonate clear streets of debris, state problem at window.

Dark shot open streets of city.  A statue waves light kisses from parades.
Photos are official; cameras on buildings.

Chicken scratch as a note in a hand opens east borders;
berets and holsters wave long fingers in air: an L up
loop film as gears track overtop megaphones.  So uncool,
uncouth hairtrim belies slim elect chance, nope, fat change.  Mace with
thorn
scepter sceptring.  Stay calm, please this ship sinks
just yet.  There’s a story here, listen, trees lean in circles:
plywood boards flat decide against grain.  Beaks peck
peek up, sediment traces sheik romance.  Eyes grey flutter insect wings sky.

Slips in door cracks, corner office dark.  Plan over map, thin onionskin
motel drawer must cuff truck tires for tread marks.  A clear palette,
flatten mactac over cupboard bottoms.  Could hide in cups need disinfectant.
Dust gathers in corners get the windex.  Side of complex collapses
spills into simple.  Wipe mark off.  Tips print passports on nightstands
bible in drawer.  No traces.

On August 19, 2003, bitterness is common currency;
brew coffee over maps and leave rings, lash new lines perhaps
faint at light through pinholes, crags in stone, steel.  Berets stand all
night at borders.

Physical sides collapse but trees can’t find new ways to grow.  Sparrows
sing
strings swell from impact bruising.  On the hill, the air raid wails; plan
calls
speed down trail south to mountains in caves.  Highways close from smoke,
helicopters whip blades as windmills boom.  Panic crag of rock
cut to yellow line skid fell trees through gorge at golden.  National parks
turn nation.

But when the lights go out, no looting, no riots.
Sun sinks behind alleys; only powder’s light in bright corners
flicker electron lectern moan.

tiny in the Clara Kimball universe where a rock will destroy you. A rock

Call for Poems for New Instant Poetry Book:

Nthposition.com - the London-based online journal of politics and poetry =
infamous for global protest e-books, such as 100 POETS AGAINST THE WAR =
and TIMES NEW ROMAN - reminds you of its call for a new international =
"instant" anthology of poems broadly-relating to the Hutton Inquiry.  =
The deadline has been extended: poems will be accepted until Monday, =
September 8th; the chapbook will be made available to Internet sites =
world-wide later in September (and also mailed to Lord Hutton, for his =
consideration).  The work-in-progress already features leading =
innovative and performance poets from the UK, Ireland, and North =
America, such as Peter Middleton, chris cheek, Catherine Daly, Hal =
Sirowitz, Kevin Higgins, and Helen Thomas, among others.

The poetry editor, Todd Swift, believes that such poetry protest is both =
a way to reach readers and government officials in a new and nuanced =
way, and help resolve the complex feelings and thoughts that all =
citizens of so-called democracies are currently facing at this time of =
crisis in public trust.  The Hutton Inquiry has failed to ask (all) the =
right questions, and is even something of a smoke-screen, reviling spin =
even as it is a coup of spin, concentrating media attention away from =
the Blair government's culpability for prosecuting an illegal war.

It is hoped this e-book will raise the discourse, and shed light on, =
among other deflected issues, the absence of a just cause for war =
against Iraq (no WMD), and the absence of any competent program for the =
peaceful re-establishment of government, let alone a livable =
infrastructure, for and by the people of Iraq.

Poems should be submitted to todd@toddswift.com as text in the body of =
the email (no attachments), complete with brief biographical note, and =
permission to use the poem for free globally in all media; no later than =
September 8, 2003.  In keeping with the solemn nature of the Inquiry, =
insensitive poems relating to the personal life or death of Dr. Kelly =
will not be accepted.

has appeared in LVNG, moria, New Orleans Review, -VeRT, Blue Sky Review,
Sidereality, and Skanky Possum. Other poems from The Americans series will
soon appear in the Chicago Review. The poems here use multiple voices and
other art forms (i.e. drama, film, and jazz) as meditative objects to
explore the play between narrative and the poem in general.

<<And are there any
slam manifestos floating around?

Flora>>

Gee, I thought you'd never ask!



We begin each SLAM! with a Disclaimer:

As Dr. Willie used to say,
We are gathered here today
because we are not gathered
somewhere else today, and
we don't know what we're doing
so you do - the Purpose of SLAM!
being to fill your hungry ears
with Nutritious Sound/Meaning Constructs,
Space Shots into Consciousness
known hereafter as Poems, and
not to provide a Last Toehold
for Dying Free Enterprise Fuck 'em
for a Buck'em Capitalism'em. We disdain
competition and its ally war
and are fighting for our lives
and the spinning
of poetry's cocoon of action
in your dailiness. We refuse
to meld the contradictions but
will always walk the razor
for your love. "The best poet
always loses" is no truism of SLAM!
but is something for you
to take home with you like an image
of a giant condor leering over
a salty rock. Yes, we must destroy
ourselves in the constant
reformation that is this very moment,
and propel you to write the poems
as the poets read them, urge you
to rate the judges as they trudge
to their solitary and lonely numbers,
and bid you dance or die between sets.


Why Slam Causes Pain and Is a Good Thing

Because Slam is Unfair.
Because Slam is too much fun.
Because poetry.
Because rules.
Because poetry rules.
Because the poetry gets lost.
Because poetry an endangered species Slam revivifies.
Because you cannot reduce a poem to its numerolgical equivalent.
Because hey it's poetry in everyday life every Sunday at 7:30 PM.
Because I can do that.
Because everybody's voice is heard.Because Old White Guys as usual.
Because it's the opposite that includes the opposite.
Because do not institutionalize the anti-institution!
Because it's meant for middle and high schoolers so they get their adrenalin
poetry shots.
Becase Pepsi and Nike have conflicting ideas about the team uniforms.
Because competitive.
Because Allen Ginsberg says, "Slam! Into the Mouth of the Dharma!"
Because Gregory Corso says, "Why do you want to hang out with us old guys? If
I was young, I'd be going to the Slam!"
Because Bob Kaufman writes, "Each Slam/a finality."
Because Patricia Smith has more truth in her little finger than entire Boston
Globe front page.
Because Marc Smith and because Chicago.
Because Nuyorican Poets Cafe and multi-culti.
Because Taos World Heavyweight Championship Poetry Bout.
Because rap is poetry, and Hiphop is culture.
Because three minute pop song.
Because the point is not the points.
Because audience.
Because heckling.
Because judges selected whimsically are instant experts.
Because Dewey Decimal System of Slam Scorification reduces possibility of
Ties and Dreaded Sudden-Death Spontaneous Haiku Overtime Round.
Because the National Slam is summer boot camp for poets.
Because first six years only women win Indy Slam Champ Boot.
Because local heroes finally have national community.
Because democratization of art.
Because Best Poet Always Loses.
Because cool mediaization of poetry is rooted in hot live performance of
poetry.
Because when in the course it looks like poetry is disappearing, the furious
uproar of the Word will not be stilled.
Because Wiliam Carlos Williams wrote, "It's hard to find the news in poetry,"
but we say, we've got news for you.
Because performance is a see-through page, and the oral tradition a hidden
book
Because it's called Slam.

How can one see territory as present? it moves and deterritoralizes from
moment to moment. I think that the text of the spoken is precisely that
which is not spoken, but written. Thus the memorized text and its secular
parody in spoken word.

The fiction editor for the British editor is or was J.G. Ballard.  It's pretty well-known, and has
very good prduction values -- high quality photos and they get famous artists to illustrate stories
and poems.

Someone recommended a bi-lingual anthology of poems written by children from
Mexico. They said it's called "Luna Luna" but I can't find it on any
searches. ( it's not the Alarcon book ) I'd like to find a copy for my
students. Anyone know of this book?
Thank you,
Laura

I saw an article in the NY TIMES in the arts edition today, where an Iranian
film-maker by the name of Babak Payami has been barred from leaving his
country in order to attend the 60th Venice International Film Festival.

"His film, 'Silence Betwen Two Thoughts,' tells of a Taliban soldier order
to rape a female prisoner.  Another filmmaker, Abolfazi Jalili, was said to
have been prevented from leaving Iran after officials saw his film about a
Muslim teenager in love with a Jewish girl.  ...The director of the
festival, Moritz de Hadeln, said he had deliberately sought to show films
about Islam and the Middle East to give their ideas exposure in the West."

This was printed on page E2.

have caved into Republican interests, i.e. Congressman Tom 'hammer' DeLay's
bid to make over districts in Texas in way that will expand Republican

Oh, and for cheap Iraq thrills - really under reported in our Press - check
the Guardian or Independent papers to get today's news from the hearing on
Kelly's death by suicide. Blair & Company, today were totally defrocked in
testimony by their very own intelligence service officers - who refused to
even show up at the final meeting that allegedly signed off on the WMD
argument with which both Bush and Blair provoked this irremediable disaster
of an Occupation. Remember "Operation Freedom"? I think it can be formally
renamed, "Operation Disintegration" punctuated by Collin Powell on his knees
(in reality) begging for rescue at the United Nations.

Hi, All--

Steve, thanks so much for this news even though it is dire.  I am so
disheartened about the lack of dialogue and true debate here in Texas, but
many of us do still try (albeit for me, mostly in a classroom only).

As for the London news--what legitimate movements are currently underway to
scrutinize and in effect, suck out the rattler-poison, of the WMD debacle?
I have to admit to being behind in following the news although heart and
mind are of course aligned with those who would knock this shameless crap
out.

 So, what say, folks?

Hi everyone, OMG I went to see David Hadbawnik's play at the SF
Fringe Festival tonight.

I had acted in this play (and sang and danced too) when he first
presented it earlier this year (in a 15 minute version) at our Poets
Theater Jamboree.  I was curious to see how he would expand it into a
50 minute version.  Well, he knocked it out of the park.  Though he
doesn't appear on stage himself, he wrote a dozen songs and a
strange, twisty book that reveals what happens when a superstar
shortstop on a major league ball team decides to come out of the
closet.  The songs are much stronger, real Broadway Richard
Adler-style numbers, rousing and catchy, and some of the singers are
awesome, especially the poet Stephen Berry who plays the lead and you
could eat him like ice cream.  A vendor comes and throws bags of
peanuts and popcorn out into the crowd.  I sat with David
Kirschenbaum who's here visiting from NYC and he says the baseball
parts are accurate and he should know.  Also saw Diane di Prima,
sitting in the front row and hollering for "Author, author!"  Well,
don't miss the show which plays again on Sat and Sun this weekend at
8:30, and at 10 pm on Saturday the 13th.  Details at sffringe.org,
it's a great way to pass an idle hour.  Then I walked down Taylor
from Eddy towards Market, what a skeezy neighborhood, and I see these
big tour buses parked outside the Warfield, a bunch of flashbulbs
going off, a small knot of people, and as I'm ambling along I see the
center of attention is Johnny Rotten, still looking much the same.
He's all loose and signing autographs, albums, posing with fans, just
about a dozen of us.  I didn't have my autograph book and didn't
bring my camera, I'm like, nuts.  Paul Cook and Glen Matlock were
there too, but I didn't care about them.  Johnny Rotten, I should say
John Lydon, signed a woman's breast with a big black Magic Marker.

Then it was just the two of us.  I asked him what he thought of Kylie Minogue.

"Let me shake your hand," he said.  "You're the first man in the USA
to ask me what I think of that witch."  Only he didn't say "witch."

I stuck out my hand.  "You changed my life."

We looked each other up and down while we shook.  "Not enough," he
said.  "Not nearly enough."

i get the 'digest' version of this list, ie, i get one message every couple
of days.

just so that everyone knows, once the digest arrives, posts in the next
digest are listed (once the next digest is published) in the order they are
posted in.

perhaps, if this is common knowledge, the author of the first post might
vary more often. i hope so. it is annoying to find the first post from the
same author so frequently.

this one was difficult. there are too many constants that had to be set to
prevent overflow, fill the screen, at least for the most part. rather than
a crash. so i stopped at Crash - 1 you know. i tried to return smaller
constant values but then everything looked wrong. besides, this seems to
be oddly independent of screen height and width. then using twips is

Johnny Rotten.  That's pretty cool.  I once patted Bjorn Borg on the back
when he was at the height of his powers, felt a great sense of peace & joy
clasping hands with Sun Ra as the Arkestra snaked thru the crowd at a
concert, and was kicked in the chest by Dee Dee Ramone (he then tried to
get the bouncers to eject me, but I melted into the mass, changed
t-shirts, and made my way back to the mosh pit). Steve

I wonder if famous artists develop variable responses to such confessions. =
I
say that (again) recollecting the woman yelling out from the Paramount
Theater audience at Nina Simone's last performance in Oakland,
"Nina, you saved my life."
"If I did that, honey, you owe me a whole lot of money!"

Oh, intimacy and distancing a la fois.

In the meantime congratulations to David Hadbawnik, the cast, and play, and
Kevin K's wonderful account. I will be there Saturday night. Thanks to
Kevin, maybe David can let us to know if we need to call x to make
reservations. I don=B9t want to "strike out" at the door.

P.S. Read a little bit of your <Argento Series>, Kevin, every here and there

I can make one of the readings mid-September (Carla Harryman play at Lab or

Among possible future prizes in future contests: a copy of my new book _Dee=

Originally published in 1979, this expanded second edition has 20 pages
of new poems, as well as a new introduction by the author. This was the
first major collection of poetry by the internationally acclaimed
Panamanian-born African-American poet and critic. Now his poetry will
be available again to the 21st century reader. "Sharp, urbane, caustic
social criticism by a black Panamanian poet...'traveling through' the
derailments of our times, anticipating disaster. Thomas addresses
Middle America in the emperor's clothes, and locates a demonic inferno
in the center of the American dream"--Library Journal. "Urban poems,--
they walk the walk and talk the talk, dense with the murmurs, boasts,
chants, grousing, borrowed speech, rhetorical brilliance, and hyper-
realism of city culture"--The Black Scholar.

Mei-mei Berssenbrugge is one of the very few poets writing in the
United States today whose voice and writing style are immediately
recognizable. In her new collection, NEST, the medium of her poetry
continues to be the sentence. To the formalities of syntax and grammar
she adds the structures of domestic architecture, isolation, health,
desire, play, and family life. Her writing offers a unique poetics of
metaphysics and manners. As always the poetry is sensuous and stunning,
and Richard Tuttle has once again designed an arresting cover.

reate(192865018X)

Straddling fiction and poetry, Renee Gladman's writing operates on the
level of the sentence, constructing surprise and oblique meanings at
every turn, and somehow managing the supremely difficult trick of both
engaging and pushing the reader. "THE ACTIVIST begins in the middle of
a revolution....There is a bridge that may or may not have been bombed.
People speak in nonsense and cannot stop themselves. In the midst of
all this, the language of news reports mixes with the language of
confession. The art of this beautifully written book is in how it
touchingly illustrates that relations between humans and cities are
linked in a more complex interface than most realize"--Juliana Spahr.

Seeing Out Loud: Village Voice Art Columns 1998-2003, by Jerry Saltz

http://www.pub24X7.com/scripts/rgw.dll/rblive/BOOKS:SingleProduct,this.C
reate(1930589174)

In SEEING OUT LOUD, Saltz critically engages with notable works of art
by over one-hundred notable artists ranging from Picasso, Matisse, and
Warhol to Matthew Barney, Gerhard Richter, and Chris Ofili. These
reviews appeared in the Village Voice between November 1998 and winter
2003. "Jerry Saltz is the best informed and hair-trigger liveliest of
contemporary art critics, tracking pleasure and jump-starting
intelligence on the fly. Jerry's fast takes usually stand up better in
retrospect than other people's long views"---Peter Schjedahl. "Jerry
Saltz looks at art from the perspective of the viewer, the ignorant,
the lover, and the enemy. His writing is overwhelmingly passionate, yet
without sentimentality. His words pierce the content and beauty of each
work of art to test its endurance in time and memory"---Francesco
Bonami, Curator, 2003 Venice Biennale.

"Jalal Toufic is an amazing writer. He documents the moves of
consciousness in a way that leads the reader ever deeper, from impasse
to illusion to new impasse--turning the trap of 'what can't be named'
into a true paradise"--Richard Foreman. "Relentlessly uncompromising.
Toufic's radical and visionary poetics gird the reader to forge ahead
into uncharted territory"--Village Voice. "Jalal Toufic is one of the
best writers in America today...and his first 2 books, DISTRACTED and
(VAMPIRES), are some of the best writing of the past 20 years"--John
Zorn, Film Works IV. Jalal Toufic is a teacher, film theorist, video
artist, and author of several books. His films have been shown

reate(1930068190)

"Given that there are two kinds of readers in English, those who are
passionate fans of the poetry of Linh Dinh and those who have yet to
read his writing, ALL AROUND WHAT EMPTIES OUT is a major event, too
long overdue. These are works without waste, with the driest sense of
humor and, throughout, an underlying feel for the pain of living that
calls to mind Kathy Acker as much as Kafka"--Ron Silliman. Lihn Dinh's
THREE VIETNAMESE POETS  and DRUNKARD BOXING are both available from

Midwestern American absurdist Dallas Wiebe has been lauded
as "unsettlingly original" by the cosmopolitan elite. In THE VOX POPULI
STREET STORIES, Wiebe's characters lure him into dark corners in search
of a "virgin tongue" which is really just the punch line disguised as
darkness to the fierce light of the imagination. Other titles by Wiebe
available from SPD are GOING TO THE MOUNTAIN and SKYBLUE'S ESSAYS.

Is the Internet Dying?


Recently there has been a great deal of discussion of "Is the Internet
Dying" which is a very controversial issue. Some say the Internet is dying
and will not survive. Others say the Internet will continue forever and it
is fine. I think the Internet is going through difficult times and may not
survive. I will tell you my reasons why.

First, the Internet is very busy now with many business and this hurts
its chance of success of surviving. For example, if you want to order a
car, you can order the car on the Internet and even pick the color you
want. But this makes many people use the Internet who should go out and
enjoy the weather to see the car, and this may be a real problem.

Second, there are so many spams on the Internet, sometimes it is hard to
find a way to read them all, and they are almost always not very good. I
think the spams are harmful, but there are some interesting offers from
foreign countries that sound exciting. But I think they may be "scams" and
not real, but I do not know. They sound exciting.

But they take up so much room that sometimes I have problems finding
emails from my friends who also write and even my family. And sometimes my
family will write and want to know should I take up this offer they have
received, what do I think. So it takes a lot of time and I feel I am
drowning with so much to do in just answering these letters.

Third, I cannot watch movie on the Internet. I try, but my machine is so
slow, the movie runs slow and I forget what I am looking at. I do not
understand the language also when it runs slow. I think in the future they
must speed the movies up. Then I will understand better but my machine may
still be too slow. I do not know! but I will find out.

Fourth, there are so many language on the Internet and I cannot follow all
of them. Sometimes I will try and translate one, but I cannot do this all
the time and there is this important information maybe that I cannot read
and do not know what I can do with it. I will ask my friends but maybe
they cannot read either.

Therefore, I think the Internet is a very good thing, because there is a
lot of information on it, and I can talk to my friends and my family, but
I think it is maybe dying also because of the language, the slow movie,
the spam and the business. Only time will tell!

Pardon me while I channel Amazon a moment:

If you like this piece (is the Internet Dying?)
Then you should check out the "Information Session" by El Guapo, free
MP3 available at: http://www.epitonic.com/artists/elguapo.html

Tonally similar to me; or tapped into the same enjoyment center

'Bout El Guapo: Great post-punk+conceptual jazz (think Braxton... shit,
even one of the MP3s at the address above is called Braxton!) outfit

>|||and will not survive. Others say the Internet will continue forever and
>|||it
>|||is fine. I think the Internet is going through difficult times and may
>|||not
>|||survive. I will tell you my reasons why.
>|||
>|||First, the Internet is very busy now with many business and this hurts
>|||its chance of success of surviving. For example, if you want to order a
>|||car, you can order the car on the Internet and even pick the color you
>|||want. But this makes many people use the Internet who should go out and
>|||enjoy the weather to see the car, and this may be a real problem.
>|||
>|||Second, there are so many spams on the Internet, sometimes it is hard to
>|||find a way to read them all, and they are almost always not very good. I
>|||think the spams are harmful, but there are some interesting offers from
>|||foreign countries that sound exciting. But I think they may be "scams"
>|||and
>|||not real, but I do not know. They sound exciting.
>|||
>|||But they take up so much room that sometimes I have problems finding
>|||emails from my friends who also write and even my family. And sometimes
>|||my
>|||family will write and want to know should I take up this offer they have
>|||received, what do I think. So it takes a lot of time and I feel I am
>|||drowning with so much to do in just answering these letters.
>|||
>|||Third, I cannot watch movie on the Internet. I try, but my machine is so
>|||slow, the movie runs slow and I forget what I am looking at. I do not
>|||understand the language also when it runs slow. I think in the future
>|||they
>|||must speed the movies up. Then I will understand better but my machine
>|||may
>|||still be too slow. I do not know! but I will find out.
>|||
>|||Fourth, there are so many language on the Internet and I cannot follow
>|||all
>|||of them. Sometimes I will try and translate one, but I cannot do this all

>|||
>|||Therefore, I think the Internet is a very good thing, because there is a

I had the privilege to know Dugan and Judy years ago when I was a
fellow at the Fine Arts Work Center in Provincetown.  He was a great
poet and a genuine, no bullshit, true-to-self person.  A tremendous
loss.

NEW YORK TIMES

Alan Dugan, 80, Barbed Poet of Daily Life's Profundities, Dies
By DOUGLAS MARTIN


Alan Dugan, a Pulitzer Prize-winning poet whose ironic and
unsentimental verse pondered the challenge of finding freedom and
purpose in moments of ordinary life, died on Wednesday in Hyannis,
Mass. He was 80, and lived in Truro, Mass.
The cause was pneumonia, which followed many health problems in recent
years, said Judith Shahn, his wife.

Mr. Dugan's first book of poetry, in 1962, won the Pulitzer Prize and
the National Book Award. The last of his nine books of poems, in 2001,
won another National Book Award. Other honors included a Rome Prize,
Guggenheim and Rockefeller Fellowships and, in January, the Lannan
Foundation Award, which carried a $125,000 honorarium.

In a review of Mr. Dugan's "Poems Seven" (Seven Stories Press, 2001)
in The New York Times Book Review, Robert Pinsky said Mr. Dugan could
"set a glittering barb into every phrase."

His language included invective, vulgar slang and scatological terms.
Even his titles were provocative: "The Aesthetics of Circumcision" and
"Funeral Oration for a Mouse" were titles in "Poems Seven."

Another work in that book referred to an earlier collection of his,
saying, "You'll find in my Collected Poems, the palliative answer! to
your stupid questions."

Mr. Dugan's tone was compared to that of the local bartender, though a
particularly eloquent one. His themes range from the onerous need to
make money to bad jobs to masturbation to the problem of how much to
drink. Larger metaphysical issues swim through his verses like sharks,
and death is seldom far away.

"His poems usually communicate small perceptions appropriate to the
lives of small people, so that we listen not because of any glittering
eye but because we feel we should," said Contemporary Poets, a
standard reference work.

In Mr. Dugan's second book, "Poems Two" (Yale, 1963), the work "Elegy"
shows how a few words can seem to suggest a huge, sad story:

I know but will not tell
you, Aunt Irene, why there
are soapsuds in the whiskey:
Uncle Robert had to have
A drink while shaving.

Alan Dugan, an only child, was born on Feb. 12, 1923, in Brooklyn. His
father sold nuts and bolts, and when sales were good the family lived
in Queens. In poorer times they were in Brooklyn, Mr. Dugan told The
Boston Globe in 2001.
In Queens he worked on the student newspaper at Jamaica High School,
from which he graduated. He wrote poetry surreptitiously because he
thought it was for "sissies," his wife said.

But he could not ignore "the unconscious voice dictating the poems,"
he told National Public Radio in 2001. He said that he always heard
the same voice that he heard when he was 16, and he always thought
that he was 16 when he heard it.

After enrolling in Queens College in 1941 he published his first poems
in the college literary magazine. He won the Queens College Poetry
Prize in 1943.

He was drafted into the Army during World War II and served in the
Pacific as a B-29 engine mechanic, and he found time to write poetry
at a makeshift desk. He began to reject his earlier models, T. S.
Eliot and E. E. Cummings, and became fascinated with William Carlos
Williams, a poet to whom critics often likened Mr. Dugan.

He went to Olivet College in Michigan on the G.I. Bill and met Ms.
Shahn, an artist whose father was the painter Ben Shahn. Ms. Shahn
said she and Mr. Dugan left Olivet after a student strike over the
firing of a leftist professor whom they supported. They went to what
was then Mexico City College, from which Mr. Dugan graduated.

Later they moved to Manhattan, where they married to avoid eviction,
despite marriage being against their socialist principles. Ms. Shahn
is Mr. Dugan's only immediate survivor.

He worked in a staple factory and an advertising firm, and for a while
the couple owned a greeting-card business. When Mr. Dugan won his
first National Book Award, Ms. Shahn said that he was in his third
year working in a factory where he made plastic vaginas used to
demonstrate diaphragm insertion.

In 1960 Mr. Dugan won a Yale Series of Younger Poets Award, which led
to Yale University Press printing his book "Poems," for which he won
the Pulitzer.

In that book's introduction, Dudley Fitts, the poet and author, wrote:
"I am moved chiefly by the plainness of Mr. Dugan's themes and by his
nuances of imagery, phrasing, run and rhythm. The cast of mind is
hard, yet the detail is often wonderfully ingenuous and tender."

Mr. Dugan's technical virtuosity in that first book included one poem,
"On the Elk, Unwitnessed," in which the iambic pentameter of Greek
tragedy was articulated into contemporary speech rhythms.

Mr. Dugan held numerous teaching positions, including ones at Sarah
Lawrence, Connecticut College and the University of Colorado. He and
his wife used his fellowships to live and work in Rome, Paris, Mexico
and South America.

At home on Cape Cod, he taught poetry workshops at the Truro Center
for the Arts at Castle Hill, and was a founder of the Fine Arts Work
Center in Provincetown.

Some critics complained that Mr. Dugan's habitual returning to the
same prosaic themes in the same style grew tiresome. Even all of his
seven principal books had the same title, "Poems." Each "Poems" was
followed by a number, in the order that the books were done. Sometimes
the number was spelled out, and sometimes it was a numeral.

But many readers relished Mr. Dugan's ability to slice to the bone. In
"Poems Seven," his last book, "Love Song: I and Thou" illustrates this
incisiveness:

I can nail my left palm
to the left-hand crosspiece but
I can't do everything myself.
I need a hand to nail the right,
A help, a love, a you, a wife.

what the folks are sayin':

"Noah Eli Gordon can spin, scratch, sample, and dub to mix a sound all his
own. THE FREQUENCIES tunes in desire, poetry, static, and laughter - all the
while broadcasting with the intensity and joy of first things. It's dope." -
Peter Gizzi.

"The Frequencies is the story of a boy and his radio and a whole lot
more--Noah Eli Gordon tunes you in to the mysteries of great poets, great
poems and good old fashioned love songs. This is the new music - listen to
it" - Lisa Jarnot.

"Noah Eli Gordon has broken into the booth and pulled the wires from the
console. These poems are witty, inventive Mailgrams dropped from the beaks
of carrier pigeons circling the tower. I was still getting my bearings when
the broadcast ended." - Michael Friedman

"Blurbs are ridiculous. This book is not ridiculous. It is very good." -
Nick Moudry

"Yes the book is stunning to look at, and yes
inside there is a definitive buzzzzzz.

When read carefully the lyrics seem to be
telling a secret. On each page-station I
found myself trying to fine tune my ear
to listen more intently to 'the message'.

The Frequencies is wildly kinetic
invigorating sound-sense, a challenge for any
reader willing to LISTEN... dare you to try." - Li Bloom
(http://abolone.blogspot.com/)

"This is a very beautiful book that provides endlessly possible entrances
into sound, into the music & voices & static of the radio & the poem." -
Catherine Meng (http://www.yingpow.blogspot.com/)


and from Eileen Tabios over at(http://winepoetics.blogspot.com/):

I PUT ON A HAT TODAY JUST SO I COULD TAKE IT OFF FOR NOAH ELI GORDON ... AND
(BACK CREAKING) GIVE A BOW

There's epistemology in everything & Michael Jackson's still singing, but
all I have left is a broken breastplate & the self-reflexive fear I'll never
get beyond the bookshelf.
--from "94.9"

I don't say this phrase lightly. In fact, come to think of it, I've never
said it before about another book! To wit:

This is a book I wish I'd written.

I'm referring to Noah Eli Gordon's The Frequencies (Tougher Disguises Press,
2003).

Brilliant conceptual underpinnings: each section titled by a number
referencing, I take it, a different radio station and through which the
poetic persona hears and writes in response; or, writes out what the reader
hears; or both....

A muscled lyricism I admire -- were I to reduce to a description by invoking
other writers' styles, I'm tempted to say: a combination of Oliver de la Paz
(whose NAMES ABOVE HOUSES is also a collection of prose poems with a similar
novelistic impact) and John Yau. But that would be reductive (even as I give
in to temptation, I know).

Noah rises to all the expansive possibilities of the prose poem form here,
and yet every single word -- indeed, every single letter, every single
punctuation mark! -- is necessary. I mentioned muscles -- well, I'm talking
buff and toned music here (which is also to say, a very disciplined
diction).

Let me further note (sheepishly) that I didn't know Noah's work until I
flipped open his book. I'd seen a few poems on his blog but there is a
reason why The Frequencies has the subtitle of "A Poem" -- not "poems" but a
single "poem"; though each individual section can stand on its own, the
whole of the book is definitely much larger than the mere sum of the parts.
In fact, I remember reading Catherine's complimentary report on this book
and though I appreciated the lines she excerpted, there simply is nothing
like getting the full impact of the book as an entirety. So I had curiosity
but no expectations or preconceptions prior to opening The Frequencies. Gads
-- was I ever surprised! And then OVERJOYED!

Page after page after page, I kept thinking, Dang -- I wish I wrote this,
and this, and this! Yeah -- it's also a page-turner! Though, yes, I know I
will keep returning to savor it....

I'm having an out-of-the-body experience as I write this post: I'm watching
myself. Because I am honestly wondering why I'm reacting very specifically
this way -- by wishing I'd written this particular work.

I mean, I read a lot of poems that I admire and love and respect -- but this
is the first time I am articulating my admiration with the notion that I
wish I'd written these lovely creatures. Why?

I do very much love the prose poem form (my last book is a selection of
prose poems)....but I suspect it's not that simple. Perhaps because from a
single note/stance of a "radio" bursts out this symphonic, Whitman-esque
span that (I think) would not be possible if the poet first had not paid
such close attention to the universe and deeply assimilated its lessons and
mysteries. This poet writes (as) the world!

I am consistently enthralled by BIG-hearted poets and Noah is that with The
Frequencies.

Yet other poets share these qualities. Why do I respond very specifically
with the wish that I'd been the one to write The Frequencies?

I don't know....but I suspect it's because:

Dude -- you just raised the bar for me as a poet. (You've cleared a path for
me to stride through and, from the edge of the clearing, move on to
something else I've not done before.) And, Poet -- I am sincerely grateful.
Very very grateful.

Peeps -- let's listen to "98.5"!

You said nothing hurts worse than an idea, that behind every number there's
the memory of someone else's hands. Radios stacked on top of each other
count down to the new city of learning where we trade the flight of day for
a horse drowned in the yellow river. A flock circling the tower, the signals
feathered. If the language of philosophy is an abacus on fire, a blackout at
the station won't disturb the birds. There's a blue equation inside the
knuckles of each kiss, rust on my first radio, the silence of blown speakers
like the orange dust up to our knees.

"FALSE MEMORY"
Tony Lopez

False Memory is a major political poem of unusual ambition, written through
the events of the 1990s, representing the damaged world that we know in all
its violence and inequality.  Making a radical turn to renew the language o=
f
political poetry, Lopez rejects the traditional search for authentic
personal experience and its individual subjective voice. False Memory is
overwhelmed by the globalized slogans of advertising, consumerism, and all
the special jargons that atomize our contemporary experience from the
spheres of marketing, biochemistry, military, medicine, management, history=
,
finance, fashion, theory, poetry, painting and so on. Driven by an acute
social anxiety that engages these public languages, the poem is comic in it=
s
proliferation of banality and impossible desire. The memory of Elizabethan
sonnet sequences and the soft haze of their Arcadian sunlight meets the
postmodern car-advert in a shiny retro-pastoral: a modular sequence of 110
fourteeners in gleaming halogen-lit chrome. "Virgil knew all about ethnic
cleansing".=20

Andrew Crozier writes that "In any of these stanzas language emits the toxi=
c
glow of an intertextuality for which a functioning media awareness is its
sufficient context.... From the start this writing anticipates the
post-modern as a future condition of the person". Widely anthologized and
excerpted in poetry journals throughout the English-speaking world, False
Memory is published complete for the first time by Salt in 2003.

"Tony Lopez's intricate sonnet sequence (a shorter version was published in
1996) is called False Memory, a wonderfully deceptive title for no one
'remembers' better than Lopez, for whom everything that happens, that he
reads about or witnesses, becomes grist for the poetic mill. These eleven
sets of ten linked unrhymed sonnets, written primarily in alexandrines, are
full of startling aper=E7us and unexpected wisdom. And yet nothing is obvious
in Lopez's poetic universe, alternately commonsensical and surreal,
down-to-earth and utterly fantastic. The book's 'casualness' is highly
crafted and designed:  one reads through the sequence without wanting to
pause for breath, its poetic premise being that 'deferred closure is our
only chance of attendance / When we finally step out of the taxi and begin
to play.' "=20
--Marjorie Perloff



"REVERDY ROAD"
Simon Smith
1-84471-027-0
2003   216 x 140 mm   252pp
GBP 10.95
USD 14.95

Reverdy Road is a book of poems celebrating the aleatory. They are various
responses to their now. Each poem is an open gift, a happy thing in the
world -- there's plenty of time to be depressed later on. The book is in
three parts divided by treatment rather than matter. But it is the matter o=
f
words that is the very subject, and how they signify that matters most.
There is no discernable progress, more a marking of time, place, gesture,
answering questions through their own musculature. They have embarked on no
journey, but they seem to be heading to another destination from a location
we can't know. We are getting there, however. Like Orpheus there is no
looking back. Making the world a better place is their business and purpose=
,
they are friendly and want to talk to you. They won't hurt. They ask very
different questions from journalists, but they love journalists. The body's
place is the question they ask and answer they are giving -- how do bodies
move and remove themselves. The engine is a black Moleskin notebook. Where
they enter life. As Smith says, "All my life they lived under my skin, now
they enter your circulation."

"Listen up to Simon Smith's London phonemes in a lyric serial that commutes
gods, toast, half light, loss, concrete, poetry, phones and angels from poe=
m
to poem. What will happen next memory asks. A sharp poetic intelligence
answers, at work and love in the spliced expression, quick emotion, tried
and untested reasons."

The other day I was going over the Clark biography of Charles Olson again, and
thinking about how Charles Olson didn't like his mom and had the big guilt
complex with his dad in that he denied him the luggage to go to the labor union
convention, and then his dad died of a heart attack and so I was thinking about
his depiction of Gloucester as divided into buildings and places that reminded
him of his mom (such as the Catholic church with its dominating image of Mary
with her foot on a serpent) and pictures of his dad, such as I guess the
sea-images of all the men floundering in the sea (usually the sea is taken to be
a mom-image by people who divide all these things up).

Then I was just thinking how strange it is that as I think over all the poets I
know they all have so many problems with their parents, especially moms for male
poets, and especially dads for female poets.  This was almost making me laugh.
So I started making a list that didn't go on for very long at all:

Allen Ginsberg's nutty mom
Frank O'Hara's nutty mom
Corso's disappeared parents, and then the father returns only to beat him until
he runs away


Then I realized that I actually don't know of any poets who had a nice
relationship with both parents.  Rimbaud seems to have hated his mom, and so on.

So, are there any poets on this list who are men who really just love their moms
to death, as embarrassing as it might seem to admit?

Are there any women poets who just think their dads are peaches?

Or can anybody think of important poets who had really exceptionally happy
families where both parents are considered superb by the poet?

Poe and Baudelaire with their weird military dads.

Would this be a higher percentage of disappointed kids among poets as per among
the "general population" or stacked up next to say, dentists?

If this simple hunch is so, why would it lead to the writing of poetry?

Among the surrealists -- Breton's mom boxed his ears into his twenties,
Soupault's dad died early (his dad was an important stomach doctor) and his mom
neglected him to run around in high society (her sister was married to the
Renault that started the automobile factory).

Which poets on this list love their parents, and are pretty happy with them, or
which poets in American history would fit this description?  As I cast around,
the only one I can find is Marianne Moore -- who never spoke with her dad, but
was pretty tight with her mumsy-wumsy.

Has anybody ever written about this?

Hi everyone, OMG I went to see David Hadbawnik's
play at the SF
Fringe Festival tonight.

I had acted in this play (and sang and danced too)
when he first
presented it earlier this year (in a 15 minute
version) at our Poets
Theater Jamboree.  I was curious to see how he
would expand it into a
50 minute version.  Well, he knocked it out of the
park.  Though he
doesn't appear on stage himself, he wrote a dozen
songs and a
strange, twisty book that reveals what happens
when a superstar
shortstop on a major league ball team decides to
come out of the
closet.  The songs are much stronger, real
Broadway Richard
Adler-style numbers, rousing and catchy, and some
of the singers are
awesome, especially the poet Stephen Berry who
plays the lead and you
could eat him like ice cream.  A vendor comes and
throws bags of
peanuts and popcorn out into the crowd.  I sat
with David
Kirschenbaum who's here visiting from NYC and he
says the baseball
parts are accurate and he should know.  Also saw
Diane di Prima,
sitting in the front row and hollering for
"Author, author!"  Well,
don't miss the show which plays again on Sat and
Sun this weekend at
8:30, and at 10 pm on Saturday the 13th.  Details
at sffringe.org,
it's a great way to pass an idle hour.  Then I
walked down Taylor
from Eddy towards Market, what a skeezy
neighborhood, and I see these
big tour buses parked outside the Warfield, a
bunch of flashbulbs
going off, a small knot of people, and as I'm
ambling along I see the
center of attention is Johnny Rotten, still
looking much the same.
He's all loose and signing autographs, albums,
posing with fans, just
about a dozen of us.  I didn't have my autograph
book and didn't
bring my camera, I'm like, nuts.  Paul Cook and
Glen Matlock were
there too, but I didn't care about them.  Johnny
Rotten, I should say
John Lydon, signed a woman's breast with a big
black Magic Marker.

Then it was just the two of us.  I asked him what
he thought of Kylie Minogue.

"Let me shake your hand," he said.  "You're the
first man in the USA
to ask me what I think of that witch."  Only he
didn't say "witch."

I stuck out my hand.  "You changed my life."

We looked each other up and down while we shook.
"Not enough," he
said.  "Not nearly enough."

The other day my mom at 87 - her marbles beginning to roll - when I ask her
how she is doing, she says "It's amazing what they put you through before
you can get up on that trajectory towards eternity."

When I and my three brothers were young, I am sure there were many days we
would have combined to lift her up on to that "trajectory."

Now we listen and begin to weep.

Relate quite fine with both parents and love them both very, very much.

Did extensive work (therapy) to the tune of many years and tens of thousands
of dollars out of my own pocket (no insurance), too, in order to develop
mature relationship.  Come from humanistic psyche background, so believe in
the stuff.  Sometimes wish I'd spent half of that money pursuing Ph.d, but
such is (my) life, fwiw.

NIGHT SCENE BEFORE COMBAT

There are trucks going down our street tonight
in convoy.  The window rattles.  There are lights
going on and off in the sky
beyond the suburbs, accompanied
by noises that sound like thunder.
I should be with them but
I try to get some sleep=20
with you.  Did you know
that Metaphor means Truck
in Modern Greek?  Truck.  Carryall.
It figures.  As William Blake said,
Eternity is in love with us
creations of time, and you *know*
about love, not just the weapons and battles,
but the problems of supply, logistics,
of getting the material to the front,
to the precise point of fire, in trucks,
at that point of place, at this point in time,
when the lights are flashing on and off
and what might sound like thunder is
not thunder, not thunder at all.
I should go downstairs and join
my outfit, I should get back
to the truck I left idling
by the curb, but I turn to you
for one last time in sleep, love,
before I put my uniform back on,
check my piece, and say So long.

fellow at the Fine Arts Work Center in Provincetown.  He was a great
poet and a genuine, no bullshit, true-to-self person.  A tremendous

NEW YORK TIMES
September 5, 2003
Alan Dugan, 80, Barbed Poet of Daily Life's Profundities, Dies
By DOUGLAS MARTIN


Alan Dugan, a Pulitzer Prize-winning poet whose ironic and
unsentimental verse pondered the challenge of finding freedom and
purpose in moments of ordinary life, died on Wednesday in Hyannis,
Mass. He was 80, and lived in Truro, Mass.
The cause was pneumonia, which followed many health problems in recent
years, said Judith Shahn, his wife.

Mr. Dugan's first book of poetry, in 1962, won the Pulitzer Prize and
the National Book Award. The last of his nine books of poems, in 2001,
won another National Book Award. Other honors included a Rome Prize,
Guggenheim and Rockefeller Fellowships and, in January, the Lannan
Foundation Award, which carried a $125,000 honorarium.

In a review of Mr. Dugan's "Poems Seven" (Seven Stories Press, 2001)
in The New York Times Book Review, Robert Pinsky said Mr. Dugan could
"set a glittering barb into every phrase."

His language included invective, vulgar slang and scatological terms.
Even his titles were provocative: "The Aesthetics of Circumcision" and
"Funeral Oration for a Mouse" were titles in "Poems Seven."

Another work in that book referred to an earlier collection of his,
saying, "You'll find in my Collected Poems, the palliative answer! to
your stupid questions."

Mr. Dugan's tone was compared to that of the local bartender, though a
particularly eloquent one. His themes range from the onerous need to
make money to bad jobs to masturbation to the problem of how much to
drink. Larger metaphysical issues swim through his verses like sharks,
and death is seldom far away.

"His poems usually communicate small perceptions appropriate to the
lives of small people, so that we listen not because of any glittering
eye but because we feel we should," said Contemporary Poets, a
standard reference work.

In Mr. Dugan's second book, "Poems Two" (Yale, 1963), the work "Elegy"
shows how a few words can seem to suggest a huge, sad story:

I know but will not tell
you, Aunt Irene, why there
are soapsuds in the whiskey:
Uncle Robert had to have
A drink while shaving.

Alan Dugan, an only child, was born on Feb. 12, 1923, in Brooklyn. His
father sold nuts and bolts, and when sales were good the family lived
in Queens. In poorer times they were in Brooklyn, Mr. Dugan told The
Boston Globe in 2001.
In Queens he worked on the student newspaper at Jamaica High School,
from which he graduated. He wrote poetry surreptitiously because he
thought it was for "sissies," his wife said.

But he could not ignore "the unconscious voice dictating the poems,"
he told National Public Radio in 2001. He said that he always heard
the same voice that he heard when he was 16, and he always thought
that he was 16 when he heard it.

After enrolling in Queens College in 1941 he published his first poems
in the college literary magazine. He won the Queens College Poetry
Prize in 1943.

He was drafted into the Army during World War II and served in the
Pacific as a B-29 engine mechanic, and he found time to write poetry
at a makeshift desk. He began to reject his earlier models, T. S.
Eliot and E. E. Cummings, and became fascinated with William Carlos
Williams, a poet to whom critics often likened Mr. Dugan.

He went to Olivet College in Michigan on the G.I. Bill and met Ms.
Shahn, an artist whose father was the painter Ben Shahn. Ms. Shahn
said she and Mr. Dugan left Olivet after a student strike over the
firing of a leftist professor whom they supported. They went to what
was then Mexico City College, from which Mr. Dugan graduated.

Later they moved to Manhattan, where they married to avoid eviction,
despite marriage being against their socialist principles. Ms. Shahn
is Mr. Dugan's only immediate survivor.

He worked in a staple factory and an advertising firm, and for a while
the couple owned a greeting-card business. When Mr. Dugan won his
first National Book Award, Ms. Shahn said that he was in his third
year working in a factory where he made plastic vaginas used to
demonstrate diaphragm insertion.

In 1960 Mr. Dugan won a Yale Series of Younger Poets Award, which led
to Yale University Press printing his book "Poems," for which he won
the Pulitzer.

In that book's introduction, Dudley Fitts, the poet and author, wrote:
"I am moved chiefly by the plainness of Mr. Dugan's themes and by his
nuances of imagery, phrasing, run and rhythm. The cast of mind is
hard, yet the detail is often wonderfully ingenuous and tender."

Mr. Dugan's technical virtuosity in that first book included one poem,
"On the Elk, Unwitnessed," in which the iambic pentameter of Greek
tragedy was articulated into contemporary speech rhythms.

Mr. Dugan held numerous teaching positions, including ones at Sarah
Lawrence, Connecticut College and the University of Colorado. He and
his wife used his fellowships to live and work in Rome, Paris, Mexico
and South America.

At home on Cape Cod, he taught poetry workshops at the Truro Center
for the Arts at Castle Hill, and was a founder of the Fine Arts Work
Center in Provincetown.

Some critics complained that Mr. Dugan's habitual returning to the
same prosaic themes in the same style grew tiresome. Even all of his
seven principal books had the same title, "Poems." Each "Poems" was
followed by a number, in the order that the books were done. Sometimes
the number was spelled out, and sometimes it was a numeral.

But many readers relished Mr. Dugan's ability to slice to the bone. In
"Poems Seven," his last book, "Love Song: I and Thou" illustrates this
incisiveness:

I can nail my left palm
to the left-hand crosspiece but
I can't do everything myself.
I need a hand to nail the right,
A help, a love, a you, a wife.

Internet not dying merely sick. Many bugs lately make Internet sick. I =
know about these bugs because I'm on the Internet sometime.

I mostly look at girls and cars but Internet to me still groovy place to =
be. I'm still sending messages on the Internet even though some say the =
government is watching. That Bush is what they call a cracker. I know =
because I read about him and what he do on the Internet. Now I think =
even when you access a government web site they set up cookie to follow =
you around on Internet. I think this not good idea for Internet because =
it seems like Internet used to be freer place if you know what I mean. =
Another problem, Internet is place where identity thief can get your =
private information. I tend to use some software to keep away form them =
but still Internet is not what it used to be even a few years ago.

Keep the Internet going because I think free thinking place. In fact =
some say only way to really find out what is going on, especially since =
FCC wants to control all news media. When that happens because of =
complacency then we'll all be really screwed. In Iraq right now there =
are many people dying, for example, because of apathy of American =
people. Internet the only place to see what is going on in other =
countries. Irony that Radio Free Europe broadcast to Eastern Europe and =
now we in America living in what is nearly like Soviet bloc country of =
no information unless approved by government.

"A Small Note"


I'm sorry I didn't mean to scare anybody. I really do love the Net and
think it's birth will continue for many years. Some say it is dying but if
you know me and my family* you will understand I was having some "fun." It
wasn't much fun I guess. I'm really sorry if anyone believe I don't love
the Net. The Net has given me much enjoyment and games. I promise I will
stop this. This is a wonderful and real world and I am glad to be part of
it. *"Man and Wife." (Sometimes it is so scary to wake up and think, well
now the electric's gone and all, what will we do today. But then we will
look up at God's beautiful world and we will understand that the Net is
"inside us" forever.)

Many are saying that the Iraq quagmire will repeat the one of the war in
Viet-Nam. When I read these graffiti (below), it's a bit of a mental rub to
negotiate the relationship between the present and the era of 1968 - 1974.
The seeming nausea of the present has yet to unleash anything comparable to
the rush of both possibility (hope) and critique that's operative in the
graffiti. Maybe the nausea goes hand in hand with the current depressed
economy where the economy in 1968 was robust and supportive of conditions o=
f
opposition, imagination, etc.  Who knows? The only contradiction to the
nausea is that at least here - the Bay Area - my sense is that things are
more creatively robust than they have been in a long time, as if to say -
in the act of making, and getting together with other makers - creative act=
s
are the most visceral way to say fuck the war and vomit out its viral
nausea. Whether new political and social critiques arise simultaneously, I
can't say. Seems so dormant since last spring. But maybe as the Bush people
are saying about the disconnects between his tax cuts and no new job
creation, we're just experiencing "the lag factor."  (!!)
I bring these grafitti over from a posting on the UK poetry listserv. The
attribution is at the bottom.  Oh yes, a few of them are retrospectively a
little embarrassing, or come across as toys thrown back and forth between
the already socially and economically privileged. Such as was also true.

 MAY 1968 GRAFFITI

In the decor of the spectacle, the eye meets only things and their prices.

Commute, work, commute, sleep . . .

Meanwhile everyone wants to breathe and nobody can
and many say, "We will breathe later."
And most of them don't die because they are already dead.

Boredom is counterrevolutionary.

We don't want a world where the guarantee of not dying
of starvation brings the risk of dying of boredom.

We want to live.

Don't beg for the right to live - take it.

In a society that has abolished every kind of adventure
the only adventure that remains is to abolish the society.

The liberation of humanity is all or nothing.

Those who make revolutions half way only dig their own graves.

No replastering, the structure is rotten.

Masochism today takes the form of reformism.

Reform my ass.

The revolution is incredible because it's really happening.

I came, I saw, I was won over.

Run, comrade, the old world is behind you!

Quick!

If we only have enough time . . .

In any case, no regrets!

Already ten days of happiness.

Live in the moment.

Comrades, if everyone did like us . . .

We will ask nothing. We will demand nothing. We will take, occupy.

Down with the state.

When the National Assembly becomes a bourgeois theater, all the bourgeois
theaters should be turned into national assemblies.*

[*Written above the entrance of the occupied Od=E9on Theater]

Referendum: whether we vote yes or no, it turns us into suckers.

It's painful to submit to our bosses;
it's even more stupid to choose them.

Let's not change bosses, let's change life.

Don't liberate me - I'll take care of that.

I'm not a servant of the people (much less of their
self-appointed leaders). Let the people serve themselves.

Abolish class society.

Nature created neither servants nor masters.
I want neither to rule nor to be ruled.

We will have good masters as soon as everyone is their own.

"In revolution there are two types of people:
those who make it and those who profit from it."
(Napoleon)

Warning: ambitious careerists may now be disguised as "progressives."

Don't be taken in by the politicos and their filthy demagogy.
We must rely on ourselves.
Socialism without freedom is a barracks.

All power corrupts. Absolute power corrupts absolutely.

We want structures that serve people, not people serving structures.

The revolution doesn't belong to the committees, it's yours.

Politics is in the streets.

Barricades close the streets but open the way.

Our hope can come only from the hopeless.

A proletarian is someone who has no power over his life and knows it.

Never work.

People who work get bored when they don't work.
People who don't work never get bored.

Workers of all countries, enjoy!

Since 1936 I have fought for wage increases.
My father before me fought for wage increases.
Now I have a TV, a fridge, a Volkswagen.
Yet my whole life has been a drag.
Don't negotiate with the bosses. Abolish them.

The boss needs you, you don't need the boss.

By stopping our machines together we will demonstrate their weakness.

Occupy the factories.

Power to the workers councils.
(an enrag=E9)

Power to the enrag=E9s councils.
(a worker)

Worker: You may be only 25 years old,
but your union dates from the last century.

Labor unions are whorehouses.

Comrades, let's lynch S=E9guy!*

[*Georges S=E9guy, head bureaucrat of the Communist Party-dominated labor
union]

Please leave the Communist Party as clean on leaving
it as you would like to find it on entering.

Stalinists, your children are with us!

Man is neither Rousseau's noble savage nor
the Church's or La Rochefoucauld's depraved sinner.
He is violent when oppressed, gentle when free.

Conflict is the origin of everything.
(Heraclitus)

If we have to resort to force, don't sit on the fence.

Be cruel.

Humanity won't be happy till the last capitalist is hung
with the guts of the last bureaucrat.

When the last sociologist has been hung with the guts of
the last bureaucrat, will we still have "problems"?

The passion of destruction is a creative joy.
(Bakunin)

A single nonrevolutionary weekend is infinitely more
bloody than a month of total revolution.

The tears of philistines are the nectar of the gods.

This concerns everyone.

We are all German Jews.

We refuse to be highrised, diplomaed, licensed,
inventoried, registered, indoctrinated, suburbanized,
sermonized, beaten, telemanipulated, gassed, booked.

We are all "undesirables."

We must remain "unadapted."

The forest precedes man, the desert follows him.

Under the paving stones, the beach.

Concrete breeds apathy.

Coming soon to this location: charming ruins.

Beautiful, maybe not, but O how charming: life versus survival.

"My aim is to agitate and disturb people.
I'm not selling bread, I'm selling yeast."
(Unamuno)

Conservatism is a synonym for rottenness and ugliness.

You are hollow.

You will end up dying of comfort.

Hide yourself, object!

No to coat-and-tie revolution.

A revolution that requires us to sacrifice
ourselves for it is Papa's revolution.

Revolution ceases to be the moment it calls for self-sacrifice.

The prospect of finding pleasure tomorrow will
never compensate for today's boredom.

When people notice they are bored, they stop being bored.

Happiness is a new idea.

Live without dead time.

Those who talk about revolution and class struggle without referring
to everyday reality have a corpse in their mouth.

Culture is an inversion of life.

Poetry is in the streets.

The most beautiful sculpture is a paving stone thrown at a cop's head.

Art is dead, don't consume its corpse.

Art is dead, let's liberate our everyday life.

Art is dead, Godard can't change that.

Godard: the supreme Swiss Maoist jerk.

Permanent cultural vibration.

We want a wild and ephemeral music.
We propose a fundamental regeneration:
concert strikes,
sound gatherings with collective investigation.
Abolish copyrights: sound structures belong to everyone.

Anarchy is me.

Revolution, I love you.

Down with the abstract, long live the ephemeral.
(Marxist-Pessimist Youth)

Don't consume Marx, live him.

I'm a Groucho Marxist.

I take my desires for reality because I believe
in the reality of my desires.

Desiring reality is great! Realizing your desires is even better!

Practice wishful thinking.

I declare a permanent state of happiness.

Be realistic, demand the impossible.

Power to the imagination.

Those who lack imagination cannot imagine what is lacking.

Imagination is not a gift, it must be conquered.
(Breton)

Action must not be a reaction, but a creation.

Action enables us to overcome divisions and find solutions.

Exaggeration is the beginning of invention.

The enemy of movement is skepticism. Everything that has been realized
comes from dynamism, which comes from spontaneity.

Here, we spontane.

"You must bear a chaos in yourself in
order to bring a dancing star into the world."
(Nietzsche)

Chance must be systematically explored.

Alcohol kills. Take LSD.

Unbutton your mind as often as your fly.

"Every view of things that is not strange is false."
(Val=E9ry)

Life is elsewhere.

Forget everything you've been taught. Start by dreaming.

Form dream committees.

Dare! This word contains all the politics of the present moment.
(Saint-Just)

Arise, ye wretched of the university.

Students are jerks.

The student's susceptibility to recruitment as a militant for
any cause is a sufficient demonstration of his real impotence.
(enrag=E9 women)

Professors, you make us grow old.

Terminate the university.

Rape your Alma Mater.

What if we burned the Sorbonne?

Professors, you are as senile as your culture, your modernism
is nothing but the modernization of the police.

We refuse the role assigned to us: we will not be trained as police dogs.

We don't want to be the watchdogs or servants of capitalism.

Exams =3D servility, social promotion, hierarchical society.

When examined, answer with questions.

Insolence is the new revolutionary weapon.

Every teacher is taught, everyone taught teaches.

The Old Mole of history seems to be splendidly
undermining the Sorbonne.
(telegram from Marx, 13 May 1968)

Thought that stagnates rots.

To call in question the society you "live" in, you must first
be capable of calling yourself in question.

Take revolution seriously, but don't take yourself seriously.

The walls have ears. Your ears have walls.

Making revolution also means breaking our internal chains.

A cop sleeps inside each one of us. We must kill him.

Drive the cop out of your head.

Religion is the ultimate con.

Neither God nor master.

If God existed it would be necessary to abolish him.

Can you believe that some people are still Christians?

Down with the toad of Nazareth.

How can you think freely in the shadow of a chapel?

We want a place to piss, not a place to pray.

I suspect God of being a leftist intellectual.

The bourgeoisie has no other pleasure than to degrade all pleasures.

Going through the motions kills the emotions.

Struggle against the emotional fixations that paralyze our potentials.
(Committee of Women on the Path of Liberation)

Constraints imposed on pleasure incite the
pleasure of living without constraints.

The more I make love, the more I want to make revolution.
The more I make revolution, the more I want to make love.

SEX: It's okay, says Mao, as long as you don't do it too often.

Comrades, 5 hours of sleep a day is indispensable:
we need you for the revolution.

Embrace your love without dropping your guard.

I love you!!! Oh, say it with paving stones!!!

I"m coming in the paving stones.

Total orgasm.

Comrades, people are making love in the Poli Sci
classrooms, not only in the fields.

Revolutionary women are more beautiful.

Zelda, I love you! Down with work!

The young make love, the old make obscene gestures.

Make love, not war.

Love one another.

Whoever speaks of love destroys love.

Down with consumer society.

The more you consume, the less you live.

Commodities are the opium of the people.

Burn commodities.

You can't buy happiness. Steal it.

See Nanterre and live. Die in Naples with Club Med.

Are you a consumer or a participant?

To be free in 1968 means to participate.

I participate.
You participate.
He participates.
We participate.
They profit.

The golden age was the age when gold didn't reign.

"The cause of all wars, riots and injustices is the existence of property."
(St. Augustine)

Happiness is hanging your landlord.

Millionaires of the world unite. The wind is turning.

The economy is wounded - I hope it dies!

How sad to love money.

You too can steal.

"Amnesty: An act in which the rulers
pardon the injustices they have committed."
(Ambrose Bierce)*

[*The definition in Bierce's Devil's Dictionary is actually: "Amnesty: The
state's
magnanimity to those offenders whom it would be too expensive to punish."]

Abolish alienation.

Obedience begins with consciousness;
consciousness begins with disobedience.

First, disobey; then write on the walls.
(Law of 10 May 1968)

I don't like to write on walls.

Write everywhere.

Before writing, learn to think.

I don't know how to write but I would like to say
beautiful things and I don't know how.

I don't have time to write!!!

I have something to say but I don't know what.

Freedom is the right to silence.

Long live communication, down with telecommunication.

You, my comrade, you who I was unaware of amid the tumult, you who
are throttled, afraid, suffocated - come, talk to us.

Talk to your neighbors.

Yell.

Create.

Look in front of you!!!

Help with cleanup, there are no maids here.

Revolution is an INITIATIVE.

Speechmaking is counterrevolutionary.

Comrades, stop applauding, the spectacle is everywhere.

Don't get caught up in the spectacle of opposition. Oppose the spectacle.

Down with spectacle-commodity society.

Down with journalists and those who cater to them.

Only the truth is revolutionary.

No forbidding allowed.

Freedom is the crime that contains all crimes. It is our ultimate weapon.

The freedom of others extends mine infinitely.

No freedom for the enemies of freedom.

Free our comrades.

Open the gates of the asylums, prisons and other faculties.

Open the windows of your heart.

To hell with boundaries.

You can no longer sleep quietly once you've suddenly opened your eyes.

The future will only contain what we put into it now.

Steve,

This kind of complicates the issue to have had to have done a lot of therapy to
let's say develop a more mature relationship (which is admirable, but
complicates my scoring) -- that is to say -- did you originally hate one or both
and then come to see this differently as you matured, and thus you saw a larger
framework for their choices in which you came to understand, and then love them?

I guess that's part of maturing, and would probably happen any way.  Probably
everybody has to hate their parents in teen years, since they won't give you the
car keys and get mad when you come home stoned on LSD and won't eat your dinner
because it looks like soldiers running all over the plate.

But then as you get older -- there's a funny scene in a Dick Van Dyke film where
he's getting drunk in a bar and then looks at his arm and says, hey, what's my
father
s arm doing here!?  Oh, I guess that's my arm, he says in that great way he had.

He's dead, I think.

At any rate, I'm really appreciating all the responses.  It's vastly
complicating the picture that I have.  I really hated my mom growing up, and
then got over it.  She was so bossy it was unbelievable.  It wasn't like the
dime had to bounce on my bed after I had made it, it was just all the
screaming.  I hated it.  My dad just read the paper until he fell asleep in
front of the TV.  It was heaven to have this relative absence of noise out of
him.  But now I realize that I really know my mom, and know next to nothing
about my dad.  So the friction in the long run made me love my mom a lot, and
get a sense of knowing who she was/is.  My dad is unfathomable.  I only have
about ten sentences from his mouth that I can remember.

I think I could say that I have a provisional liking of both of them, with an
undercurrent of suspicion as well regarding both of them, but the suspicion is
different in both cases.  My dad would just lie in order to make things smooth
for instance.  Once we were moving from Illinois to Pennsylvania and I didn't
want ot leave my friends when I was six.  So my dad said a tornado is coming and
the last one tore up a house and then came down and landed on its resident in
the shape of the cross.  I packed my toys and was ready to leave in five
minutes.  Now I guess i feel that that was a little bit unfair of my dad to make
up such a story just to get me to not miss my friends.

But the overall is that they were ok -- neither smoke or drank for instance --
and we had lots of books, and as a foundation, they functioned well, and
continue to function well.

I'm amazed and happy to read that some like Mairead really loved their parents
intensely.  That is remarkable.  I wonder why.  I love mine, but also always
have lingering reservations.

-- Kirby Olson

And Joel, ignoring the pun of tongue somewhere, where is there to go? I'm
serious about this. I've created a slot or [  ] for my work, but would
rather ]  [ but this interstitially between what and what? After the globe
raps itself in a Riemannian formation several times over, then where?

Computer technology is still 19th-century, object-oriented like the
spawned programming. And what are these hardened modules whose links
constantly need reconiguring and rescaling? There is nothing like this in
any other development. We're becoming hive-mind literally with
equivalences in matching protocols -

fundamental questions

species:ledge to which they are entitled, but which may needlessly damage
them? does nat:is it better to be truthful and suffer the consequences?
should people be given know: any circumstances in which censorship is
either necessary or desirable?^?^?^?^?: any circumstances in which
censorship is either necessary or desirable?^?^?^?^? do animals have
equivalent rights to ourselves? are animals intelligent? is artificial
life alive? will robots replace us on the earth? will robots tolerate and
even cultivate the wilderness? do some see farther than others? what is
wisdom and is it associated with age? is cleverness associated with
shallowness and can one be both clever and wise? :you will never age? when
we age do we watch ourselves age or does our watching also age? are we all
fundamentally selfish with skeletons in the closet? are our lives
permeated through and through by shameful acts? does reality exist? do we
see what we want to see? is there an afterlife? are ghosts real? :should
we be free to damage our possessions any way we see fit? do we have the
write to absolute freedom without recrimination of any sort? are we the
care-takers of planet earth? does new development in medicines provide the
major impetus behind salvaging the rain forest? is wholesale slaughter a
necessary condition of the human race? is self-preservation the primary
foundation of human existence? are our children our future or our past?
does belief in a spiritual being necessarily imply that it is gendered and
or higher in any sense? does the slightest spiritual crack in the edifice
of scientific rationalism bring the whole thing down? how do we reconcile
our concerns with a fundamentally meaningless universe? are we motivated
solely by our impending deaths or does sexuality play a part? if males
could have children would they continue to produce otherwise? if there is
a fountain of youth would males or females be more likely to imbibe? is
there any decent reason not to live forever providing ::

Yeah, yeah, oh-yeah, Just Dropped In
To See What Condition My Condition Was In 1.
kari edwards

         -or what position my position is in, or how to position my =
position=20
machine, or how to consider situating without signifying, or maybe how=20=

to place another without them becoming a commodity.

        there is this phenomena in this (queer) community (is there a=20
community that I do not know about?) that creates an insurable hunger=20
to situate and name, to volley up to the Act Up power bar with (wall=20
streetish) slogans like =93SILENCE=3DDEATH,=94 or the universal =93I am =
queer=20
and I am proud,=94 or "I=92m proudly queer," or... =93gay power=94.... =
all good=20
at creating an identity and a situation that becomes a media campaign,=20=

with side order products and glossy magazines, to be pierced/ perceived=20=

and tattooed. We have queer or (reallY) GAY & LESBIAN =91getaways=92 =
what=20
are we getting away from may be a bigger question? what are we being or=20=

what are we living in that makes it necessary to get away? we create=20
the multiplicity of multiple positions and multiple tracking systems to=20=

situate the multiple positions to a singularity with a few hand picked=20=

letters from the alphabet, then we create dramatic discourses on each=20
letter. no wonder there's a need for holiday getaways..
=09
        are we to assume one mode fits all with within academic =
dioramas, or=20
is it one size will get you by as the standard for excellence in=20
scholarly production units? What is it to exclude types of writing, or=20=

limit inclusion of certain types into journals? more of the same, a=20
time magazine for queers? oh that's right we already have those...

        this is not some universal absolute doctrine to rally the troops=20=

around and march to a future tense perfection written all over our=20
utopian dreamscape, or some miracle to bring about greater acceptance=20
by those others in the alphabet soup... (the can of soup I am a part of=20=

but not sure I want to join). this is a question and proposition. what=20=

are we doing here by trying to bring in more and more discussions=20
around "bi" and "trans"? what does it truly accomplish? is it a further=20=

exercise in creating a defense against the oppression, against=20
hetronormative  perspectives, all the while reinforcing that=20
perspective? why are we not talking of ways of disrupting this=20
codification economy,  instead of further situating already oppressed=20
groups?

        one of the questions ought to be, is; what is it when there is =
an act=20
of piracy by the privileged using academic writing within a logocentric=20=

context, to speak of or about queers or =93bi=94 or =93trans=94 issues =
and or=20
individuals? inherently this seems like a problem, situating those who=20=

have already been doubly situated by the medical, psychological, and=20
academic community with further discourse; as if we could write=20
ourselves out of this economy with the speech that created the=20
situation in the first place. this is not to say critical theory and a=20=

deconstruction of social lies are not beneficial, but I do think there=20=

has to be a critic of the critics. without a diversity of voices it=20
becomes a monotone of resistance and an act of doubly situating the=20
already multiply signified.

no one has ever written, painted, sculpted, modeled, built, or invented=20=

except literally to get out of hell.2.

questions:
1. whose writing are we using to get out of hell?
2. have we forgotten Audre Lordre=92s provocative statement: =93The=20
master=92s tools will never dismantle the master=92s house.3.=94?

what is not the master=92s tongue, tool, sword, and or gun?

        Allen Ginsberg=92s - Howl, Anne Waldman=92s - Fast Speaking =
Woman, Leslie=20
Fineberg=92s - Stone Butch Blues, Radcylffe Hall=92s - The Well of=20
Loneliness, Rachel Blau Duplesissis - Drafts, Eileen Myles - Maxfield=20
Parish, use either poetic or fictional positioning /nonpositioning,=20
with at least mild disruption of the father tongue through content or=20
major disruption of syntax. without theory, these text have been the=20
rally point of a queer community in different times and different=20
spaces. would it not make sense then to give these texts equal weight=20
in the discourse? The problem is these text tend to be more=20
phenomenological and less analytical, so there is no measuring stick to=20=

judge them by, but isn't that the point?

        yet even this partial list is segregated when it comes to the =
types of=20
writing accepted by academia, which does nothing but create a hierarchy=20=

of one text form over another, institutionalizing a certain privilege=20
for those that can afford a certain type of education, or privileges of=20=

a certain type of speaking.....

        enough!!

        is it not the content and expression we should be worried about =
. . .=20
not the form it takes? isn't that the whole question; what form are=20
you? should we not hear the mode of expression of ones being, or the=20
content that one carries to the moment?

        so how does this relate to a transgender/bisexual=20
intersections/conception or conscription? it is important to stay on=20
track, be reproducible, predictable, same time every time, part of the=20=

assembly line, a repetitive pattern, to be seen and read, punch the=20
clock, life in a cube, and transport our bodies in sheltered=20
environments where ever we go...
        and I desire rights . . . the right to not be a thing.

        in a society where no one is any longer recognizable by anyone =
else,=20
each individual                     is necessarily unable to recognize=20=

his (sic) own reality. 4.

        the option then is to be super-situated, super-signified with =
special=20
laws to protect us from the gross inequities of this society. even then=20=

we are not recognizable to each other, and passing becomes of yearning=20=

hunger of privilege.  yet, we want to be seen, so we create a special=20
day where we are all together, even then we are invisible... so we try=20=

harder, be more of that which is thought to be our own unique position,=20=

that that is shared by a thousand others with labels like "trans" and=20
"bi"...I am this, I am special... look at me, feel me, touch me . . . I=20=

am not you, but I am in your parade . . . you have to accept me now.
        that will not happen, or who cares if it happens, or it will =
happen in=20
time . . . . time I do not have. I am a stranger in my own land, but=20
that's fine. I do not want to be a contributing member of the GNP . . .=20=

we have to stop situating and create a potential future.  Krishnamurti=20=

said; =93the future is now=94 5., yet we have this desire to =
conceptualize=20
the past/present, instead of future/present.
        so, one of the questions is what does the life of someone who is=20=

"trans" or "bi" have to do with politics? as Kate Bornstein said so=20
beautifully during one of the many times I have seen Kate perform,=20
=93there are not words that can describe me=94 . . . or something like =
that=20
. . . (if I damaged the flow Kate I do apologize) . . . but the deeper=20=

I go into the understanding of language and social construction the=20
further away I get from a need for an inevitable body, or a=20
recognizable figure or a situated constraint. I say we open our bodies=20=

to desire without language, eroticize without shame.

        and what is the meaning of the words "trans" and "bi" when it =
emanates=20
from a bankrupt system bent on violence and subjugation?

        yes, it=92s true, I identify with those "trans" individuals =
brutally=20
murdered. I also identify with those in bosnia, afghanistan, united=20
states of amerika and where ever individuals are denied their freedom=20
of desire and are forced by violence to conform...

        does this mean I try to pass and fit in? . . . hardly . . . I am =
not a=20
thing, or I am everything. I am never a thing, but a verb, that works=20
and lives to do what I can to protect others against the silent=20
violence of the state, such as naming, time, and product placement.

        let=92s face it, any definition does harm . . . instead of =
speaking of=20
this or that, who cares if you are "bi" and you a truck driver, and/or=20=

what that means? or if you are "trans," can you wear other things? the=20=

problems we are facing are so much bigger than what kind of doll does a=20=

"bi" (person) pick, as compared to a "trans" (person). we have only=20

Dear Geoffrey,

Unless you have backed up your hard drive, your loss will be irreplaceable.

Jonathan Skinner has a very interesting interview with Vicuna in one of the
two issues of his good magazine, ecopoetics. Maybe Jonathan can point to
which issue and send a sample Vicuna quote. The connection made between see=
d
and syllable I found interesting in its literalness. "Open sesame said the
Oracle to the supplicant." Not that=B9s not in the interview. But maybe.

Here's information on a new book contest started by Winnow Press for =
those who are interested:

__________________________

Winnow Press
First Book Award in Poetry

Prize
$1,500 and 50 copies of the book

Deadline
October 25, 2003

Guidelines
See www.winnowpress.com

Judge
Kathleen Peirce
Ms. Peirce is a faculty member of Texas State University's MFA program. =
She
is the author of Mercy, Divided Touch, Divided Color, The Oval Hour, and =
the
forthcoming The Ardors (from Ausable Press). Her awards include the
Associated Writing Programs Award for Poetry, the Iowa Prize, and the
William Carlos Williams Award.

"The unobtrusive beauty of . . . [her] poems lies in the quiet intensity =
of
. . . introspective candor. Peirce writes with great courage, tracing =
the
progress of her own soul through a series of unflinching meditations on
sexuality, loss, desire, and the forms of love . . .. The Oval Hour is a
work of startling depth and feeling; in its directness and amplitude, it =
is
a book which seems to read its reader."
--Srikanth Reddy, Harvard Review

"In her second collection, Kathleen Peirce maintains her earmark =
dedication
to clarity within an aesthetic that calls for considerable abstraction. =
. .
. This book does not sound like anything else being written today."
--Jan Weissmiller, Boston Review

"Peirce . . . makes the reader believe that perhaps she can see and say
everything worthwhile. With seductive and deceptive effortlessness, she
takes on the Confessions of St. Augustine, walks in the woods that Ovid
created, dissects her own heart, and creates a language that covers the =
body
in love like a new sacred skin. Not to mention that she does this with
meters and structure you feel in your bones."
--David Garza, The Austin Chronicle

Guidelines
Entries will be accepted between August 1, 2003 and October 25, 2003. =
All
entries must be postmarked by October 25, 2003. No late submissions will =

About Winnow Press

At the present time, we accept and publish manuscripts only through our
annual contests. Within a couple of years, we will also publish =
non-contest
books, as well as book arts projects.

Unlike many small presses, we do not employ student or intern readers to
screen contest entries. Every member of the Winnow Press editorial staff =
has
at least ten years of professional publishing experience. One or more of
these editors do a first reading of all manuscripts. They study large
portions of the manuscript, not just the first and last poems or stories
(the latter is common practice at most publishers). Our editors are not =
only
professionals, but also enthusiastic readers of contemporary fiction and
poetry.

We admire writers who, due to fortitude and perseverance, have amassed =
an
impressive list of publications in literary journals. However, we =
believe
that an author's publishing history has no relationship to the merit of =
his
or her writing. We request that contest entrants provide an =
acknowledgements
list (if available) only because we are curious about where writers are
publishing, not because their publishing records influence our opinion =
of
their work.

In contrast to most publishers that run contests, Winnow Press =
relinquishes
the majority of profits so that each entrant receives a copy of the =
winning
book. We aim to distribute as many books as possible to the reading =
public.

Winnow Press also devotes most of its operating costs to the production =
of
well-made publications. We employ award-winning book designers who have
decades of experience. Our books are of the finest quality, with
satin-coated covers and heavy paper. They are registered with the =
Library of
Congress and have an ISBN.

Winnow Press is an active member of Small Publishers, Writers, and =
Artists
Network (SPAWN).

We donate a minimum of 5% of any profits to organizations that support
literacy and/or libraries.

Means & Ends: Poetry, Prints, Sculpture and Artists' Books

Exhibition and Book Talk

Opening reception: Tuesday, September 9, 4-6 pm, Worth Ryder Gallery,
Kroeber Hall, UC Berkeley

Is a book a place for recording ideas or for developing them? What is the
difference between a bunch of poems and a book of poems? Does gathering work
into books further exploration of that work? How? How does a story develop
across the course of a book? In what font? On what paper? Does it matter?
What is a wall of poems? A book of paintings? How is a wall similar to a
canvas similar to a page? How does one bind pages, paintings, or prints? How
does one print books? How are books made? What are books made of?

"Means & Ends" considers these and other questions in a selection of
artwork, artists' books, architects' journals, small press books,
letterpressed books, comic books and chapbooks written, printed, published
or designed by students and faculty from various UC Berkeley departments.
While the show centers on bookmaking and the construction of other art using
book forms, some of the work also investigates the limiting and liberating
roles that books can fill, both literally and symbolically. Participants
include book designer and printer Les Ferris, artists Emily Wilson, Lesley
Baker, Kevin Radley and Helen Mirra, poet and publisher Lyn Hejinian, poets
Jennifer Scappettone, Brenda Hillman, and Trane DeVore, and writer William
T. Vollmann.

Kroeber Hall is located at the corner of College Avenue and Bancroft Way in
the same building as the Phoebe Hearst Museum of Anthropology. The
exhibition closes Friday, September 19.

Means & Ends: Books Talk, September 17, 6 pm, Worth Ryder Gallery

In conjunction with the exhibition, book designer, printer and lecturer Les
Ferriss, Artist-in-Residence with the Consortium for the Arts Helen Mirra,
and Steve Woodall, Artistic Director of The San Francisco Center for the
Book, will discuss their interest and involvement in book forms. Following
individual talks, UC Berkeley Art professor Kevin Radley and Art and English
undergraduate Helen Miller will moderate discussion of, for example, how and
where artists working in other mediums approach the form of the book, the
accessibility or inaccessibility of artists' books, and how technology
enhances or detracts from the impact of language. The talks will take place
in the gallery on Wednesday, September 17 at 6pm.

Helen Mirra is Artist-in-Residence with the Consortium for the Arts/ Arts
Research Center for Fall 2003, during which time she will prepare a new
project for exhibit in the Berkeley Art Museum's MATRIX series in Spring
2004. Mirra had a solo exhibit at the Whitney Museum of American Art this
past fall, and other recent one-woman shows in galleries and museums in
Chicago, London, Milan, and Vienna. A highly interdisciplinary artist, she
creates sculptural installations as well as sound recordings, film and video
works, and poetry.

Steve Woodall has been Education Director at The San Francisco Center for
the Book since its founding in 1996, and now serves as Artistic Director. In
2000 he was an artist-in-residence at the Xerox Palo Alto Research Center,
where he helped to create a digital book arts studio, part of the research
project and exhibition XFR: Experiments in the Future of Reading. In 2001 he
and Emily McVarish developed an intensive program at SFCB for the practice
of artists' books.

*********************************************************************
"parable" by Deborah Richards, is an examination of the roles of women in
black and white movies from the 30's and 40's. Often the woman was told in
these movies to "be herself", but the drama comes from their decisions to
accept the restrictions of their roles-e.g. good girl, good wife, dutiful
grand-daughter.=20

"Superman: Red, Black, and Blue All Over" by Kamili Feelings, describes the
desire of the son to understand the actions of his father. We reference a
section from Toni Morrison's Song of Solomon : "The North Carolina Mutual
Life Insurance Agent promised to fly to Mercy to the other side of Lake
Superior at 3 o'clock=8A" What happens if a man wants to fly, and what happen=
s
if he fails (falls)?

"Shirley Shirley" by Alicia Askenase tells the often hilarious story of
Shirley Shirley's loves and thoughts on the world. Shirley Shirley is "the
First Lady of Agitated Depression", and her views, though skewed and
unusual, are also poignant.  Find out: Why does Shirley hate the Cliche
Queen?  Who is Manuel of the Mano?

Hey -

I just uploaded the recording of my reading for the Black Mountain College
Festival from last September.  It is in two parts, 23 minutes for the first
and about 13 minutes for the second (in mp3 format).

The first piece also features a fire alarm.

You may find the two audio files here:

spent tonight making this - it's not much - but it's better than nothing
i suppose

I responded with an open letter to Joan Houlihan this
morning re: her article "Post-Post Dementia: How
Contemporary American Poets Are Denaturing the Poem,
Part VII." It's located at
http://www.webdelsol.com/LITARTS/Boston_Comment/.

You can read my letter in the Possum Pouch
(skankypossum.com/pouch). It begins:

Dear Joan,

After reading your "post-post dementia" article today
I wondered out loud with my co-editor at Skanky
Possum, Hoa Nguyen: "is she brain-damaged?"  "She,"
let's be clear, since you need such clarity and
"coherence," is you, Joan Houlihan. This isn't meant
ad hominem. It's a real question. Your obsession with
meaning and coherence is foolish when we're saturated
at every moment with an over abundance and over
statement of meaning and coherence. Perhaps, actually,
it's only in meaninglessness new life and energy will
emerge from the dead weight our culture sloughs....

Rumsfeld said Monday he is not keeping track of the hunt for weapons of mass
destruction in Iraq. He called the search an issue for the CIA and other
intelligence agencies.

"It's an intelligence issue," Rumsfeld said. "I made a conscious decision
that I don't need to stay current every 15 minutes in that area."

Rumsfeld met in Baghdad on Saturday with David Kay, the former U.N. weapons
inspector leading the American weapons hunt. Rumsfeld said the two discussed
logistics, not Kay's findings.

"I did not ask and did not hear" anything about weapons findings, Rumsfeld
said.

"I did not go into a half-hour meeting saying 'OK, lay out what you found.'
I'm assuming he'd tell me if he'd gotten something."

(Washington Post today)

Or, how many crows can you eat in one Press Conference?
Or, as someone said about Bush's speech last night, "He looks like he's on a
new set of Meds -  hardly 'pistol ready'."
Like the collapse has begun.

Anybody got a poetic or other kind of register on this?  It seems to be
getting freakier and freakier. When leadership crumbles and we get the
rubble and unto what generation. So much damage already done.  It's looking
very expensive and bad.

Oh well, it's a beautiful day outside and the new autumn air seems full of
possibility. To go with it, once again!

The poem that is a sample from her book (book, column, and the journal
she edits, Perihelion, all published by Michael Neff):


Winifred Arriving at Heaven's Lobby

You come to us no more than gland, wanting
the odor of comfort. A frill around your voice.
Some trouble in the throat.
On the crook of our arm, you are safely blind.

Settle here in your own wheelchair. Let us speak
in the language of menials: the helmeted virtues,
poverty bread, discipline without cause.
Disarrangement and one good coat-stand up.

We will help you into it. Because your wardrobe was taken
and driven away in the trunks of cars;
because your golf clubs were set on the walk,
your collected wigs on the lawn;

because your bed is not your own-
let us speak to you of hoarded fire, the body's consolation.
You are backed into night and will go no further
until after a long time. For you who rely on sound

alone, we examine your room
for noises, the close approach of the witless.
Do not prevent us. All we see is damage where
before, there was nothing to break.


While reading it is painful, and there are a lot of questions (dull
ones, like who are "we"?, and funny ones, like who put the wigs on the
lawn, Joan?), it seems pretty obvious that Houlihan is consistent --
Winifred is poetry -- and her dismay is plain.  The images she attempts
to conjure in any genre really do obsess her, she subconsciously
realizes she's a bad writer, and she also suspects that one of the
reasons she's a bad writer is that she doesn't understand poetry:  "All
we see is damage where
before, there was nothing to break."

Be well,
Catherine Daly

Walked over in Times Square

Touching her sleeping breasts they suddenly opened like sharp spikes of a
railroad bridge ripped in two. The trees filled with a silver light growing
with contaminants far from the river. A cluster of barbed wire riddled with
pieces of fur and flesh. The Artist died in 1916 in a ditch filled with
water and rot.

Lacerations colored her white raw nakedness . I won’t repeat the things she
said to me smeared with sand and kisses I took her away from the river. I
behaved like what I am ;a thick fingered faux man asking the wrong questions
at the wrong time in loud bleats like a pig being cut and dressed for the
first time.

A porous border sits between the colors that matter and the colors that don’
t Nothing here is profoundly American but a collection of nuts and bolts and
colors and old shoes that have no more use for us except to take up space in
the back seat of an old Chevy. . Europe has assembled an American place of
extreme and dangerous sensuality.

They stand to be painted with big fleshy posteriors or large breasts that
don’t seem to fit high-heeled nudes, dancers and circus acrobats; pensive
girls who seem so aware of being looked at and are used to the spotlight.
They want to live the laid back bohemian life but it is not possible since
smoking is now illegal ;thinking is regulated and we are not allowed to wear
black anymore. The twists and distortions are a kind of energized mental jar
bouncing and causing your brain to slosh around and hit the sides of your
skull.

This is a welcome addition to the canon of using building materials on
small press publications.  An early edition of my book of essays LOGOS
LONGSHOT first came out with sandpaper covers.  The poetics of
abrasion.  Also Patrick McKinnon has been bringing out his mag POETRY
MOTEL for years & years with wall paper covers.  What else is out there?

The Three Blind Mice:

Jeremy Leipert, Andr=E9 Rodrigues, and Chris Ewart met at a party, in a =
bathtub, three years ago; they have since been fast friends. They =
exploded on the Calgary literary scene on a cold Wednesday in February =
at the Caf=E9 Mediterranean and delivered an unforgettable performance =
of words and music to a cosy crowd of 67; the event brewed into a storm =
of laughter, applause, and unabashed fun!=20

All three are 1st year MA students in English at the University of =
Calgary and have been pubilshed in (orange), filling station, and =
Alberta Views magazines.

Yard:

Jason Christie, a third year MA in English student at the University of =
Calgary, started a reading series to expose the raw and awesome talent =
of the emerging writers of the Calgary literary scene; he started it in =
his backyard. The event has grown and moved to venues like the Auburn =
Salloon and the Hop and Brew.

Three Blind Mice in The Yard:

Is a collaboration. The event will feature emerging writers, as well as =
the musical seductions of Brent Bain (Busker Records) and Jamie Cullen. =
This is an event to kick off a new school year, a new way of thinking, =
speaking, drinking, and a new approach to reading, music, and =
entertainment. Both reading series, in the past, have presented unique, =
extraordinary experiences; they are celebrations of the future Great =
Writers of the 21st century.

Not to complain, honestly, but can anyone explain to me why there are so
many "first book" contests? Why does anyone care if it's a first book or a
tenth book? I'd settle for an interesting book.

One by Kathleen Peirce, for example.

Here's information on a new book contest started by Winnow Press for those
who are interested:

__________________________

Winnow Press
First Book Award in Poetry

Prize
$1,500 and 50 copies of the book

Deadline
October 25, 2003

Guidelines
See www.winnowpress.com

Judge
Kathleen Peirce
Ms. Peirce is a faculty member of Texas State University's MFA program. She
is the author of Mercy, Divided Touch, Divided Color, The Oval Hour, and the
forthcoming The Ardors (from Ausable Press). Her awards include the
Associated Writing Programs Award for Poetry, the Iowa Prize, and the
William Carlos Williams Award.

"The unobtrusive beauty of . . . [her] poems lies in the quiet intensity of
. . . introspective candor. Peirce writes with great courage, tracing the
progress of her own soul through a series of unflinching meditations on
sexuality, loss, desire, and the forms of love . . .. The Oval Hour is a
work of startling depth and feeling; in its directness and amplitude, it is
a book which seems to read its reader."
--Srikanth Reddy, Harvard Review

"In her second collection, Kathleen Peirce maintains her earmark dedication
to clarity within an aesthetic that calls for considerable abstraction. . .
. This book does not sound like anything else being written today."
--Jan Weissmiller, Boston Review

"Peirce . . . makes the reader believe that perhaps she can see and say
everything worthwhile. With seductive and deceptive effortlessness, she
takes on the Confessions of St. Augustine, walks in the woods that Ovid
created, dissects her own heart, and creates a language that covers the body
in love like a new sacred skin. Not to mention that she does this with
meters and structure you feel in your bones."
--David Garza, The Austin Chronicle

About Winnow Press

At the present time, we accept and publish manuscripts only through our
annual contests. Within a couple of years, we will also publish non-contest
books, as well as book arts projects.

Unlike many small presses, we do not employ student or intern readers to
screen contest entries. Every member of the Winnow Press editorial staff has
at least ten years of professional publishing experience. One or more of
these editors do a first reading of all manuscripts. They study large
portions of the manuscript, not just the first and last poems or stories
(the latter is common practice at most publishers). Our editors are not only
professionals, but also enthusiastic readers of contemporary fiction and
poetry.

We admire writers who, due to fortitude and perseverance, have amassed an
impressive list of publications in literary journals. However, we believe
that an author's publishing history has no relationship to the merit of his
or her writing. We request that contest entrants provide an acknowledgements
list (if available) only because we are curious about where writers are
publishing, not because their publishing records influence our opinion of
their work.

In contrast to most publishers that run contests, Winnow Press relinquishes
the majority of profits so that each entrant receives a copy of the winning
book. We aim to distribute as many books as possible to the reading public.

Winnow Press also devotes most of its operating costs to the production of
well-made publications. We employ award-winning book designers who have
decades of experience. Our books are of the finest quality, with
satin-coated covers and heavy paper. They are registered with the Library of
Congress and have an ISBN.

Winnow Press is an active member of Small Publishers, Writers, and Artists
Network (SPAWN).

We donate a minimum of 5% of any profits to organizations that support
literacy and/or libraries.

Subject:      Chairman Wants Billions More For Poetry Wars
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; format=flowed

CHAIRMAN WANTS BILLIONS MORE FOR POETRY WARS

WASHINGTON (AP) – NEA Chairman Dana Gioia told Americans Sunday night he
will ask Congress for an additional $87 billion to continue poetry wars in
the US and abroad. He will also ask more poets to help pay the cost.

"This will take time and require sacrifice. Yet we will do whatever is
necessary -- we will spend whatever is necessary -- to achieve this
essential victory in the war on gobbledygook, to promote elegance, and to
make our own art more secure," Gioia said.

A congressional source said Gioia’s request is based on assumptions that the
cost of poetry operations in the US alone will exceed $4 billion a month for
at least the next year.

Billions more will be necessary for historical revision, which the NEA at
one point said would be paid for largely through the sales of MFA degrees.

Gioia said that poetry has changed since the war began and there will be "no
going back."

"For [the poets], there will be no going back to the days of nonsense -- to
the miseries and humiliation it inflicted on countless students of our good
country," Gioia said in his televised address.

"For the United States and the world, there will be no going back to the
days of drivel -- when brutal and aggressive tyrants wielded terrible
vocabularies.

"And for America, there will be no going back to linguistic claptrap -- to
false danger in a comfortable genre."

The United States will seek additional international support to rebuild
poetry and will restore self-rule there, Gioia said. Poetry is now occupied
by a U.S.-led coalition.

"I recognize that not all of our friends agreed with our decision to enforce
good taste," Gioia said. "Yet we cannot let past differences interfere with
present duties."

Foreign nations, he said, "have an opportunity and the responsibility to
assume a broader role in assuring that poetry becomes a transparent and
unambiguous discipline."

Gioia said that over the next two months Secretary of Scansion Molly Peacock
will meet with representatives of many genres to discuss their financial
contributions to the reconstruction of free verse.

"Young people, old ladies, and pop stars will benefit from an increase in
clarity, and they should contribute to that endeavor," he said.

Gioia also detailed his strategy for the continuing war on gibberish.

"Our strategy has three objectives – erasing poppycock  -- enlisting the
support of other genres for a craft-based practice -- and helping poets
assume responsibility for their own personal narratives," he said.

Before the speech, several prominent poets expressed skepticism about
Gioia’s poetry policy.

Minority Leader Rita Dove was among them.

"The problem now is the chairman did his photo op -- he landed on the Norton
anthology, declared war on non-normative syntax -- but he's never had a
plan, and he's never gotten us the grants that we need or the necessary
graduate enrollments to ensure that poetry remains comprehensible," she
said.

"It's the United States' war. We're the ones that started it. It's our
responsibility to finish it," Dove told CBS. "We need more poets. We need
more money. We need it quickly, and time is not on our side."

Gioia told Americans that the United States is making progress in the war on
hot air.

"We are rolling back the post-language threat to poetry, not on the fringes
of its influence, but at the heart of its power," he said.

Re: Report from Gagnoa, sub-prefecture of Lakota, the Ivory Coast
2 September, 1980

I arrived first in the restaurant next to le Cottage, the hotel where I am
staying in Gagnoa. Then two elderly French farts arrived. (They could be
either Alsatian or Belgian. I cannot distinguish between the two accents
because Jacques is the only Alsatian I know, and he is not here to help me.)
One announced they would come back. J’arrive, he said. Both were wearing
shorts, as is the custom of anciens colons. The bald one was wearing glasses
whose lenses were as thick as the bottom of a Coke bottle. (The French say
“Coca-Cola” instead of “Coke,” which is a dead give-away when their
operatives try to blend in.) His glasses were attached to a chain around his
neck. (What he would do when he went to bed I have not the slightest notion,
though, because I am not rooming with him.) His ducktails falling on the
nape of his neck gave the impression of one who does not admit to the loss
of hair on his head. Donc, this may be indicative of no small vanity. The
other wore glasses, too, but his hair was cut in the style of a flattop.
Donc, this may indicate a flaunting of his full head of hair in a kind of
perversely defiant way.

The pregnant woman waited until they returned.

In the meantime, a couple arrived and sat down. The pregnant woman went over
and chatted with the women tending the fishes and chicken cooking on the
grill. The man had a shaved head with a cap and sported a Van Dyke. He
glanced at me, the ever-intent on-looker. Mais, it was not a look of fixing
me in his memory, I do not think. It only may have been that French
existential look directed at the other as salaud. (He had not even bothered
with the politeness of a gregarious salut when he entered.) On the other
hand, my noting his glance could have been my Irish imagination of that
Berkeleyean esse est percipi playing its tricks on my identity as a mole.

Something was going on in the street. Suddenly, an old woman was hooting.
One of the women tending the grill was talking to her in a strange African
lingo, and laughing, too.

The couple had been served and both of them were all eyes when the fatties
arrived. They ordered Beaujolais, and the patron went outside the restaurant
to fetch a bottle. The pregnant woman had already walked away from the
fatties when one of them said, Ou est la femme? I watched her outside the
restaurant while she stretched her arms in two quick alternating jabs from
the elbows.

I had finished eating when I went over to wash my hands in the lavabo. My
nose was profusely running. The elderly woman quickly took away my plate
while inwardly gleeful I finished off my bottle of Flag. I continued to
watch the fat fuckers gloating over their food. (The thought of this
gluttony and the little old woman selling little parcels of spiced sweet
bananas fried in palm oil and served in scraps of newspaper outside le
Cottage galled me.) The rigolant patron waited on them, plying them with
apéritifs and digestifs all the while the pregnant woman kept the banter
going as warily they ate, chuckled, never letting but a few moments go by
without talk and bavardage. They remained the center of attention, and thus
recalled to mind a wise saying of Dr. al-Zawahiri.

The Egyptian savant, Dr. al-Zawahiri, always counseled me that attention
brings controversy. He taught me that to be a true mole I must be a “blind
mole,” that is, -- the other bastard must be blind to me, that I must not
draw attention and remain in inconspicuousness, a state of mind the smoking
of hashish allows you to enter. (I remember when I was first noticed as an
inconspicuous person. Chico, the Mohawk ironworker, first noticed this
quality in me in Andy’s Pub, a bar on High Street in Columbus, Ohio. I was
wearing a red bandana and a navy blue and white striped sailor’s tee-shirt

must not be a flamboyant star-nosed mole, however” he insisted to me. I
first met the Doctor in a she-sha and tea shop in Cairo. He loved to smoke
the sweet, fruity Egyptian tobacco. My contact in Cairo, the “Muslim Jew
from the Bronx,” introduced me to him. Between calls to the Pakistani waiter
(“Kootee, chai!”) to bring tea and replenish the hubble-bubble we hatched
our plan to bring down the Christian-Zionist network.

I  once tried to do a special limited edition of Paul Blackburn's Lorca
translations - with the sheets letter pressed - and placed inside a Lucca
Ravioli box. I just now thought of the funny phonic association between
"Lucca" and "Lorca" (after 20 years!), however, the box was wonderful with
it's blue print instructions on how to cook the fresh ravioli, as well as
the kind of Mediterranean touch to fit Paul's love of Provence and Lorca's
Spain, etc., and a touch of California custom funk aesthetic.
Well, it never happened. Lucca's proprietorial proprietor would not sell 50
empty boxes with his imprimatur. And the artist who did the drawings - who
is probably still considered infamously bull headed - refused to sign the
edition because he became of the opinion that his drawings looked much
better off-set (as in the trade paperback edition) than printed off zinc
blocks. (Yes, we had finished the printing.)
Not all ideas are made to be finished! Let alone the loss of money and a fe=
w
pissed off folks, including yours truly!

But it does make me remember the little Mylar sewn cover that Zephryus Imag=
e
produced for a tiny little booklet called "Seen", which was a lecture by
Stan Brakhage. Very fragile, but beautiful, giving off little pixel rainbow=
s
of color and silver light. It went perfectly with the subject of Stan's fil=
m
of the same title in which he let the camera focus on a light reflected
through a glass ashtray in the top floor office of a Pittsburg skyscraper.
The delicacy of the fragile Mylar - not about to fit aside other books - wa=
s
protected by encasing the booklet in a red envelope with a zink block image
of  16 millimeter projector on printed on its lip.


So, for me, the interesting question is making a cover image that in one wa=
y
or other crystallizes a books content - where it comes off true. Then you'r=
e
holding something.=20

Steve: Please forward my response to poetics--I haven't reupped yet.

There's a world of difference between an artist's edition like Steve's
Blackburn/Lorca attempt and a larger run of presumably trade books or
magazines with sandpaper or tarpaper covers, which reminds me of one of my
motivations for starting Junction Press. It came to me about 15 years ago
while trying to alphabetize my p[oetry collection so that I could actually
find things when I needed them.  It was almost impossible to do because the
sizes of a large proportion of the books were unconventional and wouldn't
cohabity the same shelves with my other books. It occurred to me that the
eccentricities of so many small press books were a testimony not so much to
self-indulgence as to a settled pessimism about distribution--why bother to
make them easy to shelve if bookstores and libraries wouldn't bother with
them? So I decided to do a series of books designed to trade standards, but
as interestingly designed as I could manage. The cover of Steve's Junction
Press book is a case in point--a Goya etching of men flying on a book
called Walking, the aquatint ground extended upwards over the entire
surface. An attractive book, and easy to use.

Sandpaper or tarpaper, on the otherhand, are hard to shelve in contact with
other books--they destroy their neighbors and are in turn destroyed. Not to
speak of what they do the the hands of the reader.

I guess they're a reaction to the pervasive good manners of everyday small
press books which, thanks to the computer, tend more towards standard
design practices than they did when Junction started.

Steve's book, by the way, is still available at its original cover price
of  $9 less 20% for list members plus $3 shipping.

Hi Mike

If you drop the mag, the astroturf binding gives you a true bounce to
facilitate your retrieving it.

Negativity: a Constellative “Model”
(Or, Reading Report: Barrett Watten, Rust Belt Books, Buffalo, Friday,
August 29, 2003)

Negativity: “part of a system that cannot be represented positively”
(Watten), actualized by internal semantic shifts within the text.

Frederic Jameson:
“That modern thought of experience is somehow ‘fragmentary’ might be an
instructive feature of yet another Kulturkritik of modern times, but
only if fragmentation is seen as the situation and the dilemma to which
modern thought responds, not as one of its general qualities or
properties...” (Jameson 50-51).

Working between discourses as discursive models offers “generated
meanings that are fabricated” (Watten).

Q: What is the difference btw. conceptual speech and ethical speech?
Does Watten make the claim that it is our “ethical” responsibility to
invest in negativity, as our language is social? When does poetry
inhabit a conceptual framework if “Thinking things the world”
(Bernstein 71)? That is, poetry is always already conceptual and
social.

Hejinian:
“The resulting praxis is addressed to phenomenological &
epistemological concerns. But it is also a denotatively social and
therefore political practice” (Hejinian 2).

Bernstein again:
“'Thinking’ as the conceptual basis of literary production suggests the
possibilities for leaps, jumps, fissures, repetition, bridges, schisms,
colloquialisms, trains of associations, and memory; as a literary mode
it would rely on concepts related to spontaneity, free association, and
improvisation” (Bernstein 63).

Adorno:
“With a peasant cunning that justifies itself as primordiality, it
refuses to honor the obligations of conceptual thought, to which,
however, it had subscribed when it used concepts in its propositions
and judgements” (Adorno 7).

Watten, somewhere in Opera-Works:

     In the picture postcard nothing comes about
     I know that, I am tight
     I bought almonds

Q: “Why work in criticism instead of poetry” (Watten)? And if it is
true that one can do the work of the other, why do both? Doesn’t
fragmentation in prose, especially fragmentation that slips from
discursive writing to poetry (or the other way around), only make
tangible that poetry cannot do the work of criticism, and vice versa?
Isn’t the “unwritten” discipline the “negative” that one ought to be
writing?

Katja Geldhof, in the our car, after the Watten talk: “ I think it
would be impossible to live in a place like Detroit and not write about
it.”

Or Oakland, or Buffalo. The Negative (what is not said): “White Flight”
in the 60’s, gentrification in Oakland pushing the population of color
to the Coliseum (East), gentrification in Buffalo (?) pushing the
population of color to the airport (East). The virtual collapse of
industry (Oakland, Buffalo, Detroit) as negative undercurrent to EVERY
urban narrative within city limits.

Olson:
“I take space to be the central fact to man born in America, from
Folsom cave to now. I spell it large b/c/ it comes large here. Large
and w/o mercy” (Call Me Ishmael).

Lorca:
“The duende is at his most impressive in the bullfight, for he must
fight both death, which can destroy him, and geometry—measurement, the
very basis of the festival” (In Search of Duende, italics mine).

Watten somewhere in Opera-Works:

     the troops are departing by boat
     I can see them
             but think of myself
             as better than nature

Olson:
“It is built as pyramids were built...There is space here, and objects
big enough to contest space” (Ibid.).

The constellative of the immediate environment effects the outcome of
(and the act of) the essay. The negative of my immediate writing
act: “Native Americans should not benefit from extra help” and “Black
contractors always have work, thanks to the government” (overheard
dialogue). This is the essay, to which all writing hence has been
negative. The negative of my immediate writing act: as I read about the
illumination of ideas, the porch lights (attracting a multitude of
insects) turned off. This is the essay, to which all writing hence has
been negative.

Negativity: “refusal of a community?” social negation? self-negation?

Q: In what ways does writing the negative create social change,
especially as the negative “cannot be represented positively”? A
presentation of any negative is from an endemic point of view,
necessarily limiting the range of representation of the negative. That
is, which negative to choose??

Scalapino:
“The camera lens of writing is the split between oneself and reality.
Which one sees first—view of dying and life—is inside, looking out into
untroubled ‘experience’” (“A Note on My Writing”).

“Maya”—infinite multiplicities of illusion as reality (from a notebook,
written near “How Phenomena Appear to Unfold” notes—Scalapino??).

Watten’s negative presented as an objective point of view? How do we
make a distinction between the negative and what we perceive to be a
negative? That is, the social ramifications of the negative are
ultimately arbitrary, as they rely on a single agent to “decide” which
narrative ought to be salvaged.

Camille Martin (notes from talk on Cognitive Science, Small Press
Traffic, April 5, 2002):

*Subjective experience can be explained empirically.

*“The naive boundary between me and the outside is my skin.”

*Radically question dichotomies (supposed): narrative, construction of
self/other, perception, centralization, dialogue w/ emptiness.

Susan Howe (from Bed Hangings):

     Ownership and ownership it
     is a maxim of logic the double
     of the object is that I desire it

An Astonishing Discovery


*********


On Sun Jun  1 20:33:29 2003, I made this discovery:


Unresolved kernel trap(cpu 0): 0x300
Latest crash info for cpu 0:
   Exception state (sv=0x103F1280)
      Backtrace:

   Exception state (sv=0x103F1280)
      previously dumped as "Latest" state. skipping...
   Exception state (sv=0x10470500)

      Backtrace:
      Kernel loadable modules in backtrace (with dependencies):
   Exception state (sv=0x10470500)


I have always wanted to make an astonishing discovery. For only through
the advancements of science, mathematics, and even technology, can
humanity progress into the future. We will never be remembered for our
imagery or music, our so-called culture, but for our realistic
achievements in understanding where we are from and where we are going,
and what the universe is truly like. Each of us in our own modest way must
contribute to this, and the above is my contribution. In this way we will
begin to understand ourselves better and the universe around us. If it
were not for mathematics, there would be no physics and no world, and I
would not be able to write this as I am doing right now.

This fall, our fearless leaders:

Poetry Workshop =AD TONY TOWLE
TUESDAYS AT 7 PM: 10 Sessions Begin October 21st.
Towle writes, "It is assumed that participants will be serious, practicing
poets. My critiques and suggestions will be made from the starting point of
what the poet has already established, not advocating a total change of
style. However, non-binding assignments will be suggested, perhaps on an
individual basis, to expand the sensibility.  Apollinaire, Keats, Stevens,
Neruda, Max Jacob, Williams, and O'Hara are some of the writers who will be
discussed, as well as more recent, lesser-known poets whose work will be
talked about before their names are revealed. John Ashbery has written:
"Tony Towle is one of the best-kept secrets of the New York School." His
most recent books are The History of the Invitation: New & Selected Poems
1963-2000 and Memoir 1960-1963.

Genres & Games: A Poetry Workshop =AD JOANNA FUHRMAN
FRIDAYS AT 7 PM: 10 Sessions Begin October 17th.
Fuhrman writes, "Our class will be a laboratory in which we explore and
experiment with genres, styles and voices. The goal will be to develop the
somewhat contradictory skills involved in poetry writing: the ability to le=
t
the imagination go crazy and to view work critically.  The class will be
comprised of three parts: assignments based on handouts, in-class writing
games (often involving giant ski-ball dice), and supportive, constructive
discussions of student work. Poets read will include: Maureen Owen, Wallace
Stevens, Robert Creeley, Alice Notley, Tu Fu, John Ashbery, Elaine Equi, Ra=
e
Armantrout, David Shapiro, Jayne Cortez, Paul Violi and others." Joanna
Fuhrman=B9s books include Freud in Brooklyn and Ugh Ugh Ocean.

Jai-Alai for Autocrats =AD BRIAN KIM STEFANS
SATURDAYS AT 12 PM: 10 Sessions Begin October 18th.
Stefans writes, "This workshop will focus on the relationship between poems
inspired by a sense of play - the way we appreciate words when they=B9re
randomly, surprisingly conjoined - and work, which might be loosely
described as poems that are subtly crafted, resistant to easy meanings, eve=

Hi all,

Dropped $5 on the Sunday NY Times when I was staying in Oakland a week or so
ago, and what do I see in the book review but a review of
Explosive/Spectacular Books editor's Katy Lederer's new book. Woo-hoo!

below's the text.

BOOK REVIEW DESK

Four of a Kind

By Suzy Hansen


Poker Face
A Girlhood Among Gamblers.
By Katy Lederer.
209 pp. New York:
Crown Publishers. $23.95.


When Katy Lederer arrives in Las Vegas for the first time, her brother,
Howard, picks her up in his new Lexus and drives down the Strip to the
Mirage casino. Las Vegas, Lederer observes, is ''bright and cheap and all
dolled up, like a drag queen,'' an appropriate simile for a city whose
artificial beauty can exaggerate its ultimate sadness. But for Lederer, Las
Vegas's brazen wealth is a revelation: ''It was the first time in my life
that I didn't feel lied to.''

The Lederer family, the stars of many lovely sketches in Lederer's memoir,
''Poker Face,'' is a crafty bunch. With the exception of the father,
Richard, an English teacher and the author of popular books on grammar, who
seems pleasantly odd more than anything else, each Lederer tries to get away
with something. Howard and the author's older sister, Annie, filch from
their mother's purse, sparking fights between the penny-pinching Richard and
their irresponsible mom. The young Katy lies for her siblings when
accusations of stealing fly, just as she plays dumb when asked if she and
her mother stopped at the liquor store for another half-gallon of Scotch.

Lederer's early days seem marked by choices between evils. At 8, she fills
up her mother's diminishing liquor bottles with water: ''Before completing
the task, I weighed the consequences in my mind, unsure as to which was the
scarier prospect: that my mother would see that I'd watered her liquor down,
or that my brother would discover that my mother had been drinking.''
Lederer tries to smooth over the trauma. Still, she anticipates and even
looks forward to the inevitable fights. After being lonely all day while her
mother drinks, cries and ignores her, Lederer sees family conflict as a
''narcotic, knocking us out.'' In fact, only one other activity brings that
feeling of woozy ''togetherness'': card games.

Those early chapters set up what the book is really about -- a family of
gamblers. Howard and Annie Lederer are indeed world-class poker players;
Howard is arrested and pays a hefty fine for running a sports-betting
racket. Katy's reclusive mother, having given up acting and divorced her
husband, also escapes to Las Vegas and joins her son's business as an
accountant. Katy, eager to belong, moves there to be closer to her
relatives, to write poetry and to learn to play poker. ''I believed that it
would save us, that together, as a family, we could play our little games
and still be happy,'' she explains. But she isn't very good at poker and
eventually leaves for the University of Iowa writing program.

Lederer, the author of ''Winter Sex,'' a collection of poems, connects her
family's lust for money to the environment in which she grew up. Her father
taught at the blue-blood St. Paul's School in New Hampshire, the family
lived on campus, and Katy believed that she and her siblings were out of
place among the fox-trotting rich kids who descended on her home turf every
year. Their outcast status also had to do with their being Jewish, though
Lederer mentions that fact only briefly, focusing more on class
distinctions. In contrast to being ''at the mercy of the school, which paid
for our housing, our heating, our three meals a day,'' the risky but
self-sufficient art of gambling and the defiantly gaudy world of Las Vegas
felt liberating.

Yet that isn't the most convincing explanation for why the Lederers became
gamblers, or the most interesting one. Instead, ''Poker Face'' delights more
as a curiosity than as a cause-and-effect tale. The Lederers emerge as
deeply intelligent and unpredictable characters, and one wishes that the
author embraced their darker sides more. Annie chides that Katy's too
passive while playing poker, and there's something equally demure about
''Poker Face.'' We know that Annie was cruel to her sister, but we don't
know why; we know that their mother left scars, but who knows how deep? What
Richard Lederer thinks of his former wife and his children is left naggingly
undisclosed. This tenderly written book, quite like its title, yawns with an
absence of discernible emotion. Katy Lederer, the family outsider, holds her
cards close, preferring to render a forgiving portrait of this brood rather
than a sharp one. If that's the game here, then she wins.

Ah, back to the primordial writing riddle

>>When Katy Lederer arrives in Las Vegas for the first time, her brother,
>>Howard, picks her up in his new Lexus and drives down the Strip to the
>>Mirage casino. Las Vegas, Lederer observes, is ''bright and cheap and all
>>dolled up, like a drag queen,'' an appropriate simile for a city whose
>>artificial beauty can exaggerate its ultimate sadness. But for Lederer, Las
>>Vegas's brazen wealth is a revelation: ''It was the first time in my life
>>that I didn't feel lied to.''
>>
>>The Lederer family, the stars of many lovely sketches in Lederer's memoir,
>>''Poker Face,'' is a crafty bunch. With the exception of the father,
>>Richard, an English teacher and the author of popular books on grammar, who
>>seems pleasantly odd more than anything else, each Lederer tries to get away
>>with something. Howard and the author's older sister, Annie, filch from
>>their mother's purse, sparking fights between the penny-pinching Richard and
>>their irresponsible mom. The young Katy lies for her siblings when
>>accusations of stealing fly, just as she plays dumb when asked if she and
>>her mother stopped at the liquor store for another half-gallon of Scotch.
>>
>>Lederer's early days seem marked by choices between evils. At 8, she fills
>>up her mother's diminishing liquor bottles with water: ''Before completing
>>the task, I weighed the consequences in my mind, unsure as to which was the
>>scarier prospect: that my mother would see that I'd watered her liquor down,
>>or that my brother would discover that my mother had been drinking.''
>>Lederer tries to smooth over the trauma. Still, she anticipates and even
>>looks forward to the inevitable fights. After being lonely all day while her
>>mother drinks, cries and ignores her, Lederer sees family conflict as a
>>''narcotic, knocking us out.'' In fact, only one other activity brings that
>>feeling of woozy ''togetherness'': card games.
>>
>>Those early chapters set up what the book is really about -- a family of
>>gamblers. Howard and Annie Lederer are indeed world-class poker players;
>>Howard is arrested and pays a hefty fine for running a sports-betting
>>racket. Katy's reclusive mother, having given up acting and divorced her
>>husband, also escapes to Las Vegas and joins her son's business as an
>>accountant. Katy, eager to belong, moves there to be closer to her
>>relatives, to write poetry and to learn to play poker. ''I believed that it
>>would save us, that together, as a family, we could play our little games
>>and still be happy,'' she explains. But she isn't very good at poker and
>>eventually leaves for the University of Iowa writing program.
>>
>>Lederer, the author of ''Winter Sex,'' a collection of poems, connects her
>>family's lust for money to the environment in which she grew up. Her father
>>taught at the blue-blood St. Paul's School in New Hampshire, the family
>>lived on campus, and Katy believed that she and her siblings were out of
>>place among the fox-trotting rich kids who descended on her home turf every
>>year. Their outcast status also had to do with their being Jewish, though
>>Lederer mentions that fact only briefly, focusing more on class
>>distinctions. In contrast to being ''at the mercy of the school, which paid
>>for our housing, our heating, our three meals a day,'' the risky but
>>self-sufficient art of gambling and the defiantly gaudy world of Las Vegas
>>felt liberating.
>>
>>Yet that isn't the most convincing explanation for why the Lederers became
>>gamblers, or the most interesting one. Instead, ''Poker Face'' delights more
>>as a curiosity than as a cause-and-effect tale. The Lederers emerge as
>>deeply intelligent and unpredictable characters, and one wishes that the
>>author embraced their darker sides more. Annie chides that Katy's too
>>passive while playing poker, and there's something equally demure about
>>''Poker Face.'' We know that Annie was cruel to her sister, but we don't
>>know why; we know that their mother left scars, but who knows how deep? What
>>Richard Lederer thinks of his former wife and his children is left naggingly
>>undisclosed. This tenderly written book, quite like its title, yawns with an
>>absence of discernible emotion. Katy Lederer, the family outsider, holds her
>>cards close, preferring to render a forgiving portrait of this brood rather
>>than a sharp one. If that's the game here, then she wins.

The quote regarding Vicu=F1a's connection of seeds to syllables that Stephen
cites is I believe the following (from my interview with Cecilia Vicu=F1a in
Ecopoetics 01, Winter 2001):

JS:  You say, or write or sing, "palabra, cuerpo de semilla."  Could you sa=
y
some more about words and seeds and how they come together?

CV:  I believe that there is an ancient association, of course, between
words and seeds, between words and plants.  The shamans believe that the
plants are the mothers of words, you know, especially the trees; they say
that, the words flow from trees=8Bso the fragmentation of the forest, the
destruction of the forest, is the fragmentation of song.  And I take it a
bit further; I say that the weaving of the seed=8Bbecause the seed is in
itself a weaving=8BI say the weaving of the seed is an organ of sound.
Because the seed for me, in itself, is a sound.  And this sound unfolds in
the growth of the plant.  I believe that a word has a similar reality=8Ba wor=
d
is a seed of sound, a seed of sound that can unfold into many other sounds.

    *=20

This is part of a longer exchange on seeds that kicks off the interview
(excerpted at more length below).

Jonathan=20



Cecilia Vicu=F1a / Spring Equinox Interview
3.20.2001 with J. Skinner at the Beau Fleuve B&B, in Buffalo, NY

JS:  I'd like to begin by asking you to briefly describe your experiences a=
s
an environmental activist or, you know, how you've been "active"
CV:  Hm.  Ok, um, failure [laughter].
JS:  At least as interesting as success.
CV:  That is the most important thing.  It was in the sixties, I think it
was in 1965, when I read that a group of scientists got together at the Rom=
e
conference, and decided that life on this planet was in danger, and they
decided to alert everybody, so this has been going on for a very long time.
Even then, in the early seventies, when we had the government of Allende, i=
n
Chile, I proposed a day of seeds, where everybody could go out to collect
native seeds, and grow them everywhere, in order to convert Chile into un
vergel as they say, which is like a green paradise.  What had happened sinc=
e
the arrival of the Spaniards was that Chile was becoming a desert, and
becoming more and more arid.  And so I always made an association between
the aridity of the soil and the aridity of the mind, the aridity of looking
away from all these ancient languages, looking away from all these
magnificent traditions and rituals and so forth.  Allende laughed, and he
said, Chile's not ready, and that was the end of that.  But it was not the
end of my project, because I started to do it on my own.  I would gather th=
e
seeds, and I would make little almacigos, which is the arab word for, you
know, the seed bed.
JS:  How do you spell that?
CV:  Alma, like soul, sigo with c, almacigo, which is, let's follow soul
[laughter].  And so, I could manage to create between two hundred and three
hundred little trees on my own, and then I had the problem of how to
disperse them.  I would go to political organizations that were working in
shanty towns and different places like that, so some of my trees actually
grew and they are probably somewhere=8Ba few little gatherings of trees, a fe=
w
little forests.  It was not a complete failure.  But thirty years after
that, when we again had a democracy in Chile, I proposed to do this once
more.
JS:  Didn't Allende say, Chile's not ready yet, but maybe in 2000?
CV:  Exactly.  Which turned out to be like a prophecy, or so it appeared.
Because when there was a democracy a woman from the government asked me to
do a project in Chile and it was just a coincidence that it was the year
2000.  And I said, yes, I would like to do the seed project.  With the
intent that through having an exhibition of my own collection of seeds,
which I have been gathering for a long, long time=8Band these seeds come from
just three places, which are the three places where I have spent my life in
Chile:  the place where I was born, the place in the mountains where I go
every year, and the place in the sea where I also go.  It's like a triangle=
;
it's all in the central part of Chile.  And I did the exhibition and
hundreds of people came=8Bbut my intention was that the children could take
this up as a project sponsored by the ministry of education, and this hasn'=
t
happened yet.  There was a museum here in the US interested in having a lin=
k
so that children both in the US and in Chile could start recreating this
poetic research into the world of seeds, where the poems could be
doublefold: could be poems with words and drawings, and could be living
things, you know=8Bseeds planted and dispersed.
JS:  I was amazed to learn in reading Unraveling Words and the Weaving of
Water (Graywolf Press, 1992) that cotton=8BI had never thought of this  =8Bthat
of course it's the seed parachute, the seed transporter.  I had never made
that connection.
CV:  Exactly, and for example, in this  cotton mother poem, where I tell th=
e
story of how the people, the Kogi, think of cotton, they say the t-shirts
that you buy in the shop are dead, you know, because the people who wove
them didn't think while they were weaving them, so they are dead, and they
are cold.  Instead, the cloth that they wear from the cotton they grow, is
warm, and it's warm because it has two sides: the inside is alive and the
outside is dead.
JS:  You say, or write or sing, "palabra, cuerpo de semilla."  Could you sa=
y
some more about words and seeds and how they come together?
CV:  I believe that there is an ancient association, of course, between
words and seeds, between words and plants.  The shamans believe that the
plants are the mothers of words, you know, especially the trees; they say
that, the words flow from trees=8Bso the fragmentation of the forest, the
destruction of the forest, is the fragmentation of song.  And I take it a
bit further; I say that the weaving of the seed=8Bbecause the seed is in
itself a weaving=8BI say the weaving of the seed is an organ of sound.
Because the seed for me, in itself, is a sound.  And this sound unfolds in
the growth of the plant.  I believe that a word has a similar reality=8Ba wor=
d
is a seed of sound, a seed of sound that can unfold into many other sounds.

EMBARRASSMENT OF RICHES

The grotesque imbalance of powers fuels my morning walk: azaleas, blue
phlox, curbside junk. The careers of several generals winding up in the
"cult status" bin, partially on account of the long night and a Lexus SUV.
Part the mysterious foliage of a potted plant in the company hallway.

No harbingers, no gusts of atrocious statement. We are a free country, and
in that dialysis we derive our nutrients from unfair advantage, not unlike
arm-wrestling in gale-force winds. The occult language denied to me by my
ancestry will emerge in news photos of the battered and the dead.

Fringe benefits. Cola. I had to try on an appearance I wore in the recesses
of a dream. In the dream there was a private anchor, and I sat on top of it
and rode it out of the water up onto the boat. The vessel of our sleeping
company lurches forward, flank or wing.

The people around you, brain-dead though they find their polls, learn you a
thing or two. In practice, the arms of the republic should embrace those
who differ in hair color, build, or perception. A sequined dress, barren
angle in the new world, apotheosis of corona and self-stink.

Wink. The news carried us into the souped-up sand dunes. Partially, I grow
nostalgic for the intimacy of a nape, but this timidity runs fallow under
rifles and manpower. I did not side with the victors. I did not lose my
change on the wrong bet, rusted machines of the hard-of-hearing government.

I get Japanese TV on cable and they have been showing the awesome
parades in North Korea all week -- there are hundreds of thousands of
participants in lockstep with dazzling costumes.  They form from the air
into Busby Berkeleyesque extravaganzas depicting the N. Korean flag and
other spectacles.  They have been going day and night.  One young woman
who defected said that the training is arduous and everybody aches.  The
commentator said that these parades were inspired by Leni Riefenstahl's
movies, that are among the aesthetic delicacies cherished by the N.
Korean dictator Kim Il Sung (did I get his name right).

If anybody else gets International TV, this is a must-see.  It's the
horror of the aesthetic used for the political that Benjamin was
discussing in the Nazi rallies.  They are undeniably sublime.

Hi Bill,

I had run out of arguments on the language question and was willing to
cave in, but now I am rereading Shakespeare's Richard III en route to
reading or rereading all the history plays.  In Richard III, Richard is
a big liar -- he poses as a Christian, he pretends to be friends with
people that he shortly intends to murder, etc.

My question goes something like -- IF we don't posit reality as separate
from language, how do we know whether or not someone is lying?  We have
to be able to do this if we are to survive.  I don't know if I've posed
the question very well, but somehow I do think that even children are
able to see the difference between what people do, and what people say,
and how without that crucial distinction they are lost!

Ha, it's taken me a while, and no doubt you will have already thought of
this, but I am still working on this problem in the back of my head
because I am not quite happy with my thinking on this important matter.

Anyone worried that the tarpaper covers of the new Tinfish will
"destroy everything in their path," consider that ziploc bags make
wonderful bookshelf prophylactics.  In fact, I'll throw one in with
each order.  So: order up excellent poetry and art and get a clear

Susan, I didn't mean that one should avoid the Tinfish in Tar, and I
certainly hope that I haven't discouraged anyone from ordering. What I was
trying to say is that materials have consequences, and those consequences
change the way a book is read. Rare and fragile books of course get special
treatment, but I'm not sure that it's a great idea for a magazine to have
to be treated as rare and fragile.

This morning - in need of an adrenaline rush - I turned on the Fox Network.
Rumsfeld was outlining Iraq's resources.
"My god it's not only the oil. It's water...and it's tourism. If you ever
walked around in Babylon, by golly by..."

As far as I can see, this guy - by the day - is getting more intimate with
the Tower of B!
At least his unconscious poet appears to be on target.

Everyone's death wish to collapse with the Evangelicals.

Babylon indeed.

 87 billion dollars and floundering!

In the mean time, if not already, highly recommend the movie American
Splendor. If you liked Crumb, this one forwards the tradition - in my
opinion, really wonderful, maybe great.

Today is almost a palindrome.
With my tongue on
the strings, gingerly
brutal with this turbulence
of unanswerable correspondence.
Everyone has soft shoes
and dark eyes today, though
Armitage engirths
fantastic tolls. So you want to be
rid of your arms? I can
picture you as a Michaelangelo
Venus, bottling the waves and
grounding in apothecary with your
shell. An inferno, to be sure:

Did you smell that other room
on your fingers as you lie back
after serious love, sliding
my mother's pearls over your
petals? A tall glass of
all the oceans, all the noise.
I'm dehydrated

After 7 years and fighting for a block and a hood and
trying to make a life for me, my dog, the peoples in my
Hood I lost my home in a Residential Tenancy (Ms Knots)
decision which took 20mins with no background as to my
life and my work and not caving into the harassment of the
landlord in favour of a slum lord Robin Kimpton who will
occupy my home in less than two months then move out and
double the rent and sigin it over to the wealthy. I lost
my home today and maybe my hood to a man who 'cleaned" out
his apts. of Natives and will not rent to nonwhites or
poor or working-class now that he's had to actually tend
to the basic needs of the slum flats which he owns. We
can't live in decent places and once we fight to make it
decent we are asked or pressured to leave to make room for
"decent" people. This is not right. I know that Spawn
would never let this happen. It may seem a bit loco but
here me out and I'll tell you how Spawn #29 made sense to
me and I figured that sonics, words and a little heart
could do something and chase the badness away and whip
darkhearts. I guess I failed. I'm sorry.

But hear this out-- I just want to holla.

It was 7 years fighting crackheads, pimps, dealers,
stumbling and tryin to keep my and maybe a few other
peoples' heads up and trying to do more than just consume
and take up space on this block and when it seemed livable
again I'm ejected and my home is taken over by the
slumlord who tried to destroy us all. Basically, me and my
dog did the dirty work in cleaning up the place and trying
to be community minded and now the soldiers are DISsed and
DISmissed. ...or as Professor Long states; "Gentrification
and caucasation, the new urban renewal." They tell me that
he can get away with this injustice. They tell me that all
people can get away with this sort of injustice and the
response is to shrug and say 'oh well' and lose a little
more of your soul and move on. I think we're runnin out of
soul, though. Can the good guys actually get a little
break -- I guess that's only for 'paperback heroes', ri? I
guess that was funny.

Me and my dog would like to stay in Fernwood/The Hood/some
call New PAlestine cuz we have not just lived here -- it
is our home and our hood. It has become a character/a
persona in my work, my short stories and it is spark in my
heart. It is a place I wrote a whole love letter to and
made it into novel -- with respect (fwuh -- i never
laughed this place or the people in it). It is a place I
was a scribe. I took that seriously as all scribes should
when they write of the peoples who are and once were. I
don't find all this funny. Some may find it odd and bit
crazy. It just happened and when I looked around it was 7
years and kids had grown up and I had written poems, short
stories and a novel about the place -- one I hope more
like singing than reading. It was a place where no matter
where I went from San Francisco to Atlanta to New York for
literary events and they knew I was from Fernwood in
Victoria, BC. It meant alot to me and people loved the
stories of the peoples here and they never laughed about
them cuz I never made my home and hood a joke. The people
here are not a joke. It was my purpose to recite and write
of the lives which were being neglected -- lives which
sometimes even the peoples here felt didn't matter or
deserved notice. They did and I wanted to be a part of
this place -- me and my dog. I could do very much about
world affairs but I could do more than most writers here
and I could use what little fame or notoriety I had to
drop some Knowledge and energy here. I was hoping add
respect to this place cuz it already had it goin on. I've
seen kids growup here. I seen the a school yard at George
Jay turn from a drug pickup joint to a place where kids
play.

Some people, and you got to hear me on this, have found a
place they say which holds magic for them which inspires
them to write poems, plays, music, novels, today; films,
for some it was Berlin, America, Dublin, Morocco, but for
me it was an odd little place with special tough people
who really shouldn't get along but managed to do that --
in their own way. Fernwood is like that odd little house,
just on Pandora I believe, which the city can't tear down
and is hidden away between corner chain stores, highways
and government buildings -- it has vines all over it and
just chills in ti's own yard. That's Fernwood for me --
just a place which wasn't meant to be anything and then
just chilled so right and you could get codes and graphs
from Ghosts to Village Idiots to community events, music
shows and radicals trying to warn us of a prophecy which
we didn't listen to and now "they've come for us". If you
assemble those codes and write it as a poem -- what may
seem random becomes a narrative -- a perfect linear
pattern of semiotics and fable. You can watch that from
your lawn in the mornings and by walking around the blocks
carefully respecting physical spiritual and verbal
language. You see that in the spirit of the kids as they
growup in front of you.

You can feel it in all the peoples who once helped build
this place dead and alive. You can see it in the people
who move to our Hood and get a new life -- breath again.
Maybe I'm crazy and maybe even amusing "a bit ridiculous"
but it's not too crazy. People will watch movies or listen
to music about places which others would call "hick" but
they can't see how this place is my Nebraska, My Matewan,
my Dublin, my Patterson, my Brooklyn, my Long Beach, my
Hood and home and the place which breathes with a story to
tell which goes back ages. If you can't be proud of where
your from, and the peoples who live there. you can't be
proud of very much in life now can you? and this is the
only place I have ever felt the need to fight for.

If we have to leave Fernwood something me and mine don't
want to do, then I hope that people don't let slumlords
make schoolyards into needle parks and bullies make kids
afraid to play and watch as girls and women are turned out
on street corners or simply shut their windows when they
here a woman , or anyone, scream or let slumlords bully
tenants. I would hope that they would watch the shop
keepers and backs so they know that no one is alone here.
I would like to see kids having free breakfast served to
them by our Fernworld occupants/peoples -- just so they
know they come from a special place and that they are
special in a community's hearts. Then it's harder to help
destroy your self or your hood when you know that they
care.

This may seem odd or even funny but I do suggest that folk
read a book called The Dogg Father by Snoop Dogg and David
Seay. Despite whatever opinion people may have about or
have judged the musican/rapper on being, it has a few
points to make on history and communities. You see in it
Snoop Dogg speaks about how it was engineered that a
communites/hoods were turned into slums, programs cut,
communities  centered destroyed and kids offered no other
opportunities of histories but depression. slumlords and
gangs. In the Snoop Dogg book he makes note of the choices
he made due to the social engineering. However, he does
note that he could rise above it because he did remember
when a community was supportive. He could remember who
were responsible for the fall of his hood -- it was a
city, greed merchants, the right-wing greed government who
made shiesty deals with slumlord property owners at the
expense of the peoples. .. B.U.T. the peoples could have
fought together and not given into fear and police state
tactics.

This is, if you know you urban history what is occurring
here in Fernwood and in other old working-class
communities. The choices offered -- crack it out, project;
force out all poor and nonwhites and leftist. There were
places where we all uses to assemble and chill with pizza
or coffee. Now, rents are so high and shops spaces are
kept closed. apts are rented at unreasonable rates and
only wealthy and certain class of people are allowed to
rent there. Slumlords on a free right of terror. OUr hood
has become exclusionary and not in favour, as if exclusion
of any kind is good, of our peoples but made in an effort
to push our peoples out and make the place another greed
and wealth centre with no heart. They wish to gut our
home.

So you may laugh cuz to take things serials or have
passion is a laughable thing and weak thing now but I did
love this place. Only someone who loved it would write and
do so much for it for free. Every place needs a mythology.
It sings for it. When it gets to the point which it is
singing then it only hopes that it is heard. I hope I got
to transcribe the notes right. It has a certain tone to it
-- a certan bassline. This place/my hood/barrio/community,
well, it became a place where you knew people cared enough
to help each other out. Where we have a generation who
were playing with each other as children of all faiths,
races and ethnicity's -- where colours gang or skin tone
didn't matter. It was place that should take itself
seriously -- everybody else who I've spoken with or met in
other countries certainly have. It's not really the author
it's what inspired the author to write that carefully and
passionately about. I did love the place -- it was a place
which inspired me, please believe it. Now lost to a
slumlord, geed,bullying and gentrification.

Peace for letting me holla at yuh.

Me and mine, we lost our home today . ...maybe our hood.
It breaks a man's heart.

I just thought you'd might want to know.

Other Things You Might Do With $87 Billion
By Russell Mokhiber and Robert Weissman

You can actually get a few things done with $87 billion, the amount that
President Bush has asked Congress to appropriate for expenditures
related to the military occupation and reconstruction of Iraq.

For example:

The World Health Organization (WHO) and other UN bodies estimate the
cost of providing treatment and prevention services in developing
countries for tuberculosis, HIV/AIDS and malaria at $12 billion a year.

The WHO Commission on Macroeconomics and Health estimated that donor
investment of $27 billion a year, including expenditures on TB, AIDS and
malaria, as well as to eliminate death and suffering from other
infectious diseases and nutritional deficiencies, could save 8 million
lives a year. That's eight million lives. A year.

The UN Development Program estimated in 1998 that the annual additional
cost of achieving basic education for all was $6 billion.

Prefer to spend some or all of the money at home? Even in the United
States, where the dollar doesn't go as far, $87 billion can perform some
pretty impressive feats.

For example, according to Business Leaders for Sensible Priorities, it
would only cost $6 billion a year to provide health insurance to all
uninsured children in the United States. You can provide Head Start and
Early Head Start to all eligible children for $8 billion annually. You
can reduce class size to 15 students per teacher in all first-, second-
and third-grade classrooms for $11 billion a year.

For $87 billion, you could eliminate the backlog of maintenance needs at
national parks nearly 15 times over. You could cover more than half the
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)-estimated 20-year investment needs
to ensure safe drinking water throughout the United States. You could
more than double the annual capital expenditures needed to improve
public transportation in the United States, according to estimates of
the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials.
You could provide almost half of the overall funding EPA says is needed
to provide clean watersheds in the United States, including through
wastewater treatment, sewer upgrades and nonpoint source pollution control.

It just so happens, as the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities
points out, that $87 billion is almost exactly what all departments in
the federal government combined spend annually on education, training,
employment and social services. So you could fund that for a year.

If you looked at the $87 billion as found money, and wanted to do
something unorthodox, you could eliminate California's state budget
deficit two times over.

And, you would still have enough left over to enable the Detroit Tigers
(baseball's worst team) next year to field a team full of Alex
Rodriguez's. (Rodriguez, at $25 million a year, is baseball's
highest-paid player. A full roster -- 25 players -- of Rodriguez's would
cost $625 million.)

We accept that having imposed devastating economic sanctions on Iraq for
a decade and twice waged war on the country, the United States has a
major obligation to support reconstruction in Iraq. But three-quarters
of the president's request is for military expenses, not reconstruction,
the request follows a previous $79 billion appropriation, additional
requests are certain to follow, and much of the money being spent on
reconstruction is being funneled as poorly scrutinized corporate welfare
to Bush and Vice President Cheney's buddies at companies like
Halliburton and Bechtel.

If one steps back for a moment, it is evident that there is a long list
of expenditures that would do more to improve the world, and more to
improve U.S. security if reasonably defined, than what the president
proposes to do in Iraq.

A strange circumstance has evolved in the United States. Military
expenditures can be justified at almost any level. ("Whatever it takes
to defend freedom.") Politicians don't say, "Whatever it takes to make
sure every child in this country has a decent education." Or, "Whatever
it takes to deal with the worst health pandemic in the history of the
world (HIV/AIDS)." When it comes to the military, there is neither a
sense of proportion, nor of trade offs.

This state of affairs is a tribute to the military contractors and
political leaders who have ridden to power by instilling fear in the
populace. It can be traced in no small part to campaign contributions
and lobbyist influence, but the problem runs much deeper than that. Fear
has penetrated deep into the culture.

But the administration's overreach in Iraq now offers an opportunity to
create a new sense of priorities. It is now even more apparent than it
was before the war that Iraq posed no security threat to the United
States. And the sums of money requested by the administration -- and
more will be coming -- are so extraordinary that they practically demand
consideration of alternative expenditures.

After all, you really can do quite a bit with $87 billion.

Seriously. A fan in foreign parts asked me. I could probably reconstruct a
bare outline, which wouldn't include that affair, but for my friend
something a bit more thorough would be useful. If it doesn't exist that's
also interesting.

Subject:      Protester commits suicide at WTO demo
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII

Larry Elliott and Charlotte Denny outline the main developments at the
first day of the World Trade Organisation summit in Cancun, Mexico
Thursday September 11 2003
The Guardian


The suicide yesterday of a South Korean protester during violent
clashes at the barricades protecting the WTO meeting in Cancun cast a
long shadow over the start of five days of trade talks.

In what friends called a ceremonial act, Lee Kyung-Hae, a farmer in his
50s, stabbed himself in the chest to show his anger at the trade
liberalisation policies of the World Trade Organisation.

His death dashed the hopes of the Mexican organisers that the heavily
defended security zone around the conference centre in the Caribbean
resort town would prevent a repetition of the angry clashes between
police and demonstrators that marked the Seattle WTO meeting in
December 1999.

Inside the conference centre, talks also got off to a slow start with
disagreements on virtually every issue on the agenda. In the key area
of agriculture, developing countries laid down a challenge to the
European Union and the United States, who favour only modest changes to
their lavish system of farm subsidies.

Supachai Panitchpakdi, the WTO's director general, was hopeful last
night that a deal to help cotton growers in four impoverished West
African countries - Mali, Burkina Faso, Benin and Chad - would show the
developing world that the talks could provide real benefits for poor
farmers.

But with the developing countries taking a tough line on agriculture
and the EU warning that the lack of a global agreement on investment
and competition was a "potential deal breaker", Dr Supachai warned
negotiators that they could not afford to leave Cancun empty handed.

"We should learn from the past and face the reality that we cannot
keep postponing decisions," he said.

The WTO is keen to see real discussions begin today in all five of the
areas covered by the round of talks launched almost two years ago in
Doha. These are agriculture, market access for industrial products,
special and differential treatment for poor countries, new negotiations
on global investment and competition rules, and a group of
miscellaneous issues.

In reality, most of the 146 countries represented in Cancun will still
be jockeying for position today, with negotiators only likely to get
down to the nitty-gritty in a last flurry over the weekend. Privately,
some delegates are already preparing for the talks to overrun their
deadline for completion on January 1 2005, with some talk of another
ministerial meeting in six months time.

Little progress has been made in the talks since Doha in November 2001,
and with developing countries in a militant mood, prospects of a
significant breakthrough this week are thought to be slim. Britain's
delegation in Mexico said last night that Cancun would be a success if
it established a framework for talks back at the WTO's Geneva
headquarters over the next 15 months.

An added complication, however, is the prospect next year of elections
in the United States and India, which will almost certainly limit the
room for concessions by both the world's biggest economy and one of the
leading countries in the developing world.

Hi Mark.  There's a brief but accurate bio online attached to the
Finding Aid for the John Wieners papers at the Special Collections
Department of University of Delaware Library which, incidentally, I'd
love to go to since apparently they have what looks like oodles of
unpublished Wieners material (I take it that they were acquired from
the novelist irving Rosenthal, with whom Wieners was very close in
NYC in the early 60s).

My review of "707 Scott Street" is on line too though it is marred by
one factual error, and when Wieners died it was reprinted a few times.

Dodie's story that David Bromige is remembering is called "Not
Clinical but Probable" and appeared in City Lights Journal #4.  It's
not a memoir of John Wieners per se but a reconstruction of her
association with *another* schizophrenic poet in the 1970s here in
San Francisco.  Because it's dedicated to Wieners, I think that's
where the legend grew up about her having an affair with JW but she
never (sigh) did.

Tom Clark's book on Charles Olson, which contains the story of
Wieners and his patroness Panna Grady, came out about the same time,
and because for legal reasons Grady's name could not then be used,
and she appears under a pseudonym, I know for a fact that some have
conflated Panna Grady with Dodie, so ridiculous on the face of it and
yet that's how legends are born.  By the way I thought Clark's take
on Wieners is a very good one and I always recommend his book though
I know many don't like it.

Strange but on Sunday a young fellow called here from Lowell
Massachusetts apparently he plans to make a video biography of John
Wieners and he has been in touch with lots of people starting with
Raymond Foye, Gerrit Lansing, Charley Shively and he's on to Creeley
next.

Hope this helps Mark.

Bush Resignation Hailed by World Leaders by Greg Palast

September 11, 2003

[Washington]  The surprise resignation of the forty-third President of  the United States, George W. Bush, on the second anniversary of the  terrorist attack on America, was hailed by chiefs of state throughout  the world.  Mr. Bush announced that after, "two years of bloodshed,  economic devastation, and spreading fear in America and abroad," he saw  no choice but to accept that, "I have held a title which I did not win,  and for which I have proven unqualified."

The text of the former President's September 11 address to the nation  follows:

"My fellow Americans:

I come tao you tonight with a heavy heart.  Two years ago today,  thousands of innocent Americans were murdered by terrorist maniacs.a

In the script I've been handed, I'm now supposed to tell you that  America is safer today, and that the world is kinder and nicer and  happier, because of I'm such a brilliant general in the War on Terror.

But who are we kidding? Yesterday, Osama released his new hit video.  The terrorists are having a picnic ever since I turned over our foreign  policy to Saudi Arabia and Exxon-Mobil.

And here's the point in my speech where my handlers would have me tell  you about how I've been praying hard, making it sound like I just got  off the phone with the Lord.  I don't know about you, but I find it  pretty darn offensive, downright blasphemous, to drag the Lord's name  into every cheap campaign speech and chest-pounding war threat.  Osama  says he talks to God too.  Let's leave Him out of the politics from now on, OK?

Look, in my speech this past Sunday, I used the word "democracy" about 11 times when talking about Iraq.  It's democracy Florida-style, I suppose.  Except we're not fixing the vote this time we aren't letting these people vote at all. "Iraqis aren't prepared for  democracy." That's what Dick Cheney and Saddam Hussein told me.

So we're blowing 100 billion bucks we don't have to colonize a country we don't want.  Rummy tries to explain it to me each morning -- oil  this and oil that -- but I just don't see it. And one of our kids dying there every day - where are their parents, anyway? My dad didn't let that happen - he got me out of the service. Didn't I look neat in that fly-boy suit?

And, let me tell you, I just looked at our nation's piggy bank. Uh-oh.

When I arrived, the last guy left me $4 trillion and said, "Be careful with all that cash in this neighborhood."  Well, I have to level with you, America: it's all gone.  The cupboard's bare and this year alone we blew half a trillion more dollars than we have in our bank account.   Man, I can't believe I went through all that dough stone sober.

And what did we get for it?  A Fatherland Security Department that's  trying to read the labels on everyone's underpants.  Think about it,  all this Total Information Awareness KGB stuff:  two years ago  Americans were the victims - but my government has made Americans the  suspects.  I don't know about you, but this guy Ashcroft scares the bejeezus out of me.

And today I'm told that over nine million Americans are out of work.   That's not so bad:   I haven't done much work in my lifetime either.   But my mama explained to me that not everyone's daddy can lend them an oil well to tide them over.

It's like I can't get anything right. The lights are going out in Ohio and the North Pole is melting. I don't get it.  I appointed all those regulators that Ken Lay told me to, and I got rid of all the rules that got in the way of patriotic Polluter-Americans. and what's the  upshot? America the Beautiful is looking like she's had a pretty rough night.  Won't be long before the whole country smells like Houston.

And now the stock market's floating face down in the swimming pool --  despite everything I've done for those guys on Wall Street. Even my plan to give every millionaire an extra million seems to have  backfired.  Greenspam says I've created "business risk."  Says I spook  investors. But when I asked Greenspam for a solution, all he did was  hand me a bag of pretzels.

Hey, I can take a hint.  OK, I'm over my head on this one.  I look back  over these last years, and what have I got to show you for it: two  years of bloodshed, economic devastation, and spreading fear in America  and abroad.

When I ran for this office, I said the issue was, "character."   And  just look at the characters around me.  I've gotten all their  resignations today.  And while I've got some character left, here's my  own good-bye note too. Let's face it:  I have held a title which I did  not win, and for which I have proven unqualified.  You know it.  And I  know it.

It's at this point in the speech where I'm supposed to say, "And may  God bless America."  God better, because Dick Cheney won't.  Don't  panic:  I'm not turning over this sacred office to Mr. Contracts-R-Us.

Instead, I've petitioned the United States Supreme Court to pick a  President for us.  Those guys picked the last one, why not the next  one?

And so, my fellow Americans, you can take this job and ."

Here, Mr. Bush's words became unintelligible.  As usual.

I'd appreciate it if whoever posted the fake news release about Dana Gioia
and his request for $87 billion could send me a copy directly (not to the
list again); I want to send it on to my personal mail list and I mistakenly
trashed it.  Thanks,

Ulla Dydo's long anticipated volume : _Gertrude Stein: The Language That
Rises 1923-1934_ (Northwestern University Press) is finally available.  My copy
arrived in yesterday's mail.  (Amazon, it should be noted, offers a decent
discount.)

At last, a book on Stein that really focusses on the writing itself. I can't
recommend it enough.

Dear Tom

And perhaps you may want to look at my review of the book in a forthcoming

Wondering if anyone knows of a translation of the essay "Informal poetry" by
the Italian poet Edoardo Sanguineti. I've checked World Catalogue of
libraries under Sanguineti but nothing comes up.

Thanks, Louis

>
> PRESS RELEASE SEPTEMBER 11, 2003
>
> Farmer's death in Cancun is not an isolated incident
> Hundreds of farmers every year commit suicide because of poverty
>
> CANCUN, MEXICO - Lee Kyang Hai, the President of the South Korean
Federation of Farmers and Fishermen, stabbed himself yesterday during the
Farmers' March organised by the Via Campesina. He passed away at a Cancun
hospital about two hours later.
>
> This was a deliberate political statement. Mr. Lee was wearing a sign on
which was written "WTO kills farmers" and other South Korean militants said
that his act was meant to "demonstrate opposition to the WTO which is
killing our farmers and destroying Korea's agriculture."  However, members
of his organization were unaware of Mr. Lee's project.
>
> Even though customary regrets were heard from Supachai Panitchpakdi, the
director general of the WTO, the trade organisation's media spinning machine
was working hard to portray Mr. Lee's suicide as an isolated incident.
>
> "Nothing could be further from the truth," says Maude Barlow, National
Chairperson of the Council of Canadians. "Mr. Lee's death must not be pushed
to the margins of WTO history. This death is tragic, but it is not an
isolated incident. Every month, hundreds of farmers around the world are
taking their own lives in desperation, as a result of the destruction of
their livelihood. This should be at the heart of the discussions here in
Cancun."
>
> According to the Research Foundation for Science, Technology and Ecology,
a not-for-profit organization based in India, between 500 and 700 farmers a
month commit suicide in India. In all, 20,000 deaths by suicide have been
accounted for in India and 20,000 more farmers have perished by starvation.
South Korea also has its share of farmers taking their own lives.
>
> They are driven to this desperate act by the rampant poverty in the rural
communities of least developed and developing countries, induced by IMF
policies (the infamous Structural Adjustment Programs) and WTO-induced
development.
>
> The IMF is pressuring India to increase its agricultural exports to pay
down its debt. The Supreme Court's Commissioners on Food in India found that
almost 70% of the food offtake by Rajasthan state government was for
exports, leaving farmers with little for their subsistence.
>
> The WTO impacts on farmers on two fronts: through the TRIPS agreement,
which paved the way for multinationals such as Monsanto to patent seeds of
various plant varieties, including basmati rice, as well as through food
dumping and agricultural subsidies, practised by industrialized countries
who hang on to this practice as a negotiating tool to obtain other
concessions from poorer countries.

'Three's Company' Star John Ritter Dies
By RYAN PEARSON, Associated Press Writer

LOS ANGELES - John Ritter, whose portrayal of the bumbling
but lovable Jack Tripper helped make the madcap comedy
series "Three's Company" a smash hit in the 1970s, died of
a heart problem after falling ill on the set of his new TV
sitcom. He was 54.

Ritter became ill Thursday while working on ABC's "8
Simple Rules ... For Dating My Teenage Daughter," said
Susan Wilcox, his assistant of 22 years. The show became
Ritter's TV comeback vehicle.

He died at Providence St. Joseph Medical Center shortly
after 10 p.m. Thursday, six days before his 55th birthday.
The cause of death was a tear in the aorta, the result of
an unrecognized flaw in his heart, said his publicist,
Lisa Kasteler.

"It's just stunning, unbelievable," Wilcox said.
"Everybody loved John Ritter. Everybody loved working with
him. ... Whatever set he was working on, he made it a very
fun place."

"It's like there is a big tear in the world's heart,"
actor Henry Winkler told "Entertainment Tonight." Winkler,
best known for "Happy Days," was to make a guest
appearance on "8 Simple Rules" and was on the set
Thursday. He said he got a call later about Ritter's
death.

"He was extraordinary in every aspect of his life,
especially as a father," Winkler said. "His children were
there at every moment of his life."

Ritter, the youngest son of Western film star and country
musician Tex Ritter and actress Dorothy Fay, came to
prominence for his role in "Three's Company" and had
appeared in more than 25 television movies, a number of
films and on Broadway.

He made his successful return to sitcom acting last year
with "8 Simple Rules." The show was scheduled to begin its
second season Sept. 23.

At the Burbank hospital where he died, Ritter was
accompanied by producers and co-workers, his wife, Amy
Yasbeck, and 23-year-old son Jason, Wilcox said. He is
also survived by three other children.

ABC released a statement saying: "All of us at ABC,
Touchstone Television and The Walt Disney Company are
shocked and heartbroken at the terrible news of John's
passing. Our thoughts and prayers are with his wife and
children at this very difficult time."

Ritter graduated from Hollywood High School and earned a
degree in drama from the University of Southern
California.

"I was the class clown, but I was also student body
president in high school," he told The Associated Press in
a 1992 interview. "I had my serious side ? I idolized
Bobby Kennedy, he was my role model. But so was Jerry
Lewis."

His first steady job was his role as a minister in
television's "The Waltons" in the early 1970s.

With "Three's Company," starting in 1977, his career took
off. His other performances included 1996's Oscar-winning
movie "Sling Blade" and a Broadway run in Neil Simon's
"The Dinner Party." He received an Emmy and other awards
for "Three's Company" and was honored by the Los Angeles
Music Center in June with a lifetime achievement award.

"Three's Company," about a bachelor sharing an apartment
with two attractive women, Suzanne Somers and Joyce
DeWitt, was considered racy during its run from 1977 to
1984. And Ritter worried about falling into a typecasting
trap after the show ended.

"I would get scripts about 'a young swinging bachelor on
the make,' and I said 'No, I've done that,'" he told the
AP in the 1992 interview. "Or they'd say, 'You're living
alone and ...'

"What I was looking for in my time off was something a
little bit different, a little serious, or funny in a
different way."

Ritter described his time on the show as "an education" in
quick-study acting.

"When the curtain went up, no matter how long you've
studied or haven't studied at all, you had to answer to
the audience. We didn't do retakes. If there was a
(microphone) boom in the shot, so be it," he said.

With "Three's Company," Ritter took material that was
considered risque at the time and made it acceptable
because of his approachable, self-effacing personality,
said Tim Brooks, author of "The Complete Guide to
Prime-Time Network and Cable TV Shows."

"He never aspired to be Hamlet," Brooks said. "He was a
true actor of the people and television viewers really
bonded with him as a result."

Ritter later starred in the television series "Hooperman"
and the early 1990s political comedy "Hearts Afire." He
received Emmy nominations for his PBS role as the voice of
"Clifford the Big Red Dog" on the animated series.

His TV movie appearances included "Unnatural Causes,"
Stephen King's "It" and "Chance of a Lifetime."

Ritter won popularity among independent film directors in
recent years and appeared in films including "Tadpole" in
2002, and the new feature "Manhood." He appears alongside
Billy Bob Thornton (news) in the scheduled November
release from Miramax "Bad Santa."

Ritter was married from 1977 to 1996 to Nancy Morgan, the
mother of his three oldest children, Jason, Carly and
Tyler. He married actress Yasbeck in 1999, the mother of
Stella.

Hi all,

The right honorable Jim Behrle helped Boog City out a few months back, taking
over as a stopgap measure on the eve of our relaunch when our original poetry
editor abruptly quit without explanation. For this I am forever in his debt.

But now that Jim's promised two issue commitment has turned to three, it was
time for ye old Boog editor to find his replacement, and I found a dandy.

Please join me in welcoming Stephanie Young on as Boog City's new poetry
editor.

as ever,
David

I just want to publicly thank David for the full series of Boog that he
was so kind to have waiting at his work when my brother was passing
through NYC on his way to Newfoundland from Edmonton.

I was able to get a copy of the September Boog to poetix listee Ben Bassan
in Tokyo through another brother who works with Ben in Japan. I'd hate to
have that paper route every morning.

Anyway. Thanks David. It's all about community.

bests,
kevin

So being new on this board I was just wondering if everybody on this board is
against war generally or just this war.  I've gotten the feeling that everybody
is a pacifist here.  Am I wrong about this?  Does anybody think that even WWII
was a good thing to join into, or a necessary engagement?

How about WWI?

How about the Civil War?

I'm getting the feeling that all war is considered evil, or something, no
matter what's at stake.  Is this right?

Also, in terms of the moms & dads query -- I have a preliminary tally.  Three
men replied, and they all like their moms.  Two women replied, and one did not
like her dad, and one liked her dad, "speculatively."

In the abstract, I think that means, but it counts as a yes, irregardless.

I would like more responses.  Also, I'm now taking a separate poll.  Who's for
war in some circumstances, name em if you wanna, and who's totally pacifist?

Personally, I think Hussein was a complete nut case, but whether or not we
needed to take him out I'm unclear about.  I am for WWII.  I also liked the
Civil War.  Bloody mess, but it had to be done, like oral surgery.

I also enjoyed Hannibal's assault on Rome.  Too bad he didn't get those
elephants into the streets of the city.

I thought the war against Grenada was unfair, however, and a little crazy.  I
watched it on French TV, and it made no sense to me then or now.

I also liked the war on poverty.  People say it didn't work, but the
African-American middle class has grown from who knows what in 1950 (I can't
find statistics) to between 50% and 60% (figures vary, and nobody ever seems to
define middle-class).

Has anybody on this list ever enjoyed a war, or at least reading about them?  I
like them pretty well on paper and in novels.  Light opera wars, especially.
I've been in a few fist fights, and have always lost, but enjoyed those, too,
especially in retrospect.

> > > > Synopsis: The 12hr-ISBN-JPEG Project began December 30, 1994. A
`round-the-clock posting of sequenced hypermodern imagery from Brad Brace.
The hypermodern minimizes the familiar, the known, the recognizable; it
suspends identity, relations and history. This discourse, far from
determining the locus in which it speaks, is avoiding the ground on which
it could find support. It is trying to operate a decentering that leaves
no privilege to any center.


                       The 12-hour ISBN JPEG Project
                       -----------------------------
                          began December 30, 1994


  Pointless Hypermodern Imagery... posted/mailed every 12 hours... a
spectral, trajective alignment for the 00`s! A continuum of minimalist
masks in the face of catastrophe; conjuring up transformative metaphors
for the everyday... A poetic reversibility of exclusive events...

        A post-rhetorical, continuous, apparently random sequence of
imagery...  genuine gritty, greyscale...  corruptable, compact,
collectable and compelling convergence. The voluptuousness of the grey
imminence: the art of making the other disappear. Continual visual impact;
an optical drumming, sculpted in duration, on the endless present of the
Net.

  An extension of the printed ISBN-Book (0-9690745) series... critically
unassimilable... imagery is gradually acquired, selected and re-sequenced
over time...  ineluctable, vertiginous connections. The 12hr dialtone...

~ This interminable, relentless sequence of imagery began in earnest on
December 30, 1994. The basic structure of the project has been over
twenty-four years in the making. While the specific sequence of
photographs has been presently orchestrated for more than 12 years` worth
of 12-hour postings, I will undoubtedly be tempted to tweak the ongoing
publication with additional new interjected imagery. Each 12-hour posting
is like the turning of a page; providing ample time for reflection,
interruption, and assimilation.

Subject:      Moby Dick & 9/11
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; format=flowed

Some months ago a friend showed me a brief piece by Etel Adnan commenting on
9/11 and its aftermath.
Adnan wrote that the best way to comprehend the actions of the USA was to
read again MOBY DICK--the wounded and maniacally revnge-bent Captain Ahab
righteously chasing the White Whale of Evil--terrorism--worldwide--
Adnan noted that the rest of the world would be watching, perilously, in the
wake of this immense chase--
by synchronicity, or chance--on 9/11 found myself reading Edward W. Said's
"Introduction to MOBY-DICK" (originally published by Vintage Books, 1991)--
Said writes:

     "There is a clear logic, however, in Melville's dramatization of how
once conquest, the assertion of identity, and the single-minded pursuit of a
majestic goal are embarked upon no real limits can be set. And the point
becomes, I think, that you can neither apply the brakes to such a juggernaut
nor expect things to remain the same.  Everything discrete, clear, distinct
is transformed by the energy unloosed in such a drive to fulfillment even
unto death or total destruction.  To read MOBY DICK is to be overwhelmed by
Melville's passion at eliminating compromises, middling solutions, anything
less than an ultimate goal to go forward.  Even though he mainly talks about
one ship, its master and crew, it is also true that he is unsparing in his
intimations that the novel is a national American narrative, a sort of
minatory emblem of the patria" REFLECTIONS ON EXILE  (Cambridge, MA: Harvard
UP, 2000; 368).

     "The anarchists did not only reject the communist idea of a
worker-state; they believed that the domination of one human being by
another was the root source of all vioence and evil. It was an analysis
which had far more radical implications thatn Marx's mainly economic
critique of captialsim"  Anthony Beevor, THE SPANISH CIVIL WAR (London:
Cassell, 1984; 24).

                        When people plan

Said's reading of Moby Dick, at least in this passage, is pure Classic
Comics.  It's Moby Dick without Ishmael or irony.

Mark, I was just gonna say exactly that and you beat me to the punch.  As a
passing analogy to the U.S.'s maniacal "war on terrorism" I suppose Ahab will
do -- but it doesn't get above the level of cocktail conversation and in any
event, it's a TERRIBLE reading of MOBY DICK the novel.  Ishmael, Ishmael,
Ishmael.  The novel, as someone once put it to me, is written vertically, not
horizontally -- it's characteristic activity is what you might call deep
digression.  Ahab, headlong and horizontal, cleaves to the surface.

With a squeeze of the hand,

-m.

who is Ishmael in our post 9-11 world but the American
citizen reduced to observer, horrified perhaps by the
war unfolding before him, but unwilling to condemn,
comment on, or be affect emotionally by it--

Starbuck--the moral precursor of Starbucks--finally
becomes the only one in any position to act; fails to
do so not over moral complication of killing Ahab, but
finally--however he may justify it--to his own fear.

Plus bonus points for prophecy:

"GRAND CONTESTED ELECTION FOR PRESIDENCY OF THE UNITED
STATES
"Whaling voyage by one Ishmael
"BLOODY BATTLE IN AFFGHANISTAN"

About 47 years ago, friends at U. of Minnesota wrote to me with
indignation that a talented young man had been fired. His name was John
Spicer. He used his name John for his article on idiolects, but after
that he was Jack, Jack Spicer.

I never heard of the people who fired him.

Barrett Watten was born in Long Beach, California, in 1948 and spent his
childhood in California, Japan, and Taiwan. After graduating from high
school in Oakland, he attended MIT and then UC Berkeley, where he took an A=
B
in the sciences in 1969 but also met poets Robert Grenier and Ron Silliman
and studied with Josephine Miles, who recommended him to the Iowa Writers
Workshop. He later returned to the Bay Area and began to form relations wit=
h
the group of experimental writers who would become known as the Language
School. He edited This, one of the central little magazines of the movement=
,
and co-edited Poetics Journal, one its theoretical venues. In 1986, he
returned to Berkeley, earning his PhD in English. His published books
include Opera=8BWorks, Decay, 1=AD10, and, written in Berkeley, Conduit, Under
Erasure, and Bad History; his collected poems, Frame (1971-1990), appeared
in 1997. He has published two volumes of literary and cultural criticism,
and since 1994 has taught at Wayne State University in Detroit.

Nadia Nurhussein was raised in Staten Island, New York. She is currently a
graduate student in the English department at UC Berkeley, working on a
dissertation about American poetry written in dialect. Her poetry has
received Berkeley's Eisner, Cook, and Poet Laureate Prizes.

is trivial even with the addition of the black bar

and morning in america arriving early in the calling forth of names
listen - new york does not want war - survivors don't want slaughter -
listen - there's been enough of us - we will separate
become the country of new york - become some sort of other world
the lozenge flag will go down easily

SATURDAY, SEPTEMBER 20th. Perpertual Motion Roadshow.
Bluestockings Bookstore, 172 Allen St. New York City. 8 pm.

The Perpetual Motion Roadshow is an indie press tour circuit with
monthly stops in Toronto, Ottawa, Montreal, New York, Cleveland,
Cincinnati and Chicago. In April, May and June, three crews of three
people did rounds of the circuit. In September, October and November,
three more crews of lively indie performers will hit the road, piling in
a car in Toronto and touring to seven cities in eight days. For this
month's schedule, go to www.nomediakings.net.

"...the Roadshow is fast becoming the best known and best organized tour
of its kind..." -The Globe and Mail
"...a fine idea whose time has come..." -Hour
"...Revolution of the Moment..." -Broken Pencil

SEPTEMBER will feature the bizarre and freakish punk rock zinester
Jessica Disobedience from Chicago, the wrongway hip hopper More or Les
from Toronto, and serializing novelist Dr. Wred Fright from Cleveland.
Meesoo Lee, a video-zinester from Vancouver, has graciously provided
some of his delightful short vids to be shown between the acts.

Jessica Disobedience is what happened when the cities of Detroit,
Philadelphia, Milwaukee, and Chicago decided to combine forces to create
a monstrous zinester. She's been writing zines for nine years, and her
current one, Safety Pin Girl, has been going strong for six. She also
writes for Razorcake, runs safetypingirl.com, and tries to get her other
stuff published, all while attending college. Come to hear her read
folktales and stories about loud music, beer, road trips, and crushes.

More or Les combines intelligent rhymes with funk instrumentals and
bombastic beats on his debut album, I only stop for the Red Ants. Known
for his funny, socially conscious rhymes and encyclopedic knowledge of
Hip Hop, More Or Les wants you to know the truth about music. Through
the magic of imagination, he takes you on a trip to Rap Camp where you
probe such long pondered mysteries as: What kinds of things can you roll
with your homies? How do you make “bling bling” rhyme with “gat?” and:
Where do red ants fit into all this anyway?

Dr. Wred Fright has written the comic adventures of superhero Astronaut
Urine Gorilla (Fightin’ Fun Comics), had a short story published in
Punch and Pie (Gorsky Press, 2003), studied zines and ezines for a
successful doctoral dissertation in English, and played in many an indie
rock band (the current one being The Joslyns). Though he’s leaving his
guitar at home, he’ll still likely break into song acappella on the
tour, while reading from his serialized novel about a garage rock band
called The Pornographic Flabbergasted Emus.

Hello, world!

The 800 copies of Fulcrum 2 ("Philosophies of Poetry") that we had at
the Fulcrum office are now officially sold out. Readers who still wish
to acquire copies of Fulcrum 2 may contact our distributor Bernhard
DeBoer, Inc. (113 East Centre Street, Nutley, NJ 07110; 973-667-9300).
They may still have some Fulcrum 2 copies to sell or may at least direct
you to bookstores that carry Fulcrum.

Small numbers of reserved copies of Fulcrum 2 will be made available at
Fulcrum poetry readings and other events during the fall.

We underestimated the demand: Fulcrum 3 ("Poetry and the Psyche") will
certainly have a larger run.

Fulcrum 1 ("A Map of English-language Poetry") is still available at $15
per copy in the US, $20 abroad.

Here's an obit that of interest to Ron and readers of Ketjak:

It would have to be pretty coincidental for there to be two John Spicers
involved in linguistics.  Spicer spent a year working at the Boston Public
Library and was one of the earliest and best reviewers of the Thomas Johnson's
then newly (1955) edited "Complete Poems of Emily Dickinson."  He signs it
John Spicer.  I have used this review in several Dickinson seminars as a model
of a great poet completely in tune with another.  But check with Kevin Killian
and Robin Blaser.

It's the same Spicer. If I remember correctly (can't find my copy quickly)
the cover of the first edition of his book Language is a repro of the cover
of the linguistics journal of the same name, with an article by
John  Spicer listed.

Soon after 9/11 Said in a statement warned that the US was in danger of
becoming Ahab, seeking blind revenge.  He was employing the popular
conception of Ahab, and I'm surprised that Melville's novel did not come up
on the list two years ago.  I spend a lot of time teaching the novel and
participating in the Melville listserve where battles over the novel are
commonplace.  Interpretations about Moby-Dick -- Ahab as dictator or
inspired seeker or enlightenment rebel or blasphemer; Ishmael as
enlightened observer or ultimate corporate flunky or passive sucker;
Queequeg as . . .  -- are all over the map, and I wouldn't easily dismiss
any of them.  However, the popular understanding of Ahab --and by popular I
mean by people who have not even read the book (or even seen a film
version) yet the story has entered a kind of mythic realm -- as an
incarnation of rage and revenge seems to have been etched into the American

Invoking a pop-culture version as a metaphor for other purposes is a little
odd if you carry the authority of a Said, but I suppose it's alright in a
non-literary context. In an introduction it's quite another thing. I
realize that we only have before us a very small snippet, but even here
he's conflating Melville with Ahab. It seems to me whatever one's
interpretation it's hard to see Melville as, like Ahab, passionately
eliminating compromise.

It's the same Spicer. If I remember correctly (can't find my copy quickly)

For anyone that hasn't seen the Genghis Blues (some poet must of thot
of that title) video it's quite the story, & the raw documentary style
of shooting & editing comes across to me as an asset rather than a
distraction.  You'll be humming a few of those tuvan songs in no time.
& for those that can't handle unadulterated solo throat singing they
also have a CD out called Back Tuva the Future (who writes these
titles?) which has a bunch of studio remixes of Kongar-ol Ondar in pop
& dance stylings.  Great party music for bored academics.

Why Bill O'Reilly is Crazy
(proof # A-82,648)


It=E2=80=99s the War, Stupid
<A HREF=3D"http://www.intellivu.com//main.asp?brand=3Daolsvc.intellivu.aol.c=
om">unIntellivu</A> presents commentary by Bill O'Reilly

For a country smack in the middle of World War III we certainly are a blas=
=C3=A9=20
bunch. We're worried about how much fighting the people who want to kill us=20
will cost and whether we have an "exit strategy" in Iraq. Craven politicians=
 and=20
crazed columnists are second guessing President Bush, who, at times, looks=20
like he's first guessing the nation's foreign policy. Since Mr. Bush, for so=
me=20
inexplicable reason, will not spell it out for you, it falls on me to do so.

There are around the world thousands of Islamic fanatics who want to kill=20
Americans because they believe Allah is down with that. These people are tau=
ght=20
from the time they are children that Jews and Americans are undeserving of l=
ife=20
on this planet. There is no negotiation with the most of these zealots; ther=
e=20
is nothing one can say to dissuade them. They want blood, and they will use=20
any and all means to get it.

A number of nations help these killers and allow the murderous anti-American=
=20
indoctrination to continue generation after generation. Iran, Indonesia, Syr=
ia=20
and Saudi Arabia are the most threatening to us, although the Saudis do have=
=20
some pro-American government officials like Prince Bandar, its ambassador to=
=20
the United States. Iraq used to be a terrorist enabler primarily by helping=20=
the=20
homicide bombers kill civilians in Israel, but Saddam Hussein was open to=20
causing trouble for the USA however he could.

The Islamic killers thrive on the Palestinian situation. As long as the=20
Palestinians are denied a state of their own, the propaganda machine that de=
monizes=20
Israel and America will roll along unchallenged in the Arab world. So the=20
only way to break down the hatred many Arabs have toward us is to forge a=20
Palestinian-Israeli peace agreement that both sides can live with.

In order for Israel to cooperate in this effort fully, it needs to feel=20
secure. Having the Americans in Iraq helps that effort. Also, the USA needs=20=
a=20
democratic outpost in the Middle East to put pressure on the terrorist state=
s of=20
Iran and Syria. A foothold in that region makes it infinitely more difficult=
 for=20
Al Qaeda to carry out its evil doing. Just the huge CIA presence in Iraq=20
alone gives the USA a major advantage in learning about terrorist operations=
=20
before they hurt we the people.

This nonsense about the United Nations rescuing America in Iraq is something=
=20
Aesop would have published. The U.N. is a chaotic chamber with no sense of=20
urgency about terrorism and no sympathy toward the USA. Now some of that=20
antipathy might be justified, but not when American lives are at stake. In a=
 perfect=20
world, all countries that aid and abet terrorism would be isolated and=20
embargoed. But this is far from a perfect world.

The failure of France, Germany, Russia and China to aggressively help Americ=
a=20
neutralize terror states is an outrage of historic proportions. France is th=
e=20
worst. The Chirac government lied to Secretary of State Colin Powell about=20
enforcing the U.N. resolution demanding Saddam cooperate with the weapons=20
inspectors. Then France actively undermined both the war and the occupation.=
=20
President Bush should level with the American people about the duplicity of=20=
France=20
and, to a lesser extent, Germany. I know this would cause an uproar, but wha=
t=20
the French have done to hurt America and Israel is unconscionable.

At the same time, the Bush administration must begin earnestly persuading=20
nations that are not overtly hostile to us that we don't want to dominate th=
e=20
world, we want to make it safe for everyone.

Finally, World War III is unlike any war in history, and mistakes will be=20
made in the fighting of it. The Bush administration has the correct global v=
iew=20
regarding terrorism but poor communications skills both within the country a=
nd=20
abroad. The sad truth is that most people don't even know that World War III=
=20
is underway and have little understanding of the strategies and stakes. But=20
believe me, you and your family are in danger. We must stop the partisan=20
bickering and acknowledge that brain-washed fanatics have us in their sights=
. And this=20
time there's no Geneva Convention and no limits on deadly weaponry. This tim=
e=20
there is no "exit strategy." It's us or them.=20

=C2=A9 2003 BillOReilly.com.=20

=20


They hang the man and flog the woman
That steal the goose from off the common,
But let the greater villain loose
That steals the common from the goose.=20

Constant apprehension of war has the same tendency
to render the head too large for the body.  A standing military=20

companions to liberty.  -- Thomas Jefferson


"America is a quarter of a billion people totally misinformed and disinforme=

hey everyone i just had an idea! (not an everyday occurence for me).
i wonder if Zukofsky's homophonic translation could be considered a
form of diasporic syncretism, in the way that max weinreich describes
in the first few pages of History of the Yiddish Language;  or the
way Afro-diasporic people in the new world combined the figures of
christian saints with those of the orisha from West Africa, by
transposing and combining textual/visual/sonic traits from one to the
other.  this makes the homophonic translation a strategy of textual
diaspora, a kind of rhizomatic survival-cum-reinvention of meaning,
language and culture in a new setting, defamiliarized to some,
refamiliaring to others.

The following is a list of poets that Gale Publishing is looking for essays on.
I've written a few pieces for Gale -- and they pay quite well.  I got 400
dollars for an essay on P.G. Wodehouse, for instance.  They generally want about
fifteen pages plus a bibliography (this is easy in the case of established
writers like Wodehouse, but much more difficult in the case of poets who are not
part of an established critical tradition, where no previous bibliography
exists).

At any rate, the editor Scott Bryson is a great guy.  He teaches at Marymount in
Los Angeles and is fun and easy to work with.

Subject:      Re: Moby Dick & 9/11
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; format=flowed

     Actually I think what Said is saying is that Melville is conflating the
book MOBY DICK with the country of the USA.
      I found it interesting that on 9/11 I was reading this by a
Palestinian writer living in the United States, and it reminded me of Etal
Adnan's brief piece in TRIPWIRE 6 that a friend had given me some time
before--the piece being re 9/11 and relating it to MOBY DICK.  Since Etal
Adnan is Lebanese and lives also a great deal in the USA as well as Paris, I
found this another connection along with the MOBY DICK one--
     The quote at the end from St Augustine and the words "nO One Owns
grOund zerO" are from two pages of my long visual poetry book called THE
DEAD SEE SCRAWLS, a good deal of which appeared this year in BLACKBIRD 5.
     The connecting quote in this sort of collage of texts, from Beevor's
history of the Spanish Civil War is re the anarchist belief that the
domination of one by another is the source of all evil and violence.  This
critique Beevor finds more radical and far reaching than one simply based on
economic critqiues of capitalism.
     Hence the St Augustine--and "nO One Owns grOund ZerO"--and seeing these
issues from another point of view, other experiences, including those of
exile, which are ones among ever so many shifting ones, from so many points
of view--
     The relation of the points of view of two exiles living in the USA is
important in my own current workings on a new book, OCCUPATION WRITER.
     This is both of course what one writes down when asked profession,
occupation for an identiy card etc--"Occupation:  Writer", and--a writer
living and working under an occupation.
     In this case, living and working in the USA since 9/11 one is living in
a country under the occupation by its own government, a government within a
government, in its secrecy intending to eradicate the privacy of others--
     Among a host of other plans, actions, laws, demands--
     Before 9/11 one sensed this continually, but since then it has become
overt--
     While also maintaining a proliferation of the covert--
     It is a time in which one is confronted with the question: "occupation:
  writer"/ "occupation writer"--
     This opens a vast new arena and field of daily investigation,
experience, thought and work--
      (Also reading--recently RUE DE RETOUR by Abdellatif Laabi;  THE LAST
SUMMER OF REASON  by Tahar Djaout, LEAVES OF HYPNOS by Rene Char, THERE by
Etel Adan, related writings by Cendrars, old classics like Camus' THE REBEL
and Dostoyevsksy's THE POSSESED--Pasolini--many more--Virilio's GROUND
ZERO--)
     To ask new questions, old ones in new ways--
     "It has to reinvented" (Rimbaud)--and Picasso's "I don't seek, I
find"--

sites with immediate implant placement. Describe the expression pattern of
Split ends cannot explain this tissue-specific requirement, as the protein
is predominantly nuclear and present throughout - Split tissue - a
putative tissue-specific factor in Wingless signaling. Flaps are used to
redistribute tissue and sculpt the shape of the ear. Flaps lessen the
chance of scar notching. Split Earlobe Reconstruction, cell line strains,
independently grown cell lines (pure strain animals), different tissue
sample from the same individual, split tissue samples, split mRNA.

Handling of Specimens: Split tissue samples into two portions as follows:
1) a portion to be preserved in 10% buffered formalin for histological
examination 2> a portion to be sent to the Neck - see below.

This could go on forever. In the future this will continue. Reconstruction
of "split tissue" spidered on the Net. Split tissue = between motility and
immobilization. Freudian death-drive. The link towards substance, effacing
structure. No, that's not true, an addition to structure annihilating
function, transforming function. To lower entropies, immobilizations, one
path towards deconstruction, destruction. It is split tissue that implodes
information, the implosion of information that splits tissue, neural
columns. Split finishes.

the way Afro-diasporic people in the new world combined the figures of
christian saints with those of the orisha from West Africa, by
transposing and combining textual/visual/sonic traits from one to the
other

I'm not very familiar with textual aspects of this -- to the extent in
kabbalah -- & have always thought of them as sign systems put into a
layered correspondence... is it just reading the (visual) traits,
attributes, and objects -- i.e., St. Barbara's tower to Chango's
lightning bolt, the seven powers mapped to seven objects associated with
the crucifixion, if you know yr orisha you get a different message than
if you don't  -- as texts?

I thought a lot of the sounds associated with the orisha that Nathaniel
Mackey uses were his excellent onomatopoeic conclusions?

I'm more familiar with the Cuban form of Yoruba religion, santeria, in
which the pun o'gun doesn't operate, and I've never seen any suggestion in
Cuban ethnography or literature, not in Ortiz or Barnet or Cabrera, that
there's an orisha who favors either whites or blacks. Which doesn't mean
that it's nonexistent but suggests that if it exists it's not very visible.

Ogun is generally associated with the crafts of small industry, like metal
working. I have a chain necklace of Ogun that I picked up in a shop in the
slums of Havana. It has 21 symbols of the various crafts, none of which I
can interpret, but none of them look remotely like means of restraint.

Shango (Cuban Chango), incidentally, is also associated with iron (tho not
ironwork), war, and fire. He's also the sexiest of the male orishas and has
a great many female devotees.

The Yoruba divinities often are patrons of overlapping cultural areas. It's
nowhere anything like as hard and fast as the Greek or Roman gods (as
they've come down to us).

I would also agree with Catherine's caution about the textual aspect of
afro-caribbean syncretism..

thought I would share Chicago's hysteria over our 2 baseball teams with all
the intellectuals on the Buffalo list and that fact that the last time they
were both this good in the same year 1906 TR was president-- maybe if we
have a subway series then more New York Magazines will publish Chicago
poets?  So forgive the whimsy but GO SOX

Haas,

the late d.a. levy once said:



       /chicago poets
       do not understand
       my pottery/


and i guess all i could add is that new york magazines will publish good
poems, regardless of geography. and you better hope so, because the sox
against the cubs in the world series ain't happening any time soon.

best,
david

In Lorain we breathe steel air
and dissolve, when our ill dusks
rain over paneled ranches:
 slurry through grit-stitched
fingers. Our children slip from the womb
tired already of the war to move;

I'm still awake after two, I have
the same strength traffic has

when it's wounded and's crawled
miles away from the teeth, to
watch its life silver in the grass.
I must be getting somewhere.
There are no virgins in Lorain, so
we pound ourselves down in
front of our god:

sleep is deeper after dinner;
what a thrilling danger caught
in the back of your throat

Hello Poets,

I am teaching these two Saturday courses at Cambridge College in Cambridge=20
Massachusetts. Since Cambridge College is open to the community, please pass=
=20
this along to anyone who may be interested. My students range from 18-75 (or=
=20
older!)  Cambridge College is an open admission college for professional adu=
lts,=20
if you know anyone who would benefit from either one of these classes please=
=20
pass this along. For more info, you can log on to Cambridge College's websit=
e.

=20
World Literature: India, Africa, and The Caribbean  Saturdays 9am-12pm

This course introduces students to writings from around the world and from=20
diverse social, religious and political backgrounds. A key theme of the cour=
se=20
is to examine how writings reflect the culture in which they are produced, a=
nd=20
how they suggest cultural complexities often overlooked in studies that are=20
simply political, geographic or historical. In addition, this course seeks t=
o=20
identify certain concerns that seem of universal concern to human beings=20
regardless of time or location. Finally, the course examines the issue of=20
self-identify as expressed in literature, and how interaction between cultur=
es=20
necessarily influences all parties involved. All texts are read in the origi=
nal English=20
or in English translation.

Intro to Creative Writing Saturdays 1-4pm

 We will explore the many definitions of what makes a poem a poem and what=20
makes for interesting storytelling. This class will introduce you to a=20
"workshop" environment where you will learn to effectively and thoughtfully=20=
share in=20
constructive criticism and gently-guided discussions with your peers about=20
poetry, fiction, and creative non-fiction/memoir. You will be simultaneously=
=20
writing and reading your own poetry, fiction, and creative non-fiction and a=
ssigned=20
texts from a variety of sources and writers. You will be asked to keep a=20
response journal and participate in exercises utilizing writing forms and st=
yles.=20
Our reading list will consist of authors who may also make guest appearances=
 in=20
our class. This will also allow us to discuss their book=E2=80=99s journey f=
rom=20
inception to publication.=20


There are free poetry readings at the Harvard Advocate afterwards!=20

Best wishes,
Prageeta Sharma

The reference to the review of "The Poems of Emily Dickinson" by John L.
Spicer is The B. P. L. Quarterly.  Lamentably, the exact volume and date
escaped the xerox.  However, it probably appeared in 1955 or 1956.

Last Friday evening, I went to see the Bilkent Symphony Orchestra's =
production of a piece called "Nazim," a setting to symphonic music of =
some of Nazim Hikmet's poetry. It was a stunner. The poetry weaved in =
and out of the music, performed with great dramatic emphasis by a 60ish =
actor. There were four other vocalists besides, two of them kids, a =
great pianist, and a flashy conductor with a long, silky pony tail =
cascading down the back of his tux. I didn't get all of the content, as =
my Turkish is still pretty rudimentary. But that was okay, better in =
fact, because it was a great chance to listen completely to the language =
and how it interacted with the music.=20

The pianist was a genius. He fit himself miraculously into the syntax of =
the poems. For dramatic emphasis he got up and grabbed the strings his =
keys were striking making sporadic and haunting thunk, thunk sounds. The =
climax was a tad gratuitous, with wave after wave of crescendo as the =
poet chanted "American Imperialism, American Imperialism, American =
Imperialism," but not untimely. The crowd went wild. Well... not wild =
exactly, but there was a great silent lift as everyone took deep breaths =
and filled their chests with the words and the music. The arrangements =
were calibrated for maximum emotional resonance. No harm in that I =
suppose.

The event also gave me a chance to see all my neighbors in action. The =
Bilkent Symphony is for the most part an assortment of musical refugees =
from former Soviet republics, many of whom I know. I see them every day, =
at the park with their kids and coming into the apartment block carrying =
groceries, etc. The Americans here call them "the Russians" but so far =
as I know there's nary a Russian among them.=20

In any case, Hikmet (1902-1963), who was a political prisoner in Turkey =
for 13 years and lived out his days in exile, is way popular all of a =
sudden. He's now routinely quoted by politicians and ambitious musical =
and dramatic monuments to his work are common.=20

Last year's January/February issue of the APR featured 11 poems by =
Hikmet, including this little set piece (translated from Turkish by =
Randy Blasing and Mutlu Konuk).

New Year's Eve

The snow falling hard through the night
sparkled in the starlight
There is a house on a street in a city,
a wooden house so far away.

The child sleeping on the pillow
is plump and blond--my son.
There are no guests, no one.
Poor Istanbul out the window.

Shrill whistles screamed outside.
Loneliness feels like prison.
Munevver closed her book
and cried softly.

There is a house on a street in a city,
a wooden house so far away.
The snow falling hard through the night
sparkled in the starlight.

23 March 1956

Small Press Traffic presents
Friday, September 26, 2003 at 7:30 p.m.
Yedda Morrison & Kim Rosenfield

Sianne Ngai on Yedda Morrison?s first full-length collection, Crop (Kelsey St.
Press, 2003): "From insecticide to plastic heels, no one has explored the
disturbing intimacies between persons and things that arise in a system of
exploited labor with as much insight?. Addressed to a world in which
everything is brutally functionalized (picked, pumped, husked, inserted,
breasted)?, her poetry unflinchingly confronts the violence behind the
production of the sweet." Morrison co-edits Tripwire and co-curated our
interdisciplinary Crosstown Traffic series for SPT; her previous works include
The Marriage of the Well-Built Head (Double Lucy, 1998) and Shed (a+bend,
2000). Her photography has shown at Southern Exposure and New Langton Arts. A
California native, she joins us from Oakland.

David Buuck on Kim Rosenfield?s first full-length collection, Good Morning?
Midnight? (Roof Books, 2001). "Here feminist theory simultaneously picks apart
a feast of fashion and (gendered) self-help discourse while taking delight in
the festivities?. A carnivalesque aesthetic?combines a strong ear for the pure
pop of advertising lingo and a surgeon's touch when it comes to cut'n'pasting.
She avoids easy moralizing over consumerism and media, implicating our own
appetites within the omnipresent public discourse of commodity aesthetics."
Rosenfield co-edited Object magazine during the 90s; previous works include
Rx, Cool Clean Chemistry (Leave Books, 1994) and a perfume, Trama. Don?t miss
her The Truth Interview (with Brian Kim Stefans; see
arras.net/truth_interview). She joins us from NYC.

And pardon the clumsy:

It doesn't say that on my Homer Hankies,
and the Sox still play three against the Yankees;
the Twins get seven against Detroit,
so it's hard for them to come up shoit,
however unlikely it would be far
a Minnesotan to leave out an r.
The so called park at the Metrodome
is bouncy as my so called pome,
but, on that profane plastic field,
the Twinks don't need to be more skilled.
Yet, if they play as bad as I write,
probably I won't be right.

Ron: As scientific studies go this is way beyond preliminary. As scientific
reporting it's not even that. Note that we're not informed of the size of
the subject groups or whether any of them had command of more than one
language. Note also the word "tended" in the sentence "The Japanese and
Turkish speakers tended to use straight gestures showing the motion but not
the arc. " This would seem to indicate that there were individual
differences within subject groups which, all other things being equal,
would cast doubt on the conclusions--either linguistic gestures and
physical gestures coincide or they don't, and if they don't there has to be
a reason. But it would be nice to know what sort of percentages were
involved in the tendency.

I am not sure if I am a bee or if I am dirt.  Have I told you that I hate
monuments?  I particularly hate the birds roosting inside them.  I hate the
popular songs that fill their corners.  So I generally hate people.  This
hate is like rotting meat, which makes me feel bad in several ways, or
plastic.  I don't buy anything plastic.  Well at least I try not to.
Rotting meat smells and I don't like that.  It makes me uncomfortable to
know I live at the cost of other lives.  I'm like that, yes.  I hate plastic
rotting meat and the very thought of an afterlife.  You know, people are so
stupid.  Plastic comes with consumer opportunity and I don't like that
either.

So I hate you and I hate your grief.  It was seven years ago today that
Sergeant Pepper played and played and the plastic smoldered and you
suffocated.  Goddamned popular songs and waxy figures with penises fixing
holes that need no fixing.  Madame Tussaud's little John Lennon.  It was
seven years ago today you bled and bled after you were dead.  Seated before
us like a monument to the soaking up of weeping black blood with towels.
Black blood running over linoleum brought by burning plastic following the
exploration of latex on flesh.  Encase me.  Wrap me like a plastic package
for it gets me off.  Seven years to the day they told you to play another is
splayed in a car wreck.  It smelled like rotting meat with that door frame
through your head.  To my wonderful husband, please clean up my brains.  I
left them on the road for you.  Like petals on that long carpet of blood at
the ceremony of reddest curtains.  Thanks for the memories.  Bye!  August 7.
They should make a monument out of that, your carrion on the road to be
picked like buzzards.  Or we can go back can we seven months less seven days
to a gun that blew the top of your head clean off.  You made a hat for your
parents to wear.  It's all coming up sevens.

But I want you to listen to me and my life instead.  Don't listen to that
grief.  Good god.  I carry a deeper wound because I say so and I will not
enjoy it, I refuse to enjoy it.  It is a burden.  I'd rather dig back into
the earth and live covered in dirt than listen to you or hear that applause.
Oh and I hate love, particularly the selfless kind.  When you give gifts to
friends in grief well I just hate it.  Heaven is for assholes, pal.

But I must be honest with you, for just a moment, since I can never be.
This is an impossible passage.  The applause fills the monuments and fills
the corners of my black heart with rage which I feel and bury deep in the
earth.  What heart?  My heart is your construction of oppression.  You are
the barbed wire.  It's rather impolite however to say it honestly.  But
don't tell me I'm passive aggressive.  John Ashbery took a lifetime to
become open and honest.  He made a career of running around the barn.  It
took little girls with exposed penises to have him stop drop and roll in the
barn burning hay.  Honest cocks in pretty skirts.  Or pretty cocks in honest
skirts.  Choose your adventure, I've chosen a lack of adventure.  So hide
those hermaphrodites, hide them under your tongues!  Because I hate you all
and I cannot tell you that.  There are awards to be won in the delusions and
the dispassionate aggressions.

The point Dale Smith was making in his Skanky Possum blog seemed to be
missed by many on both sides ("poor" Bill Knott, outnumbered, what, thirty
to one?): let's deal with the poem, each poem, every poem, on its own terms,
regardless of the poet's affiliations. Context, lines of development, of
course, enhance the readings of each poem, but this "discussion" reeks of
petty pedigree squabbles -- our breed is better than yours.

What I wonder is when this concern for pedigree sets itself in poets. I have
known many a 16-18 year old poet who can hold the opposing forces of Billy
Collins and Silliman's Tjanting in their minds at the same time. (Try that
George W.) Without losing balance, they can hold in their minds Dickinson,
Plath, Bob Cobbing, Niedecker, Robert Frost, Japanese and American haiku, O'
Hara, Emmett Williams, James Wright, Ginsberg, John M. Bennett, Gary Snyder,
B. P. Nichol, slam poet winners Taylor Mali and Sherman Alexie, and so many
others you might actually believe that poetry has the possibility to survive
beyond the current generation.

Developing writers delight in language. Language is foregrounded, though
they know nothing of L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E. Language, shaped, created, re-created,
in its many possible manifestations. They do not fracture those vital,
delicate fibers. Language matters. They know it. They show it with the way
they attack what they read, the way they attach, the way they tackle what
they write. Language is alive. They do not recognize schools of poetry --
nor do I as a writing teacher want them to at this point in their experience
as writers and readers. Lineage is important but it is not essential. The
poem is. To insist on pedigree thins the blood, kills off potential readers.

Best, Crag Hill

It's not a question of pedigree but of what one means by poem and poetry
and what one hopes they accomplish.  The very young you speak of have yet
to ask those questions of themselves. When they do they will inevitably
build their own canons. It's a matter of what they'll find useful.

Dear Harry,
I've been meaning to ask if there's any possibility of a reading this
fall?  I'd love to meet the man behind the messages.  I don't know about
you but
I find traveling more enjoyable if I have work to do--I love reading
anyway.  But even going to a reading is sometimes a welcome relief -- a
chance for solitude when you're generally with family.  A poetry
community is obviously a thin skein, though it's as robust as any other
I've experienced, with the exception of Al-Anon.

theorists, of the US 40s? i've got a grad student who wants to go to
orono (where she got her BA).

OCTOBER

October 4: Lynne Dryer and Steve McCaffery
Lynne Dreyer's books and chapbooks include: Lamplights Used to Feed the
Deer; Stampede; Step Work; The Letters; Tamoka; The White Museum; and a
round-robin "intraview" with Joan Retallack, Phyllis Rosenzweig, and Tina
Darragh. She is currently working on a new project, Catch As Catch Can.
Don't miss this rare NYC appearance! Steve McCaffery was a founding member
of the Four Horsemen and is as prolific and influential a critic as he is a
poet. His 20-odd books include: The Cheat of Words; Prior to Meaning: the
Protosemantic and Poetics; and the two-volume selected and previously
uncollected Seven Pages Missing. One of our most adventurous poets.

October 11: In Others' Words: Parody & Pastiche
"I am seriously interested in your parody"-Anselm Berrigan. & so, so are we.
And your pastiche. So much so, in fact, we've invited seven poets (Katie
Degentesh, Brandon Downing, Benjamin Friedlander, Drew Gardner, Jack
Kimball, Brendan Lorber, Michael Magee) who-occasionally or
perennially-"write through" others (names, texts and lexicons) for this, the
first Segue Parody & Pastiche Party.

October 18: Corina Copp and Nick Piombino
Corina Copp's chapbook, Sometimes Inspired by Marguerite, is just out from
Open 24 Hours press. Other poems can be found or are forthcoming in can we
have our ball back?, PomPom, and Pindeldyboz. Copp can be seen ringing in
the new era at The Poetry Project, where she plays the part of the Program
Assistant. Nick Piombino's "Fait Accompli" (nickpiombino.blogspot.com), has
quickly established itself as one of the most influential-not to mention
lively-of poets' blogs. In addition to his nightly wry and philosophical
musings, Piombino has also given us such books as: The Boundary of Blur;
Poems; and, most recently, Theoretical Objects.

October 25: Manifesto Marathon!
"What the world needs now is __________." Mairead Byrne, Rachel Levitsky,
Kristen Prevallet, Kim Rosenfield, Marianne Shaneen, and Rod Smith fill in
the blank in what outspoken poets of the future will recall fondly as the
first Segue Manifesto Marathon.

NOVEMBER

November 1: Robert Fitterman and Murat Nemet-Nejat
Back from Italy, Robert Fitterman is once again at home in the city that has
presumably provided at least some inspiration for his much-touted ongoing
series, Metropolis. Two volumes of Metropolis are out: one from Coach House,
and one from Sun & Moon. Murat Nemet-Nejat is not only one of our most
prolific translators (that Talisman tome of 20th century Turkish poetry
should be out next year), but also an essayist (see The Peripheral Space of
Photography, recently published by Green Integer), and a great poet himself.

November 8: Poets' Plays
Why should San Francisco have all the fun? Our day of Poets Plays might be
shorter than Small Press Traffic's Poets' Theater Jamboree, but we can
assure you that our poet-playwrights Charles Borkhuis, Jordan Davis, Ethan
Fugate, and Brian Kim Stefans (who is apparently working on a monologue
based on Klaus Kinski) are no less glamorous, and fully intend to "deliver
the goods." Or break a leg. Something like that.

November 15: Michael Gottlieb and Michael Scharf
Michael Gottlieb's many books include: New York; The River Road; and the
truly gorgeous Gorgeous Plunge. His latest work, Lost and Found, written in
the aftermath of 9/11 is due out soon from Roof Books: copies should be
available at the reading. Michael Scharf is the author of a chapbook,
Telemachiad, and the wonderfully provocative Vérité
(www.ubu.com/ubu/scharf_verite.html). Work has recently appeared in Mirage
#4/Period(ical), The Tangent and PoetsAgainstTheWar.org. His latest project
is tentatively titled For Kid Rock.

November 22: Process and Formal Invention
Poets Jena Osman, whose playfully intricate "Periodic Table as Assembled by
Dr. Zhivago, Oculist" can be found on her Home Page
(epc.buffalo.edu/authors/osman), and Tina Darragh, whose equally playful
"numb to dumb" can be seen on the DC Poetry Website
(www.dcpoetry.com/anth2003/darragh.htm) meet up with innovative cartoonists
Matt Madden (www.mattmadden.com) and Warren Craghead (www.craphead.com) to
show, read and discuss some of their most formally inventive work with an
emphasis on "the process." A rare occasion for cross-genre discussion.

November 29: Allen Fisher and Ange Mlinko
Allen Fisher is a painter, printer, publisher and editor; he has produced
one hundred and fourteen chapbooks and books of poetry, graphics, art
documentation and essays. He currently edits Spanner and is Head of Academic
Affairs at the Herefordshire College of Art & Design. Fisher exhibits
paintings in many shows and examples of his work are in the Tate Gallery
collection, London and in the Living Museum in Iceland. Ange Mlinko is the
author of Matinées (Zoland) and the forthcoming A Book Called Odile (Germ

himaria,
george woodcock is the anarchist poet. he wrote biographies of proudhon
an godwin (but i'm not sure his take on blake). and published a shitload
of poetry.

put your student in touch with me. maybe we can suggest a panel on poetry
and anarchy together.

a good start for theorists is Peter Marshall's _Demanding the Impossible_.
It's a well organized history of anarchism. Marshall's _William Blake:
Visonary Anarchist_ is also worth checking out.

I did a grad course on Blake and have a lot of this kind of stuff lying
around from my term paper research.

hope this helps,
kevin H.

Maria,

There was a camp of conscientious objectors on the coast of Oregon in a
small town called Waldport, for most of the years of World War II.  They
had to do alternative service, and spent the war years foresting -- a
very dangerous occupation and four or five of these men died.  William
Everson was there.  He's odd -- I know he was also a Catholic (I think
Franciscan) but was simultaneously anarchist.  The poet William Stafford
was also in that conscientious objector camp.  Kenneth Rexroth was
somehow in touch with these people, although I don't think he was
interned there.  Rexroth was part of an enormous anarchist community on
the west coast in those days.  He talks about this in his autobiography.
Kenneth Patchen was also somehow linked to this group (I think when they
got out of the camp most of them went to San Francisco).  The Beats were
very much anarchist in orientation.  Of course most of them were born in
the mid-20s to early 30s, so wouldn't haven't have quite ripened yet in
the forties but when they did ripen they did so in a very anarchist
(rather than Marxist) oriented community.  For instance, Gary Snyder, Lew
Welch, and Philip Whalen went to Reed College in Portland, and were again
somehow in touch with the spirit of the survivors of the Waldport Fine
Arts Program, as it was called.  William Everson was one of the leaders
-- and he published an anarchist oriented journal called The Illiterati.

As far as I know there weren't any women internees, and I don't know if
the men were allowed to bring in their wives, girlfriends, etc.  For some
reason the film critic Pauline Kael was involved with this group, and
wrote film reviews for The Illiterati (this is all kind of hazy in my
memory).  Everson is the key figure, and from there your student can
probably find all kinds of leads.  The Pacific Northwest had zillions of
anarchists in the twenties thirties forties and still does.  There are
two anarchist bookstores in Seattle, for instance, and they are
thriving.  Seattle had a general strike in 1917.  This remains the only
general strike in US history.   This was organized by anarchists.  There
are still groups like the Earth Liberation Front and others operating in
the Oregon coast milieu, but they've gotten interested in Bakunin rather
than Kropotkin and are starting to blow things and sometimes people to
shreds while still being very vegetarian (they don't even put yeast in
their pizza dough, for instance, because yeast is alive -- and what
isn't, don't ask, that provides any nutrition?).

The anarchists had a very tough go in the NW.  They were often shot and
lynched.  In a town called Centralia Washington that is about an hour
south of Seattle, somethng like fifteen anarchists were shot and killed
for organizing against World War II.  One was hanged by his balls from a
bridge, and then soldiers took target practice on him.  The soldiers were
acquitted, interestingly, by Merce Cunningham's father, an important
lawyer in the area.  Meanwhile, Merce and John Cage and others were
living a Bohemian life in Seattle.

At any rate, there's a very rich history there.  I'd start with Everson
to begin to recuperate it, or else with Rexroth, or maybe even William
Stafford (although he was a conscientious objector, he may not have had
associations with anarchism, though, as almost every religious group had
objectors to the war).

So far two poets on the list have written to tell me they are for war in
my little inquest on the topic.  One is rabidly for (I think, unless I
misread the message), and the other is not for this specific war (in
Iraq), but would like to be the costume designer for the English Civil
War of the 1640s.

I'm still curious, and as you see, I am willing to let all poets wishing
to weigh in on the matter of war remain anonymous.  I'm just curious if
poets on this list are generally against all war, or whether it is just
this one, with this president, or whether they are for all wars,
generally, no matter what.

Sorry for the tangent. I forgot that the original post was about the 1940's
because of the comment about ELF. Alejandro would still be a good a source.

Quick note: to date I do not believe that any ELF action has resulted in a
death. There mission statement is to directly sabotage Corporate America in
the interest of preserving what little is left of the environment.

I have also heard a story about Allen Ginsberg organizing an artists' union
in NYC through the Wobblies. I heard it from a Wobbly, so I am unsure if it
is true. Current texts on Anarchism are both difficult to find and also
there are many different understandings of Anarchism. To the best of my
knowledge there is Green Anarchism in Oregon, the Anarcho-syndicalism of
Noam Chomsky (of which I am only vaguely familiar), the Wobblies are still
around (I believe they have organized tech-workers in San Fran), "lifestyle
anarchism" proposed by Crimethinc., and then there is the most recent round
of Communal Anarchism. I would argue that the new revival of communes stems
from the Zapatistas in Mexico who organize around the principle of
"Communities of Resistance." Throughout the United States there are many
Anarchist Collectives that organize everything from Literature and
Magazines, to bookstores and agriculture. A friend of mine toured the
country by hopping from one community to the next. Then, of course, there is
indymedia which I believe is organized Anarchistically.

Bakunin? I hear Emma Goldman mentioned more by Anarchists than Kropotkin or
Bakunin.

Although it is always good to read the "Classics" there is also the problem
of writing about Anarchy using texts that are responding to situations that
existed before major developements of the 20th and 21st century. I would
argue that the writings of Subcomandante Marcos are of equal importance to
current Anarchism as traditional anarchist thought.

Oh, and I almost forgot the Situationists.

One good resource on Anarchism is Alejandro De Acosta, who taught a
Binghampton and just moved (I believe) to Texas. I would be happy to give
those interested his e-mail. Please respond off list.

Very well writ, Kirby, and true to my sense of that Waldport history - tho =
I
don't know if you can consistently conflate conscientious objection to the
war of everyone there with anarchism.
I believe Robert Duncan occasionally referred to himself as anarchist and
spoke to it as a west coast tradition among the local community of artists
and writers/ in the sense that a community of those making art would be a
place independent of government practice.

In the early seventies on occasion when I use to  contract with him to do a
reading for "poets in the schools" I always sensed he was a little squeamis=
h
about taking the government dollar.

Ferlinghetti made it a point not to climb City Lights into bed with the NEA
dollar - as well. =20

Kind of na=EFve, finally, in practice. Unless you view those on the outside a=
s
performing a kind of moral reflector that benefits those who work inside th=
e
civic frame.  The sixties generation - mine - who refused to join and work
within government institutions have had hell to pay from conservatives who
stayed the course and assumed positions in all levels of government. Take
Cheney, Wofolitz, the Neocons, etc., etc. Tho, from a certain point of view=
,
these guys and girls may now be viewed as odd anarchists. They're obviously
off on their own wheel - disenfranchising the country - and oddly enough to
their surprise going down on  a dead in curve called Iraq, etc., etc.
Pray we not be brought down with them. But so much damage already done.

But then again there are NGOs - Non Government Organizations often
intentionally circumvent Government directives (or non existent direction),
including the United Nations, to perform actions and service.  Whether or
not they be considered anarchist in any traditional sense, I don't know. Ho=
w
receptive a typical NGO is to the practice of poetry as an implicit
component of service is something I suspect is in the exception and not the
rule.  I bet, however, any number of recent MFA's in poetry or otherwise ar=
e
working within NGO's. If I was starting out again, that's where I would be.

Hi Ian, I should have been more careful about the lethal nature of the ELF.
However, in the journal ANARCHY: A JOURNAL OF DESIRE ARMED, published by a
professional male nurse in the south whose name I forgot (although I've
published in that journal it has been a while and I did so as a stated
liberal), there is a tremendous interest in the Unibomber, and in Bakuninite
thought.  I was also in St. Petersburg a few years ago when I lived in Finland
and went to an anarchist meeting and everybody was talking about Bakunin as the
top anarchist theorist.  It's true what you say, though, there are many small
splinter groups and no two of them agree.  In Seattle I heard a lot about
Bakunin vs. Kropotkin.  Goldman's texts were available but weren't widely
read.  Rudolf Rocker was important.  Even Charles Fourier was occasionally
bandied about as an anarchist, though some argued that he was a utopian
socialist.  All these ideas also get mixed together.  Even somebody like Murray
Bookchin mixes anarchist with Marxist thought, and the strains are not pure.
When I was in Portland a couple of years ago I saw the ELF talking several
times on TV and they were talking about their willingness to do tremendous
damage.  I think you're right though that nobody has been killed.  However, in
the journal ANARCHY: JOURNAL OF DESIRE ARMED, the Unibomber was mentioned as a
martyr and hero to the new anarchist groups.  In Portland across the street
from Powells Books next a pizza shop there is a good anarchist bookstore.  In
Seattle it is in the Farmer's Market (protected by the local government as a
landmark) and is called Left Bank Books.  Chomsky claims Rudolf Rocker as a
part of his lineage -- his book Nationalism and Culture was a must read twenty
years ago in Seattle, and I think was probably big even in the forties and
fifties, though I couldn't prove that.  Bertrand Russell and Einstein gave
blurbs on the back cover.

It's a different and rather intriguing glimpse into anarchist political
theory.  It was written in the late thirties or early forties because Hitler is
already described as the logical outcome of Hegel.

The Waldport conscientious objectors had to be pacifist anarchists though
because otherwise they wouldn't make any sense in their avoidance of war.  This
would mean that they would have been reading Kropotkin is my guess.  However,
there is another wrinkle which is that although early Kropotkin is pacifist,
later Kropotkin backs the British entry into WWI.

And a lot of anarchists are unbelievably violent.  Nestor Makhno, who ran an
army in the Ukraine, for instance, and who had to be obliterated by Trotsky's
Red Army; Bakunin's friends are described in Dostoievsky's The Possessed.  The
Unibomber may or may not have been anarchist, but he claimed to be, and he was
damned violent.  The man who shot President Garfield claimed to be an
anarchist.  Who is, and who isn't.  What does the word even mean?  If you break
it down arche means principle, and an means without, so I think it means
without principles.

How you can be a Dominican anarchist, as was Everson, is beyond me.  Maybe he
switched back and forth, or had some days of the week as a Dominican and others
as an anarchist.  Sometimes too the tension between two systems in a poet's
mind can be a very fertile situation.

Dear Listees,

Here is yet another opportunity to hear Experimental Theology, and
probably the last time in Seattle (we still have hope for Portland,
Vancouver, and maybe New York).  Also, note that Charles Mudede, series
editor for the SRI's Public Text Series will also be reading his
contribution to ET.

Robert

Saturday may be your *last* chance to hear Experimental Theology --
straight from the mouth of the Readers themselves.

     When:   Sat, Sept 20, 7:30 pm - 9 pm
     Where:  Elliott Bay Book Company
             www.elliottbaybook.com
             101 S. Main Street, Seattle
                 Free.

Reading from the Book will be Award-winning journalist Lesley Hazleton
(Jerusalem,Jerusalem, Where Mountains Roar),
poet/publisher Nico Vassilakis (Subtext, Subrosa Press),
and editor Robert Corbett.

Experimental Theology is a 27-piece collection of essays,
fiction, and poetry reflecting upon religion in its various
guises.  The second book in Seattle Research Institute=92s
Public Text Series following Politics Without The State (2002),
this anthology corrects the mistaken belief that "experimental"
or "independent" writing fears the transcendental.  Among its
widely varied pieces are an analysis of the ontology of Philip
K. Dick, a true parable about the unreliability of the written
Word, and support for Angelism as the new postmodern religion.

address.  For more information about SRI, please visit our website at

there was a whole group of conscientious objectors to WWII who, like
Everson, Lowell, Day, Merton, converted to Catholicism, so it goes

(20s-30s) anarchism
(conversion to) Catholicism (although, there were some people who
arguably just returned to the church, like Lola Ridge)
pacifism

service as a conscientious objector (or just being female and not
getting a munitions job)

I don't get what the psychologist is saying that
shouldn't be obvious to everyone.  When you use a
word, a visual image associated with the word you use
will tend to be associated with it, and will influence
any physical gesture you make.  A slightly interesting
experiment would be to have the people speaking
different languages mime what happened in the cartoon.

The problem is that even if  Japanese and Turkish have no verb "to swing"
the languages have a commonplace way to express the motion--as commonplace
as the everyday need to do so.  Whatever form that expression takes should
be accompanied by a swinging motion or not as frequently as in languages
which have the verb.  But no one has ever been able to demonstrate a
consistent connection between hand gestures (other than sign languages) and
words in any language. We don't normally  accompany speech with
full-fledged mime.

Dear ...

I'm working on a "bootleg" file of poems by the French poet Denis Roche.
Depending on time and whatever allies I muster, this could turn into a book
idea.  The material I have of his so far is:

3 poems in Locus Solus translated by John Ashbery
a sequence in the Paul Auster 20th Century American poetry translated by
Harry Matthews
selections in Veronica Forrest-Thomson's Collected Poems
selections in one of Serge Gavronsky's books on poetry in France (title
eludes me at the moment)
more work translated by Gavronsky for the Tyuonyi "Violence of the White
Page" issue

For you Googlers, there's a children's book illustrator named Denis Roche
who is not the same person.

*Our* Denis Roche was an editor of Tel Quel, a translator of The ABC of
Reading and I think the Cantos in to French, and is now (primarily?) a
photographer.  I did find the following list of translations:

From the papers of Eric Mottram:
"French poets: Mottram manuscript essay headed 'Under the influence of
Rimbaud' [1973-1978]; Mottram manuscript notes on mid-20th century French
poets [1973-1978]; a section of photocopies of modern French poets' work,
including Marcelin Pleynet, Denis Roche, Anne-Marie Albiach, Jean Daive
[1984]"

From The Paris Review # 42: Winter-Spring 1968:
Eros Possessed: A Play

From New Observations (a journal I never heard of before):
54. Ecriture - The French Mind -
Serge Gavronsky
January/February 1988
Julia Kristeva, Anne-Marie Albiach, Ludovic Janvier, Marcelin Pleynet,
Emmanuel Hocquard, Leslie Kaplan, Jacques Roubaud, Denis Roche, Martine
Aballea, Denis Levaillant.

And a book published by Pennsylvania State University Press called that has
a half chapter dedicated to his writing, published in 1999:
Poeticized Language
The Foundations of Contemporary French Poetry
Steven Winspur

I could probably get this last one in my library.  The Paris Review issue is
available cheap on abe.com.

Anyone know where the Mottram is available outside of his papers collected
at King's College?  Or what New Observations is all about?  Also, come
across any translations of Denis Roche?  Interested in making some?

Cheers,
Brian

We hung you and devoured you
Weakly
Speak softly
I came to you seeking a degree
This Nation has become a 10 for me
Where did my language go
These days I’m not feeling too
Clean
Lost in decease
Crawling through a corridor
Screaming with a muzzle
Cypher this
Struggling inna goil
Nuh ease up
Fyah bun yuh
Who’s on the gasoline?
A buncha
A inner-versionists sampling gutter symphonies
A missing note to this puzzle
Blinded
Reading inna zone
Regurgitated poems
Unliving inna city
On a corner stoned
Stealing
Greedy
Peckerwoods midgets
Feeding ignorance
Where my brutha Scientists?
 They call me ugly
Paranoiac in my deliveries
Cee cypher unsensuality
I fear those
Able to crouch at my cable feed
Transmit the thoughts what make my evil possible
Play the data from a N.I.G.G.A.
High and speeding to full capacity
Electronic stammer
Nuh gow
Nuh flow
Pill popping inna a mood altered joke
Crush a dappah inna final daze
Walking on judgement
My writs and Native sonnets
Attacking history with the incongruity of memory
Watching likkle girls diggin phantoms boogie
Aggression found in the soul’s unsensuality
Bit mapped to a buildings core
Petting bebop
Broken spined paraplegic B-boys
Busting up dances
Ignor this rant
You cyan
You get no 2nds thought on this enchantment
My words turn to data are mighty
Scheming with metaphor
Measurements
Enslaved to the metric
Jamming magazines with bullets

Atomic electronic rentbwais with the flow of Lord Comic
Let’s begin bwai
Send the sonic Kai to mash it to physical decoys to snatch the grip from
the Westend
Ripped from the vault they ciphered for the Hipocalyspe Now.
This for the cracked loafs of wasted youth. This for the disabled
hunting for condos made from cardboard boxes. This was the payback for
hemp wrapped bodies floating in the ocean. Water holding a likkle girl
cut to shreds with oxes
This is for Ian Hunter the victim of wicked collusion.
Native bwais get strangled
Proper mix up
Leggo a cuss cuss
Inna tangle wiph beat cops
Pretty view East of Vancouver
Far from Eden
Caught on camera
A message to deliver
Pagers go off sounding an alarm
"We comin to do you harm"
At airports terminating the
System of down pressing
News captured in sculptures of Dawson
Escaping to foreign Lands
Developin cells
Another brutha fell
Tricks with handcuffs and gun shots
My compadre in the agony of Griffith
Cap a metal seal in his knot meat
Memories fill Anthony with our defeat
Our Elder’s
Striped bare on a beach
Where is this road
What leads to Dallas
Tell us
Filmic feet loaded to speak
Buried in sleet
50 to 60
All the buried girls lined up unpretty
Contemplating just one day of …
Peace

A New Project by August Highland

***********************

Go Ego Go
www.go-ego-go.com

***********************
A Total of 9,000 volumes
15 Series with 600 volumes in each series
Each volume 700-1,000 pages in length
Price For Each Volume $450
(Price Increase From $360 Effective September 15, 2003)


***********************

(From The Introduction)


Our work is called "Next-Gen Nanopoetics. We substitute rhyme and meter
with truncated textstrings (abbreviated phrases), which we reiterate in
conformity to a series of different patterns. For example, in the
"MITHUNA" series, Shelly Rath uses an "AABCCDBBA" pattern:


where my dear
where my dear
Pranayam as by
thought Monks.
thought Monks.
Kulun hard eyes
Pranayam as by
Pranayam as by
where my dear



Our work is medicine, producing an incantatory phraseology or rhythm and
calling forth a rich emotional response in the reader that is complex
with memories that are both individual and universal to humankind. The
reiterated phrases resonate with spirit life and bring restorative
balance to our souls by invoking the presence of our biological and
cultural ancestors.

There are 15 series in our project. Each series contains 600 literary
objects. Each literary object is roughly 600-100 pages in length. The
price of each volume is $450.

Next-Gen Nanopoetics represents a giant leap forward in the ongoing
advancement of the western literary tradition to which all of August
Highland's ouevre is devoted. As August Highland says, "If I am not
following in the footsteps of tradition and giving new direction to many
generations for centuries, then I might as well be flipping burgers."

Hi all,

I'm doing this writing workshop in October and I'm hoping that folks can
forward this to interested parties.

Thanks much,
Lisa Jarnot


Announcing a poetry writing workshop
at the Bowery Poetry Club


GREAT COMPANIONS:
A WORKSHOP IN POETICAL DERIVATION

with Lisa Jarnot


Dante said to Virgil "Thou art my master and my author". What poet would you
name as Dante names Virgil? The focus of this workshop is poetic lineage,
imitation and influence. We'll look at specific examples (Allen Ginsberg and
William Blake, Frank O'Hara and Vladimir Mayakovsky, Bernadette Mayer and
Catullus) and we'll also explore the ways that we might expand our own
poetry by emulating various styles and forms.

I agree, Mark. It's not as if all poetry were created equal, or as if each
style represented a given "brand" among others for a reader to take off the
shelf at a given moment. Those people who can hold Billy Collins and
Silliman's Tjanting in their minds in the same time without making
distinctions or reacting simply haven't formed any aesthetic (and hence
ethical) opinions yet, or aren't reading carefully, although I suppose one
could find some really obscure and arbitrary line connecting common
qualities in the work of Collins and Silliman (are there any?). But if that
reader is to be influenced by both these poets in his or her own work, I
suspect what s/he will probably end up with is watered-down Silliman.

A good recent example of this failure to make qualitative distinctions
between different styles, to market them as if they were feel-good brand
names, is the newly-christened Elliptical poets. Here we have
demographically (and hence artifically) created movement that includes John
Ashbery, Clayton Eshleman, Jorie Graham, and some of the Dean Young-era AWP
"surrealists". What do these poets have in common? Beats me. There is no
self-determination by the artists themselves here, there is only a kind of
cynical concern with branding. The last lines of "And Ut Pictura Poesis is
Her Name" might be given a second look under such circumstances.

I also agree with Craig that an encounter with language itself is paramount
for writing and reading, but need to make the point that this is not a kind
of carte blanche for not thinking, or just "going with the flow." Poetry
does things, and what it does, how it does, is important.

It's not a question of pedigree but of what one means by poem and poetry
and what one hopes they accomplish.  The very young you speak of have yet
to ask those questions of themselves. When they do they will inevitably
build their own canons. It's a matter of what they'll find useful.

Subject:      Poets for the Millennium -- new series
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="iso-8859-1"
Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable

Pierre Joris and Jerome Rothenberg
are pleased to announce that their series

POETS FOR THE MILLENNIUM

at The University of California Press

has just published its two first volumes, Andr=E9 Breton Selections =
edited by Mark Polizzotti and Maria Sabina Selections, edited by Jerome =
Rothenberg.

Global in scope, experimental in structure, and revolutionary in =
content, the volumes in the Poets for the Millennium series are meant to =
provide valuable introductions to poets who have been at the forefront =
of innovative and visionary poetry from the beginning of the twentieth =
century to the present day. Each book consists of a selection of poetry =
and prose, supplemented by commentaries and documents, and edited and =
introduced by a poet or scholar with a fresh and radical approach to the =
subject. The books effectively build on and extend the work begun in the =
two volumes of Poems for the Millennium: The University of California =
Book of Modern and Postmodern Poetry. The first two books in the series =
are available now. The next books in the series, to be published in the =
fall of 2004, are a volume of Paul Celan selections, edited by Pierre =
Joris, and one of Jos=E9 Lezama Lima edited by Ernesto Livon-Grosman, to =
be followed in 2005 by a Gertrude Stein selection edited by Joan =
Retallack.

_Andr=E9 Breton: Selections_ edited and with an introduction by Mark =
Polizzotti.
Poets for the Millennium, 1.

Founder of the Surrealist movement, Andr=E9 Breton has also come to be =
recognized as one of the twentieth century's most innovative and =
influential poets. The inaugural volume in the Poets for the Millennium =
series, Andr=E9 Breton offers the most comprehensive selection available =
in English of Breton's poetry, along with a selection of his major prose =
writings. The translations, a number of which are published here for the =
first time, are by some of the most notable poets in our language, =
including David Antin, Paul Auster, Samuel Beckett, Michael Benedikt, =
Robert Duncan, David Gascoyne, and Charles Simic. This volume also =
includes an extensive biographical and thematic introduction by Mark =
Polizzotti, which sets the poems in the context of Breton's life and =
overall career.

"This is a kind of "essence of Breton", variously translated by some of =
our finest writers, each of whom highlights different facets of Breton's =
complex work. Mark Polizzotti's useful introduction provides context and =
a brief analysis of the artist and his times." -- Diane di Prima, author =
of Recollections of My Life as a Woman.

"Mark Polizzotti, who is a poet, a translator, and the author of the =
definitive biography of Andr=E9 Breton, has chosen stellar translations =
of Breton's dazzling poetry and placed it in its lively context. This =
shapely introduction to the life and work of Andr=E9 Breton is smart, =
concise, and exciting. I cannot imagine a better one." -- Ron Padgett, =
poet and translator of The Complete Poems of Blaise Cendrars.

"The Poets for the Millennium Series generally and Andr=E9 Breton's =
Selected Works specifically offers a workable image of an author and the =
work and the conjuncture, all at once. What comes across is a vivid =
presentation of Andre Breton not just as an art czar, a manifesto =
merchant, but a serious, haunted, inventive and strangely profound poet =
of the imagination, who invented or archeologized new ways of dreaming, =
but insisted on bearing witness with them in the actual world. =
Polizzotti does justice--as I think no other writer has--to the double =
burden of Breton's work." -- Robert Kelly

"A superbly chosen selection of Breton's poetry and prose, translated in =
every case with an elegant intelligence, and preceded by an unusually =
thorough introduction showing quite exactly how the poet's life informed =
each epoch of his work. It proves again the remarkable un-boringness of =
Breton, and how important he is now to our own poetry and to us.-- Mary =
Ann Caws, author of The Surrealist Look: An Erotics of Encounter and =
editor of The Surrealist Painters and Poets.


_Maria Sabina: Selections_ edited by Jerome Rothenberg. With =
translations and commentaries by Alvaro Estrada and Others
Poets for the Millennium, 2

A shaman and visionary--not a poet in any ordinary sense--Mar=EDa Sabina =
lived out her life in the Oaxacan mountain village of Huautla de =
Jim=E9nez, and yet her words, always sung or spoken, have carried far =
and wide, a principal instance and a powerful reminder of how poetry can =
arise in a context far removed from literature as such. Seeking cures =
through language--with the help of Psilocybe mushrooms, said to be the =
source of language itself--she was, as Henry Munn describes her, "a =
genius [who] emerges from the soil of the communal, =
religious-therapeutic folk poetry of a native Mexican campesino people." =
She may also have been, in the words of the Mexican poet Homero Aridjis, =
"the greatest visionary poet in twentieth-century Latin America."

These selections include a generous presentation from Sabina's recorded =
chants and a complete English translation of her oral autobiography, her =
vida, as written and arranged in her native language by her fellow =
Mazatec Alvaro Estrada. Accompanying essays and poems include an =
introduction to "The Life of Mar=EDa Sabina" by Estrada, an early =
description of a nighttime "mushroom velada" by the ethnomycologist R. =
Gordon Wasson, an essay by Henry Munn relating the language of Sabina's =
chants to those of other Mazatec shamans, and more.

"Mar=EDa Sabina's Selected Works introduces and enhances the =
understanding of one of the world's most remarkable poets. Mr. =
Rothenberg frames her work within the larger context of 'ethnopoetics' =
with no academic reductionism whatsoever, a rare and indispensable =
service to a 'world poet' such as Maria Sabina. The translation of Maria =
Sabina, her 'autobiography' and her oral poetry, is exquisite, powerful, =
rendered with linguistic dignity." -- Howard Norman

"This book transmits not only a full and rich experience with one of the =
most extraordinary personalities and poetic voices of our time, but also =
a great lesson in our understanding of the relations between religious =
inspiration and its artistic expression. It enriches our perceptions of =
the nature and possibilities of oral composition, complementing what we =
already know of it from the study of the Homeric and other poems in its =
great tradition." --  George Economou

"Mar=EDa Sabina is one of the great figures of American shamanism. Her =
Chants is a masterpiece of indigenous visionary poetry. Her Life is the =
account of a woman who transcended her own culture and its material =
poverty to become one of the great women of the twentieth century. The =
veneration of her work continues beyond her death. To read her is to =
embark on a journey to the world of the extrasensorial." -- Homero =
Aridjis

"In the chants of Mar=EDa Sabina, we can appreciate the interplay of =
individual invention and traditional liturgy within the oral creativity =
of a non-literate society. The recordings of her words that have saved =
them from oblivion give us the opportunity to glimpse the emergence of a =
genius from the soil of the communal, religious folk poetry of a native =
Mexican campesino people." -- Henry Munn

Hi everyone, I'd like to announce this art show opening in SF 9/27. It's called
FREE MATTRESS and it features Will Yackulic (SF), Canadian artists Marc Bell
and Amy Lockhart, and me, and though it's rash to talk about the future this
way I think it's going to be a pretty sweet show. What am I going to try to
tell you about it, it's different from what you've seen before. Works on paper
and off. Messing with your mind. Reaching in for those heart-strings. Signs and
omens of you don't even know what. Will it have poetry? Yes, but remember that
doesn't always involve words.

Will's and my stuff you know, just look in your bookcase. Amy and Marc's you
may know too, if not now then soon my pets. Marc's new collection _Shrimpy and
Paul and Friends_ (Highwater Books, 2003) is the best thing in comics since,
like, ever. The show is at the new location of the Pond gallery:

324 14th St. btw/ Valencia & Mission, right across from the old armory.
The gallery is open Sat.-Sun. from 3-8 pm & by appointment.

The opening is Saturday the 27th of September, 6-10 pm.
     The following Saturday, Oct. 4th, there will be a poetry reading featuring
     Jeff Clark and Cedar Sigo. I think it starts at eight pm.
The following Saturday, Oct. 11th, there will be noise-rock featuring
Sort of Invisible and TBA.
     The following Saturday, Oct. 18th is the last weekend of the show
     and you can just go and mellow out.

Any questions, just ask. Gallery info below:

I am working on a paper and had a couple of questions:

I have heard that Derrida's lecture on the end of the book, which he gave at
SUNY Albany, was published. Does anyone know the title and publsiher? Also,
I was searching and found some responses to this lecture. Does the list have
any suggestions for good responses to this lecture?

Now I got today the update from Catherine Daly on how many of the poets of the 40s
turned Catholic.  That's fascinating, and something I didn't know about.  I wonder
if any of them turned Lutheran!

I goofed up something else -- I think it's not Garfield who was shot by the
anarchist -- but rather McKinley, about whom I know nothing else except that he has
a mountain named after him, if that is indeed his mountain.  Garfield was shot by a
man who wanted a job, but didn't get it, one month into his term.  Curiously, and on
a side note, Garfield could write Greek and Latin with two different hands
simultaneously.  Some kind of split brain that he had that allowed him to do this as
a party trick.  That should be enough to make one president, I think.

interesting considering the theologian Stanley Hauerwas has argued that
Christianity, particularly embodied in the idea of the church as
community, is a pacifist religion.  from what I understand, this was not
the position of major theologians during the WWII, including Niebuhr. rmc

Hauerwas began as a Methodist, but has been powerfully influenced by the
Mennonites.  Mennonites are pacifists.  They are also anarchists, to an
extent, in that they think that all government is necessarily evil and the
work of the devil.  The Pennsylvania Dutch are Mennonites, for instance.
They sprang up in the aftermath of Luther's split with the Catholics.  The
details are amazingly complex, but the brief of it is that Luther felt that
war was necessary and they wanted to turn the other cheek.  Luther argued
that if you turn your other cheek the devil will only rip it off.  He thought
the turn your other cheek idea was only meant for other Christians, and he
argued that there weren't any, or that a true Christian is impossibly rare.
He also felt that capital punishment and police, and government was
necessary.  The left-wing of the Reformation split with him on these issues.
Niebuhr was a Lutheran theologian of the fifties who hated both communism and
capitalism, but preferred capitalism because it functioned, and he was in
favor of WWII.  There is a long tradition of the Just War theory in
Lutheranism that goes back to Aquinas and from there to Augustine.

Luther was against the Crusades, and would probably have been against the
attack in Iraq.  (I'm not so sure.)

In the briefest terms, Just War theory sets out these propositions:

1.  The requirement that war be a last resort to be used only after all other
means have been exhausted.

2.  The requirement that war be clearly an act of defense against unjust
demands backed by the threat of force.

3.  The requirement that war be openly and legally declared by properly
constituted government.

4.  The requirement that there be a reasonable prospect for victory.  [Luther
didn't want everybody to die for a just cause that was nevertheless endless
and would widow his nation.]

5.  The requirement that the means be appropriate to the ends.  (No nukes.)

6.  The requirement that a war be waged in such a way as to distinguish
between combatants and noncombatants.  (Luther was against the kind of total
war, obliteration bombing, that characterized the Vietnam war, for instance.)

7.  The requirement that the victorious nation not require the utter
humiliation of the vanquished.

Hauerwas, presumably, would never find these conditions, or would not find
even these conditions to be acceptable.  Niebuhr did find these conditions
not only in the war against Hitler, but also in the Cold War.  He hated the
conditions of the Soviet bloc, and felt we should do everything in our power
to free their people from the conditions imposed by Stalin.  I found these 7
conditions in a pamphlet entitled Conscience, War and the Selective Objector,
published by the Lutheran church during the Vietnam War.  I think the 7
conditions are soundly stated, but their interpretation is never-ending.

<snip>
When you use a word, a visual image associated with the word you use will
tend to be associated with it, and will influence any physical gesture you
make.
<snip>

The suggestion is that _language_ influences how space and motion are
conceived of, which in turn influences gesture.

<snip>
I don't get what the psychologist is saying that shouldn't be obvious to
everyone.
<snip>

If you start from the hypothesis that spatial cognition precedes the
development of spatial language, what precisely isn't obvious is that such
apparent language-specific correlations should occur. 25 words for snow,
and all that. These particular findings aren't earth shattering only because
they add to earlier research and if they are reliable they are interesting,
though they may not have been well described.

<snip>
...even if  Japanese and Turkish have no verb "to swing" the languages have
a commonplace way to express the motion--as commonplace as the everyday need
to do so...
<snip>

The argument isn't about inexpressibility but about ease and efficiency and
thus about relative latency.

Since Kita is Japanese and one of his collaborators, Asli Özyürek, is
Turkish, the argument that *to swing* cannot _easily_ be expressed may have
some force.

<snip>
We don't normally  accompany speech with full-fledged mime.
<snip>

Nor here. The gestures aren't solicited but are observed during the
experiment as and when they occur.

<snip>
no one has ever been able to demonstrate a consistent connection between
hand gestures (other than sign languages) and words in any language.
<snip>

Nor is that suggested here. What is being hypothesised, tendentiously,
is that parallel conceptions of space and motion within the language and
manifested in any accompanying gestures cued by the process of speaking may
account for any correlation.

I say 'tendentiously' because it's not obvious to me how one might reach a
principled distinction between the mimetic (eg: twisting), the conventional
(eg: the head gesture of affirmation used by Tamil speakers) and something
that truly represented a different conception of space and motion. If Hausa
(unlike English) conceives of *in front* as always ahead of the speaker,
then the different gestures used by English and Hausa speakers will
presumably reflect that, but perhaps only in a rather banal way.

Eskimos don't in fact have 25 words for snow (the number ascribed differs=20
in different sources) even if we think they should. That's just=20
anthropological folklore. They have one word, which they modify in the=20
manner of agglutinative languages.

You're making a huge assumtion here about what's experienced as easy in=20
other languages.

Anyone who's ever done translations knows that there are concepts expressed=

that ease or latency isn't observably different, except that translators=20

Vanilla Primitive -- Lawrence Ytzhak Braithwaite
http://www.sleepybrain.net/vanilla.html
*****************************

Hello unto you,

SLEEPY BRAIN MAGAZINE is proud as punch to present another exclusive from
Lawrence Ytzhak Braithwaite (aka Lord Patch; aka The Rude Duke), acclaimed
author and spoken-word performer and perhaps the finest Canadian prose
writer alive. Find it here: http://www.sleepybrain.net/vanilla.html

The piece is "Vanilla Primitive" and it's another example of Braithwaite's
unique "dub literature": cut-and-paste prose drenched in feedback and echo.
Take the linguistic jouissance and near-future edginess of Anthony Burgess
and Jack Womack, then splice that gene with hip hop verse and rhythm and
you'll have something approximating Braithwaite's style. Add a liberal dose
of emotion; strength through adversity; indomitable, instinctual animal
spirit - and you're ready to take this baby to the streets.

EXCERPT FROM VANILLA PRIMITIVE: http://www.sleepybrain.net/vanilla.html

"A great code was taught to me once when I was sleeping from slamming a bolt
into my forehead to stop the shouting all outside my room. Sometimes it
would be cool to cut the top part of my skull open and remove my brain to
wash the mess/wadein the gutter primitive/vikings stiped bare/by the Ummah
on the night of their visions/it1d be all grey like smog infested
snot/follow Ghost to full capacity/focus/focus/life and story
stumble/literary DMC/throwing DJ on tables and scratching them/cuttin into
them/chop them up/let cross fade this/and it goes like when?/intellectual
property/I will give you literary attacks/you jackin philosophy/X-rays
to an
optical creed/I aight."

As Gail Scott wrote in an essay of New Narrative (Matrix 62): "Lawrence
Ytzhak Braithwaite's beautiful dangerous novels make him one of the
outstanding Canadian prose writers alive, and only the Americans seem to
know it."

Braithwaite loves and lives to Dub his prose like Lee "Scratch" Perry (who
he shares physical height with = 5'4) and King Tubby worked with music and
voice. His bunker/lab is in the Fernwood district of Victoria British
Columbia, Canada.

Peace,

This was written to music that I was given to work with but when the dj
heard the recite he said no way "it's too political' so no music. It's
for Anthany Dawson.


I hope is all groovey with you and yours

M.A.D.ness (Strike the Dawn let us holla another Anthem)
Lyrics LY Braithwaite (aka Lord Patch)



Strike the Dawn and let us holla another Anthem
This goes out to Dawson what was Anthany
Twisten melanins with Lessons

...and you know the popo are our friends and they never tell lies.
Actually/what they will probably do is use their medical foos to
hold you/inna hospital/do harm to you and fucc up your medical records/
defocus them in their favour.
Soooo/basically you never really had asthma/you're just a junkie/you
are violent/schizo in need of medication/more a danger to others than to
yourself -- or just downright crazy = “so take um off the planet...”


You see when you get a society to the point inwhich all of North America
is at now then all the system is the system and only works off of the
signifiers which they have embedded in the structure of society to
maintain the order. But they actually no longer serve any purpose for
the protection,
health care or advancement of the people.
They are about the system. We must start to realize this twisted
A.I.D.S. metaphor = negative is positive and postive is negative.
Therefore war is peace and peace is war.
Love is hate and hate is love. Abuse is relationships and relations are
abusive -- abuse is care and to care is to abuse. Or do we define the
redefinitions and battle the madness and regain our M.A.D. ness =
Mathematics of the African Diaspora.

My Math Me regained

Duking it out with Ellington
Eurasian Macluhan
Twistin my melanin

You misread my poking fun. I was against folk wisdom, the blindingly
obvious, 'anthropological folklore' and appeals to general authority such as
'Anyone who's ever done translations knows...', which you make later on.

There is a tension, not irreconcilable, between the propositions *thought
(or experience) determines language* and *language determines thought (or
experience)*. Kita's findings, whatever their value, position themselves on
an axis along which Sapir, Whorf, Chomsky and Lakoff are also to be found.

<snip>
The argument isn't about inexpressibility but about ease and efficiency and
thus about relative latency. [CW]

You're making a huge assumtion here about what's experienced as easy in
other languages. [MW]
<snip>

No. Since both you and Bob Grumman seemed to have misread the BBC's
admittedly poor report, I'd hoped to clarify what Kita (a native speaker of
Japanese, unlike either of us) seems to be claiming: that Japanese, like
Turkish but unlike English, uses fewer (perhaps no) verbs combining
manner and trajectory, such as 'swing' and 'roll'; that this linguistic
split is associated with (perhaps causes) the sequential processing of two
separate concepts by Turkish and Japanese speakers, and that seriality
accounts for the choice of single concept gestures (such as for direction
only) during speech. There _are_ assumptions here, some of them
questionable, but they are Kita's rather than mine.

<snip>
ease or latency isn't observably different, except that translators get to
pull their hair out
<snip>

That's an interesting use of 'except'.

Latency can be measured, bald translators notwithstanding. An earlier paper
by Kita deals with how pointing out directions interacts with left hand
taboo among (I'm guessing here: I don't think it's published yet) Twi
speakers in Ghana. Again latency seems to be implicated and could, in
principle, be measured; though I don't know whether it was.

We tend to assume that we think (consciously) first and then act. Measuring
latency (I'm thinking here of recent neurological work) suggests that this
may not be the case. So the differences need not be gross enough to be
ordinarily observable in the sense you seem to mean.

You're absolutely right, Jamie, I wouldn't disagree. Was just trying to
point out that the poems of Ron Silliman and Billy Collins have very little
in common, and that this disparity is probably (or should be) apparent to
most readers, not much more than that except to say I think Silliman's work
is better. Sometimes I'm in the mood for lasagna and ice cream too. But not
mango, that's disgusting...

Sorry for rthe misread. My own generalization was for lack of examples (or
the time to dredge them up) near to hand.

I of course haven't read the article, but it seems obvious that this is a
case of learned (and consciously taught) selective inhibitions to gesture.

It's also about mimetic gesture which closely approaches sign language--I
point in a particular direction to convey what direction one should take.
This, it seems to me, is very different from most gesture accompanying speech.

The article as reported is about gross observation--a swinging hand motion
when speaking of a swinging object.

There are possibilities other than "*thought (or experience) determines
language* and *language determines thought (or
experience)" or that we think consciously then act or otherwise.  How about
it's sometimes the one, sometimes the other, and sometimes simultaneous?
Gesture likewise would divide along these lines.

I'm a New Yorker--I move my hands a lot when I talk. I also observe the
gestures of others. Altho there are mimetic elements, conscious or not,
much of the gesturing is unconscious and usually unrelated to the subject
of the accompanying speech, tho it's often related to its degree of
emotional intensity, or rather to the emotional intensity behind the
speech. It also differs depending upon the cultural background of the
speaker, even when there's no denotative meaning to the gestures. Turn off
the sound in a Woody Allen movie and we still know that Woody's upset, but
not about what. Turn off the sound in a Swedish film and the gestures are
equally opaque as to denotation and equally eloquent as to emotion, tho in
each case different, despite areas of overlap.

Much gesture seems to be learned as language is learned, but much of it
seems not to relate to the language that it often accompanies. Or so it
seems to me.

When I was in clinical practice gesture, which we loosly call "body
language" despite its lack of syntax, was important evidence as to the
internal state of those I worked with. It often expressed emotionally the
opposite of the patient's words.

Interactive Audio on the Web:
http://trace.ntu.ac.uk/Review/index.cfm?article=80

This essay looks at a few works that have been created over the last few
years, discusses elements such as interface, composition, instrumentality,
and music, and then provides lots of great links to work that highlights
interactive audio; there's also links to offline interactive audio projects,
and links to news sources about the art.

Works discussed:
Electrica by Gundula Markeffsky, Peter Huehlfriedel, and Leonard Schaumann
(Germany)
Intercontinental Spontaneous Jam Session by Pall Thayer (Iceland)
Pianographique by Jean-Luc Lamarque (France)
Music Generator by James Tindall (Britain)
Nio by yours truly (Canada)
Network Auralization for Gnutella (NAG) by Jason Freeman (USA)

"It is important to point out that the most notable works on the web in
interactive audio are done by individuals or small groups of artists
producing their own work. We don't see music companies doing the outstanding
work. This is not often so in other areas, such as computer games.  Part of
the reason why interactive audio is dominated by individuals is because of
the artistic fusion it demands in various realms. We see a creative
synthesis of audio, visuals, animation, interface design, and programming.
Interactive audio is about changing music and hypermedia, not marketing the
same old stuff repackaged for the web."

Thanks for the clarification; I read this and concluded two things:
  1.. Kita has no idea what the hell he's/she's talking about. =20
  2.. Some folks spend far too much time pondering pure nonsense.
I'm of the opinion that if a human action can occur, then someone, =
somewhere in "a" language has recorded it in all its majesty.  That Kita =
fails to see that motion/manner element in his/her native Japanese is =
his/her shortcoming, not a failing in the language, nor a difference in =
the races/nationalities.=20
Alex=20
P.S. fun poem, though a bit tedious in its redundancy.  Perhaps it reads =
better in its native Turkish.=20

Harry, I wish I knew...I'd use it here! I can say as an aside =
that--whether or not these fall into such a poetics category for you--my =
literature students here in Oman had a real hard time with *The Arab =
Apocalypse* by Etel Adnan and especially *Hovercraft* by K. Silem =
Mohammed. Any discussions of poetics that I thought could contribute to =
their appreciation of these particular works they just found pointless, =
which I'm taking as a challenge to make it relevant to them. This =
semester I've dropped *Hovercraft* and added Adnan's *Sitt Marie Rose* =
and Jalal Toufic's *Love Dies, or Undying Love*. Anyway, how direct of a =
relationship are you looking for? Perhaps you can contact the English =
departments at universities in the Gaza Strip or the West Bank. You can =
find an extensive list at Palestine-Net: Education & Research in =
Palestine at http://www.palestine-net.com/education/index.html. Maybe =
someone there has been thinking similar things. Best of luck. NICK

Murat:

<snip>
I do speak Turkish. The Turkish word for the verb "to swing" is "sallanmak."
<snip>

Thanks. That's helpful. I don't, in any case, regard *trajectory* and
*manner* as reliably stable categories: 'he swung his arm' is a very
different proposition from 'he hit out angrily' .

BTW, I'd be interested to know how coextensive Turkish *'swing' and English
'swing' are in practice. I presume they don't entirely overlap. Or Turkish
*'roll' and English 'roll', come to that.

<snip>
Being agglutinative profoundly affects the way Turkish (and Turkish poetry)
perceive things; but this quality has little to do with Kita's argument.
<snip>

Well, it _may_ have, given that Japanese and Turkish are both strongly
agglutinative. Would speakers of Finnish or Kiswahili show a similar bias?
Would, say, German speakers be less likely to produce an arcing gesture than
English speakers but more likely than Japanese speakers?

Assuming Kita's findings to be trustworthy, a big enough if in itself, I can
think of several _possible_ explanations besides the one advanced and many
variables within the experiment itself that could affect what was observed.

Mark:

<snip>
it seems obvious that this is a case of learned (and consciously taught)
selective inhibitions to gesture.
<snip>

Very likely. However, the paper's focus appears to be on why some gestures
are still used _despite_ the taboo. Hence my point about latency.

Gestures specifically giving direction are, as you say, different (but
perhaps not _absolutely_ different) from the unconscious or semi-conscious
gestures used during speech. What I don't know is whether Kita looks at
those accompanying discussions of direction; at specific, conscious gestures
such as pointing, or at both.

He seems to be interested, incidentally, in much of the gesture spectrum:
pointing, mimetic gesture, formal signing, coordination, inhibition,
split-brain patients, spatial schemas... Which may reflect investigative
breadth. Or ill discipline, of course.

<snip>
the differences need not be gross enough to be ordinarily observable in the
sense you seem to mean. [CW]

The article as reported is about gross observation--a swinging hand motion
when speaking of a swinging object. [MW]
<snip>

I may have misled you here: the bit that escapes ordinary observation would
be the mental dithering between a *manner* gesture and a gesture conveying
*trajectory*. However, as I note in my response to Murat Nemet-Nejat, I have
my doubts about whether these are stable categories in the first place.

And it would be useful to know, given Kita's thesis, whether Japanese and
Turkish speakers accompanied a *trajectory* verb with a gesture indicating
*manner* and/or vice versa.

<snip>
There is a tension, not irreconcilable, between the propositions *thought
(or experience) determines language* and *language determines thought (or
experience)*. [CW]

There are possibilities other than "*thought (or experience) determines
language* and *language determines thought (or experience)" or that we think
consciously then act or otherwise.  How about it's sometimes the one,
sometimes the other, and sometimes simultaneous? Gesture likewise would
divide along these lines. [MW]
<snip>

Agreed. That's very much the sort of thing I had in mind.

I suggest we DO normally accompany speech with
gestures or near-gestures that go with what we say.

I stand by what I said.

His experiment told me that language influences
gesture in the way I described (via its associated
visual--and, I should have said--motor images.

Everyone develops a language his needs and likings
require?  I don't see how that's relevant to what I
said.  With that, I'm dropping out (probably) because
I zapped the description of the experiment and can't
remember it enough for further participation.

Hi. At 8 pm tonight the Perpetual Motion Roadshow arrives from
successful gigs in Toronto, Ottawa, and Montreal. And tomorrow it moves
on to Cleveland, then Cincinnatti, and Chicago. The show is an hour or
so, it's free, it's in a great space (Bluestockings Bookstore, an
activist bookstore that you should know if you don't already), there
will be readings, music, videos, laffs, and a camera crew from Toronto
trailing the performers. I hope you can make it. For more info look at
www.nomediakings.net. Listen to the payphone tour diaries.

Bluestockings, 172 Allen St, New York, 8 pm, Sat. Sept. 20.

Voila.

his case for reparations."

In Turkish the word "swing" is more related to the word "wave" in English. It
does not have an aggressive trajectory or connotation of a "punch." The swing
that Turkish has is near to the swing that jazz has: swinging as a movement
in space, in time (the lilt, cadence they create).

Interestingly, both English and Turkish derive the word "swing" (what one has
in the garden) from the the same verb.

Thanks very much for this, Nick.  I also was interested by Harry's
question and backchanneled him at the time.  My own interest derives
from study of
the use of poetry within nationalist struggles, specifically in Ireland
and Kosovo, though the mention of the latter may raise questions about
nationalism at the end of the twentieth century.
The Irish tradition, in terms of poetry and nationalist struggle, from
Patrick Pearse at the beginning of the twentieth century right up and
past Bobby Sands, in the 1980s, has been strongly romantic. I'm removed
from Ireland now, but I have a strong hunch that graffiti, banners,
urban/protest art
may offer a starker, less bloody poetry.  Looking at armed struggles
which are informed by ideologies other than nationalism would also be
productive, as the example of Communism/Socialism shows.  I know Harry
intended his question to be provocative: and it is, but not in a way
worth dismissing.  It's incredibly rich and I'm sorry to be so
ham-fisted in my approach here. I'd love to hear more from those of you
in a position to address it.

Harry, I wish I knew...I'd use it here! I can say as an aside
that--whether or not these fall into such a poetics category for you--my
literature students here in Oman had a real hard time with *The Arab
Apocalypse* by Etel Adnan and especially *Hovercraft* by K. Silem
Mohammed. Any discussions of poetics that I thought could contribute to
their appreciation of these particular works they just found pointless,
which I'm taking as a challenge to make it relevant to them. This
semester I've dropped *Hovercraft* and added Adnan's *Sitt Marie Rose*
and Jalal Toufic's *Love Dies, or Undying Love*. Anyway, how direct of a
relationship are you looking for? Perhaps you can contact the English
departments at universities in the Gaza Strip or the West Bank. You can
find an extensive list at Palestine-Net: Education & Research in
Palestine at http://www.palestine-net.com/education/index.html. Maybe
someone there has been thinking similar things. Best of luck. NICK

Osama Bin Laden's poetry has been translated into Dutch.  Has anyone
translated it into English?  I've read that he's talented.  Could anybody
comment on this talent or provide a translation of a poem by Bin Laden?

CRISS CROSS
Confluence and Influence in 20th Century African American Music,
Visual Art and Literature

Three Day International Conference
June 18th =F1 20th, 2004

School of American & Canadian Studies,
University of Nottingham


CALL FOR PAPERS


Music is habitually cited as the core expressive form in African
American culture, yet the question of what this has meant for both
music and other art forms has rarely been addressed in detail.
=46ocusing on the history of JAZZ and BLUES, our project will endeavour
to explicate this situation. The central question we intend to
confront is: what has been the nature and extent of the relationship
between black music and other African American art forms,
particularly PAINTING, POETRY, FICTION and FILM?

=46ollowing the success of our one-day =EBJazzthetics=ED colloquium in May
2003, we are now planning a three-day conference in June 2004.

Guest speakers will include Robin D.G. Kelley, John F. Szwed and
Robert Farris Thompson.

Papers are invited on any aspect of the relationship between music
and other facets of 20th century African American culture.

Please send abstracts (c.500 words) and a brief CV to  =13 HYPERLINK
mailto:graham.taylor@nottingham.ac.uk
=01=14graham.taylor@nottingham.ac.uk=15  [please write =EBConference
proposal=ED in the email subject field]. Or write to Dr. Graham Taylor,
School of American & Canadian Studies, University of Nottingham,
University Park, Nottingham NG7 2RD, United Kingdom.

Closing date for proposals: 15th December 2003.

We hope to respond to proposals by mid-January.

We plan to publish a selection of the conference papers.


To see more about the Criss Cross project, including paintings and
music by BILL DIXON, poems by MICHAEL S.  HARPER and synopses of the
papers presented at the =EBJazzthetics=ED colloquium, please visit our

The new wave


The lovers were making commas outside of the garden. One whispered to the
other: "I promise to become an event of some magnitude." The other
whispered: "I vow to undergo a radical transformation." As if without their
lamps on, they are sheepish and heretofore and madly.



Lost at sea


We live in the immediate neighborhood of our homes and immediately again in
a neighborhood of lamplight and we embody an immediate texture of same and
long for it daily though we allow for a fine architecture to overwhelm us or
for a long distance wave to find us. We've become animals again with our
senses tuned to the cumulous. We've honed our navigational tendencies the
way most ships and aeroplanes do regarding their needs and rights for water
and air. And regarding this situation of land and rain, what's lovely in a
thought is forcing an epiphany or inventing a temporary iota of joy. We are
fully blown and operational, broadcasting at sea. Thank you for the report
of your transmission and for your clandestine operations. Thank you for your
tendencies, they will be more than likely in the invent of a landing or in
the hopes that we may fall.

Her time on the train turns into a book about the history of trains, leaning
into books about Lake Superior and the St. Lawrence Seaway. Above this, a

John, whose real name is Paul, gives Elinor lingerie. She puts it on in a
different room. She does not come back new. "I have a fury," she says.


Describe this: a long corridor, maroon seats, the river and its bend, a
slash of light. What takes the place of something else?


Elinor dreamed with a strange power of realism. She felt like a man was
leaning over her, saying, "I don't think you understand the ramifications."
"But I've been preparing for years," she says out loud in real life and
wakes with a start.

EXILE AND BETRAYAL

I have migrated westward
To a land where flows the Nile.
Of Khartoum I love the character,
But I was not permitted to reside.
So then I travelled eastward
Where there are men of radiant brows.
Kabul holds its head up high
Despite the hardship and the danger.
Kabul, with a smiling face,
Offers all-comers shelter and help.

"Why, father, have they sent
These missiles, thick as rain,
Showing mercy neither to a child
Nor to a man shattered by old age?
Father, what has happened
So your likenesses are on placards?
Is your redeeming of an ancient house
A crime that cannot be forgiven?"

"It is a world of criminality, my son
Where children are, like cattle, slaughtered.
Zion is murdering my brothers
And the Arabs hold a congress!
They are America's henchmen,
Blinded and devoid of vision.

This, by your Lord, is a major brand
Of shame to be recorded,
A treachery being pieced together-
Is our defence to come from traitors
I swear by God the great
That I shall fight the infidel!"

Poetry and Jihad: Poem Attributed to Osama Bin Laden
Sep 29, 2002
Source: INQ7.net

Editors Note: This article is published here in full context keeping
with our editorial policy of providing uncensored material. It has
been selected for publication only on the basis of the content
attributed to Osama bin Laden and not on the literary value of the
article itself.

The quality of discourse, as we say in academia, on the war on
terrorism has been quite diverse, ranging from polemical to
jingoistic. But a recent essay by David Rohde in The New York Times
offers yet another window into the al-Qaida phenomenon -- a literary
analysis.

Last October when US military forces rained bombs on Kabul in
retaliation to Sept. 11, al-Qaida warriors were on the run. When the
smoke cleared, a most unusual "find" turned up in one of the
abandoned buildings on Kabul. It was a three-page printed poem
titled, "The Travail of a Child Who Has Left the Land of the Holy
Shrines." Sounds like the title of a medieval morality play. Rohde
characterizes the poem as "a tale of betrayal, exile and siege, cast
as a mournful conversation between father and son."

It would have escaped notice by the invading forces except for one
thing. The poem was written by two authors: "the poet Dr. Abdar-
Rahman al-Ashmawi and Sheik Osama bin Laden."

The New York Times enlisted three Arabic literature experts to
analyze the poem and they concluded that Bin Laden most likely wrote
the last half of the verses, probably after the US bombardment of
Kabul in October.

These verses allude to Bin Laden's migration westward from Saudi
Arabia presumably to a "land where flows the Nile" (obviously Sudan)
and further eastward (Afghanistan). Khartoum and Kabul are mentioned
in the poem. The poem in the ruins, Rohde notes, "appears to be
another example of Mr. Bin Laden trying to use poetry, a revered art
form in the Muslim world, to further his cause and burnish his image
as a pan-Islamic warrior, savior and muse."

Apparently in February 2001, during the wedding of one of his sons in
Afghanistan, Bin Laden read a poem celebrating the Islamic attack on
the US destroyer Cole in October 2000, in which several American
sailors were killed. Then again in November 2001 following the Sept.
11 disaster, Bin Laden was put on air by al-Jezeera hailing the
attack on the World Trade Center.

One of the literary experts who reviewed the poem, Prof. Issa
Boullata of McGill University in Montreal, has this insight on Bin
Laden: "He wants to show he is a leader and he knows the culture, and
he is using the medium which the traditional society accepts."
Boullata and the other experts note that it was written in classical
Arabic used in the Koran, which carries the weight of religious
authority and popular appeal. "Even those who are not literate
people, who cannot read, when this kind of Arabic is read to them
they understand it....because they recite the Koran every day."

Poetry obviously is a common form of expression in the Islamic world
even by those engaged in jihad (loosely translated as "holy war").
Rohde reports that more than a dozen handwritten poems in Arabic,
Urdu and Pashto were found abandoned in safehouses, training camps
and trenches in Afghanistan after the US offensive. One of the Arabic
poems has a line that translates to, "The cross has been smashed with
the Koran's pick axe." Another, obviously referring to the attacks on
the World Trade twin towers, runs like this: "Their fingers turned,
steering a plane towards the citadels -- the refuge of crows." Others
had similar political and emotional themes. The place was bursting
with poetry.

For lack of space, I will reproduce only portions of the second half
of the "exile and betrayal" poem, believed to have been written by
Osama bin Laden:

I have migrated westward
To a land where flows the Nile.
Of Khartoum I love the character,
But I was not permitted to reside.
So then I traveled eastward
Where there are men of radiant brows.
Kabul holds its head up high
Despite the hardship and the danger.
Kabul, with a smiling face,
Offers all-comers shelter and help.

"Why, father, have they sent
These missiles, thick as rain,
Showing mercy neither to a child
Nor to a man shattered by old age?
Father, what has happened
So your likenesses are on placards?
Is your redeeming of an ancient house
A crime that cannot be forgiven?"

"It is a world of criminality, my son
Where children are, like cattle, slaughtered.
Zion is murdering my brothers
And the Arabs hold a congress!
They are America's henchmen,
Blinded and devoid of vision.

This, by your Lord, is a major brand
Of shame to be recorded,
A treachery being pieced together-
Is our defense to come from traitors
I swear by God the great
That I shall fight the infidel!"

Another of the literary experts, Professor Cachia, concludes that the
poem is "purely favoring classical tradition, not anything modern."
Osama bin Laden, it will be recalled, bewailed the demise of the
caliphate, the era of Muslim glory after Muhammad's death in the 7th
century. He wants to recreate it.

History has seen revolutionaries come and go. And many were poets. It
would seem that poetry is part of their apocalyptic or romantic
vision, their redemption.

Worm Wears A 'Patch' For Disguise

http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A38195-2003Sep20.html

By Mike Musgrove
Sunday, September 21, 2003; Page F07


The latest virus to hit the Web poses as a security update from Microsoft
and takes advantage of a two-year-old weakness in Internet Explorer.

Disguised as an official e-mail from Microsoft, the file comes attached to a
note asking the recipient to install a "September 2003, cumulative patch" to
protect against vulnerabilities in Microsoft's Internet Explorer Web browser
and Outlook and Outlook Express e-mail programs.

If installed, the program, known as Swen or Gibe.F, attempts to disable
firewall and antivirus software, gather password information and replicate
itself via e-mail, as well as the Kazaa peer-to-peer network and Internet
Relay Chat instant-messaging.

Internet security firms are reporting a wide distribution of the worm
online; McAfee Security rated the malicious program a "medium" risk to home
users and a "low" risk to corporate users, who are more likely to have
updated security software.

The virus-laden e-mail looks like an authentic missive from the Redmond,
Wash., software developer (aside from a few grammatical errors), but a
spokeswoman for Microsoft said this week that it doesn't send security
updates in e-mail. They're all distributed through Microsoft's Web site
(windowsupdate.microsoft.com).

The Swen virus could affect users running Windows 95, Windows 98, Windows
Me, Windows NT, Windows 2000 and Windows XP. It does not affect other
operating systems. -- Mike Musgrove

Murat:

<snip>
In Turkish the word "swing" is more related to the word "wave" in English.
It does not have an aggressive trajectory or connotation of a "punch." The
swing that Turkish has is near to the swing that jazz has: swinging as a
movement in space, in time (the lilt, cadence they create).
<snip>

It sounds as though there may not be much conflict after all between what
you know as a native speaker and what Kita seems to be claiming.

Without an amplifying context any sense of trajectory is vestigial in
English words like 'ripple' or 'rhythm', if it exists at all. However,
English 'swing' can be used very easily to convey oscillation or pulse;  or
to convey trajectory only ('he took a swing at me'), or to convey various
mixtures of the two: 'a swing to the Democrats', 'he swung out into the
road' or whatever. If I read you correctly, you're tending to confirm that
Turkish *'swing' has less of that sense of trajectory.

English also has phrases in which one sense of movement seems to be
substituted for another: 'going full tilt', 'going for a spin', for example.
On the other hand, it lacks an easy way of describing, say, the upward and
forwards passage of a bullet towards an unsuspecting duck.

<snip>
Interestingly, both English and Turkish derive the word "swing" (what one
has in the garden) from the same verb.
<snip>

Now that I think of it, I'd always associated swings with the Moghuls.

Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

The best overall biography of Luther that I've come across is Roland Bainton's Here
I Stand: A Life of Martin Luther.  It's not at all a hagiography.  It's balanced.
Bainton was Episcopalian, I believe, but taught at Yale Divinity School.  The book
has great woodcut illustrations mostly from Albrecht Durer, who was a close friend
of Luther's, and also some by Holbein, and others.  Best of all it is a quick but
deep read.

You mentioned the part where Luther was against the peasants' war.  He was.  There
was a man named Thomas Muntzner (there are umlauts over the u) who was somewhat like
Bakunin before the letter.  He wanted to demolish civilization -- whack all of its
idols and images and churches, and destroy the upper classes, and was laying waste
to the countryside.  The nobles were very upset because it was destroying the
quality of life, and also challenging their authority.  At this time Germany was not
unified but was a series of small fiefdoms.  Luther argued that the nobles had to
get together and stop the peasants.  They did, but because many of them were a
little troubled by killing people Luther upped the rhetoric.  Then they went too
far, and Luther thought they should cool it.  He tried to slow the vengeance.
Muntzner, curiously contemporary, unfurled a rainbow banner when he went into
battle.  He said that he wanted to slaughter the unholy and godless and especially
those who thought of themselves as the elect and the educated.  Some of the stuff he
says sounds like Pol Pot in Kampuchea.  He wants to completely level the upper
classes so that nobody knew more than a simple farmer.

Luther was shocked.  He was afterall an academic, and he believed that learning was
very difficult, and needed protection.  At any rate he arranged a truce, and
Muntzner was beheaded during the peace negotiations.

Luther was not in on that choice, but he did think that Muntzner had become the
devil (he actually thought the Pope was the devil, too).

He wanted a middle way between hierarchy and levelling.  He also thought it was ok
to not believe in God, as long as you didn't go around proselytizing.

As far as Just War tradition goes, the seven principles that I laid out in the
previous post on Just War are pretty much all that I know at least that can be
quickly summarized.  Each point has reams of interpretation, and there are
contemporary scholars and theologians who've devoted their lives to their
recuperation.  Just look up Just War in Amazon.com and you'll get probably a dozen
books or so (I haven't looked).

The tradition is deep and venerated, and is started by Augustine.

By "left-wing" I mean those who don't believe in hierarchy, and I am contrasting it
with "right-wing" in which I am implicitly placing the Catholics in Luther's day,
with their powerful belief in hierarchy.  The left-wing (Muntzner would be an
extreme example) wanted to sweep away all hierarchy.

Luther wanted to leave government in place, but make it accessible to the
commoners.  He wanted to leave the church in place, but also make it accessible to
the commoners.  For this reason he translated the Bible into German, and insisted
that German be used in the churches.  Up until then it had only been Latin that only
the elite understood.  The rest had to depend on pictures.

Luther also left the arts in place, and said that they should be left to artistic
geniuses to deal with as they wished.  He was not theocentric to the degree that the
Calvinists were  (Puritans who came on the Mayflower were Calvinists, for
instance).  He would not have branded A's on the heads of adulterers.  Lutherans
would not attack Mapplethorpe or others for their art.  Art is a separate area like
science.  Where scientists are right (as they are on the topic of evolution)
Lutherans back off (there are some who don't, but they are supposed to according to
Luther).

Here's some other good points for Luther:

1.  he was against hunting for sport (he wept when he say a bear being slaughtered
purely for the fun of it)

2.  He said that no one should be intimidated into belief

3.  Heretics should not be burned, but should be answered with books

4.  Faith is a gift from God, by no act of will can it be induced

5.  He felt that women should have equal rights within marriage

6.  Schoolteaching and writing were arduous activities favored by God and that there
was to be TOTAL freedom of inquiry into EVERY and ANY topic

7.  Good works are a trap that make those pretending to be humble into prideful
sinners

8.  Church and state always have to be separate, as if they are allied, one begins
to dominate

9.  Anyone who doesn't enjoy poetry and music is not worthy to be considered human
(he was arguing this against the iconoclasts); music and art are appropriate
expressions and need not be theocentric

10.  Only Christ is a saint, and everyone else's noblest act, is the act of a
sinner.

WORST THING ABOUT LUTHER:

1.  He got really mad at the Jews at one point in his life and wanted them to be
separated, but not killed, and put on a segregated island.  He was afraid that they
could never be converted and were in fact so clever that they would convert
Christians.  He admired their industry, their intelligence, and their bravery, but
feared their intellects would make mincemeat of Christianity if permitted.

At any rate, I think that in a century when there are so many fundamentalist nuts
wreaking havoc on civilization -- from Bush's right-wing conspirators to Bin Laden's
crazy killers, to the Ayatollahs of Iran, and the nutcases that continue to rule
communist podunks, Luther provides a sensible middle way that leaves government and
due process in place, and doesn't ask that we become saints 24/7.  Luther argues
that anybody who tries to be a saint becomes a devil in the process.  I think his
ideas would cripple political correctness, for instance, of which I am duly sick in
all its forms.

Hi All:

Here's a list of my recent blog entries. The only one that's directly
literary is "Lost & Found" - about the consequence of the sidewalk finding
of a copy of  New Directions 17 from 1957 with a 47 page feature on the then
"Lost & Found" poems of William Carlos Williams.  The rest of the entries
are, well, literary, however that may be conjured.

Today:

A sometimes frustrating sometimes brilliant little book called *How the
Universe Got Its Spots: A Diary of a Finite Time in a Finite Space* by
physicist Janna Levin. Poets aren't the only ones who worry about isolation
and obsolescence:

     "I admit I'm afraid sometimes that no one is listening. Many of our
scientific publications, sometimes too formal or too obscure, are read only
by a handful of people. I'm also guilty of a self-imposed separation. I know
I've locked you out of my scientific life and it's where I spend most of my
time. I know you don't want to be lectured with disciplined lessons on
science. But I think you would want a sketch of the cosmos and our place in
it. Do you want to know what I know? You're my last hope. I'm writing to you
because I know you're curious but afraid to ask."

Today: Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass (by himself); Paul
Gilroy's The Black Atlantic (reminds me of how ornate and hesitant
academic writing can be even with a very fluid swelling idea); Fulcrum
(Number One 2002--enjoyed Paul Muldoon's essay on Ted Hughes/Sylvia
Plath/Marianne Moore, and Marjorie Perloff's piece on Jasper

Randolph Healy's equanimous balmy acerbic comments on the Irish poetry

Is this the scrappy bike you had in Maine 2 years ago? What a trooper!

I am, ashamedly, reading a book about conversations with Leonard
Cohen. But I have an excuse. I broke my hip bone and had 4 screws put
in it 3 weeks ago today. Pain and Cohen and codeine.

"Notable American Women" fiction by Ben Marcus. His use reality breaking
language, in fiction is astounding.

Just finished Harry Potter 5. Why? I read the first 4 and it is the only
thing escapist fantasy I can believe in anymore.

_The Watchmen_ graphic novel by Alan Moore. Moore is an intellectual comics
writer who never ceases to amaze me. I am going through Moore's work again
to gain poetic insights linking text with image in new ways.

you go, girl.
i just taught the intro to the Black Atlantic. i find the writing v
poignant; a brilliant sociologist who yearns to communicate the way
music does; his writing embodies the kind of "politics of
transfiguration" rather than fulfillment that he writes of so
beautifully, so diffidently.

_SNOUT no. 1. Because folded inside the folding slip-case poem by Simon
Pettet are some living large pieces by Eleni Sikelianos, Patrick Pritchett,
Rachel Levitsky and Anselm Hollo... all printed up by Laura Wright & Daron
Mueller. All together reason enough.

_Kay Boyle's Collected Poems. Because she did it so well long before so
many.

_John Clare, The Journals, Essays, and the Journey from Essex, edited by
Anne Tibble. Because  his essays have the stark truth and natural suppleness
of the poems. This testimony of mental anf physical anguish... and its
resistance is a needed read.

You are right. Though the word does exist in Turkish, the connotation of a
trajectory is not there. The idea of trajectory, it seems to me, is associated
with power.

Comparing apples and oranges. Would you prefer Jewish fundamentalist
theocracy, apartheid and inequality between the sexes, including making
contraceptives and abortion illegal? How about an immigration system that
guarantees citizenship to any Jew but denies it to someone whose
grandparents lived and died there?

Depends what you mean by quality of life. The average Tunisian is far less
likely to get blown up on a bus.

George,
    No shame in it!  And I'm with you! I had a big chunk of nose taken off
for skin cancer a couple of weeks ago and am still, often, on pills, and am
reading up a storm: The Madam by Julianna Baggott, The Golden Child by
Penelope Fitzgerald, and at least half a dozen other novels I can't remember
because tonight's glass of red wine didn't mix well with the pills.  Did
read Judith Hall's The Promised Folly, though, when I was clear-headed, and
loved it. Best American of 2003 is sitting on my table. Along with Lorna
Crozier's new book.
    I wish you no pain and much healthy good movement,
Renee (who doesn't speak up too often, but, hey, what the heck...)

How, Mark? E.g., by hammer-throw? Can you suggest a way (by a single verb)
in English? As by a trebuchet? A lariat? A sling? ("Some people call it a
sling blade; I call it a Kaiser blade"?) To sickle? To scythe? To chuck?
English in billiards? Massé? Sending Galileo once around Venus, twice around
Earth to wind up the gravitational mainspring to zing it to Jupiter? Perhaps
the idea resides in a particular, rather than in a lexicographical
abstraction. A potential coinage? (Not one that, like a back-formation,
would violate the normal modes of production of new words, but a
grammatically legitimate innovation--e.g., "to waffle," as in to adopt a
trajectory swinging toward its own black hole; syn., "to Dubya"). Eh?

Reading the copy of Eileen Myles _Not Me_ which I bought yesterday at the
Grolier... after both the purchase and a nice conversation with Louisa...
well, she search my bag! By the way...the reading in Boston for Carve was
really great! oh and the Ann Lauterbach & Anselm Berrigan reading today here
in Western MA was great as well! and I'm sure the Creeley reading this
Wednesday at Wesleyan will be great...and then there's the reading this
Friday with Laura Solomon, Nick Mourdy and myself at Amherst Books in
Amherst MA at 7ish which'll also be great...reading? who has time to read???

Yeah and Brenda Coultas and Wendy Walters and I will be doing a great
reading on Saturday 9.27 in Ithaca NY courtesy of Jane Sprague's West
End Poetry Series.  It'll be great and we'll all have a great time
--it'd be great to see any and all there.

Listening to Peg Leg Sam... Reading Effective AWK Programming, which I
recommend to anyone using this unix/linux program. And Thought Reform and
the Psychology of Totalism, Robert Jay Lifton, which is relevant to the
idea of philosophical totality as well; The Book of The Thousand Nights
and One Night, Powys Mathers translation; Nicholas Negroponte's Being
Digital - already outdated history, 1995, the dark ages; Jonathan Cott's
Wandering Ghost, The Odyssey of Lafcadio Hearn (for obvious reasons I
think); various books and articles on WiFi networks and community access;
and ongoing reference to Ch'ien Tzu Wen, The Thousand Character Classic, A
Chinese Primer, edited by Francis W. Paar, which I try not to read ahead
of where we are on our own. Spent tonight looking up the history of early
plastics and vulcanized rubber, as a result of a lice comb I have from
1865 which needs a bit of research. Meanwhile -

"To swing" goes only part of the way in my 'internal' lexicon; I think of
trajectory as more ballistic--as what happens when a thing, swung from
something which supports it (an arm, a string) flies free of all but gravity
and eventually falls (what happens when the yo-yo string breaks).

Schwartz's work is characterized by precise, restrained
vocabulary that yields to the pressures of memory, anguish, and desire:

If we want this - Did we live this?
Fix a last word to your heart:
fix it fast - let it feed all the previous prayers.

 (from  "Now Dust")

Gerald Schwartz is one of the founding members of the
performance ensemble Solomons Ramada and an ongoing

Currently in the middle of The Invisible Man (Wells). I was at the mall last
week and found a box of Wells from Dover for $10.50 - 6 books!

Also, those new Braincases are sitting next to my desk waiting for my lunch

Just read (after meaning to for 2 years) Joanna Russ's How to suppress
women's writing. Reading aloud with Daron Mueller: Laird Hunt's Indiana,
Indiana. Bedtime reading: Pound's Cantos, some Robert Pinget stories
about Mr. Songe, Nietzsche (not very successfully). This morning, I was
re-reading Alice Notley's Mysteries of small houses (alongside the bag
the rice cakes came in). And in the bath the other day, Bernadette
Mayer's Desire of mothers to please others in letters, Midwinter day.
Other recent texts include Eleni Sikelianos' Monster lives of boys &
girls and Lewis Carroll's Alice in wonderland/through the looking glass.

Folks:

Re-reading and re-reading -- re-visioning -- Problem Pictures, Spencer
Selby's latest collection of visual poems. I hesitate to call it a
collection, a disparate group of individuals; the pieces seem tightly-knit,
a "narrative" whose line ebbs and grows in intensity, in density. I want to
project the book on to the ceiling, get outside its book-ness, turning
pages, holding the book open, breaking the flow.  I want to project it
hands-free, be able to switch pages with the blink of an eye, be able to
control the speed of the pages with my brain.

Also reading xtant3, new issue of a magazine brought out jointly by xtant
and anabasis. This issue is predominantly comprised of visual poetry -- Jim
Leftwich, Rea Nikonova, Theo Breur, Mike Basinski, Carlos Luis, David
Baptiste Chirot, numerous collaborations, but it also contains some
thought-provoking prose starting with "Letter to Vincent Ferrini" by Jim
Leftwich and "Slash and Burn Poetics" by Thomas Lowe Taylor.

Best, Crag Hill

I'm reading Ric Carfagna's Indeterminate NonLocality, part of his Notes on
NonExistence series, an inspired combination of post-language poetry and
graphic elements. Michael Rothenberg's Paris Journals is a fascinating
narrative working at the Post-Beat edge. Each of these poets deserves a
wider reading audience. As soon as I finish up Stephen Ratcliffe's Listening
to Reading, I'm going to start TELLING IT SLANT, to feed my brain some
theory and cause it to become more hyperactive than usual. I'm laughing out
load at David Sedaris's NAKED. He's a popular essayist, but as a fellow
Touretter I especially appreciate what I perceive as a particularly
Tourettic slant to his hilarious exaggerations. I seem to be out of Miami
mysteries at the moment.

-- Lutherans don't have monasteries.  There is no institution except for
the church.  Until 1975 women weren't permitted to preach.  In the
Catholic church I don't think women can preach even today.  Luther felt
that monasteries and nunneries made for idle people.  He wanted the
church to interact with commoners and be part of daily life.  He thought
that churchmen should have families and learn to change diapers.  St.
Thomas Aquinas thought they should spend as much time as possible
contemplating God.  Personally, if I was a churchman I'd rather spend my
time pretending contemplating God while actually yucking it up like the
monks in Eco's novel.

-- I'm pretty bored by politics and theology.  I especially dislike
radicalism, because I am lazy, especially in regard to helping others.
I would like to help other people as little as possible.  I could  be
bothered to pull the trigger for a suicide.  I like to keep as much of
my time and space as possible.  In short, I hate other people, and
Lutheranism is my way to reinforce this.  I remain interested in humor
and aesthetics.  I'm afraid that I only posted the two kingdoms and the
just war idea to indicate that there is an alternative.  But I don't
want to be in the position of defending them.  I've had two or three
fist fights, but would not fight for anything.  I'm too bored by it, and
I hate being injured.  The fist fights were all mistakes -- I was
playing around with other guys when I was ten or twelve and suddenly it
got out of hand.  As for Lutheranism, it makes a fun study, like
herpetology.  It requires enormous reading, and I doubt if you'd have
the taste for this any more than I'd have the taste for reading Forell.
we read out of selfish interests generally, and I read Lutheranism to
escape the much more heavy discourse of Marxism, and the crazy discourse
of anarchism, and so on.  It also lets me off the hook because Lutherans
don't believe in good works.  Or so I held.  But now my pastor got wind
of what I've been circulating in the church, and has decided to overturn
this and is suddenly citing James left and right and center.  Ha, so I
got maximum fun for minimum effort.  Also, Luther makes me cry.  He
touches me like nobody else.  And now I'm going to have to help out at
the bake sale.

Small Press Traffic presents
Friday, September 26, 2003 at 7:30 p.m.
Yedda Morrison & Kim Rosenfield

Sianne Ngai on Yedda Morrison?s first full-length collection, Crop (Kelsey St.
Press, 2003): "From insecticide to plastic heels, no one has explored the
disturbing intimacies between persons and things that arise in a system of
exploited labor with as much insight?. Addressed to a world in which
everything is brutally functionalized (picked, pumped, husked, inserted,
breasted)?, her poetry unflinchingly confronts the violence behind the
production of the sweet." Morrison co-edits Tripwire and co-curated our
interdisciplinary Crosstown Traffic series for SPT; her previous works include
The Marriage of the Well-Built Head (Double Lucy, 1998) and Shed (a+bend,
2000). Her photography has shown at Southern Exposure and New Langton Arts. A
California native, she joins us from Oakland.

David Buuck on Kim Rosenfield?s first full-length collection, Good Morning?
Midnight? (Roof Books, 2001). "Here feminist theory simultaneously picks apart
a feast of fashion and (gendered) self-help discourse while taking delight in
the festivities?. A carnivalesque aesthetic?combines a strong ear for the pure
pop of advertising lingo and a surgeon's touch when it comes to cut'n'pasting.
She avoids easy moralizing over consumerism and media, implicating our own
appetites within the omnipresent public discourse of commodity aesthetics."
Rosenfield co-edited Object magazine during the 90s; previous works include
Rx, Cool Clean Chemistry (Leave Books, 1994) and a perfume, Trama. Don?t miss
her The Truth Interview (with Brian Kim Stefans; see
arras.net/truth_interview). She joins us from NYC.

All events are $5-10 sliding scale, free to members & the CCA community.
& are held in Timken Lecture Hall, CCA SF Campus.
Please see our website for a map.

Please send along any donations you see fit; these are rough times for
California arts organizations, SPT included. Donations to SPT are tax
deductible. (nb while we are kindly housed at CCA, we remain autonomous and
thus responsible for all of our own programming & overhead costs.) Thank you
in advance for your kind support.

Forgive me I thought you meant George Sorell.  I looked up George Forell.  I
had never heard of him, but he looks interesting.  What have you read of
him, and why?  Sorell on the other hand is what I was thinking about.
Sorry, as they say.

The idea of trajectory, it seems to me, is associated with power.
<snip>

That's interesting. Perhaps some English 'combined' senses are analogous
with a vector: torque plus direction = force. The idea of swing = (physical)
force and (abstract) power is there in the etymology.

Here's Shakespeare in *Troilus & Cressida*:

   '... the ram that batters down the wall,
   For the great swing and rudeness of his poise,
   They place before his hand that made the engine'

Here's Dryden Englishing Virgil:

   '... and, rising as he threw,
   With its full swing the fatal weapon flew'

And here's George Herbert in *The Glance*:

      'Since that time many a bitter storm
   My soul hath felt, ev'n able to destroy,
   Had the malicious and ill meaning harm
                         His swing and sway'

English has lost the collocation 'swing and sway' and most of that sense of
'swing', although it still survives for 'sway'.

Not why, but what:
1. Bedtime reading, Meredith and I together, sleepytime infantilism and
great fun, neither of us reading ahead, so we can, um, prolong the
pleasure:=20
Powys Mather's version of the Thousand and One Nights, arrived ten days
ago.
2. Browsing, off and on. The Analects of Confucius: A Philosophical
Translation, by Ames and Rosemount (and I just caught myself, typing
Analects of Confusion).
3. Just finishing up Mike Bryan's wonderful bagatelle The Afterword.

 Was just about to start=20
4. Stephen Kinzer's All The Shah's Men when
5. Thomas Meyer's Coromandel arrived in the post, so that's gonna bump
Confucius, and we'll see what happens after that (I mean, I will).

And reading Niedecker for an hour or so every day, to be ready for next
month's centenary conference.

It's incredibly wonderful to be retired and read something and not have
to teach the damn thing, but just read it =96 though what that  "just"
means I leave to your guesses.

That's a fascinating question. I poem I recently translated from Turkish,
souljam, deals with that question. In this poem and in Sufism and in Turkish, a
projectile of expansion (towards chaos) coexists with the reverse movement of
compression (towards union). This is what Sufism calls arcs of ascent and
descent. These two movements are coneptual shiftsrather than sequential.

The same idea exists in Poe's Eureka, as forces of repulsion and attraction.

The idea of trajectory in the Westy has usually been associated with power (a
force swing out). In Turkish it has to do with metaphysics, the nature of
reality.

I don't know if this exactly answers your question. It is an issue which can
be approached tagentially. That's what my upcoming Turkish anthology is all
about; souljam will be part of it.

Great examples, exactly what I mean. Years ago I gave a talk on "content,"=20
how the root of that word became "tantra" (weaving) as it moved east. I don'=
t=20
remember the details now; but when the same root moved west into Latin=20
(tentere?), it assumed different connotations.

"Content" in the east is associated with spiritual movement -an analogous=20
divergence which exists in the word "swing."

Sorry to report that Gus Blaisdell, poet, writer, and
educator died on September 17, 2003, in Albuquerque,
N.M., four days short of his 68th birthday.  Gus taught
cinema studies courses at UNM for almost 25 years, and
published many works including "Fractionally Awake Monad,"
 "Prose Ocean" and "Dented Fenders."

Gus also was proprietor of the Living Batch bookstore for
many years and made it into a landmark independent
bookstore in Albuquerque.  He also published many books
with his Living Batch Press.

A memorial service will be held at the UNM Alumni Chapel
on Tuesday, September 23, at 5:30pm.....

sadly reporting,
     David Benedetti

David Bellos's bio of Georges Perec because I've been interested in the
Oulipo for quite some time. Perec's work is stranger and wider ranging
than I'd realized--weird multi-lingual radio plays to a novel in the form
of a cento (not just that novel w/ no "e").

Georges Perec, La Cloture et autres poemes. Very, very slowly -- my French
was never great and time ain't improved it. Why? To see what Perec can do
w/in the constraints of a heterogram (isogram).

Michaux, Selected Writings. The old NDP bilingual edition. Just because I
enjoy off-kilter stuff.

H.P. Lovecraft, The Dreamquest of Unknown Kadath. I'm not going to try to
explain this one. Call it a guilty pleasure.

David Loy, A Buddhist History of the West. The book previous to the one a
local BPF study group read together.

Not what, but why:

1. Because I'm teaching it - that is, asking other people to read it,
supposing they will be somehow edified, improved, if they do.
2. Because I'm being taught it - although from this side of the
transaction that verb seems less appropriate. But someone has asked me
to read it, in any case, and to have opinions about it.
3. Because I anticipate needing to know what it says - basically similar
to the last reason, but in a less formal context. Part of me thinks this
practicality is an unfortunate side effect of being a "scholar", but
another part loves being directed by something other than my own whims.
4. So that I can tell the author what's wrong with it and evaluate its
worth (in the context of reason 1, that is).
5. Because I'm avoiding reading the things I should be reading for
reasons 1-4.
6. Because it happens to be before my eyes. On the subway, for instance,
or the back of a bag of chips.
7. Because I want to learn how other people write - which isn't always
apparent just from reading, but sometimes you get glimpses.
8. In order to feel like I have some understanding of events happening
now in the world around me, and something appropriate to talk about at
parties and in elevators. Reading in this category is for the most part
strictly ephemeral.
9. Because I read it before, perhaps more than once, and reading it
again makes me feel the way I did during that time.
10. Because I need to know how to operate it, or the device it
describes.
11. Because I'm trying to learn Spanish.
12. So that I can sing along to it.
13. Because I need to be reminded of the plot of the Oresteia, or
because I'm trying to remember the geography of Boston, or what happened
to Rudolph Hess, or the origin of "lox", or I have been otherwise led to
it by something else I'm reading.
14. Because I'm sad.
15. Because it came in the mail.
16. Because I know the author and I'm curious and I suffer from the
delusion that reading it will allow me to fathom that person's character
in a way that I can't by simply being around them. That in writing there
is a always a secret.
17. Because I wrote it myself and more I re-read it the more I am driven
to read it again, to delve deeper, to perfect it in a fundamentally
impossible way, or perhaps, vainly, to better fathom the author.
18. Because I think I'm right on the verge of something, and this one
might push me over.
19. Not for any of the reasons above, but just because I find it
slightly funny that I, of all people, should be reading it.
20. Because I'm about to throw it on the fire.

Thinkin on a master…?
…and it goes like what?
trample yuh ramblin ablative
Dig this
Seen?


Ugly in being/swingin from hymns/
Signifying B.U.T./
Limbs shrink to pins/
Just another mark/
Set the dogs on victim/
I’ll hang myself up/
A dial tone in my lessons/
Please hold/
Onto your solitary notions
Somethings still blind me/
Cypher the mission/
Check my delivery/
Caught in the last phrase
A methodology
Of Criminalogy
Overkill in poems/

Milling in the illin/
Murdas make a schillin/
What a killin/
Destroying wisdom/
Currupting overstanding

Screamin/holleration/
Shit kickin aspirations/
Check the force of it
Clap eyez on my tims/
Water and treasures/
Things fall from my hands/
A sinner is sentences
My judgements last stand
He said ‘”you are nothin”
That kid he’s wicked/
He kinda homely/
A little prissy
My worth  collapses
What a sissy/
Listen to spits
I’m a mark/come crash me
With subliminal attacks
I couldn’t get a ticket
I couldn’t shout back
Cuz I can’t even kick it/
Or drop a track
So I’ll drill a hole in my dome
Make it blow with conviction/
Drag my body on concrete/
I’ll do the driving/

Milling in the illin/
Murdas make a schillin/
What a killin/destroying wisdom/
Currupting overstanding

What I got at my head rhymes with fun
Sun comes to sear a note/
Hear’s the pun
Some savages float
Can you feel it/
My speakers bang it
Bloodsteams with dope
Africans landing/
Dusted on my Island/
Lyrics by schizophrenics/
Depressives flex confusion/
We need another prophet/
Scroll the ingrediance in my prescription
It’s the Pacific tones
Used up for the pleasure
I stand on beaches
Which way is home?
Check that shit
The niggaz runnin for bikers
Collapsing a fool what became a fucka/
Spooks and coppers
Fear and paranoia
It was a masque fixed on brutha
Now taken for a sucka/
Immolation of reason/
He’s just a puppet to emotions/

Chillin and illin/
Murdas make a schillin/
What a killin/destroying wisdom/
Currupting overstanding
Watch me fumble my plan/
My bruthas be spittin/
What am I?/who am I?
A full front and crawlin/

Ropes and ice/
It’s the day of a lord/
Lost in the phone/
A failure in a lifetime/
You must atone
Blackhearts or spades
A disgrace/
The banks overdrawn
Downtime for the Nation/
Do I still got a trace/
A body left with slashes/
A passing brings a blessing/
Witness the‘ole kid
As the punk hollas
Welcome

Millin in the illin/
Murdas make a schillin/
What a killin/my daddy’s greatness/
Makes me feel like dyin/
He lost his mind/another product
Of the demented American crime/
To me his still Divine/
B.U.T. we’re both out of time

Went to madness defending a block/
Chasing bruthas armed with rocks/
Inna net/stressed/strifed and caught/
The jakes just watched
Twist and crawl/
Whisper to sleepers/
Will they ever awake/
Olde English and beepers
Vampires with stakes/
Run a trace along my lineage/
Draw a pattern on my arm/
Take a stab at my massacre /
Grab a cypher unknown/
Slash the soul of song/
It’s like O.D.in’ alone/

We be illin in this millennium/
Murdas make a schillin/
What a killin/destroying wisdom/
Currupting overstanding
My language turned to crying/
It’s a belly filled with poison/
A notebook turned to prophecy/
My personal armagedeon
Let me take this to completion/
My breddin/is it fact or fiction
Or is it religion
When praying alone
You cyan say “Amin”

Canadian writer Lisa Robertson has lived in Vancouver for twenty-odd years
and is in the midst of moving to the nineteenth arrondisement. Her books of
poetry include The Apothecary, XEclogue, Debbie: An Epic, and The Weather.
Forthcoming from Clear Cut Press in Fall 2003 is Occasional Works and Seven
Walks from the Office for Soft Architecture, a linked series of essays on
cities, architecture and ornament. She moonlights as an astrologist for
Nest: a Quarterly of Interiors under the pen name Swann.

Jessica Fisher is a doctoral candidate in the department of English at UC
Berkeley.  She is currently writing a dissertation focused on the
psychological function of the poetic mode, particularly as manifested in the
late novels of Virginia Woolf.  For the past year, she has worked with
Robert Hass on a project to install poems in the sidewalk of the downtown
Berkeley arts corridor; she will co-edit a book on the project in the coming
year.  Jessica has twice received the Eisner Prize for her poetry, and her
translation of a poem by Czeslaw Milosz appeared in The New York Review of
Books.

Shine or grill them focus
The Moon fixed on crescents
Ummah on the night of their visions
Vanilla primitive
A Viking striped bare pon his invasion
Loco in my essay
I crush you to completion
I’ll scratch your back with the Nextmen
Mi vato calo
Holla
Simone!!!
Snuggle your pleasure under blankets
Fact to face um
Mano y mano
Cara ya cora
Yo dude! I’m on it
No intimidation in what you feelin
Wrapped in garments
Dangle from coat hangers
Disembodied
Limbs
Hallucinations
Crawling
Rapping silks of you package
For a requiem
Last exits for lyrics
Blowin bullets
Run a finger along your 5th column
Spankin bad poets
Making bards hard
Cocktails and harpers
Hanif and prophets
Vessels held in recordable cylinder
Loudspeakers for transmuting
All of His message
Come fuse it
Boom
We are two spirits
Zom dom boom
Come pound it to a single
Dom boom zig/zig
4 to 5 degrees
zooom bop dom
Per minute
Aaaaaaaah tchooc click, dom
My Injinn races

28.

We are, uh, stuck in this, uh, dimension and time.
Smoke the day's last cigarette, all lights on. The sky
creeps around the corners of houses. Storming through
a cry of slamming doors. Clouds make a half-eaten
cookie under the Dandy Warhols. I am a scientist.
Swoon units.
Your eyes, nipples almost stilled by ivy. Power to the
people! What haunts Europe like. Crawling. With the
ill behavior with the ill behavior with the ill
behavior with the ill behavior. Shadows of unseen
birds skipping across blank pavement. I knew clouds
lke this. I promise not to move so fast you can't
catch me. You were the last high, by the Dandy
Warhols. I lick the shadow of you, unseen, from the
forgotten densities of every minute. So we eat to
steady our head; in our belly we carry more than air.
You post photos of someone else. We watch everything
through holes. Cherish is a word I use to describe. I
don't understand this joke. I'm losing you. Or maybe I
see myself skimming the underbrush, bloody with all
the thunder of Isabel touched down, in 1969. An empty
plastic bag a puppet for wind's desire. Dirt. Focus.
If you rain on me tonight, with billows of glint and
waterlillies, if the cemetary follows wilting as
protocol for XP drivers, if serially I savage gauges
of how you love through miles me recursive in my
loneliness, what grammar marbles our relations to our
limbs, still tangled, what placement of seperate
arguing can save us from volumes of love?

Hi again,

There's an interview with me and a new sequence, "The 'Nineties' Tried Your
Game," on the Iowa Review web:

http://www.uiowa.edu/~iareview/tirweb/feature/stefans/

Also, am teaching my first poetry writing workshop at the Poetry Project:

"Jai-Alai for Autocrats"

SATURDAYS AT 12 PM: 10 Sessions Begin October 18th.
Stefans writes, "This workshop will focus on the relationship between poems
inspired by a sense of play - the way we appreciate words when they're
randomly, surprisingly conjoined - and work, which might be loosely
described as poems that are subtly crafted, resistant to easy meanings, even
'traditional.' We'll look at elements of prosody that extend beyond meter as
it is generally understood - whether that be the counting of accents or the
line by breath - into the use of literary masks, deviant syntaxes, Oulipian
practices, writing in dialect (invented or not), and experiments with
computers." Stefans' books include Free Space Comix and Fashionable Noise:
On Digital Poetics.

The workshop fee is $300. This includes a one year Individual membership, as
well as tuition for any and all workshops at the Poetry Project for the fall
and spring. Reservations are required due to limited class space, and
payment must be received in advance. Please send payment and reservations
to:

The Poetry Project
St. Mark's Church
131 E. 10th St.
New York, NY 10003

For more information, please call (212) 674-0910, or email:
info@poetryproject.com

All workshops will be held in the Parish Hall at St. Mark's Church on the
corner of 10th St. and 2nd Ave.

What's Jai-alai???

Lewis--thanks, I always enjoy your postings. To say it with a poem...Kristy

The virgins of Chicago

are all saving themselves for Bono.
This is oddly reassuring and ugly
like a lampshade covered in
postage stamps of the Madonna
and child, you wake up
around two on the porch
in the sun and mumble "I
must be getting some-
where." The bungalows
dream of being inhabited
by redheads, dusk penetrates
them and it's almost as good.

Small Press Traffic presents
Friday, September 26, 2003 at 7:30 p.m.
Yedda Morrison & Kim Rosenfield

Sianne Ngai on Yedda Morrison's first full-length collection, Crop (Kelsey St.
Press, 2003): "From insecticide to plastic heels, no one has explored the
disturbing intimacies between persons and things that arise in a system of
exploited labor with as much insight. Addressed to a world in which everything
is brutally functionalized (picked, pumped, husked, inserted, breasted), her
poetry unflinchingly confronts the violence behind the production of the
sweet." Morrison co-edits Tripwire and co-curated our interdisciplinary
Crosstown Traffic series for SPT; her previous works include The Marriage of
the Well-Built Head (Double Lucy, 1998) and Shed (a+bend, 2000). Her
photography has shown at Southern Exposure and New Langton Arts. A California
native, she joins us from Oakland and will be debuting her new bioposys, which
are to be part of "pocket parks" for urban dwellers.

David Buuck on Kim Rosenfield's first full-length collection, Good Morning--
Midnight-- (Roof), one of SPT's Books of the Year for 2001: "Here feminist
theory simultaneously picks apart a feast of fashion and (gendered) self-help
discourse while taking delight in the festivities. A carnivalesque
aesthetic...combines a strong ear for the pure pop of advertising lingo and a
surgeon's touch when it comes to cut'n'pasting. She avoids easy moralizing
over consumerism and media, implicating our own appetites within the
omnipresent public discourse of commodity aesthetics." Rosenfield co-edited
Object magazine during the 90s; her previous works include Rx, Cool Clean
Chemistry (Leave Books, 1994) and a perfume, Trama. Don't miss her The Truth
Interview (with Brian Kim Stefans; see arras.net/truth_interview). She joins
us from NYC, bringing bottles of Trama we hope!


All events are $5-10 sliding scale, free to members & the CCA community.
& are held in Timken Lecture Hall, CCA SF Campus.
Please see our website for a map.

Please send along any donations you see fit; these are rough times for

i love this game:

here's my little stack:

Jim Leftwich *Doubt* (still and always) 589 pages!
Don McKay *Birding, or desire* (picked it up for a (canadian) dollar at
Pages on Kensington in Calgary... uh, guilty pleasure....)
*Raddle Moon* #19 (they're giving up the ghost: don't give up the ghost!)
Fred Wah *Diamond Grill* (i went to the conference unprepared)
*The Review of Contemporary Fiction* spring 1999: Ed(ward) Sanders issue
(another dollar find: the Fugs!: a secret location on the lower east
side!)

Isaac Deutcher *The Prophet Armed: Trotsky: 1879-1921* (volume 1) found
this for twenty-five cents (canadian) at the thrift store in Vanderhoof,
BC... only problem tho: it has the section p. 421-452 twice and is missing
pages 85-116: i don't suppose anybody out there has the copy with the
reverse error?

derek beaulieu *with wax* (plus a whole envelope full of housepress and
new gallery publications, thanks derek!)

Thomas Lowe Taylor *Superprose*

plus a nice little stack of microchapbooks by Andrew Russ/Endwar/Stuart
Pid (great microconcrete!)

oh and also the interview with P. Inman at http://www.monoecious.org

no, but I have a slightly related question -

what's up with both CBS, the "Tiffany Network" and ABC/Disney/ESPN using
conservative political commentators as sports announcers?  Dennis Miller
was one thing, but Rush Limbaugh?

AND Gregg Easterbrook, who has a contest in the New Republic to name his
blog?

Indeed, the habits of reading are as interesting as those of writing - =

reading so many books simultaneously.  Like Patrick, I'm primarily =
reading the books I'm writing on:

Robert Creeley's A Quick Graph
Jerome Rothenberg's Pre-Faces & Other Writings
Johanna Drucker's The Visible Word
Daniel Berkeley Updike's Printing Types: Their History, Forms, and Use =
(Vol II)
Gerard Genette's Paratexts: Thresholds of Interpretation

& for other pleasure(s)

Tom Raworth's Logbook, Moving, & The Relation Ship
Ben Watson's Frank Zappa: The Negative Dialectics of Poodle Play
Johanna Drucker's Damaged Spring
Alan Loney's The Erasure Tapes

& unpublished works by Thom Donovan, Craig Dworkin, Andrew Levy and =

The two new Hejinian titles are currently available from SPD =
(orders@spdbooks.org / www.spdbooks.org).  The Fatalist is from Omnidawn =
and My Life in the Nineties is from Shark Books.  I'm sure official =
announcements will be made here at some points, but the books have =
literally just arrived to the distributor and so possibly largely =
unheard of now.  If you go to the SPD site and search Hejinian they'll =
come up.

most of the right wing blogs are Neo-Conservative (read Jewish, Irving
Kristol type) and tend toward the 'intellectual'
they are also policy driven.  The Weekly Standard has a 'conservative
poetry' blog that is dreadful. I went to college and am friends with Andrea
K Andrews who is a leading Neo-Con blogger, she works for Senator Shelby
from Alabama and she told me that the biggest difference between Neo Con
blog and talk radio is that "people who blog have power-- talk radio
listeners are proles"

The two new Hejinian titles are currently available from SPD
(orders@spdbooks.org / www.spdbooks.org).  The Fatalist is from Omnidawn and
My Life in the Nineties is from Shark Books.  I'm sure official
announcements will be made here at some points, but the books have literally
just arrived to the distributor and so possibly largely unheard of now.  If
you go to the SPD site and search Hejinian they'll come up.

Dear Patrick,
        Boy, you're reading a lot! (Are you convalescent or
taking a long bath?) Can you give me pub. details re the Hejinians?
            Wystan

Perhaps not exactly what you're looking for but worth checking out is an
article in (I think) last week's Village Voice that reports on blog
campaigning.

Or perhaps the 15 year old Augustine? Or even, I see here at the back of =
the
book is a story I've never noticed or read about Ernestine.

Pauline? Hmm... what was name of Justine's sister?=20

With a name like Pauline I can only think of that Australian far-righter
(not writer), Pauline Hanson (not Manson)

This Welcome Message updated 24 March 2003.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Above the world-weary horizons
New obstacles for exchange arise
Or unfold,
O ye postmasters!

1. About the Poetics List

With the preceeding epigraph, the Poetics Listserv was founded by Charles
Bernstein in late 1993. Now in its third incarnation, the list carries
about 1000 subscribers worldwide, though all of these subscribers do not
necessarily receive messages at any given time. A good number of other
people read the Poetics List via our web archives (see web-address above).

Our aim is to support, inform, and extend those directions in poetry that
are committed to innovations, renovations, and investigations of form
and/or/as content, to the questioning of received forms and styles, and to
the creation of the otherwise unimagined, untried, unexpected, improbable,
and impossible.  We recognize that other lists may sponsor other
possibilities for exchange in this still-new medium. We request that those
participating in this forum keep in mind the specialized and focused nature
of this project, and respect our decision to operate a moderated list. For
subscription information or to contact the moderators, write to
<poetics@acsu.buffalo.edu>.

This is a private list and information about this list should not be posted
to other lists or directories of lists. The idea is to keep the list
membership to those with specific rather than general interests, and also
to keep the scale of the list relatively small and the volume manageable.
The current limits of the list are 50 messages per day, and two messages
per subscriber per day.

The Poetics List is a moderated list. Due to the high number of
subscribers, we no longer maintain the open format with which the list
began (at under 100 subscribers). The specific form of moderation that we
employ is a relatively fluid one: in most cases, messages are reviewed
after having been posted to the list, and difficulties resolved on that
basis; however, the list moderators may shift with impunity between this
and a pre-review mode which calls for all messages to be read and approved
before being forwarded to the list. We prefer to avoid this option, as it
hampers the spontaneity of discussion that we hope to promote. In addition
to these options, the list moderators may place subscribers who find
themselves unable to abide by the rules of the list under individual
review, in which case only their messages would be received for moderators'
approval before being forwarded to the list. We remain committed to this
editorial function as a defining element of the Poetics List (for further
information please see section 6 of this Welcome Message).

Those few individuals who are no longer welcome to post on this list have
forfeited that right because of their refusal to abide by list policies as
stated in this Welcome message. While we adhere to a practice of not
discussing particular cases on the list, the areas of our greatest concern
include flaming of other list subscribers, including the list owners,
and/or giving us false registration information. Please note some
individuals have publicized false accounts of the policies of the Poetics
List. We have deemed it unwise to respond directly to the flames of the
list, preferring simply to note here that the Poetics List exists to
support and encourage divergent points of view on Modern and contemporary
poetry and poetics. We are committed to do what is necessary to preserve
this space for such dialog. For this reason, the list has always been
private or moderated.

Further information on posting to the list for subscribers, publishers and
series-coordinators, see sections 5 and 6.

In addition to being archived at through the EPC (http://epc.buffalo.edu)
and at http://listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu/archives/poetics.html, some posts
to Poetics (especially reviews, obituary notices, announcements, etc.) may
also become part of specific EPC subject areas. Brief reviews of poetry
events and publications are always welcome; we also encourage posts that
announce events important to our subscribers. See section 5 for details.

----------------

2. Subscriptions

Subscriptions to the Poetics List are free of charge, but formal
registration is required. We ask that when you subscribe you provide your
full name, street address, email address, and telephone number. All posts
to the list should provide your full real name, as registered. If there is
any discrepancy between your full name as it appears in the "from" line of
the message header, please sign your post at the bottom.  PLEASE NOTE: All
subscription-related information and correspondence remains absolutely
confidential.

To subscribe to the Poetics List, please contact the moderators at the
lists' administrative address <poetics@acsu.buffalo.edu>. Your message
should include all of the required information. All other questions about
subscriptions, whether about an individual subscription or subscription
policy, should be addressed to this same administrative address.

PLEASE NOTE: IT MAY TAKE SEVERAL WEEKS TO PROCESS SUBSCRIPTION REQUESTS.

The most frequent problem with subscriptions is bounced messages. If your
system is often down or if you have a low disk quota, Poetics messages may
get bounced. Please try avoid having messages from the list returned to us.
If the problem is low disk quota, you may wish to request an increased
quota from your system administrator.  You might also consider obtaining a
commercial account. In general, if a good number of Poetics messages are
bounced from your account, your subscription to Poetics will be temporarily
suspended. If this happens, you may re-subscribe to the list by contacting
the moderators at<poetics@acsu.buffalo.edu>.

-----------------

3. Subscription Options

We encourage you to alter your subscription options via the link on the
right side of the screen at
http://listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu/archives/poetics.html.  If you would
prefer not to use the web-interface, you may also email
<listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu> the following commands:

*to receive posts in the default option (you will receive individual
postings immediately), send <listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu> this one-line
message with no "subject": set poetics nodigest

* to receive the list in digest form (you will receive the day's individual
posts in one email sent just after midnight EST), send
<listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu> this one-line message with no "subject":
set poetics digest

* to receive the list in index form (you will receive a list, without the
text of the posts, of the subjects discussed each day along with the
author's name and address and the number of lines it comprises; you can
also choose to have the index sent to you in either plain text or in HTML
format with hyperlinks), send <listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu> this one-line
message with no "subject": set poetics nohtml index  --or--  set poetics
html index

*to temporarily turn off Poetics mail send <listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu>
this one-line message with no "subject": set poetics nomail

*to reactivate Poetics mail send <listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu> this
one-line message with no "subject": set poetics mail

PLEASE NOTE: do not leave your Poetics subscription "active" if you are
going to be away for any extended period of time.  Your account may become
flooded and you may lose not only Poetics messages but other important mail.

-----------------------

4.  To Unsubscribe

To unsubscribe (or change any of your subscription options) go to the
right-hand side of the screen at
http://listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu/archives/poetics.html  You may also may
unsubscribe by sending a one-line email to <listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu>
with no "subject": unsub poetics

If you are having difficulty unsubscribing, please note: sometimes your
e-mail address may be changed slightly by your system administrator. If
this happens you will not be able to send messages to Poetics or to
unsubscribe, although you will continue to receive mail from the Poetics
List. To avoid this problem, unsub using your old address, then return to
your new address and contact the moderators at <poetics@acsu.buffalo.edu>
to resubscribe. If you find that it is not possible to unsub using your old
address, please contact the moderators at <poetics@acsu.buffalo.edu> for
assistance.

--------------------------

5.  Posting to the List

The Poetics List is a moderated list. All messages are reviewed by the
moderators in keeping with the goals of the list as articulated in this
Welcome Message (see section 1).

Please note that while this list is primarily concerned with discussions of
poetry and poetics, messages relating to politics and political activism,
film, art, media, and so forth are also welcome. Feel free to query the
list moderators if you are uncertain as to whether a message is
appropriate. All correspondence with the moderators regarding submissions
to the list remains confidential and should be directed to us at
<poetics@acsu.buffalo.edu>.

We strongly encourage subscribers to post information on publications and
reading series that they have coordinated, edited, published, or in which
they appear. Such announcements constitute a core function of this list.
Brief reviews of poetry events and publications are always welcome.

To post to the Poetics List, send your messages directly
to the list address: <poetics@listserv.buffalo.edu>

Please do not send messages intended for posting to the list to our
administrative address <poetics@acsu.buffalo.edu>

For further information on posting to the list, see section 6 below.

-------------------

6. Cautions

"Flame" messages will not be tolerated on the Poetics List. In this
category are included messages gratuitously attacking fellow listees or the
list owners, also messages designed to "waste bandwidth" or cause the list
to reach its daily limit. These messages are considered offensive and
detrimental to list discussion. Offending subscribers will be placed on
temporary review (see section 1). Repeat offenders will be removed from the
list immediately. Please do not put this policy to test.

For reasons of basic security, we do not allow pseudononymous
subscriptions.  We also discourage the sending of HTML-formatted messages
to the list. All messages intended for the Poetics List should be sent in
Text-Only format.

Please also do not send attachments or include extremely long documents
(1,000+ words) in a post.  Messages containing attachments will be presumed
to be worm- or virus-carrying and will not be forwarded to the list.

Please do not publish list postings without the express permission of the
author. Posting on the list is a form of publication. Copyright for all
material posted on Poetics remains with the author; material from this list
and its archive may not be reproduced without the author's permission,
beyond the standard rights accorded by "fair use" of published materials.

As an outside maximum, we will accept no more than 2 messages per day from
any one subscriber. Also, given that our goal is a manageable list
(manageable both for moderators and subscribers), the list accepts 50 or
fewer messages per day.

Like all systems, the listserv will sometimes be down: if you feel your
message has been delayed or lost, *please wait at least one day to see if
it shows up*, then check the archive to be sure the message is not posted
there; if you still feel there is a problem, you may wish to contact the
moderators at <poetics@acsu.buffalo.edu>.

PUB: call for papers--recent african poetry
===================================

Recent African Poetry



Recent appraisals of African writing have not paid adequate attention to

poetry as a genre. This creates a space for an urgent critical

intervention. Essays intended for an international audience are therefore

solicited for inclusion in a collection of essays tentatively entitled

Reading Contemporary African Poetry .The book is to bring together

innovative but readable explorations of recent African poetry of English

expression.


The editor welcomes well-researched essays aimed at (re)reading

established and emergent African poets and poetic traditions. Contributors

are at liberty to explore any aspect of recent African poetry, including

excavations of indigenous forms and conventions, national and/regional

trends and traditions, exilic poetry, prison poetry, generational mapping,

(en)gendered concerns, inter-textual concerns, contested canons,

representation of dictatorships, formal subversions, the oral/written

interface, post-apartheid writing, defence and promotion of human rights,

self-inscription and the censored imagination.


Submissions should be between fifteen and twenty-five pages, although

longer contributions will be accepted in exceptional circumstances.

Contributors are encouraged but not necessarily bound to adopt the MLA

format in preparing their essays, and submissions can initially be made

either electronically or in two hard copies. Even though the deadline for

submissions is January 30, 2004, the editor welcomes early submissions and

enquiries.


All contributions should be sent to:

 Dr. Oyeniyi Okunoye,


Department of English,


Obafemi Awolowo University,


Ile ‚ÄìIfe ,Nigeria.

29.

Walking down a wooded road
after midnight, until you hit
frequented streets
is a synthesis of sex. Streetlights
in parking lots alone
alternate amber and
a frigid blue. F. W. Murnau
steps through fireworks
of puddles into
WnterMute's autumnal speech.
This is how to beautify
your syntax: rolls of love
and involving lathes
think as you vellum
in a parch. If I could patch
us up again, what I'd do
is suffer less, try to learn what
won't numb in words, try to flower
mathematically if I can, with
no wit of pleasure in my petals.
There's this awful tension (it's
night, and I have no hope but to
smoke milk and drink cigarettes, cast
from such polite society as a pieta
stippled with raucous syrups, as
simple then, and protruding
in my landing in fists across
the back of Maggie Evans, TAKE
THE KEY AND LOCK HER UP! But
I hope that because you had me
before this, long before my terrible
injuries made me reclusive and
corpulent, long nights of vowels
can pierce your tongue, to pleasure
with solemnity, those portraits I )
within me, that these words are
dead with me, and I float face-
down over your hair, kissing your face
with my dead lips until I learn to
blush again, and everything's
less still, less sacred. Sitting down
a mother's couch as a bed
in the same light in a room
everyone wakes up in, my index
finger fumes with nicotine and
malaise, I am again your clever
sophomore, not a dumb hulk of
brandy beads and satyr, writing
his suicide notes in chalk on the plains
of plantations and concentration camps
and murders that leak computers
into an ever-thinning air. Vestiges
of gentility still
paw these rotten
shores. Horizon
almost low
enough for notes.
I strip, lactating
purpose. I postpone gender. You
adore in vacant colors nasal drip
as a sign your body wants to live
badly enough. You are sugar-poisoned--
blue and red and wet in the morning,
you
don't move. I hope these words
find you well. They've been
so hungry. Armitage, too, though
the first thing I remember is the
sound of the lawnmower coming from
the houses ahead of me. And then
Jean knots this simplicity, this starvation;
starring at your hips, not limp
with strange fertile juice, but
heavy with it walking home
wishing I was walking on a red star.
I fell in love with a girl from Mars,
a raw sonic dithyramb, a meter
both alone and gathered in sameness;
I narrow in dim rooms. Why do I
like it here in the dark so much, I
ask Willie Loomis, I ask Aloysha
Karamazov, why do I keep my head down
and my eyes averted in the presence
of crude projects women, cellphones
poised over barking mouths, fleas
biting my shame for them and for
me so infestested, horny for the blood
of Isabel. The cat slinks across
the carpet to me, watches me with
a plaintive sigh. She, too, slips
across the mesh sequestered and
soft, a puerile lollipop, when all of
Renee apart is tart tongue dictation,
some translation of breath thumb-nail'd
and aimed straight for you, to
lie over her face and shield her
from this dumbness in me.
I've always wanted to be light.
My horrible injury subjects me.

dear all, forwarding this on behalf of steve tomasula...

best,

joe

----------------------------------------------------------------------------=
---

I'm writing to invite you to attend &NOW, a festival of contemporary
writing to be held at the University of Notre Dame, April 5-6, 2004.
Run as a small conference, the festival is meant to be a very
eclectic gathering of authors, critics, and others who are interested
in writing as a contemporary art form -- that is, as a practice
engaged with its own moment and ideas in ways that that are often
more associated with contemporary music or visual art.

&NOW hopes to bring together prose and poetry writers, critics,
e-poets, mixed-media creators -- authors, critics, and students whose
work should be on the radar of others in their aesthetic community,
writers whose work moves in ways that are not always recognized by
the more mainstream, commercial presses.  Won't you join us and help
take stock of this other tradition?  You can find more information
about &NOW at

http://www.nd.edu/~andnow

but please -- feel free to contact me directly if you have any
questions or concerns=8A

Sincerely,
Steve Tomasula
&NOW Festival Coordinator

I'm too busy to get deeply into this, but there is plenty of reference
materials on the relationship between sports and the military, jingoism,
etc. stemming back to Ancient Greece, and forward to the Hitler, and Reagan,
Olympics, and George W. Bush owning a baseball team. You just have to look
at how sports teams act whenever we go to war. There is also scholarship on
the relationship between fascism and sports stadiums.

Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=iso-8859-1
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

Thank God Ulla's book is now available, says this happy atheist. Just thought
I'd let everyone know that yesterday I received my (author's) copies of the new
paperback of IRRESISTIBLE DICTATION: GERTRUDE STEIN AND THE CORRELATIONS OF
WRITING AND SCIENCE, from Stanford, almost exactly two years after the
hardcover was released. What was formerly prohibitive ($65) is now less
forbidding ($24.95, or if you do Amazon, with a 30% discount, $17.47). I'd love
to see reviews of both books, together. In any case, the phone number for
Stanford University Press's distribution center is 1-800-621-2736, should the
local Barnes and Noble have already run out. And for those of you who, through
no fault of your own, never registered the existence of IRRESISTIBLE DICTATION
(so much for the efficacy of titles), I'm enclosing a brief description, some
blurbs, and the urls of a couple of reviews. Please forward this notice to any
and all friends of yours and of Stein whom you think might be interested.

Thanks.

Steven

"Before Gertrude Stein became the twentieth century's preeminent experimental
writer, she spent a decade conducting research in both the leading
psychological laboratory and the leading medical school in the United States.
This book unearths the turn-of-the-century scientific and philosophical worlds
in which the young Stein was immersed and situates her in relation to such
figures as Emerson, William James, Alfred North Whitehead, and Ludwig
Wittgenstein. Just as scientists reconceived relations among neurons as a
function of contact or contiguity, rather than of organic connection, Stein
radically reconceptualized language to place equal weight on the conjunctive
and disjunctive relations among words.

A groundbreaking interdisciplinary study, IRRESISTIBLE DICTATION aims both to
explicate Stein's radically experimental compositions and to bring the radical
empiricist philosophical tradition into focus through the lens of her writing."

Coupla blurbs: Kate Stimpson: "IRRESISTIBLE DICTATION is dazzling, original,
and wonderful. A major work about Gertrude Stein and her radical creativity, it
also brings together literature and science in compelling ways. Steven Meyer
writes with lucidity, freshness, and authority, and I am very glad he has
written this book."

Bill Gass: "This groundbreaking book enters areas of Gertrude Stein research
that once were considered marginal, but now must be considered central. Steven
Meyer brings Stein back to science, reclaims her for good sense, and widens our
understanding of her no long peculiar originality."

Thanks, Mark.  That might be it, Tho there is always The Perils of
Pauline, which know nothing about except that it was  a runaway
success as, i think, a tear-jerker melodrama as Pauline protects her
virtue.

Comedy adventure melodrama silent film serial. Each episode ended with a
cliffhanger, and not all of the perils were sexual. It's actually pretty
entertaining.

Hello Everybody.
You are invited to the non-pollutionary, anti-institutionary, de-funerary,
un-incarceratory
COLLABORATIVE POETICS FESTIVAL,
hosted by Spare Room, FO A RM, and PWNW.

When: 7:30 pm, October 3rd    Suggested donation  $6
Where: Performance Works NorthWest   4625 SE 67th   Portland, OR   97206
What: An evening of (mostly) inter-/cross-disciplinary work by poets, dancers and other performers. Each performance will represent a certain climax in the varying collaborative processes of the presenters.
Who:   Amanda Deutch     Maryrose Larkin + Ashley Edwards    mARK oWEns
Chris Piuma     Lisa Radon + Tim DuRoche     Out Loud    Andy Kennedy
           Craig Hill + Joe Melior      Linda Austin, Jonathan Sielaff + Joseph Bradshaw
Bethany Wright + collaborators     David Abel     Chaosmosis
          and others.....
How: we'll see....

Bios:
David Abel works as an editor and bookdealer in Portland, after tenures in New York and Albuquerque. Recent performances include "Permanent Red" at the Modern Zoo (with Tim DuRoche), "Dr. Selavy's Dream" in the Richard Foreman mini-festival at Performance Works NW; and appearances with the sound poetry ensemble JJ MAD. For the Pacific Switchboard Seminar's Fluxus evening in May 2003, he performed a four-hour version of "Chutes and Ladders: A Word Event for mARK oWENs and Jackson Mac Low." A preliminary version of "St. Joseph's Book of Acts," a theater piece produced in collaboration with Creative Material Group, was presented at the Lord Leebrick Theatre in Eugene, Oregon, in May 2002. Recently published work includes the poem "Threnos," designed and sewn on a thirty-seven-foot ribbon by the artist Katherine Kuehn, and the long collage text "Conduction," which appeared in "Conduit," an exhibition catalogue devoted to the work of Anna Hepler.

Chris Piuma edits the online quasi-literary journal flim (www.flim.com), helps organize Spare Room, and is in a band called the Minor Thirds.

Out Loud started in April as a weekly anti-war poetry open mic, then somewhat
spontaneously turned into a team of readers. Our home base is at Pacific
Switchboard (on N. Albina at Blandena), but we started to "play out" in July
(First Thursday, Pioneer Courthouse Square, Last Thursday, Colonel Summers Park,
Dignity Village). We do several ensemble pieces, and each of us specializes in a
different solo genre or three. It's pretty much all anti-war, but we admittedly
treat with a diversity of wars. it is quite unbelievable in how many ways it
seems we are now at war.


Raised by feral poets in the streets of NYC from the ripe age of 11, Amanda Deutch now lives in PDX. Her work can be found on her floor, in her drawers and in Watchword Press, Artsy Mag, and the summer 2003 issue of Barrow Street. Her Chapbook the Subway Series can be found at St. Marks Books in NYC and La Palabra Cafe in Portland.

From the Palouse, Joe Melior and CraigHill will bring a dialogue between slam and sound poetry, between the raw and refined, the inexperienced and the experienced, the younger and the older. The dialogue will be exploratory, sometimes in harmony, sometimes dissonant, both elements listening and responding to each other. This will be Joe Melior's first performance outside of the Moscow-Pullman area. Crag Hill has published poetry in over one hundred literary magazines world-wide in the last twenty years and has performed his work throughout the Pacific Northwest, most recently at last spring's sound poetry festival in Portland.


Lisa Radon has performed at the Portland Experimental Music Festival, the Spare Room Sound Poetry Festival, PerformanceWorks Northwest's recent Richard Foreman Festival, the San Francisco Poetry Festival, and Lollapalooza. In 1998, she received a grant for the interdisciplinary performance of the multi-voice poem cycle, Five Feet High and Rising, performed in San Francisco and Santa Cruz, California. Her work has been anthologized, incorporated into libretto, and scrawled on a sidewalk near you. With Tim DuRoche, she co-curates the Rhizomatica Cabaret performance series at Pacific Switchboard.


Tim DuRoche is a jazz musician and writer living in Portland. Over the last decade he's appeared with  Jon Jang/James Newton and Beijing Opera artists Pan Yong Ling, Li Jin Ping, and Li Hong Mei, Cap'n Jack McDuff,  Frank Gratkowski, George Cartwright, and the late performance artist Stuart Sherman, as well as with such venerable left coast artists as Wally Shoup,  Damon Smith, Jim Knodle, Rob Blakeslee, Glen Moore, Doug Theriault, and Torsten Müller to name a few. He's recently been developing conceptual solo and duo projects with poets Lisa Radon and David Abel and choreographer-dancer Linda K. Johnson for Red 76's Ministry of Small Things at PCAC's Modern Zoo and is currently cultivating/curating projects for the upcoming city-wide Core Sample show in October. mARK oWEns has conducted audience participation poems in Argentina, Mexico, France and around the states. He is currently sweeping alphabets across town with a broom. mark_anypush@yahoo.com Linda Austin is the artist
 ic
 director of PWNW. She has been making performance for two decades: in NYC, Mexico and Oregon. Her cross-disciplinary performance piece Big Real premieres here at PWNW Jan. 30--two days after her 50th birthday. Joseph Bradshaw is co-editor if FO A RM magazine and a member of Spare Room. He organized the Collaborative Poetics Festival but he did not organize his apartment. Chaosmosis: (Michael Ricciardi + Ffej) Michael is an award-winning video artist [video
poetry] and multi-media performance poet [since 1992].
He is a former member of the Seattle National Slam
Team [1998] and has performed his unique blend of
spoken word/philosophy/art/sound at venues from
Boston, MA to Vancouver, B.C., and in festivals such
as 'Arts Edge', The Seattle Poetry Festival, and
Bumbershoot. He has been awarded grants for his unique
poetry projects, including the 'Teen Video Poetry
Project' [Special Projects Award, KCAC] and 'Future
For WORD' [Allen Foundation for the Arts], an
all-electronic exhibition of visual, experimental, and
new media poetry.

Ffej is a well-known sound artist and collaborator
in the Seattle Arts scene, He is the weekly
host/impresario of 'Cognitive Dissidents', a
long-running series of 'experiments in sound and
performance' at the Cafe Messiah in Seattle. Ffej was
a Jack Straw Foundation 'artist in residence' in 2000.
He has self-produced several CDs of original work and
has been featured on KEXP's [Seattle] 'Sonarchy'
showcase. Additionally, he is the organizer/producer
of numerous arts projects including the 'Bubble
Rally', a growing art/music/bubbles event held every
August at Volunteer Park [Seattle].

Certainly so. It was just the "always" that brought the red flag up. Not
much militarism, I'd guess, in one of Behrle's celebrated wiffle outings. No
end to the kinds of human endeavor tied to nefarious purpose.

Brain:

I'm too busy to get deeply into this, but there is plenty of reference
materials on the relationship between sports and the military, jingoism,
etc. stemming back to Ancient Greece, and forward to the Hitler, and Reagan,
Olympics, and George W. Bush owning a baseball team. You just have to look
at how sports teams act whenever we go to war. There is also scholarship on
the relationship between fascism and sports stadiums.

Brian:

I meant, thanks for pointing out the 'always,'
which you're right to point out as wrong.

Gary Snyder once said to me, "Why can't you get it right the first time?"
The Beat fantasy of spontaneous correctness. I can't do this. (Neither could
he.)
I correct and correct and correct. When I say, "It's finished," chances are
there'll be more corrections. There is no final word.
 And where the writer's work ends, the critics' work begins. Or the
translator. Or the publisher makes "typos."
Even what is "right the first time," may then be misread---is the cant the
brain.

Best,
Joel

I always like the threads about what people are reading.  Thanks for
continuing it and turning me on to so many books I didn't even know
about.

As for Carla Harryman's play, Kasey Mohammad and Travis Ortiz have
both weighed in about it, I will too.  There's a lot to admire about
this play, and I urge everyone to see it, not that we in the Bay Area
haven't been hectored enough about going to see it, it's worth it and
how!  And, it's the last weekend to get the chance.

The main four actors, who I take it play the parts of three
characters, or objects (in Harryman's text for three voices it is up
to the director of each production to choose how many actors should
play them), have been rehearsed to razor sharp exactitude by Jim
Cave.  These actors, who have professional resumes and everything,
stand in even sharper contrast to a raggle-taggle group of poets who
get to speak the chorus parts.  The energies of the two kind of
"acting" are completely disparate and bump into each other in all
sorts of fascinating ways.

The play is what I think of as "fluidly" staged, with a maximum of
running around and striking attitudes that serve to underline
Harryman's words.   Occasionally, as a sentence ends, the actors
freeze and the lights change in some portentous way, according to the
conventions of the cinema.  Then the objects start moving again and
we are in for a sea change between naturalism and a heavily-weighted
symbolism.  I had the feeling that the actors were a bit at sea
trying to maintain the "thread" of the "characterization," and
sometimes wound up popping out their eyes keeping up with all the
language that they were called on to present "theatrically."  By the
way, via the difficult indeed daring method of addressing the
agonistics of race and class in America, Harryman has I think
produced what must be her best text--open, warm, strikingly
autobiographical, reflective and certainly generative; I'm looking
forward to its publication.

People in the Bay Area can go tonight, or Friday or Saturday, but on
Friday you should go to see Yedda Morrison at Small Press Traffic.
She is a brilliant poet whose first book "CROP" has just come out
from Kelsey St. Press.  The actors of Carla's play will be playing
just as brilliantly on Saturday.  Yedda will only be reading just the
one night, and also she will be joined by another of my favorites,
Kim Rosenfield all the way from NYC.  I'm sure Yedda is nervous as
beyond preparing for this reading she is about to take on another
great theatrical challenge, playing epochal body artist Kiki Smith in
my new play "The Smith Family" due in November.

That's enough from me for now.

Kevin K.

I walked from Times Square to St. marks Book Shop a couple nights ago.
Stopped in at Gotham, but they close at 6:30, and the man said I'm sorry
but we close at 6:30.  A nice blond guy.  Walked thru the city, and saw
Bush's motorcade.  Police, and barricades all over the place, and the
city in gridlock due to all the traffic restrictions.  I was staying out
of town and had taken a train in.

There were so many Starbucks houses!  There were more Starbucks even
than there were McDonald's especially as I approached the Village.  Are
there more Starbucks' than McDonalds' now in Manhattan?  I thought of
Kazim Ali's equation of the company with the sensible materialist on
board the Pequod.  I also thought of Kazim as I stepped through Times
Sq. and looked up at the massive ads to find the woman doing yoga, but
she wasn't up there.  I can never figure out what anybody is selling.
My attention span is too long.  I need time for my brain to function.
In all those flashing lights nothing enters my mind.  I can't even
remember anything but the glare, and a huge Cadillac front that was
built possibly to advertise Cadillacs.

St. Marks' Books I bought some books on cities, and then I got
Benjamin's The Origins of German Tragic Drama.  I am also reading
Luther's Small Cathechism, King John by Shakespeare (it's getting better
in Act IV), and next up is King Henry VIII, which is the only history
that I've never read.  I want to see a whole host of things in the books
-- how he treats the ideas of matriarchy-patriarchy, how he treats
legitimacy (bastards are everywhere), and I'm tracing the goddess Diana
throughout the histories -- as I'm interested in ocular imperialism and
how Diana treats Actaeon after he is caught with his eye to the
peephole.

Poking along reading Mairead Byrne, rereading Edwin Denby's sonnets,
some books on Reformation History by various church scholars of
different stripes.  Also reading a kind of self-help book called the Art
of Time, by Jean-Louis Servan-Schreiber.  He's the publisher of
L'Expansion, a leading French business magazine.  The book sold a half
million copies in France, and was sent to me by a French Lacanian shrink
that I met when he was a mime outside the Pompidou.

I tried to read a book called Paris Sewers and Sewermen, but it bogged
down in a long discussion of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.

I saw weird new glossy magazine in NYC yesterday called KARMA.  It is
all high fashion shots of S&M poses seemingly, with nipples bared, and
men in submissive positions before all kinds of goddesses.  I couldn't
figure out its tendency -- sex, certainly, but with women on top, and
then it seemed to have an underground feel, but with Buddhism positioned
as some sort of redeeming feature.  I looked at in a coffee shop at the
base of the Empire State Building while my Finnish nieces went to the
top to have a look-see and I stayed down and fed quarters into the
parking meter.

One thing I can say for Bush -- he's not Hamletian.  He does what he
thinks needs doing, and without much reflection.  At first I found this
refreshing, I have to admit.  There was however in Times Square a
massive number on top of some building that was flying forward in terms
of the National Debt.  Every family now owes 75,000 dollars.  I guess
because he's not collecting enough taxes and keeps wanting to rebuild
the non-christian world with our money?  Is there a better way (cheaper)
to neutralize the danger from Islamic fundamentalism?

table will be listed in promotional material, both in print and online, =
for the 2003 B.I.L.L.

Hey everyone

a friend of mine in New York City, Brice
Rosenbloom, is trying to put together a program at
the Lincoln Jazz Center which, as far as I can
gather, is a kind of historical survey of poets or
spoken word artists who have worked with jazz

There was a lengthy sequence of emails within the Kenneth Patchen list =
on the subject of Patchen's available, unavailable and rumored-to-exist =
albums with jazz musicians. Contact patchen@yahoogroups.com -- someone =

Hey everyone

a friend of mine in New York City, Brice
Rosenbloom, is trying to put together a program at
the Lincoln Jazz Center which, as far as I can
gather, is a kind of historical survey of poets or
spoken word artists who have worked with jazz
musicians -- preferably well-known jazz musicians,
like Mingus with Hughes, etc. -- and he's looking
for names and/or known recordings that he can
check out as he goes about programming the event.

I had of course thought of people like Jack
Kerouac and Kenneth Rexroth, both of whom have
recorded albums working with musicians -- but does
anyone know of other existing recordings in that
same vein, or that perhaps push the envelope even

I'm trying to re-locate the review of a group pop show, in Paris, that
Ashbery did, in either ART NEWS or ART INTERNATIONAL (probably!).  It's the
one in which he contrasts Warhol (positively) to the other artists in the
show, about a painting by one of whom, of a Hires rootbeer can, he says
something like "are we supposed to love Hires rootbeer, or hate it, or hate
ourselves for loving it? whichever it is, these polemics need a retread."
versus Warhol, whose work, he says (more or less) "engages our time" (that's
not quite right) and "is not just a mean reflection on it."

the piece is NOT in REPORTED SIGHTINGS . . .

thanks!

Welcome to Adventure!! Would you like instructions?
You are standing at the end of a road before a small brick building.
Around you is a forest.  A small stream flows out of the building and
down a gully.
You have walked up a hill, still in the forest.  The road slopes back
down the other side of the hill.  There is a building in the distance.
The road, which approaches from the east, ends here amid the trees.
You are wandering aimlessly through the forest.

You're at end of road.

Sorry, I don't know the word "CHILD".
Sorry, I don't know the word "PERCEPTION".
You are wandering aimlessly through the forest.
At your feet all the water of the stream splashes into a 2-inch slit
in the rock.  Downstream the streambed is bare rock.
You are in a 20-foot depression floored with bare dirt.  Set into the
dirt is a strong steel grate mounted in concrete.  A dry streambed
leads into the depression.
The grate is locked.
You are wandering aimlessly through the forest.
You're outside grate.

Kirby, may be you can give us an idea on how to neutralize the danger and
huge expense (read "deficit" and "war") from Judeo-Christian fundamentalism?

(Or maybe even ask yourself if the the term "Islamic fundamentalism" may be
considered a dangerous conflation of multiple branches of Islam - 1.2
billion folks - some of whom may or may not be fundamentalist or strictly
orthodox -  and with (at least once) big majorities with no desire to be in
any way associated with the terrorist practices of Osama & company. Or to
have you or any of us in the Occident speak with any authority about their,
I suspect, highly diverse political and other views).

Sorry, I don't see no poetry - in fact I see danger, expensive danger - in
knee-jerk "catch-all" judgments.

"Islamic fundamentalism" is at least as ironic a term
as "Hindu fundamentalism"--in both cases there's no
actual "fundament"!

(Well in actuality, I guess it's truer to say of
Hinduism "no actual 'fundament'"--there are
"fundaments" aplenty in Islam, it's just that each
group (Sufi, Shi'a, Sunni, Wahabi, etc.) thinks it's
them that's the "fundament".)

Joel, I enjoy your reflection on 'getting it right the first time." I had a
perhaps similar experience with the Zen Master of Kitkitdizzee and you may
find a story about it, "Down from the Mountain," in my book od stories,
"Men, Women & Vehicles." Black Sparrow being no longer Black Sparrow, I
dunno if they have it in stock, but if you punch me up on Google, there'd
folk selling it for half off.
          Yours, thinking twice or I forgot to count, David B.

Among contemporaries, there's Barry Wallenstein (also an incredible scholar
of this field), Steve Dalachinsky, Mikhail Horowitz and yours truly, a
longtime collaborator with the late & legendary saxophonist Thomas Chapin.
Jack Foley does some outstanding work with free jazz on the west coast.
Allen Ginsberg's The Lion For Real uses some of his shorter poetry in
collaboration with musicians and composers from the NYC downtown scene.
Kenneth Rexroth and Langston Bugles were among the pioneers of the idiom in
the 1930's. Jayne Cortez is also excellent. To do it well, a poet has to
have a strong musical sensibility.

Correction. That was Langston Hughes, not Bugles. My spellchecker caught me
half-asleep.

I'm sure that Creeley has done some jazz collaborations but I can't =
remember
the musicians involved. In fact, I'm sure I read an interview with =
Creeley
on the web some time ago in which he discusses this very issue...

Also, Steve Lacy set some Judith Malina and Steven Beck poems to music. =
I
can't say I actually recommend them, though they do stick in you(my) =
head
for days. I think you can hear a few songs on epitonic.com

By the way, Vernon, is Mikhail Horowitz the same as Michael Horowitz, a
British poet? At least I think that's his name. He read a few poems a =
few
years ago at an Allen Ginsberg memorial (yes, they really had one... =
even
Phillip Glass attended) in London that I remember liking but that got =
forced
to the back of my mind after hearing Anne Waldman perform.=20

You should seek out the collaborations between John Tchicai and Yusef
Komunyakaa... a recording that comes to mind is "Love Note From The
Madhouse". Very successful because Tchicai's musical sensibility, including
his approach to composition, in which the theme often appears at the center
of the works, allowing the poem to be freshly introduced. Tchicai is very
accessible and open to collab. from virtual unknowns (even little Jerry
Schwartz).

Then there's all that wondrous stuff Cecil Taylor does in and around his
playing.

And. not to be left out, hasn't Wanda Phipps made considerable contributions
on the topic?

Tchicai also did a piece w/ Ono and Lennon which
appears on their album "Life With the Lions:
Unfinished Music #2"

Ono also worked with Ornette Coleman, a recording of a
rehearsal tape for Ono's show 'AOS' appears on her
album "Plastic Ono Band"--I know she did a series of
concerts with OC but I don't know if they are recorded
or available.

Okay, now you're being silly. Let's reserve judgment on someone's place in
history at least until they're pickled and planted, or scorched and
scattered, hmm?

Except Warren Zevon. I gained so much respect for him when I found out the
rubbing-in-pot-roast episode from "Excitable Boy" was something he
actually did.

Ive seen Roscoe Mitchell do a few things with poets, not sure if
anything made it to record.  Art Ensemble of Chicago too.  & the few
times I saw Sun Ra he was definitely channelling text from the
otherside, of a "poetic nature".  I have to confess that often times
with poetry & jazz I find the experience much more enjoyable if I treat
the poetry as music, otherwise I tend to get milked by the poet's
sincerity.  In my ideal world the sincere ones would be reading with
musical accompaniment by Peter Broetzman, or any of the other noisy
cats.

-----Original Message-----

HI Ben

I've used up my two posts for the day, so I'm backchanneling.

To answer your question, Mikhail Horowitz is definitely not the same =
person
as Michael Horowitz. Mikhail is a longtime resident of Woodstock, NY =
who's
performed at the Village Gate and the Bottom Line. Apparently people =
have
confused the two for decades. If you meet Mikhail personally, or catch =
his
act of jazz & comedy, there's no mistaking him for anyone else.

Best,

Vernon
-------------
And my no frills value comment on the second post of the day:

Fancy Steve Lacy working with Creeley! No chance of getting the Lp =
though. I
haven't even seen a player in years.

Anyhow, I'll second Miekl's call for collaboration with Peter Brotzman =
et
al. I wonder how mixing that sort of music with something like =
Bernstein's 1
-100 would sound..=20

Finally, Amiri Baraka I know has done quite a bit with jazz. More =
recently
he's read with accompaniment from DJ Spooky (the guy who mixed =
Xenakis!).

Hi Stephen,

Based on your argument I wouldn't know what Judeo-Christian fundamentalism would
be.

Moonlight is spread evenly throughout civilization.

By this word fundamentalism I meant Osama, and the estimated 40,000 men who have
been through his terrorist training camps.  But then I just read Farnoosh
Moshiri's book The Bathhouse -- set in Tehran after a fundamentalist (she uses
the word) takeover -- I believe it's when the hostages were taken during
Carter's administration in 1979 or so.  The most curious detail is that they
raped the young girls before killing them so that they would go to hell (she
uses the word hell).

This word fundamental is pretty difficult to define.  I think that it means that
unless you're with us, you're against us.  But the principle of inclusion is
hard to define.  In the Moshiri novel (she's an Iranian liberal who teaches
somewhere in Texas) you have to say that you can clearly see the face of the
Great Leader (Ayatollah Khomeini?) on the moon.  If you do that, you join the
killers, and are no longer killed, but this means you have to stone the people
who can't see the leader's face clearly inscribed on the moon.

Can you define Judeo-Christian fundamentalism?

Moonlight is spread evenly throughout civilization.

God, I love John Tchicai! In the 60s my two Chihuahua dogs, who
adored the furthest out Coltrane, would whimper and run from the room
when I put on Tchicai.

Also comes to mind: an issue of ShuffleBoil from about a year back. Packed
with great jams.

And then there's Steve Swell, working all the time with poets, as well as a
dynamite poet himself.

We're lucky here in Rochester, because all of these.... Tchicai... Swell...
Joe Fonda... Triage... even the Doctor himself, Eugene Chadbourne (with his
dobro-Ellington-Hendrix bag-of-tricks)...  have passed through here in the
last two years... free shows at the Bop Shop Atrium. Happy feasting indeed.

 You are missing the point, Toby. At least what I hear from you - and
repeated in your response - is blatant and a very dangerous bigotry. If you
can't realize that, I am sorry and I think its regrettable that you want to
perpetuate it. I personally do not want to see this country or any other
country or any persons be caught in the ugly wheel of it. That's why I
called attention to what you said.

Other than saying that I don't want to argue, define or whatever.

"Fundamentalist" came into being when in 1915 a group of conservative
evangelicals gathered at a conference in response to Church Modernism,
Social Gospel and other liberal trends.  At the conference they affirmed
certain "fundamentals" of Protestant Christianity, such as biblical
literalism and virgin birth.   After the conference they issued a series of
tracts called "The Fundamentals" elaborating each of their points.  Hence
"fundamentalism."  It is completely inaccurate to term politicized Islam or
settler-nationalist Judaism or sectarian Hinduism "fundamentalist."  They
all share certain characteristics, namely a profound intolerance for
different positions within their own traditions, not mention other
religions; they all aspire to political power and governments and laws
formed according to their interpretations of their own
scriptures.  Interestingly, they all claim ancient lineage and the
authority of reviving original principles, they are all new trends (in the
last 100 - 200 years, which is new in terms of religion), they are all
responses to modernism of one sort or another.  Of course, popular usage
makes all the distinctions irrelevant: no matter what, people will call the
Muslem Brothers "fundamentalists."

Dear Hilton Obenzinger,

This is quite a useful and interesting post.  Can you tell me where this conference
took place?  Did it have a name?  I haven't heard of this before and would like to
look it up.

Could you also tell me if there are any groups WITHIN the Muslim tradition who call
THEMSELVES fundamentalists?  Would Bin Laden or his group Al-Qaeda try to get the
inside track by saying that their values were the fundamental ones and all others
were perversions, and would they therefore try to get the upper hand by calling
themselves fundamentalists?  I think among leftists in this country the word has a
lot of dirty associations, but among other groups, it may not, and may even have
positive connotations.  Is there any Islamic group for whom the word would have a
positive meaning?

Also, are there Christian groups today who still abide by the charter made in 1915,
and who refer to it either in public, or within their own organization, and use it
as a guiding constitution?

just wanted to let you know of our next show at the Make-Out Room
On September 28th...

We'll be playing with LOS HALOS (from my old "stomping ground" of
PHILADELPHIA, PA)
and PINE MARTEN (from Portland)

We will be playing a quieter and slower set than previously as well as
unveiling some new songs for the occasion (in addition to some from
our new album EXILE IN BABYVILLE)

It'd be great to see you....
(this will be our last show until November 14th
as we will be concentrating on other projects...Pete's other band, Good For
You, will be having a CD release party in October and
Chris will be doing a poetry reading at 21 Grand at which his new chapbook
of poems will be available)

The Make-Out Room is located at 3225 22nd St., SF, CA. (half a block east of
Mission...2 1/2 blocks from the 24th St. Bart Station).

I'll have to get back to you on the details, such as the place of the
conference, since I'm writing from memory and my books are elsewhere.  I do
know that the "fundamentalist" trend pre-dates this conference, starting
with a conference on biblical prophecy held in Niagara Falls in 1878 (the
series of conferences were called the Niagara Conferences since most of
them were held there).  At these conferences the interpretations of the
Book of Revelation and other texts emerged that has become characteristic
of most contemporary fundamentalists, including the idea of dispensational
premillennialism (that the Bible divides up history into dispensations, and
that Jesus will come again BEFORE [hence "pre"] the millennium, and we are
living in the dispensation before the end-days).  Most of today's
"fundamentalists" do not use that term because of its association with
anti-scientific thought, preferring "Christian evangelical" or
"Conservative evangelical" or other terms (not all evangelicals are
fundamentalists), but they still adhere to the same principles.  Plus many
of the folks who we might consider "fundamentalists" are divided between
pentacostalists who value the immediate presence of the Holy Ghost
(speaking in tongues, faith healing, etc.) even over the bible and other
denominations who value biblical literalism more.

I suspect that only Moslems living in the West who know the term in English
would use it.  In Muslem countries there are different trends and sects,
such as Wahabiism in Saudi Arabia or the Moslem Brotherhood in Egypt or
Hamas in Palestine.  Most of these trends in the different religions
involve an assertion that the original, pure religion is being restored
when in fact major religious concepts are being revised.  They also aspire
to political power.  Jewish religious settlers on the West Bank, for
example, have woven in an extreme nationalism into Jewish thought that did
not exist before.

All of these trends are complex, and while I am generalizing somewhat, they
all need to be regarded seriously and in their particularity in terms of
theology and politics.

The best poetry &jazz recording i have ever heard is
SONNY'S TIME NOW (the old Jihad label from Newark)
Sonny Murray & Don Cherry and others with "Leroi Jones"
on one side
the other is among the best Free Jazz i know, wild, intense, angry,
ecstatic--
Don Cherry also recorded with Ginsberg on a number of of the Blake lps--and
saw them perform these
there's also the boxed set of ESALATOR OVER THE HILL--Gertrude Stein pieces
set to music with Cherry, Carla Bley, etc etc etc
Linton Kwesi Johnson the Dub poet is massive, heavy live
have seen/heard many Punk bands do Rimbaud lyrics--the Patti Smith & Richard
Hell influence--
a live recording is being released soon of Ginsberg performing with the Punk
band the Black Holes, Milwaukee, 1990--he also recorded with the Clash and
the Gluons ("Bird Brain" & "Sue Your Parents")
since the 1980's Michael Moynihan with groups Coup de Grace, Blood Axis and
others has recorded industrial, Celtic and orchestral music with lyrics of
Trakl, Nietzsche, Owen, Verlaine and others--

-- Kirby Olson

Or: Is there a better way to neutralize fundamentalism? Of which "Dubya"
is a prime example?

I think there are many. We could start with our own country, as he (W.)
would say, "for starters." We could, say, provide health care for all
our citizens, and affordable education. And stop trying to take over the
world.

The more one judges the less one loves--Balzac
Who is the bravest hero? He who turns his enemy into a friend--Hebrew
proverb

as small children, my brother jed and i thought that the word fundamentalism
meant "fun-da-mentalism"
it was related to the word "wreck creation"--recreation--which jed had
misunderstood and been thrown out of a summer kindergarten for
fun-da-mentalism was some mysterious activity in which one had fun with the
mentalism--acting in a sort of Ubuesque way--
we also wondered iif it had to do with fund-da-mentalism--something like
money for schoolsand so forth--
fundamentalism is not found only in religion as such--it extends to all
forms of activity--including the arts, poetry, etc etc--
when i first encountered Langauge Poetry for example i thought of it as a
form of fundamentalism--the extreme purification of the "material word"--and
its attendant theoretical discourse and practices--its ability to make use
of fund-a-mentalism in the sense of its spread through the academies--in the
ongoing period of "political correctness" which is a form of ethical
fundamentalism--the emphasis on the word as correct, that by emphasizing the
word, thought is altered, behaviour altered--back to an elevation of
language as the Word--and hence to the importance of the word being
"correct" in the sense of its eradication of the "bad objects"--of a
previous ignorance--the Word that needs to be brought to the unaware--
i found it interesting that it began in roughly the period that a born again
christian was president--jimmy carter (who would quote the poetry of dylan
thomas and the lyrics of bob dylan--at that time a born again christian
himself--)--
and that it has continued into the present, with yet another born again
president--
by this i mean that a culture across the board in its practices and
discourses can be caught up in various fundamentalisms, purifications,
judgements, the occupying of various positions, terrains, fundings, modes of
thought and action--
seen seperately, they seem to be at loggerheads with each other, yet viewed
as the developing historical and cultural practices, discourses, attitudes,
deployments in daily life--
they are of a part, a direction, in which all are caught up in one way or
another--
a continual process of judgement, of the pitting of various interests
against others--
in the process, of fundamentalisms inthe usa and in so many other coutnries,
whole socieities are uprooted, destroyed, thrown into ever deeper poverty,
illness, criminalization, despair, hatreds,mobilizations--all a chaos into
which the Word of the One may be installed as an Order that is felt to be
demanded--

where i live in the west central  city of milwaukee--people wonder--why the
war in Iraq, to create a chaos which needs to have now 87 billion more us
dollars pumped in (so that oil may be pumped out--)--
when the chaos is here--ignored all along--
and what does one do, to find ways out--
without becoming what one beholds?--
---not to become another fundamentalist!--
that is daily life--a continual--struggle amongst this--

David:

I just read it and laughed many times. Heard about the conch horn but never
saw it. Great story!

We parted company around 1980, when I wrote to him and thanked him for
having been one of my teachers--he had had a powerful influence on the
direction of my life and work--, but it was time for me to be my own man. As
you know, you either sit around his fire or he gives you the cold shoulder.
The ego is not what's enlightened. That takes maturity, a different, though
complimentary, path.

Who is Paul Skald based on?

Best,
Joel

I haven't heard Lacy's _Futurities_ (settings of Creeley) but I'm quite fond
of Steve Swallow's settings of Creeley, which are on an album called _Home_.
They're sung by Sheila Jordan, very nicely; the singing doesn't take up a
lot of the tracks, which is a pity (considering how good a singer she is)
but no-one's going to complain about the solos from a band that has David
Liebman, Richie Beirach, &c in it. -- Lacy's work for voice has often been
maligned because people don't like Irene Aebi, but I've enjoyed some of
those records; for instance, the two pieces on _Bye-Ya_, including the Tom
Raworth poem, are excellent.  Less good is _Vespers_, which has nice music
but boringly texts.

Nathaniel Mackey's _Strick_ is very good. -- Mike Westbrook has done a lot
of settings of poetry, but I've never really gotten that excited by his
work.  The Blake disc _Bright as Fire_ is pretty good, if a bit dated, at
least once you get past the children's choir on the few couple tracks (gag).
It includes a brilliantly demented setting of "A Poison Tree".

Actually the best jazz/improv+spoken word disc I've heard isn't poetry: it's
Phil Minton's _Mouthfull of Ecstasy_, which uses texts from _Finnegans
Wake_.  It's not jazz, nor improv, nor settings--it's a genre unto itself, &
very much worth hearing.

all best --N

An early notice for a reading I've put together:

*

Trevor Joyce, Steve McCaffery, Lise Downe

October 26th, 3:00pm
New Works Studio, 319 Spadina, 2nd floor
Toronto, Ontario


For his first visit to Canada, Irish poet Trevor Joyce, author of _with the
first dream of fire they hunt the cold: A Body of Work 1966-2000_, will be
reading alongside two of Toronto's finest writers, Steve McCaffery (the
diversity and scope of whose output can be sampled from his monumental
two-volume selected poems, _Seven Pages Missing_) and Lise Downe (author,
most recently, of _Disturbances of Progress_, from Coach House).

Hope to see you there!

Excerpt from Implexures
Molecules might not have been as confused as I thought probable, the two
from the northern hemisphere less seven and a return to places in it for all
three within half those years. The dog was quarantined. So to Saxon Doom
from Norse Lag always defying definition as many marriages attest. Elsewhere
(the word emblematic of my vocabulary) other photographs were taken, letters
direct us to “Mc or Mac” no longer prefixed island surnames. In the Sudan
the Anwar Dam covers the spot exactly (planes had propellers then) and figs
greeted us to so many palms.
The disappointments of a generation skewed by cynicism or performance mean
the wars inhabit some individuals on an ongoing basis and not only those of
the twenty-first century. Cousins married each other more often than not, an
act perhaps “devastating to humour.” Recognize the ache for what it is,
reside there, not knowing opinions, hear a rosary of sunsets with the bells.
Disowned as much for himself as her English one. (One false step beyond the
Cliffs of Moher into the fog and so to sea.)
For these are the characters — sense of direction, observed movements, “time
of our lives.” The tableaux run through themselves. To absorb a history of
family through the centuries requires a forebear’s attention to facts and no
fear of paper. Remember this. The nights are a time of chosen light, days an
elaborate grafting.

>David Abel works as an editor and bookdealer in Portland, after tenures in
New York and Albuquerque. Recent performances include "Permanent Red" at the
Modern Zoo (with Tim DuRoche), "Dr. Selavy's Dream" in the Richard Foreman
mini-festival at Performance Works NW; and appearances with the sound poetry
ensemble JJ MAD. For the Pacific Switchboard Seminar's Fluxus evening in May
2003, he performed a four-hour version of "Chutes and Ladders: A Word Event
for mARK oWENs and Jackson Mac Low." A preliminary version of "St. Joseph's
Book of Acts," a theater piece produced in collaboration with Creative
Material Group, was presented at the Lord Leebrick Theatre in Eugene,
Oregon, in May 2002. Recently published work includes the poem "Threnos,"
designed and sewn on a thirty-seven-foot ribbon by the artist Katherine
Kuehn, and the long collage text "Conduction," which appeared in "Conduit,"
an exhibition catalogue devoted to the work of Anna Hepler.

>Chris Piuma edits the online quasi-literary journal flim (www.flim.com),
helps organize Spare Room, and is in a band called the Minor Thirds.
>
>Out Loud started in April as a weekly anti-war poetry open mic, then
somewhat

>Switchboard (on N. Albina at Blandena), but we started to "play out" in
July
>(First Thursday, Pioneer Courthouse Square, Last Thursday, Colonel Summers
Park,
>Dignity Village). We do several ensemble pieces, and each of us specializes
in a
>different solo genre or three. It's pretty much all anti-war, but we
admittedly

>Raised by feral poets in the streets of NYC from the ripe age of 11, Amanda
Deutch now lives in PDX. Her work can be found on her floor, in her drawers
and in Watchword Press, Artsy Mag, and the summer 2003 issue of Barrow
Street. Her Chapbook the Subway Series can be found at St. Marks Books in
NYC and La Palabra Cafe in Portland.
>
>From the Palouse, Joe Melior and CraigHill will bring a dialogue between
slam and sound poetry, between the raw and refined, the inexperienced and
the experienced, the younger and the older. The dialogue will be
exploratory, sometimes in harmony, sometimes dissonant, both elements
listening and responding to each other. This will be Joe Melior's first
performance outside of the Moscow-Pullman area. Crag Hill has published
poetry in over one hundred literary magazines world-wide in the last twenty
years and has performed his work throughout the Pacific Northwest, most
recently at last spring's sound poetry festival in Portland.
>
>
>Lisa Radon has performed at the Portland Experimental Music Festival, the
Spare Room Sound Poetry Festival, PerformanceWorks Northwest's recent
Richard Foreman Festival, the San Francisco Poetry Festival, and
Lollapalooza. In 1998, she received a grant for the interdisciplinary
performance of the multi-voice poem cycle, Five Feet High and Rising,
performed in San Francisco and Santa Cruz, California. Her work has been
anthologized, incorporated into libretto, and scrawled on a sidewalk near
you. With Tim DuRoche, she co-curates the Rhizomatica Cabaret performance
series at Pacific Switchboard.

An excellent study of the roots fundamentalism in Islam, & of those =20
strains inside islam -- sufism, for one -- that have always fought =20
those reactionary formations, can be found in a book I recently =20
translated into English: Abdelwahab Meddeb, _The Malady of Islam_, =20
Basic Books 2003. Here's a general description of the book, qua blurb:

"In this impassioned, erudite, and deeply moving book, Abdelwahab =20
Meddeb, born and raised in Tunis and now living in Paris, details the =20=

breadth and scope of the Arab intellectual tradition and dismantles =20
common preconceptions held by the Islamic and Western worlds. He =20
describes the growing resentment between the West and the Islamic world =20=

as being due, in large part, to Islam's drift away from its own =20
pluralist tradition. Tracing the history of the "conquering" of the =20
Arab world by the West, he provides a detailed history of the ways in =20=

which Islamic fundamentalism has come to compensate for Western =20
dominance. Directly addressing the terrorist attacks of September 11, =20=

he challenges us to reconsider the presumption that the gulf between =20
the Islamic world and the West is too wide to breach.

The "malady" of Islam lies in its alienation from the West and the =20
corrosive influence that fundamentalism has wrought. This book is a =20
correction of the historical record, a passionate description of the =20
best of Islamic thought and culture, and an absolutely necessary read =20=

for those seeking a better understanding not only of Islam but also =20
ourselves."

   About the Author
  Abdelwahab Meddeb is a prolific novelist, poet, translator, and =20
essayist and the editor of the journal D=E9dale. The author of ten =
books, =20
he is Professor of Comparative Literature at the University of Paris =20
X--Nanterre. He lives in Paris, France.

  The two reviews on Amazon seem to be to be biased & uninformed. Still =20=

waiting for a serious critique of the book.

Pierre

                  LOUIS ZUKOFSKY


                    CENTENNIAL


June 16, 2004, will mark 100 years since the first date of James Joyce
and
Nora Barnacle, the day later immortalized in ULYSSES. Along with this
more
obvious anniversary, 2004 also marks another important centennial:
Louis
Zukofsky, one of the great modernist poets, was born January 24, 1904.
To
celebrate these two events, FlashPøint is planning a special issue
devoted
to Joyce and Zukofsky, to be issued in conjunction with Bloomsday next

spring.
To make this issue as full and rich as befits a tribute to Joyce and
Zuk,
FlashPøint - for the first time in its existence - is calling for
submissions to be considered for inclusion. Submissions may come in
many
forms: critical essays, bibliographical studies, personal reactions and

assessments, biographical information, anecdotes, poetic tributes, etc.
The
main criterion for inclusion is insight and 'sincerity' - to use
Zukofsky's
term - which means a level of rigor and intensity towards an
understanding
of these two figures and their works. Risk-taking seems appropriate for

papers on two artists who took many risks - all approaches considered.

Submissions and abstracts may be sent to:
flashpnt@hotmail.com

For further information, please contact the same email address.

DEADLINE FOR SUBMISSIONS IS: January 20, 2004.

Hi Highland -


Again I ask you -

Can you give examples of your programming here so we can understand the
structures you use?

Can you say something about the enormous quantity - and your emphasis on
quantity - of texts, editors, etc. at m.a.g. and on the lists?

Can you say something about the length of the posts?

Thanks, Alan

Hi Pierre, the malady of Islam sounds like it could be an insightful book.  I
will order it from Amazon today. Tunisia for whatever reason appears to be a
more moderate country than many -- I have no idea why this would be so.
Perhaps this author explains it.

btw, has anybody else ever been to Paris-Nanterre?  It's in a shocking
state.  Apparently the French government habitually slights the place in the
funding because of the uprisings of 1968 -- I went there to look at it about
two years ago -- it looks as if the walls haven't been washed in thirty years
or more.  There are slogans on the classrooms saying things like Vive Mao!
which look at least two decades old.  The bathroom toilets don't have doors,
and there is no paper.

Still some of the best critical thinkers in France work there.  Jean-Jacques
Lecercle, the best Deleuzian still going runs the English department, where
he works on Lewis Carroll and Edward Lear, among others.

I couldn't understand the larger neighborhood or the situation thereof
surrounding Nanterre due to time pressures.  It was a pleasant enough commute
from Paris -- twenty minutes or so -- but the filth in the buildings was hard
to believe especially after Finland where one can eat off the floors of any
public building.

I am looking forward to getting the Malady of Islam.  At least he admits
there is a problem.  I want to see his description and prescription.  I think
we can't just do nothing while little girls are having their heads blown off
for the crime of reading.  It's just too damned selfish to think of our own
needs, while other people don't even have basic human rights.  In the
southern Sudan Muslims are still practising slavery.  Like Harry Noodle, I
can't understand why poets aren't more upset, or why they are looking the
other way.  Is it too painful to recognize that Islam has become a malady,
that it is ill, and that the people there need help?

listening and responding to each other. This will be Joe Melior's first

I'm sending you some poems for consideration at Spoon River too.  (I'm sure

They hang the man and flog the woman
That steal the goose from off the common,
But let the greater villain loose
That steals the common from the goose.

Constant apprehension of war has the same tendency
to render the head too large for the body.  A standing military
force with an overgrown executive will not long be safe.

"America is a quarter of a billion people totally misinformed and disinformed
by their government. This is tragic but our media is -- I wouldn't even say
corrupt -- it's just beyond telling us anything that the government doesn't

the catch of hunches ruins the bass, the drafting, flagrant seize

growth involves segmentation - a
society grows to a certain size, it
reaches a threshold, and then splits

Minding the store, teflon man flounders, insubstantial
protective skin thinned than thought. Granted, he's not drowning,
not yet, but he's not calling for help. When you boil it
down, is finding the stone blinding the stare

In consequence
events I forget remember me
when I fell into the rising river
the dropped rainbow trout flew up in my hands
and I continued walking backwards

I'm wall and All-wary
like I'm shelf (prow casts)
taut greed not barrel
Pop canons as monies
fast bludgeon
fast late tresses

'time. And there it is.' With that decided,
she went through the book getting rid of
every instance of the word 'love,' so that
when it finally appears - at a moment it
would be mean to give away, and too elabo-
rate to explain anyhow - it jumps out at the
reader to maximum effect

I'm beginning to get a bit fed-up with the way this particular thing is
reappearing here there and everywhere.

Think redundancy.  Think vowels don't matter.  Think context.

Put the three together, and it makes sense.  Sneeze.

Clever, but trivial -- an example of misdirected energy.  What academics get
up to in their coffee-breaks.

Mind you, as an example of misdirected academic energy, try this one:

        http://www.the-tls.co.uk/this_week/story.asp?story_id=29022

That one, folks, is a right bummer.

I'm pretty sure it's a scam (the tone of the first and last sentences, and
the first recorded use of "Model" in the OED sense of 1b, among other
things) -- but jeezus, Stanley Wells not only signs it, he drew attention to
it on SHAKSPER.

So maybe it's true?

Why doesn't someone post something clever, like "Ten reasons I dislike the
way you strangle a blackbird."

7,200 works


We are members of the International Belles Lettres Federation and are
affiliated with the Worldwide Literati Mobilization Network and the
Superheroes of Humanities. Our literary work is presented by Culture
Animal, the brainchild of August Highland. The literary genre we produce
is called "Mediated Narrative Repatterning". We are influenced by the
work of Teddy Warburg, Paul Whitney and by the work of Digital E.Motions
and Go Ego Go.

The union of manware and software is achieved in our work in a way no
other software-assisted literature has been before. We have harnessed
the communication resource of computer programming and directed it with
absolute precision to produce literary work in which all chance and
randomization, all alleatory and improvized elements have been removed.
What we have done is re-created the art of storytelling in verse form,
applying techniques and tools that have not been available in any other
period in history. Mediated Narrative Repatterning has re-introduced
storytelling and free verse into a medium (software-assisted literature)
that has up to now produced only failed results in this area. By
mediating (manware) with binary programming (software) using our new
techniques, we repattern the narrative stream to provide storytelling
content to the reader, who is able to enjoy the content in the form of
verse, which is the form all traditional cultures before and after Homer
have always told the stories of their times.

The Academic Liberation Party is telling the story of OUR time, a time
of volatile relationships between man and his fellow man and between man
and his natural environment; a time of accelerated transition, in
communications, human relocation, technological innovation, scientific
discovery, and most importanly, the redefining of identity which is
critically changing the nature of human experience.

Will, Henry, Claire and I have written 7,200 unique stories in the free
verse style of traditional cultures, stories that tell what it means to
live in a world in which everything is shifting at tremendous speed that
is nearly as blinding as a sandstorm in the iraqi desert when winds blot
out the sky and all the colors in the world turn to white, and the only
map left for the individual is compassed by systole and diastole and and
the moist breath circling through his nostrils.

A year or more ago, I decided against accepting an invitation to submit to
m.a.g. b/c I read it as an elaborate joke. I didn't feel that the "real"
poets were being showcased in an honest environment. Until recently, none of
the editors was being forthcoming about the pseudonyms, even though they are
obvious to all. I guess I just don't feel like having my chain yanked, and I
assume many others have felt the same way.

But I've gotta admit, the energy you bring to the project is astounding,

Interesting discussion on jazz poets, Bremser, Kaufman, Joans, Rexroth & =
Kerouac being the heavies in my book.

Interesting to hear discussion of jazz poetics. What makes a jazz =
poetics? Sound over meaning would be the immediate knee-jerk response I =
guess but there are other poets who obviously did this (ahem) and =
weren't 'jazz' poets...lifestyle, attitude, black consciousness anyone?

In your mind what distinguishes jazz poetics from other forms of text &
audio such as sound poetry, opera ala kenward elmslie, or the endless
permutations of experimental audio / text collaborations.  Even within
jazz you have a lot of new music interpreters who aren't tied down to
swing, bebop, blues, or standards.  As usual Im interested in a
dialogue which defies categorization & style-mongering, not that your
question necessarily implies such.

Yes, will both Alan and August answer the question raised by Alan: <<Can you
give examples of your programming here so we can understand the
structures you use?>>
and my question, which I think may or may not be the same (if I've not
understood Alan's question):

Are you both using code that generates "poetry"?

There is an editorial in the m.a.g. that answers the question <<Can you say
something about the enormous quantity - and your emphasis on
quantity - of texts, editors, etc. at m.a.g. and on the lists?>> I believe
it is in the issue just previous to the current issue of the m.a.g.

Hi - I've given examples of the code constantly throughout - here is an
example in perl of one I've used recently. And the code is only a
catalyst; I'm not using anyone else's words, nor do I necessarily accept
what the code gives back - Alan

#!/usr/local/bin/perl5

while (<STDIN>) {
        @words = split /[\s]+/, $_;
        @spaces = split /[\S]+/, $_;
        for ($x=0; $x <= $#words; $x++) {
                $word_count{$words[$x]}++;
                if ($word_count{$words[$x]} == 1) {print $words[$x],$spaces[$x+1],$words[$x-8],"\n"}
                }
        }


As another example, here's something from awk, a program in unix which can
be used for fields and field substitution -

/[s]+/ { print "aimed his gun in my direction" }
/[v]+/ { print "born and later in 1967" }
/[y]+/ { print "but ghosts come always back and furious" }
/[g]+/ { print "coward, fearful of any" }
/[k]+/ { print "father in a healthier fashion, even the" }
/[z]+/ { print "from 1994 i buried my selves in selves" }
/[n]+/ { print "genre. why didn't other people tell" }
/[0]+/ { print "i'm tired of this" }
/[d]+/ { print "impetus against the wall of writing from which i" }
/[a]+/ { print "insanity everywhere in this world, among friends and" }
/[x]+/ { print "into this and every other" }
/[q]+/ { print "lake and the firefight was going" }
/[m]+/ { print "me what i was doing, i'd have been able" }
/[b]+/ { print "nonfictionally. i've seen far too much" }
/[c]+/ { print "now escape through others creatively" }
/[p]+/ { print "on above the cliffs or over" }
/[u]+/ { print "or sometime lost my" }
/^$/ { print "others. alan, she said, stop it." }
/[w]+/ { print "picture. in 1943 i was" }
/[j]+/ { print "rest of the family placing me in" }
/[i]+/ { print "the darkness of the hurtling" }
/[o]+/ { print "them. i didn't know better about" }
/[l]+/ { print "to work out the relations with my" }
/[e]+/ { print "unbearable. sexuality became a furious" }
/[f]+/ { print "violence and the tension is" }
/[t]+/ { print "virginity just about the time a soldier" }
/[r]+/ { print "when we were floating over the " }
/[h]+/ { print "world. i still live there; i'm a" }

Finally, here's a program in perl that I used a while ago - badly written
but did the trick -

response to Kasey Mohammad's September 27th blog
posting about Linda Pastan's "Love Poem" (on his
http://limetree.ksilem.com/)
-------------------------------------------------------


I've found myself quite preoccupied and bothered about
your roasting of Pastan, and, in spite of myself, have
written too many words in response,
----counter-arguments that I don't think would be
worthwhile for me to send, at the moment.

I do not share your reaction to her "content."  I feel
there's an archly female/feminine performance going on
in her rhapsodic excesses and persona, verging upon
the "gurlesque."

Questions of "quality" seem moot to me, and beside the
point at this stage of the game (decadence).  Pastan
---the only grounds on which I can imagine your attack
being justified--- is published by W.W. Norton. ---But
that, in short, then, becomes the real sub-text of
"quality": what apparatuses of ~power~ (W.W. Norton,
very definitely, and, at least in Houlihan's eyes,
Slope) are operative in determining the perpetuation
(perseveration) of these literary styles.

And today I find myself disagreeing with you, Kasey,
dear, over what you're treating as a critique of her
meter.  That may be the most important of the
different levels you come at this from, as it seems
the one you're most consistently returning to but
which you're continuously fleshing out the least.

It strikes me as a strange notion of meter that you're
invoking: "line breaks", ---but with no particular
sense of the ~lines~ themselves as (a locus of) meter.


(I used to re-read and re-read the annotations to
O'Hara's poems at the back of ~The Collected~, but it
escapes me at the moment which poem of his it was, if
there ever was one, that was written on a ~cocktail
napkin.~  [Perhaps Michael Magee has the answer, being
an O'Hara scholar.] It seems trivializing of O'Hara
and self-defeating to be reducing his virtuosity to a
caricature of a bar fly.)

The notion of "necessity" being behind
Williams'/Creeley's line-breaks seems sheerly mythic
to me (you mean, like, Greek fate ~anangke~
Necessity?).  (On the Poetics List, Andrew Rathmann
used to accuse the "post-avant" of lacking ~"emotional
necessity."~ What on earth are we doing looking for
eternal verities like Necessity, if the Saussurean
signifier that the whole "post-avant" is supposed to
be a testament to is itself arbitrary?) If you perform
the same parlor trick on Williams and boil his
lineations down to prose blocks like

"The harried earth is swept The trees the tulip's
bright tips sidle and toss--- Loose your love to flow
Blow! Good Christ what is a poet---if any exists?"

("The Wind Increases")

or

"As the rain falls so does your love bathe every open
object of the world--- In houses the priceless dry
room"

("Rain")

etc., ~no one~ is going to duplicate the way Williams
shaped it on the page, either, Kasey.

---Although this whole business of Silly Putty poetry
that can be tested by glomming it all down to prose to
curse it when it won't spring up into the same form
seems a terrible, erroneous foundation on which to
speak about meter.  That's like claiming some sort of
fallacy or flaw in a ~building~ because we can't
reenact how to put all its bricks back into the same
structure if they've been disassembled.  ("I'll huff
and I'll puff and I'll blow your poem down": the
criticism of House Built of Straw Poetry.)

You're able to attain your (verisimilitude or
simulacra of) conclusions only by, meanwhile, ~never
really looking~ at what Pastan's "Love Poem" in fact
does, metrically, or citing Williams, Creeley, or
O'Hara in any ~particular~ that would substantiate
your comparison or ---the risk your style of
argumentation avoids--- find it untenable and disprove
it.  Your sweeping generalizations, dear, are acting
as though it can be taken for granted that there's
some shared understanding here of what
Williams'/etc.'s meter and line-breaks ~were~ (!)
---which is by no means the case.  At least come up
with ~one~ specific example to help your case, please.

---Because ---although I think ~any~ poem would suffer
in direct comparison against Modern Olympians like
those and that that's an unfair and unrealistic
standard (she's the former poet laureate of
~Maryland,~ Kasey: that's like being the former poet
laureate of ~her own kitchen~)--- otherwise
unpersuaded by what's up until now all rhetoric
without evidence, Kasey, to the contrary, I find
Pastan's "Love Poem" holds up againt Williams on a
number of points:


I find, metrically, "line-break"-wise, that it was
reasonably clever and notable of her to splice apart
"we must grab / each other", "we must grab each /
other" and "we must / grab each other" a different way
each time.  And Williams does very much the same thing
in his poem "To a Poor Old Woman":

   They taste good to her
   They taste good
   to her.  They taste
   good to her

Pastan makes two lines an amphibrach followed by a
bacchic ( _ / _ | _ / / ), "so swollen / the runoff"
(I here read a secondary stress like the "-off" in
"runoff" as a full stress, rather than reading those
lines as a pair of amphibrachs)---and in Williams'
"Asphodel" alone the same amphibrach-bacchic couplet
can be found not once but ~twice~: "a challenge, /
your dear self", and "but love them? / The storm
burst" (pp. 144, 149, ~Selected Poems,~ New
Directions, 1969).

For Pastan's cretic followed by an anapest ( / _ / | _
_ / ), "after thaw / when we stand", Williams did
that, too: "Rather grasp / how the dark" ("To a
Solitary Disciple", p. 10) (immaterial whether to read
Pastan's as two cretics, as Williams' operates on the
same ambiguity of accentuation).

For Pastan's central anapest-amphibrach ( _ _ / | _ /
_ ), "we must grab / each other", Williams was there
first: "and the waves / are wakened" (again,
"Asphodel," p. 145). (Or is "grab each oth-" a
molossus?)

Pastan has a trochaic trimeter followed by a sort of
catalectic trochaic trimeter (missing its last
syllable) ( / _ / _ / _ | / _ / _ / ), "banks and
watch it carry / with it every twig", and, close
enough, Williams' "Asphodel": "Too, there are the
starfish / stiffened by the sea" (p. 45; although here
I'm reversing my earlier reading, and going with those
who hear the secondary stress in "starfish" as part of
a trochee, rather than a spondee).

Etc., etc.

Perhaps comically, though, I agree that Williams'
music is in general quite unlike Pastan's "Love Poem",
---which makes it all the more striking, maybe, that
so many of her "line-breaks"/lines have been in fact
already been legitimated as Thoroughly Modernist by
Williams.

The better comparison is to H.D., who wrote half her
oeuvre in the sort of narrow, minimalist, Skeltonic
meter Pastan's using there.  (If you'd like to hear
~eighteen~ H.D. lines sequences that are identical to
those in "Love Poem", just ask, I've got them right
here.  Something to share tomorrow.  I did it for
~you.~)

My point:

Here's how "Love Poem" scans:

_ / _ / _
_ / / _ / \
_ _ /
/ _ /
\ _ /
_ _ / _ _
/ _ / _ / _
\ _ / _ /
/ _ / / _ /
_ _ /
/ _ / _
\ _ / _
_ / _
_ / \
_ / _ / _ /
_ _ /
\ / _
_ / /
_ _ / \
/ _ _
/ _ /
/ _ /
/ \ / _

for starters.  (“\” signifies a secondary stress
[prone to be read by some as an unstressed].  “_” and
“/” are, obviously, unstressed and [primary] stress)

Now, what do you see that's "unjustified" in ~that?~


Love and a Happy 5764 to all,

I generally read neither blogs nor Linda Pastan, but this post made me
curious. Pastan lived up to my memory--this is a poem built on a
conceit--it appears to exist just to spin the thought out, which is another
way of saying that there's not much necessity driving it. It's a sort of
parlor game. Which I find offensive, having invested a great deal more than
that in the making of poems.

The conceit turns on a rather crude pathetic fallacy, and the danger of
getting one's shoes wet seems a bit pathetic, too. I assume it's supposed
to be funny.

Where Pastan publishes is relevant, to this extent: poetry this unambitious
wouldn't otherwise be a subject of conversation.

Sorry, Kasey, all I read on your blog was the poem. It was enough.

Mark

Hi all,

Our next issue of Boog City, the november one, will be the Brenda issue,
focusing on all sorts of folks, real and fictional, named Brenda, including
Lee, Walsh, Starr, Bordofsky, Coultas, Iijima, Shaughnessy, Weiler, Hillman,
and Kahn.

I was wondering if anyone would:

1) Review Brenda Coultas' "A Handmade Museum";

2) Review "The Grand Permission: New Writings on Poetics and
Motherhood," as Brenda Hillman is one of its editors;

3) Write on Brenda Walsh of 90210 fame and the I Hate Brenda craze started by
the Ben is Dead zine creators;

4) There's also the town of Brenda, Arizona, which seems worthy of some words;

and

5) Write on Brenda Starr, the first comic strip drawn by a woman, which also
had the first female protagonist.


Please backchannel me to editor@boogcity.com if you're interested or have other
Brenda suggestions and we can talk deadlines and word counts.

thanks,
david

The Muse Apprentice Guild, edited by August Highland is the largest,
most widely read international literary quarterly on the Internet, with
over
40 co-editors worldwide. Hundreds of thousands of readers turn it's
pages
every year. The current issue is the First Anniversary Issue and
presents over
700 writers and over 2,000 literary works, with special presentations of

readership has come to expect. Special features will include writers
from China,
Nepal, the Philippines, Macedonia, Montenegro, Bosnia, Croatia, Serbia,
and hundreds

*****************************

Banner Advertisements

Promotional banner advertisements are now being accepted by the MAG.
Banners are a nominal $10 a month per title and are placed in a random
rotation with other writers' banners. Banners appear on every page in
the MAG. For example, if in the current issue of the MAG there had been
ten writers with banners each writer would have had a 1 in 10 chance of
his/her banner appearing every time a visitor clicked on a page in the
MAG. This week over ten thousand pages were clicked on every day. This
means his/her banner would have appeared 1,000 times a day this past
week or 7,000 times for the whole week

Banners appear at the top of the page where the MAG header appears:

"the muse apprentice guild
--expanding the canon into the 21st century"

Only professional, stylish and unobstrusive banners are accepted.
Banners by Major Publishing Houses are subject to a higher fee.

*****************************

The MAG Awards

Money generated by banner advertisements will be used to fund the MAG
Awards.

Each year the MAG Awards will be held in San Diego, California. Awards
will be given in several categories:

These are some of the categories under consideration:

1. Most Innovative Poetry
2. Most Innovative Fiction
3. Most Innovative Drama
4. Best New Genre
5. Best Young Writer
6. Best Emerging Writer
7. Best Overlooked Writer
8. Life-Achievement Award


More information on the MAG Awards will be coming in the near
future. Look for updated announcements.

*****************************

Writers' Rights


August Highland is inaugurating a new department in the
Muse Apprentice Guild beginning in the fall issue. The
new department is called "Writers' Rights" and is devoted
to liberating writers around the world who are censored, persecuted,
imprisoned, tortured and murdered for exercising their freedom
through the printed word.

Countries that are already contributing to "Writers' Rights" include
Cuba, Japan and the Philippines.

If you would like to become involved in "Writers' Rights" contact
August Highland at the email address found at the Muse Apprentice
Guild Website.

CALL FOR PAPERS

POETRY STUDIES AREA
Popular Culture Association/American Culture Association PCA/ACA Conference
2004

As The Poetry Area Chair for the PCA/ACA Conference 2004, I have the
opportunity within the next month to organize a number of panels for The
Popular Culture /American Popular Culture Conference, which will be held in
San Antonia, TX  April 7-10, 2004.

The Poetry Studies Area of the Popular Culture Conference is interested in
paper abstracts on poets who have links to popular culture, past or
present. Also, we are very interested in panel proposals. Poetry and
Popular Culture is a vast undefined and open area. Your definition of
Poetry and Popular Culture will be respected.

Panels will consist of three or four individuals delivering papers, not to
exceed fifteen to twenty minutes. There will be a brief period at each
session for questions and conversation.

A loose definition of American (or Canadian or world) popular poetry is a
poetry involved or recognizing that that there is a poetry beyond the
sanctioned canon, an active poetry beyond academic networks, a readership
beyond a student body chained to a professor poet. Popularity is relative
when considering poetry. Who knows? So, anything goes!

Recall that Howl was on Lisa Simpson's bookshelf!

Possible topics: The Beats, Visual poetry, Concrete poetry, Spam-ku, Haiku,
Bush-ku, Charles Bukowski, Gerald Locklin, Lyn Lifshin, d a levy, Henry
Rollins, punk poetry, porn poetry, popular gay or lesbian poetry, zine
poetry, the underground press and underground poetry, e-zine small press
poetry, poetry networks, regional poetry, poetry in and as a popular medium
or poetry as popular entertainment, the little literary magazine etc.

In the past papers have addressed Charles Resnikoff, Charles Olson, Lewis
Carroll, Bob Dylan, Alternative writing in the south, Bob Kaufman,
Underground poetry in New Orleans in the 1960s, and the poetry of small
press poets like Gerald Locklin and Lyn Lifshin.  Your definition of
popular poetry is most welcome and so are your proposals.

This is a national and international academic conference and there are
registration fees etc., The PCA/ACA Conference is akin to the Modern
Language Association, American Historical Association and The American
Library Association conferences. Last year's conference featured more than
500 panels.

Complete and detailed information can be located at:
http://www.h-net.org/~pcaaca/2004/

If interested please send a brief paper abstract. ASAP. Deadline is
November 15, 2003.

I would be happy to address all questions.

Send proposals for panels and abstracts to:

Michael Basinski, Associate Curator, The Poetry/Rare Books Collection, 420
Capen Hall, SUNY at Buffalo, Buffalo, New York 14260
basinski@buffalo.edu

Please include your accurate/current addresses, phone number and email. All
accepted proposals will be furnished with further information concerning
conference registration, hotel accommodations and other pertinent
information.

There are slots available for those who wish to read from their own
creative work. Contact Marua Gage at: mgage@lsue.edu

As opposed to jazz poets, i.e. poets of the jazz age, the jazz poets
meaning Langston Hughes, Bremser, Joans, Kaufman, Kerouac, Rexroth and
probably quite a few others used a style that employed 'riffs'--going as
far as you could go with the line. Long breath, sound building on sound,
sound pyramid. I leave out Ginsberg, Corso because the former (for all the
supposed freedom of Howl, the poem does have an elaborate structure of
sorts) and Corso was bent from a mold a la Shelley, I think.

Was it forties Berkeley Spicer, Rexroth, Duncan with their salon building
up a new poetics? I included Langston Hughes although he referred to his
poems occasionally as 'blues' poems more often than not. Joans lived with
Bird and Kaufman's musings were not based on traditional rhyme meter per se
(although he oft quoted long passages of Yeats, Eliot, etc) but 'from the
ground up' organic, messianic riffs, building in intensity, meant to, of
course, be read aloud, provocation. Kerouac explained some of this too,
outlining things in many tracts. Incorporating the unintentional. Does this
fit into what Cage saw as modus operandi or vice versa?

Getting it right the first time would be stepping in the same river once;
i.e., it's never the same river, even the first time.

Joel, I enjoy your reflection on 'getting it right the first time." I had a
perhaps similar experience with the Zen Master of Kitkitdizzee and you may
find a story about it, "Down from the Mountain," in my book od stories,
"Men, Women & Vehicles." Black Sparrow being no longer Black Sparrow, I
dunno if they have it in stock, but if you punch me up on Google, there'd

Subject  poets and jazz

david et al.,

a few items come to mind that i don't think anyone has mentioned:

leroi jones reading "Black Dada Nihilismus" with the new york art
quartet accompanying (ESP 1004, numerous reissues)

archie shepp's "Malcolm, Malcolm, Semper Malcolm" from _fire music_
(impulse 158) and also on _on this night_ (impulse GRD-125); also "The
Wedding" from _live in san francisco_ (impulse 254) tho i think
"malcolm" is a much more powerful poem and performance

joseph jarman's "Non-Cognitive Aspects of the City" from _song for_
(delmark 410)

the art ensemble of chicago - "Immm" from _bap-tizum_ (koch jazz 8500)
and "Illistrum" from _fanfare for the warriors_ (koch jazz 8501). also
a great track, can't remember the title, from what was initially
released on aristra/freedom as _the paris sessions_ and is now on 2CDs,
_tutankhamun_ and _the spiritual_.

cecil taylor's most extensive recorded efforts (to my knowledge) in
verbal art can be found on a series of recordings he did in the late
1980s for leo records: Tzotzil/Mummers/Tzotzil (Leo CD 162), Live in
Bologna (Leo CD 100), Live in Vienna (Leo CD 174), and Chinampas (Leo
CD 153)

CALL FOR PROPOSALS for INCUBATION3
The 3rd trAce International Symposium on Writing and the Internet
12-14 July 2004 at The Nottingham Trent University, England

We are pleased to invite proposals for Incubation3, the leading internation=
al event for writers and artists working online.

Proposals should be submitted via an online form which will be available on=
 the website from Friday 10th October 2003: http://trace.ntu.ac.uk/incubati=
on/

Deadline for Proposals 1st December 2003
Selections announced by 31st January 2004

Keynote Speaker: Mark Amerika
Plus: Paul Brown, Alan Sondheim, Tim Wright
Also featuring: Talan Memmott, Kate Pullinger, Stefan Schemat

Conference Committee

ink : Simon Mills : Alan Sondheim : Sue Thomas : Lawrence Upton : Helen Whi=
tehead

BURSARIES
New at Incubation3 - 30 bursaries are available for delegates and presenter=
s
Generously funded by Arts Council England: East Midlands: http://www.artsco=
uncil.org.uk/aboutus/myregion_eastmidlands.html

Applications should be submitted via an online form which will be available=
 on the website from Friday 10th October 2003: http://trace.ntu.ac.uk/incub=
ation/

Previous Incubations
Incubation 2000: http://trace.ntu.ac.uk/incubation/archive/2000/index.htm
Incubation 2002: http://trace.ntu.ac.uk/incubation/index2002.cfm

Why a Symposium?
Those familiar with Incubation will notice that we are now a Symposium rath=
er than a Conference. This heralds a subtle shift, not in identity, but in =
the way we promote the event. Incubation has always been very practice-base=
d and in 2004 it will be even more so. Thanks to Arts Council England (http=
://www.artscouncil.org.uk/) we are offering a total of 30 bursaries to enab=
le those who cannot obtain funding elsewhere to attend the full residential=
 conference at no charge. We expect this injection of financial support to =
provide a greater balance of academia and professional writers and artists.

Themes
The purpose of Incubation has always been to provide ideas, stimulus and mo=
tivation; information and debate for the international new media writing co=
mmunity. We aim to encourage interdisciplinary creativity and cross-fertili=
sation, and we are especially interested in introducing the form to writers=
 for whom it is a new idea as well as helping practitioners to share and ex=
pand their work.
The themes for 2004 are:
A. Developing a new form: contemporary textual works in new media and perfo=
rmance
B. The practice of making: creative and professional practice; online teach=
ing and learning.
C. Critique and criteria: criticism, reviewing, defining, and archiving of =
new media writing.

TYPES OF PROPOSALS SOUGHT
Proposals will not be considered unless they are submitted via the online f=
orm. When completing the form please indicate which of the above themes (A,=
 B or C) your proposal relates to.

Guidelines
In order to make the field as open as possible we have kept guidelines to a=
 minimum but as a rough guide, we encourage lively debate and provocative t=
hinking about:
*recent work by both new and established writers and artists. You may simpl=
y show/perform the work, or accompany it with a practice-based commentary o=
r formal critique
*explorations of the ways in which new media works are made, discussed, rev=
iewed, categorised and archived
*explorations of online teaching and learning in a creative context
*surprise us!

1. Presentations - 20 minutes
We invite proposals for 20 minute presentations which we will group togethe=
r in panels of three with an added 30 minutes for questions. You are also w=
elcome to organise and propose your own panel.

2. Performances
A number of 20 minute presentation periods may be used for short performanc=
es / presentations of work. In addition a number of longer evening sessions=
 may be available. We particularly welcome performances which extend limits=
 and cross boundaries. Proposals should describe the performance and specif=
y technical support required, set-up times, audience profiles, length of pe=
rformance, etc.

3. Workshops - 1 hour
There will be space for a limited number of hands-on workshops. We are inte=
rested in workshops with a specific technical or artistic focus. Please ind=
icate whether you require a PC resource room or a regular classroom.

4. Position Papers/Posters - 10-15 minutes
There will be a limited number of 1 hour sessions beginning with the presen=
tation of a short position paper which will have been put online before the=
 conference and which will act as a stimulus for discussion. These sessions=
 will be chaired and a scribe will be provided. We invite contentious paper=
s with scope for energetic debate. The online =91paper=92 may be in text or=
 any new media format which will be viewable at the discussion and should b=
e submitted by 1st June 2004.

Details of the technology available in our presentation rooms will be avail=
able on the website from 10th October 2003: http://trace.ntu.ac.uk/incubati=
on/

ADDITIONAL COLLABORATIVE PROJECT FOR NEW MEDIA / VIDEO / SOUND ARTISTS
We hope to obtain funding for Online/Offline, a collaborative project conne=
cting three new media writers with three video artists and a sound artist t=
o work together online to create an original piece to be premiered at Incub=
ation. Application time for this is likely to be short - current planning i=
s to invite applications from new media writers during the month of Decembe=
r only. The video artists and sound artist will be based in the East Midlan=
ds and will be separately appointed. Register for updates to receive furthe=
r information: http://trace.ntu.ac.uk/incubation/informed.cfm

Hi,
This is an article by a friend of mine:

A bridge to the ivory tower: The legacy of Edward Said

http://www.cbc.ca/news/viewpoint/vp_tokaryk/20030926.html
\
snip
<
For students and scholars like myself, increasingly skeptical about the
relevance of their work in the "real world," Said's approach to the
rarified realm of contemporary literary theory and philosophy is not only
refreshing but also inspiring. It is not an exaggeration to say that
Edward Said has provided the humanities and social sciences with a renewed
sense of relevance in an age when increasingly critical eyes are looking
to cut academic programs that cannot seem to provide a "practical purpose"
in our utilitarian society.

The Washington Post's Style Invitational once again asked readers to take any word from the dictionary, alter it by adding, subtracting, or changing one letter, and supply a new definition. Here are this year's (2003) winners:

1. Intaxication: Euphoria at getting a tax refund, which lasts until you realize it was your money to start with.

2. Reintarnation: Coming back to life as a hillbilly.

3. Bozone (n.): The substance surrounding stupid people that stops bright ideas from penetrating. The bozone layer, unfortunately, shows little sign of breaking down in the near future.

4. Foreploy: Any misrepresentation about yourself for the purpose of getting laid.

5. Cashtration (n.): The act of buying a house, which renders the subject financially impotent for an indefinite period.

6. Giraffiti: Vandalism spray painted very, very high.

7. Sarchasm: The gulf between the author of sarcastic wit and the person who doesn't get it.

8. Inoculatte: To take coffee intravenously when you are running late.

9. Hipatitis: Terminal coolness.

10. Osteopornosis: A degenerate disease. (This one got extra credit.)

11. Karmageddon: It's like, when everybody is sending off all these really bad vibes, right? And then, like, the Earth explodes and it's like, a serious bummer.

12. Decafalon (n.): The grueling event of getting through the day consuming only things that are good for you.

13. Glibido: All talk and no action.

14. Dopeler Effect: The tendency of stupid ideas to seem smarter when they come at you rapidly.

15. Arachnoleptic Fit (n.): The frantic dance performed just after you've accidentally walked through a spider web.

16. Beelzebug (n.): Satan in the form of a mosquito that gets into your bedroom at three in the morning and cannot be cast out.

17. Caterpallor (n.): The color you turn after finding half a grub in the fruit you're eating.

And the pick of the literature:

18. Ignoranus: A person who's both stupid and an a**hole.

The musician David Amram lives in this area of the Catskills where he owns a
big farm and sometimes backs local readers.  He is so delightful a jazz
musician that he makes a list of things seen by backyard poets who really don't
have any reputation and are first time readers sound like Mayakovsky.  He's in
his seventies now (he looks fifty) but if you get a chance to see him, don't
miss it.  I asked him after he played what he thought was still important about
the Beats, and he said that they took everybody seriously, and tried to see the
genius in each person, and he said when he is playing he does that, too, to try
to pass on that spirit of absolute generosity.

Yes, the question of a "jazz poetics", practice or theory, is surely
related to the 'balance of tendencies' that defines the argument -- and
the particulars of how the question's framed in accordance with the
vibrational tendencies of the culture group that poses the question.
In itself, this argument is one that gives insight into the changing
cycles of discourse. What I'm saying is that we can better understand
the specifics of ANY poetics by examining the position of its drive.
Every generation (and sub-gen) seems to be faced with the challenge
of establishing a viewpoint that's consistent with the info. base of its
time period. So, it seems, the concept of  'jazz poetics' can allow for
ritual identification (and alignment). I think it is through this where
we have this involvement with the kind of associations that transcend
two-dimensional structural recognitions. the discussion of the structure
and form of jazz, poetry... and jazz poetics -- each on its own place --
without regard for related baggage -- may be a start. Until the next cycle
calls for a development of structures that have universal application.

Hi all,

This is especially for those going to see Brenda Coultas and Bhanu Kapil Rider
read this Wed., Oct. 1 at the Poetry Project. (If you aren't, come see our Boog
Does Madonna show at the Bowery Poetry Club, which I posted about last week.
For more info on it: boogcity.blog-city.com).

Bowery Poetry Club grand poobah Bob Holman has graciously waved the door charge
for anyone who comes to the club that night following the PoProj reading. So
you might catch the tail end of the Madonna show, but you will definitely catch
an hour-long set by Ruth Gordon, a.k.a Aaron Kiely.

And, as if that weren't enough, the good people of FROST'D, the Foundation for
Research on Sexually Transmitted Diseases, will have one of their vans parked
outside the whole night through to administer free AIDS tests.

hope you can make it.

as ever,
david

October 1, Wednesday -- 8pm

The Poetry Project at St. Mark's Church presents:


Brenda Coultas & Bhanu Kapil Rider

Bowery Project (Leroy Press), a long poem paired with a critical essay by
Alan Gilbert. Her work has also appeared in Conjunctions, Fence, and The
Poetry Project Newsletter, among others. She spent the summer in Mexico and
is currently collecting and writing true ghost stories.


Bhanu Kapil Rider is the author of a book of poetry, The Vertical
Interrogation of Strangers (Kelsey St Press), and a chapbook of prose,
Autobiography of a Cyborg. A full-length book of expanded cyborg

currently collaborating with her sister, Rohini Kapil-Mitchell, on
Water-damage: a memoir, an investigation of the high incidence of
schizophrenia in the South Asian communities of London, England. She lives
in Loveland, Colorado. [8:00 p.m.]

members who take out membership at $85 or higher will get in free to all
regular readings)

For more info call 212-674-0910

Ps -- we're slowly but surely cutting through the morass of time and space
here at the Project in an effort to bring you timely e-mails and big bags of
money but you'll just have to give us a little bit of room to make it work
and freak out a bit and pick up all the pieces and toss them around a few
times before we totally even pretend to get it all right, but it's alright.

We're looking forward to seeing you.

IAN RANDALL WILSON | THE WILSON POEMS

Ian Randall Wilson's first fiction collection, HUNGER AND OTHER STORIES,
was published by Hollyridge Press in 2000. Recent work of his has appeared
in AUGHT, SPINNING JENNY, and ALASKA QUARTERLY REVIEW. He is managing
editor of the poetry annual 88: A JOURNAL OF CONTEMPORARY AMERICAN POETRY.

WILSON DISCOURSES ON THE PERSONAL

Finally the personal
is all I can hold onto,
the vanishing sill between foundation and wall.
What is authenticity to a frog?
I have spent years inventing
my parents--divorcing them, killing them off
in piece after piece.
Never allowing them to come together,
I negate my existence through their disunion.
I pit fictitious brothers against themselves,
make sisters hate.
Then I set myself up as an only child,
emperor of the toy box, the one pony.
What can be more personal than a list of lovers
who have passed from the scene?
The name of everyone I ever lied to
beginning and ending with me?

A man walks into a house, the door closes, and he is alone.
From other rooms a wife appears, children even cats.
Time passes and he is again alone, gravitating
toward his natural state.  For a moment
I don't doubt the sadness
but because I say it doesn't make it true--
only ducks are that sincere.

In the instant I believe I have grasped
all the possible permutations of a life,
something new presents itself,
a thing that might startle,
perhaps incest this time
might confirm to myself there is being, not emptiness,
a man remotely resembling a man that is me.

Spread the word. Far and wide,

William Slaughter

this year's PEN Center USA poetry award and co-winner of the annual
literary award of the Asian American Writers' Workshop. Please come
up afterwards and say hello. I'll be glad to sign and stamp copies of
my books w my red-inked seal! / Walter

Subject:      Baraka over Rexroth
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="US-ASCII"
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

The famous Rexroth performances are best characterized for me in the words of
a fellow college classmate, who was then doing an exhaustive study of Jazz
Poetry, as : "poetry with jazz." For in terms of performance dynamics, what one
listening from a musical perspective cannot help note is the near disjuntion
between word and music.  Ginsberg's "Lion is For Real" suffers in much the same
way.

There's no sense defining "jazz" in a hundred-word post, but if one weren't
wary of trafficing in "essences," it would be useful to talk about the
collaborative interchange in performance (a phrase I may have cribbed from a Michael
Magee article on Baraka/O'Hara)--an interchange that marks the event as
"emergent" and involves musicians as well as the relationship of performers to
audience.

In terms of performances that enact this kind of open, improvisatory
aesthetic: I nominate Baraka, Brathwaite, and (not just to throw y'all off, )Vicun~a.

just a few weeks ago i heard steve lacy perform, with a singer, poems
he had set by bob kaufman, anne waldman, kenneth rexroth, and jack
kerouac.  i have no idea if these were new or not, but the waldman at
least appeared to be, as the text was a new years poem (?) from just
a few years ago.

INFO: "kin" uk tour
================

renaissance one invites you to the launch of


Kin

A 2003 - 2004 UK spoken word tour



Kin is a platform for contemporary British culture - poets, prose writers,

musicians, DJs, VJs and visual artists exploring the theme of 'kinship' and

published by Serpents Tail on 16 October.


Kin explores what our understanding of family ‚Äì or kin ‚Äì is today.  The

complexities of our relationships moves beyond the biological so that

sometimes, the people we eat with, spend time with, sleep with, and rely on,

or those with whom we share common experiences, are family too.

Pimpin Ain't Easy: A Day With Fillmore Slim and Mayor Willie L. Brown
by Marvin X
9/26/03
Notes from the Wilderness, new essays by Marvin X, unpublished, 2003
(c) 2003 by Marvin X
xblackxmanx@aol.com


Today was the city of San Francisco's annual Recovery Day, sponsored by
the SF Association of Alcohol and Drug Program Contractors. Along with
Mayor Willie Brown, I was scheduled to speak, representing Recovery
Theatre. Also speaking were Dr. H. Westley Clark, Director, Center for
Substance Abuse Treatment and Henry Lozano, President's Advisory
Commission of Drug Free Communities. The Master of Ceremonies was
director/actress/writer Rhodessa Jones of Cultural Odyssey. The program
was scheduled to being at 2PM, but I arrived at Glide Church for a 12:30
appointment with the West coast godfather of pimps, Fillmore Slim. When
I walked in he was asking the desk clerk where was Marvin. I said, "I'm
Marvin, are you Fillmore Slim," although I recognized him from the movie
American Pimp." He immediately acknowledged to me and to everyone except
the deaf that he was Fillmore Slim. I must admit he looked better in
person than he did in the movie, wearing a classic brim and a nice brown
and black mini-checkered sports coat, slacks and classic pimpin shoes.

As planner of the Tenderloin Book Fair, I've asked authors for
suggestions. James Robinson, author of the novel Gospel of the Game,
suggested I meet with Fillmore Slim to possibly involve him in the book
fair, since his novel is partly about Fillmore, Robinson's mentor. I
hesitated, but agreed to meet with the godfather. I hesitated because of
the image pimps have in these enlightened times, times of so-called
political correctness. But I had already put James on the panel with me
to discuss Radical Recovery Literature, sensing his novel was in this
genre along with my work and another writer, Andriette Earl, who deals
with spiritual recovery.

So as we stood in Glide's lobby, I began feeling Fillmore out, basically
I wanted to know where he was coming from, was he still advocating
pimping or what? I knew James has reformed and wants to speak with young
men who have it twisted, as they say in the game, but I wasn't clear
about Fillmore. Even before our meeting, I went ahead (as I am known to
do) and put him in the program to give a tour of the Tenderloin,
thinking this would add some drama to the book fair, plus his walk
through the TL might attract the gold teeth brothers. Fillmore agreed to
do the tour and agreed he would indeed attract a crowd because, after
all, he is the undisputed godfather of west coast pimpin. He informed me
that he just came from North Carolina on a program with Snoop Dog and
other good pimpin nigguhs, although he said he went along with Snoop
only because he recognizes and accepts the blessings asÝ the Pope of
Pimpin, but he said Snoop was hardly a pimp, it was only in his mind.
Fillmore said Snoop and all the other so-called young pimpin nigguhs
ain't doin nothin but fuckin up the game. "They ain't got no class,
first of all, call theyself pimpin with they pants hangin off they ass,
pimpin in joggin suits, they fuckin up the game. But I go along with
them cause they recognize me, bow down to me, but what they doin ain't
hardly pimping. Another thing: they wanna kill their women if she leave
them--don't no real pimps do that--they want to kill the a brother if
the hoe go to him, that ain't in the game. They think the woman supposed
to be with them for life, wanna beat her up. They don't understand, if
they don't beat her, she might come back to them. These youngsters
fuckin up the game."
"So where you comin from, Fillmore?" I asked several times, wanting to
first get it crystal clear in my mind.
"Look, I did want I did because I had to, that's how it was in those
days, that's all a nigguh could do. But it ain't like that now, they got
computers and things that nigguhs can make money with. They ain't got to
pimp."
"So where you comin from?"
"I'm not gonna condemn the game, see, because I got people on both
sides. But I paid my dues, I went to prison. I'm not proud of what I did
and what I tell people is think about the consequences of your actions.
There's a price for being in this game. Think about how you end up."
"Yeah, from bling blind to Sing Sing," I said.
"That's a good one," Fillmore said.
"What is your messge to the women?"
"It's the same thing I tell the men. Think about the consequences.
There's a price. Are you willing to pay the price to be in the game?Ý If
you willing to pay the price, what can I say to you? Just know there's a
price."

By this time, James Robinson had arrived, Fillmore's captain in the
game, as he tells in his novel Gospel of the Game. James said Fillmore
gave him the title because Gospel means truth and James, at this time in
his life, is about the truth. I turned to James, who was dressed pimpin
sharp in a white suit, tall, dark and handsome. But he was no match for
the godfather who could have easily been on the cover of GQ.
"So are you two in unity or what?"
"All I'm sayin is that what we did wasn't right and I'm sorry, and I
want the young brothers to hear what we have to say. And I want you to
help us get the message to them. We want to meet with them to tell them
pimpin ain't the way. Pimpin is death."
"Yeah, we all lucky to be standing here, me included," I said.
"So help us, Marvin, we got a message to give. I saw Fillmore make
thousands a day, ten thousands, but that ain't the way. The young
brothers got to know this."
Fillmore added, "Now some of them gonna talk about me, say I'm talkin
against the game, but I ain't doin that, I wouldn't do that. All I am
sayin is think about the consequences."

I told them that many years ago I had worked on the black men's
conference with another well known San Francisco hustler, Charlie
Walker. Of course Fillmore knew him. Walker is the godfather of Hunters
Point. Even the Black Panthers stayed away from Hunters Point at
Charlie's insistence. Charlie Walker will be invited to the Tenderloin
Book Fair, since he has just written a book, Black Sicilian. Charlie
Walker is known as Mayor Willie Brown's best friend. He was recently
indicted but not convicted for a minority contractor's scheme in
connection with the billion dollar construction of the San Francisco
airport.

But the Black men's conference was essentially about manhood training
and I suggested that James and Fillmore Slim were really talking about
the same thing so I could work with them. Fillmore's comments about
domestic violence are applicable to any male/female situation. Consider
all the brothers in anger management, pimps and squares alike could
benefit from Fillmore's message. And let's face it, there's a lot men
can learn from a man who has dealt with women on the level pimp's have.
Not long ago, a whore told me, "Marvin, you couldn't be a pimp because
you're too rough. Look how you treat your car, look how you drive your
car, look how you walk up the stairs, too rough, be gentle."

I told the brothers about another manhood training situation in Oakland.
I spoke to a drug program run by another reformed pimp from West
Oakland, Terrible Tom. They knew him. As I spoke to the young brothers,
one said, "Man, you know what, some of my podnas ain't even gay, but
they sound gay because they've never heard a man's voice, they don't
know how to talk like a man!"

So I agreed that Fillmore would be on the panel Radical Recovery
Literature, since he has a documentary movie coming out that goes beyond
the film American Pimp in that it focuses on his life and at the end of
the movie he denounces pimpin.

Fillmore presented me with a CD of his music, which was shocking because
I never knew this side of him. He said, "Man, that's what people don't
know about me. I'm an artist, a blues guitar player. I've been playin at
all the blues festivals from Main to Spain. All over Europe. I played
before 30,000 people in Copenhagen. In the middle of my act, I went into
Nina Simone's Porgy and Bess, a cappella, blew them away."

The masters of the gameÝ followed me into Glide's Freedom Hall where I
proceeded to set up my table for Recovery Day. James was really the more
humble of the two, maybe because the godfather had such a reputation to
uphold that he couldn't outright denounce the game, feeling it would
make him a traitor in the eyes of those who worshipped him, but I am
convinced he wants to send a message to young men who think pimpin is
easy, to give it a second thought and try to find a better life with
positive consequences.

The old pimps departed and I finished arranging my table with books,
tapes, CDs and videos of my productions, all the time organzing my
thoughts on what I would say to the audience of recovering addicts who
were slowly drifting upstairs to Glide's sanctuary. I saw the godmother
of Glide walk into Freedom Hall, Jan Mirikitani, wife of Rev. Cecil
Williams and former poet laureate of San Francisco. I went up to Jan
andÝ gave her a hug as she talked with the event organizer. When she
realized it was me, she told the organizer, "You know Marvin awakened me
to my ethnic consciousness in the 60s and he's been a torn in my side
ever since."

Can people be ungrateful or what? Well, I was ungrateful when I went
into the recovery program at Glide and Jan and Cecil became my
codependents, giving me everything I asked, and of course I used them to
continue my dope habit.

Recovery Day began in the sanctuary. Singing by the Teen Challenge
choir. I passed out promotional literature to the mixed audience of
blacks, whites, Latinos and Native Americans. I recognized some people
in the audience that have been in recovery more years than I can count.
But then I thought, thank God they are still trying, against all the
pressures in America to go under, as that classic rap told us. I saw a
girl in the audience who was in my play in 1996, when we did a
production with Oakland's Healthy Babies Project, a program for pregnant
mothers on dope. The girl is still in a program, bless her heart. I
noticed a girl from the TL that was 15 when I saw her initiated into the
dope game, now some twenty years later she is seeking recovery, and even
though she is well over six feet tall, somehow she seems to have lost
her height, but I told her later that I remembered her and thank God she
is trying to recover. She said amen.

Pimpin ain't easy.


After boring remarks by a negro from the US government, Dr. H. Westley
Clark, a pitiful negro no one should be subjected to hearing, and a
Latino who claimed he was on the drug recovery circuit with Dr. Clark, a
pitiful Latino no one should be subjected to hearing, then some
entertainment, including some rappers and a poet who excited the
audience more than the government agents, Clark and Latino Lazano, thenÝ
a special award was presented to Mayor Willie Brown, my main man, the
slickest nigguh in America. He so slick he put grease lightning to
shame. In his own words, as he accepted his award--and for once he noted
he was genuinely happy because it wasn't a certificate but a beautiful
light brown hat that fit him perfectly--in his forty years in politics,
he never went to jail, and he said it as though it was a great
achievement for a black man in America, not only in politics, but life
in America in general.

As he departed the stage, I gave him a brochure and told him I wanted
him to help the Tenderloin Book Fair as one of his last acts as mayor of
San Francisco. He nodded. And I want to say that Mayor Willie L. Brown
has supported Recovery Theatre, although we have performed in Oakland
without any support from Jerry Brown. Amiri Baraka noted thisÝ about the
Brown brother mayors:
One is black
one is white
one steals by day
one steals by nite.

Rhodessa Jones said it was my turn. I took the mike and noted how Glide
had been helpful in my recovery and the recovery of many, many thousands
in the Tenderloin. Even the Mayor said Glide should be the new home of
Recovery Day, San Francisco. I agreed with him but said now it was time
to get to the low down dirty truth. We had heard from the government,
the national, state and local, now let me get to the funky truth.

There are many forms of addiction. One can be addicted to pimping. I
told the audience about my earlier meeting with Fillmore Slim.
Essentially, a meeting with pimps in recovery. I didn't tell the pimps
or the audience that my next step is to call in SAGE, a group of
prostitutes in recovery funded by Oprah Winfrey. SAGE has come to
performances of Recovery Theatre and it seems to me they should be part
of the dialogue with pimps. Seems to me.

I said I want to go where no one else has gone, down into the deep dark
purple funk. TalkingÝ about the addiction and recovery from cocaine,
speed, crack, alcohol, weed and heroin is fine. But I want to talk about
the addiction to ignorance and white supremacy. Ignorance and white
supremacy kills more people than all drugs combined. Even after
recovery, people yet fall victim to ignorance and white supremacy, which
are one, after all, white supremacy breeds fromÝ ignorance. The bible
said people were destroyed for lack of knowledge, not from crack,
heroin, speed, weed, but lack of knowledge!

So yes, the first step is to get the resin out of your brains, but it
must be replaced with knowledge, and white supremacy must be eliminated.
This goes for you whites, blacks and Latinos. You cannot hate and be in
recovery because hatred puts you on the plane with animals, therefore
you are not human, therefore you have not recovered in any real sense.
You can talk about the 12 Steps, talk about Jesus, Allah, Buddha, but
you have not recovered.

You cannot be in recovery yet accept the lies of this government. How
can you wave the flag to lies and half truths? Where are the weapons of
mass destruction? Where is the connection between Saddam Hussein and
9/11? There is none. Tell your government to get the weapons of mass
destruction out of the ghetto! Tell them to take out the dope, take out
the guns, take out the disease, the chemical and biological weapons they
are spreading in the ghettoes of America. And then you will get to the
real high, the Most High, the only High, God Himself. Give God the
praise. Give God the praise. As-Salaam-Alaikum.

Dear Friend:

In celebration of Black History month, 2004, Recovery Theatre, Inc. is
hosting the Tenderloin Book Fair and Poetry Festival. We would like you
to consider being a sponsor of this event which will take place Friday
and Saturday, January 30-31, 2004,Ý at Recovery Theatre @ Theatre St.
Boniface, 133 Golden Gate Ave., between Leavenworth and Jones, San
Francisco. A sponsor will donate $1,000.00 or more toward our budget of
$25,000.00, covering such items as travel expenses, hotel lodging, food,
honorariums, space rental, printing costs, advertising, organizer fees,
video documentation, sound equipment, etc. If you would like to cover
one of the above budget items, please feel free to do so.


The purpose of the book fair is to expose Tenderloin residents and the
Bay Area population to writers and spoken word artists, known and
unknown. We especially want to profile self published authors not given
exposure in the commercial media and market place. We want to showcase
talent in the Tenderloin, an area mainly known for drugs, crime and
homelessness. After all, great literature is known to originate from
such areas. Marvin X's play ONE DAY IN THE LIFE based on his days as a
drug addict in the Tenderloin has become a recovery classic.

30.

I stretch dew across the cartops at night. This world
pales in comparison with the next.

My balls burn into my thighs.

Their little eyes are hooks they see me. Watching may
be a part of touching. I didn't want to be so far
away. But when you call I go transparent: I
tentatively abstract from this attraction in your
voice some spinning crazy flowers, and they're made of
candy. Remember?

Max and Lucy wander the neighborhood with wax lips.
They visit the elderly at night. You know how you
don't sleep when you're old.

I stayed awake the duration of my life. Reams of earth
file ill light empathetic topgraphies of canopy moons.


They know a sound you walk on. Bow to the instrument
before you play it.

Strings I think are mostly, air,
nothing concurrent in folds
or pasted-over with serenity, but
you know me when I'm awake: trembles,
stuffs his hands with gardens he
took from you, that one night
washing in behind hundreds, as
he wants you to sing his
sleep across him, part
wet towelettes with a mercury
tongue. Yes, you too
have forked with secrets by now, and
eat the last of your vigor, still
shaking from honest impact, into
daubs of first drafts, pretended
preliminaries of the ceremony, not
caring what falls across to you, except
to sing (here) that sleep (her)
over the dear weight of the fan.
I let accidents happen here.

You pushed me away pushed me away pushed me away. I
went sailing labeled and docile into literature and
all its incessant talk about chords. There were old
men there, about Max and Lucy's age, but none of them
could get it up anymore. I dress like a whore only to
please you.

Blue. Cupping wind. And their serrations. Is an urge
to sense. Their empathy. Like lily tendrils unroll'd
throughout the big city. Turning on. I follow
everything up to and including the letter. Froze
easily. From. A dissolution. Added to. Their recent.
And almost engaging. With suck and mud strokes. Belief
in coherent imaging. Taup.

Spikes of the smallest water
waffle flung nutrition. The spine
as an ivy for Venus not even
with unnatural days. Smoke

sits across from, tousled,
loud; she never sleeps

always, no relief of tension
daubed out with a tongue.
The light has a broad back by
mid-afternoon. I was

naive then, to vapor with ropes
through my pores, to blister and
blossom like drops of salt
in grains of water, announce:
It would be an anguish to go
one day without hearing
your voice Renee. Isn't it

it enough not to be able to
touch you? I whittle nights

sculpting myself into
corners, casting my variables
aside into a core dump
so central to my definitions.
Inside me the functions

pass nothing between themselves,
not even the stealth of trojans.

For a dose of literary border envy, Millie Niss and I crossed over into
Canada to attend Canada's cross-country, one-day, free, literary
festival, the biggest in Toronto which we attended.  Gift of the day:
Michel Basilieres reading from Black Bird, his novel published by Knopf
Canada in 2003.  Anglophone, raised in Montreal, Basilieres captures the
experience of bilingual, bicultural people, privileged or plagued by the
dance between two languages, two sensibilities, living on the cusp of
each, always inside, always outside their surroundings.  This tension may
produce fatigue in the un-gifted, but for others, it leads to literary
experimentation.  The artist sees what others do not, exposes it, invents
works which might be virtually impossible for someone raised with both
feet in the same culture.  Somehow, even intense "double-dipping" as an
adult is not quite the same.  I lived for more than two years in France.
While French culture may influence my writing, it is not the same for my
daughter who spent the first 2 1/2 years of life in France, learning to
speak French and English simultaneously, later educated in both systems
through to the Bac.  What remains language or cultural translation for me
is native for her, for Basilieres.  For poets, this posture and the
opportunities it presents is a normal condition for writing.  Even
exposure across borders of countries as similar as Canada and the USA,
produces a firm reminder of how culture-bound much literature is (e.g.
the magazines with their "genuine Canadian magazine" stamp on them with
their limitations on "international work" or U.S. produced poetry with
its references set firmly in US cities and people -- both excluding
French Canadian work -- the French writers with their separate
associations and festivals).  Forty-eight hours only, yet exposure,
glimpses of literary possibilities that I hope will last for months.

A reminder, too, of how important these listserves are with their
international memberships.  Ah, to sit in North Tonawanda, NY and to
partake. . .

Hi all,

I'm looking for someone in the five boroughs who'd like to be the East Village
editor for Boog City.

The editor would be responsible for getting 1-2 pages per month filled with
community news and features, including stories on neighborhood personalities,
local political disputes, and trends. In general, all things local that don't
fall under the scope of our music, printed matter, or small press editors. But
if there's an interesting new record label based in the East Village, the East
Village editor would work together with the music editor to find someone to
write about the label.

This person could also play a large part in our coverage of the Republican
National Convention next summer.

The East Village editor need not write any of the stories but may if so desired.

Please backchannel to editor@boogcity.com if you are interested.

thanks,
david

TENDER PARTES #0001



  But wander too and fro in wayes vnknowne/That greatest Glorious Queene
of Faerie lond/Her whom he waking euermore did weene/Weening their
wonted entrance to haue found/Then of the certaine perill he stood
in/You whom my hard auenging destinie/Lets me not sleepe but wast the
wearie night/That greatest Glorious Queene of Faerie lond/The which at
last out of the wood them brought/That weaker sence it could haue
rauisht quight/And dead as liuing euer him ador'd/Is wisely to aduise
now day is spent.

  By which he saw the vgly monster plaine/In hast vnto his Lord where he
him left afore/Who nought aghast his mightie hand enhaunst/Right
faithfull true he was in deede and word/But on his brest a bloudie
Crosse he bore/But forth vnto the darksome hole he went/But wander too
and fro in wayes vnknowne/Or the blind God that doth me thus amate/As
one that inly mournd so was she sad/With that misformed spright he backe
returnd againe/Her doubtfull words made that redoubted knight.

  Downe in a dale hard by a forests side/The warlike Beech the Ash for
nothing ill/As when old father nilus gins to swell/And knitting all his
force got one hand free/In which that wicked wight his dayes doth
weare/You whom my hard auenging destinie/His heauie head deuoide of
carefull carke/Both for her noble bloud and for her tender youth/Lo
there before his face his Lady is/Vnder blake stole hyding her bayted
hooke/The warlike Beech the Ash for nothing ill/Strangle her else she
sure will strangle thee/He to his study goes and there amiddes/And to
him playnd how that false winged boy.

  Shall I accuse the hidden cruell fate/Tydings of warre and worldly
trouble tell/The danger hid the place vnknowne and wilde/Watching to
banish Care their enimy/Vnder blake stole hyding her bayted
hooke/Resolv'd in minde all suddenly to win/About her cursed head whose
folds displaid/Whose sences all were straight benumbd and starke/The
builder Oake sole king of forrests all.

  At last dull wearinesse of former fight/Suspect her truth yet since
no' vntruth he knew/Resolv'd in minde all suddenly to win/That soone to
loose her wicked bands did her constraine/Then seemed him his lady by
him lay/That euery wight to shrowd it did constrain.

  By them the Sprite doth passe in quietly/Most like that virgin true
which for her knight him took/And more to lulle him in his slumber
soft/Amid the bowels of the earth full steepe/The youthfull knight could
not for ought be staide/He raft her hatefull head without remorse/His
dwelling is there Tethys his wet bed/Seemd in their song to scorne the
cruell sky/The Sprite then gan more boldly him to wake/The God obayde
and calling forth straight way/And ouerflow each plaine and lowly dale.

  Deliuered it to him and downe did lay/Least suddaine mischiefe ye too
rash prouoke/But his wast wordes returnd to him in vaine/And knitting
all his force got one hand free/Watching to banish Care their
enimy/Gathred themselues about her body round/What frayes ye that were
wont to comfort me affrayd/And euer as he rode his hart did earne/Then
choosing out few wordes most horrible/Then with the Sunne take Sir your
timely rest.

  And proou'd your strength on a strong enimie/Soone as that vncouth
light vpon them shone/Lept fierce vpon his shield and her huge
traine/Huge heapes of mudd he leaues wherein there breed/Wringing her
hands in wemens pitteous wise/Long way he trauelled before he heard of
ought/The maker selfe for all his wondrous witt.

  Quoth then that aged man the way to win/His feete all bare his beard
all hoarie gray/With doubled forces high aboue the ground/Vpon a great
aduenture he was bond/Whereat he gan to stretch but he againe/All cleane
dismayd to see so vncouth sight/And shall you well reward to shew the
place/Bathed in wanton blis and wicked ioy/About her cursed head whose
folds displaid/At last resoluing forward still to fare/To Morpheus house
doth hastily repaire.

  By which he saw the vgly monster plaine/Ah Ladie said he shame were to
reuoke/Silly old man that liues in hidden cell/The drouping Night thus
creepeth on them fast/The other by him selfe staide other worke to
doo/And well I wote that of your later fight/Now when that ydle dreame
was to him brought/The youthfull knight could not for ought be
staide/From turning backe and forced her to stay/For whose sweete sake
that glorious badge he wore/And as halfe blushing offred him to kis/And
through the world of waters wide and deepe/Wherein ye haue great glory
wonne this day/The noblest mind the best contentment has.

  Whose corage when the feend perceiu'd to shrinke/And fram'd of liquid
ayre her tender partes/The day with cloudes was suddeine ouercast/That
when he heard in great perplexitie/At length they chaunst to meet vpon
the way/To Morpheus house doth hastily repaire/And sucked vp their dying
mothers blood/Their scepters stretcht from East to Westerne shore.

  As when old father Nilus gins to swell/So many pathes so many turnings
seene/Full iolly knight he seemd and faire did sitt/The which at last
out of the wood them brought/And wakefull dogges before them farre do
lye/With holy father sits not with such things to mell/In siluer deaw
his euer-drouping hed/The cruell markes of many' a bloudy fielde.

Hello Listpeople,

in Chain 10: Translucinacion, the tenth issue of the always fabulously
various magazine edited by Jena Osman & Juliana Spahr (with help, this
issue, from Thalia Field & Cecilia Vicuna).

Also on Elsewhere: a gloss on Rodrigo Toscano's Platform, and more ...

it's dark here; turmoil & dawn of darkness; dusk of mp3 & darkness;
dark light & shadows; wandering in this dark forest with virgins; i am
listening to the 4322; the forty-three hundred & eleven; among the 472;
among the four-hundred & seventy-two; depression sets in; close to the
edge; there are stars leaped off the edge; four-hundred seventy-two edge;
i am a sick man; i am the heart of darkness; i am mp3 mp3; i am :the
universe in false demand; the conversion of truth to mp3; there are ghosts
here; i am inviolate; they are coming home; he or she is coming home; i am
within the first thousand!; Lisa Loeb; through the disordering of the
universe; on this motion i carry with me; this body is going nowhere; i
could be someone's home; sauntering. not the woods; the forest. :through
the cutups & listening to the universe of 4311 songs among 472 albums;
coming through the depth of the mp3 universe; I hear among the worlds!; I
hear among the depths of the worlds!; my own work among Alanis &
Madonna; I hear you! I hear you!; albums & songs flickering in random
sort; there's no return for weeks; of perfect speech let it be said; ::
so you wouldn't notice :: so you wouldn't notice
