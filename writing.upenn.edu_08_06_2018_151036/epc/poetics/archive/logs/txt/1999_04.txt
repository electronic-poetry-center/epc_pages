The following titles showed up on a recent book order list for the
branches of the new york public library. please note that they are not
yet in the catalog; however, i'm posting them now because later, i'll
forget. look for them in the catalog in a few weeks (i don't know how
many weeks):

Matinees by Ange Mlinko

Nicholodeon: a book of lowerglyphs  by Darren Wershler-Henry

dont forget you can access the new york public library catalogs ("leo"
for the branches) at their website:   www.nypl.org

p.s. the ray johnson sites are swell! thanks

p.p.s.  the surrealist women anthology  i mentioned in former posts is
really gripping. but,  i agree with listee nancy burr:  not enuf pics!
mimi parent  is a personal fave. there's a lot of collagists in there.
the scope  is lovely. . . from the 1920s to the present, from all over
the world.  hmpf! i ,  ignorantly, had thot that surrealism was a
short-lived, mostly french movement.  the introductions to individual
chapters are really good .  the feminism  is right on. for me, it's a
great introductory textbook to surrealism generally. the point being,
of course,  that women have always been so much _in_ surrealism
"generally."

in response to pete spence about whether the whitney did indeed exhibit
contemporary mail art sent in tribute to ray

yes   there was a small  glass case  with a sampling of stuff    on a
pedestal  as you left the exhibit to go towards the elevators.  i had
gotten a flyer about it  and had expected that portion to be larger. the
mail art was sort of all piled up together, as  i remember it.
     i too  sent  something for ray
i made him a corregated love pome 7: correspondance for ray johnson.
dunno what happened to it   i left it with the receptionist wrapped in

A discursive note:  DRYLONGSO operates on several levels among which is
a strong social-real picturing, the site West Oakland and story:  Pica,
a beginning photography student who shoots back in one scene at a
lecturer's artspeak about "women and sensuality" etc. etc. with "Bitch,
what the fuck are you talking about?"  Her challenge gets heard as an
attitude, not as an appropriation of street speech to invite the
lecturer--a "sister"--to rethink what she not thinking about merely
recycling (art school stock-in-trade by now?)  Maybe she's looking for
an interaction by trying to provke a reaction.  Instead she gets a
lecture about her absenteeism and lack of a professional camera.  Pica
takes snapshots of black males with a polaroid, i.e., "don't nobody want
negatives of themselves passing around"--why?  "If you take their
picture you won't use their picture against them."  "I'm preserving the
evidence . . . some kind of trace of their existence."  (Pica in
conversation at a bus stop).  Maybe Pica's project needs to be thought
about re the mass media's using genocide to justify the newest NATO
bombings.  There have been bodies piling up in the U.S. for a long time
now. Economics or ethnic cleansing?  Is Smith's Pica saying that the
West Oaklands of the U.S. are proto labor/death camps?  (Memory of a

the camp).  Mumia's death-sentence shouldn't be separated from his

Coming from basically a working class background myself, I found Kathy
Lou Schultz's list an accurate and provocative one.  I have experienced
that state of hyper-awareness of codes and signs that communicate all
kinds of information and have the power to exclude if one is on the
outside.

Shame is at the intersection of class and gender.  Exposing the roots
(oops, actually typed "rot") of shame as something to be addressed,
redressed in writing.  This has to do with exposing what someone earlier
referred to as the rougher sides of life and hacking away at the miss
manners of polite, stay inside the lines, writing.

An earlier message never made it to the list (re Dodie's reply to my
message) which stated, basically, go get 'em Dodie.   Keep pushing those
boundaries.

dear poetics list:

There is an organization called POG that started in Tucson informally in
the winter/spring of 1997 and has proceeded to build a reading series and
present, in total, some 47 writers and artists from Feb. of 1997 until now
(or actually predicting through June of this year, which will end the
current year's series).

To keep this series alive, we have to do a certain amount of fundraising.
One way we are doing that right now is that we have created an anthology of
writers/artists from the series. We didn't get absolutely everyone who has
presented in the series, and we intend to correct that with a second
anthology next year.

This book is 60 pages, was produced via quick-print shop and then hand-sewn
in three signatures plus front & back covers in the Chax Press studios. It
is co-published by POG and Chax Press. It sells for $10. Checks can be made
out to POG and sent to POG c/o Chax Press at 101 W. Sixth St., no. 6,
Tucson, AZ 85701. Or you can call 520-620-1626 and place an order via
credit card. Please add $1 per book for book rate shipping, or add $3.20
for priority mail shipping if within the USA. For non-USA orders, email me
and we'll work out shipping costs. If you buy TWO copies or more, shipping
costs are waived (for book rate shipping within USA).

Because this is a fundraiser, we can't offer any further discounts or
trades at this time. Thank you.

Please send questions via email to chax@theriver.com  and not to the
poetics list.

you seem here (implicitly) to be equating "cultural studies" with
careerism.  to the extent that such an equation holds, it is not inherent
to cultural studies but *can be* a part of university culture.

there is nothing inherently more "rarified" about essays written from a
cultural studies perspective than essays written by, say, Allen Tate or
Helen Vendler.  Why are terms like "dramatic irony" or "persona" not
considered jargon, while "binary" or "hegemony" are?  As for social change,
agency for social change can happen at all levels, though its efficacy can
be debated.  i don't know any cultural studies scholars who would claim
that cultural studies scholarship ALONE can bring about meaningful social
change.

how are you measuring "social change?"  as an academic i sometimes think
that if i have gotten one working class student into a doctoral program, or
seen one mind change out of the hundred-odd students i see in a year, i
will have "effected social change."  ten years ago, everytime i mentioned
anything with homoerotic content in the classroom, several folks would get
up, walk out, and make a point of slamming the door.  that doesn' happen
now.  why? it's not because of my own efforts, nor because ofthe  public
visibility of ACT UP, but because Clinton's botched gays-in-the-military
forced a *mainstream*, public debate about these matters took the taboo
sting out of the topic.  this may make clinton and jesse helms more
effecitve agents of social change than i, but i do not believe it wise for
me to give up what i love doing to become a baby-kissing politician in
order to effect social change.

well, this doesn't directly bear on the issue of poetry and cultural

i agree w/ magee: one of my favorite anecdotes is about Aime Cesaire's
being asked about the reception of his work by Martiniquan peasants; aren't
they alienated by the erudition of it, he was asked.  not in the least, he
said; they're the most receptive and enthusiastic audience i've had.  i
always cite this to students who are afraid that their increasing erudition
will alienate them from their "community."

For those of you in and around Manhattan.  I have 7 tickets (4 for
Saturday, 3 for Sunday, they were $15/tik) to the Peoples Poetry Festival
next weekend.  Unfortunately, we won't be coming down for it.

If one or a number of you would like them I'd like to give them away - I'd
hate to have them go to waste.

Perhaps interested parties could make a modest donation to compost (if
over $8 you'd get you our new issue), but that's not necessarily
necessary.

Please email.

Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

It was a great weekend for poetry and related events in San Francisco - and
now, it being already Wednesday and I being disinclined to do more JOB - I
thought I might pass along a few impressions, for whatever they might be
worth...

Friday night witnessed San Franciscan Renee Gladman and New Yorker Eleni
Sikelianos reading to a full house in the Small Press Traffic series at New
College. Renee read first, a single, long-ish and more-or-less narrative
piece whose title I can't quite remember (I have to hear titles - as well as
people's names - at least three times before I remember them. My apologies
to Renee). At the risk of being hyperbolic, let me say that this was some of
the most exciting work I've heard from a writer of my approximate
"generation" this year. The story - which, with qualification, is what Renee
almost called it - seemed to work as both embodiment and critique of
story-telling as an ethnographic or anthropological enterprise. Creating a
fictional people, a "culture," Gladman interrogates what there is to be told
of such by posing her narrator at its edge or limit (which of course, is
also _within_ in a particularly unstable way). Folklore, archive and memory
where they stage their mutual acts of departure from and into one
another.... The culture to be "told" as an aggregate of departure (don't
know why Deleuze occurred to me just then, but so it is).... And some
marvelously memorable landscapes of mountains, caves, and one particularly
vexed and vexing tree....

In tone and overall construction it was utterly specific to its own
imperatives, but strangely reminiscent as well of certain strains within
feminist fantasy and science fiction. Echoes of Joanna Russ in its
allegorical imagining _otherwise_ of culture, but far more plural and
difficult in those allegorical dimensions and in its imagination of the
relation between culture and the specific acts of the writer or teller.
(Come to think of it, this text might be read productively as one [fictive]
way to open up some of the questions in the recent thread spinning off from
the "poetics-and/as-cultural-studies" nexus). Echoes also of Octavia Butler
in its specifically (I thought) feminist interest in speculating on endings,
cultural and historical - though, unlike Butler, not given to a weirdly
romantic "overtelling" of apocalyptic violence (thinking here of _Parable of
the Sower_ or _Clay's Ark_, for instance). All this with a consummate poet's
ear for the pacing and unfolding of sound, and this comes out in her reading
(see below). Who else? Borges, Laura Riding's more fabular prose work,
Marcel Griault, Hurston's folklore as if told by Clarice Lispector as a
character in one of Tarkovsky's SF films.... Ok, enough - and not to pose
these as "influences," but as handles for the description of a piece of
writing I'm finding pleasantly quite difficult to describe.

I'm told that the story is part of a manuscript to appear from Kelsey St.
Press this winter, so you can look for yourself. I recommend it highly. I
also recommend a hearing if she's in your area, as she's a great reader -
measured and calm without being leaden or pseudo-"profound." Just slow
enough. Anyone who remembers early musical training will know what I mean
here: beginners always speed up over the course of a performance, while
those stalled out one step above beginning overdo each ponderous
articulation in an attempt to _make_ meaning. Renee's at least two steps
beyond that - and that's a long way...

During the intermission the tenacious intestinal flu I'd been fighting came
back to pick up the records it had conveniently "left behind" after our
unfortunate assignation earlier in the week. So by the time the evening's
second reader, Eleni Sikelianos, took the lectern, I was doubled over with
cramps, trying not to fling a used burrito into the sweatshirt hood of the
person in front of me. Lest anyone think this is some version of the poetry
world's perennial snide snub, let me be clear that I'm serious - I was in a
lot of pain and didn't really hear much of what was going on. My apologies
to Eleni - I hope someone else has impressions of her reading they'd like to
share.

Saturday and Sunday, in brief, were music nights for me and others. Saturday
was the final night of San Francisco's Other Minds festival, which found Jen
Hofer, Tanya Hollis and myself in attendance. First on the bill was the U.S.
concert premiere of French concrete (sorry, can't do acute accents) composer
Luc Ferrari's fourth installment in his _Presque Rien_ series, subtitled _La
remontee au village_ (sorry, can't remember French genders just now). Lovely
piece - if the various ambient musics are, in Terre Thaemlitz's words "a
tactical reversal of figure-ground relationships," then I might describe
Ferrari's tape piece as perhaps a further refinement, in which those
relationships are not so much reversed as multiplied. The sounds of Ferrari
and his wife climbing to an Alpine Italian village figure as a sort of
ground bass (I think that's from the program notes) over which variously
electronically manipulated sounds - some obviously so, some quite subtly
different from "reality" -- from the same walk are superimposed in a more
overtly musical structure. The pluralization of this opposition occurs as
one begins to hear, in the "unaltered background," the "sources" of sounds
one had taken previously as occupying the "altered foreground." The overall
effect is not one of simple reversal, since over the sixteen-minute course
of the piece what happens is a cumulative potentiating of forward movement
in the background and backward movement in the foreground, until it's only
in a very local (second-by-second) sense that one can tell which is which.
(Sorry to spend so much time on this, but it occurs to me that music
specifically for recorded media, especially music with a "documentary"
component as strong as Ferrari's, really is a kind of writing, and might be
of interest to people whose interests otherwise run in a more literary
direction).

Second up was toy piano virtuoso Margaret Leng Tan, who played works for
that instrument by John Cage, Antonio Pinho Vargas, Guy Klucevsek and Toby
Twining. The Pinho Vargas piece was my favorite, as it seemed to take the
instrument seriously for what it was - scored for two toy pianos, it took
advantage of the "bad," tinny timbral qualities of the instruments in a
restrained, unflashy piece that gave a lot of space for those dissonant
outer partials to ring against each other. The evening's final performance
was by the ensemble CRASH, doing choreographed percussion pieces by Mary
Ellen Childs. Not my favorite of the night - technically very accomplished,
but not (to my jazz and Varese-inhabited ears) very rhythmically
interesting, and the choreography, while again a marvel of coordination,
started to feel manipulative and gimmicky about halfway into the second of
the four or five compositions.

Sunday was the final performance at SF's Sweatshop improv space, and
featured a set by the Larry Ochs / Lisle Ellis / Douglas (?) Robinson trio
What We Live and two solo sets by Steve Lacy. Since this post has gone on
long enough already, I'll simply say that all three sets were intense and
beautiful in very different ways - What We Live episodic and
quasi-narrative, Lacy linear and "argumentative" like the best of essay
writers. (I know that "linear" is often a derogatory term in these here
parts, so let me make it clear that I mean to attach quite the opposite
value to it). Poetry folk in attendance included Lyn Hejinian, Bill Berkson,
Steve Dickison, Jen Hofer, Renee Gladman, and yours truly - many of us
hunkered down in the dilapidated couches scribbling furiously throughout the
performances.

OK, so that's it, save the stuff I missed (Thursday and Friday at Other
Minds: Alvin Lucier, more Margaret Leng Tan, Sam Rivers (!) and Julian
Priester (!); Norman Fischer's Saturday afternoon reading at the Attic Club)
and the stuff for which I was present in body but not in mind (i.e.,
Sikelianos at SPT - my apologies again). Maybe someone else will have some
recollection of these?

My best to all you folks in Poetics land,
Taylor Brady, once and future lurker

I'm not so easily silenced. If it weren't for
transgressive writing practices that dare to speak the
unspeakable, much of contemporary literature wouldn't be
worth reading. See, for example, Dodie Bellamy's _The
Letters of Mina Harker_. Thank goodness she didn't shut
up. And class for god's sake is one of the unspeakable,
unnameable issues in American culture.

Pamela: A Novel
by Pamela Lu

Atelos is pleased to announce the publication of Pamela: A Novel, by Pamela
Lu.=20

About the book:=20
        Although widely known as a poet, Pamela Lu=92s first full-length=
 book
is a prose work, situated somewhere between autobiography and novel.
Writing in Poetry Flash, Katy Lederer says of it, =93Lyrical in both its
intent and intensity, Lu=92s story swiftly takes its reader to the heart of=
 a
poetic ambivalence told through the figures of self, love, and art.=94 The
result is an extended social portrait recalling Gertrude Stein=92s studies=
 of
language, habit, and character. The central figure of Pamela: A Novel is
the brilliantly intelligent narrator P and the =93plot=94 turns around her
examination of her own narrative. This narrative, meanwhile, consists of an
intricate structure of encounters, relationships, and stories; out of them
P is created and in them her avatar, Pamela, is embodied.
        For Lu, =93oppositional structures within terms of identity and
location=97here/there, us/them, professional/vocational,
culture/subculture=97...open the space of the social and philosophical=
 world=94
(Lytle Shaw, Poetics Journal 10). As P presses on into this world, her
insights=97her philosophizings amidst the real=97are subtle and often=
 perfectly
comedic.

About the author:=20
        Pamela Lu grew up in Southern California and attended the
University of California, Berkeley. She is one of the editors of Idiom and
now lives in San Francisco. Pamela: A Novel is her first book.

About the Atelos project:
        Atelos was founded in 1995 as a project of Hip=92s Road. It is
devoted to publishing, under the sign of poetry, writing which challenges
the conventional definitions of poetry, since such definitions have tended
to isolate poetry from intellectual life, arrest its development, and
curtail its impact. All the works published as part of the Atelos project
are commissioned specifically for it, and each is involved in some way with
crossing traditional genre boundaries, including, for example, those that
would separate theory from practice, poetry from prose, essay from drama,
the visual image from the verbal, the literary from the non-literary, and
so forth. The Atelos project when complete will consist of 50 volumes;
Pamela: A Novel is volume 4. The project directors and editors are Lyn
Hejinian and Travis Ortiz; the director for production and design is Travis
Ortiz.


Ordering information:
        Pamela: A Novel may be ordered from Small Press Distribution, 1341

...and is probably worth knowing, though I guess by the tone of your post
he's not the most charismatic guy.  I don't know what's happening in Miami
these days, and it's great to hear about caravans of poets crossing
timelines in the South -- sounds very interesting and fresh -- so if any of
you do get around to visiting this archive I'd love to hear about it.
Here's the URL for their website:

And here's the first paragraph on the site:

Ruth and Marvin Sackner founded the Archive in Miami Beach, Florida in
1979. Its initial mission was to
establish a collection of books, critical texts, periodicals, ephemera,
prints, drawings, collages, paintings,
sculptures, objects, manuscripts, and correspondence dealing with
precursory and contemporary,
internationally produced, concrete and visual poetry. The precursory
material had at its starting point,

=92s poem, "Un Coup de Des" (Cosmopolis, 1897). The historic
 antecedents included
works with concrete/visual poetic sensibilities from such twentieth cen=
tury
 art movements as Italian
Futurism, Russian and Eastern European Avant Garde, Dada, Surrealism,
Bauhaus, De Stijl, Ultra,
Tabu-Dada, Lettrisme, and Ultra-Lettrisme.

PS Does anyone have Augusto de Campos's mailing address (or e-mail
address).  I owe him some books -- he generously sent me a few of his,
which are expensive and multicolored, so I wanted to bung a few his way=
 but
 discarded the envelope.  Thanks...

Were the poems in Oppen's _Alpine: Poems_ (Mount Horeb, WI: Perishable
Press, 1969) incorporated in the 1975 Collect Poems?

Does anyone know the contents of _Alpine_ (regardless of their
incorporation)?

I'm hoping that someone out there knows in order to spare me the time of an
interlibrary loan (really I'm hoping that they're in the _Collected_ by I
suspect they aren't....).

Thank you in advance for any help.

Confessive-Repulsive Disorder


Says Jennifer, which is exactly what I have - she should know, I'm wearing
her dirty panties... Ah well... These are notes from _all over._ Jennifer
can't stand the fact I'm writing all the time. I find it yummy. But it's a
disorder, disorderly - my life's a mess. I'm a piece of shit.

In those painting crits, I tell her, I'm always reminded of other people's
work - _this_ painting surrounded by flows and images which inundate it -
just like this editor, interrupted by incoming. I'm made entirely out of
such information - call it _composition,_ call it fresh-woman composition.
Call it fresh-man.

The sea of images and the sea of imaginaries. But this is crazy. Guilt at
being part of the war-machine, hopeless and decomposed - nothing stops it
but arbitrary actions by arbitrary old white men. Their white is the color
of death. Their cocks are violent and filled with poison. They shit on
themselves because they can't help it so they clean the rest of the world.
The mouths of the rest of the world are filled with missiles. They starve
to death with metal shit. Don't forget how a bomb works: it expands.

They have no imaginary. They have to make everything real. They have to
make everything hard. They are hard workers. They fuck metal with metal.

I will push the dirty panties up into my hole. I will enjoy myself. I will
show you everything at a big party. You will see me and touch me and hear
me and smell me. I am yours forever.

Every five years in this big world of ours, there is nothing to write any-
more. Every thousand, there are no readers.

Alan

Just went to a talk the other day on Carolyn Chute and class. And then
all the talk post-pagemothers on class. It is worrying me. The reason we
as a society have trouble talking about class is that it is endlessly
complicated. It is hard to quantify, much less smell or generalize about
preferences of roughness or smoothness. Once we start to act like it is
something that can be called out in the language of clear category (that
academic means middle or whatever), we do class the disservice of
assuming it is an easy marker. Even though our society, falsely, treats
race or gender as something absolute, it has never treated class that
way. Yet that class is the language that white people at times use to
assert their marginalization makes me nervous about it all the time.

Yet I also think it is crucial to talk about all the time (who knows it
might lead to the class revolution). So I am grateful for the
discussion.

I guess my question is how do we talk about class while paying attention
to how many people pass in both directions all the time? How do we talk
about class and make room for the way some people move up and down it
all the time? Is class growing up background? Or is it net income at
current year? And what are the income levels? Or is it purely cultural?
Is there a lower class culture of dirty shirts and beer drinking that
the Chute talk seemed to suggest? An upper class culture that owns
artyness? How does rural and urban play into this? What about marriage
and wives with no income? Does education disqualify one from being lower
class? Does one's academic job disqualify one from being lower class
anymore? What if you are an adjunct? Does one's Yale undergrad degree on
scholarship disqualify? Or if one grows up upper class yet goes to the
local community college, does that change?

Like those students who can't understand My Life, I really can't imagine
that their background income is that different from Hejinian's--her
father was an academic administrator (a decent but not the best paying
job), her mother a housewife. The New College, where she worked until
recently, is known for its substandard salaries. She doesn't have an
advanced degree. What is making her the symbol for middle (?) classness
to these students? Is it because she doesn't in My Life put her self
forward as a marginalized subject?

I mean these questions not as critique but just as questions. I am glad
this discussion has been happening.

NUAGES ROSES

<<au-dessus de la rage des canons longs>>
                    Senghor/Niedecker

c'était le cri
douze mille mots le même
mon amie, comment
entendrai-je ta voix
livrée aux courants
électriques les morts
et les terres hautes des morts
dans ma case vide de sens
dix ans dans la grimace
des heures dans l'impatience
des heures dans le délire
des heures il y a des heures
pour souffrir dans l'étreinte
du combat tous les heures d'illusions
et les débris d'idées tu m'as dit
d'arbres après la canonnade
les édifices elles m'ont parlé
de l'Absente d'où naître
l'équilibre, ton visage que je recomposais
le sel était de sang par quels
chemins de sel de souffrance
acceptée le baiser qui franchit
les frontières quand passe
l'aile d'acier sur notre empire
en nous comme une citadelle
une promesse un royaume entrevu
auprès de toi j'ai retrouvé
troi cents kilomètres les escadres
aériennes cet ordre de bataille
cette ligne d'acier et de feu
où tonnent de grandes déchirures
de métal sous les bombes sur
la seconde de l'éclair à la sueur
lourde dans tes bras tes seins
et tes pouvoirs les légendes
d'or des nuits nuptiales
et foudroyant les capitales
le long des chemins de guerre
dans le regard des fièvres
des cadences écoute camarades
des siècles d'incendie
écoute quand glissent glacées d'azur
les ailes leurs voiles déployées
et les mythes autour de moi mutilées
au choc des mitrailleuses la vérité
la beauté c'est l'ouvrier brisant
le calme meurtrier de leurs salons
donne-moi tes maines calleuses
et lourdes toi qui luttes pour le repos
de l'autre dans l'Avril d'un autre
ce chant constellé de l'éclatement du combat
chant immense au milieu de mille ruts
couché dans l'ivresse de la moisson mûre
vois le sang de mes mains dites-moi
si ton sang ne s'est-il mêlé
comme le lait et le pain bis du paysan
dans ses mains si calleuses
chaque goutte répandue est une pointe
de feu:  ils m'ont dit, danse
pour nous j'ai dansé pour eux
et ils ont ri j'ai travaillé
pour eux et ils ont ri, ils m'ont dit
va mourir pour nous mais j'ai donné
la main aux parias de l'ordure
à fleur de l'âme je serai la mouette
la morte par danser toujours
à rebours la chanson le vin bu
me ramenait à cette autre certitude
elle proclame l'attente amoureuse
elle proclame l'émoi qui fait tremble le corps
elle proclame ton baiser plus fort
que la mort par les routes captives
le long routes du désastre, balles
des chiens dans les halliers noirs
fils du lion qui rugit dans le dos creux
est-ce sa faute si Dieu lui a demandé
de tes cris sa voix bleue dans l'air
lavé de haine dans la fièvre de ce printemps
ils ouvrent leurs ailes et chantent
des Te Deum en latin pies-corbeaux
a ceux qui s'engraissent de meurtres
et mesurent en cadavres les étapes
de leur règne se rejoignent dans la ligne
droite du combat, luttes homériques
sur le roc la Cité de demain le don
de la promise que se lève la nuit
du sexe se désintègre la syntaxe
chante le diamant qui naît des cendres
nous sommes là ensemble comme avant
mon pays de sel et ton pays de neige
chante à l'unisson et ce fut honneur
à mon nom ouvrez ma chair, ma chevelure
mon sperme réel pour t'aimer à jamais
mon corps s'abandonne à toi rends-moi
insensé par d'innombrables moi cuivre et zinc
à mon flanc ici leurs clameurs malheur
ton sexe sont devenus les armes du réel
NUAGES ROSES SUR LES ÉPAULES DES HIBISCUS
écoute-la sous le délire de ton sexe
qui coupe le souffle à mes narines
j'ai besoin je le sais de ton savoir
nous serons encore là toi et moi
comme avant qui donnent de l'allure
l'amour dans ces cuisses dévoilées
au solstice de Juin, comme dans l'an
de la défaite et dans l'an de l'espoir
au destin je veux être un théâtre
dans la parole de l'Absente qui règne

The mention of Dorothy Allison was in the context of defining class,
referring to her
essays on the subject, rather than the grittiness of her fiction. I was
thinking more of
the general lack of grit in poetry magazines on the Lang end of the spectrum
rather than of individuals (not a blanket criticism; I love a lot of what's
called language
poetry). And since I haven't done a study of individual writers' class
backgrounds, my
conclusions are mostly of the gut-reaction sort. It would be really
interesting to me if
someone did a study to see if my theory holds true. So in that vein, here are
a few
more unsubstantiated ideas for some academically inclined person to
investigate:

I have the strong impression that among those of us in the nth generation of
"innovative" poetry, people who identify more with the working class or poor
tend to
lean a little more toward the New York (Berrigan) school and those from the
middle
class are more likely to lean toward Langpo.

More: that "rough" writing seems more acceptable as avant garde fiction than
as avant garde poetry and that people from the middle class who like gritty
writing are
rebelling specifically against those middle-class norms that I mentioned
(i.e., smoothing over the rough, hushing the noise, taming the emotions.)
Which is why I think Bukowski is so popular. His writing is a direct
repudiation of the myth of "the
American dream": Life is tough, awkward, painful, dirty, and often beyond our
control.
Even Bukowski's obnoxious sexism is, in part, his challenge to the 50's view
of the
dainty little (middle class, white) woman "on a pedestal." As an added bonus
for many from the lower classes, his characters are familiar. You say to
yourself, "Yeah, I _know_ that person. That could be ol' Dave." You know the
nuances of their home
life, how their kitchens smell, their social behavior, their accents. And
this is important when you're constantly being discounted or erased by
mainstream society and its literature.

Geez, how did I get onto Bukowski? Anyhow, I hope this gives y'all somethin'
to chew on.

hi Maria & Chris --

I had the same reaction as Chris, and a similar pang of be-little
peoplement -- it wasn't at all clear that what I was getting myself into in
agreeing to give a paper was also a bill.  Is the practice so common that it
goes without saying, either on the form, or on the part of the organizers?
Too add insult to naivete (or whatever it is that lead me to think
presenting was 'enough'), those who lately got a whiff of the coffee have to
pay a 'late fee' totalling $50 for the 2 days  (whereas w/student id my fee
would have been less than half that) -- granted this IS NOT the MLA, but a
small conference with a mixture of profs, grad students, and poets & critics
otherwise affilitated, would you say this is the going fare?

At this point though I'm wondering how much I'll even grumble under my
breath when I hand over the plastic (I hope they take plastic!) -- because
it looks to be an interesting weekend.  Your panel by the way chris is on my
too see list.

BUT if you chris see a way out of this (other than except maybe assuming a
posture of personal insult when asked to pay at the registration table), you
know that here's another who was duped.

Well, I accept that, Mark.  I associate sniffing with the ferreting out of
undesirables. Your association sounds friendlier: a little like the
agreement on boundaries, achieved as a result of an impressive
dispersal of urine, between a man and a wolf in a recent movie
I saw.

I would be a hopeless stoop-sitter:  So you're the man and you're
the wolf .... or is the other way round ... you're a bit of a wolf and a
bit of a man ... well you both piss don't you .... I'm sorry, I get
confused ... now you're the man, no the wolf, I have it, I swear I have
you pegged, you're a were-wolf, isn't that right ... now which of you
writes the poetry, is it yourself Mr. Wolf ...?

Oh well.

There's an interview up with poet Wang Ping that may be of interest to
people on this list.  You'll find it on the WriteNet site at

http://www.writenet.org/poetschat/poetschat_wping.html

In the interview, Wang Ping talks about her poem "Syntax."
She also discusses how speakers of English as a Second Language can write
good poems in English without worrying too much about grammar and syntax.
As usual, Teachers & Writers Collaborative encourages you to bring her
poem into your classroom and share it with your students.  National Poetry
Month or not National Poetry Month.

By the way, I am trying to trace the origin of a story re: Frank O'Hara
where O'Hara, responding to the question "What do you think of Dylan
Thomas," responded "I can't stand all that Welsh spit."  Does anyone know
if this story is true, and if it is documented anywhere?

Yes yes yes! These questions are very good. Very smart. I have only
started thinking about class myself--I have been somewhat sheltered as a
grad student who went from Daddy's support to "Government Loan Support",
and am now starting to get a good dose of reality.

I told my friend the other day that I think about class every time I go
to the laundromat.

I might argue that class is an ever-shifting thing. I came from an
upper-middle-class background. Grew up in Silicon Valley, Dad works at
Intel, Mom has acrylic nails and hardwood floors. 4 bedroom, 3 car
garage. I'm finding that many people make assumptions about my class
based on my parents' class--for instance, when my 11-year-old car broke
down again, someone asked my why my Dad didn't buy me a new one. My Dad
NEVER bought me a car.

Anyway, I use these as examples and not because I'm whiny and
bitter--not the case. I'm still "new" in how I think about it. I wonder,
is this because I am of the generation that will not do as "well" as our
parents? I wonder if I have "inherited" the class sensibilities of my
parents--I certainly have had to undo the materialistic side of it. I
might have inherited class, but I certainly haven't inherited any money
to back it up.

I am also intrigued by Kathy's "sniffing." It's such a great word--I
think it's associations are what makes people find it distasteful. I
would love for Kathy to elaborate on that act of sniffing. Though I
don't think so, I wonder if sniffing and assumptions are the same. Dare
I say, as a straight white person, that some minority/marginalized
individuals have placed assumptions on me--they have assumed my
politics, have assumed my stance? I'm not denying that I walk around
with a certain amount of priviledge.

Well, yes, class is shifting. I wonder if the gripe should be about
capitalism and how corporations value (or don't value) employees,
individuals, etc. What are we really worth? What is my work worth? My
time?

Sorry for getting off those questions--

The William Blake Archive <http://www.iath.virginia.edu/blake/> is
pleased to announce the publication of two new electronic editions of
Blake's satiric masterpiece, _The Marriage of Heaven and Hell_. They are
of copies C and F, both of which are in the Pierpont Morgan Library.

_Marriage_ copy C, printed in 1790 in green ink on both sides of the
leaf, was printed and colored in the style of early copies of _Songs of
Innocence_. It has not been reproduced in color before.  _Marriage_ copy
F was beautifully and heavily color printed on one side of the leaf
(with copy E) in c. 1794. It was produced in the style used for _Songs
of Experience_ of _Songs of Innocence and of Experience_ copy F, color
printed in 1794 and recently published in the Archive, as well as for
_Visions of the Daughters of Albion_ copy F, also in the Archive.

_Marriage_ is the only illuminated book Blake did not sign and date; he
did, however, pen in "1790" over line 1 in plate 3 of copy F, thereby
clarifying the plate's allusion to 1757 ("and it is now thirty-three
years since its advent"), the year of the Last Judgment, according to
Swedenborg, and of Blake's birth.

Copies C and F join _Marriage_ copy D, already in the Archive. Copy D,
the Lessing J. Rosenwald copy in the Library of Congress, is also of
bibliographical interest, in that it was printed in c. 1795 as part of a
set of illuminated books that were printed on folio-size paper. This
large-paper set also included _America_ copy A, _All Religions are One_
copy A, _There is No Natural Religion_ copy L, and _The Book of Thel_
copy F, all of which are in the Archive. It also included _Visions of
the Daughters of Albion_ copy G, _The First Book of Urizen_ copy B,
_Europe_ copy H, and _Songs of Innocence and of Experience_ copy R, all
of which will enter the Archive within the next six months.

We now have thirty-one copies of sixteen illuminated books in the
Archive.  In addition to the books, we recently opened a new wing of the
Archive, consisting of an extensive array of supporting materials: an
updated and expanded Plan of the Archive, a statement of Editorial
Principles and Methodology, a summary of the Archive's technical design
and implementation, and a list of Frequently Asked Questions. Our hope
is that these extensive documentary materials will prove valuable both
to our own growing user community as well as to scholars interested in
the theory and practice of electronic editing more generally.

Defining "Class" is one of those places that cultural studies folks can be
helpful. Here's one of the ur-cultstuds, E.P. Thompson, in the preface to
his monumental _The Making of the English Working Class_: "If we stop
history at a given point, then there are no classes but simply a multitude
of individuals with a multitude of experiences. But if we watch these
men over an adequate period of social change, we observe patterns in their
relationships, their ideas, and their insititutions.  Class is defined by
men as they live their own history, and, in the end, this is its only
definition."  EPT, _TMEWC_, 1963). And of course, now women are given
credit for living their own history too.
        My guess is that one of the problems with dealing with class in
the US is the ahistorical if not amnesiac quality of American culture.
There are others, too, obviously.
        In any case, for what it's worth. . .

All this Kosovo stuff saddens me. The class stuff too. People with all the
answers, who want to become famous. I am disappointed that my posts don't get
posted the rare times I attempt. 1 out 3 is subtracted. I tried to say that I
am a vegetarian and don't know the first thing about pacifism. And how do you?

This list feels very over fished to me. Maybe it's me but, "the writing
community" does not feel even room temperature. I am not interested in battle
of the bands style poetry readings.

I work for a boss at nonprofit literary arts center that hates me, the harder
I work. He screams at me. If I were a secretary in real job maybe I could sue
him. I think how we treat each other is more important than being a star.
Except for a small handful of people, this air conditioned boat leaves me
cold and adrift in academic name dropping. And I am not jealous, just wishing
for more heat. Respect for other peoples opinions does not mean necessarily
agreeing. So here I am listening and attempting to participate.

That strikes me as more revealing about the class of the person who asked
that question than about you. But that would depend on the tone of the
question, too.

I like this thread about class, and what many people have said.

I wonder, though, for those who think class shows through a poet's writing,
does it also show through an artist's work, and has this changed over time?
For example, can one tell from Van Gogh's sunflowers anything about the
class of the artist? Or from Matisse's interiors. Or from a contemporary
visual artist's work -- Susan Bee's? or Agnes Denis's? Or is class more
specifically inscribed in language arts?

I don't have the answers to these questions -- just wondering what others
think about them.

There are many for you.  Can that I ably motivate them
in my head.  A shrub of many leaves surrounded by the
sensate flora.  Expelling from eager memory, decline for
the real trip, the uplight all to back of the bodies.  Your
hands on his body.

We have been exchanged.  Your hands simply to touch, words
that matter having our translation.  Care.  Brotherfriends
facing maximum harried brain.

Can we hear about this a little louder.  Proposal dreamt
& encouraged.  You are the several living support.  If
we don't want it in our bodies, then we must bend and
linger with that taste in mind, depend memories over bodies.

In every redness dust the cloud frantic potion of the
scene.  After tugging the river nervous system for our
road walked directions, in alone the rising lake, & the
population bearings of the mercantile city.

We are out rooms.

I enter my mental device.

Dear Poetics,

Sending below some info on a project I've been working on since 1994.
Glad to finally have it ready for the world.  As a way to encourage quick
movement of text from one place to another, the publishers are waiving
postage fees on orders received before 5/1/99.  If you are at all
interested in Brathwaite or Mackey, this book is well worth a look!

Kamau Brathwaite's ConVERSations with Nathaniel Mackey is based on the
transcript of his 1993 public discussion with Nathaniel Mackey at Poet's
House in New York City.  Brathwaite expansively elaborates on Mackey's
(and audience's) knowledgeable inquiries; his answers are layered with
subsequent ruminations arising from his lifelong engagement with world
literature and expressive cultures.  A multiphasic drift, ConVERSations
with Nathaniel Mackey combines elements of biography and autobiography
with poetic discourse on Caribbean literary history and negative effects
of colonial domination.  In this book, Brathwaite, a recent recipient of
the prestigious Casas de las Americas prize, splices dialog with poetry,
criticism, and instructive imaginary voices in his now distinct and
characteristic "Sycorax 'video style'" format.  It is a valuable resource
for either writer's work and for scholarship on African dispora art and
literature.

Jessica's post gives me a good chance to address an issue that's
plagued me since having taken on the position of list moderator
in January; and while this is not the most opportune time for me
personally to respond (I have to get to work), I wanted neither
to hold her post or to let it go without some kind of reply.
     What's been troubling to me is this quandry: how to acknowledge
publically the ideological limits of this space, or rather to assert
my own position as arbiter of the list (a word I use pointedly) in
attempting to facilitate the specific exchange and debate for which
this space was intended from its inception; and in particular how to
do so without approaching the destructive anti-dialogue that consumed
the list towards the end of last year - for I can't help but think
that what I'm preparing here are the means by which I will be accused
not only of censoring "discussion" on the list, but of censoring
discussion of list censorship and so forth ad nauseum. Which in fact
is, ultimately, the very point of my address.

I'm not even sure this is the best time to broach this topic - there
is, however distantly for most Americans, a war on.

What follows is an adapted version of a post sent previously to a
subscriber, in response to his/her objection to my decision not to
forward a one-sentence post. This is not quite the manner in which
I had wanted to address this matter (I have other, prepared material
elsewhere), but it is what I have on-hand at the moment.

        Chris


P.S., not wanting to sound singlularly cheerless, I should also
say that my remarks here pertain to "discussion"-oriented posts
of a relatively "straightforward" manner, and not to poems or
other kinds of other writing. (And, being someone who attempts to
push my own poetry in the direction of criticism, rather than
maintaining such a discretion, I realize that there are problems
with all of these terms, esp. and above all the distinction
between poems and other posts.)


-@-

        The ideological limits of this list - which is explicitly
and acknowledgedly an ideological space - are laid out in the
Welcome Message that is sent to all subscribers.

Among other requested and sometimes enforced (again, using the
word acknowledgedly) guidelines to the list, you will find that
I've said this is a list primarily designed to address poetry and
poetics, occasionally to address political issues. You may notice,
though it is not there stated because not rigorously adhered-to,
that the explicitly political material I forward generally relates
to an "immediate" situation, e.g., the current war or NATO/US
involvement in such.

        You will also find that I ask of subscribers to post
relatively considered and even extensive statements, opinions,
etcetera, and not single lines or single sentences - a position
I am willing to stand by so long as I have the energy, which is
not always. Unfortunately the limits of this list are also to
some extent the limits of my time and energy, since without
further support from SUNY Buffalo (and beyond that institution,
Gov. Pataki and the state legislature etc.) I do this job more
or less on my own.

Now in those instances where a subscriber has taken the time to
articulate a position, and I mean in a considered manner, and
especially though not necessarily in relation to a poetics, I
have consistently forwarded those posts to the list. This could
be said of even a paragraph or a few lines. On the other hand,
I simply do not consider a single line, and one whose challenge
lies more in its tone than its position, to be such an articulation;
and so in this and other instances I have generally not forwarded
said post to the list.

If you want to challenge this list on the basis of aesthetic,
political or ethical practice, that's fine with me - even though
I don't see the particular relevance of *this* statement to this
(poetics) list. But I simply must ask that you do so in a way
that will provoke consideration or sustained argumentation, and
not in an off-hand comment which will provoke more of the like
or be simply ignored. I might add that this would be to the benefit
of your position, as it may be to the benefit of the list.

This list is not a list of my opinions. I happen to disagree
or even in some cases have no developed sense of the issues
that are "discussed" here (though note that my own position
would be to discard the "conversational" tropes that surround
the list). But I do consider it my job to maintain this list
in a form that, to whatever extent possible, furthers concrete
and serious consideration of the issues at hand - even due
seriousness of fooling around, when that happens.

If this is censorship, as indeed it may be characterized, then
I will own that charge in saying (again) this absolutely is an
ideological space, as regards form and content. And so are all
other spaces, however unacknowledgedly.

        sincerely, Chris

No space is free.
It takes not only moderators but sysadmins to make it go.
People's labor is volunteered or paid for.
The machines are often built with underpaid labor.
The routers are maintained with paid labor.
A great deal of the Net still runs on free-offered services.
To be on a list is a privilege, not a right.
Someone starts the list with some sort of intentions.
Someone signs up on a list because it seems of interest.
It is easier than ever to start new lists.
Lists can now be tailored to the slightest innuendo.
All lists have subtextual censoring issues.
There will be questions about child pornography, for example.
All lists are circumscribed.
There will be questions about libel and slander.
It takes only one person with minimal effort to permanently derail a list.
The greater the governance, the greater the labor involved.
There is no solution to communication.

Given that there is a war on, what should be our response?
Should all of our texts be geared to that response?
Should all of our texts be geared to class issues?
To reification or recognition of class, war, race, gender, religion?
Has there ever been in this sense a space for writing?

I think Chris is right to post a letter about his role as moderator of
the List, even if I think he should be less worried about how members
will react to the power that comes with that role.

In response to his post, I want to suggest a couple of topics that might
be addressed by those who have taken a serious interest in this forum.

- What sort of post does the medium tend to encourage? Are there common
pitfalls that might be specified and so more easily avoided?

- Ought we to be more conscious of the modes of writing/thought
presented on the List, and would it make sense to address these matters
in terms of specific posts? (This would mean sometimes commenting not on
the content of a post so much as the kind of thinking it represents.)

- What sorts of post tend to be valuable for us as readers? What sorts
less so?


I personally would answer these questions by saying that there does seem
to be something in the medium that encourages unconsidered
contributions. I would argue against the writing of unsupported
statements: "I find this book unconvincing." When I came onto the List,
I had the idea that I might begin an exchange on something that
interests me particularly at the moment: literary translation. I would
expect me posts to be deleted by those who take no interest in the
matter (or who think I'm a dolt), but what I would expect from those who
do take an interest and don't think I'm a dolt is TIME. I stopped
writing because, with a few exceptions, I felt that I was putting in a
lot more than I was getting back. Whether a response was enthusiastic or
critical, I often had the impression that while I had spent a half an
hour or more on composing something that seemed to me worth reading, the
responses were dashed off in a couple of minutes. This may, I know, be
entirely due to my not having, if fact, succeeded in composing something
interesting, even for those engaged with the topic. But I suspect that I
did manage to interest a few people - and did in fact elicit one very
interesting response from Pierre Joris.
Nobody would read a journal whose contributors were known to spend no
more than five or ten minutes on their pieces; while the potential
immediacy of EXCHANGE in this kind of format is clearly a bonus. My
estimation would be that those of us writing to the List should move
closer to the concentration implied by the former format, and try to
work against the seemingly perpetual thrill of the immediate in and of
itself.

One further point, as to content: if there were more posts on the
negative effects of football on the American psyche, I would
unsubscribe. This is not to say anything about the intellectual quality
of the discussion that took place around this topic, but only to say
that I, for one, am looking for something else here.

Dear Maria,
Like you, my interest is in poetry and cultural studies. I agree with most
of what you say in your recent post.  Except maybe our spirits are
different.  You seem charging and charged, determined and probably
effective too.  I have begun to feel that academic life in America is
structured to inhibit political action or involvement, even at a local
level.  It is my experience here (5 years and two towns) that colleges and
universities are cut off from their local matrix, intellectually though
not economically.  When I look back, I remember students with a
lot of political attitude, but no actual political involvement with their
immediate environment: the town or city in which they were living.
For myself, I was and am connected to "my" town through my children, who
go to school here, or daycare.  Yet I am not active in the PTA or on the
board of the Drop-In Center, nor am I active anywhere else, except as a
reader in the various libraries.  I am a graduate student and college
lecturer: this combination (which is the most common for all graduate
students in the cultural studies field, though some may be called T.A.s
rather than lecturers) is fairly gruelling and inexorable over a
considerable number of years.  Throw in another engagement with poetry:
writing it, and you screw things up a bit.  Throw in a family, and the
pitch is a notch higher still.  But even the grad school/T.A. tandem seems
destructive.  My experience of grad school was one of an extremely
structured, controlled, pointless, and time-wasting classes which I was
obliged to both take and teach.  Even now, when I have greater freedom,
the continual scraping necessary to get by on the time and money available
seriously inhibits political involvement -- or *any* sort of serious
activity, including writing and thinking.  My question is (after all
that): am I completely paranoid in thinking that the academic system here
is actually set up to prevent people thinking, to inhibit engagement with
anything outside the academy, and to keep students/graduate students in a
state of "near-death" until they actually *are* near death and
pensionable?  This paragraph is a bit rough but I hope you will get the
general idea.
All the best,
Mairead

Margaret Randall wrote a book about women, class, and money not too long ago,
and her observation most interesting to me was women are more socially mobile
than men. (If we marry, we must or choose to adopt the class of the man.  We
outlive our husbands.  Divorce usually only changes the class of the woman.
Alone, we're outside the rankings.)  Paul Fussell has a quiz in his book
about class which ends up being about decorating.  Shortcut the quiz:  if you
read in a foreign language, and have books everywhere, you're upper class.

I was just in Chicago for my (working class) grandmother's funeral:  my
immediate family is called "hoity toity" by the remainder of the family.
That we went to college is only the easy answer.  We're members of different
classes.  My parents are middle class.  My sister and I are upper middle
class.  My fiance is outside the rankings but raised in Section 8 housing.  I
have cousins who are have doctorates, but they are 1) male, 2) not upper
middle class.  Class is a wonderment, a construct:  less about income or
capital and more about what I am going to call "the conversation of the
house".

Social mobility is made easier by generational rebellion, which is hampered
by felt or actual financial or social responsibilities for people in the
house.  This influences the accessibility of writing, the relationship to
audience, everything to do with the personal history a writer has with her
writing.

I would suggest that some of the feelings my working class friends and I have
about money and scholarship and writing are derived from family and social
responsibilities, not class.  Unfortunately, these responsibilities are
gender-based, and the less desirable your American class "totem pole", the
more gender-based these are.

The perception of class (I believe "smell" is being used here) then comes
from a personal history with this conversation.  Education, culture, and
attitudes toward gender are all useful pointers.  Women in this country are
still not allowed as much education as men, yet are expected to perform a
great deal of cultural work free of charge, by which I mean, cultural work
which does not accrue for the woman.

Regards,
Catherine Daly
cadaly@aol.com

P.S.  Many female experimentalists are military brats, interesting since
soldiers, sailors, pilots, et.al., are socially and physically mobile.  I
would argue that academics are also socially and physically mobile (until
tenured).

P.P.S.  Some sort of pun about mobile homes.

The massive air strikes against Yugoslavia do not only
destroy army installations. They also take human lives and ruin the
economic infrastructure of our impoverished country. In the long run,
howeveateral damage will be the shattered possibilities for de cracy

will be a permanent state of emergency, legal and spiritual, this
time with the support of the bewildered majority, which
has always sided with the government in terms of extreme adversity
and danger.  Democratic and economic transition in  Serbia is the
only real cure for the Kosovo problem and hope for achieving

community' s long-standing policy towards Serbia, which has
been exclusively based on negotiating with Mr. Milosevic and
pressuring him to deliver peace.
There will be no real peace and stability in the region and there
will certainly be no peace in Yugoslavia unless Serbia embarks on the
road to democracy and market economy. However, it appears that

Chris:

I used to be quite active on this List (an understatement,
perhaps), but since the big arguments of a few months back I've
relegated my involvement to reading the archives now and then. I just
read your post in response to Jessica Pompeii's very interesting
message, including the addendum of your reply to another subscriber
wherein you acknowledge, with laudable candor, the "ideological"
character of the Poetics List. But Ideology, you assure us, has never
kept you from forwarding posts that "provoke consideration or
sustained argumentation."

Since you have opened discussion around the issue of List
"moderation," please accept this post as an honest attempt to provoke
consideration around a specific matter that has troubled me.
Please understand that I do not offer these concerns in the spirit of
starting another round of angry accusation, which I admit having
contributed to when the controversy was at its height. I am simply
asking for clarification so as to better form my overall opinion
about the List's transformation, and I hope you or Charles Bernstein
will be able to offer a response.

So here, in the form of a few pointed questions, is my concern:
Does the enactment of the List's "ideological character" mandate, in
addition to your daily surveillance of posts, the denial of
subscription rights to certain poets? More specifically, are there
poets who were previously members of this List who have indeed been
denied subscription? If this is not the case, then I apologize for
being misinformed, and I hope to soon see again, for example, the
provocative and thoughtful posts of Henry Gould, who seems to be
under the impression (at least when I spoke to him in Providence a
couple months ago) that he is _not_ permitted to rejoin the List.

So what, after all, is the story? If it _is_ the case that certain
people have been, so to speak, B92ed from the List, could you
explain exactly why? Now that the List is a self-conscious and
self-proclaimed ideological space enjoying the benefits of a
benevolent panopticism, one effectively designed to keep discussions
"on track" and to squelch any drift toward "over-posting," what would
be the rationale for banishing someone as passionately committed
to the art of poetry (however idiosyncratic one might judge his
aesthetic commitments to be) as Henry Gould? Or, for example,
for excluding Gabriel Gudding, who could easily be prevented under
the new rules from airing anything undiplomatically critical, but who
might be allowed to share, here and there, the gift of his mordant
intelligence?

All in all, IF it is true that there have been poets "ideologically"
excluded from List membership, isn't it actually the case, Chris and
Charles, that you ARE, in practice, preventing posts that might
"provoke consideration or sustained argumentation" from coming to the
List's attention? Now that a center of authority and control is
clearly established, why not invite _all_  poets to submit their
"considered argumentation" to the moderator's deliberation? There
may, of course, be those who will not wish to participate under such
conditions, but it certainly can't hurt to make the gesture.

If my questions here are in any way informed by faulty assumptions, I
ask you to please post this anyway and then publicly point out my
misconceptions. I know that other people share these concerns with
me, and so a simple clarification would be a positive thing, even if
my error should bring me some embarrassment. Thank you.

Brilliant, David!

I'd like to weigh in for [where does *that* expression come from?]

LIPSYNCH POETRY for extemporaneous & antiquated (de-canonized, like St.
Christopher) verse;

MONOMETRICAL VERSE, in which all syllables receive either only stron or
weak stress;

IDEOGRAMMATICAL POETRY in which all glyphs ioncorporating faces
resolutely (& atypically) turn their backs to each other;

& BACKMASKICAL BARDOLATRY, which reads poets' publication credits (and
reviews of their works) backwards.

        I'd like to suggest that all taperecorders used for poetry readings
in the month of April be doctored so that upon being rewound and played
back even at full volume nothing can be heard except a faint diabolical
cackling (I believe this was done at least once in a trial run at UCSD).

In an alternative move, let's have the tapes be classified as blank but
when the machine is switched on & the Poet begins to read, the tape emits a
prerecorded, uninterruptible wall of words full volume for at least one
hour, during which all efforts to switch off or unplug the machine will
prove futile. That should put a stop to any threatened eruption of poetry
during this damnable month.

I had the same reaction as David Zauhar on this one: juliana's questions
address culture as much as they address class.  Cultural studies has always
insisted that culture is not the province of a particular class (privileged)
but that culture was a "whole way of life" -- that culture was 'mass' -- was
everywhere. (and class seems as pervasive.)  While this allowed for some
needed theorizing and intervention that revealed (and encouraged) a certain
amount of autonomy ('subversion') on the side of those who were denied
(high) culture (and so were denied 'class', were the underclass) -- it left
aside altogether the tricky questions of the production of 'mass culture' --
who produces it? who consumes it? and for what explicity purposes?  The same
can be asked of class.  And the answers in some instances will be identical.

juliana:
> Once we start to act like [class] is
>something that can be called out in the language of clear category (that
>academic means middle or whatever), we do class the disservice of
>assuming it is an easy marker.

The irony being that most modes of communication rely on our acting this
way, and the disservice is done in the service of 'fixing' one's class --
remediating. (for an interesting if not endlessly irritating essay on this
see "Freshman Composition as Middle Class Enterprise" by Lynn Z. Bloom)

what juliana points out is that class can't be talked about until its
cornered.  So here's a corner: it strikes me that class is maintained as an
economic category only to the extent that its inseparable from its visible,
material embodiment: commodities.  If posessions are markers of class, what
does that make words?  where does that leave writers?  Innovative writers
show us consistently that words are also material things, are not merely
referential (i.e. materialized when contrasted to the
conventional-and-so-transparent use of syntax, word and subject choice,
spelling, pronunication, which are also [middle] class markers ) -- and yet
innovative writing alone fails as 'subversive', fails to attack from the
margin (of race gender class etc.) because it is, finally, just made of
words.  It's the people, the movements, the little magazines and presses
that gather around and embody those words that make some sort of
intervention.

Class afterall is a heinous fiction that They/we maintain, that They/we
build into our material circumstances (our institutions) but its a fatal
fiction -- people die everyday for lack of the fictionality that is found
there.

I can't say I see class (as a problem, as a point of cleavage and meanness)
going away anytime soon but i'm glad too people are talking about it, and
perhaps maintaining the option that class (race gender etc.) is okay.

We are engaged in a project creating a hypertext edition of a book and have
run
into resistance from the publisher. If anyone knows of a citation that
supports
the argument that a web version of a book increases sales of the book itself,
or any similarly useful info for arguing this point, any suggestions would be
most welcome! Thanks ...

I teach high school art and math...and found that the math class (math
not being my favorite subject) went much better when I tossed some art
(which I love) into it. One day we did algebra problems exquisite
corpse-style. So: anyone have or know of any poems about or using or
related to math?

...about teaching: I've concluded that the best things I ever learned in
high school was how to find *joy* in a subject.

thanks,

You mention an interest in translation--I'm new to the list
& am working on a first but large translation project (Spanish
to English)--I'd be interested in hearing general +/- specific
ideas about this topic, unless it was done to death last
month.  Example:  I read an article that characterized
Dickinson's poetry as a "compensation" for failed
letter-writing, i.e. a compensation for the lost ideal of exact
correspondence.  Given that translation also seems to
presuppose a loss of some sort of exact correspondence,
is translation itself a compensatory mode?  When is it
useful to talk about intralingual translation as well as
interlingual translation?  & so forth.  & if anyone
can confirm that "murcielago" is commonly used in
Cuba to refer to someone who stays out all night partying,
I'd be interested in that too--

I am reading a book that I think would be important to all those who are
interested in this thread:  _Inequality Reexamined_ by Amartya Sen.  "Sen
argues that the dictum 'all people are created equal' serves largely to
deflect attention from the fact that we differ in age, gender, talents, and
physical abilities as well as in material advantages and social background.
He argues for concentraing on hight and more basic values: individual
capabilities and freedom to achieve objectives.  By concentrating on equity
and efficiency of social arrangements in promoting freedoms and
capabilities of individuals, Sen adds an important dimension to arguments
about such vital issues as gender inequalities, welfare policies,
affirmative action, and publich provision of health care and education.'

There seems to be some confusion between the two types of classes in the
messages as I read them in the past two days. Having a nice house and time
to get a manicure is a cultural bias and many working class women and men
in pink and white collar jobs like to be clean and neat, but are in no way
upper or ruling class. We as poets and academics and poet/academics have a
cultural class bias, but having books, etc is not an upper class
characteristic. There are many cultural classes and they are fungible and
are usually subject to an ideological stance that is annoying to other
cultural classes. There are also many mixed cultural classes, ie, people
with dirty hands and books or clean floors and only electronics or dirty
floors and electronics.

Among economic classes there are far fewer. Here ruling class is
appropriate to consider, but even within the ruling class there is pecking
order such as between Bill Gates and Bill Clinton. Being able to make
decisions for others is one of the prime motivators and characteristics of
ruling class ideology. Being able to plan the course of the lives of many
is also a motivator for ruling class or aspiring ruling class.

There are many cultural classes on this list, but only one or two economic
classes on this list, although some of us work more directly for ruling
class institutions, such as the teachers and corporate types. Those who do
not work for those kinds of institutions may still be of the same economic
class, but have different cultural biases.

I don't think anyone on this list is a member of the ruling class.
Although some have made some money or inherited enough to qualify, none of
us to my knowledge is working to direct the lives of thousands or making
decisions to control the course of many lives. We as artists have chosen a
path to control that is weak and indirect. That is we can't really
determine the effects of our work. But we still believe in the effect
poetry can have. We believe that poetry and other arts have an effect on
the lives of many indirectly by contributing to the way people talk and
think about themselves.

What would we like to contribute to that? How do we think we can best go
about it? If we can't exactly predict how our work will effect others,
what are the techniques of indirection that are most useful/effective in
getting to the kind of presentation we'd like to make while giving us the
best chance of gettting the kind of result we want. Do we want to promote
a metaphorical message or be exponents of it? I think most of the people
reading this list approach the message part metaphorically rather than
representing it directly as perscription. The metaphors are riskier than
many can imagine. Allen Ginsberg was one who found out the dangers of
metaphor after his metaphor had had its sad effects.

In closing I apologize for going so slowly, but read much that confused me
in the mails about class and thought this out as I wrote. In that way I
don't support the planned out approach to what should be on the list. It's
up to Chris, with input from all of us who are willing to contribute, to
come up with a functional definition of appropriateness.

MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII
Content-transfer-encoding: 7BIT

The following is taken from Z Net

http://www.lbbs.org/ZNETTOPnoanimation.html.

While a clearer acknowledgment of the long-standing repression
suffered by the Kosovar Albanians would have added much to the
balance of this "Myth Sheet," the points made are certainly
thought-provoking and prompt urgent questions about NATO's actions
and the motivations behind them.

Kent
----------------------------------------------

The US/NATO War in Yugoslavia: Five Myths

Myth #1. U.S./NATO had to attack "the Serbs" because the Yugoslav
government and President Slobodan Milosevic refused to negotiate on
Kosovo, a region of Yugoslavia where ethnic Albanians are the
majority.

Reality: U.S./NATO bombs are falling on all Yugoslavs: Serbians,
Montenegrins, Albanians, Hungarians, Romanis and other peoples who
make up the multiethnic Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. There were no
"negotiations." U.S. officials like Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright, went out of their way to make this point when "peace talks"
were held in France in February. Instead, there was an ultimatum
presented by the U.S. government to the Yugoslav government that had
three points: 1) Kosovo must be granted autonomy; 2) NATO must be
allowed to station 30,000 ground troops in Yugoslavia to ensure this
autonomy; and 3) A NATO-conducted referendum for Kosovo's independence
from Yugoslavia would take place within three years. The Yugoslav
government agreed to the first condition, and rejected the second and
third, saying they were a gross violation of their sovereignty and the
independence of their country.



Myth #2. Yugoslavia is the aggressor in this conflict and Milosevic is
a "new Hitler."

Reality: No Yugoslav soldiers, planes or ships are attacking another
country. The conflict in Kosovo is an internal issue. A developing
country of 10 million people, Yugoslavia is being attacked by 19
countries, including the biggest military powers in the world, which
have a combined population of more than half a billion people.
Milosevic has been demonized much like Saddam Hussein is. As a State
Department official said, "the demonization of Milosevic is necessary
to maintain the air attacks." (S.F. Chronicle, Mar. 30, 1999)



Myth #3. Clinton, Albright and the Pentagon generals were moved to
action by their concerns about "ethnic cleansing" and human suffering.


Reality: The U.S., Germany and other NATO powers played a key role in
breaking up Yugoslavia in 1991-92, arming and supporting secessionist
movements. For 45 years after World War II, the many nationalities
that made up Yugoslavia lived together in peace. In the civil wars,
which followed the break-up of Yugoslavia, there was much bloodshed
and human rights violations on all sides. The biggest single act of
"ethnic cleansing" was the forced removal of 600,000 Serbs from the
Krajina region of Croatia (a former Yugoslav republic) by the
U.S.-trained and armed Croatian military in 1995. More than 55,000 of
these Serbs, who were resettled in Kosovo, are among the hundreds of
thousands of people made refugees by NATO bombing and the conflict in
Kosovo. (Julia Taft, Asst. Secretary of State on C-SPAN, 3-29-99) The
U.S. "concern" about removal of people from their homeland is very
selective. This is not surprising: Virtually the entire continent of
North America was "ethnically cleansed" of Native people to make way
for the U.S. and Canada, two of the NATO powers. U.S. policy has
supported, with arms and money, the removal of Kurdish people in
Turkey, Palestinians, East Timorese, Guatemalan indigenous people --
and the list goes on.



Myth #4. The U.S./NATO goal is to protect the rights of the
predominantly Muslim Albanians in Kosovo.

Reality: U.S. officials pretend to care about the rights of Muslim
people in Yugoslavia, while their policy of sanctions and war kills
300 Iraqis every day -- half children under 5 years old. Most Iraqis
are Muslims.

The Pentagon is not a humanitarian relief agency and the
corporate-owned politicians don't really care about any people --
Albanians, Serbs, Kurds, Iraqis, or the poor and working people of
this country.

This war is killing people of all nationalities in Yugoslavia, and
poisoning their land with radioactive depleted uranium (DU) weapons.
Hundreds of thousands of Iraqis, U.S. veterans and their families are
suffering from Gulf War Syndrome as a result of depleted uranium
poisoning. The Clinton administration and the Pentagon talk about
"supporting our troops" before they go into battle, but then deny
medical benefits to veterans who suffer from the after-effects of
Agent Orange from Vietnam or DU from Iraq.

This war will cost many billions of dollars, money stolen from
housing, health care, education and other social programs. Each cruise
missile costs $1 million. The only ones who will benefit from this war
will be the military-industrial complex and big business.

The real U.S./NATO goal is to break Yugoslavia into ever-smaller
pieces and bomb its people into submission. The Balkans is a strategic
region, a crossroads between Western Europe and the oil-rich Middle
East and Caspian Basin. The U.S. has established, in only 5 years,
military domination of the former Yugoslav republics of Croatia,
Bosnia and Macedonia, as well as Hungary and Albania. The only
hold-out has been what is today the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.
This is the real reason why Yugoslavia has become the target in the
Balkans, just as it is the real reason that Iraq has become the target
in the Persian/Arabian Gulf region.



Myth #5. U.S. news reports are balanced and impartial, giving us the
true story.

Reality: What we see today is a gross distortion of the facts. The
media is dominated by big business interests, and functions as a
Pentagon propaganda machine. For political purposes, the suffering of
only one group, the refugees leaving Kosovo, is shown, while the other
Yugoslav victims of the NATO bombing are virtually ignored. The New
York Times, CNN, ABC, CBS, NBC, The Chronicle Examiner, and others
have given a very slanted view of events in Yugoslavia, to justify the
massive bombing. General Electric, one of the country's largest
military contractors which supplies engines for NATO jet fighters,
owns NBC and co-owns MS/NBC.

unfortunatley i think you are right.  grad students are depoliticitized in
a number of ways; in the less prestigious and wealthy institutions, it's by
being so nickeled and dimed to death both economically and with regard to
time (at U of MN the grad students are run ragged by the necessity of
always having to find jobs, and are told by a cynical administration that
this --"lots of teaching experience" --will look good on their cvs!!!); at
the more privileged institutions its because it is suggested that by
reading raymond williams they are automatically doing right by the under-
or working-class many of them have never had firsthand encounters with.
there are exceptions though; some faculty i studied w/ at stanford were
actively involved in stuff like voter registration in under-represented
neighborhoods, and combined it with their intellectual work by writing
about it.  i did my most interesting work (teaching in a GED program)
*before* i went to grad school, but was able to *theorize* and write about
that work in grad school.  since becoming a prof, i've had less and less
incentive toward a certain kind of involvement outside the academy and have
become more and more "literary" as well, though plenty of opportunities are
available for volunteer or organizing work.  right now i'm considering how
to make some of my classes, like "Poetry as Cultural Critique," have an
element of "community work" built in to the syllabus, though this is
complex and involves lots of bureaucratic red tape.  so mostly i'm
"reduced" to activism through writing about subjects that don't usually get
covered in academic journals.

2.
On Wednesday, April 7th at 4:30 at UC-San Diego, in the Visual Arts
Performance Space, a FREE reading by Mervyn Taylor.


Mervyn Taylor divides his time between New York and his native Trinidad.
Formerly a treasury worker in Trinidad, he currently teaches high school
English in the New York City public school system and creative writing at
The New School for Social Research. His poems have been published in
numerous magazines and several anthologies, among them Giant Talk (Random
House) and Rock Against the Wind (William Morrow). He is a graduate of
Howard University and holds an MFA in poetry from Columbia University.
Junction Press published his first book, _An Island of His Own_, and now,
still warm from the press, his second, _The Goat_.


"Using imagery that is subtle yet richly evocative, Mervyn Taylor creates
whole lives in just a few short lines. Piquant details and a detached,
acutely perceptive voice draw the reader into atmospheres swollen with
feeling. These are poems that open up new worlds in which readers may
live."                                   Publishers Weekly


"[In his poems] I have discovered Taylor’s remarkable ministorytelling
talent, his cool, aphoristic phrasing, his tonally discreet prose lyricism,
and his quiet, ironic world view. A poet of technical expertise, thematic
understatement, language subtlety, and human warmth and compassion."
        Andrew Salkey, World Literature Today

"Mervyn is a wary technician, even a cunning one. He works in taut meters
that want to cohere the pressures of the casual. Mervyn Taylor is an honest
poet, and that is high and sufficient praise indeed."                                Derek
Walcott



The End of Their Days


I. The Father

After he died it was
as if the flooring
had been taken away
and we walked for
the longest while on
sand, water lapping
at our feet.

Standing tip-toe
the mother would run
her hand along the back
of the shelves and find
a few pennies or none,

and rain blew in on
us in the kitchen
as she turned a pot
dark as the weather,

and the ghost of a goat
butted the ghost of
the man and Fitzy
his helper paraded
with a switch, small
cascadoo ghosts leaping
in the kitchen.

Then the Indian
came and laid linoleum
throughout the house
so we walked on that
and he put a rail
on the back steps so
the mother wouldn’t fall.

Then she hurt her foot
on a Morris chair and
the wound grew into
a lifesore that sent up
a warm smell that
lit up the house,

and one Christmastime
she dyed her hair
and the chemicals left
her eyes sealed tight
and the windows
curtainless, her head
blacking the pillow,
the bed unmade,
the house undone.


II. The Mother

After the boys migrated
she held out as long
as she could, but
there was no one to send
to the shop for Phensic,
and the wound would
shrink to a pinhead
then blossom again.

And her best friend
held her hand as she asked
for the men in her life:
the one who looked so
much like her they could
pass for twins, who
gave her her first son,

and the one who gave her
her second and built
them this house growing
silenter by the days.
Then the one who’d been
watching all along, who
knew her lonely story and
came to people her place
with strangers.

“Into thy hands,”
her friend intoned.
She repeated it,
and the breadfruit tree
dropped a ripe one on
the roof that night,
the room growing
as hot as La Brea noon.

Her eyes looked
at the ceiling to see what
repairs had to be done
and her ankles twitched
as they propped her up
to look over the wall
for anyone who
at last was coming.


III. The Boy

He thinks he heard
his father calling
as the goats pull
the old man up and
down the road,
he sees

his father’s hand
exploring the diseased
gut of a ram, worms
curling from the hole
onto an open palm.

The same hand
polished brass buttons,
lifted the silver whistle
that blew
to send the trains
lurching forward.

He begins to follow
the old man’s path
down the uprooted track.
He begins to occupy
the one-room depot,
a relic himself.

He is deeded
more than the house
and goat pen.
More than once
the corporal stops him
as he combs Arouca,
looking for Telemaque,
the old man’s one
and only friend.

There is so little need to be concerned with fabric.  This cannot be undone
- class, differences, borderlands.  It is genetic, this behavior among human
beings to territorialize and to single out and dehumanize those individuals
opposed to the expansion of one's stature or territory.  We can talk about
it.  We can abstract it.  We can even try to fight it.

But look closely at the animal part of us.  Understand why our eyes are set
forward-facing in our skulls.  Understand why we have incisors.  Why we are
so skilled in the fine art of building and perfecting weapons.  We are
vicious and we are hungry and we are civilized.  All three.  Take off your
clothes and count the hairs sprouting over your body.

The solution?  Better yourself and oppose those who oppose your attempts at
bettering yourself.  How to do this and what this means, both are in your
head.  Write it down, maybe.  Nihilism is freedom...

      POETS ON THE VERGE OF A NERVOUS BREAKDOWN
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

      Edited by Anthony Mellors & Robert Smith


The deconstruction of nostalgia for transcendent identity is crucial
to international poetry working out from modernism. If, for
example, the work of Andrea Zanzotto, Allen Fisher, and Susan
Howe centres on locations saturated with national myths (the
Veneto, London, New England), this is not in order to romanticize
the poet's identity with the place or to envision universal truths
from a local microcosm. Rather, each of these poets takes the
immediate environment as a place crossed by divergent histories,
perceptions, and ecologies which are traced as partial evidence,
inviting readers both to attend to the difficulties of the text and to
pursue their own lines of inquiry. Even in the case of Zanzotto's
psychoanalysis of pastoral identity, no subject-position is evoked
which remains unquestionable.

However, although this kind of poetry has a wide and dedicated
audience, it is far removed from what most readers and literary
critics today regard as the appropriate form of contemporary verse.
Late modernism is post-modern in the sense that Lyotard makes of
the term: a critical reworking of the procedures of modernism. But
postmodernism has acquired another meaning, which has gained
general currency: the outright rejection of modernism as being
idealist, elitist, reactionary, inaccessible, and irrelevant. If
postmodernism means the breakdown of distinctions between high
and low forms of culture, late modernism's formal difficulty puts
it squarely in the high culture camp. Post-modernist poetry, on the
other hand, turns away from avant-garde experimentation. Instead,
it reestablishes the lyric voice, either through ironic parables of the
self or as the expression of multicultural identities. It endorses the
local, the particular, even the provincial, as the representation of
vital if marginalized communities, and it does so without the
modernists' desire to sublate the regional into a unified humanist
locus. Value is placed on the lucidity and directness with which the
poet communicates, allowing readers to identify with
representations of their own community or to empathize with
others. Poetry is a means - one among many - by which local
identities protect themselves from the homogenizing power of the
culture industry.

In this light, poetry which suspends identification looks as if it has
never managed to break free from the Coleridgean belief in a
clerisy of readers only able to grapple with the dialectics of the text
because highly attuned to the history and theory of poetic forms.
In a world where marginalized voices are fighting for recognition,
late modernism stands accused of evading its democratic
responsibilities. Far from inspiring readers to engage with
questions of identity and difference, these barely legible texts could
be said to encourage resignation and indifference in anyone except
those who are well educated and already disposed towards the
'difficult matter' of modern art. In contrast, postmodern poetry
claims humanist inclusivity without the rhetoric of aesthetic unity.
It aspires to what Simon Armitage and Robert Crawford call in
their recent Penguin anthology 'the democratic voice'.

This new poetic democracy is not without its theoretical and
institutional problems. Postmodernism argues for the irreducibility
of experience, its essential difference from community to
community. Yet in this context it requires that all experience be
rendered in an identifiable form. In Britain, for example, poetic
legitimacy is associated with a deeply ingrained suspicion of
'foreign' influences, so that even where regionalism is valued it
tends to be invoked as a populist defence against European
experimentalism and American excess. And it is not always clear
whether a poet's work is given as regional or radically marginal
because it engages with the linguistic and political pressures of
non-centralized identity, or simply because the poet has a tenuous
association with a marginal site. In _Devolving English
Literature_, Robert Crawford wants to affirm the virtues of
'provincial' writing against what he sees as a dominant and
exclusive metropolitan culture; yet his preferred exponents of
regional identity tend to be poets who, although having Welsh,
Irish, or Scottish family origins, are granted cultural legitimacy by
conforming to the only poetic 'voice' acceptable to metropolitan
publishing houses such as Faber: an ironic lyric style relatively
untroubled by the translatability of language or personal experience
and endorsing aptness of metaphor as the fundamental mark of
poetic value. Crawford's provincial/metropolitan opposition is itself
bogus in that it elides the problem of complicity: the notion of the
provincial is an invention of the metropolitan bourgeoisie, and its
use calls into question Crawford's ability to analyze the politics of
poetry beyond a centralist point of view. The position here is both
metropolitan and imperialist in that 'provincials' become the
subjects of sentimental regard as long as they communicate in the
accepted terms; otherwise, they are ignored or denounced. The
marginal is invited into the mainstream or preserved as marginal
value by the mainstream only when it gives up its attachment to
difference.

For late modernists, on the other hand, difference cannot be
translated, only approximated. The poem is a construction which
makes the reader aware that every translation is an appropriation.
It could be argued, however, that the implied reader of this poetry
is just as 'metropolitan' as Crawford's democrat. But, while the
two positions are not as clear cut as our description suggests, they
do represent fundamentally opposed views of poetry's function in
modern society. For what we are calling late modernism, poetry
can only become a radical force by resisting consumer culture and
its appeal to the 'short attention span' of its audience; for
postmodernism, poetry can only prevent itself from being
marginalized or completely ignored by competing with more
marketable forms of cultural production. While the former
continues to be reviled by the mainstream publishing houses and
literary organs as too rarefied to be of popular interest, the latter
is itself beginning to fall foul of market pressures. The current
hoo-haa over Oxford University Press's axing of its poetry list
shows that the mainstream is somewhat more marginal than its
proponents have imagined.

Even so, poetry is flourishing as never before through public
readings, small publishers and magazines, and via the Internet.
Although these networks might be said merely to affirm poetry's
marginalized status in an era of global markets, they nevertheless
lay claim to the cultural value of independent means of production.
(A modern irony being that small-press material has frequently out-
sold 'major' publications.) And, if these networks originate from
local or marginal groupings, they are anything but narrow in their
reach. They have inaugurated a new internationalism in poetry
which goes some way to confound the old coteries and critical
demarcations. The use of new technology has revitalized traditional
media by lowering production costs and has created alternative
forms of distribution. Australia, for example, has become a new
poetic centre. Through magazines such as John Kinsella's _Salt_,
James Taylor's _Boxkite_, and (on the Internet) John Tranter's
_Jacket_, it has increased international recognition for Australian
writing while creating strong links with poets in France, Britain
and the United States.

The aim of this issue of _Angelaki_ is to collect a wide range of
critical essays addressing the current state of international poetry.
We invite contributions addressing the general questions raised
above, and we hope to encourage debate about the history and
ideology of modern poetic forms and institutions. Far from being
taken as read (which is unlikely considering the partisan nature of
the subject), the remarks made here should be seen as the
springboard for argument and clearer definition. The issue will also
include new poetry.

Subject:      A Reply to Kent Johnson
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

Kent - As you know, I withheld your message of friday until today;
it having been addressed to me by name, I felt it my due at least to
have the chance to read it before sending it on. Now that I have
read it, I can say that - if not gladly - I'm willing to respond to your
questions this once, despite the fact that where they lead may be,
whatever your assurances, "another round of angry accusation."
On this count, I leave it to other members of the list to judge for
themselves how the rhetorical tactics you deploy in such phrases
as "B92ed from the List" etcetera balance with those assurances.

Your basic questions, I take it, are these:

1. Does the enactment of the List's "ideological character"
mandate, in addition to your daily surveillance of posts, the
denial of subscription rights to certain poets?

2. IF it is true that there have been poets "ideologically"
excluded from List membership, isn't it actually the case...
that you ARE, in practice, preventing posts that might
"provoke consideration or sustained argumentation"
from coming to the List's attention?

My reply is simply this, that the *specific* ideological cast that
you and your friends have wished to give this issue is a gross
distortion, and tiresome; and that the supposed intellectual or
poetical differences that have comprised this debate are
neither. Instead, we - by which I mean the owners of this list
and its subscribers - have been met time and again with an
empty rhetoric of "free speech" so twisted as to support the
grossest domination; coupled with sustained inappropriate
behavior toward list administrators and fellow subscribers,
as the case may be.

I reserve, as do all listserv moderators, the right to remove
from the list and to deny further subscription privileges to any
subscriber who will not abide by the rules of the list as set
out in the Welcome Message; and this includes "problem"
subscribers that were removed or resigned their subscriptioins
before I took on the task of list moderation. I use the words
"subscription privileges" pointedly - as a little [electronic] bird
 just reminded me, list membership is a privilege, never a right.

The obligation to remove such subscribers from the list is one
I take very, very seriously; so much so that I want to address
the specific formulation of the two questions I've quoted above,
in order to be absolutely clear. In the first, you ask me if it is true
that the fact of moderation on this list mandates "the denial of
subscription rights to certain poets." To this I would have to
reply that the task of list management has to do with subscribers,
and not "poets" as such; and that the implication that anyone
has been removed from this list for reasons other than their
behavior on this list is certainly false. In the second question,
you attempt to demonstrate a flaw in the logic of my earlier
claims, to the effect that my actions here *are* preventing
discourse on this list. In answer to this, please refer to my
preceding characterization of the "contributions" to which
you evidently refer. Those who wish to know more may
consult the Poetics List archive, located on the web at
<http://writing.upenn.edu/epc/poetics>.

So in fact, Kent, as you suggest in your post, your questions
are informed by faulty assumptions. I would go so far as
to say that even the assumption that these are questions -
of the kind that want answering - would be faulty. What
you seem to want, rather than answers, is to make further
accusation; and the tenor of your questions bears this
out. What I want is to preserve this list, so shaken by
the actions of a small group of subscribers, some of whom
evidently employed precisely the sort of tactics you employ
in this post, if perhaps less subtly; and whose abuses of this
list and its members directly precipitated my appearance
as moderator.

Now this issue has been given enough time on-list; we have
wasted enough bandwidth. To think that 600 people would
want to be subjected to "another round of angry accusation,"
however cooly made, is too much; not to mention my own
time, which is precious to me.

Surely the source of this is somewhere in the bowels of the Milosevic
propaganda machine? Among the distractions here: we don't villify Hitler
because he crossed borders--that's far too commonplace a behavior--but
because he practiced genocide. While the expulsions of whole populations
may not be technically gennocidal, it's a pretty close relation. He who
does this, repeatedly, demonizes himself. That others have done so is
rather beside the point.
US interest: If in fact we control the rest of the Balkan Penninsula, what
difference does the enmity of the Serbs make to us? Are we concerned that
they will ally themselves with a superpower like Angola? How can the Serbs
either help or hinder us? The US has reasons for being there, not all of
them altruistic, but this aint one of them. Capitalist plot to control the
news: curiously, a lot of news outlets are adamantly opposed to the
bombing, a lot of others are doubtful, and these among those most
identifiable with Big Business. Likewise resistance in Congress.

One can disagree about the action and its efficacy, but not, I think, on
these grounds.

Considering the topic of National Poetry month was brought up I have a
piece which fits in. I know some of you have seen portions of this
series and for those who haven't, I have become friendly with a prophecy
telling machine named Estrella. She is gorgeous and everybody loves
mystery. It has become an expensive habit. I will be moving the 10th of
this month as a result, backchannel for address. This has ruined my
life.

Be well

Estrella’s Prophecies #52




Buy so much poetry this month that you
can fiscally understand poetry month.
Jonathan Galassi needs the money
and decent non-honkey panelists.
Buy a lot of white lady with the rest
of the money because you think good
writers shoot dope. Use a clorox clean
needle as that sex-poem poet is more
than words. When they take you away
to the poetry rehabilitation center
you will be de-programmed and finally
learn Borders cannot carry excellent
poetry. Drop another coin in the
slot and I will tell more.

Columbus Ohio: Annie Finch is reading at Larry's tomorrow (Monday)
night.  Please make a special effort to be there.  She teaches Creative
Writing at Miami U/Oxford Ohio and her book Eve from Story Line Press
has gotten attention.  Her other books include The Ghost of Meter:
Culture and Prosody in American Free Verse (Michigan, 1993); A Formal
Feeling Comes: Poems in Form by Contemporary Women (Story Line, 1994);
and After New Formalism (Story Line, 1998).  She is translating the
poetry of Louise Labe and working on a multimedia CD-Rom of Eve.  Annie
is driving in from Cincinnati, leaving her wee ones and the universtiy
for a venue that is not her normal scene.

One of the things which sticks with me from the Introduction to Political
Science class  I attended in 1971 at Kent State University (one of those
midlevel State institutions recently derided on this list) is sociologist
Robert Michel's Iron Law of Oligarchy--the idea that power inevitably tends
to concentrate in the hands of a few.The essence of democracy is the fight
against that tendency. Every time this list excludes a participant or censors
a message the body politic is scarred.

My wish is that more people participate in the poetics exchanges and that the
personal vitriol be held in check.  Jessica P.'s recent post about ambitions
running rampant seems very much to the point.  I share her frustrations.

I'm made constantly aware that Americans and Brits use the word "class" in
different senses.  Though even in Britain things have become more fluid, when
you meet the real ruling classes -- as defined in those chauvinistic terms --
you are in absolutely no doubt, for it begins in their schools.  Still, when
James Sherry says that no one on this list can be called ruling class, I
recognise the cogency of his remarks but then go blank a moment.

I have lived most of my life without many possessions or too much money
(Alice and I live in a tiny two-room apartment in Paris) but I'm clear that I
am a member of the ruling class. That's because I refuse to consider the
question of class in anything but world terms.  I simply won't do it.

First, let me allow for the really disadvantaged in the Triad countries: I
can't speak for them.  But, for myself, it's obvious that in comparison with
billions of people in the Third World -- the huge majority in the world -- I
am decidedly upper class.  Also, in terms of being a member of a country and
of coalitions which impose their politics and economics on the rest of the
world by force if necessary I am a member of the ruling class.  Until Western
poetry really takes those facts on board it will not, in my view, have a deep
view of class.

This is not piety on my part (and anyway I'm sure James has thought of this a
million times himself).  It's just that I cannot bear to island this
argument, making of it a convenient national territory where I can feel
comfortable either with my standard of living or my poetry.

I've finally made an html version of a short essay (with some added
paratextual paraphernalia) which was written for *Mute* (no. 11), 'Of
Programmatology'... This is at:
<http://www.demon.co.uk/eastfield/in/prog/progset0.html>.

Can I take this opportunity to recommend this magazine again to those of
you who may not have seen it, but take an interest in art and digital
culture. The latest issue is number 12, and it includes many fine articles
on, for example regulation and the net and the 'new' avant-frontier of
biotechnological engagements. *Mute* did surface in UK news agents for a
time. Better stockists should have it. Information from:
<http://www.metamute.com/>

I have also put up a more specialist essay on transliteration at:
<http://www.demon.co.uk/eastfield/in/translit/transl.html>. A version of
this essay will also appear in "Gravitational Intrigue: an anthology of
emergent hypermedia," the forthcoming (CD Rom/Web-based) vol 22 of *The
Little Magazine*. Inquiries: <litmag@cnsunix.albany.edu>.

Both these essays probably need 4.0x browsers and screens that are at least
800x600.

Apologies if you receive this message more than once.

Advanced praise for the book:

"This ambitious work which brilliantly uses biography, historical
documents, newspaper reportage, oral history, fragments from testimony
and interviews, never lets the reader down, not as art or as
evidence....here, writing her greatest poems, a 'heart of flesh' is
earned by consciousness of the powerful interrelated and often buried
forces that connect us and shape who we are."
        --Toi Derricotte, author of "Black Notebooks" and "Tender"

Dear Poetics List,

I searched the House web site for specific information about this
the bill John Lowther refers to and found:

Don Young, an Alaskan representative has posted three letters on his web
site, each titled "Internet Access Charges":

http://www.house.gov/donyoung/issues.htm

Rep Young's letters explain the issue of "reciprocal charges"
between phone companies pretty clearly.

Arizona representative Jim Kolbe has also introduced a bill that
would prohibit per minute charges for Internet access. Maybe this
one deserves our support. You can read a release about it at:

http://www.house.gov/apps/list/press/az05_kolbe/pr_990330_internet.html

douglas oliver:  a fine sentiment, given that the yearly avg. global income
is (i believe) hovering around $2500 (u.s. equivalent, and sorry for
putting it this way)... also, i take your point about british pedigree...

still---and while my mind went blank a bit too after reading james s's post
(hi james!)---i'll have to depart ultimately from the upshot of what you're
saying, douglas:  there are class differentials here in the states that are
monumentally unjust... and there are class differentials here in the states
that are less so, if nonetheless unjust... and i feel compelled here to
exhort those who find themselves in the u.s. to begin to find a way to talk
about these differences, b/c it's simply too easy (yes---easy) *only* to
point our fingers at other countries and allege the enormous injustices
there (with our words or deeds) while the injustices here (class-based, and
as i've posted here before, entirely wound around race and gender and so
forth) go unchallenged...

reminds me in fact of a character in dickens's _bleak house_---

well i'll skip the literary allusions... also, while i'm at:  i may as well
depart a bit from other posts, other excellent posts on this thread, in
which the desire to complicate money issues as such strikes me at times as
an aversion to discussing said issues... i.e., if there is room for
structural-economic analysis, for rethinking distribution of wealth, there
is room too for more earthbound analyses... yes, class is indeed tricky b/c
it's fluid---but fluidity does not erase memory, and memory is one sign of
difference and identity...

so, i'm with kathy lou and others on this---i can usually detect in short
order when i'm dealing with someone whose (e.g., u.s.) pedigree is owing to
a real difference in economic class... having been OF the u.s. working
classes, having lived IN poverty (by u.s. federal standards) for some
years, and having found mself of late in comfortable if  markedly unstable
u.s. middle-class confines (one mark of which may be---and here i must be
parenthetically public abut this---that kass (above) and i recently filed
chapter 7) has perhaps provided me with this... ability?... for me, i find
that it's also a matter of being 1st generation american (my mother a
french citizen, merchant class *prior to* wwii), and second on my father's
side (italian, poor)...

again, i don't wish to be too much "myself" in all of this, but i find
accounting for oneself (as douglas has, in fact) to be an important, even
urgent part of the discussion... not confessions, no, not even
disclosures---just a sense of where, as we used to say, one is coming
from...

alla that said, i *do* appreciate douglas's global provocation...

best,

joe

I had meant to post this one:

Dear List,

First I’d like to thank all the folks who have been posting on the war,
Charles B., Kent J. Etc. and nod to Doug Oliver’s clear statement about
class.  Capital comes in many forms, for those of us who have the
priviledge of chosing some forms and not other less palatable ones.
Worthwhile to keep in mind the penniless noble.

My computer is all but useless just now so getting email is an activity
that takes a whole day so I’m late in getting the following information
out, but alas:

Minnie Bruce Pratt

is the author of _S/He_, Rebellion, Crimes Against Nature (Lamont
Selection, 1989).

She has published a new collection called _Walking Up Depot Street_
though the Pitt Poetry Series.  I urge you to read this book which
carries the reader though a wildly dimensional landscape via an internal
and external descent into the female, working class south.

Please come to a
Book Party for
Minnie Bruce Pratt
whick will take place
at the

International Action Center,
39 West 14th Street,
between 5th and 6th Avenues,

this Saturday evening,
April 10 at
7:00 pm

call 212-633-6646 for info

proceeds from book sales will be donated to Millions for Mumia, the
campaign to stop the execution of Mumia Abu Jamal


From the poem “A&P”:

“She rolled a tomato in her hand, pink rubber
ball engineered to fit a machine.  The motion
recalled Florida, toward the Glades, Pahokee,
Belle Glade, fields to the horizon, crawling
with tomato plants, and the proportion all wrong
between the rows: wide enough for a truck to drive
through.  A truckload of migrant workers, Cuban,
Haitian, Jamaican, perhaps Creek, Seminole,
turning rolling to a dark spot on the horizon,
stopping somewhere, the next unpicked spot
the same, on the row, assembly line.”

tom beckett's recommendation to 'hold personal vitriole in check' (i
paraphrase) draws me out of lurk (again!), esp. as tom asserts that
"[e]very time this list excludes a participant or censors a message the
body politic is scarred"...

i'm in sympathy with the latter, but see it as an ideal, predicated in fact
on the former... and to give the discussion here, online, a practical bent
(and w/o wishing to dredge up the poetics controversy of months past), i'd
like to ask, rhetorically, how many of you have spent any time on usenet?...

b/c there's generally a profound difference twixt usenet groups and lists
such as these (moderated or unmoderated)... one reason why i don't bother
with usenet these days is b/c of the deplorably unchecked AND uncensored
nature of what goes on there... i speak in *broad sweep* of course (alan
sondheim can speak more directly to this issue), but if you think you'd
really like to see an unchecked and uncensored discussion c. 1999, please
do have a look at usenet... i'm using the word "uncensored" in an
admittedly narrow sense to mean, not only does no one stop what is said
from being said (b/c no one really can), but there is NO encouragement (let
alone moderation) by anyone in a position of responsibility to the effect
that some things might be better left unsaid (yes, i'll say it---hate
speech falls into this category of course, esp. in a public forum where
anybody can say anything and everything)... on those usenet groups that
purport to deal with some of the more sensitive issues we deal with here
(such as race, say) the discussion (if you can call it that) can be utterly
revolting...

so i think spending some time on usenet may make that much clearer the
need---at times---for SOME form of moderation (aka "censorship"), whether
"full" or "partial" or someone in charge (as it were) just plain urging us
to cool down...

but don't take my word for it... head over to igc:soc.cult.af.am */ (or
wherever) and see for yourselves... i'm against censorship in general, but
perhaps this is more a comment on the nature of our public domain... and
after all:  there is much, i venture, that we'd all of us agree should not
be posted in a public establishment (and in fact and contra the 1st
amendment, there are laws to prevent such stuff from being posted)...

best,

joe

Nice.  I like to think intention is process.  It is movement toward motion.
And everyone can continue saying stuff.  The world may not be safer with a
