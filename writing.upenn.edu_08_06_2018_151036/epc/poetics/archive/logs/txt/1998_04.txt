i agree wholeheartedly (you sound as though you're familair with
Rachel Blau DuPlessis _Pink Guitar_)-- though i think if i were a male
writer i'd call them into question too (i hope) -- but women are in a
particular position, i believe, to do the questioning, to cite Joan
Retallack

so in answer to SSScheafer, then, i do feel myself peculiarly
positioned visavis "history" "tradition" -- i AM doing things
inconceivable to women of generations before me (i'm not sure what
those things are, & i like to think that if i were of another
generation i'd be doing those things. . .)  But i DO write with the
awareness of how quiet my apt is, my life is, as i've
chosen thus far not to reproduce (my mother had 4 babies at my age) --
or to take on many "nurturing" activities --
this isn't necessarily a gender-particular experience (history hangs
heavy) -- but as katy points out those male loner-lady's man-drunk-etc
&c narratives (descendents of what alice jardine calls master
narratives) have been written, re-written. & i scour the library
looking for MY (postmodern in the chronological sense)
role models . . . it's the being "other" thing, in a
variety of implications, that i sense.

p.s. to sss -- seems as though i may have made you the target of my latest
obsession (narrative); i'm sorry

another anecdote (from PW):

Charlottesville Shutting: Williams Corner Bookstore to Close

Michael Williams has one word when asked abut the superstore
competition that he says put Williams Corner Bookstore, his
Charlottesville, Va., independent, out of business. "Gangsters,"
he says coolly. "That's all there is to it."

Williams, who is otherwise soft-spoken and has owned his 2900-
sq.-ft. store since it opened in 1977, will close as early as April 20,
pending a lease signing by a new tenant. Only six years ago, Williams
had expanded the store, hoping this would protect it against the
impending arrival of a cross-town Barnes & Noble.

Charlottesville, home of the University of Virginia, supports a thriving
bookselling community. But that has also meant more competition for
Williams. Apart from the usual suspects, he has had to contend with
New Dominion, another independent a block-and-a-half away that
he describes as "a good bookstore." (In fact, Williams plans no
blowout sale because he doesn't want to undercut New Dominion's
business.) He also points out a catch-22 in Charlottesville
bookselling: "Our best customers are the ones who have
personal computers, and they're the ones who are going to be
entranced by Amazon."--Steven M. Zeitchik

Of course the supermarket bookstores do little good as to small press,
limited run, and self published, and it is those that tend to really matter.

The big supermarket bookstores could potentially create a better market
niche for some speciality shops, gourmet bookshops as it were. The biggest
difficulty is that the prices tend to go up to cover the overhead and
relatively low sales volume, putting gourmet literary fare out of reach
of many who once were its major customers.

Then again, the prices at the supermarket are often no bargain, as they
have to pay for all that marketing and promotion, and the rent is not cheap
either. However, I did note one thing when I was in a book supermarket
recently. (Which one will remain unnamed.) That is that the shelves had
to have cost at least $600 a short section, if not more, and the displays
that went with them, hundreds more. The cost to furnish the place had to
be astronomical, and it takes a lot of book sales, with hefty markups to
recover that capital investment. Even the checkout counter was far from
the ordinary, but would have suited very fussy hardwood tastes. If they
economized the way supermarkets do, with simple metal shelving, and a
minimum of fancy decor, and simple rubber belt checkout stands, imagine
how much money the book buying public would have saved !

Or that is when the opposite happens and one realizes there is nothing there.

If you are thirsty, I will give you the idea of a glass of water.
Go ahead, drink it, and get rid of that thirst. What ?  You cannot ?
Why cannot you ?  Must be something wrong with you then. Try it again.
You'll eventually get the hang of it. The idea of a glass of water is
all you really needed wasn't it ? ....etc.....ad infinitum......

Of course, someone could give you bread, and no water, and tell you to
smile and be happy, and enjoy it, or they will take that away too. Soon
you are choking on the dry bread, thirstier for water than ever, but
attempting to use it to remain alive, the Eros still stronger than the
Thanatos. The lack of water is your gift from "god". Or is it that the
dry bread you are choking on and forced to smile as you force it in,
or you get no more, is your gift from "god" ?  Does not matter, as there
is a tendency towards that analogy in the system.

The system is a human creation. The use of the word "god" does nothing, in
my mind, to dignify it, and again what really happens tends to make me
think there is no such being, thing, whatnot, whodat, as "god", supreme
commander of the armed forces of the whole damn universe,
doctor-president-for-life-dada....or whatever HE is supposed to ultimately
be.....

Even the arguments from design, in cosmology, fail to be convincing, unless
one is willing to believe that "god" exists and was and is _insane_. After
all it is a creature eat creature, violent forces of mass destruction
nature, species competing against species, struggle to exist, kind of place.
No kind, loving, caring, thoughtful, considerate, deity would ever create
that kind of hell would they ?  As for humans, the pinnacle of creation,
created to make war on one another for millenia upon millenia.....No, of
course not. It must be all the work of one supreme, omniscient, omnipotent
deity.... Bullshit.

This is not the place to get into this, as Tom Mandel & I agreed about
it last time on a different facet of the subject, so this is my final
statement on the thread.  I think the universe not only has design but
emanates a moral reality in a "dramatic" form.  Humanity is a theater
for turning away from dog-eat-dog to a kind of shepherding role.  I
see this as a long-term species "act".  And the universe emanates more
than cold violence.  It emanates meaning, awe, beauty, and wonder.
It's a mistake to judge too quickly from a human scale - though Job
did so pretty effectively a long time ago.  But God is love, as the
short canonical sentence has it. Charles Peirce has some likeable
writings on the sense of truth as a shared outcome of long-term
consensus - of reality not so much as a "given" but a goal.

While I'm at it, down with postmodernism, reality is out there,
peanut butter and pickles IS a good sandwich.

I'm really saddened, from this distance, to hear of the closing of Williams
Corner Bookstore.  It was a truly marvelous place (with a conspicuous
devotion to poetry) that meant a lot to me during the nine years I lived in
Charlottesville.

By all means, folks shld stay away from Barnes & Noble and Borders and the
rest if there's a "Williams Corner" near them that they could be supporting
instead.

Announcing Issue No. 2 of The Transcendental Friend
http:www.morningred.com/friend



The second entry into our Critical Dictionary is an article on "Vocation"
by the remarkable Henry Gould.

This month The Bestiary, edited by Laird Hunt, features work by Anselm
Berrigan, Jordan Davis, and an extraordinary lyric by an anonymous Middle
English poet.

Translation, excavation, research, reportage, Report from Afield will
present works from some distance of space or time (being oriented at the
moment to present-day New York). Our first Report brings back an
interpretation of a text of Antonin Artaud by Jonathan Skinner.

Inspired in part by the Spanish form of response-in-verse, mote or glosa,
and in part by the visible stratification of Talmudic form in which time is
flattened and the argument exposed on one plane, Mote takes an existing
text as a ground for layers of response by subsequent authors. The current
primary text, an excerpt from The Black Book by Orhan Pamuk, will accrete
four layers of commentary over the course of the next four issues. The
first layer is by Leonard Schwartz.

Review will present critical works that aspire to their own form--a
condensation of writerly thought in response to a work, perhaps including
the time-honored traditions of praise and/or blame, etc., but not
necessarily. This month's Review, by Daniel Machlin, encounters the work of
Richard Tuttle.

This issue's Project is by Garrett Kalleberg and features texts from Ronald
Johnson's Ark, published in 1996 by Living Batch Press, Albuquerque
(available from Small Press Distribution and amazon.com).

The first issue of the Friend is available from the Files page. (With our
third issue, some archival & other materials will also be made available
from this page.)

The name of the Tannen book is actually _You Just Don't Understand_. Sorry
about the mistake -- it's been years since I read it.

i still have a bookmark from WCB from about 13 years ago -- a good store /
does B&N distribute free bookmarks? / B&N's 20% discount to teachers might
draw those among us in, and probably was part of their strategy / order
class sets (if you teach) from inde stores, yes, and also from small
presses (meow chapbooks instead of Prentice Hall textbooks, for ex) which
also get lost in the deal

I think the following poem is interesting vis-a-vis the very basic notion
that babies and other "womanly" things aren't taken seriously
as "poetic" subject matter.

In my view such a notion is only a starting point and in no
sense relfects the entire scope of what one might talk about vis-a-vis
"women/poetry"--

Anyway--my ambivalence stated, I wanted to type in the following poem by
Notley. I think it is certainly relevant to the discussion at hand--but I
also just love it--

        Mommy what's the fork doing?
                                What?
        It's being Donald Duck.

        What could I eat this?
                           Eat what?
        This cookie.
                        What do you mean?
        What could I eat it?




Does he bite people? The fish is dead. That fish got
dead today. That fish gets dead today, right?




        These are my silver mittens Mommy
        No, it's gold, they're gold mittens

        On myself
        I put my black
        hat
        and my mit-
        tens,
        myself.




Edmund. Edmund. Edmund.   Maaaah.   Lodle Lodle Lodle

Daddy, the doctor did put that wart on you,
                                           right?

I touch the purple petals
She says Hey!

                        The flower says, we are purple,
together
        they touch purple it keeps purple
        purple means us, here.
        The air moved a person. I like people
        because they are as serious
        as I am. Being purple is very serious.
        It's dense and still.
        It's a matter of fact
        but light seems it.
        I seem the light
        makes me feel purple.
        A petal is crumpling I've done
        before
                I sleep in the bulb.

                Being purple is long.

        Crumpling is not as serious
        as being purple

                (I may disagree.)

        I'm not serious not smiling.
        I'm smiling
        as crumpling
        only a little now.
        I'm mostly staying seriously purple now.




Do you remember when you were like Edmund?
                                           Yeah.
What did you do?
                crawled with him.
Do you remember last year?
                           Yeah, Mommy what did you
do when you be Anselm?



        The jacket is furniture.
        I have to fix, Mommy.
        I have to fix all the tools.
I'm in the snow and my feet go in the footprints.




I'll look up "love" in the dictionary. They're beautiful.
Bodily they're incomprehensible. I can't tell if they're
me or not. They think I'm their facility. We're all about
as incomprehensible as the crocuses. In myself I'm like a
color except not in the sense of a particular one. That's
impossible. That's under what I keep trying out. With
which I can practically pass for an adult to myself. Some
of it is pretty useful, like when I say to them
"Now will I take you for a walk in the snow to the store"
and prettily and usefully we go. Mommy, the lovely
creature, You should have seen how I looked last night,
Bob Dylan Bob Creeley Bob Rosenthal Bob On Sesame Street.
Oh I can't think of any other Bobs right now, garbage.
It perks. Thy tiger, thy night are magnificent,

it's ten below zero deep deep down deep in my abdomen.
It pulls me up and leads me about the house. It's got the
sun in the morning and the moon at night. It does

My armpits smell like chicken soup. But really I hate them
because of their tacky and unchanging book collection. My
head weighs too much on the pillow. I have to sweat. I'm
crying free water don't worry. Under your tongue looks like
pussy. You seem to bloom. The colors are brighter but I
think I'm deaf.
                I'm remembering all my dogs.
One was taken away because he howled too much and my
parents said he wanted to fight in World War II and so joined
the army. All things considered there's nothing to say for
Chicago. I dreamed you lead an army of empty pieplates
against another one. I dreamed you had a baby. I despise
someone. I have to sweat. I need you to stop this train.




   I didn't lose any weight today
   I had clean hair but I drove
   Ted nuts and spanked Anselm on
   the arm and wouldn't converse
   with him about the letter C. And
   didn't take Edmund out or change
   the way the house smells or not
   drink and take a pill and had to watch
   John Adams on tv
                   and fantasized
   about powers of esp when on lsd--
   there is no room for fantasy in
   the head except as she speaks.
   The Holy Ghost is the definitive
   renegade like in the white falling-out
   chair stuffing, 2 chairs
                           asking me if
   I liked my life and said
                           how could
   you dislike being a poet? and having
   children is only human
                         but
   she meant my chairs. The
   trouble is the children distribute
   the stuffing to the wind. It's
   soft and pliant and they can do it
   intimately together.
   There are 4 green sunbursts on the
   curtain. Oh it is cold at night but
   the jade plant will handle it.




   Came in from the snow and melted on
        the floor. There's
   Glistening where Jill and Ruthy's feet
   Sat Ruthy with braids and colored
   Yarn in her hair, a girl
   Beauty cars go by to hitch
   Away on
                is it their rumble
   That comforts? Or this room full
   Of everyone who's sat making
   Stuffing appear from the
   Chairs, and flowers too last years




They just want to do their yoga too. I guess so. I try
to call up Casey Gold. Some money comes by anyway; the
day brightens, Casey Gold.


I don't appreciate the simple
war of nerves
                my courtesy
rewarded with a goring
                        is it boring
the toro rhymes, what else do
children have to think about?
well if the cape is all wet it won't
blow in the wind
           but I have to check
something
           You're still in no condition
to fight a bull
           But he's found his own...
What a glistening golden
baby!
        Enough to make one woozy. Matador,
I am with the wind and unwinding

Standard,

You ask a couple of questions that interest me:

1. Is it possible, and if so, how, to analyze formal aspects of poetry
through a lens of gender identification?

Of course it is. In the "mainstream" one need only look at some of the
more popular female writers to see that gender allows one (in that
milieu) to "get away" with a lot more formal deviation-- (cf. Graham,
Hillman, Fulton etc...).

I think it is also entirely possible to do individual readings of various
"experimental" female writers through a lens of gender identificiation--

One might argue that Scalapino's very strange descriptions of sex in Front
Matter, Dead Souls have a lot to do with her gender position--

I find Howe's work as it relates to her critical work on Dickinson clearly
"gendered" in various ways. Howe's arguments vis-a-vis Dickinson and A.
Hutchinson--her exploration of antinomianisms as they seem bound up with a
feminine or feminist politics certainly show through in her poetry--

Formally one might argue that her scattering of phrases and words is not
onlly a visual statement, but a political one as well--a formal
enactment of antinomianism--a formal enactment of the evasion of official
identity.

Carla Harryman's recent work (There Never Was a Rose Without Thorn) is
extremely resonant with the conversation that's been going on here. In a
number of her pieces she plays with and trespasses upon
various gender categories--

One piece that I remember fairly vividly deals with a "person" who's in an
art gallery. It is never clear whether this person in a man or a woman. We
see the person in question move through the gallery--he/she thinks all
sorts of sexual thoughts, attempts to masturbate with a telephone, and
even converses with the gallery owner--but we are left none the
wiser re: his/her gender identity.

In other words, he/she gets into all sorts of narrative situations that
would normally warrent a pretty clear knowledge of the character's gender.
Harrayman has to jump through some pretty lofty narrative hoops to achieve
the desired effect of what feels like a strange sort of
gender-related vertigo.

And so on.... it is actually pretty easy to go through various female
authors (as one might do the same for men, ostensibly--Watten's
stereotypically masculine obsession with history, Bernstein's
stereotypically male interest in the formalities of the rant and so
on...)--

But the danger here seems to be that such formal trends will be chalked up
to gender and nothing more. I mean, it's not always clear how much of a
given poet's writing is determined by gender-related tendencies and how
much is related to the person's individual personality. As in, maybe
Scalapino is just a quiet writer--Watten a loud one (witness the
typography in his new book out on the terrific Atelos Press, Bad
History...)

2. How do I or anyone else on this list further my theoretical ideas about
gender in my poetic work.....


The most glaring example I can think of here in my work would be my use of
the dash. In some of my work I employ the dash more than liberally.

Once a woman who didn't like me called my work "super-model
poetry"--primarily because of my use of the dash (she used it too and
seemed to feel that I was trespassing on her poetic turf by using it)--

I would argue that the dash is probably the single most feminized formal
aspect of poetry being employed right now--

We see it associated with female writers as diverse as Graham, Scalapino,
Hillman, Dickinson, and Notley--

We do not often see it associated with guys.

Some thoughts,
Katy

title, author, and publisher for the books i want and can't find at my local
indy book store (the isbn number is one of the easiest ways to find books),
and then take these to the local and place my order. around a week later i

Katy:

As usual, lots to chew on and thanks plus I feel smarter now having read your
thorough post.  So thanks.

First off, for the record, no one has given me as editor more trouble about
dashes than Ray DiPalma who is very specific about the SIZE of dash he likes
and so what does that say about his gender identity?

Second, what on earth is "super model poetry" and why am I so excited?  Please
send some.

Third, Leslie Scalapino just read some "sex" poems from WAY, I believe, here
in town yesterday, and I was struck about how at least in that manuscript, it
seemed a bit more like reading phenomenology.  Plus a little particle physics.
But detached, I mean in big way. FRONT MATTER, DEAD SOULS I can't recall too
clearly here, but Leslie was telling me that she felt that a large part of her
work resists the idea of a reader who can "identify" with the work.

This I find really interesting.  How does a male-constructed-subject identify
with a poem that is "gendered" female?  And vica versa, of course.  In some
partial way?  In some alienated fashion?  No idea.  Does this resistance to
the notion of "identification" have anything to do with gender-- Bernstein, as
you say, does the male rant and so I often feel there is a "voice" (definitely
in recent work that he read here in LA) that can be "identified" with (for me
as a male-constructed-ranter).

Best,

Standard

Why don't you try reading my writing and the writing of the rest of the
women on the list and then you'll see how much of it is all about
technique.  And the notion of a female form has been kicked around ad
nauseum since when--the 70s, the 80s?  It's essentialist gaga.  Why should
we have to kick it around again to conform to your idea of a serious
discussion?

Katy, with all due respect, you're mostly talking about subject matter. And
if scattering words on a page is antinomian, then a lot of us are
antinomians--and, _pace_ Hutchinson, most of the antinomians in her day
were male. The dash, too, is pretty thin. For a long time the available
editions of Dickinson eliminated them, by the way, making her usage
unavailable as role model. Williams was very fond of dashes, as am I--but
I've written a fair number of poems invoving children, which may disqualify
me as an exemplar. On that last subject, here's a few from _Questions,
Short Poems, Water & Air_, by Ira Beryl Brukner, which will appear from
Junction Press this summer.

I'm not sure that there is such a thing as a feminine poetic, as opposed to
areas of concern that are not exclusive to but more common among/important
for women, and viewpoints that are more nearly gender-exclusive, and I'm
also not sure why it's important that there be one.

I also like to remember that two of the earliest poems we have, the songs
of Deborah and Miriam, don't much conform to the stereotypes of women that
have developed in the west since the troubadours, when the Jewish concept
of the Woman of Valor got lost.

Actually, Rachel, when I said that about no longer being a feminist (that's
a hard word to spell) I was being light-hearted about no longer being in
the preciousness of the Feminist Writer's Guild.  I don't like to align
myself with any group at this point--even feminist--the ugly specter of
political correctness raises its head--and self-censorship is close behind.
I've been reading feminist theory for like 20 years and at least 90% of the
books I read are by women.  I think an important thing that was covered in
Kathleen Fraser's project, and which I've really taken to heart, is that
women do not have to engage language in a manner privileged by male poets
and thinkers.  Her ideas, for instance, of "and/but" (female) as opposed to
"either/or" (male).  I'm leary of making rules about this or generalizing.
Ecriture feminine was interesting and radical when it came out, but now I
think lots of people find it problematic.  I think that one shouldn't feel
a compulsion to use male forms in writing, but also one shouldn't feel
pressured into speaking about writing in the current cliches of the
intelligencia.  I've been thinking about something Katy said a few days
ago--something about how she'd read her Derrida and Foucault--like she'd
done her homework--and now she has a right to talk about women.  I think
this points up the sickness--not of Katy--but of the comically elitist
poetic avant-garde in which many of us are involved.  Why does Katy have to
have read Derrida and Foucault--or feel that she should have--in order to
validate her speaking?  If D and F feed her writing, that's one thing, but
the compulsion that everybody who's intelligent and writing poetry must
read them is bunk.

I look forward to the day when a younger version of Katy will say, "I've
read Catherine Clement and Jacqueline Rose . . ."  Or even Laura Mulvey . .
.   That's when feminism will have really made a dent.

Let me add that no one rants better than Rochelle Owens. Even Charles might
agree.

For a great male rant see Armand Schwerner's _The Tablets_. Can't find my
copy of its last incarnation, so I can't cite the specific one. Anybody
help me out there?

Hi Standard--

It has been raining all day here after a week of beautiful summer
weather--

But somehow I am not disappointed as I know this is the spring that should
have happened in between.

I find your use of "identification" or lack thereof interesting.

The first thought that popped into my mind while reading your take on
Scalapino was that, at least, for me, the space of "non-identification"
she opens up is exactly what draws me in.

As in, in a world where, perhaps, I feel "kept out" of those spaces
(including various poetry books) that might be gendered male, Scalapino's
nearly neutral gender spaces seem inviting--

Particularly in regards to her depiction of sex I feel as if I'm
watching an act that is not so much genderless as animal?

Often when I read her work I feel as if I'm regarding various
almost science fictional beings--

They are perhaps gendered, but only in so far as, let's say, Octavia
Butler's characters in her sci-fi materpiece XENOGENESIS are gendered.

In other words, perhaps it is Scalapino's uncanny ability to create
"negative" gender spaces that allows the likes of me to "identify" with
her work.

Best,
Katy

I never said--or meant to imply--that ALL dashes=feminine.

Nor did I say that ALL poems that included babies etc. were written by
women.

Nor did I say that one might associate the dash with a "feminine"
subjectivity because Emily Dickinson was a role model per se--

What I am trying to address is the way in which form and subject-matter
(as they might be extricated from one another) might embody or otherwise
buttress certain political goals that women as a "subjectivity category"
might wish to accomplish.

Best,
Katy

Standard,

Please explain more about DiPalma's specificities about the dash.  Are you saying
that he insisted that the dashes be exactly the same size and spacing that he'd
used/written in his original manuscript and that you thought that picky in some
way.  I suspect you're not saying this--i.e., wanting the dashes done exactly as
submitted was picky, as you'd certainly want to get such particulars done
accurately, but I'm curious.  And about the reference to gender identity, you're
kidding, I gotta suspect, right?

In response to the subjectivity stuff.  My own hunch, which is probably not a
terribly new thought, is that women (and by extension gay and lesbian writers) are
in a unprecedented position to handle, especially, _pronouns_ in very new ways.
The "I" and "we" uses in conventionally referential poeties
have certainly taken (for good and necessary reasons, I think) a backseat in most
of the experimental/innovative poetries I've been reading in my lifetime.  I think
males have most often used these ironically, self-reflexively, and most especially
as "objects(?)," all by themselves--i.e., they become more the subject matter, or
the content, or whatever, in poetries that include them; not "a subject" speaks
from them; rather, they are more a part of the formal issues the poetry is
actually "about" ("is a preposition.  It takes a verb. It takes a verb to know
one" [possibly poorly misquoted but always for me hilarious quote from someone in
_The L=Book_).  I've digressed--sorry.  Again, if anything left after the
digression, I believe females and non-male gendered and/or identified poets will
especially handle pronouns, employ them, very differently, and do already, to be
sure.  I'm particularly interested in what will be done and what has been done
with the second person.  I believe close examination of the male experimentalists
will show "you" employed very seldom as "an other" presumably outside of the Self
of the poet.  More often, I believe, the male experimentalist's "you" will be a
projection of some part of the male's "Self" or some part of the "matter" the
poetry is addressing or made out of.  Non-males, I think, have a novel opportunity
(or even responsibility)
to use the second person and let it speak "for" and "to" and "about" and "from"
and _____ in ways that address or contact another "repressed element" in poetry, a
materiality not of "language," but of
"Self" a male overemphasis on "individuality" as means to "individuation" cannot
fully perceive, actualize or contact.  In other words, such Self can only be
illuminated when other "others" are heard from.

This post is a mass of confusion for the writer and probably will be for most
list-readers, too, but I can't articulate these thoughts clearly yet and want to
send the post anyway.  I do hope that some others will at least think about ways
of handling/employing pronouns, though.  I regret that I haven't taken the time to
closely analyze, say, ten prototypical male and ten prototypical non-male poetries

including various employment of the second person pronoun.  I do think such an
analysis would prove fruitful.

Me, I'm afraid.

        Katy,

        Re:  Of course it is. In the "mainstream" one need only look at
some of the
more popular female writers to see that gender allows one (in that
milieu) to "get away" with a lot more formal deviation-- (cf. Graham,
Hillman, Fulton etc...).

        I guess I am wondering how, and in what "mainstream" gender makes
this allowance.  Explicate?

        And the dash?  Obviously in Dickenson, but how is this gendered,
as a technique?  The dash in Pound, I would add, is crucial.

        Guess I find these remarks a little confusing.

Just got back from a reading by Renee Gladman & Diane di Prima at the =
Poetry Project--oddly related to some of the issues about here--so I'm =
tired and may not make complete sense.

However, would like to respond in part to some of Standard's and Marc's =
thoughts: I do agree deep down that gender personality is a societal =
construct, and find any attempts to trace personality to physique =
ultimately limiting and depressing. However, that societal construction =
goes back so deep that it is hard to analyze and understand completely =
(if at all). But I do find some important areas in which experimental =
women poets are working to overcome that Silence that so many women =
function (or perceive they function) within. And one of these areas is =
on the level of syntax. I do remember reading Stein when a callow =
student, and just finding the basic structure of her sentences =
incredibly alluring compared to many of the traditional, which, sorry, =
included mostly male writers I was also reading. Toward the end of "A =
Room of One's Own," Woolf refers to this difference in structure that =
she was finding between women and men writers. Now, I completely regard =
this as gender nonspecific and feel that since modernist women writers, =
and even early women writers working in the late 1800s, opened up a =
certain syntactical and structural space that may have been due to the =
impact of being "silenced"--silenced in intention and content which then =
found its way into structure and syntax--that many male writers found =
interesting and inspiring as well. (I know that I'm entering a certain =
radicality here, by implying that the whole shift of the early 20th =
century was due to women writers, but hey, it's late and I've got that =
foolhardiness granted by tiredness).=20

Anyway, Cixous (this is also going back to college, and I should re-read =
some of this myself) postulates that in language there is a male kind of =
syntax that is perceived as "better": that is, subject-verb-object, =
linear, logical, introduction, body, conclusion, etc. "Female" writing =
is cyclical (of course), non-linear, I think you can guess the rest. But =
her ideas are interesting when applied to someone like, say, Stein, or =
even Susan Howe, who is taking a traditionally linear topic, history, =
and writing about it in such a way that makes you re-think the syntaxes =
in which you read history.

Good night,
Marcella.

-never though Senor Blake could be such fun-so how is it out there in poetical
land-
When the dust settles out, the clouds lift and people start sifting and
sorting thru the remains of this century -people are going to remember some
great thinkers of the 20th century.
Teenagers everywhere are going to carry copies of Leslie Scalapino's Defoe
under there arms and read together in groups on stage and in alleys.

--"In the reality which is created  by a writing, to narrow to the outlines of
its form is utter scrutiny, is real. It's the interior relation of
experience." Scalapino

I'm trying to work my way thru Alfred North Whitehead now, and holy vectors,
Olson really knew what he was talking about. Scalapino is one of the best
writers we have out there, I wish somebody would send me some info on that
reading Anselm Berrigan is doing at HERE this weekend, I'm taking a trip down
the Hudson to NY-seaty to see my hermana and would like to stop by and see the
reading, thanks erik

I've been hearing about putative distinctions about the way men and women
write (as opposed to the subject of their writing) for maybe 30 years, and
I've yet to see them demonstrated. Laurence Sterne wasn't the first man to
write in the manner that Cixous describes as female, and the Brontes got
away with pretending to be male. Their writing wasn't obviously female to
anyone until it was revealed to be so.
Somebody a long time ago decided that rhymes ending with an unstressed
syllable were "female." The designation was certainly applied by a male,
and while the designation is rich with suggestion about attitudes about
gender, it's prosodically nonsensical.
Men and women have been more-or-less communicating with language for a long
time, and men and women have been unselfconsciously enjoying each other's
writing for almost as long as there's been writing, and usually without the
need of a translator. So the differences must be relatively superficial.
I don't know that the suggested gender difference, however slight or major,
is important to any agenda, but I would be intrigued if it exists. Rather
than quoting theorists why not present a text and explain convincingly why
it has to be by a member of one or another gender?

(((please read through to the end)))

just back in town from a memorable conference at suny/stony brook... much
to report, but i'll keep this as brief as i can:

first, to thank all of those who visited my website for the conference, and
gave me feedback of any sort---pro con whatever... this helped immeasurably
in my presenting something worth listening to, and in giving me
*confidence* to stand before a group of talented and committed scholars and
artists, and say what all i said...

second:  to say, again, that i find the discussion of feminist and gender
issues on this list vital and refreshing... and to thank nada gordon for
such a fascinating post, which just happens to include a nice reference to
past posts of mine... thanx nada, and i almost wish you hadn't mentioned
me, b/c it now may appear as though i'm saying this in part b/c you
mentioned me!...

third, to voice a minor disagreement with katy and keston (and katy---i
just love your posts, and keston---please continue to post your poetry!):
while i do think we need to think through simplistic binaries ("mainstream"
vs. "experimental") i do at the same time believe in concentrated power
centers, and in the relative disregard for (primarily and by my definition,
non-mainstream) poetries in academe and in our public domain (which i
continue to believe we have here in the states, though perhaps i'm
hallucinating)... that is, i do think poetry and poetics is in general
neglected, and that this is best gauged by having a look at what goes on in
the less prestigious institutions... call me an ambitious guy, as i've said
before... but we learn much by looking at the (english) and other student
(grad AND undergrad) bodies, and by considering how these bodies have
become increasingly the (often uncontested, sadly) site of corporate
appeals and public relations strategies... which is to say, bodies that
know little and often care little of political action, thanx in large part
to the way our educational systems work, current economic realities, etc...
please not to read this as an appeal to "conservative values" or some
such...

fourth, bill l., *titanic* is one weird flick, for sure, for lotsa reasons
that i haven't entirely figured out... i like the wall street allegory, but
think in fact that love and death in that item may become a cultural event
more b/c film technology intersects with appeal to doomed romance (not so
much populist-class-conflicted, but driven by the drifting (visual) artist
whose artistic vision literally refrains from exploiting his "true" love);
the spectacle of panoramic techo-disaster via flashback which itself
contains a viewing audience (presumably to coach actual viewers as to
proper response); the ubiquitous use of the filmic eye/i as a narrative
device that ends up reflecting the past through photographic as well as
cinematic images (all of those mock-sepia feminist-ic photos of wimslet
next to an airplane, etc., the colorized visual of that final death dream,
the underwater robot-eye, the computer-aided narrative graphic, or graphic
narrative, and such like)... digital as contemporary site of
melancholy?---a sort of inverse or submersed sublime?... i am not a cynic,
believe me, but found this particular film most troubling... and perhaps
most important, it's all upgraded and packaged for digital consumption
(think of the use in that film of digital stuntmen and women)... there's
something decidely *not* old-fashioned about *titanic*... oh and hey:  as
you might deduce from this, bill, that i'm myopic as hell, really, can't
see w/o my contacts to save my life... and am *not* a good swimmer...

and fifth (i save the worst for last), and along the lines of power:  to
report here, publicly, that ILLINOIS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY in chicago has
just denied me tenure (along with another colleague here in humanities)...
which issue, though as don byrd (my dear dear friend and diss. chair)
suggests, is surely an example of a person beating a very personal and
public drum, i hope fortifies some of my other comments on this list over
the past few years... thanx to all those who've voiced their support for me
over the past year during this (what else but?) ordeal... but in any case,
i post here with the hope, self-serving though it may be, that folks will
drop me a line backchannel if they hear of any institution looking for a
poet who knows a bit about critical theory and emedia, and (if i may) who
speaks his mind now and again...

best,

joe

1. The more interesting currents in poetry practice, in the last 25 years,
shake up form.  (The "excesses" of S. Howe or Scalapino, e.g.)

2. A response to the buried twists and injuries of gender polarity, and
patriarchal power, requires (or leads to) shaking things up at a number of
fundemental levels.  That's why the formally explosive and unlooked-for
approaches of a Howe, a Scalapino, a Harryman, are startlingly effective
at bringing uneasy and buried political constrictions to our attention.

3. These tensions and constrictions exist mainly as lived stresses; social
stuff is constituative of who we are.  So, although one person has spoken
of ideological policing, and another has (half-seriously) suggested she is
post-feminist because otherwise she will experience "political correctness
and self-censorship,"  the feminism inherent in the work of the poets
mentioned above (and others like 'em) emerges from deep within our
social tumult and roil.. It isn't imposed (whether externally or through
some improbable "self-censorship")

4. Political correctness is a right-wing slogan, whose basic function is
to try to convince us that social dissensions and disputes are artificial
and externally-imposed constructions.  But often the strife being
dismissed as "PC" is real and is rooted in disequilibria of power that are
real, and painful on a highly personal level.

5. Form cannot be disentangled from politics.  Poetry make everything (or
at least anything) happen.

In a message dated 98-04-01 20:58:18 EST, you write:

<< Why don't you try reading my writing and the writing of the rest of the

I have read your writing and much of the rest of the writing on this list and
many others.  Nice condescension, though.  Excellent technique.   And of
course all writing is about technique at some point.  Not sure why you're so
hostile to my questions.  I thought I was sincerely trying to get someone to
help me think about these issues and I think it is happening.  I'm not exactly
sure why reference to "serious" discussion type things like Shoptaw's book
should be attacked here when books, theorists, etc.  are mentioned constantly
in order to direct a conversation.  I'm a little offended by the tone of your
post and wonder if I offended you.  However, the fact that the female form has
been kicked around ad nauseum seems obvious to me.  Simply restating it
doesn't help.  And is why serious conversation should occur.

So many of your posts have been interesting and informative.  Never thought
you'd be the type to grind an axe.  Was there some humor in your post that I
missed?

The paper said today that some Sicilian fisherman (aboard the Capitano Ciccio,
or "Captain Fatso") netted a 2000 or so year old bronze statue of a dancing
satyr out of the Mediterranean, in pretty good shape though missing a couple
limbs.  First they caught a leg & then went back later & fished up the rest.
They could have sold it on the market themselves, but they decided to
give it to a local museum.

Poetry makes things happen when it realizes the world is inherently poetic.
"the poetry doesn't matter" [t.s. eliot, very p.c.]

Now of course the satyr is a loaded artypolymorphous whatever.  at least the
boat was loaded.  the article said some of the fisherman said why don't
we toss the leg overboard & just keep the rest, it was so heavy.  Ahab
fortunately said "no, fellas".

Laurence Sterne wasn't the first man to write in the manner that Cixous
describes as experimental, and the Brontes got away with pretending to be
mainstream. Their writing wasn't obviously brilliant to anyone until it
was revealed to be so. Somebody a long time ago decided that rhymes ending
with an unstressed syllable were "wierd" and "experimental." The
designation was certainly applied by a mainstream writer and while the
designation is rich with suggestion about attitudes about aesthetic camp,
it's prosodically nonsensical. Mainstream and "experimental" writers have
been more-or-less communicating with language for a long time, and
mainstream and "experimental" writers have been unselfconsciously enjoying
each other's writing for almost as long as there's been writing, and
usually without the need of a translator. So the differences must be
relatively superficial. I don't know that the suggested
aesthetic difference, however slight or major, is important to any agenda,
but I would be intrigued if it exists. Rather than quoting theorists why
not present a text and explain convincingly why it has to be by a member
of one or another aesthetic camp?

Must pipe in my agreement with Henry, that the world is inherently poetic, not
poetry driving the world.  (thanks for the satyric image!)

When Olson wrote "I have an ability..." it has always been my take that he
strained to allow his eye-view to see things in their autonomous reality (a
stance that was greatly aided by Jung's view of Psyce as autonomous).

Thanks Dodie.  All of what you say resonates.  It always gets back to
naming, on one hand, certain purist or mainstream "Ms" feminists might
find us awfully distasteful, or male identified even, certainly
dangerous in our purveys into pornography, on the other hand (I had this
experience in Mexico) other groups would think we were oppressive,
married to political correctness, bourgeois, oppressive to peoples of
color.
        Still, I always err on the side of claiming my names and get
irritated beyond belief by the (prevalent here at Naropa) "why do you
have to name (implying limit) yourself" attitude.  Poetry and Identity
rely on the power of naming.  So yes, an unobservant, anti-zionist jew,
a make-up wearing feminist, a lesbian who sleeps with whoever I want to,
etc etc etc.
        Another note on power.  I don't subscribe to a notion of
scarcity, but the capitalist economy operates on a hoard/lack model so
that the dominant groups end up having 'extra'.  I think it is valid to
skim off this extra by any means necessary, i.e. guilt (shaming), theft,
graffiti, boycotts of barnes and noble, public humilitation etc etc etc.
  Hence, I feel absolutely just in saying that all editors of political
consciousness are morally bound to strive for inclusion of women and
peoples of color parity in their publications UNLESS they are will to
justify the limitations.

Dodie,

Thanks for posting Tim Miller's travel/reading report on the NEA Supreme
Court case. I started out interested in the matter, and I wound up
interested in his style. As you know, I am demonically parochial in my
reading; who is Tim Miller? A performance artist? An artist? A writer? Or
if that kind of categorization seems as silly to you as it sounds to me
now, would you help me out and tell me a little about him? He seems, well,
interesting!

Again, thank you, and good night,
Jordan

I have a bunch of very slightly ding'd copies of Rochelle Owens' _New and
Selected Poems 1961-1996_ (192 pp. pb) and Argentine poet Luisa
Futoransky's _The Duration of the Voyage_ (Spanish-English facing-page,
translated by Jason Weiss, 96 pp. pb) available at half-price, $10.00 for
the Owens and $5.50 for the Futoransky. Shipping is $2.00 for one to three
books in any combination.

Reviews being a very slow tide, only a few are in, including raves from
Library Journal and Publishers Weekly for both books, and they're already
selling rather well--54 copies of Rochelle's ordered this morning, in fact.

Here are two quotes from the back cover of _New and Selected_.

Maureen Owen: "Owens goes cold turkey on the agony and delight of living in
this century. She is the Shaman-genius exploring deeper realities in the
psychic realm. She reaches down into the living, breathing mythical core
and pulls up the forces of chaos spitting and kicking; she gives us back
the hungry power of our own imaginations."

Marjorie Perloff: "In its uncompromising savagery, its passionate rejection
of sentimentality, Rochelle Owens' lyric voice is unique among contemporary
poets. An astonishing body of work."

You can find commentary on Rochelle's work by, among others, Toby Olson,
Jackson Mac Low, Jane Augustine, Maureen Owen and Susan Smith Nash, at
www.thing.net/~grist/l&d/owens/lro-cont.htm, where there are links to
generous selections of her poetry.

Luisa Futoransky's book is her first major representation in English, so
there are fewer resources. Her latest book was recently released in Mexico
in an edition of 15,000 (yup, and they expect to sell them). Maybe we
should all publish in Spanish.

ANNOUNCING NEW BOOKS

Chax Press last spring produced one small book which combined desktop
publishing technology with hand bookmaking processes. That was THE MASQUE
OF RHYME, by Bob Perelman.

This winter/spring, we decided to really explore some bookmaking in this
way which is new to us, and now have some books to announce -- books which
were first made available at readings by their authors here in Tucson in
February or March 1998, or are about to be made available at readings here.

They are:

Tom Raworth and Charles Alexander
Three Poems and Pushing Water (part seven)
        This one is a dos-a-dos book, meaning it can be read from either side to
the middle, one such reading being Tom Raworth's Three Poems, the other
being Charles Alexander's Pushing Water (part seven). The text pages of the
book are produced on the desktop. The covers are letterpress printed, and
two color images (one by Tom Raworth and one by Cynthia Miller) have been
placed on the covers via color inkjet printing. Cover papers are Arches
cover paper. Endsheets are Japanese chiri paper; middle-sheet dividing the
work by the two poets is an Indian decorative paper. The book is hand sewn
with Irish linen thread. Numbered and signed by the authors.


Rae Armantrout
Writing The Plot About Sets
        Four poems by Armantrout, whose titles are "Writing," "The Plot," "About,"
and "Sets." The poems are designed and printed on the desktop. Covers are
Arches cover paper which has been painted in various colors by mixing
acrylic paint and water in a spritzer bottle and spraying the pages, a
process which was accomplished by Cynthia Miller. A title label, printed on
Asian decorative red paper, is pasted onto the cover. The book has been
hand sewn with Irish linen thread. Numbered and signed by the author.


Tenney Nathanson
One Block Over
        A single long poem by Nathanson, this book's text was produced on the
desktop. The cover paper is a strong, blue denim-colored fine art paper,
and the title has been rubber stamped on the cover. At 44 pages, the book
was too long for the single-signature sewing of most other books in this
series, so we sewed the book by hand with a coptic stitching which remains
exposed on the spine.  Signed by the author


Lydia Davis
Blind Date
        The only book of fiction in this series, this is an until-this-moment
unpublished story by Davis. This book is larger than the others, at 11
inches tall by 5.5 inches wide. It is not sewn, rather contains sheets
pasted together and folded to form an accordion structure which is pasted
into boards covered with decorative paper. This book is currently in
progress in our studios and will be ready by April 22. It will be numbered
and signed by the author.


Lisa Cooper
Tilt Rail
        A set of poems by Cooper written on the occasion of the performance by the
Rob Blakeslee Quartet in Tucson. This book has not yet been made, but is in
the works and will be ready by April 22. We are currently choosing the
papers for covers. It will be hand sewn, numbered, and signed by the author.


All books have been produced in small editions, ranging from 100 to 120. We
prefer to sell these books as a set of 5, and require that at least 3 books
be ordered together. Each book sells for $8. Buying a set of three (your
choice)for $24 gets you free shipping and handling. Buying all five gets
you a ten per cent discount as well as free shipping and handling.

We also have just a few copies available of Perelman's The Masque of Rhyme.

If anyone would like to begin a standing order for all books published by
Chax Press, please send us a request as to how you may do so. Also send us
a request for a list of available books and prices, or visit our web site:
http://personal.riverusers.com/~chax/

Please send reservations for books directly to Chax Press via email at
chax@theriver.com

We will process/mail your order as soon as payment is received. If you are
a library we will take your order, ship books, and send you an invoice.

Since when did PBS get commercials? where have I been, I was watching some
show about a time-traveling dog that talked and then all of a sudden a
commercial for 7-11? Strange, I'm used to all of those telethons
So I am intersted in the Sense of time that Scalapino plays with in her work.
In  Defoe especially, there is this sense of travel when you read the text, It
is one of the first texts that I have read where literally the time feels
warped and shifted, no sense of direction in a non-patronizing way- I love it-
What's next for Scalapino, what comes out next?titles?> Presses?
I'll be at the Anselm Berrigan reading this weekend come up and say hi to me
y'all
Ill be the one in the pants, shirt and shoes

The following announcement may be of general interest. Articles in the
inaugural issue will also be of interest re: the gendered discourse threads
of recent days.

                               NOW AVAILABLE:

        ***time-sense:  a quarterly on the art of Gertrude Stein***
                                Volume 1 No.1
                at http://www.tenderbuttons.com/review.html

Sonja Streuber, Editor
Sarah Kornfeld and Stafford, Co-editors

Recent Stein criticism has addressed such issues as her postmodern
disjunctive style, representation and the body, exile and bio/geography,

and Stein's connection with the other arts. Some criticism has tried to
reconstruct her texts, reading them from the point of view of queer,
ethnic, and theological studies. Artists have set her words to other
words, to visual art, to music, and to performance. In other words, the
vastly expanding field of Stein studies today ranges from textual and
psychoanalytic observations to cultural studies and artistic
experiments.
Time-Sense hopes to provide a forum for the ongoing examination of how
we
make sense of Stein in our time.

Contents of Volume 1 No. 1:  Beginning Again

time-sense is currently soliciting written submissions from all
theoretical, critical, and creative approaches, and artistic submissions

in all reproducible media for its upcoming issues and also welcomes
conference-listings, panel abstracts, and inquiries for book reviews:

June:  Gertrude Stein and her Audience
(Deadline:  May 1)

"The thing that is fundamental about plays," writes Stein in her essay,
"Plays," "is that the scene as depicted on the stage is more often than
not one might say it is almost always in syncopated time in relation to
the emotion of anybody in the audience."  Submissions are invited that
investigate Stein's relationship to her audience/"readience":   How
citational/ performative is this relationship?  How/ Does Stein address
audience at all?  (How) Do we understand Stein's writing as
performative?
How do we perform reading Stein?  How does reading Stein perform us?
     This issue will encompass a forum on the teaching of Stein's work
in
the undergraduate classroom, for which all sorts of submissions
(narratives, lesson plans, pedagogical strategies, reading questions,
etc.) are being sought.

September:  Gertrude Stein and the Question(ing) of Politics
(Deadline:  August 1)

In her writing Stein often distinguishes between americans and
Americans,
between french and French, or germans and Germans.  While some critics
maintain that Stein was a pacifist, one researcher recently uncovered in

the Stein-archive a celebratory piece about Petain's Vichy-government.
Submissions are invited that address questions of Stein and nationhood
and
Stein and politics, such as:  What are the implications of Stein's
assigning such distinctive (trans)national labels in the context of her
(and our) understanding of gender, ethnicity, or sexuality?  How have
other modernist and postmodernist scribes commented on Stein's
(re)vision
of nationhood?  Is it possible, at all, to read Stein as a political
artist?

December:  Gertrude, Alice and their Seasons
(Deadline:  November 1)

Stein's understanding of time and /as geography has been widely
explored,
but not the use, representation, and significance of seasons and
seasonal
events, or Jewish religious events, in Stein's and Toklas' writing.  We
know much about Stein's love for the bright summer sun, about her winter

and summer residences, and we know what Alice used to cook at certain
times in the year, but the body of criticism and art on these issues is
rather small.

For submission format, please refer to the submission guidelines at

Its a strange church. An 'Episcopal' 'cathedral'; gothic and something
about the nation-state. A washington national cathedral.

Last sunday evening I sat in on the performance. It was Bach. The
Matthew Passion. Tuneful Erbauliche Gedanken au den Gruen Donnerstag und
Charfreitag.

Probably the bestest realization of the holy-ghost since I saw the
Reverend Al Green in that Memphis church. amen.

A friend and I followed the score we brought lookin for that Augustinian
numerology and Bach's playful representation of notes and hopes and
'meaning'.

Coretta King, in memorium, made an unannounced appearance and said a few
words before the passion. She said, even today, she believes in
something like the beloved community. All things heretofore
nothwithstanding. don'yt even have to do poetry.

30 years before sunday. To the day.

MLK was in washington. Stirring it up for the 'Poor Peoples March on
Washington'.

Johnson already felt the double-cross on vietnam. after you give up the
'voting-rightss' you expect quid pro quo. So that nigger was was up for
grabs. Particularly coming to washington talking trash.

His sermon, 30 years ago sunday at the same pulpit: "On Not Sleeping
Through a Great Revolution".

Bach could tax those Lutherans. St. Matthew is a gorgeous 4-hour
possibility. Nothing much else like it (western civilization and all
that). good singers in the right hall. amen. performance poetry.
particularly from the tenor this night. man, boy-friend had some lungs.
endurance, remembering.

30 years ago they had a plan, these music people in this cathedral, to
do this same piece of music. It was to be the sunday that followed april
fourth.

It was both the national guard and the various policing apparatus that
imposed the curfew after the city started burning.

When sunday came they cancelled the passion. Because it was after curfew
time. Armored personnel carriers in the street. and shit like that.

They never played it again. Until last sunday. something about '98.

Not that its, even,  the absence of redemption. But whether it is the
absence of the possibility of even remembering. Sometimes even in that
forgetting-poetics.

Da ging hin der Zwolfen einer, mit Namen Judas
Ischarioth, zu den Hohenpriestern und sprach: "Was wolit
ihr mir geben? Ich will ihn euch verraten." Und sie boten
ihm dreisig Silberlinge.

ok, done,

merica

I would argue that this "tinkering" with Mark's post producing the above
sentence produces statements which are demonstrably inaccurate, at least
the sentences above are demonstrably inaccurate.  Was it
your view that the prior, unmodified statements were equally untrue?  I'm
kind of slow about things like this, just trying to figure out what it is
you are contesting, as mainstream writer heavily influenced by Alice Notley.

well, she was wrong, wasn't she?  Nietzsche tried to teach 'them' exactly
that, and became a textbook in the Third Reich.  The nsdap were pretty
disobedient, all things considered (versailles, Munich putsch etc).  "how
is it that a woman is the only genius of our age": it isn't.  Maybe she
should have hesitated.

This post from Michael Corbin referencing Bach's Matthaus Passion, makes
me long for an anti-poetics. MC is is right -- nothing matches this work
for beauty of form , for poetry of atonement/remberance/desiring:

mache dich mein herzen rein

I feel his post deeply. I feel his memories and I think his desires
amidst the history he retells, personal and national, grieving really.
Droplets of blood in the triplets of the printed score as the heart
breaks.

I remember also being stunned watching a film. "heimat"--fascinating
film, hours and hours of footage putting me there in the Germany of the
Hitler time, a cynical lyrical film. At one point some of the "lead"
characters were in a movie theater watching a filmed performance of the
Matthau's Passion and there were tears at the strains of the aria,
"lord, make my heart pure" tears on the faces of the uniformed Nazi's in
the theater, bitter, bitter irony -- that such music could lend itself
to such purposes of Nationalism ...

I think it best to disentangle poetry from politics. I am only following
Benjamin here. I am not claiming an independent judgment on the value of
aesthetic form. I think that the thesis that mc mediates on,

>

is a dangerous thesis.

Maybe what is needed on the gender thread is an anti-poetics of gender
too. I think that is what I am hearing some women say on the gender
thread, lets disentangle those constructions from what we write ...

There is no pure point of view, no certainty of gender if we get down to
telling our own stories ... no certainty that our poetics contribute to
the "good" cause ... every reason to write then from where you are as I
think many on this last have been attempting to do recently.

Katy:
I didn't intend to say anything about your tinkering because I thought it
was silly on its face. Because of syntax with a little tinkering--in this
case primarily replacing nouns--all discourses are in this sense
interchangeable. Tinkering, at any rate, is easier than an analysis of
language-use as gendered.

Joe,

I'm an admirer of your work and thought. Very sorry to hear about the d
of tenure. We may well be hiring, tho not for this fall. We've JUST
filled (or rather are about to make an offer) for a one-yr Visiting
position, but that will be redefined and then (we hope) approved.

Best wishes!

Forwarded from Halvard Johnson, of another list, who comments that "It's
interesting how, when a poet dies, the *New Yorker* often manages to
find something in its files to publish . . . The Apr. 6 issue has this
by Hilda Morley (1916-1998)."

Had they ever published her work before, I wonder--


Your Color

More in some ways than when you were alive, I try to
please you,
            to find I am of your way of
            thinking,   as with these red carnations:
they're your color.
                      For myself I'd always
chosen white, saying--
that red's too strong for thinking
in a room, too much.
                     But now I love these flowers,
having grown, these years ("mourning" they said),
more into what you wished:
                           a clearer form now, seeing
this redness (suspended) above green stems as
thumbprints of Mediterranean earth that
you belong to,    crop of a heart's blood on
this city's grayness,
this room's whiteness.

Yaya’s Rapture
        for Carla Harryman

"The things you think are funny"

In a crowded room. Chaos. Books and flies.  Books fly.  Pastels,
flourescents, named after birds and Disney movies as far back.  The
city, until.  Berlin.  Kruschev wants it.  Now!  In the west, feeding
their addiction for metaphor, they watch as closely as they can. They
believe.  They make it religion, craving a national pastime to which
they’ll all know the tune.  Humming as mediation.  Familial.  Fat.
Flat-chested androgyne amazonians.  Spandex, then lycra, more washable,
evaporates your sweat.  AT$T destroys the last real phone booths on West
End Ave.  The beginning of a new century.  Fortuitous.  Premonitory.
Still trying to make friends.  There we were.

Grace loved all the different houses, imagined them as names for her
identity.   She was incorrect.  She couldn’t take them along, in or
outside her skin, then fading, the pores becoming too large. Drilling
holes into her various parts.  By now conventional.  It was the
beginning of a new century.
“Djuna, you still alive in there?”
“Do I look like someone with a Driver’s License?”
I wanted to touch her, I was sure she could have been the driver and
would let her drive me anywhere.  I’d parallel park for her whenever she
got nervous.   Instead, I forgot she was there and continued window
shopping. Impulse spending.  You could argue I don’t need another bottle
of perfume.  Perhaps Djuna watched, she was known to time travel, and
was expert at being several places at once.   Here the speakers of the
language have the hardest time.  What to call it, in, on, at, or near.
I know I’m fantasizing and it’s not nice to metamorphose an esteemed and
ancient women of modernist letters into a voyeur solely for the sake my
sexual pleasure.  Yet, how would she know unless it is true this is what
happened?  I could see both the horse drawn buggies and the helicopters,
shipping water from anywhere, desalinated as a contrived plea, forgive
us please for dumping all that toxic waste.  The shit still smells.
Every Jew will tell you that in great detail and I can say this because
I am one.  No reason to hide here, you’d question me either way.   Even
if she didn’t have an issue with Jews, I don’t think she’d go for me in
any of my stages.  She might say my difference was attractive, most
certainly in the wee hours.  They say if the hand fits.  Well, it fit
and that mattered.  It wasn’t the chaos we minded, it was his beauty got
us.  We no longer needed to argue about the forms.  They made attractive
envelopes.  Returned to senders.  Instructions included.

instructions:

there is one cunt for every penis, those manufactured in the latter day.
a lump for every breast.  post mammogram.  post paid.  united we post.
the heart dripping.  the bleeding heart.  someone said that.  duh, this
is a game, I made it up though have little to do with the rules.  they
keep changing.  pick a city any city.  no, pop. at least 100 thousand.
ok, so you have this city in mind.  find the main road.  where the
pedestrians cross and by what means they know it is their turn.  if it’s
a lit up little white man you lose.

two.  pick a city any city.  no, at least 49 languages spoken.  no
divisions for doggerel.

three.  pick a moon.  any moon.  wait, there has to be a neighbor and a
dog.  no french.

four.  pick a woman.  any woman.

air travel.  rules:  free miles are earned.  if you are a woman, by each
penis.  if you are a man, you fly free until you contract a venereal
disease.  if it’s HIV, it’s you who has to find the cause,  you get
three women’s bodies free--for your experiments.  the fourth is of a
goat.  and a strict vegetarian diet but for once a year when you will
bathe in a pool of pork. if you contract trichinoses you go to b.f.
skinner.  he’ll put you in a box.

next.  pamplona with ernest hemingway.  brett will serve the drinks.
the first human to grab her ass will turn into a tower of babel.  the
second will speak every language.  the third spills her words over the
mast.  when the church bells ring, there is a race to the beginnings.
the first one who gets there dies.  all the points are divided in the
manner of paint-by-number.  if you are the first to run out of pink you
must lie about everything you’ve understood about your character up
until that moment.  the trick is that everyone will believe you though
with a piercing cackle you tell them it’s a ruse.  in this game there is
no need for the truth.  it goes underappreciated and has nothing to do
with your salary.

Keston,

I think you will have an easier time posting to the UberList once you get
out of Cambridge (Mass) and back to original Cambridge. After all, you've
been indicted twice here for your e-mail address. I mean, I can see how
people may presume things if a listee's address was johndoe@naziparty.org
but you've been trashed, or attempted to be trashed, because your
intelligence and diligence have landed you a temporary association with a
well-known, well-stereotyped university.

Anyway, although it's interesting what Stein said about Germany, I'm not
interested. Or, is it: interested, not interesting?

This is from BREWSIE & WILLIE, after the second war resulting from the first
war:

"And it's all because everybody just greedy wants to manufacture more than
anybody can buy, well than you know what happened after the last war we cut
off immigration, we hoped to sell enough to foreign countries, foreign
countries didn't want to buy and we had the depression.  My God yes, said
Jo, we did have the depression.  Yes and then we had to fight, and yes we
won but we used up a hell of a lot of raw material and now we got to make a
club to make those foreign countries buy from us, and we all got to go home
to make some more of those things that use up the raw material and that
nobody but our own little population wants to buy.  Oh dear, said Brewsie."

Now that's interesting. But as interesting as the following from Walt
Whitman (who is known to be naked on a Website somewhere)?:

        Resist much, obey little;
   Once unquestioning obedience, once fully enslaved;


Perhaps this is the spirit Stein sought to convey to the American officer?

Mark--

I disagree. All discourses are NOT interchangeable in this way--

I'm not talking about mad libs here--I'm talking about discourses that
require binary and oppositional structures--with one of the binaries
marked and one of them unmarked ("normal").

Also: as per your apparent accusation that I haven't "proved" my points,
or that I have otherwise shied away from discussing my views.... what?

I think I've said a lot about my feelings as a women (among other things)
in the world of poetry.

I have not been making claims for anyone else--

And I never said anything that ever ever implied that men needed
"translators" (or v.v.) for women's writing.

I think you're crazy if you think the social context within which poetry
is written has NO analyzable effect on actual poetry.

Why must I say that women's writing is "different" across the board for it
to be valid that perhaps some writing by women could be analyzed in part
through a gender lens?

Best,
Katy

Gee Billy, what a strange rejoinder.  If I'm threatened I'd not noticed
but hey that'd of course explain my remarks, historically grounded
though they are.  Your belief that the Germans were incredibly obedient
however - well, I don't know; are you under the impression that
the Germans voted for Auschwitz, or is there some other less concrete
teleology that took the quick route from Germanness to genocide?  Why
would I want to shine her shoes? YOU seem pretty obedient to me, to the
usual default inflation of an obvious sentiment: "TEACH THEM blah blah".
And it would have been an American to say so, naturlich. Were the world
that simple.  And not ANOTHER resentful gripe about Harvard?   I've just
got here - what is it with poeple on this list and Harvard?


Maybe you could consider how your note, though making the usual groaning
and slavering noises re: Stein (whom I actually love), might be seriously
offensive to Germans?  Or is that irrelevant?

Don, who's thesis is dangers, Mark's or mine?  I couldn't tell.  They are
2 sides of the same coin.  Poetry is didactic.  Mark's concern for
justice/utopia is the flip side of the idea of the world being inherently
poetic - i.e. the concern for "reading" the world as it is.  By inherently
poetic I'm not talking about Pollyanna lala-land - poetry is epic/tragic
as well as joyful/beautiful.  I thought that was what Michael Corbin was
saying too - as well as what you said.  I just think sometimes as talkers-
about-poetry we don't give poetry enough credit.  We're always saying stuff
like experiment is liberating, dashes are masco-feminine, blah blah.
Poetry when it hits the fan is a correlated turbine turbulence - don't
get in its way.  It's almost as powerful as reality.  Maybe this is what
you meant by "telling stories".  and what Rachel Democracy meant when she
picked up Ishmael off Q's coffin, or something like that.  - henry Gould

Do I live in Japan? Have I lived anywhere?
Do I wander in a desert? Is this Shumer, Akkadia?
In Akkadia I have seen ghosts; in Japan as well.
I am inundated by ghosts. I am inundated by ghosts.
They do not speak to me; I do not hear voices.
They are invisible to me; I do not see wraiths,
uncanny shadows, the glimpse of drawn faces,
in the middle of a howling night.
They push and pull at my body. They pull it apart.
They pull at the mind leg arm penis. I do not know
if they have eyes or mouths.

Shall there be more? Their limbs form breasts
on my body. Their lips form cavities against my throat.
They break my back with swollen flesh. My back
has been broken in many places. I am told
my eyes have bright red light, one can see for meters
around my skin. They take my skin. I think they say
"This is JNJ," over and over again, I understand
them. They sway on my knees; my nipples are hard
with inner curves of other fingers.

Their lips

(this is not good either; there's no broken conceptualism. don't I worry
about the limbs, they might not fit on. but that shouldn't affect the
list, these limb problems, but then again there's just writing.)

Alright, I will bite on this one....and be the devil's advocate....

WWII was initially a result of industrialists, not a political party led by
the tragic-comic figure of Hitler. Hitler was as silly figure-head, chosen
because he was extremely brain washable and controllable. Look to who
profited from armaments manufacture and you have the answer as to what it
was about. Even the part about having a scapegoat to blame for all the
financial blood sucking that went on. I think we do have to wonder how much
foreign influence spurred on Germany such that it led to the ultimate chain
of events....including the diminishing of Stalinist Russia's ability to
present any really strong competition for a long while after the exhaustion
brought on by the war against Germany's exhausting and misdirected efforts
to conquer Russia.

Now there is not much chance of a depression, or even a significant
recession, in Europe for years ahead from now......

1). Eastern Europe, former Warsaw Pact and Russia, are very needy and greedy.

2). Europe does not want America to be the ONLY significant military power.
    The E.C. definitely does NOT want a "one empire" world and to be a colony
    of that one empire.

    So we can now expect Europe arming itself to the teeth. Deja-vu, but for
    very different reasons than before.

>        Resist much, obey little;

The electric rule is that resistors burn out, eventually, every time they
revolt, though it consumes a lot of voltage to do it.....

Though I do tend to agree with Whitman on that....in terms of following
any totalistic ideology. There that comment is definitely appropriate. I
wonder that quote says about Whitman's time period, around the time of
the Civil War and living in the North ?  Lincoln as the figure head of
a tending towards tyranny or totalism nation ?  Interesting possibility.

After all, the North saw the South becoming more powerful, more industrialized,
and decided to put a stop to it. They wanted cheap slave labour for their
own factories, except that they paid "subsistence" wages rather than providing
shacks and plots of land on plantations. Also, what is the difference
between a slave and a domestic servant ? Often, in those days, no difference
whatsoever, except that many a servant could not afford a home to go to, and
slaves all had somewhere to refer to as their home. Odd that the southern
slave owner was expected to take good care of his property and not abuse it.
It was
essentially expected of him by his society and most complied to the standards
of that time period. Slaves were too essentially too costly to abuse.
Servants in the north were inexpensive. There was only a very small wage to
be paid, and if one servant sickened or did not perform as expected of them,
they were simply gotten rid of and replaced without capital loss.

In the north the northern factory owner did not have that kind of
requirement placed upon him as to caring for his slaves, either. The abuses
upon coloured workers, and others, including child labour, in Northern
factories certainly rival anything the southern owners of slaves ever did.
So what was the civil war about ?  Emancipation ?  Not likely. More slaves
for the north, except double speak did not allow that word to be used
anymore, and industrial supremacy, wiping out the growing southern competition.

When we place Whitman in that scenario, it looks a lot different. I think we
need to read Whitman's words in that light, and see what they then tell us
about that time period in which he lived.

Peace.

Katy: Yes, I'd be crazy, etc., but I was talking about a particular claim,
that the language itself, not the concerns, is somehow gender-marked
(whether the markers are male or female--there, I've marked both poles now).
It might be informative to investigate how various female writers have
indicated gender when using a male as mouthpiece (the aforementioned
Brontes, Willa Cather, etc.) and vice versa. Maybe this has been done?

Standard,

As I read your post you were saying that your fears were coming true, that
we were talking about content instead of form, and then you brought me up
as an example of a content-monger.  I felt this was very condescending--if
you'd used someone else as the bad example, I'd surely had not gotten so
invested.  This is different than just bringing up the issue of form and
asking a question.

I don't believe in this big division of content and form anyway, as if form
were the holy spirit and content the corrupt rotting flesh that needs to be
powdered and perfumed . . .  Remember the old word logocentrism, maybe we
should revive it here.

If I misunderstood you I am sorry, but I just read bell hooks latest book
when I had stomach flu.  She's infected me.  Even though I have lots of
problems with the Wounds of Passion (and want to send Nate Mackey a bouquet
of roses in sympathy), it does make one think about the gaze, the white
gaze, the male gaze.  I keep thinking about her incessant (and irritating
from my perspective) cataloguing of people--everybody is introduced as a
type:  racial, gender, professional, class, judgements of attractiveness,
personality flaws in these long lists of adjectives.  It all sounds so
reductive, but by doing this she's breaking down the idea of a "norm."  No
one gets by without a list of adjectives clinging to them, no one is the
norm.

M says:

WWII was initially a result of industrialists, not a political party led by
the tragic-comic figure of Hitler. Hitler was as silly figure-head, chosen
because he was extremely brain washable and controllable. Look to who
profited from armaments manufacture and you have the answer as to what it
was about.



I don't think this is true at all.  Industrialists (some) may have
believed themselves to have made this choice up until about 1933-4, but it
rapidly became clear thereafter that their role in a fully integrated
state would be entirely dictated by the government (as was in fact the
case).  Funk and then Speer directed all industrial production, even
ordering that many factories abandon their regular output and concentrate
exclusively on the production of a single item.  Industry in Germany was
centralized and improved -in order that- the war effort could be
sustained, and not the reverse.

Vanish


Peace where the wound is, flapping like a burnt egg,
loose with bubbles whose odour bursts to
spread gold over fawn spikes of ambition.  It
makes nothing of me, nor of the face frozen in wood.

Process, relished, washed carefully in tide, fasting
at corners with ceaselessness.  Wish
to seep gaping into that burst flesh and be
cell of its kite-like body, but patently do not.

Instead, to feast on saw grass, as a slim hope
that all curricular indications and graded projects
do not stop.  But that ceaselessness seems
different, a cut to limp the bright open flow.

In hoping proof, it's mentioned, and when the sun
turns collapses like atoms of an open
flower, wrecking all solar provisions.  Peace which drew
me to its bright flesh pulps and pulses without verge or entry.

A thought experiment: Refer to women poets simply as poets and call male
poets "men poets."  Teach a course on American poetry reading H.D. Stein,
Howe, Plath, etc... include a few men poets as tokens if you get
complaints from the male students. Spend some time earnestly discussing
the masculinism of the token men poets, then return to the more universal
concerns of the "poets."  In other words, treat the masculine as the
linguistically marked gender.  Try it for just a day.  I wrote an article
in which I used the terms "poet" and "male poet"--it was not all that
difficult.

(I missed something--why are all the gender posts listing their subject as
"idle chitchat"?  The title of my post, a line from Roussel, is an ironic
reference to this.)

april 2 nathaniel mackey read from his prose and poetry at the university
of minnesota, to a full house of students, faculty and community folks.  he
started w/ a section of one of the letters from his epistolary novel Djbot
Baghostus's Run, describing the performance of the fictional band the
Mystic Horn Society, which reaches apotheosis in a blend of paganini's
caprice #9 and albert ayler's ghosts that takes off and becomes its own
thing. then he read poems from School of Udhra and not-yet-published work.
it was exciting, rhythmically jazz, very complex syntactically (and of
course semantically) meditations around absence, art, aspiration (yeah,
lots of alliteration).  then today he lectured my class, American Poetry
Since 1940, on HD's influence on his work. It was terrific.  I guess he'll
be giving the same paper in chicago in a coupla weeks. highly recommended;
dense, duncan-mediated, cecil taylor thrown in  as well as kamau brathwaite
and oceanic consciousness ("tidalectics"), good info for those of us in the
midwest. tonight he reads again, at the Nomad Gallery in St Paul, to "the
community," i.e. not the university, though of course there will be
overlap.  it's been a pleasure to have him here and in case there is anyone
on the list who has not yet had the reading or cd-listening pleasure
(though there are probably very few of you who now fall into that
category), by all means check out his titles.

Gee--I always thought it'd be so excellent to put together an anthology
with exactly that idea.  I guess the cats out of the bag now.

P.S.  Just coming back from Harry Mathew lecture/reading at DU where he
discussed the possibilities of translation vis a vis Oulipo models and
said that the pleasure in the random applications with rules was the
same as a child's (I heard 'boy's') love for "hard games with tough
rules."  (I never did like those much as I'm sure many of the boys out
there did not, I don't know if I believe it's a gender thing but it
certainly comes in handy as a graceful way out.)  Later read a bunch of
oulipo-inspired works, very vast, global, temporal (Cronogram for 1997,
1997 words--all roman numeral letters translated into number, but for I,
of which there were a specific/relevant amount, I forget how many).

One possible alternative scenario is that they might be forbidden to read
anything other than technical and business journals. Those who can afford it
might be able to purchase bootleg copies of 20th century poets, from
underground sources, but the penalties might be extremely harsh.....

Thanks for reading it - I'll post a few more.  I do think that she is an
important and distinct writer, whose work is not merely thoughtful but is
real -thought-, and whose new work is a mediation and a reengineering of
the possibility of several kinds of expression, and of several kinds of
sentiment.  Hopefully the other poems I post will bear this out!  Her new
book is to be published by John Kinsella's SALT press this month.

Wagons decked with excuse drew past

my corpse wills itself upward in honest parody.
In objectiveness of denser gas, racked

Lay me on a hard board.  So if

This is a message from our sysadmin: it looks almost like one of those
Oulipo word-substitution games. Since we're in the weather business, all of
our servers have meteorological-sounding names, which can result in
approximate surrealism when read by outsiders.

> It has become necessary to restart Hail. We will be shutting Hail down
> on Tuesday Evening (7th of April), at 5:00pm. This means that Thunder
> will failover to Rain. (PCs may notice a failure, and then carry on as
> usual - Macs will be able to access files by connecting to Rain rather
> than Hail.) Hail will be up and running by 5:30ish.


I remember when the web was young, and many universities here seemed to
have Tolkein-derived names for their servers: gandalf.otago.ac.nz amd so
forth. This probably reflected the reading habits of Comp Sci students more
than anything else, but resulted in some odd moments. I was wondering
whether anyone else had any examples of the poetics of computing
nomenclature?

Tom Beard's header until I read his message was going to be, I expected, an
explanation mock or authentic of the Silence of the List--that either due
to bad weather or Passover, people werent posting, and whats more, Tom
Beard ("Hail, Shutdown!") was either pleased or pretending-pleased about
this.

So his actual message, while interesting, made me feel a sense of anti-climate..

Bowering, generally as well-informed as he is modest, b-c'd me & said the
List was this quiet because everybody was reading his new book, _Piccolo
Mondo_ , which is up on the web at Coach House Books.

Perhaps. All I know is that I mourn the effusions of the distant past, the
maelstrom surrounding the worth of Tom Clark's poetry & morality, the high
tides of love-poetics abutting St. Valentine's Day, the lightning-bolts of
Kent Johnson's persecution--twas an Age of Gold, is this an Age of Lead?--

or, this tired lady, if you prefer... going to work, and lurking, and
generally corresponding  take energies,   as well as give 'em, i
s'pose,  but so much of interest to comment on:

1. to whomever posted about fatimah tuggar   a big thank you!! you've
recruited a new fan. went to see those two exhibits in nyc you posted
about, and then today (couple weeks later) went to see her talk at the
exhibit "keeping track of the joneses."
 some things i found inneresting:

that she collages her collages digitally --oops, i mean on the computer,
not digitally like fingers. but also that many of her pieces use "real"
objects--a metal box with photos; cushions with photos of family members
on them, around a digital-image round collage of an eating mat filled
with products centrifugally (cant spell that) shooting; one collage was
slide-projected onto a bath of yoghurt in a clay pot! you could barely
make out the women holding pots collage in it, but once you made it out,
you couldnt not see it!


2. in response to the "how can you tell?" gender thread, well, i have to
say that i dunno what you kin tell a woman or a man by what her/his
writing/artwork looks and sounds like (naw!), but i _can_ say, for
example, that when i first saw that post about tuggar i didnt know she
was a woman, and when i visited the website and somehow found out, well
it made a big 'ol adrenalin difference to little chit me.
not sure all of why, but it's a sexual feeling, & too a role-model
thing. not that i'm not turned on by poetry by men, and shit yeah, many
men are also my role models, but...there it is. some kinda excitement.
and relief and green-light GO! You TOO could do...
like dodie (i think it was) said  but in diffrent context  thank god for
kathy acker.  it's been important for me to be able to see people about
whom i could say yeah, "what SHE said" or "i wanna grow up to be like
HER."  i mean, i woulda loved gertrude stein no matter what her
plumbing, but her being a lesbian made me--a late-teen-kid then-- her
loving-faithful.

3. oh yeah, one more thing.  in the basement floor of the new museum
gallery where we saw fatimah tuggar, we saw also a flea circus exhibit
by another woman, Maria Fernanda Cardoso--complete with video
performance of said circus, wherein the artist reigned Queen, along with
related banners, placards, and glassed-in preserved fleas in progress of
death-defying feats, such as tightrope-walking and getting shot outta
cannonballs!   o marvelous mayhem! amusement! what technical skill! flea
circus-ing has a whole history (as do fleas in human society) about
which i hadnt ('til now) hadda clue.

No, David; the Age of Plastic. My friend the late John Forbes put it thus:

"The Age of Plastic" (copyright the Estate of John Forbes 1998)

        Thanks to John Tranter for posting this nifty poem by the late John
Forbes. "Minor poet, conspicuously dishonest" indeed would look funny, even
screwed into a brick wall--the brick wall of the building I was born in,
for instance. And it doesnt stop there. It's been amusing imagining which
friends and enemies' birthplaces a like plaque could be attached to--who
would be able to take it in fun, and who wouldnt.

It is the case I am too often flippant. "Plastique", which ours is also the
Age of, is nothing to laugh at. Persons undone by credit card debt
likewise. Then there's the difficulty we have disposing of plastic once
we've had enough of it.

But Forbes' poem had more than that sentence to it. The "parts of speech"
bit for instance. Who was John Forbes and why havent I heard of him?

John Tranter, are you the man who played my ukelele 25 years ago?   David

A floor of Goldman Sachs had Disney characters.  Bankers Trust had mostly

You could tell which business managers were alive by the names.

They're pretty much all numbers now.

we used to have a scheme based on the Wizard of Oz,
though the only ones I remember were EmeraldCity &
Toto... the servers I work with now seem to have no
scheme whatsoever, or only the remains of one -
Choengmon (a beach in Vietnam), Alexandria, Alex,
Chronos, Digilib...

somewhere on campus is a set of servers named for
Swedish foods.

Thanks Keston Sutherland for the info about the work of Andrea
Brady.  Eye don't often encounter work that strikes me so on first
experience-- the last time was a year ago when eye first saw/heard/
read the polymorphous stylings of Wendy Kramer, whose work is
the most synaesthetic eye think eye have ever encountered in that it
not only must be read but also viewed and heard in order to
experience its full effect.  Brady's work might not be visual, but
it strikes more of the sensory imagination which eye am all for!
Thanks again.

oh dear...
poor nietzche again getting the blame that isn't his...
kinda like blamming the bible (which speaks out agsint violence, and for
tolerance) for the crusades. it's the people interpreting who are to blame.
i guess we should note that if it wasn't for nietzsche there also wouldn't
be modern art (including our beloved poetics) in the way we know it.
individuality... nihilistic questioning... etc. these are nietzche.
so: no. she was right (as she so often is).
too bad so few listen.

I agree, provocative. Even though I don't share her hegelian hopes, she
dissimulates not at all the darkness one can give over to without them
hopes. I was haunted for a while by the books companion volume, _Love's
Work: A Reckoning with Life_ when a friend, like Rose, faced their
untimely death. Facing squarely, (a geometric truth? triangularly?), I
guess.

I do think we try and live in that city between Athens and Jerusalem.

More, I was wondering (maybe needing, wanting to write) what is our
Trauerspiel?

wasn't blaming nietzsche for anything, besides the question of Stein's
right/wrongness turns neither on his repute nor on his achievement,
regarding which I agree with you.  Still, I believe that so offhand a
remark, despite its obvious expandability and the circumstances of its
occurrence, can hardly be 'right' given the complexity and significance of
what it hopes to address.  So we far western europeans and americans just
'teach them' to be disobedient, do we?  What an arrogant confidence, what
charmless and laconic esprit.  Maybe she's right for the lover of
politically sonorous epigrams, but for a nation of people?  For the
Germans?  How the fuck can she be 'right'?

Hi all,

This is perhaps a strange request: last night I had the most remarkable
dream about extraterrestrials (something I've never dreamed about
before) perhaps masquerading as god figures, but it occurs to me that
I've always been too cynical to do more than assume extraterrestrials
must exist. Does anyone have any reading to suggest? I'm not
particularly interested in "proof" stories or "scary alien" stories,
perhaps something more along the lines of what they might represent to
us philosophically/psychologically?

I love the way Juliana Spahr depicts the effects of "alien" beings on our
beings in her book RESPONSE (Sun & Moon, 1996). Notley has some new poems
that deal with aliens (I think I saw them in GARE du NORD #2).

There are some scary books by Whitley Streiber--one of them is called
COMMUNION and is very scary. I'm still afraid of the dark! (The most scary
thing is that his aliens can "get you" even if someone else is in your
bed--or even if there's a cat or dog around... They can put others into
trances and stop time and stuff like that...).

The movie version, which stars Christopher Walken,is very scary--but also
surprisingly philosophical in its approach and in its implications... I
highly recommend it.....


Best,
Katy

besides, N. explicitly condemns "nihilistic" thinking as a sickness - it's
one of the few things he's unequivocal about.  To think that he
gave us that as a gift is, surely, to misinterpret. Wouldn't the
blameworthy interpretors have misinterpreted Stein's comment also?

well the arrogence lies with the silly person who asked the question.
but the answer is a good one. how do you get people to think? teach them to
disobey, question, etc.
but we're all agreeing here i think, so this is basically fruitless.
been defeding nietzche to my wife so much lately that i guess i'm just in
the habit.

i meant "nihilism" as a means to destroy in order to rebuid, which nietzche
did support. this thinking eventually turned into existentialism, etc. etc.
blah blah.

Try _Broken Images, Broken Selves: Dissociative Narratives in Clinical
Practice_ (Brunner/Mazel), edited by Stanley Krippner and Susan Marie
Powers. My friend, Susan, has an essay in it on Alien Abduction
Narratives.

you might also want to try that controversial Harvard prof who counsels
alien abductees. Can't remember his name. And i'm not picking on harvard.

John Forbes was a brilliant Australian poet and a friend of mine who died
in late January, basically from living too fast. He reminded me of Ted
Berrigan in too many ways. The line "Minor poet, conspicuously dishonest"
is I believe a deliberate midquote of a line of Basil Bunting's, who said
that he wanted as his epitaph the phrase"Minor poet, conspicuously honest."
To an Australian ear, a phrase like that needed the piss taken out of it.

You can read more about John Forbes in the special memorial issue of my
free Internet magazine Jacket, Issue Number 3, at the address below.
No, I've never played the ukelele. There is an Australian poet, Richard
Tipping, who is noted for his gift of entertaining roomfulls of people on
that instrument. Perhaps you're thinking of him.

Katy's already suggested Spahr's book "Response" which is a good one.  Let
me recommend a novel "Mysterious Skin" by a young New Yorker Scott Heim, it
is really terrific and is totally about the psychological appeal of aliens,
why we need them, etc.  When I was almost 30 I came to "realize" that I had
been abducted by aliens briefly in childhood, and I drew upon this
experience to write a memoir "Santa," which now appears in my book "Little
Men" (which of course you don't want to miss in any case).   I got some of
it right, but Scott and Juliana get more of it.

Posting this for Avec Books:
-----------------------------

Avec Books congratulates Keith Waldrop, winner of the America
Award in Literature (poetry category) for _Silhouette of the
Bridge_ (Avec Books 1997).

New from Avec Books:

_Jackknife & Light_ by Michelle Murphy

The poems of _Jackknife & Light_ (which was a finalist in the
National Poetry Series of 1996) give their meanings up
slowly, with a languorous precision and care. They aspire
to-and demand-what Murphy defines as a unique "method of
looking" and reading...and thinking.

Murphy's writings have appeared in a wide range of
publications, from literary journals such as ZYZZYVA and
Five Fingers Review to the cyber-mag, Hot-Wired. Her poem,
"13 Versions of Surrender" (included in Jackknife & Light)
has served as the basis of a song cycle by Bay Area composer
Erling Wold, produced in Germany in 1997.

Paperback.  95 pages. List price: $10; ISBN: 1-880713-11-X.
Distributed by Ingram Book Company (titles unlimited program);
Baker & Taylor; Small Press Distribution and (as of mid-April )
www.amazon.com


Advance praise for _Jackknife & Light_:

"Mouthed, Michelle Murphy's poems are mouthed onto the page.
They're wet with the pears, apples, mangoes of an
indeterminate landscape, part myth, part memory, "smoke on
everything." The great tenderness of her sensibility! In
Jackknife & Light's insistently meditative prose poems,
where past and present overturn each other, and narrative
skin is peeled into fragments and run-ons, Murphy
brightlines human intimacies-between lovers, parents and
children, the dead and the surviving-with a remarkable
formal inventiveness. "If I had just one story," she writes,
"I'd rather starve than have to live by it." Fortunately,
she has enough imagination, strangeness, and verve to
nourish us all. --Forrest Gander

"...Michelle Murphy's lucid chord-clusters ("mornings of
straight edged white sky, the strict angles of a
harpsichord") are instilled with the hush of ardor: a
passion caught in the act of knowing itself." --Andrew Joron

"Tread carefully here," Michelle Murphy warns us, for "all
is not exactly what it seems." Murphy's primary subject in
this, her brilliant first book, is the beauty that becomes
delicate "when suddenly & endlessly gone." Yet her poems,
through their graceful confusions of secular and spiritual
languages, are prayers that would take "our legacy of doubt"
and somehow "make faith durable." Murphy provides us with "a
method of looking" and listening that is intensely
subjective and attuned to silence, as well as to the
vagaries of a language that can "grow more feral than
imagined." Her finales of seem describe a lost yet sayable
past, and promise "the original shape of our future . . . a
wilderness we never outgrow." -Susan Schultz

hi karen

i've just started doing some research for a lecture i said i'd give about
ufo design.  my take is this: if ufos travel in space & time differently to
our human craft, why do they need to be streamlined?  given ufos jump
between dimensions or whatever it is they're supposed to do, they don't
really need to be streamlined.  given the aliens, being so technologically
advanced, could build their spaceships in an infinite number of ways (say,
an art nouveau ship with a late victorian hatch patterning) why choose a
design that is specifically american 1930s/40s?  answer goes something like
this: because that's when ufo sightings really took off - the late 1940s.
so the design of their spaceships is modelled on the latest most
"technologically advanced" design we can think of, streamlining.

from what little i know, in those days (the 40s), aliens were a lot
friendlier.  a typical abduction would be thus:  farmer bob stops his
pickup in the middle of nowhere one dark & stormy night when two tall
blonde (hmmm!) venusians called him over for a ride in their spaceship.
after a quick tour of the planet/solarsystem/galaxy, they'd lecture farmer
bob about the dangers of nuclear energy, the environmental crisis and
issues about world peace before dropping him off at the pickup again
(hoping of course he would spread the word about these impt issues, after
all someone has to do it now that god's dead).

it was generally not until the 80's that the aliens became nasty.
interestingly, in the 1950s/60s/70s as rockets & telescopes reached out
further into our solar system & beyond, so the aliens came from further
afield.  i guess it's no longer possible to claim to meet farmer bob's
venusians.  pity ...

Aliens were even friendlier in Biblical times.  They helped this obscure
tribe of nomads escape from enslavement in Pharaoh land and gave
them lots of advice on keeping their act together while they wandered
around in the desert eating "manna" (space flakes?).  They gave them
a little model of their ship called the "ark of the covenant" which
was dangerous to touch (for humans, anyway) and sent out light rays
and so on.  But, as a card-carrying Martian myself, who gets his
information from the other side of a singularity horizon, take it
from me: ALIENS R US.  Reporting in from East Atlantis, I remain...

Atlantis

The radio would have me believe the Draconians
are the source of trouble but
action becomes understood as escaping

                                                in space ships
from nuclear warheads
                                                they mark change,

which may once have been understood as catastrophe,
and will later mark crop circles into corn fields of South America.


The Atlanteans and the Draconians are equally to blame for the disaster
but somehow the Draconians fade and the Atlanteans rise.  They survive
though their descendents.  (The Europeans here get a bad rap.)

Everyone wants to feel good so we speak symbolically.

                                        “COW!”

Speaking from the car.

Speaking in the car, she refered to black and white, light and dark.
I remembered my etiquette and bounced back to “defining terms.”

The city is now a well-lit surburbia
and the grass
its hairy tentacles.

The other way to see grass,
is as a subject for research
focused on width
and length.

As a feminist I don’t insist on speaking about Nature,

that is the job of the men in space ships.
I don’t say that as a manhater,
but I did not invent nuclear fission,
that was done on the computer.

I was busy in the bathroom.   Defining terms.

***

It was dark under hazy stars.
I told them, grasping at the breast has nothing to do with genetics.
They gasped at the logic, rolling backwards onto the grass.

What was grabbing them?
They feared it might be me so, defined their terms.

***

You would not believe the squeals it could make I mean it could really
squeal.

Seriously, it was a ploy.
I was trying to avoid being arrested because her questioning is
exhausting.
I am not above being driven to drink or into realms of unrecoverable
fantasy,
& can made to believe almost anything at the S/M bar
where I dream of climbing the stage for the light of it.
I might be tempted to cry in front of my torturer or
piss into the mainstream.

All that explaining
for one whose imagination
is a polymer sponge,
a  mean machine of plasticene,
a freight train roiling Lemur variegatus.

We are back to black.

jeez, I saw Network-whatever in the header, and I
thought this was coming over our network/micro-

the concept of extra-terrestrials (was going to mention

I'm thinking it might be useful to read Pynchon's V.,
which, no, doesn't involve lizard-skinned ETs that
devour human and animal life - but I think it cld be
taken as indicative what they *can* represent to us,
that in order to make sense of the novel (with all
it's beautiful obsessing about the quotidian Outside),
American television had to turn it into a story about
such...  Of course, that read (i.e., novel as against tv
movie/series) is also a story about ratings, the horrid
state of art in public discourse, and a Reagan-era
"cold war"-ish rhetoric of containment carried over
&/or revived from the preceeding decades (War of the
Worlds, good-guy State Department versus big bad
Soviets, Star Wars, etc.).

        Anyway, I think it cld be useful...

you cld look at this against Enemy Mine - what
year was that? or, at the (very far) other extreme,
Alien and Alien 2 (I didn't get past 2...) - interest
ing that the first one is quite shadowy and spooky,
whereas the 2nd is much more action-oriented,
and both of a kind of bodily fear, bodily malfunction -
it's all gotten so bodily/sexual (and sometimes
BDSM-sexy) in the 80s and 90s...

Re: the "Aliens" films, Kelly Hurley - a professor of mine here at CU - has
a very good piece on the polymorphous sexuality of the monsters in
_Posthuman Bodies_. And of course, Jung's _Flying Saucers: A Myth of Things
Seen in the Skies_. His analysis of the UFO visions of an Italian chap
named, improbably enough, Angelo Orfeo, are interesting and make for a fun
read, too.

Oh you can go back to the Greeks or the Romans' Lucan, there are such
things everywhere you look I think - I'm glad someone brought up
Mandeville - I used the Travels at an Ohio conf. on narrratology -
relating it to cyberspace...

Thanks!  Actually, I have been thinking of it as abara-cadaly.  So calalily,
kodaly, and caddy are welcome changes.

I have a friend with a corporate-rule id named mallard (seven letters:  first
letters of first two names, five letters from your last name OR five letters
from your last name followed by ...  although one must add letters if people
with similar names are at the same company).

Maybe this will have a lasting effect on naming children.  Naming so they have
good userids.  Maybe it's just another opportunity for renaming onesself (or
being renamed).

Well, there is a superstition that a child is better off with initials that
spell something (why my parents thought, "cad -- yes! it's a word"?), there is
a lot of numerology related to names, and then one must always consider a
monogram for all your shetland sweaters and custom made shirts and whatever
else gets monogrammed -- towels?

There is a regular newspaper article that runs the popular names for that
year.  It seems the female names are more subject to changing taste than male
names (even though we live longer -- Hmm).

My sister and I change our names all the time.  My grandmother changed her
name to "Estelle" in the 20s and has stuck by it for 70 years.  When I got to
college, there was a group of people who tried to rename everybody.  Oddly,
these were not folk who ended up with much power.  College on the east coast
-- different world -- friends named Cheese, Bells, Wheels, Spoon.

In _Order of Things_, Foucault writes about "monsters," i.e. evolutionary
variants vis-a-vis the fossil record, as signifiers of difference. Alien
semiology, as you put it, is, I guess, a discourse concerned with
identifying the distinctions that make (and keep) the Same the Same - much
like the discourse of xenophobia. (I love Mandeville's Travels. One of those
books, like Pliny's Natural History, that one can read over and over for its
liveliness and delightfulness of invention).

        that's definitely one way of looking at it, e.g.,
        my earlier remarks on containment vis-a-vis
        the cold war... on the other hand, especially
        with respect to Alien and the Streiber thing,
        there's definitely another sort of invasion/
        containment thing happening, specifically
        with regard to the body and bodily function...

        so it could be understood in relation to the
        enduring attack on Roe v. Wade, or AIDS,
        or even the advent of the body as a site of
        power/contestation in poststruct. theory...

        (all of which wld be partial responses)

        now stop talking about this as you're only
        adding to my lengthy reading list!!

i remember a discussion on the list a coupla years ago (geez, i really am a

jack spicer, etc.  for those of you who will now hunt thru old epc files, i
think the header was "boys in space."

Karen et al -

An interesting book on this subject - which has maybe been posted already -
I haven't read the whole thread yet - is Alien Zone edited by Annette Kuhn -
about sci fi movies - As an inveterate fan I found it amusing -

Here also (what the hell) is part of a piece I wrote a while ago and have
published in I think an old Avec -

The Thing


is sexual but apart. It is uncreated because there is no space. Or it fills
the space with a sense of danger that is not like life. Though it is alive.
It will fight to save itself and can be remade. There can always be a new
version of the thing with contemporary actors and their attendant dangers.

Just as a statue glorifies marble or wax or butter, rubber is stretched over
the thin. Ours is the language of lovers. It is shaped into resemblance. We
get it from everything. We get more than that. Reading, repeating always
inaccurately what the other has thought with what intent is made clear only
always later. But the substance isn't clear. There is no transparency
possible at the beginning of life. We are the blind ones.

One thing is not like the other. Our relief is no less inexpressable for
being premature. At times it is more written than spoken. Like the lines in
a play before they are committed to memory. Actors can remember anything.
Their cooperation reminds you that time is going by. The thing undermines
the image in order to be an object.

Gently he bends me to abstraction. I urge him back. The thing hides is each
of us. This is what it's like. We realize in the midst of the occupation
that victory is a fact. An old story is seen differently. The parts as plain
as day. As if there were something beyond suspicion.

There is a test. It has to do with what was said. A trick is played. The
needle is off the scale. The actors are in bed. They need a pretext. Theirs
is an organized game. We are tied together but only briefly. Understanding
spreads over his face like blood under the skin. We let it out. "We abondon
ourselves to what we see."

The thing is insatiable. It takes the shape of a wolf. You hold up your end
of the conversation. An exchange of fire occurs. There is an echo of another
animal. Thought becomes visible like a trail. A comprehensive examination
proves to be just another in the chain of events. We are in the heart of the
thing. We touch this is our talking. We feel

a melting at room temperature. Something gives.

Compromised by the obvious will to continue. An airless room on top of the
world. Or the shape of a bird. Nothing can bring back that pattern. We have
this to say about each other. You are fixed here. Thoughts can be read or
only a dog simple sense of fear is left.

A song puts it in me.

They are alive but don't know what is going on. Someone saves it for them.
They call it the world. A character lies down in the snow before blowing up.
The thing watches from the shadows where we are. But we don't know. Eyes
that stay open. No one has them.

Things are not black  and white. We are not here anymore. Or it was and you
did. And we are.

One of the interesting books on the subject of alien intelligences is
Colin Wilson's _The Mind Parasites_.

Well worth reading if anyone is seriously interested in "aliens" and the
correlative possibilities as to so called psi-warfare.

Wilson rightfully refers to Husserl's phenomenological method as of
importance when dealing with those kinds of subjects.

I guess, if the aliens are there, we had better learn to defend against
them and make sure they do not invade any further...into our world. After all
how do we know who the aliens are in league with ?  Could be anyone, or only
in it for themselves, couldn't it ?  We do not trust foreign governments. We
do not even trust our own governments. Why would we trust "aliens" ?
Something is very very wrong with this scenario......

I do not take Streiber seriously. Streiber has an overactive imagination.
His ideas about remote viewing are absolutely silly, but the silliness
does not stop there,...Most of what people believe about aliens is silly.
Most of what is written about them is silly and completely conjectural.

>The movie version, which stars Christopher Walken,is very scary--but also
>surprisingly philosophical in its approach and in its implications... I
>highly recommend it.....

I think it all boils down to this:

Rule 1:  NEVER OBEY ALIENS, NO MATTER HOW NICE THEY SEEM TO BE, OR HOW NASTY.

Rule 2:  If you do not know who they are, with certainty, then assume that
         they are hostile, no matter what they say to attempt to sell you
         on some wild idea. You have to know, for sure, whom you are dealing
         with, or you are likely to get taken in, and in a big way.

Rule 3:  Know your own mind from whatever is the of the minds of others.
         That rule is difficult to follow, and very important.

Rule 4:  Imagine a foreign country that wants to undermine the ability of
         our countries to defend themselves, and wants to convert the
         citizens of our countries to ways of thinking that will overthrow
         the political system we live within so that that other political
         power can take this part of the world over for their own purposes.
         Would they decide NOT to use angels, aliens, and anything else
         they could recruit, conjure up, and use for that purpose ?

         Shades of Stalin and Hitler !  We might be being had, not by aliens
         in the truest sense of it, but by a foreign power that has developed
         a technology in excess of our own. Could be any competing foreign
         power couldn't it ?  And we are going to sell this out to them ?
         No way....

     After all they are aliens and we are the resistance. If they exist
     then we are the resistance against an uninvited invasion force, that
     does not seem to believe in proper diplomatic channels....Definitely
     not nice...Not nice at all.

     Now, where are those plans for that new device that shoots aliens
     dead.....They must be somewhere around here.....

     Repeat after me....

     We are human beings who absolutely refuse to be taken over,
     bossed around, brain washed, programmed, manipulated, used or
     abused by aliens. We will fight to defend our kind against their
     kind, using every means we have, with the aim of protecting
     our freedoms, our species, and its unimpeded evolution.

     Now, why is no one saying that about aliens ?

     Do they want to be taken over by hostiles ?

     Gee.....something is wrong.


     (Are we paranoid enough...yet....<chuckle> That's it, I have had
      my fun with this thread.....)


     M.   (Decisively NOT an alien.)


PS. Accounts of extraterrestrial encounters and anomalous experiences are
    of great interest to me, and if anyone has had any and wants to
    enter a serious analytical discussion on that subject, welcome to
    write and describe your experience. It is far from being something
    to be laughed away, but "everything is what it isn't" when it comes
    to such things and a critical skepticism is necessary for understanding
    even if not always for survival. Though it can be important for the
    latter purpose also.

This I like much better than the other threads in that fabric.

This thread leads to the idea of the poetic body as the body of flesh
transformed by whatever means, to increase human diversity to new breadths
rather than using science to constrain human diversity.

Humans could become their own demons, angels, aliens of all kinds, and
even monsters of nearly any description, within a wholly transhuman context.
All kinds of symbiosis, modification, and implantations, would become
increasingly possible and available.

In that there would be new possibilities, that some would choose to explore,
as to creativity. New symbols, new meanings, a new non verbal language of
metaphors that say something that could not be said before and define new
kinds of human relationships that perhaps, in some ways, did not exist before.

I think that can be something very positive. Even in its more unusual forms,
as long as it is something that individuals freely choose to express, as
part of their own self expressions, their own particular body poetic, that
they share communicatively with others.

Aliens?

There's the novels of Octavia Butler, especially the first of that amazing
series of which perhaps someone can remember the name. Very much into the
psychology of alien-ation.
So too perhaps the work of Phillip Mann _Eye_of_the_Queen_ ((Australian, I
see to recall).

Science fiction is of course full of a lot of junk, but there's a bunch of
stuff in there: LeGuin _Left_Hand_of_Darkness_ comes to mind.

Of course everywhere I look now there are references to aliens,
including this from sculptor John McCracken in my latest Art in America:

"Aliens are elusive and hard to pin down because of their
other-dimensionality. I think there are actually thousands of
extraterrestrials--and other entities that you wouldn't call
extra-terrestrials--flying and running around, looking at us, studying
us. While they may think we're kind of cool in some ways, even
brilliant, I think they wonder how we can be so opaque, why we don't see
them more than we do. It's amazing that we don't really see what's going
on."

An interesting reminder that maybe our perception of
multi-dimensionality is weak. I'm going to go back & take a new look at
some of my brother's Seth books.

Thanks to everyone who sent recommendations.

New Zealander, actually (teaches drama at Victoria University), but
Yorkshire born. I haven't read much SF since puberty, but Mann's books go
far beyond the strictures of the genre.

I'd recommend "Wulfsyarn" - not so much for the aliens, though they are
interesting, as for the approach to human and machine psychology (the book
is narrated by an 'autoscribe') and the fascinating take on the (possible)
future of religion ('The Church of St Francis Dionysus').

I also had a look at tuggar's works (per our electronic miracle here), and
wondered, were one inclinined to stretch the limits of poetry, would
her works be considered poems?    Or is this too conceptual,

One woman's vivid dream of aliens could be another person's abduction
experience. I have heard descriptions of alien encounters all along the
axis from one to the other. One night when living in a remote place there
came a knock at the door. My wife always said she wasnt afraid because he
was an angel, she knew it right away. He was a well-mannered if somewhat
familiar (with us, in his speech) angel, if so. All he asked for was a
drink of water. A,l,e,n (g=i).

Manifestations are often in remote sites. Perhaps it takes silence and
loneness to render aliens visible & audible.

When it comes to UFOs, however, I now hear the one we saw might have been
only a hologram : "We have long had that capability," a government
spokesperson said.

"Mah fellow-americans, people of the world, aliens have their weapons of
mass destruction trained on our largest cities. We must comply with their
requests. Starting today, the minimum wage will be lowered to 30 cents a
day. All civil liberties will be suspended. Homeless people will be shot."

On a lighter note, our own George Bowering is the author of a novel called
_Parents From Outer Space_ . Imagine! You're a teenager, you get home after
school and you have two sets of parents! Come to think of it, there's
something a bit eerie about George Bowering . . . .

Jack Spandrift has never been abducted by aliens.  But, as he was narratolating
to me the other evening at Hokey's 2-Bit here in Pedalfast, Michigan, he
did have what he called a 'counter.  It was on the range.  He had just settled
into a deep cup of insta-joe, leanin against along beside his cow-chip
campfire, when he thought he heard a faint buzzing sound.  "Gotcha!" he
muttered, slapping the left side of the back of his stringy neck.  But
the buzzing continued, ineluctably, indelibly, indubitably, in his ear,
so he peered out into the rangy darkness.  There it was.  A rusted can of
Folger's - BUT IT WAS GLOWING.  Sighing, he picked up his trusty 22 (a
sawed-off 44) & limped unevenly toward the caffeine apparition.  IT meanwhile
was rolling toward HIM.  They both came to an abrupt halt about 3 feet
apart, the can glowing a bright fuchsia, shaking and buzzing.  Jack
figgered a prairie dog musta gotten stuck in there, and become extremely
decussed from his proper ectoplasm, emitting alienated squeaks of volatile
perturbation which set his tin prison in motion in so remarkable a fashion,
etc. Imagine our hero's consternation when the decayed lid popped open
smoothly - and WHAT did he SEE - but a little... a little... SPACE CRITTER!!

Yes, it was an intelligent being of vaguely humanoid proportions - shrunk,
as you can imagine, to coffee-can dimensions!!  The little fella seemed
without warlike intent as he marched formally toward Jack & presented him
with a salute with one of his 3 arms.  Jack - bones shaking, as you might
guess, like an old tin can - squatted down slowly at critter level.

A little beam of ruby light came on over the mini's head - and suddenly
a nasal voice emitted these words:  "Jack, have you been keeping up with
the poetics list?"

Jack scratched his head under his cowboy hat.  "Well, no, lil feller - I
been herdin earth cows since March."

"Well, get with it, baby.  WE'VE GOT A MESSAGE FOR EARTH.  And you'll find
it on the list."

"Say... why don't you relay it to somebody else, okay?  I got work t'do
out here an them eastern media people give me the snuckers."

"Jack - tell me - what on earth do you mean by the phrase 'get the snuckers'?"

"Somethin between the jutters an the shickers, I guess."

"Dubious, Jack, dubious - & I think everybody here on Folger 12-B will agree.
But let that pass for now.  Just get back to your email, if you know what's
good for you."

"Listen here, lil spacefella, I don't take orders from nobody but the
trail boss, an you can - "

But before Jack could finish his expostulation, the Folger's can swept up
his interlocutor and began spinning at a tremendous velocity, throwing off
sparks at a G-rate of 2,000,000 to the f/x plus cream.  Jack backed off
as the cylinder dissolved in a precipitation of coffee fumes.

As he recounted his 'counter over a shot of Old Great-Great-Great-Granddad,
Jack's voice quavered ever so slightly, and he shook his head.  But when
I asked him whether he had taken the creature's advice and checked the
poetics list lately, all he said was -

"Hyinree, why, I gave up on tryin to get them cowgal quatrains to rhyme
a long time ago.  Now I just sing the old Pecos melodies - an I'm happy as
a donut in a red shift."

You sure of that ?  The pods....shades of Wyndenham....the pods again....

I thought that the next step was to make professors obsolete.

They first create symbiots, comprised of human to machine interfaces such
that the artificial intelligence program learns to think like tenured
professor. In essence to create "expert systems" within all the areas of study.

So far, no success, with that approach.

You perhaps know about Plato, an early artificial machine, drove its creator,
programmer, insane, such that he committed suicide ?  True story.

Well, in this instance the computers all went insane and had to be
disassembled and scrapped. The professors still have their tenure.

Maybe someday things will change....

By the way, are they using remote viewing to invigilate examinations yet
in American colleges ?  I heard a rumour somewhere....

Hi, Tom and Wendy:

I'm writing about Fatimah's work right now to introduce her series, "Village
Spells," on the Plexus site (http://www.plexus.org/tuggar/) . . . relating her
work to poetry. I don't think it's too much of a conceptual leap. Anyway, I'm
not done with the essay, but this will give you an idea of its direction:

If magic is that which changes properties by persuasive gesture, Fatimah
Tuggar's Village Spells are acts of genuine magic. The village
itself--admixture of western and African properties--is virtual, a product of
seeing the world in a particular way--say, Marshall McLuhan's Global Village.
Essential to the magus, the late U.S. poet Gerald Burns once said, is the
creation of a field in which magic can be said to work. I like his description,
even if it's necessarily vague. He was relating the task of magician to that of
poet, saying something about the poet's relationship to language. Some visual
artists, especially those who consistently generate visual collage work--I
think here of the German Hannah Hoch and Americans Joseph Cornell and Jess
Collins--work with images, things given, in the way poets do with words. The
collage artist, I want to say, might have as much or more in common with the
poet as with, say, the painter. Tuggar is no exception. The image-to-word puns
in her work are lively and frequent enough to engage the viewer who likes to
read as well as to look. While looking is hardly a passive act, reading
requires conscious viewer participation, and Tuggar's collage work, I've found,
rewards the curious reader.

* * *

I'm supposed to finish this essay by today (good luck, especially since I wanna
do some close readings of her stuff) and in the next couple of days it'll be up
at the site accompanying Fatimah's pieces . . . I'll let you know when it's
there.

Anyway, yeah, her work's great. And, again, anyone in NYC can see it "live" at
the New Museum (B'way just south of Houston) and the Jack Tilton Gallery (er
rrr, Greene street, I think, near Broome). She's still homeless, btw, staying
with a friend of a friend in Queens . . . if anyone in NYC knows of a place she
can live, backchannel me ASAP, por favor . . .

Thanks,

Gary

when joe told me the news it was very sad, frustrating, infuriating.  my
initial reply to joe was not as strong, i think i didn't know what to
think.  i was a student of his at iit for a couple years, i rode along with
him for a while as they started steering that school into the ground.  we
had more phrases that went along with I I T, but none of them used words as
cool as torpidity.

joe's book *is* fantastic. i've owned it for months now, picking through a
random page hear and there as i get a break from all other reading to be
done this semester. i think there were more ideas in his introductory pages
than in whole novels i've read lately!

just a note of thanx to all of those who've expressed support and concern,
on this list and backchannel, re my tenure situation...

for the record:  it was a politics-as-usual decision, and not based on my
being a poet, exactly (not that being a poet *helped* any)... had i been a
19th century american lit scholar, i would still be s-o-l... that my
colleague who was denied is our african-american studies scholar should
speak to this directly (and neither of us has any publication problems)...
the politics to which i refer have to do with the privatization of colleges
and universities, re which, as many of you are aware, i'm an outspoken
opponent... i think this latter development should be of concern to all of
you, simply b/c i think education is such an important aspect of our public
domain...

in any case, whatever happens, i'll be ok (and hey, things could always be
worse)... thanx again for your support and encouragement, means much to
me...

xxxx,

joe

There's the novels of Octavia Butler, especially the first of that amazing
series of which perhaps someone can remember the name. Very much into the
psychology of alien-ation.
So too perhaps the work of Phillip Mann _Eye_of_the_Queen_ ((Australian, I
see to recall).

Science fiction is of course full of a lot of junk, but there's a bunch of
stuff in there: LeGuin _Left_Hand_of_Darkness_ comes to mind.>>

Butler's trilogy is _Xenogenesis_ & is indeed terrific. Best alien
encounter trilogy in a long time, however, & a wonderful study in gender
politics to boot, is Gwyneth Jones's "Aleutian Trilogy" (_White Queen_,
_North Wind_, & _Phoenix Cafe_): wonderful post-colonial etc readings of
culture, with great characterization & a terrific style.

Does that exist more because a significant portion of people BELIEVE
that it exists, or because there are censors actually censoring ?

Does it exist more because some significant portion of the people who
believe it exists are intimidated, because they believe something nasty
will happen to them if they cease to believe in it ?  Kind of similar
to the concept of burning in hellfire if you do not believe in an idea
that someone else says you must believe in. Not only believe, but actually
become unquestioningly congruent with ?  That would be true belief rather
than going through the motions kinds of  belief.

So, what will happen, if some believe that there are no censors and that
freedoms of expression, and association, are truly in existence and
vouchsafed ?  Will those then exist, in a manner that they did not exist
while the belief was contrary ?

Would be an interesting experiment, wouldn't it ?

several years ago i saw a documentary on the war in bosnia ("saravejo:
ground zero"), which included a brief interview w susan sontag. she was
working with local actors to put on a stage production of "waiting for
godot," using the bombed-out streets of sarajevo as "stage". does anyone
know if this production was recorded on film? "sarajevo: ground zero"
was never released commercially in the u.s.
any information, please backchannel.

Thomas De Quincy in "Confessions of an English Opium Eater", published
in 1886, includes an account of what seems to be an abduction experience.

Simply read the "Analects from Richter: Dream Upon The Universe" p260
and following, and you will quickly see what I am referring to. The account
describes a "dream" in which an alien being who travels the universe
commanding motion by means of thought, takes the author to the far reaches
of the universe
and beyond it, traveling in space and time. It is as if the traveller goes
into warp drive or hyper drive, with all the predicted visual effects.

It really is a quite typical account, even if expressed in the language of
the previous century.

Then again, so is Ezekiel, and the Apocrypha even more so.

>Manifestations are often in remote sites. Perhaps it takes silence and
>loneness to render aliens visible & audible.

Sure, the kinds of places where trespassers are shot first, no questions asked.

I remember a story told by a UFO type, about such places. There was one such
place where a diner stood by a roadside, run by a man and his wife. The
sideroad nearby had a gate and fence, further down it. A typical guard post
at the gate.
A visitor asked the fellow who ran the diner: "can you tell me what they do
over there, down that road, beyond that gate ?" The fellow in the diner
answered:
"sure, I can tell ya, but if I tell you, I would then have to shoot you".

>When it comes to UFOs, however, I now hear the one we saw might have been
>only a hologram : "We have long had that capability," a government
>spokesperson said.

I like the idea about the electromagnetic field generators, similar to the
Philadelphia experiment story, that bent minds, light, radar, and every
other kind of electromagnetic waveform a lot more than I like the idea of
holograms.
It is kind of like the difference between magick and magic. Those
experiments go back to the 1940s. Even in Canada they flew large magnetos"
(motor-generators) in transport planes to test the wave bending effects of
the fields. Unlike the Philadelphia experiment, it was written up in the
newspapers of that era.

If the Klingon Empire can have "cloaking devices" so can we.

Then again we thought we would never have supersonic flight, as the g forces
would crush the pilot or render unconscious. The boffins proved to Truman that
it could be done, using a V2 rocket modified with a titanium alloy compartment
to carry a simian cargo. The simian monitored for consciousness by having to
push on a button when a light came on at periodic intervals. A simple enough
monkey trick, but it proved the point and a supersonic jet program, that led
to the U2 followed quickly thereafter. Those aliens ought to have a heroic
burial
in Arlington, despite being simian rather than human. (The Roswell autopsy
film is a blatent fake.) Without their sacrifice there would never have been
appropriation for supersonic jets, and the U2 would never have been built in
America. That would have likely meant the Cold War would have gone the other
way around and we would be flying red flags over Washington and Ottawa.

As a futurist I am still predicting faster than light space travel, to
distant solar systems, within this coming century. That, and one way time
travel, into the past, but no return tickets once the traveller gets there,
and very infinitismally little power to cause any significant changes
beneath the burden of quantum histories. That would mean that observation of
our barbaric ancestors will be possible. History, as we know it, will be a
dead discipline, and the works of famous historians increasingly regarded as
no more than curiosities of poetic fiction. (Those two ideas are connected.
Same energy fields used for propulsion.)

A pot shard does not tell us as much as some seem to think that it does.

Besides that, most science fiction tends to be silly, very fanciful, stuff.
William Gibson's writings, and a little of Michael Moorechock's writing
(particularly The Cornelius Chronicles) seems more impressive. The latter is
about parallel universes, strange loops, and such. The former about the more
ominous side of cyber technology.

>"Mah fellow-americans, people of the world, aliens have their weapons of

Who is to say that some day they might not arrive at this planet, if they
have not already, and find it inadequately defended. This planet having
been too busy fighting faction against faction among its own, and neglecting
defence against rival technological species from beyond.

They might not want to share the universe with us. What then ?  In fact we
can almost bet that they will not want to share it.

I say we should point some guns into space. In case THEY come to take over,
conquer, enslave, harvest, or species compete, with US !

That should keep the high tech economy going for at least a few decades.

Why does that attitude remind me of Heinlein's view of the universe.
I think he likely understood it better than most of the other SF writers have
understood it. There is no reason whatever to believe in "friendly" or
"benevolent" aliens, and much less reason to believe that "advanced species"
in terms of technological ability and intelligence are inevitably more
benevolent and "civilized" than the primitive, warlike, sometimes brutal,
humans tend to be.

Jim Beam?  Is he still around?  First reading I ever went to ('78, I
think, was about 20) and it was Beam (or maybe James Dickey, actually)
in Jacksonville, Fla.  Beam was totally sloshed and ya couldn't
understand a word of his slur, but met someone gorgeous, with whom
__________ (that first night--it was college in the seventies...).  In a
sense, it was a great reading!  Thanks Marcella Durand for the fond
memories of that evening and the few months that followed it.   S. T.

Factual and terrific,....

Electronic data of that kind is infinitely mutatable and thus mtuable.

Consider how anyone would ever know what had changed, been revised,
been edited.

What does one check the electronic copy against to verify that it is
a bona-fide, accurate, reproduction of the original ?

Thus, the words of Thomas Jefferson, or John Fitzgerald Kennedy, that
we might have read, or our predecessors might have read, and which were
the same, might no longer be the same for our successors.

Worse yet, they would never know, never be certain, of that having happened.

Potentially, the potential of this new technology, if it were to become
_the_ mode of conveyance of the "written" word, makes King James and his
revisionist efforts look Mickey Mouse in comparison to what could happen
as regards revision of any author's works.

Taken to extremes even the electronic Bill Shakespeare of a century from now
might have no resemblance to the hard copy William Shakespeare of today.

Let's say that in theory strong and directed electromagnetic fields could
cause sensory aberations, as well as disorders of perception and cognition,
including disorders as to internal time consciousness. The latter is not
"time" as such, (the successive flow of events, including cause and effect
chains of events), but only the perception of time internal to the mind.
(That ITC distortion could occur in any species, not only in humans.) Strong
EMR of some kinds can also have considerable effects on the nervous system
such that the sense of body and its spatial orientation would be
peripherally effected along with perhaps some physical functions
(coordination, etc.)

The movie was very silly, as was the story it was based upon.
Electromagnetic fields of the kind that would have been used to cloak ships
at sea could NEVER result in "time travel", in any circumstances.
Distortion of internal time consciousness, of time perception, could never
even result in an _apparent_
but not real, displacement of objects within the temporal stream of from
past to future. Simply not possible. This apparent distortion would be
simply distortions of quantum events in the brain. Displacements of
electrons and alterations of electron spin, would be enough, if enough were
affected, to cause hallucinations, and extremely disordered thinking,
including loss of sense of place and time. That is only a loss of the mental
sense of where and when, but not actual physical, spatial-temporal,
displacement.

(If time travel is possible, and I believe that it is possible, it is an
entirely different phenomenon, and requiring generation of a different kind
of field. Likely tachyons, rather than tardyons, meaning faster than light
quanta.
That is not, I tend to believe, a question concerning an Einsteinian 4
dimensional universe anymore, but leads to new paradigms. Had a somewhat
long discussion on that in Internet's sci.physics conference some years ago,
as to the possibility of at least a 5 dimensional universe, with a tachyonic
mirror image to the tardyonic one we live in, and all those luxons popping
in and out at the boundary. The Philadelphia experiment would most probably
have bent the paths of luxons (light and electrons, mostly). The
electromagnetic fields, if as strong as the stories indicate, having effects
on radio, radar, and sonar, making the ships apparently "invisible".)

Good question.

The interesting thing is that if the universe is non Einsteinian, and a new
paradigm evolves, making Einstein's universe as obsolete a model as is
Newton's (though nevertheless continuing to be useful in its own ways), then
inter dimensional aliens could be a reality. They could be mostly tachyonic
(faster than light) quanta, whereas we are mostly tardyonic (slower the
light) quanta.
That would account for inter-dimensionals being seen as shimmers of light.
That would be Chernkov radiation, which would be luxons emitted by tachyons
that are slowed down when involved in densities of tardyons and some luxons
where more collisions occur. The Kirlian aura of human forms might also be
our tachyonic "souls" and seen only when electrons interfere with tachyons
such that Cherenkov-like radiation (as light) is emitted.

Makes for interesting speculation.

What it has to do with poetics....I won't hazard a guess. Though I sometimes
allude to cosmology in some of my poems. So did Gregory Corso, and some
others. "Mind Field" I think is the title of one of Corso's pieces. I do not
have a complete copy, but have read some of it on the net.

QUESTION:  Does anyone know of poetry about the new physics, about quanta,
           anomalies and new cosmological ideas ?

Would be interested in author, title, publication, info, if you know of any.

who needs poetry when you have Charles Hoy Fort, Book of the Damned.

& would highly recommend the Holographic Universe, whose author escapes
me this morning because my mind has escaped me...but its premise, one
which seems in vogue with a lot of new physics & psychotronics studies
is that the brain is a 3-D decoder for a holographic universe.  which
goes far measures to explain madness from the viewpoint of the mad, the
presence & onmiscience of the navaho language, & even some of the
experiments with ketamine users accessing the same shared tripping space
& being able to navigate thru a consensus other reality.

& of course the classic from the 20th century poetry of edge is Alfred
Jarry's How to construct a time machine.  whose title Im probably also
screwing up cuz I dont have it in front of me.

I am able, and at times have necessarily had to suspend all assumptions, all
beliefs, and all imagination. Otherwise those cloud and colour perception
with falsification as to what is sensed. (Phenomenological methods again.)

Also able to almost totally resist hypnotic suggestion.

Trust me, it is possible.

Regardless of what some say about it being impossible.

Chuckle....that recent.....Let's go back a ways, to the turn of the previous
century and Nikolas Tesla......

Found at http://pages.nyu.edu/~jqs1209/tower.htm

What seems most interesting is that the Wardenclyffe facility was
completed BEFORE 1906. So this quote is prior to 1906.

"As soon as [the Wardenclyffe plant is] completed, it will be possible
for a business man in New York to dictate instructions, and have them
instantly appear in type at his office in London or elsewhere. He will
be able to call up, from his desk, and talk to any telephone subscriber
on the globe, without any change whatever in the existing equipment. An
inexpensive instrument, not bigger than a watch, will enable its bearer
to hear anywhere, on sea or land, music or song, the speech of a
political leader, the address of an eminent man of science, or the
sermon of an eloquent clergyman, delivered in some other place, however
distant. In the same manner any picture, character, drawing, or print
can be transferred from one to another place..."

Aproximately 100 people have posted to the list this month (9 days old):

Morpheal leads the pack with 18 messages, Keston Sutherland a close second
with 17, Rachel Levitsky a distant 3rd with 11.  Perpetual favorites Gould
and Damon don't seem to be in the running this month, though they may make
a surge later in the month.

Favorite topics is aliens, with over thirty postings--a distant 2nd is

Last night Jay Wright appeared at the California Institute of Arts (having
read the previous day at Occidental College).  He read portions of plays
written over the past two decades (including portions of the play for
Nicolas Guillen that appeared in the special Guillen issue of Callaloo
[10.2 -- 1987 if you want to look it up]) -- One surprise was when he broke
into song, in Spanish.  I'd known that he was fluent in Spanish (he also
read passages in Yoruba with no discernable American accent), but I hadn't
known that he could sing.  (also plays upright bass, though not at
readings) --

Some of the work was from a recently completed ms. titled
_Transformations_, which, if all goes well, will appear in a volume of
collected poems soon.

Watch the Cambridge Univ. Press listings next year for a book by Carole
Doreski that includes a substantial, and GOOD, chapter on Jay Wright's poetry.

        Hans Richter (old Dada fella) very good on this in Dada Art and

        many collections in many languages
        works of Heartfield for ex--political photomontage

this is a personal squawk, my partner, aka dbc had difficulty subscribing
to poetics so ended up subscribing under my address.  after few years I
figure y'all could let him in on his address.  I tried to unsub, have
written requesting directions on onsubbing w/no response.  am tired of
wading thru all this stuff to get my mail (do I really care what the
servers are called at SUNY buffalo? I DON'T THINK SO -

now apparently is as hard to get off this list as get on  so understand
the crisppee's or whatever its name was' desperation

it's rather a droll retort and basically unnecessary, but did you know
yourself to be doing this because you assumed so, believed so or imagined
so?  whatever

yeah so what - I resent, very slightly, being hoisted in this sample of
wryness: the messages I've posted to the list were on serious issues or
they were poems by myself or by others.  I have made a particular effort
to post pieces by Andrea Brady in the past week, that accounts for a good
slice of my input.  Nothing to say about aliens, except to mention
Mandeville etc.  What have you said?

Wright read at UCSD this evening and reads at the Porter Troupe Gallery in
San Diego tomorrow evening. A consummate craftsman and a poet of deep
intelligence in three languages and several dialects. I'm embarassed to
admit that I didn't know his work till this evening. He read a stunning
longish poem the central imagery of which was derived from the Virgin of
Guadeloupe. Copper Canyon is putting out a generous selected poems next year.

Content-type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII
Content-transfer-encoding: 7bit

I'm relatively new to the list and thought I'd try again to stir up some
discussion.   I have been reading Tom Raworth's book Eternal Sections and just
keep coming back to it.  So far, however, I haven't really been able to
articulate much what I like about it.   It doesn't seem flashy in its form,
and only occasionally does a single line or phrase jump out at me as terrific,
but the cumulative experience of reading several pages in a sitting is quite
satisfying.  No, more than that...exciting.  It encourages me to write, but I
don't know why.   In a Perloff article called Sentence, Not Sentence she
mentions the variety of Rawoth's lines.  Meaning, that in his blocks of verse,
no two lines of the same sentence structure are next to each other.   This is
interesting to me, and I'm sure the variety in the syntatical structure as
well as the variety of the way it looks on the page is part of the appeal.
But...  that still doesn't seem to be enough to explain why it seems like such
great stuff to me.  Maybe that's why they call it poetry.   Any thoughts from
other Raworth fans?

For those of you still on line on the East Coast, try to look the window
around 4am this morning (still Thursday for me) and look at the stars, if
it's clear, of course. That view and time is vaguely in accordance with the
narrative action of Dante's Inferno, where at the end of the first part of
the Divine Comedy (presumably, the pre-dawn Friday after Maundy Thursday --
I'd say about 4am), "I" emerges out of "the despondent kingdom" "to see
--once more-- the stars."

E quindi uscimmo a riveder le stelle.

You also may want to read the rest of Dante's great poem, concluding with
Paradisio on Easter Sunday.

Now, 9:30pm here in California, would be about the time to begin reading the
Inferno out loud. You'd finish around 4am (including coffee breaks) and walk
outside to see the stars. Unfortunately, it's partly cloudy here in SF
tonight and who knows when the fog will roll in.

Dear Schiller

What will you make of my blotted scrawls, my backtrackings, my marble
powderings, my breathless cries?  What will you think, what will you
say?  What airs will hover abating silence in the valleys of your
homelands, your lips pressed tight --

I fell in the sublime you wrote me of, because I cannot call your
existence into question, I cannot wipe away the grounds.  You, springing
out of that which you have written me so many times in the past.  For it
is the unreasonableness of that ground which accords - as in the only
condition which unreasonableness is in accord, namely, with itself - for
it is your scaffolding which you have inherited, your "nobilities," your
"grandeurs," as if somehow coursing, as you wrote, in your skies, your
rivers.  The ramparts of your homelands.

What goes unseen in you?  What would you say of this purest of loving,
spilt in the gorge?

How would I love you, Schiller - dare I say, with these sublime tremblings?

I give myself to your chasms, your untended plains, your deserts
crisscrossed, your senseless woods, your terrors, your sleeplessness:  the
peaks of your glacial S, your R eternally flaming.  (Forgiveness:  what is
more natural, then, of nature's nature, than _the persistence of the
letter_?  That _is_ what you seek, no?)

This is how you find me.  How do you find me?  It is not to ask of drive,
fulfillments, celestial mechanics, traces of which we are party to in
your cosmology.

To elevate is to stand next to the hole.  This I have learned.  I ask for
your altitudes, I pay homage to scraped lands I don't know, I pummel
French gardens for you, I raze cities.  I would win your heart - not
wishing, lamely, for a lover's arrival, but instead superimposing with
absolute moral force, without the investment *du couer*, the usury *du
sang*; disinterestedly, distractedly....  Naturally I would turn my back
on you if you came, what unfathomable travesty to see your face....

Schiller, my impossible, my ten thousand lapis washes.  What would you
make of my ceaseless mutterings, my Freud, my Marcuse?  What would you
_do_, with my burned letters, my false starts, my fevers, my inexplicable
clutter across these cities?  I can't very well give these manifestations,
my persons in wartime and in peacetime, the one and the other, so
incommensurable; I can't seep into the page, drawing across the ink
without, once, blushing....

This envelope is white.  That you can see.

Three years ago I was a temp for a consulting firm that had just
lost its main client, NASA.  To burn off budgeted funds, they stuck
me in a room with three other temps and no assignment except
to sit, wait, and listen to a daily lecture about how big work was
a-comin' our way.

Aside from two-hour lunches at the Smithsonian, I passed the
time cutting panels out of the daily comics and reorganizing
them so they made new comics.  I still have this habit, and
whenever I show them to people they say "gee you must have
time on your hands."

Not really.  But I'm attentive to a poetics of the comics page
(maybe I should've made a new subject header) that is verbal,
visual, narrative, repetitive, and occasionally perverse.

Try it.  Or just try reading the page for individual panels.  Mark
Trail and the soaps are particularly wondrous, though
Spiderman is probably the best with its days & days of absolutely
nothing happening.

Kind of like being a temp... and like the three jobs I've had since.

Here's from the electronic version of the Arizona Daily Star in Tucson. I
was not at the performance, but I have heard people who were at it say it
was great, and that it was awful (both in terms of the issue of sexually
explicit poetry in a performance involving young children; and in terms of
the quality of the work). I have to admit that I was somewhat surprised to
hear months ago that the Festival had invited Byrkit, but my surprise was
not based on the explicit nature of her work. I don't think the Festival
should have been at all surprised at the kind of poetry Becky was reading,
and although it's clear she didn't give much clue to her young performers
or their parents, I also think the Festival might have been just a little
more on top of the issue in advance, knowing Becky's work.

Poet `ambushes' kids in choir

 [photo of Byrkit] Becky Byrkit, an award-winning poet and adjunct
instructor at the University of Arizona's English Department, invited the
Vail choir to sing while she read her poetry.=20



Sexually explicit verses stun Vail singers, parents at reading
By Monica Mendoza=20
The Arizona Daily Star=20

Parents say Old Vail Middle School choir members were betrayed by a local
poet when they unwittingly became part of her erotic poetry reading.=20

Choir members agreed to sing on stage for Becky Byrkit while she performed
before a crowd of more than 200 at last weekend's 16th annual Tucson Poetry
Festival.=20

They had practiced the words of the song ``Roam'' by the rock group B-52s
and showed up on stage Friday evening in blue jeans, plain shirts and
barefoot - just as Byrkit requested. They were told the theme of the
festival was geography.=20

But Byrkit launched into smoldering erotic poetry that turned their little
faces red and sent parents into a fit of anger.=20

``She began reciting in explicit detail about oral sex, gay sex and sex in
the back seat of a car,'' said parent Larry Williams, whose daughter and
niece, both 12, were in the choir.=20

``She talked about God in a negative way,'' said Rita Lake, mother of
12-year-old Daniel. ``My son was crying as he walked off the stage.''=20

Daniel, whose family is very religious, was confused and hurt by Byrkit,
Lake said.=20

Minutes into Byrkit's reading, the 18 children were herded off stage by the
Vail choir instructor. After her one-hour performance, parents demanded to
know why Byrkit ``ambushed'' their kids.=20

According to parents, Byrkit never apologized for the explicit poetry -
only that she was sorry the children didn't get to sing their song.=20

Two parents filed complaints early this week with the Pima County
Attorney's Office saying Byrkit violated decency laws by exposing them to
obscene material. An investigator has been assigned to the case.=20

Parents also wrote angry letters to the Tucson Poetry Festival and its
sponsors voicing their disgust. Festival organizers, who said they were
just as shocked at Byrkit's choice of reading with the children present,
said this is an unfair black eye on their otherwise successful event.=20

``This is an issue between Becky, the parents and the teacher,'' said John
Hudak, president of the board that oversees the festival. ``We feel
victimized in our own right.''=20

Byrkit did not use vulgarity in her performance, said Scott Stanley,
publisher of the bimonthly magazine Tucson Poet. The language was sexually
laced without being explicit, he said.=20

``It was over the heads of 13-year-olds - I don't think they had a clue,''
Stanley said. ``It was clear to the parents what she was saying.''=20

Byrkit would not comment on the situation under the advisement of her
attorney.=20

``I'll give you a call as soon as counsel says it is advisable to speak to
you,'' she said in a telephone message. ``In the meantime, if you could,
just chill.''=20

Byrkit, an award-winning poet and adjunct instructor at the University of
Arizona's English Department, invited the Vail choir to sing while she read
her poetry at the festival, which was at the Tucson Center for Performing
Arts, 408 S. Sixth Ave.=20

The two had paired in the past for a Christmas poetry reading at The Voice
and Range, a poetry consulting service Byrkit runs out of her home.=20

That performance was tasteful, said Vail Superintendent Calvin Baker.=20

No one knew Byrkit planned to read poems about sex in this second meeting.
The children, ages 11-13, rehearsed with Byrkit the previous Thursday
afternoon, Baker said. But ``she didn't read her part,'' he said.=20

The teacher and the children didn't ask for details about her reading
because ``they had worked with her and trusted her,'' Baker said.=20

``The children's trust was violated,'' Baker said. ``They were embarrassed
by it and upset.''=20

Byrkit is known for her steamy poetry, said local poet Dave Mitchell. In
1995 she published her first book, ``Zealand'' - a collection of poems that
one critic said ``resuscitates . . . language in a phantasmagoria of erotic
encounters.'' She has been a featured poet in the Bisbee Poetry Festival
and is a 1993 winner of a statewide poetry contest.=20

``The erotic content is her vehicle to be deconstructionist with her
style,'' Mitchell said. ``If eating a cheeseburger was taboo in polite
circles, she would be writing about cheeseburgers.''=20

Byrkit was invited as one of the six featured poets in this year's festival
because ``she is an up-and-coming poet,'' said Hudak, president of the
board that oversees the festival. ``She has been controversial - we have
not been afraid of that.''=20

But Hudak said festival organizers were surprised to find out that Byrkit
had not informed the Vail teacher or students of her complete program.=20

``As far as we knew, she had worked with the teacher and the kids,'' he
said. ``There were parent permission slips and there were rehearsals.''=20

Poets are not asked in advance for their material, he said. And many create
new pieces for the festival.=20

Byrkit's piece was called: ``Suite: Cowpunk R=E9al.'' In a pamphlet for the
show she described the three-part reading as a compilation composed with
three other poets. One part was improvisational and the third part was
titled, ``Roam'' - that is where the children were to sing.=20

Neither the county attorney nor the festival committee has a copy of the
poem. However, the show was videotaped and that tape will be given to the
county attorney for its investigation.=20

Meanwhile, the festival committee will send letters of apology to all the
parents and children involved, Hudak said.=20

``We feel badly for the parents,'' he said. ``We feel and have expressed to
Becky that she didn't handle this well.''=20

In the future, the festival committee will take more precautions, Hudak
said. The committee will make sure that all parties performing in the show
are aware of each other's part in the show. No surprises, he said.=20

Williams questioned whether the children's reaction was meant to be part of
Byrkit's performance. He wants her to publicly apologize to the children.=20

``I think she needs to be punished,'' he said. ``No children should be
subjected to something like this.''=20

113 reasons subject to typos.

The notion of working in fourteen line chunks.

Periodically what unfolds mimics the shape of a sentence, periodically.

Or not.

Simply put of infinite complexity.

Disjunction is a cliche.

More solid than that, meaty fibers, modular but fertilizer too.

Oh but yes the details.

Of phrase:  "on an eight-minute nudge."

Of observation, as if ordinarily awed:  "brilliance of the orange lily"

As if descriptively banal:  "whistling near the river"

As if propositional:  "such division into subjects/consequences of a failure"

Of detached affect, in media res:  "fear that increases"

Of anger in stress and spondees: "most of the nation ignored/in droves
during/ two hours of prime time"

Of unabashed despair:  "we are now cut off"

Of performativity, blundering exact process constructed:  "meaning is fluid"

Of devastated textbooks:  "emphasising the purely decorative/ history
repeats itself"

Speed speed speed, conceptual speed.

As if one more phrase would resolve the matter and you were in the middle
of it.

Already started, humming along.

"two small cakes and one tart"

Of torque and juxtaposition:  "attitudes do not necessarily change/arson,
murders and assualts/in the three biggest economies/nurtured from the
start/in a climate/of smelters"

Of aliens separating the metallic constituents.  "Smelt."

Of narrative:  of narratoology.

"a kind of delight/ which pluralises the meaning/demanded by gesture/but
conserves it in the present"

"shadows made of wood"

"terrified whines pulsed"

"his brain refused to work"

Look ma, no hands.

That's not 113.

Thanks, Robert.  Interesting.  At 2 pm today (Good Friday) I finished bk 2
of STUBBORN GREW THE ROSE. Bk2 is sort of a purgey (turgid?) oratorio called
"Fox Point".  I was up late on Maundy Thursday (approx. 1:30 am) working
on it.  Here's some stanzas I wrote at that hour:

Catch us the little foxes, Solomon,
that spoil our vineyard.  Lucky,
true love's the cardinal pt (sd Bluejay).
A monde, almond.  All made.  I thirsty, mon.

Upon a Roman rood was fixt

through the pinedoor, drifted sound.

Having known Becky Byrkit and her work for many years, having also worked
for the Tucson Poetry Festival for a number of years, and having been at
Becky's performance that night, I feel obliged to comment on the growing
fiasco.

I've always admired Becky's work, but the performance that night was just
humiliatingly awful, not because of Becky's writing but because of all the
performance stuff she put around it.  Frankly, children don't really have a
place around Becky's work.  Her work is often explicit and erotic and
dwells in those dark regions your typical parent of a fourteen year old
just does not want to think about.  The song and dance performance was
amateurish in the worst way (if she wanted song and dance, there are plenty
of adult companies in Tucson she could have collaberated with).  At many
points during the reading, I caught her deliberately censoring herself
onstage, removing the more graphic elements from her work.  Those
compromises weakened her work.  She was clearly aware of the growing
disaster that surrounded her that evening, and it showed in the growing
awkwardness of her reading.

The kids seemed to be having a good time however.  I suspect the kid was
crying because his mom had just embarassed him in front of everyone by
yanking him offstage.  Lots of parents were pissed:  the front three rows
were emptied in such a fashion with angry parents and bewildered kids
storming out.

One of the reasons I suspect Becky got trapped in this fiasco is because of
an arts organization she heads, called "Voice and Range."  The organization
acts as a sort of networking group, connecting different artistic talents
together for eductional and collaborative purposes.  I suspect that much of
the performances that night were set up through her organization.  To be
blunt, however, Becky should never have included children in her
performance if she was going to read what she usually reads, especially if
it hadn't been vetted through the parents of the kids.

As for the Tucson Poetry Festival's role in this, my impression was that
they were basically ambushed (although this is not the first time this has
happened: a similar event occurred several years ago when the theme of the
festival was love poetry and the winner of a statewide poetry contest (who
traditionally reads first on a Saturday night) brought her grandchildren to
hear her read, only to be followed by some rather explicit homoerotic love
poetry by Boyer Rickel and Marilyn Hacker).  It's not the responsibility of
a literary arts  organization to oversee the work of readers.  The Festival
has a number of constituencies and has made a concerted effort to be as
open and inclusive as possible.  The Festival deliberately targets people
who have never been to a poetry reading.  Presenting the work of children
has been an important part of this: a specific reading was set aside on a
saturday afternoon of the festival in which children read their poetry.
This event was very well attended, I doubt if any of the participants were
at Becky's reading the night before.

The dilemma is not how to present poetry without offending anyone, the
problem is making sure audiences have some idea of what they are getting so
they don't feel ambushed.  There's a lot of great poetry out there that
some parents might feel is not appropriate for kids.  At the same time, it
would be absolutely dreadful if this was used as an excuse to keep kids
away from all poetry.  It would be equally dreadful if this was used as an
excuse to shut down the Tucson Poetry Festival.

I'd like to hear from other people involved with literary arts
organizations and reading series:  how do you handle this issue, of kids
and parents at readings, of presenting explicit work in a public forum?

Thanks.

For what little such things are worth, except as interesting science
fiction, I had a lucid dream not long ago about what I believe is to be a
launch
facility for space vehicles that might be loosely termed "gravitational
lensed" lensed" type propulsion systems. Gravity is inextricably linked with
the superluminal, and a superluminal field, if contained/focused
electromagetically to keep it from destroying the vehicle it is propelling
and the lauch structure, could, I believe, in theory, be used instead of
traditional rocket engines.

The dream was of a very huge concrete structure built into the earth. The
walls were massive pourings, with a huge diameter hollow cylindrical shaped
center.
The walls had orifices or short protruberances (field generator outputs ?)
located equidistant inside the cylinder. The upper surface indicated the
pouring was at least fifty or more feet thick. The depth was undiscernable,
but the
visible portion was more than a hundred feet before the other side blocked
vision into the hole in the middle. The surrounding terrain was blackened
rock, very rough, weathered rock, foothills type rock, maybe slate or shale
or something similarly coloured and nothing growing or living as far as I
could see to the southwest of the structure.

Nothing comparable in my experiences. Might be a chanced on remote view.

If I am right, the superluminal field would be generated under the vehicle
and the vehicle would be propelled upwards surrounded by a force field
resembling a magnetic crucible force field from the sides and perhaps the
bottom of the launch facility. If so, it would be out of there, once
accelerated up to full tachyonic field strength, in less than a quick blink
of an eye, and off into space.....The payload would be larger than the space
shuttle. Much larger.

>also, recent qm tunneling experiments claim to prove superluminal velocites.

There was in fact a scientific report of the time between point of entry and
point of exit being negative, rather than positive. I cannot remember the
name of the researchers, but it jives with Dr. Sarfatti's contentions regarding
the "back reaction" enabled by subliminals such that information is conveyed
from the future to the past, making precognition possible even if exceptional.

You can find Jack Sarfatti and his organization on the world wide web.
He is a mathematical physicist.

Bob Ez. is this what you mean by Cherenkov radiation (see definition below)?
Can you provide a better definition than the one below?  Can you provide an
explanation why Cherenkov radiation is important to your argument or I guess I
don't really understand tachyons and how they would emit light and what speeds
that light would travel at?

Best,

Bill Luoma

definition of Cherenkov radiation from some web site:
 "it is also possible to use these same heliostats at night to collect the
quick flashes of blue Cherenkov light that result from gamma ray air showers.
These gamma rays originate from astrophysical sources at galactic and
extragalactic distances. When they enter the earth's atmosphere, the gamma
rays interact with air molecules, creating an extensive shower of high-energy
particles. These particles go faster than the speed of light in air, and thus
emit light, or Cherenkov radiation. This radiation (at optical and ultraviolet
wavelengths) is beamed to the ground, where it is readily collected by the
heliostat mirrors."

(faster than light) quanta, whereas we are mostly tardyonic (slower the
light) quanta.
That would account for inter-dimensionals being seen as shimmers of light.
That would be Chernkov radiation, which would be luxons emitted by tachyons
that are slowed down when involved in densities of tardyons and some luxons
where more collisions occur. The Kirlian aura of human forms might also be
our tachyonic "souls" and seen only when electrons interfere with tachyons
such that Cherenkov-like radiation (as light) is emitted.>>

``I think she needs to be punished,'' he said. ``No children should be
subjected to something like this.''

Do listlings agree with this, that the erotic is 'bad' for children?

" a similar event occurred several years ago when the theme of the
festival was love poetry and the winner of a statewide poetry contest
(who
traditionally reads first on a Saturday night) brought her grandchildren
to
hear her read, only to be followed by some rather explicit homoerotic
love
poetry by Boyer Rickel and Marilyn Hacker)." --from Hugh's post

I wasn't there and don't know the work.  Certianly, it is bad faith to
include in your performance, a group who you think might be alienated
by/from the work.  However, there is nothing inherently damaging to
children about sexual or homoerotic material.  Children, need I
remind, are "subjected to" and "ambushed by" an abundance of what I
would call inappropriate imagery of starving women made to look sexy on
buses, and the obvious violence bla bla bla, we all know this.  And
Marilyn Hacker's poetry is offensive because of a piece of phallic
plastic????? In a session devoted to love poetry??  What'd they think?

A personal experience:

A young poet wanted to read at Left Hand and sent me work.  I was trying
to encourage just this thing and felt I needed to honor his effort,
despite my reservations about the person.   The week before his
scheduled reading, I heard him read, and was so offended that I walked
out (this, as far as I recall has only happened to me one other time, I
think it was Richard Hell--what da ya think a that?)  He, a 20yr old Jew
from phily, was "channeling" black slaves on plantations, and young
women being sexually abused, and another I didn't hear because I left.
His depictions were stereotypical, narrow, extremely flawed vis a vis
bad acting, and violent/screaming.  So much for the subject matter being
the problem. Obviously both of those subjects could be handled in many
sensible, sensitive and textured ways. Still, as awful as I found it, he
has his fans who love his work, see it as cutting edge.

I flipped.  Safety, respect between reader & audience are critical to
the Left Hand Reading Series.  I wanted to ban him, or read his work in
advance or tell him he couldn't read that shit in our space.  I felt
righteous and justified when I called a meeting between him and the
organizers.  We'd decided the most we could do was ask him not to
channel.  But as soon as we were done speaking with him, we knew, we had
to take it back.  So we told him he knew our feelings and could read
whatever he wanted.  Thus sprouted the creation of a mission statement,
which is explicit about the values of its organizers.  In general, I
agree that one can't 'censor' or oversee a writer, not without being
appropriating and paternalistic.  However, one can create a tone and
atmosphere that encourage sensitivity and discretion.  Our young poet
read different work in the end.

I don't know if that addresses your question Hugh.

Hi Charles,

Where can I see some of Becky Byrkit's work? Any on the web?

You know, I remember a woman asking me about a reading I was going to do
& she wondered if it'd be "appropriate" to bring her daughter. I thought
is was kind of an odd question, and now it occurs to me that it was
probably in Tucson or Phoenix. What are you guys up to down there?!?!

I am curious to see the work: I usually see parents tripping over things
their kids would handle calmly, if not for the ensuing drama. If her
work is violent, that's one thing; if it's just erotic...

a poem from June Jordan's _haruko/love poems_:

Why I became a pacifist
and then
How I became a warrior again:

Because nothing I could do or say
turned out okay
I figured I should just sit
still and chill
except to maybe mumble
‘Baby, Baby:
Stop!’
AND
Because turning that other cheek
        holding my tongue
        refusing to retaliate when the deal
        got ugly
And because not throwing whoever calls me _bitch_
        out the goddamn window
And because swallowing my pride
        saying I’m sorry when whoever don’t like
        one single thing
        about me and don’t never take a break from
        counting up the 65,899 ways I talk wrong
        I act wrong
And because sitting on my fist
        neglecting to enumerate every incoherent
        rigid/raggedy-ass/disrespectful/killer cold
        and self-infatuated crime against love
        committed by some loudmouth don’t know
        nothing about it takes 2 to fuck and
        it takes 2 to fuck things up
And because making apologies that nobody gives a shit
        about

And because failing to sing my song

finally
finally

        got on my absolute last nerve

I pick up my sword
I lift up my shield
And I stay ready for war

Because now I live ready for a whole lot more

than that

Here's one of Becky Bykitt's poems, which was read that night (read
underline signs for italics):

The Only Dance There Is


        Oh no!  He's going to _show_ it to me --
This gelatinous spore burst like a shot bird's foot --
Splayed, in the nest of his own little egg cup are.  God!
Is it he, or is it I, in my white spikes and levis,
Peeling sweaty red labels off Buds, who becomes
Slowly exposed, a pornographic snap developing
At a While-U-Wate Shak?  Is it my turquoise lighter holder,
Or my voice, full of coins and strangulations,
That compels the alcoholics, the men I literally live for,
To repeatedly ask what I want?  _Hey!  What do you want?_
I know girls who dance in bars and marry, like, firemen.
This man here is so unemployed I could talk to him
All night.  I'm saddled on a teetering labrador of lust, drunk
And ready to fill up a station wagon.  It is

        the _degringolade_ of the species of woman I am --
The curl of my big leg and the smell of that sweat,
Redolent and in that Terrible Vicinity.  Here _let me buy that,_
I am transmigrating in the _def leppard_ of my "desire"
And it has happened before, is happening, will happen again,
All of it.  It's the old lovemaking in the cemetary routine,
        Johnny.
The last beauty I fell for drank me AND fucked me
Under the table.  He said, "Hey there you little redheaded
        sweetiepie, you.
Perfection, my life is an open casket funeral; darling,
Our love is the visitation hour."  You heard what he did next.
Frankly I still admire him.
I have nevernever touched myself so well,
Nor could I observe a man jerk off in a sock with such joy.
At times I swear the sex of the earth is the sponge and bedwash for Jesus.
At times I swear I could live with a man I'll call "Tom"
        forever: when we met he bound me with Venetian blind cord
And went down on me for roughly nine hours.  He delivered
His own daughters' sons.  You know how it must be for me.
Drunk in bars, I feel the righteous _ness_ of humidity and cherry,
Initials carved in tequila-drenched grains with "surgical
        precision."
We are listing toward the primordial wind and I talk about men
To men.  (Once, my hair caught fire in a tavern.
            The man who set it horsewhipped my head, singeing
          His shavebrush Stetson.)
An absolute glance.  Tufts of botched permanent wave.  O,
You drunk and fucked-up munificence.  O, Unshaven, Midnight,
Kindly lubricate my introduction to the unspeakable ring of chaos
You understand to be your life.  You will surely pull the coil
        out of my car.
Oh no!  He's going to show it to me --
God save the two of us, supernova.

The poem is from her book "Zealand," and can be found in "Best American
Poetry 1994."

Frankly we've all heard worse, the problem was audience.  I think Becky
Byrkit clearly screwed up big.  The Tucson Poetry Festival got smeared in
the process.

Rachel writes "there is nothing inherently damaging to children about
sexual or homoerotic material."

I agree with this one hundred percent, but there are plenty of parents who
disagree with this vehemently and who certainly do not want their kids
performing on stage while such material is being presented.

The question is: do you screen those people out of your event, or do you
program your event around those people?  I suspect most organizations do a
little of both.

Rachel, what if the young "channeler" you mentioned in your previous post
was on the same bill as someone who read children's poetry, or who brought
a lot of kids and their parents into the audience?  Wouldn't your cringe
factor be multiplied?  What if these same parents then went to the local
newpaper, and through this your reading series receives the only media
publicity it has ever received in the local newsmedia?

So, do you tell the "channeler" to censor himself, or do you tell the other
reader they might not want to bring their kids to the reading?  I find both
alternatives somewhat distasteful, but I'm still not quite sure how I would
handle it myself.

Thanks for the poem, Hugh. As the mother of a 10 year old, I know that the word
"fuck" would cause quite a stir among the children, but my response to that is
kind of humorous, because the kids I know don't use swear words in common
discourse, but get a HUGE kick out of them, and especially love to watch their
parents respond to them. As for "jerking off in socks," I suspect that'd be a
difficult line for a 13 year old to experience in a group of peers. I can't
imagine what response Becky was going for.

And with (is it Barnes & Noble or B. Dalton?) fighting to keep Jock Sturges'
book on their shelves, the whole question of what children should be exposed to
flares up again.

A good book: _The Body in Question_. Photography & questions of trangression
(includes Jock Sturges, Mapplethorpe, the woman who photographs
transvetites/transexuals). And for a GREAT essay, check out Dave Hickey on
Mapplethorpe in Hickey's _The Invisible Dragon: Four Essays on Beauty_.

I have a Robert Morris book with an image of Morris naked on the cover. All of
the kids in the neighborhood are aware of this book, because my daughter, who
insists it be turned cover-down in her presence, MUST show it to everyone. And
then she explains that we have lots of naked covers on our books, because
they're art.

I also think of Richard Serra's "Tilted Arc," the gorgeous sculpture that was
removed from a public space because at least part of the "public" hated having
to walk around it to get to their places of business, etc. It caused quite an
argument between two of my friends: one a curator, one a sculptor who often
makes public pieces.

I don't know the answer to this; but it's a great subject.

Hugh,

I'm so glad to hear/read this note of yours on Charles' post about the Becky
Byrkit performance.  I feel very much the same way as you  (though, for fear of
going overboard about something I didn't even witness, I was reluctant to say
anything).  But this was going through my head: It's one thing to knock the
mainstream for not being hip or open to a lot of "our" formal innovations and
"radically open" politics; it's another thing altogether to foist that kind of
performance on kids and their parents, subject them to a captured audience
thing like that (and for what?  Shock the bourgeois Equals art?).  If art's not
supposed to be a commodity, then, I don't know, it just sounds like a
disgustingly arrogant (or very regretfully mistaken) gesture, that evening's
performance.

Then, too, I wasn't there, and some of these feelings of mine come from a
considerable
bad mood too much poetic theatrics continually and perennially set off in me.
Also, I'd hate to sound "conservative," but this just sounds like an awful
night and I believe the parents have every right to be angry.

Again, Hugh, thanks for your level-headed response, and Charles, too, for
bringing up this issue.                      Steve Tills

Yeah, this is just SENSATIONALism.  Best American Poetry, too?  I dunno...

Anyway, Hugh, I agree with you even more now that I've seen this, too.

I'll see if I can't just shut up now, though.  Steve

The Byrkit issue is a tough one.

I do fault Becky Byrkit for getting children involved in a performance they
didn't know, and their parents didn't know, would have the kind of content
it had.

I also don't think children need to be saved from the erotic, not at all.
But I don't think that's what we're talking about here. More about a poet
who didn't let children or parents (not in the audience, but IN her
performance) know what that performance was about. Should they have asked?
Probably so. But that doesn't excuse Byrkit.

As far as what she read or performed, I have no problem with it, nor with
it being available to audiences of all ages. I'm not enthused about her
work at all, but I would never censor it or try to limit its audience.

I do think the newspaper article was ridiculous, although not AS ridiculous
as some community responses to it. If you want to see the online version of
the article, I believe you can find it at
http://www.azstarnet.com
or at least you can today, I don't know what they do there when the next
day's issue of the online paper comes out. But the online version has
responses from the community linked to it. While one I read this morning
supports the poet, others do not, and even invoke more strangeness than the
newspaper quote about speaking "negatively about god." One respondent
decries the foibles of liberals and ends with the question, "Where is Joe
McCarthy when we need him?" We can laugh at that, but it's also scary.

And of course, the sad thing to me is, after all the 16 years of this
poetry festival, years which have featured people like bp Nichol, Robert
Creeley, Daphne Marlatt, Kamau Brathwaite, Mei-mei Berssenbrugge, Amiri
Baraka, Allen Ginsberg, Nathaniel Tarn, Ron Silliman, Susan Howe, Michael
Palmer, Rosmarie Waldrop, Jerome Rothenberg, Gwendolyn Brooks, Nathaniel
Mackey, and many many more -- THIS is what commands the newspaper's front
page attention. It (the Byrkit event) wasn't good poetry, and it's not good
news.

Rachel,

I don't think the erotic is bad.  For children?  I can't decide that for
them or their parents/guardians.

"She needs to be punished"?  Well, of course not.  But it's quite possible
she showed exceptionally bad taste or simply (quite possibly) made some
regretful choices that evening.

The Shakespeare of the comic-collage = poem genre has to be Jess (aka Jess
Collins, nee Burgess Collins), Robert Duncan's longtime partner.

In a rather different vein, Dave Morice has turned many classic poems into
comics of various sorts.

One of Tom Raworth's books has an orange rectangle image on the cover which is
credited on the verso as Mercator's Orange.

My 6-year-olds have been loving A Humament with a directness that makes me
realize exactly what a "picture book" it really is (tho, frankly, there are a
few pages we mumble through so as to avoid the Arizona ambush problem
ourselves).

I remember going to a reading way back in the 1990s when Anselm Berrigan
was introduced as "the sexiest poet in San Francisco."  Well, he's grayed
and matured now (and moved to Brooklyn) but the former It Boy still knows
how to pack a poem with wit, touch, a shimmering irony and plenty of
U-turns between sense and bafflement.  Berrigan is a vortex, a nexus, a
weather system all to himself.  Wherever he goes he catalyzes atmospheres,
scenes, admirers, and this fine new work.  Words--the right words--spin his
way like darts.  Berrigan is the author of On The Premises (Gas Editions)
and They Beat Me Over the Head with a Sack (Edge Books).  He currently
teaches at Brooklyn College.  This event marks a happy return for us.

We celebrate with Yedda Morrison the publication of her first book, Her
Knife, Fork & Spoon: A Book of Etiquette (Double Lucy Press), and the first
issue of Tripwire, the magazine of youth poetics she edits with David
Buuck.  She was born in San Francisco, lived in a free store in the Haight
Ashbury, and spent her childhood "on communes, attending anti-nuclear power
rallies, etc."  She was the assistant editor for Moving Border_ and a
former intern at Small Press Traffic.  In Morrison's writing distinctions
disappear between person and object, object and subject, tense and
waistcoat.  On this shifting ground of raw, burnt satin, an uneasily female
perspective emerges, evoking the claustrophobic sensuality of Eva Hesse,
Gloria Grahame, Jean Rhys.

Hi, this is Kevin Killian in San Francisco.  Dodie Bellamy and I will be
out of town from April 24th through May 3, and I'm looking for someone who
can come and stay in our apartment while we're away.  If you're coming to
San Francisco during this period and looking for a place to stay let me
know.  Basically I need someone to feed our two cats and take in all the
mail.  The cats, Blanche and Stanley, are quite friendly and love having
visitors.  The apartment is close to downtown San Francisco and right in
the middle of everything.  For those of you who have never been here it was
featured in Feb 1995 issue of ARTFORUM and believe me has not changed much
in the intervening years.  So, let me know if you can help me out here.
Even if you are not staying long or just for a weekend or whatever it would
still help me.

Back channel please, although all would be interested I'm sure in how I'm
solving this common problem.

Thanks

Kevin K.

Actually it is the blue light emitting aliens that I would worry about most.
The ones that emit a a blue glow might cook you with the likes of high energy
gammas much more easily than the green glow aliens. The green glow aliens are
nothing nice, to take home to dinner, either. They could cook you almost as
easily. This is why I always laugh about the friendly green glowing men from
Mars. They are anything but friendly. More alike to walking into an xray
machine without any lead shielding ?  Possibly.

The yellowish scintillating glow aliens, and the orange yellow glow and
reddish glow aliens are relatively safe in comparison. Might be a little
warm settling down to dinner with a reddish glow alien, but it should be
safe enough unless
spontaneous combustion happens.

The yellowish scintillations are most common of all, and safest of all.

Some ghost stories include those. That is what the ghosts appear to be. They
are sensed as yellowish or yellowish orange scintillations.

I myself have had some experiences of that kind. The first when I was a
an early teen. It was a battlefield of the war of 1812 - 14, in Stoney Creek
Ontario and while in the park I "bumped into" something. It was perceivable
as a human form of yellowish scintillation to orange scintillation like the
profile
of a person from head to foot. Stronger at the head and about five feet
roughly in height. I am sure it was a dead soldier. At least the energetic
imprint of one that might have died there, leaving some emanations as
information locked into the local matrix of material stuff that had
persisted from that time period.

Inter dimensionals also manifest as yellowish and yellowish orange
scintillations sometimes. Lots of stories to that effect, so I tend to
believe there is a basic natural phenomenon in common to all of that, and in
common to what is at the basis of Cherenkov radiation.

i really fell out of the loop on this thread; i hope it's not too
late . . . the conversation has gone many places & it's been fun
catching up -- & in light of the quiteness of this (apostate?) list time
i'll jump right in. . .

so here i am, "womankind, with her tools of magic, the broom and the
mop" (Hawthorne)

but mostly i want to respond to Mark Weiss' post:

isn't it also, though, prosidically _sensical_ -- one way to make sense,
which happens to be mapped onto another sense-making system (gender)?

> Men and women have been more-or-less communicating with language for a long

Or rather, men have been "communicating" to women . . .  not to
forget that we're also talking about a power relation.  But this
thread has, i think, moved beyond that --

i agree with you, more or less about the genders understanding
eachother -- only it's not that the differences are superficial, but that
they're so widespread & undetectable; i mean to stake difference between
two genders is just one way of mapping, delimiting & so discussing,
"difference";

just as cixous & irigaray map gender onto writing to talk abt. it.
Of course women don't write differently from men as a gender -- but
women relate to the whole set of relationships, of which language is
but one, "differently" (in a set which includes innumerable
differentlies).  So as reductive as French feminisms is in
places, I can understand the use, however temporal/ary in
making that reduction. When Irigaray & Kristeva try to
get at a different understanding of time, of narrative, of logic,
they want nothing less than to rewrite (or at least irrupt) the whole
of western metaphysics -- & they see possessing
a body marked "other" as being capable in some ways of accomplishing
that; they see the text as one thing that can be a marker of that
different set of relations, in this case in text's opacity, rather than
in its transparency (to pull out a whole other set of binaries that
are often dispute)

I don't think this is what Katy was after -- rather she saw certain
formal/syntactic qualities as having been employed by women writers
to perhaps mark or "gender" a text.  (hence katy's words:
>I think it is also entirely possible to do individual readings of
> various "experimental" female writers through a lens of gender
> identificiation

i.e. a lense that sees gender -- am i right, katy?)
I'd like to talk a little more about the gendering though -- if we're
trying (as an intellectual socius) to think beyond binaries then we
have to allow that texts can be multiply marked "others" with the
understanding that there is no "self" (in the self/other equation) --
& by singling out women writers we undermine that effort -- though
i'd feel pretty comfortable saying texts can be marked "other" than
hegemonic, i.e. antinomian, thereby relating "otherness" to a whole
set of operations (in some places denoted as patriarchy -- though
what does that really mean anymore?) rather than to a particular
"gender" (o great now i have to put that in scare quotes)

Of course women aren't more prone to dashes or rupture or hypotaxis.
But according to Irigaray, until we find a "female" language that women
can't exist as other than "other"; now if you're a lacanian this makes perfect sense!!
 -- but this is just the sexier version of the "dream of a common language"
-- it doesn't exist & there's no reason why men can't go searching
for it as well!

I think a lot of what goes on in contemporary women's poetry is the
refusal to be "othered" & a claiming of language as a material to explore
all sorts of difference -- while still being a "feminist" (in Howe's
antinomian sense of the word, or Dodie's sense of it not being a
valid word).  But that just might be my sense of my ill-fraught intentionalism
which doesn't make it through my texts anyway.

"Cherenkov [Cerenkov] radiation (P.A. Cherenkov)
     Radiation emitted by a massive particle which is moving faster than
light in the medium through which it is travelling. No particle can
travel faster than light in vacuum, but the speed of light in other
media, such as water, glass, etc., are considerably lower. Cherenkov
radiation is the electromagnetic analogue of the sonic boom, though
Cherenkov radiation is a shockwave set up in the electromagnetic field."

This comes from

http://www.goto.com/p/resultframes.mp?rawq=Cherenkov+radiation&canon=%28cherenkov%26radiation%29&index=0&urllist=eD%2f%2bdQ02Q2Im5iRX5uelglXnJlboF2RUFmcmF%2bvnJJYX6ydjak3MyU2sAqvOy09KzYGrRzZftzg5Uy8nM0mvFEiD3BLsGgBVmJhjDDUTAJpKL9E%3d&type=search

Obviously, this doesn't [didn't? won't? -- I guess it depends on how
quick you are...] help.

        Help! Does the Cherenkov radiation derive [proceed? precede?] only from
tachyons? & even if so [<so?], what has that to do with the sort of
wraith-persistence you describe, & what has that to do with poesis?
        Also, you mention only a range within the visible spectrum; surely
events of such energies ramify at higher [& perhaps lower?] energies,
no?

I am pretty sure that Daredevil aka MATT Murdock has been around in comic form
before anyone on this poetics list was born, who knows? like 1920s..
What say someone backchannel me with Sean Killian (of Catskill fame)'s phone
numbers so I can tell him about the Tortoise show in NYC
_On the Poetics of collage, I see some of Scalapino as collage, Dead Souls
possibly but what I enjoy the most is some of Ezra Pound's Cantos...it
depends..
When growing up my favorite thing to say around the late 70s was "Wondertwins
Power ACTIVATE" touching invisible rings to my sister Tanya's hand.
"Form of a Bucket of water" and then throwing myself down on the ground
headache county!
So somebody explain something to me about Diane Wakowski, in some of her
earlier poems she talks about a twin brother who commits suicide, in a later
interview I read that this brother possibly never existed.. and when people
asked her about it she would look away.  So what's the deal with this, did she
make him up or what? I know it shouldn't matter but it doesn't make sense to
make up a twin suicide, if it is real that is truly horrible....my nightmare..
"Form of a mouse astronaut!"

Rae,

Nobody's gotten their contributors copy.  The book's only been in print for
like two weeks.  We had two cases of them at the reading at SPT and we sold
out.  We could have easily sold another case.  120 people came.  The
readers kept saying what a "moving" experience it was.

Though I don't have time to print out the entire table of contents, here
are Rae's poems:  Grace, Dusk, Single Most, Admission, Home Federal,

This is Kevin Killian, thinking anecdotally about the issue of children and
how they're affected by the performance of the erotic on stage....

Dodie remembers seeing Asa Watten placidly and studiously coloring and
drawing on the floor of some of the most bizarre poetry events in Bay Area
history.  Nothing fazed Asa, he always had a new picture to draw.  And he
could sit through the lo-n-n-g-est poetry marathons too, he had the
incredible, grave, patience of a Buddha.

I remember putting on Raymond Pettibon's play "Horror Tape Script" at New
Langton Arts last year, or two years ago, and for the first time worrying,
wow, what if kids come to this.  [Those of you who have read the script
will know it's a text originally written for videotape about 3 high school
football players and their cheerleader girlfriends.  Spending a weekend at
a deserted, spooky mountain lake.]  The other actors and I had to simulate
all kinds of sex on stage, as well as mouth some raw language of the
Pettibon kind.  None of us were actually teens, though Edmund Berrigan came
close.]  I told the box office, don't sell any seats to kids.  I didn't
want their little faces staring in shock.  I don't like them anyhow and
don't think they bring much to the party.  Hopefully the choir children in
Becky Byrkit's performance will tonight be looking at their socks in a new
way, etc.  Dear Charles (Alexander), I'm coming to Tucson next month and
plan to behave as decorously as possible!

When I was a little boy Ann-Margret came to our school and sang and danced

read Irish poets. She's fairly certain the usual suspects will be well
represented, and would like to read some women poets. The problem: I'm
either drawing a blank on women poets from Ireland (except Eaven Boland),
or I'm thoroughly ignorant on this topic (I'm casting the first vote for
the latter). So as I said, a little help, please...
        The reading will by saturday, april 18. And all help, however
little, will be appreciated. Backchannel if you prefer...

but some of it was also in standard (readable/pronouncable) English...

Improved directions for reading


enter Probing.
arboretum through its nonmain entrance.   gate located adjacent to.
Golden Gate sPark at the intersection.

of 9th hA-venue and Langpo Way.

after entering Stray, bing the Arboretum gate, palooking
paved path for all others heading south.
towards (sign marked "California Natives").

follow this paved path, straying roughly.   parallax L'way until
you hear the screech, the nursery buildings.  children
ambushed by erotica.

after pasting the nursery buildings, bare (its your right) (north) on the
paved
path and look for the Assonance enTrail sign.  this is an unpaved
path.

follow the Reading sWay and look for
markers… #17…. #18.
three-ring bound clearing with
benches and a tree-stump podium.  the reading is
here.

I'll be teaching a poetry class to middle school students this quarter and
I want to focus on collage.

My idea is to have the students make up scrapbooks, and what I'm looking
for are short, simple, scavenger hunt type instructions/exercises to
provide them with tools for extracting possible poetic material out of
text.

Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks!

Thanks to Ron, "ScoutEW" and Billy Little for the references.

I'm a little far from New York, and will be until at least September,
so I'm pretty sure I'll miss the Padgett/Brainard piece.  Are there
any interesting examples of misappropriation of comic strip
panels in books or journals which I can look up when I get back
to the US?  I'm particularly interested in Jess/Jess/Burgess'
purported Shakespearian range.

Thanks again.

Hi, Erik & Others:

Thought you might be interested in exploring some of these non-mainstream &
self-published "poetic" comic-artist heroes of mine . . .

Dame Darcy's _Meat Cake_ . . . cartoon renderings of original gothic/Helen
Adamesque tales . . . spine chilling! . . . poetic! . . . super groovy! . . .

_The Fascist_ . . . Marxist rhetoric cut & pasted into the speech balloons of
Archie Comics characters . . . I don't know who the Minneapolis-based creator
of this is, or if s/he's still producing this magazine, but it was one of maybe
three things I actually *liked* about the Midwest . . .

Chester Brown's _Yummy Fur_ and _Underwater_ . . . bizarre retellings of Bible
stories, "Ed the Happy Clown," surreal, "silent" "movies," cartoon-essays on
schizophrenia interweave with autobiography . . .

Lynda Barry's "Ernie Pook's Comeek" . . . her intensely realized and plainly
told remembrances of childhood, which subtly address things often ignored in
comics like racism, class, misogyny, etc., have been a big influence on my own
poetry comics ("The New Life") . . . my personal fave of all comics artists
working today . . .

Bill Griffith's "Zippy the Pinhead" . . . chains of non-sequitors, skewed
pop-culture references, quotidian settings . . . If Zippy isn't poetry, well,
like, "whatever" . . . you can access Zippy's Active Filter (which turns the
usually boring language of any web-page into poetic Pinheadisms) at:

http://www.metahtml.com/apps/zippy/

Nancy Bonnell-Kangas's _Nancy's Magazine_ . . . I have Dan Davidson to thank
for turning me on, nearly 10 years ago, to my all-time favorite magazine . . .
poet/librarian/mom, NB-K publishes her always hilarious theme-issue collections
of opinions, cartoons, poetry, & "facts" very irregularly, but the mag's cheap
($7 for two issues) and always worth the wait: N's M, P.O. Box 02108, Columbus,
OH 43202

Julie Doucet's _Dirty Plotte_ . . . often violent . . . take-no-prisoners
feminist . . . occasionally quotidian/anecdotal . . .

Joe Matt's _Peep Show_ . . . Crumb-inspired autobiography . . . revealing &
hilarious  . . .

Seth's _Palookaville_ . . . Seth's autobiographically-based comics-obsessed
narrator tracks down Kalo, a real-life, one-time _New Yorker_ cartoonist of the
40s . . . beautifully rendered . . . see review of Seth's _It's a Good Life If
You Don't Weaken_ in this month's _Rain Taxi_ . . .

_Very Vicky_ . . . I don't remember the Boston-based team who does this, but
it's a great comic . . . plot largely stolen from "It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad,
Mad World" . . . Vicky is a hip, young, snotty, New York alcoholic stuck for
the summer in a North Carolina beach town . . .

Dan Clowes's _Eightball_ . . . an exceptional comic . . . poetic satire . . .
horrific dream-narratives . . .

Rick Veitch's _Rarebit Fiends_ . . . that's not the exact title . . . Veitch
illustrates his own and others's dreams . . .

OTHERS OF SIMILAR INTEREST: Jessica Abel, Chris Ware, Mary Fleener, Jim
Woodring, Gary Panter . . . well . . . there's lots . . . & I gotta get back
to, barf, "work" . . .

Have fun,

For listmembers in the Chicago area this week:
Nathaniel Mackey will be reading on the campus of the University of
Illinois at Chicago on April 15 and 16. Here's the more specific schedule:

Wednesday, April 15 at 3:00 p.m.: A Reading of Poetry and Prose.
(at the African-American Cultural Center, 2nd Floor, Adams Hall)


Thursday, April 16th, at 11 a.m.: "On the Influence of H.D. on My Poetry."
(at the Humanities Institute, Basement, Stevenson Hall)

Both events are free and open to the public. However, the University of
Illinois at Chicago is not the easiest place to find your way around, and
these aren't the most convenient of times for those who lead non-academic
lives, but it'll be worthwhile if you can make it.

In fact, says one list member of Mackey's visit to her campus,  "It was
terrific... highly recommended; dense duncan-mediated, cecil taylor thrown
in as well as Kamau Brathwaite as well as oceanic consciousness
("tidalectics"), good for those of us in the midwest."

-- Maria Damon, University of Minnesota

Bern Porter has produced 10s of books & 100s of pages from the trash can
at the post office & the copy shop, they tend toward a very demographic
diversity of materials...

also would highly recommend showing the kids a copy of one of his big
found books like Books of Dos or Book of Donts which need no explanation
& a quickflip thru can be a delightful way to worm thru a student's
self-conscious hesitations.

one of my personal favorites (for collage writing) is scanning the
spines of books in bookstores & libraries. likewise a hologram of the
writerly impulse.

also this is oftrack of your request, but far & away the most success
Ive had working with kids is with creating neologisms, defining them &
using them in sentences.  its also very revealing of where each kid is
at, one's words will be body sounds & swear words & another might all be
about friends, & another about mosh pits.

swill!

took the walk across the brooklyn bridge yesterday and there threw the
choiring strings rang said trademark. (this is the view crossing from
brooklyn to manhattan).

my poetic sentiment quickly switched to poetic hilarity amidst sunny
skies and the steady streams of tourists. i hadnt known the promenade
would be dead center, with car traffic running both sides below. it was
like walking a boardwalk, like walking down the champs elysee, like the
biggest most permissive guiliani jaywalk ever invented!  one more
amusement park enclave, and pleasant.

those cables amazing; it really is like walking threw a harp.

 on collage: there's an exhibit  at Krispy Kreme donuts hear near nyu of
a man named michael albert:  the brochure reads: "The Serial Artist.
Serialism: Cerealism + Sir Realism."  he's made puzzle-like collages out
of cereal boxes, POST cereals (for post-cerealism get it). And too,
innerestingly has been at both ends of appropriation of product labels--
said cereal box collages and other collages made of food labels (man
afta my own heart) , but also  some of his artwork has been made _into_
product labels, for his self start company Tri-State Natural Foods.
whose fruit juices are avail. "here at Krispy Kreme." a quote from the
brochure agin:  "Though some question the practicality of art as a thing
in general, no one can deny the necessity of the label for product
packaging, and what a dream for any young American to combine the joy of
creating unique and beautiful designs and images within the framework of
reality in this busy, moving, ever-evolving world of commerce in which
we live."

hmmm...reality dream indeed...

There is a good one, StraY BULLETS AND Billy Corgan the Smartest Kid on earth-
I really like the search for Kato in Palookaville but I was raised on corner
store comics like Spiderman and even the Archies(lame huh) but my sister and I
had to find titles we could both like, i think she likes fantastic four
anyways check out
those tricky cad drawings everyone, a play on dick tracy
Flame On!PS i wrote a letter on behalf of Steve McCafferey and got a lame
letter back saying he was never formally hired so it shouldn't matter if he
isn't working there now, it was a "form" letter i'd be interested to see how
many people got the same one.

Comics_ at whatever the rare book room is called there . . . Me & Dan D. used
to get kicked out for uncontrollable laughing . . . haven't yet read _Stray
Bullets_ and didn't know of _Billy Corgan_, so thanks for those . . . Eightball
has become stupid? Or Darcy & Matt? I admit I haven't looked into Darcy's world
in a while . . . but still love Eightball . . . I was raised on _Creem_
magazine, myself . . . Lester Bangs, et al. . . . and, speaking of comics &
_Creem_, do you remember The Mad Peck?!? . . . YEE-haw . . . cartoon-rendered
record reviews . . . & whatever happened to Futsy Nutzle? . . . BIG fan, too,

Futher to Catherine Walsh:

The most reliable, and probably the fastest, way to get your hands on
her work is to go through the distribution service set up by hardPressed
Poetry in Ireland (hardPressed is run by Walsh and Billy Mills, another
wonderful Irish experimental poet, but one whose X/Y ratio excludes him
from the reading in question).

hardPressed Poetry
37 Grosvenor Court

Note that hardPressed will have a new journal of the same name coming
out this fall -- write for info.

zauhar's post reminds me that i didn't cover the final
Mackey-in-Twin-Cities event in my previous post (because it hadn't happened
yet).  he read at the Nomad Gallery, a new place run by the brother of the
guy who runs the Khyber Pass Afghani restaurant in St Paul.  It was their
inaugural reading, and Habib the proprietor said it was an honor to be able
to host Mackey.  The space was really lovely, nicely lit, and NM sat w/ his
back to a big window.  There were Afghani rugs covering the space behind
him, and he sat at a table likewise draped w/ rugs, a beautiful effect, and
on the table was a vase with a single rose.  he sat behind the table as he
read.  he started w/ the Jimi Hendrix poem from "Eroding Witness," in
response to a request from me (i forgot to thank him afterwards). then he
read mostly from the forthcoming Atet:A.D. and some, as i recall, but maybe
i'm wrong, from Udhra.  Very responsive audience and a good feeling.  An
aesthetically satisfying experience, especially on top of the wonderful
meal we'd just enjoyed at the Khyber Pass.  Highly recommended to all
traveling thru the TCs.  At times during the reading, sitar music floated
over from the restaurant, a thin wall away, and heavy treads above from the
folks in the apartment upstairs.  those sound effects "haunted" the space
appropriately.  i think it was NM's favorite "event" of his visit, and
small wonder, it was really a fine evening, organized by Mark Nowak of XCP
fame.

I recently found a copy. It features a comic book cover. The poems, however,
while printed on cheap comic book paper, are straight text - no
illustrations. Tom Peters, owner of the Beat Book Shop here in Boulder, had
a handful of these comics three months ago when I bought mine. Whether he
has any left, I don't know. You can contact him, though, at:

one (possibly collaborative) game the surrealists used
was to take an existing text with a recurring word -
product labels are good for this - and substitute another.
Alternately, you can treat an existing text as a mad-lib
(everyone remembers these, right?): remove selected
words in favor or their parts of speech (noun, adj., verb),
of which you make a separate list

        noun
        adj.
        verb etc.

without having seen the original or the text with which
they are playing, the other participants supply words that
match the categories, re-assembling the text by substitution.
It might be especially useful if you employ either a text
familiar to yr students, or a text that carries some authority -
e.g., Clinton's inaugural speech or a Frost poem.

another variation is to limit the possible responses to, say
words associated with the "peace talks" in Northern Ireland.
Often, the players responsible for "filling in the blanks" take
up a narrative or associative thread of their own, which is
fully disr8upted by its distribution within the prior text.

        so, for instance:

PropertySheetHandlers and {3EA48300...: Here, the key structure
does not directly reveal the purpose of the {3EA48300... key, but if
that  subkey is opened under the CLSID key (not shown in the figure),
its Contents Pane identifies it as an "OLE Docfile Property Page."

[noun] and [noun]: Here, the [noun] does not directly [verb]
the [noun] of the {3EA48300 key, but if that [noun] is opened [prep]
the [adj] key (not [verb] in the figure), its [noun] [trans. verb] it
as an "[adj] Property Page."

where

        noun=breakfast
        noun=artifice
        noun=tree frog
        verb=ruin
        noun=the President of the United States
        noun=cheese
        preposition=within
        adj=admirable
        verb=disgust
        noun=Senator John Glenn
        transitive verb=revile
        adj=unpleasant

        yields

Breakfast and artifice: Here, the tree frog does not directly ruin
the the President of the United States of the {3EA48300 key, but if
that cheese is opened within the admirable key (not disgusted in
the figure), its Senator John Glenn reviles it as an "unpleasant
Property Page."

I can but add my voice to those who have recommended Catherine Walsh's work.
Not to be missed.

The Irish writer Philip Casey has a web site called "The Fabulists" which
contains a dictionary of Irish writers.  Any search engine should find it
for you.  It contains information on a variety of Irish women poets.

So Aldon (and others) was it on or not? I had a Seder to attend that night,
but I could have taped it. Speaking of which, yesterday was a real good day
on cable -- I taped, in order, part of "The Fifties" (documentary on the
History Channel), then the Thelonious Monk "Straight No Chaser" (on IFC),
followed by a Bravo profile on Kerouac! After all that I was wondering what
decade I was in (a problem which the folks in Arizona seemed to have as
well) -- recommended viewing for those who have already had too much of the
millennium!

Duncan McNaughton has an interview in the latest _Mike and Dale's_ that, in
effect, repeats what I think Jack Spicer said -- namely, the Fifties were
the real revolutionary decade, until the Beatles killed it all off in 1964
(thus starting "the Sixties") -- whaddya think, listees?

You got a defective copy. There should be a drawing of a bunch of TV
antennae and paddleboards with the poem "Fifteen Hundred Tons of Hay @ 1c
per Pound"  and a crucifix picture a few pages before the end. Pictures by
Michael Myers.

I had students handle this text in a course this spring.

MIME-version: 1.0

I recently saw you mentioned
in an old poem, I can't remember its title,
by your friend Jimmy Schuyler,
whom I call James because he never
was anyone I knew, and he knew a lot
of people, a lot them people
who also knew and liked you,
all of them people I don't know,
though I know what I like when I see it,
like your art, which I also saw recently
in an article in Art in America.
You seemed to have loved, besides guys,
flowers and the Sunday funnies,
and you found ways to draw from them
icons for your various and sundry beatitudes.
Like Nancy, the girl from the strip of the same name,
whom you transmorgrified lovingly
in a couple of paintings and collages
even though she could never reciprocate your attentions
in her own world by lifting up her skirt to show a penis.
That would have been as crazy as having Sluggo throw
a brick to the back of her head
the way Ignatz would do for Krazy Kat
with his brick trailing its quiet -ZIP-
though it could also go -ZIZ-
same as a comet does as it comes and goes
from perigee to apogee (actually
they're called "perihelion" and "aphelion"
but I prefer "perigee to apogee") and back again,
unless it gets drawn into the Sun
or bumps into something else
or has its ellipse perturbed
into a parabola of no return,
its tail gone out, the next nearest star
a ways away, if it's lucky,
though typically it's not.
Bye for now, see you soon,
if not, then eventually.

Yours,
        Kamandi, the Last Boy on Earth

Tralfamadore Cafe to James Brown downtown or they will politey ask you to get
down..if anyone ever sees David Landrey around the Queen city tell him Erik
Sweet says hi, he was one of the greatest teachers I ever had. So for now,

Dear Schiller

... I am a painter; I put out my eyes for you.  Tell me, again, the
bleeding darkness, of the things in me I cannot see, I will never see.
Tell me, there are cities beneath the grasses of the plains of Sicily;
tell me of the impenetrable lead.  Of the Roman earth.  These come back to me
in a woodcut....  I am naive, love me thus -- is it, then, of
humility to be at one with your nature?  Is it humility?  What is the
propriety, the patrimony of these states....

Waste me in a wanton hour, turn of the pen; no, it is the distance which
destroys me, the haze of an idyll.  I ask you to defeat me even before I've
opened my mouth.  You have seen your end in me.  You've written as much.

The city, since you asked, spills along the shore forever eastward.
Always in spring and summer: hot, humid and hazy.  It is the stuff of New
York and Boston that wafts across the lake.  The cities jostle, shoulder
to shoulder.

The ladies here have a curious habit.  They will, in small or large
groups, swim and bathe along the public shores of the lake; they are
indifferent to passers-by, and do not scream at the approach of men.
Indeed, they are a pleasant sight: grouped on the large rocks, submerged
to their faces and bathing caps, and often holding their children.

This tedious example resonates, I believe, with something of the
beautiful, those things which you have written me.  Strange that a foreign
practice should find accord with some more primary thing in man.

And yet this is to a certain split.

Ah, since you asked I will write of love only in white ink

Once again I'm forwarding a call for papers for an on-line journal a
friend edits.  He wanted his next issue to be on comics (even tried to
get a Chris Ware interview), but couldn't gather enough material.
Perhaps everyone talking this stuff up might want to send him some work
(calling Gary Sullivan).

A poet whose work I liked quite a bit during the late 60s, early 70s, was Tom
Veitch, a NYC school (gen 3) poet with a strong spiritual undercurrent. He was
in SF for awhile around the early to mid-70s and then moved, up to Sonoma or
beyond I think. Does anyone know what the man is up to these days?

In a very similar vein, Victoria Rathbun? I had heard that she was sick about
a decade ago, but nothing since.

Had back-channeled at first; re-post for JK:

The Academy bookstore on W.18th
Also, the one right across the street.


Inexpensive goldmines. Ask Jordan, who works around the corner.

Saw The Hotel Wentley Poems at the Academy, signed by the author to one
Leroi Jones. This item however was not inexpensive (about $100). Picked up
first cloth edition of MAXIMUS pretty cheap. Also Zukofsky's LITTLE, John
Wiener's NERVES, some New Directions Poet of the Month chapbooks from early
40s for a couple bucks a piece.
The Academy also has Folocroft reprints with library bindings for 3 or 4
dollars a pop. I found Thoreau's LETTERS thus; collected Hazlitt writings,
Whitman's journalism. And cheap, 2nd hand poetry: CIVIL NOIR, I DON'T HAVE
ANY MORE PAPER SO I BETTER SHUT UP, among others.

Also, I believe Keston Sutherland is reading in NYC this weekend. At the
Zinc Bar. W.Houston and LaGuardia. A great reading series-- go go go go go
go go go

Approximately fifty people heard poet David Bromige read selections from
his work last night (Monday, April 13) at the Canterbury House near the
campus of the University of Kansas in Lawrence. The audience responded
warmly to Bromige's unprepossessing manner and witty, serious poems.

Speaking only for myself...  I had not been to a poetry reading in a
couple of years and felt invigorated afterwards. Thanks to Maryrose Larkin
and everyone else who brought Bromige to Lawrence.

well, SOMEONE is, goddammit! And frontiers-people, Niagra and otherwise,
would do well to attend. Perhaps Marcella Durand will post a reminder of the
readers if she can, as Anselm is away and Douglas not on the list.

Dan, that's a fascinating re-writing of Andrews' title..........Kind of

Urgh. Well, it works for me.

Try the main url for the >>>iceflow>> site:
http://www.interaccess.org/iceflow/index.html
and then select Tim McLaughlin's 'Threw the Read Window'. The bpNichol
section is called 'possible saviours.

Good luck,
Carolyn

new non at  http://socrates.berkeley.edu/~moriarty/

In working on the latest non additions I've been lead to wonder about
writers' use of the paragraph and/or stanza. Debrot's new stuff in non seems
like desiccated paragraphs to me - not surprisingly as it is in relation to
Tender Buttons - but he calls it 'songs.' Shaw's work seems more stanzaic,
Scalapino's is mostly prose and Davis is of course all over the map.

In general, the stanza seems more song-like, the paragraph to relate more
back to prose. I find I am currently using both in different combinations.

Wondered how others relate to using these sub-forms -

CHICKEN BREASTS


He flushed my shirtwaist over this bubble-drain
that clenches under the floor a nocturne of the peril maxim:
break the skin of pain, soft implosion-notes on jellied fruit
driving up to the teeth of his lust.  Crawfish eyes sucked,
popped, reft of beauty, my waste merges with positivity of loss:
we used to patter enraged towards what now glows
as much as anything else, lil patriots
permanently out on the town.
The dried bounty of my loss has been burnt on drying
wrecks senseless of the larger bounty, and gives,
dying the blankets over which it is cooled in the amber
bedroom of pleasant sojourns and diurnal rest.
I'm a wreck of fashion, becoming precisely a wraith
of lassitude up to the grease-trap where face slathered
as if with remorse in hair, tallow, frying muck, splits
asunder or is chorefully drained.  So much for shunning
the torches of panic: clutching my ragged skin for another ride,
board up for the work-district, flick distention into the token box.
Such that we are no longer niggardly with our shameful supplies,
but blow out the ear of taste with munchies and burnt recipes
he corrects, he ladels, in the pine forest I picnic on nipples
if there's nil else and gaze radiantly from a bared rock
sun or no sun.

Charles Wright won the Pulitzer for poetry today for his collection _Black
Zodiac_.  I happen to have read this book one afternoon last week, not
having read much of Wright's work in several years.  He writes a beatiful
phrase, but I can't see what was behind the decision.  It seems like the
same old thing for him. Does anybody know who were the other nominees?

Agreed, David. This volume is neither more nor less distinguished than his
previous _Chickamauga_ or the one before that - or the one before that. He
does have a lapidary way with a line, as they say,and I've often enjoyed
him. But adventuresome he's not. Once again - and in vain - the cry goes up:
what about Susan Howe? What about Charles Bernstein? Etc. Oh funky day.

This is from www.pulitizer.org:
Also nominated as finalists in this category were: "Desire" by Frank Bidart
(Farrar, Straus and Giroux), and "The Vigil" by C.K. Williams (Farrar,
Straus and Giroux).

There's also a list of the judges.

Miekal's posting about Bern Porter prompts me to announce that I distribute
all of Bern's books still in-print and some out-of-print. I can send a
catalog (a glorified word for what is really a two-page listing) to anyone
that's interested via snail or e-mail. I'm also working on a Bern Porter
website, but this is still a ways off.

By the way--I saw the Secret Location on the Lower East Side show at NYPL
when I was in NYC last month and I loved it. Spent hours gazing into the
display cases. However, I was disappointed not to find any mention or
presentation of books that Bern has published or authored. His work would
have fit perfectly into the area of the show devoted to publishers from
other parts of the country who were active before 1960. Along with
Ferlinghetti, J. Williams, Laughlin, et al, Bern was one of the most
important small press publishers of the post-war era. Unfortunately, just
about all of the histories and exhibits of that era don't give him the sort
of credit he deserves.

James Schevill's WHERE TO GO, WHAT TO DO, WHEN YOU ARE BERN PORTER: A
PERSONAL BIOGRAPHY (Tilbury House, 1992) is an excellent read into all that
Bern has accomplished. It's out-of-print, but I have a few copies left.

Since America Awards (the "Ferns," instituted in honor

and meaninglessness of the National Book Awards and
Pulitzer Prizes, etc. I think this might be as good a
day as any to announce to the poetics list the 1997 awards.

Don't know for sure what it was for but I caught a few minutes of Wright
reading at some stodgy NY venue on a cable station last week.  Nominees for
something or other, maybe the Pulitzer.  The other poet I happened to flip
onto before eventually a Jefferson biographer put me into high snooze was
Frank Bidart, reading from _Desire_.  Wright read a poem about Hopkins, I
think, and seemed at home in tweed but not behind that podium, and who can
blame him?  Nothing really against Wright but the cadence still seems rife
with echoes of Pound and might suffer in that comparison.  But then I
haven't engaged the book beyond what he mumbled and so can't really offer
an opinion.  Peering at the tube I judged it a TKO for Bidart, though the
applause was appropriately chipper for all. There probably were still other
nominees, no?  Is it that if one hangs around in certain quarters of po-biz
long enough sooner or later Dick and Ed come around with an oversized
letter and a cameraman?

no dog ear site, no other sites, not yet, though I'm also working for
National Poetry Foundation, whose website is www.ume.maine.edu/~npf/

can you email me an up-to-date price list for your Bern books that you
still want me to distribute to check against mine to make sure I'm accurate
as of this minute?

Thanks,

Must have been the National Book Critics Circle Awards nominees reading at
the National Arts Club a few weeks back here -- Wright took that prize, too.

I assume this is Paul Metcalf's Collected works, which is incredible and

Thanks for the posting, Rachel, but...
As a part-time resident of Pennsylvania who looks forward to summer
weekend visits to State College, PA, I have to issue a brief, though
major objection: Svoboda's is NOT a "technical" bookstore, it's the
best kind of independent bookstore, the ideal college-town bookstore,
located close to campus and near coffeehouses, etc. "The Little Professor"
store, I'm afraid to say, was (and I'm deliberately going for
understatement here) not very good. The kind of store, basically, that
makes me long for a Borders or a Barnes and igNoble's
        If you're ever in State College, be sure to check out Svoboda's
And there's a good used bookstore there, too, called Seven Mountains,
where, last time I was there, found _Sounds that Arouse Me_ by Bern
Porter. I won't miss the Little Professor as long as Svoboda's and 7
Mountains are around.

Caught a piece on C-SPAN two or three nights ago where Andre Schiffren -
formerly of Random House, but now founder of The New Press - said that there
have been 300 closings of independent bookstores over the past decade. Since
publishing has become part of other industries (see The Nation conglomerate
chart), the 4% annual profit margin that was traditional in the industry has
been pushed to become 15 or 20%. Even so, Schiffrin estimates that presses
like his can flourish in the 10% of the market the Big Companies either
ignore, concede or fail to dominate.

And yet, and yet - when I go to Barnes & Noble, they have every critical
theory title I could ask for and then some. And Boulder Books has - squat.
In addition, the owner of BB is by all accounts a colossally conceited
individual who badgers and intimidates the used bookstore owners of the area
- I won't go into all that here. But it makes me not want to support Boulder
Books. My real affection and devotion goes to these used stores and their
counterparts everywhere - these are where the pages of dream unfold in the
rimefrost of dust.

apparently one ploy of the chain bookstores is to haunt independents
looking for titles --in Cambridge, for inst, they'll go to Grolier's for
poetry titles and Harvard books for theory and cult studs, stock up on
those and put those sections in prominent places in their own chain store,
then, after they've driven the indies out of business, phase out the poetry
and the cult studs.  so, i try not to buy books there no matter what, even
if it means special ordering from an independent.  but yes, my faves are
the used bookstores, long may they thrive around the edges of commerce.

The latest issue of American Book Review has a piece, "New Poetry and
its Technology Anchorage," by Lee Ballentine in which there is mention of
a site about Bern Porter. The URL is:

www.henrymiller.org/newsletter/html/porter.html

Haven't taken a look myself, so I'm not sure what's there.

this from captain D's online tour guide of belfast, maine.

For a memorable experience, check out the Institute of Advanced Thinking
on Salmond Street in Belfast. Open daily year round, the Institute
features outdoor sculpture shows, indoor art shows, festivals and
readings. Admission is free. The Institute is the brainchild of Bern
Porter, who has been variously described as a "maverick publisher, rebel
physicist, master of found art," and "The da Vinci of the Atomic Age."

Julu and Jennifer and Nikuko and Julu and Jennifer Visit Nikuko


You'll get tired of seeing the shrines, Jennifer.
But, Julu, they fascinate me.
When you've been here six years like I have, they'll exhaust you.
We all go through the same things.
We all have been there before.
But, Julu, we're all different.
That's what I thought as well.
But you'll think differently.
Oh, it's Nikuko, hello.
Hello, Nikuko.
We're talking about shrines.
Ah yes, they fascinate me.
We Japanese people do not believe in anything.
We are very homogeneous in our one identity.
Ah, Nikuko, you always speak like you are reading Soseki.
Ah, that is true, Jennifer, I get all my thoughts from I am a Cat.
Yes, that is his most wonderful book.
You will get tired of reading books, Julu.
Ah, although I have read many books, I am already getting tired.
Books can be very tiring, especially after reading for six years.
You are making fun of me, Jennifer, but I have been here longer.
How long have you been here.
I have been in Fukuoka for six years and before that twenty in Tokyo.
Do you love Tokyo, Nikuko.
Yes, Julu, I do.
I love the old shrines which continue to fascinate me.
Shrines can be fascinating for many years.
There are so many to see and so many customs.
There are wonderful stories which readers of Gon will enjoy.
Ah, Jennifer, you will soon tire of manga, everyone does.
But Nikuko, I love manga for the wonderful graphics and high-powered sex.
The sex is very simple, but a lot of parts are cut out, Nikuko.
Do you think so, Julu.
Yes, I do, for example, the dildos and labia are now cut out.
Were they cut out before.
Yes they were cut out before.
There are so many men and women in manga.
I love the enormous breasts wet to the bursting point.
I love the big eyes and high cheekbones and spiky hair.
Everyone passes through that stage, Jennifer.
Do you think I am just passing through a stage, Nikuko.
Yes I do, Julu because you have just been here six months.
I have been here nine months, Julu.
I thought you were here six years, Nikuko.
I have been here all my life, Jennifer, because it is very beautiful.
I especially love the old shrines and the manga which are my favorite.
Perhaps you could be teasingly photographed for a manga.
Yes, that would be wonderful, to be teasingly photographed.
Perhaps I could pose in front of a wonderful old shrine.
I would be very religious in front of the shrine with bursting breasts.
Hello, Julu, welcome back.
I am very sorry but I had to leave for a moment.
I just had to look at some manga and walk around for good air.
Did you find the air very much to your liking.
Yes, the air around these shrines is very pleasant.
You will think otherwise, perhaps, when you are here longer.
Perhaps, since we gaijin are very homogeneous in our identity.
Do you think we think alike.
Yes, perhaps it becomes clear that we think alike, Julu.
Jennifer, do you have anything to say to this point.
Certainly, Nikuko, since for example we love Japanese food.
Julu, do you love Japanese food because you are here for six years.
Jennifer, I agree that it is a very short time and maybe it is otherwise.
Nikuko, that may be an answer to your thoughts on this matter.
Julu, I would have thought so, when I first arrived.
Everyone said, Jennifer, that I would pass through this.
Nikuko, you are more than correct, you are exact.
Yes, I do love shrines and my photographed breasts.
Everyone has homogeneous identities when they first arrive.
Bursting-manga wet my dreaming face and appetite for food.
There are times when Japanese books are loved the best by everyone.
Goodbye, Jennifer.
Goodbye, Julu.
Goodbye, Nikuko.
Goodbye, Jennifer.
Goodbye, Julu.
Goodbye, Nikuko.

hate Borders and Barnes & Noble too. To be fair, I also hate Grolier, but
that's another story.

The "chain" bookstores are demonized, no doubt about it. Fuck 'em, they

If Maria's conspiracy theory is sheer paranoia, it is shared by most
well-informed indie book people. Reports on Barnes & Noble in particular
show that it has targeted specific book markets wherever it has perceived a
vulnerable indie, and it has gone in to complete the kill at every
opportunity. This is not esoteric knowledge. Even PBS and CNN have done
takes on the story.

The latest rumor is that they are now planning to move into the used book
market. You will soon be watching your favorite used bookstores going
under. Borders may not be as ugly about this, but there is no doubt that B
& N is.

Daniel, I would urge your friends to treat B & N and Borders like their
landlords: tell them to watch their backs.

They don't need me to tell them. This is a job axiom we all share:
booksellers, teachers, paper-shufflers.

I don't watch the news programs you mention, and have no experience with
BarnsNoble.

Although I'm mostly a library person, in my secret nonpoet identity, I
have had some contact with book retail; and I've worked there some.

George Thompson and Maria are right: the basic strategy Maria outlines is
a very ordinary marketing tactic, from the capitalist point of view and
*is indeed* something that goes on.

Dan Bouchard is more than a little naive about this; and just why is he so
het up (as well as wrong??)

Daniel:

There was a senate hearing on B&N's practices several years back . . . you can
find it in the library . . . Maria's not at all paranoid . . . Borders totally
fucked Dan Odegaard out of a bookstore maybe 5 years ago in MPLS . . . a couple
of their coprorate heads came & met with Dan . . . told him if he didn't sell
to them, they'd move in anyway & screw his business . . . He declined their
offer . . . they're now sitting in the space where his bookstore used to be . .
.

I worked for Legal Aid while in MPLS . . . helped tenants go up against the
worst slimeball landlords there . . . and researched & wrote about Barnes &
Noble at the same time . . . not sure why you priviledge one concern over the
other . . . it might surprise you to know that a group of concerned MPLS
citizens actually stopped a Starbucks from moving in, once . . . Starbucks uses
similar practices . . . make deals with landlords to ensure exclusivity . . .
always move in near independents, ultimate goal being to drive them out of
business . . .

Again, this is all stuff well-documented . . . look into it before accusing
others of being paranoid . . . "a courtesy thing" . . .

Thanks,

Gary

perhaps this is a paranoid fantasy on the part of the person i heard it
from; it was told to me by the proprietor of one of the independent
bookstores in harvard square.  keep up the good fight.

All this and Maria hasn't even cyber-slapped me yet. Here is what I know: my
experiences at Borders (and subsequent information from people who have
stayed with the company). From this framework, I stand by my original reply
to Maria. The idea that Borders would consider it worth their time to
infiltrate small shops like Grolier and Harvard to copy their title stock AS
A MEANS of driving them out of business continues to strike me as pretty
stupid.

But my naivete is apparent. My credibility to speak of capitalist business
practices, marketing strategies, and so forth wanes in the face of B&N's
business practices and Starbuck's real estate deals.

Why do I privelege one concern (organizing tenants) over another (defending
small bookstores)? Well, why do people defend a particular for-profit small
bookstore when it's vulnerable to a bigger for-profit bookstore?

Finally--especially to you Gary--go back and read the three messages I
posted this morning. You will not find the word "paranoid" in them,
nevermind my accusing someone of being paranoid. Please read what is right
before your eyes before replying, "a courtesy thing."

If it was the proprietor of the Grolier, then "paranoid" is the right word.

Hi, Daniel:

I've gone back over your words. You tell Maria "Deploying staff to carry out
ploys against independent bookstores must be a secret only you are in on" and
"the conspiracy you outline below is ludicrous." It seems obvious to me that,
as well as being dismissive and condescending here, you're accusing Maria of
being paranoid.

Why I wouldn't privilege one concern over the other: in both instances what
we're talking about are unscrupulous & often totally illegal abuses of real
estate. I'm equally concerned about smaller, single-owner businesses
participating in similar abuse, as & when it happens.

But, maybe more to the point: as well as being aware of individual instances
like these . . . well, I think it helps to have as good a sense as you can as
to how these things, generally, can take place . . . some cognizance of the
social/economic system(s) that allow for these sorts of manifestations.

Yours,

Gary

St. Louis book chronicles:

A couple of years ago I walked into an independent bookstore in St. Louis
looking for Ishiguro's _The Unconsoled_ which had been published a few
weeks before--a present for a family member. No luck, so I had to go to a
still independent, but larger store (since purchased by Border's).

I was sorry when the smaller independent store went out of business, since
they had a great poetry section, yet I understood. They were forcing
customers like me to go the stores where I was assured of finding so
obvious a book--a new novel by a well-known novelist published by a major
commercial press.

I was sorry when the local independent mega-store was bought out by
Border's also. Yet this "independent" store was already, in their own
business practices, fairly ruthless, engaging in some of the same tactics
mentioned in relation to B&B and B's. Trying to out-border borders, they
ended up being swallowed up anyway.

Luckily, Left Bank books is still open in the Central West End.

with respect to harvard square, it was barnes and nobles, not borders, that
was the bookstore in question.  though the borders gary speaks of, that
took over odegaards, is right next to myhouse.  occasionally i do buy books
there, but after all this info, will be even more reluctant in the future.

As the effective size of corporations grows, and lesser economic entities
find it harder and harder to compete effectively with those that are
growing, amalgamating, joint venturing, and consolidating....this reflects
into the book trade as well as everywhere else....

In the book trade one of the biggest problems has been the difficulty small
presses, and self published authors, have in obtaining any meaningful
distribution and promotion. This leads to a few getting most of the market
share and the others not even recouping costs,....With fewer and fewer
independent dealers, there will be even less opportunity for many
individuals. Fewer will have any chance to be known, even in lesser ways,
and more shall have their work perish, at an ever faster pace.

The wierdest part about it is that it is also reflecting into little known
affinity and interest groups, where a similar attitude is happening as
occurs in big business and big distribution. Fewer and fewer individuals are
having any real chance of any success, even in terms of getting meaningful
readings as to their writing. A smaller and smaller group tend to get the
good gigs, paid or unpaid, where they can get significant, meaningful,
exposure and a chance at any kind of hope of any success.

In past years one such organization allowed every member who attended their
spring meeting to read something of their work. It was an afternoon of sharing
new creative efforts by all, where anyone could participate. Now this has
changed, to a big publisher sponsored reading by four or five of the better
established, better known, names, from within the organization. They are now
the Barnes and Nobles, Chapters, or whatever chain congolomerate equivalent,
while everyone is merely a "consumer".

Is this to be the current and future trend ?

A trend of more and more silenced voices in the arts ?

What "seems obvious" to you Gary is not obvious to everyone. Or, if I am
speaking again beyond my naive realm of knowledge, it is not obvious to me.
I would rather be quoted than interpreted, especially in a tricky medium
such as e-mail.

Anyway, we now know that the person who IS in on the secret ploys of the big
bookstores is "the proprietor of one of the independent bookstores in
harvard square."

Re: Morph et al's worries....

It seems to me that the greatest hope for the avaialability of lots and
lots of writers would be something like this list. I mean Rod just got to
post a list of new books to a pretty big chunk of the poetry readers who
would purchase such books.

I also think that Amazon and other electronic "bookstores" will have a
pronounced and really positive effect on the book industry.

I mean, it's not like B & N has any real interest in keeping us all from,
say, HD. They just don't have the space or the inclination to necessarily
purvey her books.

I think a much larger issue in this instance (re: availability) would be
the buying practices of libraries.

I like to browse around in a used bookstore as much as the next
guy...but I don't really mind the idea of buying my books over the net.

I understand that one of the issues here regards the owners of these
small stores. But (as someone has already pointed out, I
believe) why are these owners any "nicer" than other owners?

Best,
Katy

The natural food chains use similar tactics.  Here in Lawrence KS we drove
one (Wild Oats) out of town.  That the new Borders is indeed only a half a
block away from the one remaining semi-serious indie bookstore makes it
easier to park when going to the indie, but unfortunately the indie is
quite small and necessarily has large gaps.  Luckily the local Borders
hasn't figured out the market (I will drop no hints here) and therefore is
not more attractive.  Unluckily before it opened the two other semi-serious
indies closed in anticipation of bankruptcy.

This is easy to answer.  Small bookstores make independent judgements when
buying books, and the existence many small bookstores makes the existence
of many publishers possible.

Just try getting your local micro-press, or any press not on the master
list, into Borders or B & N.  Books by local authors occasionally manage to
get in (shelved in the local interest section, no matter what sort of book
it is), and other books absolutely cannot.

I was pleased to find books by Ange Mlinko, Lisa Jarnot, Peter Gizzi and
several other young writers at Waterstone's on Newbury St. in Boston.
It's a massive store, and a massive chain (in the UK particularly).  This
is, though, as you say rare; but maybe the beginning of a trend?  It
doesn't sound as if anybody here wouldn't -want- their book to be in
Borders, or would refuse to have it there -- should the big co.s decide to
patronise books relatively marginal to money, how would they be stopped?
Why do so many 'small press' books in the US have ISBNs?  Doesn't everyone
quite plainly WANT to be less benooked?  Follow your own logic..

I haven't been following the discussion about Barnes & Noble and the
demise of the small independent bookstore; I've been too busy running my
own bookstore here in Washington DC, the country's county seat of
corruption. No one should equate what Barnes & Noble or what any other
corporation does with the natural order. Here in Washington we stay
acutely aware of how the Big Boys manipulate the system to their
advantage. They write legislation that is favorable to their industry.
They litter my pseudo-intellectual landscape with think-tank whores
whose sole purpose is to influence legislation and sell anti-democratic
ideas to a gullible populace e.g. the privatization of Social Security
or the natural efficacy of markets. They offer political appointees,
regulators, elected officials and members of the military lucrative
positions, de facto bribes, for supporting government spending for their
particular products and services. They have off-shore bank accounts that
are beyond U.S.tax laws. They run their operations in the red, borrowing
from cronies in the banking industry, in order to drive weaker
competitors out of business. Then they cut back services and employees
in the name of greater efficiency. I could go on, but the point is if it
was just a matter of competition, especially with books, knowledge
should be king. Further, with books a knowledge of their content can be
detrimental to your business if you let that knowledge cloud your
'business sense' as I so often do. Indeed, books like any other
commodity is subject to market forces. But with outfits like Barnes &
Noble and Borders you reach a new threshold where capital concerns
eliminate all others. You may have your backlist today but what about
when all the independents have been squeezed out. My shop is used and
out-of-print. Norman Kemp Smith's Commentary on Critique of Pure Reason
is Out-Of-Print! That's the market at work. A few years ago before the
new edition of Yeat's collected poetry had been published, MacMillan
almost dropped the title from its list because their computerized sales
system showed that not enough copies had been sold that year to justify
continuing publication. A junior editor perusing the print-out
discovered this abomination and the Yeat's title was restored. This is
what we are moving toward. The price I pay daily for rescuing some of
the best our culture and other cultures have produced is eighty hour
work weeks, near poverty, and the ridicule and derision of a society
that largely because of material excess has discarded its instinct and
empathetic regard for life.---Carlo Parcelli

If the big companies decided to give local managers local control and let a
thousand thousand small publishers bloom, who would complain?  But Borders
and B&N don't do that.  They do something much more subtle, picking up a
small number of small presses that have shown some base of loyal readers,
but not encouraging others.  If you go to the Barnes and Noble in the Plaza
in Kansas City you might get all excited because as a matter of course they
do carry, say, books by Susan Howe.  But if you look closely at the
publisher you'll discover that what most of us consider interesting books
on their shelves are coming from a very small number of presses, most of
them university presses.  Other presses need not apply.

They also put pressure on publishers to cut them deals.  Marginal presses
can't do that.

I have also known them to tell people that in-print books from publishers
not on their master list were out of print and could not be ordered.  I
tend not to believe in conspiracy theories, so suspect this might just be
incompetent local staff.

Hi, Daniel:

I wholly understand your concern not to be misinterpreted. Anyway, I did quote
you, & others can decide for themselves whether or not an accusation of
paranoia seemed likely in your words. I apologize for my own response if you
indeed didn't mean it.

I'll quote you again: "we now know that the person who IS in on the secret
ploys of the big bookstores is 'the proprietor of one of the independent
bookstores in
harvard square.'" I feel compelled to remind you that many, many others are on
to them as well. Just because you don't have firsthand knowledge of this
doesn't mean it's not true, & I'm at a loss to understand why you're so
dismissive of those of us who've looked into the subject at any length. If
"dismissive" is a misinterpretation of your words, I apologize again. That's
how you're coming across. To me, at least.

As Jonathan Mayhew points out, some chain-bookstore practices ultimately have
consequences further-reaching than who will make money from what. I don't think
he'd be surprised to hear that the senate subcommittee hearings I mentioned
earlier were undertaken to determine whether or not chain bookstores were in
collusion with the largest NYC presses as regards pricing and returns policies
that, in effect, destroyed chances for smaller publishers to participate. The
hearings were labeled "anti-trust" hearings. Again, some understanding of how
monopolies are created & maintained in this culture, and what the consequences
tend to be, is necessary, I think, in being able to determine the value of
resistance. Not to mention specific options open to those genuinely wanting to
resist.

To offer one answer Katy's question here: "why are these [independent] owners
any 'nicer' than other owners?" -- the point isn't niceness, but diversity.
Again, chain bookstores, in proven collaboration with the larger presses, have
different, and much more rigid book-buying policies than independent
bookstores. B&N's return policy alone has really hurt Coffee House Press (one
of the larger nonprofits in the country), to the point where they were--at the
time I worked there, four years ago or so--reconsidering dealing with the
chains at all. And CHP has an annual budget of over a million dollars a year
(or did then).

Long ago on this list, I posted a sort of mini-history of Bookslinger's demise
. . . in great part the result of Consortium's business practices. I won't
repost that here, but you can find it, early 95, in the archives, if you're at
all interested in this sort of thing. Bookslinger, by the way, was comparable
to SPD. Consortium isn't.

I'm not angry with you, Daniel, and I hope that I'm not coming across that way.
But I have to say, I'm surprised--having seen you read recently at Zinc--that
someone as dedicated to Olson's art as you are (or seemed to be, to me) is
unsympathetic to  some of the more general social concerns addressed in his
_Maximus Poems_.

Anyway . . . my dimes have been spent, too . . . I'm glad to see others with
some experience/knowledge w/respect to this subject piping in . . . people DO
care about this, Daniel . . .

Yours,

Gary

As a publisher my experience with the chains has been marginal--mostly
special orders and occasional large orders, almost entirely returned, of
books by readers at a given store. My understanding is that they operate by
assigning a value per inch or foot of shelf space--the given space must
produce x amount of sales per unit of time, otherwise the stock is
reshuffled. This requires a lot of traffic, which in turn requires a
high-rent loaction, which in turn requires optimum sales per shelf unit,
etc. It does work within their criteria--they make a lot of money. So
they're not going to carry a lot of my books.
The system also requires that customers not linger--that slows the traffic.
Poetry customers linger--we taste a lot before we decide.
A low-traffic indie, which provides the time to linger, usually has a lower
profit-per-shelf-unit expectation, so books that don't sell can stay on the
shelves longer. On the down side, they rarely buy more than one or two
copies, they often pay grudgingly, and when they agree to take a book from
a small press publisher it's usually in a face-to-face encounter in which
this publisher, at least, is made to feel like a pauper at the gate, hat in
hand. Labor-intensive and unrewarding. And the books usually sit on the
shelves until they are covered with dust or dog-eared beyond recognition.
And what are we talking about nation-wide, 40 stores?
Mailorder can sell books, but you can't browse, which means only books
already known to the reader get ordered. Hard to make a surprise discovery
at Amazon.com. Witness my recent offering of half-priced copies of two
Junction titles to the list. Only a very few ordered (thank you), even at
give-away prices.
I sell, one way or another, a fair number of books to individuals, but
library sales via wholesalers are what keep this press afloat, and I do
hope those copies get read. Wholesalers, like bookstores, require ISBNs
(and barcodes), as do the major journals that review books for the library
trade. That's why we have ISBNs.

I think Gary Sullivan might have given me credit for insights made by
others; I have relatively little expertise in this question compared to
those who have more experience working in bookstores and in publishing or
who've followed the news reports more assiduously.

I bought some books from Amazon and they've helpfully suggested other
books that might interest me:

"Hello, Jonathan Mayhew, Based on the items you've bought at Amazon.com we

Could this have anything to do with amazon.com getting information about
lots of small press books that those books were "out of print." Someone
alerted me that a Chax book listed with Amazon had that "out of print"
status according to amazon, when in fact it was most definitely in print. I
checked, and they had virtually all Chax books as out of print, which was
false. I did contact someone there, and they corrected this information
with some help from me. Others have told me that other small press books
with Amazon are falsely listed as out of print. The Amazon person I talked
with said "that was just the information as we received it" -- but didn't
tell me where they received it from. I know that after the information was
corrected, Chax started receiving a few orders from amazin (not a lot),
whereas before that we had received no such orders from them.

Subject:      Nathaniel Mackey reading
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII

In an under-air conditioned room, in front of about 90 people (most of
them decidedly not there to earn extra credit), Nathaniel Mackey read from
3 volumes of his poetry today at UIC. He opened with 3 poems from Eroding
Witness (his Jimi Hendrix poem called "Black Snake Visitation," his
Coltrane poem entitled "Ohnedaruth's Day Begun" (not sure of the spelling
there), and Passing Through, dedicated to the Ghanian scholar Ivan Van
Sertima). These are poems that at times can be difficult to get off the
page, but NM offered enough background to give attentive listeners
something to latch on to (between that, and the fact he has one of the
greatest reading voices I ever heard, he did a great job holding the
audience in what could have been sleep-inducing conditions). Mackey then
moved on to work from School of Udhra, including "Amma Seru's Hammer's
Heated Fall," (dedicated to the sculptor Ed Love. And I didn't know this,
but Amma Seru is a blacksmith figure from Dogon Mythology) and "Slipped
Quadrant."  Mackey closed with three parts of the _Song of the
Andoumboulou_ (18, 19,20), which will be in the forthcoming _Whatsaid
Serif_.  I knew that the "Andoumboulou" refers to a funeral song of the
Dogon, but I didn't know that, as Mackey pointed out that he just learned,
Dogon lore sees the Andoumboulou as earlier versions of humanity that just
didn't work out, sort of like "first drafts" of us, in Dogon cosmology.
He also pointed out that the "Whatsaid" refers to a figure called the
Whatsayer, whose job is to interrupt the story teller by asking questions,
interrupting, heckling, or as Mackey put it, "to roughen the weave of the
story." (especially interesting in light of Tom Becket's questions awhile
back about "stoppage" in poetry). These poems, too, rocked.
        After reading for about an hour in a stuffy room, Mackey very
generously took questions from the audience for 30 additional minutes.
Among the many highlights was a response to some very ParisReview-type
questions: when asked if he envisioned a particular response in his
audience -- say an intellectual response or a particular political act,
etc -- when he writes, NM said no, that as a poet he is the "instigator of
meaning" and then proceeded to tell of some of the responses he gets via
letters, including two ARCHITECTS(!) who have found inspiration in his
work. NM pointed out that, if he had set out w/ a pre-established audience
response in his mind, there's no way he would ever be surprised like he is
in such cases.
        Tomorrow, NM will lecture here on HD's influence, which I won't
post about unless he goes over different ground than he did when Maria
heard him two weeks ago. By the way, Whatsaid Serif will be published by
City Lights, and should be out in June.
        So if you're in Chicago, and you didn't come to UIC, catch Mackey
tomorrow at Columbia College on Michigan Avenue.

I agree with you fully about the plight of the small book seller, and in
fact the hopeless plight of the small business entrepreneur, who finds
he/she must become a bigger and bigger business simply to survive as a
business, with less and less hope of making what can be deemed a livelihood.
The economics, and the tendency towards higher and higher costs applied to
cost of doing business in that mode, are very complicated. Beyond the scope
and subject of this listserv.

Disagree most strongly about the latter part as to "instinct and empathic".

The latter "instinct" does not exist anywhere in nature. Nature is brutal.
When human beings sink down too near to their natural origins they become
brutal. They become the same as the beasts.

That is what separates human beings from beasts. The faculty of reason and
the ability to learn what potentiallty distinguishes them from the absolute
natural violence that they spring from. Empathy is a combination of emotion
and reason. Without the ability to reason there is no empathy. (I do not mean
the ability to simply find causal connections, reasons, in explication of
events. I mean the whole complexity of cognitive processes that human beings
are potentially capable of. That is "Reason" rather than only "reasons".

Human beings can descend down to behaving the same as insects do towards one
another. If you have ever observed, closely, and objectively, enough, with
enough detachement,...then you know. Compare the evolution of warfare, and
its mechanisms, to the development/evolution of insect life and its natural
instincts and machinations and you will quickly understand how, for instance,
Nazi Germany (for example) descended down to the level of insect life,
rather than ascending to the "ubermensch" (above-man).

I think it would do well to some to read more William Seward Burroughs. The
insect and the human are a constant theme. I do not know if he ever alluded
to the historical instance of Nazi Germany, but that isn't the point I am
making.

Actually, to intrude a little dark wit into this apparently stray from the
backchannels conversation....

...the phrase that used to plague would be writers, allegedly from Uncle Sam
originations was.....

    "Anything you write can and will be used against you in a
         court of anything at all."

There are variants, but that particular variant is the most obvious as to
its intentions. Of course, it must certainly come from those who believe
that anything that a writer writes is not a true and lordly writ, but is
in some ways or others "twisted" use of the languish....I mean...language.

Ah well, we cannot ever be write, or is it rite, promptly having at that
very moment to avoid any Freemasons, so we might as well ex-press what
we have on our mineds....I mean...minds....

re this bookstore thread:

two principles of economics are involved, one is "Hoteling's paradox"
which says that sellers always aim for the center of the market,
geographically and otherwise, in order to reach the largest number of
buyers.

second principle is from Maoist critique of capitalism: big fish eat the
little fish and the little fish eat the shrimps.

however, when I returned to the U.S. after living overseas for seven
years I was appalled at the poor selection of poetry & other literature
at most of the bookstores in the DC area.  (this is 1992 we are talking
about)  one decent independent store near where I lived was going out of
business slowly and had no new stock.  the main local chain in dc, which
had at earlier times been pretty good, had next to nothing.  the main
local discount chain had less than nothing.  there were two small
independent bookstores with excellent poetry stock (Rod Smith knows which
ones they were) but I didn't find them immediately, one has since gone
out of business and I think in fact the stock from one moved to the
other.

however I remember the first time I went to borders, again in 1992 (or
early '93) and was amazed to find so much stuff, including poetry.

I don't doubt that the big superstores want to put the small stores out
of business, but I don't understand the logic that the big stores will no
longer stock the poetry, cultural studies, etc, that they now stock once
the independents are out of business.  they still have all that shelf
space to fill and inch for inch there is not such a high cost in keeping
it on the shelf, at least until it sells.  (they may not reorder that
title, its true, but will the title still be available to be reordered
anyway?)  admittedly, I have been outside of the U.S. again for three
years and don't know what has happened in the interval, certainly the
megastore chains have a bigger presence now than five years ago when they
were first coming in.

I can understand privileging the petit bourgeois small proprietor in this
discourse, over the bureaucratic large scale corporate entity, but that's
all we're really talking about.  neither of them are in business for
their health, right?

A friend opened a tiny progressive/gay/lesbian bookstore.  Having
witnessed it first as a dream, the barn-raising style of its beginnings,
the effort put toward the first bank loan approved so the stock could be
broadened, and the decline when Barnes & Noble came to the neighborhood,
though the problem may also be the lesbian bar next door--those girls
were more committed to spending money on social drinking than in going
home with the latest Dorothy Allison or they want to apply their 20%
Barnes and Noble discount to the next pint of beer.
        Anyway, it never struck me she expected to get rich from this
but alas, some idealistic dream to live surrounded by books and in the
hood.  Carlo Parcelli's post is eloquent enough here.  I am romantic
about Adrienne Monier's project and I do see this as political, not at
all unrelated to Daniel Bouchard's work with evicted tenants, because it
is how things are spread around.  At some point we must figure out a way
to get together and refuse to pay higher and higher rent for smaller and
smaller dumps.  And we must refuse to give more and more of our money to
fewer and fewer giants.  I have just as much trouble as the next person.
Everytime I buy underwear and look for the union label and can't find it
and buy the underwear anyway because who has the time to search for a
union label.  I find it really insulting that they write 'assembled in
Dominican Republic' like we wouldn't want our panties 'made' there or
suggesting that parts are shipped from the U.S. so perhaps it's almost
like being made in the U.S.  So I was buying Oscar de la Renta bras for
a while just cause they had the union label but they no longer exist,
can't compete I bet with the cheaper labor.

The ABA via several bookstores in California is suing Barnes and Noble.
 There is an article about it on their website:
http://www.bookweb.org/special/19980318/story.html

one little quote:
 "According to figures from the NPD Group and the ABA research
department, the independent booksellers' market share of
adult titles fell 42 percent between 1991 and 1996, from 32 percent to
18.6 percent."

Call me spooked or woowoo but I wont even enter a Barnes and Noble, the
energy just reeks like hell.  And the coffee upstairs reeks of unsavory
practices on the backs of South American coffee growers.

For a while I was ordering from Amazon but now I'm trying to go more
directly to distributors like Small Press.  I was thinking about ways we
as readers could work with our small bookstores to get our need better
met.  Any ideas? One thing that worked really well for the Left Hand
Book Collective this year was soliciting left profs at CU to have us
sell their books.

Pat Pritchett--I think the Left Hand is better than Boulder Bookstore
about individual orders--is my own experience.

I worked in independent bookstores for twelve years, four of those years at an
independent Harvard Square bookstore: Reading International. I had carte
blanche for ordering for the poetry section, and had a blast: my manager didn't
even point out the obvious--that the Grolier was right up the street. Reading
International was a union shop, as was Harvard Bookstore, so the employees had
been there a long time--usually ten or more years--and made a decent living.
Most of us were pre-computerized bookstore people, so we had to know our
specific sections pretty well.

I don't think the indies are going down due to conspiracies: it's mostly a case
of the computerized inventory system making bookstore owners feel comfortable
hiring people who really know very little about books & publishing & paying
them very poorly--they figure any idiot can read a computer screen that says:
YES we have the book, or NO we don't. AS far as special ordering goes, it's a
bit labor intensive, and you pay shipping on an individual book, often get less
of a discount from the publisher, and basically no one wants to bother.

The bookstore business used to be a trade. Now it's just a crappy job that no
one really wants to have. The profit margins are poor, so intense volume is the
only way for an owner to get rich on it.

All right, all right, here I am with some Zinc Bar readings ...

Although belatedly, as I've been away from the computer for a few days.

Anyway, for the next couple of weeks (don't have full list in front of =
me, sorry)

April 19th: Simon Pettet and Dawn someone (sorry again)

April 26th: Kristen Prevallet and Ted Greenwald.

I'll post May as soon as I filch the list from work.

Also, I remember someone asking about HERE, well HERE are the readings:

April 18th: Julie Patton, Chris Mann

and after that reading, same day...
 Poetry Reading in Praise of Forces of Nature, Space Untitled, 137 =
Greene Street, 6-8 pm, featuring: me, Ted Greenwald, Carter Ratcliff, =
Vincent Katz, Star Black and Ilka Scobie.

April 25th: Elizabeth Walder and (change in schedule) Camille Roy

May 2nd: Bruce Andrews, Dan Farrell

at the Poetry Project tonight)

May 16th: Deirdre Kovac, Rod Smith

May 23rd: Jean Day, Andrew Levy

and then zip until fall.

And finally, regarding used bookstores, my personal favorite is the =
Mercer Street Bookshop on Mercer between Houston and Bleecker. =
Otherwise, pickings are slim in Megastore-dominated NYC.

Best recent example we have available. Cannot think of a better one.

However, I think the allusion to Burroughs and his use of insect metaphors
was more interesting. The part insect, part human. The thing transformed to
insect.
What is the causality that transforms in that manner, and manifests in that
manner, becomes so very intriguing.

As a very basic rule of thumb, if the poem is lineated (linebreaks matter,
are deliberate, etc.), then groups of lines are stanzas.  If the poem is
unlineated, then the blocks are paragraphs.  There are probably exceptions,
of course.

I think Rachel Levitsky's last post addressed this pretty well.  Some
supposedly leftist "discourse" is just as abstracted and distanced from
local realities on an intellectual level as big corporations are on
a political-economic level.  (Follow that?)  All politics is local and
utopia will be local as well, when we learn how to get along without
letting greed and profit sharks rule the roost.  Where is the happy
mean between vegetable socialism and ruthless greed - a healthy respect
for money and enterprise and careful business practices along with an
independence from totalizing effects of mega-capitalism?  It's gotta
be out there somewhere in the 8th dimension...  is it possible that
poetry & literature carry the germs of that consciousness within the
shark-body of the chains?  Not necessarily (most of it is pure sell-
yourself).  But there is something to be said for INDEPENDENCE,
DIVERSITY, COMMUNITY-BASED ENTERPRISE that that reducto-marxism
quoted above tends to miss. In the ghetto grows the rose.  - Henry Gould

Essentially, yes, that makes perfect sense. The only real difficulties tend
to be education of those you desire to be careful, and regulation such that
they are not hog-tied and unable to function in the real world beyond
dealing with various departments, agencies, beaurocracies, administrations,
at so many levels, in so many areas, in such complicated legislation and
formalities, that it takes a skyscraper full of legal eagles, not the
average legal beagle (such as the average entrepreneur MIGHT be able to call
on (on rare occassion of desparate and dire need) to unravel, deal with, and
otherwise survive it. Not to mention the army of accountants.

This is another reason why multi-branch chains tend to win in terms of their
being a truly solid investment option as opposed to independent small busienss.
It is impossible for the average person, even the exceptional person, to
wade through the quagmire. It is impossible to do anything else than wade
through the quagmire, and then it is not really a "living", is it ?

>Not necessarily (most of it is pure sell-yourself).

No, it is not. No one in fact can self sell, though some _believe_ differently.

This is, in most ways, the world of the "middle man".

To do otherwise than to use the middle man, the agent, the promoter, the
distributor, the representative, the professional salesman, is to fail to
recognize the necessity, in this culture, of a messiah. The whole tradition,
even in its purely secular side, is build wholly of and from that concept.

It is a mediated culture. The immediate relation is most often rendered
impossible, ineffective, disempowered, to preserve the role of the middle-man.
Of course not everyone can be a middle-man, because if everyone could then
everyone would be. Effective representation is the carefully guarded
preserve of the few, and not of the many. That is how they keep themselves
in business, and are kept in business by those who support the system in
terms of status-quo. In turn the middle-man works for those who support the
concept and empower it, as well as for whom the middle-man represents as
producer of product. That relation maintains the middle-man's borrowed power.

In essence the messianic "license" to effectively sell, represent, promote,
is granted by a power-elite.

Surely you know that the Marxists recognized this as being a fact ?

That does not necessarily make it an "evil". I am not value judging the
concept, but only stating that that is how it is.  Some people have the
illusion that they are their own benefactors, their own best promoters,
their own sales people, but in every instance I know of, they are deluded
and nothing of the sort. They are always promoted, represented, made
effective, by someone else.
That they do not recognize who their messiah is does not obviate the fact
that there is one. They do not have to recognize that fact, but only to live it.

        There are many simple ways to do collage--
        for example--just pick up anything close to hand, give a time
limit and quickly cut it up and rearrange
        tear/scissors & glue
        for this you could study for example books like The Third Mind by
William S Burroughs--as well his various interviews in say The Job-
        or works by Brion Gysin--who influenced Burroughs-
        also--another way to think of it is as editing, following examples
from comic books and movies--just make or take a series of words and
images, cut up and arrange in sequences, series--make little books or
zines as "journals"
        collect materials from hither and yon and keep by bedside--good
time to work is first thing in morning, when dreams collide with waking
and before dross of the day has settled in on "conscious" mind--
        materials can be anything--scraps from street, old magazines,
comic books books (dictionaries and encylopedias work great)--
        can use paint and ink on top of junk found in street as stencils
and stamp into the pages with the images and or words--
        work fast, practise daily and each maker will find that over time
their own themes obsessions images begin to move, repeat, play and form
rhythms and patterns--
        many books in libraries students wd like--on collage, Dada
etc--Burroughs is cool with lot of kids--
        also check out the book on comics/art that Scott MeCloud
did--great book!
        lot of written poetry work is collage--in "modern poetry"--check
out Pound, Paul Metcalf, Olson--
        (even old USA trilogy by John Dos Passos)
        for movies a good one to check out for some great ideas is (you
can get on video) for eample Dziga Vertov's MAN WITH A MOVIE CAMERA
        all best --& a great time!

Thanks to everyone who made suggestions. I had no idea how little I knew
about the great stuff that was out there. I'd like to single people out,
but I can't find the list on which I kept names. Still, my wife now has
plenty of material to chose from.  Thank you all again.

Ah exhaustion, seize of the engine.  I think: someday the letters stop.
Then it is the concrete interval between letters, velvet of time, the page
has been, now the fog rolling in off the lake.  I think: one day I live
again, as, if, not on nails.  But this is not to betray you.

I am this way not out of *compulsion* but of *inner necessity* --

It is a *temperment*.

Then some will claim that my temperment tends toward *caprice*.  But is it
not a *moral* relationship, that to one's own temperment?  And yet I can
not say to you: I am 'naive', naive, as you would write.  Naive never lets
you write naive:  why you face up to your own lack in the face of genius.
(Indeed, here I am like you.)

I am 'naive' (then love me) --

For is it not the apostrophe which chases away the last shreds of naivete:
fatality of that canny decorative typography....

Schiller, this explication of those tempers of art, your dissection of my
economies, my psychological trade-routes: it is so much unbroken rail, the
shuddering planes, thousand miles of night.

I can not even say it.

In the dark you can see the lines of my back.  I think of such things, in
the dark.  It is something that nature would allow: it would spring out of
the lake-air.  In such a climate the knife-edge of shame crumbles.  There
are other things the centuries maintain; those are the things which
interest me.  The dyes which persist.  For example, blue.  And red.

The dyes are not ghosts, they are not writing which furrows the surface,
they are not painting.  You understand: I dream of writing which dyes,
sinks into the cloth, marking beyond question and irrevocably.  Then I
could not write words.

You might understand this.

Just dropping in on this, but, sure, it's not that the owners of small
stores *have* to be nicer, it's just that sometimes they *are*.  Because
they got into the biz in the first place for the love of books, and maybe
even more generally for a love of "art."  Lots of stuff bound up together
here.  I know thinking back to that old now-closing fave of mine in C-ville,
Williams Corner, that in addition to having a great poetry section Mike
Williams also employed a fair number of poor young potes and grad students
over the years, and sold books by local writers, and sponsored readings
etc etc.  That can all add up to a contribution to the community in a way
that B&N or Borders just will not....or will only perhaps simulate for as
long as it is profitable or useful to them...certainly not out of love.

At least small book shop proprietors are _REAL_ people.

Not the zombified staff of a large chain who live in paranoia of
those dreaded "mystery shoppers" hired by the store management.

I hate dealing with large chain stores. The simulated people androids
that staff them are the main reason.

My dear Rachel - I stand properly chastised!

In other news: David Bromige, Cole Swensen and Anselm Hollo read last night
to a crowd of 60+ poetry lovers at Left Hand Books, not Barnes & Noble. It
was SRO and a bravura reading by all. Even the fire marshall who descended
on us for code violations was stilled in his zeal by the Orphean strains of
"T as in Tether." I hope to assemble a more coherent report later but right
now I'm hungover and short of sleep. Bromige seemed to spend most of his
time flirting with my wife. But I'm not entirely sure since I was so
preoccupied flirting with his.

This is, in most ways, the world of the "middle man".
To do otherwise than to use the middle man, the agent, the promoter, the
distributor, the representative, the professional salesman, is to fail
to recognize the necessity, in this culture, of a messiah. The whole
tradition,even in its purely secular side, is build wholly of and from
that concept.

It is a mediated culture. The immediate relation is most often rendered
impossible, ineffective, disempowered, to preserve the role of the
middle-man. Of course not everyone can be a middle-man, because if
everyone could then everyone would be. Effective representation is the
carefully guarded preserve of the few, and not of the many. That is how
they keep themselves in business, and are kept in business by those who
support the system in terms of status-quo. In turn the middle-man works
for those who support the concept and empower it, as well as for whom
the middle-man represents as producer of product. That relation
maintains the middle-man's borrowed power.

In essence the messianic "license" to effectively sell, represent,
promote,
is granted by a power-elite.

Surely you know that the Marxists recognized this as being a fact ?

That does not necessarily make it an "evil". I am not value judging the
concept, but only stating that that is how it is.  Some people have the
illusion that they are their own benefactors, their own best promoters,
their own sales people, but in every instance I know of, they are
deluded
and nothing of the sort. They are always promoted, represented, made
effective, by someone else.
That they do not recognize who their messiah is does not obviate the
fact
that there is one. They do not have to recognize that fact, but only to
live it.


--  Thanks Morph! This is perfectly stated, and a good thing for us to
remember as we apply for our grants, send to mags etc etc

Inotherwords:  the chains demand special deals for themselves

Tto me that does seem ludicrous. (Though I strongly empathize with those making
suit against the giants, in an attempt to survive as small independents.)

The fact is that the buying power of a larger customer has always favoured
such customers in every kind of business. The more you buy the bigger the
discount and the more favourable the terms of sale are from the supplier.

The biggest customers have _always_ been given the biggest discounts.

The biggest customers in every kind of business have also enjoyed special
terms not available to lesser entities.

Some small customers, in some areas of business (such as manufacturing)
have to pay list price for one off or for buying a few items, to their
supplier, when larger competitors get substantial discounts from the same
supplier. This, believe it or not, is common practice. (I speak from direct
fact and not from the fiction section. It is perfectly acceptable business
practice.)

Their larger competitor, who buys either a dozen or a hundred or spends
a certain dollar amount per year with the supplier, gets a discount, of
anywhere from as little as 5 to as much as 60 percent or more. There are no
limits to that discounting. It could be any amount that the supplier chooses.
That is the essence of "free enterprise". Each business sets its own prices
and decides what its discounting is to be. Some of that discounting in
relation to list price is unbelievable in terms of how wide the spread of
values is.

The only pertinent factor beyond that fact is that a supplier could get into
trouble if they are not equitable. For instance if Joe's Garage buys 100,000
in oil and gas and Fritz's Auto buys 100,000 in the same product mix, for
the exactly same kinds of oil and gas, then Luigi's Garage Supply Inc. will
likely have to give Joe and Fritz the same 20% off for being a customer of
100,000 or up. Note same product mix. Particularly if that offer of discount
is part of a price list. If one buys more oil and less gas this factor might
not apply. Product mix and volume of sales in dollars both usually matter as
profit margins vary as to mix.

Also, it is not uncommon for a supplier to make a special offer to a
customer who buys more than the others, and is beyond the levels specified
in a list.
It is justified on reduced margin, but maintenance of total profits, due to
the volume of business provided by that specific customer. It adds another
pricing tier to the list, albeit an unwritten on. This sometimes attracts
another large customer to the same supplier. Word gets around.

Some suppliers discount different products differently, but also expect a
certain total dollar volume based on last year's purchases, or sometimes
allow the discount when a certain total is achieved by a new customer. A few
even credit it. The practices are very, very, variable. Again, "free
enterprise".

Likely, IMHO, for a small independent to go up against the giants of
standardized fair play towards competition and suppliers, ie. ethical
equitable practices, is a suicide leap.........

That skyscraper full of legal eagles again will eat the independent alive.

The independent cannot expect to find a David to slingshot that Goliath.

I recently came across a slightly water-warped & somewhat mildewed copy of
_Desert Expansion Texts, Book 2_ by Dain Olsen (Penumbra Press 1985), and it
followed me home. The text is not what I'd call innovative, but still
surrealistic enough to be interesting. And the drawings are wonderfully
bizarre. Can anyone tell me more about Dain Olsen and/or Penumbra Press?

Really, how pessimistic and upholding of the status quo (its always been
done this way, it always will be done this way) you sounded in your last
post.

Some other ways of looking at the law suits:

1)you never know until you try
2)by any means necessary
3)perhaps there is evidence that stated policies of distribution
discounts are in fact violated, I dunno but all these independent
bookish sorts are probably not stupid and suicidal
4)publicity will favor the little guy in this case
5)you gave us that brilliant schpiel on the middle man, well, why not
challenge how this is being mediated, at least rhetorically?  This
"culture"'s epic is being penned in the courts.
6)Legal means should not be the only means of challenging those big
smelly giants but the probable means for a network of indies.  Its up to
us patrons to go in and slip "don't buy from Barnes & Noble" sheets into
their books.
7)Not that this is my cause, but I never thought, nor did most, that the
legal challenges to cigarette giants would ever get so far as they've
gotten.  I think the logic of most of these lawsuits is flawed, but I
like very much that the free range power of the corporation is being
fucked with.  Marketing strategies become more transparent--thus
consumers have more choice as to whether their going to buy into it.
(Though one need only open a _Rolling Stone_ magazine to see jazz greats
modeling for designers, to feel like everyone's getting in on the
corporate thang)
8)I'm also thinking of the Christic (sp?) Institute's legal challenge to
the CIA, I hope I'm not getting this wrong, which was the means by which
many people learned of it's involvement in the drug trade.  They never
won that case but the newspaper coverage of something that would have
otherwise been ignored was absolutely worth their work.

>1)you never know until you try

Sound Reasoning will often tell you, long before you leap into the abyss.
Such things are often launched not in the spirit of Reasoning, but from
a basis of emotion. The latter is how many a small business has perished
to doing no good other than increasing its overhead to where it cannot carry
it anymore, in addition to its other sometimes overwhelming challenges.

>2)by any means necessary

Decidedly uncivilized. The emphasis on _any_.

Tooth and claw, kill or be killed, etc., is not civilized.

>3)perhaps there is evidence that stated policies of distribution
>discounts are in fact violated, I dunno but all these independent
>bookish sorts are probably not stupid and suicidal

Perhaps, but unlikely. Even then, it would be on very weak grounds, as
a supplier has the right to amend any list of prices and discounts, such
that a customer gets a special discount and terms, upon some argument or
other. For instance, projected business volume rather than historic actual.
A rationale is a rationale, for exceptions.....and is quite a common
business practice.

Besides, those giants are the biggest customers. No argument possible.
Therefore, within the capitalist system, the largest get the best terms
and the best prices. There is no socialism from suppliers to smaller
businesses, and no commissary from where they can request their needs
according to their abilities to pay. System simply does not work that way.

The small dealers commisar has not been apppointed yet. The commissary
has not been built yet....

>4)publicity will favor the little guy in this case

Not necessarily. Spin is owned by the large, not the small.
Spin doctors do not work solely for politicians. They work for corporations.

>5)you gave us that brilliant schpiel on the middle man, well, why not
>challenge how this is being mediated, at least rhetorically?  This
>"culture"'s epic is being penned in the courts.

The small cannot afford to be there, in most instances.
I do agree that some system of mediation, rather than litigation,
for commercial disagreements is necessary. I do believe that some states
have a "commercial code" allowing such things as mediation. Pennsylvania, is
one of those, but I do not know if mediation would apply in the instance we
are discussing.

The costs of mediation are not the same as litigation. The lesser entity
then has a chance.....of survival, even if the loser on the particular question.
The loser has no chance in litigation because a counter suit is inevitable
and that would involve damages (bad publicity, loss of business) and the
huge costs incurred by the larger entity. The can sue for everything they
spent, and can spend essentially as much as they choose.

>6)Legal means should not be the only means of challenging those big
>smelly giants but the probable means for a network of indies.  Its up to

They are not necessarily "big smelly giants", but they are losing some
consumers because they are not always passing on a true cost saving to the
customer. They are simply putting more profits into their own pockets. That
does cause intelligent consumers to go elsewhere. Then they are likely to
drop their prices somewhat to regain those consumers..... Another fact of
business.

At the risk of sounding too flippant...poetry books will have to have
warning labels on them saying "The Psychiatrist General has determined that
Reading this material may be hazardous to your psyche"..... Sure....some
would go for that.

Well, when the poetry giants are flooding the market with dangerous poetry
publications, perhaps a lobby group, a class action suit, etc., will have
some effect on stopping that growing flood of subversive evil verse....
before it destroys the whole country and damages the well being of millions.....

That is funny. The truth will set them free.... <laughing>

Buy your own printing press, set type, and print them in your basement,

rachael, you're certainly right on about the Christic Institute's attempt to
expose a continuing criminal operation/conspiracy perpetrated by former &
current cia operatives.  not only does it document the drug trafficking
sanctioned by these operatives, the complaint also points out the earlier
activities of these same operatives in southeast asia, the middle east, africa
and central america -- very bloody activities.  when carlo parcelli, rosalie
gancie and myself were producing Print News Report, a weekly alternative news
program on public access chanels (washington, dc & northern va) we read the
entire complaint, all 300 pages, verbatim. unfortunately the Christic
Institute paid a heavy price for this action; several days before the
complaint was to be heard in the federal courts, judge king dismissed the
complaint and ordered the Christic Institute to pay the legal fees of these
operatives, which totaled more than a million dollars.  unable to do so the
institute went out of existence.

Tto me that does seem ludicrous. (Though I strongly empathize with those making
suit against the giants, in an attempt to survive as small independents.)

The fact is that the buying power of a larger customer has always favoured
such customers in every kind of business. The more you buy the bigger the
discount and the more favourable the terms of sale are from the supplier.

The biggest customers have _always_ been given the biggest discounts.>>

But this seems to do exactly what the monsters want: place literature as
commodity on the same terms as widgets & wadgets. Even if we say there's no
way to save the little stores in this world of social darwinism, it might
pay wo wonder what happens to the small presses where, due to these very
pressures on the big ones, almost the only innovative, etc. writing gets
published. They too are suddenly forced to give discounts they simply cant
handle, & if they dont perhaps they cant sell any books because the
independent stores they depended on for their sales have all been driven
out. Oops. Now Mark seems to be managing with library sales, but still. A
hard road has been made much harder. For whom? For what? At what cost to
culture as a whole (& I speak as someone who very much enjoys various
aspects of popular culture too)?

Maybe the small press world will be an electronic village hidden among the
giant 'trees' of the web/forest? Maybe...(but I still really like going
into a small bookstore & soaking up the ambience of the books I can look
at, check out, etc. not to mention those readings -- like the one Patrick
Pritchettjust reported to us...).

Check out Ron Henry's web lit mag "Aught" at
http://www.geocities.com/SoHo/8789/aught.htm

As far as the "free lunch" goes -- since I used a somewhat dated web
browser on my somewhat dated home computer, I'm incapable of seeing the
banner ads that occasionally pop on GeoCities web pages. Drat.

You can email Ron at eviscerate@geocities.com and ask him more about the
GeoCities experience.

Miracle Fair

The commonplace miracle:
that so many common miracles
take place.

The usual miracle:
invisible dogs barking
in the dead of night

One of many miracles:
a small and airy cloud
is able to upstage the massive
moon

Several miracles in one:
an alder is reflected in the
water
and is reversed from left to
right
and grows from crown to root
and neve hits bottom
though the water isn't deep.

A run-of-the-mill miracle:
winds mild to moderate turning
gusty in storms.

A miracle in the first place:
cows will be cows.

Next but not least:
just this cherry orchard
from just this cherry pit.

A miracle minus top hat and tails:
fluttering white doves

A miracle(what else can you call
    it):
       the sun rose today at three fourteen
      a.m.
and will set tonight at one past eight.

A miracle that's lost on us:
the hand actually has fewer than six
fingers
          but still it's got more than four.

A miracle, just take a look around:
       the inescapable earth.

An extra miracle, extra and
ordinary:
the unthinkable
can be thought

Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

I've only been back receiving poetics messages for a few weeks, and haven't
seen anybody reporting on Tucson activities, so thought I'd summarize.

The POG series which started a year ago with readings and/or talks by David
Bromige, Karen Mac Cormack, Steve McCaffery, Tom Mandel, Bob Perelman, Jim
Waid, Margaret Bailey Doogan,and others -- continued this year with
sometimes monthly and sometimes more-than-monthly readings or presentations
by a mixture of poets, visual artists, video artists, music composers.
These have included Leslie Scalapino, Roberto Tejada, Cynthia Miller,
Robert Hogg, Sheila Murphy, Rae Armantrout, A.C. Huerta, Victor Masayesva,
Tom Raworth, Charles Alexander, Jerome Rothenberg, Alex Garza, Clayton
Eshleman, Michael Davidson, Mei-mei Berssenbrugge, Larry Solomon, Lisa
Cooper, and Lydia Davis (and I'm sure I've left something out).

The latest of these readings were the Michael Davidson one about three
weeks ago, and the Lisa Cooper/Lydia Davis reading one week ago today.

When possible, Chax Press has made chapbooks by visiting and/or local
writers to accompany these events (books by Davis, Cooper, Armantrout,
Raworth/Alexander, one by POG co-founder Tenney Nathanson who read in a
university-sponsored series, and one last spring by Perelman).

The literary readings have been energetically complemented by artistic
presentations in the case of Cynthia Miller (painting), A.C. Huerta
(painting/photography), Alex Garza (sculpture), Larry Solomon
(musician/composer), and Victor Masayesva (video/photography).

The events have included visiting and local artists and writers; they have
also shifted locations purposefully, including events at three locations in
downtown Tucson, on the far west side at Pima Community College, and in
predominantly Hispanic South Tucson. More informal talks in the series have
been at an older stucco former-home which is an annex to the Poetry Center
of the U of Arizona.

Besides POG, which is a collective of about 15 people including Jill
McCartney, Tenney Nathanson, Dan Featherston, Kali Tal, Charles Alexander,
Lisa Bowden (all of those on the organizing committee for the group), and
others; a couple of the events have had co-sponsorship from the Writing
Works/Extended University program at U of Arizona, or from the Poetry
Center at the U of Arizona. The events have also had support from the
Tucson/Pima Arts Council and the Arizona Commission on the Arts. Still,
financially, it's been a struggle in which several people have stuck their
necks and wallets out, and we're counting a lot on an upcoming fundraising
dinner (May 4 -- please send me a direct email if anyone wants more
information about this, wants to come or reserve/buy a seat we can donate
to someone who can't afford it) to help us break even and continue doing
this next year.

The final event in the series this year is Saturday, May 9, at 7pm.
It is a reading by Kevin Killian and Dodie Bellamy,
and a performance by artist Ned Schaper, at the
Mat Bevel Institute, 530 N. Stone Ave., in Tucson.
Free & open to all.

if you're near, please come.

The Little Fish
---------------

The little fish dreamt it was a huge white shark. It imagined its teeth
and jaws powerful. It imagined it was ferocious. It dreamt this many times
and it eventually _believed_ that this was the truth. The little fish then
attacked another fish....and the little fish was immediately eaten. In being
eaten it found its freedom.

That is the end of the story of the little fish.

The little fish perhaps exists somewhere in another parallel universe, in a
kind of afterlife, or perhaps it reincarnated in another time period as a
great white shark. I shall remain agnostic to what happens to fish after
they are eaten.

Now how does that apply to Little Book Shop versus Huge Bookselling Chainstore ?

Big fish eat little fish. Sometimes little fish forget that fact. Then they
are eaten, even faster, than they otherwise would have been.

That is all there is to it.

Just a couple of more notes to round out recent and tonight's Tucson
activities. Yesterday afternoon Robert Kaufmann gave a talk at the U of
Arizona on Adorno and Michael Palmer -- I couldn't be there but would
appreciate a report from anyone who was there.

Last night, Susan Aiken and co-editors of the new book, MAKING WORLD:
Gender, Metaphor, and Materiality, gave a presentation at Antigone Books,
talking about, taking questions and reading from that book which comes out
of a conference here on the topic, really about space and metaphors about
space and how they work, effect us, and otherwise operate. An attempt to
approach the topics cross-discipline, with contributions from art, poetry,
queer theory, Nortena gardening, and more. The book was published by Univ.
of Arizona Press.

And tonight, there's an event sponsored by Kore Press, and I am forwarding
their notice of this event, which appears below:

April 18

A BOOK OPENING for Sylvia Um's THE ROOTED HEART, published by Kore Press
6-8pm at 402 N Main St, the Franklin House.

::::::::::::::::::

I live in the desert where everything
touches the ground
I am
either fluid or menacing
silhouettes strange buds branches
gold-leafed anthropomorphic
forms quiet fracas
I see movement
find the door dear heart take a breath
greater than yours


(from "A schematic drawing of eternal love")

:::::::::::::::::::


Sylvia was a student (of Barbara Cully and Susan Aiken among others--and
Tenney too, I believe she and I were in your American Lit class years ago)
during her undergraduate career in creative and critical writing at the U of
A. She was in her second year of the MFA/poetry program at U of Maryland
when she died of heart failure as a result of treatments for Non-Hodgkins
Lymphoma in November of '96. Her poems will be read by Boyer Rickel and
Barbara Cully. Since Sylvia was an accomplished violinist (playing with AZ
Opera Co and UA Symphony Orchestra) there will be a string quartet
(comprised of musicians from Tucson Symphony and Tucson Chamber Orchestra)
playing from 7-8pm. Music and food and books will follow readings. There
will be several members of Sylvia's family there, a few who will be flying
in from out of state.

Please spread the word and join us if you can.

cheers,
Lisa Bowden
Kore Press


all for now,

Although a micro press publisher as well as a poet, here in Portland (with
great independent bookstores like Powells, Looking Glass & Boradway), i
have an ongoing relationship with one of the local Borders. i should say
that i also consider myself in the progressive-radical range in politics,
as well as a strong union supporter.
but about 3 years ago when the first borders came to town, a person from
the store came up to me at local book fair, where we both had tables (well,
they had several tables, i had a 1/2), and said i'd been pointed out as a
person who has organized readings.
while porland has tons of writers/poets, there arent many venues for
reading--3-5 (changing every couple months) regular open readings;
occasional 1-3 person readings at above mentioned bookstores; & the
ocaisonal traveling poet at one of the local schools. as a reader and
reading organizer i like the 3 at 15 minutes each format.
the readings are generally great, almost always local, averages around 18
people. i continually get flack for working with borders. i figure theyre
the ones giving in this without getting much back (dont know how big a pr
impact these readings, or any local poetry, could have), other than some
stolen books.
readers geta  place to read around triple the standard open reading slot,
get an attentive audience & a small gift certificate. who's co-opting whom.
and relating to anothe entry on this topic, the people i deal with at
borders are nice folks, if not always totally present, but ive never
encountered any rudeness or paranoia.

I should clarify that this lawsuit is brought by the ABA; it is not one
local bookstore against the chains. And it is quite possible that some of
their practices ARE illegal. Antitrust is a quite complicated area of the
law. So I will await the results with a great deal of interest.  It may be
quixotic but I wouldn't term it "ludicrous."

This is a good question which I should, though don't, have a good answer
for. There is little in the letters to suggest that Oppen actively sought
the award (indeed, he seems fairly ambivalent about it). Anyone know who
might have been responsible?

The list of writers who did or did not get Pulitzers is an interesting (or
disheartening) one.  Among the non-winners are: T.S. Eliot, Ezra Pound,
Louis Zukovsky, Langston Hughes, Adrienne Rich, C.K. Williams, Allen
Ginsberg, Robert Creeley, Robert Duncan, Denise Levertov, Mark Strand and
lots of others.  A biography of Louise Bogan has won a Pulitzer, Bogan has
not.  On the other hand such giants as Audrey Wurdemann, Mark Van Doren,
Leonard Bacon, Peter Viereck, & Phyllis McGinley have won (the 20's through
the 40's are particularly lean years as far as good choices made by the
selection committee).  Since 1922, only three African-Americans have won,
no other writers of color have ever won a Pulitzer prize in poetry.  About
77% of the winners are male.

The list of winners is quintessentially mainstream (I think that's the role
of the Pulitzer, to valorize the mainstream).  A number of recipients have
a sort of "wait your turn" feel to them, a twenty to thirty year gap
between achievement and recognition, such as William Carlos Williams in
1963, Wallace Stevens in 1955 and Marianne Moore in 1952.  I think Oppen
winning in 1969 falls under this rule (and also because _Of Being Numerous_
is a darn good book).  My hunch is this wait your turn rule applies to
Charles Wright and most of the other winners in the nineties (such as James
Tate and Philip Levine), much of whose work defined the mainstream of the
seventies.  Creeley, Strand and Rich are probably all due within the next
few years, especially if they release books of collected poems.  And who
knows, maybe the collected poems of Susan Howe or Michael Palmer will win
the Pulitzer in 2010 (which is possible if the mainstream moves in their
direction).  It's a dead certainty however that the collected works of
Robert Hass will win a Pulitzer long before they do.

Personally, I don't lose much sleep over who wins or doesn't win Pulitzer
prizes, any more than I'm going to buy an album because it won a Grammy.

Do we ever really get to say how we shall live ?

Or with whom ?

Now that is an even more painful cry for some freedom _to_
rather than freedom _from_.

It is so easy for others to set one free from almost all that one loves.
Then they call themselves saviours and pat one another upon their shoulders
as though they have all done good.

>you poor sad man loving slavery, resignation, acquiescence, collaboration,

I have met many who are exactly that, and would never want it any different.
It is alright if they are truly happy being that. Then do not disturb them,
is perhaps as good an option as any. As for me, I agree, as to the recoil
in abject horror from such dismal circumstances becoming the given or the
chosen lot in life. Worse if it is the sum and average of the given to.

Then again, some kinds of committed relation, and enthusiastic involvement,
courageous communicative interaction, and collaborations, are to be hoped
for, wanted, sought after, invited, responded to,.... Of course one person's
slavery is in fact another person's freedom, is something we must keep in
mind. That has to do with trading some of one's so called freedom for the
sake of having something else that oneself truly wants to have, even if that
is a loving relationship with a specific other human being. Though that fact
of human existence, of human lives, goes too often without saying. In that
too there is individuality, and potentially, freedom of association, freedom
of communicative interaction, freedom of personal expression, and so the
relation then is in some ways poetic, but invariably something has to be
sacrificed for the sake of that having. Exactly what is sacrificed, and how
much is sacrificed, is variable, as to different situations. That is itself
slavery, and oppressive, only if what is gained is not wanted, or the sacrifice
does not achieve its purpose. Then it is sad sacrifice without celebrations.

Anyway, in my approximately 42nd year, a few years ago I wrote this poem
about something somewhat related to what Billy Little refers to:


WE'VE GOT CLASS
---------------

Today they draped another
pauper's coffin
with a dollar bill,
and there was a silent salute
for another victim
of money forbid.

The wealthy save
their own bodies
for this life,
too often telling the poor
to save their souls
for the afterlife.

Those in between
supposed to make coffins,
print dollar bills,
serve the wealthy,
give to the poor,
and preach sermons.

Thanks Joe for the memory refresher.  Yes I now recall this and that the
case actually planted a seed of hope that some truth might be set on the
record.  The sad outcome doesn't negate the importance of the work.  The
history of struggle is a history of mainly losses and that occasional
win that makes all the rest possible.  The successful, though not
victimless (deaths and beatings of activists, plus three still in
jail--on AMNESTY's prisoner of conscience list) blockage by the people
Tepotzlan, Mexico, 1995, of the construction of a  Jack Nicklaus golf
course that would have destroyed their entire eco system.  Or that
George Oppen did get the Pulitzer.  Or UNITE's exposure of child labor
in a GAP factory in El Salvador.  Or _Howl_.

late to this:

I think someone mentioned warehouses. They are a particular kind of
tyranny. In the calculus of 'production' and 'distribution'. there are
'independent' booksellers that cannot obtain escape velocity from
Ingram, Baker & Taylor, Koen etc. Can't get that publisher discount so
you play the time and usury game with the wholesaler. the chains know
its all about margin not the fucking books yous selling/.

And then the remainder houses play an interesting game. better than
pulping those books I guess. but no returning those remainders. Used
seller marks *up* the 'remainder'.

Amazon has operated at a loss since its inception. What bookseller could
do that? I been  trying to operate at a loss for years. I gave up having
a 'check-book'. But they don't take my loss at the grocery store. Gotta
have the right specie. I don't even try that shit with my landlord.
cash-money.

I-S-B-N

group identifier (i.e., 0=NorthAmerica)-Publisher Identifier (the
so-called 'vendor' number)-title identifer (or 'edition'
identity)-single digit check (an interesting truth value quotient of the
first nine digits).

_Poems for the Millennium II_= 0-5202-0864-1

hAS anyone read 0-226-10672-1? bookstore sagas?

fugitive publication w/o a ISBN often gets a SKU. (a stock keeping unit)

barcodes= three types: UPC-A (12-digit), UPC-E (6-digit) massy-markets
etc. gets E's., and bookland EAN (Not just an Universal Product Code,
but a European Article Number.) Sometimes you get EAN's that are ISBN's
and somethimes yous gets EAN's that more: EAN_8's and EAN_13's. but them
folks ain't americans anyway.

My copy of the video recording of the 1983 George Oppen Tribute arrived here (in Vancouver) last week, after being manhandled and taxed by customs agents.
What a disappointment!  I have the sense that the tape must have cut-out mid-way, after Burton Hatlen.
Neither the recordings played nor the projected images come through.  And it's hard to believe it was only an hour long.
Was anyone here (on this list) there?  What really puzzles me is the emotional ambiguity of the speakers.
There's a weird coldness throughout.

And a related matter.  I've been brooding over a remark in one of Oppen's letters to Robert Duncan.
It's the part where he says, "a landscape appears between our extremes."
Has anyone written on the topic?  Sketched that landscape?

From today's NY Times,
April 20, 1998

Octavio Paz, Mexico's Foremost Poet, Dies at 84

By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS



MEXICO CITY -- Octavio Paz, Mexico's foremost literary figure and the winner
of a Nobel Prize for poetry and essays mapping the labyrinths of the Mexican
mind, has died. He was 84.

Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo announced Paz's death early Monday aboard
his airplane while returning from the Summit of the Americas in Chile,
Mexican news media reported. Zedillo did not give a cause of death or say
when the author died.

Soft-spoken and at times aloof, Paz could be harsh. But he was so precise
and clear that he changed the very way Mexicans express themselves.

Like most Mexican writers, Paz was preoccupied with his country's many
paradoxes and contradictions, the contrasts between its ancient Indian past
and a more recent Spanish heritage. That combination has given rise to a
culture often baffling even to Mexicans.

Even Mexican novelist Carlos Fuentes -- a rival who was one of Paz's
sharpest critics -- conceded that Paz has "forever changed the face of
Mexican literature."

Phones rang unanswered early Monday at Paz's home. At the prestigious
literary magazine Vuelta, which Paz founded, a security guard said he hadn't
heard the news and that no one was available to confirm it.

In 1982, Paz won the Miguel Cervantes Prize, Spain's most prestigious award.
In 1987, he took the T.S. Eliot Award in Chicago. Three years later, he
captured the Nobel Prize for literature.

Paz still is best known for two of his earlier works: the book-length essay
"The Labyrinth of Solitude" and the poem "Sun Stone."

"Labyrinth," published in 1950, described Mexican history as a search --
"for our own selves, deformed or masked by strange institutions," he later
explained to a friend. Many friends stopped speaking to him after the book's
publication.

"Sun Stone" was a harsh critique of what he said was a proud apathy common
among Mexicans. Again, many colleagues reacted with shock, but he picked up
a number of fans as well.

Paz considered poetry the most noble form of literature. "Poetry comes from
the very depths of one's being. It corresponds to experiences that are more
profound" than prose, he told the Spanish literary magazine La Vanguardia in
1987.

"Good prose is invisible," he said. "In poetry, it is not. In a poem, each
word carries weight."

The clarity of his writing inspired many other authors to abandon the
convoluted style long common in Mexico.

Paz was born on March 31, 1914, and grew up on the edge of Mexico City. His
grandfather, a strongly anti-clerical army general, playwright, lawyer,
journalist and sometime revolutionary was an ally of dictator Porfirio Diaz.

Paz's father and namesake, who called himself an anarco-socialist, was
secretary to Emiliano Zapata, a peasant leader of Mexico's 1910-1920
revolution. He later became the diplomatic representative of Zapata's
revolutionary forces in Washington.

When Zapata was murdered in 1919, the Paz family went into brief exile in
Los Angeles.

Back in Mexico, the family fell on hard times. When Paz was a teen-ager, the
family was selling pieces of furniture -- and then the entire house -- to
make ends meet.

Paz published his first poem when he was 16 and his first essay a year
later. He later went to law school at Mexico City's National Autonomous
University, where he joined a Marxist student group. He married a young
writer, Elena Garro, and continued to write poems.

In his early 20s, Paz sent a manuscript to the late Chilean poet Pablo
Neruda, who also would go on to win a Nobel Prize. Neruda was so impressed
with Paz that he wrote a favorable review and suggested the young Mexican go
to a congress of anti-fascist writers in Spain.

In Madrid, Paz met other leftist writers including Andre Malraux, Andre
Gide, Stephen Spender, Antonio Machado and the Soviet propagandist Ilya
Ehrenburg.

Paz stayed in Spain after the congress and joined the leftist-dominated
Republican forces fighting rightist Gen. Francisco Franco. He insisted on
going to the front.

He was sent to a brigade commanded by a Mexican painter David Alfaro
Siqueiros but was never given a rifle and, apparently because some doubted
his leftist credentials, was sent back to Mexico on a vague mission "to
divulge the Spanish cause."

After returning to Mexico City, he later accepted a scholarship to study at
the University of California, Berkeley, and worked in New York translating
Hollywood scripts into Spanish.

A diplomat impressed with his writing in the Mexican magazine Manana offered
him a job as cultural attache to the embassy in Paris in 1946. He went on to
work in the diplomatic service in Japan and the United States.

In 1968, Paz resigned as ambassador to India when troops quashed student
protests in Mexico City's Tlatelolco Square, killing hundreds of people.

"It would be difficult to represent a government under these circumstances,"
he told reporters in New Delhi.

Paz had frequent disagreements with the leftist movement, equating Cuban
President Fidel Castro with right-wing Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet and
calling Nicaragua's leftist Sandinista revolution inconsequential.

But he also was a fierce critic of the government, denouncing the long-
ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party as corrupt and distanced from the
Mexican people.

Paz's marriage to Elena Garro ended angrily after two decades, and in 1966
he married Marie-Jose Tramini.

In 1976, Paz founded Vuelta, which would become one of Latin America's most
prestigious literary magazines. He remained the magazine's director.

Paz lived in a spacious and quiet apartment in a high-rise off one of Mexico
City's busiest avenues, surrounded by thousands of books, mementos, pre-
Columbian ceramics and art objects. Despite the pollution and noise, Paz
refused to seek calmer surroundings in the suburbs.

"I'm Mexican," he said. "I have to live like the Mexicans. I adore my city.
... It was beautiful, and it's going to be beautiful again someday."

I was there.  There were tributes by me, Rachel Blau DuPlessis, Jerome
Rothenberg--all printed in Sagetrieb 3.1 (Spring 1984).  Also, as I
recall by Michael Palmer--anyway I remember him being there.  Perhaps
also by Michael Davidson?  Perhaps some people simply read a poem.  I
don't know about the tone of the occasion.  George came in with Mary,
sat in the back, said nothing.  I think we were all a little uncertain
about what that meant.

I was at the Oppen tribute and spoke; there was a kind of heightened feeling.
Not coldness. Photographs of his poems made into slides (by Charles Amirkanian
I think) were projected on the white wall. Gave it a kind of "meeting" feel
as in Quaker meeting--austere, noble, and poignant. George was pretty far
along with Alzheimer's and he was (probably) not a full listener or full
player at this event. If there's more to say after I keep reading the posts
I will try to say it. Rachel (Blau DuPlessis)

An excruciating british distaste for self promotion.

Shameless.

Necessary.

I am a lecturer on the PERFORMANCE WRITING degree course at Dartington
College of Arts in Devon, UK (Subject Director: Caroline Bergvall). I am
visiting the US to present a performance of The Unspeakable Rooms at the
CLEVELAND PERFORMANCE ART FESTIVAL on 20th May. Rory McDermott
(movement/voice) has devised an event from my text using video, audio tape
and live performance which has been funded by the Arts Council of England
and which will tour in Britain in the Fall.

I am seeking gigs to talk to people who want to know more about the
Performance Writing course, in particular potential undergraduate students,
students considering joining the postgraduate taught courses planned for
1999, students considering applying to do research at Dartington. These
would not be formal information sessions organised by the college, but
chats from my perspective as a member of staff.

I am also seeking poetry reading gigs. I was resident writer at the TATE
GALLERY in ST IVES, CORNWALL (book: Waves on Porthmeor Beach (illustrated
by Sandra Blow RA), a diary of precise descriptions of the waves on the
beach during the six months combined with brief image poems and texts
discussing the process of writing and the nature of the collaboration with
Sandra Blow). My performance piece for 9 voices speaking at the same time
(Voices (for 9)) was performed at the Royal Court in London in 1994. Other
works have been presented at the Tate St Ives, Dartington Arts, Ferens
Gallery in Hull, at the Edinburgh Fringe etc etc. I edit/publish words
worth language arts (writers include: Carlyle Reedy, C Bergvall, J Mac Low,
Mac Wellman, H Chopin, dsh, Ken Edwards, cris cheek, Ernst Jandl etc). I
have edited a section of PERFORMING ARTS JOURNAL on Performance Writing
which should be coming out fairly soon. Publishers: Stride, Spectacular
Diseases, Lobby, Talus, RWC, SubVoicive, Arts Council etc.

I am in the States for only a week or two but I would appreciate any
suggestions/offers. Texts can be emailed to any who want to see the sort of
stuff I write. It ranges from multi-voice work aiming at the condition of
music through the overlapping of many speaking voices and texts without
apparent coherence or meaning to comparatively coherent and comprehensible
poems and patches of prose.

On the CBC as I read: the death of Octavio Paz, another great one gone. At
least, Canada's national radio notices, with a major story on what he meant
& stood for.

Too many such losses these years, yet they are to be expected. I remember
how long ago I first read _Sunstone_, that amazing book (& another New
Directions gift to us all). And the essays, too.

My colleague, Bert Almon, did some translations: here's one:

The birds sing, and sing
not knowing what they sing:
they know only their throats.

is not thought's fetter but its skin.

isn't clear enough for me:
clear water is running water.

Tom -- been hiding in the flmth dump -- distributing my work by the logic
of peepers -- some advices re: new york bookstores -- east village books
(101 st marks) is good for paperback fiction but otherwise overpriced --
tompkins sq books on 7th btw 1 & a a lot better -- dishevel thy hair! --
marcella's right re: mercer, (mercer btw bleecker & houston) worth looking
into for poetry -- bookstore row (18th btw 5 & 6) is kinda thin now but
academy and skyline usually have two or three good books -- some people
like alabaster (around the corner from the strand, 4th ave btw 12 & 13) --
the argosy is worth a touristy trip (58th or 59th betw 5 & park) but not
for recent stuff -- overpriced but terrific is pomander (by appt only) say
hi to Suzanne Zavrian for me if you go uptown -- if you do go uptown
there's Ideal (110 betw bway & amsterdam) and (not used) Labyrinth (112
btw bwy & amst) and there used to be one called No Real Specialty (amst
(btw 118 & 119) but they've probably changed into something less
interesting -- tho I did pick up a Grove Press version of the Sonnets
there for four bucks once -- anyway am jotting preciously because back at
work and needing to work -- more complete listings somewhere at
www.papermag.com (look for the bookstore guide) -- the real place to go
for used books is Cambridge MA (SF CA was about like NY when I stopped
thru -- haven't yet regretted not getting the Muqaddimah) -- and the
noplace to go of course is www.bibliofind.com -- hey drop me a line and
let me know when you're due in town, they let me out for lunch now and
again -- all best -- Jordan

John,

If I understand correctly, you and Yang Lian will be reading
on 21st or 22nd of May in San Diego. Could you possibly come up
to Los Angeles on that Sunday morning. Because then we could have
a late (4:00) salon, and you could meet the sizeable poetic
community of LA. And I'd take you two to dinner...etc. I would
be able to find a bed for the two of you, or put you up at a
local hotel, near my offices. Otherwise, the next weekend might
also be available, although being a holiday, it might be more
difficult. I do want to see Yang.

Douglas

event from my text (using video, audio tape and live performance) which has
been funded by the Arts Council of England and which will tour in Britain
in the Fall.

I am seeking gigs between 17th and 31th May to talk to people who want to
know more about the Performance Writing course, in particular potential
undergraduate students, students considering joining the postgraduate
taught courses planned for 1999, students considering applying to do
research at Dartington. These would not be formal information sessions
organised by the college, but chats from my perspective as a member of
staff.

I am also seeking poetry reading gigs. I was resident writer at the TATE
GALLERY in ST IVES, CORNWALL (their site is at
http://www.tate.org.uk/menu.htm ). (Text and images from my book Waves on
Porthmeor Beach (illustrated by Sandra Blow RA) were displayed on the walls
of the Gallery amongst the paintings during the exhibition 'Porthmeor
Beach: A Century of Images' (1995/6). The book is a diary of precise
descriptions of the waves on the beach during the six months combined with
brief image poems and texts discussing the process of writing and the
nature of the collaboration with Sandra Blow). My performance piece for 9
voices speaking at the same time (Voices (for 9)) was performed at the
Royal Court in London in 1994. Other works have been presented at the Tate
St Ives, Dartington Arts, Ferens Gallery in Hull, at the Edinburgh Fringe
etc etc. I edit/publish words worth language arts (writers include: Carlyle
Reedy, C Bergvall, J Mac Low, Mac Wellman, H Chopin, dsh, Ken Edwards, cris
cheek, Ernst Jandl etc). I have edited a section on Performance Writing for
PERFORMING ARTS JOURNAL (their site is at
http://128.220.50.88/journals/performing_arts_journal/) which should be
coming out fairly soon. I've been publishered by: Stride, Spectacular
Diseases, Lobby, Talus, RWC
http://www.geocities.com/Athens/Oracle/6753/rwcmain.html, Arts Council etc.

I am in the States for only a week or two but I would appreciate any
suggestions/offers. Texts can be emailed to any who want to see the sort of
stuff I write. It ranges from multi-voice work aiming at the condition of
music through the overlapping of many speaking voices and texts without
apparent coherence or meaning to comparatively coherent and comprehensible
poems and patches of prose. I have a postgraduate degree from the
University of Leeds and am doing research for a PhD at Dartington. What
else might be of use... er...

Poetry does not attempt to discover what there is at the end of the road;
it conceives of the text as a series of transparent strata within which the
various parts--the different verbal and semantic currents--produce
momentary configurations as they intertwine or break apart as they reflect
each other or efface each other. Poetry contemplates itself, fuses with
itself, and obliterates itself in the crystallizations of language.
Apparitions, metamorphoses, volatilizations, precipitations of presences.
These configurations are crystallized time: although they are perpetually
in motion, they always point to the same hour--the hour of change. Each one
of them contains all the others, each one is inside the others: change is
only the oft-repeated and ever different metaphor of identity.
   The vision of poetry is that of the convergence of every point. The end
of the road.

   Merritt Clifton definitely edited a magazine called SAMIZDAT
   in the late 80's from the border of Ontario/Vermont.....
   It had been around awhile, because I think it was issue #216
   around then.....so it's possible he also edited the magazine
   about which Achembeau speaks. But that was "before my time"--
   I know that CLifton was a VERY interesting man, moved around
   a lot, both geographically as well as in terms of jobs, etc....
   good to hear (from Steven Marks) that he's still at it.....

Thanks to everyone who replied to my post, backchannel & otherwise.

For those of you who were wondering, it turns out Merritt Clifton edited
a quarterly magazine called "Samisdat" (with an s, not a z) from
1973-1990, and also published books and chapbooks under the imprint
"Samisdat Associates" -- some of these are still available.

Fortunately, Merritt tells me that he has no problem with the title
"Samizdat" (with a z, not an s) being used for a new journal with which
I'm involved.  First issue in August, several listees to be included.
More info later, and my thanks to those who helped me track Merritt
Clifton down in the wilds of Washington State.

Bob

Burning Press is pleased to announce our latest release:
_Certainty Series_, a book of poems by Dean Taciuch.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------

   certainty


      leaves trails.  The way back, though, may be through.  Less certain,
      uncertain. You said no one ever came by, but the bicyclist disagreed-
      there were other roads, lesser known paths into questions.

      Or around the answers as though they were trees.  Such shade they
      cast fell to us, covering us in cool demonstrations.  No need, no
      need.  We have not returned.

      Blankets, the chill of evening, the blue light fading into black.
      The fringes are a comfort, marking the transition from wool to skin.
      leaves it open, allows air to breathe through.  Into the question,
      where

      leaves trail
                less certain, un-
      stable elements        beyond a sense
        that can or can't be
          seen there                   the cyclist's
                            broken spokes

      spoken answers as though they were
      leaves          cool demarcations            no
      need for the blanket blue fading into
      fringes of comfort               wood to skin
      leaves they open                                  into

                                steady
      questions of relative                         ease
      study questions in the quiet
      uncertainty of bookish introductions
      looking at  instructions         not
      reading them

      a stream of information just this side of
      breaking through into sense.  Give it a break,
      break it off, listen:

      what sound?  the fingers rake across a blank
      expanse of leaves.

a further note RE: Oppen. If Adam could indicate which letter it was, I should
be glad to try and intepret it as best I can or to contextualize it. I
probably could have identified every word in that book soon after it was
published, but at a distance of 8 years, I need a little date or something
to help out. Or page number. Rachel

Hi, Mike, hope you're well. Thinking stuff out for your mailer. Do visit
the following site on May 1st, and make responses.

          Hope that you'll be interested in news of this forthcoming web
site and be inspired to contribute an observation from your everyday of May
1st
1998

PLEASE PASS THIS ON TO ANYONE YOU THINK MAY BE INTERESTED
and apologies if you've received this message twice!

mayday97mayday98
http://www.mayday.var.org

(hosted by var e-zine)

          a web site re-evaluating one year on since the 'sea-change' General
Election through observations of everyday life

          The site goes on-line at 00.01hrs (BST) May 1st 1998 unfolding
over the day on an hourly basis until 23.59 hrs (BST). It presents selected
extracts
from a project, initiated by poet / publisher cris cheek, as a homage to
Mass Observation, which generated a wide range of texts and images from the
everyday lives of people around Britain, on Mayday 97. cris cheek (Sound &
Language), together with Var editor, Kirsten Lavers invite responses
throughout mayday 98 to be uploaded as they come in.


Not another Mass Observation project surely!

No. This is not about one person snooping on their neighbour, or their
community. These are those details of their own everyday lives, that people
have a desire to register. 'mayday97mayday98' begins to map what people
make a 'note' of, what strikes them, what catches their attention. What is
important to them, in that place and at that time, however mundane or
ephemeral that may appear to be.

Why this site, now?

Contributions to mayday97 inevitably included a lot of references to the
General Election. We thought that, one year on, some reconsiderations were
called for. The contributions invited to this site on May 1st this year
form part of that process. What results will remain on-line for the
foreseeable future, hosted by var e-zine, at this URL. There will be other
onward developments from this project, including a planned book publication.

            - - -     How to take part this year     - - -

Everyone is encouraged to contribute to mayday98. Either in response to
something seen or read on the site OR an observation that YOU make on
May 1st this year. When we get your observation it will be loaded up, asap.
And your name (unless you ask otherwise), will be added onto the growing
list of contributors. You can contribute texts and images of all kinds
(photos, drawings, scans, photocopies, writing), shorter, pithier, things
are best. We might make a selection. NB. (Please do it on May 1st only!)

- here's how
1. fax on  01223 576082
2. e-mail  kirsten@everyday.demon.co.uk
3. send an attachment with your e-mail message (we can accept rtf, text,
j.peg formats)
4. telephone a message to 01223 576082 we will check the answer machine
every half an hour and transcribe your message direct onto the site

Things to include (optional)
-   your location (or the location of the observation)
-   your name (names will not be attached to individual contributions on
the site)
-   how we can contact you (a book is in the planning stages, and other
developments are likely from this site)

                                     ###

Mass Observation

Mass Observation was founded, sixty years ago, in 1937, by Tom Harrison, a
self trained anthropologist, Charles Madge, poet and journalist, and
Humphrey Jennings, painter, poet, writer and film-maker. Mass Observation
challenged the claim of the press to represent the views of ordinary
people. Despite the male grouping that mobilised it, Mass Observation
archived an extraordinary and incomparably rich body of writing by women.

The Mass Observation Day Survey of May 12th 1937 exploded simplistic
notions of collective identity. It compiled reports, written on that day by
hundreds of people in all 'walks of life'. The result stands as an
interrogation of the construction of meta-narrative. However, Mass
Observation did contribute to the sense that 'big brother was watching
you', and resulted in some prurient 'othering'.

May 12th 1937 was the Coronation day of George VI - a day that was claimed
to represent a 'sea-change' for the British people. 'mayday 97' marked
another such defining moment.

we look forward to receiving your observation
cris cheek and Kirsten Lavers

Small Press Traffic presents

Joseph Donahue
Ed Roberson

Thursday, April 23, 7:30 p.m.
New College Cultural Center
766 Valencia Street, San Francisco
$5

Joseph Donahue's new chapbook will be out in time for this event . . .
Terra Lucida (Heaven Bone Press).  Though he spent many years in New York,
he comes to us now from Seattle.  He's the author of World Well Broken
(Talisman House, 1995), Monitions of the Approach (Red Dust, 1991) and
Before Creation (Central Park Editions, 1989).  He was one of the editors
of Primary Trouble: An Anthology of Contemporary American Poetry.
Donahue=B9s poetry is devotional, dark, always on the edge--Bataille meets
The Song of Bernadette.  Its panoramic energy is harnessed by a stunning
prosody, but still the margins of his poems look awfully vulnerable, like
something's bound to burst out.

Ed Roberson is the celebrated author of Voices Cast Out to Talk Us In,
winner of the 1994 Iowa Poetry Prize, as well as several earlier books
including When Thy King Is a Boy, Etai-Eken, and Lucid Interval as Integral
Music.  His selected poems (Just In/Word of Navigational Challenges) will
appear in the fall, and you heard it here first!  Roberson has been
compared to such masters as Ornette Coleman, Gabriel Garcia Marquez, Romare
Bearden in his complexity and dedication to experiment.  This formal
bravura and elasticity explores as has no other poetry the mysteries of the
African-American experience, seen and heard backwards and forwards in time
and space.  Ed Roberson is assistant director of special programs at Cook
College, Rutgers University.  This is a rare San Francisco appearance by
one of the great poets of our time.

Still under construction but no need for hard hats or much ducking here.  It
looks very well.  Attractively laid out, simple to use and already
substantial.  I had no idea that spt had published so many authors. The
review page is particularly good.  A site capable of carrying a great deal
of stuff while still having a nice airy feel.  Well worth bookmarking.

do you find all your mistakes that quickly, the navaho disrupt their
geometric patterns, build an error in because only god is perfect or so
i've been told, so the perfect pattern would be the mistake, the forgery,
the insincere prayer.

Hi everyone, it's Kevin Killian.  Thanks to all who replied to my plea for
someone to come stay in my apartment while I'm out of town next week.  Yes,
we have several winners who will arrive in shifts, to take care of our two
cats, Blanche and Stanley.  I'm sure you all have heard the story about how
I inserted their names "Blanche and Stanley" into the popular anagram
program on the web and the first thing that came up was "Channeled by
Satan" (!!!) but that is a calumny of the alphabet, they are sweet and
timid, like field mice or lilies.

Anyhow while I'm there, back east, at my brother's wedding in the Bronx,
Dodie Bellamy and I will also be reading at the Poetry Project at St Marks
on Wednesday April 29th (2nd Avenue at East 10th Street).  Dodie=B9s novel
"The Letters of Mina Harker" will be hot off the presses by then (Hard
Press) and she will be reading from it.  "The Letters of Mina Harker is a
great book in every respect," says Dennis Cooper.  "Mesmerisingly
secretive, yet huge and generous in scope, it's a dazzling stylistic and
intellectual feat down to its tiniest syllables and asides, and almost sure
to be one of the touchstones of contemporary fiction. Mark my words."

Then the intermission and then I come on with my short play "Cut," the
Alfred Hitchcock story, staged reading with a cast of NY poets, painters,
and novelists: D-L Alvarez, Bruce Andrews, Lee Ann Brown, Tim Davis,
Kenward Elmslie, Eileen Myles, Sianne Ngai, Michelle Rollman, Eleni
Sikelianos, Lynne Tillman, Laurie Weeks and Joe Westmoreland; and myself.
A discontented faculty wife (Myles) embarks on a sultry affair with a young
cub reporter (Davis), while her husband (Elmslie), director of the Berkeley
=46ilm Commission, plans a theory-heavy salute to the films of Alfred
Hitchcock (also played by Davis).  In another plot line, couture king Karl
Lagerfeld (Andrews) descends onto Berkeley to dethrone Lancome spokesmodel
Isabella Rossellini (Tillman) and replace her with the younger,
Bard-educated Chita du Sumatra (Rollman).

Then onto Washington D.C. where we will read again on Saturday, May 2 at
7:30 p.m. at the Ruthless Grip Art Project, 1508 U Street NW, near the
corner of U and 15th.  Dodie will again read from her cornerstone of
contemporary fiction, and I will be reading from my own work, and also
first reading of the newly discovered "=B3Fix Poems" of Jack Spicer,
discovered in November 1997 and soon to be published as a book by Steven
Clay of Granary Books (with pictures by Fran Herndon).  Sure to cause a
stir on the Beltway and we are inviting Monica Lewinsky too.

Sorry to make this post so long--you can see I don't get out much.

Kevin

Randolph,

Thanks for the encouragement.  We purposely kept the webpage simple--and
the simplicity and elegance of Laura Moriarty's *non* inspired us to go
through with the project.  We used PageMill because a trained monkey could
do a website with PageMill--and because Pam Lu works for Adobe and
therefore could purchase a copy for Small Press Traffic for pennies. Also,
it's available at the computer labs of San Francisco State and New College,
where much of the work on the page took place--as well as on people's home
computers.  Small Press Traffic's computers, god bless their micro hearts,
are not powerful enough to run PageMill.  Pam and Diana Cage, both of whom
had some previous experience (unlike me who had to go through the PageMill
tutorial just to be able to talk to them) also did some hand coding.
Originally Diana, who is a creative writing student at SF State, designed a
version with frames, but the computer lab guy at SF State recommended
against it, saying that many of the types of people who would access our
site wouldn't have computers powerful enough for frames.  The autho bios
section is Pam's brainchild.  The project was/is fun, very grassroots, with
the SPT board putting in input as well, and myself and SPT intern Sonia
Greenfield acting as assistants to Diana and Pam.

A photo section is soon to be added.

Thank you, thank you, to the unknown computer lab guy. I wish I had
frames. There must be a lot of good stuff I'm missing because I don't. But
that dude's right.

And now I'm going to go take a look at the SPT site myself. With Netscape

Hello

I have and am using an essay called "The Commitment to Theory" by Homi
K. Bhabha, paginated 111-131.  But the person who gave it to me doesn't
have the reference, nor does the person who gave it to her.  I'd like to
site it.  Does anyone know where this comes from??????

Also, would anyone be interested in me posting who will be at Naropa
this summer (June 15-July 12) and when?

best,

I'm curious about this too.  Was this event held in San Francisco, because
if it was, I think I was there.  I remember an auditorium and Rachel at the
podium speaking, and George Oppen sitting in the back of the auditorium,
and a tape being played of Oppen speaking or reading because he was too ill
to do so in person.

My knowledge of the poetry world was quite fuzzy back then--and I went to
everything, an anything.  I was eager.  Did this really happen?  Was I
really there?

In "The Commitment to Theory," an essay collected in The Location of

framed in order to question the elitism and Eurocentrism of prevailing
postcolonial debates...

When Octavio Paz was here in S.Fla two years ago he was kind and generous to
all of those who sought him for autographs even while Derek Walcott and Ceslaw
Milosz stood off somewhat neglected. I do remember hearing that in the same
trip, a conservative Cuban-American managed to snag him for a talk on Castro
and Cuba, which surprised me because of his earlier stand against ideological
involvement. What was the nature of his political feuds in Mexico in his later
years?

Paz was never politically unengaged, to the best of my knowledge.  And of
course he was virulently anti-castro, anti-communist.  He had notorious
feuds with Neruda, who was an unrepentant Stalinist to the end.

Paz was also a sort of literary dictator in Mexico. His magazine Vuelta
published the same writers over and over.  An extremely powerful man.

His essays on modern poetry are worth reading, especially Children of the
Mire. He can be somewhat facile at times, almost glib; yet even when he is
glib he has more to say than many other writers at their most profound.
His knowledge of modern poetry was both broad and deep. He knew cummings,
Pound, French poetry, as well as Spanish language poetry.

There are very few of the original modernists of the 1920s and 1930s still
alive now. Paz was a little younger (b. 1914) but lived much of this
history beginning with the Spanish civil war.

His poetry often leaves me unimpressed; this may be just me, though I've
found similar reactions among many other people I've known, many of them
specialists in Latin American poetry. Can he be compared to Neruda,
Vallejo, or Lezama Lima?  I have my doubts. He often seems to be "willing"
himself into avant-garde postures in a way that doesn't convince me
totally (somewhat like Huidobro the generation before).

I feel an epoch has come to a close with his death.

My own feeling (underscore -- no time to back it up with actual thought,
for god's sake) is that Paz can compare favorably with Neruda -- but I
would agree that Lezama Lima and Vallejo are considerably more interesting
(to me) -- here again, though, the circumstances of career affect (and
effect) what we have of each poet to read --

Further on the "feuds" -- much of the battle was a proxy war, with Krause
(sp?) advancing the Paz line against Fuentes et al -- it was ugly --

You are right, Aldon, Paz can be compared to Neruda, in that Neruda wrote
so much and of so variable a quality. He was a "gran poeta malo" as
someone once called him. I was thinking of the Neruda of Residencia en la
tierra, not of the various mediocre and awful Nerudas.

The feuds were ugly and often carried out by proxy, as you indicate. I
have very little interest in them beyond their obvious interest as pure
gossip.

This is Rhys Chatham, a friend of Hannah's, a composer/new music person,
who was active around The Kitchen (NY) in the 70s, may have even have been
the music director. Quick web search found
http://www.goddard.edu/wgdr/kalvos/chatham.html
http://www.trouserpress.com/bandpages/RHYS_CHATHAM.html

"charlemagne"
This is (Brooklyn born) Charlemagne Palestine, a fabulous pianist/composer,
also active in New York in the 70s, who I believe has stopped performing,
and I think also stayed away from recordings of his work as well. He gave
mesmerizing performnaces of work somewhat in the area of Young or Riley or
Reich or Glass but more idiosyncratically expressive, more driven. He is
also a visual artist and continues to show his work, mostly in Europe as
far as I know.
Found this item, a 1989 "interview"/phone call  with Charlemaigne Palestine:
http://home.cdsnet.net:80/~michaelm/death/ch_int.html
It's quite interesting --

Both were quite well-known on the Downtown new music/performance scene of
the mid-70s.

True Paz was never politically unengaged, but he did advise against the dangers
of confusing poetry and ideology (as I meant) such as he accused Neruda and
Louis Aragon of doing. This was the man who adopted Gide's saying "The writer
must know how to swim against the tide." Paz was an individualist. For Paz,
liberalism, positivism, and Marxism-Leninism were enthusiastically embraced by
Latin America intellectuals as "abstract formulas" without being thoroughly
reexamined "by and for Latin Americans." Paz the politically involved said that
"we must cultivate and defend particularity, and irregularity--life. Human
beings do not have a future in the collectivism of bureaucratic states or in
the mass society created by capitalism." To be fair, it must also be remembered
that Paz said the dangers attendant upon discord are irresponsible song OR
silence.

It is unfavorable to compare Paz with Vallejo,and other innovators like him.
And this is not because his poetry doesn't stand up to theirs, but rather
because Paz and Vallejo came from vastly different backgrounds and took quite
different approaches to the way they handled their spanish. Paz and Neruda at
least shared a sense of clarity in their language, but Vallejo sought to
destroy and then rebuild, or reinvent spanish in a way more reminiscent of
Celan. Vallejo's poetry being like the "war machine" of Celan's (to borrow a
phrase from Pierre Joris whose it is). Paz seemed more to parallel Machado and
Guillen in their form and language. He didn't appear to try to be the incessant
innovator type, at least not after the 50's. And rather than will himself into
any particular avant-garde posture, he advanced the strong influence of Andre
Breton and the surrealists, personal friends of his, as did Rene Char, another
dear friend of his. Paz came to live a most enviable life of poetry in his many
travels, associations and friendships with some of the most famous writing
figures, poets, and philosophers of this century many of whom were the
avant-garde of their day. He was witness to the literature and events of almost
the entire 20th century. I just think that many of the objections to Paz's
poetry have stemmed from what was perhaps seen as a perpetuation of an already
traditional spanish surrealism over and against a call for an overt populist
poetry in his country and in Latin America. Then of course there was the
critical backlash here too against a revised (and I believe improved)
surrealism in the 60's and 70's.

Paz's poetry will be for Mexico as monolithic and timeless as he meant for it
to be in a country of contradiction and influence.

Just waded through the past few daysworth of messages, disappointed not
to see an answer posted.  Veitch's bio-part in Padgett/Shapiro _Anthology
of NY Poets_ has got to be one of the all-time best contributor's notes,
between the tongue-out-eyes-up pic and that "awaiting the painful
emergence of god in his flesh" bit, well.  (BTW, if anyone has a copy of
that book they want to unload for a few hundred pennies, but probably
not.)
  Anyway, anyone know if Sotere Torregian is still alive?  & while I'm
here, if he published anything after _The Wounded Mattress_, which I was
surprised to see is still listed in Books in Print?

>Human beings do not have a future in the collectivism of bureaucratic
states or in the mass society created by capitalism." To be fair, it must
also be remembered that Paz said the dangers attendant upon discord are
irresponsible song OR silence.>

The die hard Marxists give a powerful push in the direction towards
more and more amorphous and unindividuated mass society capitalism.

The die hard Capitalists give a powerful push in the direction towards

Soon either everyone becomes dehumanized or something breaks....in the middle.

That was more obvious during the overt Cold War when two (to each other's
points of view) evil empires faced off against one another. Not so obvious
now when it is all mostly covert rather than overt.

So, in a way, Paz is not wrong. There is some truth to that, if that refers
to the preservation of the individual, and of humanity as creative
individuality rather than one or another kind of mass collectivization.

Thanks to all for the Geocities responses. No go with them, though, as
they won't allow me to list subscription information (I want to put up
some material & point readers to the print mag). Does anyone know of a
free service? Surely someone must provide this for the arts... And if
the service doesn't include garish banners and pop up windows, all the
better!

Dear Mike,

I don't get around much, but here are a few places:

used bks - Cellar Stories, downtown, is the biggest;  Myopic Books, in Wayland
Square has a good selection.

jazz: there's CAV, an interesting bar/restaurant/antique store/music venue,
run by this eccentric grande dame poet-lady from Egypt named Sylvia Moubayed.
There's Chan's, in Woonsocket, a half hour drive north, a huge Chinese
restauarnt whose owner loves jazz & books big names. probably some other
places.  AS220 downtown is a kind of punk gallery dada poetry/art music place.

pick up a copy of the Providence NewPaper, a weekly - it covers most of
what's going on & will give you a lot of info.  You'll learn fast, RI is a
small place but with a lot of layers. Enjoy!

The phrase "war machine," attributed on this list to Pierre Joris, is also
found in an essay by Monique Wittig collected in _The Straight Mind__. She
compares Proust to a "Trojan horse." I know that Joris knows Wittig's
work.

The clarifications about the differences between Paz and Vallejo, offered
by Wm. Burmeister, are completely on the mark. I too understood him to be
talking about Jorge Guillen, not Nicolas.

   For anybody moving to NYC, or thinking of moving IN NYC,
   there is an apartment share available starting June 1st in Brklyn.
   It's a "room with a view" in which one may have "a room of ones
   own"--or maybe even "two" (Not that one has to be a british
   modernist). Backchannel for more information.....
   Thanks, chris stroffolino

I checked into Torregian recently for the first time, Scott...Almost
certainly because someone dropped his name on the List.  Anyway I
encountered it somewhere...

My local library has The Wounded Mattress (which is 1970) and one other
book:

The age of gold : poems.
New York : Kulcher Foundation, 1976.
128 p.


It would indeed be interesting to hear from someone on the list what
background there is to tell, about Torregian.  The books supply nothing
about the poet; ....a total obsurity, to me, just a name I overheard
somewhere.  The two books are worth checking out, for an intriguing
instance of surrealist poetry in the U.S.

Thanks to Jonathan Mayhew for the "war machine" reference. The one time I heard
the interesting phrase was when I was at the New Hampshire conference in aug
'96. I had just met the gracious Susan Schultz and had mentioned my reading of
  _Breathturn_ to her when Pierre Joris suddenly turns up and takes a moment
between panel discussions to talk about Celan and his translations vs
Hamburger's. Out comes this phrase.

His name certainly sounds Armenian to me. For those interested, there is also
(according to Amazon.com) a book called "Amtrak Trek: being poems and prose
written cross-country from California to New York."

this pertains to the tacit issue of womens' rights in the current
negotiations in Afghanistan; I'm sure it has something to do
with poetry.

please read the following and if you are in agreement, 'help'
President Clinton do right by mailing a copy of this message
to <president@whitehouse.gov>.

All of these facts are taken from the current iss. of Women
Leaders Online (WOC Alert - 4/23/98), a free e-newsletter
pertaining to u.s. and internat'l womens' issues. for more
information, visit their www site @ <http://wlo.org>.

        thanks, chris



------- Forwarded Message Follows -------

Mr. President - the Afghanistan peace effort spearheaded
by U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Bill Richardson is welcome
news, and the success of that mission would be cause for joy.
However, I'm greatly concerned that the rights of Afghanistani
women be addressed at the negotiating table, and I'm not sure
that's happening now. As you may know, women in the regions
of Afghanistan under Taliban control are:

* banned from working outside the home;
* banned from attending university;
* banned from going to school;
* prohibited from leaving their homes unless
        accompanied by a husband, father, brother,
        or son;
* required when leaving their homes to be covered
        from head to toe in a 'burqa,' with only a mesh
        opening to see and breathe through;
 * banned from wearing shoes that make noise;

        in addition,

* homes with women are required to paint their windows
        opaque so the women inside cannot be seen.

Such conditions are tantamount to a life in solitary confinement,
comparable to the worst of prison conditions here in the U.S. The
penalty for defying any of these commands is stoning and death.

As a citizen of the United States, represented in these peace talks
by Ambassador Richardson, I insist these issues be addressed. It
is imperative that Ambassador Richardson bring a non-negotiable
initiative for womens' rights to these talks.

        thank you,

                [ *** YOUR SIGNATURE HERE *** ]


P.S., more information on the situation of women in Afghanistan is
available at the Feminist Majority's website http://www.feminist.org

Saved this until the info i was seeking surfaced inmy bookpile.  I think
your reply about 'reading' is worth expanding on, particularly in re visual
poetry.  When I am 'reading' a visual poem i am 'reading' a painting and
my response is a kinetic body response as well as visual.  Does someone
who sees a visual poem out there without a body response really read it
or is it just seen.  might explain some peoples' less than enthusiastic
responses to vispo?

info i whose surfacing i was awaiting is 2 books _Voice_ by David Appelbaum
and _Reclaiming the Tacit Dimension_ by George Kalamaras, both of which have
some interesting things to offer about noncognitive poetic processes.  "Voicing
existence is directed, not to the Cartesian ego, but to the membrane capable
of perceiving existence; the propriceptive film upon which human
conscious is based." - Appelbaum

FIRST OF ALL - so there are no wrong interpretations - I AGREE that that
is horrible. That ought not to happen to human beings. However.....

That is actually indicative of Islamic fundamentalism.

You must realize that Islamic fundamentalists argue that such women
choose freely, and consider themselves liberated by the tradition. Not
only that, but they typically say if asked why they do it that they
do it because they _like_ it.

The latter creates a terribly thorny problem in speaking for persons
who themselves argue that they are choosing something that they themselves
want to choose. While I agree with the sentiments, from a Western and
modern North American standpoint, it is abhorrent, horrible, unthinkable
that people would live in that manner, or be forced to conform to those
kinds of standards, I am still perplexed as to how we, as foreigners,
can in fact speak for a different culture ?  Any ideas as to that ?
It is a different culture. It has different values. Values _we_ do not
agree with and would fight to the death to keep from being imposed on _us_,
but they would fight to the death to have those values, as different as
they are from our's. So, what do we do ?  How do we reconcile our concepts
of freedom with the their claiming that their differences from us are their
expressions of freedom ?  Big problem.

Do we in fact have a petition or some other claim by Afghanistani people
alleging oppression and asking for foreign assistance to liberate them
from that oppression ?  Is there a request before the UN from a significant
portion of the peoples of Afghanistan asking for intervention and liberation ?

Bigger problem if there is not.

Of course, I was one of the few who felt that the Soviet action in Afghanistan,
as an attempt to prevent Islamic takeover of the region was justified, and
that it is a tragedy that it became their Vietnam, rather than a victory for
human rights and freedoms. Sadly the United States sided with the anti Soviet
mostly Islamic rebels and so here we are today....asking the United States
government to reverse its previous intentions and oppose the regime it
helped put into power, even if covertly, in its supply of weapons to that regime
against the Soviet army during the Afghan war ?

That too seems strange....

I have this odd feeling that world politics has become more and more
of a "here we go round the mulberry bush, the mulberry bush...."

Morpheal,

It seems to me that there is a big difference between the
exercise of religious rights and freedoms... and being stoned to death for
not practicing them!

How can you say that these people (women) "like" it? If they liked it so
much, then why would the prohibitions need to be backed up by such
horrible sanctions?

Scott, Ron,

Last I heard, Tom Veitch was doing comics for marvel up in Varmint.  I like
his work a lot:  death collage and a novel the title of which i'm blanking on
but was published by z or sun.  haven't seen any of the comics he's done.
lewis warsh might know more about this as he if memory serves is the one to
have told me about Veitch's recent whereabouts.

Hey.  Gary Lenhart lives in Varmint.  Gary, what's up with mr. Veitch?

Just waded through the past few daysworth of messages, disappointed not
to see an answer posted.  Veitch's bio-part in Padgett/Shapiro _Anthology
of NY Poets_ has got to be one of the all-time best contributor's notes,
between the tongue-out-eyes-up pic and that "awaiting the painful
emergence of god in his flesh" bit, well.  (BTW, if anyone has a copy of
that book they want to unload for a few hundred pennies, but probably
not.)
  Anyway, anyone know if Sotere Torregian is still alive?  & while I'm
here, if he published anything after _The Wounded Mattress_, which I was
surprised to see is still listed in Books in Print?

What was it W.C. Fields wanted for his epitaph, "On the whole I'd rather
be in Philadelphia"?

Sotere Torregian reports that he is alive, 57 years old, and living (for
thirty years) in California, currently Redwood City.  He regrets that he
has never been to Philadelphia.

Has published many books since THE WOUNDED MATTRESS, all out of print
(although a few copies may be available at the Stanford Bookstore), and
is working on new poems and a collected.  His circumstances don't permit
access to the internet, so he asks that anyone interested in his work or
the work of Joe Ceravolo contact him at

PO Box 169
San Carlos, CA 94070-0169

He believes he has all of Ceravolo's poems, including many never
published.  Phone number available by backchannel.

Why is Spicer's ghost not present in _Poems for the Millenium_?

Who is "John" in Robert Creeley's "I know a man."  Is his name really not

Who is Guillame Apollinaire in Berrigan's line "Guillame Apollinaire is

Why are paragraphs emotional and sentences not? What is Chinese about "The

In Afghanistan the women are not choosing freely, they are forced to give

Hi everyone, I'm wondering if you could help me with some terminology. I just
read an interesting essay which used the terms "supermodernity," and "non-
place." While I understand the terms in relation to the essay, I want to use
them more freely but am unclear as to how proper the context is for them. i.e.
how do these terms relate to post-colonial theory? I apologize if this is a
bit unclear but I don't have the article in front of me which basically
discusses these terms in relation to airports,atms, technology, and identity.
Basically, I am just asking you to associate what you know about these terms
because I want to talk about them in relation to experimental theater. I want
to discuss "non-place" as a point of departure for the artist but I may be
just liking the term. Anyway, I just value some thoughts as well as the
academics here who understand the contexts and will set me straight if I need
to be. thank you, Prageeta Sharma.

Morpheal,

It sucks that we live in a time when every motivation can be used by "those
in power" to control the lives of others.   Indeed, to suggest that
fundamental Islam is somehow an unreasonable choice for women is to remove
their agency (a human right by most people's standards) and I suspect
westoxification is one of the main reasons that fundamental Islam has had a
resurgence.

And I see/fear how demanding "agency" is more cynically used (not that you
seem to be doing this in your post) to condone both apathy and exploitation:
"poor people like to live in the slums,"  "those people  working in
sweatshops make a decent living by third world standards and they took the
job."  "We should be taking care of people in this country before we worry
about other countries"

And, of course, Pol Pot dies piecefully in his sleep --rhetorical hammer to
the head that that statement is.

Can I think of who might gain by refraining from intervention in women's
rights in Afghanistan?  Might it be, creepily enough, the same people who
might benefit by intervening in a different culture?  If this is the case,
what agency do these women have, both on an individual level and on a
cultural level?


-- oh and apologies for my misinformation on Sotere Torrigian.  As it is cold
and rainy on the East Coast, living in California sounds much better than
Philly.

I am not at all sure that I could seriously assist with that...but....

Supermodernity must be new ?  Never seen the term in philosophical usage
before, though I was quite familiar with postmodern in that sense of it.

Supermodernity comes after postmodernity ?  Seems that we would then end
up at Postsupermodernity ?  What then ?  Supersupermodernity ?
Postsupersupermodernity ?  Ad infinitum ?

>them more freely but am unclear as to how proper the context is for them. i.e.
>how do these terms relate to post-colonial theory?

What post-colonial theory ?  Is someone referring to post British colonialism ?
That came BEFORE modernity and  post-modernism.

American colonialism ?  That is only beginning in this latter 25 years of the
20th century. The zenith of American colonialism, whether for good or ill
remains to be seen, shall be in the 21st century.

There are other colonialisms currently in the world. Islamic colonialism is
the major one, exerting its influence mostly in Southern and Southeast Asia
and in Africa. Though not exclusively there. There are Islamic colonies in
America, today, mostly amongst black muslims. Similarly Islamic colonies in
Europe and Britain.

Those are the two major colonial powers today and into the next century, the
American, meaning the United States of America, and the Islamic (which is a
looser but not necessarily more free association of states having common
intentiosn and ideology)....

Marxist colonialism is dead as a doornail.

Is "non place" something essentially political ?  Claims of geographic
control are replaced by "non geographic" or "non place" economic and
socio-political
colonialism where control and influence do not have physical geographic
boundaries. Art then would be tending to reflect that very tendency towards
socio-political "non place" would it not ?

Though I know I have diverged from the original intentions, I think it is
nevertheless relevant.

I see it that way too...as an outsider.

I also understand what psychological warfare and brain washing is about.

The element of a psychological "jihad" (holy war) is increasingly prevalent,
and we get some of the mild backwash from the massive waves out there, that
we hardly notice here in our sheltered harbours. They are absolutely swamped
with it. Their minds become saturated. What then ?

Has anyone taken the matter to the United Nations ?

That is the appropriate forum for international debate on that subject.

Would you go so far as to empower a United Nations force, with sufficient
military muscle, to effectively change the situation that you, and others,
feel needs to be changed, if negotiated and mediated settlements fail to
resolve the matter ?  After all, mediation in political matters, is worthless
without backing it up with military might sufficient to enforce.

Ultimately, as a last resort, to save and protect the freedoms of those
people, in terms of safeguarding them from the jeopardies you see inflicted
upon them, to end the physical and mental (brain washing) violence that
imposes what you see as such harsh conditions, is it what you would choose
to spill blood over ?

Do you see any viable alternatives ?

I agree that it is horrible. Definitely absolutely horrible.
I am simply asking, how far are you willing to go, or do you suggest going,
in terms of effective action ?

The availability of hard and soft science, technology in effect, has
furthered the conflict, mostly by providing the means of influence, and
external control.
Even highly educated people, if without very specialized experience and
training, tend to be mere dupes to the systems in effect. Systems that are
in effect even in the most "primitive" locations, such as Afghanistan. A lot
of the tech is long range and hard to track down as to origins, and most of
it is quite accessible "off the shelf" to those with the know how to build
and use it.

I suppose the equivalent of Radio Free Europe is Radio Free Afghanistan,
courtesty of a different source and different concepts of freedom. Tehran
has strong interests in the whole region, so we can expect their support for
Islamic fundamentalist broadcasting. Of course that is only one piece of the
ideological pie, and there is a lot more to the covert and the overt
activity than that.

Of course, American believed in RFE, and those who broadcast Islamic broadcasts
and messages, by whatever means they happen to use, believe in that. There
is the unresolvable conflict. They are willing to die for their beliefs and
the rightness of what they do.

You can see where that leads.

They get a different poem, the Koran, running through their heads, over and
over again, until they completely mesmerized by it and the accompanying
message as to what is right, what one ought to do, how one ought to live.....

What poem would we replace their poem with ?  Replacing it with the Bible ?
That is as bad as what they do. Though some would argue otherwise.

What then ?   The constitution of the USA or the Declaration of Independence
?  That's a different poem. They would not understand a word of it, even in
translation. They would only resent the strange, foreign, and to them
essentially irrelevant, verses.

This is not the same world as in the year 900, but some hold to the same
aggenda, using the new methods of conquest over human minds, customs, beliefs,
ways of life. Heretics shall be stigmatized, persecuted, and put to death by
means that will frighten others away from any dissent and heresy.
Conquest of the human mind and conquest of the population are very much a
part of any program towards hegemony in that region by those who empower
selves by technology and force of arms, to impose their will upon it. Iran,
as do other Islamic states, has great ambitions and sees itself as having a
special mission in this world. Does that sound familiar as regards other
would be or actual great powers ?  Rome, Spain, Britain, America,...It is
our history. They are no different, really. Another would be empire. Our
history is the bloody and violent history of power against power, and empire
against empire. It began as tribe against tribe. Nothing really poetic in
that, or is there ?

The Soviets attempted to counter force with force, brain washing with brain
washing,...and failed, suffering severe casualties and experiencing a
political, economic and human wound the likes of which they had not seen
since WWII. Many soldiers returned half insane, as well as physically the
victims, of the conflict. It was a conflict on two levels. The mental and
the physical. The Soviet effort had no European and American overt support,
only criticism.

That is all indicative.

Worse that those areas least able to provide sustenance in the long term,
are encouraged to rapid population growth. Why, we might ask ?  The old
principle of fodder for the guns. The machinery of conquest still involves
highly brain washed, die hard, believers in an ideology who are willing to
enter into imposition of their beliefs upon others by means of force of
arms. If a power lacks enough guns and sophisticated weaponry, they choose
force of numbers. They gamble that any opposition will flinch away from
leaving a heap of dead bodies on the battle field of high principles.  A
million men wielding pitchforks is a formidable political weapon, no matter
how we look at it. It is hard to send in the marines to kill them off,
without suffering extreme political damage at home and abroad. So it is a
dual force of numbers, as deterent and the planet can scrace afford such
rapid population growth in its most fragile and least sustaining regions
before something explodes violently. That is what we are faced with into the
next century. That explosion of over population in regions encouraged to it
by the ideological opposition to what we hold true.

If we do the same, as to our beliefs, there is always the argument that
"might does not make right", and that "one is as bad as the other", or "two
wrongs" to discourage the backing of intervention with effective power. And
if nothing is done then what does it say ?

On the other hand pacifism local to the violence, as a reaction to violence,
leaves the pacifist dead. That is victory for those who choose violence
against pacifism. Mahatma Gandhi today is nothing more than a man who would
sit in front of  a tank and be crushed under its treads. More like a man
attempting to stop a freight train. Gandhi would not have been spared in
today's violent world.

Thus is it that all that is left are the principles, the basic beliefs,
concerning human freedoms of belief, expression, the press, association,
democratic institutions,....that we might be willing to use violence to
uphold and safeguard as well as promote to other parts of the world in hope
of some kind of salvation there before the kettle boils over and becomes
that sea of deliberately overpopulated anger turned to a sea of blood. that
is in part the legacy of Catholicism, Marxism and now Islamization of those
parts of the world?

What are those who believe those human freedoms willing to put on the line ?
There is that or isolationism. I do not know any other answer. I wish I did
know another answer, but I cannot find any. In that sense George Bush was
more right about the dangers than those who foresaw a less perilous course
for the planet.

Remember too that economic embargos are very violent actions, and require
military force to effectively impose and maintain them. They are a weapon of
war in the cloak of diplomacy. They occur after diplomacy has already failed.

>And I see/fear how demanding "agency" is more cynically used (not that you

It is horrible...what happens. There are no easy answers. Sometimes there
are no answers of any kind.

>And, of course, Pol Pot dies piecefully in his sleep --rhetorical hammer to
>the head that that statement is.

What stirred up the Khmer Rouge to their orgy of blood and death ?
I assure you it was NOT Pol Pot. Believe in such leaders if you want to, but
they are only pawns in the larger scenario. It was, I have every reason to
believe, Sino-Soviet involvement in the region, taking advantage of the
local beliefs and conditions, that ultimately led to that bloodbath. Pol Pot
was merely a dupe of a foreign power. Little more than that. A manipulated
figurehead in that largest deadliest and most dangerous game.

Should a western, American led, force have gone in and occupied and pacified
the region, returning it to sanity and democratic norms ?  At what cost ?

Apply that same question to Afghanistan or anywhere else.

I do not believe for a moment that women are the only sufferers.

All people there are the sufferers. The men, the women, and the children all
suffer and shall suffer from it. Too much emphasis on what women suffer
means that the difficulties there have not been well enough understood.

in the USA anyway, as much as I would like to see the sights someday. Being
a visual artist, amongst other things, that is particularly difficult to accept
as something I cannot really do anything about.

Morpheal--

I came across this and thought of our bookstore dx:

"A man is a man insofar as he is a superman.  A man must be defined by
the tendencies which impel him to go beyond the _human condition_.  Any
psychology of the mid in action is automatically the psychology of an
exceptional midn, one tempted by the excetion of a new image grapfted
upon an old one. The imagination invents more thatn things and actions,
it invents new life, new spirit;it opens eyes to new types of vision.
The imagination will see only if it has _visions_." (_On Poetic
Imagination and Reverie_, p. 16)

I doubt I agree that such a mind has to be exceptional, perhaps it is
such a spirit that is so in our Prozac nation.  I always thought the
great irony about activists is that they who are accused of being so
cynical and sour are the most innocent really, always trying and trying
again, in the manner of wiley coyote?

I think in the situation of women in Afganistan, like the situation of
female genital mutilation, is one of conscience.  If you are watching it
and it strikes you it is torture, mustn't you reach out to stop it?  I
would just caution that before judging the tortures of other cultures we
make sure we are vigilant of what is happening in our own.  How many of
us grew up in homes where there existed a conspiracy of silence
around sexual, verbal or physical abuse?

I do have a more serious poetics question. I am thinking about genre in
which a poet "writes through" the work of a precursor. Duncan's H.D. book

     Ron Johnson's _Rad i os_ (which is made by erasing pieces from Pa(radi)se
L(os)t
    Robert Kelly's _Mont Blanc_
    And, of course, Mac Low's many homages

    There are also Duncan's early setting to new meters of Shelley and Milton,
a good chunk of the Cantos, writing through many different texts...

    I just got an amazing book manuscript from Jed Rasula that includes a long
poem (30 pages or more, that is selected words and phrases from James's _The
Ambassadors_ in the order they appear in the original text). In fact, I should
add, in case some of the publishers on the list are listening, this is one of
the most important collections of poems I have seen in ten years.

        As to genre, I am not sure this particular device constitutes a
unified genre.  Often they might be thought of as belonging to the homage, but
that is not always the case, at least in any very direct sense, of _Radi os_.
Perhaps the back-handed homage.

        In a note to "The Ambassadors," Rasula says that he feels that in a
work as gloriously multitudinous as James's, there are any number of other
works  waiting for someone to release them. Actually, I see that he says it
much better than that:  "The poem enacts a longstanding conviction that
James's syntax, cadences and analogies subtly conspire to germinate works
within his works which merit emanicpation to another order of events."

        And, I see no reason why works, thus emancipated, should belong to a
particular genre. It is perhaps not generic but an order of translation.

I think we also have to admit & be aware of our lack of understanding of
other cultures, for one thing. Perhaps a hallmark of our own culture is the
need to intervene. The Islamic culture is deep and deeply foreign, at least
to me, and it seems...well, American, to have this impulse to "fix" it. No
doubt there is pain and oppression in Afganistan, but to think we can/should
judge &/or "fix" it seems, I dunno...patriarchal?....presumptuous? Anyone
who really feels MOVED by this issue ought to do some serious research into
the LONG history that culminates in this situation we're so cavalier about
dismissing as wrong wrong wrong.

Ted Berrigan's THE COMPLETE PRELUDE is put together from Wordsworth's The

I was there and did see the Duchamp.  Museum of Art. Definitely worth seeing.

Camden, though, is one of the most squalid places on Earth. Almost a ruin
of boarded up and falling down buildings. Street after street of them.
People living in there. A quick turn around and back across the bridge into
civilization....

John Cage's works clearly fit into this genre, and as for more recent
examples, there's Joel Kuzsai's ongoing work with Elizabethan materials
(Meow's done some).

I think there are two categories at work here:  imitations/translations/
reenactments such as Stephen Berg's "With Akhmatova at the Black Gates" or
Robert Lowell's "Imitations" and writing through or overwriting, where a
poet takes a text and creates a new text by erasing portions of it.  My two
favorite examples of this genre are Ronald Johnson's "Radi Os" and Tom
Phillips's "A Humument."

Has any critical work been done on or about erasure-type poems?

Jonathon Mahew's question about the lack of Spicer in Poems for the
Millenium (vol. 2) is a good one, given that if you reduced the last 50
years of English language poetry to just, say, 20 people, Spicer would have
to be among them. Maybe even to 10 people. Maybe even to five.

It's really devastating for the book's credibility, even more than the
inclusion of anyone who ever attended a Fluxus event (or the inclusion of
songwriters a la Tom Waits, Robert Johnson and Dizzy Gillespie, all of which
makes them seem like doofuses, which none ever were [not to mention the
thereby curious absence of Jim Morrison or Leonard Cohen or Nanci Griffith
or Public Enemy or Lennon & McCartney or the Glimmer Twins or Bob Dylan, if
one is seriously trying to include the antipoetics of song]).

But Spicer's absence, even tho it's on a scale of missing Stein or Pound,
isn't alone. I note the following omissions: Benson, Brautigan, Bromige,
Bronk, Ceravolo, Thomas A. Clark, Corbett, Curnow [father & son], Dahlen,
Darragh, Davey, Davidson, Dewdney, Dudek, Estrin, Fraser, Grahn, Grenier,
Guest, Hickman, Hocquard, F. Howe, Inman, Ron Johnson, Jonas, Koch, Kulik,
Kyger, Lansing, Mandel, Marlatt, Melnick, Moriarty, Mullen, Natambu,
Padgett, Parshchikov, Pearson, Pickard, Pleynet, Prigov, Robinson, Roche,
Roubaud, Schuyler, Scott, Stanford, Stanley, Thomas, Tomlinson, Tysh (either
one), Wah, Welch, Jonathon Williams, Zhdanov.... And that's just a one-time
perusal of the index and the glaringly obvious omissions from traditions I
have some feel for. One can probably make the argument that the book is also
amazingly Americo-centric, tho the roster above wouldn't particularly solve
that problem.

This really isn't a Pierre & Jerry issue, tho the Spicerlessness of it all
is a "gotcha" that foregrounds the problem. In the American Tree is
certainly vulnerable to the question of why McCaffery or Dahlen or
Scalapino, say, are not there. And the absence of Joanne Kyger, easily the
most influential progressive woman poet of the 1960s and '70s, from Moving
Borders is every bit as much a boggler as Spicer's lacuna here.

Anthologies are, in this sense, impossible. Everyone is going to have a
blind spot, since the last I checked everyone was still human and full of
such frailty. It's why I used such a sociological definition for determining
inclusion in the Tree. Tho, of the poets who met the formal terms I used, I
still managed to miss Abby Child, which looks really dumb from the hindsight
of 14 years.

What about a poem such as Zukofsky's sestina "Mantis" and its companion
poem "An Interpretation"?  If one thinks that it is a good idea to
consider "writing-through" poems as part of a genre, then these two poems
along with many other examples of intertextual poetics should complicate
or at least make more interesting the task of defining the rules of
selection for such a genre.  Is writing-through different than quotation
or allusion?  What about Zuk's uses of Marx's Capital?

Jonathan Mayhew asks:

<<I do have a more serious poetics question. I am thinking about genre in
which a poet "writes through" the work of a precursor. Duncan's H.D. book
or his homage to Stein, Spicer's _After Lorca_, Cage's "writing through"
various authors (Pound, Joyce, etc...), Rothenberg's _The Lorca
Variations_.

1. Any other good examples of this occur to any of you?
2. What would be a good name for this "genre"?>>

1. Something similar is going on in the work of bpNichol or Steve Mccaffery
when they 'translate' writing already in English, as in McCaffery's
wonderful _Intimate Distortions: a displacement of Sappho_ which rewrote
Mary Barnard's translations of Sappho.

2. The term for this is 'homolinguistic translation,' which Stephen Scobie
& I also used in our collection of same, _The Pirates of Pen's Chance_.
Others have tried various forms of same. It is both homage & inheritence, a
new poem made out of, somehow, an older one.

Homolinguistic translation is not the only way this is done, but it is
great fun.

There's also George Bowering's _Kerrisdale Elegies_, a re/vision from
contemporary Vancouver of Rilke's great poem.

If I had time I'm sure I could think of more...Zukofsky's Catullus work,
for example, surely set an example for some of what I'm pointing to here...

        Tonight in Bangor, Maine, 8:00. Kathleen Lignell Ellis, Terrell
Hunter, John Burns, Sylvester Pollet, reading their own stuff & work of
others with music of Dr. Jay Bregman & his Neoboppers--Welch Everman,
trumpet, Jim Frick , guitar & congas, Dr. Jay, alto, and Bart-the-bass.
        I'm going to read two poems of Stuart Z. Perkoff in the first set:"
Bird, an elegy for charles parker, musician," and "Blues for Billie
Holiday." Second set a new piece of mine, "First Will & Testament."
        The Perkoff pieces come from his forthcoming book Voices of the
Lady: Collected Poems. National Poetry Foundation, 1998. It's a terrific
book, 475 pages, foreword by Creeley. We just received advance review
copies--the book will be out officially in July.
        To respond belatedly on the "what to do with 'bad' words in a
kid-laden environment" thread: I'm muting two words in the Bird poem--cock
to joint, and fucking to humping. Normally I'm a total purist on such
matters, but in this instance a lot of parents & kids will be hearing it,
miked, by accident--not by having chosen  to go to an arts event.
Stuart-in-heaven, I apologize. Welch will be muting his horn, too.

I'm a little startled that only one response has so far mentioned Mac
Low...(and then just one of his pieces that writes through);  to myself
and a number of acquaintances, Mac Low is the exemplary instance of really
interesting writing-through strategies...

There is an interesting difference between basing a work of poetry on a
"privileged text," such as Virgina Woolf, and a humble text...Different
implied weights, attitudes, different tonalities about the democracy or
otherwise of writing.  An example of using a humble text (and it is an
astonishing, very exciting poem) is Sentences, by Charles O. Hartman and
Hugh Kenner, which is based on a nineteenth-century elementary school
usage primer, manipulated using two computer programs written by the
poets.

The Atlanta poet John Lowther frequently uses writing-through techniques,
and some of his work, derived from secondary texts on Duchamp (and part of
a large work-in-progress related to Duchamp) will be appearing Misc. Proj.
These utilize the "stoppage" forms Duchamp used in his work, and are a
complex, jazzy sequence of lyrics called Stoppages.

Finally, I may be about to shock Bill Freind a bit as he may not have
quite received my reply, but I'd mention some recent work of his,
utilizing synonymic parallel structures to manipulate well-know anthology
pieces (Robert Frost, Richard Wilbur) as some of the funniest and lovliest
writing I've seen in a while; some will appear in Misc. Proj, and
hopefully others will show up elsewhere....

The list might include, off the top of my head and allowing for rather
permeable boundaries between "writing-through" and criticism; poetry and
fiction; homages to single authors and works that, cento-like, string
together quotes from / readings of multiple sources:

Kathy Acker -- prominent placement of Genet and William Gibson texts in
Empire of the Senseless, Faulkner in In Memoriam to Identity

Bruce Andrews' Dante project (title escapes me at present)

Dodie Bellamy -- The Letters of Mina Harker (ok, based on what I've read so
far, Dracula is more a jumping-off point than a constant reference -- but it
ain't Mina Harker for nothing)

Robin Blaser -- most of the Image-Nations poems, "Great Companions," the
Nerval translations

my own Is Placed / Leaves

Clark Coolidge -- The Rova Improvisations and liner notes to ROVA's album The
Crowd (do musicians count in this?)

Samuel R. Delany -- Atlantis: Model 1924

Rachel Blau DuPlessis -- most any of the Drafts

Dan Farrell's writing-through of Bucky Fuller ( http://www.erols.com/dfar --
I think that's right)

Bill Griffiths -- Rousseau and the Wicked

Alan Halsey -- A Robin Hood Book and The Text of Shelley's Death

Lyn Hejinian -- Oxota: A Short Russian Novel (shades of Evgeny Onegin)

Joel Kuszai's recent work with the various Renaissance anthologies, which I
believe someone else here mentioned

Alice Notley -- Homer's Art and the subsequent epic writing in White
Phosphorus and The Descent of Alette

Stephen Ratcliffe -- Campion On Song

Charles Reznikoff's Biblical adaptations

Viktor Shklovsky -- the Cervantes and Laurence Sterne chapters in Theory of
Prose

For most of these, I would wholly agree with Don Byrd that the attempt to

the ways such work seeks to reconfigure and destabilize genre. One of the
projects of the writing-through / adaptation / homage as practiced by these
writers would seem to be the elaboration of a poetics of reading which
avoids, on the one hand, an historically-naive voluntarism of the creative
act (these are derivative works in Duncan's sense of that term), and, on the
other, a fatalistic relation to the sedimented detritus of that history --
genre, tradition, etc. For many of these writers, I see this happening by a
dispersal and relocation of genre from the level of structure (the
already-achieved within which one writes) to that of construction (the
still-contested with which one writes).

I'd agree that anthologizing (and editing anything, for that matter) is
very personal, as Silliman's list, also full of exclusions, indicates.

More writing through in Paul Hoover's Viridian where "South of X" is
written from his own Viet Nam novel, Saigon, Illinois, and several other
pieces are written through Duras "The Lover" and James M. Cain's "Postman
Always Rings Twice."

If it's "very personal", then I'm afraid it's VERY POLITICAL as well.

I haven't read the Millennium II, but I did give a glowing review (in the
St. Mark's News Letter) to the first volume, precisely because of its contents.

I have to admit, from my perspective, Silliman's list does not bode well for
Vol.2. Preconceptions aside, I guess I'd better get a copy and review it, as
well.

Oh, Ron ... do you think the best first response to what Pierre and I
have attempted is to draw up a list of omissions that the two of us
could as well have done (and didn't) if we wanted to follow your example
in In the American Tree - something approaching a hundred names listed
in your intro (and only three or four of them owned up to in the present
note).  It is all only too obvious and has the feeling of a cheap shot,
which we're all capable of but which makes little sense to me on a first
perusal of what you've written.  The book tries to be inclusive of the
kinds of openings that happened during the time in question - or at
least to give a sense of them - and to reduce it without further comment
to a question of who's in and who's out is to similarly reduce our lives
as poets.  But if you think a gathering like this is inevitably a
collection of names, then obviously we will have failed (at least for
you) in one aspect of what we were after.  By the same token In the
American Tree will have failed on that point alone (& even more so), and
that is also something that I won't concede.

Affectionately (for all of that),

It seems like there is difference between being in some way "possessed" by
another writer as Spicer with Lorca and using a text to actually generate
the lines as MacLow is more inclined to do - I sense that most writers
"write through" in some sense a lot of the time - Lately I've been working
with Blake and the I have done much work with Spicer -
Do the New York School influenced among you feel less inclined to be
textually inspired as opposed to being in relation to experience? Is there
such a thing as being more direct?

I remember reading about Sylvia Plath writing with a dictionary on one knee
and a thesaurus on the other - Many current writers seem to write with a
favorite (or popular or simply found) text on both knees -

I want to alert everyone to the new Madagascar anthology of poetry in
English, SWIMMING WITH THE BUTTERFLIES, just out from Sveeshalm Press.
Over 4500 pp of 20th century innovative poetries ranging from Aalso
Aarnhem's crypto-hic-haiku, via such names as Beauregard Plasm,
Chanella Teems, Leffto Marganato, all the way to Zina Zharlovsky's
amazing proto-epic in reverse phonetics, "Llems Rewolf".  Indispensable.
This book CREATES TIME - as you read!  Unusual phenomenon - you open it
up at 4 pm (eastern standard, let's say) - and when you finish an hour
later it's 2 PM - same day, same time zone!!  So delve into this one -
AT YOUR LEISURE!!

I'm getting younger every day myself!

It's funny that the contents of this anthology are defended on "very
personal" grounds (granted, not by its editors), but that some other
anthology with a different editor, or focus, or purpose, might be attacked
on ideological grounds, e. g. Weinberger's anthology of a few years back,
or anything put together by "official verse culturists."  I may be reasonable
to assume that all anthologists have some combination of personal and "x"
(ideological, poetic, critical, historical, etc.) reasons for what they do
and do not include.  I may be reasonable to expect that poems and not names
are driving the fame train.  I also may be reasonable to think that we need
a more subtle conversation about this than "personal vs. political" arguments
would suggest.

Viva la difference! As old T.S. Elliot once said (in the "Phillip Massinger"
essay), "goode poets make it into something better, or at least different."

        Laura,  I think that's an important distinction.  I wouldn't say
that Waldrop, for instance in The Reproduction of Profiles, is "writing
through" Witt.  More coming to or bringing him to terms.  As for the
NYSchool influenced among us:  It's too problematic for me to say that
"direct" experience, instead of mediated (literary  --  "writing through")
experience, inspires me moreso.  I'd say that Schuyler's "Morning of the
Poem" is a typical NYS example of being "possesed" (Baudelaire's skull)
which may serve as his sort of writing through.   Would your distinction
be that between influence and inspiration?  My reading serves the former,
my living serves the latter.

uh hello, yeah I read all of Silliman's post , don't presume pal-o...? I know
Silliman edited his own anthology but lets face it, Rothenberg and Joris at
least attempted (and this volume is thick enough for a good doorstop) to
include different "galleries" of poets and I think they did a great job.
Silliman's post seemed strange , I mean who cares if they included Robert
Johnson instead of Jim Morrison,  Public Enemy got the first page in Norton's
Anthology of African-American Literature and if you want to include MC's as
poets then people like Kool Keith -Gang Starr- Method Man and the RZA, just to
name a few could fill an anthology with their rhymes themselves..that is a
whole nother story..sorry if this seems mean because i have no personal gripes
with anyone, I only react to what comes into my mailbox and if we are going to
complain about anthologies then we could complain forever..Anthologies are
basically an editors choice thing..
You can't please all of the people all of the time so why complain about
people left out..Silliman if you were trying to say you could do a better job,
then why not out and say it? don't squabble about who was left out, it is
useless...

with you that we're talking about intertextuality here -- but not just
any intertextuality. The works I've cited all involve in some measure a
sustained engagement with the features of another's work -- whether they
be character, narrative arc, or the "actual" words in the "actual" order
-- as a means of elaborating a writer's "own" poetics. In other words,
this is a far different intertextuality from the mere distribution of
cultural markers across the surface of a text.

I wouldn't make so much of this -- especially since, fine points aside,
I'm basically in agreement with you about the unwieldiness of what this
"writing-through" category has become -- if it weren't for the

progressive valence for it. I'd claim, rather, that it's entirely
possible to operate within the confines of a reactionary historical
narrative of fate while producing even the most thoroughly intertextual
work.

This is surely the message of much poetic work which seeks to revive,

allusions -- the purely negative sense that Romanticism, or high
Modernism, or whatever, is still writing our texts for us. Compare the
conservative side of the American university's reception of
deconstruction, whose credo might run, "We'll get around to changing the
world only after we've finally settled our accounts with the Phaedrus."
Intertextuality in these cases is simply an index of the writer's
residence in the "prison-house of language" -- and nary a plan for
jailbreak in sight. To put it another way: intertextuality is the status
of the archive before anyone does any work on it one way or the other.

"writing-through," by contrast, are invested in an interventionist or
constructivist relation to the archive -- the imagination that one might
use the cinderblock and rebar of the prison-house to build apartments,
or roller derby rinks. All in all, I'd say you're right that the list
might not have been precisely what Jonathan was looking for (though I
think The H.D. Book bear some of the responsibility for that
category-confusion), but I'd like to avoid collapsing the whole thing
onto a catch-all notion of intertextuality. Maybe the distinction is one
between the citational and the polemical intertext? Just a thought.

About anthologies - There clearly is no one anthology - as we tend to
imagine there was with the famous ones of the past - many of which however
also don't include key people (Zukovsky, Niedecker etc) - Any reader needs a
pile of them and that at least is good - It is hard on writers to be
excluded (I've been both in and out) though of course it helps when the
writers you are crazy about are also ignored - and rage can be honorable -
And it isn't just career but needing to feel recognized as being part of a
community that one has worked to be part of -

Speaking of writing through other texts--through the voices and tonalities
of other writers....

Mortin Corless-Smith gave a wonderful reading last night at Prairie
Lights. He read primarily from his new book OF PISCATOR--but also read
some selections from a new (so far) chapbook-length series entitled
Worcestershire, Mass.

In much of his work Martin writes through such 'archaic' voices as Dorothy
Wordsworth, Basil Bunting, and others...

Martin doesn't footnote his sources.

It struck me last night that there was a big difference between what in OF
PISCATOR seems like a resuscitation of 'sincerity' through the medium
of archaism (I would argue that Moxley in her IMAGINATION VERSES makes
similar moves...) and a more canonically oriented poetics of citation
(something along the lines of Jorie Graham's MATERIALISM in which the
speaker doesn't take on the voices of precursors, but rather dialogues
with them)....

It seems to me that a major aspect of writing through (and maybe this is a
matter of what someone else here deemed the sub-genre of the homage)
other writers and voices is that of citation.

Best,
Katy

        It is not useless to draw one's attention to the gaps.  I don't
read Ron Silliman's post as a squabble but as an alert.  Sure, the nature
of anthologizing demands that we raise these alerts, since I think we all
might agree these tomes are frequently mis-construed as a "shelf" in of
themselves.  The anthologies in question, by the way, are structured in
such a way as to preclude such mishandling . . . although perhaps the
title is a bit ambitious.     --  Patrick F. Durgin

Poor Bronk -- Hoover skipped him (and Oppen!) in the Norton Postmod, too.
Like Ron Silliman, I also get annoyed with omissions (moreso than with
inclusions), especially when the anthologists are acknowledged experts who
know what they're doing, but I also know that some exlusions are
attributable to nasty permissions offices, greedy estate executors,
untraceable heirs, and other agents beyond the anthologist's control. If
anything, Ron's star-studded list proves just how much worthy stuff is out
there, in spite of  those depressing moments when it seems like it's all
just contempo Wordsworth.

yes that is the question.  or questions Rachel.  thank you for stating it that
way. in addtion to sexual and other forms of abuse, we should think about
"our" own genital mutilation that is often rendered on peoples born with
"ambiguous genitalia" or so-called intersexuals.  one american doctor was
recently quoted like this when asked about why he cuts:

"I don't think it's an option for nothing to be done.  I don't think parents
can be told this is a normal girl, and then have to be faced with what looks
like an enlarged clitoris, or a penis, every time they change the diaper.  We
try to normalize the genitalia to the gender to reduce psychosocial and
functional problems later in life."

the model of writing through that seems most relevant to me --and
germane to most of the examples offered -- is H.D.'s use of palimpsest
....

which perhaps also points not so much toward a conception of genre as
one of method ...

Bill and Rachel,

It seems to me that women's situation in Afghanistan is not readily
comparable to genital mutilation for religious reasons NOR to the
genital mutilation of ambiguously sexed newborns.

To choose to be mutilated for religious reasons (even if this "choice"
seems to be the product of coercion),or to have your genitals mutilated
at birth without your consent--these do seem comparable to Afghani
women "choosing" to wear veils or to stay indoors....

But these examples are not (in my mind) comparable to being STONED TO
DEATH for not "choosing"...

It seems to me that the cultural directive in these examples (staying
indoors, being unambiguously sexed, having your clitoris removed) is quite
distinct from the punishments that are doled out for refusing to comply.

Subject:      Poetry at the White House, Anthologies
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain

Did anyone hear the NPR report yesterday about the Millenium night at the
White House Wednesday night featuring American poets? It was a different
list of attendees than either Jerry and Pierre's or Ron's (of course?) --
but Merwin, Ashbery, Hass, Pinsky, Dove, Forche (who I always associate with
the ears on the general's table in El Salvador) were there, along with
other, largely predictable, names who swim in the main stream -- (is Stanley
Kunitz still alive? Donald Justice?) Anyway, there was one mild bit of
frisson in the report when the report mentioned that some poets had been
invited but chose not to attend -- one was Hayden Carruth, who was then
asked "Are you saying that poets like Haas and Pinsky are hypocrites, then?"
There was a long pause, and Carruth then said "I'd really rather not
comment." I'm sure 95% of folks listening had no idea of whom he was talking
about, but it was enough to make me go "whoa"! Adrienne Rich's refusal of a
big poetry prize last year was also mentioned at about that time . . .

I bring up the report not because anyone on this list would envy those
present, or want to shoot the shit with Bill (who was actually quite funny,
saying that memorizing a hundred lines from _Macbeth_ taught him that
political fame was fleeting), but to raise more generally the question of
political action (viz Afghanistan) and what it has to do with poetry.
"Poetry makes nothing happen," said Auden, famously, and Ashbery, in this
report, agreed: "Poetry is poetry, and social action is social action, and
never the twain shall meet." Forche agreed. But they were there Wednesday
night. Wasn't that a political act? I think of the answer given by Ed Dorn
in an interview, when someone asked him what the function of the poet was in
"today's society," and he said something like, "surely the function of the
poet is to stay away from all permanent associations with power."

Easy enough to do, most of us would say! Maybe . . . but what is this
questioning of the inclusion list of anthologies ABOUT, really? Is it really
about a high-minded attempt to shape the literary tastes of a generation, or
is it about the anxiety of career and one's place in the canon? (I mean, I'm
still pissed that Andrei left me out of _Staying Up Late_, and that was ten
years ago!) I applaud Laura's comment, to the effect, that we should just
let a thousand flowers bloom, and the more anthologies published with
different people in them the better. Is it really as simple as that? Or does
arguing about the people selected for the latest big anthology really just
planning the White House dinner party for the year 2020?

is a true example of the genre. I even have one poem

I did hear the NPR story you mentioned, and have mixed feelings both about
those attending and those who refused to attend, which I will not bore the
list with.
Interesting post, however, Safdie.  And yes, Kunitz is still alive.

Or those who fail to choose being driven insane and / or driven to suicide ?

In the latter, most common, instances is there any difference from
being murdered ?

Somewhat aside to the discussion of Afghanistan, the current Pope of the
Catholic church has condoned suicide for those who cannot take the pressure
any more. In other words, the Pope, has condoned murder. Pressure them until
they kill themselves since we can no longer stone them, torture by means of
the Inquisition, or burn them at the stake.

Oh, the world has come a long way from the burning of witches.

Now a religious leader says what is essentially: "have them kill themselves".
What wonderful progress. Civilization at last ! A truly Socratic tradition.

As for other traditions having the same tendencies....I am sure they do.

>It seems to me that the cultural directive in these examples (staying

The very common, but foreign to North America, practice of removing the
clitoris is to destroy a woman's sexual enjoyment. Some people, quietly,
believe that that is _necessary_ or a woman will be likely to be unfaithful
to her husband. Also that she would want too much from her husband so the
removal of the clitoris means that she will not marry on the basis of
gaining sexual satisfaction. At least that is how much I have gleaned as to
that
particular practice.

As far as I can determine it is common in many Islamic countries, but
is more ancient in origins and more widespread as to origins than that
particular tradition. Coincidence in a lot of instances, that both traditions
happen in the same locations among the same peoples.

The world is not a civilized place.

Do not dream for an instant that the primitive, brutal, cruel, practices
of the past, including religious and secular practices, have been driven
from this world as the true demons that they in fact are. If there are
any demons then they surely are the demons incarnate.

While I am not interested in arguing with, nor supporting, Silliman's ideas
for the poets that should have been included in this Rothenberg/Joris "Poems
for the Millenium II" anthology...I find Silliman's tone unnecessarily
"blaming."  There's room for another anthology by Silliman, or anyone else.

The misconception that anthologies can inclusively and comprehensively
"represent" a period, a genre, etc., has been around long enough, and has been
lamented over long enough, that I think we should retire it.

Poetry is a social action.
This story is a parable.  Power corrupts... language.
Hurray for Carruth & Dorn (& Joe Safdie).

What, in your view, IS "the nature of anthologizing," and what, specifically,
would these "alerts" serve to accomplish?  I'm interested in understanding
your viewpoint.  I'm especially interested in understanding what you, and
other folks, expect from anthologies, and I'm further interested in examining
whether our expectations might be changed, or whether anthologizers need to
conform more to such expectations, or...?

another instance of writing through or translations from English would be
manymany poems by Gerard Malanga, e.g., take "To a young heiress" and "To
the Harbormaster" (Frank O'Hara) and see how the former is a
demetaphoricized, etc, version of the latter.  There's an anecdote I
vaguely remember about O'Hara and somebody else listening to a Malanga
reading and picking out their own (and others) poems as the
models/originals for everything.

is Gerard about to be revived? I saw a photo of his of Andrew Wylie in
a recent New Yorker and journal excerpts were published somewheres (can't
remember where).

On Thursday evening Michael Davidson and David Bromige teamed up for a
reading at Loyola Marymount University's campus -- spotted in the audience
were Chris Reiner, Will Alexander and Marjorie Perloff.  Thanks to United
Airlines, Bromige had an unexpected opportunity to entertain audiences at
the San Francisco airport in a rare three hour show, while Maera Schreiber
and Davidson spoke of Zukofsky over dinner.  But Bromige abrupted upon the
scene at last, and the reading was on. "You Were Saying," Davidson read,
from new work in progress, followed immediately by its shadow poem, echoing
voice, rewrite, "Footnote: Enthymeme."  (footnote to self: remember to
explain to students next week what an "enthymeme" is)

to please good men
is unfortunate
given a square
of which the novel

thing is not proportion
but the action
performed there
that proves its opposite


"Henry James in Hoboken" was a personal favorite.  New Davidson book en
route soon.

Bromige read, among his newer works, "2 from T as in Tether," and yes, that
does amount to two for T.  "The other has been ingested / I stand in the
safeway and smile."  Not content to read from just ONE not-yet-printed
volume, Bromige also read from the most timely NOT SANE ENOUGH FOR THE
DEATH PENALTY.

I do not believe in psychology
What did it ever do for me

Except provide a living
For doctors who cared less

But were polite to me
As one form of domination

A state I appear to prefer
Leastwise in my dreams

Davidson and Bromige, who do not appear in _Poetry for the Millennium_ but
you can xerox their poems and lay them into your copy of that or any other
anthology, re materialized on Friday at noon to regale a small audience of
students and friends with their bemused and astute assessments of one
another.  It all went swimmingly, as Bromige splashed off to his weekend
and Davidson picked up a double-expresso before heading down the 405.

I started wondering about that, too: in Reva Wolf's book, _Andy Warhol,
Poetry and Gossip in the 1960s_ (1996 or 97, U of Chicago Press), he gets
more attention than any other NY poet, including Ashbery, Berrigan, and
even O'Hara. Obviously, it's because of his proximity to The Factory
compared to those others, but it was interesting (and at times disturbing)
to see his poems get such close attention in that company.

Dear Gwyn,
        The White House event went very well.  I was a bit disappointed
that the only avant poet there was Charles Bernstein.  But the invitee
lists were drawn from organizations, primarily...The Academy of American
Poets, the NEA, etc.  People there included Ashbery, Levine, Merwin, Dove,
Pinsky, Hass, C.K. Williams, James Tate, William Meredith, Lorna Dee
Cervantes, Jorie Graham, David Mura, Garrett Hongo, Kate Daniels, C.D.
Wright, Forrest Gander, Heather McHugh, Frank Bidart, Yusef K., Lucille
Clifton, Anthony Hecht, Stanley Plumly, Michael Collier, Susan Shreve,
Alan Cheuse, Mark Doty, Carol Muske...more, but I can't think of them.
The Clintons were both there, and didn't leave until 11:30 or so.  It
started at 6:30 p.m.  It was a celebration, really, of the history of
American poetry.  Readings were from Dickinson, Whitman, Frost, Williams,
O'Hara, Countee Cullen, Robert Hayden, Elizabeth Bishop...more, but again,
I can't think of all.  Dove, Pinsky and Hass read, and all read quite
well.  The reading was broadcast on C-Span, and to 44 satellites and the
internet.  Then we had dinner.  It was all very moving and lovely, and I
felt very fortunate to have been part of it.  Oh, yes, Galway Kinnell and
Louise Gluck were also there.  Some I noticed who were not: Creeley,
Kunitz, Kumin, Kizer, Olds, and a host of experimental poets.  Hayden
Carruth was the only person to decline, and did so because he thinks the
Clintons are not supportive enough of the arts.  I think it is the
legislative branch that hasn't been supportive, so I guess I disagree with
Hayden.  But I respect his decision.  I'm not sure that going to the White
House for dinner constitutes an association with "permanent power."  But I
come out of a human rights tradition, and we'll go anywhere and talk to
anyone who will listen...
Best,
Carolyn

The latest news of work completed here at the Blake Archive. Apologies for
cross-posting. Please forward as appropriate. Matt K.

--

The editors of the William Blake Archive
<http://www.iath.virginia.edu/blake> are pleased to announce the publication
of seven new electronic editions of Blake's illuminated books. They are:

_The [First] Book of Urizen_ copy G
_The Book of Los_ copy A
_The Book of Ahania_ copy A
_The Song of Los_ copy B
_America, a Prophecy_ copy A
_Europe, a Prophecy_ copy E
_Visions of the Daughters of Albion_ copy F

We had announced _Urizen_ copy G as forthcoming two months ago, but
formatting the double-columned text diplomatically in SGML for both
Netscape and Internet Explorer proved more taxing and time consuming than
anticipated. Such are the joys and tribulations of electronic publishing.
Solving the problems there, though, ensured diplomatic transcriptions for
Blake's other books with double-columned texts, _The Book of Ahania_ and
_The Book of Los_. Together, these three works are often referred to as
Blake's Bible of Hell or, simply, the Urizen books. _Urizen_, of which
there are only seven extant copies, was first produced in 1794, color
printed to form copies A, C, D, E (untraced), F, and J. It was printed
again in 1795 to form copy B, which was produced as part of a set of
illuminated books printed on large paper, and then one last time in c.
1818 to form copy G, which was produced in Blake's late printing and
coloring style. The editors are currently working on copies A, B, C, and F
and expect to have them in the Archive by the end of the year. _The Book
of Ahania_ and _The Book of Los_ exist in unique copies, with only a few
proof impressions extant. They were printed in 1795 and executed in
intaglio instead of in relief etching, the technique Blake normally used
for his illuminated books. Although their texts are printed in
intaglio, their frontispieces are beautifully color printed from
the surface of the plates.

With _The Song of Los_, which consists of two parts entitled "Africa" and
"Asia," we complete Blake's other series of illuminated books,
sometimes known as the Continental Prophecies, begun in 1793 with
_America_ and continued in 1794 with _Europe_. The copy of _The Song of
Los_ included here is one of six extant; all were color printed in the
same printing session in 1795.

With fourteen complete copies extant, _America_ is not as rare as
these other illuminated books, but copy A, which was printed and
colored in 1795 as part of Blake's large-paper set of books, is, along
with copies K, O, and M, one of only four colored copies--
and it was the model for copy K. Moreover, only it and copy O have the
last four lines on plate 4, which was masked in the printing of the
other copies. The Archive will include copies M and O
(c. 1807 and 1818) later this year.

Only nine copies of _Europe_ are extant, and only two of those, copies H
and O (1795 and 1818), have plate 3, the Preludium. The Archive will
include both of these copies by the end of the year. Copy E, included
here, was lightly color printed on both sides of the paper in 1794 and
joins copy B, color printed more heavily on one side of the paper the same
year.

_Visions of the Daughters of Albion_ copy F is an exquisitely
beautiful copy, heavily color printed (especially its frontispiece) in c.
1794, and never before reproduced. It joins copies C and J
(both 1793), and will be joined later this year by copies G and P (1795
and 1818).

All of these editions have newly edited texts; all images in the editions
were scanned from either 4x5 or 8x10 transparencies, nearly all of which
were made specifically for the Archive. Like our other editions, these
are all SGML-encoded, fully searchable for both text and images and
supported by the unique Inote and ImageSizer applications described in our
previous updates.

The Archive now contains sixteen copies of ten illuminated books. In the
coming months, we will be adding copies of _All Religions are One_, _There
is No Natural Religion_, _For the Sexes_, _Milton_, and _Jerusalem_, along
with copies of books already in the Archive but from different printings.
Our goal is to have the entire illuminated canon online this year. In
addition, work continues on the SGML edition of David V. Erdman's
_Complete Poetry and Prose of William Blake_, which we anticipate
releasing sometime this spring.

I’m only getting to Silliman's post re MILLENNIUM II now, after too full a day
in the saltmines of the U.

My irritation at his post has not diminished, however, -- cheap shot is right,
as Jerry put it in his reply.

Here is someone who put together a large (600+ pages) anthology covering one
small neck of the poetic woods in one country (treed, as he is, in these
States) during one very limited period -- & included something like a hundred
names of those he couldn’t or wouldn’t include. Such a one should know better
than to hastily assess a somewhat larger (850 pages) book that tries to cover a
much wider period (postwar onward) on as global  a scale as possible, by making
an insta-list of those (mainly Americans) not included and dismissing the book
on those grounds.

The point is, an anthology, as any book, needs to be judged by what it is &
does , i.e. by the writing that it proposes, and not by what is is not, i.e.
does not include and didn’t mean to be. The fact that Silliman’s U.S. TREE
omits a great number of those American poets of that period _I_ think very
highly of, does _not_ diminish my interest and pleasure in his book. I’m not
interested in reading it for what I already know or am familiar with, but to
discover what I don’t yet know. Otherwise it’s all done with mirrors. So that
the pleasure & instruction Silliman’s book provided was to discover poets I
didn’t know or didn’t know well, or rediscovered inside the specific
articulation created by his book — & that, I believe, is or should be the aim
of any anthology.

The bitching about american-centeredness (a question we ourselves address in
the introduction, a fact neither mentioned nor discussed by Silliman, who seems
to have perused only the index, and even that rather shoddily -- some of the
poets he mentions as absent are in fact in the book) is odd when the post
itself is deaf & dumb in relation to what, finally, is core to MILLENNIUM,
namely its international intent, and the -- at least to Jerry & me --
fascinating and illuminating juxtapositions that happen in the process.

Again, the intent of the book is to map & link territories, to foreground areas
of experimentation, to point to ongoing possibilities,  NOT to do a headcount
of the best and brightest canonic or anti-canonic heads. In that sense,
Silliman’s critique is Vendleresque (though she would have, obviously, a
different list of individual poets not represented). ((There would, in this
respect, be another, more intelligent way of looking at “absences” — namely in
terms of strategic absences in a quasi ”official anthology” i.e. one  published
by a major University Press, with a telling subtitle.))

Given the to me surprising shoddiness of Silliman’s response, his critique is
not, as he would like to suggest, “devastating for [our] book's credibility” —
it is, unhappily, so only for his own critical acumen.

Sat's digest is full of great responses to my query.  Thanks to all.   I
was originally thinking of books that, instead of being surreptitious
rewritings of precursors, as Harold Bloom claims about everyone in
American poetry stuck on Emerson, do so quite overtly.

Don Byrd is right about this not being a genre per se.

Interesting list from Sillimon of omissions. Yet  this is not after all an
anthology of AMERICAN poetry,  but claims to represent much more.  While I
have a hard time seeing justification for Spicer's absence, on the whole
American poetry is OVERrepresented--unless we think the 70th most
significant American poet is more important than anyone from Spain or
Tunisia or numerous other nations.

Yet Poems for the Millenium is still a wonderful book, whatever its
flaws--what is there is valuable despite what isn't and should be.

so right.  This shit makes me insane.  I read a great article in, of all
places, Rolling Stone Magazine about John/Joan Case in which after a
botched circumcision, the parents of twins agreed to let the murderous
"sexologist" John Money turn the baby, not such a baby--18 mos--into a
girl.  It didn't work, John/Joan always felt he/she was male, and
finally forced the truth out of dad, sex changed back to male, was found
out in small town, ostracized, suicide attempts, and finally and
luckily a happy marriage but a tortured and destroyed psyche and
physique.  Money published lies about the success of the experiment and
is still employed and revered and taught.

Anne Fausto-Sterling (a feminist biologist who is well known in women's
studies) has done a lot of research on this stuff,  I think she might even
have a book out.  She claims that there are naturally 5 (did I get that
number right?) genders, and had some articles about this in popular media a
couple or so years ago.  She is very passionate and humane and quite
wonderful.  Anyone interested in this would be well advised to look her
stuff up.

And what this says about the two standard genders...

        We have reached the limits of poetry: Western people's ignorance of
traditionalist societies is too profound.  Like Alice Walker and Pratibha
Parmar working in West Africa, you could make a courageous film on the
subject.   Failing that, a poem might yet become a sort of film shot from a
distance, an attempt to project on to the air, via a beam of good wishes, an
imagined ceremony for the sake of young girls who are infibulated without
ceremony by nomad Somalians, almost on the move.


 The Infibulation Ceremony



A Jeep, its shock absorbers gone, thumps
across pocks in the level desert scrub
faster than the black-faced sheep with fat tails
prodded onwards by the nomad women.

If we have time and water
we stop and let the clan drink;
if we have neither we drive on
inventing our film about infibulation.

We drive up to a low escarpment
and look down on a hollow littered with people,
livestock scattered among the rocky slopes
by a well cairned with boulders.

Near this home well on their April journey
the women dismantle the hut sticks
from the ship slew of camel humps,
setting up Nissen huts of mats and skins.

Herded then by a man, disburdened
camels sigh and settle down
in the rubbled hollow of the home well
in the northern Somali Republic.

Off to the side -- we swivel the camera --
where thorns are piled for the fence
the nomads are busy at their camp
fastening the huts with bark ropes.

One little hut that's new
arrived on the coarse grass from the sky.
It's the virgin spirit placed there somehow,
dazzling the nomads with the sunshine on it.

They sew up its door flaps with the ropes
so no man may crawl through
a tiny slit left at the bottom
like a button hole in a Western shirt.

Then on dry highlands of Somalia
we set their young girls to go dancing
in virginity round the sutured hut:
this is their sorrow in private places.

 They dance in a hurt, stiff motion,
stick-legged as if avoiding stones
blood gleaming on brown thighs
tears in expressionless eyes.

The mouths of these children are silenced
by tradition: that they be made clean,
that they not become promiscuous,
that they be desirable for marriage

with a sewn vagina, stripped of pleasure,
crossed with thorns, as if the surgeons
had sutured the mouth of a healthy baby
leaving the palette uselessly cleft.

But this film is fantasy imagined from books
and my inability to suffer the thorns
that make religions stand erect, or that make
a temple's entrance so narrow.

We shoot the girls from a distance, telephoto,
forgetting the funds we raised in Britain,
forgetting the clan-lords warring in Mogadishu,
forgetting the entrenchment of Islam

into hard-line law, here called Shafi'i;
while the West threatens Islam with bombs
or rich products bearing our labels,
may our Jeeps not insult their culture.

We know these illiterates will never see our film;
so will the children make their children dance
that queer dance in this cinema-wilderness?
Our Jeep moves on, its tracks soon blown over.

The film is more penetrant than propaganda;
for it shows the silence here
and the thorny look in the girls' eyes;
it shows the male wind, harsh, hot.

                     [Dancing and film imagery influenced by Alice Walker's and
                        Pratibha Parmar's work in West Africa.  I have recently learnt
                        that the self-declared independent Republic of Somaliland, whose
                        capital is Hargeisa in the north-west, has been trying to eradicate
                        female circumcision by 2000 and that UNICEF is backing them.]

I have always been one of the first to recognise US poetic/artistic
achievements and cultural generosity.  But it may be helpful to say that, as a
Brit living in Paris; I find the tone of much of this anthology squabble
absurd.  As I've been left out of the very narrow Brit contribution I have no
axe to grind when I say that most US poets have been just blind to what the
anthology has done. For the first time ever an anthology this size is truly
international.  So far, the debate reminds me of the closing week of
Maastricht Treaty discussions when, with so many Third World countries,
especially in Africa, cast into client status by US-European gerrymandered
global trading regulations, the US and French delegations hogged nearly all
the debating time for snarls over the cinema and soy bean industries.

Do we have to have more of this US neo-colonialism about an anthology already
dominated by one nation whose denizens seem to want more of the action yet?

I can see bias in the selections as easily as anyone else: what did anyone
expect with a window on the world this wide -- the anthologist as universal
mind?  An anthology is always a way-stage, not an eternal inscription on the
final peristyle.  Fergodssake stop griping, respect what a grind it is for
editors both to retrieve so much good poetry from all over, and to hold out,
in the teeth of such attitudes, such hope of the more vital internationalism
to come.  For surely that's the real avant-garde?

Greetings, nonetheless.

I haven't seen the second volume of the new anthology but a reliable
source tells me that its introduction emphasizes that it was not
intended to be a "best of" collection.  Ergo, though it leaves out
a lot of poets I would have liked to have seen in it, and has a number
of poets in it that seem second-rate to me, I applaud it.  It took on an
impossible job and seems to have done it about as well as the job
could have been done.

I am not at all certain what you are saying. Are you saying that as sarcasm
or as fact ?  It is not quite clear where you yourself stand on the matter.

It seems to me to be a very complicated, but essential, question, verging
closely into the question of the very nature of poetics and the functions of
poetic expression. I do not want to belabour the matter, but I feel a need
to say what I feel needs to be said and then leave it to dispute.

First of all, western (meaning western European and North American),
ethnography, anthropology, sociology, studies of comparative religions and
philosophies, are definitely the best in the world and a large part of
those truly attempt and sometimes succeed at being impartial, objective,
rigorous and scientific.

As to the pragmatic worth, or value, of ANY traditional practice we
might also ask about it in terms of evaluation:

1).   Does it increase the greatest sustainable freedoms for the greatest
      number of persons ?  (Nothing has ever truly achieved this ideal.)

2).   Does it provide a positive, truly wanted, freedom ?  For instance even
      a seemingly silly practice such as the wearing of purple robes with
      white polka dots on them can be a positive provision of a truly wanted
      freedom if someone wants to wear such robes within a society. The
      individual is made free to wear those robes, without incurring harm
      from others, by means of a social practice that sustains that freedom.
      That social practice is not immediately obvious, but is the basis for
      the freedom to wear purple robes with white polka dots, as well as
      being the basis for other specific expressions of freedom.

3).   Does it provide a freedom to some that does not significantly harm the
freedoms of others, including the freedom from enduring added
psychological and/or physical suffering. For instance the dervish
      might be free to dance a dervish, but not to force others to do the
      same. On the other hand, Pythagorean forbidding the eating
      of beans is unthinkable, as beans are a source of well being to many.
      The Pythagorean cannot be allowed to force his ways on others, taking
      away their freedom to eat beans. However, the Pythagorean could be
      free to not eat beans.

3).   Does it impose real psychological and/or physical sufferings that are
      otherwise avertable, or that would not otherwise occur ?

4).   Does it prevent real psychological and/or physical sufferings that
      are unwanted by the sufferers and are averted by the practice ?

If the practice does not provide and/or sustain a positive, truly wanted,
freedom, and/or if the practice causes physical and/or psychological
sufferings that would otherwise have been averted, then surely the practice
cannot claim "right". Likewise if the practice does not truly, effectively,
prevent unwanted increase in psychological and/or physical sufferings, as a
negative freedom from those unwanted sufferings, then it cannot claim
"right". The practice then is surely at best dysfunctional and at worst
completely oppressive. (Though we might always fall short of the ideals.)

We might examine any practice in a similar kind of manner.

I think that we need to realize that traditional practices are often more
wrong than right. We still tend to revert to the idea that everything
traditional is of value, including every brutal and uncivilized practice
derived from ancient ignorance. Simply because something is traditional,
cannot make it right, or best, or even good. Neither can the fact that that
is how everyone does it. Everyone could be wrong. We have to be more
critical of our own institutions, our own customs, our own beliefs, in the
name of progress, as well as being objectively critical of the institutions,
practices, customs, and beliefs of other cultures. We cannot simply accept
them because they are other than our own. We certainly cannot give them more
acceptance as if that is the appropriate response to what is more alien
rather than objective, critical, evaluation.

The practice of female circumcision is a practice of extreme barbarity.
There is no way that any justification can be given to it. It is clearly
physically and psychologically extremely damaging to those who suffer it and
in a number of ways that even the most unbiased science can clearly prove.
No amount of ideological argument can overcome that fact, no matter how
twisted the use of ideas and language that attempts to maintain and
promote the traditional, the customary, it still remains the same ignorance.

Do we fail at respect for the sufferings of the sufferers of a barbaric
practice when we make light of it, joke about it, revert to sarcasm ? Do we
make it less
of an issue, and less worthy of discussion ?  Depending on how a poem is
written, does the poetic medium tend to do that also, in some instances ? Do
such methods sometimes add to the linguistic quagmire, and thus ignorance ?

The discussion began as a discussion of that ignorance. I began to wonder if
we know what freedom is. I began to wonder why we equate freedom with the
imposition of suffering, rather than its alleviation, as if belief in
freedom essentially ought to be a belief in freeing people to their causing
others to suffer unwanted sufferings - such as in the Afghanistani
situation, or in the instance of female circumcision. Freedom to oppression,
totalism, and barbaric practices, seems as horrible to me as the freedom
from food, water, sleep, shelter and love would be. A purely negative and
destructive freedom.

A poem as to the barbarity of some practice, might make a difference,
if those who suffer that practice become aware of that poem, and begin
to see the world differently. If it shows them that their suffering is
not necessary, and that the arguments to the contrary need not prevail
against Reason. If it shows them that their suffering is not an integral
part of who they are, contrary to what their tradition and their elders
claim against them. If it shows them that there are more humane, gentler,
kinder, better ways to love and live....

There are very few such poems.

....but can a poem change a whole culture ?

There are perhaps no such poems (in the sense of truly positive changes).

Or is there a point where the Reason plus emotion comprising the empathies
of the poetic medium, break down as to pragmatism and we must revert
to more prosaic means ?  Is the poem as liberating as it claims to be,
or do we, in such matters need to revert to more liberating means and ways
that are more directly and easily understood by those who have no knowledge
of poetry as we know it ?

I think the answer is obvious as to the limited function of poetry.

I wonder what people, or what nation, will in fact achieve the bringing of
genuine freedoms, to the understanding and practices of the world, and stand
against their own tendencies towards traditionalism as well as against the
barbaric, horrific, traditionalisms that encroach upon those freedoms in so
many parts of the world. Is the United States of America to become that
voice, or the United Nations, or both ?  Or some other voice crying in the
wilderness of too many archaisms, and traditional barbarities, to even take
a count of ?  The world is very savage, under its thin veneer of civilization,
in part because it does not have a clear idea, poetic or prosaic, of freedom.

MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII

What follows is the text of an invitation, extended over e-mail, to the
grad student community at SUNY-Buffalo.

forwarded text (from UB grad, Jim O'Loughlin):

I would like to invite all English graduate students to attend a
celebration of the life and work of Daniel Kanyandekwe, a collegue of ours
who passed away last year.  The celebration will feature readings from
Daniel's novels, remembrances of Daniel, and Rwandan food and music.  It
begins this Sunday at 2:30 at Hallwalls.  $5 for students/$10 gen. ad.
All proceeds go to Daniel's estate.

I hope all of Daniel's friends will make an effort to attend this event.
But even if you didn't know Daniel, please consider attending and learning
about this talented author and scholar.  His writing was both outrageously
funny and poignant.  We hope this event will highlight those elements of
his work and his life.

(end forwarded text)

Daniel Kanyandekwe left behind a wife and a young child. His wife had come
over to the United States recently from Rwanda (around the time of the
genocide) and they had been living in south Florida, where Daniel was
teaching at a small college. As far as I know, they lost their entire
family and she has no relatives in the U.S. Her immigration status is
unclear. Hopefully, this situation will be straightened out, but nothing
can make up for the loss of Daniel, in his early 30s, to a sudden stroke.

Meow Press has published a chapbook of Daniel's writing, and it will be
available today at the memorial. It will also be available, as part of the
regular Meow Press series, with all sales to benefit his family. Please,
if you can, order this book. Backchannel me if you are interested in
contributing to help support this family, now in a precarious position.
After today, I should have information about where to send checks, etc.

In the meantime, here is the introduction to the chapbook, by Julie
Husband and Jim O'Loughlin, who also edited Daniel's work for this
publication:

"Writer, scholar, husband and father, Daniel Kanyandekwe (1963-1997) was
also friend to many in Buffalo during the five years he and his family
spent here. Arriving from Rwanda in 1992, Daniel began studying in the UB
English Department as a Fulbright fellow. During the five years he spent
at UB, Daniel not only completed his Ph. D. dissertation, Dreaming of
Africa: American Writers and Africa in the Twentieth Century, but wrote
four novels, The Last Writer, The Buttocks of the Almighty, Seasons of the
Eternal Grooms Death, and The Chronicles of Melancholy.

"This collection offers selections from Daniels last three novels.
Influenced by writers including Saul Bellow, Gabriel Garca Mrquez and
Ngugi wa Thiongo, Daniel created characters who were both larger than life
and devastatingly flawed. An undercurrent of political commentary runs
throughout all these novels, which are set in Daniels native Rwanda. In
his fiction, Daniel created worlds of magic and great humor; worlds in
which anything could, and did, happen."

I've cut and pasted this text from quark xpress, so my apologies for the
failure of some of the above typography. Ok, here is the first paragraph
of the selection from _The Buttocks of the Almighty_:

"After the defense of his dissertation, Beatitudinis Philosophiarum
Historiae (A Short History of the Philosophies of Happiness), during which
defense the greatest Latinist of the Pontifical Gregorian University dies
of a heart attack, Father Moses Bazirishuli, S. J., is struck by a severe
mental breakdown. Soon, he leaves the Vatican and returns to Kigali,
Rwanda, where he settles in a small convent with two other Jesuits, one a
Rwandan who is dying of stomach ulcers, the other a Belgian who will
eventually die of shame after it has been discovered that the book he
reads all night long is not Le Roman de la rose, but the erotic Arabian
classic, The Perfumed Garden. After he has lost one testicle to surgery
(he has prostate cancer), Moses incurable migraines will finally lead him
to a mental asylum. Having been raped by a female patient, he totally
loses his mind. Thats when he takes refuge in the prehistoric caves of
Mount Kigali with Animus, his faithful dog, whence he will emerge with a
mythic phallus on his shoulders, causing the bodyguards of the Patriarch
President to shoot the scared mob. Moses (and his dog) will be the only
survivors of the civil war that he himself has caused, and from which the
United Nations peacekeeping forces, led by the Marines, will flee, only to
return when the violence has abated."


Please order this lovely little chapbook. Contact me privately and I will
indicate where to send donations. The cost will be $5, but please, if you
can, send more.

Thanks for your help.

I'm a bit behind, but Henry Gould wrote the other day:

<<Ronald Johnson erases parts of PARADISE LOST in order to produce RADI OS.
Was it necessary in order to write ARK?  There are serious poets who can't
take poetry seriously in an uneraserious era.  Or perhaps this was a serious
endeavor and I'm being obtuse again.>>

Well, I wouldnt know about the last, but I do know that RADI OS struck me
as a wonderfully spiritual poem when I first read it & it remains a
favorite. I'd say it was a very serious endeavor. I'd agree with Guy
Davenport that it makes Milton feel a lot like Rilke, & to me that's a good
thing...

I was wondering, then, if what we're talking about is a kind of rhizomatic
effect (or effort): not a separate genre in any way, as Don Byrd pointed
out, but a way, a kind of writing withing many genres that can appear
anywhere...

There's an understandable reflex when the U.S. finds fault in other
parts of the world--various infringements on freedom, political
prisoners, destructive practices--to point to the faults right here
at home: the gun violence, the high rates of incarceration, the economic
inequality. And what about the still-widespread practice of circumcision
of male infants?  The idea is that we should leave others' faults alone
and deal with our own, with a suggestion that in criticizing others
we make it easier not to face what's happening here. I don't think we should
stop protesting what conflicts with our values when we perceive it as an
intolerable violation. I think there is quite a bit of evidence that this kind
of public condemnation along with political pressures has aided, sometimes,

those in other countries working toward a Western ideal of personal freedom
in a democracy (for these ideas are not stale and played out for everyone).
I do not think that to cease objecting to what we feel are outrages in
other parts of the world will focus any more attention on injustices here.
On the contrary. I think that when we accuse others, and then in turn
are (often rightfully) accused, we see our crimes much better, which had
grown so familiar and habitual.  It does strike me as ironic sometimes
that the Enlightenment self and its ideals, its emphasis on the rights
of the individual, are seen by so many contemporary intellectuals as
nothing but a self/suit tailored for the alienation of capitalism.
In China, the protesters in Tianemen [sic] square were drawing on
those very ideals, as they imagined were held and lived in the U.S.
Let me insist on that as irony not nostalgia, as I have seen how many
tomes can be filled with an attempt to rescue the Enlightenment
Project, how many thousands and thousands of pages, and not succeed.

I apologize for the kind of musing generalities which can occur
while one imagines one is talking only to himself, while outside
a cool rain is falling.

         If I had edited _Poems for the Millennium_, I would have
included Spicer, and there are other things I would have done
differently, but I want to make two quick points to make:

        1. If some thing like _Poems for the Millennium_ had been
available when I was eighteen, it would have saved me years of work.
There was nothing remotely comparable then, and there has not been
anything like it until now.

        2.  One certainly can fault the project for lack of ambition.
If it is half successful, it is more than any one could reasonably
expect.  And by  any test, this antholody is more than half successful.

            For whatever nit-picking I might do, I want to congratulate
Jerry and Pierre on a remarkable accomplishment and to thank them for
these beautiful books.

dear superior intelligences,

ok, so i canNOT locate the source of the following lines:

   'And up the rosy pathway to her heart
    The uncapped pilgrim crept.'

it may be that these lines are in fact not sourceable --
ie, that they are made up.  their unreliable narrator attributes
them to a romantic poet (byron, as it happens), but a search of
databases & books & expert brains has exhausted that possibility --
not to mention me.

if these lines seem familiar & you can point me to their source,
you will have my unfailing gratitude and admiration -- as well as
the satisfaction of spreading knowledge like a sinking star, etc.

thanks benightedly,

Responding to Doug Barbour: not having read Radi Os, my skeptical comments
really WERE obtuse.  I guess I would have to be convinced that obvious
"writing over" is not a sort of cliche of postmodernism.  Postmodernism
as the willful/despairing prodigal child of modernism.  Without the
resources to create, only to rewrite and imitate.  An era in opposition
to the "certainties" of the modernists, whose artists are serious by
being unserious.  The era of Criticism and Theory which is passing away
as we scribble.  (cross out?)  - Henry Gould

BEYOND THE PAGE PRESENTS:

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE:

What:  Beyond the Page kicks off its series of monthly performance and arts
       events with a poetry reading featuring Ron Silliman and Rae Armantrout.

Where: Faultline Theatre, 3152 5th Avenue (between Thorn and Spruce in
       Hillcrest), San Diego.

When:  Sunday, May 3rd. 4:00 PM.

Contact: Stephen Cope at (619) 298-8911 or Joe Ross at (619) 291-8984.
E-mail at
         scope@ucsd.edu.


RON SILLIMAN , a central figure in the L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E poetry movement, has
been writing and publishing poetry and criticism for nearly three decades.
In the 1980's,  Silliman edited  IN THE AMERICAN TREE, a seminal anthology
which gathered together close to forty of the most influential American
writers of the latter half of this century.  For several years, Silliman
also served as editor of THE SOCIALIST REVIEW, a major political voice of
the American left. David Melnick writes of his work: "Called a
'thraumaturge' ('wonder-worker') by the poet Robert Duncan, Silliman has
created a new kind of writing from the simplest materials... The poet
confides, describes, extols, remarks, puns, paints domestic scenes, shyly
alludes, records minutiae, leaps to large statements, arouses, repeats.
Through it all, a friendly, Northern California sort of personality
emerges." Of himself, in a wry tone indicative of his poetry,  Silliman
writes: "Ron Silliman was a member of 'Rupe's troops' back in the
anti-glory days of  the Pods' '82 season. A left-handed second baseman who
wears trifocals, he has had to settle for publishing 21 books of poetry and
criticism, and now 'does theory' in the computer industry. He has been
writing the same poem for 24 years." Silliman currently lives in the
Philadelphia area, and makes only rare appearances on the West Coast.

RAE ARMANTROUT needs little introduction in the San Diego poetry community.
Raised in San Diego, Armantrout received a degree in writing from San
Francisco State before moving back to San Diego, where she currently
teaches writing at The University of California, San Diego. To date, she
has published six books of poetry, and two more are forthcoming: TRUE (a
memoir due out in July from Atelos Press), and THE PRETEXT (due out next
year from Sun & Moon).  Armantrout's work has appeared in numerous journals
and anthologies, including IN THE AMERICAN TREE, THE BEST AMERICAN POETRY
OF 1988, and THE NORTON ANTHOLOGY OF POSTMODERN AMERICAN POETRY.
Armantrout's poetry is lyrically concise, often humorous, and always daring
and imaginative. As Elaine Equi puts it: "At a time when much experimental
writing has lost at least some of its shock value, Rae Armantrout's [work]
could startle even the most jaded reader."

Armantrout and Silliman are internationally recognized figures in
contemporary American poetry, and both are lively and engaging readers.
Beyond the Page is proud to inaugurate its ongoing performance and arts
series with this major literary event.

BEYOND THE PAGE is an independent arts group dedicated to the promotion of
experimental and explorative work in contemporary arts. For more

Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

I too have yet to see the second volume, and at Canadian dollar rates it may
be somewhat expensive. But frankly I don't give a damn who might be left out
-- there's bound to be a zillion such. What was and is so amazing about the
first volume is the sheer range of selection, and, well, its absolutely
great instructiveness. It's not simply that the book included so many poets
who's work I simply did not know at all, because I'd never heard of it at
all -- that's a major accomplishment in my book, and I learned how closed my
eyes have been not only to those writing in a language other than my own,
but also in the language I somewhat absurdly call my my own. But when I
turned to familiar names and voices, lo and behold, the selections were not
indeed what I expected or would have chosen, and often I found myself as a
result rethinking and hence rereading that particular poet. Add to that the
really informative juxtapositions and the book turns into what I'd think of
as a PERFECT anthology, because it refused to let me sit inside my own
complacent knowing.

    So I used it as a tectbook in the term just over, to a second-year
(sophomore) undergraduate course "Introduction to Poetry" designed for all
those poor kids who could not get into the Faculty of Arts elective they
wanted -- 56 students, over half of them reluctant and resentful, slouching
in their chairs challenging "Teach Me!", made this in many ways the course
from hell, since you're trying to teach them, among other things, how to pay
attention to their own responses, rather than the institution's imagined
ones. Move them off their butts. It was a tough book to teach from, but I
enjoyed it, and learned from it. And by the end of the course half those
reluctant kids who thought poetry was sissy and a waste of time and nothing
to do with the Bottom Line were indeed goggling over the work, talking about
it enthusiastically, bringing their favourite poems to the attention of
their fellows (rare indeed to do this over Spenser or Wyattor Clare, no
matter how great my love of those poets). NO-ONE, and I do mean no-one, by
the end of this difficult course -- which is to say, yes, this difficult
book -- was fretting over what he or she ought to be saying, or about
something called "metrics" which had been drummed into them in high school
and freshman English, or worriting that they didn't LIKE all the poems, but
instead puzzled over -- and delighted in an awed sort of way -- over
Mandelstam, Mallarme, Ullikummi, Miyasawa Kenji and Edith Sodergran and and
and. My Japanese Canadian students gave little discourses on how poems might
be translated, and the problems attendant on ideograms; the Quebecois
discussed linguistic practices in Francis Ponge; someone SANG Kurt
Schwitters, etc etc. Need I go on?

   These anthologies -- cetrtainly the first volume, at any rate --
completely redefine and re-vision the work of this century and what it
proposes; the commentaries are superbly unostentatious, and the difficult
but finally utterly intense pleasures afforded by teaching it are absolutely
without parallel in my what? nearly four decades of teaching this usually
rather miserable second-year course. Would we had a dozen such anthologies
like this -- it truly rethinks the world we think we know.

It made me work, work, work, read read read. If the second volume is a tenth
as good then obviously I've got to get it, and I'll go down to the store
tomorrow.  It doesn't have Spicer? Then I'll xerox an Inuit poem instead.

I don't know, Ron: you certainly set a huge elephant among the pigeons with
that (rather heavy-dentured tongue in cheek?) caveat. Made us pay attention,
hooray, to something worth attending. Thanks.

And of course, Pierre, Jerry, awed congratulations.

An anthology proposing to be complete would need to embody the cosmos (not
to mention any number of elsuive, duplicitous muses). Millenium I and
Millenium II propose the next best thing: a range of compelling precedent
and the grounds for further research. I've always thought of anthologies as
beginnings and not ends, and thus with many on this list I would testify
that Jerry's and Pierre's anthology brought more new work to my attention
than any comparable endeavor that I have yet encountered.

We have legislated today that no rhubarb will be grown, transported, or
kept, by any person or organization, and furthermore that no rhubarb is to
be prepared, and served in any facility meant for the preparation and
serving of foodstuffs.

We do not care that you like rhubarb.

News to me. On Wednesday night I was having dinner with Carolyn Burke,
author of the highly recommended Mina Loy biography "Becoming Modern", who
gave a lecture on her book the next day for the Poetics Program at UB.
Hadn't heard about the White House event till the report surfaced here.

As Morpheal's reading of my 'The Infibulation Ceremony' is such a serious
misreading of my poem, I feel bound to reply.  To be generous, I think it's
sheer depth of concern at such barbaric practices that has created this
blindness to what is actually written - the claims that the poem is either
complicit with female circumcision or sarcastic dumbfound me.  Simply, I am
totally against infibulation.
        The poem arose from my researches into a feminist group of doctors and social
workers here in Paris who wrestle with the clandestine infibulation practiced
particularly by Francophone West African groups in France.  Another group has
brought occasional court actions (which I am also in favour of where
appropriate), since infibulation is illegal in France. The problem is that
it's previously-infibulated mothers who want the operation for their daughters
and who think it deeply wrong not to carry it out.  The group has to work with
incredible tact in clinics to point out infibulation's drawbacks, dangers, and
cruelty, hoping by gradual persuasion to change beliefs that have been
ingrained for century upon century.  As I was doing this research, a friend of
my daughter's was working in Somalia to spread anti-infibulation information.
There were problems which I should perhaps not publicise here.  All this did
make it clear to me that insensitivity to local cultures is unproductive in
creating social change on this issue.  So I do not believe that thinking one's
own culture is sort of world-superior is effective either, even though in this
respect it clearly is superior.
        My headnote says that poetry has reached one of its limits. There's no
suggestion that attempts actually to get the practice banned have reached
their limit at all.  But, obviously, no Somalian is going to be affected by my
poem, and in any case a Western poem - trapped in its own culture - can't,
much as it might like to, penetrate to the heart of the traditional-Islamic
beliefs where the problem originates.
Since the Western poet is so ineffectual unless he/she becomes an
international social worker (or acts courageously like Alice Walker and
Pratibha Parmar and makes a film) I go on to explore what a mere poem might
usefully do. One of poetry's various effective political roles is to make an
issue vivid - in this case, the cruelty and robbing of the feminine birthright
through male-dominated religious practices are, I would hope, vivid.

Wait a minute! On Wednesday night I saw Charles Bernstein coming out of a
7-11 eating a burrito and talking to Elvis (The latter by the way was
doing a credible WH Auden impression).

I have sympathy with this impulse.  At the same time, it can't never be
that simple....The Millenium represents an enormous output of resources.
"There's always room for" many things in the world of poetry.  But the
*capital* to manufacture and market and distribute, that's something else
again, and the understanding that very few endeavors will get the profile
and visibility of an anthology like this, has much to do with severity of
critical response.  That, plus the monumentality of the set's design and
tone; it is hard not to judge it as a "pocket canon."  As Golding's
brilliant book reminds us, an anthology is never just an anthology.  But
one this ambitious and sweeping is even more about totality than usual!

That being said, it is brilliant, astonishing, and gives us an amazingly
complex and provocative occasion to think about poetries, about where we
stand.

And that being said, there is something else: there is less a Will to
Canon in this anthology than in most; it is in some respects partisan for
a series of tones and missions, and strategies, more than for any slate of
poets.  That's the significance of the inclusion of the so-called oral
poets.  In very large part that section "fails" on some very specific
level...For reasons I've mentioned before here: like the high school
teachers who periodically try to teach lyrics from the likes of
Lennon/McCartney or Dylan as on-the-page "poetry" to their classes, the
editors have left behind too much of the art and guts of these musician's
work; they've fundementally misapprehended what they are doing; they might
as well (after all, think of A) have included some Bartok scores.  But I
wasn't surprised at the "oral" section.  It has more meaning for what it
is trying to demonstrate about directions, than for the quality of the
work, as given on the page. This is always the problem (one of 'em) with
ethnopoetix; it is also always its promise (..the promise of very
unexpected directions..)

Thus, both inclusions and exclusions are in cases flawed;  even very very
flawed.  It is surprising how little difference this makes.  In
some respects the work relates as much to America a Prophecy as it does to
American Tree or Pomo Norton...It is meant to be (and is) visionary.
Perloff I think it is, (who else?) who makes the provocative suggestion
that A Prophecy is better thought of as parallel to the Cantos, than as an
anthology as we normally mean the word.  A poem.  Some of the same intent
is here.

i've been wanting to wait until i had volume two in hand before i posted in
on this thread... but peter q's post draws me out early, in part b/c it's
clear at this point, from everything posted thus far, that ron's
complaint---though i like spicer and lennon & mccartney and (ron too!) and
on & on---likely misses the mark (sorry ron)... not having volume two in
hand, this is a bit presumptuous on my part... but one way to understand
what i'm saying is to have a look at the classroom, as peter has done (don
b indicated as much)...

when i opened volume one my eyeballs damn near popped out of my head---this
was an exercise in humility (you'll forgive me the christian overtones)...
and having used this volume as a sort of prompt in my creative writing
class this past semester, i can attest to its usefulness with students,
most of whom begin with no idea why anyone would even BOTHER toying with
words (i have no majors---all of my students this semester are aspiring
engineers/science/architecture majors)... mind you:  i have to use a text
that appeals to white kids, to black kids, to latino kids, to asian kids...
to women and to men... to international students... to kids from the
upper-classes, middle classes, and working classes...

some of you will no doubt find this an all-too-easy nod in directions
mulicultural... but hey, guess what?---jerry and pierre's book WORKS in
this context... it answers to the *stated* desires, on the part of some of
these students anyway, that they read writing from what they identify as
their respective cultures/niches... and through its juxtapositions, it
illustrates how these various cultural products are both different and
similar---a necessary lesson in understanding oneself, locally and
globally...

but it's not just that the book has been great in the classroom---again, MY
eyeballs damn near etc... i found MYself ashamed of MY global illiteracy
(as 'twere), and though i am surely no exemplar of cultivation, i think it
fair and necessary to observe that, twixt text and commentary, any poet
picking up this book is bound to learn a good deal...

great work, guyz!...

eagerly awaiting volume two///

Another reading announcement:

Wednesday April 29 at 6 PM at the Chicago Art Institute's Poetry Center

Debra Bruce will be reading with me, John Frederick Nims, and oral-based
performance poet Cin Salach.  It's a start--a broader spectrum of formalist

Interesting comment and right on target.

To traditionalist Islamic believers, as far as I know, your poem is Satanic
and would be awoved to have the exact opposite effect that you claim for it.
The very use of a western style poem makes your opinion wrong in their
viewpoint.

Wierd logic, but as far as I know, that logic holds true in their system.

I think both Islam and tradition are getting a bad rap here.  Not every
traditionalist Islamic believer believes in female genital mutilation.  And
_which_ tradition?  There is a tendency to pretend that only the most rigid
belief/behavior systems have roots in tradition.  But many of these
represent quite radical shifts from long-standing less rigid traditions ---
for example, what is going on in Afghanistan right now is a radical shift
from local practice.

I also question the interpretation of "the very use of a western style
poem,"  but will leave that to others who know more about cross-cultural
borrowings.

        Well, to me anthologizing is to trace the history of a genre or
genres which will inevitably reflect the ideeological situations and
tendencies of those doing the doing of it.  The reason for these sorts of
"alerts" is to validate these situations to those whose ideological
situations don't particularly pertain.  A forum such as this list seems a
fine place to do this.  Another anthology seems inferior.  Small magazines
might be one place to do this.  They are anthologies in a sense whereas
they have the advantage of consistently ammending their entries, or at
least the opportunity for a more dialogical representation of the history
of the genres they present.             Patrick F. Durgin

Subject:      The Book of Spicer
MIME-version: 1.0
Content-type: TEXT/PLAIN; CHARSET=US-ASCII

Since I have not yet popped for Millineum II, the following frivolous
thought experiment is tangential at best to the remarks thus far about the
anthology.  I forget who joked about solving the incompleteness problem by
copying some poems of your favorite missing poet and inserting them into
your favorite anthology, but after that post, I found myself wondering how I
would anthologize Spicer, and spent some time rereading the Collected Books
to that end.

I give some authority to Spicer's claim, credited to Duncan and restated in
the letter to Robin Blaser included in Admonitions, that "a poem is never to
be judged by itself alone," meaning in part that the sequences or "books"
in which his poems occur are the unit of value that Spicer is judging himself
by, in so far as he is concerned that his reading of himself should be of use
to another reader.  Which in turn means, perhaps, that the anthologist of
Spicer does not honor or test this claim unless entire sequences or books
are selected.  If I take this idea seriously, then I cannot anthologize
Spicer by selecting the best bits form this or that sequence.  The
sequence that I would most want to anthologize is "Homage to Creeley/
Explanatory Notes" especially because it would challenge the formatting
skills of the editor: but I assume that this text is too long for an
anthology and I would not want to take only one of its three parts and leave
the others behind.  So what next?

I like that Messerli reprints all of "Thing Language" but would have
preferred to see all of at least one other sequence included instead of
just context-less selected poems.  I like the way that "Love Poems"
follows upon "Thing Language" but if these two sequences from Language
are chosen, then what about the other sequences after that, since the echoes
and patterns carry on throughout the entire "book"?  Because Language (the
book) seems to fall into two parts (as the Intermissions section practically
insists), does the anthologist who believes this book to be most praiseworthy
choose a section from the first "half" (this word is problematic) and a
section from the second half and leave it at that?  Or should just a large
portion of one half be used?  The problem with the second choice is that it
distorts too much Spicer's range: for example, Hoover's choice of "Morphemics"
and "Phonemics" makes Spicer seem more ponderous than he really is, and what
is a selection of Spicer worth with humor or references to baseball?

Perhaps using "Four Poems for The St. Louis Sporting News" and throw in
"Fifteen False Propositions Against God" might be the most efficient way
to anthologize Spicer.  But then, the efficiency of the anthologist is not
the efficiency of the poet.  And my selections are capitulations more than
commitments.  The thought-experiment, however, has given me a new appreciation
for the difficulty of the anthologist's work, most of which is invisible in
the final product.

Anyone want to propose another Book of Spicer?

(sorry, end of penultimate paragraph should read "without humor etc.")

Subject:      mostly concerning The Book of Absences
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

1) Spicer is definitely an hard-to-swallow omission (esp. as Duncan gets to
close the vol.), and I woulda thought some selections from Grenier's
'Sentences' would have fit well w/ the visual/materialist tendencies
explored in the anthology, as well as counting as a stated precursor of
langpo.  As for the long list of the (mostly) living that Ron S. gave, I
can't see, given the book's global theater of operations and 50-yr
time-frame, how one could justify including several more American poets who
come from one lineage (the post-langpo diaspora) at the expense of the rest
of the world.  Inman yes, Moriarty no?  How would you ever decide, at
relatively little historical distance?  I'd also note that the editors'
introduction recognizes many of these problems, especially regarding their
admission that they are in this case, in contrast w/ Vol. 1, not only
witnesses but partisans to the chunk of history at hand.  This last fact
presumably has much to do with our capacity to carp at what's in and out in
the case.  Hey, I miss Ron Padgett, but I can close the book and go get one
of his from my bookshelf, which I for one cannot do w/ the Cobra poets, or
Adonis, or Dib.  You can't have everything.

2) Does anyone know what Ron meant (Ron, for example) by "the antipoetics of
song"?  Isn't it more of a 'parallel' poetics, like that of vizpo?

3) I do have a very minor complaint about the inclusion of the Tom Waits lyric.
The lineation of "Swordfishtrombone" in the anthology is taken from the
lyric sheet of the same name.  As far as I can tell, the line-breaks on this
lyric sheet are a design convenience (all the album's lyrics are fit into a
certain column length).  The point--the line breaks have nothing, so far as
I can tell to do with the lyric's metric, much less Waits' vocal phrasing in
performance.  Given that much attention was evidently paid to how Robt.
Johnson's lyric was set on the page (reproduced from -The Blues Line-, I'm
assuming), and Waits' lyric is being presented -as an oral poem-, shouldn't
the line breaks have had something to do with the sung rhythm?  Ron S. may
be right here in saying that the presentation makes Waits seem dumber than
he is.

4) Speaking of song, with respect to the 'writing through' (anti?)genre,
someone mentioned Stephen Ratcliffe's -Campion On Song-.  Can someone supply
a citation?  I don't even know if this was a book or something that appeared
in a magazine.  Please advise.

I have to say that I am more satisfied with Volume I than Volume II (of
poems for the Millenium)  I have a book review coming out soon, which I
will give information about when it has appeared, in which I explain my
reasons.  In brief, Volume I is amazing because of its juxtapositions and
inclusions. It has "high modernism" (Rilke or Yeats) along side of Dada
and negritude. It allows for a marvelously  complex understanding of
literary modernism.

Volume II, filled with wonders as it is (Joris' translations of Celan,
Beat Poetry, Brazilian concrete poetry, Italian novissimi, Language poets,
Frank O'Hara, etc...) does not allow for the same sort of ideological
contrasts, because it seem more governed by sectarian interests. You don't
get to compare Merrill to Ashbery, or Auden to O'Hara. Pretending that
rival traditions simply don't exist creates wierd distortions. In
particular, the anthologists prefer a mode that I call the "ethnographic
sublime," in a sense betting that this will be THE tradition of postmodern
poetry. The bad poetry in the book tends to be written in this particular
mode.

I prefer a book like Shaking the Pumpkin, more limited in scope, and that
doesn't carry around the baggage of being "THE University of California
Book of mod. and postmod. poetry." This is too much of a burden for any
tome to bear.

I tend to hate anthologies anyway. They are basically interventions into
literary politics that don't appeal to me as a reader.

Judy,  doesn't she teach at brown?  i think her fivesome is divided up into
boys, girls, ferms (more female hermaphrodite), herms ("true" hermaphrodite),
& merms (more male hermaphrodite).  not a good idea in my mind.  why pin it
down?  and reportedly not one that makes intersexuals too happy.

New York Sends Up Red Flag


            By Jennifer Nix
            NEW YORK (Variety) - One suspects that Karl Marx will be
having quite a chuckle this May Day.
            Wall Street will be festooned with red flags and banners
citing passages from, of all things, ``The Communist
Manifesto,'' Marx's political call-to-arms, co-written with
Frederick Engels.
            Marking the 150th anniversary of the original 23-page
pamphlet, Verso Books is publishing a special edition, with a
brand-new introduction and jacket illustration by the trendy art
duo, Komar and Melamid.
            Given the Commie chic marketing possibilities for the book,
Verso publisher Colin Robinson set Intl. Workers Day (May 1) as
the official publication date, and has convinced Waldenbooks on
Wall Street and Broadway to do some irony-drenched promotion.
            Copies of the hip new edition will be featured in store
windows with red flags and banners quoting the ``Manifesto,''
with bits like, ``The capitalist class has greatly increased the
urban population as compared to the rural, and has thus rescued
a considerable part of the population from the idiocy of rural
life.''
            Only in Gotham.

Unfortunately, in some circles it's probably politically incorrect to have a
personal dislike of rhubarb.

An associative anecdote: I edit courseware for a large company. The exercises
in the back of the manuals are printed on green or blue or purple paper (I
didn't want to specify what color, since, really, who cares?). The online
presentation has a little exercise icon & a note that the student should
"turn to the colored pages in the back of this manual."

Sure enough, someone has come to me because the reference to "colored" pages
offended a student. I laughed heartily, but have since been informed that
it's better to err on the side of political correctness.

Ah well.

Thanks.  Who was it said the poetry's found in the transcription?
I found this superb "writing through" at the White House:

"Much madness is the vinest sense to the discerning eye"

and, vinously Zukofsky:

"The pond at the end of the mine"

There's more, including a radical underwriting of lineation.

It's not sickening me, given the careers of Komar and Melamid who have
worked with samizdat and communist-satirical issues rather brilliantly
since at least a couple of decades; they've lived thru it, etc.

Briefly on "The Infibulation Ceremony" poem.  I welcome morpheal's interest
and Judy Roitman's point that traditionalism and Islam don't necessarily imply
belief in female genital mutilation -- the prose-surround that normally
accompanies this poem fully covers this point and cites a beautiful Islamic
statement about tolerance. As infibulation is only mentioned in the hadith
(traditional sayings of Mohammed), its justification is often regarded as open
to scholarly interpretation. I don't think opposing it would be regarded as
Satanic, perhaps even by most hard-liners.  As for Western poetry, I mainly
said that my poem was unlikely to get through to Somali nomads -- given the
widespread illiteracy alone, an uncontroversial point.

I'm with you Linda.  I haven't been so bugged by the commocification
of dissent since the Black & Red  _Society of the Spectacle_ was
replaced on bookstore shelves by that god-awful, easy-to-read/consume
translation/version from I can't remeber who.  No respect for the project
existing in the form of the lingo as well!  The Black & Red cost 3
bucks (if that--no copyright) while the new one was wieghing in at $16.
Also dissing the project's embodiment in the form of distibution!

There was a big spread about the new CM in the Independent over here
(UK) a month or so ago.  Some prat, tres into "Cool Britania", was talkin=
g
about opening a shop in Lodon devoted to Commie Chic which would only
be open one day a week, staffed by rude, uniformed Russians, and made
an effort to understock.  No joke!

Marx hasn't chuckled since they started charging 8 pounds to visit his =
grave
in Highgate.

What are us girls and boys to do?  (I know where there's a hole in the =
fence
so you can sneek in at night.)

There ought to be some kind of purple heart award for anyone who
survives that (and Hass was pretty worn down by it, too).  But the work
he did there deserves recognition -- he managed to convince a lot of
people who'd never given much thought to literature and literacy to put
money into underfunded school libraries and similar organizations.  This
kind of grass-roots stumping seems to me one of the more positive things
that's been done with the laureateship recently, and it accompished more
than any amount of grandstanding could have done.

*One thing occurs, reading the various responses to Ron's slashing
critique, and reading Mill.2 itself (thanx to JR or PJ or whoever got U of
C Press to send me a review copy:  it is in fact gonna get a major review
in the Proj.).....

*A strength of the book is its positioning of poetics and practice in
relation to groups.  Re-emphasis  of the fact that poetry is a profoundly
collective endeavor.

*I found Ron extremely funny (dissing the inclusion of "anyone who ever
attended a Fluxus event")...But these framings are interesting and
important.  The editors mention the Umbra group as one they might have
included and didn't.  (...anyone out there who has not read Nielsen's
Black Chant should *immediately* do so...) One of the tragic things, right
now, is that we have in Aldon's book a beginning of a recovery for the
poetry community at large, of Umbra and closely related currents...that is
a recovery of the memory that they existed; but this doesn't make their
work available to most.  (I'm lucky to be a wage slave at Emory
University, whose library collected many of the group's individual volumes
when they were published; they were in some cases low-profile publications
then, and are definitely obscure *now*)  So I'm very sorry Umbra was not
included.

*As there's so much talk about the dynamix of anthologies, it does occur
that an Umbra anthology *has to be* in our future; just a matter of its
editor stepping forward... (listening, Aldon?)

*Anyway, the conceptualizing of the period's poetry, as having much to do
with collective groupings, is a strength of the whole project.  It is
handled flexibly, with poets viewed individually in some instances, in
groupings at other times. One could argue with details.  (All those Fluxus
people that worry Ron so, are not presented in their own section, for all
that the editors are at pains to emphasize them; which is odd and goes
unexplained..) But being both a poet and a communist, I have to say that
these are healthy impulses..

*Jonathan Mayhew's critique is badly ill-concieved.  The Millenium project
is **not** about Auden and Merrill.  There are interesting dimensions to
those poets.

*But the editors specifically address the edgeness of what they are
dealing with.  Use the term "avant-garde" and such like.  Now, I hate that
term, but almost everyone I respect uses it (or experimental or
innovative) and we can't really get away from the nomenclature problem
easily.  The point is, there are venues where you can find excessively
lionized mainstream icons like Auden and Merrill.

*This really and truly is an instance where (as some said to Ron) the
critic should do his own anthology...Because what Jonathan has in mind
here is not the concept of the Millenium volumes.  The concept in his mind
sounds interesting.  Camps (in the broad sense of mainstream/alterstream)
should indeed clash/encounter/dialogue more. And more directly.  But the
Millenium venture is about something else.

*Along these lines, many avant'ers are going to be shaken by the inclusion
of poetry and poetix from Adrienne Rich, for instance.  There are other
instances, but I don't have the volume in front of me...

*No, there is definitely breadth and then some, to Mill.2.

I sure hope the NEXT millennial edition includes a sampling of the
Islomaniacs, a neglected group of Madagascaran english-writing poets
who never knew whether they would appear as authors of their own next
poems, nor where their next cup of chai was coming from, much less
whether they would be part of the future or even the past.  They traded
poems on a read-or-burn basis since firewood was(& is) in chronic short etc.
Their work is hard to find - especially since it isn't "work".  The
Univ. of Left Overbie in Great Britain houses most of the extant
unpublished ms. and Eric Blarnes could tell you more about it but his
comments are very consistently unreliable. There is, however, a dissertation
by one Jacqueline Spendroit of the Univ. of Gottagingoin, titled
"Islomania in My Mind : the Square Root of a Broken Circle : Madagascar
and the Poetics of Exotic Species : How to Tie a Bowline" which you
can get through interlibrary loan from Humble Public Library, Humble, TX,
if you ask nicely.

So far this morning we've heard of one poetics list member who can be in two
places at once -- and now we hear of another who has five times the strength
of other mortals! I think we should rename this list the "Poetics League of
America" to properly commemorate the super powers of its members.

I, for example, know what the next post is going to look like!

I know that Poems for the Millenium is *about the avant-garde.  My point
was that Volume I is richer for its Yeats, Eliot, Rilke, Machado.(Machado
hated the avant-garde).The anthologization of more recent poetry seems
more affected by purely social groupings and the living memories of the
participants.

It would have been more *imaginative to include Auden--the striking
juxtapositions I value in all of Rothenberg's anthologies would have been
enhanced rather than diminished. That Auden is accessible elsewhere is
beside the point to me--so are O'Hara and A. Rich's dreadful poem about
Beethoven's symphony.

By the "get your own anthology" argument all critique is automatically
disarmed. If we can praise what's there it seems equally logical to look
at what isn't, and perhaps speculate on why.

Paris 1968 uprising recalled in writing on wall


            PARIS (Reuters) - The fury of France's 1968 student uprising
came to life at a Paris auction Tuesday when more than 200
posters from the era went under the hammer.
            Thirty years later, the stark revolutionary art, most of it
crudely painted in red or black, has turned into a pricey
collector's item, echoing the rage that spilled out of
universities and factories onto the cobble stones of Paris
streets which became a symbol of the revolt.
            While demonstrators declared war on the establishment and
consumer society in general, the posters' favorite whipping boys
were the aging President Charles de Gaulle and the CRS riot
police, whose job was to crack down on the anarchy that
virtually shut down the country for May and part of June 1968.
            ``They were full of talent, and humor too,'' said antique
dealer Monique Couturier, who bought a poster of a medicine
bottle labeled ``Press: Do Not Swallow.''
            She remembers the students who came to her shop to prepare
for their marches, tying water-soaked bandannas over their noses
and mouths as protection from tear gas.
            But they were also virulent to the extreme. A poster of
Hitler holding a mask of de Gaulle depicts the angry mood of
those summer months.

Charles North's _No Other Way: Selected Prose_ is just out from Hanging
Loose. I read it as the significant counterpoint to _Content's Dream_,
more similarities than one might guess.

Generating some interest and some uninterest is Sianne Ngai's essay "Raw
Matter: A poetics of disgust" in the current number of Open Letter. Philly
talkers will remember that this is the piece Jeff Derksen cited in his
brave stand against Ron Silliman. Philly talkers will also remember that
Derksen, trapped, revealed the source of at least one of his list of
expletive percentages. In the essay Ngai calls for a poetics of muffled
noises in response to cockroaches ingesting fecal matter. Gestalt me in!

Washington, D.C. - Congressman Albert R. Wynn (D-MD) is issuing a
special alert regarding H.R. 6 - a bill introduced by Rep. Frank Riggs
(R-CA), which would prohibit all affirmative action in higher education
admissions.

This extreme measure, to be considered on the House floor TODAY, (4/29)
is a sweeping proposal that would prohibit affirmative action designed to
remedy documented and proven history of discrimination against persons
on the basis of race, sex, color, ethnicity, or national origin.

The bill affects virtually all colleges and universities across the
country, public and private, from using affirmative action in their
admissions policies - even if the school believes it is necessary to
ensure a diverse student body.

Because the bill uses the term "preferential treatment" without
defining it, the term could be interpreted broadly to cover a wide range
of admission policies and practices - including outreach and
recruitment.

This bill -- to be certain -- will lead to an unprecedented degree of
federal regulation of college and university admission activities.

Please contact Speaker Newt Gingrich's office to express your
opposition to the Riggs Amendment!

folks who want to contact their own

may find this site useful:

it contains a full Congressional directory,

just now.

of course, it's no substitute for throwing

I agree with you on that. I cannot, from my own knowledge, claim that it is
a practice that is specifically condoned by that tradition. It is clearly
not strongly opposed. I think, without more expertise in that area, that is
all we can really say. If it is practiced and not opposed, then similar to
what sati
(the immolation of wives on their deceased husband's funeral pyres) was to
the Hindu tradition before British intervention, the practice is condoned by
the cultures / traditions wherein it is practiced.

When the spiritual leaders with Islam declare that the practice is
forbidden, then the practice will no doubt end among Islamic people. Does
the existence of the practice that mean there is a basis for the practice in
Islamic tradition ?
Not necessarily. Though it might mean that there is no basis for any strong
opposition to the practice within the tradition.

>I also question the interpretation of "the very use of a western style

I think that we have to realize that in fact, no matter what we give lip
service to, we do not really respect many of their beliefs and practices
(whomever THEY are) and THEY do not in fact respect many of our beliefs and
practices. Anything beyond that is simply diplomacy jostling for momentary
strategic and economic advantege. While I hate to be so Machiavellian about
it, it is the way the world in fact functions.

Besides that, the limits of respect as to allowing them their's, if they do
not attempt to force their's onto us and make us follow their's, are
breached in the instance where there are members of their own group who want
to free themselves, or to be freed by means of intervention, from oppressive
practices and beliefs that they do not freely choose to accept and follow,
but are constrained to by force, and by means of fear and intimidation even
unto potential loss of life.

Where does respect for alien practices and beliefs end, and intervention
against the oppressors become not only acceptable, but necessary ?

A difficult but not an impossible question.

Everything is that way in those kinds of systems. Koran is, I seem to
recall, considered the sum total of all human knowledge, all science. So
mere mention of something is often considered sufficient. Even vague
allusion, of subsequent reading into the text itself what was unknown at the
time of writing, is often considered sufficient.

Also, the tendency is that if it is mentionned, included, there, and not
forbidden explicitly, then it is an accepted practice within the tradition.
I doubt, in that case, if you are right about that, that any Islamic leader
will strongly oppose the practice. They do not tend to oppose "included"
practices that are "mentionned" in the hadith.

It could, perhaps, but to their worldview it would be unintelligible.

That is a huge problem in the attempts to communicate across cultural
boundaries. The worldviews are so different, so hard to get one's own head
into and understand.....and then too damn easy for whomever gets their head
into that space and that space into the head to end up "going native".

Important to remember ( & know
that the first Muslims studied language, history, and science in order
to read the Q'uran--interpret--translate--and that THAT is still an
ongoing function of Islam --as well as Judaismm and Christianity-- so
that the Q'uran was not really considered "the sum total" but rather the
book unto which (into which) the sum
might be FOUND. I don't believe therfore that a reading into the
text--by readers--would have been "unknown" at the time of the intial
scribblings began...

at the cut rate of $35 incl. postage. New books will be, otherwise, $10
incl. postage.  This is more than I'd like to charge, but cannot persist
with present joyous money-flushing attitude. I offer whatever guarantee
imaginable that all books will be pretty interesting and nicely produced.
The two mentioned, Davis's and Prynne's, will be made with the help of
monies received in this way or otherwise but preferably former.  Gentle
poets, all cashes should be up front naturally. Any profligate souls?

"a poem is never to be judged by itself alone." This is not a poem.
Therefore unjudged by converse logic. Which in turn means, perhaps, that
testing the anthologist of Spicer who does not honor Jack's wishes
selected with an agenda.  If I take this idea too seriously then I might
believe anthologies affect the real in the same way that a politician is
always adressing his friends or the fact that most americans believe
houdini was killed during a magic stunt because of a made for tv movie.
Spicer, by selecting the best bits from this or that sequence, for his
Collected Poems 1945-1946 (Oyez:White Rabbit) created many moral
problems for me like baseball.

Dave! you hall of fame catcher

Good to see you on the list again -- I am much interested in this "moral
problems like baseball" you say Spicer's oyez selected brought on. Is this
the problem of choosing of aesthetics of excluding? Are they problem of
reading other people's work, writing your own work, figuring out what work
works, what? Or am I lunkheading out because I only really remember
Charles DeGaulle and JFK when it comes to moral problems like baseball.

From a review of James Tate in the "New York Times Book Review," by one
Adam Kirsch:

"Like the even more nonsensical
              Language poets, Tate is trying to make words fresh again, to
restore the glow that is
              rubbed away by advertisements and professional jargon and
simple day-to-day
              repetition. Thus the reader discovers these deadpan
absurdities: ''Please don't taunt the
              scrivener. . . . / No muffins permitted in the aviary.'' Or:
''my studies, Retro- /
              gression and the Requiem Shark, to name but one area.''"


The problem is that this idea of "making words fresh again" is itself a
tired commonplace. I also find the phrase "the even more non-sensical
langauge poets" hilarious.  Apart from this, the review does have some
insight.

Speculate, but the point stands: what they set out to do is a whole
different conceptualization than yours (and, again, yours would be a
helpful one to pursue, but it's a different conception)

MIME-version: 1.0
Content-type: text/plain

April 30, 1998

By The Associated Press

LONDON (AP) -- Nizar Qabbani, the Syrian-born poet admired by generations of
Arabs as the master of love verse, died today at his home in London. He was
75.

His family said he died of a heart attack. The poet had been in poor health
for some months.

Syrian President Hafez Assad planned to send a plane to take Qabbani's body
back to his native land.

In Cairo, Gamal el-Ghitanti, the Egyptian novelist and editor of the weekly
News of Literature, described Qabbani as the most popular Arab poet of the
20th century.

``He was by any measure a great Arab poet who made a big effort to make his
poetry understandable to all people and not only to the elite,'' he told The
Associated Press.

In Damascus, the Syrian poet Youssef Karkoutly said Qabbani was ``as
necessary to our lives as air.''

Qabbani became popular in 1954 when he published his first volume
``Childhood of A Breast, '' which broke from the conservative traditions of
Arab literature.

He later wrote poems dealing with social and political issues. After the
1967 Arab-Israeli war he lamented in poetry what he saw as a bitter defeat
of the Arab states.

Qabbani also was a committed Arab nationalist. Two themes dominated his
verse: dictatorship and the Arab-Israeli conflict.

His later work also criticized the male-dominance of Arab society and its
attempts to deprive women of their rights. In his poem ``Drawing with
Words'' he wrote: ``When a man wishes a woman he blows a horn,/But when a
woman wishes a man she eats the cotton of her pillow.''

He wrote more than two dozen books of poems. He also contributed to the
London-based Arabic-language newspaper, al-Hayat.

In 1973 he married Balqis al-rawi, an Iraqi teacher whom he had met at a
poetry recital in Baghdad. She was killed in a bomb attack by pro-Iranian
guerrillas in Beirut in 1981 while working for the Iraqi Embassy's cultural
section.

He is survived by two daughters and a son.

I think there are damn good reasons - social, political, and otherwise -
for "keeping the language fresh" or howver you want to twist what that
phrase signifies; and I'd say that the insistence that "freshness" as idea
is now too commonplace is itself a bit commonplace and overly chic.  That
fact is that freshness provides absolutely necessary dissonances vis a vis
normative usage, dissonaces which the language ultimately has to
accomodate by becoming more flexible - the more flexible it becomes the
more psossiblities that those who have constructed themselves via
uninterpretable or unacceptable vocabularies can impress their vision(s)
 on larger communities of meaning.  Language - as logical space - is
open-ended, eh?  This, not to mention that freshness is inevitable,
generated by our various sub-community vernaculars every milisecond -
hence "the cat who waxed Versace" (paraphrasing from memory as the
repeater of vernacular expression is wont to do)...So, I'm all for
freshness or the word which should be used in its place.  -m.

And, Kirsch's conclusion is:

  ..  And this, finally, is Tate's message to us: the little
  ..  pleasures of ''pure ordinariness'' make all the pain
  ..  worthwhile. The poems in ''Shroud of the Gnome'' are often
  ..  difficult; but with a message like that, they cannot be a
  ..  challenge.

Is Kirsch apologizing for Tate's poetry?  Ah, if only the _message_ is
good, you can forgive the poet for being _difficult_!

And, get this:

  ..  But while poets today may still use modernist techniques --
  ..  free association, surrealism, complex allusion -- the
  ..  modernist temper is gone; poetry has to a large degree
  ..  resumed its 19th-century role as a comfort and consolation,
  ..  a retreat from the rigors of the world.

So, the 20th century was but a little diversion in the grand stream of
POETRY which gave the POETS a few neat little tricks to use, but THANK GOD!
we're back to comfort and consolation!  So, please quit being so diffcult,
y'all, and give me some nice little lines I can fall asleep to...

In relation to what Chris says here, I found amusing the latest SPD flyer
that arrived at my house, with a blurb from the book editor of the San
Francisco Chronicle, Patricia Holt (but that's another story) -- something
to the effect of "SPD has books by poets who really don't care if you
understand them or not!" I thought it was a slightly curious thing to
advertise . . .

Yes, Louis, let's restore to language its original staleness. We could
praise poets for their extreme conventionality. What struck me about the
phrase I quoted was, precisely, its conventional formulation. This
being said, it is still an unavoidable concept.

Tate's poetry, which I have admired at some points of my life, is itself
getting extremely formulaic, its zaniness somewhat predictable.

The hyperbanality of Raymond Roussel would be the other option, I suppose.

Something I've noticed a lot re: difficulty---

There seems often to be (to continue to be) a real conflation of the poet
with the speaker of the poems.

Martin Corless-Smith was recently here to read... to my utter surprise
people thought his work was extremely difficult (if any of you have seen
it....).

Judging from the questions people were asking (do you take yourself
seriously? How do you figure the theme of 'faith' in your work and its
relationship to the lack of 'faith' in narrative that seems also to be an
element of your work?...) there was an insistence (on the part of a very
educated-about-poetry audience) that the poet and the speaker in the poem
were one and the same...

That to be 'serious' one must SAY very serious things....

That thematics and direct address are more comprehensible than fomral
enactments or mood or tone.

Geez I'm tired of that tired old saw.  In this small poetry community in
this small town there are 2 or 3 readings a year which trot out poets of
all poetics to audiences varying widely (or is it wildly) in their
understandings and by God when those of us who have or should have or wish
we had stuff in SPD read invariably we get responses from those who have
never heard of SPD or langpo or NYpoets or whatever saying things like "I
don't get it but I really like it" or similar variations.  Which is a
higher sort of understanding, n'est ce pas?  (excuse my French)

Also, to make things perfectly clear: it isn't "making language FRESH" it's
"making language FISH."

Let's be careful out there.

Judging from the way I was "educated" about poetry, that probably was the
problem.

    In response to TRACE---I guess I read Kirsch differently
    (I disagree with his review but for different reasons than trace).
    I think he's using the word "challenge" positively and lamenting
    what he sees as a lack of that "challenge" in Tate. Kirsch, as I
    see it, seems to lament the "19th century role" of poet as consoler
    and comforter which he detects "beneath" the seemingly modern
    disjunctive aleatory qualities of the poetry he's discussing.....
    Now, whether he's ACCURATE about that is one thing
    (in the first place, I don't quite know what he means about the
     19th century poet of comfort and consolation: Baudelaire?
     Dostoyevski [i know, not a poet] speaks of his writing as
     "corrective punishment", I see that in much of Dickinson,
     Shelley, etc. too)
     Kirsch, of course, poses a reductive dichotomy
     between "challenge" and "comfort" (but, then, critics and
     scholars on both sides of the fence have been rewarded for
     such rhetorical maneuvers for quite some time now....)

      I also wonder about the phrase "retreat from the rigors of
      the world". I think Kirsch finds such a stance terrible,
      and Trace (who thinks Kirsch craves that kind of poetry)
      also finds it terrible, or ethically unsound.
      But sometimes the world does not come in the form of RIGORS
      (rigors unmixed), and then such a "retreat" is not really
      a retreat....

Re: Chris and Mayhew....

I think of Juliana Spahr's work as in some sense a 'response' to the
banalization of language...

It seems to me that a major 'argument' or aspect of Spahr's work is a
formal and rhetorical insistence that 'drama' or 'emotion' or 'pitch' are
not products of semantic zanniness or originality alone...

In fact, I would argue that Spahr's work is pretty gosh-darned whacky
vis-a-vis her topics and the commercialized and banal language from which
a lot of her diction seems to stem....

I don't think her diction or lexicon are banal in the extreme, however. I
think that the greatest effect of shocking banality in her work comes from
her modulation (or lack thereof) of tone...

The difficulty of language (in the form of vocabulary and
grammar) is, in my view, one very specific site of 'making it new'--

As in: I think tone and mood and cadence are some of the 'engines' driving
a lot of the most original work around by (at least) younger writers...

Best,
Katy

 insight.


It's not that the idea of making words fresh again is tired commonplace, it is
 the phrase itself, especially in the context of a review, that is perhaps
tired, worn-out. The very idea of "making it new" is hardly Pound's and hardly
new; it is inconceivable apart from poetry.



__________________________________________________

Argument

How can we live without the unknown in front of us?

Those of today want the poem to be in the image of their lives, composed of
such little consideration, of such little space, and burned with intolerance.

Because it is no longer given to them to act supremely, in this fatal
preoccupation with self-destruction by their fellows, because their inert
wealth holds them back and enslaves them, those of today, their instinct
weakened, lose--still keeping alive--even the dust of their names.

Born from the summons of becoming, and from the anguish of retention, the poem
rising from its well of mud and stars, will bear witness, almost silently, that
it contained nothing which did not truly exist elsewhere, in this rebellious
and solitary world of contradictions.

well but the insistence that "the insistence that 'freshness as idea
is now too commonplace is itself a bit commonplace and overly chic"
is itself a bit commonplace and overly chic.

        and the trauma of "existence 'in quotes'"

Even to say "refreshing/renewing the language" recalls Hobbes'
remark on "Cursing, Swearing, Reviling, and the like", viz., that
they "do not signifie as Speech; but as the actions of a tongue
accustomed".
                        Can someone tell me: whjat does it mean, this
re- and tired version of MAKE IT NEW? And where is it this
specific formulation comes from?

        since culinary metaphors have come up,
        i think of the stale "raw vs. cooked" debate
         and wonder if some people mean "cooked" when they say "fresh"
         (and "raw" when they say "stale").......
          it does seem that way at times..........

am embroiled in my own institutional nonsense here, but having just
yesterday rec'd vol. two of the jerry/pierre anthology, i wanted to take
this opportunity, and the unforgiveable speed of this medium, to toss in a
few all-too-hasty remarks by way of reopening this thread:

(1) first and foremost:  if you simply pick up the book and flip through
its contents, it should be clear that this is a vast and in some ways
unprecedented effort... my first thought was---no doubt like some of
you---that so & so had been excluded, and that so & so had been included...
and my list of so & so's on both sides of the exclusion/inclusion coin
would have included many more mainstream poets, simply b/c i believe it
important to try to bring disparate communities of poets together, if only
to squabble (i worry a bit that some may not come to this volume b/c of
obvious exclusions)... but there can be no denying that the range of volume
two is considerable... and that the editors are to be congratulated once
again...

(2) that said, i note in flipping through that the book does not seem to
offer as clearcut a configuration of 'schools' and 'movements' as did
volume one... is this simply an impression?---or is volume two configured
more around clusters?... for what it's worth:  i had my dozen or so (again,
engineering/science major, creative writing) students paw through the
volume a bit, and their first observation was that it didn't designate
movements (e.g., modernism, surrealism, etc.) as did the first volume...
for what it's worth, i say... now, i anticipated that this volume would be,
by its very nature, more controversial, in trying to approach the
impossible present with an eye or two toward the impossible future...

(3) i haven't had a chance to really spend any time with editorial
apparatus---i've only skimmed through... but i want to offer here a quick
list that i formulated---not a list of exclusions (or omissions), but of
inclusions... in fact, of duplications (of a sort)---those authors whose
work is reproduced both in volume one and in volume two (not the same work,
of course---and apologies for any bean-counting errors):

akhmatova
artaud
breton
cesaire
duchamp
duncan
ekelof
eshleman
h.d.
jabes
joyce
mac low
macdiarmid
michaux
neruda
olson
oppen
ortiz
paz
pound
sabina
schwerner
g. stein
stevens
williams
zukofsky

(22 men, 4 women)

what i'd want to know from jerry/pierre, if it isn't already noted in the
editorial apparatus, is whether and to what extent this duplication was
itself a matter of extended deliberation... well---to be more precise, b/c
i'm sure it *was*---what were the terms of this deliberation?...

(4) it's true that auden, spicer, and many others have been excluded from
volume two... at the same time, i note that spicer and auden and many
others DO appear in the commentary sections... and this is in fact
significant, not only from a teaching perspective, but in terms of
developing historial context... i wonder whether jerry/pierre intend
someday to produce an index for the volumes that might include all of those
poets mentioned in the commentary sections?... i think this would be
extremely useful...

(5) given my own specific interests, it was nice to see a section on
"cyberpoetry," to see someone like jim rosenberg finally get his due, and
to see folks like don byrd and michael joyce credited for their
contributions to late 20th century thought... i know of many, many talented
folks who might also have been included here, but again i regard the drift
of the anthology as not so much to territorialize as to provide a sense of
openings... and a sense is just that---a sense, even with u of california
backing... in other words, the editors as i see it are using a powerful
academic press in order to advance an unorthodox and polemical
understanding of poetic possibilities... and like, why the hell not?... i
like it, for example, that readers are referred in volume one to seek
eliot's _the waste land_ elsewhere...

(6) i've had a chance to read over jonathan mayhew's brief review of the
anthology, and i do think jonathan's is an even-handed critique, given the
brevity of his review---and we all know that no book is beyond critique...
i encourage those of you who are interested to have a look at what jonathan
is saying... at http://www.ellavon.com/

anyway, again, all too hasty and for what it's worth... and i need to say
here, again, that i think jerry and pierre are to be congratulated for
another superb volume...

all best,

joe

No--there is no way.  It would be a little like living in an antiseptic
bubble.  Protected from infection, but cut off from the world.  (That is,
it would be like that **if** there were a way...but (fortunately) there
isn't)

LAST WORDS, by Guy Bennett

The first book of poems by poet/translator
Guy Bennett, our own Sun & Moon stalwart, who
typesets and designs the typography for all
our books. Guy's book uses a collage technique
of "writing through" other writers (in this
case, poets ranging from Stein to Guest, from
Lorca to Mac Low). Bennett fuses together a variety
of poetic timbres and stylistic registers into a
single lyric voice. The result is a suite of humorous,
often enigmatic poems whose potential meanings like
somewhere in the the linguistic, yet inevitably
human space that separates the reader from the work.

NOON, by Cole Swensen

Cole's seventh book of poetry, chosen through the New American
Poetry competition, selected by Rae Armantrout. The poet
leaads us into NOON's interior so that we "see the word
as a single streak, something built of transparent speed:
pure white of the sort they say no one person, unaided,
can perceive."

Spicer's "Textbook of Poetry" starts out by saying "Surrealism is the
business of poets who cannot benefit from surrealism."

Does this mean that surrealism was on the right track but got bogged down
in a certain routinization?  This might be relevant to James Tate.

I have always been puzzled by this line; I think I understand it, but
perhaps I don't.  Your brilliant interpretations are welcome.

I have this repeated experience of thinking I am highly interested in
surrealism, starting to read it, and then losing interest quickly.

*This is a great post..........I believe that everything said above is
true and has n'er been so well expressed...

*I don't think these things can be stressed too often.  Not too long ago,
there was an issue of the mag Central Park, with a colloquy on poetix.
I believe it was Stephen-Paul Martin, who said a couple of times that
"avant-garde" poets *believe* that they are "difficult" and *want to be*
(or, I think the phrase "take pride in it" came up); astonishingly, this
hopelessly riseable claim was repeated and expanded on by Mark Wallace,
another participant.  Now you have to understand that both poets were
speaking of themselves as among the "A-G" types they were refering to.
They were bringing up this subject by way of criticizing (or questioning)
a grouping they considered themselves to be to a degree a part of.  (and
so the intention as I read it was one of tentative self-criticism, in a
collective sense)

*Now both these guys do very worthwhile work.  Mark in particular, as is
known to most Listmembers here, is an important and fabulous poet on the
contemporary scene.

*They were spouting a bunch of nonsense, at least when they made these
particular comments.  (Most of Wallace's remarks in the symposium however
are brilliant, and folks should look 'em up).  Why would they go so far
astray??

*I can only imagine there is a strong sense of ambivalence and complex
self-reflection, going on for these two poets, which reflects some of the
pressure felt when one is isolated from the well-funded (however inert or
pathological) ruling cultural institutions. Also (and related) there is
the pressure of self-doubt that is felt when one's audience is relatively
small.

*They may take pride in trying to obscure...But actually I don't think
they do; they were going a bit overboard with the earnest self-examination
stuff..

*In any event (and in line with Judy's comments) I think I can assure them
that a very large number of non-mainstream poets know that they are not
(in any genuine and absolute sense ) "obscure and difficult"....No matter
what the NYT Book Review imagines!  What we are doing may not be lifeless
and wooden, to the ear or mind, but that doesn't make it obscure, nor is
that a *goal*....fa petesake..

Okay, here's a simplistic stab at it.  Those who take to surrealism most
naturally as a means of poetic expression already are surrealists without
consciously meaning to be. Because they are surrealists by nature, the
possibility of "benefiting"from surrealism -- in the sense of its adding
value to their work -- is moot. On the other hand, for poets who are
basically dour, realist types, the appropriation of surrealism's surface
characteristics may be more overtly conscious, and may hold the (possibly
false) promise of extending their work in more interesting directions.
("I'm clumsy but if I learn to two-step people will love me.") But since
Spicer's is really a tautological statement only a surrealist can love, why
bother to make it make sense?

Poetry is the business of surrealists who cannot benefit from poetry. Now
_that_ I understand.

Aren't these terms entirely relative? "Difficult" is any discourse with
which one is not familiar. So the further you go into a particular
discourse, the more obscure your cliches become. Which, to the
uninitiated to that particular discourse, is perceived as "difficult."

Story: Picasso was painting a portrait of some guy's wife. Guy drops  by
the atelier to check out Picasso's progress & complains: "She doesn't
look like THAT!" Picasso asks, "Well, what DOES she look like?" The guy
pulls out a photograph and points to it. "She looks like THIS." "Hmm,"
Picasso says, "small, isn't she?"

To someone not familiar with psychoanalysis, a cliche might seem obscure
and, yes, "fresh." The discourse of writers is intensely fresh and
obscure and cliched. I know people who think anyone who reads (even the
most mainstream) poetry is automatically avant-garde. Does arguing these
issues among ourselves seem rather funny to anyone else?

I want to take this opportunity to officially nominate rational
discourse as most banal (as in tedious).

To borrow from a Jiffy Pop advertisement ("fresh" if you've never heard it,
"cliched" if you have, and "obscure" if you think you've heard it but can't

For several seasons now the city, and for that matter the whole country,
have enjoyed an attack of balletomania from which, happily, neither shows
any sign of recovering. The touring companies are packing in customers
from Kansas to California. New York could treat itself to a winter season
of ballet, too, if there were a proper theater free and an extra company
free to dance in it.
        Is it too much to ask that New York should have its own ballet
with a permanent home here? For such an organization touring would be only
a secondary activity. So far, first-class ballet in this country has been
leading a hand-to-mouth existence, keeping on the go year in and year out.
In constant travel it wears out its strength and brilliance and
productivity. Dancers need a home like anyone else. As artists they need
to share the natural life of a city, like the people who know they belong
there.
        As professionals they need quiet to practice, to develop, to
rehearse. The choreographers need confidence in the schools that train
their young dancers, and they need confidence in whatever intellectual
life the country has. These are slow things that have to be able to grow
unconsciously over a long term of years. They are the things that
eventually give ballet a sound and strong character. A racing stable needs
sensible attention all year round and needs to plan for it; much more an
ensemble of ballet dancers.

It's nice to think that all obscure poets are for real while all the rest are
sellouts.  Only it's not true.  Obscurity is also a business in the poetry
world.  It's called obfuscation and it's a cottage industry.  Poetry is
very strange: if you make an idol out of it it bumps you off.  It's like
Fortune or the Fates.  It's like the Muse.  - Henry Gould
