Subject:      G-ology

First, two corrections, or, as we G1-ers are wont to say,
self-criticisms:

Jena's right that I conflated Chain & A Poetics of Criticism. Mea culpa.
Tho she doesn't mention that her co-editor also co-edited the Technique
section of O-blek 12. I would love to have somebody FULLY elucidate the
differences between the various publications with their overlapping
editorships. I frankly could learn a lot from that.

Second correction: nobody seems to have caught my error in assigning
authorship of Hot Afternoons Have Been in Montana to "Eli Mandel." It
was Eli Siegel (who still turned into a professional homophobe at the
end of his life). WCW wrote the intro to Siegel's book. Anybody out
there read it?

Steve Evans' intro to the Technique section of O-blek 12 seems to me the
most heroic attempt to date to articulate a terrain for G2. I think that
he's right in that intro about the motivating "hatred of identity" that
runs through the work, although his reading of the phenomena in O-blek
is more broad and generous than that espoused in Apex's "State of the
Art" manifesto. I used those two pieces with my class at Naropa, which
led to some lively, albeit inconclusive discussions. Certainly nobody
has ever done a more aggressive job misreading and stereotyping a
community than Apex' broad swipes at G1 (& esp. LangPo):"an avant-garde
dominated in its practices by a poetics espousing the priority of
'language itself' over all other relations." (p. 5)

Is that not a classic instance of labelling theory taking the misnomer
"L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E Poet" just a wee bit literally? I've never once met a
G1 who espoused that.

Or, later on the same page, "a participatory valorization of this
disintegration...." Haven't both Gayatri Spivak & Bob Perelman
completely answered that in response to Fred Jameson's
only-slightly-more-in-depth reading of the poem "China"?

And, throughout State of the Art, an entire series of presumptions
concerning the social functions of innovation, as though everyone from
M. Bertrand thru G1 were an Italian futurist celebrating the
potentiality of the submachine gun. Talk about "phobic
characterization"!!

I think what makes the Apex group stand out so much, especially at a
distance (where, for example, it's easier to forget [or ignore] that
Alan Gilbert, Kristin Prevallet and Lew Daly, the editors whom I've
actually met, are all lovely, charming, intelligent people, as full of
complexity and caution as one might want), is precisely the directness
of their address, which shoots right through even the "post"iness of its
convoluted syntax. While Steve wants me to "say it ain't so,"the Apexers
say openly that "a new understanding of our task as iconoclasts and not
innovators will emerge." If I ignore for a moment how I feel at the lack
of accuracy and generosity in their description of my cohorts in G1,
that's still an interesting and difficult claim to make and I want to
know more. What distinguishes them as a group phenomenon is their
ambition--it's the most "out there" manifesto we've had in ages--even if
their "ambition is to have no ambition" (as I think the British punk
band The Gang of Four once put it, back in the swampy G1 days of 1982).

Besides, Steve, Chick Gandil, who organized the Black Sox throw of the
1919 series (he was the first baseman), and thus gave rise to the very
phrase you use, used to live on my very block here in Berkeley. He
worked with my grandfather. That's at least as cosmic as discovering
that I'm the reincarnation of one of Jackson Mac Low's past lives. (Or
that Jack Spicer and my father died on the very same day in 1965.)

>But on to specifics. (This is Steve "talking")
  Marjorie Perloff's remarks
>about the shifting tenor of political commitments
>among progressives in the U.S. make sense, but let's
>not forget that the "burning political concerns" of
>*In the American Tree* were/are by no means self-evident:

>*Pcoet* as doing political work, one has to have a
>sense of the political rather more elastic than most
>people on the left had in the 70s or for that matter
>have today.

At the point that David wrote Pcoet, he was either about to (or just
had) abandoned his idea of ever finishing his dissertation (the one
chapter he wrote appeared in the Maps special issue on Zukofsky), and
came out of the closet to his students at Berkeley with a vengence,
platform shoes and glitter in his beard. There was absolutely no way
that any one confronting either him or that text in those days could not
see the text's relation not just to the history of modernism but also to
what was then known as "gender fuck" politics.

The argument for Bruce's work is not dissimilar. Tho his idea of gender
fuck is a little different.

Besides, one of the major thrusts of one strain of G1 was to counter the
various modes of vulgar left critical/aesthetic practice. Bruce Boone,
Bob Gluck, Steve Benson, myself and Kathleen Fraser were all once in the
same marxist study group, and we had some TERRIFIC arguments. In every
sense of that word. And every single one of the G1s who were politically
active (not just through our poetry) dealt with these issues repeatedly.

>What I don't understand is why this hard-won utopian
>intelligence (or say: set of reading practices) is
>not brought to bear on the *New Coast.*

I disagree that this is what's goin' on. Here the claim in Apex about
"iconoclasts and not innovators" rings much truer to my ear. What I want
to know is what the social content of that might be.

 If you can
>read Rae Armantrout as "positioned critique" can't
>you do the same for Robert Kocik?

Yes, absolutely. I'm interested in examining the nature of each
position. I'm not especially making the argument for my
g-g-g-generation.
>
>I suppose that at some point, Ron, names will have
>to be mentioned to go along with generalizations

Oh, I still do believe in Lenin's idea that the move toward
"abstraction" is toward the truer layer of the concrete.

 I'm honestly not sure what's at
>stake for you in such remarks.

I thought (still do) that if I prod a little, I'd get some interesting
feedback from poet(s) in G2 (maybe even G3) who would further articulate
the landscape, so that the "prospective" (i.e. inchoate) nature posed by
O-b 12 might give greater rise to a new shared vision of a broader
terrain. Frankly, I'd like to see less reactive criticism and more
manifestos a la Apex (and from a broad range of positions). I find it
interesting (very ambiguous word here, and deliberately so) that the
most detailed response has come from somebody who positions himself as a
critic and not as a poet, as such.

>On the question of "average ages" of *NC* and *NAP,* it
>seems clear to me that biological age doesn't equal "age"
>in terms of the poetic field.

Huh?
Actually, the question of age is a complex one all on its own. One of
the real values of The Art of Practice is its inclusion of a number of
poets generationally part of G1 who did not begin publishing until later
than most of those in Tree. (I'm reminded, say, how late both Jackson
Mac Low and Hannah Weiner were to publish regularly. When Jackson was my
age, 48, he had exactly 6 books in print.)

But I do think that there's a generational dynamic (different for each
G) that focuses when poets are under still well under 35, and that to
wait longer as a generation to begin to stake out a space is itself a
notable step, so that the hesitancy implicit there must itself be looked
at as part of the process (Think of Olson's age in comparison to
Creeley, Blackburn et al, or of Burroughs to Ginsberg & Kerouac, or of
Williams to the Objectivists.)

>
>To clarify one general point in closing: I am not under
>the impression that a collective re-definition of what
>poetry is and does has as yet been articulated by G2

Yep, except for Pam, Lew, Kristin & Alan have at least made one stab.

 Given the
>way literary fields work in capitalist social formations,
>the failure to achieve such a collective redefinition
>will lead to a lot of interesting poetry disappearing

Absolutely! Several G1ers have noted in recent years how much the O-b 12
formation of G2 reminds them of the younger writers who found themselves
active around certain modes of the NAP in the mid- to late-60s. David
Schaff, Bill Deemer, Harold Dull, d alexander, Lowell Levant, Ed Van
Aelstyn, John Gorham, Gail Dusenbery, Stan Persky, Seymour Faust, George
Stanley, William Anderson, Wilbur Wood, etc etc etc. But failing to
distinguish their terms from NAP1, NAP2 proved unable, unwilling to set
up the institutions that might have insured their own communities'
perpetuation into the future.

I am amazed and appalled that neither the Messerli nor the Hoover
anthologies include the work of Lew Welch. In the 1960s, he would have
come into almost any listing of the 24 or so most influential NAPpers.
Such is history. You have to write it yourself.

Some items to consider in the current "generation" debate (and let me say
that the remarks I'm about to make are not directed at any one particular
respondent.

1)      It is a standard hegemonic (not to mention racist and imperialist)
move to take one piece of writing by some particular "group" (as it is
defined from outside) as the example of what is wrong with that "group"
as a whole, and then dismissing that "group" on the basis of that one
piece of writing. It is even hegemonic, racist, and imperialist to refer
to them as a "group." What does all this have to do with many of the
reactions to the introductory essay in Apex of the M?

2)      "Make it new" was hardly a dictum put forth by someone interested
in social liberation. Indeed, "make it new" is at least as effective as a
capitalist slogan as it is as a call to radical change. And whatever the
social effectiveness of the proponents of "make it new" in poetry (I
think it's unclear, but worth discussing) their success has been
undeniable in terms of their marketing of that concept and their
promotion of poetry that fits the concept.

3)      Indeed, it seems true to me that all writers have a complex
relation to past and present, making what is "new" by borrowing,
changing, demolishing the past.

4)      To see the "lyric" as somehow a force of social conservatism is
simply HISTORICALLY UNVERIFIABLE. The lyric form, like the use of
parataxis, collage, sonnets, whatever, is a possibility that can be made
use of, or discarded, in a variety of historical situations.

5)      I don't think it's at all clear whether younger writers are
"returning to the lyric." But if writers are using lyric forms, the
question to ask is NOT "what's wrong with those writers?" but rather
"what is it about the contemporary social environment that makes the
lyric seem useful to some writers" or "what is it about the lyric that
makes it seem useful to some writers in this social environment."

6)      One of the things I'm struck by in my conversations with writers
of my own age is their GENEROSITY in responding to the work of previous
generations of writers. I'm beginning to wonder whether more established
writers can respond with the same level of generosity. What does it mean
that it would be taken as a sign of WEAKNESS to actually believe that
writers in the past did some interesting things?

7)      In fact, my objection to Lew Daly's introduction to Apex of the M
is not primarily on the level of poetics (though I find the statement of
poetics there fundamentally misguided) but that it repeats the same
Oedipal MALE model of thinking your poetry has value only if you can
"overthrow the enemy." My problem with his introduction is not that it
departs from the avant garde manifestos of writers like Breton, Olson, on
down to Silliman, etc., but that IT LOOKS TOO MUCH LIKE THOSE MANIFESTOS.

8)      But the idea that Lew's work, however interesting or not, is a
statement of MY poetics, or that of Steve Evans or Jena Osman or whoever,
simply escapes me completely. And that would be true even if I thought
everything Lew did was great.

9)      To what extent does the discourse of the avant garde remain
fundamentally linear, imperialist, etc on the subject of form, the
social, etc?

Some additional comments on my previous missive:

1)      What role does GENEROSITY of response to other poets play in who
is considered "important", etc. Is attacking the writing of the past the
same as a claim to "seriousness"?

2)      I WANT TO SEE LESS MANIFESTOS

3)      Notice that hegemonic "grouping" practices can be used by
everybody against everybody, and they always suck.

4)      Charles Borkhus: "You originals/are the biggest dupes" Whether
one believes that or not, to what extent is the concept of originality on
the level of form a problem rather than a given good?

5)      If a revolution were to occur, what makes poets so sure that we
would be part of it, rather than what was being fought against?

6)      Isn't it possible that everything we know is still wrong? Or at
least not more right than previous generations of writers have been?

7)      Jefferson Hansen: "I don't know what I think. Hence I am crudely
ecletic." Does that make him a WEAK poet? What if it did?

8)      Will somebody please say that discussing poetry doesn't have to
be the same as a battleground? (excuse me now, I have to go put on my armor)

Subject:      "apex of the M" - essay excerpt

For those of you who are interested, what follows is the preface and
footnotes to an essay I have written on the "apex of the M" preface. I
present the essay in its abridged form here in part to spare you too much
text and for the simple reason that I have it "out" to an editor in hope of
publication. My response the the "M" centers upon a notion of "act" is
which I feel undermined by the eschatological.
The "footnotes" which folow actually contain their own argument and flesh
out more fully what I mean by "act."
Toward the end of the body of the essay, which is aphoristic in its
construction, I quote a critical line offered by Ron Silliman in the
"Chinese Notebook"

20.) Perhaps poetry is an activity and not a form at all.....
&
25.) How can I show the intentions of this work and poetry are
        identical?

Here I ain't talkin' 'bout my ge...ge..genuflection.

I would be happy to send the body of the paper to anyone who'd like it.

 "Only Be Sure to Spare the Poet's House."


Put it all to the torch! And the king named one by one
the towers, the gates, the temples   this marvel of the world;
then brightened, as the thought leaped into words:
"Only be sure to spare the Poet's House."
Akhmatova: from Alexander at Thebes
  Leningrad, October 1961



        What follows is in part a response to a recent editorial preface published
in the first issue of "apex of the M."   My initial response upon reading
the preface was something of a fever, a visceral anger over the tactics
chosen by the editors. Among other things the preface urges a re-figuring
of poetry toward a "millennial" poetry; a proffering of the
"eschatological" and the acknowledgment of the "sacred" as an orientation
in this "iconoclastic" re-figuration.  On further reflection, it became
clear that the gnostic territory marked out by the editors is an extreme
violation of the very things they advocate. I wrote this response to allude
to another radicality which turns the editor's contentions inside out, a
radicality which alters the grounds toward which such theological terms
attempt to surface.


        The poet's house in the above epigraph is a protectorate   it suffers an
enjoined sovereignty. By torching Thebes, yet sparing Pindar's house,
Alexander makes of the poet's house a protectorate within an eviscerated
political and ideological history   a situation which speaks poignantly
about Akhmatova's condition in Soviet Russia in the early 1960's.1 This
protectorate is a historically ramified condominium; condominial in that it
becomes the locus of its own negation, an index of a history apart   spared
only as a remnant.  The tyranny of Alexander's rule is not mitigated by his
benevolence to the poets (and priests) of Thebes. By being spared the
torch, the poet's house is brought into the state, and made a colony of its
ideological adventurism.  In a similar fashion, the editor's preface to
"apex of the M" makes of the poet's house a protectorate through its
reference to Dante's benevolent Monarchy.2 The concept of the monarchy
arriving at the new Millennium folds this protectorate around our
action/writing. The proposal of a millennial poetry guts the act of its own
potential; the cultural and historical magnetism of the Millennium is
powerful enough to push historical perspective into a future which is
beyond its own significance. It is a warped projection which hurls the act
into a future of its own making. This warp enables a projection of
"consciousness' which for many reasons is an aberration of any sense of the
continuity of work. The thought of this projection and its working through
is in fact suspended by this hurl into the future; this "thought" is
propelled by its own idea and is a self-serving futuring and is not arrived
at through historical immanence. In other words this gnostic sparing is an
evacuation of history through a constant futuring; an eschatological desire
which distances desire and history from the moment of act. This maneuver
proves quite similar to Alexander's sparing, but in "M" the house is
"spared" instead through the sacred as a sacrifice to the Other. In
material history, the poet's house cannot be spared by either monarchy;
both monarchies only gaze from a distance at the poet's house; they reach
only to the threshold of its potential. As though in the flames engulfing
Thebes, the thousand lights flickering off the M into the heavens3
illuminate the poet's house as only an iconographic way-station, postponing
history until the fulfillment by an other. This other never being
accomplished refutes action.4 History in the case of any imperialist
tyranny is absorbed by that tyranny   the ash surrounding the poet's house.
History in the case of "M" becomes a transfixion, dependent upon the course
of postponed desire. The M's subjects stand transfixed by the flicker, the
meta-physic of the gnostic fire, a fire as tyrannous in its claim on poets
as were Alexander's.
        We begin to see a relationship of the word to history. The force of work
in world is equal to its moment of act as reflected in the word. This is
the word's duration and consequence. Through this examination we also begin
to notice that the image of the M disrupts history, it creates a film on
history which is gesturally opaque   a shadow of the world. The "apex of
the M," in spite of its attempts to be iconoclastic, reapplies the icon in
a most graphic and violent form of usurpation, intended as liberatory, yet
functioning as a rhetorical device which perhaps unbeknownst to the editors
is bent on debilitating human actuality. We begin to see that far from
being iconoclastic the editor's spell cast at the apex of the Millennium
makes of history a fetish. The result of the distance of act from word in
the eschatological breach is that history and the future is idolized,
thematized, made aspect of rhetoric and form. In essence the effect of the
preface to the "apex of the M" is an "iconoclastic fetishism."5
        Within act as a process of work the poet's house is and can only be
continuously engulfed in material history by constantly enacting the
overthrow of any agency.  This is achieved only at the moment of the letter
as it is engulfed in history apart from any agency. Indeed this struggle
against agency is the interminable contradiction of language, its constant
overthrow of its own mediacy. This continuum is itself history; history
apart from rhetoric, from style, from form in activity. This essay is a
brief examination of the poetic act as act in history and is prompted by
the responsibility of this act   a responsibility and a history dodged by
any agency, any Monarchy, be it "Alexander's," or "God's."


1 At a recent reading given by Michael Palmer he mentioned to the audience
that Akhmatova's house is a national museum, but that it is unmarked and
its location is known to but a few   it is a "secret house."

2 In Dante's cosmology, the "M" falling out of the heavens in a procession
of letters (D-I-L-I-G-I-T-E  I-U-S-T-I-T-I-A-M...Q-U-I  I-U-T-I-C-A-T-I-S
T-E-R-R-A-M ) orients the reader to view the M as if with a  partition
between one's eyes. In one eye the M is a promotion of the benevolent
monarchy - God's justice - to be established on earth; in the other eye, as
some critics would have it, the M, in its transformation to a fleur-de-lis,
is a critique of the imperialist ventures of the French Monarchy and of
Florentine political schisms   France had its hand in the ouster of the
Ghibbelenes in Florence and both France and Florence used the fleur-de-lis
as political symbols. This politically partitioned view of the M points to
a secular monarchy and to Dante's critique of a Prince's justice. The
partition of the M is instructive.The moment of the M, of letters, for
Dante is partitioned secular and sacred   the moment of act and potential..
 The schism of act and potential points directly to the schism of secular
and sacred, but through the transparency of angels:

'The Angelic intellect is always in a state of pure act that is, its powers
never lapse into mere potentiality, but are at every moment actualized. At
the other extreme of creation, and therefore in the lowest place is pure
matter, the prima materia   which is  pure potentiality   the possibility
of becoming realized in some individual form. Midway between the two stand
man, a union of both. Part of our powers goes forth intermittently in act
or actuality; but part lies inactive as mere potentiality, waiting to be
called into play. And in man this union of act  and potentiality, Beatrice
declares, will never be dissolved. This is sometimes understood as the
union of body and soul, which even death can dissolve only for a time; but
it seems rather to imply that man even in the world to come will never
attain to the pure act of the Angelic intellect   some part of his being
will remain for ever in potentia.'
from In Patria, an Exposition of Dante's Paradiso, Rev. John S. Carroll,
M.A., D.D. , Kennikat Press Port Washington, NY/London, 1971, first
published in 1911. p. 454.

When seen through the agency of the Angelic intellect, material act is "for
ever in potentia." This in potentia is the measure of our act, from
without. This external measure results in a violence    an excised history
very similar to that suffered at the words of Alexander. In a subtle, yet
profound shift, if read dialectically, the future does not bestow grace
upon act, act is its own futuring.B With the recognition of the
trans-temporality of act, there is a clearer understanding of how the
poet's house is perpetually engulfed in history; never does it propose a
future, it actualizes history as it's own future.
        To flesh this out further, this notion of act can be likened to the idea
of negotiation put forth by Homi Bhaba in location of culture, (Rutledge,
'94). In the first chapter, "The Commitment to Theory," Bhaba refutes the
possibility of a transparent agent, or of any third person examination of
ideology.  He puts forth Mill's "On Liberty" as a clear example of a third
person , or transparent agency of political ideology   that first marks out
difference (polarization) and then reconciles these differences through a
careful, (and inherently violent) rationale. (For Bhaba, Mill's transparent
agency is a rhetorical/textual manifestation of the political subject
through negation.) Opting instead for a textual, or iterate negotiation,
Bhaba attempts
to position the text in a constant process of emergence from within an
ideological translation. "When I talk of 'negotiation' rather than
'negation,' it is to convey a temporality that makes it possible to
conceive of the articulation of  antagonistic or contradictory elements: a
dialectic,  without the emergence of a teleological or transcendent
History....By negotiation I attempt to draw attention to the structure of
'iteration' which informs political movements that attempt to articulate
antagonistic and oppositional elements  without the rationality of
sublation or transcendence. (pp. 25, 26)
        What does this have to do with a benevolent monarchy? First, gnosticism is
the pre-eminent trans
parent agency. For the gnostic, only God is capable of reconciling act and
potential. Any acceptance of that agency is a subordination to that agency
- a further removal from act's capacity; any acceptance of a transparent
agency, any Monarchy, is an acceptance of a negative, transcendental
history. Second, the iteration of a gnostic history is the proposition of
an Other to which we ascend, of a constant and everlasting potential which
is always undoing the act. The extension of this is that through
transcendence, history is subordinate to gnostic iteration.
        B Any attempt to reconcile act with potential must encounter history at
its moment and this encounter is impossible through any transparent agency
(or angel). In part of the Arcades Project, Benjamin counters very clearly
the agency of angels and proposes a material history in constant
actualization.
The fore- and after-history of historical evidence is made manifest in it
by a dialectical presentation. Further: every historical state of affairs
presented dialectically polarizes and becomes a force field in which  the
conflict between fore- and after history plays itself out. It becomes that
field as it is penetrated by actuality. And thus historical evidence always
polarizes into fore- and after-history in a new way, never in the same way.
And it does so go beyond itself, within actuality per se....(N7a,1)

and in another place:

in allegory the facies hippocratica of history lies before the viewer's
eyes like a frozen, primordial landscape...(N2,7)

                                        from N: "Re The Theory of Knowledge,Theory of Progress,"

Act is its own limit and the limit of history. Any agency (any "M") is
allegorical and denies this limit and instead presents a mythic history
an "antediluvian fossil."

        As an historical and cultural cross-reference, parts of the argument put
forth by the editors of "apex of the M" are in no way new, or specific even
to poetries of the west. A Japanese literary critic Yashimoto Takaaki used
a similar argument against self conscious, language-centered writing in
Japan in the late 1970's. Yashimoto, reacting to the influence of (French)
post-modern thinkers on Japanese poetry in the '60's, argued that  "to
single out [contemporary] poet's individual characteristics from the ground
of their sensibility and the solipsism of their thought has become
meaningless."
[See the introduction to An Anthology of Contemporary Japanese Poetry,
Leith Morton Ed (1993) and Trans and Yashimoto Takaaki, Zomho Sengoshiron
(Tokyo: Yamata Shobo, 1983)  (The above quote is borrowed from Morton's
anthology, page xxiii.)].

        3  These thousand lights have been said to be the transcendence of writing
itself; the individual letters actually writing the world onto the face of
divine justice - the joined matter and spirit, act and potential in the
Jovian sphere. See chapter two of Jermey Tambling's Dante and Differance,
Cambridge, 1988.

Organization: University at Buffalo
Subject:      Re: G2

As to the Evans-Silliman exchange:

I appreciated both posts.
But Steve's I found especially useful for clarifying
a lot of the problems that I had with Silliman's original post.
What I find most frightening about Silliman's arguments is
his reduction of everything in Buffalo
or even elsewhere in the nation to a sort of spiritualism
(it is the only grouping that he acknowledges as really
having any seriousness)
that finally isn't representative of the larger picture.

For starters, as Jena made clear, neither of the editors of Chain
are on the board of Apex of the M.
Chain in fact is a journal that in many ways pursues an opposite
agenda as that of Apex--
it is anti-editorial, anti-grouping. The use of the device of the chain letter
in the first volume was explicitly intended to expand community
definitions beyond editorial privilege
(Jena and I wrote about the success and failure of this project in our
"Editors' Notes").
Also neither of the editors of the Technique volume are on the board of
Apex of the M. But while this is probably just a confusion on Silliman's part,
it also seems in some ways indicative of his blindness to anything
going on in what seems to be called G2 poetry beyond spirit.
Beginning the Technique volume with the Spirit section
was something that went counter
to my editorial wishes and knowledge
(I wanted to open with the broader "word and world" section),
but also I think should not be read as "aggressive."
Peter argues that when he sent this volume off to the printers
with the spirit section first, it was to try to offer some
connection with the Presentation volume--
both begin with Abbot and end Ziolkowsky.
I am willing to chalk it up to alphabetical accident.
But also I don't think that
any more than the twenty-one poets in the spirit section
have much to do with spirit (and come on, even of these twenty-one,
beyond a statement of an idea of poetics
as being transformative, it  is hard to see these poets as a unified group--
Miekal And, Lisa Jarnot are hardly spiritualist poets
that would meet the rigors of definition proposed in Apex--
this confusion or expansion of the categories in this collection
was an editorial intention).
Finally, to see the anthology as spiritualist is to
do a great and serious disservice to around one hundred other poets.
Just as to say that the anthology indulges in
"increasingly modest forms"
is to do a great disservice to a whole slew
of writers (who are these people, Ron?
who is "returning to the lyric?
what are their numbers in this volume?
who is draining the social?
what is the social and why is the lyric not social?--
these are all innocent questions on my part,
I need more specifics to actually begin to discuss this topic
which is one that seems very urgent to me).
It is, to just list some names at random,
unfair to Lee Ann Brown's and Karen Kelley's attention to sexuality,
unfair to Kevin Magee's mix of formalism, class struggle, and history,
unfair to Myung Mi Kim's attention to relation,
unfair to Susan Gevirtz's complicated feminism and attention to subjectivity,
unfair to C.S. Giscombe's attention to identity.
It is also I think unfair to the overt
political intention in the anthology to include as many women as men
(something that other anthologies of alternative poetry
don't even come close to attempting and something that
never seems to get mentioned in any complaint about this collection).
Further, I am no longer sure any more, although I would have been a year ago,
that a return to the lyric is a draining of the social.
For starters, it is difficult to separate the social from any form.
Susan Stewart's recent work on the lyric has done a lot of change
the way I think of this form.

Also, I don't see the anthology has having a
"reluctance to acknowledge or own its own position."
It seems rather that there is a complication in the anthology of what it means
to have a position (an identity, a school, a gender).
Steve Evans's introductory piece is good on this.
If there is anything that sits owl-like overlooking a younger generation
it isn't language poetry
anymore than it is the New York school--
it is rather attempts at categorization, at bunker mentality.
Much of the work of what might be called G2 reacts against this
and in very interesting and innovative ways
(Apex is an obvious exception to this in their editorial return to
a concept of poetic discourse as war).
Perhaps the reason such a collection seems such a strange beast
to Silliman is that it is so different than
the rigorous, mathematical model of ITAT. It is a collection of
younger poets--
all of whose writing will change dramatically in the next years.
I prefer to think of the anthology
as more of a phonebook than even an anthology
(these complaints about the authority of this
anthology that are happening in Joel's post and in the discussion of anthologies
at the beginning of the year are very alien to me--
what authority? the whole thing
was thrown together and knows it).
The numbers will change, people will move,
but it is an attempt at a demographic for the year. It claims no completeness.
It doesn't tell you not to read the books of the authors included.
At best, it is a reference tool.
At its worst, it is difficult to read because it includes so many writers.

All of this has put me in the uncomfortable position of defending
something that I have worked on.
But while I acknowledge a lot of omissions and other problems
with the anthology, I also believe that a lot of the work in it is important.
I stand behind this work by other people because it has meant something to me.
I don't find this work a repetition of language poetry
nor does it seem to me upsetting
that there are
"no literary devices in that collection that you cannot already find in
The New American Poetry, In the American Tree, or The Art of Practice"
anymore than it upsets me that there are no devices in these anthologies
that one cannot find in as inclusive a project as America: A Prophecy or
maybe even the Norton.
It is emphasis and idea and use of device here that is important.
Not device itself.

I hope this makes sense. I would enjoy complaints and clarifications.
Juliana Spahr

P.S. Please excuse erratic returns, they are not poetic attempts but
rather just attempts to stop the line being cut in two.

As someone struggling with my own dissertation on the Objectivists, i
found this image of a newly freed Melnick in platform shoes, an image
apparently hovering just behind the text, delightful.  Problem is, i'd
read the poem before & never been visited by this apparition.  And
maybe i'm only advertising my own lack of in/sight but i defy anyone to
conjure it from those pages in INTAT alone. The point is that
in its absence, i'm not sure how clear the whole "gender fuck" issue is
(wasn't clear at all to me).  The larger point, as i see it, is
that many of these sorts of discussions, of poetry and "the
social," posit a larger (reading) context for the poetry that is simply
an illusion (despite the fierce energy and intrinsic interestingness of some of the
discussion).  Where i live i am defined against almost everyone i know by
the fact that the latest ish of Talisman or Sulfur might be found lying
around my apt.  That puts me in a pretty small group--yet i'm pretty far
out of the loop when it comes to the current G1/G2 debate--much of which,
it strikes me from the outside, will turn on precisely those Melnickean
personal filigrees to which Ron alludes--and these are supposed to verify
the political dimension of the work?  And on this point, i have to say,
despite my longstanding sympathy w/ the LangPo effort, that if people
have insisted on objecting to what they see as that group's
exclusionary emphasis on the centrality of language (which is key to
the claim for social efficacy of poetry), it is only because the original
writings are full of such assertions of linguistic centrality.  It may
be true, as Silliman indicates, that no one actually believed it, but the
extremism of assertion was itself part of the way the "group" worked and
undoubtedly a crucial factor in its "success" (w/in an extremely limited
field).  The question remains: what is the larger social efficacy of the
sorts of "resistances" LangPos have advocated?  How exactly does the social
enter the poem and the poem the social?  How do discussion like these
keep from remaining hopelessly INTERNECINE??

Which, within the context of the "discussion," is another way of saying

Steven Shoemaker's question is an important one: How does the social
enter the poem; how does the poem enter the social?  Such questions seem
highly valuable in ascertaining not only relationships between aesthetics
and the larger social world, but the place of the arts (and artists) in
that world.  I'm very interested in hearing what other people's ideas are
about such notions of influence between the social and the personal,
particularly as they relate to aesthetic production and their
place/influence/relationship to history and context.  I've been exploring
Marxist, particularly Gramscian, views of how the social and the
aesthetic interact but I have the sense that they, while useful, remain
vague and ill-defined.  The notion of "use" that was raised seems
pertinent, but I'll have to reread (always) those entries to see if they
can be inserted into Steven's question.  I am always reminded of Emerson
in "Art" where he finds the distinction between the useful and the fine
arts limiting and stifling--perhaps the answer (were there ever any one)
would lie in that direction.

Isn't "the poem", lock schlock and barrel, constituted by a writer who
has continuing relations with the body politic, like it or not --
thrown-ness as in Jim Morrison  (rr or r] & Charles Bernstein have
liked to say -- following Heideggr, I guess.  Oh yes aesthetics
happens somewhere else then where, old bean, huh?  Aesthetics is a
blind for social and money interests mainly.

 Confucius never found anyone who was disinterested --  & that
makes questions for a whole tradition of separations and purifications
in the name of art (i.e. Milord's fetishized pictures and objets d'art,
later property of  boards of trustees of museums, or MS of  Vergil, as
sandwiched in plastic sheeting in Vatican to be literary.  Poet's
letters, Palgrave and subsequent anthologies in the college market].

Jean Calais's translations of Villon are all in vain....Everyone wants
to be a big artist these days.  There must be more in poetry than
anyone has thought.  Could it be that there is a real power in it/always
 ideologists want to bring it under their control, as instrument.  Like
music, it keeps on escaping ideological control clutches, saying more
than it means to, or less.  Let's hope there is a real poet among the
new  writers, or even two.  Surely "G1" or any G at all including G-6
(dead poets of circa Mallarme's time will welcome them, by opening
new readings to us, readings we had missed, but which may be what
we have always really longed for.  Belonging to no G in the U.S.
(wrong age) but listening as a reader/user to several  U.S. G's with
pleasure, excitement, appropriative glee, there is no reason to
choose among generations, only to pick out the plums.  This you
learn in "art history", who says there's progress between
generations, so that noone can consider themselves righteous
who can make use of "early"  artworks?   Does the saying of a poem
work like a charm as entry to a space of thoughts and language
issues and  issues of living and the politics of living or not?
Noone can quite tell what will prove to be useful and
sometimes it happens that a misprint retained does the trick.  L=  was
marvellous because it accepted that conscious control of  the way
words got into the poem could be consonant with disorders that
seemed to be the preserve of chance procedures or of lyrical
speaking with tongues.

It did not only "displace" "personal poetries"  (Downtown poetries
various, variously remaining in some degree acceptable or with
affinities) but also the hopes for the upsurge of deep image to
recreate the body and the body's politics.   I look to see with interest
which models from the recent G's various will reappear as the
mashed potatoes for the younger poets.  I could see aspects of beat
poetry being valuable as well as the "spiritual" poetries of say Robt
Kelly or George Quasha....

If I see the arts as a zone for freedoms, someone will now surely tell
me my responsibilities. __ That sounds like a job for Ron Silliman. __
  I'm impressed with Tom Mandel's comments on "use" and I hope
this will be seen as pushing in something of that direction as well as
a rejoinder to the Shoemaker questions.


This medium is great for filling in times like sitting in office waiting for
next lot of exam papers to come in.  Hello. American poets, it's
half-past four on an early summer afternoon, --- here is your wake up
call.

and in the nonviolence of totality, without securing itself against the
violence from which is nonviolence lives and which appears in the tyranny
of the state. Truth, which should reconcile persons, here exists
anonymously. Universality presents itself as impersonal; and this is
another inhumanity....A philosophy of power, ontology is, as philosophy
which does not call into question the same, a philosophy of injustice. Even
though it opposes the technological passion issued forth from the
forgetting of Being hidden by existents, Heideggerian ontology which
subordinates the relationship with the Other to the relation of Being in
general, remains under the obedience to the anonymous, and leads inevitably
to another power, to imperialist domination, to tyranny. Tyranny is not the
pure and simple extension of technology to reified men. Its origin lies
back in the pagan "mood," in the enrootedness in the earth, in the
adoration that enslaved men can devote to their masters.


5 In Iconology (Chicago, '86) W.J.T. Mitchell plots out some of the
rhetorical image-making used by Marx and his contemporaries in an effort to
get to an understanding of "The Rhetoric of Iconoclasm." From the chapter
so titled he examines empiricist and idealist models of history to
illuminate Marx's critique of fetishism and "its dialectical counterpart,
the phenomenon of iconoclasm." Although his argument in no way resembles my
own, I feel there is an pertinent quote from the passage called "the
Dialectics of Iconoclasm:"

Iconoclasm has a history at least as old as idolatry. Although it always
tends to appear as a relatively recent, revolutionary breakthrough,
overturning some previous established cult of image-worship (the Protestant
Reformation breaking with Roman Catholicism, the iconoclasts of the
Byzantine Empire opposing the patriarch, the Israelites escaping Egypt), it
regularly presents itself as the most ancient form of religion a return to
primitive Christianity, or to the religion of the first human creatures,
before a "fall" which is always understood as a fall into idolatry. Indeed,
one might argue that iconoclasm is simply the obverse of idolatry turned
outward toward the image of a rival, threatening tribe. The iconoclast
prefers to think that he worships no image of any sort, but when pressed,
he is generally content with the rather different claim that his images are
purer or truer than those of mere idolaters. (page 198)

Subject:      Re: experiwhat?

This is a bit of a long post, which is, I know, against the rules, and,
worse, rude. I apologize in advance, but having initiated this
discussion, there's a lot I need to say at this point. The multitude of
repsonses have been extremely interesting in their diversity and
inventiveness, but none has yet convinced me that the phrase "experimental
poetry" is either meaningful (apart from idiosyncratic imaginations
of it : private languages) or particularly useful. On the contrary,
after everyone has said their piece, it seems more confused and confusing
than ever. For me, the most attractive defense so far has been Robert
Kelly's, which he achieves by returning experiment and its science to
their mysterious alchemical sources, and the notion of proceeding not
knowing what the outcome will be. Even then, though, the idea that only
some poetry is initiated not knowing its outcome seems based on the very
same violent taxonomy I was trying to shed some light on in the first place.

If we take this secondary definition of experiment as the operative one
in relation to poetry, the unspoken implication is that there is something
we can call non-experimental poetry. What exactly would that poetry be?
Poetry that knows what its outcome will be before it starts? What does
"outcome" mean here? What the poem ultimately "says"? How the poem
ultimately "works"? Frankly I don't think I know of any poetry like that,
even the poetry I am least interested in. Even the most predictably
conventional, it seems to me, can, and frequently does, contain surprises,
the unexpected. To know the outcome before you write is to produce manuals,
not poems. Even someone like Timothy Steele, I'd argue, doesn't know
what results his rhymes will produce before he writes them.

Perhaps the key is the word "conventional". Or, dare I say it,
"predictable", thus returning us to the world of experimentalism. (But
if a poem is predictable, can't this be part of an experiment?
Experimenting to see if certain conventions will produce consistently
predictable results?) Let's say there is a complex structure of
conventions the poet has at her disposal, conventions that extend from
phonetics to syntax to semantics to form (something like the grammetrical
model Donald Wesling works out in *The Chances of Rhyme* and *The New
Poetries*). In one sense, a poem embodies a structure of choices
(conscious or unconscious, controlled or random) that array language in
complex relation to those conventions. Certain patterns of convention
dominate at any given moment the cultural sense of what constitutes a
contemporary poem.

We recognize Shakespeare's sonnets as poems, even great poems, at the
same time we know they are not contemporary poems. Compare them with
Bernadette Mayers' or Jack Clarke's sonnets. Their sonnets are
absolutely contemporary in every way, even though, or maybe especially
because, they work with a 600 year old form. I don't know how Bernadette
would refer to her work, but I think Jack would blanche at the word
experimental. You could say Los doesn't experiment, Los creates. Is
this a meaningful distinction? My sense is that every phoneme, every
stress, every rhyme, every reference in Jack's sonnets work within
and against the array of conventions to mark out a moment of awareness
of the particularity of the astonishing complexity of relation between
language, thought, myth, history, sound, silence, rhythm, self, other,
social, personal, elsewhere, here, time, and eternity. What Girogio
Agamben calls "whatever being" in *The Coming Community*. This is not
something I would think of as experimental.

Let me go back to the question of the relation to convention
as a way of distinguishing between poetries. Let's assume that at certain
times certain conventions dominate writing to the point that they no
longer even seem to be conventions, they are simply seen as constituting
(good) writing. And as a result, meaning itself becomes predictable and
conventional. Moreover, the conventions can be seen as upholding certain
conventional and oppresive forms of life. One alternative for a poet in
those circumstances is to try to subvert the forms of life by subverting
the dominant conventions in her work.

Is this something people mean by "experimental"? And if so, is it more
important under these conditions to not know what you're doing (what
your desired outcome is) or to know? Or is it possible in some sense to
both know and not know at the same time? Say, to know generally, but
not to know specifically. What does it mean to not know in this context?

Let me return for a moment to the idea of a situation in which a specific
form of literay convention has become authoritarian and can be seen as
upholding certain oppressive forms of life. In this situation, is it
possible to address, even subvert, those oppressive forms of life from
within a writing based on those dominant conventions? I think this is
the kind of writing Keith Tuma referred to a few months ago during the
great anthology debate, i.e. the writing of someone like Thom Gunn, or,
say, Louis Zukofsky when he's writing sestinas.

If we acknowledge that it is possible, that means that the link bewteen
the forms of literary conventions and the forms of life is metaphorical,
not actual, and that some other issue is at stake here in the writing.
Let's call it "meaning", where we understand that in a broad sense of
the overall signifying power of the poem, the numinous "cloud" of
significance generated by the totality of the poem's phonic, visual,
semantic, and temporal structures.

In this model, the relation to convention, while meangingful, does not
determine meaning. If we understand "experimental" poetry to be poetry
which resists in some way(s) the dominant conventions by "not knowing"
what it's doing, what its outcome is, it could in any case still be
upholding the very oppressive forms of life it seems to be subverting,
or trying to subvert. That is, it could banal, predictable, pretentious,
self-indulgent, tedious--even authoritarian (and, as Joel Kuszai pointed
out, sometimes is).

What, then, is the use of this distinction? Rather than clarifying the
issues facing writers today, it obscures those issues by creating a
dualistc taxonomy which implicitly attaches value to sheer formal
exuberance or lack of control or even ignorance.

I know there's a whole other dimension to this question that has to do
with practical considerations of identity, recognition, publication,
government money, etc. A number of people made interesting observations
about these issues and the question of lables. These are important
questions, but they're not questions of principle. They should not be
confused with principles, nor allowed to confuse them.

Mike,

        In the airport recently I observed a man wearing a tee shirt
upon which was written, in huge block letters:

                        WHY?

                        BECAUSE I SAY SO.

This to me sums up this question re: the issue of "experimental"
(allowing that we are not talking any more, which would yield no
results, postulating a hypothesis and then trying to prove it.)

        What I mean to say is that if you take Timothy Steele or
people secure in the academy more importantly, where these people come
from, that they are invested with some authority and the line really
falls where they have the confidence (vs permission, in Duncan's
sense) of being able to "say so."

        I mean when I saw the t shirt I thought who is his audience,
his children, his significant other, airport personnel. But in the end
it didn't matter to whom it was addressed (maybe it was only to me!)
there was no doubt from the look in his eyes, whether he was going to
be "experimental" or "conventional" that his audience would have to
yield.

That's the point I'm thinking as I do my own scribbling somewhere
out of his way.

I've found virtually every response to my last post really valuable and
useful. Especially Juliana's.

But I don't want this to be reduced to a "generational debate" since I
don't see "winners" or "losers" but rather think I (personally) have a
lot to gain from getting the sorts of insights that seem right now to be
just popping out the various posts. Roadmaps to the writing are
especially valuable.

Besides, if this is going to be Oedipal, I know which role that puts me
in, thank you...

Some thoughts here on a few of Mark Wallace's comments.

>
>1)      It is a standard hegemonic (not to mention racist and
imperialist)
>move to take one piece of writing by some particular "group" (as it is
>defined from outside) as the example of what is wrong with that "group"

>piece of writing.

Yo, Mark. I'm not saying there's anything "wrong" with the Apex cluster
and am trying to read them, not dismiss them.

One of many valuable lessons I learned from Jerry Rothenberg about 25
years ago was that it's very hard for any writer to read the work of
people 20 years or more younger than him or herself. Writers of the NAP
generation tended to cluster w/ regards to my own G1 into the following
patterns:
1) Couldn't read it, didn't try
2) Wasn't what they expected, so dismissed it outright, sometimes w/
great hostility
3) Tried to be generous, but didn't really get it
(this was/is almost a majoritarian reaction)
4) Read it with interest, insight and made valuable responses to it

W/ regards to G2, G3...Gn, I'd like personally to aim for #4.
And would appreciate any help I can get.

 It is even hegemonic, racist, and imperialist to refer
>to them as a "group."

What is the point of writing a collective "state of the art" if people
don't take it seriously as collective action? I'm not the one grouping
them together. I will admit that use a governmental/institutional frame
such as a "state of the art" address does put one into some heavy
metaphoric territory. They're the ones who announced that they were the
government, no?

Let's avoid flame wars of hyperbole and character assassination if
possible. It makes it harder to read the work.

>2)      "Make it new" was hardly a dictum put forth by someone

>in social liberation. Indeed, "make it new" is at least as effective as
a

>

Actually, Pound was interested in social liberation. But he had a
profoundly fucked up idea of what that might mean. The other point about
making it new and the promotion of a poetry that fits the concept is one
that the New Formalists have already made. Interesting to see it here.

>4)      To see the "lyric" as somehow a force of social conservatism is
>simply HISTORICALLY UNVERIFIABLE. The lyric form, like the use of
>parataxis, collage, sonnets, whatever, is a possibility that can be
made use of, or discarded, in a variety of historical situations.


I think that a social examination of the lyric is a great project to
think about working on. I've even contemplated the idea of a booklength
study. Especially since the definition of lyric changes I think (part.
in the late 19th century) as its differentiation from dramatic &
narrative modes dissolves in poetry due to the arrival of other more
powerful dramatic/narrative media, the novel, cinema, etc. Pound's
tripartate logopoeia, phanopoeia, melopoeia are an attempt I think to
rescue that earlier distinction, essentially dividing lyric into all
three houses of the poem. But the underlying question becomes, what is
the social meaning of the lyric? In O-blek 12, as I read it, it seems a
return to the personal and local, which in turn can mean a lot of
things. I'd like to figure out just what those are.

In general, I think that all forms are amoral and can be used from any
poltical/social position depending on the context.


>5)      I don't think it's at all clear whether younger writers are

EXACTLY!!


>7)      In fact, my objection to Lew Daly's introduction to Apex of the
M is... that it repeats the same Oedipal MALE model of thinking your
poetry has value only if you can "overthrow the enemy." My problem with
his introduction is ... that IT LOOKS TOO MUCH LIKE THOSE MANIFESTOS.
>

It wasn't Lew who signed it. According to Alan & Kristin, they all
worked on it together, to the point that even some sentences were
collaboratively written.

>8)      But the idea that Lew's work, however interesting or not, is a
>statement of MY poetics, or that of Steve Evans or Jena Osman or
whoever,

Nobody ever said it was. Or Jena's or Juliana's or Joel's or most
anybody else in O-blek 12 except for the very particular few who
actively commit themselves to some version of its argument. So people
like Will Alexander and Elizabeth Robinson stand in an interesting
relation to it, not a part of that declaration but obviously very
sympathetic to its conception of a spiritual poetics. Not clear at all
how they would stand w/ regards to State of the Arts rather bellicose
stance toward the past.

I have found people in O 12 who themselves felt that putting the spirit
section first in Technique "yolked" them into its general thrust and
felt very much ripped off by that, precisely because they did not buy
into the underlying argument and felt that putting it first created a
sense of that. I've heard that from at least 5 contributors.

The value of State of the Art is that it makes explicit what O 12's
editing structure seems to imply. Very hard to read it as an accident of
the alphabet.

I thought it was clear from my opening comment that my remarks were not
directed at "attacking" the comments made by any one particular post.
It's interesting that my attempt to avoid doing so can be taken that way.

Some further responses, this time in particular to what Ron has said.

1)      I think I was suggesting, at least partly, that the reductive grouping
of various poets BEGINS in the introduction to the Apex of the M. By
turning "Language Poetry" into some one particular thing, they
unfortunately invite the kind of attacks that turn THEM into one
particular thing (altho I find it unfortunate that that is what had to
happen)

2)      I think it may be a stretch to say that Pound was ever interested
in liberation, altho he may have been interested in revolution. I really
do wish that history bore out the conclusion that revolution and
liberation were the same thing, but I'm afraid it doesn't. And to say
such a thing is not to say that revolution is bankrupt, by any means. But
reductive thinking about what revolution entails (and again, this is not
to say that anyone has done this recently) is NOT going to help
revolution be successful.

3)      The idea that poets respond to the past as much as remake the
present does not imply a return to radical formalism any more than noting
that the avant garde has traditionally been racist and sexist is a
conservative insight.

4)      The idea I want to put forward is that we need to rethink the
relation of the avant garde to the history of social liberation. And I
think it's not at all clear that avant gardists have always been as
socially revolutionary as they would like to claim. I think it's not at
all clear that new forms equal greater freedom, altho I do think that
poets can make use of form to respond to changing cultural dynamics. The
unexamined conviction that the avant garde is by definition involved with
social liberation has to be examined, and to say so is not conservative.

5)      It may be that there was some group editorial input on the Apex
of the M introductory essay. But the tone and style is undoubtedly Lew
Daly's, as will be clear if one reads his essay in A Poetics of Criticism.

6)      In fact, it is quite possible that a "poetic revolution" among
younger poets may find certain ideas in so-called "Language Poetry" to be
reactionary, heavily male-oriented, and wedded to a concept of "make it
new" that itself is conditioned by a certain blindness to the
historical/social/cultural of its own discourse. But I myself would reject
such a
revolution, since I think the poetics of writers like Ron Silliman,
Barrett Watten and others is more complex than that. But the argument I'm
suggesting here is going to be made, and the people who make it will not
necessarily be conservative.

7)      I don't see how any of these comments can be considered a
"flaming" attack on anyone's personality, altho I'm tempted to resent the
aspersions that what I've said is "flaming"--and I wonder about the
heterosexist implications of a word like "flaming" anyway.

8)      I'm tempted to think that at this point in time, the lyric may be
a socially revolutionary form than the manifesto. But I have no certainty
on this subject. In fact, I guess I think it must be true that the
manifesto is still useful, altho it feels awful tired at the moment.

Some last updates, etc., and then, since I may have helped confuse rather
than clarify matters, I'll shut up (tho I don't really mind confusing things)

In #3 of my previous message I don't mean "radical formalism" but
"traditional formalism"

What Tony Green says about "internicene" warfare really hits home--it's a
shame that my comments potentially sparked more misunderstanding (as if
we don't already have enough of that). That was not my intention for them.
Perhaps my own frustrated sense that a lot of people were not reading
each other with sufficient complexity led me into precisely the same
error that I was suggesting they were making.

On the other hand, I'm never sufficiently comfortable with my own
assumptions about the "significance" of experimental poetry, and so I'm
perhaps equally determined to question the assumptions of others
regarding the value of that work. It's quite possible that when I do
that, it can too easily be read as another call to warfare.

HEY TRIXY!

thanks for your response. I've been working on some other stuff
so it took me a while to respond. Hope that's cool. Yeah, I
promise not to send what you write to anyone else. And if you
are really serious I'll stop forwarding you stuff from the poetics
list. I am eager to do other things too.

I think - despite the waves of chatter - that something could still
be accomplished on the e-mail thing, although I have no idea as
to what it would be. I mean it's not like we are going to get down
to any level of praxis or meeting downtown some night to break
windows or somthing...which is what I think the political leads
to anyhow...

Yeah, I too thought Ron was quite generous with the M'ers. I
mean it is true - he's quite right - they are really trying to do
something, which isn't very normal these days. I don't get the
point of it. And don't worry about the editorial, you should read
Lew's book--talk about incomprehensible! it is great writing, if
you don't mind things being muddled by the psycho-sexual--but
the editorial - the "declaration of war" as Ron seems to think it is
-- the self-appointment to the "government"! -- I love that. I
think Ron's pretty funny too. The problem, for my two-dollars
and eighty cents, with the Apex thing is that they are trying to be
political but are insisting on the spiritual -- which for me is only
political when grouped into assembly for power reasons (i.e. a
church) otherwise the spiritual is like, well, you know, kind of
acquiescent by defualt--I mean sure, Koresh was able to bring
the ATF to his front door--if that's political then let me out
now--the real politics worth examining there is the refusal of the
social--the manipulation of people in the name of "faith" which
always slams the door on the social--here the spirital gets for me
kind of sticky and icky -- like the fear of identity within the
new coasteries -- hatcheries -- the fear of identity there is on
identitarian grounds--the anti editorial mode is still an editorial
- one of acquiescence and consent, however tacit. At least the M
has some fire under their caps...and don't worry trixie, the next

she is really into something different than Lew or Alan, or Pam
for that matter--perhaps not hostile to them, but different
enough to make the "group editorial" thing an unfortunate
effacement. They will have to put their cards on the table soon
enough. Poetry as Chillen of the Corn, or Jack-in-the Box will
be gone of roadside ephemera soon enough. I mean the true
"analysis" of our/any generation is to look at where the money
comes from and how it is spent -- anyone can buy a spot on the
literary register, the who's who of who cares

been reading the situationists for Bernstein's class, wondering
how people are going to react to it. I am afraid we'll get into a
chapter & verse argument about Debord--maybe people will
like him. Kind of hard to be in school and reading that stuff.
Reminds me of when what's his face in Portland ore. changed all
the street-signs in downtown to "Malcolm X" - it had a pretty
wild effect at the time even if it was simply consumed, just as
that group's efforts during the gulf war were completely co-
opted by the spectacular; I mean going into restuaurants with
gas-masks on trying to scare the eaters into some kind of political
resistance, I mean come on, despite the disruption, I doubt
anyone lost their appetite, and I'm sure there was hefty applause
at the end. How yuppie (fake concerned) of them. The protest
thing pretty much ended with them all "marching" around
downtown portland with a police escort, I mean, led by the
police escort. I remember sitting in my living room with John
the night we started bombing there...we didn't have any
lightbulbs that worked and no TV, just a clock radio, but that
was enough. I felt competely incapacitated by the whole thing.
All we could do was play music. There was only a bit of hope,
word from seattle that some nut had opened fire on I-5 with
some kinda automatic weapon. But that's not what the world
heard. I don't know what the world heard.

But the situationists. Shit. I read ten pages of that stuff then start
pacing in my cage. I love it in the anthology where its written
that the goal of the movement was to "complete and displace
poetry." --an aspiration not too difficult to like, although I
wonder what the hell it means. Situationism, as debord points
out in that first part of the "Veritable Split of the S.I. public
circular" book that situationism becomes as much the
understanding of the enemy, who need to know it in order to
fight it (through using it??) and then Trix, who then, may I ask?
are we?

It would be nice to trace a history of the phrase--"experimental poetry"--I
think it was Tom  Mandel  writing.  That history  I feel sure belongs with
that of modernism--and not just modernist literature--and more partic-
ularly  of its scientisms.  "The arts, literature, poesy, are a science, just
as chemistry is a science" Pound in l9l3. There's a book, CRITIC AS SCIENT-
IST, The modernist poetics of E.P, by one IanBell. Someone was saying Stein
denied  writing experimentally. although  her lab. work with Prof. Wm.
James clearly had a direct bearing on her ideas about  and practice of fiction. The first
definition offered by Zukofsky for OBJECTIVE (ism) is from Optics.  Mod-
ernist scientism seems to  have 2 purposes (at  least), the first having to do
with re-positioning the artist  socially, as more serious  (Pound's essay, "The
Serious Artist"), artistic knowledge  as hardcore, etc. and the second  to
do with establishing the "autonomy of the modernist art object" as we
would today put it.  Precise description of the object, impersonality--here
we have Eliot's  n otorious catalyst analogy--of the writer and so on.  And
so the short  answer to the q   uestion as to why people on this list are un-
comfortable with, can't see the sense of, want no more to do with,  the
phrase  is that the context  which prompted its appearance and the
purposes its served have both long gone.

 So another way into, or out of
this discussion, would be to take  that discomfort as a sign of our uneasy
relation with modernism .

Probably repetitious by now: The part the new critics played in creating
a "hardcore" object of study, with its own scientific processes and
procedures should not be forgotten.  I.A. Richards's "Science and Poetry"
(or was it Poetry and Science? no, it must have been Science and Poetry)
would be interesting to place in the context of a such a study of the
relationship of "exp" poetry to the development of "hardcore"
knowledge/poetry.  Of course, mind you, it has been done . . . but the
history of "exp" in this context still would be unique, I think . . . .

Subject:      experiment

        As unlikely as it seemed when I first climbed under the Buffalo
blanket, I find myself sending a message on Wordsworth.  His 1802 Preface
to
the second volume of the Lyrical Ballads begins with perhaps the most
influential use of poetic "experiment" in the English canon.  WW says
that LB
was "published, as an experiment, which, I hoped, might be of some use to
ascertain, how far, by fitting to metrical arrangement a selection of the
real
language of men in a state of vivid sensation, that sort of pleasure and
that
quantity of pleasure may be imparted, which a Poet may rationally
endeavour to
impart."  If we think of the "quantity of pleasure" as something
measurable,
like "energy" we're not far from OlsonUsOlson's formulation of poetry as an
electronic mail in which, if the lines are good, the reader gets the
poet's
charge.  Wordsworth (and Coleridge, collaboration demonstrating the
"objective"
worth of the project; if two could work on communicating "real language,"
then
the project might establish "a class of Poetry" which others might join)
experiments not only with language but with readers; if nothing happens
to
readers, the experiment fails.  The preface, written after LB went into
circulation, reveals his unscientifically gathered results, that he
"pleased a
greater number" than he hoped and presumably displeased about the same
number
as he had expected.
        Wordsworth adopts, and modifies, the scientific model of
experiment.  Later in the Preface, he distinguishes the poet's from the
scientist's nature;  the poet studies "general nature" (not Platonic or
Johnsonian, but familiar nature, ordinary life) and the scientist studies
the "particular parts of nature" of her/his field.  Wordsworth prophesies
that if "Men of Science should ever create any material revolution, direct
or indirect, in our condition, and in impressions which we habitually
receive," these effects would become "proper objects of the Poet's art."
Is WW's idea of experiment independent, with its emphasis on the truth of
pleasure, of its origins in Burke and association theory (Locke, Hartley,
Mill)?  I don't know.  To experiment now, with readers (and other
writers), in poetry might mean, for example, representing the indirect
"material revolution" of the internet experience to readers as part of
their new nature--(un)natural , pleasurable, strange, manageable,
manipulative, inevitable, and so on.  In any case, Wordsworth's use of
"experiment" is rhetorical, drawing on the status of the scientific
discourse of knowledge, in order to distinguish his practice from what he
saw as conventional poetic discourse.  I'm not sure the current use of
"experimental" (or "innovative" or "alternatives" for that matter) is any
less rhetorical, or any less inexactly effective.

CIRCLE, ed.J.L.Martin, B.Nicholson & N.Gabo. 1937
(U.S.Ed.Praeger,1971)  "The Constructive Idea in Art" pp.1-10.
Analogies between Science and Art as knowledge of the world are
continuously at work there. "In Art more thn anywhere else in the
creative discipline, daring expeditions are allowed.  The most
dizzying experiments are permissible, but even in Art the logic of
life arrests the experiments as soon as they have reached the point

Further, students of Malevich will know that he conducted
"experimental" workshops in which the concerns were the effects of
different "forms" -- on people, one supposes.

Could one suspect that "control" is at issue, by the artist/writer, over
"effect" on the "reader/viewer"; that mistrust of artworks as "spurious"
(uncontrolled messing around] is also connected with ideas
about  "control" over communicatory messages and meanings,
including the message that "this is a serious work"....   However,
quantities of boring artworks in galleries and in print should be a
warning that  "experiment" covers a multitude of ineptitudes, worst of
all a desire to pose as artist, limiting what is required as qualification
to a low-level of market expectation.  (There is a market-niche for
experimental junk, it seems].  There is also a need to take chances in
the making of anything to offset a rigidity in preliminary planning:
that's experimental in the sense of not quite knowing where the .... or
how the .... work will end.  "Experimental" is good or bad depending
on where and when you're aiming, I'd conclude.

I noted the other day (before I went to San Diego for a reading & a
class at UCSD) that I appreciated Juliana's post a lot. In
particular, she approaches the project of sketching out this new
terrain more completely than I've seen done heretofore. And that's
precisely what (I think) we need. Or I need, anyway. The following
thoughts fall almost entirely into the "clarification" column.

Two thoughts: I've tried to be specific about the fact that:

(1) I know that the "new mysticism" (or whatever one calls this
tendency) is not all that is the case, in Buffalo or elsewhere. In fact,
I've noted at least twice that several O 12 contributors make that point
repeatedly in conversation. I have said that they are the one group that
to date has attempted to articulate theoretically a transformed ground
for poetics, not simply an extension of what they inherited from G1, NAP
or the rest of the acronyms.

(2) I've steered as clear as possible away from characterizing the Apex
groups sense of spiritualism. While my own sense of the world may
approach something akin to an atheist variant of zen buddhism, I'm fully
aware of the pitfalls of approaching that discussion from a
post-Enlightment vocabulary and expecting to get much use value out of
the ensuing debate.

This is an interesting essay, well worth reading in its own right & a
perfect example of a text that would not be fun to try and fit into the
various constraints of email. The concept of anti-editorial editing is
problematic and the Chain editors understand it. From my perspective,
I'm intrigued at the desire inscribed in the project. It definitely
rings the "hatred of identity" bell from Steve Evans intro to the
Technique section of O12. And it differs dramatically from the
judgmental "state of the art" (SotA) manifesto in Apex.

Silliman's part,

Maybe. I wouldn't bet against it. But you neglect to note that two of
the editors of Poetics of Criticism are also editors of Apex, while you
are an editor of Poetics, O 12 AND Chain. Oliver Stone would have a
field day with this kind of stuff.

Aggressive is not a negative word in my vocabulary

But I find it hard to read otherwise

Ganick says that, with one exception, the order of The Art of Practice
was exactly that of the receipt of manuscripts from the authors (one
more reason to be prompt when solicited!), but I generally don't believe
in accidents. Each approach (any approach) is a demonstration of method.

I agree completely.

>Miekal And, Lisa Jarnot are hardly spiritualist poets

True enough if we are speaking in the narrow terms that seem implicit
in Apex's "SotA", but Miekal is very much a utopian in spirit. I'm much
more struck by the distance in approach given by Steve Farmer (one of my
favorite pieces in the entire book--totally sensible and on target) and
Alan Gilbert's in that same section. Gilbert's piece seeks to rework the
possibility of poetry, philosophy & history in a space of maybe 600
words. I find Gilbert's piece entirely problematic--the privilege he
gives to the "other" (which he places transcendentally outside "the
dialectic," a phrase he uses way too nominally) and the solid object he
seems to envision as the self. But I'm impressed that he wants to
accomplish this or even thinks it possible.

I want a poetics in which both Farmer and Gilbert seem possible, even in
the same paragraph.

>Finally, to see the anthology as spiritualist is to
>do a great and serious disservice to around one hundred other poets.

111, to be exact. The two volumes have 132 writers by my count. The
volume called Presentation

-- I forget who first pointed out that this distinction between
presentation and technique almost perfectly mimes that of competitive
ice skating --

has 114 poets in 334 pages, which comes to 2.9298245 pages per
contributor. Obviously there are limitations that any editor will
confront trying to include so many. But it's worth noting that 33 (more
than a quarter) have more than one poem in the collection. Many others
have complete works that gather together distinct shorter pieces (e.g.
Clint Burnham, Susan Wheeler, Lori Baker). Just 34 are represented by
works larger than their meager page allotments and only a very few have
work present from anything that hints, however roughly, at a genuinely
longer form (Lew Daly, Dan Davidson, Brian Schorn).

Given that the overall age of contributors here is not significantly
younger than that of the poets of Tree (or the NAP), that turn away from
the longer form seems noteworthy, not accidental.

So that when I think of the vast number of G1 poets involved in longer
forms (not just from the Tree--where Coolidge, Greenwald, both Howes,
Watten, Hejinian, Rodefer, Melnick, Palmer, Benson, Harryman, Weiner,
Andrews, Inman, Darragh, Mayer, Sherry, DiPalma, and even Grenier have
written booklength works) but Scalapino, Dahlen, DuPlessis, Byrd,
Mackey, McCaffery, nichol, Brossard, Raworth, Fisher...the list just
goes on and on. While this doesn't and shouldn't negate the work of
those who work almost exclusively in shorter forms (Armantrout,
Robinson, Bernstein, for example), the difference in the overall
conception of the poem strikes me as profound. I'm interested in
exploring that distinction, the causes for it, and the implications of
it. Historically, history has not been kind to the authors of shorter
poems since WW2 (Creeley being the rather obvious exception), and my
comments re Lew Welch previously--to which nobody responded--still hold.

A second differentiation (and a whole other discussion) has been the
adoption of the unpunctuated fragment as a unit w/in the poem, which is
much more prevalent in G2 than G1 (tho it certainly has origins in Howe,
Coolidge, Grenier et al).

>Just as to say that the anthology indulges in
>"increasingly modest forms"
>is to do a great disservice to a whole slew
>of writers (who are these people, Ron?

See above.

>who is "returning to the lyric?

Here, the need for a good definition of the lyric really stands up. I
continue to insist on it as one of the 3 classic divisions of poetry,
the others being narrative & dramatic, the latter two having been
largely diverted via the evolution of other media, so that lyric (any
poem in which, contra narrative & drama, turns attention to the language
and not to constructs of plot or person) becomes diffuse, relatively
vague, which in turn leads to EP trying to reinstitute a trivium (melo,
phano, logo) w/in the confines of the lyric. There has been virtually no
good work BY POETS on this topic since then, but my gut feeling here is
that the evolution of the longpoem dramatically alters what "the lyric"
means, esp. when it is not of the "poem containing history" frame set by
Pound. So the absence of the longpoem represents a major statement.

>what are their numbers in this volume?

Roughly 98%.

>who is draining the social?
>what is the social and why is the lyric not social?--

Here the question of what is the motivation for the new lyric needs to
be articulated. Evans has made one attempt ("hatred of identity') and
SotA could be read as another, as could some of Chain's chain. But I
think this question is still totally on the table and unanswered. (So
I'm probably just being argumentative in characterizing it as a
draining, but I'd like to hear somebody specifically articulate the
function of the social w/in the form.)

Another issue to discuss would be those poets who were at the conference
who were not included in the book, vs. those who were not physically
present who were -- and the nature of the upper age limit. There is some
evidence to suggest that many women start to publish later than do men
(often for reasons of parenting responsibilities) and a simple
across-the-board age limit seems to carry in it a hidden gender bias
(thus Weinberger's restriction of his anthology to writers born before
the end of WW2 who were publishing after 1950 seems doubly set up to
limit the # of women. The difference in gender ratios between Tree and
the Art of Practice seems very much to reflect the latter book's ability
to bring in poets who had not begun to publish widely when I was working
on Tree in '81-2.)

You really aren't coming across as defensive. That's what makes your
comments here so valuable. I hate to use the charged word "authority"
but you wield it w/ confidence.

Okay. It's near midnight & I'm to bed. I'd love to see clarifications on
these clarifications.

So, Loss, I'm at a bit of a loss as to how to respond to your response
to my response to the many responses to the experiwhat thread. If your
post was a simple observation that few people are persuaded by arguments
about issues as close to home as how they conceive of their poetry, I
don't think there could be much argument about that. For better or for
worse, Because I Say So is probably a place most of us have wound up at
in conversations.

Still, I guess my response is So What? I can't say what the purpose of
this space in fact is, but I would never propose it as a place where
people should be persuaded of things. I certainly don't want to start
one of those long, self-reflexive debates about what exactly we're doing
here. I rarely know, frankly. Every once in while though, it seems
something provokes people to write of their own experiences with and in
poetry. Some kind of excitement gets generated, and to a certain extent
that seems adequate to me.

If it's not something I'm interested in, I tune it out, delete the
messages dead on the spot. Sometimes I just follow them and think about
what people are saying. Sometimes I foolishly leap in, knowing that it
will make no profound difference, but game for a conversation, as
far as it goes. At its best, it helps me work out certain thoughts and
feelings of my own, stuff I might not otherwise get to, like my feelings
about "experimental poetry". That really came up because of a conversation
with some students in one of my classes. I thought I'd see what others
with an intimate involvement with poetry thought of it. And I ended up
working out certain unresolved problems in my own thinking about issues
of prosody, poetic form, and their relation to forms of life (including
the so-called "social"). I certainly had no interest in trying to
force others into agreement with me.

In the meantime, I got to read Robert Kelly's interesting take on
experiment and alchemy, Don Byrd's proposal about the mainstream, George
Bowering's witty interjections, Alan Sondheim's interesting non-linear
notions of tradition, Ron Silliman's provocative analysis, Joel Kuszai's
very funny critique, and numerous other interesting takes on the
question of experiment and related threads.

So I guess I remain unclear on how Because I Say So relates to this
process, other than as an instigator of silence. But maybe your
experience of it is altogether different again.

Best,
Mike

It's a form, Mike,
and a reasonably interesting one in its own terms,
not dissimilar from Chain's chain
(EXCEPT for the gender ratios!!),

it's a "book"
unedited & in progress
(& indeed could eventually be collected as one
tho whether anyone would ever have the energy/dedication/$$ to do same
is an entirely different question)

&, as you note, its relation to "topic"
is contingent at best,

Subject:      Groups:  A Fable

Suppose we come down out of the pious talk about "groups" and talk about the
world we have seen--the seminar world--and the way groups gain power there.
Odd how no one seems to want to talk about things like this, things they've
actually witnessed.

As my contribution, let me tell you a completely fictional, utterly untrue story
about something which happened to a totally imaginary friend of mine.  Let's say,
just for fun, that this totally imaginary fictional untrue story took place in a
fantastical, imaginary place called San Francisco.  An imaginary friend of mine
was attached to a literary faction which defined itself by its noble refusal to become
involved in the academic-poetry world.  They published their own and each
others' poems, and then wrote the commentaries, creating a very efficient version
of a poetic perpetual-motion machine.  They were very fond of the more
bloodsoaked jargons of the earlier twentieth century, and did everything they
could to make the balmy prosperity of California play a Berlin-like, Petersburg-like
backdrop for their display of proud defiance--which was great, because you got the
defiance without having to deal with the cold weather and the secret police.

My wholly imaginary friend, who was growing older and lacked the absolute,
Berlin-like literary ego possessed by his friends in this faction, enrolled in graduate
school in the hope of finding a job.  He was instantly ostracized by his equally
imaginary friends in the faction.  He didn't exist any longer, as far as they were
concerned.

Now comes the equally formulaic, wholly invented punch-line.  My imaginary
friend found that he couldn't handle the slow pace and lack of conviction of the
academic world.  After a few years, he dropped out of graduate school, and lived
unhappily ever after in, let's say, Berkeley.  And six years after being frozen out by
this faction, he was walking through Berkeley when he met a high-ranking figure
in the faction, whose initials were--let's just choose some initials at random--RP.
And this RP, whose noble defiance had been among the noblest and most defiant
of noble defiances, greeted my friend cheerfully.  My friend found this surprising,
but as they chatted, he learned the reason for this cheery and forgiving tone.  The
imaginary faction member, the nobly defiant RP, was leaving to take a job with a
very prestiguous university press.

Moral of the story:  If you do it right, noble defiance pays like anything.

It's a lot of fun, but I had thought I might find in this conversation a

Well, Tony, I guess we could step behind the shit house and bombard each
other with poems. It might be fun, although whether it--or any other
fight you want to pick--will hold off whatever alien intelligence seems
to be secretly devouring (kind of like those slimy things in the recent
*Puppet Masters* movie) those dear old landmarks of cultural resistance
now sadly spiffed up in their Gap khakis and Nikes seems problematic.

Actually, thinking of my experience at its best on this thing, I am
reminded of Giorgio Agamben's *The Coming Community* where he writes
of a community of "whatever singularities" who "do not possess any
indentity to vindicate nor any bond of belonging for which to seek
recognition." Interestingly in terms of your point, he goes on:

        For the State, therefore, what is important is never
        the singularity as such, but only its inclusion in some
        identity, whatever identity (but the possibility of the
        *whatever* itself being taken up without an identity
        is a threat the State cannot come to terms with). (85)

The best way to resist the aliens then is not to battle for some new
identity (shades of Ron's comments on Alan Gilbert's piece in the
NC anthology) like King of the Beats, counter-culture Wild Man, a
Really Bad Guy, etc. which will only be integrated into the Spectacle
and sold (think also of the end of Bruce Sterling's *Islands in the
Net* where imitations of the Outlaw Revolutionarys' dune buggies
become a really hot item during the Christmas shopping season).
On the contrary, if resistance is of interest to you, perhaps the
only path left is to be *whatever*, as Agamben has it, and thus to
become absolutely irrelevant to the State.

Of course this won't help anybody get any governemnt money. If that's
what they want. Alas.

Best,
Mike

You reminded me that in "Hugh Selwyb Mauberley" toward the end
somewhere, HSM is called a drifting precipitatre, which suggests
(without the unfortunate r I stuck in that word) a chemistry lab. And
T.S.Eliot liked the word "transmute" regarding poetry and the poet's

ACTUAL POSSESSION OF THE WORLD *

John Cayley


actual possession of the world
left Gu Cheng exposed maimed and handicapped
this shining road back to the city
into his own shattered emptiness
finally I listened to the sounds like leaves or any other violence of the picture
there is something in their lives that keeps them following this sound
on the other side I could go anywhere
recall a life that is distant from our own
but this doesnt trouble me because I didnt use words
he constantly tried to return
following this phrase became the picture
once I thought I felt that a new young light had awoken in the woman
all softly speaking in a particular kind of way
one of the worlds unceasing infinity of transformations
the violation of corporal integrity is in the wind
they were flooded with both their lives
they were flooded with the body
and my ears went deaf
became fraught and fell ill and she asked me what colour
a truly extraordinary sound
the speech of the cascading rays
I didnt write poetry I didnt use words he claimed
taken from the world he had left long ago into his own shattered emptiness
living into this world

to imagine such hatred
I awoke I answered we keep on living I began to think of endless transformation
and in gesture like a secret afterwards I began to think of these phrases
they really were flying closer and they turned into words
dawn was the summit and night was speaking
for reasons that were flying closer
suddenly the sounds poured endlessly into my life because I didnt use words
taken from the world both created and enforced
I began to think of whiteness
this shining road back to the surface of the final sound

Yes, indeed, John, AMERICA A PROPHECY has been out of print for a long
time now, & many of us wish it weren't so. There is however little
chance for this to change, as getting a book of that order back into
print is extremely time consuming & expensive (find publisher,
renegotiate all the rights, etc.) Then again, maybe some University
press will pick the project up, as UC & UNM have done with other
Rothenberg anthos...

I just signed onto this list a couple of weeks ago and have been enjoying
the generation wars between G1 and G2, as if history started there! Ron's
metaphor of the owl on the horizon is compelling symbolism; it makes G2
into the mice to be preyed upon.  But mice can eat owls if there
are enough of them.  I am not a member of G1 because not a language poet
but I have a strong sense of being a member of the most in-the-shadow
generation, following the New Americans (sounds like a wholesome Up With
People type group).  Our generation is almost 50 years old and we're
still in that shadow (though langpo has cleared some space).  The best
policy is to honor the elders as long as they're friendly, and many of
them are.  The owl is also ego, kills the competition.  But this is not a
knock on you, Ron, as I know you are considerate of younger writers and
many others.  Did a big owl like Olson smother his young or feed them?
If I were of G2 age, I would never use the term as too junior-varsity.

Yes, "experimental" is a problem.  Creeley told me that it was too
self-marginalizing to use for title of Norton antho.  But we've put
ourselves in a corner by dismissing the term "avant-garde," which is
still accurate although perhaps too Eurocentric and precious.  This
leaves us with "outsider" (Waldman) and "postmodern" which still holds
but how long? Millenialist is as bad as experimental:  Eliot's hooded
hordes.  The adjective "innovative" is nice but thinking you have to
innovate each poem out is irritating.  Re: alchemy, Octavio Paz used
the term "alchemy of the word."  Probably we are much too
term-conscious because so eager to identify ourselves.  I thought for a
while of adopting the Chicago Imagist label but it seemed too self-
promoting.  Jackson Mac Low says that "avant-garde" is too militaristic
in its history.  So what?  The first into battle are the most
jeopardized, also get the largest honors.  We admire WCW and Pound for
it and try to do the same.

I thought that the discussion, however brief, on whether current practice
(avant-garde) has any social agency was of great value.  Does it,
except to pound on white men, meaning a good number of those present?
Or is experimental practice aestheticism?

I hear rumor of anthology wars from last summer.   I'd be interested in
having a copy of that discussion if anyone is willing to provide it.

Ron, I liked that long letter of yrs called "Flaming" of a little
while ago;

that is, if anyone can call the lyric reactionary, he/she hasnt read
Shelley with any intelligence. Some dolt might have something to say
about SAhelley's personal-social habits and position being out of it
today, but my guess is that same person might have worn mind shackles
in 1816.

Well, Mike, we know that Stein was trained in experimental
psychology, so it would be a good idea to believe her when she says
that she never wrote an experimental work (I presume that she was not
including her lab exercise in automatic writing.)

Nobody ever suggested that Shelley was unclear about his motivations.

I do recall writing that all form(s) is amoral. It can and does mean
different things at different points in time and in different hands. A
sonnet by Bernadette Mayer (now convalescing after a major stroke, by
the way) is not the same one by a Timothy Steele or Dana Gioia.

The world has changed since Shelley's time. Hell,
it's changed dramatically since 1980.

Can you imagine Olson on the net?

I feel like I'm stepping into an already established dialogue, but felt
compelled to respond to the issue of the political (in the widest
possible sense) implications of form.
     You know it was Adorno, arguably the most profound thinker in the
20th Cent. who originated that impossibility of lyric poetry after
Auschwitz thing, which he later backed away from actually, but he also
said some other things about form.
     If I understand the gist of his statement on form, as articulated
in Aesthetic Theory, then any form may be reactionary if it fails to
reognize its own implication in domination. Not in any kind of vulger
form, ie, those bastard capitalists, but in a much more sophisticated
sense of accepting the form as a given. Without recognizing the problems
of that form, its darkness. So any form can be troublesome if its
assumptions are not criticized at the same time they are utilized.
Which is why Beckett was his favorite 20th cent. writer.
     And this is why I agree with you re: Shelley. I don't think
Shelley accepted anything as given, just see Prometheus Unbound.
     Which is why this formal question is so difficult today, because
there are so many forms; new ones everyday. Langpo (to borrow Paul's
phrase) is its form, in a certain sense, and has its own problems
and assumptions. And of course its own strengths. I think we are
making the problem of form far too easy if we define form as simply
being about the choice between sonnet or blank verse.
     The problem is for us, ie G2 or whatever, is that we are given so many new
 forms and somehow we have to determine how to use them. I don't know
if this generation will sole that problem. I don't know if solve is the
right word even. The main problem might be that the new forms become as
fixed as the old.

        Ron Silliman asks,
> Can you imagine Olson on the net?

        It's hard to know where you are on the net.  I am in
Albany (it's been snowing off and on all day, nasty winds, and
temperature dropping toward 20)? That's Ron Silliman? In
California? Other people in the conversation who are unlocated
in my mind. I look at the UserIDs trying to find a place...
Sometimes I  can (mebbe), but you are never sure.

        The net is ultimate suburb, the perfection of New
Jersey.

        But it is hard to be any where, any time and especially now.
If you are in Gloucester, are you in Gloucester?  They are closing down the
fishing on George's Bank. It is certainly not the Gloucester
that Olson saw out the window at 28 Fort Square.

The _polis_ as FORM is lost to life? There is no way to understand the
form of _Maximus_ by examining its language.Perhaps there is no
way to understand it at all.  I remember when it was possible.

        He would have said (I think) that form is a matter
of not of linguistic arrangement but a judgement of action:

that that which has been found out by work may, by work, be passed on
(without due loss of force)
for use
       USE
                ("The Praises")....

Form is not a container but a transmission. The gains on a non-referential
art that were made in the 50's and 60's have been mostly lost. The world
that made them possible has been perhaps lost.  CO proposed not
to write sonnets or limericks but A Republic!!!

        The net  offers a powerful referential medium with no
reference. It was a condition that Ron Silliman and others proposed
by elegant artifice fifteen or more years ago.  Now it appears to
be universal.

        The net must have a wonderous topology. I have been
exploring it for nearly ten years.  At first it was just me and
the computer nerds.  And I understand it less--in some
really deep sense--than if I'd been plopped down  on the moon.

I think Don has, in his moving comments about Olson, form, place, polis,
& net, brought us back to a discussion which was never resolved (& can't
be, but must be undertaken) many months ago on this list, that of the
possibility for community on the net.

I too don't often know the place I inhabit any more. Can it be known? I
find some important element of community on a forum like this one. Yet,
in spending time her, I spend less time outside, walking in the
neighborhood, or down to the banks of the Mississippi. A choice I make in
which something is lost.

Living in a medium with lots of meaning but little reference. Form which
indeed exists to be utilized & needs to be critized.

Dear Don:

I guess I think in some way it's really no harder to know where you
are on the net than to know where you are in "Gloucester". In fact,
maybe in some ways it's easier in that in so far as both the net and
"Gloucester" are utopias, or tend at one edge toward utopia, at least
here there's no danger of confusing it with fishermen. I've known a
few fishermen (in the olden days when I was involved in street
politics in Vancouver) and while some have been OK guys, many of them
were jerks. Just like everybody else. The thing about Gloucester is
that it was so pretty it was a great place to think about
"Gloucester", but Gloucester was never "Gloucester", and the
"Gloucester" that Charles Olson saw out of the window at 28 Fort
Square wasn't Gloucester, either.

I think the polis as FORM was lost to us about 2,000 years ago. Our
nostalgia for it is certainly real, and can be, as in Olson's work or
Emerson's, productive of a perfectionist (to use Stanley Cavell's
word) vision or imagination, Socrates' city of words. Socrates says
that it makes no difference whether "Gloucester" exists anywhere or
will exist, that by reading "Maximus" we are already always
participating in it, and that "Maximus" itself is thus a further
proposal of our selves, unattained but attainable.

"Here", in some sense, at least it's impossible to confuse the city of
words with any other. That may offer us possibilities, as well as
losses.

As Bob Creeley says, onward . . .

Best,
Mike

I don't know about the automatic writing, George. It was actually
Peter Quartermain who told me she said that. (Peter, are you listening?
reading? whatever? Where is that quote from?) But you're right. Given
her training as scientist and her vocation as writer, her insights

re: "all form(s) is amoral," I think it might be better to say that
all form is moral rather than amoral. It is not possible to give value
to a form that is not moral or political at base. Partly this is a
matter of intention, and a sonnet by Dana Gioia as one by Bernadette,
may certainly be a moral or political act at that level. Partly, it is
an understanding of means, or rather of the meaning of means, and the
morals or politics of poets surely differ here. This is not intention
but interpretation, where one can argue what is correct, what is true,
what is useful, what is specific, to the point. The problem is that
so often this argument -- an essential one -- occurs on grounds so
general as to be useless in itself, viz. dubbing one or another poetry
"experimental" or one or another poet "conventional" (as the apexers
do in setting the other pole of straw men [to mix metaphors] and
set up their place in the juste milieu between 'em). Fernando Pessoa
wrote an enormous range of poetries under a number of different
names, including a long sequence of (what appear to my groping
Portugese-less romance language intuitive reach-without-grasp to be)
fantastic quatrains in popular form. To take an example from what's
on my desk. One does not, for example, right a sonnet w/o encountering
a political and social history, write?

        Shelley, it is said, used to hum out the metric/rhymic patterns
of his poems and then rite them. I recommend to each of you to undertake
this procedure in preparing your posts. First sound them out without
sense, only then sense them, and only then riot them here.

What about WCW, "all sonnets say the same thing--to me of no interest"
(or more or less to that effect).  There may be a not insignificant way
in which this assertion is right, the first half of it I mean; as to the
chaser one just concurs or doesn't (Creeley: liking is as liking
does--for you / for me).

Some years ago some friends recommended a possible way to proceed on an
interesting poetic career: write only (commissioned? or feigned
commissioned) occasional poems.  But it's probably less intresting, or
less easy anyway, to think through the politics of occasion ("I write bc
I want to write"?).  Though all form is also occasional (though I guess
different sonnets may have different occasions).

Recently teaching Dickinson: I wonder if one could make a point about all
off-rhyme always being whatever.

        I guess we all have our dead horses; Adorno is one of mine.
Would *anybody* like to have the references to this "profound" man's
attempts to get along with and prosper under the Nazi regime? His
position that as only half Jewish he might be allowed to work
profitably in a new order Germany, his reviews of rather pro-Nazi
German younger poets, the meaning -- in germany at the time -- of
his using the name Adorno (non-jew mom's moniker, I believe) rather
than Wiesengrund (jew-pop dad's identity)? Not to mention does
anybody have a hold on or interest in his treatment of Walter
Benjamin, his caviling criticisms of Benjamin's proposals and
submissions to the then in NY Adorno/Horkheimer crew, a more
generous response to which might have led to WB's escaping Europe
rather than dying there, Benjamin's (and Scholem's, and Arendt's)
opinion of Adorno at the time (and in Arendt's case, thruout her life:
she detested him. I was her student for many years, and learned my
antiTeddyism from her directly)?

Tom--
I'll bite at the rhtorical question and say yes, /I/ want to know.
Beyond what's in the two Susan Buck-Morss books, say.  That is, I know
something about Adorno's treatment of Benjamin (and while the early B-M
book kind of flaggellates Benjamin w Adorno's suposedly greater
perspicacity, the more recent book does the reverse).  But what about
Adorno and the Third Reich.  Or what about Arendt off the cuff?

        What is it that has happened since, say, 1970 (Olson's
death)?  or even earlier.  In 1966 Jacques Derrida declared,
"Perhaps something has occurred in the history of the concept
of structure that could be called an 'event.'"  An event that is
not an event.  At the very moment the technologists began to
take seriously the possibility of producing cognition of a human
order, knowledge in the so-called human sciences also
collapsed. It was also in 1966, Michel Foucault wrote: "The
only thing we know at the moment, in all certainty, is that in
Western culture the being of man and the being of language
have never, at any time, been able to coexist and to articulate
themselves upon one another."

         So, what has happened in practical terms.  We have
been blitzed by the right from Reagan to Newt Gingrich (who
speak confidently of the being of man, without questioning the
status of their discourse).  Even the most media-genic
experiwhat/avant/new artists have disappeared from all
popular media--e.g. Ginsberg and Sanders at the Chicago
convention in 68.  The biosphere is a quarter-century nearer
irreparable damage.  Most viable political organization among
the thoroughly excluded classes has collapsed. Sex has become
potentially deadly.  AIDS Research is in utterly disarray and
the entire establishment that controls it (probably in collusion
with the drug companies) is thoroughly corrupt.  Organized
opposition to the military has disappeared.  The Cold War has
ended.  The industrial dislocations in the military industries
are at least in some measure being compensated for by
building prisons. Over a million people, most of them men of
color, are in prison in the United States. There has been a
general loss of enthusiasm for and support of education.  The
youth culture has been fragmented into various youth
subculture, so the youth market is expanded while the political
power of the young is defused.  The dominance of both electoral
and cultural politics by the popular media is now
unchallenged even by a symbolically significant opposition.
Phony science (_The Bell Curve_, etc.) is having a powerful
effect on U.S. social policy, and legitimate science (if there is
any left) seems powerless to oppose it.  Leftist politics has been
consigned almost exclusively to English departments.  Any
thing in the arts and liberal disciplines that smells of
metaphysics has been declared illusory.  The metaphysicians
are now physicists and computer scientists: Stephen Hawking,
Herbert Simon, et. al.  The life of the President has been
threatened by the senior Senator from North Carolina and
presumably the next Chair of the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee.  We are all on the Internet.

        The appearance of the Internet is one of the few perhaps
positive public developments in the last quarter century.  When
I first connected in 86 or 87, there was the Humanist List, as
one of the few attractions for anyone who wasn't involved in
scientific or technological research.  And it has been
fascinating to watch it grow, the interest groups beginning to
have narrower definitions, until literally the relevant, if not
entirely useful, information seems endless.  But, it may be that
the Internet is just talk radio for the fringe.  For all of its
promise, it has yet to produce much.

        The task of production seems to me fundamentally
unchanged.

        I have been reading Wesley Trimpi's _Muses of One
Mind_  (Princeton UP, 1983) the last few days. It is an old-
fashioned book, literary theory heavily informed by classical
philology.  Although Trimpi seems to be fully cognizant of
contemporary theoretical debate, he makes no reference to any
of the major philosophers or theoreticians of this century and
precious few references to any secondary sources: he ranges
from Hesiod to Plotinus and Proclus:

        "As the daughters of Zeus and Memory, together [the
muses] recollect,Jpreserve, and celebrate the integrated
activities and the cumulative wisdom of the gods.  They offer to
us as human beings, furthermore, the possibility of sharing in
the contents of this wisdom to the extent that we realize our
capacity to understand and describe our experience.  In this
sense, the Muses, together, provide the psyche with the
sources of its coherence and express this coherence as
mutually dependent principles in order.  These principles, in
turn, later give direction to the various disciplines which
define and exercise the  speculative, the prudential, and the
productive activities of the consciousness."

        These "disciplines" are, of course, philosophy, which
rules over the cognitive capacity; rhetoric which rules over the
judicative capacity; and mathematics which rules over the
formal capacity.  As such they are the constituents of the what
Plato called "the Good"--that is, the true, the justly measured,
and the beautiful.  If these are united metaphysically in
Platonic thought, Trimpi argues--and here seems to me offer
in coherent fashion a position close to Olson's--in disciplines
themselves forms are actually constructed, not underwritten
by the infinite ideal norm of the logos, and that in poetry these
disciplines are enacted as secular and inhabitable forms of the
Good, called polis, Gloucester, Tyre, and potentially, I think,
the Internet.

        Trimpi goes on to show with formidle scholarhship
(again confirming speculations of Olson's speculations of
thirty years earlier) that literary and aesthetic theory by the
time of the Neoplatonists, had been mathematicized; the
concrete unity of the muses was lost; and literature was
already prepared for the kind of deconstruction that its fully
articulated Neoplatonic form would reveal as necessary.

        Of course, Trimpi's "cumulative wisdom of the gods"
will make some nervous; no doubt some will find in it code for
the transcendental signifier.  I suppose the unity of psyche will
also be read out as the modern subject and the promise of
coherence as a threat of fascism.

        Trimpi, however, makes a plausible case that _poiesis_
before the Platonic revival of the renaissance (that
fundamental moment in Pound's _Cantos_) was innocent of
metaphysical and transcendental reference (that is, of infinite
images of normative ideality).

        I would suggest in the spirit of Olson's project, as I
understand it, that the construction of net can only proceed as
a pursuit of the muses in Trimpi's cogent sense.  Speculation,
action, and formalization are singularly futile, but as mutually
correcting modes of coherence,  they produce something more
concrete than a utopian vision; that is to say, a living company
on inquirers.JIn the etymology of "muse," Trimpi finds--
striving, loving, and inquiry-- notions associated with
philosophy, but in Hesiod and in the early theories of literature
they are balanced with action and concrete construction, not
abstract or metaphysical meditation.

        The power of Olson's constructivism has not been much
investigated.  I would point to the work of John Clarke,
Charles Stein, Nate Mackey, and Madelaine Gins' recent and
utterly remarkable _Helen Keller, or Arakawa_    To be sure,
transcendence may look fairly thin when it is not backed up by
the authority of some one like Stephen Hawking, but it does not
mean we must suffocate in the merely social.  The world is to
be actually constructed, not infered from an idealized norm.

re Benjamin, and the question of experimentation, and the question of
commodification of culture:  Lutz Niethammer, in his superb analysis of
the many, many theories of the end of history across cultures and time,
tells the story of Benjamin's death, with which I had previously not been
familiar:  Benjamin walked out of Germany, in I believe 1945, and as soon
as he crossed the border handed the first peasant he saw the manuscript
he was carrying, and then committed suicide.  That ms. was his book on
the end of history .... Sandra Braman

That seems a bit of a romantizised version of Benjamin's death, with
geographic confusion. He was in the process of crossing the Pyrenees
(from France into Spain, in order to reach Portugal, from whence ships
to the US or GB) when he committed suicide -- as far as I am aware, in
a state of depression & despair, as the last stage of that harrowing crossing
proposed unforeseen dangers that, it would seem, Benjamin was not able
or willing to cope with. I never heard of the handing over of a ms. to
the first peasant met -- that seems too pat a narration & would make sense
only in relation to the geographical confusion, i.e. if he had in fact
crossed the German French border.

There's a full account of Benjamin's crossing and the iffy question of
the manuscript in Susan Buck-Morss' /The Dialectics of Seeing: Walter
Benjamin and the Arcades Project/.  As I recall it seems possible he did
turn the ms. (which may have been a chunk of the Arcades Project I think)
over to a mother and son, not literati, w whom he was crossing, or I
guess he MAY have done so, no one has been able to determine definitely):
but it wasn't perhaps a passing of the torch kind of gesture exactly.
Anyway Buck-Morss is a good place to go for clarification.

To clarify: I did not refer to Adorno because I believed he was the most
honorable man in the world. In fact, I believe his treatment of the student
protest movement alone proves he was confused at best in many of his personal
relationships, including that with Benjamin. He seemed to always let his
intellectual judgments cloud his personal ones. The years before Benjamin's
saw a weakening of their friendship due primarily to the Arcades project,
and other projects Adorno saw as non-dialectical. Personally, I think he
misunderstood completely Benjamin's final work.

But I think mostly that's beside the point. The great Olson himself, as
Tom Clark's bio demonstrates, was not always the most honorable man.
Does that mean we stop reading him? Does that mean his thinking is less
profound? Why?

All I was tryingto indicate was that I believed Adorno's conception of the
dialectical relationship of form and content might be extremely useful to
anyone writing in late capitalism. At one time, perhaps we could extricate
artistic form, popular culture, critical thinking and our lives from
commodification but monopoly capitalism certainly has squashed that possibility
Adorno's notion that we can resist commodification in our work by resisting the
form of our work, by having our work work against itself, seems to me useful.

Finally, to rescue the allegorical reading of Benjamin's death in the most
immediate effect of his death: When the Spanish border guards discovered
Benjamin's body, they grew so disturbed and frightened about the implications
of what they had donethat they let all of the people who had traveled with
Benjamin from Paris cross the border and disappear into Spain.

X-To:         poetics@UBVMS.BITNET

In its eighth year, M/E/A/N/I/N/G, an artist-run journal of
contemporary art, remains an important meeting ground between
critical and theoretical ideas and language, and the actual
practice of visual art by working artists. It is an inclusive,
lively, contentious, provocative, and unprogrammatic forum for
new ideas in the arts.

Library Journal writes about M/E/A/N/I/N/G: "This attractive,
large-format critical journal contains controversial and
provocative comments and reviews related to the contemporary art
scene. This eminently readable journal, which seems to display a
particular interest in women~s issues, gives voice to new views
and is an excellent choice for medium and larger academic
collections."

M/E/A/N/I/N/G is published twice a year in the fall and spring.

Editors: Susan Bee and Mira Schor.

M/E/A/N/I/N/G #16 features:

From issue #16, Fall 1994:

I see no contradiction in being an artist in a media-based
culture. TV, movies, and advertising are potentially just as
interesting as works in the traditional fine arts. Conversely,
paintings can be potentially more boring than a string of
commercials. -- Kathe Burkhart

If Sex, Race, and Homophobia, are the major headlines of art at
the close of the 20th century then how do I, as a formal,
geometric, abstract painter fit in? -- Michael Windle
Painting has become purespectacle losing its power to do harm.
It has become like the oppressed feminine: domestic,shallow,
empty, ineffectual, fickle, decorative. -- Rebecca Quaytman

When I first found I could make artwork about the frustration,
anguish, and stupidity of my own life, I wept with relief. --
Julia Jacquette

In many ways I think my work is about terror management, the
control of phobia through humor. -- Amy Sillman

************Announcement of Segue Foundation Newsletter************


Segue is well-known to many of you as a distributor of small press titles
and as a publisher. Though we recently lost our distribution grant, it may
surprise you how much Segue does beyond its former role as a distributor.
For
those of you who aren't so familiar with Segue, this newsletter fleshes out
Segue
as an important part of a much larger arts community. In addition, in this
issue
there's a list of current titles offered by Segue/Roof Books; a review of
P.
Inman's new Roof book _criss cross_; as well as press-time comments on Ron
Silliman's new Roof book _N/O_.

Segue has also published this newsletter in a HyperText version which is
accessible through the writing.upenn.edu Gopher server and may be viewed
with
any hypertext browser (Mosaic, or similar browsers) at:

gopher://writing.upenn.edu/hh
/internet/library/e-journals/ub/rift
/journals/list/Segue/Segue_Newsletter.

In the near future, all Segue/Roof titles will be made available via the
internet by filling out an on-line form. Segue as a distributor will
resurface!

Thank you for your patience with this long post. I hope that the
information and reviews are worth your while. We also encourage any
responses or
queries and would be glad to consider reviews of forthcoming books for
publication here and in the HyperText version.

          Segue Foundation Newsletter - November 1994


The Segue Foundation is mainly a literary organization. It is the publisher

of Roof and Segue Books (edited by James Sherry). Segue also acts as a
fiscal
conduit for projects grants for several arts organizations such as
M/E/A/N/I/N/G magazine (a journal of art and criticism edited by Mira Schor
&
Susan Bee); Sally Silvers & Dancers ( an aesthetically and politically
radical
dance troupe in NYC); Big Allis (a journal of new poetry edited by Melanie
Nielson & Jessica Grim); the Ear Inn Reading Series (conducted every
Saturday
at the Ear Inn in SoHo), and the INCISIONS Prison Arts Project, (weekly
poetry workshops conducted in various NY state correctional facilities by
Janine
Vega).

From 1977 - 1993 the Segue distribution project promoted and sold over
500 small press poetry titles annually. This distribution service has been
converted into the Segue Information Archive. The archive, located in the
Segue offices, will include every book that Segue distribution has ever
carried
and it will be complimented by new titles from authors and new presses as
well
as materials such as manuscripts and correspondence from private author's
collections. The Segue Information Archive will represent a substantial
free-
access collection devoted to new writing.

The offices of the Segue Foundation are located at the heart of East
Village, the most thriving artistic communitie in New York City. The
building in
which the office is located is an artist owned cooperative, it includes 12
artist
live/work coops, a 1200 square foot performance space, and Film editing
facilities. The performance space managed by Segue is used as a low cost
dance
rehearsal space during the day and in the evenings we sponsor various
ongoing
film, dance and music series.


Segue Foundation, Roof Books

Roof Books, edited by James Sherry, is pleased to announce the
publication of two new titles; criss cross, by P. Inman (see review of
criss cross
by Hank Lazer) and N/O by Ron Silliman. Though different in their formal
approach to the page and text, both Inman and Silliman present a textual
artifact
which challenges our assumptions of locution and language. Both present
texts
which unknot normal attempts at consumption while aiding our understanding
of languages as both necessary and critical. Each of these new titles can
be
ordered through Segue; receive a 20% discount when you order from Segue and

mention this newsletter. (click here for Segue Address)  (For other books
by
Inman, Silliman and many other writers, see the list of Other Roof Books in
this
newsletter.)

Here's a glimpse of some press-time reviews:

criss cross, by P. Inman

64pp., paper, ISBN 0-937804-57-6, $7.95

P. Inman has a first name that is not a letter. It is a work. His work also

raises such questions for the reader. If a reader is sure of what she is
saying, she
does not need P. Inman's work. If she has doubts, reading P. Inman is a
good
idea.

Roof Books is publishing P. Inman against the grain of ordinary poetics,
but right in the face of digital reality. Before one thinks of bytes,
Inman's bits
represent a primary block of languages, all languages, foreign, domestic,
binary,
all have to pass through Inman's thoroughfares.

Criss cross is a tour of the process of navigating the realms of
experimentation, witness, and critique, an invitation to participatory
poetic
locution. You, as reader, are given the gift of transience.  Diane Ward

By fully semanticizing the so-called nonsemantic features of language,
Inman creates a dialectic of the recuperable & the unreclaimable, where
what
cannot be claimed is nonetheless most manifest resistant to habitual
comprehension as the ambiguous figure and similarly raises questions about
the
nature of perception. Like Beckett, Inman challenges his reader/audience. .
.to
consider what is fundamental, presence or absence. Joan Retallack

Inman's poetry lies in how this language becomes known in the
contemplative strategies it proposes and in what it becomes known as.
Inman's
poetry an emblem of poetry, of how it sets on a page, the page in a book,
how a
book opens, before one's eyes and in the mind, and how the mind in relation
to
its knowns becomes material. Ben Friedlander

P. Inman was born on Long Island and educated at Georgetown. He is a
member of the AFSCME Local 2910s Executive Board. His work has appeared
in magazines and anthologies including: In the American Tree and From the
Other Side of the Century. His books include: Ocker, Red Shift, Think of
One,
and Uneven Development.


Review of criss cross by Hank Lazer

words for windows. movement of phrases, words, syllables. bump up
against margins, boxes, forms, periods. rarely if ever "personally
expressive." as
if transmitted. scrolling up & down. a sense of recurrence & reshuffling.
orders:
taking orders, manifesting orders. the criss-crossing and intersecting of
shuffled
and deployed lines. rarely if ever traditionally descriptive. a coolness.
mondrian-
like stripes of words. a beckett-like world of seemingly disembodied
articulation. rarely if ever to be confused with speech. the page as a
canvas or
body upon which the lines inch about. simple whole numbers of their re-
combinings. stubbornly resistant to readings which might resituate or
paraphrase or thematize Inman's writing. eleven different assemblies.
"prose
arrived to fragments./ pulch. work stoppage balled up// as content. moeb
grammar." readings within the loop; on the beltway. 1, 6, 6; 2, 6, 6; 3, 6,
6; 4, 6, 6:
5, 6, 6: 6, 6, 6. and other workings out, equations, formulas, floor plans,
blue
prints. from narrow strips to paragraph-wide blocks. "otherwise is that
forever."
a fill of/ sentences the ditch of what i mean."" and ""every of doubt words
into
distance."" in this book we see the units assemble and advance or
disappear. that
process is what we see as much as anything. we see the words in their
placement
moreso than in their service to other allegedly communicative purposes.
"such a
thin of the book the beginning of an offspring beside/ one line. how did
distance
become as dim as nosed. the brook/ of edges in a dictionary." if a stanza
is also a
room, Inman's book a floor plan, designs with designs upon us, lines
assigned to
available spaces. "sensation than/ signification" -- odd intersections of
words on
the page. i highly recommend you see & sense these. an engaging not
uninviting
terrain. "small wavelets out to something." "how they think the distance
left."
and across it, left & right, up & down, footprints. impressions.
impressive.

Hank Lazer



Ron Silliman - N/O

112pp / paper / ISBN 0-937804-56-8 / $10.95

He lives the most passionate life of the mind in America. He is a poet I
read to break through into new halls and colonnades of verbal richness
that,
before, I simply didn't know were sealed up behind these walls and dead
ends in
the palace of art. His work must be studied, lived with. Its pleasures
cannot be
simply lapped up off its surfaces. But they are the subtler, sharper, and
more
resonant for the time they take to taste.Samuel R. Delany

Silliman has developed a shorthand method of getting it all down. There
is something incredibly moving about his cap city and capability, his will
and
willfulness his hunger to know and absorb as he rants, records, juxtaposes,

declares, riffs, puns, pans. . .Tom Beckett

Ron Silliman was born in the state of Washington in 1946. He has been a
prison and tenant organizer, a lobbyist, a teacher, a college
administrator, editor
of Socialist Review, and a marketeer in the computer industry. Long a
national
leader of the Language-centered writing movement, Ron Silliman's poetry and

criticism have influenced an entire generation of poets. His concept of the
New
Sentence spawned literally dozens of efforts based on his idea of prose
writing.
N/O is two letters of his ongoing alphabet series. Long a national leader
of the
Language-centered writing movement, Ron Silliman's criticism has influenced

an entire generation of poets. His concept of the New Sentence spawned
literally
dozens of efforts based on his idea of prose writing. His commentaries on
the
writing of his peers act as the most comprehensive introduction to this
fascinating new writing style and at the same time are the perfect example
of that
writing. Each essay is filled with vital information and is itself a formal

innovation. N/O is two letters of his ongoing poem, The Alphabet.

Segue Distribution Archive

by Ricardo Tarrega-Shayegan

In November 1993, Segue received a general support grand of $3,500
from the Joyce Mertz-Gilmore foundation. The Foundation supports
organizations that "provide critical behind the scenes suppport to the
artistic
community at low cost, or no charge." Segue has been providing such
services -
a space for reading and rehearsals and for research collections - for
seventeen
years. Thanks to this grant we have been able to begin setting up an
archive of
the materials that Segue has distributed. The project is being headed by
Heather
Ramsdell who is identifying and locating the core of the collection;
writing to
authors, publishers and editors, as well as organizing materials already in

Segue's possession.
Right now, Segue has approximately 30% of the materials it would like to
have in the core collection, which would include all the poetry and prose
books
distributed by Segue throughout the years, its collection of poetics
titiles and the
anthologies and magazines it has distributed. Ideally the collection would
be
augmented by audio and video tape collections as well as selections from
author's collections and correspondence. Once complete, the collection will
be
housed at Segue or loaned in collaboration with other poetry venues in New
York. We look forward to continuing our committment to the project and the
Joyce Mertz-Gilmore Foundation's generous grants helps make this possible.


M/E/A/N/I/N/G Magazine (see Susan's 11/27 post on M/E/A/N/I/N/G)

by Susan Bee

 M/E/A/N/I/N/G is a biannual, artist-run publication edited by two
painters, Susan Bee and Mira Schor. M/E/A/N/I/N/G is committed to providing

an inclusive forum for the discussion of a broad range of issues of concern
to
professional visual artists through the publication of writing by artists,
art
historians and critics. Among the writers we have published are Johanna
Drucker, Amelia Jones, Robert C. Morgan, Whitney Chadwick, Charles
Bernstein and Rob Storr. M/E/A/N/I/N/G provides a crucial alternative to
the
commodification of art discourse in the established art magazines. We are
not
concerned with career promotion, or the "best selling" movements. By
publishing writing by and for artists, we provide a needed bridge between
critical and theoretical ideas and language, and the actual practice of
visual art
by working artists.
 M/E/A/N/I/N/G regularly publishes forums on current issues,
encouraging responses from a wide range of visual artist. Past forums have
explored motherhood and artmaking, racism in the art world, making art over
a
lifelong career, issues of community. Some of the artist published in these

forums are Leon Golub, David Reed, David Humphrey, Nancy Spero, Miriam
Schapiro, Ann Messner and Richard Tuttle.
 The Segue Foundation acts as our umbrella organization and helps us
with grant applications and acts as a conduit for grant funding, but it
does not
add monetarily to our budget. Segue also assists us in distribution, bulk
mailing
and other postal services. M/E/A/N/I/N/G's relationship the Segue
Foundation
has been extremely useful to us; as working artists with active
professional lives,
The Segue Foundation has helped us produce M/E/A/N/I/N/G with a minimum
of bureaucracy or red tape.


Sally Silvers and Dancers

by Sally Silvers

My history as a Segue-connected artist goes back almost 14 years. The
foundation has been the non-profit conduit home for Sally Silvers and
Dancers
since our first bulk mailing in 1981. (We're both housed at the Segue
sponsored
artist live-work coop/performance space in the Segue offices building on
East
8th St. in New York.) I also currently serve on the Segue Performance Space

board.
In the early 80's Segue was the perfect locus for my "non-obedient" stance
to the existing dance world: low-riding minimalism and pushing
narrative/persona based theatrical dance with a vengeance (initially as
message
oriented statement in an early response to Reagonism, but also consensual
transparency as a commercially linked career op). I found aesthetic
inspiration
from many of the writers associated with L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E Magazine and
Roof books. I wanted to politicize the body, show movement as a social
circuitry
inherent in the way the body moved (utilizing predicaments, presenting
movement analytically, disjunctively, maximally -- to have the "message,"
grounded in the social) . The writers I admired most (some published by
Roof/Segue) linked this kind of formal and political radicalism.
My early self-produced evening-length concerts (some 15 from 1980-88)
were all performed under the auspices of the Segue Foundation and took
place
at spaces like The Cunningham Studio and Ethnic Folk Arts Center. For the
last
6 years Segue has been my fiscal conduit for project grants like a Meet the

Composer collaboration with composer John Zorn, performed at the Joyce
Theater; a dance/theater presentation with poet Bruce Andrews on gender,
Nicaragua, control/discipline, etc., and a 6 minute film collaboration with

filmmaker Henry Hills, "The Little Lieutenant." The film has toured
internationally, has won festival prizes and now has a European
distributor. 1995
will be a full year for SS&D.
 Upcoming are 5 weeks of teaching in Holland; an improvisation festival
in December in NYC; an evening at Symphony Space in Feb., 1995. The '95 New

York City season with all new works starts in April at P.S. 122. We also
will be
doing a film project with Henry Hills which begins production in the
spring.


INCISIONS/ARTS - Prison Arts Program

by Janine Vega


INCISIONS/ARTS has been organizing writing workshops and
performances at New York State Correctional Facilities for men and women,
and Division for Youth Residences and Secure Centers since 1978. Our
writing
programs have ranged from six week residencies, to long-running residencies
at
Sing-Sing and Bedford Hills which have continued for years. Resident
writers
usually come in to the facility once a week, meeting with inmate writers
who
have been selected or have chosen to take part. The workshop is conducted
through discussion of technique and of individual inmates work. The aim of
the
workshop process is to generate new methods of discovery and new ways of
writing.
 Recently we have been emphasizing a final event or project: a poetry
reading, shared with the rest of the population, administration and staff;
a short
play or screenplay from a drama workshop; or an anthology of poetry,
fiction or
nonfiction. If an anthology is chosen as the final project, one is
presented to each
participating writer. We have found that aside from being a source of
delight
and pride, the anthology is an immensely effective reminder of the capacity
for
self-expression and as a continuing encouragement to keep writing. Some of
our
anthologies have received critical acclaim in American Book Review, Contact

11 Longhouse, Poetry Project Newsletter, Poetry Flash and the Woodstock
Times.
 INCISIONS/ARTS has received grants from the New York State
Council on the arts, Sing Sing Educational Department, Poets and Writers,
The
Vinmont Foundation, Longtermers Committee at Bedford Hills. Witter Bynner
Foundation, Riverside Prison Foundation and private sponsors. We have had
successful residencies at Sing Sing C. F., Hopper House, Creedmoor
Psychiatric
Center's Forensic Unit, Bellevue Prison Ward, Green Haven C. F., Rikers
Island for Women, Bayview C. F. for Women, Bedford Hills C.F., Green Haven
C. F., Highland R. C. for Boys, Sojourner Truth R. C. for Girls, and Harlem

Valley Secure Center for Boys.
 INCISIONS/ARTS has been written about in the New York Times. Our
Sing Sing workshop was covered by Bill Moyers on PBS with poet Quincy
Troupe; One of our writers read her work for Channel 31 in New York City,
and
WBAI has broadcast portions of our Sing Sing Christmas Poetry Reading.
 The only lasting changes in a person happen from the inside out. The
INCISIONS/ARTS writing program works by encouraging the participants to
clarify their opinions, to articulate and accept their feelings and to
examine and
express themselves and their world with depth and vision. For the inmate,
the
writing process thus becomes a considerable and material process for
change.

I have been pondering for a long time (between trips) Wallace's
suggestion that "flaming" is a heterosexist word.
Dont quite get it.
When The Human Torch said "flame on!" was there an implication I
wasnt getting?
And what about the Calgary Flames? Were they chased out of Atlanta by
a conservative Southern city hall?

Well, I heard that he got to the Spanish border with his party and
they were refused entrance because of some bureaucratic screw-up.
(this, incidently, after the party had stayed with Bryher and H.D. in
Switzerland--Bryher was apparently deeply involved in getting Jewish
refugees out of Germany) That night, in despair, he gave what he had
of his manuscript, as someone already said, the Arcades project, to
someone else in the party, and then went off alone and killed
himself believing that they were stuck in Vichy France. The next day
the bureaucratic glitch unravelled spontaneously and they were all
allowed to cross the border.

It seems no matter which way you get it, it resonates uncannily with
meaning.

          Segue Foundation Newsletter - November 1994

 The Segue Foundation is mainly a literary organization. It is the
publisher

of Roof and Segue Books (edited by James Sherry). Segue also acts
as a fiscal conduit for projects grants for several arts
organizations such as M/E/A/N/I/N/G magazine (a journal of art and
criticism edited by Mira Schor & Susan Bee); Sally Silvers &
Dancers ( an aesthetically and politically radical dance troupe in
NYC); Big Allis (a journal of new poetry edited by Melanie Nielson
& Jessica Grim); the Ear Inn Reading Series (conducted every
Saturday at the Ear Inn in SoHo), and the INCISIONS Prison Arts
Project, (weekly poetry workshops conducted in various NY state
correctional facilities by Janine Vega).

>From 1977 - 1993 the Segue distribution project promoted and sold
over 500 small press poetry titles annually. This distribution
service has been converted into the Segue Information Archive. The
archive, located in the Segue offices, will include every book
that Segue distribution has ever carried and it will be
complimented by new titles from authors and new presses as well as
materials such as manuscripts and correspondence from private
author's collections. The Segue Information Archive will represent
a substantial free- access collection devoted to new writing.

The offices of the Segue Foundation are located at the heart of
East Village, the most thriving artistic communitie in New York
City. The building in which the office is located is an artist
owned cooperative, it includes 12 artist live/work coops, a 1200
square foot performance space, and Film editing facilities. The
performance space managed by Segue is used as a low cost dance
rehearsal space during the day and in the evenings we sponsor
various ongoing film, dance and music series.

 Segue Foundation, Roof Books

Roof Books, edited by James Sherry, is pleased to announce the
publication of two new titles; criss cross, by P. Inman (see
review of criss cross by Hank Lazer) and N/O by Ron Silliman.
Though different in their formal approach to the page and text,
both Inman and Silliman present a textual artifact which
challenges our assumptions of locution and language. Both present
texts which unknot normal attempts at consumption while aiding our
understanding of languages as both necessary and critical. Each of
these new titles can be ordered through Segue; receive a 20%
discount when you order from Segue and

mention this newsletter. (click here for Segue Address)  (For
other books by Inman, Silliman and many other writers, see the
list of Other Roof Books in this newsletter.)


Here's a glimpse of some press-time reviews:

_criss cross_, by P. Inman

64pp., paper, ISBN 0-937804-57-6, $7.95

P. Inman has a first name that is not a letter. It is a work. His
work also raises such questions for the reader. If a reader is
sure of what she is saying, she does not need P. Inman's work. If
she has doubts, reading P. Inman is a good idea.

Roof Books is publishing P. Inman against the grain of ordinary
poetics, but right in the face of digital reality. Before one
thinks of bytes, Inman's bits represent a primary block of
languages, all languages, foreign, domestic, binary, all have to
pass through Inman's thoroughfares.

_Criss cross_ is a tour of the process of navigating the realms of
experimentation, witness, and critique, an invitation to
participatory poetic locution. You, as reader, are given the gift
of transience.--Diane Ward

By fully semanticizing the so-called nonsemantic features of
language, Inman creates a dialectic of the recuperable & the
unreclaimable, where what cannot be claimed is nonetheless most
manifest resistant to habitual comprehension as the ambiguous
figure and similarly raises questions about the nature of
perception. Like Beckett, Inman challenges his reader/audience...
to consider what is fundamental, presence or absence.--Joan
Retallack

Inman's poetry lies in how this language becomes known in the
contemplative strategies it proposes and in what it becomes known
as. Inman's poetry an emblem of poetry, of how it sets on a page,
the page in a book, how a book opens, before one's eyes and in the
mind, and how the mind in relation to its knowns becomes
material.--Ben Friedlander

P. Inman was born on Long Island and educated at Georgetown. He is
a member of the AFSCME Local 2910s Executive Board. His work has
appeared in magazines and anthologies including: _In the American
Tree_ and _From the Other Side of the Century_. His books include:
_Ocker_, _Red Shift_, _Think of One_, and _Uneven Development_.

Review of _criss cross_, by Hank Lazer

words for windows. movement of phrases, words, syllables. bump up
against margins, boxes, forms, periods. rarely if ever "personally
expressive." as if transmitted. scrolling up & down. a sense of
recurrence & reshuffling. orders: taking orders, manifesting
orders. the criss-crossing and intersecting of shuffled and
deployed lines. rarely if ever traditionally descriptive. a
coolness. mondrian- like stripes of words. a beckett-like world of
seemingly disembodied articulation. rarely if ever to be confused
with speech. the page as a canvas or body upon which the lines
inch about. simple whole numbers of their re- combinings.
stubbornly resistant to readings which might resituate or
paraphrase or thematize Inman's writing. eleven different
assemblies. "prose arrived to fragments./ pulch. work stoppage
balled up// as content. moeb grammar." readings within the loop;
on the beltway. 1, 6, 6; 2, 6, 6; 3, 6, 6; 4, 6, 6: 5, 6, 6: 6, 6,
6. and other workings out, equations, formulas, floor plans, blue
prints. from narrow strips to paragraph-wide blocks. "otherwise is
that forever." a fill of/ sentences the ditch of what i mean.""
and ""every of doubt words into distance."" in this book we see
the units assemble and advance or disappear. that process is what
we see as much as anything. we see the words in their placement
moreso than in their service to other allegedly communicative
purposes. "such a thin of the book the beginning of an offspring
beside/ one line. how did distance become as dim as nosed. the
brook/ of edges in a dictionary." if a stanza is also a room,
Inman's book a floor plan, designs with designs upon us, lines
assigned to available spaces. "sensation than/ signification" --
odd intersections of words on the page. i highly recommend you see
& sense these. an engaging not uninviting terrain. "small wavelets
out to something." "how they think the distance left." and across
it, left & right, up & down, footprints. impressions. impressive.

--Hank Lazer



_N/O_, by Ron Silliman

112pp / paper / ISBN 0-937804-56-8 / $10.95

He lives the most passionate life of the mind in America. He is a
poet I read to break through into new halls and colonnades of
verbal richness that, before, I simply didn't know were sealed up
behind these walls and dead ends in the palace of art. His work
must be studied, lived with. Its pleasures cannot be simply lapped
up off its surfaces. But they are the subtler, sharper, and more
resonant for the time they take to taste.--Samuel R. Delany

Silliman has developed a shorthand method of getting it all down.
There is something incredibly moving about his cap city and
capability, his will and willfulness his hunger to know and absorb
as he rants, records, juxtaposes, declares, riffs, puns, pans...
--Tom Beckett

Ron Silliman was born in the state of Washington in 1946. He has
been a prison and tenant organizer, a lobbyist, a teacher, a
college administrator, editor of Socialist Review, and a marketeer
in the computer industry. Long a national leader of the Language-
centered writing movement, Ron Silliman's criticism has influenced
an entire generation of poets. His concept of the New Sentence
spawned literally dozens of efforts based on his idea of prose
writing. His commentaries on the writing of his peers act as the
most comprehensive introduction to this fascinating new writing
style and at the same time are the perfect example of that
writing. Each essay is filled with vital information and is itself
a formal innovation. _N/O_ is two letters of his ongoing poem, The
Alphabet.

Segue Distribution Archive

by Ricardo Tarrega-Shayegan

In November 1993, Segue received a general support grand of $3,500
from the Joyce Mertz-Gilmore foundation. The Foundation supports
organizations that "provide critical behind the scenes suppport to
the artistic community at low cost, or no charge." Segue has been
providing such services - a space for reading and rehearsals and
for research collections - for seventeen years. Thanks to this
grant we have been able to begin setting up an archive of the
materials that Segue has distributed. The project is being headed
by Heather Ramsdell who is identifying and locating the core of
the collection; writing to authors, publishers and editors, as
well as organizing materials already in Segue's possession. Right
now, Segue has approximately 30% of the materials it would like to
have in the core collection, which would include all the poetry
and prose books distributed by Segue throughout the years, its
collection of poetics titiles and the anthologies and magazines it
has distributed. Ideally the collection would be augmented by
audio and video tape collections as well as selections from
author's collections and correspondence. Once complete, the
collection will be housed at Segue or loaned in collaboration with
other poetry venues in New York. We look forward to continuing our
committment to the project and the Joyce Mertz-Gilmore Foundation's
generous grants helps make this possible.




M/E/A/N/I/N/G Magazine (see Susan's 11/27 post on M/E/A/N/I/N/G)

by Susan Bee

 M/E/A/N/I/N/G is a biannual, artist-run publication edited by two
painters, Susan Bee and Mira Schor. M/E/A/N/I/N/G is committed to
providing

an inclusive forum for the discussion of a broad range of issues
of concern to professional visual artists through the publication
of writing by artists, art historians and critics. Among the
writers we have published are Johanna Drucker, Amelia Jones,
Robert C. Morgan, Whitney Chadwick, Charles Bernstein and Rob
Storr. M/E/A/N/I/N/G provides a crucial alternative to the
commodification of art discourse in the established art magazines.
We are not concerned with career promotion, or the "best selling"
movements. By publishing writing by and for artists, we provide a
needed bridge between critical and theoretical ideas and language,
and the actual practice of visual art by working artists.
M/E/A/N/I/N/G regularly publishes forums on current issues,
encouraging responses from a wide range of visual artist. Past
forums have explored motherhood and artmaking, racism in the art
world, making art over a lifelong career, issues of community.
Some of the artist published in these forums are Leon Golub, David
Reed, David Humphrey, Nancy Spero, Miriam Schapiro, Ann Messner
and Richard Tuttle.  The Segue Foundation acts as our umbrella
organization and helps us with grant applications and acts as a
conduit for grant funding, but it does not add monetarily to our
budget. Segue also assists us in distribution, bulk mailing and
other postal services. M/E/A/N/I/N/G's relationship the Segue
Foundation has been extremely useful to us; as working artists
with active professional lives, The Segue Foundation has helped us
produce M/E/A/N/I/N/G with a minimum of bureaucracy or red tape.




Sally Silvers and Dancers

by Sally Silvers

My history as a Segue-connected artist goes back almost 14 years.
The foundation has been the non-profit conduit home for Sally
Silvers and Dancers since our first bulk mailing in 1981. (We're
both housed at the Segue sponsored artist live-work
coop/performance space in the Segue offices building on East 8th
St. in New York.) I also currently serve on the Segue Performance
Space board. In the early 80's Segue was the perfect locus for my
"non-obedient" stance to the existing dance world: low-riding
minimalism and pushing narrative/persona based theatrical dance
with a vengeance (initially as message oriented statement in an
early response to Reagonism, but also consensual transparency as a
commercially linked career op). I found aesthetic inspiration from
many of the writers associated with L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E Magazine and
Roof books. I wanted to politicize the body, show movement as a
social circuitry inherent in the way the body moved (utilizing
predicaments, presenting movement analytically, disjunctively,
maximally -- to have the "message," grounded in the social) . The
writers I admired most (some published by Roof/Segue) linked this
kind of formal and political radicalism. My early self-produced
evening-length concerts (some 15 from 1980-88) were all performed
under the auspices of the Segue Foundation and took place at
spaces like The Cunningham Studio and Ethnic Folk Arts Center. For
the last 6 years Segue has been my fiscal conduit for project
grants like a Meet the Composer collaboration with composer John
Zorn, performed at the Joyce Theater; a dance/theater presentation
with poet Bruce Andrews on gender, Nicaragua, control/discipline,
etc., and a 6 minute film collaboration with filmmaker Henry
Hills, "The Little Lieutenant." The film has toured
internationally, has won festival prizes and now has a European
distributor. 1995 will be a full year for SS&D.  Upcoming are 5
weeks of teaching in Holland; an improvisation festival in
December in NYC; an evening at Symphony Space in Feb., 1995. The
'95 New York City season with all new works starts in April at
P.S. 122. We also will be doing a film project with Henry Hills
which begins production in the spring.




INCISIONS/ARTS - Prison Arts Program

by Janine Vega

INCISIONS/ARTS has been organizing writing workshops and
performances at New York State Correctional Facilities for men and
women, and Division for Youth Residences and Secure Centers since
1978. Our writing programs have ranged from six week residencies,
to long-running residencies at Sing-Sing and Bedford Hills which
have continued for years. Resident writers usually come in to the
facility once a week, meeting with inmate writers who have been
selected or have chosen to take part. The workshop is conducted
through discussion of technique and of individual inmates work.
The aim of the workshop process is to generate new methods of
discovery and new ways of writing.  Recently we have been
emphasizing a final event or project: a poetry reading, shared
with the rest of the population, administration and staff; a short
play or screenplay from a drama workshop; or an anthology of
poetry, fiction or nonfiction. If an anthology is chosen as the
final project, one is presented to each participating writer. We
have found that aside from being a source of delight and pride,
the anthology is an immensely effective reminder of the capacity
for self-expression and as a continuing encouragement to keep
writing. Some of our anthologies have received critical acclaim in
American Book Review, Contact, Longhouse, Poetry Project
Newsletter, Poetry Flash and the Woodstock Times.  INCISIONS/ARTS
has received grants from the New York State Council on the arts,
Sing Sing Educational Department, Poets and Writers, The Vinmont
Foundation, Longtermers Committee at Bedford Hills. Witter Bynner
Foundation, Riverside Prison Foundation and private sponsors. We
have had successful residencies at Sing Sing C. F., Hopper House,
Creedmoor Psychiatric Center's Forensic Unit, Bellevue Prison
Ward, Green Haven C. F., Rikers Island for Women, Bayview C. F.
for Women, Bedford Hills C.F., Green Haven C. F., Highland R. C.
for Boys, Sojourner Truth R. C. for Girls, and Harlem Valley
Secure Center for Boys.  INCISIONS/ARTS has been written about in
the New York Times. Our Sing Sing workshop was covered by Bill
Moyers on PBS with poet Quincy Troupe; One of our writers read her
work for Channel 31 in New York City, and WBAI has broadcast
portions of our Sing Sing Christmas Poetry Reading.  The only
lasting changes in a person happen from the inside out. The
INCISIONS/ARTS writing program works by encouraging the
participants to clarify their opinions, to articulate and accept
their feelings and to examine and express themselves and their
world with depth and vision. For the inmate, the writing process
thus becomes a considerable and material process for change.

I'm trying to figure out how Benjamin would have gotten into
Switzerland from France on his way to the Pyrenees. Moreover,
allow me to assure you heartily, had he gotten into Switzerland
he would n e v e r  have left! Amazing the degree to which
it is possible to imagine that world as like ours, in which
one enters any country one wishes, etc. But it was not at all
like that in the late 30's. Again, it was the entry visa
which was critical, the right to enter another country was
very very hard to come by.

 IT'S HARD TO KNOW WHERE YOU ARE ON THE NET

Yes and no.  The net 's value  is different (greater?)  for those who
are the most widely separated. From one another, from the CENTERS       of discussion.
  News of conferences, books, etc., travels  further faster on the net.
 Space offers much less resistance it is true, but the net is still a map which
 retains its  scale, its distributions and projection regardless of the
 subject under discussion. And it's a familiar  one, to  those of us out here
 on its periphery.  In that respect I remain clear about where I am.

But the subjects do, of course, reinforce this geography.  A long while back
ANTHOLOGIES were discussed. They were all anthologies of AMERICAN
poetry as I recall.  More recently, we discussed NAMES. G-1, the NEW
AMERICANS--after those Abstract Expressionist shows O'Hara was
putting together and taking EUROPE by storm.  I'm not complaining and have
no desire to pose as the net's  postcolonial pet  or anything.  But this seemed
like a good moment to  make a point about the geography of the net, and how
the issues are always a bit (at least) different  according to where you are
writing from.  These differences will show up when the Auckland  is on
the line.

I have an outsider's interest in this  G-1, G-2  talk--not only because
G-formation itself  is a map-making process, and scale here makes it
much more difficult to engage in, but also because I am BETWEEN  your
Gs, along with Clark Coolidge, Susan Howe, Robert Grenier.  So,
as a for instance then, The Generation Game  could've done with more
ZOOM  all round.

Dear Tom:

I've been racking my brain trying to remember where I read that about
Bryher. It was when I was compiling the H.D. bibliography and a lot
got lost in the sheer volume of information passing through my hands.
I may have encountered it going through the H.D. archives at Yale.
Or it may be in the Guest H.D. bio, but, wouldn't you know, I lent my
copy to my sister-in-law when she was passing through town a couple of
weeks ago.

I do know that Bryher was involved in smuggling Jews out of Germany by
illegaly harboring them in Switzerland. I stress this was an illegal
operation and involved some risk on her part. Perhaps that's why B and
others couldn't stay in Switzerland, they had no papers. Anyway, my
memory, though hazy, I admit, is that she (though not H.D.--but she
must have known) was involved in such a pipeline/underground railroad
deal getting people into Spain and Portugal from where they could get
to England or the States.

H.D. left Switzerland for England fairly early. Bryher stayed for some
time, continuing her work and almost got trapped in Switzerland for
the duration of the war.

I know it sounds a bit like *Casablanca* or something. I was amazed
when I first read it.

Best,
Mike

Reading the e-mail after a few days grading papers.
1.Boughn: <Socrates says
<that it makes no difference whether "Gloucester" exists anywhere or
<will exist, that by reading "Maximus" we are already always
<participating in it, and that "Maximus" itself is thus a further
<proposal of our selves, unattained but attainable.

The question is then of the order of "taking Gloucester _literally_",
or....what?   ("Next year in Jerusalem" means exactly what?  is a
serious question, is it a place, is it a practice, is it a condition (of
hope)?

What does "literal" mean now?  Is it only an operative term in an
object-filled world, of positivities, when set against "metaphorical"?
When does a narrative NOT allow the possibility of allegorical
reading?

2.These questions resonate for me with Don Byrd's 25 November
post, looking for a coming together of what we have usually had as
fragments.

3. I have been reading Philostratus's Life of Apollonius of Tyana.
Book II, Chapter 22 is a theory of aethetics that got Neoplatonized in
the sixteenth century, but can be read like a kind of phenomenology.

Painting as an art is, in that theory, not art when it is just image in the
mind: it has to be something made "with the hands".  The knowledge
it embodies is the knowledge of how to make it  _in all respects _ ,
just as one would expect of the best conceived art of our time.
Also playing reed-pipes, according to Philostratus in the same
"Life of A of T" is knowing how to make moods (modes) to suit
occasions, dependent on knowing how to manage breath, fingers and
embouchure.   (It takes practice.)

  "Production", says Byrd.  That is the question, in practice.  (Olson
had something to say about that....)

John Clarke's From Feathers to Iron says a lot about this matter.  But
as with Olson's poetics what is foregrounded is Visionary poetry with
a capital V, and it always supposes a mystery that the poet
penetrates.

4.  Further questions:  This kind of poetics gives a whole lot of New
York poetries of the later 60's -- early 70's the brush-off.  (How does it
accomodate, say, O'Hara Lunch Poems, Berrigan, Notley,
Brainard....?)   There is a moment too when the ambitions of  Abstract
Expressionist art were confronted by Pop and "Minimalism" and so
on.  And poetry centred on the way that all semantic units are soluble
in language as a social practice (and therefore implicated in the
widescale power politics of  discourse) would seem also to be
excluded.  Not narrative, not lyric, not full of figures of persons, it
tends to political and philosophical discourse rather than
mysterioso-mythologico-anthropological narration -- epic....
         Robert Creeley may say "onward", but in Maximus "Robert
Creeley" is the "Figure of .... (figure as in a grand scale allegorical
narrative, however much constructed from materials as they come to
hand in a grab-bag fashion) ... 0utward" .  Isn't that right?   (Does this
mean NOT the "inward" of the personal interior stream of
consciousness?  Someone put me right: this is how I've been taking
it.)

It looks like a history of a series of gates closing and others opening.
   But that's a progressivist modernist kind of history, in which one
generation makes the previous one seem worthless.
Does Olson's poem fail a reading test: does it sound foolish now?  as
if he should have revised it in the light of what follows.
Should Jackson Pollock have scrapped everything, if he'd
lived into the 1960's and started again?

YES, I'M HERE, A BIT SLOW AND BETWEEN TERM-PAPERS,
BUT HERE.
Where is that quote from?) DAMN IF I KNOW (SHAME, SHAME)
BUT THIS IS WHAT SHE SAID (I'LL LEAVE UPPER CASE NOW
AS IT'S EASIER TO READ):

     "Artists do not experiment. Experiment is what
     scientists do; they initiate an operation of unknown
     factors in order to be instructed by its results. An
     artist puts down what he knows and at every moment it
     what he knows at that moment."

But I don't have a note of whence I got it! It's in some notes
I wrote on "Emp Lace" (in _Bee_Time_Vine_) but I have no idea why
or where it comes from. Does anybody out there recognize
it?

I'm not sure I'd take Stein's word for it anyway, so far as
"experiment" goes. In any case it's quite clear that in the
terms of the definition just quoted, she experimented.  In 1928
she called _Tender_Buttons_ "my first conscious struggle with
the problem of correlating sight, sound and sense, and
eliminating rhythm; now I am [in pieces collected in
_How_to_write_] trying grammar and eliminating sound."
That quote is from _Transition_ #14. Of course she
experiemnted in the sense of trying something out to
see what happened. Not, perhaps, in the sense of trying
to disprove a hypothesis. If you want an example of
a deliberate and conscious experiment, try "An Instant
Answer or A Hundred Prominent Men" (Transition
# 13  Summer 1928: 118-130) in which she
deliberately sets out, describing a hundred photographs
one after another in numbered sequence, to see if at
any point she (or presumably any reader) could thereby
get a *sense* of one hundred. After all, earlier (?) she had
said "there is only one way to count: one and one and one and
[you guessed it] one." But I guess she said that later.

Now BACK TO THOSE TERM-PAPERS.

It may be worth noting that Benjamin's lost ms, the Passage Work, represents an
attempt to construct philosophy with wholely concrete elements -- the documented
remnants of an outdated commercial culture -- the Paris Arcades.  The Arcades were
a proto-Net -- connected areas of public access & commerce.  Benjamin argues
that the Arcades represent the dreamy, unconscious longings of industrial
capitalism in concrete form, and that they suggest, in the moment of our
latter-day estrangement and fascination, the possibility of awakening.  The Net
is currently being promoted both in terms of revolution (democratic horizontality)
and commerce (electronic malls).  I wonder what'll happen.

Defending dead men is a bad business. You can't help but engage in half-
sincere apologetics about issues you have no knowledge. For examples of which
see my last posting. But/but...
     The main point of contention between the two thinkers, the bastard and
Baldur/Adonis, ie, the lost son, the lost possibility, is in fact the
possibility. Do you in fact think there is the possibility of truly
oppositional thinking/art/popular culture. Benjamin was able to theorize
such a thing in film in The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction
or something. Adorno was never able to see it. Always felt a profound
pessimism about the possibility that experiment could work against the
dominant culture.
     I don't know. What do you think.
     This is what I think: there isn't a day that goes by, not a single one,
that when I sit at my computer to write a poem I don' t imagine I can write
something that will, in some profound way, make things better for people.
     Yet...
On PBS, I watched a Shaker auction in Vermont or some such place, and
Oprah fucking Winfrey bought a Shaker box, a box painted blue, for 10,000
dollars.
     In the early 80s, as an undergraduate (okay, yeah so I'm G2 or whatever),
I watched as punk became a fashion statement for professors.
     I don't know what experiment is. I don't know what opposition is. Because
everything I've ever believed in is now a commercial for someone.
     And if there is anything that all, I mean all, previous generations
have to deal with now, it is that you, too, will become a commercial.
And this is the fundemental question facing all art forms and where Adorno's
pessimism, which seemed so Mandarin in the 60s or so, now is appropriate.
A question vital to everyone who pretends they write: How do I not become
a commercial?
