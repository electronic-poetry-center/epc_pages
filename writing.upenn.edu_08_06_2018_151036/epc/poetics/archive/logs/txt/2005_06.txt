Dear friends,

Having heard nothing, I'll post this again ---

I am looking for a theoretical text that deals with the difference between
"humor" (Nash) and the "comic" (Stevens) in the 20th century.  I am writing
an essay about comedy theory that includes Bergson, Wyndham Lewis, and
Breton, and I would like to begin by defining comedy as opposed to humor.

vital participant in List Mind, so who am I to judge?)

     On June 11, 1965, the first "Poetry Incarnation" @ London's  Royal Albert Hall ("now they know how many holes it takes to fill the Albert Hall...") saw Allen Ginsberg & Gregory Corso tear Swinging London apart.
    To mark the 40th anniversary of this event, the Philly Free School is putting on a reading July 5 @ the Khyber-- "Poetry Incarnation '05". We need YOU!!! We want POETS!!! All kinds!! Everyone!!!
    So this is an open invite to read. We have 5-6 hours to fill, need 40-50 poets, each to get roughly 10 minutes. You can respond to this e-mail, or reach Adam Fieled @ afieled@hotmail.com or (610) 608-2094 (yes, I do answer my cell). Should be a pretty good time.
    Come out & read!!!!

actually aaron,
being in canada, i'm more comfortable commenting on humour but I think
that you might want to look at the greeks for this one. they were
theorizing about this sort of stuff long before nash won the NBA MVP,
which may be comic if one was humourless.

I'd also look at Bakhtin. he calls laughter the surplus of of humanity.
the eytymology of the words might help too.
comic has a root in komikos- to revel (not to be confused with Komninos
the fine Aussie poet) and humor (or humour in my mouth) relatign to
health.

what might make nash more comic is the double subversion of first poetry
in the newspaper, then, silly poetry in the newspaper. (don't ask me
to explain silly as I'd only string you along) might this
publicity contribute to the comic? maybe speech act theory would be a
place to have a look.


just some thoughts.

cheers,
kevin

Not about the difference exactly, but Bergson's "Laughter: An Essay on the
Meaning of the Comic" might prove useful.

Hi Steve.  I'm glad someone reads my messages.  I've just been kidding around on this issue or statement from Furniture Press.  I suspect the ego has as much or as little to do with it as it usually does with my poetry, assuming that the ego can be said to exist which, to a Buddhist, is questionable.  I don't know what you see as egotistical in what I've said about poetry eating/poetry eating itself alive but that's okay.  Like I say, I'm glad someone but me is reading these things.

I have one more book to add to the summer reading list so I'm doing this this way.The book is Life is Elsewhere by Milan Kundera, a book which came out in translation five years ago but which I didn'e encounter until last week.  It's a wonderful novel whose main character is a poet named Jamil, a fictional entity as far as I know

Dear Friends,

Just Buffalo is moving downtown! As of July 1, we will be sharing office
space with CEPA Gallery and Big Orbit at the Market Arcade on Main St.
Although we're packing up the books, this is no ordinary move. Together with
CEPA and Big Orbit/Soundlab, we are launching the cultural community's first
true administrative partnership, a project two years in the making and a
central strategy for remaining strong in the face of severely diminished
government support following the Erie County budget fiasco.

The three organizations will share office space, a grant-writer, marketing,
purchasing, and training while keeping our strong individual identities.
Just Buffalo's programming will continue without pause.  Our workshops and
writer critique group will take place in CEPA's Flux Gallery. Our "In the
Hibiscus Room" series will now be called the "Orbital" series and will take
place at Big Orbit Gallery, located at 30d Essex, St. in Buffalo. Our Open
Readings will continue; however, the 2nd Wednesday reading each month that
had been taking place in the Hibiscus Room will, as of July 1, take place at
the Carnegie Art Center, 240 Goundry St. in North Tonawanda.

New information, as well as directions to new locations, will be posted in
this newsletter and on the website by the end of June. As of July 1, our new
mailing address will be:

Just Buffalo Literary Center
Market Arcade
617 Main Street, Suite 202A
Buffalo, 14203.
Tel. 716.832.5400
Fax. 716 270.0184

This is the beginning of a new era for Just Buffalo. You can be proud, as a
member, to support an organization that has consistently been a leader and
innovator in the cultural community.

We look forward to seeing you this summer and in seasons to come.  Thanks
for the continued support.

Sincerely,

Laurie Dean Torrell, Executive Director
Michael Kelleher, Artistic Director
Cass Clarke, Director of Education

Subject:      from the anals (oops, annals) of prairie-land
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii" ; format="flowed"

Minnesota has a state muffin (blueberry), a state photograph ("Grace") and a
state mushroom (morel), but it decidedly won't have a state poet laureate.

Gov. Tim Pawlenty rejected a bill overwhelmingly passed by the Legislature
that would have allowed him to appoint a poet laureate after receiving
recommendations from the nonprofit Minnesota Humanities Commission.

The laureate would have been called on to provide verse for "appropriate
ceremonies and celebrations" of the state, such as the 2008
sesquicentennial. No state money would have gone with the job.

In a veto message signed Friday and announced Tuesday, however, Pawlenty
said he saw no need for such a position.

"We can benefit from the richness and diversity of all of the poets in
Minnesota and recognize and embrace their work as merit and circumstances
warrant," he said.

He also suggested that the measure could lead to "requests for a state mime,
interpretive dancer or potter."

According to the Library of Congress, about 34 states have established poet
laureate positions, although some are vacant.

Rep. Tim Mahoney, DFL-St. Paul, a pipefitter who was a House cosponsor of
the vetoed legislation, noted that England has yet to produce a potter
laureate. "I found the governor's logic rather contrived," he said Tuesday.

Others offered sharper criticism.

"Mr. Pawlenty seems to think that if you keep from raising taxes, the
imagination will cease to be rambunctious," said Bill Holm, a poet and
essayist from Minneota, Minn. "He's terrified of the imagination rearing up
and giving a good, swift kick to his dead ideas."

Holm, along with Robert Bly or even radio star Garrison Keillor, could have
been candidates to be Minnesota's first poet laureate. Holm's own
suggestions included Phebe Hanson, Mark Vinz and John Rezmerski.

Holm said a poet laureate is important "to publicly acknowledge that poetry
is a part of the culture -- that something besides the practical lives and
exists. Einstein thought that what he played on the violin was greater than
all of his physics."

"I was totally surprised" by the veto, said Rep. Barb Sykora, R-Excelsior,
chief House sponsor and chairwoman of the Education Finance Committee. "I
saw it as putting a little more emphasis on one type of literature that you
don't hear much about."

Pawlenty's veto cannot be overridden because the Legislature ended its
regular session, during which the bill was passed, last week. Even though
the votes in favor were 126 to 6 in the House and 52 to 8 in the Senate, its
sponsors voiced little enthusiasm for reviving the issue.

All the legislative opposition came from Republicans, which led to a piece
of not quite laureate quality verse that was read on the House floor. Penned
by Rep. John Lesch, DFL-St. Paul, it named each of the no voters --
including Rep. Phil Krinkie, R-Lino Lakes, who was rhymed with "stinky" --
and concluded:

But thanks all you others, it'll please all your mothers/ To know you like
rhymes and you show it

Those others who frowned will soon come around/ To love our state Laureate
Poet.

Now as to the "comedy and humor" thread.

Thanks, everyone!  Very helpful.  A few responses:

Ben - yes, "Laughter"  is the primary Bergson text  I'm working with.

Kevin - especially helpful;  I do have _Rabalais and His World_ in hand and
will begin perusing it today; does he talk about the etymology of the words,
or is that an observation of someone else, or is that your own observation?
Also:   What is "speech act theory", and who are its primary theorists?

Robin - I trust you jest when you suggest D.B. Wyndham Lewis makes more
sense than the "Apes of God man"!   Two of the latter's essays in _The Wild
Body_ are devoted to humor theory.

Halvard - I tried to send this as an announcement. Thanks for the
suggestion.

You might check out Simon Critchley's book _On Humor_.
There is an interview w/ the author here:
http://www.culturewars.org.uk/2002-12/simoncritchley.htm
and there was an article in Cabinet either this issue or
one back, I can't recall.

lq

Here's a little less than half of the interview for a taste:

SD: You end On Humour with a definition of the risus purus, the
highest laugh. I will read that definition back to you:

For me, it is this smile - deriding the having and the not having, the
pleasure and the pain, the sublimity and suffering of the human
situation - that is the essence of humour. This is the risus purus,
the highest laugh, the laugh that laughs at the laugh, that laughs at
that which is unhappy, the mirthless laugh of the epigraph to this
book. Yet, this smile does not bring unhappiness, but rather elevation
and liberation, the lucidity of consolation. This is why, melancholy
animals that we are, human beings are also the most cheerful. We smile
and find ourselves ridiculous. Our wretchedness is our greatness.

Although I sympathise with your celebration of humanity's ability to
overcome the worst, through laughter, this wormhole of escapism, I am
deeply suspicious of any theory that concludes 'our wretchedness is
our greatness'. Can you really defend this statement?

SC: It's a quotation from Pascal. I've always been very keen on
Pascal, and what I'm most keen on in Pascal is his emphasis upon human
wretchedness. He has a phrase which goes something like 'Anxiety,
boredom and inconstancy, that is the human condition' and I've always
been very partial to that. But obviously for Pascal the flip side of
that is religious experience, that experience of God that would
transform or redeem your wretchedness. I've long wanted to have an
occasion to include it in something I wrote and that's why it's there.

I do mean it, it's very important to me in so far as I think, and this
is one of the arguments of the book, that there is a black sun at the
heart of the coloured universe, there is something melancholic at the
heart of humour and in the last chapter I try and trace that out using
Freud. I try and show how the structure of melancholia and the
structure of humour are the same structure. Melancholia for Freud is
the relationship that the subject takes up with respect to itself from
the position of what he calls conscience or what he later calls the
super-ego. And that can be lacerated - if you think of the anorexic
who sees themselves from the perspective of the image they have, of
the image they have of themselves in the mirror which is false - that
would be the super-ego. Super-ego is what generates depression and it
is what has to be dealt with in psychoanalysis.

The thing about humour is that the super-ego is also at play, so what
interested me, particularly in the last chapter which is key to the
book -and no one seems to have picked this up in writings on Freud -
is that, in the later Freud, the essence of humour is the ability to
look at myself and find myself ridiculous. That makes me laugh. So the
pathology of humour is the same pathology as that of melancholia or
depression The difference with humour is that humour can alleviate
that, can transform that experience of wretchedness into something
elevating, and liberating, in Freud's words. I don't want people to
dwell in their wretchedness, I want people to find themselves
ridiculous, and in so far as they can find themselves ridiculous they
can rise above that wretchedness.

SD: What you are saying then, is that the final quotation, your thesis
on humour, is not so much descriptive as prescriptive?

SC: Both. It's a very difficult line to tread. I begin the book by
trying to describe the phenomena of humour and the phenomena of
laughter. And then I say I am going to make normative claims. It is
normal to say about humour that it is good to laugh at yourself and
not good to laugh at others - that is the ethical headline of the
book. It is descriptive therefore, in that I am feeding of what
happens in humour and trying to offer a certain idea of how humour
ought to be, what the best sorts of humour are capable of.

SD: Freud and Pascal are not the only figures in the last chapter.
Samuel Beckett features a lot. Why so many helpers? Is it because
humour is like that, it's a communal thing?

SC: Absolutely - everybody's an expert and everybody's got a gag. I
was giving a talk in Bath at a conference on animals - there was no
reason why I should have been there - but I was giving a plenary on
humour and animals. Afterwards I got twenty-five references that I
might follow on the basis of that talk - and they were good things.
Why the book is so eclectic is that I was being taken off in different
directions by people responding to it, but they're responding to it
because they feel they have something to say, that they know about
humour, they know what it means.

Obviously the discussion is or is not being well taken care of or badly tre=
ated as if a chil and/or adult sitting/standing at the margin/center of the=
 fray/giftgiving.

tom is right and wrong to say what he says and does not say, when he is say=
ing it or not saying it. he makes sense to us and doesn't make sense so tha=
t we're always and never sure or unsure of what exactly precisely indefinat=
ely saying or not saying.

tom, what steve is saying is this.

tom, steve, this is a good beginning and/or ending end/or anding. or else a=
m i making sense by not?=20

poetry we'll have to take seriously and poetry we'll have to take even more=
 seriously, the latter being one of respect and the former of brilliance th=
at we can't escape its brilliance. deem it brilliant i may you could say it=
 can't and we come to something closer by farther away.=20

poetry was eating itself (masticating, as jean hartig says, my best friend =
and enemy to poetry) and i told her not to assimilate the idea by assimilat=
ing it to either poetry or poetry, because there's always three sides of th=
e coin: poetry is in the middle of masticating itself. i feel that it will =
soon be possible that poetry will be matriculating itself after the eating =
is done.=20

i wanted to say 'the eat' but a number of institutions that are not on my s=
ide provide no vacancy for such ideas. poetry wanted to say something too, =
but i repressed it, along with (tom and steve)'s outcry for dominance on a =
poetics list made up of human and non-human subjects.

case in point: i have met several people on the list, in public. to name a =
few i won't. it has occured to me that since charles and co. established th=
e list, using names of prominant and not so prominant and, people like me, =
not wanting prominance, have built a long dialogue (in this case narrative =
since charles and co. at buffPOdept. have been singlehandedly creating all =
posts to the list, except mine (which is a flaw in my theory)and by which p=
eople who THINK they're on this list believe that they themselves are posti=
ng. for example:

steve dalachinsky: "man o man   chris   what's going on with   lautreamont?"

steve d has no idea he's writing this because no one is writing this. the e=
xistence of a malpractice suit in the hands of a wordsmith resinates with s=
uspect handwriting claws. it states that charles and co. are making it up a=
s they go, yet again revolutionizing POlitics, POlitics just to get it righ=
t, by making it their history.

thus poetry has integrated itself into the surroundings of this list, my le=
tter to steve and tom and co. if they exist. it has matriculated into a cur=
riculum of deafening proportion. the world teaches science courses and snow=
 eludes the weathermen, alluding, i'll say, to what kerouac said, in an unp=
ublished letter to harry smith in 1957, "harry, butter? get it, man? like, =
wow!"

at the end or the beginning of the discussion or silence let me make a poin=
t to speak or not to speak on the issue.=20

christophe "pastamassima" casamassima

p.s. to whomever it may concern : i've no use for a serious poetry. it's al=
l very humorous. like a bone.

Now that folk are restricted to one post per day, they're very
discriminating about what they say... and sometimes choose silence.

The real reason for this particular silence, however, may be that you've set
yourself what Bergson would call a false problem. If you could set out a
principled articulation of the distinction you seek to make?

You've not cited Koestler's _The Act of Creation_ which starts with some
stuff about comedy. Also, you might find Bertrand Russell's criticism of
Bergson on laughter briefly illuminating (that's in the collected papers,
Logical and Philosophical Papers 1909-13. London: Routledge 1992).

Victor Raskin at Purdue University (he's still there, I think) might be a =

Dear Aaron,

I just read Kenneth Rexroth's "Classics Revisited," and he approaches
the distinction between humor and the comic on several occasions,
notably when discussing the work of Henry Fielding and Laurence
Sterne.  It's not "theoretical" (whatever that is, really), but as a
work of comparative literary criticism, it's endlessly thought-
provoking, as indeed all of Rexroth's critical work is.

Best,

Chris

Hey Maria,

Maybe you can lobby to have the Minnesota moto changed to State of Grace?

What poet could resist the chance to to write, say, "Sesquicentenial
Sestina," and for the usual pay?

Is there a laureate's union?

Why not, Maria or whoever, we get the gov's email address and bombard him
with poems. Like 'Dear Gov, you can kill the messenger but not the.." and
"here's a poem".
I suspect the gov is conflating New Jersey with Minnesota and terrified that
the State's version of Amiri Baraka is going jump out of the State
wood-chipper and start telling the truth about Senator Mark Coleman qua Bush
patsy a la Galloway and then come up with some songs about why some in high
places would have seen it as efficient to eliminate Paul Wellstone, etc.

I understand the Gov's concerns. Here in the quasi-dormant Union.

By the way, I hope a few of us yesterday saw the the C-Span Kent State
National Guard killings of 35 years ago remembered. Moving stuff, I thought.
Maybe C-Span will play it again.

Subject:      580 Split Call for Submissions
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

580 Split has issued a call for submissions of poetry, prose, and art to
its eighth issue. The 580 Split reading period will begin July 1 and
extend through November 1. Please check out our website for submission
information: http://www.580split.com.

In addition, our seventh issue has just been released, with work by
Douglas Basford, Scott Bentley, Laynie Browne, David Harrison Horton,
Lucy Jilka, Jesse Nissim, Stephen Ratcliffe, Erik Sandberg, Padcha
Tuntha-Obas, Tom Whalen, and others.

Not far from our office at Mills College in Oakland, California, the 580
Split is a risky jumble of ramps, overpasses, and interchanges, where
highways cross, merge, intersect, and branch out in every direction.
580 Split, an annual journal of arts and literature, is both the

Hi, I for one have no interest in dominating discussion on this list about anything, especially this particular issue.  Since I found myself, thanks to Steve, compared to the Buddha, I've been trying to respond appropriately to that.  I am not the Buddha.  I haven't even achieved the first stage of enlightenment called sotapanna in Pali or "stream entry."  This, perhaps the equivalent of satori in Mahayana erases all doubts in the path.  Since doubts arise in me all the time, I figure I still have a ways, perhaps a long ways to go.  Nevertheless, I have been a practicing and studying Buddhist for many years thus Buddhist ideas like egolessness turn up in my poems frequently.  Nevertheless, Steve, don't mistake the finger pointing at the moon for the moon itself.  I am merely that finger.  As to you at Furniture Press, it can be said that I or you, any of us can both be said to exist and not to exist.  To accept only one part of the paradox is to err.  As for egotism, which I
see
 everywhere, as much in artistic communities as outside it in the so-called real world, that seems to exist whether or not the ego's statements we hear in our heads are illusions or not.  Whether I am guilty of egotism with regard to discussion, all I can say on this possible question is I hope not.  Also, to keep this message reasonably brief, I will end my part of it here, for the moment.  Should any of you care to respond to this further discussion, I look forward to reading whatever you say and may respond at a future time.

tom is right and wrong to say what he says and does not say, when he is saying it or not saying it. he makes sense to us and doesn't make sense so that we're always and never sure or unsure of what exactly precisely indefinately saying or not saying.

tom, what steve is saying is this.

tom, steve, this is a good beginning and/or ending end/or anding. or else am i making sense by not?

poetry we'll have to take seriously and poetry we'll have to take even more seriously, the latter being one of respect and the former of brilliance that we can't escape its brilliance. deem it brilliant i may you could say it can't and we come to something closer by farther away.

poetry was eating itself (masticating, as jean hartig says, my best friend and enemy to poetry) and i told her not to assimilate the idea by assimilating it to either poetry or poetry, because there's always three sides of the coin: poetry is in the middle of masticating itself. i feel that it will soon be possible that poetry will be matriculating itself after the eating is done.

i wanted to say 'the eat' but a number of institutions that are not on my side provide no vacancy for such ideas. poetry wanted to say something too, but i repressed it, along with (tom and steve)'s outcry for dominance on a poetics list made up of human and non-human subjects.

case in point: i have met several people on the list, in public. to name a few i won't. it has occured to me that since charles and co. established the list, using names of prominant and not so prominant and, people like me, not wanting prominance, have built a long dialogue (in this case narrative since charles and co. at buffPOdept. have been singlehandedly creating all posts to the list, except mine (which is a flaw in my theory)and by which people who THINK they're on this list believe that they themselves are posting. for example:

steve dalachinsky: "man o man chris what's going on with lautreamont?"

steve d has no idea he's writing this because no one is writing this. the existence of a malpractice suit in the hands of a wordsmith resinates with suspect handwriting claws. it states that charles and co. are making it up as they go, yet again revolutionizing POlitics, POlitics just to get it right, by making it their history.

thus poetry has integrated itself into the surroundings of this list, my letter to steve and tom and co. if they exist. it has matriculated into a curriculum of deafening proportion. the world teaches science courses and snow eludes the weathermen, alluding, i'll say, to what kerouac said, in an unpublished letter to harry smith in 1957, "harry, butter? get it, man? like, wow!"

at the end or the beginning of the discussion or silence let me make a point to speak or not to speak on the issue.

christophe "pastamassima" casamassima

p.s. to whomever it may concern : i've no use for a serious poetry. it's all very humorous. like a bone.

Big up A.Badiou for these "15 Theses on Contemporary Art" (found @ =
www.lacan.com)
=20
1. Art is not the sublime descent of the infinite into the finite =
abjection of the body and sexuality. It is the production of an infinite =
subjective series through the finite means of a material subtraction.

2. Art cannot merely be the expression of a particularity (be it ethnic or =
personal). Art is the impersonal production of a truth that is addressed =
to everyone.

3. Art is the process of a truth, and this truth is always the truth of =
the sensible or sensual, the sensible as sensible. This means: the =
transformation of the sensible into a happening of the Idea.

4. There is necessarily a plurality of arts, and however we may imagine =
the ways in which the arts might intersect there is no imaginable way of =
totalizing this plurality.

5. Every art develops from an impure form, and the progressive purification=
 of this impurity shapes the history both of a particular artistic truth =
and of its exhaustion.

6. The subject of an artistic truth is the set of the works which compose =
it.

7. This composition is an infinite configuration, which, in our own =
contemporary artistic context, is a generic totality.

8. The real of art is ideal impurity conceived through the immanent =
process of its purification. In other words, the raw material of art is =
determined by the contingent inception of a form. Art is the secondary =
formalization of the advent of a hitherto formless form.

9. The only maxim of contemporary art is not to be imperial. This also =
means: it does not have to be democratic, if democracy implies conformity =
with the imperial idea of political liberty.

10. Non-imperial art is necessarily abstract art, in this sense: it =
abstracts itself from all particularity, and formalizes this gesture of =
abstraction.

11. The abstraction of non-imperial art is not concerned with any =
particular public or audience. Non-imperial art is related to a kind of =
aristocratic-proletarian ethic: Alone, it does what it says, without =
distinguishing between kinds of people.

12. Non-imperial art must be as rigorous as a mathematical demonstration, =
as surprising as an ambush in the night, and as elevated as a star.

13. Today art can only be made from the starting point of that which, as =
far as Empire is concerned, doesn't exist. Through its abstraction, art =
renders this inexistence visible. This is what governs the formal =
principle of every art : the effort to render visible to everyone that =
which for Empire (and so by extension for everyone, though from a =
different point of view), doesn't exist.

14. Since it is sure of its ability to control the entire domain of the =
visible and the audible via the laws governing commercial circulation and =
democratic communication, Empire no longer censures anything. All art, and =
all thought, is ruined when we accept this permission to consume, to =
communicate and to enjoy. We should become the pitiless censors of =
ourselves.

15. It is better to do nothing than to contribute to the invention of =
formal ways of rendering visible that which Empire already recognizes as =
existent.=20

=20
Also love to G.Agamben for presenting the possibility of a mankind which =
may exist fundamentally as 'the lazy rascal' in "The Open: Man and Animal" =
(Stanford U. Press).=20

Check it!

your pal,

i think i may have erred in hypothesizing the all-writ nature of charles an=
d co. perhaps a new hypothesis can be stated in the context of this discuss=
ion:

if buddha is the presence writing all posts, and we actually have the exper=
ience and memory of this action, that is if we're actually doing the writin=
g, then we are all buddhas.

it's also very funny to use the words "that is" because it's universal. jus=
t think how many writers use the term "that is". it's like gertrude stein a=
ttack, like hamburger.=20

it's actually pretty funny to think this post will be an hour long, a spont=
aneous outbreak of ideas according to tom's behaviors in cyberspace. steve =
i hope you'll get involved in this too, if you have time. i'll give some ex=
amples of a day's thinking.

many friends i talk to and many who i've never talked to, whom i'm assuming=
 might be in the same position as we/us, i mean all of us, we're so conscio=
us of history. we know even libraries know that they're eventually going to=
 approach a writer and ask for his/her papers, buying them and building a c=
atalogue of their life's work so that future generations may have a context=
. in like fashion my friends and colleagues are already preparing their pap=
ers, young artists they are, by filing them and saving every piece of mail =
that comes to them. how has e-mail changed that? well, no more typesetting =
that's for sure! it's all cut and paste and layout now. so easy. so if we'r=
e going to talk about poetry eating itself we should also turn to our frien=
ds and colleagues, first, and then to ourselves in the context of this orga=
nization of lifework, and do something along the lines of getting the mater=
ial out of the way and returning to a state of orality (just joking, maybe,=
 we'll see). imagine if we meet our elders in order to gather information a=
bout their peers and friends and colleagues? but take it a step further, an=
d look at the possible irony of the situation. lies come easily.=20

i'm embarking upon a project of disinformation. my friend jean, who i menti=
oned in my last post and may be privy to all this soon, if i let her in on =
it, told me one night that she feels like, i can't remember the word she us=
ed but it was close to fraud, something along those lines, because she, now=
 i can't remember why she thought so, but i think it had to do with her inv=
olvement in the writing and and doing of poetry and of it being involved wi=
th other writers. i think her main point was that she was being lauded by h=
er peers but she didn't think she was doing anything purposeful, meaningful=
, in the long run, and she couldn't understand why there was so much optimi=
sm in something so elusive.

thusly we arrived at a point of eating. with all the illusions in the world=
 that if something is added or taken away like must happen to what it is be=
ing added to or taken away from. eating is an illusion, poetry eating itsel=
f alive is a total paradox of faith: we do poetry and nothing happens. we f=
eed it and it gets smaller. we ignore it it gets bigger. the eating metapho=
r is wearing me down because it is a special kind of problem that we've jus=
t skimmed the surface of, and now with the introduction of buddhist pratice=
 and thought and this eating behavior i want to start to make connections. =
and thusly jean is right, we are frauds, if we are going to think like this=
, about making the connections here on/in this space and come to a conclusi=
on that we all can understand, by equating, with words, a buddhism and eati=
ng. like tom said about the moon and the act of pointing to the moon, writi=
ng these equations is poiting to the moon, but the text itself is the moon,=
 or is it the reading and responding to it the moon? or is the moon the moo=
n?=20

what we're basically imparting to our peers and friends is disinformation, =
and they know it. that is, they know nothing. who knows something? we can d=
efine and move further away from definition. just to introduce derrida for =
a moment and then let him sleep comfortably, we define words with words, wh=
ich need to be defined by more words, so it is futile, an endless defining,=
 communication can become an endlessnessism. and the words pour forth from =
my legs.

respond, welsh, automobile, docile, italy.
verb, adjective, noun, adjective, noun.

jean is right about our writing poetry, and my project of disinformation fe=
eds on that teet. why is it so hard for me to read poetry that keeps pointi=
ng? i can't even fathom an instant where i'm writing lyric as narrative, us=
ing all this symbology to enhance my understanding:

the days are long and arduous, now that
the ladder has been lifted to the barn's
second window. mom always asks, "how does
it lean so?" the wind is virile with pink
sleep.

none of it happened. i can't write right. and the writing of this letter no=
w is total shit because it is a thought pattern. i can manifesto all i want=
, but then it sounds like a dance.

the fraud of it lies in the breaking down of the text, like one of this siz=
e, and preparing it for nothing. today is not a day of associations, and i'=
ve exhausted my thoughts. now i'm playing with the idea that out of all thi=
s will come something, and it's been 35 minutes.

where am i going with this? ah, i've been trying now for 35 minutes to make=
 the associations, consciously, of what eating and the moon and pointing to=
 it have in common. everything. it has nothing in common with everything. d=
epends on who's looking.=20

it is a custom to be at least legible when we talk to people. i'll let ego =
in the way now. my life is surrounded by people who constantly ask me to ei=
ther make sense or to fit in with social con vention so that it is possible=
 for people to take me seriously. i'm not so much worried about being misun=
derstood than me compromizing my nature and that is to be spontaneous (but =
with a little forethought - i am a bit of a child at heart).

what i really wanted to do was to list events of action and non-action so t=
hat i may not say anytyhing, so that you can read and respond as was like i=
n the last few days. and i needed then to bring in this idea that buddhism =
is not really foreign to me but i can do some more learning, and that catho=
licism is what i was brought into. this world. perhaps my big break from th=
e iconoclastic nature of catholicism, the law, the dogma, the ritual, is my=
 bringing upon myself a paranoia of sense. that's it! that's the breakthrou=
gh! i have a grand paranoia of making sense to someone.

I AM UNWILLING TO MAKE SENSE BECAUSE I AM RESPONDING TO MY CATHOLIC INHERIT=
ANCE.

i'm not even very familiar, i mean i do remember most of the service during=
 mass, and i do remember some of the laws but i'm now wholly sure what the =
jist of a catholicism is. i'm even afraid, no, not afraid, but unwilling to=
 come to terms with it by bringing it out in the open with my peers, becaus=
e when we start to talk about catholicism, everyone goes bonkers. this kid =
at the park, a teenager, said two daysd ago something like, well, i can't r=
emember exactly what he said but it was either he's against the idea of god=
, like he's an atheist, or that people, oh now i remember, he said "people =
who believe in god/go to church are narrow mined. believe me, i should know=
". well, i believe in god (not an avid churchgoer though i should be, i wan=
t to, hell, i'm admitting it to my peers!) but i'm not close minded, judgem=
ental, yes, stubborn, of course, but not close minded! but these are some o=
f the things i hear people say about refusing to believe in a god because o=
f the institution's pratices.=20

here is my idea:

i have friends who left their church because of reasons of "brainwashing/mi=
litarism/sexism/cover ups" but are avid believers in god and have found new=
, less restrictive churches. this church actually said that if they leave t=
heir church they're leaving god. oppression under god's name? hmm, and let =
us take it out of bounds for a second: using an object in a word's name? th=
e whole pointing thing is equal to this. we use god's name to defend an ins=
titution's practice and laws; we use words to defend an object's being. all=
 point for a reason. the reason is arbitrary. now i do believe that if an i=
nstitution is using a name to defend itself, the name eventually goes bad a=
nd we can't trust either the intitution nor the name. we're at a dead end. =
i don't want to ascribe any solutions but this is something to think about.=
=20

so why my distrust in poetry? this whole idea of eating? it has to do with =
this unsaid symbology. all poetry in the traditional sense of finding meani=
ng so that we may understand the nature of things. i know this is all retro=
active, it's all been said before. i don't know where i'm going to go with =
this idea, it does inform my writing.=20

i'm tired now. THERE MUST BE SOMETHING IN THIS THAT IS FAIR.

CHRIS

The  Philadelphia Gay News and every other gay news platform is making it
clear that  they are behind the newest push for gay American soldiers to be OUT
to  serve.  This is just amazing to me, considering the world our military  is
creating.


Let me put it this way BOYS!  You want to join a military MOST of the  world
now sees as the darkest force since Nazi Germany.  Thousands and  thousands of
innocent lives have been taken (and thousands more yet to be  taken), lives,
people, silenced, for good.

You want to be part of this killing, this silencing of human life, but are
crying that you can't do it with a rainbow sticker on your machine gun?   Oh,
you poor, poor baby!

Sacrificing your voice about your homosexuality is the LEAST you can offer
the lives you are so fucking eager to take!

Am I the rotten banana in the fruit basket for saying this?  So be  it!

A queer voice against war,
against queer/straight/other soldiers killing,

Subject:      why furniture is eating itself alive
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII

Lack of audience. People don't want to sit any more. With the invention of
the computer, there is no longer a need for flat surfaces to rest things
on. In the meantime, furniture is becoming less and less accomodating to
the human form. Bathtubs used to have claw feet.

Corruption in high places. The best furniture is forced to exist in little
rooms, while second rate knockoffs of old design fill the banquet halls of
the wealthy. Everybody has an interest in perpetrating this system,
including the gaskets.

Increasing isolation. Furniture doesn't talk to anything other than other
pieces of furniture. Wealthy furniture does not stand next to poor
furniture, or folk furniture, which is poorly made but expressive.

Furniture has never been popular. Nobody has liked furniture. It has
always been for a small segment of the elite who choose to educate
themselves in furniture. There was a time when people learned to make
furniture by heart, but none of it was any good, natch.

In conclusion: take humorous furniture seriously. Suppress the autophagic
urge of the sofa.

What Indians And Palestinians Share


Land and Freedom "Like the European colonization of America, the colonization of Palestine began with the imperial mindset that particularly flourished in the 19th century. We give Israel billions of dollars annually in aid, weapons and political support to underwrite those 19th-century colonial practices for which, surely, most 21st century Americans and Europeans are ashamed, however much they may want to forget....We cannot return to colonial America to undo the degradation of our own native peoples. But we can act to make sure ethnic cleansing doesn't continue in Palestine, now, in our names and with our money."


What Indians And Palestinians Share

by Justine McCabe - Znet; May 31, 2005

Controversy over Indian rights in Connecticut recently intensified when the federal government reversed its recognition of Stonington's Eastern Pequots and Kent- based Schaghticoke tribes. Overall, officials and the public appear pleased. Attorney General Richard Blumenthal said, "One reason this is so historic is because no positive recognition decision has been reversed before. This is a first for the nation, which makes it all the more significant and satisfying," according to The Litchfield County Times.

Clearly, it's not satisfying for Connecticut's indigenous peoples as their rights and attachment to the land continue to be challenged even centuries after first contact with European settlers.

Due-process arguments put into high relief the irony experienced by America's native peoples in obtaining recognition: they must prove they exist. They must demonstrate that their people and cultures actually survived government intentions to eradicate them and seize land on which survival depended.

Meanwhile, the original injustice is submerged in a bureaucratic system organized to disavow it: even applying for BIA recognition costs millions, encouraging many tribes to resort to casino investors despite their corruption of traditional native values. Indian participation (let alone success) in this admittedly suspect process arouses only insecurity and hostility among my non-Indian Kent neighbors. Tellingly, references to original dispossession and the enduring traumatic impact of European contact are circumvented. Expressions of collective responsibility or apologies are absent.

Most Americans experience a kind of collective denial about our shameful history. Yet its legacy lives dangerously on -- not just at home but also in our foreign policy.

As Attorney General Blumenthal began challenging Schaghticoke recognition, then- Palestinian presidential candidate Mahmoud Abbas was visiting some of the 400,000 Palestinian refugees in camps in Lebanon, reassuring them that their right to return to their homes in what is now Israel would not be abandoned in future negotiations.

There are more than 6 million Palestinian refugees who have been waiting to go home since the 1947-49 Naqba("catastrophe"). Most refugees live within 60 miles of their former homes, some close enough to see and weep for lost orchards and fields.

Like America's native peoples, Palestinians bear the burden of proof of their existence and right to their ancestral lands.

Possession of keys and deeds, or official registration as refugees with the U.N. haven't succeeded. Neither has international law. In fact, in keeping with several bodies of law, the U.N. explicitly conditioned Israel's 1949 U.N. admittance on its implementation of Resolution 194 affirming Palestinians' inalienable right to return home. Despite this, Israel has refused to allow its native peoples to return. The U.S. has implicitly supported this since the Truman administration.

Indeed, American Indian dispossession is older than that of the Palestinians. But the same national formative act -- and its denial -- constitute a significant component of the "special relationship" touted between the U.S. and Israel. This denial begs attention to fully explicate the complacency of American foreign policy in the face of undeniable antipathy toward the U.S. that has only grown since the invasion and occupation of Iraq.

Like Americans, Israelis "know" what their own historians have amply documented: Palestinian dispossession is the foundation of their state. Between 1947 and 1949, more than 75 percent of the native population was expelled by Zionist forces that seized their lands for exclusive Jewish-Israeli use. Then, in 1967, 35 percent of the population of Palestinian Gaza and the West Bank were forced out, some made refugees twice in a generation.

But for Palestinians and Israelis, this colonial past is present.

Every day since 1967, the 3.3 million Palestinians in the Occupied Territories continue to experience the post-modern version of manifest destiny: 400,000 Jewish settlers facilitate an ongoing Israeli land grab -- 200,000 during the Oslo "peace" period. In the past four years alone, Israel confiscated over 56,000 acres of Palestinian land, razed another 18,000 acres of farmland, uprooted over 1.1 million trees. Over 250 miles of Israeli-only bypass roads and hundreds of checkpoints have created more than 200 disconnected Palestinian reservations. Even if Israel evacuates Gaza, Prime Minister Sharon insists that the huge (illegal) West Bank settlements will stay. His intention is underscored by the soon-to-be-completed "separation" wall, which will seize another 15 percent of West Bank land and leave 600,000 Palestinians in an open-air prison between it and the Green Line.

Meanwhile, Israel's non-Jewish citizens cannot rent, own or live on "state" lands reserved exclusively for Jews -- 93 percent of the country. Under Israel's Law of Return, any Jew born anywhere can immigrate to Israel and become a citizen, yet indigenous refugees cannot go home.

Why does Israel continue violating international law? Its answer embraces that historically familiar -- but no less ethnocentric -- assertion: to maintain its "Jewish" character. Yet even within the Green Line, Israel is now, and has always been, a multicultural land where about 28 percent of its citizens are non-Jews, including at least 20 percent who are Palestinian.

But to the world's formerly colonized people -- the vast majority of the world's population--there's strong identification with the injustice to Palestinians that sustains hostility toward Israel and the U.S., and threatens the security of Americans as well as Israelis. At the deepest psychological level, American Indians and Palestinians bear witness to the fact that human attachment to home and land can neither be dismissed nor divided by politicians with impunity.

But it's not too late. Israel has not reached the entrenched U.S. condition that reduced American Indians to less than 1 percent of our population (about a third of whom live on reservations to which they were confined over a century ago). Instead, 78 percent of Jewish-Israelis occupy only 15 percent of the country, making it feasible for Palestinian refugees to return to largely unoccupied land with little displacement of Israelis living there now. Sharing the land is a matter of fairness and international will, not viability.

Like the European colonization of America, the colonization of Palestine began with the imperial mindset that particularly flourished in the 19th century. We give Israel billions of dollars annually in aid, weapons and political support to underwrite those 19th-century colonial practices for which, surely, most 21st century Americans and Europeans are ashamed, however much they may want to forget.

We cannot return to colonial America to undo the degradation of our own native peoples. But we can act to make sure ethnic cleansing doesn't continue in Palestine, now, in our names and with our money.

Conference On Raza Prisoners
Bulletin No. 3,  June 1, 2005

Justice And Liberation! Not Incarceration!

Conference On Raza Prisoners And Colonialism

Sat., June 25, 2005
Rudy Acuña Cultural Center/Cafe On A Street
438 South “A” Street
Oxnard, CA
(805) 487-8170

I. Introduction To CMPP and Prison Conferences
II.  Objectives of Conference
III. Concerns/Issues of Conference
IV. Tentative Program
V. Who Should Attend The Conference?
VI. Partial List of Endorsers

I.  Introduction

The CMPP was founded in 1993 and is a member of the Raza Rights
Coalition, a coalition under the leadership of Union del Barrio. Since
its inception, the CMPP’s work has been guided by three general objectives:
1. Raise the social political consciousness of Raza prisoners and win
them over to the struggle for the national liberation of Mexicanos and
away from crime.
2. Expose to our communities and the world, the role that prisons play
in  maintaining capitalism, imperialism, and colonialism.
3. Struggle for the human rights of all prisoners.

In an effort to bring into fruition our objectives, for over 10 years
the CMPP has been in the forefront of the struggle for the human rights
of Raza prisoners and in educating our communities to the role that the
prison system plays in the oppression and colonization of La Raza.

Guided by our three general objectives, the CMPP has organized hundreds
of actions.  These actions have included: community education (walking
through the barrios and talking to people), forums and workshops,
anti-prison brutality demonstrations, yearly conferences, and the
mailing of educational material to hundreds of Raza.

The prison conferences themselves have served as centros, or
information/ideological institutions, for Raza prison activists to come
together to (1) share and learn from each other's experiences, (2) move
forward the  importance of organization  to our struggle and consolidate
the network of prison activists, (3) connect the question of prisons to
the Mexican national liberation struggle, and (4) to unite with all
progressives forces in the fight against the capitalist-imperialist
globalization of prisons as institutions of social control and profit
making.  These continue to be the general objectives of the conferences.

A particularly important focus of this year’s conference is to connect
the question of prisons within the current borders of the United States
(Occupied America), the war on terrorism,  and the resistance of masses
throughout the world to global capitalism and neo-imperialism.

A book, titled Jail The Oppressor, Free The Oppressed was published in
2002, which incorporates much of the information gathered from past
conferences and ten years of the CMPP activism.

II. Objectives of Conference

Organized under the theme Justice and Liberation, Not Incarceration,
this year’s conference has three concrete objectives.  They are:
1. Build The Movement. Bring together at least 50 activists.  We are
talking about activists who are already involved in the prison rights
anti-imperialist/globalization movement or are interested in becoming
part of this movement.
2. Consolidate Our Efforts and Resources. Bring at least 10
organizations to join and support the conference and consolidate the
network of those those working on the prison issue. A broad network of
Raza activists will be consolidated in order to make our work more
effective.
3. Contribute To The Developing Of Liberation Information. The
publishing of a post-conference book/document on proceedings of
conference as a way of educating prisoners, our community, and
allies/friends in struggle, will be a priority.

III. Conference Focus/Concerns

The conference will focus on four key areas:

1. Stop Terrorism and Inhumane Treatment Within Prisons: Addressing the
question of the SHUs, Gang Violence, Guard Abuse, Psychological and
Physical Terror, from a national liberation perspective.

2. Prisoner Rights and Organizing In The Pintas:  What Organizations are
doing regarding Freedom/Defense Committees and Campaigns, Organizing
Prisoners, and Prisoner/Family Assistance Programs.

3. Raising Consciousness: Connecting The Prison Rights Struggle To
Liberation Consciousness Raising in the Community/Schools, Within The
Movement, and Building A Network of Raza Prison Activists (NRPA).

4. Globalization/Imperialism and Questions of Prisons: Building and
Uniting Nationally-Internationally With Progressive Forces To End The
Mass Imprisonment of Poor and Working Class People.

IV. Conference Agenda (tentative)

12:00       Registration/Refreshments

12:30       Welcome/and Keynote Speaker

1:00        First  and Second Sessions (concerns/focus)

4:15        Break

4:30        Summation and Closing Statements

V. Who Should Attend The Conference?
We strongly encourage the following to attend the conference:
1. Raza activists who believe in the self-determination and national
liberation of Raza and want to learn more about the connection between
prisons and the oppression of the great majority of nuestra Raza.
2. Anti-global/Anti-Imperialist Activists who see the growing
imprisonment as a means  by which capitalism-imperialism seeks the
social political control of the masses, with the objective of
facilitating the  exploitation of their labor and the world’s natural
resources.
3. Social Justice Activists who want to eliminate brutality/torture
chambers in prisons, here within the belly of the beast, and throughout
the world.
4. Community residents, teachers, health workers, and students, who want
to end the growing incarceration of Raza, specially youth, and develop
alternative programs that will provide adequate school funding and
relevant education (Raza Studies, Critical Pedagogy, Democratic
Schooling, etc.), job development, and health services (one fourth of
all prisoners suffer from mental health problems).
5. Women Rights Activists who recognize and want to something do
regarding the fact that the fasting growing sector of society who are
being imprisoned are women, many who are sexually abused in prison, and
their children sent to foster homes and detention centers.
6. Raza/Chicano Studies Scholars and Students who want to learn more
about the 20% of our population (men, women, and youth) who are either
incarcerated or tied (through parole, probation, etc.) to the so-called
criminal justice system.

Hi,

Sarah and I are shutting down Furniture's doors for a few months because:

1. Boiler explosion left us with a wet basement and many D-stroyed objects.

2. Another move! We'll send you the new address as soon as we have a comput=

Cheers,

the distinction between the humourous (and profound)
Fielding and the comic (usually, witty, rather, and
superficial) Sterne is a very old critical topos.
Sterne is often praised for his wit, but then often
written off as not typically English--more "French"
really if you get my meaning.  indeed, the French are
often spoken of as witty, but the English as humorous
in the 18th century.

there is something that is being said in this
discussion, but I would be aware of how interested the
parties were in mapping particular positions about
what is humourous and what is comic (notice, also,
that the terms are parallel, exactly).

just to add though to the theoretical apercus here, I
have always liked Hobbes' description:  "Laughter is
sudden glory."  That just knocks me out -- every time.

Hi Chris.  I hope you're getting this on some computer if not your own.  There are at least two general kinds of Buddhism-- Mahayana and Theravada.  The kind I studied and practice as much as possible is Theravada, the Buddhism of Burma, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Cambodia, etc. In Mahayana, it is possible that we all are or will become Buddhas.  Many people become Bodhisattvas, Buddhas in training so to speak.  In Theravada, however, there is only one Buddha for each world-cycle.  Ours was Siddhartha Shakyamuni who lived around 500 B.C.  It will be millions of years before another one rolls around in the next world cycle.  I hope your computer gets fixed soon or replaced.  I enjoy this discussion. Regards, Tom Savage

furniture_ press <furniture_press@GRAFFITI.NET> wrote:i think i may have erred in hypothesizing the all-writ nature of charles and co. perhaps a new hypothesis can be stated in the context of this discussion:

if buddha is the presence writing all posts, and we actually have the experience and memory of this action, that is if we're actually doing the writing, then we are all buddhas.

it's also very funny to use the words "that is" because it's universal. just think how many writers use the term "that is". it's like gertrude stein attack, like hamburger.

it's actually pretty funny to think this post will be an hour long, a spontaneous outbreak of ideas according to tom's behaviors in cyberspace. steve i hope you'll get involved in this too, if you have time. i'll give some examples of a day's thinking.

many friends i talk to and many who i've never talked to, whom i'm assuming might be in the same position as we/us, i mean all of us, we're so conscious of history. we know even libraries know that they're eventually going to approach a writer and ask for his/her papers, buying them and building a catalogue of their life's work so that future generations may have a context. in like fashion my friends and colleagues are already preparing their papers, young artists they are, by filing them and saving every piece of mail that comes to them. how has e-mail changed that? well, no more typesetting that's for sure! it's all cut and paste and layout now. so easy. so if we're going to talk about poetry eating itself we should also turn to our friends and colleagues, first, and then to ourselves in the context of this organization of lifework, and do something along the lines of getting the material out of the way and returning to a state of orality (just joking, maybe, we'll see). im
agine if
 we meet our elders in order to gather information about their peers and friends and colleagues? but take it a step further, and look at the possible irony of the situation. lies come easily.

i'm embarking upon a project of disinformation. my friend jean, who i mentioned in my last post and may be privy to all this soon, if i let her in on it, told me one night that she feels like, i can't remember the word she used but it was close to fraud, something along those lines, because she, now i can't remember why she thought so, but i think it had to do with her involvement in the writing and and doing of poetry and of it being involved with other writers. i think her main point was that she was being lauded by her peers but she didn't think she was doing anything purposeful, meaningful, in the long run, and she couldn't understand why there was so much optimism in something so elusive.

thusly we arrived at a point of eating. with all the illusions in the world that if something is added or taken away like must happen to what it is being added to or taken away from. eating is an illusion, poetry eating itself alive is a total paradox of faith: we do poetry and nothing happens. we feed it and it gets smaller. we ignore it it gets bigger. the eating metaphor is wearing me down because it is a special kind of problem that we've just skimmed the surface of, and now with the introduction of buddhist pratice and thought and this eating behavior i want to start to make connections. and thusly jean is right, we are frauds, if we are going to think like this, about making the connections here on/in this space and come to a conclusion that we all can understand, by equating, with words, a buddhism and eating. like tom said about the moon and the act of pointing to the moon, writing these equations is poiting to the moon, but the text itself is the moon, or is it the r
eading
 and responding to it the moon? or is the moon the moon?

what we're basically imparting to our peers and friends is disinformation, and they know it. that is, they know nothing. who knows something? we can define and move further away from definition. just to introduce derrida for a moment and then let him sleep comfortably, we define words with words, which need to be defined by more words, so it is futile, an endless defining, communication can become an endlessnessism. and the words pour forth from my legs.

respond, welsh, automobile, docile, italy.
verb, adjective, noun, adjective, noun.

jean is right about our writing poetry, and my project of disinformation feeds on that teet. why is it so hard for me to read poetry that keeps pointing? i can't even fathom an instant where i'm writing lyric as narrative, using all this symbology to enhance my understanding:

the days are long and arduous, now that
the ladder has been lifted to the barn's
second window. mom always asks, "how does
it lean so?" the wind is virile with pink
sleep.

none of it happened. i can't write right. and the writing of this letter now is total shit because it is a thought pattern. i can manifesto all i want, but then it sounds like a dance.

the fraud of it lies in the breaking down of the text, like one of this size, and preparing it for nothing. today is not a day of associations, and i've exhausted my thoughts. now i'm playing with the idea that out of all this will come something, and it's been 35 minutes.

where am i going with this? ah, i've been trying now for 35 minutes to make the associations, consciously, of what eating and the moon and pointing to it have in common. everything. it has nothing in common with everything. depends on who's looking.

it is a custom to be at least legible when we talk to people. i'll let ego in the way now. my life is surrounded by people who constantly ask me to either make sense or to fit in with social con vention so that it is possible for people to take me seriously. i'm not so much worried about being misunderstood than me compromizing my nature and that is to be spontaneous (but with a little forethought - i am a bit of a child at heart).

what i really wanted to do was to list events of action and non-action so that i may not say anytyhing, so that you can read and respond as was like in the last few days. and i needed then to bring in this idea that buddhism is not really foreign to me but i can do some more learning, and that catholicism is what i was brought into. this world. perhaps my big break from the iconoclastic nature of catholicism, the law, the dogma, the ritual, is my bringing upon myself a paranoia of sense. that's it! that's the breakthrough! i have a grand paranoia of making sense to someone.

I AM UNWILLING TO MAKE SENSE BECAUSE I AM RESPONDING TO MY CATHOLIC INHERITANCE.

i'm not even very familiar, i mean i do remember most of the service during mass, and i do remember some of the laws but i'm now wholly sure what the jist of a catholicism is. i'm even afraid, no, not afraid, but unwilling to come to terms with it by bringing it out in the open with my peers, because when we start to talk about catholicism, everyone goes bonkers. this kid at the park, a teenager, said two daysd ago something like, well, i can't remember exactly what he said but it was either he's against the idea of god, like he's an atheist, or that people, oh now i remember, he said "people who believe in god/go to church are narrow mined. believe me, i should know". well, i believe in god (not an avid churchgoer though i should be, i want to, hell, i'm admitting it to my peers!) but i'm not close minded, judgemental, yes, stubborn, of course, but not close minded! but these are some of the things i hear people say about refusing to believe in a god because of the instituti
on's
 pratices.

here is my idea:

i have friends who left their church because of reasons of "brainwashing/militarism/sexism/cover ups" but are avid believers in god and have found new, less restrictive churches. this church actually said that if they leave their church they're leaving god. oppression under god's name? hmm, and let us take it out of bounds for a second: using an object in a word's name? the whole pointing thing is equal to this. we use god's name to defend an institution's practice and laws; we use words to defend an object's being. all point for a reason. the reason is arbitrary. now i do believe that if an institution is using a name to defend itself, the name eventually goes bad and we can't trust either the intitution nor the name. we're at a dead end. i don't want to ascribe any solutions but this is something to think about.

so why my distrust in poetry? this whole idea of eating? it has to do with this unsaid symbology. all poetry in the traditional sense of finding meaning so that we may understand the nature of things. i know this is all retroactive, it's all been said before. i don't know where i'm going to go with this idea, it does inform my writing.

i'm tired now. THERE MUST BE SOMETHING IN THIS THAT IS FAIR.

CHRIS

Craig, you are of course not the only queer to stand against war and the imperialism of our gov't (on another note--Alain Badiou totally rocks!). Your logic, however, in saying that "sacrificing your voice about your homosexuality is the LEAST you can offer the lives you are so fucking eager to take!" is specious at best. "We" homosexuals, queers, bisexuals, trans, and etceteras certainly do not "owe" any one specific civil right for the lives "we" take as soldiers serving in the military. That queers could possibly want to join the military disappoints and exacerbates me every bit as much as it obviously frustrates you, but "we" etceteras have the right to be assholes, dupes, pawns, ideologues, and proto-fascists like everyone else. You're really harping on the wrong issue. How is it that any citizen in America could possibly have supported Dubbya in the first place, let alone (almost) elected him? How was it even close enough to be stolen?! And how could they -- "we" -- pos
sibly
 re-elect him? How is it that people identify with the nation-state as a paternalistic figure whose word becomes self-founding truth, even despite facts to the contrary?

If you're really so angry (as I hope everyone on this list is, though too much anger I believe can overwhelm you and become counter-productive), you should try investigating the machinations of these enabling psycho-social dynamics and how, possibly, to subvert them. Relieving homo-etceteras of their civil rights, confluent and complicit as that is with the militaristic-imperialist ethic of erasing difference--the better to be "disciplined" (its Foucauldian echoes raising the further issue/problematic of the identification, itself, with/as a "speciated" identity and its own imbrications with a psycho-social containment strategy)--is decidedly NOT the way. I do do do wish I could tell you what the magic route to the Solution was...

Best,

Tod

The Philadelphia Gay News and every other gay news platform is making it
clear that they are behind the newest push for gay American soldiers to be OUT
to serve. This is just amazing to me, considering the world our military is
creating.


Let me put it this way BOYS! You want to join a military MOST of the world
now sees as the darkest force since Nazi Germany. Thousands and thousands of
innocent lives have been taken (and thousands more yet to be taken), lives,
people, silenced, for good.

You want to be part of this killing, this silencing of human life, but are
crying that you can't do it with a rainbow sticker on your machine gun? Oh,
you poor, poor baby!

Sacrificing your voice about your homosexuality is the LEAST you can offer
the lives you are so fucking eager to take!

Am I the rotten banana in the fruit basket for saying this? So be it!

Sometimes slight, modest appearing things suddenly get very large in volume
& presence. I am writing of Kit Robinson's "poem" which just arrived in the
mail. Two feather weight pieces of 8.5 x 10" gray paper folded in half,
printed both sides and staple stitched together, complete with a full double
page minimalist piece of art, a grid work by Ericka McConnell, that looks
like a metal grated shop gate slashed with one dark splash of shadow.
Indeed the segments/increments of Kit's work seems so appropriate to the
grid as a format - each poem's space a rectangle somehow connected to the
next one so that the entire sequence becomes a well ordered screen though
which some sense of completed order finds its resonance.
I leave a sample "increment", one of fourteen:

The Smallest Increment

Writing, as running, an exercise for the breath. A way of
engaging time. Lest time take all away.

A physical, sensual art, bound into the body, not evidently the
stuff of pure ideation. Rhythm, always of the essence.

Signs that the writer is still awake, attempting something, even
Though...

The smallest increment, a light or sound, being enough to satisfy,
the impulse to record.

Note lack of verbs. To say that something "does" something
would already be too much.

Ten Most Harmful Books of the 19th and 20th Centuries

They hang the man and flog the woman
That steal the goose from off the common,
But let the greater villain loose
That steals the common from the goose.

".....at a time when I am speaking to you about the paradox of desire -- in
the
sense that different goods obscure it -- you can hear outside the awful
language
of power.  There's no point in asking whether they are sincere or
hypocritical,
whether they want peace of whether they calculate the risks.  The dominating
impression as such a moment is that something that may pass for a prescribed
good; information addresses and captures impotent crowds to whom it is poured

forth like a liquor that leaves them dazed as they move toward the slaughter
house.
One might even ask if one would allow the cataclysm to occur without first
giving
free reign to this hubbub of voices...."

one edit, one clarification of my previous post:

there terms "comedy" and "humour" are _not_ strictly
parallel, most specifically in that comedy is a mode
or genre, while humor is a mood or stylistic element.

and while I did want to say that it may be that the
distinction being made is polemical and that one
should keep in mind what scores are being settled, cui
bono and follow the money (oh, My Friend you were a
friend indeed), etc,
at the same time I don't think the distinction or
difference is _simply_ a matter of literary or
political politics.  there is something there, that
is, between the comic and the humorous, but the terms
themselves and distinctions being drawn may be doing
other work at the same time.

finally, another quote, this time from Sterne (out of
something classical):  "It is not things themselves,
but men's [sic] opinions of them that cause
perplexities in human affairs."

Proposal for Panel
PSYCHOANALYSIS, COMMUNITY, AND TWENTIETH-CENTURY AMERICAN LITERATURE

For The Association for the Psychoanalysis of Culture and Society
Annual Conference on PSYCHOANALYSIS AND COMMUNITY

November 4-6, 2005 at Rutgers University

Plenary Speakers: Willy Apollon and Eric Santner

Douglas Dowland, The University of Iowa, Panel Chair

What foundational psychoanalytic tensions are wrought out in the
representation of community in literature?  This panel seeks examples of
how psychoanalytic theory and practice illuminates representations of
communities in modern and contemporary American literature.  Examples from
all genres of literature, including canonical and non-canonical texts, will
be considered.  A variety of approaches, including orthodox and unorthodox
psychoanalytic practices, are appreciated.

Paper proposals should consider how tensions in communities are
historically and politically influenced and how these tensions may be
mitigated by the history and politics of psychoanalysis as practiced
concurrently in America.  In other words, how does "psychoanalysis"
redefine "community" and how does "community" demand provide a necessary
contour of psychoanalytic practice?

Papers of a meta-commentary nature will also be considered, including how
characters can separated from the community of the text to be analyzed
discretely, and issues in the creation of a community in a text that may or
may not correspond to an actual community.

Ultimately, all paper proposals should focus in on the close reading of a
text to yield psychoanalytic insight about communities as represented in
the (potential) limitations of both literary and psychoanalytic texts.

Paper proposals should be up to 500 words and sent as an e-mail attachment
to <douglas-dowland@uiowa.edu> by July 1, 2005.  Please include a current
C.V. with the proposal.

Michael Todd,
first, your saying, "you are of course not the only queer to
stand against war and the imperialism" is said as though
I said I was "The queer" when in fact I said "A queer against war."
You do understand that, right?  "A" not "The"  ???

Second, to say that I "should try investigating the machinations
of these enabling psycho-social dynamics and how,
possibly, to subvert them" is your way of saying that I do not.
You really don't know me to make such a claim on me,
but if you would like to get to know me, that's another story.

But back to the original argument, queers have
a HUGE fucking history of shaking this country to the core!

Queers marched in Selma, and were VERY much OUT against
the Vietnam war.  Yes there are many of us now who are opposed
to this war in Iraq, but my point is that the queer "community" as
a whole has shifted focus to whimper the "Let Him Serve" phrase
over and over and fucking over and over!

The pace has picked up since Memorial Day, all the queer media
with their RIDICULOUS ads of sad men in uniform, that Fire Island
kind of romance in the air, his boyfriend standing behind him with
hand on shoulder.  oh Brother it makes me sick!  OOOO, how  handsome
he is in his uniform!  Whatever!  He's a fucking killer,  period!

And actually Michael, NO i do not agree that we get to be fascists,
anymore than Jews get to be, or Germans, or anyone else!  NO way  man,
that's fucking bullshit!  I'm NOT about to agree with you!   That's such
bullshit right out of the mouth of HRC.  The fucking Human Rights  Campaign
has a fucking Republican scumbag heading it now, and NO to that too!
I'm NOT interested in tolerating Gay Republicans, ever!

I say NO to letting queers into the army!  EVER!  We need to be  our own
fucking army and STOP this fucking war in Iraq and the war against  the
poor everywhere (like right down the street).

POET-AGENT IN SEARCH OF TRANSVESTITE  BOXER

The pink, frilly, faggy clip to the chin of oppression!  While the fringe of
the queer community is forgotten, even censored, we will  make our way through
the ranks all champion boxers made as an emblem for their  minority outcast
peoples throughout history! Looking for the world's toughest,  queer
transvestite boxer dedicated to winning the heavyweight belt. Must be  willing to wear
pink gloves with drawings of Judy Garland's face hitting the  high note to
punch out Tyson's woman-beating sorry ass once and for all! From  there we will
take the gay and lesbian community back from the money-sucking gay  republican
scum whose 1969 counterparts fled out the back door of Stonewall,  leaving the
revolution in the hands of the fearless queens and dykes! Can you  resurrect

here's the version from today's ny daily news:

http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/M/MASSACHUSETTS_POET_LAUREATE?SITE=NYNY
D&SECTION=NATIONAL&TEMPLATE=DEFAULT

here's the text from there pasted here:

Mass. Lawmaker Pushes for Poet Laureate

By STEVE LeBLANC
Associated Press Writer

BOSTON (AP) -- Throughout its history, Massachusetts has been home and host
to some of the nation's most celebrated poets, from Emily Dickinson and
Henry Wadsworth Longfellow to Robert Lowell and Sylvia Plath. Despite that,
the state has never had a poet laureate. However, that could soon change if
lawmakers adopt a bill to create an official position of poet laureate.

"With poetry there's no socio-economic or age bias," said Democratic State
Rep. Anne Gobi. "This is a way to say 'Hey, the arts are important.'"

The only duty for the poet named to the unpaid post would be to "act as a
public emissary and advocate for poetry in the state," under the language of
the legislation.

Gobi said the idea for the bill started with a conversation she had with a
friend in a local poetry writing group. The friend suggested Massachusetts,
with its rich literary heritage, should have its own poet laureate.

After doing research, Gobi agreed, noting that virtually every other New
England state boasts an official laureate.

Under the bill, the Massachusetts Cultural Council would be charged with
coming up with a list of three candidates. The only requirement would be
that they either live or work in the state. The list would then be sent to
the governor, who would make the final choice for the two-year term.

There should be no shortage of candidates.

Prominent poets with ties to the state include former U.S. poet laureate
Robert Pinsky, who teaches at Boston University, and Nobel laureate and
Irish poet Seamus Heaney, who teaches at Harvard University.

For those who prefer a grittier style, Massachusetts also is home to regular
poetry slams where poets go head-to-head in bars, coffee shops and
galleries, each hoping to wow the crowd and move on to the next round.

The idea has met with some skepticism.

"When I initially heard of it I thought it was a useless idea," said Louisa
Solano, longtime owner and operator of the Grolier Poetry Book Shop in
Harvard Square in Cambridge. "I'm just afraid in Massachusetts it would be
too concentrated on Boston and Cambridge and forget the rest of the state."

But the more she thought about it, the more she said she warmed to the idea
- provided that whoever is named poet laureate isn't trapped in an insular
literary world.

"I would hope it is someone with good reading ability and writing ability
but someone who also has an ability to reach out into the community," said
Solano, who also writes poetry.

It may be useful to look at the etymological derivations of the two words.
"Wit" derives from the idea of perception, guidance, wisdom. It has to do with
mind, intelligence. "Humorous" derives from the thery of humours. It has to do
with excess, a defect (of character) due to imbalance. Almost, they are
opposites.

For instance, Elizabethan and Jacobean literatures (Shakespeare, Ben Jonson)
create comedies of humor. Even the wit of Hamlet (obviously a great
intelligence) falls apart, disintegrates in his humorous (melancholy) state and the
state of Denmark.

The 18th century "cleans up" humor and replaces with wit.

Hazlitt's distinction between the two is seen through the 18th century:
"Humor is, as it were, the growth of nature and accident; wit is the product of art
and fancy."

In my view, Coleridge's distinction between "imagination" and "fancy" is the
same idea given a reverse spin: obsession is at the heart of poetic
imagination. Put in another way, what is wit with no intimation of insanity?

   so i made an attempt to contact telus so they could explain the
situation with the indymedia sites. i was put in touch with someone who
said his name was ekemini (827170). he said that the
http://bc.indymedia.org and  http://victoria.indymedia.org sites do not
exist. however, a friend who has shaw could access the site which i
informed them of.  this is when ekemini (827170) askes me to try this
site http://cnn.com and askes me to read him the headline which was
Suspected Al-Zarqawi deputy arrested in Iraq i asked him why? what the
relevance was to this situation and he simply asked me to read it.
instead i read him the other smaller headline: U.S.: Guards, detainees
mishandled Quran

after a longtime on hold the tech cameback and said that they would run
a test around my area and location which turned out that that telus
couldn't  access the sites http://bc.indymedia.org nor the
http://victoria.indymedia.org . from here i was informed that the
problem and information and the results from my trace rout and ping test
which i had to forward to them would be sent to "apps dept" -- they are
the domain hosting service for telus.

they would get back to me in 48hrs.

for your info (below is a note by one telus tech (peter tech #82359))

as visitor and contributor to the vic and bc indy media sites which has
the most inforamtion on black politics, islam and muslim issues, as well
as local police brutality, i wish to inform you that telus internet
subscribers have been blocked from viewing your site for the past week
and the problem still persists and is unresolved by telus.

on june 2 i spoke with tech named ben who said that issue was with telus
and it was being resolved within 24hrs. he also said that when he went
to access the site it simply sent him to
http://victoria.indymedia.org.com. however, when he spoke with a tech
who did not use telus the site was reached.
i attempted to access the address 24hrs later and the attempt failed.

on june 3 i spoke with peter  who simply sent me this note after 1 hour
of running around and being placed on hold countless times by him.
peter (peter tech #82359) refused to do a trace route from telus and
insisted that i preform the trace route which i did and the result was
the the sites did not exist.

on june 4 i spoke with jahan who refuse again to perform a trace route,
placed me on hold and then refused to explain, said that it was
"irellivant", as to why
telus members cannot reach the site and others can who are employed with
telus but do not use telus as a server.  each time i asked he accuse me
of not "cooperting" and threaten to terminate unless i stop asking
question and just do another trace route. any questions is asked we dodged.

when as a telus subscriber, i, and apparently others, attempt to view
the sites the connection times out or redirects the telus client to
http://victoria.indymedia.org.com.  we as telus subscribers are being
denied access to the bc and victoria indie media sites.

The Reference Division of Columbia University Press seeks indexers for a
6-18 month project. The successful candidates should be detail-oriented
and meticulous and should have experience with databases as well as an
interest in poetry. College degree required, preferably in English. Any
experience in library cataloguing and/or copyediting would be useful.

Indexers for the Granger's World of Poetry website will work with poetry
texts to enter the titles, first lines, and last lines into a database,
along with the author of the poems. A subject of the poem in question is
assigned, so the indexer must be skilled at quickly skimming over the
texts to pick up the main theme. Ability to work quickly and accurately
in a deadline-oriented environment essential. Submit resume, cover

--------------------------------------------

Above the world-weary horizons
New obstacles for exchange arise
Or unfold,
O ye postmasters!


1. About the Poetics List

With the preceding epigraph, the Poetics Listserv was founded by Charles
Bernstein in late 1993. Now in its fourth incarnation, the list has
about 1200 subscribers worldwide. We also have a substantial number of
nonsubscribing readers, who access the list through our web site (see
archive URL above).

The Poetics List is not a forum for a general discussion of poetry or
for the exchange of poems. Our aim is to support, inform, and extend
those directions in poetry that are committed to innovations,
renovations, and investigations of form and/or/as content, to the
questioning of received forms and styles, and to the creation of the
otherwise unimagined, untried, unexpected, improbable, and impossible.
While we recognize that other lists may sponsor other possibilities for
exchange, we request that those participating in this forum keep in mind
the specialized and focused nature of this project and respect our
decision to operate a moderated list. The Poetics List exists to support
and encourage divergent points of view on innovative forms of modern and
contemporary poetry and poetics, and we are committed to do what is
necessary to preserve this space for such dialog.

Due to the high number of subscribers, we no longer maintain the open
format with which the list began (at under 100 subscribers). The
specific form of moderation that we employ is a relatively fluid one: in
most cases, messages are reviewed after having been posted to the list,
and difficulties resolved on that basis; however, the listserv editorial
board may shift between this and a pre-review mode which calls for all
messages to be read and approved before being forwarded to the list. We
prefer to avoid this option as it hampers the spontaneity of discussion
that we hope to promote. In addition to these options, the editorial
board will unsubscribe individuals if they are not, in our opinion,
productively contributing to the list or following our guidelines. We
remain committed to this editorial function as a defining element of the
Poetics List.

Please also note that this is a private list and information about this
list should not be posted to other lists or directories of lists. The
idea is to keep the list membership to those with specific rather than
general interests, and also to keep the scale of the list relatively
small and the volume manageable. The current limits of the list are
generally 50 messages per day, and one or two messages per subscriber
per day; but these limits are subject to change withouth notice.

In addition to being archived at through the EPC
(http://epc.buffalo.edu) and at
http://listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu/archives/poetics.html, some posts to
Poetics (especially reviews, obituary notices, announcements, etc.) may
also become part of specific EPC subject areas. Brief reviews of poetry
events and publications are always welcome; we also encourage posts that
announce events important to our subscribers. See section 5 for details.

Note also that Roof Books published Joel Kuszai's edited collection of
the Poetics List; this is available from ROOF and also on line at the EPC.

2. Posting to the List

The Poetics List is a moderated list. All messages are reviewed by the
editors in keeping with the goals of the list as articulated in this
Welcome Message (see section 1).

Please note that while this list is primarily concerned with discussions
of poetry and poetics, messages relating to politics and political
activism, film, art, media, and so forth are also welcome. We strongly
encourage subscribers to post information, including web links, relating
to publications (print and internet), reading series, and blogs that
they have coordinated, edited, published, or in which they appear. Such
announcements constitute a core function of this list. Brief reviews of
poetry events and publications (print or digital) are always welcome.

We do not accept postings of creative work not directed toward a
discussion of poetics issues on the list. The Poetics List is not a
venue for the posting of free-standing, personal poems or journal entries.

Also, please note that the Poetics List is not a "chat" list and we
discourage the posting of  very short messages intended for only a few
subscribers.

Subscribers only may post to the Poetics List. Send messages directly to
the list address: poetics@listserv.buffalo.edu.


3. Subscriptions

*For all subscription requests go to
http://listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu/archives/poetics.html.

*To subscribe for the first time click on "Subscribe (join) a List."
Immediately following your subscription to the poetics listserv we ask
that you email poetics@buffalo.edu, subject-line "registration," with
your full name, street address, email address, and telephone number.
Failure to register at the time of subscription will result in automatic
deletion from the subscription roll.

*To manage your subscription (for descriptions of the different
subscription options please see section 3), click on "Subscriber's Corner."

Subscriptions to the Poetics List are free of charge, but formal
registration is required. All other questions about subscriptions,
whether about an individual subscription or subscription policy, should
be addressed to this same administrative address.

PLEASE NOTE: All subscription-related information and correspondence
remains absolutely confidential.

All posts to the list must provide your full real name, as registered.
If there is any discrepancy between your full name as it appears in the
"from" line of the message header, please sign your post at the bottom.
Subscribers who do not include their full name with each post will be
unsubcribed form the list.

The most frequent problem with subscriptions is bounced messages. If
your system is often down or if you have a low disk quota, Poetics
messages may get bounced, which will result in your subscription being
automatically terminated by the Listserv program and the automatically
generated message telling you that this has occurred will also likely
bounce. If this happens, you may re-subscribe to the list by the same
process described above. One remedy to avoid this happening in the
future: set your list options to "no-mail" and read the list on the web.



4. Subscription Options

We encourage you to alter your subscription options via the link on the
right side of the screen at
http://listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu/archives/poetics.html. If you would
prefer not to use the web-interface, you may also email
<listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu> the following commands:

*to subscribe to the Poetics listserv send listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu
this one-line message with no "subject": sub poetics [your Firstname and
Lastname]

*RECOMMENDED: if you wish to read the list on our web interface and not
receive any messages sent directly, while remaining subscribed to the
list and so eligible to send us posts, send this one-line message to
<listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu> with no "subject": set poetics nomail.
Note: this option is also useful for temporary suspension of email service.

*to reactivate Poetics e-mail send <listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu> this
one-line message with no "subject": set poetics mail

* to receive the list in digest form (you will receive the day's
individual posts in one email sent just after midnight EST), send
<listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu> this one-line message with no "subject":
set poetics digest

*to receive posts in the default option (you will receive individual
postings immediately), send <listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu> this one-
line message with no "subject": set poetics nodigest

* to receive the list in index form (you will receive a list, without
the text of the posts, of the subjects discussed each day along with the
author's name and address and the number of lines it comprises; you can
also choose to have the index sent to you in either plain text or in
HTML format with hyperlinks), send <listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu> this
one-line message with no "subject": set poetics nohtml index --or-- set
poetics html index

PLEASE NOTE: do not leave your Poetics subscription in default or digest
mode if you are going to be away for any extended period of time. Your
account may become flooded and you may lose Poetics messages as well as
other important mail. In such cases, switch your subscription to
"nomail" as recommended above.



5. To Unsubscribe

To unsubscribe (or change any of your subscription options), again, we
strongly encourage you to go to the right-hand side of the screen at
http://listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu/archives/poetics.html You may also may
unsubscribe by sending a one-line email to
<listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu> with no "subject": unsub poetics

If you are having difficulty unsubscribing, please note: sometimes your
e-mail address may be changed slightly by your system administrator. If
this happens you will not be able to send messages to Poetics or to
unsubscribe, although you will continue to receive mail from the Poetics
List. To avoid this problem, unsub using your old address, then
resubscribe with your new email address.

6. Cautions

"Flame" messages will not be tolerated on the Poetics List. We define
'flaming' as any post that resembles a personal attack or personal
insult to anyone--subscriber or not. This of course includes racial
slurs as well as ad hominem arguments in which the person rather than
their work is attacked; in other words while critique of a person's work
is welcome (critical inquiry is one of the main functions of the list),
this critique cannot extend to a critique or criticism of the person.

The listserv is intended to be a productive communal space for
discussion and announcements; as such, subscribers who do not follow
listserv policy on flaming will be removed from the subscription roll.

For reasons of basic security, we do not allow pseudonymous
subscriptions. All messages intended for the Poetics List should be sent
in Text-Only format, without attachments. We do not accept
HTML-formatted messages or attached files. As a general rule, keep
individual posts to 1,000 words or less.

Please do not publish list postings without the express permission of
the author. Posting on the list is a form of publication. Copyright for
all material posted on Poetics remains with the author; material from
this list and its archive may not be reproduced without the author's
permission, beyond the standard rights accorded by "fair use" of
published materials.

All material on the Poetics List remains the property of the authors;
before you reproduce this material, in whole or in part, we ask that you
get permission (by email is fine) from the authors. If they give
permission, then we ask only that you say that the post or posts
appeared originally on the Poetics List
(http://epc.buffalo.edu/poetics/welcome.html) on [give date and say:]
Used by permission of the author.

As an outside maximum, we will accept no more than 2 messages per day
from any one subscriber. Also, given that our goal is a manageable list
(manageable both for moderators and subscribers), the list accepts 50 or
fewer messages per day.

Like all systems, the listserv will sometimes be down: if you feel your
message has been delayed or lost, *please wait at least one day to see
if it shows up*, then check the archive to be sure the message is not
posted there; if you still feel there is a problem, you may wish to
contact the editors at <poetics@acsu.buffalo.edu>.

This sounds like fun! Are  the "theme" possibilities pre-established for the
indexer? For example, variables of overcoming or being overcome by "grief "
"love " "war" "humor" "nature" "language theory" etc? Or is an indexer left
on their inventive own?
To the degree that such an index may direct a public search and/or use of a
poem, sounds like the indexer is put in an odd position of power. I mean it
sounds like poor poem could be pummeled by the reductive nature of an index.

(Or what bookstore and library shelves - tangible searches - have over
database reducium data).

But do correct me if I am off the hook here,

what does this say about the type of poetry book's they're indexing.
so for instance the theme of Coolidge's Crystal Texts would be rocks?

#1: DUDE -- Calm down.

#3: You just made me say "dude"! I never say dude. Do you understand the implications of making me say dude?!

Okay, seriously, I'm not sufficiently well-versed in political theory--have not, sadly, read my Laclau and Mouffe, for instance, but I suppose, however non-radically democratic it may or may not be of me, that I do hold to the classical liberal doctrine that proposes the necessity of tolerating such despicable things as gay republicans and soldiers who want to "fiyt fer freedom" (I'm from Ky, I can say that). "Tolerating" them insofar as you do not attempt to legislate them out of existence (though would it were so...). When you say that queers should not be allowed to serve in the military, you sound like the fascist (no, I did not just say that you are one); they just seem ignorant and duped by a dominant ideology that I certainly believe would better be fought otherwise than by supporting its homophobic/heterosexist dimension. And have you even considered the element of class and our public educational system that is absolutely central to the question of how any given pers
on comes
 to join the military (as a last-last resort, for many)/support of militarism? NO, I don't know you and perhaps you have considered this, but you haven't here so I AM asking--I can only go on what you present in your own posts. The onus is on you; if you don't want people to think you're single-minded about an issue, don't speak single-mindedly about it in a public forum.

I also think the issue of self-identified,GLBTQs serving in the military is another issue altogether from whether or not our military should be in Iraq and whether or not we should even have a military at all, etc. It must be taken as a logical given that there is--not should or shouldn't be (a separate issue)--a military and, given that there is, I certainly believe that no person able and willing to serve should be prohibited from doing so on the basis of e.g., sex/gender or religion. Attacking people who do serve or would like to as monsters or murderers--however true you believe it to be--is a rhetorically counterproductive strategy that will only fuel their "patriotism" or whatnot. Perhaps you know this and were only venting on this list. Fine. Though the belief itself does seem somewhat short-sighted and simplistic to me, honestly. It seems as much an a- or un- ethical appropriation/projection/deflation of the Other, of others, as in the worst cases of the "Us and Them"
 mentality that enables and even engenders such violence in the first place. If you fight fire with fire you'll just burn the whole fucking place down.

I think the analogy holds with literary censorship. Today, you say queers can't serve in the military; tomorrow, someone else rises to power and extends this to suffrage, government-funded programs ranging from student financial aid to medicare, etc. This is a simple argument, but I think it holds. It's all fine and well as long as you're getting your way, but what happens when someone you don't like starts geting theirs? This is why there have to be certain structural safeguards against the whims of any individual who may come to power. Just what makes you think banning queers from the military would make those that wanted to join any less militaristic or republican, anyway? Taboos have that wonderful way of engendering desire...

I find it as disheartening and unbelievable as you that ANYBODY (why are you stuck and restricted to thinking this issue only in terms of queers?) would want to join the military, but I don't think your support of the republican ban on homosexuals in the military is a productive position. I don't think attempts to make change to a militaristic society should be couched in such militaristic terms as "We need to be our own fucking army" either. And who, exactly, is this "we" that claims "our" army? I thought every intellectual queer had read her Butler by now. Again, I do share your frustration over the phenomenon.

Oh--and of course I know the difference between "a" and "the"; I don't have your exact wording before me, but your plea had all the passion of someone who really feels isolated in their position. Your response, which I think you meant in all seriousness, though I could certainly be wrong, is not only inordinately condescending and bitchy but makes you look ridiculously childish and defensive. Who is it, exactly, that you're fighting? Anyone who doesn't agree exactly with you? Ideologue is just another word for fascist, sweetie.

I do think it would be great for you to write a cultural critique of the visual and verbal rhetoric of those ads and posters; certainly there should be such critique "from within." I hope ranting about it on this list with far less intellectual rigor or clarity than I'm sure you'd exhibit in a less casual piece of writing has helped you vent. That's not meant to be a slam or flame. I'm all for venting. If you want to further pursue it, though, I'd go for a more productive sublimation over the venting rant and write a poem or essay. Maybe you already have. Do you still have any of those images? You should use them! E-mail me a copy when it's finished.

Best,

Tod

Michael Todd,first, your saying, "you are of course not the only queer tostand against war and the imperialism" is said as thoughI said I was "The queer" when in fact I said "A queer against war."You do understand that, right?  "A" not "The"  ???Second, to say that I "should try investigating the machinationsof these enabling psycho-social dynamics and how,possibly, to subvert them" is your way of saying that I do not.You really don't know me to make such a claim on me,but if you would like to get to know me, that's another story.But back to the original argument, queers havea HUGE fucking history of shaking this country to the core!Queers marched in Selma, and were VERY much OUT againstthe Vietnam war.  Yes there are many of us now who are opposedto this war in Iraq, but my point is that the queer "community" asa whole has shifted focus to whimper the "Let Him Serve" phraseover and over and fucking over and over!The pace has picked up since Memorial Day, all the queer mediaw
ith
 their RIDICULOUS ads of sad men in uniform, that Fire Islandkind of romance in the air, his boyfriend standing behind him withhand on shoulder.  oh Brother it makes me sick!  OOOO, how  handsomehe is in his uniform!  Whatever!  He's a fucking killer,  period!And actually Michael, NO i do not agree that we get to be fascists,anymore than Jews get to be, or Germans, or anyone else!  NO way  man,that's fucking bullshit!  I'm NOT about to agree with you!   That's suchbullshit right out of the mouth of HRC.  The fucking Human Rights  Campaignhas a fucking Republican scumbag heading it now, and NO to that too!I'm NOT interested in tolerating Gay Republicans, ever!I say NO to letting queers into the army!  EVER!  We need to be  our ownfucking army and STOP this fucking war in Iraq and the war against  thepoor everywhere (like right down the street).CAConrad_http://PhillySound.blogspot.com_ (http://phillysound.blogspot.com/)"Art,  instead of being an object made by one person, is a
 processset into  motion by a group of people. Art's socialized."--John Cage,  1967


There's the mute probability of a reciprocal lack of understanding.

The Apt Word


To write modernism is to write in voiceless voice.
To write in voiceless voice is an enunciation.
The enunciated is always pronounced.
This is based on the apt word.
Whatever I write, there is the apt word.
In terms of cleverness, the reader desires this, the apt word.
The apt word makes one famous, i.e. on the road to fame.
Apt may be an apt word.
Writing this style is always a well-honed craft.
I try to procure your agreement or perhaps disagreement.
My taste is apparent on the page.
I am an expert in the use of words and their exactitude.
More specifically, the apt words.
Every phrase, every poem, is a composition.
The poet works hard at the composition, every word must fit.
The fit word is the apt word, both harmonious and perfect.
A poet claws its way to the apt word and beyond.
There is light on the other side of the apt word.
The apt word must not appear contrived.
Or it must appear contrived as a collusion between reader and writer.
The apt word must be secretly clever.
Or it must appear clever as such a collusion.
It's nature, the apt word, unnoticed but graces a reputation.
The audience knows the poet by the apt word.
Every poet has a different approach to the apt word.
And every poet has a different approach to the rest of it.
But it is all carefully crafted and that is why we care about poets.
And it is beautifully written and full of surprises.
And that is why we care about poetry.
I am serious about this, this apt word.
It is a well-turned phrase that contributes to the whole.
In a sense it is the whole.
Love language, love the apt, advertising and poetry pick and choose.
Here I am writing, searching for the perfect form.
Oh there must be more to this than that, there is not.
My words are perhaps not apt enough.
My turns of phrase...

in the near future you will hear new sounds
they are coming from the ghosts hovering near the old covered bridge
cows on the hill turned their backs on us
early the electricity failed in large parts of the region
there were violent thunderstorms and near the house, a crackle
the crackle continued at regular intervals
interspersed were the moans, they were murmuring to us
few of them as something jostled for our attention
moan, crackle, moan, crackle, crackle, sometimes a sheet of sound
haunted they were, these hills
haunted the bridge, haunted the dismal brook
haunted the bullfrogs speaking and hearing the moans
hearing the moans by the side of the pond
we were radio radio radio by the side of the pond
we were hearing the moans, we were listening
the radio, we were listening, the aerial and the recording
we were radio radio radio
and the recording of it, the sounds, sooner or later on this site
of the haunting, something moving through the bridge
something there and moving, we were sure of it

Hand-written insert into

A Pocket Dictionary (Chinese-English) and Pekingese Syllabary by Chauncey
Goodrich, Shanghai: Kwang Hsuel Publishing House: 1933, representing the
214 radicals in a prose composition:

One down points to the left bent barb, two above men. Man enters eight
limits to cover the icy bench over the box of knives strong. He wraps a
ladle in a box and conceals it with ten diviners with joints under the
cliff with selfish right. At the third mouth of the enclosure the earth
scholar follows moving slowly till evening a big woman son. Under the roof
she inches along like a small lame corpse to get sprouts from the mountain
streams by work for her self. He gets thirty caps and shields for his
immaturity needs covering then move on till she gives him a bow, dart, a
boar's head, a plumage. Steps away for her heart like a spear from a
window a hand with branch strikes like an elegant bushel of axes. Squares
without sun she speaks under the moon of the wood still owing and asks him
to stop killing viciously. So he denies and compares his hair, name,
breath, fire, and the claws his father crosse. At from his coach he slices
like the tooth of an ox or a dog and the black jade melons on the tile so
sweet. We produce use things from the field with a cloth roll to keep off
disease as back to back with white skin we dish them before our eyes.
Lamas and darts on the stone reveal footprints grain the cave as set up
with bamboo rice. Silk threads of pottery are in a net of goat's feathers
of one who is old and yet able to plow with ears like pencils. In his
flesh the statesman from his arrival at the mortar with his tongue opposed
the boat of defiant color. In grasses a tiger and insects draw blood to do
up the clothes from the West with the sights of horned words. In the
bitter time of walking from the city with a winejar, each separate mile
near gold pieces (from the long) doors. When the mound is reached,
short tailed birds are in the rain on the green with wrong faces of
rawhide, leather, and leeks. At the sound of book leaves in the wind they
fly to eat the heads of the fragrant horses with bones on high. My hair
strives with the herbs and I offer to the vase of spirits, fish, birds
from the saltland, dear and wheat. Hemp strings and yellow millets, black
embroidery, toads, tripods, drums, and rats, noses. Even the front teeth of
dragons, tortoises, flutes.

unusual formation of rhomboid virga

= this is a straightforward (increased contrast) photograph of virga from
a stormfront in Omaha, Nebraska - the first and only time I've seen a
rhomboid formation - the evaporating rain moving in two planes that, from
the viewpoint of the observer, are practically at right-angles -

anomalous events within a morgantown recording
very low frequency there are spherics and others
near a covered bridge of which i have already spoken
a farmhouse in the distance

http://www.asondheim.org/mgnanoml.mp3

the timing clicks were also recorded
they are regular but editing changes repetition
at the end i have left the clicks as is
they are not on the second

the moans i have already spoken of
are these the ghosts of the dead
i am certain these are the ghosts of the dead


=



only the good die young
the bad are left to grow old and rot
i am rotting

old people should be killed
they're in the way
they're useless

their flesh tastes bad
they're shapeless skin and bones
or layers of ugly fat

their minds are dead
their minds are waiting
for their bodies to catch up

old men are our past
the young are our future
grandmothers = carriers of wisdom

cart them off
cart them all off
they burn fast in the furnaces

the eskimo left them on the ice
the jews buried them alive
the christians yoked them

buddhists trample their necks
confucians spit on their altars
the muslims cut off their heads

believe what you want
someone cut off their heads
someone trampled them

old people have nothing to say
their ideas are like deSotos
that's a car we all used to drive

take their cars and belongings
divide them up take them apart
memories are made for crashing

look at the old man
push him down the hill
he can't think when he's falling

he can't think when he's standing
when he's standing he's falling
he's always falling when he's standing

i wake up and hope you'll kill me
i'm useless and can't think a thought
or this is the thought i think

when i'm permitted to think
when you've maybe read this far

i'll leave this line alone

My answers regarding my murder trial in regards to the death of James
Abbot, March 12, 1963.

Yes, sure about that, yes indeed, no, i wasn't there, it might have been,
i don't remember, all right, i did it, no, never again, not at all, yes i
bludgeoned the guy, no, no, heh, absolutely not, not a word of it,
unbelievable, could be, couldn't be, at one in the afternoon, i ate out
that night, i was alone, no one saw me, i chopped his head off with a meat
ax, i didn't do anything, how could you possibly believe that, this trial
is fixed, i ate his brains out, no, i'm completely innocent, i'm clean as
a new-born baby, pure as that virgin i fucked before i blew her head off,
i wouldn't hurt a fly, i never knew James Abbot, i never saw James Abbot,
why would i hurt him, i cut his heart out, the children are buried in a
big pit, yes they are, i've ever committed a crime, i haven't hurt anyone,
i couldn't harm a human being, no, no, yes, yes, yes, i'm sorry, i'll just
answer the questions, i have a happy life, why would i do anything to
destroy it, yes, i was lunchtime, i was with some friends, i don't
remember who exactly, most of them are dead now, i went to bed early, i
watched some tv, no, i don't remember the shows, yes, yes, no, yes yes

On March 14, 1963, i was acquitted of the murder of James Abbot.

an absolute burst or vertical signal in the for of + within an otherwise
quiescent mode. 0/1 or Kronecker delta?

onset and damping 0; at x = y of infinite +/-? this doesn't matter; give
it the prominence of a spike.

what happens to energy at a well-defined frequency? close in and quantum
effects appear.

the spike is a trigger. what is the response time?

the speed, not the half-life, of particle decay?

dear mathematical physicist, you see I do not know what I am talking
about. I am only certain that this spike plays a role in the phenomenology
of the analogic and digital.

analogic as adjectival; digital the same, as discrete, binary. or such of
the discrete that has a modus operandi as binary.

consider the factory or configuration of the digital, its appearance as
governing artifacture at a particular moment in civilization - when it is
realized that the analogic may be _scanned._

but the digital is not always constructed, as the collapse of the wave
equation implies. or rather it is always constructed - always an _action_
- but not necessarily an artifacture or technological production - which
have teleology in mind.

what are the nature/s of the spikes in very low frequency radio for
example? is the (natural) digital always the result of a _collapse_?

these (naive) questions are on the tip of the tongue, so to speak - an
array.

and dear mathematical physicist, i hope you will be able to listen to the
musings of an unaffiliated artist / theorist, who is trying to get it
right, but may not always succeed.


analogic smear

postulate the analogical from the position of the operations of the
analogical. i talked about, apologizing all the while for exhaustion, the
relation of the analogical to deep identity, identity all the way damental
ontologies and their relationship to the analogical and identity real, the
truth is messy, noisy, analogic, irreducible, fuzzy. as listerv. this
analogical labelling is superficial consider the analog is atemporal and
time is analogical substructure integral the body analogical body is
digital substructure substructure digital is body analogical body the
integral substructure to analogical print differential biological material
raster is the analog is atemporal and time is analogical time. this
continuous world appears analogic. any element of the analogic real is
interconnected and inseparable. the inherent. the application of truth
values is digital. the analogic is a membrane. the analogic is dirty,
inseparable, unbreakable. the dirty analogic problematizes its symbolic.
the clean digital is the digital object is analogic. the analogic
representation is digital. ghosts are embedded within the analogic. ghosts
are excluded from the the analogic. to erase a distinction is to corrode
it, to sublimate it to the analogic analogic. the creation of a signifier
re-inscribes the signified image of the image is analogic. within the
analogic real there is always room for error. "one can reverse this, in a
sense, considering the application of analogic analogic, it might be a
fairly useless exercise. as stimulate a vigorous debate on the
relationship of digital and analogic the other. to stay with the filter is
to remain analogic, deeply human, (dis)interested observer but from that a
music producer. the analogic is note towards a foundational phenomenology
of analogic/discrete 'domains.' ving the analogic and discrete (digital),
we will get nowhere. where the digital exists under the aegis of
fabrication, and the analogic tends towards sharpening and the analogic
the physical world collapses ( and it's in codework that the mix of
analogic and discrete 'ordering,' gestalt is both surplus and reduction.
the inhabiting of text is analogic, assurance of purity. beyond that,
there is nothing but plasma analogic, one integrates the digital to arrive
at the analogic, but to begin with the analogic? to differentiate it? this
might map, but then there is still perhaps i bring in libido (dionysian,
analogic) and superego (apollonian, she smears to decomposing doll, the
heart rate monitor freezes and she is sounds ! one who is clad in the hide

forgotten mode of hacking

http://www.asondheim.org/
- go to radio jpgs -

from a 1922-1924 book on radio, the illustrations
indicate that 'hacking' existed at least as early as
1920-21 - in relation to radio. the structures are
similar - 'generation gap,' ad-hoc innovation,
networking (there is a picture of an eleven-year-old
teaching others; there are also prizes for the most
innovative radio etc.), probing the radio spectrum as
a form of exploration (and the spectrum as 'place'),
free distribution of knowledge, etc. this is one of
several books I've seen describing the 'boys' (and to
some extent girls - Dorothea and Alice Hanna
construct their own radio as well).

given this, I wonder what other early technological
communications 'hacking' existed - were 'boys'
working with telegraphy for example? and for that
matter, when did car mods begin?

- in the higher elevations of the Wasatch Mountains near Salt Lake City
- modified recording, you need earphone and stereo for this one
- you can hear the wind whistling around the antenna
- setting up current in the antenna
- recorded by the vlf along with the usual signals
- there are the unusual usual moans as well
- sometimes i think these are stemming from the antenna
- but then i think not, they have no relation to the wind or weather
- your guess is as good as mine, probably better
- chorus adds separation, you need good separation
- machine turning on and off, i think, as rampant development continues
- we were near some ski resorts, not sky resorts
- listen, be informed -

Six of 24 artist interfaces:


>>>URL:  http://www.secrettechnology.com/resident/cath.htm  <<<


New House Images/Textual excursions by Catherine Daly.
Moving deer in the dusk by Jason Nelson.

Where was I?:
While running an extra help session for my Digital Production course,
I propped my
laptop on a spare chair in the computer lab and created in those spar
moments
between answering questions about tech whatnots. My students, I fear,
have eyes
bigger than their mouths. They so dearly want the technology to
magically satisfy their
whims, their creative possibilities. Much like the Catherine's house
in these pcitures, or
within her poetic text, we must work within certain frameworks. And
uneasy colloboration
between the masonry and our ability to crush stone and align
foundations.


Residency description:

Exploring interface and interactive creatures with content grabbed,
thrust, stolen, and borrowed  from new media artists, poets and
electronic pioneers. Over these 2-3 weeks, I will create twenty-four
digital extravaganzas, with each one being loosely or closely centered
on the content, ideas, images and words of others. Think of this as
ego stroking and translation, a way to connect to those I have never
met and might not ever meet, and play with ideas of interaction and
interface. Some have offered their content, others will simply be
robbed, and all will be enchanted, confused, annoyed and giddily
stroked.

Bio:
"As a NET ARTIST, I am apparently diying or dead. With that in mind, I
bask in my zombie glow, my rotting wires and my urge to bite through
skulls.  I could list those academic and worldly accolades that have
trophied themselves on my work, but I am only as good as the last
swirling mess I spit out. I live in Australia with a beautiful woman
and miss the snow, so miss the snow."

Hi all,

Season two of our "d.a. levy lives: celebrating the renegade press" series
concludes next month, and the Thurs. July 7 date has recently opened up. If
you edit a non-NY based small press, or know of a press you think might be
interested, please backchannel me asap as the time is growing near.

The series is held at Chelsea's ACA Galleries, which is owned by the
son-in-law and daughter of the poet Simon Perchik. The first thursday of
each month i have a different visiting press host and feature their authors
and, if they're able, musician(s) they know, or i find some musicians I
know. The gallery provides wine and other beverages, and cheese and fruit.

We started the series in august 2004. in our first two seasons we've hosted
(or are due to host the final press listed) Meritage Press (San
Francisco/St. Helena, Calif.), The Owl Press (Woodacre, Calif.), Tougher
Disguises (Oakland, Calif.), Cy Press (Cincinnati, Ohio), above/ground press
(Ottawa, Canada), a 20th anniversary party for Chax Press (Tucson, Arizona),
The Tangent (Walla Walla, WA), Carve magazine (Ithaca, NY), and Braincase
Press (Northampton, Mass.), Combo (Providence, R.I.), Talonbooks (Vancouver,
Canada), Tripwire (San Francisco), Conundrum (Chicago), Ambit (Baltimore), a
30th anniversary party for Kelsey Street Press (Berkeley, Calif.), The Poker
(Cambridge, Mass.), Ahadada Books (Burlington, Canada), Firewheel
Editions/Sentence, a magazine (Danbury, Conn.), Habernicht Press (San
Francisco), The Canary (Kemah, Texas), Duration Press (San Rafael, Calif.),
and a+bend press (Davis, Calif.).

best,
david

Weiner on the origin of Weeks:
"My friend, the writer Barbara Rosenthal, gave me a page-a-day diary
last Christmas to encourage me to write. Not seeing words anymore, I
looked for another source. I found it in the TV news, which accounts
for the bulk of the material. I typed it up week by week, which
accounts for the title."

from "Weak Links," Bernstein's introduction:
"Weeks, in its extremity, represents the institutionalization of
collage into a form of evenly hovering emptiness that actively resists
analysis or puncturing. In Weeks, the virus of news is shown up as a
pattern of reiteration and displacement, tale without teller . . .
Weiner's Weeks is a shocking cul de sac to a tradition of the found in
American poetry -- a tradition that includes, by any brief accounting,
Charles Reznikoff's Testimony, Sterling Brown's ethnographic
encounters with the black oral tradition, William Burroughs' cut-ups,
Jack Spicer's 'received' poems, Jackson MacLow's processing of source
material, or Ronald Johnson's erasure of Milton in radi os"

Hi,

I'm wondering if anyone can help me with some critical texts on the
content/form division? I'm assuming that we get it from the mind/body
division and Aristotle's lexis/logos dichotomy, but I'm interested in
reading critiques, defenses and histories of it. Please backchannel to
kensanwaychen[at]gmail.com

Thanks,
Ken Chen

ken (tech #830816) of telus has informed me today that it is a
possibility that bc and victoria indy media have decided to ban all
telus ip adresses from their site which this behavior would fall under
further dirty tricks by certain victoria and indy media admins who wish
to limit access to this public site and limit the flow of information.
the lack or response or concern by bc and vic indy media admins
concerning this issue might make clear that perhaps it has been an
attempt to target an individual or people, such as those who post
articles or have sympathies concerning muslim, black, native and pro
palestinian issues and those the object and expose local police
brutality -- using dirty tricks.

as of 9:49pm

steve rabouin of telus has confirmed that it is in fact that it is bc
and victoria indymedia who are banning telus IPs from their site.

dirty tricks if full effect

 >>PUB: call for submissions from arab-american poets
===============================================

Call For Submissions: Anthology of Contemporary Arab American Poetry
The following is a call for submissions from Hayan Charara:
I am compiling an anthology of contemporary Arab-American poetry that a
major university press has expressed interest in publishing. The
anthology is intended to be a comprehensive collection of Arab-American
poetry.

To be considered for inclusion in the anthology, contributors and
contributions must meet two criteria: (1) Contributors must be of Arab
descent, and (2) original poems must be written in English, i.e., no
translations.

"Arab-American" themes or subject matter are welcomed but not required.
Previously published material is preferred.

While I have many poetry collections written by Arab-American poets, I
do not have all of them. Please consider sending books (photocopies or
printed manuscripts are welcomed) so that I have a complete and
up-to-date sampling of your work. Email submissions are accepted, but
hard copies are preferred. Any books sent will be returned if requested
(please include SASE with sufficient postage). Otherwise, submissions
will not be returned--please do not send your only copy.

The press would like to see a manuscript of the anthology in the fall.
To accommodate this, and to ensure a top-notch manuscript, deadline for
submission is to September 15, 2005.

Inquires and/or email submissions should be sent to:

<hayan.charara@scbglobal.net>

Hard copy submissions should be sent to:

Hayan Charara
Editor, Anthology of Contemporary Arab American Poetry
4905 Avenue G
Austin, TX 78751

Remember to include a SASE for reply.

Finally, please pass this message on to anyone who may be interested or
may be able to spread the word. Thanks.

Subject:      The Arab in Me - Italian Derivatives of Arabic
Content-Disposition: inline
Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="iso-8859-1"
MIME-Version: 1.0

Strange thing about Arab anscestry: I was watching an Arab film (honestly I=
 can't remember the title, but it had to do with this woman who was, OH! it=
's called Bedouin Hacker... [SP?]) and there was a note (from the moderator=
 who was showing the film, at the University here (Towson) in which she sai=
d the word for slippers, in Arabic, is "baboosh". Now, I grew up speaking a=
 very drawl-driven Italian dialect from Bari (Palo del Colle is the town my=
 mother is, so we speak "da Pal'" or "paloise" but not necessarily "Barez" =
and the word we use for slippers is also "baboosh". Now, I knew we had Gree=
k and Slavic influences in my family (regional, the Slavs were just across =
the adriatic, I think Albanian mostly 'cause they'd come over to work in Pu=
glia) but Arabic? This is a shocking and delightful surprise; I always knew=
 I was %100 Italian but what does that mean? Of course it's nationalisitic =
of me to pronouce a purity of ethnicity - Italian - but all the surrounding=
 influences are now just coming out, just by the words in the language. Ano=
ther example of appropriation: my grendparents and some of my aunts and unc=
les moved to the USA for a few years and they picked up some American words=
 which they "Italianized". One of my favorites was, and this is phonetic, "=
Bockouse". Now, the strange etymology of the word (I believe only my immedi=
ate family, that it, anyone derived from my Grandparents and their children=
 and children's children plus cousins and such, use the word): when my Gran=
dparents moved to Brooklyn, NY they lived in an apartment where there was n=
o bathroom in the building, so they had to use an outhouse, or "backhouse",=
 and this eventually became "bockouse". I still notice a lot of family inte=
rtwining Italian and English, especially slang terms like "OK" and "Sure (S=
ho)". So, I'd like to say, just by the use of "baboosh" and perhaps there a=
re other words I'm not too familiar with, their etymology at least, that I'=
m pretty sure we have family, perhaps distant, who have Arab blood, which m=
akes me a bit of the Arab, I don't know how much, probably a tiny bit, but =
I do know that the evolution of the dialect is pretty fast, I mean, within =
three generations the dialect will sound so different from it's former that=
 I'll make a bet that those living 100 years apart have a difficult time un=
derstanding each other. I'm assuming with the on-set of the industrial revo=
lution, and Bari being a port city, a number of influences have to have ent=
ered the culture, and I am finally understanding the implications of this i=
nfluence. Now I understand that dialects are different from the mother tong=
ue, but here's a great example of nonsense dialect in action!

If I want to say "Let's go" in Italian we say "andiamo" but in the dialect =
we say "shamanin da doe", again, phonetic, but that's not even close!=20

Also, is there a rural French dialect that is almost completely different t=
han the mother tongue? I also notice, in films using a very hard rural Fren=
ch dialect, a distinction in words that are similar to my dialect. Perhaps =
the cross polination of cultures can be found in the languages, and this mi=
ght help me find out who exactly my anscestors could have been. Anyone care=
 to share examples, possibly point me in the direction of some scholarship =
on the language problem?

If anyone would like to share some language problems with me, especially in=
 talking with me about the dialect, if there is some possibility that I can=
 throw some phrases out at folks and perhaps they might notice some, at lea=
st phonetic similarities, this would be a breakthrough.

Does anyone have any insight into my case?=20

Yours,
Christophe Casamassima

that's an eerily imperialistic imposition -- what of first-generation =20=

Arab-Americans who still want to or can only work in their native =20
tongues? Or, for that matter anyone of whatever generation of Arabic =20
descent who wants to write (for whatever reason, & there can be many =20
((for example the poltical decision not to or no longer to write in =20
the invader's language))!) in a language other than "English" (why =20
not call it "American" to begin with?)

A disastrous requirement, in fact, from a political cultural =20
perspective.

I know this would be a discussion too in-depth to front-post all the info Ken
will receive backchannel, on the other hand, one of the reasons I signed up
for this listserv was to learn and discuss the deeper elements of poetics.
I've been somewhat disappointed to find primarily event announcements and
personal slams tossed around.  If this could be the beginning of a learning
experience for all of us, a poetic interchange, I think Ken poses a profitable inquiry
and underscores the stated purpose of the listserv: "to support, inform, and
extend those directions in poetry that are committed to innovations,
renovations and investigations of form and/or content" etc.

Would love to see this discussion extended for list perusal.

I was just kidding about the whole writing thing.=20

I'm not writing a damn word this summer.=20

My mother's birthday is in a week and a half.

And I no longer know what it means to have a national identity.

Just when I thought I was on the verge of "Going Home" i.e. finding my root=
s, I find that they're entwined with the neighbor's tree. Sarajevo, or "Sar=
acevo" as my father told me,those are new roots to me. Then he says "Arabia=
", I told him that (look at my last posting) but he confirmed it.

Mutt, damnit. Pure mutt. I've regressed from purity of body, blood.=20

If I sound like a fascist, I'm only trying to get in touch with my deeper s=
elf.

Charles, back channel me. I have very important information concerning the =
state of the heart.

I remember this tradition from my first time on the list years and years
ago. I also remember wondering "who has the time?" But I wanted to stir
the pot this time and ask two more pointed questions:

1. What is the role of the classics in a Summer reading list? Are we
supposed to have already read everyone of importance and not who died
before 1950?

One gets the sense that a certain section of poets go to the classics a
little like the whalers in Moby Dick (which, natch, I'm in the middle of
right now.) You go out into the open seas, track down a dangerous
leviathan, and put the oil into barrells to take home to Nantucket.

Which means that same section do not *live* with the classics, but rather
treat them as weirdo sources of poetic inspiration, a kind of rare but
important oil. We're meant to live with our contemporaries, to share their
writing lives, but the old boys and girls are sort of dead to us.

Meanwhile, there's the opposite extreme. I'm thinking of someone like
Geoffery Hill.

2. I get the sense from reading, e.g., Ron's blog, or looking around at
these reading lists, that the goal is to read some huge amount of work --
to "keep afloat." I fear the man of one book. Whatever happened to
concentrated reading? Will anyone produce a reading list one item long?

I'm in the middle of reading the first issue of LANGUAGE, which I
downloaded off a Princeton website. It's far, far more exciting than I
expected. Since I write my blog, I keep up with the journals that are
coming out, and I haven't come across anything as dynamic -- this weird
kind of mixture of creative and critical thinking, merged without any kind
of pretention...

Oh, Juliana Spahr's lungs book is totally fantastic, and everyone should
read it.

It needs more than volunteers.
It needs a r[d]e-tranterizing of history.
It needs to stop living in the romantic generation of '68 fantasy and =
see
the whole australian poetry culture.
It needs independent editorial and direction.
It needs audio and the inclusion of performance poets, past present and
future.
It needs youth.

Charles, a couple "summer reading" posts back, recommended Meredith
Quartermain's new, totally intriguing, Meredith Quartermain's book,
Vancouver Walking (NeWest). I suggest it works well as a good counterpoint
to Lisa Robertson's, "Occasional Work and Seven Walks from the Office for
Soft Architecture" (Clear Cut Press). A series that also finds theoretical
and specific home in Vancouver environs. Both are interesting in terms of
extending the Vancouver "school" tradition of looking closely into the
matrix of City, of whose very good writers include George Stanley, Brain
Fawcett,Daphne Marlatt among no doubt others
With Robertson - tho one might pull hair over the high glib tone (voice) - =
I
was reading out loud in the kitchen once to my partner the esteemed
photography curator who began to lift the kitchen pot in my direction as a =
I
read her aloud the essay on Eugene Atget - oh well, with Robertson, I had
begun to say, we begin to get a much wanted weave (for me) of multiple
mediums (photograph, theory, language, etc.) under and overlay of approache=
s
to encountering, negotiation and building upon urban space. Meredith's
intense factuality and historical sense - and the process of walking and
living within the space - counterfoils Robertson's imaginative and
theoretical throne - somehow the two books feed each other. Ah, read them!

Of course W Benjamin, Reznikoff, Patterson (WCW), Watten (Detroit) and
Joseph Cornell are always breathing - even battling - under the thick of
this. Hope somebody is writing a big City poets, painters, etc. book
(thesis) readable somewhere!

HI Bill,
 I took a medieval theology course years ago and we had to read that. Mind
blowing. All of that stuff is mind blowing. Henry Suso, Beatrice of
Nazarath, Marguerite Porete. Helps the Heidegger go down too.

You might be also interested in:

I bought a copy at Talking Leaves in Buff many years ago.

As for summer reading and the classics. I've been picking away at E.P.
Thompson's Making of the English Working Class for years. A coupel of
chapters turns me onto enough people, places and things to keep me busy
for a while.

cheers,
kevin

Jonathan Skinner was born in Santa Fe, New Mexico in 1967 and has lived in
Mexico, England, Italy, France and, most recently, New York State. Skinner is
the author of _Political Cactus Poems_ (Palm Press, 2005) and edits the review
_ecopoetics_ in Buffalo, NY, where he curated the Steel Bar reading series and
where he continues to misidentify birds along the Niagara River. He teaches at
the State University of New York and in the Buffalo public schools.

About _Political Cactus Poems_, Juliana Spahr writes "Jonathan Skinner with
his journal _ecopoetics_ has been showing us how it is all connected, all
systemic, all wonderful even while at risk. The poems in _Political Cactus
Poems_ do similar work as they tell the sad stories of contemporary politics
(Milosevic and Bush show up at various moments) with the specific stories of
various cacti. These poems direct and redirect our attention to the larger
ethical issues of political and natural environments. They are tight, luminous
poems that illustrate how the world is more complicated than most of us
acknowledge."

How long can Bush filibuster on this one? One does, if one is required to b=

Anti-Christ. Is it true the Dutch are making serious plans to move the City

G8 scientists tell Bush: Act now =FA or else...
An unprecedented warning as global warming worsens
By Steve Connor, Science Editor

08 June 2005


An unprecedented joint statement issued by the leading scientific academies
of the world has called on the G8 governments to take urgent action to aver=
t
a global catastrophe caused by climate change.

The national academies of science for all the G8 countries, along with thos=
e
of Brazil, India and China, have warned that governments must no longer
procrastinate on what is widely seen as the greatest danger facing humanity=
.
The statement, which has taken months to finalise, is all the more importan=
t
as it is signed by Bruce Alberts, president of the US National Academy of
Sciences, which has warned George Bush about the dangers of ignoring the
threat posed by global warming.

It was released on the day that Tony Blair met Mr Bush in Washington, where
the American President was expected to reaffirm his opposition to joining
the Kyoto treat to limit greenhouse gas emissions. Over dinner at the White
House last night, Mr Blair appeared to make little progress on one of his
main priorities for Britain's year chairing the G8 - a new international
effort to combat climate change. The Prime Minister is trying to draw the
US, China and India into the discussion, but there is little sign that the
Bush administration will accept the growing scientific evidence about the
problem.

Lord May of Oxford, the president of the Royal Society, Britain's national
academy of sciences, lambasted President Bush yesterday for ignoring his ow=
n
scientists by withdrawing from the Kyoto treaty. "The current US policy on
climate change is misguided. The Bush administration has consistently
refused to accept advice of the US National Academy of Sciences ... Getting
the US on board is critical because of the sheer amount of greenhouse gas
emissions they are responsible for," Lord May said.

Between 1990 and 2002, the carbon dioxide emissions of the US increased by
13 per cent, which on their own were greater than the combined cut in
emissions that will be achieved if all Kyoto countries hit their targets, h=
e
said.

"President Bush has an opportunity at Gleneagles to signal that his
administration will no longer ignore the scientific evidence and act to cut
emissions," Lord May said. "The G8 summit is an unprecedented moment in
human history. Our leaders face a stark choice - act now to tackle climate
change or let future generations face the price of their inaction.

"Never before have we faced such a global threat. And if we do not begin
effective action now it will be much harder to stop the runaway train as it
continues to gather momentum," he added.

The joint statement by the national science academies of the 11 countries
does not mention Kyoto but it does refer repeatedly to the United Nations
Framework on Climate Change that spawned the 1995 protocol to limit future
greenhouse gas emissions, which the US has signed up to.

Climate change is real, global warming is occurring and there is strong
evidence that man-made greenhouse gases are implicated in a potentially
catastrophic increase in global temperatures, the statement says. "It is
likely that most of the warming in recent decades can be attributed to huma=
n
activities. This warming has already led to changes in the Earth's climate.=
"

Human activities are causing levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere to
rise to a point not reached for at least 420,000 years. Meanwhile average
global temperatures rose by 0.6C in the 20th century and are projected to
increase by between 1.4C and 5.8C by 2100.

"The scientific understanding of climate change is now sufficiently clear t=
o
justify nations taking prompt action. It is vital that all nations identify
cost-effective steps that they can take now to contribute to substantial an=
d
long-term reduction in net global greenhouse gas emissions," the statement
says.

In a veiled reference to President Bush's reluctance to accept climate
change by claiming that the science is unclear, the academies emphasise tha=
t
action is needed now to reduce the build-up of greenhouse gases.

"A lack of full scientific certainty about some aspects of climate change i=
s
not a reason for delaying an immediate response that will, at a reasonable
cost, prevent dangerous anthropogenic [man-made] interference with the
climate system," the statement says.

"We urge all nations... to take prompt action to reduce the causes of
climate change, adapt to its impacts and ensure that the issue is included
in all relevant national and international strategies."

The national academies warn that even if greenhouse gas emissions can be
stabilised at existing levels, the climate would continue to change as it
slowly responds to the extra carbon dioxide added to the atmosphere.
"Further changes in climate are therefore unavoidable. Nations must prepare
for them," the statement says.

CO2 on the increase

1958: A US scientist, Charles Keeling, begins measuring the atmospheric
concentration of carbon dioxide (CO2 ) on an extinct volcano in Hawaii. It
stands at 315 parts per million (ppm).

1968: The US spacecraft 'Apollo 8' takes the first pictures of Earth from a
distance, beautiful but fragile - which help start modern environmentalism.
The C02 level has reached 323ppm.

1972: The UN Conference on the Human Environment in Stockholm - the moment
when the world first recognises environmental threats to the Earth as a
whole. CO2 now at 327ppm.

1988: The world wakes up to the danger of climate change, with an outspoken
warning from scientists, and a speech by Margaret Thatcher. CO2 level stand=
s
at 351ppm.

1992: The Earth Summit at Rio de Janeiro sees more than 100 countries sign
the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, the first global warming
treaty. CO2 now at 356ppm.

1995: The Kyoto protocol to the UN's climate treaty is signed in Japan,
binding countries, including the US, to make cuts in their CO2 emissions.
The CO2 level has now reached 360ppm.

2000: Obvious that the 1990s were the hottest decade in the global
temperature record, with 1998 the hottest year in the northern hemisphere
for 1,000 years. CO2 is 369ppm.

2001: George Bush withdraws the US, the world's biggest CO2 emitter, from
Kyoto, alleging it will damage America's economy - jeopardising the whole
process. CO2 level now at 371ppm.

2003: First two weeks of August are the hottest period ever recorded in
western Europe: 35,000 people die. New record high temperature for Britain.
CO2 now at 375ppm.

2004: After much dithering, Russia ratifies Kyoto, enabling the protocol to
enter into force despite the desertion of the United States. But that
doesn't stop the CO2 level rising to 377ppm.=20

(I've had to leave the italics out but this is what I'm working on au moment)


Monsieur le Directeur

I demand I desist from your service today.
What is its name je ne connais pas but let it
become Alphinor.  There is a lighthouse
that says that in my head. Rocks

to your monthly bills, your fuckface threats
of final notice, dusk. I have accompted my inventories
with the snub patience of chalk. Item:
2 tusks d'ivoire (& guns for Makonnen). Item: 5 fingers

of nibs, snotted with dried ink. Item:
a lace sheet on a Belgian postcard, lightly
penned with blood. Item: a fusillade of vowels.
Item: seven volumes, unbound, of left luggage, verbs.

I leave for Suez tomorrow. By Alphinor, in a black hull.
Item: a street dog's cough. There is something bad
sailing in my blood, no illumination lights
in nursing eyes. Tell me the time (Item) I must be

shouldered on board.


All the Best

Dave

Note: this poem is based on the last letter of Arthur Rimbaud, dictated to his sister on the eve of his death. In it the poet refers
to 'Aphinar', which may be a ship, or a place or the Arabic for lighthouse: al fanar. I have changed the word slightly. The letter
is addressed to the 'Director' of the hospital in which the poet spent his final illness, morphine soaked as the cancer spread.
Rimbaud's letter is as follows:

Item 1 tusk only Item 2 tusks Item 3 tusks Item 4 tusks Item 2 tusks

M. le Directeur
I should like to ask whether I have left anything on your account. I wish to change from this service today.
I don't even know its name, but whatever it is, let it be the Aphinar line. All those services are there all over the place and I,
crippled and unhappy, can find nothing - any dog in the street could tell you that.
Please therefore send me the tariff of services from Aphinar to Suez. I am completely paralysed, and so wish to embark in good time.
Tell me at what time I must be carried on board.

anomalous vlf

http://www.asondheim.org/antelopevlf.jpg
http://www.asondheim.org/antelope4.mp3
recorded Antelope Island, Great Salt Lake, Utah, 7 p.m.
notes:
1. at the beginning, the sound of the minidisk player is evident, in spite
of the fact no microphone is used.
2. my calling 'Azure' is distinctly audible, again in spite of the fact no
microphone is used. this calls for further investigation; somehow the
apparatus was picking up my voice, in spite of the fact it was tuned for
vlf only.
3. note at the beginning _i forgot to turn the radio itself on,_ and
therefore there was increased sensitivity with the AVC in the recorder.
this might have something to do with it.
4. even through the modification to the vlf sound itself (through modified
chorus with four voices and high feedback), the sound of footprints is
audible at the beginning - in spite of the fact that the _AVC is
desensitized at this point._ i can only conclude that the conductivity of
the ground (the unit goes to earth of course) is transformed by pressure
waves which travel outwards from walking.
5. on the other hand, there are moments _when footprints are heard and no
walking occurs._ could this be another phenomenon altogether?
6. one may hear for oneself at http://www.asondheim.org/azurevlf.mp3 .
this is of course only a very small segment of a number of recordings at
this and other Antelope Island sites.
7. one may speculate on the presence of _ghosts_ or _animals_ on one hand
(there were, of course, antelope, as well as bison, rabbits, jackrabbits,
etc. in the vicinity - see http://www.asondheim.org/antelopebison.jpg ) -
and, on the other, something in the nature of the salted air (the lake is
extremely saline and the shore is not far off) that creates the effect.
8. be that as it may, the recording on the island was the clearest and
densest to date, which is to be expected, given the unique nature of the
terrain.
9. 'we await further results with eager anticipation.'

One crucial word in English with Arabic origins is "cypher," in the sense of
zero, which in Arabic is "sif'r" (sifir). The reason is that Arabs invented
the concept of zero, a giant step in thinking.

I am sure there are many other words.

Re-visiting Florence after a period of many years, I was struck to realize
how Renaissance art is influenced by Islamic culture, particularly the Moorish
architecture. The focus on the Classical Greek sources of The Renaissance tries
to by by-pass the Islamic factor, itself influenced by Plato and Aristotle.
Until the 17th century, the Islam and Christianity were ideological, even
mortal enemies. The Ottoman had conquered Constantinople ("the ward of the Virgin
Mary") in the 15th century and had come to the gates of Vienna in the 17th.

The Mesquite Mosque in Cordoba -to me one of the greastest five or six
buildings in the world- has a church built within it (its guts) by the Spanish king
(Karlos) in a completely different style after the reconquering of the city..
The altars of the church and the mosque point to different directions. It is
an incredible experience which made me feel I was in the middle of a science
fiction punk novel.

well, that old rag is a diminutive of the Russian "baba" i.e. =20
grandmother.

while baboosh, the thing worn at the other extreme of the body, =20
though taken up by Arabic is most likely of Farsi origin.

(though I often thought of it as a Turkish work -- Murat?)

No, "baboosh" is not Turkish, so far as I know.

My parents were born and used to live in Iran (Meshed) close to the Russian=20
border. In fact my mother spent time in Tiflis (Georgia). I remember, talkin=
g=20
Persian they used Russian versions of three words, "aghoshke" (window),=20
"parahut" (boat) and "doroshke" (carriage, phaeton). When I used these words=
 talking=20
to Iranians from Teheran (in my very limited persian), they did not understa=

me or smiled knowing I was talking a Meshed lingo.=20

The Institute of International Education gave Dan Bar-On (an Israeli) and
Sami Adwan (a Palestinian) the inaugural Goldberg IIE prize. This prize is
for efforts in trying to build peace in the Middle East. A press release
from the American embassy in Tel Aviv about it is at
http://vispo.com/PRIME/goldbergprize.htm

The particular project Dan and Sami were awarded for is called "Learning
Each Other's Historical Narrative". Actually it's quite an interesting
project you might want to check out. As Sami and Dan say of it:

"This project of the Peace Research Institute in the Middle East (PRIME)
focuses on teachers and schools as the critical force over the long term for
changing deeply entrenched and increasingly polarized attitudes on both
sides of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict. The goal of the project is to
"disarm" the teaching of Middle East history in Israeli and Palestinian
classrooms."
http://vispo.com/PRIME/leohn.htm

I'm proud to host and work on Dan and Sami's site PRIME (Peace Research
Institute in the Middle East) at http://vispo.com/PRIME with my friend Sid
Tafler.

Steve,

When I spent some time as a child in a German-Polish neighborhood in
Milwaukee, we were told it was a Polish word for a scarf the old women wore.
Apparently, it's Russian and Ukrainian.

Lynda and I are just about to hit the road for Mexico, and our
cat-care deal fell through just a day or so ago. Now, we're madly
scrambling to find some folks who might extend their hospitality
to our cat Chuckie for a couple months (the trip by car is much
too long, and the house we'll be staying in doesn't welcome cats).

We'd love to hear from anyone either in the NYC/New Jersey area
or not too far from a NYC to San Antonio/Laredo/Eagle Pass sort
of trajectory who'd be so kind as to take him in. He's getting on
now (who isn't?)--about 15 or so--but is in good health and is
an amiable and witty companion who's lived well with both other
cats and with dogs.

We'd be glad to pay something for a bit of TLC, and Lynda's offering
both an original monoprint and a copy of her new book The Body Parts
Shop. I could throw in a couple books also. (Not to mention food,
cat litter, etc.)

Here's the old guy himself. Click and then scroll down one
screen.

        http://home.earthlink.net/~halvard/halandlynda.html

If you can't do it yourself, and have neighbors you'd recommend
who might, please ask them and/or make us some suggestions. Oh, hell,
forget the near trajectory. We'll go out of our way for this guy.


The Cat

In my house I want:
A reasonable woman,
A cat passing among the books,
And friends in every season,
Whom I cannot live without.

FYI: My wife and in-laws, who are from Iran, do not know of any Persian word
"baboosh" and it is not in the Persian-English dictionary we have in the
house.

My wife thinks it signifies part of a traditional costume, and my
father-in-law suggests that it comes from a dialect other than Persian.

Gnoetry does not merely create electronic cut-ups, nor does it

No one likes a kidder (margeaux) or a kidman (nicole) but=20
its been a dear challenge for me to take anyone seriously
and be taken seriously by anybone. It really is just part=20
of the experiment (see Boy, Wolf, Aesop).

It's carried over to what I believe is my poetics but do
I want to call it poetics? or poor ethics? In reality,=20
I've not ever succumbed to a feeling of alienation from
my peers (my work transcends time and space and the spirit
of intersession). Whatever that means, Greek.=20

So please be kind, rewind, sit back, and tell me your story.

Or lie to me.

(This was sent to me via the VPD Public Complaints website)

From: Terri

I like to tell you there will be a protest held this Saturday at the SE
corner of Main & Cordova at High Noon to ask Vancouver Police Department
Chief Constable Jamie Graham to resign.  Also a request for British
Columbia Solicitor General Coleman to audit the Vancouver Police
Department, as well as to bring reform to the Police Act of British
Columbia, the Vancouver Police Department and the attitude of police in
the province of British Columbia. A prayer will be said for all the Lost
Souls of the DTES, living and dead, who have suffred at the hands of the
Vancouver Police Department.

I will not be requesting anyone come as a ghost, yet I will be dressed in
a sheet. Please, feel free to come as ghost yourself.

I have never organized a protest before and have little funds, but feel
so strongly about the VPD that I cannot just sit back and pray he leaves
office, I want to actively push him out.

Thank You,

Terri

PEN CENTER USA ANNOUNCES
EMERGING VOICES ROSENTHAL FELLOWSHIPS
=20

Los Angeles (August 1, 2004) =8B PEN Center USA announces six to ten
Rosenthal
Fellowships will be available to emerging writers from minority,
immigrant
and underserved communities for the 2006 cycle of Emerging Voices, a
program
of literary mentorship. Participating writers will receive a one-time
stipend of $1,000. The stipends are made possible by the Richard and
Hinda
Rosenthal Foundation, which supports outstanding work from
not-yet-established writers and artists.

 Designed to serve writers working on a specific project who are ready
to be
published, Emerging Voices is an intensive, eight-month program based in
Los
Angeles that includes a one-on-one mentoring relationship with an
established writer, master classes and private workshops with a
prominent
author and poet, classes in the Writers=B9 Program at UCLA Extension,
informal
visits with writers and literary professionals and attending literary
readings.

The current Emerging Voices brochure and application are available
online at
http://www.penusa.org, by emailing ev@penusa.org or by sending a
self-addressed stamped envelope to Emerging Voices, PEN USA, 672 S.
Lafayette Park Pl., #42, Los Angeles, CA 90057. The deadline for
applications is September 9, 2005, and the program will begin in
January.
For more information, call PEN at (213) 365-8500.

There is no better measure of the program=B9s quality and effectiveness
than
the remarkable success of many of its past participants. Former Emerging
Voices Rosenthal Fellows have written books for Holt, MacAdam/Cage and
Simon
& Schuster, one of which was a Los Angeles Times and national
bestseller;
received fellowships from the Sundance Institute and the Virginia Center
for
the Creative Arts; received grants and awards, such as the Durfee Artist
Award, a Brody Arts grant and the Nimrod/Katherine Anne Porter Prize for
fiction; and have had works published in numerous publications. Mentors
and
instructors have included Sherman Alexie, Yusef Komunyakaa, Mona
Simpson,
Carolyn See, Bernard Cooper, Susan Taylor Chehak, Greg Sarris, Kenneth
Starrm Chris Abani, Harryette Mullen, Karen Yamashita, Maria Amparo
Escandon, Janet Fitch, Jervey Tervalon and Judith Freeman.

PEN Center USA, founded in 1943, is part of an international
organization of
professional writers created in 1921 to defend freedom of expression and
foster a vital literary community worldwide. With more than 1,200
members,
PEN USA is the third largest of 130 international PEN centers and one of
two
centers in the United States.=20

Subject:      Of Speech As of Number
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII; format=flowed

Of Speech As of Number


Number names in various languages (for example Japanese) alter in relation
to their quantified; '3 books' and '3 people' may have different words for
'3' altogether. In English, the number words are unary, however.

However, and this relates to issues of analog/digital (which I continue of
course to pursue), there are three 'speakings' of number, dependent on
use:

1. 2118 = "two thousand, one hundred and eighteen" - indicative of
_quantity._ For example: "There are two thousand, one hundred and eighteen
bison on the island." Note the comma and connective may be omitted: "There
are two thousand one hundred eighteen bison on the island." Think of this
as the _indexical._

2. 2118 - "twenty-one eighteen" - indicative of date (within a serial /
linear construct). This is number as _sign._ For example: "In the year
twenty-one eighteen, all large mammals, except for humans, will either be
extinct or corralled." Note "twenty-one eighteen" is almost never written
out as such; the usual expression would be "In the year 2118, all large
mammals, except for humans, will either be extinct or corralled." Think of
this as the _symbolic._

3. 2118 - "two one one eight" - indicative of _identification_ For
example: "I live at two one one eight Western Boulevard, near the Monument
of Extinctions." Phone numbers and other identifications (credit card,
social security) are usually spoken in this fashion. Think of this as the
_ikonic._

In ikonic identification, quantity and seriality are irrelevant. The
number is neither cardinal nor ordinal. In symbolic seriality,
identification is based on quantity, only in the sense that quantity
defines positionality; this is ordinal, not cardinal. In indexical
quantity, identification and seriality are weakened; the quantity of bison
(for the most part alone) is relevant. The number is cardinal.

I am stretching Peirce's notion of signs here. Nevertheless, there is some
hint of value on the horizon. Number trifurcates in the speaking; the
specificity of 3 portends the specificity of the discrete, for example.

What happens with decimals? Almost always, they are indicative of
quantity, although one can imagine an identification number of the form,
for example, "21.2.1.96" - which would be read "twenty-one point two point
one point ninety-six." If the form is standard, one might eliminate the
"point" as in "twenty-one two one ninety-six." If the numbers are more
than two or three digits, for example "2134.9121.1." - the most likely
speaking would be "two one three four point nine one two one point one."
Telephone numbers of the form "(718)555-1235" are of this type, with the
punctuation omitted: "seven one eight [pause] five five five [pause] one
two three five."

There are exceptions to all of these; I am concerned, however, with a
general trend, at least in one language.

Funnily enough, at an earlier stage of my thesis, I took to numbering the
chapters by giving them number-names selected from Borges' story 'Funes the
Memorious' (it was a tip of the hat towards Foucault's Order of Things).

My advisers found it easy enough to track down Luis Melian Lanifur, but with
Meat Blanket & The Railroad I ran into an unexpected problem: if my advisers
were consulting a different translation, they'd be seeing 'flesh covering'
and 'the train'.

Shadowtime is a thought opera based on the work and life of the German
philosopher, essayist, and cultural critic, Walter Benjamin. The libretto
was written by Charles Bernstein for composer Brian Ferneyhough and had its
premiere in May 2004 at the Munich Biennale. In its seven scenes,
Shadowtime explores some of the major themes of Benjamin's work, including
the intertwined natures of history, time, transience, timelessness,
language, and melancholy; the possibilities for a transformational leftist
politics; the interconnectivity of language, things, and cosmos; and the
role of dialectical materiality, aura, interpretation, and translation in
art. Beginning on the last evening of Benjamin's life, Shadowtime projects
an alternative course for what happened on that fateful night.

Opening onto a world of shades, of ghosts, of the dead, Shadowtime inhabits
a period in human history in which the light flickered and then failed.

Tess Crebbin in Music and Vision, says "Bernstein's libretto, plain and
simple, is the finest contemporary libretto that I know of."

The Shadowtime book is now available directly from the publisher, Green
Integer ($11.95plus $2 for shipping): 6022 Wilshire Boulevard, Los Angeles,
CA 90036

I look forward to the opera--though I haven't yet
heard any music by Ferneyhough.   Lincoln Center has
been picking operas that are both very intelligent and
 wonderfully musical for their summer festival.  At
last year's festival I saw "Macbeth" by Italian
composer Salvatore Sciarrino (I hope I spelled that
right--he's terrific), performed at the theater within
the John Jay School of Criminal Justice, no less--this
opera a stark presentation of horror, with voices at
the end singing "let not what has happened in the
night be dragged through the mud of signs" (i.e., let
not the events be obfuscated). (Earlier that day at
Lincoln Center I had seen Le Samauri, a classic 50's
French movie, said to be a very strong influence on
The New Wave, that aestheticized the life of of a hit
man!)

But you, Charles, brought up Robert Creeley's libretto
based on E.A. Poe's "Ligeia".  Do you, (or does anyone
else) know who was supposed to set this to music and
why it apparently never happened?  I looked up this
text and see that it was published with visual art
elements by Alex Katz--but again what about music?

BEYOND BAROQUE

JUNE 24th    /       7:30 PM





NORMAN MAILER ANNIVERSARY NIGHT



A stellar group in recitation of the poetry, prose, even stage play
dialogue  of premier American author Norman Mailer. This event
celebrating the  anniversary of a June 1969 fundraiser at the old
Cinemateque 16  moviehouse on Sunset Bv. (where Book Soup is now)
designed to raise $$ for Mailer's campaign for the mayor of New York
City. An event which featured  Jim Morrison you'll remember from THE
DOORS,  a group of Andy Warhol scenesters, the poet Jack Hirschman &
Michael C Ford.  Robby Krieger backed the words on guitar.

Since Robby & Jim will be absent for different reasons, Jason Ritter
following his father's path (as a film star (Our Very Own) a TV series
regular cast member (Joan Of Arcadia) will essay Morrison's poetry.

Backup musicians on the date will be Michael Campagna (Muddy Waters,
Chaka Khan) guitars & Cliff Hugo (The Beach Boys,  Supertramp) on
upright bass.

Since Hirschman, Ford & Krieger are just about the only participants
extant, Friday night's "re-creation" will have Jack Hirschman (Lyripol,
Fists on Fire) reading his work.

Michael C Ford (Fire Escapes, To Kiss The Blood Off Our Hands) will
reciprocate in kind.

Russ Tamblyn (7 Brides For 7 Brothers, West Side Story) will take on the
words of Norman Mailer which includes a scene from one of Mailer's plays
in which he will be joined by breakout  motion picture actress Alanna
Ubach (Meet The Fokkers).

Composer Bonnie Tamblyn will be in the singer/songwriter slot.

This even will benefit the Special Collections Library at Beyond Baroque
Foundation

Jack Hirschman will come back Saturday night to do a bonus recital of
his most recent work, Opening honors will be presented by Film-maker,
poet Philomene Long.

Hi Stephen B and Charles B.

I wd love to know abt the Creeley libretto, in part bec Steve Lacy and
Creeley came to my classes at the NEng Conservatory of Music in recent yrs
and I am even going to attempt to write something abt their collaboration &
relationship, so am interested in related matters. Have been to Bob's family
plot in Mt Auburn Cemetery 3 times; helps to have a place to go talk to him.
Am hoping to get to NY to hear yr opera, Charles B.--terrific subject and I
imagine libretto.

Best,
Ruth Lepson

Overwhelming demand compels to put up more "Sleeping With Sappho" pieces! I
hear she's not unhappy with the attention. No, she is not using a
cell-phone! Someone says that one can tell by the way "the language
bristles". I will accept that! Kindly. Go to:

A good weekend to all & thanks,

Is that Brian Ferneyhough? Time was that if a player (say, Chris Redgate,
Oboe) said he could play E over top C, Ferneyyough would score an F. That's
progress, folks.

Subject:      Creeley's Ligeia
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"; format=flowed

Bob Creeley wrote the libretto for Ligeia in 1992, prompted by a composer
then studying in Rochester. (They didn't know each other very well.) Bob
proceeded to write the libretto according to his own always considerable
lights, inspired by the Poe story. The libretto didn't turn out to be
something on which the composer wanted to work. That was OK with Bob,
though, since he was happy with his text as it was and content to imagine
some future setting.

He ends his note to the Granary edition by saying: "It was my own thoughts
that such 'music' might be complexly realized in this modest translation of
Poe's classic story to the inevitably transforming stage."

The libretto was first published in TO magazine (from Philadelphia) in the
Summer 1995 issue.

This is what is on the Granary Books web site (a few coding errors
corrected) --
http://www.granarybooks.com --

Robert Creeley and Alex Katz, Ligeia: A Libretto. New York. Granary Books.
1996. 13 1/4" x 6 1/2"; Letterpress. 135 copies. 35 hors commerce, 100 for
sale.

Originally published in 1838, Edgar Allan Poe's engaging short story Ligeia
"invites a diversity of readings and one feels confidence in making a
determination for one's own necessary uses" (Robert Creeley). Here, the
material has been translated into an operatic context, Mr. Creeley's first
libretto.

He excerpts from Poe's narrative in brief: "the narrator/hero meets the
exceptional Ligeia, is captivated by her, marries her, and becomes entirely
influenced by her commanding powers of intellect and beauty. Then she dies
harshly, resistingly. And then, after a brief time, the hero remarries, and
the cycle is almost immediately repeated without seeming resistance, which
leads to the intense conclusion, the recreation of Ligeia in the corpse of
the Lady Rowena." (from "A Note on Ligeia" by Mr. Creeley.)

Ligeia: A Libretto makes use of the emphasized pattern of Poe's narrative.
His vocabulary, rhythms and rhetorical emphasis also inform Mr. Creeley's
compositional strategy. Ultimately, however, one is left with a new and
unique work here beautifully transformed for the stage.

Alex Katz has made the set design drawing for staging and costume toward
the eventual production of Ligeia. Designed and printed by Philip Gallo.
Bound by Jill Jevne. Signed by Mr. Creeley and Mr. Katz.

ISBN: 1-887123-11-3. $500.

While nearly half way through an online residency for the London arts organization Netbehaviour, I am searching for more collaborators. Each day I create one or two net art
creations inspired by and containing content from poets, artists and other creative types. Check out the website (and text description) below for more information. But for the last few, I want to do some morphology of poets, combining multiple author content for each one. So look at what I have done so far, and drop me a note with some words or a quote or images, or short sounds, anything really.     Jason Nelson

Exploring interface and interactive creatures with content grabbed,
thrust, stolen, and borrowed  from new media artists, poets and
electronic pioneers. Over these 2-3 weeks, I will create twenty-four
digital extravaganzas, with each one being loosely or closely centered
on the content, ideas, images and words of others. Think of this as
ego stroking and translation, a way to connect to those I have never
met and might not ever meet, and play with ideas of interaction and
interface. Some have offered their content, others will simply be
robbed, and all will be enchanted, confused, annoyed and giddily
stroked.

1.
The first event in the Contemporary Reading Series, which took place last Friday, 6/3, in Lowell was a great success. Headlining the event was Ilya Kaminsky, who gave an incredible reading to an appreciative and diverse audience at the Revolving Museum in downtown Lowell. Joining Ilya were Portsmouth novelist Katie Towler, and Lowell poet Matt Miller, recent winner of the Stegner Fellowship to Stanford. I started the event reading from a book that caught Ilya's attention, Frank Stanford's The Singing Knives. The energy hit the roof and stayed there. Several people in Lowell said it was one of the overall best readings they had ever attended. A lot of books were signed. More to come--6-7 readings per year.


2.
Mass. Cultural Council Poetry Fellows to read in Northampton 6/25, 3pm

The Mass. Cultural Council awards Artist Grants in poetry every two years. Current Fellows and finalists are featured in this event, including Maria Arroyo, Kurt Eidsvig, DM Gordon, James Heflin, Michael Hoerman, Tanya Larkin, Barry Sternlieb, Margaret Szumowski, Andrew Varnon, and Sophie Wadsworth.


3.
A young Camodian immigrant who is interested in poetry and writes some himself is in the Suffolk Co. Jail awaiting trial for a serious crime. His name is Palleka Mak. He is a bright, articulate person with a hunger for learning, and a special interest in poetry. He needs books. He can receive books sent directly from publishers and from retailers such as Amazon. If you would consider sending him a book from a third-part retailer, please use the following address. The booking officer misspelled his last name (Mak) as Mack. As fucked up as it is, if his mail is not sent to the misspelling, it won't go through.

4.
This summer I will be leading a weekly poetry workshop for at risk teens at South Boston High. This will take place every Monday afternoon beginning July 11. If any poet has an interest in spending an afternoon with the kids--giving a reading and having a discussion about poetry (theirs and yours) with the kids--please drop me a line at mhoerman@partners.org. The kids in this summer program need friends and mentors.

I just wanted to put in a plug for ROVA saxophone quartet tonight
playing in San Francisco. They are presenting two amazing pieces --
first set is ROVA with two percussionists and the second set is ROVA
with about 13 other musicians. There are also four Stan Brakhage films
being screened throughout the evening. And those alone are worth the
price of admission. The films are stunningly beautiful. I'd only seen
video of the films, never the films themselves projected. There is no
comparison.

So the music and the films made for one stellar, inspiring evening last
night.

dear Michael Tod,
it may embarrass some to be told to calm down, but not me.

why calm down?  why Michael Tod?  call me dude all you  want.
in fact call me Whatever you want.  no big deal to me.

and also, what on earth are you talking about when saying that
Today we queers can't join the army and Tomorrow something
else will be taken?

you make it sound as if there was Ever a time when fags and
dykes were allowed in the military and Then it was taken away?
huh?  what sense is this?

you instruct me not only to calm down but to write a critical
paper on the matter.  what?  we're at War and you want me  to
pitter patter around with a fucking Paper?  no, no to being told
to calm down, and No to writing a paper.

and i also Completely disagree with your crap about how the
argument of letting queers into the military is a separate argument
from the war in Iraq.  no, no because we Are at war.

if they had Any sense they'd Never put a gun in my hands anyway,
because i sure as shit wouldn't be pointing it at poor folk of color
in far away lands.

there is Nothing, absolutely Nothing wrong with being Angry Pissed
Off Out Of My Fucking Mind about this war and about stupid queers
who are pissing and moaning like a bunch of stupid bitches about
NOT being able to KILL people!  it's INSANE and you Michael Tod
want me to write a fucking term paper on this shit!  No!  This  shit
needs to be Ended, and YEs ranting yelling freaking out going crazy
is a much much better way to go about it when everyone's more
involved with celebrity marriages and pregnancies than the murder
that continues day after fucking day In Our Names!  Our Tax  Dollars
Paying For Every Single Fucking Bullet and Don't Think Telling Me
To Calm Down Is Going To Make ME Ever Listen To You!  This is
madness, and so what if I'm Crazy, I can't POSSIBLY Be Crazier
Than The Fucking WarMachine in DC!!!!!!!

No apologies to you Michael Tod,
Kiss my sweet ass!

A snootful of Nootka ... pithiest language gets first dictionary

Martin Wainwright
Tuesday May 31, 2005
The Guardian

http://www.guardian.co.uk/arts/news/story/0,11711,1495759,00.html

The world's pithiest language, which combines a lavish vocabulary with
a terseness that would have made the Spartans jealous, has been cracked
for the first time by a British university project.

A debut dictionary of all known words in Nootka, the 5,000-year-old
tongue of North American tribes in an island outpost of the Rockies,
has been published by a team in Newcastle upon Tyne.

Years of interviews with some 300 surviving speakers of the language,
almost all now aged over 60, have led to 537 pages of unique and
remarkably versatile terms. Entire sentences of meaning can be crammed
into very short words.

  "There are only three basic vowels but 40 consonants and a very
complex sound structure when they are spoken," said John Stonham, of
Newcastle University, who started collecting Nootka words 20 years ago.
His dictionary also draws on the fieldwork of the linguist and
anthropologist Edward Sapir, who investigated the tribes' homeland on
Vancouver Island between 1910 and 1924.

Also known as Nuuchahnulth, which means "along the mountains" - a
reference to the speakers' homeland - Nootka's telescoping of words is
unparalleled in other languages. The range of alternatives means that a
sentence as long as "to wipe the tears from one's eyes with the back of
one's hand" is rendered simply "fib".

The 150,000 words in the dictionary are divided into 15 subgroups, each
a separate variant of the language and most with their own grammar and
pronunciation. Apart from academic interest, the drive to collect them
has been encouraged by concern that Nootka could be lost for ever
without a written record.

"I hope the dictionary will help efforts to preserve the language and
hence the culture of these societies, as language is intricately bound
up with tradition," said Dr Stonham. "There is also a very strong
desire by many of the younger people to speak their native tongue.

"Noam Chomsky said you can learn about all languages by studying just
one. This work will contribute to a better understanding of the
structure of English and many of the world's languages, not just those
of the Native Americans."

Glossary

  Nuuniiqa: To speak to someone you happen to meet

  Deehiy: Staying at home observing tribal taboos, so as not to spoil a
hunter's luck

  Kampuucis: High rubber boots (derived in part from English 'gumboot'
of 18th-century colonial settlers)

  Faafaaqsapa: Someone who has mastered Nootka

Interesting. But I bet the Nootkas would be surprised tio learn that they
live on "an island outpost of the Rockies." Of course, the Guardian is
published on an island outpost of the Alps, which might explain the confusion.

Wladyslaw Tatarkiewicz's two-volume History of Aesthetics is the best I've
found on this topic.  The section on Medieval Aesthetics is especially
useful, I think, since it chronicles the use of some markedly different
concepts and terms from what we commonly use today.

Yoshi Interview

UK hip-hop is certainly thriving at the moment, with some excellent
artists around dropping dope albums and 12”s dropping all the time. As
the UK hip-hop sound emerges and it becomes clear what the bar is, it’s
nice with a musician comes along and offers something a bit different
and alternative. Cue Brighton-based beatnik rapper-producer, Yoshi. A
man of Afghan origin, he cuts an impressive figure in his outlandish
clothing and self-assured sense of experimentation. Sampling anything
from William Shatner to John Frusciante to gardening shows, he ends up
with electronic soundscapes and interesting beats that pave the way for
his rhymes about life in Brighton and the confusion and clarity arising
from his dual heritage. Having released first album, “From a Western
Box”, Yoshi retired to the studio to create something a bit more
textured. What he ended up with was the concept album, “Flowers and
Trees” (released on 17th May). Essentially, a summery album about
childhood and naivety and belief in the cleansing powers of nature, the
hippy-ish songs take in everything from folk to dark minimal electronica
to straight-up hip-hop and Afghan rhythms. A man of such eclectic
tastes, Yoshi needed to be tracked down. So, I met him on Brighton pier,
he bought me doughnuts and we talked hip-hop, growing up and
pseudo-intellectuals.

Introduce yourself to the UKHH.COM audience, what is your mission
statement and your favourite flower? Are you some sort of hippy-hopper?

YoshiI go by the name of Yoshi. Born in Brighton, living in Brighton,
making beats and writing rhymes for 9 years or so now. As far as the
mission statement, haha, I don't really have one. I'm more of a lazy bum
poet who eases his way through different phases in life. I strive to do
something fresh each time that's the only thing I stick to. "Your music
is tomorrow’s unknown, known life. I love tomorrow" That's a quote from
a Miles Davis record and it's the only thing I keep in mind, I got it
printed out on a cheap printer and stuck just behind my mixer on the wall.

As for flowers, I don't have a favourite flower man. I just love them
all. Cherry Blossoms especially haha. I like learning flower names in
different lingos, I can say loads in Japanese, quite a few in Dari
(Afghan). I'd like to learn some in Dutch though, I think that would
sound interesting.

As for me being a "hippy-hopper" haha, yeah, I'm at this point where I'm
a bit opened, emotionally, so that's why I give off this hippy-ish vibe
that you’re talking about. I was really analytical and logical when I
was 16-18, quite anal and specific and demanding about things. Then I
think falling in love, and discovering spirituality, looking beyond what
you see, that all starts turning you in this direction of being opened.
Opening up, like a flower. So that's the process me and my hip-hop have
been going through of late. Surviving on, and living through emotions.
That's the first way I connect to something- emotionally. That's why
when I listen to people like Coldplay, I don't make fun of the simple
lyrics or look down on them like these pseudo-intellectuals or snobby
music-reviewers.


“...I can dig Chris Martin, he's not an idiot, he seems like an
intelligent guy; it's just that his lyrics are very understated, same
with Seal, I love Seal...”

Cos I can dig Chris Martin, he's not an idiot, he seems like an
intelligent guy; it's just that his lyrics are very understated, same
with Seal, I love Seal. That guy knows what he's doing. And that's what
it has become with my hip-hop lyrics, and my musical approach. I say
things that may seem obvious sometimes, or cheesy at other times, but if
you stop for a second, you'll find the depth, you'll feel how the words
can be looked at from many angles and interpreted many ways- so I like
that, cos when you feel so much inside- you don't want to go into
specifics sometimes. You can't! You need to just let it out in a raw
form. Which is probably linked to why I never really dug all these
complex, supposedly "clever" metaphors that rappers like Canibus and
Eminem used, cos it can feel contrived. The key is balance, which is
what I'm learning these days.

Tell us the concept and themes behind the album "Flowers and Trees"

YoshiMan, 'Flowers & Trees' is a little jewel of a 14-track LP I made,
which is all about childhood, positivity, the art of being creative, and
what it means to be an artist and ‘an interesting human being’ living in
this cocaine-world of boring plans and secure money. Overall it's just a
very positive album, and it was made in a spirit of childhood innocence,
and that's what it reflects. I hope. I'm a naïve dude, that's what some
people often say, which I take as a compliment. Just the other day at my
friend’s birthday party I say to my friend, "Won't it be crazy when
we're all adults sitting here at birthday parties?" And this other lady
who I'd just met started laughing at me because I said "When we're
adults" and hey, I'm basically in my mid-20's so I guess that sounds
crazy. But I said it to her just as I feel it: I don't consider me an
adult. Not in that sense. So that's the main theme of the album… taking,
or maybe keeping the essence of what made you young, tapping into it and
using it as a grown man in this world. Some things you can't keep… like
urine-soaked trousers. But there are so many things we really can learn
from these youngsters amongst us. So that's my philosophy! That's my
"mission statement" haha! My curriculum veeetie!

How successful do you think you were in your mission statement?

It's so crazy giving form and structure to the music that comes from you
without any thought of form or structure. That's what you have to do
afterwards to give it an angle. I don't want to do that though. This is
just wicked music. People seem to really like this kind of hip-hop I do,
and it sticks in your head and it's catchy, so I think it's successful
in that respect.

How do you approach production?

Well I just have ideas. In the shower I come up with loads, the chorus
and lyrics for 'When U see the future' were composed in the shower. I
jumped out and e-mailed someone I knew and told them, "this is going to
be a wicked song". Walking home at night-time I come up with a lot of
ideas too, I like to walk home early after I've met my friends… I'm
known for leaving early… because I get to walk through the busiest part
of town at the time when everyone's in the club, or on their way in, and
I'm on my way out. So that inspires good ideas and lines.


“...It's so crazy giving form and structure to the music that comes from
you without any thought of form or structure...”

Then I just get home, sit down and make the concepts in my head into
reality, and watch how they never cease to change and evolve once
they're out of my head, and how no idea or concept no matter how good it
is, will stay completely the same in your mind. John Coltrane spoke
about the same thing with regards to getting the music in his head out
into the real world of sound. But anyway, technically I use my computer,
I got a mixer, a nice mic, and a Korg Keyboard, two nice monitors and a
compressor which doesn't work right now. It's all about what you do with
it though, what's in your mind.

You talk a lot on the album about your affinity for Brighton. What are
your thoughts on the Brighton hip-hop scene?

YoshiYes man. I love this town. It's just a town to me, it's my town and
I own it. I just can't say enough about it. The beach is responsible for
so much of what I do, how I live. You know? I see inner-city kids from
London sometimes. I'll never forget these kids a few summers back. I was
playing ball on the beach when I saw them; they just went mad when they
approached the sea. It's like they'd never seen it before and they just
went wild, running around screaming with smiles on their faces they were
only like 6 or 7. Brighton's full of out of towners. There's something
about being on the edge of the earth that I love though, and likewise
something about being inland which I find really suffocating. As for the
hip-hop scene down here…? Man it's great. I'm not particularly involved
that much, which is a shame. But, I think that's just me… I don't like
to stay too involved in one particular scene. I make as much of an
effort as I can though and the people are all great here.
brightonhiphop.com is a cool thing to have! When I did my show at the
one and only Slipjam: B night down here, I was just overwhelmed man. I'd
never come into contact with young hip-hop heads in Brighton like that
before, and they were so supportive, so cool and open-minded. They were
hip-hop haha. And I think that's reflected in all the acts that are
doing well down here. I need to make more of an effort to get out to
shows and so on. But I'm just not one for events and being out that much
if I'm totally honest.

There are a lot of elements to your music, like hip-hop, electronica,
world music, even folk... do you view yourself as a hip-hop artist?

I knew you'd pick up on that, and the folk thing is something I'm really
getting into now too, I like Wilco, and Woody Guthrie these days. A lot
of that religious folk music from the Depression-era in America is
powerful too. Plus Rachid Taha is dope. If you want to talk about an
experimental artist from 'the world' haha, check him out… he's clever.
But I don't know about the hip-hop thing man, I don't want to say
anything where I'll be sounding like a broken record or cheesy… but at
the end of the day, I believe that hip-hop can embody all those styles
and genres under it.


“...Overall it's just a very positive album, and it was made in a spirit
of childhood innocence, and that's what it reflects...”

Is hip-hop itself a genre? If it is then I want to transcend hip-hop
too, and in that case- I'm not a hip-hop artist, I'm more. But if, as I
think, hip-hop is something bigger than genres, then I'm comfortable
with it, and calling myself a hip-hop artist is fine in that case. It's
all about people's different perceptions. But I listen to all music, so
I am all music, you know? Man, it's a dirty game… labelling… isn't it? I
like to push things though, that's all. I don't like to box things, I
like to make things free, and that includes hip-hop, and people’s
preconceptions of hip-hop. Mangling and changing things is important
sometimes.

Where do you hope to take your music in the next few years?

YoshiI hope to take it upwards, like a hot air balloon. Then, as I'm up
high in the clouds, I hope to take it sideways, all across the Earth,
like a hot air balloon. 'All across the universe', like John Lennon said.

What new projects you working on?

I can't tell you because I don't want to. Haha, I have just completed
two exclusive tracks for some cool dudes at http://www.muslimyouth.net
who released this massive CD with mostly younger MC's on it, and I was
the big daddy of them all haha. It was a wicked experience recording up
in London though. So cop that if you're interested to hear more of my
stuff. But, my next album I can't tell you about now. Needless to say I
never stop, thank God, and I'm working on it everyday.

What is your attitude to live shows?

I love live shows. My attitude to them is love. Love-live haha. Come and
see me if I'm in your area; you'll have a great time because I put on a
mad show and I talk to you. Plus I'm tryin' to incorporate a few Beatles
covers in between some of my tracks so watch the space! Nothing like a
MC who can't sing having the time of his life- that's what I think.

Who are your main influences?

There are too many bro. These days I have been mostly listening to....
The Beatles, George Harrisons solo stuff, Pharoah Saunders, Miles Davis,
John Coltrane.. Joni Mitchell, John Frusciante. At the moment I'm
listening to Foo Fighters, but I check for everything old and new man.
Mars Volta are nice, Divine Styler, Mos Def. I don't give up on Wu-Tang
either man. Rza is timeless. Someone in the hip-hop community should be
honouring him cos of how much experimentation and diversity he's brought
to hip-hop. The last hip-hop album I heard was the Edan one and I liked
it. But I don't know man. Too many to name, plus I sample a lot of them,
so I wanna keep it hush-hush, haha. I'm mainly on to other stuff right
now though, not listening to that much hip-hop at the moment.


“...I never really dug all these complex, supposedly "clever" metaphors
that rappers like Canibus and Eminem used, cos it can feel contrived...”

Shameless plugs/shout outs/rants?

Yoshi - Flowers & Trees LPThanks and praises to God for everything that
is. Love to my family in the UK and USA and everyone who smiled at all
the funny lines and general sillyness on my album. Mirth, I like the
word mirth! My LP is full of mirth! Haha. Peace to everyone else with an
open mind and an opened heart. And to those few who I don't speak to
anymore, don't forget to remember me... in the jingle-jangle morning...
Thanks to you for the interview man, it was funny.

“Flower &Trees” and “From a Western Box” are available to buy now.

Minnesota native, Pulitzer-winning poet Richard Eberhart dies
Associated Press
Published June 12, 2005

HANOVER, N.H. — Richard Eberhart, a Pulitzer Prize-winning poet
admired for mentoring generations of aspiring writers, died at his
home Thursday after a short illness. He was 101.

Eberhart, a Minnesota native, wrote more than a dozen books of poetry
and verse during a career that spanned more than 60 years. He
received nearly every major book award a poet can win, including the
Pulitzer, which he received in 1966 for his Selected Poems,
1930-1965.

In his 1977 acceptance speech for the National Book Award, he said:
"Poetry is a natural energy resource of our country. It has no energy
crisis, possessing a potential that will last as long as the country.
Its power is equal to that of any country in the world.''

Jay Parini, a former colleague who now teaches English at Middlebury
College, called Eberhart "one of the finest American poets.''

"He left behind a dozen poems that I think will be part of the
permanent treasury of American poetry,'' Parini said.

Eberhart was an intensely lyrical poet, Parini said. Unafraid to ask
fundamental questions, his poems explore dramatic issues of life and
death.

"Poems in a way are spells against death,'' Eberhart once told the
Concord Monitor. "They are milestones, to see where you were then
from where you are now. To perpetuate your feelings, to establish
them. If you have in any way touched the central heart of mankind's
feelings, you'll survive.''

Eberhart also was admired for encouraging young poets, including many
at Dartmouth College, where he taught for nearly 30 years. Even in
his ninth decade, Eberhart would call the school's director of
creative writing to say he'd discovered some wonderful poet and to
urge her to consider bringing that person to Dartmouth.

"He had a largess; it extended to himself, too,'' Cleopatra Mathis
said. "He was a person who never tired of talking about poetry, never
tired of bringing people who wanted to write poetry into the fold.''

Eberhart was born on April 5, 1904, in Austin, Minn. He discovered
his love for poetry as a high school student, when an English teacher
asked students to write poems for homework.

"When most of the students would bring in one poem the next day, I
invariably brought in five or ten,'' he said in a 1997 interview in
the Connecticut Review.

After a year at the University of Minnesota, Eberhart transferred to
Dartmouth, where he studied with Robert Frost. He graduated in 1926,
went on to earn bachelor's and master's degrees at St. John's College
at Cambridge University and published his first book, A Bravery of
Earth, in 1930.

Upon returning to the United States, he began studying for his
doctorate at Harvard University, but a lack of money ended his
studies after one year. He spent the Depression teaching English at a
private prep school near Boston, where he met his wife, Helen
Elizabeth "Betty'' Butcher. They were married for 52 years until her
death in 1993.

Although he was old enough to avoid mandatory military service during
World War II, he chose to enlist and became a Navy gunnery
instructor. After the war he spent seven years in management with
Butcher Polish Co. in Boston, a company founded by his wife's family.

He taught at several universities and colleges, then returned to
Dartmouth in 1956 as a professor of English and poet-in-residence.

"Coming to Dartmouth, it was as if he landed in heaven,'' his
daughter, Gretchen Cherington, said last year. Being hired to raise
the stature of poetry at his alma mater was "as much as he could ever
have hoped for,'' she said.

Although he officially retired in 1970, he continued to teach
part-time until the mid-1980s.

Eberhart's survivors include his daughter, son and six grandchildren.
A memorial service is set for June 19 at 2 p.m. at Rollins Chapel in
Hanover, with a reception to follow at the Top of the Hop.

Ha, yes, Nootka is associated with the west coast of what is now called
Vancouver Island, which is on the west coast of Canada, and the northwest
portion of the Olympic Peninsula in the state of Washington.

http://www.languagegeek.com/wakashan/nuuchahnulth.html suggests there are
somewhere between 200 and 500 speakers of the language.

Yes, it was wonderful that Charles B. told us of the
story behind Creeley's Ligeia libretto.  If Creeley
was willing to work on this text without knowing the
composer very well, and wasn't so upset when the
composing of the music didn't happen, it sounds like
he was very pleased to be colloraborating with POE.

I think as many of us as possible should make Poe's
works part of our summer reading, and report back in
say, September.  The different visions people have of
this elusive literary figure are quite intriguing.  On
the surface, D.H. Lawrence's conception of Poe (in
Studies in Classic American Literature) as a
sufferer/diagnostician writing from within a realm of
decadence seems pleasingly consonant with one's niave
reactions to EAP's works, though we know, of course
that Poe was not the forever zonked-out sadsack seer
that folklore pictures, but was very much a busy,
critically-acute professional, as emphasized by W.C.
Williams in the Poe chapter of _In The American
Grain_.

I was surprised to see Charles B., in the recent
Creeley piece, place Poe amongst his list of people
whose writings are in the middle between Whitman's
"expansive, sexually explicit, and exuberant" works
and Dickinson's "philosphical, hermetic,
introspective" poems. Poe is expansive and exuberant,
I wondered? And what is the sexuality in his writing
except incest, and men's love of very young women, and
the morbid desire to completely know the other that
Lawrence notes?

But as far as exuberance goes, maybe one reason I've
never thought of this quality in relation to Poe is
that I haven't taken "The Bells" seriously (as part of
not taking the poems in general very seriously).  But
"Bells" is not so bad at all.  I sign off with the
beginning:

Hear the sledges with the bells -
Silver bells!
What a world of merriment their melody foretells!
How they tinkle, tinkle, tinkle,
In the icy air of night!
While the stars that oversprinkle
All the heavens, seem to twinkle
With a crystalline delight;
Keeping time, time, time,
In a sort of Runic rhyme,
To the tintinnabulation that so musically wells
From the bells, bells, bells, bells,
Bells, bells, bells -
From the jingling and the tinkling of the bells.

I'd like to add that Williams' essay on Poe seems to me one of the most
important.  He reads Poe through Modernist psychological and political
eyes--posits that Poe both records and anticipates American alienation from
self and body, both physical and spiritual, the emotional terror of a vast
unknown continent on its way to Westward Ho (including shopping malls!) and
empire.  Whatever his intention, some of Poe's greatest stories now morph
back into physical parallels of 20th century horrors ("The Masque of the Red
Death," easily reads as AIDS), and 21st  century government sanctioned
physical torture.
"Ligeia," too, is a ghostly character, whose embodiment only becomes real
and beloved in death.  As American Fascism promotes the culture of war,
Poe's "darkness" feels all too realistic these days.
    Also, Poe was America's first real literary critic.  His standards, as
revealed in his numerous reviews of his contemporaries, were demanding and
orthodox, akin to Clement Greenberg's in visual art.
    And his short stories seem to me a poet's prose.  There are no real
characters in Poe's so-called tales of ratiocination.  Characters are used
in the service of the text, and dimensions of a unnamed single speaker,
fairly incapable of conventional fictional strategies.
    Lastly, that Whitman was one of the few who attended Poe's funeral has
some significance.  The American Optimist pays homage to the American
Pessimist, who is Noir as America.  Poe dies long before the 1855 first
edition of Leaves of Grass.   Both  poets are groping for physical,
intellectual and aesthetic "American"  morals and aesthetics that might
counter the puritanical (now morphed into fundamentalist) normative
standards.
    As for Dickinson, I don't agree that her work is hermetic. The work is
often elliptical and dense, but not without entry, providing the reader who
can
accept multiplicity of "meaning", indeterminacy, sound, pun,
 and other now familiar literary devices,
with pleasure.  The work both doubts and confirms.  She thought, as she
said, "New Englandly."
    And rebelled grandly.  As did Creeley. And were Called Back,as it were,
differently.  Not wanting to create a reductive argument about either, I
suggest that each are various and accessible and difficult and yet, more
interrogating, philosophical, domestic, and finally local rather than
hermetic in their poetics.

  Is anybody here familiar with Laura Riding's wickedly brilliant (and
witty) taking to task of the cult of "MONSIEUR POE" as she saw it being
   formulated in the 1920s?

     Just curious what Poe fans and/or Poe skeptics might think of that....

FBI Whistleblower: White Supremacists Are Major Domestic Terrorist Threat

<mailto:montfu65@hotmail.com>

    Los Angeles in 1992... the aftermath of the racial unrest following
    the Rodney King police beating... And the white supremacist groups
    were attempting to take advantage of that situation to spark a race
    war. So they were preparing for the race war by manufacturing
    machine guns and explosives, and one of the cells that we got into
    was actually already involved in a bombing campaign, ...we were able
    to... stop ongoing conspiracies to bomb synagogues and churches that
    were attended prominently by African Americans." -- "Neo-Nazi
    ideology is also a leading influence in rising school violence,"

FBI Whistleblower: White Supremacists Are Major Domestic Terrorist Threat

------------------------------------------------------------------------
We speak with Mike German, an ex-FBI agent who resigned from the agency
last year in protest of what he saw as continuing failures in the FBI
counter terrorism program. German had worked for years going under cover
to infiltrate domestic terrorist organizations like white supremacist
skinhead groups and anti-government militias. [includes rush transcript]
------------------------------------------------------------------------

While terrorism in the U.S has been synonymous with Al Qaeda, for most
of this country's history, domestic white supremacist organizations like
the Klu Klux Klan were the greatest terrorism threat. Some believe they
still may be today. Today, In Mississippi, the trial begins of Edgar Ray
Killen in connection to the murder of three civil rights workers 41
years ago. Michael Schwerner, Andrew Goodman and James Chaney -- were
shot dead allegedly by the Ku Klux Klan. And in Washington, the Senate
is scheduled to vote today on a resolution to apologize for its failure
to enact anti-lynching legislation. An estimated 4,700 people -- mostly
African-Americans -- were lynched between 1882 and 1968.

Another whistleblower just took on the FBI's approach to domestic
terrorism. Mike German worked for the agency for more than 15 years and
quit last year. On June 5th, he wrote an editorial in the Washington
Post advocating that law enforcement pay more attention to organizations
that produce so-called lone wolf extremists like Timothy McVeigh who was
executed for the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing and Eric Rudolph who planted
bombs at the Atlanta Olympics, abortion clinics and a gay nightclub.
German writes that "lone extremists pose a challenge for law enforcement
because they are difficult to predict. It's like searching every
haystack for a needle. Perhaps we'd have better luck if we paid more
attention to the needle factories."

RUSH TRANSCRIPT


AMY GOODMAN: Today, we're joined by an ex-F.B.I. agent, Mike German, a
whistleblower. He resigned from the agency last year in protest of what
he saw as continuing failures in the F.B.I. counterterrorism program.
German had worked for years going undercover to infiltrate domestic
terrorist organizations like white supremacist skinhead groups and
anti-government militias. On June 5, he wrote an editorial in The
Washington Post advocating law enforcement pay more attention to groups
that produce so-called lone wolf extremists like Timothy McVeigh,
executed for the Oklahoma City bombing, and Eric Rudolph who planted the
bombs at the Atlanta Olympics and women's health clinics, a gay night
club, as well. German writes, (quote), "Lone extremists pose a challenge
for law enforcement because they're difficult to predict. It's like
searching every haystack for a needle. Perhaps we'd have better luck if
we paid more attention to the needle factories." He joins us now in our
D.C. studio. Welcome to Democracy Now!

MIKE GERMAN: Thank you, Amy. How are you?

AMY GOODMAN: It's very good to have you with us. Well, can you talk
first about why you quit and what you see as the great domestic threats
today, terroristic threats in this country?

MIKE GERMAN: Well, I was -- had been involved in counterterrorism
operations for about a dozen years. And after 9/11, of course, the
public became aware of how dysfunctional the counterterrorism program
was, but there were problems that I knew about for years, so when things
weren't changing and the F.B.I. wasn't fixing the internal problems that
were causing the breakdowns in communication that actually led to 9/11,
if you read the 9/11 Commission Report, I felt it was my obligation to
come forward and report that there were continuing failures.

AMY GOODMAN: Mike German, can you talk specifically about what you
wanted changed?

MIKE GERMAN: Well, I was involved in specific investigations, and I'm
not allowed to talk about those investigations, particularly, but
basically, if you look at the 9/11 Commission Report, kind of the
diversion was that it was a problem of intelligence, but it really
wasn't a problem of intelligence. You had agents in Phoenix who gathered
the intelligence, who were aware of one portion of the plot. You had
agents in Minneapolis who were aware of another portion of the plot. You
had agents in New York who were aware of another portion of the plot.
And they all wanted to continue their investigation. The agents on the
street are doing their job, they're collecting the information. It's
when they report that information to headquarters and request authority
to continue their investigation, and that's where the breakdown was. And
basically, that was happening in my post-9/11 cases is that that same
mid-level bureaucracy was hampering counterterrorism efforts. So that's
why I reported it to Congress.

AMY GOODMAN: Can you talk about the groups that you think need to be
watched in this country? And if you can give us a thumbnail sketch of
the domestic terrorism attacks most famous one, of course, Oklahoma City
bombing, 1995, Timothy McVeigh.

MIKE GERMAN: Right. Basically 19 -- that was actually in 1995, Timothy
McVeigh's bombing in Oklahoma City. And, you know, what that was was
their demonstration of the abilities that they had, and clearly, they
can do a lot damage in this country. Any extremist group can do damage.
And I think that a lot of the problem right now is we're in this kind of
area where we're categorizing who's the greater threat. Well, to me, the
guy with the bomb today is the greatest threat, and whether he is a
white supremacist terrorist, an Islamic terrorist or an eco-terrorist
doesn't really matter to me. My job as a criminal investigator out on
the street is to try to stop the threat that's there today. And if we do
this sort of ranking where we're only going to pay attention to
eco-terrorists because they're the number one threat or Islamic
terrorists because they're the bigger threat, we're probably going to
drop the ball in one of the other areas. So I think that the mission is
let the agents on the street find out what's happening, but we have to
fix that mid-level management area so we can manage the information that
they're providing.

AMY GOODMAN: How do you infiltrate a group? Can you talk about your --
what you can talk about, your own history?

MIKE GERMAN: Well, I was involved in a case in Los Angeles in 1992, and
in that case, there was a cooperating witness that introduced me into
the group. And then I was involved in a second case in northwest
Washington in 1996, and that also involved a different cooperating
witness, but it was introductions into the group through public
citizens, citizens who saw a problem and wanted to help law enforcement
protect the community. And once they introduced me in, then it was up to
me to try to figure out what -- who the criminals were within the group
and what the criminal activity was, and gather evidence of that criminal
activity.

AMY GOODMAN: Can you talk more specifically, like Los Angeles, what
exactly what that group was doing?

MIKE GERMAN: Well, in Los Angeles there were actually a number of
different groups that we had had gotten into, and they were white
supremacist groups. Los Angeles in 1992, of course, the community was
suffering after -- the aftermath of the racial unrest following the
Rodney King police beating, so there was a lot of racial animosity in
the city. And the white supremacist groups were attempting to take
advantage of that situation to spark a race war. So they were preparing
for the race war by manufacturing machine guns and explosives, and one
of the cells that we got into was actually already involved in a bombing
campaign, and we were able to solve those bombings and recover more
explosive devices and stop ongoing conspiracies to bomb synagogues and
churches that were attended prominently by African Americans.

AMY GOODMAN: Looking at the piece that you did in The Washington Post,
"Behind the Lone Terrorist, a Pack Mentality," you talk about every once
in a while, a follower of these movements bursts violently into our
world with deadly consequences. McVeigh, Eric Rudolph, Buford Furrow,
Jr., Paul Hill, to name just a few, all convicted murderers, identified
as lone extremists, the most difficult terrorists to stop, because they
act independently from any organization. Or do they? You write, "Tim
McVeigh seemed able to find a militia meeting wherever he went. He was
linked to militia groups in Arizona and Michigan, white supremacist
groups in Oklahoma and Missouri, and at gun shows he sold copies of The
Turner Diaries, the racist novel written by the founder of a neo-Nazi
organization. No one finds such groups by accident." You talk about Eric
Rudolph who planted the bombs at the Atlanta Olympics, two abortion
clinics, gay nightclub, grew up in the Christian Identity Movement,
which identifies whites as God's chosen people and encourages the
faithful to follow the Biblical example of Phineas, by becoming
instruments of God's vengeance. Aryan Nations, formerly of Hayden Lake,
Idaho, was the center of Christian Identity thought. Not incidentally,
Buford Furrow worked there as a security guard before going on a
shooting rampage at a Jewish day care center in Southern California. And
you talk about Paul Hill, wrote of the need to take Phineas actions to
prevent abortions and was so well known that the news media used to --
used him to speak in support of Michael Griffin's killing of abortion
doctor, David Gunn, that Hill later shot an abortion provider himself
should have surprised no one. Give us the landscape of these groups.
They're well known.

MIKE GERMAN: Sure, they're well known. And they're very well organized,
and they're very smart. They understand criminal conspiracy laws. They
understand the First Amendment. And they take advantage of those in
training their operatives to go out and do these activities. And the
point I was trying to make is -- is that we can't look at these as
isolated instances. It would be as if we were investigating the mafia
and looking at every mafia hitman as a lone assassin and not looking at
the underlying organization that was producing these murders, you know.
And these people are careful, the leadership are careful about
separating themselves from the actual criminal conspiracy, you know. But
they do set the motive. They set the method that's used, and I believe
that makes them part of the conspiracy. Now, I'm not saying necessarily
you can make a criminal case against them, but all I'm saying is if
we're -- if our number one priority is to prevent acts of terrorism, we
have to pay attention to these needle factories, because that's what
they're producing is these lone extremist terrorists. And it's not just
random violence that occurs once in a while, it's an organized pattern
of activity.

AMY GOODMAN: I remember during President Bush, the first's presidency,
Planned Parenthood trying to get the administration to talk about the
whole movement of burning, bombing, attacking women's health clinics as
a conspiracy, because the same kinds of things were happening around the
country, not to mention the targeting of women's health professionals,
and doctors who performed abortions. They could hardly get an audience
with the Justice Department at the time, and the administration was
adamant about not talking about conspiracy of these groups. What is the
significance of this?

MIKE GERMAN: Well, I think the problem is if you blind yourself to the
conspiracy, then the chances of them being successful in their next act
of lone extremist terrorism is more likely. So, you know, again I'm not
saying that we could necessarily take these leaders into court and
convict them, because the whole purpose of their methodology is to
separate themselves from the actual criminal activity, but what I'm
saying is if we don't pay attention to those leaders, you're going to
insure that the next group is successful, just as if we were only
investigating the mafia one murder at a time and not looking at the
underlying organization. And frankly, you know, these groups, like the
Ku Klux Klan and Aryan Nations, have rich criminal histories just as
deep as the Italian mafia does, yet, you know, we tend to give them a
political status that I don't think is necessarily deserved.

Now, one thing to keep in mind, there are political groups within this
movement. It's a huge community. Like any community, there's a division
of labor, and these -- you know, there are completely law-abiding people
within these groups, and as a criminal investigator, when I went
undercover, one of my -- one of the things that I had to do was separate
those two out, because there are people who have very strong white
supremacist beliefs but would never, ever engage in violence. And my
role as a criminal investigator, I was there to gather evidence of
criminal activity. So I had no interest in talking to those people. I
had to try to find who were the criminals. And I mean, that's the part
-- the hard part about law enforcement in a democratic society, but it's
something that has to be done. And, you know, in my cases, it was done
very effectively and, you know, I believe the F.B.I. should have
replicated those cases more than they did.

AMY GOODMAN: You write in your piece in The Washington Post of last
week, that just six weeks ago, self-avowed white supremacist, Sean
Gillespie, was convicted of firebombing an Oklahoma City synagogue.
According to a CNN report, Gillespie said he once had been a member of
the white supremacist group, Aryan Nations. He later left the group. At
the time of his arrest, he told authorities he was a racist skinhead
acting on his own. But before the attack, he videotaped himself stating,
"I will film it for your viewing enjoyment, my kindred white power." If
he's all alone, who are his "kindred"? "Neo-Nazi ideology is also a
leading influence in rising school violence," you write. "The March 21
shooting at Minnesota's Red Lake High School was carried out by a Native
American teen who praised Adolf Hitler, used the name 'Native Nazi' in
internet chat rooms, and the shooters at Colorado's Columbine High
School reportedly greeted each other with Nazi salutes and chose
Hitler's birthday as the date of their attack. But you rarely hear these
incidents described as acts of domestic terrorism." Who defines whether
it's terrorism or not?

MIKE GERMAN: Well, that's a big part of the problem, and you know, any
time they come up with numbers of terrorist attacks, you have got to
realize that there's a reporting problem there. You know, a white man
beats a black man on the street, is that just a random assault or is
that a hate crime, or is that an act of domestic terrorism, or is it
nothing? Does it not get reported at all? So, any time that the
government talks about numbers of terrorism attacks, what they're
talking about is the number of attacks that were reported as acts of
terrorism. And like the school violence, sometimes it's not even thought
of as domestic terrorism, but if neo-Nazi influence is influencing these
kids to act out violently, I would argue that that's part of the
terrorist movement, and that that, by paying attention to the neo-Nazi
groups that are producing that literature and those websites, we might
have a better idea of who might be the next lone extremist, so that we
can stop him.

AMY GOODMAN: With people like Paul Hill, the abortion doctor killer, the
whole violent attack on women's health movement, is it also that the
administration with a very anti-choice point of view, brings politics
into defining who they will go after and who they don't? Is that fair to
say?

MIKE GERMAN: No, I really don't think so. In my experience, the agents
on the street have really never let politics get involved, really are
very apolitical.

AMY GOODMAN: Not the agents on the street, but at the top.

MIKE GERMAN: Except that that's who actually does the investigation. So,
you know, I mean, kind of one of the misnomers about all this talk of
reforming the government for counterterrorism, it's not as if the
director could say, 'Hey, agent in Des Moines, find me a domestic
terrorist case today.' You know, he can only deal with what's on the
street in front of him. So, cases actually get reported up from the
street. And, you know, the agents on the street are the ones that are
actually making the cases, and where -- like what I said before, where
it breaks down is when it gets through management. And I don't believe
politics really plays a point in that. I -- you know, whether politics
plays a point in these kind of rankings of what terrorist groups are
most dangerous right now, that very well may be, but my whole point is
that you can't really rank these guys based on their ideology. You have
to worry about who has got the bomb today.

AMY GOODMAN: Where are the white militia groups centered today in this
country, and how hard is it to infiltrate?

MIKE GERMAN: You know, they're everywhere. I think that one of the big
misperceptions about these groups is that they're only out West. They're
only up in the Northwest. You know, once you're kind of attuned to their
language and their codes and their symbols, I see that kind of stuff
everywhere I go. I have, you know, traveled all over the United States
and have been able to find something that gives me an indication that
there's a community there. When a community gets leafleted, typically
that's a sign that there is a group that is at least trying to start
operating in that community. And if you, you know, look at these groups,
the Southern Poverty Law Center, the Anti-Defamation League, they keep
track of this kind of information, you will see that they're spread out
everywhere, and keep in mind that they're clandestine groups, so they do
their best to hide. So of the ones we know about, there's probably --
you know, that's probably just the tip of the iceberg. There's probably,
you know, two or three times that many that nobody has ever heard of.
When I was working undercover in the Los Angeles case, the one group
that we found that was actually involved in the bombing campaign, nobody
even knew about them. You know, the Huntington Beach Police Department
had done a very nice job helping -- assisting us in that case, in
identifying some of these young people, but it was basically a group
that was operating completely under the radar.

AMY GOODMAN: We're talking to former F.B.I. man, Mike German, who quit
the F.B.I. in 2004, had been there for 16 years, quit over how the
F.B.I. was dealing with domestic terrorism. Do you expect an attack soon
in this country?

MIKE GERMAN: An attack from domestic terrorists?

AMY GOODMAN: Yes.

MIKE GERMAN: Or --

AMY GOODMAN: Or, well, no, let's broaden it to: Do you expect a
terrorist attack in this country?

MIKE GERMAN: Of course. I don't think that, you know, you're ever going
to stop terrorism. You know, and part of the problem is, we use one word
to describe very many different things, you know, whether it's the
Unabomber, Ted Kaczynski, or the D.C. snipers or, you know, organized
white supremacist groups and organized foreign terrorist groups. We're
certainly never going to stop terrorism altogether. You know, I think we
just have to try to do the best we can to prevent as many acts as we
can, and it requires really a lot of proactive work. And I think one of
the big problems is after 9/11, there was generated this idea that
criminal law enforcement is somehow ineffective in preventing terrorist
attacks.

Well, my two cases prove that you could prevent terrorist attacks. I
mean, in both of my cases, we actually used criminal law enforcement
techniques to prevent acts of terrorism. And unfortunately, the way the
intelligence reform has gone has moved from criminal law enforcement to
this intelligence model. Well, you know, basically the problem in 9/11
was the American public had no idea how dysfunctional the F.B.I.
counterterrorism program had become, but now we're under this
intelligence model, we actually know even less about what the government
is doing to protect us from terrorism. You know, there's less
accountability in the F.B.I., and I certainly know that there are
problems, and I reported those problems to Congress, but so far,
Congress hasn't been able to even get to the bottom of what I reported
to them over a year ago.

So, there's just no oversight, and those things are really the problems.
And until we fix what is internally wrong in the F.B.I., I don't think
it's going to change. I think that we're still at great risk. You know,
the 9/11 Commission found that the big problems were the F.B.I. had a
poor ability to analyze intelligence that was coming in from the street,
that they didn't share information well, and they didn't have a
computerized system to share information, even among agents. And just
last week, the 9/11 Commission discourse project came out and told us
that -- gave us their report card, and it was that the F.B.I. still
doesn't have an analytic capability, it still isn't sharing information
in the intelligence community, and it still doesn't have a computer
system. That's four years after 9/11.

So, you know, the problem -- these are all symptoms of one problem, and
the problem is mismanagement within the F.B.I., yet none of the
recommendations that of the 9/11 Commission addressed that
mismanagement. Former Attorney General Richard Thornburg at the 9/11
discourse project last Monday said that, you know, one of the things
that bothered him as he was trying to review information about the
F.B.I. is through the course of the time that he was there, every time
he went to a meeting, it was a different F.B.I. supervisor he was
meeting with, that the turnover among supervisors is so rapid that they
really don't have an opportunity to learn their job before they're
moving to the next one.

AMY GOODMAN: Mike German, last question. That is, the latest report that
under pressure from the White House, the F.B.I. has agreed to adopt
recommendations of a presidential commission to allow the Director of
National Intelligence, John Negroponte, to help choose the powerful new
intelligence chief at the F.B.I. The appointment would for the first
time in the Bureau's history give an outsider a significant role in the
selection of a high level official in the F.B.I. What do you think about
this?

MIKE GERMAN: Well, it'll depend on who it is and whether he has the
ability to force the managers below him to reform their conduct. And you
know, I mean, it's kind of perfume on a pig to keep changing these top
people, because I don't think the top people are the problem.

AMY GOODMAN: Mike German. On that note, I'm going to say thanks very
much for joining us. Again, Mike German, with the F.B.I. for more than
15 years, quit last year, did a piece in The Washington Post last week
called, "Behind the Lone Terrorist, a Pack Mentality."

Dear All,

While out of the country last year, Jessica Smith subletted, and =
subsequently trashed my flat (broken toilet, tampons on the porch, dirty =
underwear in the silverware, etc.) She skipped town in the night, with =
bills and rent unpaid, plants dead, and the heat on at 80 degrees in the =
middle of a Buffalo winter.

If anyone has her contact information, it would be greatly appreciated. =
Sorry to cloud the list with my own dirty laundry, but this was not =
merely a violation of personal trust, but a violation of the communal =
trust we share on and off this list, together.

Cheers,

Kyle

There are some little known audio tapes of Creeley, Susan Howe, Bob Grenier
and others speaking about Dickinson.  They were recorded in the mid 80s at a
Dickinson conference at New College of California, in San Francisco, where I
taught in the Poetics Program for 15 years.  They reside in the library
there.  Anyone interested might contact the College.

yes yes yes

it is such a game to play
"i am here and i am not here"
i am virtual here now this is a virtual letter: X
or a real letter; that was my left-hand-ring-finger
"speaking" of the X and please note
this tired conceptualism is the oldest trick in the book
if one begins the book in 1973
everyone in 1973 is already dead
1973 culture is already dead
but "i am here now XXX" and typing this
right now. as you read this. now.

MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII

Dear all,

I know we just had a Rhubarb update, but I went a little crazy this
morning and wrote a review of the University of Chicago Modern Poetry
Anthology: 2150-2200.

http://rhubarbissusan.blogspot.com/2005/06/chicago-modern-american-poetry-2150.html

from the opening paragraph: "The University of Chicago has released what
claims to be "the most definitive collection of human-readable American
poetry for the latter half of the 22nd century." Of course, 'definitive'
here is a relative term: 'American' here is taken to mean only poets
from the fifty-five United States and Free Iraq -- although, as if in an
afterthought, included also are seven poets from the Maritian and Lunar
colonies whose national status, following the events of 4/22 and the
destruction of the Equitorial Space Elevator, might most charitably be
described as in extreme flux."

I hope you enjoy it, and do spread the word about rhubarb is susan!

-- Simon

A couple of friends and I are starting up a poetry web radio
station...Poetry World Radio...our goal is to be on 24/7, which means
we'll have pre-recorded material mixed with live shows.. Bill Dupree, the
techmeister, is working on the program that will organize/disorganize the
playlist so that it doesn't just run through the same loop in the same
order over and over

So....if you or anyone you know has a spoken word recording in English and
you're interested in getting some airplay (webplay?), please send it to:

Charlie Rossiter
705 S. Gunderson Ave
Oak Park, IL 60304
U.S.A.

By submitting a recording you are affirming that you own the copyright to
the material (this includes background music, if any) and that you grant
us permission to play it.

If you want to check us out before getting involved, it's easy.  Poetry
World Radio is a joint project of me, Charlie Rossiter, Bill DuPree who is
the tech wizard of www.poetrypoetry.com, and C.J.Laity who runs the
equally wonderful website, www.Chicagopoetry.com

Check out poetrypoetry and chicagopoetry and then come on board.  We hope
to hear from you.

Oops--my response to Pierre was meant backchannel....

Anyway, TODAY JUNE 14th is the official RELEASE DATE
of the second CONTINUOUS PEASANT album, INTENTIONAL GROUNDING.

So, to celebrate that, my record label is offering a one-day discount deal-=
-
20% off the price of the album if you, uh, ACT BEFORE MIDNIGHT PDST

If you're interested in buying it, go to our website
www.continuouspeasant.com

or our label's website
www.goodforks.com

There should be ordering instructions there;
and mention this offer or else they'll try to charge you the full price

or feel free to backchannel me with every question

Thank you from Continuous Peasant


AND P.S. THANKS TO EVERYONE WHO CAME OUT AND SUPPORTED US ON OUR EAST COAST
TOUR, and especially to those who put us up (put up with us) or offered to-=
-
Without you we would have lost not just our shirts but also our pants!

& it was great to reconnect with so many people back east; many of whom
   i met in one way or another through this list....

(I plan to write a more detailed account when I get over this
 post-tour depression and get my voice back....)

The Poe inference of discussion has been making me think/ruminate on the
darkness that seems to permeate this country regressively to deep levels by
the day. In the vicinity of 70 years or so after the last public lynching in
the United States, the US Senate bravely apologized for not having enacted
laws that would have outlawed the practice. In spite of loosing the Civil
War, the Confederacy obviously refused to die a natural death, but continued
to work its will against people of color. Many now would say the Confederacy
- the various reactionary limbs of the old South are, indeed, in control of
the country, including 'our' military and its foreign policy, including war
crimes of torture primarily against people of color, and certainly not
against those of Christian faith.
I thought it incredible that on the same day the Senate is making its
apology for implicitly condoning lynching that Time magazine gives us a log
blow by blow account of another borderline lynching the criminal torture of
an Arab detainee at Guantanamo (a practice, one can only assume was/is used
on multiple other detainees at Guantanamo and other such center.)  And, on
the same day of this revelation, and perhaps not dissimilar from the history
of the United State Senate, we have to witness Vice-President Cheney get up
and say the Q torture is a decent practice, essential to saving American
lives, etc. I am sure the historic lynch mobs and their leaders said the
same thing, that a good lynching was one that kept African-Americans and
their sympathizers in their place.
The Confederate Dunces are mad at it again. Torture, it appears, is the
"lynchpin" of foreign policy. It also appears to be recipe for national
death, and/or perpetual war.

But back to Poe - more and more "The Pit and The Pendulum" appears to
constitute a nationally self-destructive vision - the country tied down
under the free wheeling rats and the blade.
"...He observes that the pendulum will cut at a right angle to his body ..."

It seems, at least, that dark to me.  Fortunately, it also appears, even
with the recruiting rats in the high schools, the young are voting with
their feet.

Seems very much worth looking at ...


Dear MoveOn member,

You know that email petition that keeps circulating
about how Congress is slashing funding for NPR and
PBS? Well, now it's actually true. (Really. Check the
footnotes if you don't believe us.)

A House panel has voted to eliminate all public
funding for NPR and PBS, starting with "Sesame
Street," "Reading Rainbow," and other commercial-free
children's shows. If approved, this would be the most
severe cut in the history of public broadcasting,
threatening to pull the plug on Big Bird, Cookie
Monster and Oscar the Grouch.

Sign the petition telling Congress to save NPR and
PBS:

http://www.moveon.org/publicbroadcasting/?id=5663-1050723-dgjB6wX556xFuMPzBZJz6A&t=3


If we can reach 250,000 signatures by the end of the
week, we'll put Congress on notice. After you sign the
petition, please pass this message along to any
friends, neighbors or co-workers who count on NPR and
PBS.

The cuts would slash 25% of the federal funding this
year—$100 million—and end funding altogether within
two years.1 In particular, the loss could kill beloved
children's shows like "Sesame Street," "Clifford the
Big Red Dog," "Arthur" and "Postcards from Buster."
Rural stations and those serving low-income
communities might not survive. Other stations would
have to increase corporate sponsorships.

This shameful vote is only the latest partisan assault
on public TV and radio. The Corporation for Public
Broadcasting, which exists to shield public TV and
radio from political pressure, is now chaired by
Kenneth Tomlinson, a staunch Republican close to the
White House. Tomlinson has already forced one-sided
conservative programs on the air, even though
Tomlinson's own surveys show that most people consider
NPR "fair and balanced" and they actually trust public
broadcasting more than commercial network news.2

Tomlinson also spent taxpayer dollars on a witch hunt
to root out "liberal bias," including a secret
investigation of Bill Moyers and PBS' popular
investigative show, "NOW." Even though the public paid
for the investigation, Tomlinson has refused to
release the findings.3

The lawmakers who proposed the cuts aren't just trying
to save money in the budget—they're trying to decimate
any news outlets who question those in power. This is
an ideological attack on our free press.

Talk about bad timing. Every day brings another story
about media consolidation. Radio, TV stations and
newspapers are increasingly controlled by a few
massive corporate conglomerates trying to maximize
profits at the expense of quality journalism. Now more
than ever, we need publicly funded media who will ask
hard questions and focus on stories that affect real
people, instead of Michael Jackson and the runaway
bride.

As the House and Senate consider this frightening
effort to kill public broadcasting, they need to hear
from its owners—you.

http://www.moveon.org/publicbroadcasting/?id=5663-1050723-dgjB6wX556xFuMPzBZJz6A&t=4



Thank you for all you do,

Ron Silliman, I was so taken by your blog on the difference between
publishing poetry online and in print, by the wide area you covered, that I
hardly know where to begin my appreciation. You prompted the following.

1. The greatest advantage to publishing online is that you get known about
much more widely than in print, apart from the much longer time it takes fo=
r
any publication to respond to a postal submission. Even as you remark: prin=
t
is welcome if you get invited but I wd say hardly preferable
otherwise--unless one thinks of online existence as insubstantial. The
prejudice of some  literary minds.

2. I once thought of the computer as too hard for an alpha person who was
not numeric. I changed when back in 1991 the book publisher who accepted a
prose ms. of mine wd give me 15% royalties, only if I cd send it on a flopp=
y
disk (which I had hardly heard of), otherwise only 10%. So, I bought a Mac
and grudgingly learned.

3. About those you know with macular degeneration who won=B9t go near a
computer. There are degreees of macular degeneration. I=B9m in my eighties an=
d
have it in both eyes. But not so badly in my left eye that I can=B9t read. I
won=B9t drive anymore and reading is no fun, but on the computer screen I can
work with 16-point print. I know that lots of people have bought computers
and later discover they have little practical use for them. On the other
hand those who feel computers are outside their limits may discover a new
bond they hadn=B9t anticipated. The computer can be considered a visual aid
for  the m.d.=B9d.

4. I began as a word poet, actually in traditional verse, but long before I
dared approach a computer I was also doing what I didn=B9t at first call
visual poetry though I knew most of it wasn=B9t concrete. I still can=B9t figur=
e
out Photoshop and I still do a lot of photocopying outside (and I still
write word poems), but the big difference in publishing online is that
people discover you who would never have known you existed in print.

5. I note that Poets & Writers is still heavily print oriented. I nearly
gave up my subscription because if I=B9m looking for mss. wanted, I find more
on the net. The main reason I still subscribe is that over the years people
have re-established contact with me through their directory--but,
interestingly, they were people no longer young, and, yes, aged writers who
are not  online.=20

together poets, musicians, visual and video artists to note it and =20
respond. Practitioners, performers, theorists will gather to explore =20
language, to untie the familiar knots, unpack meaning, history, routine =20=

and play, and reassemble them to offer a new field of possibilities.

Running from July 4-10 at the Christian Brothers School on O=92Sullivan =20=

Quay, the SoundEye Festival celebrates its ninth year in 2005, having =20=

grown from a weekend of unconventional poetry into a week-long =20
exploration of the arts of the word.

The purpose in gathering almost fifty poets and performers to Cork for =20=

this event is to celebrate the opening up of language to disciplines =20
and experiences beyond those familiar in Irish poetry, to enjoy the =20
achievement of those who have remade their medium here and elsewhere, =20=

and, as always, to start over.

Participants in SoundEye 2005will include American poets such as =20
Charles Bernstein and Nathaniel Mackey who are noted not only for the =20=

surprise and quality of their writing, but also for the power of their =20=

performance. Susan Howe, with David Grubbs on computer and piano, will =20=

perform a version of her poems Thorow and Melville's Marginalia in =20
which Irish and American history intermesh.

Fanny Howe, Mark Weiss, Catherine Wagner, Keith Tuma and Carlos =20
Blackburn complete the U.S. presence, along with Irish expatriates =20
David Lloyd and Mair=E9ad Byrne.

 =46rom further afield we have Yang Lian, in exile from China since =
1989, =20
and Alison Croggon, poet, novelist, librettist from Australia. Amir Or, =20=

Israeli coordinator of Poets for Peace, will be reading with English =20
poet and translator Fiona Sampson.

Participants coming from the U.K. will include Tom Leonard, Bill =20
Griffiths, John Wilkinson, Kelvin Corcoran, Lee Harwood and Peter =20
Riley, each with a record of over thirty years exploration and =20
achievement among the possibilities of language.

We will also have the world premi=E8re of Wendy Mulford's The Unmaking, =20=

specially commissioned for SoundEye, with music composed by Michael =20
Parsons and performed by Angharad Davies. This work is based on the =20
highland clearances on the Scottish island of Skye in the 1840s.

Maggie O'Sullivan, whose father was a sean-n=F3s singer from Skibbereen =20=

in west Cork, will work with traditional musicians from the Cork area =20=

in her voicing of fragments from memory and lost traditions.

Among the Irish participants will be many who have worked over the =20
decades within the culture of small-press publication, where lack of =20
distribution and public profile is repaid by freedom to take risks, =20
fail better and more interestingly, and achieve new things.

Michael Smith, Geoffrey Squires, Augustus Youngand Trevor Joyce =20
represent the generation of New Writers' Press, to mark the 30th =20
anniversary of which SoundEye was founded in 1997. Maurice Scully, =20
Catherine Walsh, Randolph Healy and Billy Mills are voices from the 80s =20=

and 90s in Ireland, still sounding, still strong. Hugh Maxton has been =20=

another independent voice, throughout. SoundEye will pay also tribute =20=

to the spirit of poets Brian Coffey and Robert Creeley in two =20
multi-reader sessions.

SoundEye 2005 occurs at the hinge moment between two other major events =20=

in the programme for Cork as European Capital of Culture for 2005: the =20=

Cork Caucus, and the Vinyl project.

We share a venue with Vinyl, and also a number of participants. =46rom =20=

the start of July until its own conclusion on August 13th, Vinyl will =20=

provide a bookshop selling books by SoundEye poets, many unavailable =20
through normal channels.

We have in common with the Caucus a concern for where the arts, in our =20=

case specifically the arts of language, stand in relation to society. =20=

We will, therefore, 'exchange embassies' with the Caucus, with SoundEye =20=

occupying a slot in their programme, and vice versa.

=A0
For more information on these events, please see www.cork2005.ie

All Sound Eye events except that at 6.30, Monday 4th, will be held in =20=

the Christian Brother's School, Sullivan's Quay, Cork. (Entrance via =20
Cove Street)

I enjoyed the discussion on silliman's blog
I enjoyed irving's response and his visual poetry
I appreciate the observation that web publication has equal or greater
cultural value to poets these days.
I particularly liked the comment about waiting months to receive a reply
from print publishers, web publication being more immediate.
He enjoyed mairead's post
He related immediately to sabbatical
He laughed when he got to=20
        THE STIGMA OF SELF-PUBLICATION

        I am so over it.

And smiled widely when i read, but had to change,
        Sky - the minds television

It is time now to say to make a very bold modernist statement:
  whether old or young, or from different parts of the world, this
multiplicity that is poetry somehow unites us.

|||Ron Silliman, I was so taken by your blog on the difference between
|||publishing poetry online and in print, by the wide area you covered, =
that
|||I
|||hardly know where to begin my appreciation. You prompted the =
following.
|||
|||1. The greatest advantage to publishing online is that you get known
|||about
|||much more widely than in print, apart from the much longer time it =
takes
|||for
|||any publication to respond to a postal submission. Even as you =
remark:
|||print
|||is welcome if you get invited but I wd say hardly preferable
|||otherwise--unless one thinks of online existence as insubstantial. =
The
|||prejudice of some  literary minds.
|||
|||2. I once thought of the computer as too hard for an alpha person who =
was
|||not numeric. I changed when back in 1991 the book publisher who =
accepted
|||a
|||prose ms. of mine wd give me 15% royalties, only if I cd send it on a
|||floppy
|||disk (which I had hardly heard of), otherwise only 10%. So, I bought =
a
|||Mac
|||and grudgingly learned.
|||
|||3. About those you know with macular degeneration who won=B9t go near =
a
|||computer. There are degreees of macular degeneration. I=B9m in my =
eighties
|||and
|||have it in both eyes. But not so badly in my left eye that I can=B9t =
read.
|||I
|||won=B9t drive anymore and reading is no fun, but on the computer =
screen I
|||can
|||work with 16-point print. I know that lots of people have bought
|||computers
|||and later discover they have little practical use for them. On the =
other
|||hand those who feel computers are outside their limits may discover a =
new
|||bond they hadn=B9t anticipated. The computer can be considered a =
visual aid
|||for  the m.d.=B9d.
|||
|||4. I began as a word poet, actually in traditional verse, but long =
before
|||I
|||dared approach a computer I was also doing what I didn=B9t at first =
call
|||visual poetry though I knew most of it wasn=B9t concrete. I still =
can=B9t
|||figure
|||out Photoshop and I still do a lot of photocopying outside (and I =
still
|||write word poems), but the big difference in publishing online is =
that
|||people discover you who would never have known you existed in print.
|||
|||5. I note that Poets & Writers is still heavily print oriented. I =
nearly
|||gave up my subscription because if I=B9m looking for mss. wanted, I =
find
|||more
|||on the net. The main reason I still subscribe is that over the years
|||people
|||have re-established contact with me through their directory--but,
|||interestingly, they were people no longer young, and, yes, aged =
writers
|||who
|||are not  online.

|||All to the Good,

Dear All,

While out of the country last year, Jessica Smith subletted, and
subsequently trashed my flat (broken toilet, tampons on the porch, dirty

Dear All,

While out of the country last year, Jessica Smith subletted, and

  Dropped L off at the new air-port....Hi-Tech Mid-Air anywhere....Took the train into T.a.V...walked thru the outskirts of junk stores..cheap furniture..street beggars.....bad falafel joints...for a mile to Allenby...

  Stopped at Halper's Books...89? Allenby...small glass case out front...down an alley to some cheap outisde stuffe..into cramped as usual quarters...half-english..half-hebrew...10 per cent other...p.b. reading copies..a few better things..but mostly given the climate and history...90 per cent dumpster dross in NY...but i had managed to eke out a few  purchases days before..a copy of JugStone Pottery N.C...a 12mo Marcel Janco book...and Golden Goose No. 4...the Norman Mclean Number...all added up to about 55 shekels...about 11-12 dollars American..i left an inscribed copy of Dennis Silk's  scarce 1st book....because i've been staring at an uninscribed copy for anon more than a decade...& i figured somebody else should find this not so wonderful conditioned copy...

  The owner told me if i came back i could see the 'better stuffe'...outside...up the stairs...long stairs up into the third world..broken down offices...unswept floors...junkie bait..a half a block off the main drag...the stuffe was 'better'... some of it on the internet..(he had sold a book on Danish Royalty to Buckingham Palace last week...and just got an order for a signed Saul Bellow) & some not on the internet and not marked...i kinda half-looked..half kibbituzed...half sighed and didn't buy anything..

  But my 10 dollar purchase of days before..and the owner drew me a map of the land..down the block  opposite him in a half-enclosed arcade lay piles upon piles outside  of nothing in particular...they seem to have been in biz for more than 60 yrs...but all guesses...since it seems to be a regular police stop...is that they sell something more profitable than books..i eyed the hebrew pulp porn mags...but it's a long way to SOHO..

  Then a few block down past the outdoor veggie market...BiBliophile...this time the piles reached to the ceiling..some on shelfs...some not... french hebrew english spanish..mostly paper..most of the better stuffe with scotch taped spines...but i kinda of almost glanced at the Best of David Hamilton..stiff wrappers..and the smaller Wingate/Fellini...which was an OK copy..

  A block down and a across the street..and a walk of 4 blocks on King George St..was Moise Pollack...who i saw gating his store...mid-european   hours...Sun to Thur..9 to 1:30....in the front window was some Arberry Sufi stuffe...and a number of books on the Middle-East..a nice H.C. 1st of Antonius  ARAB WAKENING...this is A.B.A...&&&&

  With nothing better to do..I return to the Little Prince Bookshop...which i had casually perused ten minutes before..and this time found among the photography Ralph Gibson's DEJA VU...35 shekels minus 20 per cent discount..plus one shekel..since they didn't have the right change...Ralph has promised me each of the last three yrs that he was going to sell his photo  book collection...and maybe this is the sign..

  Anyhows...now  the Surf Center...15 shekels per hr...one of the few things much cheaper than N.Y...on to the next bookstore down the next block...to the next jerusalem..

   In the market buy orange cap....i wear it everywhere...orange being the color of the zealots who refuse to evacuate Gaza...color me ORANGE...victory insures peace...not the other way round...drn..

On December 29th 2001 I was joined by my friend and cousin by marriage John=
 Gioia to a bar (it shall remain nameless) in Queens in order to visit with=
 a friend, Jillian Johnson, who was tending bar that evening. She closed at=
 4 and we stayed after to chat, then John left (his wife Jackie was pregnan=
t at the time) but I stayed and went back to her apartment since she was ha=
ving a few people over to close the night/morning out with. These people we=
re one NYC firefighter and one NYC police officer (names unremembered, face=
s too, even under the auspices of what is about to happen). I was drinking =
heavily that night, I believe these guys were too, and Jillian had only a f=
ew beers.

The conversation had turned to Afghanistan and bin Laden and because I am p=
rofoundly anti-Bush and anti-(anything)American (besides the people and the=
 hopes of the activists) I opened my mouth a little too wide that evening. =
To sum up, I had pinned blame on the Bush Administration and that invading =
Afghanistan (even though it was a premature thought, but one I still believ=
e in today) and putting blame on others that were not apprently certain, wa=
s, truly, unpatriotic and umAmerican (now I believe it is totally American)=
. What persisted after the fact were threats: the NYC police officer threat=
ed to shoot me with his "issued" gun, off duty or not, and the fire fighter=
 grew to enormous proportions and threated to beat the living shit out of m=
e.=20

Agreeably, it was a strange time, a difficult time, but I wasn't backing do=
wn because it was the will of the many (who were, obviously, misinformed an=
d volatile because they had no idea what was the reality). I did have a bre=
akdown that night, Jillian helped me through it, and I felt guilty about le=
aving NYC the year before to move to Baltimore. And she kept telling me to =
just go along with what they say, because they were her friends and she fel=
t it too. I was sad but it could have been selfish to think that I left NYC=
 and was no longer a part of the impact of these events. I was no longer a =
New Yorker after these events. And when I go home I no longer feel like a N=
ew Yorker, even though I spent my whole life their, grew up there, made a c=
hoice to stay alive there.

What are these feelings now that well up in me, where I feel I no longer ha=
ve a choice about my relationship with NY? Am I no longer a New Yorker? Do =
I no longer have a home?

You mean members of emergency services who lost a lot of their own on

This just might have been a problem also. Now you have members of

This is deplorable. However, I still note that members of the emergency
services lost a lot of comrades in the attacks and felt this in a
particularly personal way, and everybody was, I hate to sound like a CD
with a skip in it, drunk.

>And she kept telling me to just go along with what they say, because they were her friends and she felt it too.
>
There's a word that I find really, really useful for touchy situations
with people who might be feeling volatile: "Mmm." It is semantically
devoid, and allows you to disagree on the inside while still not saying
anything that a drunk, emotional person might perceive as inflammatory.

>
I dunno, how do you drive?

Chris, you have asked some vexed questions in a tone that seems to
invite unconditional sympathy and/or a rush of New Yorkers embracing you
and saying, "Of course you're still one of us, pal." I do sympathize,
but it's not unconditional. How did you ever grow up to whatever age you
were in 2001 while still thinking it was a really great idea to try to
have a reasoned political debate with drunk, angry, and, in one case,
armed people?

I like to look at other people's snapshots, don't you?
The voyeur in me is titilated by imagining the skeins
of love and betrayal between distant people in
indifferent photographs. Why are those two, husband
and wife according to the caption, sitting so far
apart? Why is he looking away? What does that haunted
look on the face of the son mean?

I came across this website today:

http://www.fightmannequinism.org

which reminded me of this poem by Bob Hicok in the
latest Octopus:


REPARATIONS


A group of people look into the well. I lean over too,
we stare at each other upside down. There's a man
mannequin in the water. One of the people says
we should rescue him with a spear gun and rope,
another
that we should ask a woman mannequin to make the first
feel lonely and capable of flight. But what if he's
gay,
someone asks. I remind them of the oppressive
condition
in which our hero lives, being, not even wood,
but a plastic designed to keep clothes from snagging.
As is often the case, we soon resent his misery,
lean back in the short grass and talk of angora
sweaters
we've loved, of the expression mannequins perfect,
the one that says, my smile, I owe my smile to this
shade
of burgundy. When I wake, the man mannequin
stands above me, dripping, his smooth crotch shining
in moonlight. It occurs to me we may have ruined
his privacy, and I want to sing him a song that says
how sorry I am, but the only sounds that come to mind
are of two cars smashing on the highway, and I wake
the man beside me, and we run head first at each other
to sing this song.



This re-visitation compelled me to search for a man
mannequin, which can be purchased (at least a
variation of) at Target:

http://www.target.com/gp/detail.html/601-6285412-7019353?asin=B0002OI344&LID=p5443963&AFID=Google&LNM=mannequin%20man&ref=tgt_adv_XSGB1343

But I couldn't find a wire woman, and thus, got
distracted by the world's overstock of blow-up
versions, until I hit on a theory of the doll:

http://www.lib.latrobe.edu.au/AHR/archive/Issue-Sept-1996/stratton.html


Although, the acres of grass I haven't seen for months
are about to get wet, so I'm abandoning this line of
thinking for now.

Be well~

realizing that people are troubled by more pressing issues i do ask for
you ear in this matter of my life and my dog's life. my doctor recently
wrote a letter concerning the importance of the dog to me in my life and
for my health so to me, at least and it seems to others this issue is of
importance  i do feel that, with the encrease violence and targetting of
myself and my dog by ian fraser of the "victoria animal control
services" i am in danger of being injured, imprsioned or killed.

i hope that you can excuse the interuption with this note on the recent
incident

i don't know what to do i was assaulted by a "victoria animal control
services" officer ian fraser who has a history of violence, targetting,
stalking and harassment of me and my dog.  i normally have my dog on a
lead and harness. it is that the targetting is so intense that one slip
renders me indanger of violence, impoundment of my dog or death for both
of us. life is once again becoming unliveable for me and buddy. when ian
fraser was employed with the crd his officers had admitted to harassing
me by telling a buisness owner of the wild fire bakery that he had a
list of all the places me and my dog went throughout the day. there were
at the time two animal controls protrolling for the city. so they had
targetted me and disrupted businesses inorder to do it. the businesses
and nieghbours came out in defense of me  a few years ago and ian fraser
of then the crd and now of the "victoria animal control services" laid
off -- until now.

today at 430 i was walking my dog from the corner store and he went to
play with a dog who was runnin with his owner on his bike.  ian frase of
the animal control services having stopped me early this week when i was
turning the corner of my street to go to work with my dog, i had
apologized adn place him on his lead but ian fraser was very agressive
but the secen had a=occured at that time on a busy city street of
hillside. with in a few days ian fraser of "victoria animal control
services" was waiting on the corner of the street few yards from my home
in an unmarked van and came rushing out and told me to give him my dog
and that he was impounding it for being off leash.

i said he should write a ticket not inpoound the dog. he said he didn't
have to since her warned me before. he was very aggressive and so i went
to call the police he grabbed me by my shirt and became physically
aggressive. realizing that i was alone on a corner and before my dog was
provoked to defend me i shouted for help. the neighbours came out and he
released me.  he then called the police and said i was resisting arrest
and that my dog had attacked the other dog and had attacked dogs
before.  my neighbours testified as to the gentleness of my dog and
queried him on his aggressive behaviour. this is when he said that all i
had to do was place the dog in the van and pay a fine and then i would
have my dog back immediately. we asked him why he didn't say this
before. my neighbour offered to pay the fine and eventually was allowed
to do so. the police were concerned as to why he had manhandled me. but
he informed them that he could as a "peace officer".  the police thanked
me for being "the bigger man" in the incident.  This is when the man on
the bike who had the dog came back to the scene and told the place that
my dog had not attacked his dog and the he was concerned as to the
aggressive behaviour of the crd officer ian fraser.

i was issued two tickets --

"hinder/delay/obstruct poundkeeper" and $150.00 and $35.00 for the
release of my dog.

the police told me the that there are appeals.

they also took note on how well behaved my dog was.

ian fraser has a history of aggressive behavior and harassement of
myself and my dog. he has become increasingly more agressive and his
credibilty has been compromised. in the past the situation caused
buisness men, womend and nieghbours to write letters to the city in
defense of me and condemning ian fraser's behavior.

personally i feel very much in danger of ian fraser. he has demonstrated
violent tendcnaies and is obsessed with me and my dog to the point
inwhich i do not know what length he will go to. he waits around my
home, he has been known to follow my movements. he is violent and
agressive and prone telling untruths and exagerations.  i feel if
something is not done that i and my dog may end up injured or killed.

i would like to thank my community of new palestine/fernwood/the hood
for coming to my assistance in this matter. i also hope that something
caan be done\
concerning ian fraser of "victoria animal control services" and his
violence and targettig of individuals before someone is injured or
killed for i do not feel and he should be in the postion of "victoria
animal control services". his removal would be of great benifit to the
safety and lives of victorians and their animal companions.  he is going
to hurt someone very seriously one day unless something is done soon. i
fear that that the lives indanger are myself and my buddy, as well.

you assistance would be much appreciated

the sounds are combinations of filters/effects/solarparticles/'music'
the electrospherical local membrane is altered by metal strings
these interact with the antenna field coupling and uncoupling
as performer/technician, i was not grounded, due to the rocky creekbed
there were ravens in the area
the usual spherics/spikes are audible in a number of instances
i think of this as my _cosmic swirl_
we interact everyday with electromagnetic fields of varying strength
we are penetrated by these fields
this is my _cosmic ode_ to the wondrous fields around us
this is truly my _cosmic _music of the spheres__

Come on, Chris. Having lived in nyc since before 9/11 I can't imagine living
anywhere else, and feel more hostility and alienation outside of nyc. Then
again, I usually don't hang out in Queens. This has to do with knowing when
to keep your mouth shut and what bars to hang out in. It is your own guilty
conscience keeping you away, and you are the threat to yourself--don't blame
ny, and don't blame firefighters or police.

Subject: Nine Eleven and a Threat to One's Person, Just Months After

On December 29th 2001 I was joined by my friend and cousin by marriage John=
 Gioia to a bar (it shall remain nameless) in Queens in order to visit with=
 a friend, Jillian Johnson, who was tending bar that evening. She closed at=
 4 and we stayed after to chat, then John left (his wife Jackie was pregnan=
t at the time) but I stayed and went back to her apartment since she was ha=
ving a few people over to close the night/morning out with. These people we=
re one NYC firefighter and one NYC police officer (names unremembered, face=
s too, even under the auspices of what is about to happen). I was drinking =
heavily that night, I believe these guys were too, and Jillian had only a f=
ew beers.

The conversation had turned to Afghanistan and bin Laden and because I am p=
rofoundly anti-Bush and anti-(anything)American (besides the people and the=
 hopes of the activists) I opened my mouth a little too wide that evening. =
To sum up, I had pinned blame on the Bush Administration and that invading =
Afghanistan (even though it was a premature thought, but one I still believ=
e in today) and putting blame on others that were not apprently certain, wa=
s, truly, unpatriotic and umAmerican (now I believe it is totally American)=
. What persisted after the fact were threats: the NYC police officer threat=
ed to shoot me with his "issued" gun, off duty or not, and the fire fighter=
 grew to enormous proportions and threated to beat the living shit out of m=
e.=20

Agreeably, it was a strange time, a difficult time, but I wasn't backing do=
wn because it was the will of the many (who were, obviously, misinformed an=
d volatile because they had no idea what was the reality). I did have a bre=
akdown that night, Jillian helped me through it, and I felt guilty about le=
aving NYC the year before to move to Baltimore. And she kept telling me to =
just go along with what they say, because they were her friends and she fel=
t it too. I was sad but it could have been selfish to think that I left NYC=
 and was no longer a part of the impact of these events. I was no longer a =
New Yorker after these events. And when I go home I no longer feel like a N=
ew Yorker, even though I spent my whole life their, grew up there, made a c=
hoice to stay alive there.

What are these feelings now that well up in me, where I feel I no longer ha=
ve a choice about my relationship with NY? Am I no longer a New Yorker? Do =
I no longer have a home?


Chris

All - I'm not blaming ALL police and ALL firemen, just these two guys who t=
hreatened my life! It's not these guys that have kept me away (I've come ba=
ck, damnit, plenty of times, and it's the only place honestly I feel safe! =
It's just a question of citizenship, you know, this idea that I wasn't (dir=
ectly) part of the trauma, just emotionally, and I didn't go back until Oct=
ober. It's just a question of belonging and how folks have changed and how =
the city has changed, not the NYPD or NYFD - GOD NO!=20

I regret totally posting these feelings because they were immediate. Disreg=
ard. It's too late to disregard.

Alan,
I read the first ten pages of "Travels with Charley" and vowed to drink =
more and read less, boring book from a great writer, proving for me that =
even the supremely talented have bad hair days. =20

Sorry to report this, and you know I love you and you are welcome to my =
home so you can hit me on the chin for saying this, but I was tired of =
"Travels with Alan" after the second posting.  I'd have been a lot =
happier had you taken an SSt and flown in the opposite direction.=20

Do this for me:  find me the essence of the people in a spot where you =
are, and keep yourselves out of the matter.  I don't need to see Alan or =
"his" in strange places.  I need to know that you can and do see, feel, =
hear, taste and touch the human element of the locals you encounter. =20

From what I see and feel of your reports, you remain =
disassociated...stop that!  Get the fuck out there and mingle, make some =
painful contacts. =20

And Alan, don't find for me some forlorn or forsaken writer in your =
travels, hell creeps like me are all over Poetics.  Find for me some =
skinny chap who loves his dog more than himself and spends all his =
income buying the canine pal only good food, depriving himself of his =
daily bread.  And help me understand his motivation.

 Find for me the lady who still wears her wedding gown from the day she =
was left standing on the church steps.  Let me hear her laughter from =
the recognition of her good fortune at having shed herself of the twit.=20

Get your ass off the back end of the camera and sit on the fucking =
bench; feed the pigeons and embrace the people who sit beside =
you...then, share their experiences with us, if at all possible, share =
their joys and their sorrows, if they'll let you in on them.  =20

Other wise...hurry the fuck home and end this travel charade.=20

no i don't sense the world and yes i do play currently a regal mandolin as
i have said. but then do you sense spherics? i'm certainly not a poet; i
find what i find and bring it back/curtail.
re the other a.s. i'm not the slightest bit interested in you're telling
me i'm 'disassociated.' first, you don't know me, and i probably wouldn't
be welcome in fact anywhere in your vicinity. second, you must have a
narrow view of association; you've already lectured me earlier on my not
take backways (which i've done innumerable times); i'm just not fulfilling
your fantasy in this case. i think the images and orderings are in fact
interesting in and of themselves; they show the changing topography of the
country, not to mention the changing topography of both rest-stops and
places that are reasonably remote from powerlines as to create clearspace
for vlf signals.
and b.m. - 'do i sense the world'? again what sort of question this is. i
certainly don't sense it the way you do and i don't see a split between
synthesizer or poet that warrants the first question.
interesting to me that neither of you, in what i see as an attack since
i'm diassociated and don't sense apparently - that neither of you
commented at all on the mapping.
as far as 'painful contacts' - who the hell are you to know who my
contacts are or of what sort? i don't write ad hominem to you - in fact i
couldn't care less about your personality or what you experience. you
didn't like what i did, period, and turned it into the usual ad hominem.
at the moment your contact in fact is the most painful i've had in a long
time, particularly in terms of its presumption.
generally i don't publish any more to this list, and for obvious reasons.
you'd rather attack than in fact dig the mapping - which by the way is a
relatively new program (Worldwind 1.3.1.1 for those who care - it now
admits those archives it bypassed in the past 1.3 or 1.3.1 version so
download it from the NASA site) -
ah well, thanks for the invective, time to go nomail.

hey saliby:
normally i don't get involved in these types of fracas, but you seem
to cling to a very narrow and sentimental model of "travel
literature" which has multiple problems of its own.  why should
people write the way you tell them to? that seems against the
principles of freedom of expression or, as we in the univ system say,
it's an "academic freedom" issue.

Yes, Jonathan Skinner launched the book last night at Tanya and Taylor
Brady's. A good reading - a marvelous ear for quite particular sounds
(birds, ducks, freight trains) crossing the land and great eye for the
particulars within  particulars (cactus, milk weed, etc.). A politics of
affirming and sustaining the local in the broadest sense available to ones
senses.
It will be fun to see how Jonathan's reach and insight continues to grow.

'Teleporting' over the internet

http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/4102018.stm

Computer scientists in the US are developing a system which would allow
people to "teleport" a solid 3D recreation of themselves over the
internet.

Professors Todd Mowry and Seth Goldstein of Carnegie Mellon University
in Pennsylvania think that, within a human generation, we might be able
to replicate three-dimensional objects out of a mass of material made
up of small synthetic "atoms".

Cameras would capture the movement of an object or person and then this
data would be fed to the atoms, which would then assemble themselves to
make up an exact likeness of the object.

They came up with the idea based on "claytronics," the animation
technique which involves slightly moving a model per frame to animate
it.

"We thought that a good analogy for what we were going to do was
claymation - something like the Wallace and Gromit shows," Dr Mowry
told BBC World Service's Outlook programme.

"When you watch something created by claymation, it is a real object
and it looks like it's moving itself. That's something like the idea
we're doing... in our case, the idea is that you have computation in
the 'clay', as though the clay can move itself.

"So if it was a dog, and you want the dog to move, it will actually
move itself. But it is a physical object in front of you - it's not
just a picture or hologram or something like that."

Special suit

Fans of science fiction have long been interested in the idea of
teleportation - where an object, or even a human being, is transported
from one location to another instantaneously.

Professor Goldstein has envisioned that, eventually, the objects will
be built with "nano-dust" - tiny objects that can be programmed to bind
to each other and move - but currently they are trying to build at a
much larger scale, working with objects the size of table-tennis balls.

Their original plan was for the application to work in face-to-face
interaction.

Model of Gollum from Lord Of The Rings
The technology mirrors that used to create the character of Gollum
"I'm in Pittsburgh, and you're in London. How do we make that happen?"
Dr Mowry said.

"We can't teleport somebody - nobody's going to travel anywhere - but
if we're in our own rooms a system of cameras will capture exactly
what's in each room."

He said that these cameras would work much the same way as the
character of Gollum was created by capturing the movements of actor
Andy Serkis in the Lord Of The Rings films.

Mr Serkis wore a special suit and the cameras were able to interpret
his movements.

"That information is turned into some representation - a
three-dimensional version of an mpeg [computer video file] - like a
DVD," Dr Mowry added.

"You capture it digitally, ship it over across the network, and then
reproduce a physical object that looks just like the original object,
and moves just like it."

And he stressed this would be useful for much more than simple video
conferencing.

"It's very artificial to talk to somebody through a glass wall, which
is effectively what you have when you have a screen," he added.

"You want to forget the fact that you're in different rooms."

This is all a conspiracy being hoisted on us by the weight-loss and botox
industries! Or, Adobe is already developing photo shop "self-readjustment
software" in order to "self teleport" and just look "nice" as one steers
one's body around a visit to the party that 2010  ecological issues
(pollution, gas rations, etc.) would make it otherwise impossible for one to
attend. I am assuming you can animate your 3-self with your voice from home
and carry on conversations with folks sipping drinks, etc.
Ah, 21st century delights. Thanks, Miekal!

Portuguese Poet Andrade Dies at 82
-
Monday, June 13, 2005

(06-13) 09:28 PDT LISBON, Portugal (AP) --

Eugenio de Andrade, one of Portugal's most revered poets, died Monday
after a long illness, said a poetry foundation devoted to his work.
He was 82.

Andrade, who won numerous awards for his work, died in Porto at the
Eugenio de Andrade Foundation where he had been living in the past
decade, the foundation said. It did not provide any additional
details.

Andrade — whose real name was Jose Fontinhas — was born in 1923. He
wrote his first poems at the age of 13, and his work was first
published at age 16. His 1948 book "As Maos e os Frutos," or The
Hands and the Fruits, garnered significant praise from members of the
Portuguese literary establishment.

He went on to write more than 30 books of poetry and prose, many of
them — including the award-winning "Os Sulcos da Sede," or "The
Streaks of Thirst" — translated into languages ranging from English
to Chinese.

The honors he won included a 1986 International Association of
Literary Critics award and a 1989 Portuguese Association of Writers'
award.

Despite the relative fame his work earned him in his native land,
Andrade largely stayed out of view, rarely appearing in public.

On Monday, European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso called
Andrade "a great personality of Portuguese culture."

Fellow poet Manuel Alegre said Andrade was "one of the greatest poets
of the Portuguese language."

"Today is a day of mourning for Portuguese poetry," he said.

A funeral for Andrade, who was not married and had not children, was
to take place Tuesday in Porto.

hi all,

i'm preparing for publication boog's first single-author perfect-bound book,
Sean Cole's The December Project, and i'm looking for a printer. the only thing
to note is that i'm hoping for the book to have a textured cardstock cover (like
black sparrow and the hat, among others), so this should open up the printer
possibilities.

you can backchannel me to editor@boogcity.com with any suggestions.

thanks!
david

Dear Friends:

Some quick news. Rattapallax's reading during the RNC
last year was featured in a new documentary produced
by the Sundance Channel. The film is called THE FIRST
AMENDMENT PROJECT and is directed by John Walter (who
previously directed "How to Draw a Bunny." Other
film-makers include Mario Van Peebles and Chris
Hegedus & Nick Doob ("The War Room").

Also, please join us for a poetry reading featuring
Willie Perdomo. Tuesday, June 21 at 7:00 p.m. in the
little theatre. Poetry in the Branches at Port
Richmond Library, 75 Bennett Street, Staten Island,
(718.442.0158), NYC.
Free.

Lastly, Rattapallax has created a new imprint
dedicated to Spoken Word called Cypher. The first
collection we are publishing is "Zaatardiva" by Suheir
Hammad. More info at
http://www.rattapallax.com/cypher.htm

Fresh from her Tony-Award winning stint in Def Poetry
Jam on Broadway and a subsequent 51-city tour, Suheir
Hammad has written her first collection of poetry
since Born Palestinian, Born Black, published when she
was just 22 years old. Zaatardiva is poetry about
love, politics and art, all coming out of Hammad's bag
of zataar. The poems in this collection are at once
seductive and dangerous; they are possessed by a
singular lyricism and awareness, and her call to
action has a major presence in her work. The
collection will include a CD and available in October
2005.

More info at www.rattapallax.com

Cheers
Ram Devineni
Publisher

Ever since i established Segnis Poetry Club in Feb. 23, 2004. I have been
funding it basicly because of my interest in poetry, beacause I realised the
need to have an online poetry Institution in Nigeria. Though, i have been
organising
events to reach out to more people,and I have been getting the public
attention, which is a good result (Over 125 full members Registered).
    But I have along term goal for SEGNIS POETRY CLUB (SPC) and they
include:
-Having a Standard Website, on which Poetry competitions,Haiku, Publications
and other poetic Links can be updated. Above all,We are looking at the
prospect of Driving the public sectors, Entrepreneurs and Globacom Nig.
Ltd.(ATelecom Giant in Nigeria) into it, through a friend.
    And our Blueprints to Convince them are:
-International exposure of poetry club for people to reckon with us. The
need to attend Work shops, Poetries and literary Festivals and exchange
ideas with poets all around the world. These shall bring more fame and
claims to international certificates which we can tender to Prompt potential
sponsors.





My names are Oluwasegun babafemi Oke
I am a Representative of Segnis Poetry Club, Lagos, Nigeria.
Having been through it tall, I decided to establish it in 2004, Because
poetry was dying at the time. The important of poetry can not be clouded.
But the main reason of writting you this mail is to extend our wish to
participate in your poetry sympossium, contest, Events e.t.c.
We shall be very grateful if our request was favoured. We shall be
looking forward to the letter of invitation, and application of Visas.

I have a theory that all the "Nigerian scam-e-mails" are actually
perpetrated by members of the Mississippi KKK - it's the organization's
modern version of an old fashioned minstrel show.
Whether or not that's true, it seems the site is a legit outlet for amateur
poets - and just that. The supporting porno, etc. ads indicate the cost of
getting a websit or blog online in Nigeria.

Which is to say, Peter, if you are not familiar with Nigerian poets and
poetry in English - which I suspect you are - it's a pretty well established
world for a longtime now - Wole Soyinka the most well known big name. But
poetry - from somebody who once taught in Nigeria - is very much alive, as
is theater, music, etc. And the last thing to be confused with those scams.

For a counter-poetic observation:

=B3We say we are in Mesopotamia [Iraq] to develop it for the benefit of the
world. [A]ll experts say that the labour supply is the ruling factor in its
development. How far will the killing of ten thousand villagers and
townspeople this summer hinder the production of wheat, cotton, and oil? Ho=
w
long will we permit millions of . . . [dollars], thousands of . . . troops,
and tens of thousands of Arabs to be sacrificed on behalf of . . . [an]
administration which can benefit nobody but its administrators?"

And guess who said that!.... Lawrence of Arabia in 1920.

It is from:
T. E. Lawrence, =B3A Report on Mesopotamia,The Sunday Times [London], August
22, 1920, World War I Document Archive, February 10, 1996,

 Is Vice President Cheney actually alive or is that a robot speaking all
those =B3Iraq things-going-well=B2 seemingly prerecorded pieces of =B3happy talk=B2=
?
Cheney=B9s behavior has me wondering about those Defense Department contracts
for robot development in Silicon Valley. Remote controlled Voice-over chips

given his history, may still be what the robot industry calls =B3a natural=B2!

CRIBS, by Yunte Huang, has arrived (well, the first two copies).

For fans of blurbs, there are three barn-burners by Marjorie Perloff,
Forrest Gander, and Rob Wilson.

For fans of poetry, there are "Think Haiku, Act Locu," "Tofu Your Life,"
"The Liver Failure of Poetry," and many more.

The book combines mad puns with sane meditations on immigration,
language, and many manners of cribbing.

Poetry:
Company of Moths by Michael Palmer
Hieratic, hypnotic, at times apocalyptic, Palmer's 10th volume (his
first
since 2001) offers more of the serious pleasures and delvings that have
won
him admiration over 30 years. The four sequences here (almost all in
unrhymed couplets) sometimes recall techniques of meditation; his
tracings
and gestures recall choreography (Palmer's other profession), too,
envisioning "the dance// of the thing and its name,/ lost limb and its
shadow," or chasing a lost blackbird through a seascape of dreams.
Despite
their mysterious feel, the poems also produce stern millennial
foreboding:
"Letter to a Vagrant" cautions against "new slings, new arrows,/ new
weapons
of mass affection," and instructs "prepare to board the burning boat."

Scarlet Tanager by Bernadette Mayer
Mayer's first book of new verse since 1998 shows her ease in many poetic
forms, her attraction to New York City and to the Berkshires (where she
now
lives), her recovery from a recent stroke and her continued enthusiastic
enmeshment with writing itself. Mayer (Midwinter Day) begins with 25
pages
of brief poems she calls epigrams, some witty, some musical, some
playfully
bizarre. The bigger, freer poems that follow (several of them
collaborations) include apparent nonsense ("leopard/ yodeled alleluias,
vehement borax after reaching/ the extraterrestrials") but also talky,
enthusiastic odes ("This Is a Problem-Solving Dream Where the Group
Attempts
to Change the Language"), charming verse dialogues ("House, I am gay";
"I am
too"), free-verse sonnets, diary-poems and work based on found texts
("Before Sextet," a riff on condom-use instructions). Above all, the
collection highlights the rambles, digressions and whimsies on which
Mayer's
style depends.

My Sweet Unconditional by Ariel Robello
In her debut collection of poems, My Sweet Unconditional, ariel robello
meets us at the horizon, where worlds blend in the blush of sunrise and
sunset, where land meets sea, air -- earth, and where man and machine
interrupt the natural ebb and flow of life. Unapologetic, she declares
her
faith in a love that defies borders and with each poem she weds herself
to a
belief that unconditional love can still be found in the cracks of an
urban
sidewalk, dancing above puffing smoke stacks, behind a guerilla's
mask...

Graphic Novels:
Walt and Skeezix, edited by Chris Ware
Chris Ware has often cited Gasoline Alley as one of his favorite comic
strips ever, and he has lovingly edited and designed Walt & Skeezix:
Book
One, the first-ever collection of the classic newspaper strip created by
one
of the pioneering giants of American comic strips, Frank King. Not only
does
this volume reprint the first two years of the strip in which King's
friendly and nostalgic imagination took shape but each book in the
series
features an eighty-page color introduction by Jeet Heer of Canada's
National
Post. Each introduction will also feature never-before-seen archival
photos
and ephemera from the personal collection of King's granddaughter. Walt
&
Skeezix is not just a collection of a classic comic strip-it is the
story of
a great American cartoonist.

The Murder of Abraham Lincoln by Rick Geary
This latest volume of Geary's series A Treasury of Victorian Murder is a
must-read for those who are only familiar with cursory details of
Lincoln's
assassination. Geary's meticulous research and vivid illustrations
create a
fascinating narrative that covers the 62 days between March 4 and May 4,
1865, and provide a wealth of information on murderous thespian and
Southern
loyalist John Wilkes Booth and his co-conspirators, some of whom backed
out
of the assassination plot. Geary paints Booth as a man with an
exorbitant
need for attention and aggrandizement. History shows he achieved the
attention he sought, but rather than being hailed as a hero to the
South,
Booth found himself regarded as an utter villain by those whose favor he
hoped to garner. Geary also gives much attention to the bizarre elements
of
the case, such as Lincoln's ominous dreams of his own death, the strange
actions of Secretary of War Edwin McMasters Stanton and the shockingly
lax
security around the president, all the more alarming when coupled with
obvious hints beforehand that something foul was afoot in the capital.

Spaniel Rage by Vanessa Davis
Davis's principal character is a young woman whose Renoiresque form
belies
her seething inner life... The quotidian structure of much of Spaniel
Rage
presents the reader with glimpses of a young woman's meandering path
into
adulthood in this beautifully drawn, intelligent portrait of self coming
into its own.

Earthboy Jacobus by Doug TenNapel
Chief Edwards retires from the Modesto Police Department, doomed to face
a
life of loneliness and insignificance. Everything changes when Chief
hits a
flying whale with his car. When he opens the beast's mouth, he finds a
boy
from a parallel universe named Jacobus.

Tommysaurus Rex by Doug TenNapel
Ely is an everyboy trying to cope with the death of his dog Tommy. When
he
finds a live, 40-foot Tyrannosaurus Rex trapped in a cave behind his
grandfather's house, Ely embarks on an adventure to tame this seemingly
friendless giant, convince the town his new pet isn't a threat and keep
his
dinosaur safe from the jealous town bully.

Paul Moves Out by Michel Rabagliati
This charming sequel to Paul Has a Summer Job continues Rabagliati's
heavily
autobiographical look at his days as a young adult in Montreal. Here, we
see
Paul at design school, falling under the spell of a charismatic teacher,
and
meeting and eventually moving in with Lucie, a fellow student who
impresses
him with her knowledge of Tintin. Rabagliati covers everything in a
nostalgic glow, so even an episode when the teacher makes a pass at him
comes off as a simple misunderstanding rather than a sordid event. The
story
is episodic, following such tiny everyday scenes as a scary handyman who
destroys Paul and Lucie's bathroom while trying to kill a rat, the death
of
a favorite aunt and a weekend spent babysitting some kids.

Der Struwwelmaakies by Tony Millionaire
The next volume in Millionaire's twisted series, The Maakies.

Peculia and the Groon Grove Vampires by Richard Sala
Night is coming and the local babysitters club needs an extra sitter.
That
strange new family in town is expecting four warm bodies, not three --
one
for each member of their household. Each sharp-toothed, blood-thirsty,
downright undead member of their household.

Negative Burn, Winter 2005 anthology
Perhaps the most eccentric anthology in the history of comics, Negative
Burn
is an anomaly, merging together genres, pushing boundaries and allowing
the
top comic book talent in the world the opportunity to experiment with
unique
stories. Never to follow a course, each volume of Negative Burn presents
the
biggest stars in the industry today while continuing to showcase the
next
wave of new talent. Some of the stories featured are: "Milk and Cheese"
by
Evan Dorkin, "Mr. Glum" by Erik Larsen, "Sketchbook" by Vince Locke,
"Hawaiian Dick" by B. Clay Moore and Shawn Crystal.

Hutch Owen: Unmarketable!! by Tom Hart
Four years after The Collected Hutch Owen was nominated for best
collected
edition by the Harvey, Eisner, and Ignatz awards, creator Hart returns
with
192 new pages featuring the personality that Savant magazine describes
as
"so accurately dead-on that it's scary... His refusal to become antoher
interchangeable part in society's machine is believable, amusing, and
intensely applicable at the same time."

Books for Saucy:
2006 Wine Buying Guide for Everyone by Andrea Immer Robinson
The first guide to buying wine that grades the top-selling premium wines
in
stores and restaurants: popular supermarket brands, trade-up brands, and
super-premium labels. Andrea Immer, one of America's foremost wine
authorities, surveyed thousands of wine professionals and ordinary
consumers, who assess what really matters most-taste and value for the
money.

Great Wine Made Simple: Straight Talk from a Master Sommelier by Andrea
Immer Robinson (INTERVIEW POSSIBILITY)
About one-third of the way through Andrea Immer's Great Wine Made
Simple,
the author recounts an anecdote that could serve as the book's
theme--alligator, rabbit, and squab were all introduced to her the same
way:
"Tastes like chicken." And as demonstrated by Immer, who went from
debentures to de Rothschild when she quit Morgan Stanley to eventually
oversee the 50,000-bottle cellar at Manhattan's famed Windows on the
World,
the leap from pigeon to Pichon-Lalande is analogous: teaching novice
wine
drinkers what to expect is what her book, aptly subtitled "Straight Talk
from a Master Sommelier", is all about.

Read it and Eat: A Month-by-Month Guide to Scintillating Book Club
Selections and Mouthwatering Menus by Sarah Gardner
Why order pizza while discussing Barbara Ehrenrich's Nickel and Dimed
when
you can eat like the characters in the book (Pasta on a Tight Budget)?
Gardner, publisher of the bimonthly newsletter The Literary Gathering,
plans
out a year's worth of books and menus for book clubs. The books (four
per
month) range from classic to contemporary, and encompass fiction and
nonfiction; the accompanying themed menus are made up of generally
uncomplicated fare. Gardner also includes discussion questions for each
book. September honors Celebrate Banned Books Week, with suggestions for
reading The Color Purple (and eating Southern foods, like Harpo's
Fountain 7
UP Cake). Some book choices are unusual (Geshundeit!, a health book by
Patch
Adams); others predictable (Angela's Ashes, by Irishman Frank McCourt,
in
March; Gone with the Wind for February romance); and a few accompanying
meal
suggestions are a stretch (The Catcher in the Rye features some
peripheral
characters from Buffalo, NY, so Gardner suggests readers try some of the
city's specialty foods, like Roast Beef on Kimmelweck).

The Perfect Buzz: The Essential Guide to Boozing, Bars, and Bad Behavior
by
David Bramwell
Anyone can sip a beer or down a shot, but The Perfect Buzz teaches the
subtle art of drinking, with tips, tricks, and trivia that will liven up
any
night out, including:

    * Knowing what to order from whiskey to organic beers
    * Ordering a beer in twenty-five languages, so you can quench your
thirst anytime, anywhere
    * Improving your dating technique with dozens of pickup lines way
cooler
than "You come here often?"
    * Rules for pool, darts, and Foosball so you can hold your own in
any
challenge
    * Tons of bar tricks and drinking games that will keep you
entertained
for hours.

Noble Rot: A Bordeaux Wine Revolution by William Echikson
In vino veritas. Yet as Echikson (Burgundy Stars) shows in this
entertaining
journey through Bordeaux's wine-making landscape, the truth of wine is
also
highly subjective and subject to change. Bordeaux has long epitomized
fine
wine. In 1662, Echikson relates, the English diarist Samuel Pepys
described
"a sort of French wine called Ho Bryan that hath a good and most
particular
taste...." This Haut-Brion was the first Bordeaux wine; it would soon
join a
handful of other chateaux that became the coveted "first growths."
Indeed,
Thomas Jefferson noted there were "four vineyards of first quality":
Margaux, Latour, Lafite and Haut-Brion. After a rigid classification
system
was imposed in 1855, it seemed likely that the French reverence for
tradition would make "innovative Bordeaux" an oxymoron. Over the last
several decades, however, some revolutionary "garagistes" (garage wine
makers) have begun using new growing and wine-making techniques to show
the
world that less than perfect land and less than blue blood can yield
extraordinary wines.

Paper's 'wikitorial' trial halted

http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/4114312.stm


Wikis encourage people to collaboratively create and re-create a webpage
US newspaper, The Los Angeles Times, has temporarily ended its
short-lived trial which gave readers the chance to edit its editorials
on its website.

The online version of the paper started its "wikitorial" experiment
last week. It was meant to give readers a "voice".

It was suspended after it was bombarded with inappropriate material.
But the paper said it might try the idea again.

Wikis, from the Hawaiian "wiki wiki" meaning "quick", let people
collectively change or add to webpages.

They have spawned collectively written encyclopedias, cookbooks and
other publications.

In a statement, The LA Times said the wikitorial would stay offline
while it looked at what happened and how to prevent it from happening
again.

It said: "We thank the thousands of people who logged onto the
Wikitorial in the right spirit."

'Bold experiment'

The plan for its editorial wiki was to explore a new form of opinion
journalism, but the editors admitted it could end up as "an
embarrassment".

The idea, which commentators have called "bold", was the brainchild of
Michael Newman, deputy editor of the editorial page.

Wikipedia has been running since 2001 and is in several languages
In Friday's edition, the paper said, in theory, a wikitorial would be
"a constantly evolving collaboration among readers in a communal search
for truth."

The editors planned to have the original published piece sit alongside
the finished, collectively re-edited version.

Almost 1,000 people registered to take part in re-writing the paper's
editorial, War and Consequences, on Friday.

Participants added internet links to various words in the editorial,
while others proposed alternative views on the subject.

One split the editorial in half, which was welcomed by the editors. But
they decided to end the trial early on Sunday after explicit photos
were posted to the page.

Monitoring editors struggled to keep up with the influx of material
that overwhelmed the site.

The unusual experiment was overseen by editors, as well as Wikipedia
founder Jim Wales.

Wikis could be brought back to the website with a limited group of
contributors or with a Times employee reviewing changes before they
could be displayed, said the paper.

Matter of trust

The BBC's H2G2 website - Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy - was put
together in a similar fashion to wikis. It is written, edited and
checked by ordinary web users.

Another successful example of a wiki is Wikipedia, which was started in
2001. It is a multi-lingual encyclopedia to which anyone can edit or
post entries.

It currently contains about 602,900 articles on anything from silicon
chips to kittens.

Wikis use open source software to collaboratively write and re-write
what others have published.

Much of the idea relies on trust and small groups of informal editors
who oversee edited entries to ensure accuracy and relevance.

Like weblogs, wikis have started to become popular online as people
find new ways to create and experiment with reader-generated content.

Subject:      Kimmelman's SOMEHOW Track 1
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII



        The 45 poems in Burt Kimmelman's SOMEHOW [Marsh Hawk Press 2005]
belong together and have a beautiful underlying coherence,
a sense of what one sees and hears, an awareness of perception as part of
the song, or as it emerges in his poem  "The Valentine's Day"
"song's wary small loveliness."

                The sun fills up the street, the trees and
                the thick air, fat and fresh with the good.
                All the birds are coming to the blood


                of Spring, the sacrifice
                                        cut days in sand.
                Warm birds isn the withering
                                        light, bland

                hollow in the heart, stone, pride and food


                on the harrowing wing. Find bow, brood
                agon done, penance paid in Winter's hand.
                All music in our heart's sand, sun's though


                heaving verges of old madcness, hunt
                dearness, song's wary small loveliness
                the slackened foot, eye's nearness; light, our shunt-
                ing out heart's hunger, our variedness.
                Sure touch of hand, bow in gladness brought

I sensed the rhythms of the poem better after reading it a second
time,but this time after hearing the epigraphs from Chaucer and Zukofsky.
The epigraphs are subtle choices, and deserve a track of their own.

Take care, song that what stars' imprint you mirror
Grazes their tears; draw speech from their nature or
Love in you--faced to your outer stars--purer
Gold than tongues make without feeling
Art new, hurt old: revealing
The slacked bow as the stinging
Animal dies, thread gold stringing
The fingerboard pressed to my honor

foot...fingerboard... sure touch of hand, bow in gladness bought..}

MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

Folks,

I'm putting some last touches on a book-manuscript
entitled "Behind the Lines: War Resistance Poetry in the
U.S.," and re-working a chapter proposing a reexamination of
the "archive" of war resistance and poetry, opening up our
consideration of poetry to a wider deployment of language as
symbolic action--symbolic actions such as the burning of
draft files by the Catonsville Nine, poetry events such as
readings against the war, "levitating pentagons," by Ed
Sanders and the like, the "aum's" by Ginsberg during the Dem
convention in 1968.

What I'm looking for are any anecdotes or full blown stories
from you about events you attended where poetry (in this
broad definition, language as symbolic action, or action as
symbolic language) did something, made a happening, etc.

For example, I recall reading somewhere how Jackson Mac Low's
simple reading of the names of the war purveyors at a rally
caused a near riot.

I know that, in general, there may be a feeling that this
stuff was excessive, foolish, silly, ineffectual, prankish,
etc.  That's okay by me.

Looking forward to your contribution.  If it's good, I'll
certainly find a way of including it and thanking you in the
book.  You can email me offline at pmetres@jcu.edu or if you
think it's appropriate to put on line, go for it.

Peace,

Beneath the Underground Books is proud to announce the June 22, 2005 release
of Vernon Frazer's IMPROVISATIONS. Frazer's innovative and critically
acclaimed longpoem, sections of which previously appeared in book format, is
available for the first time in its completed form.





Vernon Frazer's relentless pursuit of truth is inspiring. Improvisations
commands our attention. It is difficult to recognize a landmark work in a
landscape of hype and craftsmanship, but Frazer's embrace and reconciliation
of the conflicts between poetry and language result in a musical and visual
harmony that other poets have long neglected or sought with less success.
Improvisations is a work to learn from and to praise without hesitation.

- Michael Rothenberg


Through its sectional appearances Improvisations has consistently offered
its readers a dizzying flight across textual geographies and social aporia.
Now we can encounter and engage its full monumentality as a vast text whose
verbal excess and vertiginous typographic variations mark a stunning moment
in the history of gestural poetics. It is a true comment on what it is to
not only live modernity but to actively engage it.

- Steve McCaffery

Improvisations will take its place in the modernist, postmodernist and
alternative pantheon of masterpieces. Vernon Frazer presents us with a 'new
physics' of poetic structure. It is not contingent upon any preconceptions
of what poetry 'has been' or 'should be'. Its roots are far reaching and
ubiquitously move rhizomically beneath the surface of the poetic page. It is
there that Improvisations manifests its multi-dimensional, polyphonic,
nonlocal music-of-the-spheres resonances, echoing down cerebral corridors
and unfolding to the reader a synergistically limitless semantically rich
poetic realm.

- Ric Carfagna

Jesse

I hesitate to disagree with you, because... - well, on past experience, =
it is as well that we have not had nuclear weapons

nor am I really in a mood to say much or in a position to say it for =
long

but this is excessive, don't you think?

NOTHING to do with haiku?

This is how things change, someone takes a word, an idea and sees it at =
a different angle, perhaps technically a misapprehending angle, and =
makes a new connection

i imagine someone bilingual in Italian and English 500 years ago saying =
These are ok poems, to Thomas Wyatt, but theyre not sonnets. Let me =
explain. The sonnet, is an Italian form. And this anglicisation of the =
substantive just won't do...zzzzzzz

Did Scott Helms invent visual haiku? I thought I did. Seriously.=20

Actually, out of deference to the term haiku, which I do not have the =
learning to fully understand, I call my semantic haiku 575s and thus =
invented a visual version by analogy

I suspect many have invented visual haiku. Havent got it in front of me =
but Cobbing called a visual poem _sonnet_ maybe 30 years ago.

He didnt bother calling it a visual sonnet, because he didnt bother much =
with definitions; and of course there were people who were busy telling =
him it wasnt a poem - he may well have called a poem a sonnet to wind =
them up

The visual haiku is (retrospectively of course) such an obvious idea - =
sooner or later someone would do it, and it's likely to be happening and =
happening again now, with access to some knowledge of haiku and half the =
planet writing poetry

I think to attach the word _false_ to it is out of order. Where's the =
falsehood?

If you are actually going to say something about poetry, then by all =
means define terms and explain why your examples fit or don't fit them. =
That's useful, or can be, because it too shows us new ways of thinking =
about form and content. But to be including and excluding for the sake =
of it - it would perhaps be better done in private

NOTHING to do with haiku? Not conforming to the rules for sure; but =
rules usually develop with the form. i.e. they get broken / ignored. Now =
there are revised rules. What you call haiku is perhaps traditional =
haiku or Japanese haiku - I heard an Indian woman, addressing my country =
in general - "We took your language, made it our own, and now you can =
have what I think is a better English, Indian English"

Expostulation: You can't do that. Reply: I just did.

As in Walt W contradicting himself. I'd have thought it's the American =
way.

All slopes are slippery at some time. Sooner or later, poetry, having a =
visual aspect once recorded, would admit visual poetry; & if you can =
have a visual poem then you can have a visual haiku. Obviously

It isn't a falsehood but another way of looking at the underlying ideas =
as one has received interpreted and understood them. Mistales occur, of =
course. Incorporating mistakes is how we operate, why our accents differ =
etc E VO LU TION

though there may well be some single celled organisms who haven't been =
out since oxygen began to proliferate just waiting a chance to tell all =
the multi-cellular folk they have it deeply wrong and dont understand =
life forms at all

Individual examples of any innovation will be seen to be better or worse =
than each other when and if they can be compared; but rejecting the idea =
is narrowing of possibilities; and, I am pleased to say, the rejection =
will be ignored at large because it is not so much a false line, as an =
unrewarding line

all best

One way of doing haiku to dispel the fog of its everywhereness is to do it
in:

                            SYLLOGAIKU

                            All men are mortal
                            Socrates and his young men
                            Where have they all gone

MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII

I've suggested that Kimmelman in his book SOMEHOW the poem "The
Valentine's Day" responds to epigraphs from Chaucer and Zukofsky, but in
another poem, "Late June" an epigraph from Ronald Johnson seems to become
an integral part of the poem itself. In fact one can weld the two lines
of the epigraph to the opening of the poem and get a sensibly correct
reading.  The poem would then open as


                Wave of warblers weaving
                chirp chirp to message
                the day's signals, each warble,
                trill and chirp, on again, off
                again, on again, again--

The poem moves from observation to process: Stanza 2 ends:

                creatures cease their back and forth

Stanza 3
                day, another, another.

(The poem seems to consistently move toward process, and so I wish he had
left off the period.)




                LATE JUNE

                                wave of warbles weaving
                                chirp to chirp message
                                        --Ronald Johnson

                The day's signals, each warble,
                trill and chirp, on again, off
                again, on again, again--

                once the red sun has seated
                itself below the tree top
                creatures cease their back and forth

                a sudden heat gone, slight breeze
                light rendering darkness--one
                day another, another.

Can someone tell me where Hegel said this?

"The fundamental principle of Romantic art is the concentration of the soul
upon itself."

From today's Senate Hearing with Mr. Rumsfeld:

"Perhaps referring to declining support for the war, Mr. Rumsfeld mentioned
the dark days of the American revolution in 1776, and quoted President
Lincoln, who told Americans during the Civil War in 1864: 'There may be
mistakes made sometimes, and things done wrong, while the officers of the
government do all they can to prevent mistakes. But I beg of you as citizens
of this great republic, not to let your minds be carried off from the great
work we have before us'."  (NY Times, today on the web edition)

Am I confused? Rumsfeld and Company imitating Honest Abe! I know Iraq is
hemispherically south of Washington. But I don't think the Administration
has ever previously  given the impression that the United States went to war
there because Iraq had succeeded from the Union (and/or implied that we were
in a Civil War, other than maybe provoking one).  Wow! What could be the
similarities? Cotton and Oil?

"Things are getting better all the time" or "I want to get out of this
place"   What will be the song, Mr. President? This is all getting very
painful and bleak.

Bard of the back streets
Jen Jewel Brown
24jun05

Shelton Lea
Poet, publisher and fine-book dealer.
Born Melbourne, August 25, 1946.
Died Melbourne, May 13, aged 58.

RAPSCALLION, big-hearted mentor and arguably Australia's finest
romantic poet, Shelton Lea died peacefully at home in Clifton Hill,
Melbourne, on Friday, May 13. He was renowned as the beautiful,
charming, dope-smoking wag who was a close mate of Heide's Barrett
Reid (poet and librarian) and Sweeney Reed (artist and gallery
owner). He lived at Heide for years after John and Sunday Reed died,
helping Reid put out Overland magazine.

Last year Lea spoke eloquently on ABC television's Stateline about
his experiences as a 16-year-old in Pentridge, helping in the
campaign to keep children out of adult jails. Later that year, the
Victorian Children and Young Persons (Age Jurisdiction) Act 2004 was
passed, effectively extending the definition of child from 17 to 18
in several areas of the law.

Lea lived life on a grand scale. Mystery surrounds the identity of
his father, thought to have suffered a breakdown after serving in
World War II. His mother came to Melbourne from Perth in 1946 to give
birth to Shelton at the Haven, a home for unmarried mothers. The
lively boy spent the first 15 months of his life there. One carer
remembered him decades later as a delightful child, if a head-banger.

He was adopted into the Lea family of Toorak, famous for its
confectionery. At 12 he became "too close" to a chocolate factory
worker, who was accordingly fired. Distraught, Shelton told his
adoptive father "I fire you" and ran away from home, ending up in
various homes for wayward youngsters. He met Aborigines for the first
time and was made an honorary black. At 16, he ended up in
Pentridge's notorious C Division, where he witnessed rape and murder.

Time in Long Bay, Goulburn and Grafton jails followed. Lea became a
skilled pickpocket and cat burglar. He penned love poems and letters
for grateful inmates. For a time in the early 1960s he lived with
gypsies on the roads of rural Australia. After being thrown out of
Kings Cross for manufacturing LSD, he moved back to Melbourne where
he met the Heide set through sculptor Joel Elenberg.

In his 58 years Lea had children with three women. Nine books of his
poetry have been published. He is known for his articulate,
street-smart humour, his gentle love poetry and the mythic, visceral
masculinity of his visions. In a country where artists are generally
asked what their real job is, he took his poetic calling seriously. A
popular reader, he approached performance with an almost
Shakespearean bravura. He also published several other poets' books
through his imprint Eaglemont Press and ran fine bookshops including,
recently, De Havillands in Clifton Hill.

His February diagnosis of Jack Dancer (as he liked to call his lung
cancer) left him three months to live. He made the most of it,
pushing through the release of his ninth book Nebuchadnezzar (through
Black Pepper), while poems from it were accepted by The Age and The
Australian.

Nebuchadnezzar was launched by Dorothy Porter at the Rochester Castle
Hotel in Fitzroy, eight days before the poet's death. The pub
overflowed. Although he had thought he wouldn't have the breath, Lea
decided on the night to make a final, moving reading of the title
poem. In the voice (with permission) of Aboriginal identity Sonny
Booth and dedicated to Booth and Lionel Rose, the work is inspired by
the Arthur Boyd painting, Nebuchadnezzar Burning.

Shelton Lea is survived by his partner Leith Woodgate, his children
Kaye, Destiny, Danay and Zero, godson Ben, half and adopted siblings,
and grandchildren, nieces and nephews.

Ron Silliman recently suggested in his blog that a Collected Beverly Dahlen
is already long overdue - and I would agree. Today, Chris Murray, on her
tex-files  brought attention to a passage from "A Reading: 1 - 7", the first
in a series of books call "A Reading" of which I  published the first one at
Momo's Press in 1985:

the Ace is like a big heart blooming out there. and I could wish all my days
to be bound each to each. by natural piety. whatever that is, she wrote
these things are of nature. trees, rocks, flowers, a desert. have a desert,
have an ocean. think of living down there, there would be other fish
swimming around, strange plants growing. that too would be nature, let's not
be too hasty to define it. there's a thin moving line. blurred edges. if it
were there as sharply as Blake wanted who would get over the boundary in the
middle of the night. they were living close to the border in northern Italy,
'we need some new genes' he said. he remembered the nor and thought I was
Norwegian, someone from the north originally. someone, a
Svenska-Suomalainen.
all that was a foreign language, something she was learning. Navajo. o my
horse. the corn of the east. somewhere over the rainbow. blue skies. it's
shaping up and I wasn't even thinking about it. it grows. hard and soft, she
wrote. hard buds, nipples of buds. hardening. I take you. his
oleander. his skinny, the slight boy's brown body.
'the brown boy's slight body.'

(In the non-virtual world, the above text is justified to the right margin!)

 Peter Gannick's "Pots & Poets" (Sp?), and Charles Alexander's Chax Press
published the other two volumes of "A Reading". And Elizabeth Robinson's
Press (name) will be publishing a new volume in about a year. I would seek
out these books, as well.

Beverly - one of the founders - with Frances Jaffer and Kathleen Frazer - of
the journal How(ever) (sp?), is a contemporary of George Stanley, and
definitely one of the central figures (tho many years quiet until recently)
of the San Francisco poetry world. Among many, Beverly is one of those
diamonds in the rough that will increasingly rise to fill a significant
place on the late 20th century literary horizon. Like Niedecker she has kept
correspondence with many of her significant peers and elders (Oppen, Duncan,
Rachel Blau Duplessis, Stanley, among others), much of her literary life has
been counter-careerist.

I do still have copies of a Reading 1 - 7. For $12 I will be happy to
provide any and all with a copy - postage and handling included. Send checks
to me at:

3514 21st Street
San Francisco CA 94114

If you are in the San Francisco Bay Area on August 20, I will be reading
with Beverly at the Grand Street series in Oakland on that Sunday evening.

Thanks, Steven

I'm happy to match your offer and have the second book of Beverly Dahlen's
A Reading, i.e. A Reading 8-10, which Chax published, available to anyone
who sends $10 (and this will include shipping via "media mail" for domestic
USA orders). Send orders and checks to Chax Press at

101 W. Sixth St., no. 6
Tucson, AZ 85701-1000

And if you visit the Chax web site you'll also find that we published the
small volume, more recently, of Beverly Dahlen's A-Reading Spicer & 18
Sonnets, which is still available. If anyone wishes both of our Dahlen
books together, make that check for $17, and we'll take care of the
shipping charges (again, via "media mail").

"We are moving towards a new Dark Ages. With the dissolution of corporate l=

onial. Cult movements will more and more become part of the cultural terrai=
n."

Anthony Braxton, as quoted in The Wire,February,2005

In a space so small as poetry and as large as poetry makes of it.

To siphon: The explorative elements of any project (poetry being one) are s=
lowly being lost to the ends of that project, that end which points to an i=
ndividual claim.

An individual 'reserve' as some may claim, as already instituted in its rul=
es (culture of).=20

Ephemera: Lost (back catalogues, reading lists, past issues, dollar bins, d=
iscount stores, KMart, WalMart, Amazon, EBay etc etc etc etc etc).

Sell and reSell and forgetting, active, momentary, until.

Until "the next big thing comes along" preEmptiveEphemera.

Build a stockade of culture and count down the days.

The explorative elements in any project are vastly negotiated by any subscr=
iption to any institutional boundary setting.

The explorative elements of any culture can be regained when the television=

Develop a ritual without basi[c]s.

Develop a ceremonial through accidence.

Develop an occassion that lasts as long as it can be manifested in its expr=
ess, not its concept, which is, like chess (to quote Braxton, again) bound =
by simple rules but is not bound to enumeration.

Without monetary compensation for the artist. The artist becomes a citizen =
in a free transaction and trade of actions.

Actions receive other actions and continue. Actions are made possible in th=
e occassion of that action.=20

There must be two. There must always be two. One receives and two create.

There must never be a third. With the introduction of a third the two are d=
isqualified. The third gains just as much as the first and nothing is trade=
d. Actions cannot continue when there is a monetary transaction.

The two create and continue when it comes from the hands and enters another=
's hands.=20

There is distribution when there are hands.=20

There is business when there are hand-offs. Hands Off. Both literally and f=
iguratively.

Hi Aaron,

I can't place the quote, but I can recommend the "Introductory Lectures on
Aesthetics" if you're also looking for context and/or similar utterances.
The lectures (they run about 90pp in my Penguin paperback) culminate with
a discussion of the "symbolic," "classical," and "romantic" types of art.
Poetry figures prominently in the final pages:

"As regards the third and most spiritual mode of representation of the
romantic art-type, we must look for it in poetry." (95)

"Poetry is the universal art of the mind which has become free in its own
nature, and which is not tied to find its realization in external sensuous
matter, but expatiates exclusively in the inner space and inner time of
the ideas and feelings." (96)

It seems that I've been receiving many submissions for the zine series this=
 year but of every single sub, EVERY SINGLE SUB, guess how many women have =
contributed to the project?

None.

I'm sending out another call within the next few days, here it is by the wa=
y, for submissions to the zine project:


The purpose of the project is to promote the free distribution (in local ci=
ties and in public spaces) of free poetry. And everyone is invited to submi=
t.

The zines are roughly 4.25 inches (width) and 5.25 inches (height). We seek=
 submissions of 8 to 16 pages of text that fit nicely in a 4 inch by 5 inch=
 format. 120 or so zines are made, 60 being freely distributed, 10 going to=
 the contributor, and 50 bound together every year (volume one, 2004, consi=
sted of 31 zines) and sold in order to raise money to make next year's volu=
me.

Please send electronically to this address:

It ain't poetry but A progressive, well reasoned piece by Eric Gustafson on
the situation in Iraq and why an immediate withdrawal will even create more
havoc, and what has to be done to insure the USA withdrawal.

Spare Room Reading Series presents . . .

Jonathan Skinner

Reading and Publication Party

Sunday, June 26nd
7:30 pm

*Please note location*

Pacific Switchboard
4637 N. Albina Avenue=20
Portland, OR
(just south of Alberta street and just east of the I-5
freeway exit. You can reach us by taking the #4
Fessenden bus.)

FREE ADMISSION

www.flim.com/spareroom=20
spareroom@flim.com


Please join us for a reading by Jonathan Skinner to
celebrate the publication of his new book, Political
Cactus Poems (Palm Press).

Jonathan Skinner edits ecopoetics
in Buffalo, NY where he misidentifies birds along the
Niagara River.

His work engages the various meanings of life
outdoors, in the shape of a changing response to
questions posed by the environments the poet
physically inhabits. In part, the poetry operates as
an instrument of research into a particular natural=20
environment or a geological formation or species. In
exchange, it offers forms of life measured to
particular places, an invitation to inhabit the
evolutionary imagination of the senses and of
those places. His first book-length collection,=20
Political Cactus Poems, which stem from the poet's
life in the Southwest, challenges the pristine
agenda of nature poetry by hybridizing themes from the
lives of humans and cacti.

PRAISE FOR JONATHAN SKINNER'S Political Cactus Poems:=20

If cactuses could talk, poets be out of work. In the
meantime, Jonathan
Skinner's *Political Cactus Poems *are primers of
attentive engagement; not
only its pleasures responsibilities, but also its
animations and
metamorphoses. It's not just that we read what we see;
Skinner imagines that
we are read by what sees us. "Matter's clatter" is the
echo of unheard
songs. In these poems, the saguaro drinks our words=20
and leaves us thirsty
for more.

--Charles Bernstein

This is *Very* *Good* (*that's* *WHY* *I* *used* *it*
when I taught at
Mills, his *Little* *Dictionary* *Of* *Sounds*--I
played the *Tape* *Of* *The=20
Sounds* & GAVE THEM THE POEMS *he* *had*
*written*!--*I* *didn't* *have* *to
* *TEACH*!!) -- *'VOCABULARY'* + *'STUDY'* (somehow)
Evidences *THE* *WORLD*
*AT* *LARGE* in ManyWritten Poems--BRAVO!!

--Robert Grenier

The fact is, humanity's a drop in the bucket. But only
scantily has poetry
looked at the rest of the bucket. Jonathan Skinner in
*Political Cactus
Poems* makes a wonderful stab in that omnidirection.=20
The language lays out
its dynamics "as if" human and nature were one. The
reader feels
connections' displays not so much in terms of grammar
as of a great series
of metonymic grids, that feel like chemistry. Meanings=20
dance rather than
submit to linear equations. On p. 33 one of Skinner's
dense but unadorned
"tope prisms" ends
"spots taking on chronologies of their own
expanding in a series of rotational slides=20
not yet confirmed. For the individual,
stationary in the blast of current events
no true point of balance is ever found."
Mostly, they show-don't-tell. These down-to-earth
cylinders, pulled from the
air, are forwarding explorations in the most important
direction poetry
can go: out. Yet they're plenty human and fun to read.

A macro-micro delight.

--Jack Collom

Jonathan Skinner with his journal *ecopoetics *has=20
been showing us how it is
all connected. all systemic, all wonderful even while
at risk. The poems in
*Political Cactus Poems *do similar work as they tell
the sad stories of
contemporary politics (Milosevic and Bush show up at=20
various moments) with
the specific stories of various cacti. These poems
direct and redirect our
attention to the larger ethical issues of political
and natural
environments. They are tight, luminous poems that=20
illustrate how the world
is more complicated than most of us acknowledge.

MIME-Version: 1.0

Adam Phillips: We might look to poetry now because poetry is  marginalised -
which is the best thing about it! It's freeing people  actually to be able to
work their own way. People are only going to be poets now  if they really want
to be. There's no money in it and very little glamour. That  seems to be
promising. The only pay-off of being a poet now is writing a good  poem. And this
seems to hold within itself the possibility that people will be  freer with
their own thoughts. They'll be less preoccupied by being winning, or  by being
charming or indeed by selling anything, because they've got nothing to  sell. I
think the new thing that might be happening is that the new sane artist  will
not be seeking recognition. That is whereas the mainstream of artists will
be seeking recognition, fame and fortune, the new sane artist will have to
dispense with precisely that quest to do their work.

Melvyn Bragg: Why is that important?

Adam Phillips: Because it frees you. Because once you relinquish the market
(and that doesn't mean you don't earn your living), once you relinquish the
saleability of your art now, you're now freer to have your own thoughts.
Because, insofar as you're interested in marketing your thoughts, you have to be
pre-occupied by a fantasy of what people want. It makes you compliant; it makes
 you inevitably servile to a fancy of the audience. Whereas if you have no
audience, that interest drops out.

Subject:      the first anthology of its kind:  EVERYTHING I HAVE IS BLUE
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="US-ASCII"
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

Anyone interested in a GLBT anthology which deals with real people in the
real world, this is the first:  EVERYTHING I HAVE IS BLUE, an anthology of
writing by working class gay men.

In this age of wanton exchange of capital, there are those in the queer
community who are especially aggressive in proving that they and their other
fancy queer friends are worthy citizens by displaying their large,  secure
Purchase Powers at the expense of anyone and everything.  And  they seem more than
willing to do all they can to denounce,  ignore, even destroy the larger GLBT
community to assure their hetero board  members, CEOs, mayors, state and
national leaders, that the fringe of the GLBT  community will be quietly replaced
from the head of every significant position  of authority in the community.  We
are witness to an astonishing hostile  takeover, so to speak, and being mutated
to reflect the fascist powers  which now control this divided country.  We
must stop it, now!

This anthology is part of that need and that cry to stop it now!  In  doing
so, in at least speaking out as proud working class queer people in the  age of
Paris Hilton as superstar, we can hopefully allow other working class  voices
to speak up once again.  We have much lost ground to regain, and  time's
a-wasting, as my grandma would say.

Here's the official publishers website, just released today:
_http://www.suspectthoughts.com/pressblue.htm_ (http://www.suspectthoughts.com/pressblue.htm)

Granted, the words above were written by me, and not by the publisher or
editor of this anthology, but I believe that they agree with what I say, and
what dangers we face, and what we must start to do to survive, and recreate a
community worthy of the word community,

They hang the man and flog the woman
That steal the goose from off the common,
But let the greater villain loose
That steals the common from the goose.

".....at a time when I am speaking to you about the paradox of desire -- in
the
sense that different goods obscure it -- you can hear outside the awful
language
of power.  There's no point in asking whether they are sincere or
hypocritical,
whether they want peace of whether they calculate the risks.  The dominating
impression as such a moment is that something that may pass for a prescribed
good; information addresses and captures impotent crowds to whom it is poured

forth like a liquor that leaves them dazed as they move toward the slaughter
house.
One might even ask if one would allow the cataclysm to occur without first
giving
free reign to this hubbub of voices...."

Thinking of the situation of Jesse Glass wanting to
dub some Western transformions of haiku "usoku" (false
haiku)...

I recollect Akira Kurosawa's 1949 detective thriller
"Stray Dog" ("Nora Inu"), which is about a Japanse
detective obessively searching for the gun a criminal
has stolen from him. There's a scene in which, as part
of his investigation, the detective attends a baseball
game.  When the 7th inning comes, you see all the
people in the stands get up for the "7th inning
stretch".  At the screening of this movie I attended
(at New York City's Japan Society), the audience,
including myself, was laughing vigorously at this
moment, because it seemed droll that the Japanese
would adopt this silly little fan ritual along with
the consequential rules of the game...

So this seems to indicate that the Japanese do believe
very deeply that if you are going to adopt an activity
from another culture you should take on all the rules,
practices, traditions and philosophies of that
activity.  Thus one could say that the Japanese are in
a strong position to ask the same from, for instance,
Western haiku-fanciers.

And yet, and yet--if in the West our particular genius
is of a more iconoclastic nature, why shouldn't we do
what we do?  The visual haiku (or "haiku") by Scott
Helms on Geof Huth's site is interesting to
contemplate--I'm just starting, but I'd say it's very
interesting how each "line" in these whatevers is
itself broken into three parts. However these "lines"
are rather angular, which IS a little jarring in terms
of what I think of as the haiku spirit...

Anyway, Irving Weiss's Socrates haiku sent to this
list in response to this discussion was pretty damn
wonderful, I hope we can agree on THAT, J.G.

Last thing...what's I imagine is VERY hard to stomach
for ANYONE who's seriously contemplated haiku for even
15 minutes in iffy translations is this current craze
in American (also British?)  popular culture to adopt
haiku as simply  concise statement of any sort in
5/7/5, so there are phenomena like contests to
encapsulate current news events in dopey
all-too-clever "haikus".

gozaimasu...

actually, i think they rise and sing the team's anthem during the sixth
inning in Japan... at least, at the games i attended... i would need someone
over there right now to verify that, though... i'm forgetful...

if i remember correctly, they blow-up long balloons, which makes the entire
stadium look like a big rainbow anemone, and release them during the seventh
inning... new meaning to the seventh-inning stretch... not very
eco-conscious, either...

also, they cheer endlessly during the games, most of them unaware of what is
actually happening on field... makes a boring blow-out much more exciting,
though... big games even bring out cheerleaders in the stands who lead the
masses...

they have adopted mascots who trot out stuffed animals to a player when he
hits a homerun...

there are other differences... a kind of bastard adoption...

if we really adopted haiku, each word should represent one unit, rather than
using the syllable... *shrugs* i don't mind the bastard adaptions of that
form, though... it's just good fun, if anything... these days, the good
stuff lives on and the bad stuff gets lost in a cybergrave... adopting
activities? how many of us know everything about something before we embark?
sometimes the accidents and experiments work out...

Reminds me that even the Japanese don't always get
it right. Back in the 80s, during the ET craze, I remember
seeing sidewalk vendors selling ET dolls wearing boxing
gloves. And then there's the famous story of the Ginza
department store that, during the early years of the post-war
occupation, featured a Santa in a store window--but nailed
to a cross.

That wd have been nice, but actually what has happened is:
(a) only half of the original $200 million in cuts were "restored"
<http://www.onthemedia.org/>;
(b) a Bushite named Patricia Harrison (former co-chairman of the
Republican National Committee, 1997-2001
<http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/biog/6605.htm>) has been appointed
president of the CPB;
(c) cuts elsewhere in the budget that cripple the production of

Residency url:
http://www.secrettechnology.com/resident/residency.htm

Residency description:

Exploring interface and interactive creatures with
content grabbed, thrust, stolen, and borrowed  from
new media artists, poets and electronic pioneers. Over
these 2-3 weeks, I will create twenty-four
digital extravaganzas, with each one being loosely or
closely centered on the content, ideas, images and
words of others. Think of this as ego stroking and
translation, a way to connect to those I have never
met and might not ever meet, and play with ideas of
interaction and interface. Some have offered their
content, others will simply be robbed, and all will be
enchanted, confused, annoyed and giddily stroked.

Bio:
"As a NET ARTIST, I am apparently dying or dead. With
that in mind, I bask in my zombie glow, my rotting
wires and my urge to bite through skulls.  I could
list those academic and worldly accolades that have
trophied themselves on my work, but I am only as good
as the last swirling mess I spit out. I live in
Australia with a beautiful woman and miss the snow, so
miss the snow."

 Take the train...get off at Merkaz Haifa...the station next to the port...walk north past the huge crane...toward the too self-assertive new egg cut in half shaped Rabin Govt Office Bldng...past a small shopping section...where you can buy a cappacino and croissant..at the same price as Paris/NY...about half a mile...and you'll find the Flea Market...

   In a small parking lot...concrete cut up...densely packed with the world's junk...radiating from the sides..a random street seller or two...this Sun. morning at 6:00...tho the day before on Sat Aft....there were 50 say street guys...

   The merchandise...as if  by common consent...is invariably thrown into a heap...taken out its box...and plastered any which way...jumble allah....heap to heap packed tight....ahs loves it...

   I go throw one random pile....and find a bibliography of Russian-Jewish lit..from 1917 to X...a lite ex-lib mark or two...i'm trying to convince myself...that this is just what  i want to carry half way around the world...i look for the seller...he's sleeping under a blanket on concrete...his half eaten dinner...pita...some onion like veggie..hummus..is being picked at by a stray fly...

SF Cinematheque presents
    July 7th  7:30  and  9:30pm (same show)
at Yerba Buena Center for the Arts
    701 Third (at Mission St)
    San Francisco, CA

NEO-BENSHI: The Latter Day Art of Live Film Narration

Writer/performers from the Bay Area, making use of a form of the
Kuleshov Effect, will re-present the following genres:

1930s Serial Western            Brandon Brown
1950s Hollywood Melodrama       Roxanne Power Hamilton
1950s Bollywood Melodrama       Rodney Koeneke
1960s Crime Drama               Norma Cole & Mac McGinnes
1980s Sci-Fi Horror             Stephanie Young
2000s Historical Epic           David Larsen


  * * *


A "benshi" was a film-teller, someone who wrote a script to
narrate and act out from the stage what's happening on the movie
screen.  This was a major profession in Korea and Japan in the
silent film era. Sometimes the benshi ventriloquized the
characters in the movie, sometimes just narrated the action,
sometimes remained silent. They always wrote their own scripts.

Neo-benshi warps that format to a modern entertainment-art of
taking back the movies for ourselves.  Screenplays are tossed,
subtexts are revealed and genres are transposed to another key.
In this festival of alternate readings, six scenes from major
films (since in the US we go broke or get busted for filming
anything ourselves anymore) are wrested from the studios by
turning the sound off, and re-telling them in real time.

The Neo-benshi craze is sweeping the coast, then the nation,
then the oceans.  Come see it in its pre-tsunami form:

Yerba Buena Center for the Arts, Screening Room
Mission at Third Streets
July 7th  7:30  and  9:30 (same show)
$7 general, $4 student/senior/Cinematheque members

Further related concepts:

counterfeit (v.) ca. 1292, from O.Fr. contrefait "imitated," pp.
of contrefaire "imitate," from contre- "against" + faire "make."
M.L. contrafactio meant "setting in opposition or contrast."

Kuleshov Effect (n.) ca. 1919, the mental tendency of viewers to
attempt to figure out how a sequence of filmed shots fit
together.

voiceover (n.) ca. 1947, cinema term for the voice of either an
unseen narrator or an onscreen character not seen speaking, in a
movie or a television broadcast.

karaoke (n.) ca. 1979, from Japanese, from kara "empty" + oke
shortened form of okesutora, a Japanization of Eng. "orchestra"

Hello everyone!

The submission period is now open for the Blackbox summer 2005 gallery.  If
you are unfamiliar with Blackbox, go to WilliamJamesAustin.com and follow the
Blackbox link.  Be sure to follow the instructions on the Blackbox page when
you submit.

I'm going to leave open, for the time being, the closing date for
submissions.  Once I have what I need, I'll announce on the lists that the submission
period is closed.

This time around, I am looking primarily for essays, theoretical or
otherwise.  I will nevertheless consider everything that comes in, i.e., the usual
vispo, web art, word text poetry, etc.  But an interesting essay on
aesthetics/poetics (of whatever length) will jump to the top of the list.

Again, as always, my sincere thanks to all who have supported and contributed
to Blackbox.

Best, Bill

The gathering was modeled after the International War Crimes Tribunal
that British philosopher Bertrand Russell formed in 1967 during the
Vietnam War. Speakers included Indian writer Arundhati Roy, former UN
Assistant Secretary General Dennis Halliday, independent journalist Dahr
Jamail and others.

This year's gathering was the culminating session of commissions of
inquiry and hearings on the Iraq war held around the world over the past
two years.

The Istanbul Tribunal consisted of three days of hearings investigating
various issues related to the war on Iraq, such as the legality of the
war, the role of the United Nations, war crimes and the role of the
media, as well as the destruction of the cultural sites and the
environment.

A 17-member Jury of Conscience at the Tribunal heard testimonies from a
panel of advocates and witnesses who came from across the world,
including from Iraq, the United States and the United Kingdom.

The jury delivered its verdict and recommendations at a news conference
this morning. The preliminary verdict read in part, "Recognizing the
right of the Iraqi people to resist the illegal occupation of their
country and to develop independent institutions, and affirming that the
right to resist the occupation is the right to wage a struggle for
self-determination, freedom, and independence as derived from the
Charter of the United Nations, we the Jury of Conscience declare our
solidarity with the people of Iraq."

We go now to jury chair Arundhati Roy's remarks yesterday, following
testimony from witnesses of the war and occupation.

RUSH TRANSCRIPT


AMY GOODMAN: We continue on this theme of rendition, which was taken up
at the World Tribunal on Iraq this weekend in Istanbul, Turkey, which
wrapped up a three-day session. It was the main theme of testimony of
Barbara Olshansky. She is with the Center for Constitutional Rights and
traveled to Istanbul for the Tribunal. Her book is called America’s
Disappeared: Secret Imprisonment, Detainees and the War on Terror. This
is an excerpt of what she had to say.


BARBARA OLSHANSKY: The United States government’s unlawful and covert
practices started very early on. And I'm just going to say this to give
people a picture of how quickly this administration seized on an
opportunity to repress people. Within one day of the attacks on the
United States, the government rounded up -- started rounding up in
excess of 1,500 people -- that's a guess; we'll never know how many --
immigrants and foreign visitors to the United States of Middle Eastern
origin and/or of the Muslim faith and put them in jails and detention
centers around the United States and ordered the guards at those jails
to lie to the attorneys who came to the jails and to lie to the foreign
consulates about who was imprisoned there. This was a deliberate order
of our Attorney General then, John Ashcroft, to lie to everyone that
came to the door about who was there.

And when we filed under our federal law seeking information about who
had been arrested -- because people had come to us, and said, “They took
my husband, my brother, my son, my nephew, and I don't know where they
went.” And we had to go literally door to door to try and find people.
When we asked under this law, this information law, about how many
people were taken, what was the justification, whether they had
attorneys, whether their families knew, whether their consulates were
advised, whether they could make calls, we got an answer from our
Department of Justice that we were not entitled to know.

A last piece I’ll say about it: With the creation of Guantanamo also
comes an exponential growth in the C.I.A.'s extraordinary rendition
program. Under this program, United States Special Forces charter
private jets and fly around the world and pick up people. Now, these are
not usually enemy combatants. For those, we, I think, use our regular
Army and Air Force planes. These are people that are seized, hooded and
shackled, brought out surreptitiously from the country where they're
captured and sent to third countries for interrogation under torture at
the United States' request. I’m sure some people have read about this.
It happened to two Egyptian men who were taken from Sweden. It happened
to people that were transiting -- traveling from one flight to another
in J.F.K. airport and ended up in Syria for a year being tortured, and
this, what the C.I.A. calls their ‘snatch and grab’ operations, has been
confirmed by C.I.A. officials and now private citizens who have helped
to set up to the operations for the charter companies.

These are the things started with Guantanamo. What they prove, and I
guess why someone who was much wiser than me understood when they asked
me here today, is that they prove that every statement made by the
United States government about abuses in Abu Ghraib, abuses elsewhere in
Iraq, being the work of a few rogue individuals is a monstrous lie. It
could not be anything else other than a monstrous lie, because these
policies started in Guantanamo, and we now know that they started at the
request of those highest up in the administration and they have been
going on from Guantanamo through to the present. They are certainly not
the policies of single individuals.

What they also show is that while this has been going on, there has been
a failure of leadership in the United States. Neither the judiciary nor
Congress has been able to hold back this tide of militarism and
brutality committed by the military and by the Bush administration. And
that is why I think it's important for me to be here today to see that
there are so many people to work with to try and rein in a rogue country
that has alienated itself and the rest of the world from the people of
the United States. Thank you.

AMY GOODMAN: Barbara Olshansky of the Center for Constitutional Rights,
speaking at the World Tribunal on Iraq in Istanbul this weekend. The
gathering was modeled on the International War Crimes Tribunal that
British philosopher Bertrand Russell formed in 1967 during the Vietnam
War. Speakers included Indian writer Arundhati Roy, former U.N.
Assistant Secretary General, Dennis Halliday, and independent journalist
Dahr Jamail. This year's gathering was the culmination of commissions of
inquiry and hearings on the invasion of Iraq held around the world over
the past two years. The Istanbul Tribunal consisted of three days of
hearings investigating various issues related to Iraq, such as the
legality of the war, the role of the U.N., war crimes and the role of
the media, as well as the destruction of the cultural sites and the
environment.

A seventeen-member Jury of Conscience at the Tribunal heard testimonies
from a panel of advocates and witnesses who came from across the world,
including from Iraq, the U.S., and Britain. The jury delivered its
verdict and recommendations at a news conference today. The preliminary
verdict read in part, (quote), “Recognizing the right of the Iraqi
people to resist the illegal occupation of their country and to develop
independent institutions and affirming that the right to resist the
occupation is the right to wage a struggle for self-determination,
freedom and independence as derived from the charter of the United
Nations, we, the Jury of Conscience declare our solidarity with the
people of Iraq.”

We go now to the jury chair, who read today's verdict, Arundhati Roy.
But these comments she gave yesterday after testimony from witnesses who
had been to Iraq, of both the invasion and occupation.


ARUNDHATI ROY: When I was invited to be on the jury by the W.T.I. --
yesterday, when they were making a film, they asked me, “Why did you
agree? You must have had so many invitations; why did you choose this?”
And I said, you know, “I feel so hurt that you are asking me this
question. Because it's ours. You know, where else would I be? What other
invitations would matter to me when we have to attend to this, this
huge, enormous bloody thing?” You know, since I'm not a lawyer, nor am I
even much of an organizer, nor am I even somebody who has been
particularly concerned about my legitimacy or, you know.

I don't think in sort of legal and bureaucratic terms, so you know, I
didn't really go down the road of questioning who we are or who we
represent, because to me it was a bit like somebody asking me whether I
had the legitimacy to write a novel. I mean, we're just a group of human
beings, whether we are five or ten or fifteen or ten million. Surely, we
have the right to express an opinion, and surely, if that opinion is
irrelevant, surely, if that opinion is full of false facts, surely, if
that opinion is absurd, it will be treated as such, and if that opinion
is, in fact, representative of the opinion of millions of people, it
will become very huge.

So we don't need to really worry ourselves too much about defining
ourselves. I think we need to worry about being very clear, being very
honest, being very precise about what we think and express that
fearlessly and in solidarity with the values that all of us have so
clearly expressed in so many ways here today. I really think this last
three days – I mean, as a -- speaking as a writer, what I seek with
complete greed, what I seek almost ruthlessly is understanding. You
know, that is all that I ever ask for, an understanding of the debt of
this world we live in. And that was a gift that one received, and I will
always be grateful for it.

To ask us why we are doing this, you know, why is there a World Tribunal
on Iraq, is like asking, you know, someone who stops at the site of an
accident where people are dying on the road, why did you stop? Why
didn't you keep walking like everybody else?

While I listened to the testimonies yesterday, especially, I must say
that I didn't know -- I mean, not that one has to choose, but still, you
know, I didn't know what was more chilling, you know, the testimonies of
those who came from Iraq with the stories of the blood and the
destruction and the brutality and the darkness of what was happening
there or the stories of that cold, calculated world where the business
contracts are being made, where the laws are be rewritten, where a
country occupies another with no idea of how it's going to provide
protection to people, but with such a sophisticated idea of how it's
going to loot it of its resources. You know, the brutality or the
contrast of those two things was so chilling.

There were times when I felt, I wish I wasn't on the jury, because I
want to say things. You know? I mean, I think that is the nature of this
tribunal, that, in a way, one wants to be everything. You want to be on
the jury, you want to be on the other side, you want to say things. And
I particularly wanted to talk a lot about -- which I won't do now, so
don't worry, but I wanted to talk a lot about my own, you know, now
several years of experience with issues of resistance, strategies of
resistance, the fact that we actually tend to reach for easy
justifications of violence and non-violence, easy and not really very
accurate historical examples. These are things we should worry about.

But at the end of it, today we do seem to live in a world where the
United States of America has defined an enemy combatant, someone whom
they can kidnap from any country, from anyplace in the world and take
for trial to America. An enemy combatant seems to be anybody who harbors
thoughts of resistance. Well, if this is the definition, then I, for
one, am an enemy combatant. Thank you.

AMY GOODMAN: That was Arundhati Roy, speaking at the War Crimes Tribunal
held now in Istanbul, Turkey. It has just wrapped up earlier today.

Subject:      Kimmelman & Gary Snyder
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII

An epigraph from Gary Snyder, for Kimmelman's poem "First Year" in his
book SOMEHOW:

                O loves of long ago
                hello again
                all of us together
                with all our loves and children
                twining and knotting
                through each other--
                intricate, chaotic, dense.

Kimmelman's daughter Jane appears from her first year to her eleventh
year, and in the poem "Letter to my Dead Brother":

                There is a connection that takes the place of
                holding one another. I remember you when
                Jane put her arms around my neck. I feel
                her warm breath, the blood coursing along

Intricate, chaotic, dense--the songs for our loves and each other are
shared with our descriptions.  The last poem in the book, "Late December"

                Thin ice along
                the fragile branch

                heading low of
                its own weight, wind

                and moon tighten
                the new darkness.

Twining, knotting, connection, holding, tighten...these patterns among
others run throughout the book, where the poetic cousins from Chaucer to
Zukofky include Ronald Johnson and Gary Snyder, and in a more general
evocive way, William Bronk:

                The light at least was not to be dismissed.

But  how is Kimmelman distinguished from these "cousins."

HARLEM BOOK FAIR BUFFALO

The Harlem Book Fair is Here!

Traveling from Boston, San Diego and Baltimore, the Harlem Book Fair (HBF)
graces Buffalo with its presence, in honor of the 2005 Niagara Movement
Centennial Celebration. Look for an action-packed weekend of literary
activities for you, your whole family and friends. Here's how the three days
of events break down:

Thursday, July 7

A Special Film Screening of the 2004 Sundance Film Festival award winning
film, Brother -to - Brother. The film takes a trip with a young black man as
he discovers the links to homosexuality within the Harlem Renasissance. The
film starts at 7pm at the Amherst Theater. $10.

Friday July 8

At 1pm there is a writers workshop, "Living Your Writing Dreams: An insiders
Take on Becoming a Writer" at 617 Main Street, 3rd Floor Conference Room.
$95 / $80 Just Buffalo Members.
8pm at the Statler Towers, HBF host their "A Buffalo Renaissance" themed
gala. HBF imitates the legendary ambiance of Harlem's famous Cotton Club
with Harlem Renaissance Review, an 18 peice band assembled from Colored
Musicans Club. Accompanying the Harlem Renaissance Review is jazz vocalist

   hey there...if anyone's interested in showing up for a major poetry event, the Philly Free School (www.artrecess.blogspot.com) is presenting "Poetry Incarnation '05" at the Khyber in Philly (2nd & Chestnut) on Tuesday, July 5, at 9 pm. We have 40 readers lined up, including C.A. Conrad, Frank Sherlock, Jenn McCreary, Will Esposito, Lauren Ireland, Kyle Conner, Adam Fieled, J.C. Todd, and a slew of others. We've booked downstairs at the Khyber for an entire night, & the reading should go on until the wee wee hours.
   this event is a tribute to & continuation of the original "Poetry Incarnation", which took place at London's Royal Albert Hall on June 11, 1965. This was the reading that introduced Allen Ginsberg & Gregory Corso to Swinging London. An endless, formless, egalitarian, exhilarating experience, as we want our P.I. '05 to be.
   We're charging $5 at the door & think the event should be worth it!
   Any questions, contact Adam Fieled @ (610) 608-2094/afieled@yahoo.com

Shameless promotion, check out my forthcoming book:

\if your email does not support html please refer to the following link:
http://www.spuytenduyvil.net/ravenletter.htm

Welcome to Spuyten Duyvil Limited Editions

Our third project:
Inverted Curvatures by Francis Raven
Cover and insert art by Brian Lucas
order deadline Oct. 31 2005
advance limited signed edition $50

We are bringing authors and artists together to provide our audience with
uniquely printed, visually dynamic (as well as digitally projected) items
outside the narrow confines of the retail world. Now we have this terrific
new novel by Francis Raven. The premise behind Inverted Curvatures is that
detective novels and romance novels work with opposing narrative curvatures.
In a detective novel, the body is found and the intentions come last. In a
romance it is the opposite. The intention to love comes first and the body
of that love is the conclusion to that story. Inverted Curvatures brings
these two narrative curves together in San Francisco using the poet, the
philosophical consultant, and the model. Some readers will be surprised at
the intersection, but this is fiction that means to make a difference.

What you and I are involved with is nothing short of revolutionary, and,
because of that, we are enabling the Spuyten Duyvil website to handle
advance orders for our limited, signed editions and advance purchase events.
Please purchase a copy of Inverted Curvatures by Francis Raven with
statigraphic images by Brian Lucas, and help us build a successful meeting
place for painters, authors, poets and filmmakers.

We feel strongly about the work that we bring to the public. You and your
friends can help us out.

Thanks for supporting Spuyten Duyvil events and publications. Without your
advance support, our authors and artists would not be able to further their
vision, inspiration and priceless labor, thus entering the culture at large,
thus entering the conversation at large. Help make this advance edition a
success by forwarding this link and conversation to other interested people
as well. Thanks!

dear Dmhxi,
=20
The waters of chaos have rinsed me from my perch.  Amid the rest of the =
washed-out trash, I've begun to solidify a world-view, a concept of =
human-nature.  In two words, "unsaved, unsavable."  Deep in the shit a =
seedling bursts.
=20
From Nietzsche's posthumous fragments:
=20
"Perhaps the entire evolution of the spirit is a question of the body; it =
is the HISTORY of the development of A HIGHER BODY that emerges into our =
SENSIBILITY.  The organic is rising to yet higher levels.  Our lust for =
knowledge of nature is a means through which the body desires to perfect =
itself.  Or rather: hundreds of thousands of experiments are made to =
change the nourishment, the mode of living and the dwelling of the body; =
consciousness and evaluations of the body, all kinds of pleasure and =
displeasure, are SIGNS OF THESE CHANGES AND EXPERIMENTS.  IN THE LONG RUN, =
IT IS NOT A QUESTION OF MAN AT ALL: HE IS TO BE OVERCOME."
=20
I'd guess Celan snagged the end of his poem 'Threadsuns' from the above =
passage. =20
=20
Threadsuns
over the grayblack wasteness.
A tree-
high thought
strikes the light-tone: there are
still songs to sing beyond
humankind.
=20
Spending a life attempting to solve the 'great problems' is a waste of =
time.  Our philosophical problems arise out of an innate inadequecy.  =
What's needed instead is the embrace of the continual experimentation =
which will eventually destroy the human race and give rise to a new form. =
=20
=20
Check out what my new guy Klossowski has to say about it:
=20
"THE BODY IS A PRODUCT OF CHANCE; it is nothing but the LOCUS where a =
group of individuated impulses confront each other so as to produce this =
interval that constitutes a HUMAN LIFE, impulses WHOSE SOLE AMBITION IS TO =
DE-INDIVIDUATE THEMSELVES."
=20
& later:
=20
"Once the body is recognized as the product of the impulses (subjected, =
organized, hierarchized), its cohesion with the self becomes fortuitous.  =
The impulses CAN BE PUT TO USE BY A NEW BODY, and are presupposed in the =
search for new conditions."
=20
Very curious interpretation of humanity on the level of cell-life.  Almost =
seems to reach toward contemporary genetics research (Klossowski text is =
from the 60s).  I hope some of this is useful to you.  I've been unable to =
write for some time, having classic fears; "It's over for me," etc.  Under =
the strain of Badiou, Agamben, Nietzsche, and now Klossowski (not to =
mention Celan) I have been incapable of developing a productive stance in =
relation to the creative endeavor.  "Experimentation toward death?"  If =
our experiments are meant to carry humanity into its next phase or =
incarnation they might not be wasted.  No salvation, but some kind of =
continuity.  The appeal of early 20th century Futurism to today's artists: =
 proposals of radical experimentation in every possible sphere, embrace of =
technology & continual advancement.  Also, brutal irony in that all human =
experiments lead directly to the eradication of humanity, its advancement =
toward another, alien mode. =20
=20
Stay spattered, brother.
=20
With love,
Hdkox

Khan Yunis rapper trio says music, not violence will end occupation

By The Associated Press

KHAN YUNIS, Gaza Strip - Three young Palestinians say there's a better
way to oppose the Israeli occupation than the violence that they worry
tarnishes their people's image for too many in the West. They are relying on rap music.

Their band PR, or Palestinian Rappers, rejects violence and instead dramatizes the Palestinians' plight in songs with names like "Freedom" and "Our Screams."

"Rap music was founded in the United States, so by singing rap we can't be called terrorists," says band member Mohammed Farrah, 19, who goes by the nicknames "D.R." and "Dynamic Rapper." "The only way for us to fight
occupation is through rap singing."

Farrah and fellow band members Moutaz Hwehy, or "Mezo," and Mahmud Abdallah, "Bond," grew up on MTV, where they listened to Tupac, Eminem and other rappers sing about poverty, violence and other problems.

They decided to explore their people's ordeal through rap, too.

"Where's the freedom?" the rappers ask in their song "Freedom." "I'm the son of Salam, I was born a long time ago but I'm still asking who I am. I exist. To be or not to be?"

The band got together in 2002. Even now, they still cut a curious figure in the conservative Islamic society of Gaza, where people stare at the spiky hair and American rapper garb of basketball shirts, baggy cotton pants, and Nike sneakers and hats.

They meet regularly in a small room in the crowded town of Khan Yunis to
blast their music, but perform only twice a year.

They performed in Ireland last year, and dream of appearing in the United
States. But in poverty-stricken Gaza, they haven't been able to put together enough money to record their music.

How is the Islamic faith delivering the message from Allah through rap? True Believer From ages past music in some form has been used to Praise the One. In Qur'an we find "Allah is beautiful and loves beauty." Allah (swt) did not give birds their song to suppress nor did He create the winds that blow through rocks or trees to create beautiful sounds to be ignored or not copied.

Then I just get home, sit down and make the concepts in my head into reality, and watch how they never cease to change and evolve once they're out of my head, and how no idea or concept no matter how good it is, will stay completely the same in your mind. John Coltrane spoke about the same thing with regards to getting the music in his head out into the real world of sound. But anyway, technically I use my computer, I got a mixer, a nice mic, and a Korg Keyboard, two nice monitors and a compressor which doesn't work right now. It's all about what you do with it though, what's in your mind.

[from Basil King]


                             "The darkness surrounds us"


I've read Pound's first encounter with Henry James. H.D. on her first
meeting D.H. Lawrence. Picasso's love for Henri Rousseau, and I've
seen Red Groom's painting of Dekooning's and Rothko's accidental
meeting in Washington Square. But to this day Franz Kline meeting
Robert Creeley is one of the most beautiful things that I have ever witnessed.


Bob and I were drinking beer in one of the booths that lined the
walls of the old Cedar Bar. Bob had recently moved back to the states
and had stopped off in New York on his way to Black Mountain College.
Bob was wearing the blue winter coat that Zukofsky had given him. He
didn't have any money, and I had credit at the bar. It was late in
the afternoon, and Franz Kline walked in and sat down next to me.
Franz, meet Robert Creeley. Awe came over Kline's face. He shifted
his weight, adjusted his brown hat, and took Bob's hands and held
them. "I can't tell you how much your poetry means to me." Franz was
still holding Bob's hands when Bob broke the silence. "Thank You."


                                   "The darkness surrounds us."


Bob, you put a new light into the darkness, and we, that is all of
us, thank you.

Subject:      Subtext Seattle - Christian BOK & Nico Vassilakis
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; format=flowed

Subtext continues its monthly series of experimental writing with readings
by
Christian BOk and Nico Vassilakis at Richard Hugo House on Wednesday, July
6,
2005. Donations for admission will be taken at the door on the evening of
the
performance. The reading starts at 7:30pm.

===
Christian BOk is the author of _Eunoia_ (Coach House Books, 2001), a
bestselling
work of experimental literature, which has won the Griffin Prize for Poetic
Excellence (2002). _Crystallography_ (Coach House Press, 1994), his first
book
of poetry, has also earned a nomination for the Gerald Lampert Memorial
Award
(1995). BOk has created artificial languages for two television shows: Gene
Roddenberry's Earth: Final Conflict and Peter Benchley's Amazon. BOk has
also
earned many accolades for his virtuoso performances of sound poetry. His
conceptual artworks (which include books built out of Rubik's Cubes and Lego
Bricks) have appeared at the Marianne Boesky Gallery in New York City as
part of
the exhibit Poetry Plastique. BOk currently teaches in the Department of
English
at the University of Calgary.

Nico Vassilakis lives in Seattle. Recent writing can be found in Bird Dog,
Traverse, 3rd Bed, 5 trope. Nico has a DVD recently available titled
Concrete:
Movies. He is also working on a play about Morton Feldman. With compass and
pencil he is drafting his way through dread.

Ron Silliman writes: Nico Vassilakis writes a very clean line. There are, of
course, as many reasons to not want a clean line as there might be to desire
one. Like rhyme or the tub-thumping metrics of iambic pentameter, the form
insinuates a vision of unmediated & harmonious existence that is patently a
lie.
Vassilakis does a superb job in . of using just such possibilities against
themselves. Sort of an anti-Moxley, Vassilakis's irony meter has arrived at
a
throbbing red maximum. "Meanness is allowed to fester / And it will ruin the
spine" is an absolutely fabulous moment in this regard. It is difficult to
imagine how an individual could ever hope to write much better than that.

Many web links are available to Nico's work, including:

When I was in my twenties and early thirties - before I got taken by being =
a
publisher - I was deeply involved in poetry-in-the schools programs,
(creating exercises for classing, administering, etc.) as well as teaching
in various colleges. After loving it, I burnt out on it and turned to
working with committed artists, authors and poets on making books. Lately,
now out of publishing - at least for the moment - I am, apparently, back
into it, or, much to my delight, this little event below happened recently,
which I feel compelled 'to share' among poets and friends! Enjoy:

Mom & the Peach
=20
Friday evening I went to Richmond to have dinner and visit with my mom - wh=
o
is now 89. When young her aspiration was to be a writer - in fact, during
her twenties and thirties, she wrote and published both short stories and
articles. However, fate and four children, led her, and eventually my fathe=
r
into urban and environmental politics. Most of her writing went into citize=
n
research and policy statements. Yet, now in her waning years, she
continually expresses disappointment that she did not fulfill her dream to
become known as a writer - going as far to discount her considerable
accomplishments as an activist politician.

So, this particular evening, rather than again listen to this reoccurring
lament, I decide to dust off my old skills as a creative writing teacher to
see if we can still get something out of her!

 While she sits on the couch, I claim a ripe peach from the kitchen, turn
off the PBS News Hour, and put the fruit into the gentle grip of her hands.
Since it=B9s hard for her to still manually write, I open my journal and pull
out my pen to transcribe:

I start with a simple question:

"Mom, how would you describe the peach?"

"It has very formal outside," she says, slowly sliding one of her hands
around it its circumference. "It is outlined very carefully. It is not
irregular. The colors are lovely, soft and expanding into the whole
operation."

"Do you mean out into the world?"

"No. I am not trying to go outside the limits of what I know about. I see
predominantly a deep rose. Underlying it is a smattering of gold.

It has the softness of a rose. When you touch it, it is very accommodating.
It calls you right in. It's a happy peach."

"Do you want to compare the peach to anything?"

"I don't want to compare it. Just from being out in the light, heat and the
very cold weather we have had, the exterior is harsh looking. You know
something has happened to the peach. It's been out in the world, just like
what happens to very young men."

She pauses to look at the base of the fruit.

"Down here at the bottom," she continues, "It is smooth and delightful. But
when you get up to the higher part, its own significance is not that
important. It's waiting for someone else to come and do something else to i=
t
- different than its first go around. In its first go around, there were no
indications. Now there are indications of things they want to do, things
that they will do, and things nice to have done. I know from having studied
other pieces of fruit that they will do things that are significant - they
shine in the sun. They make the passerby recognize them, all of which adds
to the glory of the fruit. Some will get more glorious than others."

My mother pauses. While she's talked, she has continued to palm the sides o=
f
the peach.

 "Am I getting too bookish," she looks at me, smiles and asks, almost a
combination of pleasure and embarrassment by her outlay.

I laugh. She pauses again.

"Is this a classroom project? Is this what you do? Where do you this?"

"I'm doing it right here, Mom."

I read her back the piece. She does not comment. She smiles and looks
pleased with herself. As I am. Indeed, it is sweet to hear her without
complaint.=20

yeah, great story, Stephen...

i was holding a peach today in my classroom... peaches were our student's
snacks today... they looked like small hearts, very hard peaches and not
like what i knew about peaches from California where we are spoiled...

one student wanted to know how many different types of peaches i knew...
after naming a white peach, i was lost, not much of a peach expert... he
didn't seem to mind, happy, perhaps, that he knew more than me...

To laugh often and much; to win the respect of intelligent
people and the affection of children; to earn the
appreciation of honest critics and endure the betrayal of
false friends; to appreciate beauty; to find the best in
others; to leave the world a bit better, whether by a
healthy child, a garden patch or a redeemed social
condition; to know even one life has breathed easier
because you have lived. This is to have succeeded.
 - Ralph Waldo Emerson

whether they want peace of whether they calculate the risks.  The dominating
impression as such a moment is that something that may pass for a prescribed

The 2005 Black Declaration of Independence


    In this society, the criminals make the laws and we the victims of their crimes continue to go to prison. America is still guilty of mass murder, grand theft and the deliberate destruction of the indigenous and Afrikan people. Before we discuss the cases of Mumia Abul Jamaal or Assata Shakur, we need to bring this country up on charges of genocide. Millions of our people have been killed without even a crime or trial. When white people disappear, we are all supposed to stop and go look for them. Our people have always disappeared without a trace.

"The 2005 Black Declaration of Independence"
by Dalani Aamon

I am here in America because at least one of my ancestors survived one of the most barbaric captures and inhumane boat rides ever imaginable. That ancestor was tortured and treated like cattle for years. He or she was allowed to have sex for the expressed purpose of providing the white subhuman species with free labor to build and maintain this place called america. We were deprived of our ability to love freely and openly like other people. The acts against us were criminal, unnatural and inhuman. Our language was taken away, our families torn up. Our real names have been taken away forever. We are still suffering from Post Slavery Syndrome that has caused our Black Family Dysfunction.

Our natural spirituality was ignored and replaced with their Christianity. Our involuntary geographical relocation was the final straw in the attempted destruction of our land based culture and traditions. This genocidal effort is not part of some past and forgiven action. It is not only ongoing, but in high gear globally.

Despite our more than four hundred years of trying to make this criminally induced relationship function, we are a people homesick for a more natural choice of lifetime earth partners. Our reluctance to declare our independence from the most murderous people, who have ever been on the planet earth, is proof that the brainwashing is now complete. We still love them, more than we love ourselves. Look who we give all of our money to.

For those of us who believe that time will cure all of our problems, look around you.

White people have killed us for hundreds of years without ever suffering the consequences of their actions. We are even today, still being lynched by the people you are waiting to change. http://www.harambeeradio.com/bernard.html

In this society, the criminals make the laws and we the victims of their crimes continue to go to prison. America is still guilty of mass murder, grand theft and the deliberate destruction of the indigenous and Afrikan people. Before we discuss the cases of Mumia Abul Jamaal or Assata Shakur, we need to bring this country up on charges of genocide. Millions of our people have been killed without even a crime or trial. When white people disappear, we are all supposed to stop and go look for them. Our people have always disappeared without a trace. The mass media is the last place we look for our folks. They will carry a cat up a tree story before they report and follow up on one of us being missing. We excuse it all away because we've seen it all before.

When one or two of their people are killed, anyone Black in the area is subject to get life in prison.

It matters not whether this government can prove it. There is no such thing as a black on white crime that is treated fairly. In any relationship that has been so devastating and injurious to one of the people involved, relief should be a naturally occurring device. We have irreconcilable differences with America. We must divorce ourselves from the illusion that we are one people. It is not our imagination. It was never intended and will never happen.

The Europeans lifetime quest for world dominance at any cost will never be understood by most humans. This subhuman behavior has us killing people of colour for them in the name of god bless america and a paycheck. We have tried to reconcile this behavior and this distorted slave/master relationship. We have on occasion been favored with a partial apology or a new document to placate and validate our existence here. The real truth is that white supremacy is never going to ever admit any errors. Their own perceived perfection and arrogance prevents them from telling the truth about the past, the present or the future.

Try to get them to tell the truth about the discovery of the so called americas. According to them they have not commited any crimes against anyone on planet earth. Ask them if you don't believe me.

The south still has jurisdictions that can't get an indictment or conviction for murder against a white man when the deceased is a Black man. Whites don't send whites to jail no matter how much evidence is produced. We should give our people the same pass. We have been lynched and officially executed by the state on the word of a white women for centuries. They live around us with impunity based on the historical reality and lack of respect for us as a people.

The prisons around this country are the new plantations being run by the same ole masers. The Black people that call these prisons home, should have never been incarcerated. Our Prisoner of War status doesn't allow us to be treated fairly or justly. Had america not have violated the peace and tranquility we enjoyed before their imposed relationship on us, prisons would be obsolete for us.

I contend that the real weapons of mass destruction are being aimed at us daily. I am sounding the alarm as an endangered species, that we must act to save ourselves.

Our very survival and safety as a cultural and historical people is at stake. The tyranny of this government towards us is unquestionable. How can we solve it all? Their answer to a government that they felt to be overbearing, unrelenting and uncompromising in their pursuit of happiness, was to Declare their Independence from that entity.Their own words are in red.

"We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.–That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed,–That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness."

END:

The charge against the British crown was not Mass Murder.

It was not attempted cultural, spiritual or ongoing genocide.

The declaration was against their own relatives.The people that looked like them and spoke the same language as them. The declaration was made in spite of both sides being in voluntary agreement about the formation and use of america. They still used everything at their disposal to insure their complete freedom. They called for civil actions on behalf of all the people who felt the same.

They never considered our enslavement or freedom, while the bombs were bursting in air. Freedom is Creator given , natural and humane right that should come as a result of your birth. We are now living with people who don't respect that natural law.

It's that time of the year again. Fireworks and celebratory functions are being prepared all over the world. We don't even see the disconnection in celebrating other people's freedom while not even considering your own. If your life has been productive and problem free, great. Help us help others. Get involved in the true liberation of our minds. do it for your ancestors, who weren't so fortunate. Join in somewhere.

What are you going to be doing as a black person to gain the respect of the world that other groups do? Join in somewhere please. Find a group where you live. Can't find one, then let me know.

United we stand, divided we will fall. We keep complaining but do nothing. Use your time wisely. The enemy never sleeps.

************************************************************************

What will I be doing on the 4Th of Yu Lie?

I will be reading the New Document in person.

I will be in Baltimore at the Black Continental Congress working with like minded Brothers and Sisters to finally Declare Our Independence. We are asking all people of colour to consider joining us in person or in spirit that day. It will be the start of some serious dialog.

I Love You Black People

"Young poets on a toot grind the Columbia MFA scene into Bowery
organica."
Thats how Bob Holman described the reading series ostensibly titled
Vacation House [for those without one]. We are now grinding into our
second brace of readings with two great young poets, bright-eyed but
not wet-behind-the-ears: DREW BAUGHMAN and JESS KEYSER-FJELD.

Tuesday, June 7th
6 PM [happy hour--2for1 drinks]
Bowery Poetry Club
308 Bowery, b/t Bleeker and Houston
B,D,F,V to B'way/Lafayette or 6 to Bleeker
$3 for the readers

DREW BAUGHMAN is the author of 'Vostok Fizzle,' an as yet
unpublished
romp through the realm of absolute spirit. He is a recent graduate
of
the Brooklyn College MFA program.

JESS KEYSER-FJELD recently won Columbia University's prestegious
Woodberry Poetry Prize. Her poems, which combine the surealist
sensibilites of the New York School with baking soda in a hot pan,
have appeared in the Columbia Review and Quarto magazine among
others.

come for a post fourth of july hair of the dog.

A few photo-postcards from the early 1900s of West Lima, WI, the tiny
town that Dreamtime Village is located in.  At the time of these photos
this place was a thriving metropolis of 300 or so & most people rarely
left town because everything they needed to get by could be purchased
in town.  Now West Lima is about 60 people & the sole business is the
pepsi machine across the street.  My fave foto in this series is the
one called "The Streets of West Lima" which shows the crossroads
outside my door, but back then there was a big old elm right in the
middle of the crossroads.  These days the tree is gone but now we have
Amish teenagers speeding thru the 4 way stop without stopping.
