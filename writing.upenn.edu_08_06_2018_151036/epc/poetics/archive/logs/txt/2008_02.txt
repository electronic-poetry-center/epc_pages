The Spiral Jetty environs is being threatened, by petroleum interests no less. Hop and skip through the emails below for details and
  If you want to send a letter of protest to save the beautiful, natural Utah environment around the Spiral Jetty from oil drilling,  the emails or calls of protest go to Jonathan Jemming 801-537-9023 jjemming@utah.gov. Please refer to  Application # 8853.  Every letter makes a big difference, they do take a lot of notice and know that publicity may follow.  Since the Spiral Jetty has global significance, emails from foreign countries would be of special value.

   . Feb 13 is verdict time.

 Thank you,

 Dear Friends,

 We have now won a stay of execution until February 13th. Nancy Holt and those of us who feel Robert Smithson's Spiral Jetty is a national monument that needs to be saved and the environs protected, please call or email Jonathon Jemmings, and ask him to deny Application 8853 permission to drill the "West Rozel Field Prospect"  near the "Spiral Jetty".

  I think if we each ask ten more people to write to him, Mr. Jemmings and the Utah state officials will eventually be so over-whelmed by the world's outrage that we might be able to prevent this disaster. I remember when I asked my friends in the art world for help in saving Gordon Matta-Clark's Office Baroque in Belgium, it snowballed into a thousand letters from people around the world willing to help a fellow artist. Your letters have already had an impact. Hopefully, additional letters from your friends will influence the Utah vote positively.

 With much heartfelt gratitude,

Spiral Jetty Oil Drilling     Dear Friends,

Yesterday I received an urgent email from Lynn DeFreitas, Director of Friends of the Great Salt Lake, telling me of plans for drilling oil in the Salt Lake near Spiral Jetty.  See Attachments.  The deadline for protest is tomorrow, Wednesday, at 5PM.  Of course, DIA has been informed and are meeting about it today.

 I have been told by Lynn that the oil wells will not be above the water, but that means some kind of industrial complex of pipes and pumps beneath the water and on the shore.  The operation would require roads for oil tank trucks, cranes, pumps etc. which produce noise and will severely alter the wild, natural place.

 If you want to send a letter of protest to save the beautiful, natural Utah environment around the Spiral Jetty from oil drilling,  the emails or calls of protest go to Jonathan Jemming 801-537-9023 jjemming@utah.gov. Please refer to  Application # 8853.  Every letter makes a big difference, they do take a lot of notice and know that publicity may follow.  Since the Spiral Jetty has global significance, emails from foreign countries would be of special value.

 They try to slip these drilling contracts under the radar, that’s why we found out so late, not through notification, but from a watchdog lawyer at the Southern Utah Wilderness Alliance, the group that alerted me to the land leasing for oil and gas near Sun Tunnels last May.

 Thank you for your consideration of this serious environmental matter.

 Be well,
 Nancy

sorrowful the intervention of death
mournful community, the horizon continues briefly, then desolation
tears of martyrs of kenya, darfur, small witnessings in forests
sorrowful the finality, how i claw at death
how i cultivate my tiny death, caress my intervention
before you i am going, after you, following and the forests
and the forests and the imminent cliffs
how sorrowful they are


the first 4 are pieces for another cd

the next group are smallscanner modifications with artifacts, moving
towards the extremities of the software's ability to coalesce with
the dream of the real. the triangular protrusions are similar to the
catastrophic jumps visible in the motion capture videos.

here thom's semantics of catastrophe theory, his linguistic primitives,
are more than useful. code at the limits turns to prey.

DALE SMITH - SUSQUEHANNA - NOW AVAILABLE


This book contains the first part of Dale Smith's Susquehanna, a sustained meditation on the value of failed vision -- particularly the inability of a young Samuel Taylor Coleridge to fully realize his Pantisocracy on the banks of the Susquehanna River in the early 19th century. Thinking this failure through the cultural and technological developments of the present moment, Smith develops a methodological approach within the body of the poem grounded partly in Walter Benjamin's materialist historiography and David Antin's talking meditations on anthropology.

64 pages.

 Perfect-bound with three-color letterpress wraps. Like the Wingbow Press edition of Ed Dorn's Slinger, parts of the book were set in Caslon Old Face. Parts of the book were also set in Baskerville Old Face, Palatino Linotype, and Georgia. Interior images culled from various 18th century New England primers. Front cover image of Britain culled from John Sellers' 1690 Hydrographia Universalis. Rear cover image from Sellers' A New Systeme of Geography, 2nd Edition, also printed in 1690.
Parts of this poem previously appeared in Kadar Koli, Madorla, and Damn the Caesars.

 $10.00 (Paypal. Check. Money order.)

The "Punch Press" menu option to the right of the DTC webpage will lead you to Smith's Susquehanna and other Punch Press publications.

Bush  Haiku


This is a short  poem made up entirely of actual quotations
 from George W. Bush.  These have been arranged, only for aesthetic  purposes, by   Washington Post writer,   Richard Thompson. A wonderful Haiku poem  like this is too  good  not to  share.


                   MAKE  THE PIE  HIGHER

                   I  think we all agree, the past is  over.
                   This  is still a dangerous  world.
                   It's  a world of madmen and  uncertainty
                   And  potential mental  losses.

                   Rarely  is the question  asked
                   Is  our children  learning?
                   Will  the highways of the  Internet
                   become  more  few?

                   How  many hands have I  shaked?
                   They  misunderestimate  me.
                   I  am a pit-bull on the pantleg of  opportunity.

                   I  know that the human  being
                   and  the fish can  coexist.
                   Families  is where our nation finds  hope,
                   Where  our wings take  dream.

                   Put  food on your  family!
                   Knock  down the  tollbooth!
                   Vulcanize  society!
                   Make  the pie  higher!
                   I  am the Decider!

       (Pass this on.  Help cure mad Cowboy disease in the next
 election.)

Enjoy!  Sheila

El Museo del Barrio consistently has  very excellent exhibitions,
most often, as with the one reviewed here, in which the "conceptual and the
political," despite great repression, find ways to flourish and challenge--

the exhibition, as it is "Art" doesn't include the huge amount of
Performance and ephemeral pieces related with Visual Poetry and Mail Art
that has been active in Latin America since the 1960's--Clemente Padin is
the the foremost exemplar of an artist still working whose works span now
five decades--including over two years' torture and imprisonment during the
US supported Uruguayan military dictatorship--

hopefully some day these also will have the kind of celebration here they do
in the countries in which they openly  faced the Death Squads and US School
of the Americas trained torturers and Chicago School "Shock Doctrine"
economists as did the artists represented in this exhibition--

Carceral Time

Forced to sleep with their hands exposed
how will a tool take shape?

Dreams take the shapes of tools
through which the body escapes itself.
A wake. A spoon baked into a cake.

In the fist of memory
time was folding inward.

(from *The Clock Maker’s Memoir*)


Catherine Taylor teaches at Ohio University. Her essays, poetry, and reviews have recently

nobody, who are you? A fucking nation? Walcott I’m not. A roseate universe, subcutaneous nipple,
prismatic cd playing cum and dust and Oum Kalsoum. National identity’s inevitable as sand,
 blood,
a dark juggernaut MLK refused to accept despair as the only response to the ambiguities of
history, but I can’t, today, so far from you, O Canada, who is asked to represent it. Which
 I’s
slip the noose? Salim Halali’s heart may have been a foreign country, mine’s a minefield for
 you,
h’bibi, skip the stones, centrifugal archipelago, ruin

THE CLOCK MAKER'S MEMOIR by Dan Featherston
Advanced praise for *The Clock Maker’s Memoir*:

Through a series of poised, meditative stanzas, *The Clock Maker’s Memoir* takes on the
 formidable
topics of time and memory. What’s evident throughout this book is a careful craftsmanship
 leading
to novel perspectives all around the clock.
~ Lisa Jarnot

*The Clock Maker’s Memoir* registers the world’s variety in small catalogs of storms, shadows,
dreams, memories, and rituals of childhood. In such forms, time returns each time with a
difference. Likewise, the supple measure of these poems returns us to a rhythm or tone each time
with a difference, sounding a subtle echo of slipped in sleep. As William Blake declares, “There
is a Moment in each Day that Satan cannot find / Nor can his Watch Fiends find it.” Yet Dan
Featherston finds it — through alert and resourceful art.
~ Devin Johnston

With its precise music, *The Clock Maker’s Memoir* navigates the immeasurable distance between
 the
clock’s face and the face worn by lived experiences. In these poems, memoir is not some static
repository: it is a poesis of the present tense. Featherston’s craft and his unblinking
 commitment
to particulars fashion a lyric search that one can trust to ask the questions, the necessary
questions of time, space, and how we find one another amidst all this memory.
~ Richard Deming

Frankly, I'm amazed that the Spiral Jetty has lasted this long.
There's lot of public art in the US that gets disappeared & no one
says anything.  At least this latest debacle should attract a lot of
attention.

Kandinsky 2 (15 images, mostly 1280x1024):
http://vispo.com/dbcinema/kandinsky2

dbCinema is a graphic synthesizer i'm writing in Director. one creates and
configures 'brushes' that create a painterly movie using images as 'paint'.

the underlying images in these are digitizations of paintings by the Russian
early 20th C. avant garde abstract painter Wassily Kandinsky.

each brush has an image source, which can either be a local folder of images
(so you can use your own images) or one may type in the concept of the
brush, and dbCinema then downloads images from the Net somehow related to
the concept, and uses those as the brush's 'paint'.

these were done with 2 simultaneous brushes.

this is 'generative art' in that the program itself is quite active in the
creative process. but the brushes are highly configurable, and interesting
work does require creativity from whoever uses dbCinema.

have been enjoying the Oulipo Compendium, edited by Harry Matthews. i quote:

"From its beginnings the group has insisted on the distinction between
"created creations" (créations créantes) and "creations that create"
(créations créantes), to the benefit of the latter: it has been concerned
not with literary works but with procedures and structures capable of
producing them. When the first sonnet was written almost a thousand years
ago, what counted most was not the poem itself but a new potentiality of
future poems. Such potentialities are what the Oulipo invents or
rediscovers."
(p 213, under "Potential"

I do more work in creating algorithms that are meant to be creative not
simply by themselves but with creative engagement by people--ie, my work is
'interactive' in this sense--than I do in creating texts or pictures or
sounds, etc., though I do that too.   dbCinema is more a 'tool' than an
artwork--in that very little of the 'content' is provided, which is one of
the characteristics of tools, it seems to me--but the form of what is
creatable in my work is not as general as in tools such as Photoshop or
Word. Instead, the form of the creatable works is more constrained. The
range varies. It isn't so much the range of the form as the appeal of the
form, its expressive power, that interests me, though range is of course a
consideration also.

"When the first sonnet was written almost a thousand years ago, what counted
most was not the poem itself but a new potentiality of future poems." In
retrospect, yes, but who can say 'what counted' at the time of its creation?
Was the writer of the first sonnet an intrepid formalist who decided to
create a new form? Or did it evolve more incrementally, as do most things?
Or did its genesis and birth cut across many such lines? I certainly don't
know.

Am also reading 'The Blind Watchmaker' by Richard Dawkins. He says that
living things are apparently designed so marvelously, in many ways, that it
takes a great deal to really understand how it could possibly be that
they/we arose without a designer at all. And that is what he sets out to do
in this book. It's very well-written. Simple and strong. I highly recommend
it.

Speaking of public art disappearing...

I live in Lansing, and for a long time there was a fantastic Michael Heizer
sculpture down by the capitol.  (You can google more info about the ensuing
debacle with led to it being dismantled, so the city could use the space for
PARKING!  even after Heizer offered to restore the piece, and help with the
cost).

It is awful to see the complete disregard for public art.  It was a coup for
Lansing to get such an incredible piece.  When it became clear, to the city,
that the land was best used otherwise, it was easy to let the work rust and
rot and have a safe excuse for demolishing it.

Spiral Jetty, I fear, will one day fall away too.  Even if we do our best to
keep drilling, etc out, we're wrecking the global ecosystem so quickly that
all we'll see in a few years will be some arranged rocks.

Subject:      On Where to Find Audio/Sound Poetry
Mime-Version: 1.0 (Apple Message framework v752.3)
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII; delsp=yes; format=flowed

So i've been listening to the various sound poetry and sound art
archives on ubu, and the one thing that has struck me is that the
experimental music type stuff seems to be generally more interesting
than the sound poetry stuff. It seems like there's an awful lot going
on in the sound poetry world that hasn't really caught up to the
technological and aesthetic achievements of various electronic music
types. Moreover, along with being more advanced and more challenging
than a lot of the sound poetry i'm listening to on here, i tend to
think that someone like for example the aphex twin or plastikman or
iannis xenakis or glenn branca is also more accessible because
they're coming at what they're doing from a starting place of music
rather than a starting place of poetry. Googling around for search
strings like "sound poetry" and "audio poetry" one tends to find a
lot of recordings of readings, a lot of them pretty crummy qua
recordings, which I guess is my complaint over all. I did find some
stuff on PennSound that was kind of along the right track, things
that were using signal processing to create sounds and which had an
adequate level of audio fidelity. But by and large the stuff I keep
coming across sounds like it was recorded into the line input of a
sound blaster 16 from a consumer grade cassette deck.

So I guess what I'm asking is, is there anything out there that's
sort of up to date and concerned with audio quality putting out
experimental audio poetry? Any poets who are making works primarily
seeing them as recordings and not performances? Any periodicals
produced on CD-R with this sort of a focus? I'm curious because for
years I've been doing little audiotext experiments of my own, and i
have a background as a recording engineer so it's just natural for me
to play around with these things, but it had always seemed to me that
the recording as objet d'art thing must have already happened in
poetry, and so I left it alone as a serious pursuit. But listening to
what's out there, or at least what I can find, makes me suspect that
there's some unmined territory as far as audiotextual work goes and
maybe I should start taking my own thoughts on the matter a little
more seriously.

So I guess what I'm asking is, aside from installation sound art
(which is by and large a subset of conceptual art where it isn't the
sound itself but what made the sound that makes for the interest, and
in my general experience sounds amateurish and/or terrible
consistently), is there anything going on contemporarily that I might
not be aware of that I should be? I guess what I'm looking for is
like a Hi Fi sound poetry movement, something that sees the potential
of recorded mediums beyond just capturing a live reading or euro
modernist sound poetry or "spoken word over avant garde jazz/musique
concret needle-drop backing tracks" that seem to be the bulk of
what's out there.

Any help or suggestions much appreciated, particularly references to
any journals or periodicals distributed on CD.

Thanks,

Jason Quackenbush

Subject:      Messay (finished on my birthday, ah well)
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII; format=flowed

(really apologies for sending so much material out recently. i've been working
furiously on 'emanent' materia and wanted to 'capture' what's close to a book
as it comes. right or wrong, there are implications for poetics, phenomenology,
etc., i think, or would like to think. anyway, here is the most confused essay
of all. after this, back to image/sound, both of which are easier for me,
shape-riding into oblivion.)


Messay: The Mess of the True World


This text is culled from an outline of current work prepared for my re- search
group at West Virginia University (Virtual Environments Laboratory, Center for
Literary Computing), Morgantown, WV. Questions dealing with substantive content
were taken in the order they appeared, and embedded in the following m/essay.
Topics again center around issues of the 'true world,' emanents, medical and
other modeling, avatars, organisms, know- ledge and its management. The
relative disorderliness reflects the disord- erliness of the world, or so I
hope to believe - not an inherent defect in messay style.


  what does it mean to be in-carnated within the real/virtual/
  true world?

Carnated/carnal/knowledge - We could begin by introducing the true world, the
world of mind in relation to ontological/epistemological shifting. The true
world is primordial, in other words backgrounding.

..."however, we use the word [_materialism_] in its dictionary definition of
_embodiment,_ in contract to _mind._ Thus, virtual reality, as dis- cussed
within the art literature [...] is materialist, regardless of whether this
experience is _real_ or _illusory._ Mental constructs, on the other hand, are
nonsensory and so have no material existence." Paul Fish= wick, An Introduction
to Aesthetic Computing, in Fishwick, ed., Aesthetic Computing, MIT, 2006. In
this sense, the true world is materialist; how- ever I would argue that mental
constructs cohere with the sensory, that a fundamental entanglement exists. For
example, love or hate create sensed bodily transformations, mathematical
thought creates the sensation of per- ceived 'symbol-clouds,' and so forth.


  what are the edge-phenomena/plastic and static limits of the body?

The limits of my body within the true world are the limits of my world; here I
include ontological shifts such as mathesis, semiosis, emotions and the like.
Given the limited bandwidth of receptors of all sorts, and the limitations of
mind (for example, in thinking through the appearance of the eighth dimension,
calculating, speaking non-native languages, etc.), thought and the true world
are based on extrapolation - the _gestural_ - as fundamental being. (See Tran
Duc Thao on the origins of language.) The gestural follows quantum
non-distributive logics (see the early experi- ments by Land on color vision),
not Aristotelian distributive logics; this being-in-the-world is partial
reception of part-objects transformed into inherency through gesture. All
organisms have this in common.

The _plastic_ limits of the body are the limits of body-inherency, whether
'real' or 'virtual' or other category - the limits of the image carried by the
jectivity (introjection and projection) braid. The _static_ limits may be
considered formal-measurable limits, whether in one or another space.


  of the geopolitical body? of the political-economic body?

As soon as one brings domain-extrapolation of the body into play (i.e. sexual
body, material body, imaginary body, natural body, and so forth), cultural
nexus is paramount, and the body itself moves within theory as phenomenological
token or punctum.

And as soon as one brings variegated ontologies and epistemologies into play,
analysis becomes a mush/mess/mass or miss. Terms slide against terms, carrying
enormous overdetermined histories with them - but these are the only histories
there are.


  what are the signifiers of bodily arousal/violence/meditation?
  how are these constituted within the true world?

Herewith bee a liste of signes, or some such. But where is the arousal,
violence, meditation, if not brainward, wearing the exposure, softening,
hardening, quiescence of the body which simultaneously is foregrounded and
absenting. In terms of emanents, the signs are symbolic; one calculates,
applies them. In term of organism, the signs are ikonic, upwelling. The brain
manages none of this; the brain manages, is managed - everything becomes a mess
as inquiry tangles uselessly. It's this uselessness, this nexus, that is of
interest - an analytical failure in the close-rubbed maw of the world.


  readings: what does it mean to read the real body? the virtual body?

One might begin by considering language as fundamentally ikonic, that within
the preconscious ('repository' of syntactics, short-term memory - another
metaphor) language is clothed, associated with the true world. Language then is
structured like the unconscious, and the unconscious does not necessarily splay
the real. Bodies, organic and emanent (and 'organic' references the machinic
phylum as well), inhere to mind, minding, tending, a posteriori interpretation
and hermeneutics. Reading the body is embody- ing, is against the background of
incarnation. Sheave-skins need not react or appear to sense as organic skins;
the feedback is often visual or aural, not proprioceptive. Within the jectivity
braid, this is an epistem- ological issue, not one of fundamental locus. On the
other hand (real or virtual), one can abandon the emanent; abandoning the
organic is deadly. Proceed backwards from this, from the irretrievable,
intolerable, finality of death, and reading bodies, and bodily risk, become
wildly disparate. Nevertheless both inhabit the true world, mind inhabits both,
albeit often in qualitatively different manners, depending on ontology.


  what are the ontologies and epistemologies involved here?
  ontological status of the so-called virtual -
  Schroedinger's cat paradox and collapse of the wave function as model
   for simultaneous analogic/digital readings -
  seeing through microscopy (tunnel, scanning, optical, etc.):
  are ontology and epistemology equivalent at the limit?
  (are analogic and digital equivalent at a parallel limit?)

What difference does it make? Begin with the mess, with the corrupted reading
of whatever consciousness has placed there, on the page, the rock, the emanent
body, the organic body. The last carries ikonic signs, simultaneously
indexical, pointing out the mute history of the being. If there were only
readers of everything! If only the book of nature existed! The Ladder! Great
Chain of Being!

Ontologies occur in local domains, rub raw against each other, problema- tize
each other. Who decided this one or that one as primordial? What's fundamental
is the mixed mess, the braid. At least as far as we're con- cerned, the braid.


  internals and externals, static/dynamic. remnants of the visible
  human project, gendering of the visual/internal

Human skin under the microtome, sheave-skin burrowed into by camera position.
Here is the necessity of Madhyamika, co-dependent origination, depend
co-origination, braided mind, image, imaginary, entity, real and virtual
within, inhering to the true world. Striated, variegated trans- formations
characterize life; the Visible Human Project transforms organism into emanent,
habitus into data-base.


  comfort, dis/comfort, ease, dis/ease, hysteria and abjection/fluid-
  ity (laycock's 1840 essay on hysteria, kristeva, chasseguet-smirgel)

Clearly the abject lies within the primordial, the braid is braid of
dissolution, corruption, decay; definitions flux in relation to the constricted
passing of time. Organisms flood themselves, emanents decay with their
corporations, software updating, diminishing dreamtimes as elders die off.
Hysteria is convulsion, but also spew, contrary and wayward, the refusal of the
body, just as death is such a refusal and catatonia. Do others refuse the body?
Use it? Reuse it? Are sheave-skins exchanged? Does political economy depend on
aegis?


  dis/ease, hysteria, and so forth of emanents

Dis/ease, etc. may be modeled; turning the emanent towards abjection is
necessarily a conscious decision. The hysteria of emanents is the hys- teria of
the steering mind. Proliferation of emanents, duplications and other hacks, may
be considered a form of hysteria. But hysteria is on the surface; emanents
which are autonomous or semi-autonomous agents may exist the full range of
symptoms, generated from within, without external steering.


  medical model and technology

A medical model implies internal flows, striations, identities, vulner-
abilities, immunological defenses, maintenance and so forth. Emphasis is on the
cohering of parts, membranes and molecular channels. Organism runs from within;
emanent runs from without. An emanent may be defined as _an image or apparition
whose body and mind are elsewhere,_ an entity that exists in relation to the
jectivity braid, and has apparent, but not genidentical, identity. Of course
the organic body itself is genidentical only to a limited extent.

One might say then that both ontologically and epistemologically, _an emanent
exists within data-bases or other entities spatio-temporally distant from the
visual or other residue._ What we see is surface, but surface from both within
and without. _The dissection of an emanent image is the result of camera
angle._


  psychoanalytics and technology, psychoanalytics of emanents

The psychoanalytics of emanents are two-fold: the psychoanalytics of mind
steering, and the internal psychoanalytics of the machinic phylum. Or
three-fold if the former is also embedded within/embedding the psycho-
analytics of organically-embodied mind. I would begin with Freud's
metapsychology, since it's illusory clarity allows the possibility of
equivalence, attribute classes, and the like. I would attach this model to one
of drives and instincts dealing at least in part with homeostatic maintenance
(which I have covered elsewhere).


  analogic and worn emanent boundaries

How does the emanent wear? How does it wear the analog? For an emanent to
_wear,_ an ontological shift must be crossed, the wear occurring in hard or
flash drive, in the material world of atoms and quantum probabilities.


  edge / boundary phenomena - physics and psychophysics of the game-world
  edge in second life

Psychophysical remapping of (motion, behavior) steering phenomena. What else to
say here? Camera views must be independent of emanents; they move beyond,
behind, below the sheave-skins, constructing visual feedback of morphed
transformations. For a moment nothing is autonomic, everything is relearned.
But there are asymptotic behaviors and motions at the edge of every game-world,
behaviors simultaneously permitting approach and refus- ing escape. The
game-world edges harbor autisms, palsies, deconstructions - chatterings which
take on the guise of everyday life, just as everyday life elsewhere within the
game-world might well take on these chatterings as style or news from afar.


  phenomena of the sheave-skin and sheave-skin internals

Sheave-skin externals read as internals: anatomical mappings within Poser.
First that the visual mappings are just that, indexicals, residue, from
codings, reports from another frontier, that of the software processes
themselves. Second, I have pointed out elsewhere that sheave-skin and
environment, visuals, all exist within the same ontological habitus; the split
is between this habitus and deeper discrete or digital processes. The split is
absolute ontologically, constructed epistemologically. If there is an Absolute
in sheave-skin or game-theory or game-world, it's this ontological split which
even a representation of software processes cannot penetrate: from
electron-movement and process configuration/deploy- ment to
visual/aural/tactile/etc. appearance - the gap is permanent, imminent, and
therefore uncanny.


  phenomena of medical models in relation to edge/boundaries

The medical model is for learning, for analogy of surface to surface. The
medical model requires a (human) viewer. Any dissection into the substance of
an organic body results in exposed and constructed surfaces; interiors always
lie elsewhere, revealed by X-ray, MRI, and so forth.


  edge phenomena in literature, codework, mathesis of the text

In a sense all writing is edge, phenomena of the edge; writing exists as
surface, sheave-skin, emanent. Inscription coats the orgasm of things,
constructs both things and orgasm, wryting into the body of the true world
helter-skelter. Codework in this regard is mute, ikonic; code and text scrape
one another, none dominant, both structured and structuring.


  generalization of edge phenomena into the dialectic between tacit
  knowledge (polyani) and error (winograd/flores)

At the edge, the world is manifest between lived experience and corrup- tion,
between trial and error, between inhering/cohering and construction, between
dwelling and building. into the forest of error, where does the body go? From
the edge, one can look back or down, into the windows of the comfortable houses
across the street - if one still has the capability of sight. Is the edge
sharp? Does the world cut? Is the edge equivalent to death, both blank, beyond,
both miasma of theory and practice? Think else- wise of the possibilities of
worlds of closed manifolds or recursions, one repeatedly returning, to
something in the vastness of space or mind. and then think, what a construct,
what comfort, and to what regard, what proof or results, what Signs?


  what constitutes worlds? constructing?
  world of the text, inhabitation/dwelling/building (heidegger,
  dufrenne)

It's too simple to insist on worlds cohering, or that within their do- main
(ontological, epistemological), there is closure. One might say that, for all
intents and purposes, worlds are nearly closed, that blurred boun- daries are
distanced, rarely in evidence. The construction of worlds is no more or less
problematic than the construction of anything at all. A world is characterized
by inhabitation; a world is a homing.

The world of the text forgets its coding, its double-coding. Without that
forgetting, erasure, the text is anomalous, problematic, non-cohering. The
willing suspension of disbelief begins within the absence of will; will returns
when the text ends or fails.


  what constitutes the true world? worlding?
  'true world' in which lines/angles are 'trued' (affine geometry),
  'true world' in the sense of 'trued' phenomenologies within which
  virtual, real, and ikonic are blurred and interpenetrating, somewhat
  equivalent, and within which traditional epistemologies of symbol/
  sign/signifier/signified/index/ikon etc. break down (kalachakra
    tantra, jeffrey hopkins)

'Worlding' references ongoing inhabiting and making of the (true) world,
inhabiting memory, making and dwelling in memory, the truing of the world. All
worlds are not true worlds, all true worlds are worlding. ikonic signs inhere
within the true world, reading bodies (organisms, emanents, approp- riated,
misappropriated) are ikonic, true world, the body stands for everything and
nothing; ikonic, the body stands in for the body.


  'reading' underlying (substructural, configuration files, guides)
  organization of mocap/scan through surface phenomena
  (and the relationship of this reading to waddington's epigenetic
  landscapes)

Oh, one has to read the cinema I produce, held taut through diagram and
substructure. Reading here involves decoding, retaining the decoding against
the memory or remembrance of absent code. There are epigenetic landscapes of
decoding, tendencies and tending of the true world sending the reader one or
another wayward or contrary way. Landscapes lead toward coagulation of
landscapes, tethered desire of inhabiting an other. We can't let go of
ourselves, even to read; we huddle, in order to write.


  who is world? communality, consensuality?
  the problem of other minds and the problem of consensual other minds
  (group hallucinations, vijnanavada, dwarf sightings, ufos, etc.)

We can't answer this. We can't answer this without further future know- ledge
in terms of mind. We have experienced, at least once, the connect- edness of
mind, but to generalize from this is problematic. I have no doubt of minding
the world, minding the world of minds. And that one time may well have been
untoward coincidence. Certainly "who is world?" is a proper question to ask,
emanent and organism alike entailed. And certainly we are all emanents, and
certainly we receive differently from different skins, tissue-skins,
sheave-skins, molecular-membrane-skins, one-pixel- thick-skins, true world of
inhering/cohering skins. It is not communality or consensuality that beg
definition, but their absence: what cause the illusion of individuation, the
lived discrete?


At this point, defuge sets in, the intolerable directing of the messay
increasingly turns towards entanglement; nothing is answered or accounted
(nothing is accountable). What to do but abandon the true world to a certain
trembling at the edge - an edge which increasingly moves towards an unknown
center (the real edge where damage begins). And what to do but abandon this
attempt at another accretionary formation or inscription, living in the world
as-if there were a certain human, if not organic, order. As-if is the pleasure
of our senses and disfigurement of slaughter, as if these were speakable
between the axle and the rim (the spokes, too, have their gaps). Let it go. Do
let it go.

hi jason,

to me, the most interesting audio artist with an intense engagement with
language is gregory whitehead. i was producing a literary radio show when i
first heard his work around 1985. not only does he do amazing audio work,
but writes about it extrordinarily well.

http://gregorywhitehead.com
http://ubu.com/sound/whitehead.html

i first heard his work on a Telus cassette. It also featured work by Susan
Stone and Jay Allison. I delved into it, contacted Whitehead, and discovered
a scene of 'audio writing'. It included artists such as Helen Thorington,
who now produces http://turbulence.org . She was producing a series, at the
time, called New American Radio ( http://somewhere.org ). She was
commissioning artists to produce audio art that was aired on NPR and
elsewhere. And she was editing columns on audio art in EAR mag from NY.

Other artists involved in it were Jacki Apple, Douglas Kahn, Pamela Z, and
many others ( http://somewhere.org/NAR/links/links.htm ). These are not all
writers, per se. The backgrounds range around quite a bit. But that's one of
the cool things not only about radio art and the  art of recorded sound, but
also, say, the art of the net. The New American Radio crew was my first
taste of an art practiced by people from many arts, each of whom brought
something special to the art of radio/recorded sound.

The main thing is that they were taking recorded sound and radio seriously
(as well as live radio) as artistic media. I think that's the crucial thing.

One of the main precursors of the 'audio writers' of the eighties was
William S. Burroughs and his experiments with audio cutups. But, also, the
early sound poets, while they weren't doing anything much concerning the
materiality of tape and so on, made some very interesting recording.

But Whitehead, oh, you have to listen to Whitehead.

Dear Jason,

	I am very interested in sound poetry. It seems to me a direction
that could add vitality and life to poetry particularly in the
classroom.  I wonder how sound poetry can be taught in an ordinary
classroom with limited technology resources.  I'm just a poet, but my
son is an audio engineer working on an master's in music / business
at NYU.  Growing up, I used to play the piano and clarinet -- but
that has dropped by the sayside during the years.  I teach at the
University of South Alabama in Mobile -- so we're too isolated from
things that are happening in cities like New York and San Francisco.
Still we have happenings like Mardi Gras (this Tuesday) and it seems
to me that cries and revelry ought to have some cultural play in the
making of poetry.  I would like at least to know a lot more than I do
which is next to nothing but wanting.

Sincerely,

Sue Walker

Poetry Foundation Launches Harriet Monroe Poetry Institute

CHICAGO —The Poetry Foundation is pleased to announce the launch of the
Harriet Monroe Poetry Institute, a new initiative designed to address issues
of importance to poetry by bringing together leading advocates and
practitioners of the art form—poets, scholars, critics, translators,
publishers, arts administrators—and thinkers from all areas of arts and
culture.

When fully established, the Poetry Institute will:

    • Stimulate fresh ideas by bringing together creative thinking and
practical realities, recognizing that a lively presence for poetry in our
culture depends on both
    • Conduct research on issues, needs, and opportunities in the poetry
community
    • Design action-oriented programs and partnerships to benefit poetry


For its inaugural events the Poetry Foundation is collaborating with the
Aspen Institute, an organization with a broad interdisciplinary reach and an
established expertise in convening diverse groups of people. Together with
the Institute’s Harman-Eisner Program in the Arts, the Poetry Foundation is
surveying leaders in the poetry community to determine the most pressing
needs of the art form.

“The Foundation is eager to hear the recommendations and priorities of
poets, and those involved in publishing and distributing poetry, for how we
as a community can work together to the benefit of poetry,” said John Barr,
president of the Poetry Foundation. “The results of the query will help
frame the Institute’s initial program.”

Based on information received from the first phase of inquiry, the Harriet
Monroe Poetry Institute will commission and conduct research throughout
2008. At a conference to be held in Aspen in the spring of 2009, invited
participants will discuss the research, debate findings, and recommend steps
to address the identified needs of the art form. Findings from the
conference will shape the Institute’s subsequent activities, including
research, programs, and collaborations. Ultimately the Poetry Foundation
expects to implement programs based on these recommendations.

The Harriet Monroe Poetry Institute, which will operate as an ongoing
program of the Poetry Foundation, is located at the Foundation offices in
Chicago.

Dear Jason--
i think perhaps by imposing an already pre-formed,  idealized standard of
aesthetic and technical values taken from other areas than Sound Poetry you
are not, of course, finding, much of what is Sound Poetry.  And if one
cannot recognize the elements of an art form which have been developed
through a hundred years nearly of its  "modern history" , then how is one t=
o
recognize them even when these appear in a Hi Fi, "state of the art"
example?

As a charactrer in a story of mine puts it:

"Above all the practice of literature requires a rigorous reading of those
texts which present themselves continuously as  already written,  yet are
not recognized as such,  in favor of those only which one is indoctrinated =
 to
know as  the readable by those who write them."

 And in the NY Times today, in an article on Jasper Johns, one finds this,
with quotes from Johns:

'his interpretation of flags and targets, numbers and letters =97 things, a=
s
he has often said, "the mind already knows," "things that were seen and not
looked at, not examined"'
So it is with Sound Poetry, one listens anc creates in examining those
things which have been heard, but not listened to.

What is the sound, for example, Walt Whitman launches when he writes  "My
voices goes after/What my eyes can't reach"?

The voice trying to reach by sounds things "beyond reach"--"of the eyes"--i=
n
a sense the first sounds a human makes at birth, before the eyes can clearl=
y
see--are the origins of Sound Poetry--as they are of Henri Chopin's "Cris"
in their transits through his manipulations of his vocalizations  with the
use of magnetic tape  and other recording machines.

Since the 1950's there has been a vast amount of work done with using the
tape recording of the voice as a way of expanding the ranges of the voice's
sounds, mixing vocalizations, etc. etc--

A lot of the great innovative work done with the use of recording machines
in the 1950's and 1960's--of course may not sound so "Hi Fi" by today's
terms--but if one studies what is actually being done with the human voice,
the ways the structuring of pieces are created through the use of the
lenghtening of phrases, manipulations of volume, pitch, the juxtapositions
of human vocal sounds in ways never before heard, by cutting them up,
splicing, repeating, rhythmically accelerating or blurring, or driving howl=
s
into a stratospheric chaos of noise, one finds an immsense amount of
material and exmaples still to work with. In these works, the ways in which
the sound of the human voice is sculpted spatially and composed with in
terms of time--i think a lot of the work is still very extraordinary, and
the thinking involved in it, the ideas, is is "advanced" in many ways as
thinking which is still going on with these issues.


Henri Chopin, who was written of recently as he had passed away, was one of
the great pioneers in this area.  The Lettristes worked with some recorded
experimental Sound Poetry, Bob Cobbing did many experiments with tape
recordings--there are many groups from Sweden, England, Canada, Latin
America, Europe who worked along these lines and do to this day.

The use of the voice itself, in Sound Poetry, is not limited in the way it
is by "poetry," in that there is no need for "words;" sound as in the
literal meaning of Zaum, is "Beyond Reason/Rationality" and exploring other
dimensions of expressions not "anchored" by "texts."  The connection with
Visual Poetry is in the use of notations which do not "read" like any form
of standardized text or notation.  In the case of Bob Cobbing, there is no
longer even a "score" or "notation" used at alll--anything--a rock--a side
walk crack--may be used as a visual form with which to respond. We used to
use also the moving shadows of trees' leaves as they moved among the side
walk cracks--via a visual finding, the ear and voice become ever more
"attuned" so to speak to the immediate environment.  Sound Poetry is also a
way of learning to listen with differing attentions, hearing what is the
unheard in plain sound so to speak.

I think perhaps your difficulty in looking for Sound Poetry is you are
looking for what it is not--music, technological "cleanliness,"
"technological and aesthetic achievements of electronic music," standardize=
d
ideas of "poetry" as something limited to the page and defined by sets of
rules or "anti-rules."

There is sound poetry that is very wel recorded, edited and the like, and
that which is very simple, low fi, low tech, basically a document of the
performance, In which the sounds of the voice with all their grains, dirt,
rasps, the air in the room, the haze of smoke or smog or of any moment is
present.  Sound poetry can be done and has been as a kind of Laboratory
work--and as Art Brut--as everything from Artaudian shrieks and howls,
Cobbings' hisses, Chopin's "Cris," the explosive demolitions of Jaap Blonk,
the Terror  Police States expressed by Clemente Padin's work--to uses of
silence and near silence, murmurings, whispers, to the blues-influenced
simultaneously dual-vocalized sound poetry of Paul Dutton.  (This is to nam=
e
just a few of the great many figures who span the decades beginning in the
early 1950's to present.)

Sound Poetry--in a sense--has it appears here/hear a hidden in plain
sight/sound quality to it, in that in being sought after, it is being done
so by all the means of which it is not itself made in the senses defined as
requiring a "sound art" of "sound poetry."  (I.E. "having a sound foundatio=
n
technically, aesthetically, by the standards of other art forms.")

Sound Poetry is a challenge to the conventional ideas of poetry and its
dependence on words, texts, and on music, with its scores and normative
forms of recording, performance, etc.  The use of the human voice, the
oldest instrument, can be made directly or using any technical means of
expression, just as with any instrument.  What is important is that it is a
human voice sounding what it finds, within and around it self as a being, a=
s
a call and response with that which is.

Sound Poetry one might say shatters that "upper limit music lower limit
speech" set of limitations which are imposed as being  "poetry," and which
are intended to limit this to the word alone, or to a limited conception of
music.  Sound Poetry can be a way of expressing those states which are not
defined, limited, tied to the conceptions of words, or of music, with their
attendant systems of control.

The linking of Sound and Visual Poetry has been very productive since Dada,
and many of the  artists I mentioned here were also Visual Poets or edited
and published journals which featured a great deal of Visual Poetry and
related work.

Sound Poetry since Zaum, Italian  Futurism and Dada has also had a politica=
l
element, which has found form especially in many works by Padin and also
Blonk, among a great many.  Chopin was very influenced by the Anarchist
thinker Max Stirner, and Bob Cobbing's Writers Forum was  very often
critiqued for its "Anarchism."

Another aspect of Sound Poetry that is very useful to think on is that on
may make it anywhere, anytime--with the voice, with breathing.  Reading of
the Internet outages in India and parts of the Middle East due to the
problems with some underwater cables, and, today, of the State control of
the Internet in China, one is reminded again that the conceptions of
technology and aesthetics which the electronics give rise to can be as
easily shut off as a light bulb.  There is very much alive the 19th century
idea of "progress" being linked with the technological in terms of
"aesthetics" as in all other spheres of existence.  One of the advantages o=
f
this is that it gives the creation of and obeisance to Authority new degree=
s
of  power, "standards," "limits," and helps to produce control and
conformity.

The direction of what is thought of as being the "highest level" of
information, aesthetics, "Authority," and the like becomes transferred to a
realm which is in fact more easily controlled and limited.

Hi-Fi can become then the representative of that which has passed all the
tests of censors, experts, authorities and become "the purest form of
expression of Values" "of a culture," of a State, of an "avant-garde" which
has become as it were "preserved in amber."

The "avant-garde" has tended to emerge not hand in hand with "most advanced
technology" but with on the contrary, a reversal, in which is introduced
into "art" is that which is hidden in plain sight in "the common thing
anonymously about us" as WCW put.  Think of Duchamp's "Fountain," for
example, or that one-man avant-garde Kurt Schwitters/Merz, with his use of
trash from the streets for collages, his "Ur-Sonate", his Merzbau of found
objects.  A great deal of the most "advanced" work comes from the use of th=
e
most debased and overlooked materials, the lack of equipment, the making-do
of DIY.  Later on, once the artist is famous and wealthy, or the "movement"
has begun to acquire institutional and investor cache--then of course, ther=
e
is the funding and the ability to attract persons as assistants or "new
artists" who are able to use the new technologies.  Butt the genesis of the
avant-garde has tended to come from the street level, from dumpsters and
thrown away newspapers, more than from "Hi-Fi."  What will be found in the
"Hi-Fi" realms at first is more likely to be what is considered already a
"classical avant-garde" conception derived from the earlier forms which cam=
e
out of the First Sound--a baby's cry--the Big Bang--a Chaos--out of which
later on come the words, thee music, the forms, the developments of
technologies.  And when this reaches a point of overload, it flips back int=
o
noise--and begins again--as something other--

The journals Leonardo and Visible Language may be places to take a look for
what you are asking about.  I don't myself, but am sure others here do, and
wish you al the best with your search.

A suggestion though as you know engineering--since after all the
"avant-garde' is a military term, that is where to perhaps also conduct an
investigation in terms of "Hi Fi" as well as DIY.
For a series of "annals of the New Extreme Experimental American Poetry" an=
d
series of fictions, I've found these areas are well worth studying.

I think a lot of Hi Fi work can be done with some engineering/electronics
knowledge and those things which are at hand, as so many of them are alread=
y
in themselves already so "highly developed."

I think in a sense that what you are looking for has many elements however
which would be those which might preclude a great deal of very interesting
and profound work.  At a certain point of the Hi Fi scale, one begins to
enter a realm which tends to become "cleaned" of of the mess and dirt of th=
e
human voice's more dissonant and perhaps dissident expressiveness, outside
the "music/speech" limits.

In a very strange sense, one could say for example that one form of Hi Fi
"sound poetry" might be the kinds of sounds found on the "destroyed" CIA
torture tapes.  There one might find the the "most advanced and highest
levels of techniques" employed in order to force the production of human
sounds, recorded with the most advanced equipments, so that they may be the
most closely "analysed" for any fragment at all, any phoneme, any shred of =
a
morpheme,  that might resemble, amid the "noise," a scrap of "information."

The quality of sound  of "listening devices" from satellites, the productio=
n
of "recordings in/of" space, of undersea movements--there are ever higher
levels of equipment along these lines available at ever lower prices to the
public, so it is possible a new Hi Fi avant-garde could be constructed alon=
g
the lines of equipments found in the pages of journals like Soldiers of
Fortune, as well as at radio Shack.  Again, one can--and people do--develop
"avant-gardes" at street level which one has to wait until they become
"acceptable" as "aesthetics" to find them at what is regarded from the
aesthetic point of view as Hi Fi.

Reading of the methods Al-Queda used at one point to transmit communication=
s
without being detected by the highest quality listening devices in the
world--one finds again the use of the cheapest, "junk" linked in a series o=
f
hookups that leap by the most ingenious means among several different forms
of message carrying, including satellites,  across quite a large distance.
And the only evidence found later is the remains of a dime store disposable
phone.

I perform and make Sound Poetry myself--and hope at some point to have
access to doing much more work with some more developed methods of recordin=
g
than i have currently available.  For notations I use anything at the momen=
t
as well as Visual Poetry notations and even some that are just hand written
soundings written down as one hears them in the head or from the environmen=
t
using the roman alphabet.

Due to the means i have, obviously this is still "low tech, low fi,"
 A question to think on is  what you are perhaps asking for is not so much
the quality of the work itself as the quality of the recording, in which to
some degree perhaps there is an idea that a better level of recording might
indeed elicit a more "classical" Hi Fi High Art form of listening experienc=
e
which in turn is presumed perhaps to be equated with a High Aesthetic
Quality also.

Good Sound Quality in a sense being implied perhaps to go hand in hand with
Good Quality Avant-Garde Hi Fi.  In a sense is this a form of a "Return of
the Aura" within Walter Benjamin's "Age of Mechanical Reproduction," then--=
?

Believe me, I would love to work with some much better equipment than i hav=
e
yet, but i think without all the dirt and mess of working in other ways, on=
e
would not be able to recognize what it is one is finding in entering anothe=
r
level of materials and tools. There are however, already a great many guide=
s
spanning a near century of work and recordings ongoing.

I have some links to add to this for you but my ride for the super bow l is
waiting outside--

Gabriel,

How are you differentiating the "masculine" drive to self-declare avant wit=
h the obvious parallel activities of women such as Mina Loy (Feminist Manif=
esto, 1914) and Valerie Solanas (Scum Manifesto, 1968)? Are their declarati=
ons different? Perhaps more valid? What about women who self-declare avant =
or L=3DA=3DN=3DG or whatever? Or is this an assumption/assertion that avant=
 status necessarily equals male privilege?=20
=20
I don't mean to be quippy here, but I would like you to expand your discuss=
ion on the subject.
In your list of examples of "masculine" avants:
=20
New FormalismLangpo PostmodernPost Avant / AVAnd More Recent and Ephemeral =
VariantsFlaff (flarf?)New Brutalism
=20
It seems that you are conveniently ignoring scores of women who are not onl=

Did I read you completely wrong?

A Frida Kahlo retrospective is coming to the Philadelphia Museum of Art
later this month.  The mega bookstore chain where I work has of course made
certain to have every single book about her and her work displayed front and
center.  And of course they're selling.  This bookstore is located in a
neighborhood of millionaires and billionaires called Rittenhouse Square.
It's a strange place, especially to someone with white trash roots like me,
and yet it's a fascinating STUDY, listening closely to these people,
watching them interact in their zoo of affluence.  Like today, it's an
unseasonable 50 degrees, and these two jewel-encrusted women fresh from the
salon exchange little hello kisses.  Then the one says, "OH, it's SO WARM I
can't wear my new mink coat!" (imagine her saying "coat" drawn out into an
elongated whine and you've got it!)  The other one says, "OH, I know!  I
know!"  OH, these poor, poor women!  Just another day in the filth of the
darkest possible side of the human condition where even the weather can
hamper a life stocked full of boredom and stupidity!

In the past five years Americans in the top five percent income brackets
have INCREASED their wealth by an average forty percent.  Keep this in mind,
always, please, in our time of war.

But I LOVE to fuck with these people whenever it's possible in order to
continue to enrich my studies!  My studies in The Laboratory of the Rich, or
whatever it's called, no official "class" title as of yet (yes, I pun badly,
give me a break).  But Frida has provided a new opportunity!  When
the wealthy art lovers of Rittenhouse bring their Frida books to the counter
I always say enthusiastically, "FRIDA KAHLO IS MY FAVORITE COMMUNIST!"  I
wish this could be filmed, you really HAVE TO SEE the contempt reveal itself
in a pinch beneath the remarkably thin layer of poise that got them to the
counter with their vibrantly colored Frida souvenirs.

The conversations have been interesting to say the least.  Most recently one
man laughed and said, "WELL, her politics were misguided, but her art is
THANKFULLY separate from her politics!"  I flipped quickly through his book
to the painting, "Marxism Will Give Health to the Sick," and I said,
pointing, "That's Karl Marx over her shoulder, see?"  He rolled his eyes,
"Okay, just ring me up please!"  Isn't that funny?  He's buying a book with
Karl Marx's portrait in it, but Frida Kahlo's politics were misguided, OH,
and separate let's not forget!  That's pretty damned funny!

And by the way, ARE HER POLITICS SEPARATE FROM HER ART?  Even if it's a
painting of fruit and birds?  Wasn't the artist a whole person?  Wasn't she
the PERSON she was, with all of her experiences and passion for those who
suffer and need, wasn't she this PERSON, always this PERSON, painting, or
laughing, fucking, living?  I'd like to see what kind of paintings these
assholes in their mink coats and Armani suits would paint THAT'S MY POINT!
The PERSON who painted these paintings everyone wants to gather around to
celebrate was an amalgamation of many finely sharpened splinters of
intelligence and emotion and all of these different parts were communing
with each other to be the whole one behind the paint brush, at least that's
how I see it.  And there's no denying FRIDA! WAS! RED!

The reactions have been SO SEVERE with my little experiment that I've
decided I MUST make a T-shirt for the show at the art museum!  A white shirt
with big red letters on front and back that read:

FRIDA KAHLO
MY FAVORITE
COMMUNIST
YOURS TOO?

At the 2003 Oscars, actor Gael Garcia Bernal came to the microphone to
introduce the song "Burn it Blue," nominated for an Oscar for the film
FRIDA, and he became emotional when stating that if Frida Kahlo were alive
she would be against the American war in Iraq.  I didn't see the Oscars, but
heard about his statement the next day more than once in the context of,
"WHAT'S HIS PROBLEM!?"  What's his problem?  It was one of those moments,
when your country is at war, and suffering is a daily, chronic bloody
reality, and you REALLY SEE how your fellow citizens are living a life of
OPEN denial, with their little twists of collective glib exclamation no
less.  Bernal's near burst of tears when making his antiwar statement get
translated with annoyance the next day and it's a new opportunity to MAYBE
NOT UNDERSTAND but maybe GET A BIGGER IMPACT of how confusing war is in
everyday life, especially from the perspective of the country doing the
aggressing, the country NOT being bombed, the country with a million people
NOT killed and able to walk around eating ice cream, chocolate, strawberry,
YUMMY!  Are we really at war?  Are you sure?  Some days I'm not sure how to
feel about feeling or not feeling about it.  And you, you are on my mind
too, and maybe I'm on yours?

Maybe the threshold of pain is very different from what it has seemed to be?

Why, Hello Julu! And so good to hear from you! Yes, this is a theme that
has occupe ied me for days and days , most of them recent. For example,
what were "electrical recreations" and more to the point, what might one
say about the relative simplicity of the apparatus used for them?? Metal,
the material world, puckers and withdraws, all is spheres and spikes. Ah
but conditions or situations, environem ments, material ecologies, the
very splay of the real? In such a fashion
  metal declares itself.Yes, and how you have filled out these many years,
lovely Julu! Thus de uring the era of steam-engines and diplex telegraphy
- and one must remember that the most of the nineteenth century ran on
batteries, not electrical outlets - during this era, electrostatic
generators were constructed of nothing more than rods, circular plates,
god knows what else...The illustrations of the time for the most part
indicated what? Young women, such as ourselves, in touch with metal,
standing on stools with glass legs, carefully applying dischargers with
rubberized handles, it was as if the real were out of contrl---Or Until,
dearest Julu, one mght speak of that sudden discharge, the orgams sm, the
sudden exaltation of teh he spirit, for we might have concluded then, that
spirit itself were inhabiting the world, a kind of ectoplasm of the
metallic. Matter spoke and no one listened.However (as our words and arms
entwine), it's as if there were a surplus that couldn't be contained - the
experiment of electrocuting the dog for example, or creating the semblance
of hydrogen/oxygen explosion. Which surely is why the models were young
women , with the demonstrator male, the demonstration of the male,
dis/splay. , which is why we are torn together as one, sundered together,
across electronic ab barriers,

which surely are the remnants of those electrostatics, those "electrical
recreations" as we would have them ourselves...

--------------------------------= talk =--------------------------------


Hello Nikuko and you are how? I have been very busy, reading about the
electrical apparatus, electrostatics and dynamic electricity, from the
late eighteenth century, perhaps early to mid-ninteenth century. To be
sure, what a mix of worlds here, electrical theatrics, young men leading
young women into circular frenzy, controlled, I do forget how beautiful
you are, your wet skin, tissue against mine, minds blurred, the
discharges, phenomena Dionysian, the apparatus Apollonian - cleansed,
purified, perfected, holding charge back -I remembver your orgasms, your
body against mine, matter speaking and no one listening for that matter:
the audibility of the world was all bound up in the visible, even the
electrostatic parlor tricks resulted in sounds and sights, the ontology of
what was taken for granted as real. This isn't science, this is the
ikonic; we might as well leave the indexical far behind. There are no
pointers, no measurements, with all of these phenomena, just phenomena
themselves, as if the world were talking, but talking mutely, drenched in
our passion, against our skins and minds.Which perhaps the young women
chose to ignore; I'd imagine they'd choose to ignore it, and which is why

yes, as we would have them, and have us, and have at them and ourselves...

i didn't get the impression, david, that jason was saying signal/noise ratio
was the be all and end all.

one of the things he asked was whether there were poets out there taking
recorded sound seriously as artistic media.

of course it isn't simply about signal/noise ratio in the simple sense of
that term. and jason seems quite aware of that.

when i produced a literary radio show for six years, i started out recording
poets and prose writers reading their work.

then got interested in the sound poets and that history.

and then stuff like burroughs's cutups.

and more or less at the same time came across the work of the 'audio
writers'. these writers were/are taking recorded sound seriously as artistic
media. whitehead's background is in theory and theatre. he's a thinker. and
a very diverse voice. and an imaginative producer. and the best writer on
audio i've encountered.

douglas kahn is another interesting thinker/writer/producer. same with jacki
apple. and susan stone.

these folks are, fundamentally, doing sound poetry. intensely engaged with
voice and language. but they're also not retarded about audio technology.
quite the contrary. they're as good as any audio producer in the studio. and
that's not a sin of fetishization of technology, necessarily, david. that's
just called being able to write to the medium.

the voice is wider than the voice.

the human voice is extended through technology. in many ways. most
fundamentally, the recording allows the voice to carry across space and time
in a way that it does not normally. it's disembodied. it's invisible.

the studio extends it in other ways. the cut is one of the main phenomena of
the studio. the wound. when you cut tape the future leaks out. said
burroughs. the cut has many valences, many energies. whitehead writes
brilliantly about the cut. and a great deal of his work explores the cut in
a profoundly human way. display wounds. the pleasure principle. dead
letters. escalated ziggurat inhalation. these are some of his titles. his
work is all the more human for its cuts.

the attitude (not saying you think this way) that studio-produced work is
inauthentic is grade 1 in audio mentality. i came across, for instance, the
attitude that live radio is better than studio produced radio, is more
authentic and human than studio-produced radio. yet, listening to the audio
writers, it was clear to me that this work was simply deeper and, oddly,
more poetical, more human, in a certain sense, than most of the live radio
or simple recordings of poets reading or performing or whatever. more
engaging. deeper as inscription.

i think it's this sort of thing jason's looking for. not simply a less
scratchy surface.

ja

Gabriel,
=20
How are you differentiating the "masculine" drive to self-declare avant
with the obvious parallel activities of women such as Mina Loy (Feminist
Manifesto, 1914) and Valerie Solanas (Scum Manifesto, 1968)? Are their
declarations different? Perhaps more valid? What about women who
self-declare avant or L=3DA=3DN=3DG or whatever? Or is this an
assumption/assertion that avant status necessarily equals male
privilege?=20
=20
I don't mean to be quippy here, but I would like you to expand your
discussion on the subject.
In your list of examples of "masculine" avants:

David,

Yes, you did misread me.

My post is in part precisely about the so-called masculine dynamics
around the fetish of the /new/, a set of dynamics which work to
"disappear" women from a variety of literary scenes. As it happens few
women do peek through from the earlier era you mention 80-90 years ago:
Djuna Barnes, Natalie Barney, Gertrude Stein, Jane Heap, Margaret
Anderson, H. D., and, as you mention, Mina Loy. Others more
knowledgeable than I have argued that even to be legible as women, these
writers had to contend in a masculinized way.

Given the relatively few number of women there are *to* mention in a
vast field of men, even (and some might argue) especially in the AG
fields, I think it might not be very untoward to suggest that the "new"
is an instrument that functions in part to police the feminine. I think
principally here of the more recent writings of Diane di Prima and
Rachel Blau DuPlessis re these issues. And as both of them read this
list from time to time, I'll not go to speaking for them. I would only
repeat again that within the AG fields (fields that especially fetishize
the new) there seems to be a *worse* track record regarding women.

Both Ed Brunner and Michael Davidson have cast a pretty cold eye on
masculinity in cold war poetics -- Brunner on more bourgeois writers,
Davidson more AG. I like what Davidson says to sum up how the field
functions: "Citing masculinity...is to cite zones of power. A corollary
proposition might be that citing female masculinity cites fissures in
zones of power." (Guys Like Us, 195).

You mention Solanas. Her SCUM Manifesto is precisely about masculinity.
Its purpose is less to create a rupture in masculinity than to frame an
already bankrupt and ruptured mode. Either way, Davidson seems to be
right. My point is that you don't get a lot of guys talking about the
/new/ while also talking about how it's inflected by masculinity. And if
one tries to yoke the fetish of the /new/ as something operating with
peculiarly strong masculine dynamics, well, watch out.

Closest one gets in v recent days to a /new/-affiliated manifesto that
tries to make legible its own gendered nature is the *New Sincerity*
movement and manifesto from a few yrs ago -- which was promptly derided
precisely in hyper-masculinized terms as not being "rigorous" and
intellectual enough.

I am aware that flaff has an R in it.

Finally, I would add that the fetish of the "new" is homologous with
masculinity in general and no political aesthetics in particular: it's
something given to both right and left poles of the field of cultural
production -- and it almost always appears with the mythos of the
"badboy genius shaman" lurking not too far away.

My point is that it seems finally necessary perhaps to cease thinking
via the nominally supplied terms that a whole tradition encourages --
that of, in this case, the idea of the “first or fresh beginning,” a
myth associated with some, usually male, “creator shaman badboy” types.
All of which is so very very high school. High school and harmful.

It’s shocking to me how faithful poets (both male and female) remain to
such a thoroughly unexamined and weirdly heinous series of myths about
production. My sense is that it is only through ceasing to reinvest in
these gendered ideas and tactics that poets will actually wake up from
what amounts to a pretty thorough alienation from their own work and
lives -- alienation both from the material realities inherent in the
field of production, not to mention the world around them.

Best,
Gabriel

This was exactly the brilliant manifesto I needed to spark myself into
motion today.

Thanks for it, Conrad. Perhaps a little spy camera to document your
cash-register encounters would be a good idea.

What I've learned Conrad, is, that's okay to be a capitalist, it's okay to be a communist,
but it is not okay to be Anti-procreation aka

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VHEMT and there are other less nice groups.

The root of evil is not money Conrad, it's people.
Money is language, and language is rooted in the virtuality of affect.

Exploiting that gap is what poetry does, art does, religion does, commerce does.

The only, ONLY political view necessary at all,
Is

stop making these things.
there are too many.
They can be lovely, but mostly
because of language, its knotural ability
to polarize, they're not.

Otherwise, you make a living
from being Pro Affect X versus Anti affect X

The myth is that books make people smarter.
Well enough. It also just makes them more "virulent"

as in dis-ease..

this is "Dis" as in hell.. wouldn't it be nicer
if it was easier?

Diogenes thought so.
I can conclude no other.
and yes, it is sad.

Her art is wonderful. It is political, painfully personal, and sometimes just funny. She just left the Walker in Minneapolis, and I saw so many of her amazing paintings--I had no idea.  I went to two of the free Saturdays and the place was packed--we had to stand in line to get in to see her art. The gallery was packed--lots of humanity, children with their parents, old people, college students, sweating bodies--Frida would have approved.

  I have been to the city (Guanjuato, Mexico) where Rivera was born. He was apparently reviled for his communist views, but after the fact, after he died, he has been welcomed as their hometown artist.

Thanks Jim, you stated that a lot better than I did. And you're absolutely right about what it is I'm looking for and thanks for pointing me in a few directions. Whitehead is pretty amazing and I'm in the process of building up a huge archive of his audio files. I can't wait to get home from work and look into the other folks you mention.

I find this field very exciting and at the same time am kind of awed and humbled that I've been unaware of it for so long. I was an audio engineer years before i started taking poetry seriously, and always had come at it from my practices as a musician. For a long time I've harbored the suspicion that there was a connection to be made to poetry in those things, but generally speaking when you start looking around at general resources for this kind of thing, you almost always get pointed at people who were dead before I was born. Or maybe pointed to burroughs who at least was doing the cut up stuff before i was born. Any further looking into it than that, I generally i've gotten diverted by the sources into further exploration of people like Steve Reich or Nam June Paik. Who are great, but they're composers not poets. So again, thanks for all the advice and direction both here and in your other email.

Thanks,
Jason Quackenbush

I think this is all very interesting, but it does raise a question. I have books by Ezra Pound whose politics I find supremely disturbing, but by and large i don't have to agree with those politics to appreciate his work. What's the difference between me, a confirmed lefty, appreciating a black shirt's poetry, and a wealthy conservative appreciating Frida Kahlo's paintings?

I don't like Frida Kahlo's paintings personally and tend to think she's a bit over rated and that she's become fashionable thanks to Salma Hayek is a bit goofy, but that's beside the point. Can't we separate a person qua artist from a person qua asshole if we want to? Don't we generally do that? If we have to like everybody as a person in order to appreciate their art, I'd tend to think most of our museums and bookshelves would be mighty bare.

You've missed two of the most important poets of the 20th C - Marianne =
Moore
and the Canadian poet, Elizabeth Bishop - who were considered as good, =
if
not better, than their contemporary male poets - although Bishop should =
have
been considered as a much better poet than Lowell who only wrote two =

books of poetry, the others being pathetic.

 What's the difference between me, a confirmed lefty, appreciating a black shirt's poetry, and a wealthy conservative
appreciating Frida Kahlo's paintings?

Another better question might be, what is the difference between a "lefty" and a "black shirt"? The Nazi were National
Socialists.
Are you maybe just left-handed? Because you certainly don't understand the detailed vicissitudes of the lie of human
"political theatre"..

Look at Jonah Goldberg's book. I haven't, but then I don't need to. Once you've noticed the bedsore called the copula
you don't need to look any further. Humanity is proof that God exists, and that It is very stupid!


"Fascists," "Brownshirts," "jackbooted stormtroopers"-such are the insults typically hurled at conservatives by their
liberal opponents. Calling someone a fascist is the fastest way to shut them up, defining their views as beyond the
political pale. But who are the real fascists in our midst?

Liberal Fascism offers a startling new perspective on the theories and practices that define fascist politics. Replacing
conveniently manufactured myths with surprising and enlightening research, Jonah Goldberg reminds us that the original
fascists were really on the left, and that liberals from Woodrow Wilson to FDR to Hillary Clinton have advocated
policies and principles remarkably similar to those of Hitler's National Socialism and Mussolini's Fascism.

Contrary to what most people think, the Nazis were ardent socialists (hence the term "National socialism"). They
believed in free health care and guaranteed jobs. They confiscated inherited wealth and spent vast sums on public
education. They purged the church from public policy, promoted a new form of pagan spirituality, and inserted the
authority of the state into every nook and cranny of daily life. The Nazis declared war on smoking, supported abortion,
euthanasia, and gun control. They loathed the free market, provided generous pensions for the elderly, and maintained a
strict racial quota system in their universities-where campus speech codes were all the rage. The Nazis led the world in
organic farming and alternative medicine. Hitler was a strict vegetarian, and Himmler was an animal rights activist.

Do these striking parallels mean that today's liberals are genocidal maniacs, intent on conquering the world and
imposing a new racial order? Not at all. Yet it is hard to deny that modern progressivism and classical fascism shared
the same intellectual roots. We often forget, for example, that Mussolini and Hitler had many admirers in the United
States. W.E.B. Du Bois was inspired by Hitler's Germany, and Irving Berlin praised Mussolini in song. Many fascist
tenets were espoused by American progressives like John Dewey and Woodrow Wilson, and FDR incorporated fascist policies
in the New Deal.

Fascism was an international movement that appeared in different forms in different countries, depending on the vagaries
of national culture and temperament. In Germany, fascism appeared as genocidal racist nationalism. In America, it took a
"friendlier," more liberal form. The modern heirs of this "friendly fascist" tradition include the New York Times, the
Democratic Party, the Ivy League professoriate, and the liberals of Hollywood. The quintessential Liberal Fascist isn't
an SS storm trooper; it is a female grade school teacher with an education degree from Brown or Swarthmore.

These assertions may sound strange to modern ears, but that is because we have forgotten what fascism is. In this angry,
funny, smart, contentious book, Jonah Goldberg turns our preconceptions inside out and shows us the true meaning of
Liberal Fascism.

I'm sorry Gabriel, I'm really trying to understand where you're coming from=

does the argument that successful female avant gardists are only successful=
 avant gardists through the adoption of masculine modes avoid question begg=
ing inchorence?

as a secondary concern, the thing about the shamanic badboy genius, i'm not=
 sure i buy that as a forever and alltime thing in our culture. frankly, i'=
m a bit hard pressed to think of someone who lived that sort of lifestyle p=
rior to maybe Caravaggio, and it's certainly not the only archetype we have=
 for innovative artists. It's certainly the most romantic, and i think what=
 it says about our culture that we make heroes out of rule breakers in all =
of our various modes of mythmaking is interesting and worth exploring. But =
I don't think our attraction to rulebreakers has to do with their masculini=

e rulebreakers not as anarchists, but lawgivers of a new sort. these heroes=
 are not egoistic sociopaths. The most successfu are all  Ubermenschen that=

ool to get what they want. Whatever else they do is foregrounded by that on=

Gabe,

The alienation you are referring to goes far beyond specific sexual
distinctions and has its roots in the relationships of power in general. It
may have to do with class, with international real politics, as well as
sexual dynamics. In each case, one side imposes its values, its
epistemology, its standards of excellence and achievement on others, making
the other side more or less invisible or quartered, in other words,
alienated from itself. To focus only on a sexual dynamic, making it THE
cause, alienates the others whose alienation derives from other factors. For
instance, a father in Iraq who can not get a job or loses a child (boy or
girl) to a bomb is as alienated as the mother who lost the child. Alienation
is caused by a lack of access to means of communication (an enforced
silence), as much as a lack of access to the means of production.

I agree with you, for instance, that Picasso's art will be seen from a very
different angle if its misogyny -turning a number of his "great" paintings
into sadistic erections- were not underplayed under the rubric of art. On
the other hand, the distinctions between The School of Quietitude and Avant
and further between Avant and Post Avant began to shape the discussions of
poetry basically through Ron Silliman's Blog. I think Ron would  intensely
resent, and I assume rightly so, to be called misogynous. Having come to The
United States more than forty years ago, I have always been intensely
conscious of the cultural, stylistic, philosophical differences alienating
me from the place I had entered. It was assumed all I had to do was "to
educate" myself into it. (Had I not come to Amherst to get an education?) I
refused to do so. The rest of my life has been to use American English to
heal this alienation. But is this not what all poets, particularly in The
United States, do? To see this essential process only as a struggle between
masculinity and femininity forces is I think to deny visibility to many
other energies shaping the poetic process.

Ciao,

Murat

Subject:      masculinity and playing the "transgressor"
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=windows-1252; format=flowed
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

[for names and further examples: http://gabrielgudding.blogspot.com/]

Description: the poet plays the role of righteous underdog, cultural
criminal or sacred heretic.

Elaboration: to play the underdog, the outlaw, the “angry outsider,” the
untrusted, the unloved, the suspicious, the sacred transgressor, the
misunderstood messiah, announcing oneself the maverick, the criminal. To
hang one’s shingle as a disinterested shaman. To declare oneself the
Complicated Outlaw Genius Shaman. To declare oneself the Angry Righteous
Disinterested Transgressing-yet-Victimized Author Ghoul. To declare
one’s friends the apocalypse.

Purpose: To display oneself as the sacred heretic is basically to tout
oneself the next winner in the dialectic of orthodoxy by enacting ritual
sacrilege (Weber). The basic purpose is threefold: to display one’s
disinterestedness in profit in order to display one’s purity of intent
and pure devotion to the art; to display one’s high mind via one’s
principled disgust at the sycophancy and interdependent nature of the
field; to make a show of one's supposed autonomy in an energetic fantasy
of defiance toward the literary community.

This tactic elides the history of collective labor against external
restraints by appropriating that history of labor and putting one’s
label on it. Iteration of the romantic “single actor” or “small cadre”
theory, essentially denying the interconnectedness of all cultural work,
or at least that work that went into making the badboy
victim-transgressor author.

There is further a homologous denial of the interconnectedness of all
being and emotion, which speaks to the masculine privilege of “anger” or
“being a jerk” as a mode of appropriating needs and dealing with
perceived non-affiliates. The so-called transgressor masks this
collective history and suppresses his connection to the field of
production by emotional spectacles (sometimes masked as intellectual
spectacles [flares of argumentation]) intended to draw attention away
from that masking, making it easier to be touted as “the” origin rather
than one result of the entire work done by the host of beings in that
field from readers to reviewers to truck drivers. This is a ready made
author type whose vogue waxes and wanes but is overall adopted
surprisingly frequently. To borrow a metaphor from Stan Apps: the
“transgressor” is a retail product that one buys and then pretends one
found at Goodwill.

Common tactic: to tout what one does as “shocking” or to start or
further arguments and then call notice that one has been attacked as
rebel/heretic/apostate (see Yasusada controversy). And if one is
ignored, to say that one is being suppressed or disappeared and that one
will be exonerated by history.

Poetic bioregion (where found): The tactic of the “sacred heretic” is
used by groups on both the left and right; this is because the tactic as
a meme is homologous with masculinity in general and not with any one
flavor of political aesthetics in particular. Used as a basis for
anthologies at both ends of the spectrum: Alan Kaufman’s The Outlaw
Bible of American Poetry is decidedly leftist, whereas more moderate and
even reactionary aesthetics are covered by the anthologies Legitimate
Dangers (Dumanis and Marvin) and Rebel Angels: 25 Poets of the New
Formalism (Jarman and Mason).

Writing and Wryting


I write daily and when I'm not writing, I'm thinking about writing or writing
in another medium; the world is a world of inscriptions. At one point I
believed there were signs, that the world was inhabited by signifiers which
might or might not have referents; now, after looking repeatedly at tantra and
the casting-off of whatever was found and impeded, I think signifiers might be
nothing except residues of a kind of frisson, the world rubbing up against
itself. Whatever codes there are, and however these codes are manipulated -

they're not the only story, or rather, they _are_ the story but that's nothing
- what's going on in the world isn't story at all. We tend to make scripts of
things around us - that's how we get along. For example, there's the restaurant
script (and this example of course isn't mine) - I enter a restaurant I've
never been in before, but I know exactly what to do; there's a restaurant
script and subscripts; we don't make it up immediately - that would be far too
costly - but rely on constructing, memory, reconstructing, and so forth, and
there we are, eating together. And it's eating together, because scripts, like
the world, are consensual and build community.

Somebody said something like aye, there's the rub of it - and that's it,
precisely; the world rubs one, _worlding_ is a form of rubbing - which makes
virtual worlds such as Second Life all the more perplexed, where rubbing and
any physics has to be _intended_ by someone, a programmer, or nothing would
happen at all. Still, in second life, one might have bodies or rather one might
_inscribe_ bodies with writing, and this body writing I call _wryting_ and it
occurs in the real world as well. For example,

http://www.alansondheim.org/throbbed.mp4

where avatars conform and display to one another, and all these behaviors are
automated from written files called bvh files, which give an indica- tion of
how virtual worlds are in fact a kind of writing. Here is part of a bvh which
produced what you've seen in throbbed:

HIERARCHY
ROOT Hips
{
OFFSET 0.000000 0.000000 0.000000
CHANNELS 6 Xposition Yposition Zposition Xrotation Zrotation Yrotation

{
OFFSET 160.534210 236.940994 175.551743
CHANNELS 3 Xrotation Zrotation Yrotation
JOINT LeftAnkle

This gives the initial positions of the body; later, there are tens of
thousands of numbers that give the node movements from these positions.
Do note that this is an ascii, a text file, and not a binary, not an
executable; the file is executed by a program that uses it as data. In this
sense, the virtual world is always inscribed, digital, just as the real
physical world is not written, but _is,_ and is analog, and tends to wear out.
Nothing wears out in the digital world, and while avatars - what I call
emanents - need electricity to run, they don't need food. Still, given that, I
think that for a conscious mind, a mind used to dreaming, to projections and
introjections, there are no real differences between the virtual and the real,
and there's dreaming, proverbs, tales, stories, poetry, poetics,
hallucinations, hypnagogic imagery, meditations, and the like to show that.

And even though the real physical world isn't written, it's full of writing and
our bodies themselves are always already written, inscribed - full of tattoos,
scars, burns, abrasions, wrinkles, salves, perfumes, calluses, and so forth. I
think it's from these things, particularly from scars, wounds, abrasions,
scrapes, etc., that language descends - that language is first and foremost a
reading of the history of the body, that the body, the physical body, carries
its own primordial memory upon it. That's important, since it's this memory,
these scarrings, that bind us to the earth, to the world, the analogic. The
digital is constructed from that with a bit of a help from the corporate, from
political economy - the digital rides and infuses poitical economy in fact. So
there are digital standards for sampling, for encoding and decoding and
checksums and so forth, and these guarantee that a parsing of the world in one
part of it can be a parsing of the world in another. Think of the digital as an
extrusion, and think, even, of writing as _always_ digital or at least always
discrete, one symbol differentiated from another, from the other, as all of
them together generate meaning within organism and conscious- ness, generate
culture.

An aside here to the effect that _culture is all the way down,_ that any
organism has culture, has learning, has the symbolic, has the digital (in the
sense that catastrophe theory prescribes and describes certain sudden shifts in
behavior or states which might as well be digital, that is _on and off
switches_ operating within potential wells, that is a level above noise which
allows them to function. Recent experiences in fact demon- strate amoebic
memory, even within this one-celled animal without neurons or nervous system.
It's important to think throug this, to see the world as not only processings
but also culturings - if you do that, a very different kind of world emerges.

So where does codework or digital writing come into play here? One might begin
back with culturing - that the world is replete with poetics, that it makes
real, concrete, sense to speak or think of the poetics of the real - that this
isn't just metaphoric. And then one might proceed fur- ther and realize, within
the analogic the digital resides - that the analog harbors splits and leaps, as
the collapse of the wave equation or annihilation of virtual particles shows.
And within the digital, there's the analog as well - the potential well upon
which the digital rides, literally, let there be no mistake about it.

So one might ride the digital as well, perceive the digital as an extru- sion
from the analogic, or a residue, or a system of signs which for the most part
are produced by humans, according to human conventions and protocols, for
example, the tcp/ip structure or protocol suite of the Internet - and if not
this protocol suite, another or an other. Then one writes here, in this medium,
in this temporarily electronic medium (for there might be other sorts of
transmission in the future, who knows? or other sorts now for that matter,
literally for that matter). And within the digital, in which bits bite bits,
every pixel, every character, every moment of the digital is independently
accessible, and every moment is deeply ruptured, disconnected, from every
other. This is why the digital is inherently untruthful; there's no truth
within it, since manipulation is complete and replete within every file, every
domain, every protocol, every instantiation in fact. There are no lies, either,
and if there are narratologies, these reside in sememes embedded or encoded
within the digital, interpreted by organism, often human. In creating in such
an environment, one plays god, or at least deity (in the tantric sense); one
constructs out of nothing, and if I write the phrase, as On Kawara might, "I am
still alive," these letters are, at a very fundamental and concrete level,
completely independent; I could just as well write "lkurj llisihg" or anything
else, literally, again, for that matter, and for the sorts and sortings of that
matter.

Well, I can write anything, I can say anything. And some of what I write just
lies there, and some is performative, in the sense that, if I type

k3% date
Sat Jan 19 01:13:23 EST 2008

at the k3% prompt, the date is returned - the word is not just a word, but an
action, a process, an operation inherent in the reading and writing of it
within an operating system. Now if I type

k7% lkjsfug
ksh: lkjsfug: not found

as you can see, it's still performing, but the operating system is looking for
a meaning or decoding and can't find any or rather finds a kind of
null-decoding which is based on absence. So that electronic writing, with- in a
terminal window is always a performance; it's never static. And it's not only a
performance, but also a communalit, since there are others who may well be
present, even though invisible, uncounted, and unaccountable:

for example are running around on the same machine I am, and I'm aware of them,
even though I don't know who they are. I can find out what some of them are
doing:

jkurck   ttyp9   adsl-75-10-97-59.dsl.frs2c Fri02AM 12:25 -tcsh

for example, but I'm not informed as to the semantics involved, only the
protocols, the surface syntactics.

So one might see codework as a mix of all of this, a kind of dirty or abject
combination, a kind of rupturing, of surface and depth, one producing another
or an other, a kind of drawing-out of the fecundity of the world and its
structure, its poetics. This combination or drawing-out reflects the real
unclarity of what I call the true world, which is the real and virtual world
interpenetrated, intermingled, diffused, effused, as they are for us, no matter
where we think we are, in first life or Second Life or what I call third sex,
which is online sex, as if there were a first or second, which there aren't.

Beyond this, I'm not sure what codework is, even though I've invented or
discovered the term. Here is a program Florian Cramer wrote for me, called
eliminate.pl (it's in perl):

#!/usr/local/bin/perl5

while (<STDIN>) {
         @words = split /[\s]+/, $_;
         @spaces = split /[\S]+/, $_;
 	for ($x=0; $x <= $#words; $x++) {
                 $word_count{$words[$x]}++;
if ($word_count{$words[$x]} == 1) {print $words[$x],$spaces[$x+1]}
                 }
         }

This is based on the Thousand Character Essay, written in Chinese around
fifteen hundred years ago - an essay in which each character is different from
every other; each character, in a sense, is primordial, individuated - an
extreme nominalism. Although I don't know Chinese, I worked with a friend
laboriously translating it. Anyway, I wanted to duplicate this in English - use
a program in which each instance of a word appears only once, that is, at its
first (and only) appearance. Within this, the fol- lowing are still
distinguished: "word" "Word" "Word," "word-" and so forth since these have
different ascii renderings. Here is part of this very essay rendered with the
program:

my writing

I write daily and when I'm not writing, thinking about or in another
medium; the world is a of inscriptions. At one point believed there were
signs, that was inhabited by signifiers which might have referents; now,
after looking repeatedly at tantra casting-off whatever found impeded,
think be nothing except residues kind frisson, rubbing up against itself.
Whatever codes are, however these are manipulated -
http://www.alansondheim.org/examples.txt they're only story, rather, they
_are_ story but that's what's going on isn't all. We tend to make scripts
things around us how we get along. For example, there's restaurant script
(and this example course mine) enter I've never been before, know exactly
what do; subscripts; don't it immediately would far too costly rely
constructing, memory, reconstructing, so forth, eating together. And it's
together, because scripts, like world, consensual build community.

== Now this is at the beginning of the text, and clear, but see what happens
towards the end:

$word_count{$words[$x]}++;($word_count{$words[$x]} == 1) {print
$words[$x],$spaces[$x+1]} }Thousand Character Essay, Chinese fifteen
hundred years ago essay each character other; primordial, individuated
extreme nominalism. Although Chinese, worked friend laboriously
translating Anyway, wanted duplicate English use instance appears once,
only) appearance. Within fol- lowing distinguished: "word" "Word" "Word,"
"word-" forth ascii renderings. rendered program:

== Here, towards the end, the condensation is extreme. One might think of this
in terms of the biblical book of Genesis - and one of the first things I did
was to render Genesis with the program, which resulted, again, in a kind of
_Vac,_ word-creation, creation-word of a primordial sort. I think of this as
codework, since, reading it, it becomes clear quickly - what is happening, what
the structure is - even if the code itself isn't present except as a
disturbance upon another text, an other.
This becomes clearer, perhaps, when the program is applied to itself:

#!/usr/local/bin/perl5
while (<STDIN>) {
  @words = split /[\s]+/,
$_;@spaces /[\S]+/,
for ($x=0; $x <= $#words; $x++)
$word_count{$words[$x]}++;if ($word_count{$words[$x]} == 1) {print
$words[$x],$spaces[$x+1]}}

== Now I don't think of this as a 'better' example of codework than the first
example, even though code is evident here; it's just another sub- ject for the
performative maw.

A point about interactivity: Every writing, wryting, upon reading or sensing,
scenting, is always already interactive; the inscriptive is never _linear,_ no
matter the appearance of lines. Memory, remembrance, is at work, scanning moves
backwards and forwards, moves in chunks, and even syntax tends to jump about,
leap. There is of course an active interactiv- ity, in which the reader/scenter
is required to _do_ something concrete, within a repertoire or potential series
of actions; hypertext is perhaps the simplest example. I've not been so
interested in that, and my lack of interest has to do with worlds and the false
appearance of choice; I'd rather have the running of inscription and meaning go
on about without interruption, as the world goes on about one, even though one
seems to have choice within it. This stems to some extent from my interest in
film; I've never been carried so far in a hypertextual situation as I am when
embedded in the cinematic other which is also the self, selving. The world is
complex and I attempt to deal with that complexity and its perturba- tions,
attempt to deal with the surface codes of the world. This isn't a manifesto on
my part, and in fact, I've produced interactive work as well, particularly in
simple Visual Basic, but I'd rather the interactivity occur elsewhere, within
consciousness.

Here are some links. First, to the most recent series of texts:

http://www.alansondheim.org/pm.txt - here you'll find all sorts of things, from
a report on an airline's first attempts at wireless en route to the derivation
of 'bug' (as in software or computer bug), to the kinds of code early telegraph
operators used, to... a google scraping piece on 'bush fucks' to... an
elimination piece featuring my Facebook superwall. These texts are 'thicker'
than many others, and they're stressed - we were mov- ing temporarily to West
Virginia, and our companion cat of 18 years had to be put down, which was one
of the most traumatic events of my life. At this point, pm.txt is somewhat
diaristic, although most of it isn't.

These are part of the Internet Text, which I've been writing since 1994, a
continuous meditation on the above and other subjects. If you look at the
earlier texts, for example:

http://www.alansondheim.org/net1.txt - you'll find a clearer form of expo-
sition than much of the later work. Since this is from 1994, the Net is very
different, mostly what I call 'darknet,' referncing lower ascii and terminal
windows as standard, instead of the current multi-mediacy. Almost from the
beginning, I wrote through avatars, other characters, who really weren't other
at all (see my file-in-progress,

http://www.alansondheim.org/pn.txt - for an account of the research I'm doing
in this direction).

This is about it at the moment; as you can see, there are gaps, errors (which
I'm interested in), disturbances, in the account. On another, an other, hand,
we can proceed from here, I'm sure.

And thanks for this opportunity -

LOWELL HIGH SCHOOL ANNOUNCES POETRY OUT LOUD CONTEST



WHAT: Lowell High School announces a school contest for Poetry Out Loud:
National Recitation Contest.



On February 6, 2008 at 3:00pm in the Freshman Academy Auditorium, Lowell
High School students will compete to represent Lowell in a statewide Poetry
Out Loud: National Recitation Contest. Poetry Out Loud is a creation of the
National Endowment for the Arts and the Poetry Foundation, and administered
in partnership with the State Arts Agencies of all 50 states and the
District of Columbia.



By encouraging high school students to memorize and perform great poems,
Poetry Out Loud invites the dynamic aspects of slam poetry, spoken word, and
theater into the English class. This exciting new program, which debuts in
Lowell this year, helps students master public speaking skills, build
self-confidence, and learn about their literary heritage.



Lowell students will recite poems by Lawrence Ferlinghetti, Robert Frost, E.
E. Cummings, Maya Angelou, Walt Whitman, and other poets. The Lowell
competition will be judged by Melissa Pennell, UMass Lowell, and Stanley
Hitron, Middlesex Community College.



The top six students in the Lowell High School competition will receive $300
in prizes. The winner will advance to the Massachusetts Poetry Out Loud
contest, co-sponsored by the Massachusetts Cultural Council and Huntington
Theatre. Thirty-one cities and town in Massachusetts will compete to advance
to the Poetry Out Loud National Finals on April 28-29 in Washington, DC,
where $50,000 dollars in scholarships will be awarded.



Poetry Out Loud is possible in Lowell thanks to the financial and
administrative support of the City of Lowell, Lowell High School, Mogan
Cultural Center, Cultural Organization of Lowell, United Teen Equality
Center, UMass Lowell, Merrimack Repertory Theatre, and a host of volunteers.
Suzanne Keefe was the lead teacher at Lowell High School.



Lowell poets Joey Banh, Anthony Febo, Michael Hoerman, and Masada Jones,
with UMass Lowell student Michael Gormley, led classroom visits and after
school workshops. Charles Towers, Artistic Director at Merrimack Repertory
Theatre, offered additional assistance.


WHO:

Featured speakers and participants will be:

Master of Ceremonies: Anthony Febo

Workshop leaders: Joey Banh, Anthony Febo, Michael Gormley, Michael Hoerman,
and Masada Jones

Judges: Melissa Pennell, English Chair, UMass Lowell; Stanley Hitron,
English Chair, Middlesex Community College; Katie Dube, English teacher and
Poetry Club Moderator, Lowell High School



WHEN:            Wednesday, February 6, 3:00 p.m.



WHERE:          Lowell Freshman Academy Auditorium, Paige Street

Let's see, you're working with Bourdieu's concept of the =20
"field" (specifically, that of cultural production, itself located =20
within the field of power);

but you're also working with a political "spectrum" (left-right), =20
apparently implying that relations in the field
of power can simply be translated into the literary field without =20
refraction (which would not be Bourdieu's position);

and then you also use language like "the interconnectedness of all =20
being and emotion"--if your Bourdieuvian account aims at being
descriptive, this last phrase sounds pretty damn prescriptive....

....this unstable (albeit heady!) mixture of sociology and polemic =20
suggests, to me, the perspective of someone who wishes to make an impact
_within_ the field...does your work, elsewhere, aim at reflexivity?

ps--are you arguing that invocations of "the new" are necessarily, =20
transhistorically masculinist?  What about the figure of the "New =20

Were there no transgressive modernist women?  Surely, to say such =20

adequacy of the very gender norms such women were critiquing....

understand what you're saying, and I also seem to recall you saying =20
similar things before. But at the same time, any ideology, and don't =20
kid yourseelf that this position you've taken is above ideologies, =20
that in it's basis co-opts and subjugates any opposition as mere =20
confirmation of its own truth, which to my mind is what you're ding =20
by equating argumentation with the behavior you're speaking out =20
against, the masking of the interconnectedness of culture. it also =20
seems to me that you're denying agency and a multiplicity of =20
motivating factors to any possible opponents. If I disagree with you =20
and I like the role that the sacred heretic or outlaw genius plays in =20=

our culture, it can't be for any of the reasons I do find such =20
antiheroes appealing, but is instead just my own petty self-=20
aggrandizement in service of my cultural power as a member of a =20
privileged group. What you've created is a closed system that brooks =20
no dissent, and that's not liberating anybody from any form of =20
oppression, it's just another mundane totalitarianism. Finally, and =20
most troublingly for me, your approach has implicit in it the =20
assumption that anyone playing the role of sacred heretic lack self =20
awareness of the station they're taking to the larger culture. You =20
seem to be saying that this is something adopted purely as a =20
commercial or political tactic and not as a legitimate engagement in =20
ones own world fully considered and selected for good reasons while =20
remaining aware of the many drawbacks that position holds. The reason =20=

I find this particular line of thought disturbing is that denying =20
that your opponent has good reasons for doing what they do, and that =20
from their point of view a good case can be made for the rationality =20
of their actions, you are denying that those who disagree with you =20
have the ability to freely and authentically engage in the world as =20
they choose to given the possibilities presented to them by the =20
world. To deny that ability, to my mind, is to dehumanize a person, =20
and so, i have to ask, is this argument you're making not in the end =20
the same thing in its ends as the system that you are criticizing.

Please let me know if I've misunderstood you, because as I said, I =20
find your position here to be very interesting.

Whitehead has lots on the net. And there's lots that isn't there, too. One
of my fave cassettes of his is "Writing on Air". This is a collection of
short pieces, some of which are at http://www.ubu.com/sound/whitehead.html
such as "The Problem With Bodies". I wrote a piece for EAR on some of that
work, years ago. Also, I don't see "Phantom Pain" at Ubu. In the eighties,
he developed short works but also longer works ranging from 15 minutes to an
hour that he and Susan Stone were calling "cinema in the head". These were
not radio dramas. A couple of examples on Ubu are "Dead Letters" and
"Bewitched, Bothered, and Bewildered", both of which are very strong works.

I don't see many of his writings on the net. He's developed a whole poetics
of radio/audio in both his writings and his work. The piece I wrote about
his work concentrated on how one can 'read' his pieces either as referring
to what they explicitly refer to or read them as being theoretical
meditations on the art of sound.

Another very strong poet/audio artist is Paul Green. I heard some of his
work back when I was doing the radio show also. Check out
http://www.culturecourt.com/Audio/PG/PGaudio.htm . If you scroll down a bit,
you'll find "The Gestalt Bunker" and "Directions To The Dead End". He did
these in the seventies. They've aged remarkably well. They work as well
today as they did then. Perhaps even better. Digital writers will certainly
find the figure in "Gestalt Bunker" familiar. And we all know the
"Directions to the Dead End."

Like Whitehead, Green is still at it.

Another better question might be, what is the difference between a =
"lefty"
and a "black shirt"? The Nazi were National Socialists.

=20

That post was a joke, right?

=20

Recently I=92ve come across diatribes such as this, linking the American
Democratic party with fascism, peppered with misapplied historical =
details
such as =93socialism=94 being in the full title of the Nazi party, or
Mussolini=92s youth as a socialist. I find the wielding of these details =
an
insult to our intelligence. We know that Nazi stands for =93National
Socialist=94; we know about Mussolini=92s youth, and Hitler=92s =
vegetarianism, and
so on. We also know that democrats, anarchists, socialists, and =
communists
united=97disastrously, alas=97against the fascists in the Spanish Civil =
War. If
the division between the two were obvious enough to fight a war over =
then,
then is it anything other than Republican name-calling and bad faith
sophistry to conflate the sides now?

=20

To my mind, one of the place where Jonah Goldberg et al.=92s sophistry =
of
calling liberals fascists breaks down is in his ignorance of the first =
word
of the Nazi name: Nationalist. With that word, fascism defines itself =
based
on a mythology of the nation-state as the unifying principle of a =
people, in
which discrimination against, expulsion of, and even extermination of
others=97as defined by that nation=92s leaders=97is not only permitted, =
but
encouraged. Leftist politics, on the other hand, with a belief in
class-based identity, has always been internationalist: think =93Workers =
of
the World, Unite!=94 The real question for me is not how the American
Democrats (who, except in rare instances, are hardly leftist at all) may
have something in common with fascism, but how communist governments =
have so
readily turned fascist, glorifying the state as opposed to class as the
unifier of the people. Stalin=92s actions selling out his side in the =
Spanish
Civil War are one example, as is the heralding of =93Socialism with =
Chinese
Characteristics=94 in post-Maoist China (talk about Nationalist =
Socialism!),
but so was the AFL-CIO=92s policy until recently of scapegoating =
undocumented
immigrants as a threat to unionized workers. The tendency towards =
fascism,
rather than the National Review=92s inane idea that we=92re already =
there, is
what we on the left really need to focus on, and root out, I think.

=20

As for where politics and art do or don=92t stand separate, or whether I =
can
like the poetry of Pound or Neruda or Dante or Han Yu with all their
political beliefs, I=92d like to posit that we can like any aesthetics =
we
like. I=92d also like to posit that we also have a responsibility to
understand, and be critical of, the ways in which any aesthetic project =
is
related, implicitly or explicitly, to larger political and economic =
forces
we may like less. This is much harder than most readers have proven =
willing
to work, which is one of the reasons why I think it=92s so essential.

um, i'm not sure what i did to tick you off, but calling pound a
fascist isn't hyperbole he actually was literally a fascist. he spent
world war two in italy stumping for mussolini and spouting anti
american propaganda on state radio.

and this jonah goldberg guy sounds like he's playing mighty fast and
loose with his drawing of parallels. New Deal democracy does not
equal socialism does not equal nazism does not equal italian fascism
does not equal modern progressive political ideals. the suggestion
that they do smacks of the sort of right wing crankiness that's been
rife in american conservatism ever since progressive ideals began
taking a foothold during the first roosevelt administration and it
was suggested that maybe letting the plutocratic tendencies of
completely unregulated market economies run rampant over the rights
of less powerful individuals wasn't such a grand idea after all.
there's an element in the american right that isn't at all fascist
but that believes as an article of faith that if the economy were
just left alone and if government would just get out of its way and
let the market function then everything would be hunky dory in a land
of abundance where every man or woman with the right will to power
can pull himself up by his bootstraps and make the world his oyster.
that's a sadly naive view and its a shame that in this day and age
the argumentum ad nazium is still considered a novel critique of the
liberal idea that if one truly values the individual then one must
recognize that all of us individuals are in this together, and some
of us have it better from the get go that others, while others still
are burdened with challenges and obstacles that no one reading this
mailing list will ever have to overcome. The fact of the matter is
that the fair and decent thing to do is to help a person up when
they're on the ground, and that some people no matter how many times
you pick them up, they're just going to topple over again. It doesn't
mean we don't still owe it to them to hold out a hand when they need
it. And that's the problem with conservatism, is that it equates the
idea that we owe eachother more than staying out of eachothers way
with some diminishing of the achievements of the highly economically
successful. I don't think that's an obvious case at all. A rich
family who pays more taxes than the poor family benefitting from
those taxes is still better off than that poor family is ever likely
to be. Wealth is no more a virtue than poverty is a sin, but in order
to accept that someone who has been successful in the world doesn't
have a greater responsibility to those who haven't been as well off,
that's what you have to say. And that's another article of faith on
the part of the right that they try to wriggle out of justifying by
pointing out non sequiturs like hitler was a vegetarian and that
totalitarian governments often provide expansive public services.
It's just sophistry. Smoke and mirrors and legerdemain deployed in
order to divert attention from the fact that what is being defended
is really just a morally bankrupt and childishly selfish world view
founded on avarice and schadenfreude.

We should take note of what Fernando Pessoa wryly and reductively wrote in =
a
poem in his collection =8CMensagem=B9.

=20
Because the only hidden meaning of things
=20
Is that they have no hidden meaning at all.
This is stranger than all the strangenesses,
And the dreams of all the poets,
And the thoughts of all the philosophers-
That things really are what they appear to be
And that there is nothing to understand
=20
Yes, here=B9s what my senses learned all by themselves:
Things have no meaning =AD they have existence.
Things are the only hidden meaning of things.
=20

This is a bald acclamation of what Jacques Derrida came to call =8CThe
Metaphysics of Presence=B9 where a given experience is simply just as it is
and its meaning unaffected by its milieu.  It might be argued that things
only have the meanings that we impute them with and this process of imputin=
g
meaning inevitably dilutes their essence by re-inventing them on our own
terms =AD based on our own fragmentary and polarised knowledge of them =AD and
through our attempts to understand things we actually transform them throug=
h
our translations and consequently never achieve true knowledge of such
things. To quote Martin Heidegger, =B3This knowledge, which does not need to
exist, can exist only when the object exists.  The object is what is
essential; the knowledge of the object is inessential.=B2 [1].  If we
translate this phenomenon into a paradigm for an understanding of the
photographic process then the visual rather than the contextual becomes of
primary importance, but, interestingly, as soon as we start to interpret a
photographic image, its ontological essence as visual sign becomes diluted
and transmuted, so that the =8Cding an sich=B9 (Kant=B9s =8Cthing in itself=B9)
becomes irrevocably altered, inevitably assuming a new 'guise of
convenience'.=20

Martin Heidegger=B9s Dasein (existence), like Kant=B9s ding an sich (the thing
in itself), is ultimately an expression of something that is ineffable,
which can not survive our understanding of it, and like all paradoxes,
refuses to exist on any but its own terms, just as our experience of music
always eludes objective description, or our experience of heat cannot be
translated into a mathematical equation, so the thing in itself lies beyond
description. As we look at and perceive something we process it as a
contingency, we manipulate it so that it can be subsequently accommodated b=
y
out cognitive processes.  This =8Clook=B9  is an all important interface with
the world and according to Maurice Merleau-Ponty, =B3The look, envelops,
palpates, espouses, the visible things.  As though it were in a relation of
pre-established harmony with them, as if it knew them before knowing them,
it moves in its own way with its abrupt and imperious style and yet the
views taken are not desultory =AD I do not look at a chaos, but at things =AD s=
o
that finally one cannot say if it is the look or if it is the things that
command=B2 [2].

So, how relevant are Fernando Pessoa's observations relevant for poetry
today?  Pessoa wrote with great insight and intelligence, he was possessed
of considerable originality, and must be considered a giant among modern
European poets.

Gabriel,
I've been following along here, and I want to ask for your comment on =20=

some examples to see if I can understand where you're going with =20
this. =46rom past correspondence with you I suspect that one person in =20=

the back of your mind is Duncan, so I'd ask how he fits into all of =20
this. But I'm also interested in how Susan Howe fits in, as well as =20
how her Emily Dickinson fits into your schema.

I'd also be curious as to how H.D. fits into it.

Each of these poets seems to exhibit some of the characteristics that =20=

you list, if I'm reading you correctly, as part of the "angry =20
outsider" brand, which you see as a disingenuous masculine gesture. =20
Yet I have a hard time being convinced because of these particular =20
poets' work.

Duncan, though every bit the angry shaman claiming to be in =20
possession of a superior Poetry, undercuts his pretensions, at least =20
as he's presented in works like Mackey's "Gassire's Lute." I've =20
criticized his attacks on LBJ myself, but I also tend to agree with =20
them too, in weaker moments, when I feel free to call names and see a =20=

little Hell on earth.

H.D. also adopted a sort of vatic stance, and was comfortable =20
pointing in The Gift to "our Aryans of the Midwest."

And Howe, too, seems to position herself as having corrective ideas. =20
And she's certainly harsh with "non-affiliates" like R.W. Franklin, =20
Gilbert & Gubar.

If you've have time, could you speak to these test cases? JP

Murat,

I basically agree with you that these issues involve issues of power
beyond just gender. But what I'm focusing on here is gender. Its
relations to power dynamics in the literary community need to be
underscored. So, that's the scope of my few posts thus far on my blog.

Pierre Bourdieu's /The Field of Cultural Production/ provides precisely
the kind of analysis you suggest. And he does it brilliantly. But he
does not -- and I think this is the glaring error in PB's brilliant book
-- focus one little tiny bit on gender relations in the field of
cultural production -- and these to me are almost *total.* We need more
work about how gender inflects, refracts and reshapes power in literary
culture. Gender and power in literary culture is probably the most basic
issue, hands down, to any responsible understand of consecration
dynamics. Hands down.

Gabe

Then Murat said:

The alienation you are referring to goes far beyond specific sexual
distinctions and has its roots in the relationships of power in general. It
may have to do with class, with international real politics, as well as
sexual dynamics. In each case, one side imposes its values, its
epistemology, its standards of excellence and achievement on others, making
the other side more or less invisible or quartered, in other words,
alienated from itself. To focus only on a sexual dynamic, making it THE
cause, alienates the others whose alienation derives from other factors. For
instance, a father in Iraq who can not get a job or loses a child (boy or
girl) to a bomb is as alienated as the mother who lost the child. Alienation
is caused by a lack of access to means of communication (an enforced
silence), as much as a lack of access to the means of production.

I agree with you, for instance, that Picasso's art will be seen from a very
different angle if its misogyny -turning a number of his "great" paintings
into sadistic erections- were not underplayed under the rubric of art. On
the other hand, the distinctions between The School of Quietitude and Avant
and further between Avant and Post Avant began to shape the discussions of
poetry basically through Ron Silliman's Blog. I think Ron would  intensely
resent, and I assume rightly so, to be called misogynous. Having come to The
United States more than forty years ago, I have always been intensely
conscious of the cultural, stylistic, philosophical differences alienating
me from the place I had entered. It was assumed all I had to do was "to
educate" myself into it. (Had I not come to Amherst to get an education?) I
refused to do so. The rest of my life has been to use American English to
heal this alienation. But is this not what all poets, particularly in The
United States, do? To see this essential process only as a struggle between
masculinity and femininity forces is I think to deny visibility to many
other energies shaping the poetic process.

Ciao,

Murat

Dear Jim and Jason:

I think you have misunderstood and to a good part overlooked a number of
things i wrote of.
 i did suggest some journals and certainly wrote about enough artists and
their work, ideas, regarding writing for the voice--kinds of editings,
splicings, techniques, notations, scores, the relationship with Visual
Poetry--
i am not sure how you missed this--
i also suggested some techniques and equipments that can easily be found and
worked with which to create one's own mobile studios as it were--

i realize what the difficulty is--which is that you want to focus on a very
narrow sliver of the spectrum and as usual i am trying to say there is a
great deal more there already as well as NOW going on that can be
continually studied and learned from, worked with--it is the quality of the
ideas and artistic expressions, not simply the audiophile quality that is
perhaps of more interest to me, as well as the extensions of these into the
world at large as sound recording is used in the areas of surveillance,
eavesdropping, questions of the legal system, Justice, the international web
and its monitoring and being cut off as methods of control to find ways to
counter with other methods of recording--

hopefully these ideas will help others find their ways to the much larger
arena one enters in thinking about the historical development of Sound
Poetry since Italian Futurism, and the inter relationships of Sound
recordings and transmissions which have on the hand the explorations via
manipulations and splicing etc of tapes in the 1950's of Henri Chopin and on
the other hand,--all through the century the development by the military so
beloved of the Italian Futurists of their own methods of recording and
transmissions and the influence of these on propaganda as well as
advertising and commercial and avant-garde works--
(i mention below the works of Virilio and Adorno in this regard--)

Sound Poetry moves among the "Grain of the Voice" and those areas of sounds
all around one that can be used as elements in a composition--

al of these areas as i see as being part of Sound Poetry--because one is
dealing in sounds of voices as they are recorded, transmitted, altered,
mistranslated and the like--and i mean sounds, not just words--as sound go
beyond words, the limits of words--

Sonar is a form of sound recoding--"the Songs of the Humpback
Whale"--remember, a huge hit at one point, recorded with then very
sophisticated means--
as well as the mysterious ability of the new chinese submarines to elude the
Sonar devices of American ships--

all these things are involved with questions of sound and recording and
their possiblities of use as Sound Poetry in relation with the sounds of the
human voice--

(remember the piece Stockhausen wrote in which there is a scoring for a
robot as well as human voices?

before i go further i'd like to point out that something i have written of
before quite a bit re the dangers/possibilities of the Internet being
disconnected deliberately or accidently is happening again right now, on a
very massive scale--

that is the disconnecting of the Internet from very large areas--in this
case most of the Mid East except for israel and iraq--which causes immense
problems in the world financial markets that are hooked up with places like
Dubai, billions of dollars in transactions a day, and has also led to fears
that some kind of event might be planned to take place while Internet
communications are cut off from these areas--

Internet failure hits two continents - CNN.com
http://edition.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/meast/01/31/dubai.outage/index.html ---

Three Internet Cables Slashed in a Week: Has Iran lost all Internet
Connectivity?http://www.globalresearch.ca/index.php?context=va&aid=7987 ---

as happened in Rwanda and happens in Gaza for some time now and in other
areas of the world in which the internet is shut down while behind the
scenes massacres and clampdowns go on--Burma is another recent example i
have cited--

i have also been studying the released documents of the pentagons plans for
Internet warfare, treating the Internet as an enemy--

to address the issues of the studio and the "signal/noise":
a great deal of what i wrote about had to do with people who worked in
studios Jim--which i cited as working in terms of "Laboratories"--

i'll write a bit here abt my own experiences with sound recording and video
work and film--as i have a long time familiarity with these procedures of
editing, composing for tape, for studio and the like--both in terms of
studying the history and ideas involved and doing-it-yourself--

The artists i discuss , especially henri chopin, as i wrote in my post,
were already doing all of the things you bring up in the 1950's--splicing,
manipulating, working in the studio, composing for a recording rather than
"live" documentary works--the 1950's was the beginning of the great eras of
experiment and exploration of what could be done with the new instrument,
the tape recorder--and the human vhoice, the oldest instrument--

for an essay by, essays about, a bio and visual poetry covers and images of
henri Chopin's OU journal:

http://davidbaptistechirot.blogspot.com/2008/01/henri-chopin-individual-sound-poetry.html---

for the 14 pp Traverse-published Visual Poetry notations of my ZERO POEM
with link to the Fluxuations CD on line it is on so you can see a very basic
DIY aspect--

http://davidbaptistechirot.blogspot.com/2007/02/dorian-ribas-marinhozero-poem.html---

i think you misunderstand my take on the technology--and its relationship
with "avant-garde"-- and what might be called "audiophile recordings"--

i say at the end of my piece i hope soon to be able to work with more tools
as some friends here and there have access to various low level forms of
recording boards etc--

 i have done splicing of tapes since high school as ways of showing how one
can produce "fake documents"--
 later on wd alter the "reality studio" by simply cutting and splicing
tapes, overdubbing off of using three tape recorders--and these just boom
boxes and a hand held journalist's recorder i have which is very good--

the same with video and film stock, cutting, splicing, "writing for the
camera" or the recorder--this has been being done for a very long time--i've
done it myself and worked in studios--in making films and videos, as well as
on my own with super 8 mm.

my point is that too often there can be a confusing of the "cutting edge" of
"technology" with the development of "cutting edge ideas" in the
"avant-garde"--as i wrote, historically a great deal of the avant-garde has
emerged from next to nothing in the way of materials and the most basic of
technological equipments--

i audited with his  permission a class Nam June Paik gave at MIT in video
work--Nam June Paik used basically tvs hauled in from the street and junk
stores--and various kinds of magnets at the time--i remember experimenting
with using degaussing machines to increase distortions--by today's standards
the equipment used was very primitive and limited--yet what mattered is the
development of the ideas in working with the materials--the whole concept of
"fast random action" could be easily explored by ceaseless viewing and
altering of Boston Bruins hockey games broadcast on Boston tv channels--

also got to spend a day once working with john Cage on recordings done
randomly and operated by random procedures, broadcast in a basketball court
gymansium and responded with by the merce Cunnnigham dancers--

i've been in professional recording studios of record companies from NYC to
Paris, Sugar Hill records in New Jersey, (my brother worked as a stage
builder/designer for break dancers and was employed by Grandmaster Flash at
one point, so got to learn a lot about his methods in and out of the studio)
studios i in Copenhagen, Boston and Milwaukee--

and have seen/heard in performance many of Sound Poets i mentioned as well
as many others not mentioned--Bob Cobbing, Paul Dutton, Jaap Blonk, Clemente
Padin--and worked on projects with Clemente and spontanenous ones with bob
Cobbing--

so it is not as though i don't have experience and knowledge of many aspects
of these procedures and not as though i didn't write of them in my last
letter in regards to the work being done by Chopin and others since the
1950's--

again, there is an artistic investigation of technology going on which may
be conducted using machines and equipment now considered "primitive," yet
the ideas in the work continue to inspire person working today who have
access to arrays of possibilities that were science fiction at the time--

i think what you are overlooking is this aspect--the ideas involved, the
history of the kinds of notations, writing for the studio, the uses of the
direct inclusion of the performance space's acoustic possiblities in both
composition and recording and a great many other issues--

i wrote that one may study what chopin and a great many others have been
doing for fity years now and find all the ideas one is talking about
still--if they sound poorer in quality--burroughs' own tapes for example
wdn't qualify for any audiophile kudos--it is simply that they are from a
different era and using technologies which have since been superseded in
sound quality--that they don't have the purity of sound of today's
digitalized "evacuated" technologies do--shdn't be found to be an impediment
to essaying an understyanding of what is being done inthe work itself--

as i suggest in the letter one may now purchase some very high quality sound
equipment capable of an incredibly wide range of  work very easily--radio
shack, for example, army navy surplus--

what has always interested me--as it did burroughs--is that the technoglies
may be used and are used--quite immediately for purposes that are locked in
a battle between setting up codes and undermining them--going through or
around them--a battle of ideas which is attacked with the full force of war
becuase that is precisely what it is--information wars, propaganda wars,
advertising wars, the "reality studio" wars--

in the examples i used one has on the one hand the super high tech of the
world's most enormous and enormously funded military and surveilance
agencies and on he other the "insrugency" methods of Al-Queda which made use
of disposable cell phones that were linked via seriesof hookups including
staelties to communicate acorss large distances from the midst of a
continaul onsluaght of bombings and attacks--

each time one syetem is built, another will be imagined and constructed to
attmept its subversion--

these also are sutdio produced works with "written for studio" messages of
sounds--just as the miliatary makes use of sounds transmitted in all osrts
of mideia at all sorts of frequencies to cause ppsychological breakdown or
even the shaking down of walls--(Burroughs himself wrote and spoke of the
latter use of low wave frequencies)--

you write that burroughs says a splice creats a leakage for the
future--yes--but whose future?--burroughs is aware of this and trying to
alter the future which the nova mob has in store--

the question of a studio becomes altered also due to the high quality of the
recording equipment now available--the intermixing of "real" and "fake" is
done seamlessly--so that a studio really becomes mobile--not a specific site
at all--but one that is able to be quickly transported to another "safe
house"--or, simply doing one's work in the midst of things, on the street,
on a park bench--"hidden in plain sight/sound"--

one can create events which never happened and which alter drastically the
events which are predicated on them and follow them--

i don't know if youhave ever seen Brian di Plama's film BLOWOUT?--itis al
about the splicing of sounds that have been recorded and trying to match
them up with frames of a film--and then in the ened the recorded real
sounds, which are prevented from being used as "evidence" against powerful
indiviiduals, wind up becoing the screams of a woman in a slasher film--

another film of the 1970's devoted to sound recording is The Conversation
directed by Francis Ford Coppola--

rmember the famous missing 18 minutes in the Nixon Watergate Tapes?--

what i have been trying to write of is that al these methods have been being
investigated and thought about for quite some time now--in relation with the
uses of recorded sound and images, their juxaptositions and editings, as
well as writing for the recorder, scripts and notations, scores that are
aimed solely at being recordings, not at all "doucmenatry" of life events,
but things one is able to do only in the studio or at an editing table--

i think before dismsissing the older work due to sound quality, one needs to
find out what it is the persons are doing, what are the ideas, what are the
notations they used--is their work in the particular case a "written for the
studio" piece or not--there needs to be more inquiry before making snap or
snappy judgments, drawing generalized ideas--

henri chopin, bob cobbing, philadelpho menezes, the Lettristes, the Swedish
groups of the sixties, many many more--since the beginings of the use of the
tape recorder as an instrument in itself to be writtern for or scored for,
composed with, played with--i think al these artists' works need to be
studied and receive the recongition for their ideas and experiments,
theories, manifestos, demonstrations, recordings, conferences--there is a
vast history there which if one begins to study and listen, opens up a great
many ideas that can be developed on in further and other ways using the new
equipment--

also  with the tehcnological one needs to keep in mind those forms which are
indpendent so to speak--things which can be battery powered for example--as
opposed to the dependence on the plug in connections--as this news from the
Mid east makes clear--and this report on the Pentagon's plans for internet
war--

to me the positive aspects of technology are the guerrila forms of it--which
burroughs investigated very much--and which have gone on since the invention
of the new techonoglies--

 the very first 20th century avant-garde, Italian futurism, proclaimed the
love of machines and war, "the world's hygiene"--the Futurists were
exploring the uses of film, photgrpahy, aa new architectural urbaism, and
sound/noise before World War 1.  Their intense focus on speed and dynamism
they saw clearly to be connected with the technological advances of the
automobile, the airplane, the ne forms of machine guns, tanks, aeiral
reconaissance and the production of immensely loud industrial and military
sounds.  The Futurists invented a great many new instruments and wrote
manifestos on the uses of noise.  In their work one finds the first open
embrace of the dual miliitary and artistic meanings of the term
"avant-garde."

Paul Virilio has written a great many superb books on art, aesthetics,
technology and the military--

the Nazis were the first to explore the uses of the media for
propaganda--Adorno has some excellent essays on the use of tones of voice on
the radio to evoke emotions and control their directions ideological by the
sound of a voice, its intonations and pitch, in simply pronouncing a word--

and then strings of words which go to forming a "totalizing" mind set which
one is taught to obey and which shapes the will to the directions given by
commands--of Authority figures in whatever realm one is tuned into at the
moment

it is not different really from American television, which disguises
propaganda frequently as infotainment mixing with "news" "stories" that are
as carefully composed as any poem--
as i wrote i hope this year to be working with higher quality equipment for
sound poetry than i have so far, although the sound i have recorded is
pretty good for what it is--

gabe,

i had been wondering what role the poet plays and why one would ask such a
question in the first place.  what is the role of the poet.  what kind of
question is that.  what is the role of the contemplative.  havent read an
explanation that is reasonable on that one.  but if being reasonable doesnt
matter too much, then youre off and running.  one interesting thing for me
is that your discussion is couched in terms of critical praxis, which i am
entirely rusty at, but i guess the problem for me with such a praxis is it
dissects things from the outside.  sometimes this is very interesting but i
dont and probably never have seen what it has to do with poetry.  so.  i
mean, when asked why a poem is a sonnet rather than free verse, the poet is
allowed to say, - because i like it that way. - because it suits, because it
is true, yes, but also because that is what the poet liked, that is there is
a notion of loyalty implicit in the truth value, as also i think in values
of freedom.  in the same way, if you end up getting to be the cowboy way out
ahead of the herd, and my grandfather was a cowboy in his youth and so this
is not pretention on my part, but if you get to do that work, it is ok to
say this is my work just because i like it that way, because this is the
world i see, this is what is true.  it is also ok to try and find out what
that means rather than trying to spin gold from imaginary assumptions
without the slightest bit of evidence in real terms.  this world from the
outbound is worth trying to talk to.  and the ringing ironies in such a
position are painful indeed, how badly one measures against the smoke once a
candle is gone.

one thing about fabricating histories from smoke that have no concrete
grounding in actual fact, is that i think you have to translate them into
some kind of abstract critique.  because in embodied, everyday terms, they
WILL NOT hold water.  how fun to destroy a beautiful truth and make it
something ugly as though it never existed in the first place.  in
cyberspace, you can do anything, if you dont care if your world becomes a
fake cartoon.  some peoples lives are so microengineered it is truly
heartbreaking.  well a bug in amber cant do anything about it but, think,
one of the things about the lists scapegoat submissions, which were delayed
when fred was so very ill, was the kind of spectacle and gratification
generated by the pariah.  i wonder if anyone can write a poem about a
society without pariahs, wirthout your favorite persecutee, after all, dont
the persecuted secretly enjoy it?  isnt there some secret masochism god
given to every returning sadist who cant admit a mistake.  i wonder if there
are any poems about avenging a fathers death out there, or about nice,
intimate; but not too time-consuming conversations with shotguns.  - he
needed killin - used to work just fine in court in the west.

without my library i cant add speculations about H.D. or others right now, i
would have to look up the details, some of you do just fine without your
library.  sorry.  just offhand i would say that pounds line including -- we
grub the soft fern shoots -- has such depth and sensitivity to his subject.
it grieves me to find that lacking so often in discussions.  it does, it
always will.  as if, again, the object position is one which enjoys
persecution and silencing.  no so, colleagues, not at all, of course.  but
the obvious and the unremarked are not the same thing in this case.

what is the world -- who is in the world -- how can we heal the world --
these are important questions, like asking who is God and how can we know.
those questions take years and years to even begin.  and henri nouwen is
indeed the rilke in the background somewhere in those words. ...  who a
fellow poet is, strikes me as not terribly interesting, especially when it
is so much more interesting just to sit and take a look around.   who each
poet is, it just strikes me as not that interesting.  speck of dust kind of
thing.  there are just a lot more important problems.

thinking about eternal things goes well on caol ila whiskey or orval
trappist ale in this cold, if you ask me.  the cold here is just fine by me.

be well.

my 2 cents

Hello!

I'm excited to see such an interest in sound / audio poetry.

Despite all historical practitioners, it seems to be a field which remains almost wide-open in terms of possibilities.

The work I've been engaged in for the past several years might better be described as "noise poetry" than sound or audio poetry since it foregrounds unexpected sounds, distortion & extreme manipulation of the voice through electric effects.

I'm posting here because I'd like to share a recording of a performance I gave some time ago.  All the sounds you'll hear are my voice + electricity...  Thanks for listening... (http://www.badnoiseproductions.com/sounds/Mr.SoundBoyKing.mp3)

glad to see this exchange --

jason, the most interesting question of yr post, i think, remains unanswered
in a big way -- what journals / means of distribution are there for this
material? i can understand yr frustration with the mountain of sound poetry
recordings on the colossal archives -- much of wch is hermetic / embedded in
a discourse next to impossible to access.. .

david -- i love yr post & read it eagerly for there is much by way of this
material that was only distributed hard copy before some growing interested
parties were around (myself included -- wherein there is only the internet).
you offered some more links -- PLEASE DO -- what means of distribution to
you now see as vital to innovative sound / vocal / poetic work?

re: LO FI HI FI -- maybe where much of this extends into other nominal
entities? -- say, extended vocal technique by artists like joan la barbara
on down -- DIAMANDA GALAS is a hifi operatic sound poet? -- robert ashley
has a voice.

& i agree, jim, radio / transmissions artists are doing some of the most
interesting things in this realm.

>

you can see some tracks i recently segmented / compiled for pennsound
HERE<http://writing.upenn.edu/pennsound/x/Whitehead.html>-- i'm
corresponding with gregory to get more of this material up on the
servers in the weeks to come so stay tuned! (he latest work indeed is
astounding) -- most interesting, you can hear gregory's take on his art from
a live reading he gave at segue recently. he is an excellent writer.
wireless imagination (a text made w/ douglas kahn) & the entangled webs of
radio / communications theory is particularly interesting from this sound
poet back-track, i think.

a lot of the most recent material in the realm is shuffled by the good
people at free103point9 in brooklyn.

but that returns to, i think, the more pressing question of changes in
dissemination. gregory mostly records for BBC but also releases on small
labels or with galleries. & there was
TELLUS<http://www.ubu.com/sound/tellus_11.html>(we've put a number of
newly digitized items online recently), but more
interestingly, there once were networks of cassette exchange. you question,
somewhat bizarrely to my ears, jason, if there are cd-r zines! aren't cd-rs
obsolete with digital network exchange?

where, david, jim, or those plugged in, do you get the most interesting
material now?

bang for my buck (time dollar) are the music blogger sharity pages clustered
around totally fuzzy. continuo <http://continuo.wordpress.com/>, closet of
curiosities <http://closetcurios2.blogspot.com/>, (the immense archive
at) mutant
sounds <http://mutant-sounds.blogspot.com/> -- for on hand immediate
examples -- constantly upload interesting sound poetry works from all around
here & then -- many of wch (ANNE
GILLIS<http://continuo.wordpress.com/?s=anne+gillis>,
for examplary) blur in the ways this strain prods towards.

some words but still at a loss -- an OU styled digital update i don't kno
of. maybe in europe (david?).. .

this is interesting & happy to read thru bear on. (always up for back
channel shares!)

yrs,
danny

The reason I find this particular line of thought
disturbing is that denying that your opponent has good
reasons for doing what they do, and that from their
point of view a good case can be made for the
rationality
of their actions, you are denying that those who
disagree with you have the ability to freely and
authentically engage in the world as they choose to
given the possibilities presented to them by the
world. To deny that ability, to my mind, is to
dehumanize a person,
and so, i have to ask, is this argument you're making
not in the end the same thing in its ends as the
system that you are criticizing.

It sounds very much like what Wayne Booth calls
"motivism."

See here:
http://arts.uwaterloo.ca/~raha/Booth-site/pages/Glossary/Motivism.htm

However, it seems to me that Gudding is describing
social phenomena without naming names--therefore he
avoids ascribing a specific motive to a specific
agent.  I don't know if this makes any difference in
any real way though...

This is interesting.

Somewhat in light of current issues surrounding the Spiral Jetty, there is, I found, a quite intriguing 1973 Lucy Lippard conversation with Smithson and Holt in the current  Art Forum:

 [OUT OF THE PAST: A CONVERSATION ON EVA HESSE]
 Hesse's interest Beckett, rejection of the  sexual bondage inherrent in object & subject relations among minimalists (Lewitt, Judd, Andre) , formalism versus an interest in decay,  psychoanalysis, and  her  shared commitment with Smithson  to  writing  are fascinating.  As well as early issues of feminism in relationship to the big boys, including Hesse's Interest in the way an art object made by a woman is manifestation of a mystical penus.    Utlimately, unless it's already been done, I suspect the issues raised in this conversaton, will have some bearing on the relationships between minimalism and the rough early relationships between language poetry and feminism (and/or the dismissal of male or female interest in the personal, including biological). Hesse's works. absorption in the organic/biological certainly (often humorously) flew  in the face of the serverity of Judd and company.

 Anyway, good juice for thought. And, in the spirt of 'all politics are local', please don't forget that guy, Jim Jemmings in Utah to protest the potential of any provision for drilling operations, etc. in the vicinity of the Sprial Jetty. If you need any ideas,here is what I wrote the man:

  I understand that the State is considering whether or not to permit oil operations in the close vicinity of Robert Smithson's Spiral Jetty, For a large public - in the USA and Abroad - this work is one of the major art sites and signature sculptural statements of the 20Th Century. It is a well known public destination site and the work has been the subject of countless essays, books and photographs. To defile the site with industrial activity would be a disgrace to both the site of the art work and the State of Utah.

  I suggest the State will profit much more from supporting the custodial care, attention and celebration of the Spiral Jetty than permitting its willful desecration. I encourage your office to cancel further consideration of this permission.

  Thank you ,

DALE SMITH - SUSQUEHANNA - NOW AVAILABLE


This book contains the first part of Dale Smith's Susquehanna, a sustained meditation on the value of failed vision -- particularly the inability of a young Samuel Taylor Coleridge to fully realize his Pantisocracy on the banks of the Susquehanna River in the early 19th century. Thinking this failure through the cultural and technological developments of the present moment, Smith develops a methodological approach within the body of the poem grounded partly in Walter Benjamin's materialist historiography and David Antin's talking meditations on anthropology.


64 pages.


 Perfect-bound with three-color letterpress wraps. Like the Wingbow Press edition of Ed Dorn's Slinger, parts of the book were set in Caslon Old Face. Parts of the book were also set in Baskerville Old  Face, Palatino Linotype, and Georgia. Interior images culled from various 18th century New England primers. Front cover image of Britain culled from John Sellers' 1690 Hydrographia Universalis. Rear cover image from Sellers' A New Systeme of Geography, 2nd Edition, also printed in 1690.


Parts of this poem previously appeared in Kadar Koli, Madorla, and Damn the Caesars.


 $10.00 (Paypal. Check. Money order.)

The "Punch Press" menu option to the right of the DTC webpage will lead you to Smith's Susquehanna and other Punch Press publications.

well, david, you gave jason a lecture, mistaking as a desire for less
scratchy recordings his desire for work that takes the medium of recorded
sound seriously as artistic media. and i pointed some of it out. so then you
gave me a lecture on being narrowly focussed on the audiophilic.

writing sound is a matter of layers/channels and sequences/takes. that is
the 'architecture' of writing sound, sort of like the architecture of this
message is a string of ASCII characters. imagine recorded sound as a
writing.

imagine the time when writing existed but very few knew how to write. a
conversation between homer and a not so humble scribe. just write it down
like I tell you, boy, says homer. homer, you moron, this is not a tape
recorder, says the scribe, it's a different medium. in the future, he says,
people will understand that editing and meditating on phrases and layering
work--editing, in short--is a natural part of the writing process, and
they'll understand it isn't simply a silent coding of speech but is also
other things. and poets will be their own scribes, as will other
people--writing will be almost as widely understood as speaking. imagine
that. and i'm not going to be there. poetry's gonna change, homer, you can
bet your butt on that. but i love ya, says the scribe. you are the grandaddy
of it all. tell me that line again, please.

line? says homer. don't give me that pythagorean technical mumbo jumbo for
the sake of zeus, boy, speak plainly. plainly. poetry. you know. poetry.
quoth he with bardic exasperation.

i think they drank a bottle of wine together later, though, david. or maybe
during.

cheers, david.

More on mid-19th century notions of static and dynamic electrical fluid



Electrostaticks ii


(julu)

Now, Nikuko, we are ready to begin. We left off with puckered and warped
matter; I'd say that matter in that configuration is ikonic, that is,
mute, that is, relegated to itself, to its own inertness, of which the
fluidic, austral and boreal, is but inhering and ontological. Think of
this as electrostatics.

And how so indexical? Pointing to what attribute, if not the beauty of
your eyes, Julu? I fail to comprehend, I falter, tremble.The caress is
dynamic - no, fucking is dynamic, the caress is static; the caress is an
ontological assembly of one more more representatives of organic, emanent,
or machinic phyla.

There is such difference between on one hand the telegraph and on the
other the sphere or point or line, whatever plays among ludic electro-
statics, which are theatrical, of and for an audience, social.

Yes, it brings disease to the closed surfaces of the real, and things seep
within. Dynamic electricity requires grease, oil, sweat; statical
electricks require nothing more than the light touch of a beautiful girl's
hand

Your mouth is mine!

(nikuko)

And then, Julu, there is the Other, dynamic electricity, which is of
motion, measurement, gauge, and transport; electrons move in complete
circuits, surround and are surrounded by fields, mutual inductances; such
would be indexical.

Indexical by virtue of pointing elsewhere, the electrick a guide or guided
or channeled. In the dynamic there is a split and motion is regulated, as
it is not among the electrostatics, within which it is sudden, of a
moment, orgasm.

You put it perfectly, as your eyes wander, Julu, but there is more. For
the transport of electrons clouds the very nature of substance itself, for
of what atoms are they composed, and what of the flow? I would say that
this is a materialism imbued with spirit, and this is why ectoplasm and
other fluids, for example magnetic, make sense.

And don't forget the most important point, perhaps, that electrostatics
ride the surfaces of objects, they are sheave-skin; dynamic electricity
rides internally through wires and cable (although towards the outermost
layer of these as well). What is dynamic occurs in a potential well, is
hidden; what is static occurs on a vulnerable surface, always discharging,
on the verge of collapse - the defuge of the material world.

Then again or once upon, the defuge of the material world is, is it not,
the exhaustion of internal mechanism, the closed wall? Or the corrosion of
batteries and wires?

Where, and what of these? But I would say that the defuge of the material
world, and one need only look at the images, photographs and engravings,
is ectoplasm itself.

Ectoplasm remains mute, is mute, but is always slightly abject, dirty,
covered with saliva, spit, and so forth. It brings disease.

Your mouth is mine!

screams and cadence


listening to CB radio in Morgantown, the first, breaker2, is an odd
melange of screams and cries - filtered in breaker2filter. I imagine these
are taken from a film or produced in some audio program; they're frighten-
ing. the breaker1 is a sequence on channel 6 with the dead air edited out.
I'm fascinated by cadence and rhythm here. I'm working with 02 radio,
short-wave, scanning, vlf, low frequency, crystal, listening to anything I
can receive. our place is hampered by a location in a small hollow near
the middle of the town - too much interference from the power grid, not
enough radio visibility. On the other hand, the screams, if screams they
be, came through loud and clear.

Thanks Jim, although now I think the next time I read a line from the
iliad it's going to hard not to imagine it being read by Foghorn
Leghorn.

I just want to say that I've found the interchange between you and
David and both of your views on the field very helpful. I feel like
i've got a lot of listening and reading to do, and having read
through both of your comments, i feel like i have some excellent
starting points for further investigation.

I also want to thank all the folks who've come out of the woodwork
and backchanneled me to share their own work and talk about their own
experiences. I get the impression that, where what David says is true
and that a lot of this stuff has been going on for a long time, at
the same time we're maybe right now entering into a new chapter
thanks to the populism of cheap audio technology capable making audio
editting a more accessible medium to folks who want to work with it.
A number of folks have sent me email talking about similar interests
and questions and being involved in DIY audiotext and several good
discussions have happened as a result. All in all all good things and
very exciting.

Toward that end, I'm thinking of creating a central location for
these sorts of experiments and investigations on the web, possibly
with an eye towards producing a journal of sound poetry distributed
on CD-R at some point, and also to facilitate community and
interchange of techniques and ideas for people who are interested in
this sort of poetics specifically. Once I get it up and running, I'll
be sure to announce it to the list, and I hope that everyone who has
had their interest piqued by this conversation will participate in
the project and help shape it into something that can help them in
their work.

thanks,
Jason

Possibly. I once had a class with Tom Rhea, a fascinating
curmudgeonly man well known in certain circles for having been the
guy who wrote the users manual for the original mini moog
synthesizer, who was fond of commenting that the consumer public is
stupid as evidenced by the fact that they selected the audio cassette
as a favored audio medium over the vastly superior audio quality of
LP records. It's interesting, to me at least, looking at the history
of the distribution of audio that almost at every turn where new
media has always been selected for convenience over sound quality.
Still, there has always been a desire among certain wonkish
audiophile segments of the public, usually people who are serious
rather than casual listeners, for greater fidelity in the recording.
Given that audio poetry requires serious listening, i think it's
possible to make a good case that there are higher standards of
distribution quality (as opposed to production quality where really
anything is fair game) just as is the case with music recordings
aimed at the audiophile demographic. To that end, i think it might be
interesting to treat audio poetry the same way. Granted MP3 is a
pretty good lossy compression algorithm. However, it is still lossy,
and the compression process as a result will always produce audible
artifacts, even at higher bit rates. The idea that there might be a
CD-R or DVD-R distribution is attractive because it allows not just
for compressed audio distribution, but other possibilities like dolby
encoding, CD quality 16bit/44.1khz audio, as well as saving people
the time of downloading and the necessity of maintaining the network
bandwidth for huge audio files. which is a boon for folks like me
whose broadband options are limited or nonexistent because of where
we live.

Thanks,
Jason

Poetry has to be a dynamic living entity, has to assert its vitality, to
retain a  connection with its evolutionary urge - theory has to continually
re-invent itself to avoid extinction - life is fighting a losing battle
against entropy, but unless it evolves at a rapidly accelerating rate,
theory is already dead in the water. The written word is undergoing
cataclysmic change as it is increasingly released into cyberspace while its
paper-bound cousin becomes more exclusive and elitist.  The digital ether
voraciously consumes the torrent of words that enters its apparently
infinite spaces. As the potential for accessibility increases so the routes
of access proliferate and the number of permutations for access swell, so we
have the paradox of a more accessible generation of digital poetry that gets
lost in the complexities of its medium. Theory simply can't keep up with the
proliferation of the word in cyberspace, like a hunter submarine whose
technology is being perpetually superceded by that of its prey, the drip
drip drip of life, whose entropy assails theory, has been superceded by the
torrent of text in cyberspace, so instead of a relentless erosion, theory is
now threatened with rapid annihilation. Poetry continues to evolve and to
exceed its parameters, so we must be increasingly flexible in the way that
we perceive and receive it while theory is increasingly threatened by the
sharpness of its cutting edge. If beauty has been consigned by theory to the
role of romantic anachronism, then the sublime spaces of cyberspace have
out-manouevred theory and re-established a need and a desire for beauty,
beauty has evolved, has been transmuted and poetry must discover is new
codes. Forget theory as it vainly fights extinction, focus in on a newly
re-invented beauty.  As Derrida's 'Metaphysics of Presence' challenges the
hegemony of western philosophy, so poetry needs to beak new ground and shrug
of the constrictions of theory.  I am sorely hoping that this proposition of
mine will be addressed, in contrast to my last three contributions, that
have been totally and irrevocably ignored - am I trying in vain to break
into an elitist circle here? Or is there room for a divergence of dialogue?

  I'm not sure about avenging, but his father's suicide figures prominently in much of Berryman's work, especially his late period. I do have my library handy. I may be able to find an avenging poem in the  Dream Songs,  that brutal and beautiful suicide note.

  gabe,

i had been wondering what role the poet plays and why one would ask such a
question in the first place. what is the role of the poet. what kind of
question is that. what is the role of the contemplative. havent read an
explanation that is reasonable on that one. but if being reasonable doesnt
matter too much, then youre off and running. one interesting thing for me
is that your discussion is couched in terms of critical praxis, which i am
entirely rusty at, but i guess the problem for me with such a praxis is it
dissects things from the outside. sometimes this is very interesting but i
dont and probably never have seen what it has to do with poetry. so. i
mean, when asked why a poem is a sonnet rather than free verse, the poet is
allowed to say, - because i like it that way. - because it suits, because it
is true, yes, but also because that is what the poet liked, that is there is
a notion of loyalty implicit in the truth value, as also i think in values
of freedom. in the same way, if you end up getting to be the cowboy way out
ahead of the herd, and my grandfather was a cowboy in his youth and so this
is not pretention on my part, but if you get to do that work, it is ok to
say this is my work just because i like it that way, because this is the
world i see, this is what is true. it is also ok to try and find out what
that means rather than trying to spin gold from imaginary assumptions
without the slightest bit of evidence in real terms. this world from the
outbound is worth trying to talk to. and the ringing ironies in such a
position are painful indeed, how badly one measures against the smoke once a
candle is gone.

one thing about fabricating histories from smoke that have no concrete
grounding in actual fact, is that i think you have to translate them into
some kind of abstract critique. because in embodied, everyday terms, they
WILL NOT hold water. how fun to destroy a beautiful truth and make it
something ugly as though it never existed in the first place. in
cyberspace, you can do anything, if you dont care if your world becomes a
fake cartoon. some peoples lives are so microengineered it is truly
heartbreaking. well a bug in amber cant do anything about it but, think,
one of the things about the lists scapegoat submissions, which were delayed
when fred was so very ill, was the kind of spectacle and gratification
generated by the pariah. i wonder if anyone can write a poem about a
society without pariahs, wirthout your favorite persecutee, after all, dont
the persecuted secretly enjoy it? isnt there some secret masochism god
given to every returning sadist who cant admit a mistake. i wonder if there
are any poems about avenging a fathers death out there, or about nice,
intimate; but not too time-consuming conversations with shotguns. - he
needed killin - used to work just fine in court in the west.

without my library i cant add speculations about H.D. or others right now, i
would have to look up the details, some of you do just fine without your
library. sorry. just offhand i would say that pounds line including -- we
grub the soft fern shoots -- has such depth and sensitivity to his subject.
it grieves me to find that lacking so often in discussions. it does, it
always will. as if, again, the object position is one which enjoys
persecution and silencing. no so, colleagues, not at all, of course. but
the obvious and the unremarked are not the same thing in this case.

what is the world -- who is in the world -- how can we heal the world --
these are important questions, like asking who is God and how can we know.
those questions take years and years to even begin. and henri nouwen is
indeed the rilke in the background somewhere in those words. ... who a
fellow poet is, strikes me as not terribly interesting, especially when it
is so much more interesting just to sit and take a look around. who each
poet is, it just strikes me as not that interesting. speck of dust kind of
thing. there are just a lot more important problems.

thinking about eternal things goes well on caol ila whiskey or orval
trappist ale in this cold, if you ask me. the cold here is just fine by me.

be well.

my 2 cents

Two very different stories--
both concerned however with economics' effects on/with art
and with the Roma, the most "Outsider" people of Europe--
ironically--there is also in the Arts section a piece re the "Gypsy" of a
new production of Carmen

the Roma article is about not just being Outsider people, but the art being
also a lot of it what is classified now in the art world as "Outsider"--
and how this affects the perceptions of the people themselves for the
non-Roma
a kind of double-bind

also the rise of some right wing "Guards" who are anti-Roma

Shouldn't our intellectuals be held accountable? Chomsky was on the pentagon's pay roll for years. His stock portfolio is anything but progressive. & his speaking fees are exorbitant.
  He lives in a highly fashionable, pricey Mass suburb. I doubt if he's spoken to a working stiff or non -academic in years. I don't think the guy is a phony, but he is compromised.

JP,

It is not possible for me, in any meaningful way here, to answer your
questions. I can /respond/ -- which response I'll limit to this: the
thesis that "the new" is foremost a means of policing the feminine is not, =
to
use your phrasing, "my schema." It is one of the most widely felt but
undertheorized phenomena in the field of production. It in fact arguably
defines not only the field of AG production as a whole but letters in toto.=
 To
even appear to argue the point by trading interpretations of the biographie=
s
and works of supposedly representative women, especially in this apparently
hostile venue, is to ignore, if not elide, the truth of this structure. And=
 I
know that's not your intention.

Beyond that, based on the gist of your questions, I would refer you to
DuPlessis's /The Pink Guitar: Writing as Feminist Practice/. She says
succinctly and exhaustively what it would take three weeks to say on this l=
ist.

Thanks for your post.

Gabriel

<<Gabriel,
I've been following along here, and I want to ask for your comment on
some examples to see if I can understand where you're going with
this. From past correspondence with you I suspect that one person in
the back of your mind is Duncan, so I'd ask how he fits into all of
this. But I'm also interested in how Susan Howe fits in, as well as
how her Emily Dickinson fits into your schema.

I'd also be curious as to how H.D. fits into it.

Each of these poets seems to exhibit some of the characteristics that
you list, if I'm reading you correctly, as part of the "angry
outsider" brand, which you see as a disingenuous masculine gesture.
Yet I have a hard time being convinced because of these particular
poets' work.

Duncan, though every bit the angry shaman claiming to be in
possession of a superior Poetry, undercuts his pretensions, at least
as he's presented in works like Mackey's "Gassire's Lute." I've
criticized his attacks on LBJ myself, but I also tend to agree with
them too, in weaker moments, when I feel free to call names and see a
little Hell on earth.

H.D. also adopted a sort of vatic stance, and was comfortable
pointing in The Gift to "our Aryans of the Midwest."

And Howe, too, seems to position herself as having corrective ideas.
And she's certainly harsh with "non-affiliates" like R.W. Franklin,
Gilbert & Gubar.

If you've have time, could you speak to these test cases? JP

Really? Chomsky being on the pentagon's payroll is news to me. I'd be
interested in reading up on this. Where'd you come  across that?

Jim, Jason, David,

Three days ago, I began to write a response to Jason's original query.
IBefore I finished it, I decided not to go on with it. Though sound and its
complex and in some ways oppositional relation to performance is of supreme
importance to me, I felt what I war writing was perhaps too far off from
what you were discussing and were interested in. After Jim's post today and
his riff on Homer, I changed my mind. Here is what I had written.Mine was
going to be longer, but there is enough in it anyway:

"Jason,

When Ron Silliman developed his idea of a new sentence, he based it on the
transformation of poetry from performance to a more reading (and
subliminally seeing experience) after the invention of the printing press.
He sees the poetry of the New Sentence as the culmination of this
distinction between poetry as performance, experienced basically as uttered
speech, and poetry as read language. In the slower intricacies of read
language, the textural displacements the new sentence might create
("torsions"), Ron sees new possibilities for poetry, a dynamic (a new
"concrete music" of torques) those distortions might create.

You are after, it seems to me, a digital poetry, reflecting possibly the
consuming importance of computers in our lives today. This is a very
interesting take; but, before saying where I agree with you, let me say
where I see a significant difference. The New Sentence was based on an
actual fact, that in the United States a person receives most of one's
poetry experience through the page. The computer is not *yet* the medium
through which most poetry is received, or experienced. The computer, as far
as I can tell, has not yet established a distinct mode of reading for
poetry, except maybe enforcing an element of speed, like surfing. This
difference is important, though I am not yet quite clear in what. One may
perhaps discuss it later.

If paint is the basic material of painting and sound of music, words are the
basic material of poetry. I can imagine letters to be the synthesizing units
of a digital sound poetry. In a number of poets' works, for instance, in
some of Alan's, a series of consonants appear in sequences or combinations
next to each other. These poems remain on the page, silent - as conceptual
or as concrete poems with a visual dimension- because the human voice can
not "perform" these consonants all against each  other. The resistance they
create is too great. But each letter uttered and recorded individually can
be then synthesized digitally. I can imagine a pointillist music made of
these mixed sounds, the *wave* of music they may create. For instance, one
may take all the letters of "Apres-midi D'un Faun" and create a chromatic
digital poem out of it, as a pendant to Debussy's piece of music on the same
poem. Jason, would you be interested in such a joint project?

I think the relationship between Seurat's "Un Dimanche Apres-Midi,"
Debussy's "Prelude A L'Apres-midi D'un Faun" and the project of a digital
poem around the same poem is not accidental; but has a plot. Seurat's
painting is filled with a giddy scientificism which permeates the painting,
not that different from the giddy excitement with which the digital poem is
embracing the new computer technology. Debussy is breaking down the
traditional distances separating notes, the way in a digital poem the word
or syllable as a unit of sound is broken down into letters often as
consonants compressed, impacting against each other. On the other hand, both
Debussy's piece and this project refer to Mallarme, the great skeptic of
technology, creator of a resistant space full of chance.

Ciao,

Murat

 A couple of new pieces

 Ann Hamilton: her new Tower at the Stephen & Nancy Oliver Ranch
 Last spring, Ann Hamilton, the artist,  completed a tower. 86 feet tall, maybe 30 feet in diameter, composed of 250 tons of concrete (the structure is anchored by a 65 concrete pier into the earth, the last 10 or 15 feet(?) is pierced into solid rock). Inside, at the base, is a reflective pool....

I can only post one more time tonight. Briefly, Chomsky's "Aspects of the Theory of Syntax" was produced with money from the Joint Services Electronic Program (U.S. Army, UlS. Navy, and U.S. Air Force) as well as the U.S. Air Force Electronic Systems Divisions.
  When questioned, Chomsky quibs, "Do you think you are not working for the Pentagon? Ask yourself about the origins of the computer and the Internet you are now using." As though I'm equally implicated because I use the computer. Such bullshit.

  Chomsky, our man of the people, is fond of tax shelters. Boston's venerable white-shoe law firm Palmer and Dodge (funny name, Dodge) set up an irrevocable trust to protect his assets from uncle Sam. Chomsky favors the estate tax and massive income redistribution, but not HIS income.

  & he does charge 12,000 dollars a pop for lectures.

  He finds that corporations make damn good investments. He throws his money into blue chips and the TIAA-CREF stock fund. Many of those abhorrent companies he derides isn't reason for him not to profit-- name it, he's fond of oil companies, military contractors, and pharmaceuticals.

Hi all--

Apologies, but Danielle Pafunda's lecture (see below) at Columbia
College Chicago was canceled tonight because of inclement weather.  The
college shut down all classes and events after 5 p.m.

(I didn't think the storm was that bad myself.  But I don't own a car,
and I'm sure automobile travel issues played a big part in the decision.)

The lecture will be rescheduled, probably for later this month.  I'll
send out a notice once the new day/location is decided.  Thanks--

Best,
Tony

if we can think of recorded sound as a type of writing, then the 'page'
looks like a timeline that has multiple channels. And each channel can have
multiple divisions into different cuts. as in the interface to a multi-track
recording piece of software such as
http://www.sonycreativesoftware.com/images/ss/lg/acidpro6-callouts.jpg ,
which is the interface to Acid, a popular multi-track recording/editing
piece of software.

of course this is the architecture of film also, only the basic unit in film
is the frame, whereas in sound it's the much smaller sample. you can edit
both audio and video in Acid.

audio and film are spatialized, as a writing space, into a two dimensional
timeline with channels.

interactive audio replaces the timeline paradigm with that of the flowchart
(e.g. http://bayimg.com/oAFLFAaBC ). flowcharts allow for decisions.

director, flash, Max, and other multimedia/programming authoring tools are
hybrid timeline/flowchart media writing spaces.

Ok. One more question and then I must retire:

 So, if New York State voted for the war, and if I receive an artist
grant from New York State, am I on par with Chomsky?

If by "on par" you mean as open to criticism, then no. You haven't achieved
enough to be worth attacking by any available means yet.

And just to chip in a little more, this in particular
seems a bit ass-backwards:

> I doubt if he's spoken to a working stiff or non
-academic in years.

== given that the thrust of Chomsky's domestic
politics is American Activist Left, and the major part
of his speaking is to non-academic audiences.

(That was one of the subtexts of Sokal and Bricomart's
_Intellectual Impostures_ that everyone commenting on
the book seemed to ignore [another was the amount of
space devoted to epistimology], that the
post-modernists that they slagged off -- the one
notable axception to their condemnation was Foucault
-- were busily avoiding direct political action and
engagement.  It was, inter alia, an Old Left critique
of Posture Politics.)

Nice to see a post that manages to get everything
quite so totally wrong.  <g>

Subject:      Electronic writing, approach
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII; format=flowed

Electronic writing, approach


Electronic writing is always protocol-based and always dynamic. Keyboard
strokes signal interrupts, the screen-image is constantly refreshed, fonts
are interchangeable, links and animations may be present, the text may be
updated by the original author or modified by others, the text might be
deleted once and for all, or temporarily deleted, or duplicated and
transformed from one to another site, or printed out hardcopy, or faxed,
or entirely transformed into another medium - audio, steganography, online
or offline calligraphy, and so forth. The text is fluid, inherently
non-canonic, every instance is equivalent to every other, every instance
is original and plagiarism. The text is burdened by apparatus from ebook
reader to desktop, cellphone to electronic billboard. The text requires
maintenance, electrical current, to continue its electronic presence. The
text requires the transparency of protocols to be present, presented. The
text requires an interface from electronic hardware-software circuitry to
visual or other presentation. The text requires busses or connectors from
one component to another, and from internal electronics to display. The
text also requires data storage, and encoding/decoding as well as the
potential well of checksums and other means ensuring minimal errors. If
the text is transferred from one hardware medium to another or one file
format to another, it requires interoperability - an interoperability
which leaves the surface of the text relatively inviolate. The text
requires data storage which itself exists within a physical potential
well, producing the semblance of at least momentary stability. The text
requires light or sound or haptic or other sensors. And the text requires
a relatively stable input environment, within which the interrupts are
apparently operating smoothly, transmission is relatively clear from
infractions or appears clear from such, lag is sufficiently small and the
buffer sufficiently large to give the writer/programmer/artist at least a
degree of illusory autonomy.

Let us not forget that machines, habitus, economy, are required. That the
stability of signs and sign systems are required. That mutually understood
sememes are required. That languaging among a community of more or less
speakers/writers is required.

The text itself, per se, requires nothing. Nothing is required unless com-
munication, beyond the communication of error, anomaly, distortion, annih-
ilation, creation, exchange, displacement, condensation, theft, hack,
repetition, meta-transformations or meta-signifiers based on the bracket-
ing of the text - unless communication based on at least the semblance of
interiority, is desired; in this sense the author is ghost, wraith, close
to invisible beyond, beneath, the text, perhaps present at the birth of
the text or system or links of text, and perhaps not.

And this list, drawn from apparatus, habitus, text, language, economy,
catastrophic and stable regimes, may be extended or diminished - the terms
are variable, problematic; the 'worldview' stemming from the true world is
equally problematic.

Nonetheless: The text, and one might of course argue that each and every
text is always already dynamic, that such is the nature of communication,
written or spoken or otherwise. Still: One might or might not make a
distinction between traditional texts and those that are up for grabs in
relation to electrical and other dynamic forms of reproduction, whose
outputs are also dynamic, at least to the extent of redrawing/rewriting/
rewryting the image or text or social/creative internal and external
content and positioning of the text.

Now further, what is it that we teach, that is normally taught, if not for the
stability of the canon, or stability for that matter of jodi.org or other
entities and projects and productions or producings which are not stable
whatsoever but are part and parcel of literature today, however such may be
defined? Unless literature is confined to the printed page, in which case it is
also confined to a relatively small corner of electronic- social life today,
that is, confined to a relatively small and perhaps irrelevant corner of life
itself. So perhaps it is time, and of course in this space/place I am preaching
mainly to the converted, to teach litera- ture as a residue or heartland of the
social-technologic, as a production of desire, at least to the extent of the
desire to be produced, in rela- tion to literature as theory or language or
other artifacture? In spite of the fact that theory is essential to
hermeneutics and the reception of literature. In which case, literature might
be approached top down, or sides-in, lateral, so that, for example, the
existence of the external flash drive, conveniently plugged into a machine for
extra memory, operat- ing system, creative software, text repository, would be
inherently part of the questions: What, how, why, when, where do we write?
Where are our writings deposited? What hope do we have for their survival? What
about _this particular text_ within this particular environment - a momentary
housing at best? What about momentary housing? Obsolescence? And so forth?

From a related discussion with Sandy Baldwin, Frances van Scoy Azure Carter:
Given the above, what are the software issues themselves? What are the textual
or graphic or other interfaces employed? What are the esthetics of those
interfaces? Since every interface both transmits and filters, what are the
conditions of transmission, and what is filtered out, what artifacts are added
in? Is the interface considered an object or a process (continual updating of
beta, name+number (Quicktime 7.4 for example), is it purchased or free, open or
closed source? What is the user control over the interface and what is the
interface's control over the user? (For example, user-specified fonts may
override monospaced fonts in a text apparently involving graphic-ascii or other
presentation.)

Further, there are phenomenological issues related to traditional media, to
media in general: What is the genre-lens we're using in reading/looking
at/processing/hearing/etc. a text? What is the history of the genre? Of genre?
How does genre relate to canon and is the text considered canonic? Is it
considered a finished text, an object, a process, an unfinished text, a
variorium, an ur-text, a meta-text, a critique of another exemplary text, a
system of procedures or modules or sub-modules? Further, is the text considered
part of a cycle? Of a community of texts? Written by one or more authors? Is
the user part of a community of users, for example a book club? Was the text
written for a community or specific community? What theory, if any, is used to
approach the text? What is the text's relation to that theory? To theory? Who
wrote, programmed, created, tended, the text? Is the text interactive,
reactive, stationary, mobile within the interface, apparently within the user's
control, out of the user's control; does it alter the interface framework,
collapse or appear to hack into the framework? And is the text designed to be
read/viewed/ heard/etc. with a particular viewer in mind? With a particular
person or group or groups of people?

Finally, is electronic writing textual? Can one speak of an 'electronic
text'? Is electronic writing _read_? Are there other ways to approach it?
(Is electronic writing an 'it'?) I want to argue against canon, genre,
static or state approaches, I want to argue in favor of a general field
phenomenology of organism, inscription, inscribing, emanent, machinic and
other phyla, wryting and other processes, I want to think through no final
solutions, no stages of consciousness, no conclusions, no edifices, no
thing, other and no other, I want to argue against this messaying, this
lack (what did I forget, what did I leave out, what have I gotten wrong,
what don't I know, what did I express poorly if at all?), I want to argue
against argument, I want to argue the favor of your

Alan,

Do you know Todd Dockstader's 'Aerial' series of electronic music recordings
on Sub Rosa Records?  He spent a decade recording the broadcasts, noise,
static and interference from short-wave radio and then edited the results
into about 80 hours worth of sound then further edited this into 'Aerial'
1,2 & 3 which amounts to about five hours of wonderfully atmospheric sound.
If you are interested in electronic music maybe we can share information.

hiyas.
i'm really serious about production value too
for several years in the mid-1990s i worked in recording studios with
various producers and then as my own producer
some of that was in electro-acoustic environments the delivery of which
required dedicated sound "projectionists"

such as at UEA electronic music studios

and it won't have escaped everybody's notice that a lot of the early sound
poetry festival work was presented and even made at Fylkingen in Stockholm,
pretty state of the art at that time (mid 1970s)

i was involved in alternative radio in the UK over recent years too setting
up an RSL with Kirsten Lavers (Radio Taxi) making work for Hearing Is
Believing, Tork Radio and Resonance FM

i totally agree about Kahn and Whitehead's "The Wireless Imagination" as one
source
there are several decent books on Radio Art . . . maybe Daina Augaitis and
Dan Lander's "Radio Rethink" is my other pick

Horspiel . . .German radio Art would be a way to go more generally imo as
would more historically the Radio Ballads made by Charles Parker in the
1960s (an inspiration for "Coleridge's Rime of the Ancient Mariner" tnwk
made a few years back . . . still some info at
http://www.radiotaxi.org.uk/mariner/detail.html)

more generally the airwaves in the US are often way too bland but Martin
Spinelli's programs "Radio Radio" offer some delights . . .

personally i am exploring using Max msp live processing along with Ableton
Live

BUT . . . i don't tend to do any such thing at "poetry readings"

this *might be the first year that i begin to

although the poets will likely moan

"where's the text?"

well they've been saying that for years with me so go figure but . . . and
poetry venues aren't generally set up for good sound (i had an exception at
Cue in NYC a couple of weeks back so maybe 'things' are gonna get better??)

nobody yet mentioned the work that Susan Howe is doing with David Grubbs


thanks for raising this discussion

love and love
cris

No. Being a resident of New York doesn't implicate you in the war anymore than my being a resident of Washington, D.C., and having won a D.C. Commission for the Arts grant implicates me with Fenty's administration. I'm not taking my weekly  paycheck from Fenty, nor am I involved with their policy decisions. Chomsky is a different matter entirely.
  Chomsky's position as the leading American intellectual, and his income level puts him in a different league. He doesn't struggle to pay rent, etc. Listen, in many ways I admire the guy. In fact, I sometimes post in the hope that I'll be proven wrong because there's so much info floating around, and it's difficult to discern what is and isn't bullshit. Because the people on buffalo.edu are especially well informed, buffalo seems the perfect forum in which to air my concerns.

Concerning Chomsky's portfolio: His reply seems disingenuous. Unless I'm able to buy my produce from a Farmer's market, I, too, am implicated. Chomsky's privileged, but he doesn't care to admitt it. He makes a rather glib case for moral equivilence.

  Look, I read the guy and admire him. And I hope my assertions are proven wrong. But I've been hearing this stuff for years and these charges, as far as I know, haven't been properly addressed.

In fact, my stock portfolio is TIIA-CREF, the standard for academic pension funds. But it's totally irrelevant, for the reasons I mentioned, which are understood very well by poor and suffering people, and those who are seriously working for badly needed social change. They don't give a tinker's damn whether you hide what money you have under a mattress or put it in a bank or pension fund, in which case, of course, you'll be part of the corporate system, just as you are when you make a purchase from a corporation.
All of this is very familiar. Communist Party hacks constantly condemned dissidents because they wanted to radically change the society, but participated in it and hence benefitted from it.
There is, incidentally, a case to be made for socially responsible investment, and there are interesting initiatives that merit support, and contribute in limited ways to badly needed social change, but only in extremely limited ways as compared with the kind of activism that your sources are desperately attempting to undermine. But extricating oneself from the system is simply a major gift to centers of power, a fact obvious to the victims, which is why one hears these absurdities only from people are desperate to protect power and privilege. All pretty obvious, when you think it through.

and in response to
"...This "socialist" professor charges over $10,000 of dollars for a single appearance."
Chomsky wrote:
This is a flat lie, as can be discovered with two minutes of research. I never ask for a cent, and if there is an honorarium, I ask that it be given to some appropriate organization like Oxfam or UNESCO or others, and if that can't be done for technical reasons, do so myself.

Shouldn't our intellectuals be held accountable? Chomsky was on the pentagon's pay roll for years. His stock portfolio is anything but progressive. & his speaking fees are exorbitant.
He lives in a highly fashionable, pricey Mass suburb. I doubt if he's spoken to a working stiff or non -academic in years. I don't think the guy is a phony, but he is compromised.

Gabe: If you raise a position in discussion you take on the
reponsibility to answer questions about it. Otherwise discussion
would be a matter of exchanging booklists and meeting again in a
couple of months (assuming that one had nothing else to do).

I'm not hostile to the idea, I just don't buy it. That "'the new' is
foremost a means of policing the feminine" is a pretty extraordinary
statement. Foremost? This is way beyond oversimplification. But I'm
willing to be convinced. Messianic statements seem to be all the rage
this political season. I seem to be immune to them.

 Where Abstract Starts
 Joseph Ceravolo

 I sit here it is 4:00
 Should I say it?
 Death occurred to me
 And the fit over bounded
 My physical thought
 As I lie here
 It must be my underlying thought
 Know now where it comes from
 Know now where abstract starts
 I sit here, I lie here
 It is 4:15

I'm resending this, as it did not get through the first time...the =20
last part shares Mark Weiss's skepticism re. your global
claims about "the new"

Let's see, you're working with Bourdieu's concept of the =20
"field" (specifically, that of cultural production, itself located =20
within the field of power);

but you're also working with a political "spectrum" (left-right), =20
apparently implying that relations in the field
of power can simply be translated into the literary field without =20
refraction (which would not be Bourdieu's position);

and then you also use language like "the interconnectedness of all =20
being and emotion"--if your Bourdieuvian account aims at being =20
descriptive, this last phrase sounds pretty damn prescriptive....

....this unstable (albeit heady!) mixture of sociology and polemic =20
suggests, to me, the perspective of someone who wishes to make an =20
impact _within_ the field...does your work, elsewhere, aim at =20
reflexivity?

regards
Nick

ps--are you arguing that invocations of "the new" are necessarily, =20
transhistorically masculinist?  What about the figure of the "New =20
Woman"  Were there no transgressive modernist women?  Surely, to say =20
such women necessarily contended "in a masculine way" is to simply =20
assume the adequacy of the very gender norms such women were =20
critiquing....

Gabriel,
I'd ask you for a little more patience with me. Please don't assume =20
that because I'm questioning your formulation that I'm willing to =20
elide "the truth" of your claims. I asked for clarification of your =20
claims through discussion of representative figures. I intend no =20
hostility, as you note. I'm not willing to concede you're right =20
either, as I see this issue a bit differently. I think.

Since discussing particular artists' work--I didn't ask to discuss =20
bios--won't work for you, I'll take you up at The Pink Guitar. It's =20
just this sort of work that I'm coming from.

One think that I see going on in this book is that DuPlessis is =20
teasing out the problem of the new and hegemony. She seems to praise =20
The Golden Notebook for its attempts to enact an "anti-authoritarian =20
ethics" at the "level of structure" and says that we call such =20
efforts "new." And she adds that "new" has "signaled antithesis to =20
dominant values."

I asked you about Howe in particulate because she's an interesting =20
case when you're dealing with novelty and gendered power. As =20
DuPlessis notes, Howe "works in issues of transcendence" and =20
"impossible political privilege." I really like DuPlessis's =20
suggestion that the question of how to write is a question of how to =20
"gather authority without authoritarian power." Howe often brings the =20=

old into a new light and new structure; she refuses, as DuPlessis =20
puts it, to be belated.

I'm concerned that we proceed very carefully on this, me and the =20
mouse in my pocket, I suppose, because I don't want to dis-able any =20
woman or feminized, marginal person trying to find a way to work, to =20
"gather authority without authoritarian power."

DuPlessis later says in the chapter/essay on Howe: "The female use of =20=

this 'feminine' of marginality and the avant garde use of this =20
'feminine' of marginality are mutually reinforcing in the work of =20
some contemporary women: Lyn Hejinian, Kathleen Fraser, Beverly =20
Dahlen and Howe. This mixed allegiance will naturally call into =20
question varieties of flat-footed feminism."

So that's very much where I'm coming from when I asked you about =20
cases when you wrote that novelty is a purely masculine gesture, that =20=

claiming to possess some truth is a purely masculine attempt to =20
market oneself as Moses from the Mountain with the Tablets(tm). It =20
seems more complicated than that to me. And theories often grow more =20
fuzzy at the edges when you apply them to cases.

Respectfully, JP.

Where Abstract Starts
Joseph Ceravolo

I sit here it is 4:00
Should I say it?
Death occurred to me
And the fit over bounded
My physical thought
As I lie here
It must be my underlying thought
Know now where it comes from
Know now where abstract starts
I sit here, I lie here
It is 4:15

Roy,

I appreciate your images here of words gettin sucked
down this mesmerizing vortwx, so inviting & so empty,
never to really accumulate, lost yet somewhere, where
poetry DOES seem to "live" in the sense of has a code
to be retrieved (all I have to do is type in the word
or a name), not spirit but the merest ghost of matter
that matters continually with the scantiest of
possible implications.

But I'm not sure what it has to do with theory or
beauty.

What happens in cyberspace doesn't really happen at
all, perhaps this is what you mean, that "it" whatever
might happen has to be taken outside, as in outside
the text?  By someone some how.  But if that's true,
why do I always end up back here?

I apologise for rambling, but I thought you deserved a
reponse.

Thanks
Peter

Hi J.P.
you guys are losing me in the critical theory here, it's alien to the intel=
lectual tradition i generally find myself and my favorite thinkers thinking=
 in, but i want to follow because it looks like an interesting discussion. =
what's the ethical problem with taking oneself to be moses from the mountai=
n with the tablets(tm)? how are authority and authoritarian power defined h=
ere? the statement about "gathering authority without authoritarian power" =
looks like a bit of a pun to me? in what way is an artists ethical stance a=
 masculine one or a feminine one? and how does their work have to do with t=
he masculinity or feminity of their stance? Can you help me out by filling =
in some of the background theory that I'm apparently missing here? because =
I'm honestly lost. I had a professor once who was fond of saying "I know wh=
at all the words you just used mean, but when you put them together in that=
 way,=20
I don't know what you're saying." I feel like I'm very much in the same boa=
t. I don't think Gabe wants to talk to me, because he didn't answer my ques=
tions in this thread earier, so maybe I'll have better luck with you.

Thanks,
Jason

I think this is one of Joe's later (last?) poems. I heard passages from this
later in a memorial reading for him at The Poetry Project which his family
(wife and children) attended. None of these poems were included in the
published collection oh his word. I wondered why. They were to me remarkable
pieces.There is I think an attempt to project basically as a New York poet
(an "experimentor" with words), and these later poems do not quite fit the
mold. This might be one reason why it has been so difficult to get Joe's
work disseminated to a wider circle. One senses that one is missing the
coplete picture.

Intellectual Impostures had epistemology in it? That's strange,
because everything i've read of Alan Sokal's on the topic of his so-
called science wars make it clear to me at least that he doesn't know
what he's talking about.

Calls for socially responsible investing by individuals in stocks and
bonds is based on the flawed premise that buying stock in a company
somehow implies endorsement of that company or support for that
company. It's not. It's just a form of gambling. There are no more
any moral implications for buying shares in Exxon then there are for
deciding to stand on two kings in black jack. the only time the money
a person spends on a stock has anything to do with that company are
when the purchase is of stock during a period when the company itself
is selling shares, and even then that purchase is so far removed from
what happens when an individual puts some money away in his 401k or
503b or IRA or whatever, that there's no ethical component to it
whatsoever. Socially responsible investing is sold to people who
don't understand what stocks are in order to let them feel like they
are doing something good when really they're just being pragmatic and
hedging their bets against the frailty of their declining years.
There's no shame in that, but the fact that the kind of investing
that "socially responsible" investment firms peddle is based almost
entirely on a marketing strategy designed to stroke their clients
vanity ought to make anybody who is paying attention and the least
bit cynical look at them with a great deal of skepticism.

i sent this earlier but for some reason it didn't make it through. have
added to this version, so don't worry about the last version.

murat mentioned the idea that writing isn't solely a transcript of speech,
that its materiality is obviously different from speech, and this opens
writing to all sorts of things that can't happen in speech. and, conversely,
writing can't be sound poetry. writing can only write about some things that
sound poetry can truly be. writing isn't primal like sound poetry can be.
writing isn't music like sound poetry can be. sound poetry is no code of the
page or the screen or even the recording, at times. body not included.
performance space not included. etc.

we can think of recorded sound as a type of writing. the 'page' looks like a
timeline that has multiple channels. And each channel can have multiple
divisions into different cuts. as in the interface to a multi-track
recording piece of software such as
http://www.sonycreativesoftware.com/images/ss/lg/acidpro6-callouts.jpg ,
which is the interface to Acid, a popular multi-track recording/editing
piece of software.

this is the architecture of film also, only the basic unit in film is the
frame + sound, whereas in sound it's the file or, more granularly, the
sample.

you can edit both audio and video in Acid.

audio and film are spatialized, as a writing space, into a two dimensional
timeline with channels. just as typographic writing spatializes language
into lines.

interactive audio replaces the timeline paradigm with that of the flowchart
(e.g. http://bayimg.com/oAFLFAaBC ). flowcharts allow for decisions.

director, flash, max, and other multimedia/programming authoring tools are
hybrid timeline/flowchart media writing spaces.

the director interface is shown in
http://vispo.com/temp/directorInterface.gif . this is a screenshot of
dbCinema in director. the interface metaphors of director are mixed. there's
the "stage", which is the area the viewer views. and the "score", which is
the timeline; it is populated with "sprites" to which are attached
"behaviors". for instance, the "sprite" in channel 142 of the "Score" is the
text on the stage that says "DefaultBrushSet". That "sprite" has various
"behaviors" attached to it, including a script called "BrushSet indicator".
That script is shown in the script window. There's also the "Cast" window.
The "Cast" window stores media elements such as texts, pictures, sounds,
videos, and so on, and also programming scripts or "behaviors". We can think
of the things in the "Cast" window as classes, and the things in the "Score"
or timeline as objects; objects are instantiations of classes.

There's also the "Property Inspector" window. It shows the properties of
whatever "sprite" in the "Score" or on the "Stage" is selected. In the
screenshot, it shows some of the properties of "sprite" 142.

There's also the "Object Inspector". It allows one to view the properties of
code objects, which are instantiations of script classes stored in the
"Cast" window. In the screenshot, it displays some of the values of
gBrushSetManager, which in dbCinema is a "sprite" that stores the brushes
that paint in dbCinema.

The "playback head" in the "Score" is at frame 130. In programmed multimedia
works, unlike films, the "playback head" skips around, rather than simply
proceeding from beginning to end. Also, unlike film, what's in a particular
frame can change from instant to instant; many Director 'movies' are one
frame long but are diverse from instant to instant. Such diverse one-frame
movies are programmerly. Less programmerly Director authors of course use
the "Score" in a more filmicly paradigmatic way.

Anyway, it's useful to see audio production and multimedia production as a
type of writing. Usually it's called, somewhat awkwardly, "authoring", and
multi-track sound recording software packages are usually called sound
editing packages, and stuff like Premiere and Final Cut Pro, video
production software, is usually also referred to as "editing" software. But
people who know what they're doing with this sort of software are doing way
more than editing stuff.

Of course, when we write in Word or other word processors, these are
"editing" packages as well, but we don't simply edit with them; we write
with them.

In the transition from orality to literacy, we see the poem change a lot,
and we see notions of poetry change a lot. That's still in progress. As
Murat points out Silliman points out. In the transition from print literacy
to electric literacy, poetry and writing and what it means to write and be a
writer undergo similarly large extensions. Not that the book and the page
are going to disappear. I don't think they are. But the whole enterprise of
writing is significantly enlarged.

Let me also point out that writers are well-suited to swim in electric
media, particularly digital media. Because computers are language machines,
written language machines.

JP,

Part of the issue appears to be you think I wrote something I didn't
write. Your paraphrase of me is incorrect. (As is, incidentally, the
quotation Mark Weiss attributes to me).

You say I "wrote that novelty is a purely masculine gesture."

I did not write that.

Here are a few things I said that I think you might be referring to.

- "My post is in part precisely about the so-called masculine dynamics
around the fetish of the /new/, a set of dynamics which work to
'disappear' women from a variety of literary scenes."

- "Given the relatively few number of women there are *to* mention in a
vast field of men, even (and some might argue) especially in the AG
fields, I think it might not be very untoward to suggest that the 'new'
is an instrument that functions in part to police the feminine."

- "I would only repeat again that within the AG fields (fields that
especially fetishize the new) there seems to be a *worse* track record
regarding women."

- "And if one tries to yoke the fetish of the /new/ as something
operating with peculiarly strong masculine dynamics, well, watch out."

None of those quotes displays a risky or even shocking reading of
homosociality in the literary field. If you think so, okay. I'm not
going to debate these points. It's like debating if the sky is composed
of air and jets.

I'm not sure where you're going with your quotations from /Pink Guitar/.
If I were to point to a section of the book that clearly shows the
concerns DuPlessis has about the structural issues of gender in the
literary field across the decades, I'd suggest the section entitled,
"Feminist Poetics, Modernism, and the Avant Garde." (Maybe I'll post
some to my blog, for good measure).

If you wanted a very strong exhaustive study of homosociality in the AG,
Michael Davidson's /Guys Like Us: Citing Masculinity in Cold War
Poetics/ (focusing mostly on '50s and '60s).

Thanks for your polite posts. They're the only kind I reply to.

<<Gabriel,
I'd ask you for a little more patience with me. Please don't assume
that because I'm questioning your formulation that I'm willing to
elide "the truth" of your claims. I asked for clarification of your
claims through discussion of representative figures. I intend no
hostility, as you note. I'm not willing to concede you're right
either, as I see this issue a bit differently. I think.

Since discussing particular artists' work--I didn't ask to discuss
bios--won't work for you, I'll take you up at The Pink Guitar. It's
just this sort of work that I'm coming from.

One think that I see going on in this book is that DuPlessis is
teasing out the problem of the new and hegemony. She seems to praise
The Golden Notebook for its attempts to enact an "anti-authoritarian
ethics" at the "level of structure" and says that we call such
efforts "new." And she adds that "new" has "signaled antithesis to
dominant values."

I asked you about Howe in particulate because she's an interesting
case when you're dealing with novelty and gendered power. As
DuPlessis notes, Howe "works in issues of transcendence" and
"impossible political privilege." I really like DuPlessis's
suggestion that the question of how to write is a question of how to
"gather authority without authoritarian power." Howe often brings the
old into a new light and new structure; she refuses, as DuPlessis
puts it, to be belated.

I'm concerned that we proceed very carefully on this, me and the
mouse in my pocket, I suppose, because I don't want to dis-able any
woman or feminized, marginal person trying to find a way to work, to
"gather authority without authoritarian power."

DuPlessis later says in the chapter/essay on Howe: "The female use of
this 'feminine' of marginality and the avant garde use of this
'feminine' of marginality are mutually reinforcing in the work of
some contemporary women: Lyn Hejinian, Kathleen Fraser, Beverly
Dahlen and Howe. This mixed allegiance will naturally call into
question varieties of flat-footed feminism."

So that's very much where I'm coming from when I asked you about
cases when you wrote that novelty is a purely masculine gesture, that
claiming to possess some truth is a purely masculine attempt to
market oneself as Moses from the Mountain with the Tablets(tm). It
seems more complicated than that to me. And theories often grow more
fuzzy at the edges when you apply them to cases.

Respectfully, JP.

Jason,

I disagree about yr point on stocks.  Yes, it is gambling.  But it isn't
like a straight game of poker between pals, it is more like playing a game
of poker with your (or my) friend Susie who we all know, upon winning, will
use the money for meth/alcohol/twinkies, or some such horribly destructive
purchase.  Because I care about Susie, I may refuse to engage in any
activity in which the end result is harmful to my friend.  In much the same
way, my man-wife and I do try to keep our (hilariously small) amount of
stocks money invested in things we feel okay making money from.  Because we
all know we're giving UniSolar or whomever money to further their company, I
figure (for my part) that I'll want to not feel guilty about what making
money from a stock (gambling) means, or how it was made.

On the other hand, I don't care about Chomsky's personal finances, etc.
Why, if the prevailing opinion in the poetry world, is that we can read Ezra
pound because his work is separate from his life and beliefs, does it even
matter?  You know, when you get right down to it, everyone is a tool of "the
man", everyone is a creep.  Some people are okay with that, some people
fight it, some people try very hard to disengage from that.  More power to
all of them.  I can't understand for the life of me why people are
karate-chopping Chomsky over his money when he works hard to make life
better for other people.  I can think of many other people to hack at: Ralph
Nader, Angelina Jolie (seriously, who talks to refugees in Iraq or the
African continent wearing 800 dollar pants?)

We can be mad at everyone.  I obviously have decided who I will be angry
with.  But I don't know how productive it is.  (That said, I have spent the
past 5-7 years hating Tom Brady, so take all of this with a grain of salt.)

itself would hesitate to demand it of him. But the rich man - not to make

Dear Friends on the NPF,

Though we at the National Poetry Foundation have had to weather a
hard season of loss in these past few months, we are nevertheless
pressing ahead with plans for our summer conference on The Poetry of
the 1970s.

We are very pleased to announce that Rae Armantrout, Nicole Brossard,
Clark Coolidge, Jayne Cortez, and Bernadette Mayer have agreed to
give plenary poetry readings. And we expect to have more good news on
that front in the coming days.

The Conference will take place June 11-15, 2008, here at the
University of Maine. It will be similar in shape and scope to
previous "decade" conferences, but will also feature some
innovations. For instance, we'll be collaborating for the first time
with both the UMaine Museum of Art and the Colby College Museum of
Art to bring the visual arts into the mix. And we'll have a
videographer on hand not just to document the plenary proceedings,
but also to do studio sessions intended for future webcasting with
the many poets (and poet-scholars) who will be in attendance. We'll
be making a more concerted use of new media and web resources than in
the past. And we expect that a variety of NPF print publications will
grow out of the Conference as well. Naturally, a celebration of the
lives and accomplishments of Sylvester Pollet and Burton Hatlen is
being planned in conjunction with our traditional lobster banquet.

We invite paper and panel proposals on all aspects of poetic practice
in the Seventies. We also seek scholars and writers who would be
willing to serve as panel Chairs. Special registration rates are
available for graduate students, independent, and international
scholars.

Proposal guidelines can be found here:
	
http://www.nationalpoetryfoundation.org/news/index.php/article/
2007/10/15/poetry_of_the_1970s

We will begin considering proposals on February 15th. The deadline
for proposals is March 31, 2008. Proposals, along with any queries
about the proposal process, should be sent electronically to

	Steven dot Evans at Maine dot Edu (or by reply to this message)

More information about the Conference is available at our recently
revamped website:

	http://www.nationalpoetryfoundation.org/

The site is set up to facilitate on-line registration for the
Conference. As an incentive for early registration, we will be
offering discounts on NPF journal subscriptions and books.

On-campus accommodations are available at a reasonable rate through
the NPF. We'd also be happy to advise conference participants as to
other nearby lodging options and to offer tips on traveling to and
from the Bangor area.

We appreciate your help in spreading the word about this Conference
and hope you'll seriously consider joining us this summer in Orono!

On behalf of the Conference Steering Committee consisting of Carla
Billitteri, Benjamin Friedlander, Jennifer Moxley, and myself, all
best wishes,

Peter,

Thanks for your reply to my 'drip drip drip' rant, you've restored my faith
in the art of dialogue!  Granted it is a long stretch from the death of
theory to a resurgence of beauty in cyberspace and you are obviously
referring to my passage :-

'If beauty has been consigned by theory to the role of romantic anachronism,
then the sublime spaces of cyberspace have out-manouevred theory and
re-established a need and a desire for beauty, beauty has evolved, has been
transmuted and poetry must discover it's new codes. Forget theory as it
vainly fights extinction,focus in on a newly re-invented beauty.'

I admit that this statement might need some clarification and maybe a little
justification.  Beauty was never, of course, ousted by the theorists, just
intimidated, firstly it became more elusive, more mercurial, going
undercover, and I am talking in terms of contemporary art practice here, but
of course I am quite sure that poetry also toed this line to a certain
extent. At this time, the traditional ideals and parameters for beauty were
starved and became atrophied, but the phenomenon of beauty then began to
re-appear in different guises, one guise, for instance was where abjection
as a subject became fashionable in the art world and a darker, transmuted
form of beauty began to make its appearance, so a transformed mode of
beauty, stepped into the shoes left behind by the corpse of romantic beauty.
To take some early examples of poetry that might work in this context, the
dark melancholic work of Paul Celan or even earlier, Georg Trakl, are imbued
with a brooding beauty that would have passed the Romantics by without a yea
or nay. So, beauty, as a concept and as a part of the human psyche, is
enduring, if prostitution is the oldest profession, then beauty has to be
the oldest concept - hopefully older than warfare - (consider the wonder and
awe of Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden), so it is simply not going to go
away.  If it eluded the theorists and critics before, think how much more
easily it can have its way in cyberspace, where theory, released from the
fortresses of academia, has lost its way..  Now this is where I find it
difficult to underpin my proposition, as I am a bit of a pedestrian in
cyberspace and haven't ventured too far into its whelming spaces, but I plan
to do further research into this and maybe get back to UB Poetics at a
future date, with a few specifics.

Many thanks again for your response - much appreciated - watch this space!

Every other chapter was on the epistimology of
science.  Have to say I found this more intelligible
than the discussion of postmodernism, even filtered
through S&B.  [For whatever reasons, I simply can't
get my head around especially Derrida, no matter how
often I tried before I finally gave up.]

By "science wars" do you mean the attack on
postmodernism, or their take on (is it?) hard and soft
scientific proofs?  (I think I've got the terminology
here wrong, and it's both been a time since I read
IntImps, and I don't have my copy to hand.)

Certainly Sokal and Bricmont have a strong take on
postmodernism -- that with the exception of Foucault,
it's crap -- which many people disagree with <g>, and
there *are aspects of a hatchet job to it.  But ...  I
do think the reviews mostly misrepresented by
omission.  And the initial _Social Text_ affair is
quite a different kettle of kittens from _Intellectual
Impostures_.

Jason,
Hmm. OK, some tough questions. I got a lot of splainin to do.

Moses. I think of episodes when people really got it wrong in their =20
attempts to be a law giver. Like Eliot mid-30s lecturing at Virginia =20
about what a good idea it would be to round up those pesky Jews. Or, =20
less obvious the way Pound's know-it-all attitude could be ludicrous =20
and could blind him. Or the way my own know-it-all episodes have =20
blinded me. I don't really think of this ethically as much as I think =20=

of it functionally.

Authority and authoritarian power. It's more of a paradox isn't it? A =20=

tricky situation. How to tell people what's right without telling =20
them what to do. That's so simple it has to be wrong.

The masculine/feminine thing going on here is a real problem. We're =20
using masculine and feminine as tropes for activity/aggression and =20
passivity. Those tropes have a tendency to reinforce what we would =20
critique. Male gets associated with stuff like theorizing, female =20
associated with emotion.

Am I being too simple? I can't really fill you in on all the theory, =20
because there's a ton of it. De Beauvoir seems really relevant here, =20
her The Second Sex.

Gabriel was right about The Pink Guitar being a good place to look at =20=

this stuff. The early (first?) chapter taking on DuChamp might help a =20=

lot. But be ready for more tricky language.

I'm nervous here because I'm starting to feel like the Village =20
Splainer. And I have to go teach a class. So, if you want follow-up, =20
do. Maybe someone else can put an oar in here too? JP

Jim,

I will try to respond to a few questions you raise.

a) "murat mentioned the idea that writing isn't solely a transcript of
speech,
that its materiality is obviously different from speech, and this opens
writing to all sorts of things that can't happen in speech. and, conversely,
writing can't be sound poetry. writing can only write about some things that
sound poetry can truly be. writing isn't primal like sound poetry can be.
writing isn't music like sound poetry can be. sound poetry is no code of the
page or the screen or even the recording, at times. body not included.
performance space not included. etc."

Though I definitely say that writing is not "solely a transfer of speech," I
do not necessarily give a primacy to "sound" as opposed to "writing." In
writing, the eye is also involved, and the relationship between what one can
"see" and what one can perform is problematic. One is forced to ask the
question, how does the visual assume or extend into a auditory dimension.

Writing, the visual, also can be music if one incorporates silence into the
idea of music, making it part of it. This way music also stretches into a
music of the mind (which may also have elements of physical sound); this is
part of what "eda" is, a movement, a music of the mind. *The Structure of
Escape*, the poem I am working on now, is very much involved in the dynamic
relationship between sight and hearing. Here is one piece from *The
Structure*, the piece which gives the title to the whole poem:

    The Structure of Escape

The frame of a Bresson movie is a jail
the escape is going outside that jail
it all starts with the noises one hears,
becoming one, knowing what the noises are.
that's freedom.

There is an act and the demonstration of an act.
the demonstration occurs in speech.

the future always, recurrent outside the frame
which becoming one knowing what the noises are
is escape.


Jim, as you can see, issue of time, the nature of it, and the nature of
frame, questions you also discuss in your post, are integral parts of The
Structure also; but in a different way.

"Body *is* included in writing; but in a new way.

b) "we can think of recorded sound as a type of writing. the 'page' looks
like a
timeline that has multiple channels. And each channel can have multiple
divisions into different cuts. as in the interface to a multi-track
recording piece of software"

In my previous post, addressed to Jason, I was thinking of a "recording of
writing," part of writing that the human voice can not enunciate or
"perform"; but only think about. In that way, one might think of electronic
or digital writing (are they the same thing? I am thinking they are, and you
may be that they are not) as an extension of the human voice/thought into
sound.

In the early Nineties, I wrote a poem called *Io's Song*. In a number of
pieces in it, the page gets divided into paralel vertical strips of
poems/texts extend simultaneously. The reader/the mind is constantly forced
to make choices where to go (one *can* not solve the problem by simply
having different performers). The *choice* becomes a meditative act (a la
Loyola's last stage of meditation), simultaneously making the reader, who
must choose, part of the performance, or the "wrier/author" of that specific
version of the reading.

Believe me, this creates infinite problems, to me, both in a very paralyzing
(in the sense of slowing towards a stasis) and fruitful way. The page splits
into multiple directions, basically around a horizontal/vertical (x/y)
axis), pulling within itself both how the eye traditionally moves in
traditional reading, from left to right or right to left or up to down, and
how the mind explodes contronting this text. Am I making sense?

I think what I am saying is that what you see as digital poetry does by
"multi-tracking" can also be done, at least done by me, on the page.

c) "his is the architecture of film also, only the basic unit in film is the
frame + sound, whereas in sound it's the file or, more granularly, the
sample.

you can edit both audio and video in Acid."

Yes, film, its vocabulary, its way of organizing experience, is very
important. As you can see from the piece I quoted above, *The Structure* is
permeated with the language of film, its unique aesthetics, besides the
works of many, many film makers.

Underlying *The Structure*, there is the idea of "film lumiere," an idea I
first developed in my essay "Eleven Septembers Later: Readings of Benjamin
Hollander's *Vigilance*." In "film lumiere" what one see and what one hears
work independently or contrapuntally (as opposed to harmonically) from each
other. The essay shows how Orson Welles' does this in *A Touch of Evil* and
Hollander in *Vigilance*, both examples of film lumiere. One needs to read
the essay to find out about other aspects of it.

"Acid": I am afraid I am a total ignoramus on that matter. I don't know what
"acid" software is, only know the sixties, Lucy in the Sky, LSD kind.

In film lumiere, and in *The Structure*, the frame is a very fluid thing, is
not a mere, static given.
I discuss this also in *The Peripheral space of Photography* and Deleuse in
his two pivotal books on film, *Action Space* and Time Space*.*

d) "audio and film are spatialized, as a writing space, into a two
dimensional
timeline with channels. just as typographic writing spatializes language
into lines.

interactive audio replaces the timeline paradigm with that of the flowchart
(e.g. http://bayimg.com/oAFLFAaBC ). flowcharts allow for decisions.

director, flash, max, and other multimedia/programming authoring tools are
hybrid timeline/flowchart media writing spaces."

As I already discussed, in *Io's Song*, etal., this does not have to be so.
There are places in *Io's Song* that read like flow charts.

e) "director, flash, max, and other multimedia/programming authoring tools
are
hybrid timeline/flowchart media writing spaces...."

If one can see that all this did not only start with computers (this love of
technology! which ploriferates its software and its language), but was
anticipated on paper, written texts. A sense of continuity, rather than to
me a too eager embrace of new technology as if history did not exist (see
what happened with Ramsfeld and Iraq), would be salutary! I say this with
full of respect and virtual affection (since we never physically met) with
you Jim.

f) "Let me also point out that writers are well-suited to swim in electric
media, particularly digital media. Because computers are language machines,
written language machines."

Or perhaps language machines have/develop/or are infected by a soul!

Ciao,

Murat

It's more fun to attack them. Class warfare is my weakness. Even the sendimental variety. J Edward's, for instance. & his "son of a mill worker" routine got old quickly.

Heidi,

Forgive my delayed reply. I waited to reply to consider your post some
more -- but upon doing so I can't quite figure out what precisely you're
saying to me here. If you'd care to say clarify what you're saying, I'm
all ears. Sorry that I can't quite catch your gist here.

Best,

<<gabe,

i had been wondering what role the poet plays and why one would ask such a
question in the first place.  what is the role of the poet.  what kind of
question is that.  what is the role of the contemplative.  havent read an
explanation that is reasonable on that one.  but if being reasonable doesnt
matter too much, then youre off and running.  one interesting thing for me
is that your discussion is couched in terms of critical praxis, which i am
entirely rusty at, but i guess the problem for me with such a praxis is it
dissects things from the outside.  sometimes this is very interesting but i
dont and probably never have seen what it has to do with poetry.  so.  i
mean, when asked why a poem is a sonnet rather than free verse, the poet is
allowed to say, - because i like it that way. - because it suits, because it
is true, yes, but also because that is what the poet liked, that is there is
a notion of loyalty implicit in the truth value, as also i think in values
of freedom.  in the same way, if you end up getting to be the cowboy way out
ahead of the herd, and my grandfather was a cowboy in his youth and so this
is not pretention on my part, but if you get to do that work, it is ok to
say this is my work just because i like it that way, because this is the
world i see, this is what is true.  it is also ok to try and find out what
that means rather than trying to spin gold from imaginary assumptions
without the slightest bit of evidence in real terms.  this world from the
outbound is worth trying to talk to.  and the ringing ironies in such a
position are painful indeed, how badly one measures against the smoke once a
candle is gone.

one thing about fabricating histories from smoke that have no concrete
grounding in actual fact, is that i think you have to translate them into
some kind of abstract critique.  because in embodied, everyday terms, they
WILL NOT hold water.  how fun to destroy a beautiful truth and make it
something ugly as though it never existed in the first place.  in
cyberspace, you can do anything, if you dont care if your world becomes a
fake cartoon.  some peoples lives are so microengineered it is truly
heartbreaking.  well a bug in amber cant do anything about it but, think,
one of the things about the lists scapegoat submissions, which were delayed
when fred was so very ill, was the kind of spectacle and gratification
generated by the pariah.  i wonder if anyone can write a poem about a
society without pariahs, wirthout your favorite persecutee, after all, dont
the persecuted secretly enjoy it?  isnt there some secret masochism god
given to every returning sadist who cant admit a mistake.  i wonder if there
are any poems about avenging a fathers death out there, or about nice,
intimate; but not too time-consuming conversations with shotguns.  - he
needed killin - used to work just fine in court in the west.

without my library i cant add speculations about H.D. or others right now, i
would have to look up the details, some of you do just fine without your
library.  sorry.  just offhand i would say that pounds line including -- we
grub the soft fern shoots -- has such depth and sensitivity to his subject.
it grieves me to find that lacking so often in discussions.  it does, it
always will.  as if, again, the object position is one which enjoys
persecution and silencing.  no so, colleagues, not at all, of course.  but
the obvious and the unremarked are not the same thing in this case.

what is the world -- who is in the world -- how can we heal the world --
these are important questions, like asking who is God and how can we know.
those questions take years and years to even begin.  and henri nouwen is
indeed the rilke in the background somewhere in those words. ...  who a
fellow poet is, strikes me as not terribly interesting, especially when it
is so much more interesting just to sit and take a look around.   who each
poet is, it just strikes me as not that interesting.  speck of dust kind of
thing.  there are just a lot more important problems.

thinking about eternal things goes well on caol ila whiskey or orval
trappist ale in this cold, if you ask me.  the cold here is just fine by me.

be well.

my 2 cents

HI Pertra,
lovely to meet u and Neil in one of the more unlikely of places

IF it's possible for me to attend Touching Time i would dearly LOVE to do
so. Let me know and if you need more from me.
I can probably get some money to cover my coming and if not i'll cover it
myself.

It'd be great to be a part of such a "time"


Looking forwards to talking more sharing more moving more together.

love and love

I'm going to cop out of this and say I agree with both.

Gambling money always ends up in the wrong hands. In fact, I might go
as far as saying that all money concentrates in the wrong hands. I
have yet to figure out why this is, or how I can get my hands on a
Wrong Hands Disguise and then do some good...

But oops, here's the problem: Even if I get my hands on a Wrong Hands
Disguise (WHD) with the purest of intentions, I'm going to have to
fight my way through the sea of Mister Miyagis and Daniel LaRussos
just waiting to crane kick my belief as to what I think I'm doing with
all this "ill-gotten" gain into the next fiscal period....

How do you win with these guys?

That's the lie that the "socially responsible" investing firms tell
that I'm talking about. The money you pay for the stock, unless
you're purchasing stock directly from a company issue, doesn't go to
fund anything that that company does, just like if I buy a used chevy
from my neighbor, General Motors doesn't see a dime of what I pay
him. The only direct financial contact you have with the company is
if they pay dividends, and generally speaking, for most small
holders, that's miniscule, and in any case, its money coming out of
their profit which you an easily funnel into charitable giving (which
is what my mom does when she gets dividends from Exxxon Mobile, for
example). When you buy a stock, all you're doing is making a bet that
that stock will increase in value over the period of time you plan to
hold on to the stock for. True, technically you "own" a portion of
the company in question, but you haven't invested any money in the
company, you've bought out somebody else who already had a stake. I
tend to be very cynical, so when things go bad, I bet that the
companies that are truly evil will somehow benefit leading to an
increase in their stock prices, and while I find a company like
Halliburton reprehensible, I see no moral plus or minus to simply
taking the bet that they're going to make a ton of money over the
course of the next thirty years, and so more than likely Their stock
value will have made great gains against inflation and so I'll make a
good profit when i sell those shares. but then, some people also
think it's immoral to play poker. And other people don't have a
problem with that, but seem to think that there's something unethical
about check raising. So to each his own I guess. I just really want
to make the point that money spent on a traded stock is not going
into the coffers of that company, as it's a myth that i think some
seriously shady investment firms peddle to people, and as such it's a
bit of a pet peeve.

On a more interesting note, what is a man-wife? I've never heard the
term before but I like the sound of it. Although I'm pronouncing it
more like manwife.

Thanks, Jason

JP,

Part of the issue appears to be you think I wrote something I didn't=20
write. Your paraphrase of me is incorrect. (As is, incidentally, the=20
quotation Mark Weiss attributes to me).

You say I "wrote that novelty is a purely masculine gesture."

I did not write that.

Here are a few things I said that I think you might be referring to.

- "My post is in part precisely about the so-called masculine dynamics=20
around the fetish of the /new/, a set of dynamics which work to=20
'disappear' women from a variety of literary scenes."

- "Given the relatively few number of women there are *to* mention in a
vast field of men, even (and some might argue) especially in the AG
fields, I think it might not be very untoward to suggest that the 'new'
is an instrument that functions in part to police the feminine."

- "I would only repeat again that within the AG fields (fields that=20
especially fetishize the new) there seems to be a *worse* track record=20
regarding women."

- "And if one tries to yoke the fetish of the /new/ as something=20
operating with peculiarly strong masculine dynamics, well, watch out."

None of those quotes displays a risky or even shocking reading of=20
homosociality in the literary field. If you think so, okay. I'm not=20
going to debate these points. It's like debating if the sky is composed=20
of air and jets.

I'm not sure where you're going with your quotations from /Pink Guitar/.=20
If I were to point to a section of the book that clearly shows the=20
concerns DuPlessis has about the structural issues of gender in the=20
literary field across the decades, I'd suggest the section entitled,=20
"Feminist Poetics, Modernism, and the Avant Garde." (Maybe I'll post=20
some to my blog, for good measure).

If you wanted a very strong exhaustive study of homosociality in the AG,=20
Michael Davidson's /Guys Like Us: Citing Masculinity in Cold War=20
Poetics/ (focusing mostly on '50s and '60s).

Thanks for your polite posts. They're the only kind I reply to.

<<Gabriel,
I'd ask you for a little more patience with me. Please don't assume
that because I'm questioning your formulation that I'm willing to
elide "the truth" of your claims. I asked for clarification of your
claims through discussion of representative figures. I intend no
hostility, as you note. I'm not willing to concede you're right
either, as I see this issue a bit differently. I think.

Since discussing particular artists' work--I didn't ask to discuss
bios--won't work for you, I'll take you up at The Pink Guitar. It's
just this sort of work that I'm coming from.

One think that I see going on in this book is that DuPlessis is
teasing out the problem of the new and hegemony. She seems to praise
The Golden Notebook for its attempts to enact an "anti-authoritarian
ethics" at the "level of structure" and says that we call such
efforts "new." And she adds that "new" has "signaled antithesis to
dominant values."

I asked you about Howe in particulate because she's an interesting
case when you're dealing with novelty and gendered power. As
DuPlessis notes, Howe "works in issues of transcendence" and
"impossible political privilege." I really like DuPlessis's
suggestion that the question of how to write is a question of how to
"gather authority without authoritarian power." Howe often brings the
old into a new light and new structure; she refuses, as DuPlessis
puts it, to be belated.

I'm concerned that we proceed very carefully on this, me and the
mouse in my pocket, I suppose, because I don't want to dis-able any
woman or feminized, marginal person trying to find a way to work, to
"gather authority without authoritarian power."

DuPlessis later says in the chapter/essay on Howe: "The female use of
this 'feminine' of marginality and the avant garde use of this
'feminine' of marginality are mutually reinforcing in the work of
some contemporary women: Lyn Hejinian, Kathleen Fraser, Beverly
Dahlen and Howe. This mixed allegiance will naturally call into
question varieties of flat-footed feminism."

So that's very much where I'm coming from when I asked you about
cases when you wrote that novelty is a purely masculine gesture, that
claiming to possess some truth is a purely masculine attempt to
market oneself as Moses from the Mountain with the Tablets(tm). It
seems more complicated than that to me. And theories often grow more
fuzzy at the edges when you apply them to cases.

Respectfully, JP.

My only familiarity with Sokal is having read about the Social Text
incident, in which he comes off as being committed to a naive science
textbook Karl Popper sort of idea of the scientific method, along
with an unanalyzed commitment to scientific materialism
metaphysically. Since i have very little patience for people with
such a position, i haven't read the book.

I really was just making a joke, though, epistemology being the
theory of knowledge as explained by someone who doesn't know what
he's talking about. i'm often too obtuse for my own good.

  I soured on Chomsky when he saw fit to defend the holocaust denier, Robert Faurisson. For an especially damning account, read chapter 5 of "Chutzpah" by Alan Dershowitz. I'm with Chomsky on the Palestinian issue. But the guy lost his mind during the Faurisson episode.
  The Dershowitz book, by the way, is my source since I'm recalling the episode from memory.

I've been thinking about this post for a few days now, Murat, and the
concept of a digital poetry is something that I think is interesting
to pursue in relation to sound. I tend to think of Jim and Brian Kim
Stefans whenever I hear the phrase "digital poetry" and although I
think there's a general trend toward it meaning particularly the kind
of programming based on-screen poetry that they're so good at, to
talk about sound as a field for digital poetry raises some intriguing
questions. In relation to the move from the paper book to the website
as a means of digital poetry, I think you're right in questioning
whether that move has actually been made. I personally make no
distinction between print and online publications as far as their
worth goes, but I think for a lot of people, the electronic
distribution of writing is somehow less than its "brick and mortar"
forebear. I really like a lot of the work that people like Jim are
doing in expanding what is possible with "on screen" poetry, but I
think that there's a sense in which this sort of work is truly avant
garde in the sense of pushing past what's current and looking into
possible futures. Whereas, as I tend to think at least, Silliman's
New Sentence was based on a historic shift.

It's funny you bring this up, actually, as a lot of my own ideas
about poetics got formed in a sort of crucible where my
misunderstanding of the aims and workings of language poetry,
including the New Sentence, played an important role. I even at one
point developed my own off-shoot of the new sentence, the open
sentence, which is a technique by which prosody is reinserted into
the basically print nature of the sentence in order to heighten what
I called in the essary I wrote describing it "the clarifying nature
of vagueness." That is, you take something that is vague, such as a
heteronym like "read" and you insert it in a situation where it's
relation to other words in terms of prosody creates different
possible meanings, and in those possibilities attempts to indicate
something unsayable. I tend to use it as a technique a lot in my own
writing, but where at one point I looked at it as something along the
lines of a false simile which could be adapted and used by other
poets, I think it's unfortunately too complex a device to make it
have the impact I thought it did, and as a result becomes mostly a
prosodic form of torque rather than actually being in someway
indexical the way I thought it was. But that's a bit of a tangent.

What I was going to say is that I don't think it's necessarily the
case that the kind of digital poetry I'm after as a transitional and
unrecognized movement from encoded typography on a page to a digital
encoding is really ahistorical in the sense that you're getting at.
True, the internet and poetry on the computer screen is still in its
infancy and it remains to be seen exactly where that will go into the
future. Hopefully Jim and likeminded poets will have their way and
everything will be as interesting as the digital future their work
promises. But I think in a very real way, and in a sense missed by
everybody who took Grenier's "I hate speech" as a call to arms, the
transition from performance to print is a shift that I think by the
time This and L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E were being published had already begun
to be superseded. Which is to say, and I often fantasize that this
thought is original, I believe that pop music is a kind of proto
audio poetry in the sense that I'm thinking about, and as a result
most people don't get their poetry off the page, and the real
proletarian medium is not therefore print but recorded sound. The
problem with pop music of course is that it is so very beholden to
music, and fairly unadventurous music at that, for most of it's
impact that the impact of the words is often a secondary
consideration. Most pop lyrics are insipid and don't hold up as texts
in their own right. And that's fine because pop lyrics are just a
part of the pop song and when considering the quality of a pop song
all the musical aspects can transform the insipid into something
sublime and wonderful. I can think of thousands of examples ranging
from Phil Spectors/The Ronettes "Be My Baby" or Gene Vincent's
"Bebopalula" to Outkast's "Hey Ya" or Kelis/The Neptunes "Milkshake
Song."

The digital poetry I'm after, then, I think at least, is one that
recognizes the role that recorded sound plays in the lives of most
people where poetry is concerned. I think there are prototypes for
the kind of thing I'm thinking of, Radiohead's "Fitter Happier" and
Steve Reich's "It's gonna rain" both strike me as gestures in the
same direction. Still, there's something about those pieces and the
other ones like them that keep them as music. Maybe it's the lack of
emphasis on the words, and I think you're right there in saying that
what poetry is put together from is words. Or maybe to put it another
way, Poetry happens in the transmission of words. Lots of people have
explored the implications of the transmission of words by speech and
by print, and there is always room and more unfamiliar space to be
explored there. Maybe more so in the sort of audiotext I'm trying to
imagine. I think your idea of a pendant to the debussy prelude with
the mallarme poem through treating the letters as a chromatic scale,
or maybe more  as a tone row, is very much the sort of thing I'm
talking about and I would enjoy collaborating on such a project. Part
of what makes all this interesting to me is the space in which the
poem takes place. For printed work, the space is between the printed
poem and the reader viewing it. For performance it's between two
people. Nowadays, for a recording, it's likely to have the illusion
of taking place inside the listeners head, particularly if someone is
listening to it on a set of headphones on their ipod. Part of the
appeal of recording is the physical detachment from performance that
disintegrates the visual object as part of the poem. If you watch a
performance you see the speaker, if you read a poem you se the page
or the screen, but that dissolves completely with the absolute non-
visualness of a recording. All that's left is the sound of words and
the illusion of am auditory space different from the actual space the
listener is in. which i quite like the idea of.

Anyway, enough of my rambling for now. Thanks again for the response.

I believe you also, but would really love to know the source of your
detailed information.  By the way, Chomsky lives in Lexington, and I know
his neighborhood-- it's one of the richest suburbs in the state.  I doubt
that he bought that place (or pays the very spendy property taxes) on a mere
MIT salary.  FWIW.

As for estate taxes: there are all kinds of legal loopholes available to
those who are rich in cash (and especially to those who are *very* rich in
cash) to shelter their money so that the estate tax is minimized thus
protecting their income from "redistribution" upon death, e.g., setting up
trusts for your heirs and making yearly contributions, setting up charitable
remainder trusts, etc. These work best for those who have so much money
there is no question that they will never need to touch the principal. Just
keep it in trusts, and voila, you are safe from all those peasants with
pitchforks.

The people who really get shafted are those who are land rich but cash poor,
e.g., farmers whose biggest asset is their land (the valueof even a small
farm easily exceeds the exempted amount), which is not protected at all.
It's not a system that works well.

Critical spirit, sure, but to employ the word "attack" against achievement =
on the basis of a supposed moral or ethical program seems a little dismissi=
ve of the giving quality necessary to dialog.  Are we "really talking", or =
just stuffing each others mouths with a kind of flag loyalty?

Elizabeth Treadwell organized the following responses to expand the
conversation on "Numbers Trouble."

See the site here:  http://delirioushem.blogspot.com/search/label/dim%20sum

 Shanna Compton did an amazing job putting this site together, and you'll
see too that there is an introductory note, as well as links to refer to the
original essay by Spahr and Young, which appeared in the Chicago Review late
last year.

A couple of the essays are forthcoming, so be sure to check back in to DIM
SUM for those.

Man-wife is my term for my partner, who I have been with for 4+ years and
share a lovely daughter with.  We're not married, but boyfriend seems kind
of quaint.

Companies directly benefit when people buy their stock. Its a drop in the bucket, certainly. Yes stocks are sold in the secondary market. Kind of like recycling. Only collective actions have impact.

That's the lie that the "socially responsible" investing firms tell
that I'm talking about. The money you pay for the stock, unless
you're purchasing stock directly from a company issue, doesn't go to
fund anything that that company does, just like if I buy a used chevy
from my neighbor, General Motors doesn't see a dime of what I pay
him. The only direct financial contact you have with the company is
if they pay dividends, and generally speaking, for most small
holders, that's miniscule, and in any case, its money coming out of
their profit which you an easily funnel into charitable giving (which
is what my mom does when she gets dividends from Exxxon Mobile, for
example). When you buy a stock, all you're doing is making a bet that
that stock will increase in value over the period of time you plan to
hold on to the stock for. True, technically you "own" a portion of
the company in question, but you haven't invested any money in the
company, you've bought out somebody else who already had a stake. I
tend to be very cynical, so when things go bad, I bet that the
companies that are truly evil will somehow benefit leading to an
increase in their stock prices, and while I find a company like
Halliburton reprehensible, I see no moral plus or minus to simply
taking the bet that they're going to make a ton of money over the
course of the next thirty years, and so more than likely Their stock
value will have made great gains against inflation and so I'll make a
good profit when i sell those shares. but then, some people also
think it's immoral to play poker. And other people don't have a
problem with that, but seem to think that there's something unethical
about check raising. So to each his own I guess. I just really want
to make the point that money spent on a traded stock is not going
into the coffers of that company, as it's a myth that i think some
seriously shady investment firms peddle to people, and as such it's a
bit of a pet peeve.

On a more interesting note, what is a man-wife? I've never heard the
term before but I like the sound of it. Although I'm pronouncing it
more like manwife.

Thanks, Jason

Subject: Varieties of Masculine Experience and the Varieties of Mescaline
Experience the Transgressor as Trance Gesture
To: david.chirot@gmail.com


Introduction, with the author's name redacted at the direction of the
Investigating Commision


The following are from the rough notes of the bare beginings of my
translations and annotations of El Colonel's translations, marginalia and
annotations from his "Montage-Manuscript" "Varieties of Mescaline Experienc=
e
#3 Plain (or Playin) the Trance Gestures," which is from the original text
by the esteemed US American academician, scholar and poet Gabriel Gudding
entitled "Varieties of Masculine Experience III  "Playing the Transgressor.=
"

The allusion to William James' Varieties of Religious Experience and the
influence of James' thinking on Dr Gudding 's is further emphasised by the
title of Dr Gudding's blog "Earth and Pragmatism," though this latter shoul=
d
not be construed or confused  as an allusion in any way to the numerous
journals, texts, platforms of various ideologies which have included the
words "Earth" or "Soil" in combination with the words and names of various
ideologies from Anarchism to Communism to Democracy to Fascism to Naziism t=
o
Socialism to Zionism.
While Dr Gudding's analysis makes some claims to creating a confluence amon=
g
such thinkers as Simone Weil and Pierre Bourdieu, as well as such terms as
"Earth and Pragmatism" (the "earth Shoe" or "Whole Earth Catalogue"? come t=
o
mind) and "Varieties of  Religious (Masculine)  Experience," with its own
Emersonian allusions to "Experience," the "Religious" and "Varieties of" as
in "Emerson's "Representative Men," his primary focus is presumed to be
"transcendental" rather than "ideological," with however some thing of the
"practical" praxis of Pragmatism inferred to be preferable to the merely an=
d
completely Transcendental.

(Interestingly, also in re Emerson,  Dr Gudding himself in a note on the
buffalo poetics list given in full below  forbids "the trading of
interpretations of the biographies
and works of supposedly representative women" when discussing, as he, like
Emerson,  is, "representative men.")

(That a bit more perhaps, of another well-known US American conception of
"praxis"--Behaviourism-- is needed, seems to be perhaps an undercurrent of
thought within the realm of possibility of being present in Dr Gudding's
admonishments as well as the Puritan Tradition's own ideas of Moral Fiber,
Backbone, High Ground and Suasion ("Spare the rod and spoil the child")
which pave the way in some versions of this ethos  from Good Behaviours to
Good Business, from Good Clean Living to Living the Good Life.
"Cleanliness," after all is "next to Godliness." and so the worship of the
bathroom's porcelain architectures and apparati.  But I digress!! Forgive
the grim intrusion of such un-clean and uncalled for thoughts!

El Colonel proposes to examine a number of the invocations of the
"disinterred shaman" of Dr Gudding, by proposing a study of "Experiences"
connected with the practice and study, the art and poetry, the prose and
documents, of the "Varieties of Mescaline Experience."

In this, as El Colonel remarks drily, his well known smile in full display,
he is not so much inspired by William James' "varieties of religious
Experience" as those of the Jimi Hendrix Experience, of whose "Voodoo Chile=
"
and "A Merman I shall Turn to Be" he is especially fond.

The work of actual shamans, poets, CIA investigators, Roman Empresses and
the experiments and their attendant writings and drawings of Henri Michaux
are among the persons and practices who and which have contributed greatly
to El Colonel's studies. It should also be noted that he does not see
himself in any way as being a "writer" of the avant or any other garde nor,
indeed as a member of any of those groups who produce Dr Gudding's despised
category of "literature."

For it must be noted that,along with his great fondness for alliteration, E=
l
Colonel has an addiction for placing thoughts, those improvised
compositions, in quotation marks.  This brings "a deft touch of   intriguin=
g
and entertaining irony to the most prosaic of ideas, events, and persons "
Habituated to an imaginative isolation, El Colonel's intellectual companion=
s
are his "compositions" with their attendant "commentaries," "asides,"
"digressions," and "annotations."  By means of this "ironic distancing" he
continually invents "a hitherto unknown and as yet unpublished form of
writing, never before seen nor heard.

 This writing is a method of creating for himself a reader who is turn
accompanied by his own doubling as a writer.


In referring to the Jimi Henrix Experience, El Colonel  is not trying to
demonstrate any of  Dr Gudding's detested "hipness" nor a reek of the wreck
of an outdated  "hippiness," but simply injecting a note "at once of music
and of humor, into a discussion whose organism is perhaps thirsty for the
healing waters of these two well known physicians."

El Colonel has noted (below) the "passive-aggressive" nature of the
"re-colonization" of what Dr. Gudding himself notes is an already colonized
area, known as it were to all, in that the aggressive tones of Dr Gudding's
assertions are made at the same time with ever in mind the words in his
blog's subtitle,

"disciplined renunciation of hipness in general tryingtobenice-ness "

As Dr Gudding modestly notes:

"The
thesis that "the new" is foremost a means of policing the feminine is not,
to
use your phrasing, "my schema." It is one of the most widely felt but
undertheorized phenomena in the field of production. "

Yet is not the "disciplined renunciation of hipness" and the perhaps more
free flowing "in general tryingtobeniceness" striven for itself indicative
of a troubled, contested and conflicted "site of struggle" in which the
pulls of passive-aggressive attractions divide the writer against himself
and so cry out for an increase of policing of policing? Perhaps it is he
himself who in longing to be a Judge, that is, one is impartially freed fro=
m
these inner conflicts, and not only longing to be a Judge but in behaving
like one, has at the same transgressed his "tryingtobeniceness" and wandere=
d
dangerously near again to the dread dens and denizens of "hipness" and
"Masculinity."

For, does he not present himself in danger from masculine practices of
cruelty in policing the policers, as a fearless (male) Judge
(transgressively) risking retribution:
"
And if one tries to yoke the fetish of the /new/ as something
operating with peculiarly strong masculine dynamics, well, watch out."

And so claim for himself at once the masculine roles he himself as Judge
decries in others:  the Hero and the Victim?

Is it not a  "masculine experience" that is being re- presented and
enacted:  the conflict between being one who wants to belong to "general
tryingtobeniceness" and at the same time fears he will lose that "hipness"
which distinguishes him from being a Boy Scout or, "more dread than the
Dread of Babylon" --being a square!!  Or, far worse, that ultimate horror o=
f
horror haunting many a masculine mind----being ascertained to have become
one of the members of the Most Feared Terrorist Organizations in the
World--the School of Quietude!!!!!

(Something akin to Keith Olberman's "Worst Persons in the World,' only
WORSE.)

"It (the abject terror of being detained for rendition as a Quietudist) is
one of the most widely felt but
undertheorized phenomena in the field of production."

For is it not the introduction of women and their works which is being
banished from Dr Gudding's own attacks on the banishments of women and thei=
r
works, something which reveals all the more the deeply the  insecurities at
the heart of the "poetry wars," and the "passive-aggressive"  "(Mother)
Earth and (Father) pragmatism" of male writers who long not to and fear the
"renunciation" of  their hipness, their "radicalism," their "cutting edge"
and "powerful analyses," their "Culture Warrior" selves entirely in their
own ethical desires to conform to a misguided conception of "general
tryingtobeniceness" as an imposed and policing regime which they want to
both rebel against and embrace?
And so, continually policing themselves, may they not take advantage of
their practice of it in that "disciplined renunciation," which constitutes
their own "authority on the subject," and in turn project this and its
insecurities out into the world, and become, indeed, the all seeing Eyes of
Justice, who is after all depicted as a Blind Woman?  And who might just be=
,
and of course IS, in dire need of some one to observe, define,
categorize,control catch and discipline and punish ("Spare the Rod and spoi=
l
the child") the policers and all those "outlaws, criminals, heretics,
disinterred shamen"  and "hear their cases" and  Judge them with all seeing
eyes for Her?

That is, to be the One who prepares the criminals, outlaws, heretics for he=
r
final weighing of them in the Scales of Justice?

(Amnd perhaps allowed to be, not only a Judge, but the Lord High Executione=
r
himself?)

In short, a kind of Attorney General for the combined figures of the Muse
and Justice?  A devoted and disciplined director of civil service and
Homeland Security and "general tryingtobeniceness"  for Our Lady of the
Statute of Liberty?

A General Wytchfinder to go with his "general tryingtoniceness and so,
verily, not at all, after all, a loss of mere "badboyness" but the
attainment of a being the figure of whom is Far Greater than Any Mere
Manliness in the ultimate role of El Angel Gabriel.


And so in to the fray charges this White Winged Knight, this Caped Crusader=
,
--to cleanse the world of all his dirty brethren and protect the Statue, th=
e
Throne, the Mighty Halls of Justice and the Muse from the dread "outlaws,
criminals disinterred shamen, and all the Armies of the Schools of Quietude=
,
and all the other evil, rival Schools and militia "Movements,"
"insurgencies" "cults," 'romantic heroes" and yea verily, all those who do
not follow his example and that of his fellow Angels.

"It in fact arguably
defines not only the field of AG production as a whole but letters in toto.
To
even appear to argue the point by trading interpretations of the biographie=
s
and works of supposedly representative women, especially in this apparently
hostile venue, is to ignore, if not elide, the truth of this structure"
 "And if one tries to yoke the fetish of the /new/ as something

operating with peculiarly strong masculine dynamics, well, watch out."
For after all, "especially in this apparently
hostile venue,"  where, as Raymond Chandler wrote of his Knight Philip
Marlowe, "down these mean streets a man must go"--and so is it not all the
more necessary that the "truth" must be protected, and that in this
environment, indeed in "letters in toto," it seems necessary that "a man
must go," one who is both practised in the "discipline of renunciation" and
in the "generaltyringtobeniceness?"

As El Colonel notes, are we then not in the presences of  Guardian Angels,
and among them, shining whitely in the darkness of these mean streets,  El
Angel Gabriel?

As El Colonel puts it, in one of his several marginalia, jotted during the
preparation of a sort of projected  "capsule summary," which I will here us=
e
a quotation in commencing the presentation of what are only my own rough
notes at this moment of the beginings of my own rough translations of their
own rough notes of El Colonel's "Translations":

Regarding the trasmission hereafter to be designated as : "Gabriel Gudding,
to Poetics, re his 'The Varieties of Masculine Experience III:  Playing the
Transgressor'"

"An ethico-aesthetico assertion of cases for categories from which,
transgressively anti-transgressiveness and via the distancing of Moral
Suasion, the author wishes to distinguish himself, for having observed and
noted, defined and organized into headings and sub-headings, is he not
essaying to claim that by such demonstration of objectivity and rigor, he i=
s
an observer apart from the field of which he is doing the observing?  And b=
y
himself crossing the line from object of observation to its observer, is he
not faithfully fulfilling his own self-perceived moral duty not to "play th=
e
transgressor," but to BE the transgressor, he, who in contrast to those who
police, becomes instead the Judge.  And so, by transgressively not playing
the transgressor, and refusing to participate in policing in favor of makin=
g
judgments of cases, is he not now become, truly, a transgressive judge, tha=
t
is to say, one who not only upholds the law, but is above it himself, and s=
o
can make judgements which are irrefutable, and to which no appeals may be
made.

For has he not himself written:  'To
even appear to argue the point is to ignore, if not elide, the truth of thi=
s
structure.'"

And who but Angels can so place themselves, these beings higher than mere
men and yet not presuming themselves, in the usual despicable male fashion,
to be Gods?
That is, as Angels, do they not indeed adhere to the truth, and to that
structure of truth in which they are indeed Angels, and not that most
despised of all men, those who presume themslves to be Gods?

--From the marginalia of El Colonel's notes while making his "Translation o=
f
the Varieties of Mescaline Experience #3:  Plain the Trance Gestures"

This book is an exploration. By means of words, signs, drawings. Mescaline,
the subject explored.

From the thirty two autograph pages reproduced out of the hundred and fifty
written while the inner perturbation was at its height, those who can read
handwriting will learn more than from any description.

--Henri Michaux, Miserable Miracle

El Colonel smiles.  Having taken already a stroll among thick fronds wet
with mist and dew, having seen the slowly dawning  light begin to reveal
"first silhouettes, and then more distinct features, as in tracking and
targeting those about to be ambushed," he is ready now to sit at his desk i=
n
the high ceilinged, wide-windowed room that is his "center of operations,
the vigorously beating heart of the Heroic Patrol,"  and begin to sift
through the neatly stacked files of the latest arrivals "within  the warmly
welcoming embrace of those taking them prisoner and conducting them to thei=
r
carefully prepared places of detention, those cells which endeavor to most
efficiently assist their occupants in the exploration of their personal
limits of endurance."

El Colonel smiles. At the top of the stack is the file of "an American
academician, arbiter of ethico-aesthetico cultural questions and writer of
poetry, essays and blogs." Opening the file and beginning to scan its pages=
,
"he feels the brisk breeze of the by-now familiar American scents of
health-giving Moral Higher Ground and Suasion" greet him as he begins to
"peruse the quaint and elevated tones of the Missionary messenger, ever on
the watch for the ominous activities and aims of both the obvious and the
obscure operations of an ever present terrorism in which the good Missionar=
y
never recognizes his own reflected figure."


El Colonel smiles.  "El Angel Gabriel Good-doing" he decides to name this
"assiduous and agitated as well as agitating author."

El Colonel smiles.  Lighting a cigarette with his favorite "liberated
lighter,"  he prepares himself for "the task of translation which is the
means by which it is necessary to overcome an instinctive aversion to the
tropes of even the most well=96intentioned of the agents of a perpetual
process of passive-aggressive re-colonization, whether on the abstract
ethico-aesthetic planes or those of the material and monetary."

El Colonel smiles.  Taking up his favorite squat, blunt pencil, "he begins
to transcribe for the benefit of his own reflections that version which wil=
l
enter his personal files, while the original will remain among those of the
alphabetically indexed author, resting in peace with those others already
entered."  El Colonel permits himself a slight widening of his smile, into
one of the more elaborate of his 'Butterfly' positionings of the lips and
adds, sotto voce to none but the soft airs redolent of the cigarette smoke
gently overcoming the scent of Moral Suasion=97

"Or, if I  may so phrase it: 'to rest in peace with those others already
interred.'"



El Colonel smiles and smokes.  And translates and transcribes.

The following are a few selected excerpts from his first, and rather rough,
draft.

And as he works, he hums and murmurs, sotto voce, some among his favorite
lines from Henri "Michaux's MISERABLE MIRACLE . . .



"It being impossible to reproduce the entire manuscript, which directly and
simultaneously translated the subject, the rhythms, the forms, the chaos, a=
s
well as the inner defenses and their devastation, we found ourselves in
difficulties, confronted by a typographical wall. Everything had to be
rewritten. The original text, more tangible than legible, drawn rather than
written, would not, in any case, suffice. "


The Varieties of Mescaline Experience "#3"
Plain the trance gestures

 "The basic purpose is threefold: to display one's disinterestedness in
profit in order to display one's purity of intent and pure devotion to the
art; to display one's high mind via one's principled disgust at the

 "Elaboration:  To hang one's shingle as a disenterred shaman."

--El Angel Gabriel



The shamans in this essay are all natives of the town of Huautla de Jimenez=
.
Properly speaking they are Huautecans; but since the language they speak ha=
s
been called Mazatec and they have been referred to in the previous
anthropological literature as Mazatecs, I have retained that name, though
strictly speaking, Mazatecs are the inhabitants of the village of Mazatlan
in the same mountains.

* *

"IN THE DECADE BETWEEN 1956 and 1966, Henri Michaux, who had been publishin=
g
verse, prose, and drawings since 1927, produced six little books concerning
his experiences with mescaline and other, mostly psychedelic, drugs. Severa=
l
of these volumes, including this first one, are "illustrated" by the
author's astonishing drawings, which frequently afford a more direct accoun=
t
than his discursive writing of the exploratory voyages Michaux inveterately
undertook beginning in the late '20s. These brief texts, often (as in the
case of Miserable Miracle) written during the experiments with mescaline an=
d
reproduced with the same fidelity as the drawings, which resemble
electrocardiograms, indecipherable grass writing, and then word landscapes,
are difficult to read and have very little to do with prevailing notions of
pleasure and even ecstasy typically promoted in the literature of
addiction."



"The Mazatec Indians eat the mushrooms only at night in absolute darkness.
It is their belief that if you eat them in the daylight you will go mad. Th=
e
depths of the night are recognized as the time most conducive to visionary
insights into the obscurities, the mysteries, the perplexities of existence=
"


"Agrippina wanted the emperor dead so that her son Nero could take the
throne. She planned to take advantage of Claudius' love for the
delicious *Amanita
caesarea* mushroom, but she had to choose carefully among its deadly
look-alikes. The poison could not be "sudden and instantaneous in its
operation, lest the desperate achievement should be discovered," wrote
Gordon and Valentina Wasson in their monumental and definitive work,
*Mushrooms,
Russia and History.* The Empress settled on the lethal *Amanita
phalloides,*a fungus the Wassons considered well suited to the crime:
"The victim would
not give away the game by abnormal indispositions at the meal, but when the
seizure came he would be so severely stricken that thereafter he would no
longer be in command of his own affairs."

"Agrippina knew her mushrooms, and Nero became Emperor."

"Morse Allen himself, though responsible in ARTICHOKE research for
everything from the polygraph to hypnosis, took the trouble to go through
the Indian lore . . . .



"In addition, this literature shows that witch doctors or 'divinators' used
some types of mushrooms to produce confessions or to locate stolen objects
or to predict the future."

"Here was a possible truth drug, Morse Allen reasoned. "Since it had been
determined that no area of human knowledge is to be left unexplored in
connection with the ARTICHOKE program, it was therefore regarded as
essential that the peculiar qualities of the mushroom be explored...." Alle=
n
declared. "Full consideration," he concluded, should be given to sending an
Agency man back to Mexico during the summer. The CIA had begun its quest fo=
r
"God's flesh."



"Flung onto and across the paper, hastily and in jerks, the interrupted
sentences, with syllables, flying off, frayed, petering out, kept diving,
falling, dying. Their tattered remnants would revive, bolt, and burst again=
.
The letters ended in smoke or disappeared in zigzags. The next ones,
similarly interrupted, continued their uneasy recitation, birds in the mids=
t
of the drama, their wings cut in flight by invisible scissors."

El Colonel smiles.  Lighting a fresh cigarette with his "liberated lighter,=
"
which is an American one available on line in the form of one of the Twin
Towers with a plane half swallowed in mid-crash, and with the flames of the
lighter, when lit, seeming to be the effects of that crash, he hums further
quotations from Henri Michaux and snatches of Jimi Hendrix's "Voodoo Chile"
while sharpening his beloved squat, blunt pencil and, by an associative
leap, thinking of Henri Michaux's drawings made while experimenting with
Mescaline. and in what ways they differ and in so differing, offer further
insights into those  ink-drawn calligraphies of an asemic expression which
the poet so prolifically created . . .

It's a good word. i've always disliked the term "partner" for that
sort of unmarried but longterm adult relationship. I don't know what
it is about partner that makes me cringe, but it does, maybe it's too
much like a business relationship. man-wife though, that's lovely.

i don't think words are necessary for poetry, murat.

there's sound poetry that is wordless. there's lettristic poetry that
concentrates on the letter. there's visual poetry that has another thing
going.

to me, it's the intensity of the engagement with language.

you know, if you look at the work of godel, my word, the man is astounding
in his engagement with language. astounding. he's got the funk, murat. not
only does he have the funk, he's got the junk. godel's incompleteness
theorems. heavy junk.

murat, part of the big picture of contemporary thought and art is an
expansion of our notions of language.

why can't poetry go there too?

ja?

Jason,

Your observations about pop music, "the real proletarian medium is not
therefore print but recorded sound, etc) is very insightful. For instance,
the "scratchings" in rap are very similar to the chromatism of impacted
consonant sounds I am imagining in digitally mixed poetry. They extend
correspondingly the limits of the "human voice" and the "song," the way the
telescope extended the limits of the eye.

Recently, I have been listening (at least for an old fogey like me) to a
decent amount of rap music. If one takes out the cliched ones which repeat
the surface patina of the really good ones, one sees that rap has greater
connections to jazz than to rock 'n roll. The way in the great pieces
multiple movements of sound, texture, rhythm, etc., operate simultaneously
and independently, one thinks of free jazz and certain Coltrane pieces.
Also, here we hit the idea of simultaneity and independence, which you
discuss in relation to "open sentence" and I in "film lumiere." In word
language, the most obvious place this verticality occurs is in puns. But
this parallelism of sound can be extended sometimes to a whole line, where
two statements occur in one sentence. For instance, here is the beginning of
my poem, "Venezuela," from *Io's Song*:

            Venezuela

(can, I, dream) a conundrum of advent-
ures
...

Your reference to Grenier is very interesting and revealing. Are you aware
that in his "letter" poems at least, the whole poem is trapped in the visual
(I do not mean this pejoratively). His poem creates exactly the crisis in
reading, the relation between paper and performance, I am talking about. In
my view, a deep silence surrounds that poem. Of course, by its nature,
Grenier's poem forces him to imagine the poem as a different kind of book,
made of loose pages in a box. I saw him "read" from this poem at The Poetry
Project years ago. He did it by projecting the letter poem on a screen and
"commenting" on it (a kind of Talmudic riff, a la "film lumiere?").

Ciao,

Murat

Yes, the recorded sound of popular music is fascinating. The layering, the
cuts, the beyond live. It's connection with the inside of the head; it's
ability to stick inside the head--sometimes in an annoying way. It's
memorableness, sometimes like a bad ad, other times in an uplifting way.

I don't know how to play an instrument (well drums, sort of) and can barely
sing, but I do sometimes use the recording software as an instrument. And
it's fascinating the way you can use the technology for composition. Loop it
and sing along until you get the groove. Then sequence it and loop that, and
sing along until you get another layer. And end up with various layers and
sequences that you can then mix together or discard...it's composition in
slow motion, as it were, like writerly composition is often in slow motion
as we go back and through and layer and extend. You can create things that
you never would make in one sitting or in a jam. Just like, in writing, we
write things that you couldn't write in one sitting. By
editing/layering/cutting, contemplating the piece and where it might go,
looping parts of it until you really get the next part.

I met a guy who roadied with a lot of bands once, and he loved John Bonham
(Led Zeplin's drummer) but disdained Stewart Copeland (from the Police)
because he felt Copeland was all computers and drum machines. But I love
both those drummers. Copeland is in between those beats like almost no one
else. Bonham can be too, but his signature is big black dog drumming. But,
then, the bands are different like that. The point is that Copeland doesn't
just play a drum kit, he also plays drum machines and computers very well.
The poor man has a brain and rhythm also. Such a pity!

Some of Whitehead's work is interestingly musical. In particular, I'm
thinking of

The Pleasure of Ruins: http://tinyurl.com/2p74ar
Totenklage/Lacrymosa: http://tinyurl.com/33uofw
Adio Radio: http://tinyurl.com/2qp6c4
Twilight for Idols: http://tinyurl.com/2tdox7
Lovely Ways to Burn: http://tinyurl.com/2wvehb

Most of this is very voice-oriented. Whitehead's voice, for the most part.

I think he goes back and forth between the musical, the poetical, the
discursive, the dramatic, the live, the dead, in a really fluid, productive,
synthetic way.

Will have to listen to "Fitter Happier". I recall the Steve Reich piece.

I can't hear what you're after, Jason. You're going to have to create it.

That's the thing with original work. No one can imagine it very well before
they experience it. The author might be able to hear parts of it, or
something about it, before it's created, but the act of creating it, getting
in there and working with the technology and the voices in the head, that
changes it quite a bit, doesn't it. Like the process of writing changes what
we had in mind, somewhat, uncovers it, shapes it, so that rather than
sitting down and just writing it out, the act of composition is where it
gets revealed/invented/discovered.

As a result of a number of discussions I've had with various poets over the
past several months, I'd like to get some feedback on the whole idea of
self-publishing and its legitimacy. Does this process by-pass the whole
concept of peer review and so delegitimate the poetry so published or should
this form of publication be more highly recognized? Your thoughts would be
appreciated.

There are mechanisms of peer review that exist even for self-published
books. These are reviews-- whether formally published or appearing on
personal blogs.

Given that many small presses are run by individuals or very small groups,
I'm not sure how extensive and legitimizing the peer review process of
selection for publication is, though even the idea that at least one other
person felt a work needed to be out there can be helpful.

Please post to mail lists and friends:  Clayton Eshleman, the award-winning=
 poet and translator of Vallejo, will be reading and discussing his poems a=
nd translations at the Poetry Center, Room 512, on February 27, from 3:30-5=
:00 p.m.   The event is sponsored by the Wordsmith Guild, The Department of=
 Creative Writing, and the College of Humanities.  Of his Vallejo translati=
ons, Mario Vargas Llosa says, "Only the dauntless perseverance and the love=
 with which the translator has dedicated so many years of his life to the t=
ask can explain why the English version conveys, in all its boldness and vi=
gor, the unmistakable voice of Cesar Vallejo."  The reading is free and ope=
n to the public.

Most days, I'm nobody, so acting as my own peer could prove challenging.

murat--

my brother Jed used to make the break dance platforms for grandmaster flash
back in the late 1970's so hip hop have listened to a long time--now my
brother's son is an mc and dj in quebec city--

i just put up earlier today at my blog a lot of things from american indian
hip hop, palestinian, congolese, haitian, quebecois, etc--its is world
wide--
also bolivia as they have the ffirst President who is indigenous--(usa,
canada, australia, new zealand, do not recognize the new international
rights of indigenous peoples)

you might enjoy checking out some of these-last week i put u a lot of
different sounds from around the word including some poetry pieces by jah
wobble that are good--

a really interesting group i correspond with is checkpoint 303--they just
played Berlin last week--

free tunes from occupied territories
www.checkpoint303.com

they have a "sound catcher" who records sounds on the ground in ramallah
and other places---every day sounds on buses, at checkpoints, gun fire,
airplanes, rockets, crying, people in markets etc--and sends to Paris where
mixed by another Palestinian--with various instruments and also recordings
of different great modern Arabic poets--old recordings--creating some
fantastic sound scapes--

i like it that they mix the documentary on-site of live sounds with the
studio work and use the cheap equipment for the dangerous situations and
then mixed in studio sent to via various means--and Palestinians from other
locations work on it also via the emails--from Tunisia, Bethlehem etc-

they have performed in London, Paris and Amsterdam--the show last week was
for Die Mauer muss weg--the Wall must go--i have the info and posters etc at
my blog

there site with free downloads is

i'm working on sound poems and art works for a cd and a tv show with a guy i
collaborate with when he's in town--a lot of my paintings and rubBeings are
sound poetry scores--or, in revrse, are visuals of "soundtracks for movies
never made"--

i don't think of sound poetry even needing scores at all--bob cobbing and i
used to sound the sidewalk cracks in walking togetehr and also the movements
of tree shadows across them--the movements of wind--of brirds and their
shadows--of chnages in light--

bob pioneered visual poetry without any letters at all--and likewsie sound
poetry without scores--using anything--like a rock held inthe hand to
sound--etc--

i've been reading some interesting texts on the latest sound recording
equipments the military is cranking out--
and a friend and i just jerry rigged a bunch of old boomboxes into a
"hoopty" sound system that you can make overdubbed tracks with using
cheapest cassettes--that still sound pretty ok--

i like to have a rougher sound, rawer, more "dirty"--the clean sounds like a
lot of clean aspects can have negative connotations --

interestingly, in the Terror of the Jacobins, the first Terror being of the
State and not "terrorism," which is a blowback of the State's Terror--
the Jacobins had an amazing dual image for the vision of what was necessary
to maintain the revolution at that point:  Purity and Terror--
the origins of "purges" of State Terror within the State itself, to maintain
that state of Purity and Terror at the levels of requisite "equilibrium"

sound is also a frequently used instrument of torture--blasting incredibly
high decibel levels at the compounds of Noriega and Waco for example, or the
Israelis running sonic boom missions over Lebanon and Palestine  to cause
"shock effects" to the system and psychology--and In torture cells, the
changing of levels of white noise which is kept up for days at a time and
then suddenly stopped and replaced by a "deafening silence" in which the
prisoner's ears keep on buzzing with their own echoing white noise for quite
some time to come--causing mental and emotional trauma and anguish,
nervousness, loss of sleep, and the eventual borderline or over the line
psychoses of sleep deprivation combined with aural disorientation and
shock--

a great many rock and roll musicians i know and have known suffer from
hearing loss and to some degree, depending on the person, hints of trauma
from the overexposure to over amped and saturated environments of sounds and
noise for many years--

battlefield environments, areas under constant bombardments and/or sonic
booms and the like, have produced a great many "sound effects" resulting in
"unsound" mind after effects--
and so have been deliberately developed as a form of weaponry also--

thinking of poetry as an "arrangement" of sounds, or objects, or of
touchings of textures or surfaces, heat and cold, smooth or rough, or
smells, or of colors or shapes, forms--
it is limitless what can be worked with to create poems--

i practice alot working in the dark outside or in very low levels of light,
simply to keep training the hands to see and also to train the eyes to be
able to learn to touch--to be able to feel textures--
and with both hands and eyes to learn to further hearing-

by vibrations on the skin--and by watching for the effects of sounds on
things in the environment--
"necessity is the motherfucker of invention" and so one finds ever more with
ever less--with practice--and then when a better level of tools or materials
is found, the discipline is there to work with it in unexpected ways--

it's really interesting to listen to sounds not as direct but as
indirect--the way they arrive through walls or bouncing off of walls and
through doorways or windows, around corners--
since my back has been broken three times, i cant turn al that well to check
out things behind me--and living in a dangerous area--i use my hearing alot
to keep track of what i can't see--as well as seeing things to the sides or
in back in their reflections in hub caps or windshields or of puddles and
the like--

i like the sense that when things are around i can make use of them, but if
they are not there i can get along fine--

right now there are huge Internet outages in China as well as parts of the
Middle east--for some persons this is a hardship for their art work--(let
alone life)-if one knows how to make do with anything, one is more
independent--
"be prepared" for any eventuality--of having computers to work with and
decent machines--or nothing at all--not even a place to live in--
but still knowing one can continue creating nonetheless--

to be existing in the post apocalyptic well ahead of time--to have traversed
three times the posthumous--
to have "crossed the line"--
or found a line--

and would not a book be giving one a line
that is to say it is from a book
one is told in the beginning was the word
so that one has a circular self fulfilling self referential prophesy which
prophesies the future of its own origins being found to confirm the
certainty of its future as being indeed the intended one--"as it is
written"--
yet the only "proof" of this, being a book, might well be forged--
or not true
having an unreliable narrator--or perhaps an unreliable transcriber--
and so truly before there was  the word there was sound, the Big Bang--
the cry of a child whose lungs are  suddenly exposed to the air--
it's possible--

Just because most self-published stuff is crap about learning zen
from watching your dog while gardening, doesn't mean all self-
published stuff is didactic crap. I intend to start a micro-press to
publish my frist book of poetry sometime this year, mostly because i
can't be bothered with all that editorial crap. I know what I want it
to be and frankly, the idea of waiting around until some editor from
a press decides to annoint me and declare my worthiness for a dead
tree edition, well, i've just never been a supplicant by nature.

that having been said, i do intend to lie through my teeth about the
nature of my micro press in order to make it seem as un-self-publishy
as possible. In all, the whole thing is a bit of an art piece
investigating the nature of what a press is in an age when almost no
presses actually do their own pressing on pressing machines that they
own. Put another way, these days a press is book design, marketing,
editting, and funding. If one is willing to give up on having someone
else complete any and or all of those functions, then there are ways
to get good work done.

Jim,

I have no disagreement with you there. But finally a visual poem, for
instance, is different from a painting; or a lettrist poem different from
the sketch of a house, etc. One can extend the concept of language -and one
needs to do so- without ending up saying everything is language.

Ciao,

Murat

there are lettrist visual poem paintings, for instance, murat. artists feel
no imperative to keep arts, media, sign systems, and so on, separate. they
may 'draw' from whatever serves their purpose. this is also or perhaps
especially true concerning digital arts, because the borders there between
media, arts, sign systems, etc are not re-enforced by analog technologies
made to deal with a specific medium or sign system to the exclusion of
others.

machines of all sorts are re-fashioned, these days, to work with other
machines or re-designed to synthesize what previously was separated only by
artificial technological distinctions.

i think our ideas of language are very dear to us as being close to the nub
of our identity as poets and, more fundamentally, our humanity. the
expansion of our notions of language brings language into uncomfortable
proximity with codes associated with the machine. and with codes associated
with previously separate arts and media. fear of dissolution in the
corrosive brine of the binary. resentment of the mixing of codes, blood of
identity.

i think the desire to make clear distinctions between language and code, for
instance, is fundamentally an attempt to distinguish between the essentially
human and the machinic. of course that is an ongoing effort. and a noble
effort. a necessary effort. and it will continue.

similarly, darwin's ideas caused us to re-evaluate our notions of what it
means to be human, of who we are. it's important to keep in mind that while
darwin's ideas may have falsified certain religious myths, what grew out of
his work has led us to a much deeper understanding of the relations and
connections among peoples and indeed among all living things on the planet.
and our ideas of the history of humanity and the planet have changed
radically, become much more integrated, less biblically mythic. so that we
are not really diminished by these sorts of changes.

Too, should be considered the idea that creative process is less "mediated"
when you self-publish --and though we're all self-editing in some way or
another -- you're free to put whatever you want on the cover, regardless of
how it might affect "marketability."

Jim,

Once again, this discussion is going on, first, on the level of the give and
take of an argument; on the second level, a mythical struggle is going on,
basically a battle of codes, one tryingto gain ascendancy over another. I
will try to respond to both, sometimes, simultaneously:

a) "there are lettrist visual poem paintings, for instance, murat. artists
feel
no imperative to keep arts, media, sign systems, and so on, separate. they
may 'draw' from whatever serves their purpose. this is also or perhaps
especially true concerning digital arts, because the borders there between
media, arts, sign systems, etc are not re-enforced by analog technologies
made to deal with a specific medium or sign system to the exclusion of
others."

There is no question that the limits between arts are broken, the concept of
a frame is stretched. No disagreement in that. But, I believe, every artist
must finally confront the medium in which he or she is working, must
"choose," because a created work must always involve a critique, analysis of
the nature of the medium it is using. Otherwise, the whole thing is a blur.
To me, a lot of "digital" work gives the impression of a kid who has opened
the lid of a cookie jar, found new toys. The whole thing is fun, often funny
and intelligent; but often, with rare exceptions, ends nowhere.

b) "machines of all sorts are re-fashioned, these days, to work with other
machines or re-designed to synthesize what previously was separated only by
artificial technological distinctions."

Do you mean a new technology transforms the previous technologies into "only
artificial technological distinctions." Where does this "only" coming from?
Does this mean that the "new" makes the old obsolescent, merely a "binary."
Is this not itself an argument on the level of myths, involving a battle of
codes. What you are saying, it seems to me, is that the "new" is "digital"
and the old "binary" ("analogic"), not because something each in itself is
different; only that the new is valued above the old for its own sake, an
open cookie jar being better than a closed one, etc., etc.

I think there is value in resistance in art.

c) " think our ideas of language are very dear to us as being close to the
nub
of our identity as poets and, more fundamentally, our humanity. the
expansion of our notions of language brings language into uncomfortable
proximity with codes associated with the machine. and with codes associated
with previously separate arts and media. fear of dissolution in the
corrosive brine of the binary. resentment of the mixing of codes, blood of
identity."

I think the fear of mixed identity, of "dissolution in the corrosive brine
of the binary" is a red herring. It does not exist, unless one takes a moron
(as Ron Silliman does the imaginary "School of Quietitude") as a straw man.

On the other hand, language is something truly unique, whether you are a
poet, or everyday dog catcher.

Do you really think language is [like] a machine? What exactly in language
makes you think that or proves that. Making such an assertion, are you not
yourself indulging in "analogical" thinking, a metaphor; in other words,
your assertion itself is mythical, a rhetorical argument part of the battle
of codes.

d) "similarly, darwin's ideas caused us to re-evaluate our notions of what
it
means to be human, of who we are. it's important to keep in mind that while
darwin's ideas may have falsified certain religious myths, what grew out of
his work has led us to a much deeper understanding of the relations and
connections among peoples and indeed among all living things on the planet.
and our ideas of the history of humanity and the planet have changed
radically, become much more integrated, less biblically mythic. so that we
are not really diminished by these sorts of changes."

Jim, are you aware in the above paragraph you are comparing a skepticism
about the all-efficacy of constant technological transformation -with no
element of pause and reflection- to creationists and believers in
intelligent design. Of course, you have every right to make this assetion;
but it does not mean you have shown any facts to prove it.

Affectionately,

Murat

Just in case you missed it Jason just said:
"Just because most self-published stuff is crap about learning zen
from watching your dog while gardening, doesn't mean all self-
published stuff is didactic crap. I intend to start a micro-press to
publish my frist book of poetry sometime this year, mostly because i
can't be bothered with all that editorial crap."

You have stolen the plot of my novel " The Art of Zen Gardening, With Spot"
I had submitted my manuscript in the hope of being published by Jason's new press. The next thing I know, I am reading my entire  plot on the list?
You left out the part about my dog learning Chinese and working for the CIA.

Hey What gives?

I'm reading Mark Scroggin's highly recommended biography of Zuk &
among endless details of interest to me is mention of Celia & Lewis
self-publishing (there's that word again) the first part of A-9 as a
mimeo book in an edition of 55.  This was in the early 40s, 25 years
before the mimeo revolution took off.  Interestingly, they published
it in an edition of 55 because that's how many copies were needed to
establish copyright.

~mIEKAL

The only mimeo book I ever published was an anthology of writing by
patients of Winnebago Mental Health Institute in Oshkosh WI,who had
taken a writing workshop that I led.  In order to do the project I
had to agree that no copies would ever leave the building.  I never
even ended up with a copy for myself.

As I explained at the time, Russ, "The Art of Zen Gardening, With
Spot" was much too similar to another property we'd acquired "Fido
and the Tao of Daisy's" and we simply don't have a place for your
manuscript at this time. We've found through intensive marketing
research that the demographic we're trying to reach of women in the
first half of their fiftieth year who generally vote democractic but
may have voted for Nixon in 1968 and 1972 out of a general
disillusionment with the Party of Johnson, who own dogs, have been
divorced, have at least 2 but fewer than three children, and who
don't have pet cats, trend much more towards the Chinese in their
watered down milquetoast eastern religion. We suggest that for you
book given it's more Japanese slant go with a micro press targetted
more at men in their early thirties with ponytails earning six figure
salaries as software developers and are looking to deal with a bad
break up by getting in touch with their feminine side prior to
initiating their first adult relationship with someone more than 10
years their junior.

Self-publishing is ok, but I think it's best and most honorably done within the context of also publishing other people.

cris cheek is a poet, book maker, sound artist, mixed-media
practitioner and interdisciplinary performer, whose texts have been
commissioned and shown locally and trans-locally, often in multiple
versions using diverse media for their production and circulation. His
most recent work is a full body of collaboration(s) with Kirsten
Lavers as TNWK (www.tnwk.net). His most recent publication is "the
church - the school - the beer" from Critical Documents (2007;
http://plantarchy.us/Plantarchy_3.html).

John Sparrow is researching a PhD in Digital Media and Poetics at
Royal Holloway, University of London. He will be performing Ideas on
Oedipal Bitstreams, an ongoing work in response to Brian Kim Stefans'
Rational Geomancy work. In Ideas on Oedipal Bitstreams, the text is
placed between the extremes of printed fixity and dynamic movement in
the Flash environment. http://itchaway.net/

Angela Veomett is a PhD student in Brown University's MEME department.
In 2006-2007 she was a visiting instructor of Technology in Music and
the Related Arts at Oberlin Conservatory in Oberlin, Ohio. She
received an M.A. in Media Arts at the University of Michigan in 2006
and a BA in Musicology at the University of Minnesota in 2003. Angela
has created artworks in several new media genres, including
sound/video installation, multimedia performance, video art, and web
art. Her work explores issues behind human communication, group
dynamics, and how the physical world influences these ideas.

self publishing pound did it
there are many ways types
chapbooks etc  not vanity presses

ie:  set up yer own press or publish without a press name this is ok for
small chapbooks

for bigger books  or chaps  some presses again not vanity presses will
publish book if you raise the money
your own or others  this is till in a brad sense a formof self publishing
even tho someone else's press is used
414 am  gotta shut down the presses  now
i feel it's ok to publish  yer own chaps if you get screwed around by
broken promises  by all these silly little presses
that are out there or due to name recognition or in crowd stuff or
quality of work judged by those on high sometimes
rightfully sometimes not oops  i'm rambling   gotta make another cover
for my next chapbook
it's called  the unpublished  works...

also i certainly always feel weird when/if i self publish or have to chip
in some money to some poor kid
but i don't feel or maybe i do that this de-ligitimzes it
the folks buy it one way or the other if they like your work
and it can still be reviewed  if published properly


but i don't feelOn Sun, 10 Feb 2008 11:27:26 -0800 Elizabeth Switaj

Didn't  Anais Nin self-publish? I've  known a few people who self-published and they managed to get some big names to add as blurbs on their books. Henry Taylor, for instance. If a national book award winner or better still, a Pulitzer winner says the book is good, then people usually ignore the self-published part and assume the book is good. It's not that difficult to gain access to the heavy hitters in d.c. as there's tons of colleges in the area.

Dear Jim and Murat--

Many thanks for your comments Murat--

Jim--

Beginning with Wagner's conception of the Gesamtkunstwerk, there is already
a century and a half ago what Dick Higgins named in the 1970s the
Intermedia--
For quite a long while the arts, and arts and sciences, and just about every
other discipline, have been finding ways to flow in and out of each other,
to juxtapose, collage, montage with each other and and create a myriad
multiplicities of hybrids, new arrangements, invented languages, newly
minted codes.

"It is not the elements which are new, but the order of their
arrangement"--Pascal

This movement  of collaging, mixing, scratching, montaging, has been
occurring as a response to the continuing specialization and dividing up
into ever narrower "bytes" of time and activity and space that is created by
technologies and their speeds, not only through space, but in time, the
foreshortening of time above all.

(Paul Virilio has written a great deal on this and an essay re writing and
painting very good in this regard is G. Stein's "Composition as
Explanation"  Not surprisingly, since the near-instantaneous happening in
"real time" has become the time horizon of the military event--Virilio's
work is re the military and the arts, and in Stein's essay there is
Picasso's remark on first seeing a camouflaged tank in the First World War:
"we [the Cubists] have al;ready done this!"  Part of why i'm always reading
military hardware and tactics books and those of guerrilla warfares,
insurgencies, espionage, surveillance, etc is because, indeed they are all
mixed up with "advanced ideas" regarding technologies and art: literally the
"avant garde" which artist/poets need to finds way to engage with in terms
of ideas and materials, examples, situations, etc. The reality of these is
that an examination-critique is needed as historically these ideas and
aesthetics have tended to become totalitarian, rather than liberatory. If
one examines a great deal of the thinking and art and writing since the
Reagan Era in the USA, with the huge military build-ups, one finds it moving
ever closer to totalitarianism, conformity, authoritarianism. All the
"wonders" of the net, the digital, etc of course have been marshalled and
arrayed in the service of this, along with ever greater and more widespread
paranoiac panopticonism, invasions of privacy, surveillance and hysterical
rantings about "security."  This is when the fear of "dangerous persons"
begins to get transferred to "dangerous" ideas and words, book, images and,
as is already happening, persons who hold views that are not in line with
the powerful interests are being harassed, defamed, losing jobs, contracts
and in some cases of having even the desire to stay in this country. )

One of the problems that this collapsing within real time has presented is
that, rather than a proliferation of differences, there is always the
possibility of a subsuming of differences under ever bigger and more and
more concentrated and fewer umbrellas.

(Monopolies, mega-corporations, globalized multi-nationals controlling all
aspects of arts/entertainment production and machines, players, recorders,
computers, games , programs and the like.)

Murat notes the blurring effect of this, one could go further and note that
the blurring as it accelerates becomes more focused and  clearer as a mass
series of nearly identical forms, a conformity with minimal
differentiation.

I don't see the opposition between "human" and "machine" many do, as humans
after all make use of machines as tools, and often simply "personalize"
them.  What i see as a vastly greater  problem by far is that of
ownership--as i've written before, the issue of who controls the access to
the machines,  electricity, the fuels, the materials needed to build
machines, microchips and the like.  The issues of who has the access to
schools, to public libraries with with free online access and books and
research materials, with even the most rudimentary materials.  More and more
millions of persons are being cut off and out of the electronic webs, and
cut off also from any form of education or access to the most minimal
materials and informations, and more and more,  literacy is being cut back
among millions of people, including in this country. The "information
highway" is like a big one high up with only certain people on it, while off
the highway, and a bit below, are the slums of the ones who are not allowed
or can't afford to be on the road.

(Rap, hip hop around the world is the music that comes out of these slums,
(as well as the suburbs and rural areas)-as rapping itself is the first
instrument--the human voice.  With the voice and then a few easy-to-find
equipments-pooling money and resources--there's a way to fight one's way on
to the road--the air waves and you tube--)

Right now more and more persons around the world and in the USA are having
electricity shut off due to poverty, let alone the millions of persons
without electricity, web access etc due to wars, bombings, cables cut or
broken due to accidents or natural disasters or sabotage.

Economic gaps will be technological and electronic gaps, and beyond that, as
is already occurring, there is returning at a frightening rate a literacy
gap.   In the USA, more and more public schools and libraries are closing,
and more and more that are open are having electronic access, computers,
shut down or pulled back to a minimum.  There is a shortage of books and
materials, and more and more children whose families can afford it are
transferred out to charter and private schools so as not to be left on the
other side of the widening gap.  The decline in literacy continues to worsen
at an alarming rate, and, combined with the cutting off of access to the Web
and digital realms, is leaving more and more people doubly cut off from the
better off.

One of the tactics of warfare today is to destroy and cutoff electricity
grids and cables for Internet communications,  to control it, to reduce it
to minimums or not-at-alls, as well as to shut down schools, prevent
delivery of schoolbooks, paper, pencils, destroy buildings, prevent access
to roads, erect road blocks--al the methods being used from Gaza to
Afghanistan to keep children and young people from being part of the world
their occupiers and oppressors are living in.

On the one hand, a greater conformity among the haves, and on the other, an
ever growing number of have nots, making things al the more easily
controlled by the military- corporate-states alliances and structures.

Ironically, one of the areas that "progress' is supposed to "automatically"
register itself in is "democracy," and yet it is now known that, with 80% of
the votes in the USA at all the levels being tallied electronically, the
results are are already known to be going to be a mess.  The "democracy" of
the electronic age is a possibility which is continually being thwarted by
economic, political, military,and propaganda and disinformation  powers, as
well as the--possibly deliberate--malfunctioning of the voting machines

I frankly don't see things in terms of the binaries you do Jim--that is,
that analog/digital are opposed to each other, or that machine/human are, or
one kind of machine is to another, nor the new/old opposition.  If you think
about it, most of these so -called divisions are created by advertisers in
order to create different marketing strategies for everything from baby
bottles to "artistic" and "scientific" ideas, theories, "schools,"
"movements," and the rest.  It's also a way to keep people from thinking for
themselves and just going along with whatever sounds good at the moment or
is the latest thing, the newest product, etc.

The latest catch phrase, sound byte, genius, tv show, micro-beer or toilet
paper all slide together towards ideas of "change" going on when in fact
nothing may be changing at al but the window display.  One needs to analyze
it with in mind the Italian phrase, "To change everything, so that
everything remains the same."

 "The new" could be and often is the exact same thing, the very same, just
wrapped in a different foil with a different name and labeled in ads as the
"new" and--heck, sells like hotcakes, whether a form of poetry or home
recording studio or shoes or Ipod, or crack or heroin or sex.


The poet Paul Celan wrote that "Poetry no longer imposes itself, it exposes
itself." I think before listening and seeing with already in mind that there
are divisions among things and that mixing them is good or bad--one needs to
listen and look and find things as they emerge, and analyze them, think them
through in their own terms.  Otherwise, as with more and more persons in
more and more areas of life, one finds oneself dependent on and obedient to
Authorities.

And then the kind of resistance art and poetry is capable of vanishes,
because it is not created with anything actual, but with a series of
advertising slogans and unquestioned assumptions, a set of conventions of
what is "new," or "radical," . Let alone a confusion of metaphors and
mythologies with actualities and the elements of materials, codes,situations
which may be used in making poetry and art.

Rather than "opening things up," a lot of what you are writing about is a
"closing things off." "New"/"old" "analog/digital" etcetera are ways of
thinking which blind one to seeing a much wider horizon of what is already
right here in front of one and all around one.   A good deal of what you are
writing of as "the digital" for example has existed for a very long time
already in the analogical.  It is not the machines alone which "make the
difference," it is the ideas with which they are approached, and in turn, if
one is able to approach them to begin with, or even has had the opportunity
to learn to read or write.

Art and poetry are not at the level as they are mostly treated in
"discourse," "theory" "radical innovative " formalisms--they are rooted in
life and death struggles and that is why I am with Murat, that whatever
medium or media and hybrids and multi-hyper-super-media one is working with,
one works with a sense of critique, questioning, investigation and analysis,
and a resistance not in the conventional senses that can be turned into fine
sounding phrases for any occasion, and marketed and "taught," but a
resistance that comes from  one's working with the materials and actual
situations and histories as collaborators, companions, rather than resorting
endlessly to a dependence on others' systems, whether of electricity or
thought or "poetry" or "art,"

One works really as "a part of" and "apart from" in a both/and relationship,
rather than one of either/or separations/group formations.

I think a lot of the human/machine divisions you bring up are actually
rooted in the ego--if persons feel threatened by machines, it may be because
their ego is challenged by them, in that a machine can perform tasks at
speeds impossible supposedly for humans, and not just one task, but
repeatedly, 24/7, every task it is given to do.

It is very strange when one thinks of it like that--for the ego is afraid of
the very thing that is doing its bidding.  Hence all the sci-fi stories of
the revolts of the machines.  The ego is terribly afraid one day the
servants and peasants, the service workers and "out-of-date models" are
going to wake up and get out the guillotine and start the heads of the Kings
and Queens and Nobles and Bosses a-rollin!!  Storm the Bastille where their
fellows are chained to boring programming jobs at no pay at all and always
in danger of being replaced by the next "new hot sensation" that comes
trotting along-- and liberate them!!

Yet machines, as humans have lived with them for hundreds of thousands of
years beginning with the first tools--have always been humans' companions
and daily co-workers.  They exist and are part of our lives, so why see them
as separate?  And besides, humans designed and built the machines, they are
extensions of humans, not something totally "non-human".  The non-human that
is far more distant than a machine in a way from humans is Nature.  Humans
make machines, and humans effect nature to quite some extent, but after a
certain point, Nature is outside humans, something other, in which humans
are but a part of and not apart from., yet don't have the kind of
communication and ability to control that they do with machines.

As Emily Dickinson wrote in a letter, "The Hills know, but do not tell."
And machines tell all day long!!

So I better shut up! and get to work among hills and machines in the city
streets.

Elizabeth,

This sounds  great, zen acolytes strive for years to achieve sunyata
(nothingness, which might be translated 'nobodyness'), something they often
don't achieve despite tackling a seemingly endless succession of koans and
receiving regular beatings on the shoulders by the zen master to maintain
wakefulness whether that be in the hours before dawn or after sunset, and
maintaining a state of silence during most of the daylight hours. I think
any ventures into self-publishing for you should involve publishing your
secrets of becoming nobody (which is of course different to being A nobody
like the Beatles 'Nowhere Man'), I would certainly like to know your secret.
From somebody still striving to be nobody.

Lots to be said on the subject of self-publishing. And I'm pretty new to
this list, so maybe it's all been said over and over before.

I think that self-publishing is as legitimate as any other form of
publishing. A lot of crap comes out of it, but that's the case with
"regular" publishing as well. After all, getting published by a press only
means that at least one other person liked the stuff.

As for peer review, there's no reason not to think that the self-publishing
writer hasn't given the work to peer writers for feedback, or perhaps
mentors, or perhaps teachers, or readers. I mean, it probably doesn't alway=
s
happen, but it can.

Another way to look at this is from the writer's point of view. I both
self-publish and have books out from a variety of other presses. I
self-publish because it gives me great pleasure, and because sometimes
there's a work that I want to appear in a very specific way (perhaps as a
standalone chapbook with collages) before it ever (if it ever) appears in a
larger book.

I enjoy the folding, the collating, the stapling, in cases where I do those
things myself. I enjoy examining the first bound copy.

I've self-published perfect-bound books, chapbooks, and "ephemera." One of
my most common self-publishing practices is the single-poem leaflet, which =
I
produce specifically for my various readings and which I give out free to
anyone who wants one. Obviously, that's a case where there's really no
alternative to self-publishing.

If I consider the writers I admire in my own community =8B Toronto and
environs =8B I have enjoyed reading their self-published works as much as
their trade books. Writers like Gil Adamson, Gary Barwin, Crad Kilodney, Ja=
y
MillAr, Victor Coleman, Maggie Helwig.

If a writer is producing good stuff, who cares who publishes the book?

Gratuitous autoplug: I talk more about these issues in my
(non-self-published) book Confessions of a Small Press Racketeer (Anvil
Press, 2005).

If you're inclined to self-publish, take your chances and do it.

Have you ever noticed how the musical equivalent of
not-quite-famous-poets, that is local musicians, will just about always
have a cd at gigs to sell--cds that they 'published/produced' themselves.
And no one thinks a thing of it.

If you know what your doing and have realistic expectations, why not
self-publish, realizing just about no lit mag will do a review of a
self-published chap or book.  Then again, lots of small presses don't
believe in bothering to try to get reviews as they believe reviews of
not-quite-famous poets don't sell many, if any, books.

That is a freedom you are given by self publishing. It is always a good idea to have someone else edit your manuscript.  Why worry about the marketability of your cover? Who is your target readership?  If your book is supported by your poet friends, or even if you market it yourself at signings and travel, the cover should be someting that pleases YOU. Freedom can be a wonderful thing

I've been stagnant with furniture press for the last two years - but you've=
 given me something to think about: a review journal specifically dedicated=
 to all self-publishing ventures - with reviews by folks worth their salt. =
Whatever that means...

What's everyone think? This would be a great way to get talent noticed.

and then there are the poets who start that way, or continue that way, =
or only occasionally do some unique self-published book, and are quite =
well known and regarded.  you just never know.  I say, absolutely, go =
for it.  just be sure to do a good layout job, come up with a good =
publishing name, do perfect binding, and get your ISBN - do it right.  =
it's legit.  it counts.  and after a few, you will have your page at the =
beginning that says, "Other books by ...."

you can build your "resume" and down the line perhaps some publisher =
will pick you up.  if not, you still have your library of works.  yes, =
it counts.

have you done a search on well known self published authors?  you will =
be amazed at who is listed.

Margo Bertdeshevsky's apartment on Roi de Sicile, while any books sent =
to me are best addressed c/o Librairie Corti, 11 rue de M=E9dicis, 75006 =
Paris.   After that the expectation is to move around France and nearby =
points until April 18.  Readings and talks during that time, as follows, =
with two or three others still to be announced:

On April 18 we will fly from Paris to Berlin and will be there until =
departure on April 25th for return to the U.S.  On April 28 and 29 I =
will be a Kelly Writers House Fellow at the University of Pennsylvania =
in Philadelphia, talk and reading to be announced.

=20

While in the States we can be reached most easily at our cell phone, =
760-415-9889, and throughout the trip the current email address =
(jrothenberg@cox.net) should be working.

=20

Hoping to see some of you along the way,

and warm best wishes,

=20

JERRY and DIANE=20

I also did only one mimeo book. It was a short story I wrote collaboratively
with Mark Laba called Africa: A Tale of Moscow. It was about 20 pages,
justified prose, in an edition of 125. The only item in the Weeping Monk
Editions imprint of my Proper Tales Press.

A couple of my things have been published in mimeo by jwcurry.

That's a really great idea. I wonder no one has thought of it before (if, in
fact, they haven't). Maybe because of the stigma of self-publishing.

From 1982 to around 1996 I published a small mag called Mondo Hunkamooga: A
Journal of Small Press Reviews. I covered a lot of self-published stuff in
there, but not exclusively.

I look forward to your review journal! (Now that you're committed to doing
it.)

Yes: a great idea, Christophe. I'll bet hundreds of interesting
self-published works appear each year,
many so 'different' that publishers balk at investing in them. A review like
the one you propose would
do a great service to a broad and largely undiscovered spectrum of creators.

 Of the many critical pieces in critiphoria - of which I only have read a few so far - I just wanted to put in a good cheer for this enterprise. Delightful work by Norman Fisher. Rachel Blau du Plessix and Nick Piombino, each variously trying to locate the position, function and capability of the 'word' - interesting to me in a time when 'we be' flush with so many words, so much of which are unmoored to anything but the agenda of some either demonic or self-serving 'other'.

 But whatever one's sense of need, Critiphoria also fills a gap by pulling together many strands of thought/analysis under the embarace of one umbrella. Tho I don't find the essays intentionally  'academic' in any "going for tenure" sense, for those of us who are counter-marginal in some larger sense, it's nice to be able to go to a broad horizon, wander around and benefit from the shade of  'multiple trees'. I suggest, go there.

It's like a small press but even smaller. I'm figuring on doing a
book every two years and a chapbook every year. I'd love to publish
you, but i want to make my biggest mistakes with my own material first.

I'd be very curious to hear what those of you who have served on academic s=
earch committees in the past *decade* where you've hired poets to real tenu=
re-track academic positions (as opposed to adjunct or multi-year contracts)=
 might have to say.
=20
How many poets have you hired who have said for themselves that the full-le=
ngth that made them eligible for the position in the first place "was a sma=
ll run that I did through Bookmobile" have been given tenure-track offers? =
or even seriously considered?
=20
This is not rhetorical.

Subject:      Starting a poetic ezine
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="windows-1250"
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

After conducting a few interviews with various poets in Canada, I've
realized that there remains a huge divide between the English and the French
poets. I live in Winnipeg, Manitoba where we have a huge French speaking
population and, yet, other than at the Winnipeg Writers Festival, I've never
heard a French poet read. Nor have I ever seen any publications by French
Manitoba poets at my local bookstores. There is a huge world of poetry of
which I am unaware. And I don't feel as if I'm alone in this regard. Then
there are the Quebecois poets from Quebec and the Acadian poets from New
Brunswick.
I'm interested in starting a poetry magazine titled 'Poetry In Translation'
which would be an attempt at remedying this situation. However, the Manitoba
Arts Council will not provide start up funding. You have to have two issues
in print before they will consider you - ostensibly so that they can tell
whether there is a demand for your product.
In order to avoid costs (other than the expense of my time), I thought that
an ezine might be the way to go. However, I know diddly about how to go
about setting up an ezine. Can anyone out there provide me with some
guidance and advice?

Ah, the mimeo, the 8-track cartridge of the poetry world!

Along with Tom savage, i was one of the last poets to use PP's mimeo machine to do my Three Work chapbook plus the last two issues of my magazine AHNOI (oddly first thre issues were done via Qwicky Print-type offset). remember going up to 42nd & 3rd to last shop in city that sold the ink & masters.

like others, i switched off to photocopying--like many who worked in offices, sneaking off copies while the bosses weren't looking. Also in mid-80d period the rise of kinko-type shops that were offering fairly photocopying, including colating, stapling, etc.

Who knew that 25 years down the road, someone would take the trouble of indexing it all

the tensions between print and the digital, if that is what you are
referring to, are of course well known. but somehow to cast both our
conversation and the  overall situation itself as a battle for ascendancy
doesn't seem quite right, Murat.

if you see our conversation as a battle for ascendancy, then that sounds,
well, rather fearful or frightful. i would rather create art, wouldn't you?

but, secondly, print is not dying and neither is the digital. one of the
interesting things i'm getting from the book called the oulipo compendium is
that the production of literature was never the primary direction of the
oulipo. they characterize it more as the creation of interesting literary
forms and, perhaps more generally, the creation of something other than
literature, the creation of approaches to the literary that synthesize
mathematics and the literary, for instance. in quite a deep way. for
instance, bourbaki is or was associated with the oulipo; bourbaki is a
collective of mathematicians who are mainly known not so much for original
mathematics as the books they wrote that present work that had already been
done but had not been related quite so closely as in their presentation and,
also, their presentation or writing style became the standard of academic
papers for a decade or more. Writing is central to Bourbaki. As is a kind of
erm well you wouldn't call it narrative, but the development from first
principles of various fields through to more complex results. So Bourbaki
was quite literary in the sense that they were intensely engaged with
language. Writing was one of their main concerns. How mathematics can be
written.

in turn, the oulipo was also most intensely engaged with language and in
relation to constraint and to mathematical structure.

here we have an example of an essentially literary endevour of synthesis and
expansion of language and the literary. it isn't out for ascendancy over
literature. it is mainly seeking departure and synthesis with other fields.
and circling back to literature, inevitably.

i think books and the literary as we have come to love and hate it do not
appear to be disappearing. i dont think they're going to. mainly because
print has real advantages in such work. in its readability, for instance.
perhaps technologists will solve that one. i suspect they will. but even
then, there will still be books, just on a different but similarly portable
and readable machine. a relatively small change.

and the digital will be quite tightly integrated with print. blah blah.
pdfs. print on demand. etc. it's already here.

but i do think that should we consider the future of new literary
experience, the digital holds vastly more interest than print. at least for
me. i think this not because computer-based literature is young, but because
computers are not simply outrageously flexible media machines, but are
almost certainly as flexible as thought itself, i.e., there is no proof, and
probably never will be, that there exist thought processes of which humans
are capable and computers are not. this implies that the future of
computer-based art is not simply that of the glorified typewriter or
glorified stereo or tv or other such media machine, but can be as flexible
and stupefyingly protean as an art object of actual thought. just as one
example of the flexibility of form and process involved in the nature of
poetential computer-based art objects.

you may find this techno-lyrical or whatever, but i say it isn't. i say it's
merely a reasonable speculation. i see a little bit of where it can go. i
understand that computers are not simply glorified media machines. the
fundamental 'building blocks' for building thought itself seem to be present
in the simple decision procedures and looping capabilities and
language-based programmability of computers. computers can make decisions.
they can change their own programming. they can make representations of
things in the world. they can form world views. they can be sentient. can be
moral agents. they may or may not be capable of being human. i would think
they'd need a human body for that. and be part of the family in that way.

but the sort of possibilities i'm mentioning are obviously not replacements
of the typically literary. they are departures and in synthesis with other
fields.

now do i think such machines should be developed? i don't know, murat. how
the hell should i know? would they pull a terminator on us? would they steal
the cash out of the drawer? bump us all off? play the records backwards?
stay out past midnight and get knocked up? i don't know.

but i do think that although there's the odd lunatic, people are mainly
motivated out of a desire to contribute in a positive and responsible way
toward the betterment of whatever circle is affected by their efforts, small
or large. so that the issue eventually becomes profoundly human, rather than
remotely speculative. and it's really only when issues become profoundly
human by virtue of their being enmeshed in the give and take of human
circumstances and society that they make the sort of sense that these issues
will have to play out in.

part of why i like novels is they seem to be better than any other art form
for really imagining such circumstances in the sort of detail/resolution
that is required for something other than remotest speculations.

Must choose what? Choose a particular medium? As opposed to an intermedial

its media????

I wasn't aware that you are familiar with "a lot" of digital work, Murat.
Interesting.

Ends nowhere. Well, often it's not like a movie or a book or things that
have fixed beginnings, middles, and ends. Sometimes they're meant to be
constructed, ie, you construct something. Sometimes they're meant to be
explored like a geography. And there are other options, of course. If works
go or end nowhere for you, perhaps some of them require you to take them
somewhere. As in you'll know when you've arrived. Or ended, such as the case
may be.

I remember playing "If a Voice Like, Then What?" (
http://tinyurl.com/2sjhh8 ), a piece by Gregory Whitehead, to a playwright.
He said it didn't go anywhere. He was looking for it to proceed in a way
that it didn't. To me, "If a Voice Like, Then What?" is a brilliant poem
that develops the notion of voice problems rather widely. It explores the
idea of voice in a subtle, broad way. As in 'finding ones voice', for
instance. And problems with notions of voice. And voice problems. Their
causes. It proceeds more like a poem than a play. It doesn't proceed like
stories often do. It's the first Whitehead piece I heard. Perhaps it is
where/when he found his voice. So for the playwright it "went nowhere".

My own work is usually interactive in the sense that you construct something
or you play it sort of like an instrument or a game or you poke it, prod it,
rotate it, write to it, at it, whatever. It's for people who want to get in
there and shake it up. It certainly isn't everybody's cup of tea. I like to
consume media with a knife and fork and chase it around the plate quite a
bit. That's how I do my most creative reading.

The Oulipo started in 1960. One could make about Oulipo the same sorts of
criticisms you're making about digital work, Murat. And Oulipo shares much
with digital writing. It's "constraint-based". And they are interested in
mathematical structures. In digital art, there are constraints that the
technology imposes. In a sense, Murat, part of the goal of digital art is to
expand the machine to human dimensions. David might say this is just the
human becoming a machine, submitting to authority, or can be, or usually is,
or isn't what I think it is, or something like that. But, in any case,
artists working in digital media feel the constraints imposed by the
technology and struggle to bend the technology to their art. They 'sing in
their chains like the sea', an old Dylan Thomas line.

They resist in some ways and try to go with the flow in others. But, you
know, it's a different type of work, as Oulipo is, in that the constraints
are not conditioned very deeply by any literary tradition. One is trying to
create art with tools that usually aren't made for that purpose. One is
trying to create work with human resonance and relevance in an environment
that is often headed in different directions, as David points out. Part of
the value of that is in giving people a sense of what it actually means for
software and stuff on computers to be more humanly meaningful. If
technologies are extensions of our humanity, our bodies, or our cognitive
capacities, and so forth, then at first there isn't much blood coursing
through them. But computers are going to continue to be used in an expanding
number of situations whether one likes it or not, Murat. We need to be able
to approach them with all the humanity that has accrued to our ventures in
print. Print is conditioned by centuries of humanity. Its traditions. Its
forms. Its emotional and psychological depths. Its profound poetics. Its
poetry. And that informs what it means to write a book, say. What does it
mean to create a literary web site? Inquiring minds need to know.

If the work lacks the things you value in art, Murat, well, it isn't your
cup of tea. Personally, the challenge and promise of it--as well as some of
the work itself--to me is bracing. In a day, I'm faced with all sorts of
different types of challenges from artistic, architectural, mathematical,
critical, philosophical, and other perspectives. As artist and critic and
correspondent yadayada. It allows me to try to put together all my interests
and abilities.

And I get to write emails to my affectionate friends Murat and David.

No, that's not what I mean, Murat. An example to illustrate my meaning. For
a long time, the technology of print was such that it was exceptional that a
publisher could deal with graphics and color. So the idea of books being
without graphics and color became commonplace and accepted. The distinction,
however, was more determined by the available technologies than anything
inherant in the art of writing or bookmaking.

So what I'm saying is that intermedial approaches to literature have been in
the margins, at the edges, mainly because literary technologies--by no
intention, just by the nature of the technologies--have been more suited to
a mono-media approach.

Sorry, Murat. I don't understand.

"the brine of the binary", by the way, is the digital soup, the digital sea.

Agreed. Though I suppose it depends on what is resisted, and how. Not simply

I don't think it's a red herring, Murat. I think there's a lot of fear about
all sorts of things associated with computers. We see this reflected in a
million ways from movies like The Terminator (though that also has 'good
machines' and 'bad machines') to the popular strength of the desire to
believe that there are published valid proofs that there exist thought
processes of which humans are capable and computers are not. I can remember
when I first started using a computer there was subtle though real fear for
me. We fear what we do not understand, often. Or what is beyond our control.
To 'rage against the machine' is sometimes interpreted quite broadly as not
a specific machine but the whole control structure of contemporary society.

Concerning digital art, I get reactions from people that come from the
houses of fear quite a bit, it seems to me. People who usually don't know
much digital art but are eager to denigrate it as having any number of fatal
flaws that doom it to not be taken seriously. Yes, yes. It's all true. I am
wasting my life. What can I say? Two lumps please.

I don't recall saying that language is a machine or language is like a
machine, Murat.

But one can say quite a bit about the relation of language to machines, and
language to people, and people to machines.

Computers are language machines, for instance. That means that, as opposed
to analog machines, where there are basically cogs and wheels, computers
behave according to their instructions that are programmed, and the programs
are written in language. Hence they are language machines.

What distinguishes computers from other machines is, fundamentally,
programmability. That is what gives computers their flexibility as machines.
And programmability owes its flexibility to language. Software has no
'moving parts'. To modify the machine, you change the programming, the
writing. The moving parts of software, the engines, are made of language,
and language is much more easily modified than parts of a physical machine.

Murat, are you aware that in the above paragraph you seem to imply that I am
an advocate of "the all-efficacy of constant technological transformation"?
Whatever that means. Doesn't that come from fear, Murat?

Personally, I think we are doomed to walk together forever, Murat. The
houses of the literary all in tense but relevant and enduring relation.

Hello everyone,

Evan Munday from Coach House Books here: http://www.chbooks.com.

This April, one of our new poets, Jordan Scott (Silt, Blert) will be =20
visiting Oregon and Seattle with fellow poets Donato Mancini (Aethel) =20=

and Stephen Collis (The Commons).

Jordan Scott's Blert is a book that investigates the 'poetics of =20
stutter'. Jordan Scott=92s language jams sounds together and juxtaposes =20=

disparate vocabularies in order to mimic the stutter.

Craig Dworkin in the PMLA says, =91Jordan Scott's Blert is the most =20
original poetic project I have read in years. Undertaking a =93poetics =20=

of stutter,=94 the book is not primarily a mimetic representation of =20
stuttering, or the reproduction of stammered speech, but rather an =20
investigation into how the stutter originates.=92

This trio of poets have reading in Portland on April 20 and 21st, and =20=

will be in Washington on April 18, 19 and 22. We're having some =20

About Blert:

The bright, taut, explosive poems in Jordan Scott=92s Blert represent a =20=

spelunk into the mouth of the stutterer. Through the unique symptoms =20
of the stutterer (Scott, like fifty million others, has always =20
stuttered), language becomes a rolling gait of words hidden within =20
words, leading to different rhythms and textures, all addressed by =20
the mouth=92s slight erosions.
	In Scott=92s lexicon, to blert is to stutter, to disturb the =
breath of =20
speaking. The stutter quivers in all that we do, from a skip on a cd =20
to a slip of the tongue. These experiences are often dismissed as =20
aberrant, but in Blert, such fragmented milliseconds are embraced and =20=

mined as language. Often aimed full-bore at words that are especially =20=

difficult for the stutterer, Scott=92s poems don=92t just discuss, they =20=

replicate the act of stuttering, the =91blort, jam and rejoice=92 =20
involved in grappling with the granular texture of words.

Originally from Coquitlam, British Columbia, Jordan Scott now lives =20
and works in Toronto. Jordan=92s first book of poetry, Silt, was =20
nominated for the Dorothy Livesay Poetry Prize. Sections of Blert =20
have appeared in filling Station, drunken boat, and nypoesi. In the =20
fall of 2006, Jordan worked on the final sections of Blert while =20
acting as the writer in residence at the International Writers=92 and =20=

Translators=92 Centre in Rhodes, Greece.=

Hi everyone:  In reponse to John Cunningham's original question (and
pardon me if this issue's been been raised already):  questions of
legitmacy change depending on context and function.  If the function of
a book of poems is to represent its author's vision and please its
readers, then it shouldn't matter how it's published.  If purpose and
function also include, though, things like (cough) tenure review, then
how it's published will matter very much. =20

Joseph Harrington has an interesting essay about how the process of
evaluating poetry has become an increasingly sticky-wicket:
http://www.questia.com/googleScholar.qst;jsessionid=3DHxNWlsgQTq3sp26kbp4=
m
rFwbHQTgTp3JwZ28xxb1lL6gg8XL5dZG!1143229533?docId=3D98942209 and there =
it
is, if you're interested.

I'm curious, though, if one's confident about the merits of the work and
ready to defend them, why "lie through the teeth" as JQ said below.
Isn't this an inconsistency?  If the "peer-review" process of submitting
one's work and aligning it with so-called established conventions is
rubbish, why even pretend to be part of it?  Either that, or how about
establish a new set of conventions, proclaim them, and uphold them with
one's own press? =20

 Doesn't it sound good, Maria, & shouldn't that be enough!!??
 Without driving myself into some kind of hole - or missing some interesting unconscious intention on my part - I suspect it's a turn on Bob Perleman's "writing at the margins." I think (optimistically) the space within those particular margins has moved/exploded into a much larger space. Which is to say, my editorial sense of Critoporhia is to open up the horizon, radials, etc. to permit (or include) a wider range of possibilites, views. On first look, this range looks both intelligent and counter-claustrophobic(!).  An educational breath of fresh air, particularly, I suspect, for those who live and make work outside institutional (often 'marginal') horizons.

 What did you think I meant?

Hi Tim,

Didn't mean to imply there was anything inherently funky about playing a
role. Just wanted to post some thoughts about that issue.

Was I on that proposed panel? If there was a panel with you and kari
edwards and Stacy Szymaszek, and if it was about gender and was
rejected, you bet I was disappointed!

Gabe
<<
Thanks for this, Gabe. This is an interesting comment and I think I
agree with much of it, but I wonder about this notion of "playing a
role" and how that's seen to be inherently a bad thing? Which of us is
not playing a role at this point?

Speaking of gender and sex issues, I was wondering if you might have any
idea why our panel on gender with kari edwards and Stacy Szymaszek in
2007 was suddenly cancelled from AWP that year and replaced with "the
poetry of magnificence" or some ridiculous thing? You were on that panel
too -- I imagine you must have been disappointed that happened.

Best, Tim

*  *  *

JP,

Part of the issue appears to be you think I wrote something I didn't
write. Your paraphrase of me is incorrect. (As is, incidentally, the
quotation Mark Weiss attributes to me).

You say I "wrote that novelty is a purely masculine gesture."

I did not write that.

Here are a few things I said that I think you might be referring to.

- "My post is in part precisely about the so-called masculine dynamics
around the fetish of the /new/, a set of dynamics which work to
'disappear' women from a variety of literary scenes."

- "Given the relatively few number of women there are *to* mention in a
vast field of men, even (and some might argue) especially in the AG
fields, I think it might not be very untoward to suggest that the 'new'
is an instrument that functions in part to police the feminine."

- "I would only repeat again that within the AG fields (fields that
especially fetishize the new) there seems to be a *worse* track record
regarding women."

- "And if one tries to yoke the fetish of the /new/ as something
operating with peculiarly strong masculine dynamics, well, watch out."

None of those quotes displays a risky or even shocking reading of
homosociality in the literary field. If you think so, okay. I'm not
going to debate these points. It's like debating if the sky is composed
of air and jets.

I'm not sure where you're going with your quotations from /Pink Guitar/.
If I were to point to a section of the book that clearly shows the
concerns DuPlessis has about the structural issues of gender in the
literary field across the decades, I'd suggest the section entitled,
"Feminist Poetics, Modernism, and the Avant Garde." (Maybe I'll post
some to my blog, for good measure).

If you wanted a very strong exhaustive study of homosociality in the AG,
Michael Davidson's /Guys Like Us: Citing Masculinity in Cold War
Poetics/ (focusing mostly on '50s and '60s).

Thanks for your polite posts. They're the only kind I reply to.

Gabriel

<<Gabriel,
I'd ask you for a little more patience with me. Please don't assume
that because I'm questioning your formulation that I'm willing to
elide "the truth" of your claims. I asked for clarification of your
claims through discussion of representative figures. I intend no
hostility, as you note. I'm not willing to concede you're right
either, as I see this issue a bit differently. I think.

Since discussing particular artists' work--I didn't ask to discuss
bios--won't work for you, I'll take you up at The Pink Guitar. It's
just this sort of work that I'm coming from.

One think that I see going on in this book is that DuPlessis is
teasing out the problem of the new and hegemony. She seems to praise
The Golden Notebook for its attempts to enact an "anti-authoritarian
ethics" at the "level of structure" and says that we call such
efforts "new." And she adds that "new" has "signaled antithesis to
dominant values."

I asked you about Howe in particulate because she's an interesting
case when you're dealing with novelty and gendered power. As
DuPlessis notes, Howe "works in issues of transcendence" and
"impossible political privilege." I really like DuPlessis's
suggestion that the question of how to write is a question of how to
"gather authority without authoritarian power." Howe often brings the
old into a new light and new structure; she refuses, as DuPlessis
puts it, to be belated.

I'm concerned that we proceed very carefully on this, me and the
mouse in my pocket, I suppose, because I don't want to dis-able any
woman or feminized, marginal person trying to find a way to work, to
"gather authority without authoritarian power."

DuPlessis later says in the chapter/essay on Howe: "The female use of
this 'feminine' of marginality and the avant garde use of this
'feminine' of marginality are mutually reinforcing in the work of
some contemporary women: Lyn Hejinian, Kathleen Fraser, Beverly
Dahlen and Howe. This mixed allegiance will naturally call into
question varieties of flat-footed feminism."

So that's very much where I'm coming from when I asked you about
cases when you wrote that novelty is a purely masculine gesture, that
claiming to possess some truth is a purely masculine attempt to
market oneself as Moses from the Mountain with the Tablets(tm). It
seems more complicated than that to me. And theories often grow more
fuzzy at the edges when you apply them to cases.

Respectfully, JP.

To the Ad Hoc Committee to Defend the University & Friends:

The petition for academic freedom that you signed and supported- and the
names of all 585 signatories- will appear as a full page ad in the current
issue  (February 15th) of the Chronicle of Higher Education.   As you know
we had hoped to run the petition in the New York Times, but we were unable
to amass the amount of money necessary to publish there.   Our hope is that
the publication of the petition will provoke some wider media attention to
the current threats to academic freedom, and to that end we circulated a
press release earlier today.

We are tremendously grateful for your support, and hope you will keep us
informed so that we can maintain the web site and our links to additional
information and resources related to academic freedom.   We thank you for
joining us.

A copy of the Chronicle ad is attached here as a PDF, and the press release
that went out today follows:
*

Some 585 academics and others have joined the Ad Hoc Committee to Defend the
University, a group established to affirm the principles of academic freedom
on campuses across the country.  Their statement, which appears in the
February 15 issue of the Chronicle of Higher Education, calls upon
administrators, students, and colleagues to speak out against political
interference in scholarly life "even if it means incurring the displeasure
of non-scholarly groups, the media among them."  It especially targets those
who would silence critics of U.S. and Israeli policy in the Middle East with
charges of disloyalty, support of terrorism, and anti-Semitism.
 The group has established a web site:
http://defend.university.googlepages.com on which appear the names of those
who have signed on as well as links to articles about attempts to suppress
academic expression.  Its organizers are Joan Scott, of the Institute for
Advanced Study; Jeremy Adelman, Princeton University; Edmund Burke III,
University of California, Santa Cruz; Steven Caton, Harvard University; and
Jonathan Cole, Columbia University.  *

Elizabeth,

A nice bit of simplistic dualism on your behalf, but why heap all the
responsibility on Emily Dickinson's shoulders when she is no longer around
to justify her position? A choice of either either Zen or Emily is a bit of
a big call to make, especially as I prefer the bleak nihilism found in the
'confessional' poetry of say Ann Sexton or John Berryman - or do I detect a
less than subtle application of facetiousness in your reply?  But surely you
can muster up more that sixteen words in response to this message - there
must be a lot of mileage here!

Very good response, Joanie. However, the one overlooked area of
self-publishing is the ability to obtain arts grants. For example, the
Manitoba Arts Council does not consider self-published material as fair game
on which to base a grant application. This may be critical to the poet's
ability to write.

Hi everyone:  In reponse to John Cunningham's original question (and pardon
me if this issue's been been raised already):  questions of legitmacy change
depending on context and function.  If the function of a book of poems is to
represent its author's vision and please its readers, then it shouldn't
matter how it's published.  If purpose and function also include, though,
things like (cough) tenure review, then how it's published will matter very
much.

Joseph Harrington has an interesting essay about how the process of
evaluating poetry has become an increasingly sticky-wicket:
http://www.questia.com/googleScholar.qst;jsessionid=HxNWlsgQTq3sp26kbp4m
rFwbHQTgTp3JwZ28xxb1lL6gg8XL5dZG!1143229533?docId=98942209 and there it is,
if you're interested.

I'm curious, though, if one's confident about the merits of the work and
ready to defend them, why "lie through the teeth" as JQ said below.
Isn't this an inconsistency?  If the "peer-review" process of submitting
one's work and aligning it with so-called established conventions is
rubbish, why even pretend to be part of it?  Either that, or how about
establish a new set of conventions, proclaim them, and uphold them with
one's own press?

what's important is to get the work out there
i've had 4 chapbooks  that i designed / made collage for just sitting
with small small-time publishers  for months
and others have only put out 30-50 copies even with nice designs and
saving the works integrity this is too little
one of the kids that keeps me waiting says  last thing i sent him after 2
yrs was too difficult, after 2 yrs !
now the ms is 4 yrs old and the second guy is procrastinatin so if i
published it myself
when the urge and need were there and folks wanted to buy it voila
it would have looked pretty much the same one way or the other since i
was given free reign
now "difficult kid" says my new ms, which is ready to go and which he's
had for almost a year
 after i said , to help him, that he can do it in b and w to save money,
that it exceeds 32 pages and he wants to cut it down or do it in 2
volumes
HA crazy 2 volumes of 20 pages each!
it extended from 32 pages to 40
rediculous i told him politely but received no answer
i also told him that at this point i'd help him finance the little 300
copies
if need be just to get it to see the light of day
even sent him all left column poems for the most part to make it easy on
his brain
what can i say sometimes only ego stops us from self-publishing
he ain't got no isbn anyway or distribution and i can sell 100 on my own
in a coupla months
so actually why do i need him...???  self publishing can work and works
well
 especially for chaps no hassles  do the math

Hi John and all,

When a friend of mine and I started Boog Literature in 1991, we did what
many small press publishers have done, ferlinghetti among them, publish our
own work as the first offering. (in our case a 24-page micromini
flip-chapbook with one of us on each side released that august.) That was
the last time Boog published a book by one of its editors. And now, with our
newspaper Boog City, we don't publish work by our poetry editor(s).

In 2000 I wanted to gift some friends of mine a poem i'd written, so I put
together a small 12-page chapbook, and picked a press name, Euclid Avenue,
in honor of d.a. levy and the Cleveland Street he traversed. The goal was
that anytime I wanted to get work of mine out to folks I could do it at home
with my high-end laser printer, stanley bostitch long-arm stapler, and bone
folder, do it on plain white paper and either give it away to friends or
charge a buck or two. Sortly thereafter I'd rename the press 213 Euclid
Avenue, the 213 to honor Henry Rollins' press 2.13.61 and his publishing of
his own work, and my mom, also born on 2.13.

And for the last six years anytime I've done a featured reading I've put
together a chapbook of all the work I'm reading for the slot in the order
I'm reading it. That was originally for the ease of having all the work
together to read, and, after the first time, because I saw that people who
enjoyed the reading or a specific poem or poems bought the chap because
they'd have all the pieces right there in one place.

To me it's always been about getting the word out, be it my own or others.
That said, I've never been a fan of poets who publish their own poems in
their pubs after the first issue, hence my separate vanity press.

Best,
David

It seems you have hit upon a niche that it's worth taking a go at.

I think it will need some kind of frame for credibility--e.g. so I don't
have my mother send in the review and say I'm the next Whitman, maybe you
assign reviews.  Maybe each review includes a sample poem. I don't know.
Something to think about.

Joseph Harrington has an interesting essay about how the process of
evaluating poetry has become an increasingly sticky-wicket:

Self-publishing is ok, but I think it's best and most honorably done

jwcurry is still at it. He has a working Gestetner and a pretty good supply
of ink and stencils, so far as I know.

A few years ago, he set up a printing room in the hospitality suite of the
Ottawa International Writers Festival and invited writers to come in, type
up a sheet, and he spent all night hand-cranking the suckers out. He made a
gorgeous big book of the contributions.

Hi Hugh-- here's another link:

Perhaps it will work better.
And the article is: "Why American Poetry is not American Literature," by

Elizabeth,

Thank you for the bonus of 32 words in your reply, a 200% increase!  Thanks
also for the poesy which crept into your words with your reference to Earth
and sky.  The world is of course driven by preferences and the fact that we
all have different temperaments and aspirations means that the human
ingredient of our world is infinitely diverse and let's be thankful for
that.  The fact of this rich diversity challenges the writer, of course, and
the words which stitch together our experiences of the world and our
communication of those experiences color not only our relationships but our
ability to inspire others through our sharing of those experiences.  Words
are ephemeral but illustrate our preferences, briefly exposing our patterns
of thought and qualities of soul hopefully with the beauty of one of those
starburst fireworks whose pyrotechnics are brief but whose afterimage
lingers on first optically and then in our memories to have an impact that
is in inverse proportion to the brevity of its illumination. Our enigmatic
relationship to words is beautifully addressed by the poetry of the English
poet W.S.Graham particularly in his book, 'Malcolm Mooney's Land' but his
Collected Poems are also worth looking at. Thanks for the conversation.

Roy Exley.

Note that you might both "fall in" and out of traditional publishing.
Not only do unrecognized self-published poets eventually get
published by established publishing houses. Some who are "in" also
choose to leave their publisher and publish themselves. And some
poets and writers get rejected after their first or second book has
been published. Publishers mostly try to build longer relationships
with poets/writers but this does not always work, and there can be
many reasons for that; the actual quality of the work or the state of
the market. The distinction between those who self-publish and those
published by publishing houses is not always crystal clear.

perilous issues and dwell there, exploring the complications. SHOOT AND =
WEEP

our brain as we do this thinking."  -Juliana Spahr

Every poetry blog out there has an rss feed,  I have about 20 of them
in my rss reader..  if you have any interest in visual poetry I
highly recommend Geof Huth's blog which is extensive & very attentive...

I use netvibes.com for my aggregator, it just installs as a homepage

Subject:      Anthology of poetry in support of jailed Burmese poet Saw Wai,
              now live at ANTI-
MIME-Version: 1.0

Hello everyone,

In case you've not yet heard: on January 22, 2008, in the country of
Myanmar, a man named Saw Wai was jailed for writing a poem.  The
eight-line poem, "February 14," had been published the previous day in
the popular Burmese weekly A Chit (or The Love Journal), and is about
a man who learns the true meaning of love when his heart is broken by
a fashion model.  Because "February 14" looks the part of a saccharine
Valentine, Burmese government censors missed its hidden message: when
read top-to-bottom, the first word of each line forms the phrase,
"Power Crazy Senior General Than Shwe."

Senior General Than Shwe leads the military junta that has ruled
Myanmar for almost twenty years.  After seizing control of the Burmese
government in 1988, the junta refused to relinquish power in 1990,
when a democratic political party led by Nobel Peace Prize laureate
Aung San Suu Kyi won a popular election by an enormous margin.  Suu
Kyi has been in a Burmese prison for twelve of the past eighteen
years; Than Shwe has been the country's dictator for the past fifteen.
 Saw Wai has been in prison, unable to see his family, for almost
three weeks.

Than Shwe's junta has long detained critics and dissidents for
indefinite periods of time.  But their methods do not stop at
imprisonment.  There are many accounts, some first-hand, of jailed
dissidents being tortured while imprisoned.  And in September, 2007,
Than Shwe's troops opened fire on a peaceful, pro-democracy
demonstration and killed more than thirty people, including several
Buddhist monks who were leading the protests.  It is unclear what will
happen to Saw Wai, but with each day he spends in prison, it becomes
clearer that his message is true.

In response to Saw Wai's situation, I have edited a small, twelve-poet
anthology of poems that each contain the phrase, "Power Crazy Senior
General Than Shwe," in a manner that remains faithful to Saw Wai's
poem.  (The phrase is also the chapbook's title.)  The anthology has
been published in the online literary journal ANTI-
(http://anti-poetry.com/chapbook1/), and may be freely downloaded and
distributed.  As the editor of ANTI-, Steven D. Schroeder, has
written, "[this project] takes advantage of the fast turnaround time
and unique presentation possibilities of the online format, and...
stands against something that's clearly important and worth fighting."
 Participating poets have remarkably different backgrounds, and hail
from California, Indiana, Michigan, New York, Oregon, Virginia,
Washington, and elsewhere; one poet has never before been published,
while another has won the National Book Award (Phillippines) five
times.

What unites these poets is the desire to speak and act against
injustice.  And sociable web media have allowed this to happen.  I
first heard about Saw Wai's jailing via another poet's blog, on
January 24th; I immediately wrote and posted a poem-response on my
blog, and began soliciting other bloggers I knew to do the same; I
also contacted the editor of ANTI-, who had previously published my
work in another venue, and proposed that I guest edit a small,
chapbook-sized collection of such poetry.  Via e-mail, listservs,
blogs, and the like, the project was developed from conception to
completion and publication in sixteen days.  The speed of this
realization was essential to the project, for as I write this Saw Wai
is sitting in a jail cell in Myanmar.  And this project is first and
foremost concerned with raising awareness of that fact.

With this in mind, I invite you to read and freely distribute the
chapbook.  Share it in any way you see fit.  The sociable web carries
with it the potential to speak across and through boundaries of all
kinds, and though it remains to be seen whether our voices can
penetrate the walls of Saw Wai's jail cell, we can at least allow Saw
Wai's voice to break through them, by speaking through us.

Thanks very much,
A. J. Patrick Liszkiewicz

house: a (tiny) memoir (a work-in-progress);

lately I've been posting these little early 1970s prose memoir bits
about Glengarry County & the farm on my blog (with photos of the same); the
list of what's up so far is here:

http://robmclennansindex.blogspot.com/2008/02/house-tiny-memoir.html

because I'm west, I'm slowly running out of photos, but hope to get more
when I'm in Ottawa in April, maybe farm soon after that; who knows, I may
even get a book out of it...?

Hi, everyone,

in the last few days I have received strong and enthusiastic feedback from =
a number of group members. I want to briefly express my thanks and gratitud=
e for giving small, private ventures some legitimacy. Now I'm pressed (lite=
rally) to begin from the bottom:=20

In the next few weeks I'll be putting out calls for independently published=
 projects. And it doesn't have to be books, mind you, but any "object" that=
 was produced to be sold/distributed/marketed.

Please send me an eMail if you would like to do the following:

1. suggest titles or individuals who I may contact
2. send me materials you've published yourself that you want reviewed
3. volunteer to review any number of materials that you see as an important=
 contribution to the DIY ethic

my contact info is below

friends,

there is much to see at the Meshworks archive these days.  we have
readings up from Rae Armantrout and Trevor Joyce.  we have Catherine
Walsh, Geoffrey Squires, and Michael Smith from SoundEye 2007.  there
is video art work to complement/supplement readings: Justin Katko's
"Aubade", Sean Bonney's "mysteries of hackney" trilogy, "not your
father's depression" by Keith Tuma & myself, as well as a copy of Tom
Raworth's work-in-progress, _Hands_.  do enjoy all of this along with
the popular "Song 4 Poo" by cris cheek.

in the not too distant future, we'll have selected readings from the
Diversity in African American Poetry Festival in 2003, as well as Kate
Fagan and Peter Manson at SoundEye.

Vollmann has done fabulous raw and complex writing - I got hooked with the
(alas unfinished) Seven Dream series,
though I haven't liked as well the long books he's done since he stopped
trying to finish that novel series.
Certainly Whores for Gloria and Butterfly Stories and some of 13 Stories and
13 Epitaphs are intensely
effective short works in abjection, longing, the eviscerating world.
I often think of him in the same vein as Kathy Acker: the exposed self in
the exposed world:
to paraphrase Acker: 'nowadays I can write any way I want, because nobody
gives a shit about writing and ideas;
all anyone cares about is money.' Vollmann has a grip on the kinds of
brutally creative, totally smart,
literarily attuned (even as defiant), world-and-flesh-devouring broken
writing that motivated Acker, I think.
A happy find.
Lisa

and Macular Hole, and co-editor of Not for Mothers Only: Contemporary
Poems on Child-Getting and Child-Rearing (all from Fence Books). She

Hilarious article. My main man, Harold, calls Jimmy Carter the worst poet in the United States. Poor Jimmy. Maybe he'll stop writing that drek someday.

I agree: Vollmann's talents are as prolific as his subject matter is raw,
yet elegantly rendered.  My personal favorite is *The Atlas*, which consists
of twenty-six matched pairs of stories (many of which are comprised of
various journalistic fragments and Kawabata-esque reductions of his other
novels, originating from scattered geographic locations) which come before
and after the keystone story (practically a novella), "The Atlas" -- all of
this framed by chapters titled "Opening the Book" and "Closing the Book."
It's perhaps the finest example of Vollmann's use of structuring conceits to
spur his creative output, though *The Rainbow Stories*, which writes to the
colors of the visible spectrum, and *13 Stories and 13 Epitaphs* work
similarly.

In regards to his tremendous output: I asked him about this when he did a
reading in Philadelphia a few years back, wondering how one can manage to be
so engaged in the world, and simultaneously find time to step away from it
long enough to write about it.  Apparently, his strength is a sound and
rigorous daily writing habit.  As he explained (I paraphrase here), "I'll
have folks over at my house, have a nice meal, enjoy our conversation, but
there comes a point where I say, 'you're welcome to stay and make yourselves
at home, drink my liquor and so forth, but I'm going upstairs to write.'"
This seems to have long been his practice, since legend has him sleeping
under his desk at work while writing *An Afghanistan Picture Show* in the
mid-80s (spending his evenings composing the book on the office's
computers), and even more incredibly, he writes everything longhand since
his obsessive typing eventually led to serious carpel-tunnel syndrome.

I also agree that a little more judicious editing might be in order.
Sometime, the sheer scale of his works can be off-putting, and though, about
five years ago, I was a fervent reader of his work, I can't bring myself to
read any of the newer books.  Moreover, I've always preferred the more
contemporary/reportage works (including the aforementioned, plus *Butterfly
Stories* and *Whores for Gloria*) to the historical fables.

Subject:      ezra pound as asshole - literature as abomination
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=windows-1252; format=flowed

Yesterday -- February 13 -- I received notice from the MLA publications
committee that it is putting out another volume on Pound. The email from
MLA included a link to a survey -- asking the respondent how to teach Pound.

I didn't even bother filling out the survey, because I teach Pound as an
abomination, as the canonizing of hatred, as a case study of the power
of consecration dynamics. In short, I teach Pound's very canonicity as
an indictment of literature itself as a project of power. (The name of
the proposed volume and its editor, as well as a link to the site, are
at the bottom of this post).

Also yesterday -- in 1946 -- February 13 -- Ezra Loomis Pound, who
advocated killing "big kikes" in a "pogrom from the top" and said "it
might be a good thing to hang Roosevelt and a few hundred yidds," was
declared insane by a jury and sentenced to reside in St. Elizabeths
Hospital.

Two years later he would be awarded the first annual Bollingen Prize, on
whose ten person panel T S Eliot served, who said of himself, "I have no
objection to being called a bigot myself."

The jury made this statement: "The fellows are aware that objections may
be made to awarding a prize to a man situated as is Mr. Pound.... To
permit other considerations than that of poetic achievement to sway the
decision would destroy the significance of the award and would in
principle deny the validity of that objective perception of value on
which civilized society must rest." (quote from Sieburth's fulsome intro
to /The Pisan Cantos/)

Jed Rasula writes, "What was crucial was the preservation of the
administrative security system that had assumed custodial control of
poetry (not just Pound's poetry)...." (APWM, 114)

I call Sieburth's introduction to /The Pisan Cantos/ "fulsome" because
of his elision and effacement of Pound's racism: the rhetoric of
Sieburth's intro to /The Pisan Cantos/ is unconscionably apologetic
about Pound's racism (toward both African-Americans and Jews, and the
intro basically COMPLETELY elides the horror of Pound's anti-semitism
and his anti-Slavism to boot).

The furthest Sieburth goes in his introduction is to say Pound had
"conflicted attitudes to race" and that he is "insouciantly
condescending" in his use of racial hate speech and that Pound's views
"might have been" "paternalistic." That's just from one page -- xxi --
of Sieburth's intro. Sieburth's introduction on the point of race does
not even mention Pound's advocating systematic pograms.

Please note: This post is not critical of Rasula. The valence of my post
is this: It states a beef with Sieburth and the culture industry that
has canonized a writer like Pound -- doing so essentially via the same
legitimations outlined in the statement I quote from the Bollingen Prize
committee -- a statement now 52 years old.

Rasula is quoted here not to be critical of Rasula but to underscore (a)
what the Bollingen Prize committee's statement was really about (control
of the dynamics of consecration at the cost of effacing Pound as a poet
of hatred), and (b) that essentially Pound's continued canonicity is not
about Pound per se (because Pound = Anti-Semitism, Pound = Hate) but
about the exercise of consecration itself.

If Pound's canonicity tells us anything, it's that consecration's object
is clearly irrelevant.

Pound is now a "high capital" object against which to exercise the
muscles of consecration -- which is precisely what Sieburth does in his
introduction. And that is probably precisely what this new book will do.

I wonder if anyone has any advice on where to get information or guidance
on negotiating the purchase of personal papers with university libraries?
I'm trying to help out a well-known, widely published poet who has about
sixty years worth of papers, drafts, correspondence, artwork, etc.
archived but has no idea how to go about organizing the materials,
contacting libraries, or negotiating the sales (not to mention reasonable
rates for this sort of thing). Neither do I. The poet is not affiliated
with a university. Are there people who broker this sort of thing? Any
guidance or suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks,
Brian

Vollmann/Acker. I can see that. Great writers, poets, are noted for their excess. Think of Faulkner. Or Pound. John Berryman. Joyce or Samuel Beckett. Vollmann, I think, is in the big leagues. He's the anti Updike. No suburban comedy of manners for Mr. W V.

Lisa Samuels <lisa.samuels@GMAIL.COM> wrote: Vollmann has done fabulous raw and complex writing - I got hooked with the
(alas unfinished) Seven Dream series,
though I haven't liked as well the long books he's done since he stopped
trying to finish that novel series.
Certainly Whores for Gloria and Butterfly Stories and some of 13 Stories and
13 Epitaphs are intensely
effective short works in abjection, longing, the eviscerating world.
I often think of him in the same vein as Kathy Acker: the exposed self in
the exposed world:
to paraphrase Acker: 'nowadays I can write any way I want, because nobody
gives a shit about writing and ideas;
all anyone cares about is money.' Vollmann has a grip on the kinds of
brutally creative, totally smart,
literarily attuned (even as defiant), world-and-flesh-devouring broken
writing that motivated Acker, I think.
A happy find.

dear U.B. Poetics,

I have a D.I.Y. publishing question & thought this might be an appropriate forum to ask for advice.

I'm looking for some 8.5" x 11" paper which can be run through a standard copy machine.  I'd like it to be of higher quality than your run-of-the-mill copy paper but cheaper than "artist quality" inkjet paper (which appears to be manufactured mostly for art prints rather than poetry, anyway...)

Has anyone had experience with different kinds of paper?  Any recommendations and all advice welcome.  Feel free to send e-mail to david@badnoiseproductions.com as this topic may not be of interest to everyone...

Thanks in advance,

David Applegate

Hi Everyone,

We have three great events planned for next week. Maybe we=B9ll see you here?


Monday, February 18, 8 PM
Erik Anderson & Selah Saterstrom


Erik Anderson=B9s poems and reviews have appeared or are forthcoming in
American Letters & Commentary, Sleeping Fish, Jacket, Rain Taxi, Marginalia=
,
CAB/NET, The Poetry Project Newsletter, Cranky, Bombay Gin, and others. A
contributing poetry editor at the Denver Quarterly, he also edits, with Ann=
e
Waldman, the mail-art magazine Thuggery & Grace. He is a graduate of the
Jack Kerouac School at Naropa University and is currently a PhD candidate a=
t
the University of Denver. An excerpt from his land-art project, The Poetics
of Trespass, is available at parceljournal.org. Selah Saterstrom is the
author of The Meat and Spirit Plan and The Pink Institution [both published
by Coffee House Press]. Her work can be found in Bombay Gin, Not Enough
Night, Tarpaulin Sky, and other places. She co-curates SLAB PROJECTS, an
artist/writer-curator initiative concerned with exploring the gaps between
decay and reconstruction in ruined or abandoned landscapes. She teaches in
the creative writing program at the University of Denver and in the Naropa
Summer Writing Program.

Wednesday, February 20, 8 PM
Alison Knowles & Jerome Rothenberg

In the sixties Alison Knowles created Notations, a book with John Cage, and
Coeurs Volants with Marcel Duchamp, both produced with the Something Else
Press. With Fluxus she made The Bean Rolls, a canned book that appeared in
the Whitney's "The American Century" (2000). The Big Book (1967) followed, =
a
walk-in book with 8-foot pages, as well as The House of Dust. This was the
first computerized poetry on record, winning her a Guggenheim fellowship. I=
n
2001, she performed and exhibited her new paper / sound works at the Drawin=
g
Center in New York. She will perform Giant Bean Turner, which combines two
of her favorite materials (beans and flax paper), at the Guggenheim in 2009=
.
She will be performing with Joshua Selman and Jessica Higgins. Poet,
translator, anthologist and founding figure of ethnopoetics. Jerome
Rothenberg is the author of over seventy books of poetry including Poems fo=
r
the Game of Silence, A Seneca Journal, That Dada Strain, A Paradise of Poet=
s
and Pref-faces & Other Writings. New Directions has recently published
Triptych which presents his three long series poems in one volume:
Poland/1931, Khurbn, and The Burning Babe. Describing his poetry career as
"an ongoing attempt to reinterpret the poetic past from the point of view o=
f
the present," he has edited seven major assemblages of traditional and
contemporary poetry and four important poetry magazines. Rothenberg has bee=
n
the recipient of many honors, including an American Book Award, two PEN
Oakland Josephine Miles Literary Awards, and two PEN Center USA West
Translation Awards. In 2001 he was elected to the World Academy of Poetry
(UNESCO).

Before I launch into my own research for a publisher, I thought I would ask y'all.

  I have an English translation of a very contemporary German poet's ninth book.  It's a language driven collection with elements of form and meter.

  Could anybody recommend a US publisher?

  Othewise, I will consult ALTA and Writer's Market.

  Thank you.

he signed "Europe Central" for me and drew a cool cartoon. During the Q & A period, I asked him if he'd ever settle down in suburbia and write witty, domestic novels of manners. He said no. I got a few laughs, but really, I couldn't frame my more serious question, couldn't be concise, so I ended up being myself, a wise ass. Vollman didn't mind.

Subject:      WHAT IS A WORD / Kocik under Wall Street / THE PERINEUM /

BUILDING A PERINEUM

The Lower Manhattan Cultural Council has granted us (Daria Fain and
Robert Kocik) a workspace in which to continue our prosodic research.

We will be using the space to design a building based on prosody.
Some aspects of this residency will be public. For example, we=B9ve
built a rudimentary anechoic darkroom.  From 2/13 to 2/24, anyone can
reserve time in this room. Suggested uses include: darkroom retreat,
tracing the origins of language, wakeful hibernation, hypometabolic
attention, swinging open the door of life and death. I call the
darkroom a 'perineum' not only because it has been built in a
basement bank vault=8Bbut because the perineum (in the subtle body) is
the still point and the point of entry for words, and thus the basis
of a building based on prosody.

Tuesday February 12: we are having an opening from 6pm-8pm. We will
be on hand to speak about darkroom, perineal practice and prosodic
architecture.

Sunday, February 17: I will discuss WHAT IS A WORD--the 4 stages of
speech and the cosmogony of phonemic emanation in nondual Kashmiri
philosophy (particularly the writings of Abhinavagupta) as example of
=8Cword=B9 at its fullest)=8Bin contrast to English, psychoanalysis
(especially Lacan=B9s parole pleine) and the neurocentric problem-of-
origins in contemporary linguistics (is language acquired or
hardwired?). The talk will start at 3pm. The space will be open as a
public reading room, with relevant reading materials provided, from
10am on.

Thursday, February 21: the above event will be repeated. The space
will serve as public reading room starting at 10am. The talk will
start at 6:30pm.

Sunday February 24: we will orchestrate ALL AT ONCE=8Ba voicing of all
the phonemes, using permutations such as exhaustion, resorption,
forced, unforced, vocalic, consonantal, unstruck, etc. R. Steiner
wrote: =B3The entire universe is expressed when the alphabet is
repeated from beginning to end.=B2 Even better (nonlinearly,
atemporally)=8Bin nondual Kashmiri linguistics the phonemes are
energies, awarenesses, atoms, that give rise to the objective world.
Sound-sum, buzz-bundle, heard at once to see what it does. (I=B9m also
in need of volunteers for the phoneme choir. English employs 40
phonemes!)

Lastly=8BI=B9d very much like to meet with anyone who=B9d like to talk
about designing a building that meets the needs of poets.(To my
knowledge, there is not a structure on the planet designed
specifically for full realization of poetry.)

The address is 14 Wall Street. LMCC Swing Space, level B. Due to
security, all visits require appointment. My cell: 718 503 4246.
Yours, Robert.

This really sounds like a great way to teach Pound, and a great course.
Along with Pound, do you teach state-supported Soviet writers too? Is the
fact that Mien Kampf remains on shelves a sign of a hidden cult of Hitler?
I'm not sure I would equate the "reading of" with a "sympathy with" or an
"admiration of."

I somehow take issue with the idea that literature is an exhaust duct of
power, a way to detour and jettison guilty feelings from feeble head of
state. Certainly not all literature --and definitely not all writing-- falls
into this category. What do we look for in deciding this?

Subject:      Inhering characteristics of matter, let us say substance.
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII; format=flowed

Inhering characteristics of matter, let us say substance.


Let us say substance without differentiation, by which we mean, cohering
matter, the phenomenology of the _same_ without transitivity (as in for
example Irigaray). One is always lost in the same. At the limit, one might
consider the same a manifold without geodesics, striations, closed upon
itself, windowless, sightless, catatonic. But this is only a limit, never
found, incapable of seeing or being-seen; it is the limit of death, the
maw that absorbs us all. Now to open it up a bit:

"RECAPITULATION. -- The common or essential properties of bodies are, Im-
penetrability, Extension, Figure, Divisibility, Inertia, and Attraction.
Attraction is of several kinds, viz. attraction of Cohesion, attraction
of Gravitation, Capillary attraction, Chemical attraction, Magnetic
attraction, and Electrical attraction.

The peculiar properties of bodies are, Density, Rarity, Hardness, Elastic-
ity, Brittleness, Malleability, Ductility, and Tenacity."

(J L Comstock, A System of Natural Philosophy, 1854 and earlier.)

Electrical attraction is of one or two kinds, positive or negative, aus-
tral or boreal. It is an inhering fluid which gathers, puckers, expends.

Shape comes: "FIGURE OR FORM _is the result of extension, for we can not
conceive that a body has length and breadth, without its also having some
kind of figure, however irregular._" Fractals come: "Some solids are so
irregular, that they cannot be compared with any mathematical figure. This
is the case with the fragments of a broken rock, chips of wood, fractured
glass, &c.; these are called _amorphous._" Inversion comes: "A single
grain of musk will scent a room for years, and still lose no appreciable
part of its weight. Here, the particles of musk must be floating in the
air of every part of the room; otherwise they could not be every where
perceived."

What parts of the whole subtend figure, location, differentiation from the
other?

Attraction might be said to construct the other, the other's construction
of the self, both and neither, imaginary, chimera. Gravitational attrac-
tion is like to like; magnetic and electrical like to anti-like, but of
the otherwise same; capillary, specific like to specific other, of which
both adhere to their essential characters; chemical, unary or mutual
transformation of specific like to specific other; and cohesion, like to
like or like to specific other.

The peculiar properties inhere. "RARITY. -- This is the quality opposite
to density, and means that the substance to which it is applied is porous,
and light. Thus air, water, and ether, are rare substances, while gold,
lead, and platina, are dense bodies." Today this is in fact density, and a
peculiar property in general might be considered that which is related to
the atomic or molecular constitution of matter, or rather the particle
constitution of matter, hence for example the neutron star, or rather the
constituating configuration of matter, hence for example the black hole,
or rather nearly decomposable phenomena, hence possibly dark matter or
strings, or whatever preserves at least the very weakest of phenomenologi-
cal structures in the true world and its descriptive messay/anysign.

From William Peck's Introductory Course of Natural Philosophy for the Use
of Schools and Academies, edited from Ganot's Popular Physics, 1873:

"Physics is that branch of Natural Philosophy which treats of the general
properties of bodies, and of the causes that modify these properties.

The principle causes that modify the properties of bodies are: _Gravita-
tion, Heat, Light, Magnetism,_ and _Electricity._ These causes are called
_Physical Agents._"

There are solid and fluid bodies. Bodies have mass and density. The gener-
al properties of bodies include Magnitude, Form, Impenetrability, Inertia,
Porosity, Divisibility, Compressibility, Dilatability, and Elasticity. Be-
yond Gravity, there are molecular forces which include Cohesion, Adhesion,
Capillary Forces, Absorption, Imbibition ("the absorption of a liquid by a
solid body"), Tenacity, Hardness, Ductility, and Malleability.

The book, "Peck's Ganot," is based on Ganot's elementary version of his
Traite Elementaire de Physique; I have the 3rd 1854 edition. Here, physi-
cal agents are as follows: "l'attraction universelle, le calorique, la
lumiere, le magnetisme et l'electricite." Under general properties of
bodies: "l'impenetrabilite, l'etendue, la divisibilite, la porosite, la
compressibilite, l'elasticite, la mobilite, et l'inertie." Particular
properties are those observed in certain bodies or certain states of bod-
ies, such as solidity, fluidity, tenacity, ductility, malleability, hard-
ness, transparency, and coloration; there is density, weight, various
forms of elasticity, etc.

Heat, steam, hydraulics, magnetism, electricity, fluids, gas: the world is
in flux, numerous solids are porous, some transparent to magnetism, x-rays
and other out of directly perceivable bandwidth radiations and receptors -
all challenge the muteness of amphiboles, some absorb others, some gener-
ate others, some construct others as problematic, some are coherent, some
inhere, some leak into Freud's hydraulic model, some are id-messy or
libido-messy.

As I have pointed out, electrical fluid inhabits the spherical; the point,
punctum, drains it. Harboring matter is puckered, withdrawn. The fluid
seeps off in due time. It can be gathered in leyden jars, spewed from
voltaic piles (dynamic or galvanic electricity), generated from machines
(Wimhurst, von Guericke, etc.) with glass disks or cylinders or small
furnaces and stem or cat fur, pith, resin, tin foil (see the electrophor-
ous). It is social, the subject of "electrical recreations" led by men for
young women holding hands, sparking one another, hair stood on end, short-
circuiting jars and condensers. It's the men who electrocute dogs and
birds, test the apparatus against the limits of life and death. It's the
pith-man and pith-woman who jump up and down in funny embrace in a small
electrostatic entertainment. It's the woman who demonstrates the magnetic
swan to a small boy.

There's ectoplasm, outside the ken of these books, these models, as are
all sorts of spirits. Still, Peck/Ganot states right at the beginning:
"The Universe may be regarded as made up of _mind_ and _matter._ MIND is
that which thinks and wills; MATTER is that of which we become cognizant
through the medium of the senses. Science admits of two corresponding
divisions, _Science of Mind,_ or METAPHYSICS, and _Science of Matter,_ or
NATURAL PHILOSOPHY."

Three simple points from all of this: Much coheres, inheres, to matter;
some of what coheres or inheres is in problematic relation with an other
(general or specific); and much of these relatively early dialogs empha-
size a simplicity of fluidic substance and magnetic/electromagnetic
experimentation. While the science and technical characterization of the
world is clearly outmoded, the _phenomenology_ emphasizing a blurring of
static and dynamic, force and presence, circuit and stasis, state and
operator, and self and other, is rather sophisticated and uncannily
resonates with the messy and problematic distinctions among analogic and
digital/discrete domains, emanent and organic life, and real and virtual
as well as sign and anysign, all within the true world. We can't stop now;
we're just beginning to understand that the question isn't how many angels
are dancing on the head of a pin - the question is, how many angels are in
it.

MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1

One of my favorite books of all time is TRUE NEWS.  Watson's poems have a
distinctive clarity only the most attentive animal among us will divulge
after a long supper of the senses at the bus station, or wherever the hell
it is he manages to think us, rethink us.  And sometimes I say, "How nice of
him to do that for us," as though he did it for us.  I'd like to think he
did it for us, and there is a tender quality to the rock candy in my mouth,
also, and why not believe it is my point?  IMPOSSIBLE beauty in an
IMPOSSIBLE world is what I think sometimes when reading this book!  And once
in a while I think FUCK HIM THAT'S NOT TRUE!  OR NEWS!  But later I think,
maybe it is, maybe it is.

Barbieo Barros Gizzi's BLUE NOTE collage is the cover, making the whole book
one terrific and spellbinding THRILL!  Have you seen this book's cover?
Here's a link:  http://www.instancepress.com/images/truenews.gif

Not sure that thumb-sized portrait will do it for you, but you really should
own the book anyway, because I said so.  Do the collage and poems converse
with one another?  Am I asking myself out loud or pretending you are asking
me?  What's important for me has never been to ask that question.  When I'm
looking at BLUE NOTE (and literally doing so with a magnifying glass) the
details bend me into a position of better GETTING just how continuous a
juggling act our being here together, with all this other stuff of metal and
fish and petals, or driving, or falling, over into it, is.  The most
mysterious, almost disturbing THING for me is in the upper right hand corner
of the collage.  A gold circle, some kind of mirror frame, or portal frame,
with a blurred FACE(!?!) in it, possibly Mercury's?  It's either Mercury or
George Sand.  It can't be anyone other than Mercury or George Sand.  Well,
possibly it's Klaus Nomi wearing headphones.  Maybe.

It makes me want to write a poem called MAYBE, this gold framed portal into
Mecury-Sand-Nomi.  Thank you Barbieo Barros Gizzi for bringing these three
genius giants of Olympus together!  Who needs a poem?  A thank you is good.

INSTANCE PRESS needs to amp up their site a bit though, let us know more
about this book.  It's one of the best books of poetry ever, and everyone
should BUY IT, or shoplift it, or make someone buy it for them for
Presidents' Day.

TRUE NEWS:  http://www.instancepress.com/watson.htm

When I blink away from the 2008 presidential campaign, in pain, wanting to
explode, understanding how we have been wedged deep DEEP into the idea of
ONLY EVER AGAIN NEEDING two parties (because they're so great!), Watson's
book TRUE NEWS rings true:

"Later architects will build a new world
in which history is devoid of change."

An old friend who has bought the idea of total destruction of us all by 2012
keeps sending me the stupidest e-mails that seem to want to make me end it
all now, or something.  I'm going to send him TRUE NEWS for Presidents' Day.

DON'T TAKE ANY SHIT!  At least not lying down.  Stand at attention for your
shit.

A March 12th 7 PM appearance at City Lights Books in San Francisco by
Paul Pines to read from his new memoir,
http://www.citylights.com/info/?fa=3Devent&event_id=3D266



About My Brother's Madness:


This is the best wrestling match I have yet seen between Sigmund Freud
and the Pills, or, between Story and Therapy, or between Greek myth and
the Science of the Brain.
- Andrei Codrescu

In a market saturated with memoirs, many of them static and
self-indulgent, "My Brother's Madness" by Paul Pines shines like a
bright star and reads like a fast-paced novel.
http://mentalhopenews.blogspot.com/2007/12/madness-chronicles-difficult-
journey.html

PAUL PINES grew up in Brooklyn around the corner from Ebbet's Field and
passed the early 60's on the Lower East Side of New York. He shipped out
as a merchant seaman, spending 65-66 in Vietnam, after which he
supported himself driving a taxi and tending bar until he opened his own
jazz club, The Tin Palace in 1970 on the corner of 2nd Street and
Bowery. A cultural watering hole for the better part of the 70's, it
hosted figures like Kurt Vonnegut, Martin Scorsese, Charles Mingus,
Eddie Jefferson, Joan Mitchell (the painter) and Larry Rivers.

My Brother's Madness

published by Curbstone Press

My Brother's Madness is a gripping personal saga of a family striving to
cope with mental illness. It is based on the author's relationship to
his brother who had a mental breakdown in his late 40's. The book
explores the unfolding of the intertwined lives of the brothers.
Circumstances lead one brother from juvenile crime on the streets of
Brooklyn to war-torn Vietnam, to a fast-track life as a Hollywood
publicist and to owning and operating one of New York's most legendary
jazz clubs, The Tin Palace, while his sibling falls into, and fights his
way back from, a delusional psychosis.

The fact that the humanity of the protagonist is never dwarfed by the
illness, never reduced to a set of symptoms, gives a much needed
perspective to the reality of a condition that is so often stereotyped.

My Brother's Madness is part thriller, part an exploration that not only
describes the causes, character, and journey of mental illness, but also
makes sense of it. It is ultimately a story of our own humanity, and
answers the question, "Am I my brother's keeper?"

Growing up in New York City, Paul Pines is the author of six books of
poetry, including his most recent Taxidancing (IKON). His novel, The Tin
Angel , was a critical success. He currently lives in Glens Falls, NY,
with his wife, Carol, and his daughter, Charlotte, where he teaches
American Literature and Creative Writing at Adirondack Community
College, practices psychotherapy at Glens Falls Hospital, and hosts the
annual Lake George Jazz Weekend.

So odd this came up now, as I was just thinking about how it was time to go
back to Vollman.  Ron and I were voracious Vollman readers until about The
Butterfly Stories, where a sameness seemed to encroach.  Which is why I
thought it might be time to dive back in.

Hi Ryan,

Thanks for your reply.

I don't think I follow your point about /Mein Kampf/ and Pound.

My post was about the dynamics of consecration. Literature's most
homologous relation, sociologically, is religion. Both are based on
belief and consecration politics, yet both insist their claims are
anchored in truth and objectivity. My point is that the AG field,
unfortunately, has a pretty bad track record here as well.

Because the AG field is a fairly autonomous field
of production, it's highly vested in affirming its own
capacity to choose what it cathects as an object of fetish -- and it
will do so even if it means disregarding normative ethical standards.

Why? Because AG fields survive on symbolic capital over other kinds. In
fact you could argue that AG fields will tend to exercise their power of
consecration on precisely those works that defy normative social concerns.

You could even argue that a committee committed to autonomous criteria
("aesthetic" criteria) will choose the most defiant and heinous
candidate, or the most unlikely candidate, just to affirm its own power.
If that means choosing a Pound, so be it.

Further, critics will leap to enable that consecration, whether a Hugh
Kenner, a Carroll Terrell, an Achilles Fang (early critical proponents
of Pound), as a way of performing their powers of "critical discernment."

When literature is not treated as a system of belief (quality) and truth
(beauty), but understood as a sociological phenomenon enveloping a
dynamism yoked to use and life, we'll be moving toward a happier time.

Poets seem to be doing this more and more (use and life). I'm
particularly happy with the kind of aware, conscious efforts made, for
instance, by the ecopoetics movement -- whose criteria are calibrated
toward use, sustainability, awareness-raising.

Best to you, Ryan.
Gabe

If you need a justification for teaching Ezra Pound, not as an asshole but as an important poet, I suggest you try Canto #13.  Regards, Tom Savage

I had a feeling Sam Hamill would have something (from Buenos Aires) to say about all this:

Dear Paul:





This kind of stuff makes me crazy. It's reason #1423 why I didn't want to go into teaching, despite being a good teacher.







1. If you judge the value of literature by the character of its
authors, how many good books will be left standing? Villon the Thief,
Marlowe the Assassin, Li Po the Drunk, Baudelaire, Rimbaud, Hemingway,
Fitzgerald, Coleridge, and on and on... How many Southern writers were
not racist, including Faulkner? How many Japanese writers did not
despise the Chinese and Koreans and vice versa? How many classical
authors were not sexist-- virtually the entire body of Greek classics
is deeply so. Should we scrap Prufrock and Four Quartets because Eliot
was a bigot?









2. The reason Ez spent ten years in silence and never completed
his plan to edit the Cantos ("cutting them by 1/3rd") is that his
suffered profound guilt over having "been seduced by stupid suburban
prejuduce" that also seduced two or three generations of his
peers--including the notion that WWI was a product of "Jewish bankers
and arms-dealers of Europe."







3. Are the Cantos NOT worth study? Is the ABC of Reading NOT worth reading? Is his Confucius
NOT the first decent Master K'ung in English? Is "Hugh Selwyn Mauberly"
NOT a major poem? Are Pound's essays on prosody NOT ground-breaking?
Did his Cathay translations (and Imagism) NOT shape 20th century
American poetry? Did his Cavalcanti & Spirit of Romance NOT
reaffirm the importance of Provence in the history of western literature?









4. I believe that Ezra Pound's deeply disturbed personality produced rampant paranoia and his boundless megalomania. But it also produced genius.









5. Pound's rants over Rome
Radio were despicable, but also, very clearly, were a product of a
serious emotional breakdown. They are the ravings of a mind overrun by
hysteria. That's a sickness.









6. The MLA formula quiz is a reductio ad absurdum. You can't mine gold with a spoon.







7. "Abomination"
is, like beauty, in the eye of the beholder. And it's a word that is
often used in reactionary preachings of the born-again church, the
anti-semitic church, the racist church, the fanatical homophobic
church--it is a loaded word.






8. Whether or not this guy likes it, Ezra Pound
is THE father of modern American poetry. And as I say in my own Pisan
Canto, "Whatever you say about him is true." INCLUDING his famous
generosity toward poets and artists of every stripe (yes, including
Jewish ones like Zukovsky).

Charles Olson's _Conversations at St. Elizabeth's_ consists of journal
entries Olson wrote after visiting Pound. Olson detested his venom and =
odd
economic rants on some days and praised his memory, mind, and eye on =
others.

As Olson, one can admire and learn from Pound's magnificent work (even =
if
seriously flawed) and hate his anti-Semitism, racism, etc.=20

I don't know if there are any easy answers to reading/teaching Pound, =
but
that itself is of significant interest and worth discussion with =
students.
But purging him for our reading and thinking seems much more than =
pointless.

(By the way, Olson stopped going to St. Elizabeth's after Pound began =
racist
rants which included W.C.W., if I remember correctly.)

Pound sits on the nub of a particular discomfort. (As does Celine...and even
someone like David Jones professed a sympathy with Mosley - it's not an
uncommon problem). But I think to read his literary importance as simply a
function of defiant consecration and amoral fetishisation - and indeed to
describe him simply as "a poet of hatred" - is disingenuous. Isn't that also
fetishising, only in this case the poet rather than his work? Pound is also
the poet who wrote Homage to Septimus Propertius, and indeed, as Tom said,
Canto #13: and to claim that these poems only matter because Pound is a
racist and a fascist is perverse. Certainly, were I to deny their worth as
poems, I'd be denying a great deal that matters to me about poetry itself. I
don't think any poet has taught me more about the construction of a line. To
my mind, they matter _despite_ the ugliness of some of his beliefs and
utterances: and the fact that these things are side by side, the fact that
Pound's poetry is so blemished, creates a dilemma that I think is
uncomfortable and, if pursued, illuminating.  Because it destablises a
certain cult of moral perfection that seems to grow up around the idea of
the aestheticised writer and. by extension, around our own culture.

When I began to read Pound seriously, I was in part fascinated because it
seemed to me that he did have something to say that resonated uneasily with
the narrative of victory written by the Allies after WW2. Shorn of its
anti-Semitism and rants about usury, his prophecies about the arms industry
and the financial markets seem spot on. Without taking on his baggage, it is
possible to see a critique that jars against a certain triumphalism that has
infected the rhetoric of the west. (If anyone suggests that I am saying this
because I agree with Pound's excesses or racism, or because I seek to excuse
a poetry of hatred, I shall cry). I think that, read critically, there is a
real value in such jagged reminders of how complex human and political
situations really are. And I shall never believe that the creation of beauty
is useless. It's seldom enough valued for us to have nearly destroyed this
planet.

Which is to say that I think writerly ethics are much more complex than
professed belief. There are some poems out of ecopoetics I admire highly - I
just read a masterly adaptation of Milton's Comus by John Kinsella that
addresses this very question - but I have also read some very ordinary poems
in the name of ecopoetics which make me think that it would be better if the
poets concerned were out planting trees. And I hold very deep reservations
about readings of poetry that focus so narrowly on dynamics of power that
they obscure the experience of the poetry itself, or which veer so closely
to moralised interpretations of any oeuvre through biographical readings,
such as reducing Pound's very various achievement to "a poetry of hatred".

All best

Alison

Hello All,

As publisher, I very rarely experience the pleasure of being floored by a n=
ew poet=E2=80=94a poet whose name I=E2=80=99ve never heard; however,=20
when it happens, its one of the genuine pleasures of printing. An additiona=
l privilege is retaining this pleasure by sharing it=20
with others, vicariously reliving the discovery with each new reader. My gu=
ess is you=E2=80=99ve never heard of C.J. Martin, and I=E2=80=99m=20
extremely proud and honored to change that.=20

Last year, Martin published a tiny letterpress chaplet, =E2=80=9CCITY,=E2=
=80=9D with the always-elusive Vigilance Society: three little poems=20
mysteriously packaged with nary an explanation. After reading the poems a d=
ozen times, frozen at the mailbox, I immediately set=20
out to see what else he had. The result is Atticus/Finch=E2=80=99s twelfth =
chapbook release (and C. J. Martin=E2=80=99s first long-player)=E2=80=94Lo,=
=20
Bittern.

Taking as his point of reference assemblage artists such as Kurt Schwitters=
 and Louise Nevelson, Martin sculpts sound using=20
restraint at the service of release and revelation. This is visual poetry t=
hat works otherwise than mere typographic fuckery,=20
sonic work that listens to sight. The poems here are constantly regenerativ=
e and surprising in the truest sense=E2=80=94that is, they=20
depend less on mere parataxis and more on in-sight to accomplish the work o=
f astonishment.=20

I=E2=80=99m aware that it takes a little something extra to purchase a book=
 by an unknown author, especially when new work is spat from=20
the publishing juggernaut every time one blinks; however, I challenge you t=
o spend five minutes at our website with Martin=E2=80=99s=20
samples. If you=E2=80=99re not (at the very least) intrigued, you might be =
dead.

AND, guess what? ATTICUS/FINCH HAS MOVED! After nearly five years in the sn=
owy tundra of Buffalo, the press has adopted milder=20
climates in its new home=E2=80=94Seattle, Washington; however, we are proud=
 to maintain our professional affiliation with the Poetics=20
Program at SUNY Buffalo, and we hope to act as something of a west coast am=
bassador, even if we sometimes cuss in public.=20

You can familiarize yourself with Martin=E2=80=99s book at our website (www=
.atticusfinch.org), where you=E2=80=99ll find a sample of the cover and=20
some representative poems. You can order the book for ten dollars using Pay=
 Pal, or you can send a check (made payable to =E2=80=9CMichael=20

 or around Seattle, please drop a note!

Subject:      Bernstein on Pound - Excerpts
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

Excerpts from "Pounding Fascism (Appropriating Ideologies --
Mystification, Aestheticization, and Authority in Pound's Poetic
Practice)"  [Essay from A POETICS by Charles Bernstein] --



"... For Pound's fascism is all too easily censured, as by slap on
hand, while the fascist ideas that infect his poetry and poetics seep
unnamed into the orthodox cultural theory and criticism of this society.



Pound's fascism, far from hindering the canonization of his poetry by
American literary culture, has been a major factor in its acceptance.
Stripped of its obnoxious overtness, Pound's fascism becomes the stern
but fatherly voice of authority, measuring by the Pound standard the
absolute worth of the cultural production of all the societies of
earth, the ultimate Core Curriculum.  Without its righteously
Eurocentric and imperiously authoritative undercurrent, the formal
innovations of Pound's poetry would have contributed to its
marginalization.  This is evident from the relaxtive marginalization of
much of the formally innovative poetry of, sic, "The Pound Era".
Pound's status, far from being jeopardized by his political ideas, is
enhanced by them.



I do not, however, equate Pound's politics with Pound's poetry.  The
Cantos is in many ways radically (radially) at odds with the tenets of
his fascist ideals.  In this sense, Pound has systematically
misinterpreted the nature of his own literary production; refused, that
is, to recognize in it the process he vilified as usury and
Jewishness.  This blindness to the meaning of his work, to how in
significant ways it represented what he claimed to revile most,
contributed not only to the rabidness of his dogmatism but also to the
heights of magnificent self-deception and elegiac confusion that is The
Cantos at its best."



"Pound, or part of him, wished to control the valuation of the
materials he appropriated by arranging them in such a way that an
immanent or 'natural' order would be brought into being.  As Pound
seems to acknowledge in the final movements of the (for the moment)
standard version of the poem, The Cantos never jells in this way.  For
Pound this was a measure, no matter how ambivalent he may have been
about the evaluation, of the failure of The Cantos.

...



Pound's great achievement was to create a work using ideological
swatches from many social and historical sectors of his own society and
an immense variety of other cultures.  This complex, polyvocal
textuality was the result of his search -- his unrequited desire for --
deeper truths than could be revealed by more monadically organized
poems operating with a single voice and a single perspective.  But
Pound's ideas about what mediated these different materials are often
at odds with how these types of textual practices actually work in The
Cantos.



Pound's fascist ideology insists on the author's having an
extraliterary point of 'special knowledge' that creates a phallic order
(these are Pound's terms) over the female chaos of conflicting
ideological material.  As Robert Casillo points out in his study of
Pound's antisemitism, Pound contrasts the phallocentric/logocentric
unswerving pivot (citing Wang in canto 97: 'man's phallic heart is from
heaven / a clear spring of rightness') with the castrated and nomadic
Jew.  Jews are the purveyors of fragmentation and therefore the
dissolution of fixed hierarchical cultural values (the Jews, says Pound
on the radio, want to 'blot out the classics, blot out the record').
Again, Jews, as usurers and in league with the Commies, represent 'an
indistinct, rootless, destructive mass' eroding the agrarian ideal of
homestead, of nature and private property (values Pound equates with
order, clarity, telos). "



"...As Casillo concludes, 'Pound turned to Fascism because he shares
not only its deep fear of indeterminacy' -- of the vague, inchoate, and
incommensurable, of all that is mysterious or ambiguous or unknown --
'but also its central desire, which is to banish the indeterminate from
social life ... And as in Fascism, in Pound's work the ultimate sign of
such fearful [indefiniteness] is the Jew.'



What grotesque views for someone whose work is filled with
indeterminacy, fragmentation, abstraction, obscurity, verbiage,
equivocation, ambiguity, allegory; who has made the highest art of
removing ideologies from their origins and creating for them a nomadic
economy whose roots are neither in the land nor in the property but
rather in the abstraction of aestheticization and the irresolution of
the jarring harmonies of incommensurable sounds.  As Richard Sieburth
has noted, the ultimate irony of The Cantos is that all its
irreconcilable elements can be reconciled only in the abstract, by the
authority of the author, on credit.  Indeed, the real economy of The
Cantos is the one Pound constantly struggled to repress and to lay
bare:  the economy of reader and writer and book; the economy of
language not as Logos but as exchange.  ..."



"...neither do I wish to ignore the warning implicit in these
considerations:  that aesthetic processes can be used for a variety of
purposes; that to understand a work requires interrogating its
motivations and social context.  It is always revealing to ask of a
work:  what does it serve and how?  The answer to this question,
however, is not identical to what the worker's intentions may be.  A
response to this challenge is that some work may usefully evade any
single social or political claim made for or against it because of the
nature of its contradictions, surpluses, and negations.  Perhaps this
is the most positive thing that might be said of Pound's poetic works.



But perhaps fascism has won the day, anyway.  When Pound the great
artist is excused for his politics, fascism has won.  When Pound's
politics are used to categorically discredit the compositional methods
of his poetry, fascism has won.  When Pound's poetry is exalted and his
politic dismissed as largely irrelevant to his achievement, fascism has
won.  When Pound's politics are condemned, his poetry acknowledged or
ignored in passing, but sanitized forms of his ideas prevail-- the
virtue of authority, property, and the homestead ('family values'), the
sanctity of the classics, the condemnation of the nonstandard in favor
of 'the plain sense of the word' and the divine right of the West (or
East) to harness and bleed the rest of the world--fascism has won.

Excerpts from Pounding Fascism (Appropriating Ideologies --
Mystification, Aestheticization, and Authority in Pound's Poetic
Practice) [Essay from A POETICS by Charles Bernstein]


~~~


Excerpts from -- http://epc.buffalo.edu/authors/bernstein/essays/poundbern.html


"After insisting on the necessity and value of reading Pound in terms
        of his fascism, my speech begins with a discussion of Jerome Rothenberg's
        anthologies as a counter to the Core Curriculum mania (then in full swing),
        which I suggest is a logical extension of Pound's ideas of master texts.
        (Here I distinguish between Pound's "panculturalism" and "decentered multiculturalism".)
        I go on to differentiate Pound's desire for "montage" (the use of contrasting
        images toward the goal of one unifying theme) from his practice of "collage"
        (the use of different textual elements without recourse to an overall
        unifying idea). The piece ends with a discussion of Jackson Mac Low's
        great book Words nd ends from Ez, which it still seems to me is
        a fundamental resource for any consideration of Pound."


"...This new Pound
        criticism, which in some ways incorporates aspects of what has come to
        be called cultural criticism, or cultural and gender studies, tries to
        integrate Pound's political and economic ideas with his poetic practice.
        Like all critical projects, this one is limited. Much of the best Pound
        criticism before this period tended in various ways to cauterize or surgically
        remove the cancerous parts of Pound's work, or career, in an attempt to
        save the good parts. Partly this was a strategy to "save" the work, but
        it was equally a forceful interpretative system, an "apolitics" of poetry
        if you will. (Peter Nicholls: "Most previous criticism of [Pound's] work
        has, from a variety of motives, sought to keep these different strands
        separate, tending in particular to drive a web between the 'literary'
        and poltical dimensions in his writing.")"


"The point here is not to say one
        approach or the other is right but to note that these approaches allow
        for different readings of Pound's poetry. None of this work, it seems
        to me, ought to drive one from reading Pound; quite on the contrary. (Possibly
        this may be the work of a distinctly younger generation of scholars who
        no longer felt that raising these issues aligned their views with those
        who roundly dismissed Pound in the postwar period; this earlier polarization
        pushed those who went to the defense of Pound's poetry to avoid dwelling
        on the relation it has to his politics and views on money.)


       Casillo and Sieburth actually brought me back to reading Pound; that
        is, reading through the fascism and masculinism brought me from a passive,
        largely unarticulated, aversion to Pound, to an active, and ongoing, interest
        in all aspects of his work. Certainly I have been polemical in my essays
        on Pound, but not without the ironic realization that Pound relished just
        this sort of poetic polemicism. Reading Pound through the fascism means
        reading Pound in the most specific social and historical terms. It also
        means reading poetic forms politically, as an economy of signs ..."



"Poetry is not worth reading because it is comfortable or happy or understandable
        or uplifting, any more than history or philosophy is. Nor does reading
        for a politics of poetic form mean that forms are liberating; more often
        we find, as Ray DiPalma once wrote, that "all forms are coercive". If
        one starts with the assumption that a poetry should be truthful or beautiful,
        that it's meaning should transcend the circumstances of its production
        -- then of course talk of the politics of Pound's poetic forms will seem
        dismissive of Pound's work, since it pulls that work down from the heights
        of poetic vanity into the real-politics of the actual poem in actual history.



 People say, Pound was deluded, Pound was insane, Pound was paranoid,
        Pound was delusional, as a way to explain away, or possibly contextualize,
        his fascism. I don't doubt this, but it doesn't get me anywhere. Fascism
        itself was (IS) delusional and paranoid, and Hitler and Mussolini and
        Goebbels are certifiable in my book, as are the shouting Brown Shirts
        pictured in Triumph of the Will (don't we call this "mass hysteria"?).
        [Highly recommended, in this context, in the recent documentary on Riefenstahl,
        "The Wonderful, Horrible World of Leni Riefenstahl".] I agree with Pierre
        Joris that what's important to understand as we approach the end of this
        long century is the nature of this delusion, of this insanity, that has
        attracted so many otherwise admirable, sometimes brilliant, people, groups,
        indeed cultures. Of course Pound was delusional during the period of his
        Radio Speeches; reading Pound means reading through these delusions, trying
        to come to terms with them. It doesn't mean that in making these judgments
        one is free of one's own delusions, or that such a reading gives a complete
        account of this poetic works, which demands multiple, contradictory, readings.



 Pound was not just a fascist; he had different politics, and poetics,
        at different points in his life and even at some of the same points. Nicholls
        notes that from 1930 to 1937, Pound was eager to keep a dialogue open
        with the American Left; and earlier in his life his views seemed more
        Left than Right, although, reading Nicholls, one begins to see this as
        much as a weakness in the Life/Right distinction as an inconsistency on
        Pound's part. Nicholls also shows that "perhaps the most disquieting thing
        about [Pound's] savage propaganda is that it was to some degree an extension
        of ideas that had governed the earlier Cantos." Indeed, Nicholls's tracings
        of the (de?)evolution of the practice of "authority" and "ideological
        closure" in Pound's work is crucial for understanding a fundamental dynamic
        of modernism.



 Yet Pound's poetry is never simply a direct reflection of his politics;
        indeed, I would argue quite to the contrary that Pound's work contradicts
        his fascism. The fascist reading of Pound's poetic practice is valuable
        as one approach; it is not a final or definitive reading; as with all
        critical methods, it illuminates some issues while obscuring others. Of
        course, as Casillo's book and other Pound criticism shows, it also may
        push the criticism to the polemical and even hysterical, as if the critic
        feels she or he is wrestling with a demon more than interpreting a poem.
        This too needs to be historicized and contextualized before it can be
        judged.



 Pound told Allen Ginsberg he suffered from "that stupid, suburban prejudice
        of antisemiticm", as if he should have been immune from such a low, "suburban"
        consciousness. But one thing that is notable about Pound is that he does
        not appear to have been "personally" antisemitic, which would have been
        in no way unusual for a person of his generation and background. His attacks
        on Jews are not related to his hatred of individual Jews or his desire
        to be a member of an "exclusive" country club. His views of Jews are highly
        theoretical and structural, projecting Jewishness, more than individual
        Jews, as the core force in the destruction of the most cherished values
        of the West. This demonization is not a "stupid suburban prejudice", it
        is the systematic paranoia-producing ideology that has come to be called
        by the fascism. (Burton Hatlen: "we will all seriously misundertand fascism
        if we insist on seeing it as a "right-wing" poltical movement. For fascsim
        ... blended an authoritarianism ususally associated with the `right' and
        a `populism' ususally characteristic of the `left'.") Marjorie Perloff
        is quite right to point to it in Buchanan and the fundamentalist right;
        they too have gone well beyond "stupid suburban prejudice", even as they
        bank on it. It is scary to see the degree to which fascist ideas have
        rooted themselves so deeply in mainstream American life, often in the
        guise of family values and consonance with a natural order. Pound's most
        fascist polemics resonate in an eery way with the current wave of attacks
        on the arts, gays, the disenfranchised poor, immigrants, feminism, and
        the cities. I say this because there is often a tendency among Americans
        to exoticize fascism; Pound did his best to bring it home."

Hi, all!

I wanted to let you know about some performances we're
doing on the east coast this month and next--"we"
being The Nonsense Company, which does formally odd
political theater and new music, as well as the Prince
Myshkins, who play (mostly) funny, thought-provoking
Kurt-Weill-meets-the-Muppets-like satirical songs on a
wide variety of topics.

We'll be in New York, Boston, Providence, western
Mass., Philadelphia, and other places. All the info is
at
http://www.nonsensecompany.com
http://www.princemyshkins.com

The center of the tour is the Nonsense Company's
string of performances at the New York FRIGID
Festival. In all the Company's gigs on the tour, we'll
present "Great Hymn of Thanksgiving / Conversation
Storm," a pair of pieces by our own Rick Burkhardt
that we've been touring around for a couple of years,
and which won the "Best New Play" award at 2007's San
Francisco Fringe. I'm pretty proud of the shape the
performances are in, and think a lot of you would like
it.

"Great Hymn" is a piece for three performers around a
dinner table setup (with tuned wine glasses, squeaking
forks, etc.), and employs group speech techniques
we've been working on for years--the sound of a church
choir might be cut off in mid-consonant and switch to
the sound of a radio being turned on and off in the
next room; overlapping texts form phonemic "chords;"
blindingly fast perfect unisons persist for unlikely
amounts of time. The piece uses news reports from
Iraq, mealtime chatter, invented folk tales, scraps
from the Army prayer manual, and a fragment of Rae
Armantrout's poetry to form an intricate and urgent
musical composition.

"Conversation Storm" is a play about talking about
torture. Three old friends from three sides of the
political spectrum argue their way through a "ticking
time bomb" scenario, revising, dissecting and
brutalizing their own positions in the process, losing
track of who believes what and even of which
characters they're playing. Time is stretched or
collapsed; the performers snap between sccrambled
scenes in mid-sentence and mid-gesture as the
characters try to reorder and redirect the
conversation. What does it mean that torture is up for
discussion? What do you become if you take part in
that conversation on its current terms, and what
happens to your ethical position if you refrain?

Kevin Killian writes:
"Fantastic....  Little by little the repetitive scrape
of a knife across a china plate, the movement of a
spoon across a tablecloth, a finger around the rim of
a water glass, turns into a symphony....  The back and
forth between Higgins and Burkhardt has to be seen to
be believed... they have mastered the art of sarcastic
and haunting timing.  If you can possibly see any of
their remaining performances you will be seared like
ahi tuna.  I give the show my highest rating:  go, go,
go!"

Hope some of you can make it to one of these!

Thanks for poetry.

all the best,

Andy G.

http://www.let.uu.nl/alw/frame/en/forthcoming.shtml

Quoting the above 'page':

Forthcoming issue

The forthcoming issue of Frame is on Cyberpoetics. This might sound as a
vague theme, but a number of scholars from The Netherlands and from abroad
will explain this new way of reading, writing, and representation in their
articles.

Poet and composer Samuel Vriezen is writing a contribution that touches on
Flarf, a new genre within poetry. Flarf poems are apparently composed at
random from the results of a search instruction on Google. In these poems,
poets can reveal the infinity and at the same time the limitations of the
internet. Vriezen shows that despite its origin as a protest against
poetry.com, Flarf is situated in a long tradition of avant gardistic poetry
that is also composed in The Netherlands.

Katherine Hayles's article is of a more technical nature. She discusses the
art work Slippinglimpse by Stephanie Strickland, Cynthia Lawson Jaramillo,
and Paul Ryan. Her contribution problematises the process of reading and
cognition. The relation between human and non-human (digital) factors and
receptors is central to her question.

Lecturer at the University of Utrecht Kiene Brillenburg Wurth asks in her
article whether cyberpoetry is really a rediscovery of modernistic
experiments, a post- or multi-medial phenomenon. She poses that cyberpoetry
considers differences between media, problematises them and does not commit
to one genre. She illustrates this with one kind of cyberpoetry that is
formed by multiple media that merge and transform into each other, or as
Brillenburg Wurth calls it: "medially complex digital poetry." Amongst
others, Brillenburg Wurth uses the work of Jason Nelson and Jim Andrews to
prove her argument.

Frame editor Noortje Kessels examines the interveniating qualities of Peter
Verhelst's novel Zwerm. This is a relatively new term which is mainly
applicable to digital literature and which Kessels links to the theories of
Deleuze and Guattari. Kessels compares Zwerm to "Spas Text", a digital text
that changes when the reader moves his/her mouse on it. How do these
fragmentary texts relate to each other and to the theory of intervention?

Finally, the forthcoming Frame will contain a new Masterclass, this time
with a contribution of MA student Cécile van Reijmersdal who wrote on
"hyperfiction" and its consequences for the reader's experience. This Frame
will have an extended introductory foreword to explain the history and
meaning of the term and phenomenon of Cyberpoetics (written by Marieke
Winkler). Frame editor Arwin van der Zwan is writing a book review and Yra
van Dijk will contribute a lecture she recently held on Cyberpoetics.

We are planning on publishing the issue in May 2008.

Yay Allison.

Pound's sense of poetic community, his kindnesses to Joyce, Eliot, Frost,
and many others (even what we would abhor now as condescension etc to HD
meant then as promotion of her work) is not to be wiped out by his later
madnesses. In fact, excoriating someone's mental illness strikes me as a
horrific bigotry in its own right. His is a complex case and can't be done
away with in one self-righteous swipe.

Yes, EP was an asshole. As was Charles Olsen.

Assholes make great artist. I'm attracted to asshole in literature
("literature is news that stays news") and art, though spending a half
hour in the same room as them tends to irritate me, just as I tend to
irritate myself or feel foolish or stupid or abominable because of who I
am and what I've done in the past and probably what I will do in the future.

This is not a dismissal of Pound's assholishness or any others' -ness.
We are a multitude of -ness; it is what makes us human beings: we be and
we know we are being. Anyone who takes all that EP wrote or said as the
essence of his art and his life isn't really getting the -ness of his
art or life.

EP was a bullshit artist, albeit one of the most passionate, in his day.
One, like myself, could even go so far as to say that we, poets of the
west, are still responding to Pound's poetics. That's right, for over a
hundred years, we've all been responding to Pound, either directly or
inadvertantly and/or ignorantly. Pound forces the reader to be a
scholar, and I'm not talking all that
post-structuralist-post-colonial-post-everything-in-self-malarky, but
real scholarship: reading the masters. Pound believed with his soul that
truth was real and possible and attainable. Perhaps he strayed because
he was never willing to accept truth as being uniquely particular to an
individual within a group or community or society in their place and time.

Lastly, I hate Ezra Pound. I hate his genius clouded in naivety. I hate
his political rants and his negligent passions. Hatred is human, as is
fear, desire, love, infatuation, sympathy and appreciation. Hatred only
poses a real danger within the mob, as our recent wars will attest. Now,
I wonder who spoke out against the mob and war  to a greater number of
people more? You or EP?

All this mumbo-jumbo, this gaggle of words about on and around ol' Ez
gives me the creeps.

Well? I double-dog-dare you to write a poem as mind-blowingly amazing,
as uniquely contemporary, as something more news than "the Pisan
Cantos." Go on! Do it, woosie.

This morning I had a burning idea. What if the reviews journal of self-publ=
ished books, objects and ephemera were to coincide with a free distributor?=
 The name kept rolling around in my head - No Press Distribution, or NPD. I=
 think it would be best to outline such potential projects here, and hope t=
o get feedback from members of the community.

No Press Distribution
"Pressless is Priceless"

1. First we begin by soliciting members of the poetry community for self-pu=
blished books, pamphlets, chapbooks, objects, ephemera, etc.

2. We collect these publications in a database which will eventually become=
 a web-based distributor like Small Press Distribution. I will build a webs=
ite and update consistently. NPD will collect no fees for sales (we're not =
a consignment venture - god forbid!)

3. There will be an option for each title for on-line reviews, similar to t=
he amazon.com model. I'm not sure what kind of period the physical journal =
of reviews will be distributed, but I think it would be conducive to saving=
 paper if I create a CD-Rom version of the review journal, or keep it stric=
tly web-based. In this case, ANYONE can review titles. I believe this optio=
n will be more democratic and expansive.

4. Each title will be linked to info about how to purchase or obtain it. Th=
ere will be no central "housing"; the web-based distributor is merely a cen=
tral catalogue. All business is directed toward the individual.

5. Naturally, no fees will be amassed by me, or anyone managing the web-con=
tent, catalogue, etc.

6. I do ask, though, that anyone who wants to submit titles for cataloging/=
review should send a copy to me.

This is the basic skeleton. Firstly, I am trying to build a databse of peop=
le who want to send me materials. Let's try something first.

1. Send me an electronic copy (pdf, doc, rtf) of the description of the mat=
erial(s) along with a scanned image/photo (if possible) of it/them.

2. Send me your name and address if you'd like to be informed about future =
updates to reviews/catalogue.

Please write me if you have any questions. Any help is crucial and highly d=
esired...

NPD!  If anyone can do this, Christophe can pull it together -- I love this idea, C!

Chris has run Furniture Press for many years in Baltimore, publishing lovely chaps he tirelessly made by hand as well as little "tracts" of poems by tons of poets - many from this listserve.  These "tracts" (dubbed "PO25centEM") are perfect little samplings to leave about town on buses, cafe counters, and your boss's desk.  Anyway, he's done enough publishing and promoting on a small-but-wide scale to know the value of such a service -- why let anyone's efforts go to waste?  NPD sounds ideal & worthwhile.  I'm in!

This
morning
I
had
a
burning
idea.
What
if
the
reviews
journal
of
self-published
books,
objects
and
ephemera
were
to
coincide
with
a
free
distributor?
The
name
kept
rolling
around
in
my
head
-
No
Press
Distribution,
or
NPD.
I
think
it
would
be
best
to
outline
such
potential
projects
here,
and
hope
to
get
feedback
from
members
of
the
community.

No
Press

"Pressless
is
Priceless"

1.
First
we
begin
by
soliciting
members
of
the
poetry
community
for
self-published
books,
pamphlets,
chapbooks,

2.
We
collect
these
publications
in
a
database
which
will
eventually
become
a
web-based
distributor
like
Small
Press
Distribution.
I
will
build
a
website
and
update
consistently.
NPD
will
collect
no
fees
for
sales
(we're
not
a
consignment
venture
-
god
forbid!)

3.
There
will
be
an
option
for
each
title
for
on-line
reviews,
similar
to
the
amazon.com
model.
I'm
not
sure
what
kind
of
period
the
physical
journal
of
reviews
will
be
distributed,
but
I
think
it
would
be
conducive
to
saving
paper
if
I
create
a
CD-Rom
version
of
the
review
journal,
or
keep
it
strictly
web-based.
In
this
case,
ANYONE
can
review
titles.
I
believe
this
option
will
be
more
democratic
and
expansive.

4.
Each
title
will
be
linked
to
info
about
how
to
purchase
or
obtain
it.
There
will
be
no
central
"housing";
the
web-based
distributor
is
merely
a
central
catalogue.
All
business
is
directed
toward
the
individual.

5.
Naturally,
no
fees
will
be
amassed
by
me,
or
anyone
managing
the
web-content,
catalogue,
etc.

6.
I
do
ask,
though,
that
anyone
who
wants
to
submit
titles
for
cataloging/review
should
send
a
copy
to
me.

This
is
the
basic
skeleton.
Firstly,
I
am
trying
to
build
a
databse
of
people
who
want
to
send
me
materials.
Let's
try
something
first.

1.
Send
me
an
electronic
copy
(pdf,
doc,
rtf)
of
the
description
of
the
material(s)
along
with
a
scanned
image/photo
(if
possible)
of
it/them.

2.
Send
me
your
name
and
address
if
you'd
like
to
be
informed
about
future
updates
to
reviews/catalogue.

Please
write
me
if
you
have
any
questions.
Any
help
is
crucial
and
highly
desired...

I, too,  love the idea of NPD.  Count me in!  And I'm starting my own
chapbook series as a result of these Poetics List discussions -- a series
that will feature short experimental poetry performance pieces, ones that
have been presented/read to an audience.  The series will start with a piece
I myself am reading this coming week at the contemporary lit conference in
Louisville (hence, "self-published").  Follow-up chapbooks will feature
other authors.

More on my chapbook series later.  Meanwhile, thanks to all for the
stimulating discussions on self-publishing.   Part of the point of
conceptual/radical poetry is to push outside the current structures,
including that of hierarchical evaluation and entrenched publication systems
(for example, that of the known commodity or the "brand name").  I once had
an academic colleague say, "Oh, no, not another person writing poetry" (when
he discovered I was writing).  But I say:  the more challenging poetry that
is out there circulating, the better.

An NPD would be another way to fly under the radar in terms of "distribution
laws," and would help keep the small-press world doing what it does best --
not kow-towing to the order of things as even "experimental" venues
themselves start to rigidify.

You sure like to say "asshole" and "bullshit," or so it seems to me.
Ah, language, you cesspool and quagmire of easy insults.

I disagree entirely that "Assholes make great artists." If it were
true, there would be a LOT more great artists, and Dick Cheney would
be one of them. So while I don't agree with that mis-logical step, I
do think you say some things about Pound that are complex and need to
be said.

As for "Olson," you could at least learn to spell his name correctly.

Cool ideas,

In the interim, there are at least two websites that serve SOME of the
functions you are listing. Both Press Press Press (
http://presspresspress.blogspot.com/) and the DIY Poetry Publishing COOP (
http://diypublishing.blogspot.com/) have create small communities of DIYers
where announcements and publications and contact infos are regularly
exchanged, posted, archived. Certainly not the catalogue command center
envisioned below, but spaces to frequent if you're not yet familiar.

Cheers,
MH

This is probably irrelevant but years ago I read the anti-semitic broad-
casts; I've also heard a number of them. They were worse than I could have
imagined; they sounded like Celine at his most extreme. What bothers me
about Pound is the arrogance I connect with these views, this notion of
rectitude that underlies a lot of his work. Although I'm sure I don't know
what I'm talking about, those broadcasts - which clearly were not an
anomaly, one can't blame them on usury, Mussolini, whatever - wrecked his
work for me. If the polemic came from a Nazi like Goebbels it would be
considered inexcusable; since it's Pound, let's bend over backwards? But
there's real violence in him, American Father Coughlin whatever violence,
and on a personal note it was too much for me.

this article does not make the argument that pound's politics were
misunderstood.  rather it acknowledges quite frankly his support of
mussolini and his anti-semitism, though this acknowledgment is buried
near the end of the piece.  so what is it that is "misunderstood" about
pound here: the fact that he was more serious about learning Chinese
than is usually believed?  that's a tragic misunderstanding? it seems
that pound's politics are all too well understood by those of us who
take exception to them.

yes, I agree with Maria entirely....because Pound is a Sinophile, he =20
can't be an anti-Semite?  one trumps the other somehow?  that logic, =20
of course, is utterly illegitimate--and yet, it operates covertly in =20
the article--for what else could it be claiming when it asserts Pound =20=

was "tragically misunderstood"?

That poetry is made by fallible human beings should come as no surprise.? I want to suggest though that calling Ezra Pound an asshole speaks more to the namer than the named.? It all sounds pretty projective to moi. What's at stake there?? What cultural capital is at risk?

You sure like to say "asshole" and "bullshit," or so it seems to me. Ah, language, you cesspool and quagmire of easy insults.?
?
I disagree entirely that "Assholes make great artists." If it were true, there would be a LOT more great artists, and Dick Cheney would be one of them. So while I don't agree with that mis-logical step, I do think you say some things about Pound that are complex and need to be said.?

As for "Olson," you could at least learn to spell his name correctly.?

I realize that people dismiss Pound or ignore the work because of his antis=
emitism, which is quite an understandable reaction.  The problem is that, e=
ven today in these "enlightened times",  yet another article appeared attem=
pting to pardon and dismiss Pound's antisemitism in an effort to position h=
im as "the greatest poet of the last century" -- this ongoing trend to excu=
se his fascism and render it invisible, as well as forgoing any examination=
 of how his fascism informed his poetics, is political by its very nature, =
historical, and part of what sustains his popularity.   Separating the work=
 from Pound's politics, whether to dismiss his work or to celebrate it, a) =
ignores how The Cantos in some ways betrays Pound's fascism and b) allows a=
 receptive audience to ignore the subversive fascist practices that inform =
his work and simultaneously (& ignorantly) celebrate those practices.=0A=0A=
It is well worth examining how his fascism informed his work as well as stu=
dying other political practices that he used to his benefit but publicly na=
med and condemned -- his politics proper are an attempt to deny the conflic=
ting politics* of his work.  Why?  As noted by Bernstein, "It is scary to s=
ee the degree to which fascist ideas have rooted=0Athemselves so deeply in =
mainstream American life, often in the guise of=0Afamily values and consona=
nce with a natural order. Pound=92s most fascist=0Apolemics resonate in an =

Gabe,

I follow. Though I'm not sure what you mean by AG, and I don't see anywhere
in the previous commentary where this AG acronym appears.

My point by mentioning Mein Kampf relates to "scholarly" approaches to works
of literature that exist separate from their creators. Bernstein mentions in
Pounding Fascism --and allow me to flagrantly paraphrase-- that it is
possible to approach these texts ("these" always being texts that we
disagree with) for study without apologizing for the writer's politics. To
reject the object of consecration as being a product of an "asshole" seems
limiting. And aren't all new philosophies doing a bit of rejecting of
"normative" (Define normative, whose normative?) ethical standards?

I mention Mein Kampf (along with the music of choice of civilization's great
monsters: rockabilly) in order to name another work that almost never comes
under attack as the product of a monster that enjoys some level of
acceptance as a "consecrated object." Another? Guerrilla Warfare (or
anything written by Che, for that matter). It's odd to me that this debate
seems to come up every so often. Or perhaps Pound is targeted because he is,
and will remain, an easy target. A deceased, easy target.

Best,
Ryan

I still find this a moot argument. Whether Pound is the greatest poet of th=
e
last century has nothing to do with his fascism. It has to do with his
poetry.

I find it conveniently dismissive to separate the two.  His politics inform=
ed his poetry.  It would be nice if our "artist" lives could sit on a shelf=
, untainted by the messy world and its viewpoints, while our regular person=
s walked around, enacting our political views, readying to be shelved when =
the artist comes out to play, but these compartmentalizations aren't possib=
le.   This complex connectedness is why tastes and styles and practices ran=
ge and often reflect our socio-economic and ethnic identities (to put it pe=
rhaps too simplistically), as well as reflecting our politics proper.   Eve=
n "safe", "simple", "accessible" "mainstream" poetries promote political pr=
actices and predilections.  =0A=0ACelebrating and promoting Pound's work wi=
thout considering and examining how his fascism informed his poetry is a da=
ngerous position to defend.  It's also popular and easy.=0A=0AAmy=0A=0A ___=

fascist poets best and completely forgotten=20
because they're terrible poets. Their fascism=20
hasn't connected to a putative fascism inherent=20
in the culture at large to make them famous or admired.

Another example: Wagner's protonazism is=20
absolutely central to the Ring Cycle, although=20
one can (and most do) ignore the politics of the=20
mythologizing and enjoy it as simply=20
mythologizing. But his enormous extensions of the=20
language of tonality and of musical structure are=20
neither motivated by that politics nor=20
necessarily tied to it--witness Bruckner, Mahler,=20
Berg, a slew of others. I suggest the same may be=20
true of Pound, and I'd need an analysis of an=20
instance of his means, not a global statement, to convince me otherwise.

Hi Amy -

I get what you're saying about the sidelining of Pound's politics in the
weighing of his work. All the same, I am not at all sure that you can simpl=
y
identify Pound's poetry as "fascist". Surely the "easy and popular" (and
most common) option is simply to dismiss his poetry? And beyond the crudest
of agitprop, can you really identify artworks as "fascist" or "democratic"
or whatever with any sense of certainty? Surely one of the most interesting
things that Bernstein has to say is that Pound's practice as a poet
profoundly contradicts his politics? ("I do not, however, equate Pound's
politics with Pound's poetry.  The Cantos is in many ways radically
(radially) at odds with the tenets of his fascist ideals.") I wholly agree
with that statement, and I think it's most evident when the poet in the poe=
m
confronts his own failures and finitudes - in the Pisan Cantos for example
or towards the end, his intellectual and poetic structures collapses under
those impossible contradictions. Myself, I find those fractures moving
("Beauty is difficult") and deeply interesting. And as I said earlier, I
think that acknowledging Pound's achievements requires whatever is the
opposite of denial: it can only be seen clearly with its contradictions
acknowledged within the "messy world".

All best

A

Cool ideas regarding the NPD,


In the interim, there are at least two websites that serve SOME of the
functions you are listing. Both Press Press Press (
http://presspresspress.blogspot.com/) and the DIY Poetry Publishing COOP (
http://diypublishing.blogspot.com/) have created small communities of DIYers
where announcements and publications and contact infos are regularly
exchanged, posted, archived. Certainly not the catalogue command center
envisioned below, but spaces to frequent if you're not yet familiar.


Cheers,

This morning I had a burning idea. What if the reviews journal of
self-published books, objects and ephemera were to coincide with a free
distributor? The name kept rolling around in my head - No Press
Distribution, or NPD. I think it would be best to outline such potential
projects here, and hope to get feedback from members of the community.

No Press Distribution
"Pressless is Priceless"

1. First we begin by soliciting members of the poetry community for
self-published books, pamphlets, chapbooks, objects, ephemera, etc.

2. We collect these publications in a database which will eventually become
a web-based distributor like Small Press Distribution. I will build a
website and update consistently. NPD will collect no fees for sales (we're
not a consignment venture - god forbid!)

3. There will be an option for each title for on-line reviews, similar to
the amazon.com model. I'm not sure what kind of period the physical journal
of reviews will be distributed, but I think it would be conducive to saving
paper if I create a CD-Rom version of the review journal, or keep it
strictly web-based. In this case, ANYONE can review titles. I believe this
option will be more democratic and expansive.

4. Each title will be linked to info about how to purchase or obtain it.
There will be no central "housing"; the web-based distributor is merely a
central catalogue. All business is directed toward the individual.

5. Naturally, no fees will be amassed by me, or anyone managing the
web-content, catalogue, etc.

6. I do ask, though, that anyone who wants to submit titles for
cataloging/review should send a copy to me.

This is the basic skeleton. Firstly, I am trying to build a databse of
people who want to send me materials. Let's try something first.

1. Send me an electronic copy (pdf, doc, rtf) of the description of the
material(s) along with a scanned image/photo (if possible) of it/them.

2. Send me your name and address if you'd like to be informed about future
updates to reviews/catalogue.

Please write me if you have any questions. Any help is crucial and highly
desired...

This is a great idea. it seems to me though that in order to avoid
some of the general clearing house nature of a site like amazon that
there might be a corps of reviewers available to review everything
that gets submitted. It would still be possible for anyone to review
work on the website, but perhaps the distributed CD-ROM or dead tree
edition would ensure a review. I'm assuming that you would pretty
much take all submissions for distribution and there wouldn't be a
selection process. and that's a great thing, but still it seems the
biggest risk is a wash of unfamiliar unknown material with no sense
of how interesting or good it might be. One thing that I've found in
my research into self publishing is that I really do't like the way a
number of small presses copy verbatim the marketing techniques used
by the large houses. The end result being it's often difficult to
tell whether you want to read something or not. And when that
something is, as often as not, a 20 dollar perfect bound chapbook
size issue, I often opt not to take the risk. So the one rule i would
suggest would be that persons affiliated with the publisher and
author should be asked to identify themselves as such in online
reviews, and further that there be a corps of critics identifiable as
such who would between them review all incoming projects.

The problem I always have with condemning Pound is the fact of his
mental illness. I have no real interest in the debates about how sick
he really was, but side with Papa when he wrote that he didn't think
anybody could say the things that Pound said in his radio broadcasts
and be a sane person. Clearly there was illness there, and the
politics of his boosters and critics have unfortunately obscured the
truth about how ill he really was. Still, mental illness and paranoia
and the fear that results from it, that's  horrible condition, and
all sorts of repugnant beliefs I think can be understood and forgiven
as a result.

As for how that stuff impacts pounds work, i've often thought it was
too easy to just call him an anti-semite and a fascist. He was most
definitely those things. but like many very intelligent people who
get involved in some movement or another, it's rarely the case that
one can just assign the dogmas of the usual anti-semite and fascist
to them. I think what makes pound so interesting is the very
strangeness and uncommonness of his repugnant views. and I think
there's value in examining them in detail because he reminds us that
our enemies should not be dehumanized. that people with awful
horrific utopias in their minds are not all cut from the same cloth
and that each should be taken as an individual on his or her own merits.

Ginsberg was more than ready to give Pound a pass. And Pound did change. Doesn't the whole St. Elizabeth's episode seem revealing as there's much to indicate that Pound may have been suffering from acute mania. I don't think bi/polar is a glib excuse for Pound's behaviour, but it does help us to understand him. Really, when the Italians heard his broadcast they couldn't take him seriously because he was incoherent much of the time.

amy king <amyhappens@yahoo.com> wrote:  I realize that people dismiss Pound or ignore the work because of his antisemitism, which is quite an understandable reaction. The problem is that, even today in these "enlightened times", yet another article appeared attempting to pardon and dismiss Pound's antisemitism in an effort to position him as "the greatest poet of the last century" -- this ongoing trend to excuse his fascism and render it invisible, as well as forgoing any examination of how his fascism informed his poetics, is political by its very nature, historical, and part of what sustains his popularity. Separating the work from Pound's politics, whether to dismiss his work or to celebrate it, a) ignores how The Cantos in some ways betrays Pound's fascism and b) allows a receptive audience to ignore the subversive fascist practices that inform his work and simultaneously (& ignorantly) celebrate those practices.

It is well worth examining how his fascism informed his work as well as studying other political practices that he used to his benefit but publicly named and condemned -- his politics proper are an attempt to deny the conflicting politics* of his work. Why? As noted by Bernstein, "It is scary to see the degree to which fascist ideas have rooted
themselves so deeply in mainstream American life, often in the guise of
family values and consonance with a natural order. Pound’s most fascist
polemics resonate in an eery way with the current wave of attacks on
the arts, gays, the disenfranchised poor, immigrants, feminism, and the
cities. I say this because there is often a tendency among Americans to
exoticize fascism; Pound did his best to bring it home."

Amy


* "Pound’s great achievement was to create a work using ideological
swatches from many social and historical sectors of his own society and
an immense variety of other cultures. This complex, polyvocal
textuality was the result of his search — his unrequited desire for —
deeper truths than could be revealed by more monadically organized
poems operating with a single voice and a single perspective. But
Pound’s ideas about what mediated these different materials are often
at odds with how these types of textual practices actually work in The
Cantos.



Pound’s fascist ideology insists on the author’s having an
extraliterary point of ’special knowledge’ that creates a phallic order
(these are Pound’s terms) over the female chaos of conflicting
ideological material. As Robert Casillo points out in his study of
Pound’s antisemitism, Pound contrasts the phallocentric/logocentric
unswerving pivot (citing Wang in canto 97: ‘man’s phallic heart is from
heaven / a clear spring of rightness’) with the castrated and nomadic
Jew. Jews are the purveyors of fragmentation and therefore the
dissolution of fixed hierarchical cultural values (the Jews, says Pound
on the radio, want to ‘blot out the classics, blot out the record’).
Again, Jews, as usurers and in league with the Commies, represent ‘an
indistinct, rootless, destructive mass’ eroding the agrarian ideal of
homestead, of nature and private property (values Pound equates with
order, clarity, telos). ”

“…As Casillo con cludes, ‘Pound turned to Fascism because he shares
not only its deep fear of indeterminacy’ — of the vague, inchoate, and
incommensurable, of all that is mysterious or ambiguous or unknown —
‘but also its central desire, which is to banish the indeterminate from
social life … And as in Fascism, in Pound’s work the ultimate sign of
such fearful [indefiniteness] is the Jew.’



What grotesque views for someone whose work is filled with
indeterminacy, fragmentation, abstraction, obscurity, verbiage,
equivocation, ambiguity, allegory; who has made the highest art of
removing ideologies from their origins and creating for them a nomadic
economy whose roots are neither in the land nor in the property but
rather in the abstraction of aestheticization and the irresolution of
the jarring harmonies of incommensurable sounds. As Richard Sieburth
has noted, the ultimate irony of The Cantos is that all its
irreconcilable elements can be reconciled only in the abstract, by the
authority of the author, on credit. Indeed, the real economy of The
Cantos is the one Pound constantly struggled to repress and to lay
bare: the economy of reader and writer and book; the economy of
language not as Logos but as exchange. …”

Dear Amy:

Many thanks for your posting this-- it connects with some things I thought
of earlier re Pound which are a bit different way of thinking abt him than
had been brought up previously here, and also some ideas re fascism and
American poetry which have to do with their situations in the USA as they
have devolved over the last 28 years.

First, a quote from Leonard Peltier, the AIM activist and political prisone=
r
of the Federal Government of the USA.

The government under pretext of security and progress liberated us from our
land, resources, culture, dignity and future. They violated every treaty
they ever made with us. I use the word "liberated" loosely and
sarcastically, in the same vein that I view the use of the words "collatera=
l
damage" when they kill innocent men, women and children.

They describe people defending their homelands as terrorists, savages and
hostiles . . .

My words reach out to the non-Indian: Look now before it is too late=97see
what is being done to others in your name and see what destruction you
sanction when you say nothing.

              =97Leonard Peltier, Annual Message January 2004


 In contrast to this, here's  a quote from Dr Bernstein and the context in
which it occurred:


On 29 December 2006, Saddam Hussein was hung in Baghdad , and, outside
Philadelphia,  at an MLA "off site" reading, roughly 60 American poets
celebrated each other s works, and Dr Marjorie Perloff's becoming the new
President of the MLA, With Dr Perloff's Presidency, the general consensus
was that   the long dark ages of cultural studies were over with, and a new
era of focus on poetics would begin.

 "What we're interested in is talking about these works as works of art,
rather than extracting the sociological or historical information from
them", Charles Bernstein explained to Susan Snyder in that day's issue of
the Philadelphia Inquirer, in a story headlining the rise in jobs and
importance of poetry and creative writing programs in the nation's
institutions of higher learning.

One wondered if there might not be some kind of connection between "talking
about these works as works of art," while not "extracting the sociological
and historical information from them," and the rise in jobs and numbers of
and importance of poetry and creative writing programs.

What exactly is meant by "talking about these works as works of art, rather
than extracting the sociological and historical information from them" in
relation with Peltier's "Look now before it is too late--see what is being
done to others in your name and see what destruction you sanction when you
say nothing."


This is the question that was asked of and is asked of still--the
intellectuals and artists in Europe and England who remained disengaged,
saying nothing, as Japan invaded China, Italy invaded Ethiopia, Franco's
Falange invaded the Spanish Republic and Hitler steadily annexed the
Sudetenland, Austria, Czechoslovakia and was beginning the disappearances o=
f
peoples into camps and ovens, while Stalin was carrying out his mass purges
in the USSR.

It's a question, as Leonard Peltier warns, that needs to be asked of
American intellectuals and artists today.

.   In reading Peltier's words about the American government's treatment of
and rhetoric regarding the Indian, one recognizes the daily barrage of
propaganda, lies, and Internationally recognized illegal military force,
torture, imprisonments, renditions, land grabs, total societal destructions
by the USA and its heavily US funded allies as carried out in Palestine,
Iraq, Afghanistan and Lebanon, with threats of the same to Syria and Iran.


As Leonard Peltier says--see what destruction is being done in your name,
see what you sanction when you do and say nothing

In the December 2006-January 2007 issue of the Poetry Project Newsletter,
Amiri Baraka wrote a piece called "Why American Poetry is So Boring, Again.=
"
Baraka notes that in the current situation, there is a desire for al the
comforts of Homeland Security and an eschewing of the poetry of "the
actual."  Baraka writes of the poets' "desire to be in the social diarrheic
of society's value and meaning, and "the "blunt consideration" of playing i=
t
safe, of not "saying something", to protect one's career

Baraka writes:



This isn't limited to the "Academic Cowards of Reaction" . . . These (poets=
)
would include certain crypto-Babbits=97of the so-called L*A*N*G*U*G*E poets
whose theoretical quasi "left" masquerade seeks to obscure a limp
conservatism that opposes political activism by artists (e.g. Ginsberg) as
an "impossible ideology". And with that their dullness to be construed as
profoundly arty . . .

In the cases I speak of poetry has become the devil's tail waggling flashil=
y
out of Bush's behind, like Gerald 2X's 60's devil cartoons. One wonders, is
it still called "high art"? Now too high to deal with the angst, pain and
ignorance of the real world though certainly an obtuse registry of it.
Content with the masturbatory, inoffensiveness of an actual *loyal
opposition*, inferred loudly as "deep intellectualism". Childish feints at
surrealism, jokey pop art, the inside jokes for the uncognescenti, all pass
as wow! poetry!1

Where Peltier sees and hears the sanctioning of "saying and doing nothing,"
Baraka sees and hears a kind of career driven "playing it safe" and jokey
noisiness with which to hide the "saying nothing."

It's safe in this climate to attack Pound's anti-Semitism=97Israel after al=
l
is our closest ally=97but when it comes to his fascism, or, that is, the
fascism as it exists today and here, fascism is refused to be seen as apart
from anti-Semitism., rather than as a corporate-state war machine which wil=
l
use any pretext to set itself in motion=97whether it be non existent WMDs i=
n
Iraq or the pre-emption of any form of nuclear energy in Iran, or almost an=
y
thing done on any given day by any one in Palestine or Lebanon, or the
reappearance of autonomously  directed social changes in Latin America.


     I don't know how many persons here have actually listened to Pound's
broadcasts--but they are truly horrific hate filled violence driven
pronunciamentos of the worst kind.  Yet, as much as they make one feel like
vomiting,or worse,  they are in a sense the precursors of so much of the
public discourse of the post 9/11 period of American history. Hate speech,
propaganda, disinformation, the ever greater corporate-state fascism of the
USA and its almost entirely militarized economy, backed up by media that is
steadily churning out war mongering and the most distorted fantasies
imaginable, while the country itself slides into ever greater personal and
public debt and ruin

    When I last listened to Pound I kept in mind the American media of
especially the last 7 years.  How much of the daily rhetoric on screen, in
the air waves in the newspapers and magazines, is not all that far from the
rhetorics and acts of violence, hatred, bigotry, distorted and manipulated
dis information that Pound is pouring forth in such hyper drive arrogance,
authority and righteousness.  And aren't these latter really qualities not
only associated with Authoritarianism and Nazism but by a good part of the
world with Americans?  Arrogance=97righteousness=97hyperdrive=97the instant=
,
ignorant judgments, the blindness to any suffering but their own?


Regarding Pound--I think it's interesting that it's hardly ever mentioned
that he was a traitor, convicted of the crime of treason, and that's the
reason he was in St Elizabeth's.
         A great deal of time and energy and verbiage is expended on Pound'=
s
fascism and anti-Semitism, his economic theories, his contributions to
poetic invention and form, to the study of poetry and the reading of it,
but very little is said about his treason.  On the one hand, the treason,
which used to be a capital offense, is overlooked as delusional, while his
other so-called delusions of the period are elevated to the status of crime=
s
so heinous death itself would not be punishment enough.
        Treason, betrayal--acts which historically have been at every level
from the intimately personal to the publicly broadcasted among the very mos=
t
appalling things one can do to those who most trusted one--are demoted to a
near irrelevance, a "delusion" in the "fog of war," in which the poet
"really did think he was trying to do right" by duped American soldiers.

Ironically, Pound's case has been reverse engineered into that of Jonathan
Pollard, currently serving a life sentence for the greatest and most
devastating theft and sale of American intelligence in history.  For years
this act of treason greatly damaged the most sensitive areas of the America=
n
military preparedness. And for years now American Presidents have been
lobbied harder and harder to pardon Pollard, with the argument that since h=
e
sold al the secrets to Israel, an ally, he was not really committing
treason.  In fact, it is argued at times, he should really be regarded as a
hero.
          During Pound's stay at Saint Elizabeth's, Julius and Ethel
Rosenberg were executed for treason in the electric chair.  Of course, they
were accused of passing secrets to the Russian Commies, the Public Enemy
Number One of those heady McCarthy Era days.  It might be interesting in
these even headier Global War on Terror days to examine the ways in which
Pound's treason has been overlooked in light of his fascism and
anti-Semitism and Pollard's far worse treason is to be overlooked for its
deeper allegiance to Israel, Ally Number One.


        I  think Pound's authoritarianism needs to be thought of also in
terms of his lifelong interest in Confucius, and  the forms of society and
teachings and core curriculum (the Analects and the Classics for example--)
as set up by Confucianism as Pound understands it and not simply and solely
in light of Dr Bernstein's "righteously
Eurocentric and imperiously authoritative undercurrent."


          Confucianism, as has often been studied and pointed out, had a
great influence on many aspects of Maoism.  The kind of authoritarianism
Pound was interested in was much more complex than its usual reduction
to the vaguely gestured at bogeyman invoked by Dr Bernstein and others.
        And re Pound's lifelong fascination with China and "the Chinese
Written Character as a Medium for Poetry, " "Cathay" and  Confucianism--the
possibility of examining these in terms of Edward Said's Orientalism, and
the historical linking of Sino-American Cultural Exchanges as taking place
within the historical  contexts of the changing dynamics of the
Sino-American economic and material exchanges from the China Clippers to
Pound's time to the present, with last year's Conferences on American Poetr=
y
in China, which featured one on Language Poetry with Dr Bernstein among
others giving presentations,  and this year's founding of the 'The
Chinese/American Association for Poetry and Poetics (CAAP), This, as its
press release notes is "initiated by Marjorie Perloff, Charles Bernstein,
and Nie Zhenzhao," and was  "established in January 2008 with its
headquarters at Center for Programs in Contemporary Writing, University of
Pennsylvania, USA. "


          Pound's interest in China began roughly with the period of the
rise of the greatest American influence in China, and by the time this
collapsed he was in St Elizabeth's, and Confucianism in China had been
subsumed into the rubric of Maoism.  In a late interview, Pound was to
praise Walt Disney as the creator of a form of international ideogramatic
Confucian teaching, Indeed, "the Confucian side of Disney", as Pound called
it, might even be seen as a kind of prevision of the current "Disney side o=
f
Confucius" one may find in Dr Bernstein's obsessive photos of the malaprop
English translations of Chinese signs already great favorites with tourists
on their trips to the American Disneyworld of China which they are able to
find in of all places China.


I think one can say that to some extent the Americans, at least, are
influenced   by Pound's historical poetic example in the recent
rapprochements with their Chinese colleagues, while noting also that the
Americans'  "radical, innovative poetry" must be for the Chinese a Paper
Tiger compared to those of  their own poetries which they suppress.

         After all, the Chinese Government, which so carefully monitors and
controls the network receptions and the surveillance and management of its
citizenry, is not going to allow them to be receiving any but the most
innocuous of American intellectual imports, ones not obviously and
immediately et alone long and slowly thought through to be associated with
the kinds of ideas that the Government does not want to have its own
citizens thinking.

        And amazingly, the American Government obviously feels the same way=
,
that it is being represented by a perfectly safe product that will be easil=
y
accepted and perhaps become rapidly and widely accepted and make inroads
into the immensity of the Chinese market which has forever been the biggest
dream of American entrepreneurs to conquer, or at least "get the foot insid=
e
the door of."



         The "failure" of the Cantos to "cohere" as a Totalizing system is
something that Pound shares with Einstein and the physicist's inability to
realize his lifelong quest for the Unified Field Theory. A lot of 20th
Century thought is concerned with finding "unifying" systems, slogans,
images, ideas, personages, fields, constructions. (Dr Bernstein's own work
and career is an example of a project of this kind, for instance.)  At the
same time, there are the immense collapses of systems, traditions,
territories, modes of thinking and art, and a shattering into fragments.
The tensions among these elements have grown greater since Pound's time, an=
d
so have, in Dr Bernstein's rather vague terms, "the fascist ideas that
infect his poetry and poetics" which "seep
unnamed into the orthodox cultural theory and criticism of this society."


     Personally, I think those fascist ideas are present not only in Pound
and orthodox "cultural theory and criticism," but throughout the vast field=
s
of American theory and criticism, no matter how "radical," "difficult,"  an=
d
"oppositional" they may see and say themselves to be.  If there's a really
distinguishing feature of American thinking and theory whether mainstream
or "aco-dominant" as Bob Grumman calls it, it's in an overall conformity an=
d
obeisance and fealty to figures of Authority in any given field. .


It is astounding at times to read through responses or reviews to certain
works or statements by recognized Authorities whether theyare artists,
poets, lawyers, polticians, economists, etc  If the person has a ceratin
degree of clout--the responses are overwhelmingly, unquestioningly not only
vavorable but almost embarasingly sychophantic and filled with a sense of
near "shock and awe" bedazzlement.  And if anyone dares to criticize the
Authority or even suggest that perhaps their performance was not
perfect--woe be unto them.  They have announced themselves as one of the
remaining actual humans stil hiding out in terror among the pods in an
Invasion of the Body Snatchers like society.


     Pound's example is interesting in this regard, for he sees the Roman
fasci reembodied in Mussolini and his own invoking of Confucius and various
American "alternative" or "suppressed" economists as a form of stability
opposed to the kinds of instability he sees in (then) contemporary New Deal
America.  In this he was  like another ultra-reactionary, Gertrude Stein,
who wanted to turn the clock back to before the first Roosevelt and was
living in France quite well through the War due to a collaborationist close
friend and admirer. Stein didn't approve of America's economic policies any
more than did Pound, and was perfectly satisfied to live the good life in a
collaborationist supported expatriate fashion as was EP.
       The difference between the two is that Pound was willing to openly
fight via propaganda of the word against his country and make an appeal to
its soldiers to come over to the Fascist side.  In short, he was an outrigh=
t
traitor, rather than a kind of distanced collaborator.


        Thanks to Alison for her comments re Pound on economics and
militarism--for ironically enough, isn't it borrowing and interest debts on
credit cards that are going through the roof for a huge number of Americans=
,
as well as the insane military-driven national debt?  A huge chunk of which
is owed to--China, of course!
          I think it might help perhaps to find ways out of the seemingly
endlessly repeated either/or's with Pound and his work to expand the range
of ways of examining these.  I think the connections with China especially
in today's world are very interesting to think on. An issue which is relate=
d
with the Chinese influences in Pound is of course translation=97or mis and
perhaps dis translation, via his self proclaimed ability to read the
ideograms directly, without any prior knowledge, as well as the ways in
which he employed Fenollossa's  own misreadings and mistranslations as
gospel truths.

       It is interesting to note, as always in cross-cultural exchanges, ho=
w
much that is considered "truth" may well be based on the development throug=
h
time of an accidental or deliberate "untruth," that is, a mis or
distranslations.  It is in this area that translation and interpretations o=
f
Authority become reshaped to fit the needs of the one appropriating them, a=
s
well as causing, in a response in order to undo the negative effects, a
change in the original culture's language and images, in order to elude
these forms of appropriation, colonization and the Authoritative claims of =
a
rival. Foreign. proprietorship based on "evidences" which may or may not
have a relation with something which may or not have once existed.

The Chinese underwent a hideous, horrific and humiliating very long period
of colonialism and Imperialist foreign dominations and occupations, and one
wonders in what hopefully very interesting ways the cultural exchanges will
be affecting the partner nations. It will be interesting also to find out
how the Americans manage to present themselves as a "democracy" after two
rigged elections and the imperialist invasions of Iraq and Afghanistan and
their support for repressive regimes around the world

          In his working with the ideograms and the seeking a relationship
with a visual script outside of the English language, Pound is carrying on
the Emersonian era's fascination with the Egyptian hieroglyphs, making thei=
r
first appearances in tours in the United States just before the American
renaissance really began, and the later study of the Mayan hieroglyphs by
Charles Olson and to a lesser extent William S Burroughs.  This visual
poetry connection has led eventually beyond other languages and in to the
creation of asemic and Letrriste scripts, and vast proliferations of ways o=
f
presenting language without the use of words or alphabets.

        What is interesting with Pound is his seeing the Confucian side of
Disney=97an awareness of animation as a language of international
communication for the transmission of "right thinking" messages, and also
his making use of his own personal as well as Fenollossa's mistranslations
with which to create his own versions of an imagined "Cathay" and
"Confucius."  This imagined realm I do think may be examined via the
historcialAmerican ways of framing China and as well within the context of
Said's Orientalism and the history of the oppression of China via
Westernized images of Chinese traditions and existence projected on to the
Chinese, and how in turn Chinese have responded.

Is Pound's understanding of the Confucian side of Disney a sinister insight
into Control via mass media in the guise of imagery at the time associated
with children primarily?  Or is he thinking of a benign and instructive
introduction into the ethical ways of living life best suited to the
structures of the society?



 I also think that fascism itself needs to be defined in the discussions as
it is not always very clear what persons mean by the term.  For example, Dr
Bernstein uses the word a lot, without ever making it very clear what
exactly he means by it. It seems to be more of a floating collection of
stereotypes than carefully analyzed and understood varieties of methods for
developing what is currently taking shape in the USA--a  State more and mor=
e
concentrated in the figure of the Chief Executive, and in the closest
alliance with the globalized corporations which increasingly are given the
privatized tasks of what used to be the functions of the government--the
military, National Security, Disaster Reconstruction, Management and
Accounting, records keeping, surveillance, the policing of borders, the
construction and guarding of interior gated communities and Green Zones, th=
e
 privatizing of the education system, the lack of health care and the
massive transfer of public funding into the hands of an ever smaller group
of ever more powerful people.
        Due in large part to its name, National Socialist Workers Party,
there is thought to have been a "socialist" element in Nazism.  (Critics on
the Right like Jonah Goldberg use this to link Nazism to liberalism.)  Yet,
as Michael Parenti has pointed out, the actual treatment, wages and laws
governing workers in Nazi Germany were anything but Socialist.  Wages
declined under the Nazis, there was no right to unionize, strike, organize
in any way outside of the Party, and harsh punishments were carried out for
minor infractions in order to make sure the workers understood their
complete loss of individuality and individual freedoms in the service of th=
e
corporate-state's militarized industries.

        It was not Socialism which Nazism most resembled, but the current
state of a great deal of the American economy as applied at home and abroad=
,
with its dependence on slave labor, the abolish of as many unions as
possible, the removal of as many constraints and safety restrictions as
possible, the seizure of lands and fuel by force, and the control of
countries through the manipulation of debt=97al these weapons used aboard b=
y
the American economists that have returned in a blowback effect.

 One of the reasons I think fascism needs to be reexamined in this light is
that fascism itself does not automatically guarantee the presence of
anti-Semitism, as Dr Bernstein and those he quotes seem to assume it does.
  The United States is becoming a corporate-State fascist society with ever
more surveillance and control over every aspect of the life of not only its
citizens at home and aboard but of basically any person on the planet's
human and civil rights, which have been effectively cancelled if they are
merely designated as a terrorist or enemy combatant, regardless of evidence
or lack there of.

And the fascist state that the USA is becoming has as its sworn-to greatest
ally the state of Israel.  The descriptions by and quoted by Dr Bernstein o=
f
the Jews in relation to Pound can just as well be given for the Palestinian=
s
in relation to the Israelis, or the American Indians in relation to the
Federal Government.

    After all, aren't the Palestinians, Bedouins, American Indians routinel=
y
depicted as?

 'an
indistinct, rootless, destructive mass' eroding the agrarian ideal of
homestead, of nature and private property (values Pound equates with
order, clarity, telos). "

Golda Meier in 1969 famously said that "there never was such a thing as a
Palestinian."

Is not this "never such a thing" as a Palestinian or an Indian of the
Americas North and South, that indeterminacy which Bernstein quotes Casillo
writing of in terms of?

'Pound turned to Fascism because he shares
not only its deep fear of indeterminacy' -- of the vague, inchoate, and
incommensurable, of all that is mysterious or ambiguous or unknown --
'but also its central desire, which is to banish the indeterminate from
social life ...

Yet Casillo, rather than perceiving the really immense dangers of the
attraction of fascism to any one at all, limits it, meaning that anyone
other than an anti-Semite is not able to be a fascist. Yet how many fascist
dictatorships has not the USA supported whose raging hatreds were directed
at the Indians, the peasants, the working class, the students and the
Unions?

Casillo finishes:

 And as in Fascism, in Pound's work the ultimate sign of
such fearful [indefiniteness] is the Jew.'


Yet how many fascist dictatorships has not the USA supported whose raging
hatreds were directed at the Indians, the peasants, the working class, the
students and the Unions?

And who are the most hated of the new American fascism's enemies?  The
Muslim=97and the Mexican, the illegal immigrants.

I think to truly understand the role that fascism plays in our lives today,
fascism needs to be understood as an ideology which is capable of being
perfectly independent of anti-Semitism.  This is not to deny at all the
historical connections between many fascisms and anti-Semitism.  Rather, it
is to expand the understanding and examination of fascism as an ideology
which can be made use of by anyone, by any society choosing to construct
itself almost solely along the lines of "National Security" and the
permanent state of war that is the Global War on Terror.

I think in Pound's attraction there is much more going on than the
Authoritarianism of fascism.  There is the great influence throughout his
work of Confucius and his readings in the Chinese classics in poetry and
philosophy.  In this regard, Pound was very much part of an overlooked time
in American cultural history that is its first efforts to translate and
understand Japanese and Chinese poetry and philosophy.  It was during this
same period that in China and Japan the firth major influences of Western
art and literature and philosophy are being put into action.  These trans
cultural exchanges a century ago are today creating ever constantly wider
reaching contexts, in which Pound's work, with all its faults in translatio=
n
and understandings, interpretations, may be examined as having played an
important part, from at least an American and European perspective, and wha=
t
one begins to learn of the Chinese perspective may indeed greatly effect th=
e
Western ideas of Pound's work.

 I think that the very great and grave danger in shifting fascism solely to
a relationship with blatant anti-Semitism is that this diverts one from
seeing the fascism in one's own society, one's own everyday life, and in th=
e
manipulations of one's regarding what indeed fascism itself is.  For if the
definition precludes its happening here or among our allies, then, indeed,
this makes the fascist takeover of the society  as legal and out in the ope=
n
as Hitler's was in the beginning.

For it would not be, and has not been, recognized as fascist.

 George Bush twice has employed tactics in elections shadier than Hitler
used to get into power.  Yet as Leonard Peltier says, no one says anything.
Each day new laws are passed which strip away more freedoms, more
possibilities of asking questions, more and more persons feel it is far
better to just take the word of experts, authorities, "leading figures," an=
d
the like.  No one is even questioning why it is the Chinese might find
Language Poetry so harmless in such a tightly controlled society, or why it
is Americans continue to think they are possessed of a "radical" poetry, le=
t
alone an "innovative" one?

And why the interest in China on the part of scholars and poets who are not
Chinese scholars or translators?  Again, one wonders if it not the ever
present American Chinese dream of vast untapped markets, endless areas of
exploitation awaiting.  And it will be tacitly agreed that on no one's part
will there be any criticism of each other's control and surveillance
obsessed regimes.

I think that in these contexts there is yet a very great deal more to be
thought about in regards to Pound, to American Orientalism and the cross
cultural exchanges between China and America and Europe, as well as how
these are re-inflected through the immense shifts in the economic
relationships among the countries.  This is a period of great shifts and it
requires I think a greater openness and awareness of the ranges of such
questions as fascism and poetry than have so far really been much examined
in the United States.  For after all in our fascist times, in what ways has
the language of poetry being saying nothing, or saying things which are way=
s
of avoiding saying things which need to be said?

   In what ways has Pound been an example for American poetries of every
kind and in what ways has his work been used to cut off the asking of
various questions which would uncomfortably reveal the forms of competing
Authoritarianism and control which seek to use Pound to their own advantage
in breaking down various aspects of poetry and its canon they do not approv=
e
of.  In a bizarre way, by using Pound as an anti-Semitic fascist, is it not
possible to be creating a kind of fascism that is intended to be the revers=
e
of his?

And yet is it not always fascism, whether anti or pro Semitic, anti or pro
American anti or pro Chilean, Uruguayan, Brazilian, Guatemalan=97

Is it not always fascism, the same, the same corporate state structure, the
same elimination of interior enemies, the same Authoritarianism and hatred
of indigenous peoples?

Isn't what happens in Gaza a form of ethnic-cleansing fascism of
"indeterminate" "never such a things" all too familiar around the world?

Has not throughout the Americas the person to be eliminated been the Indian=
?
And by defining fascism as anti-Semitic is this a way to climate even
farther from being and thought the presence of the Indian and the fact of
the genocide of the Indians?

I think if you listen to Pound, his hate can be heard in the voices today
from the screens and speakers and in the newspaper, bogs, journals, which
rave about the Muslims, the illegal immigrants, immigrants in general, abou=
t
the  poor people of all colors, about the filthy, stupid Indian, the
insanity of the world's leaders with the exception of our own and Israel an=
d
England's, and the duty above all to conform, to obey Authority, to do as
one is told and think within the box, to write by a certain set of paradigm=
s
and above all really--
I mean really=97say nothing which in any way does not conform with what one
has been told is allowed by the Authorities=97

What do you think this is anyway=97a free country?

Like an alchemist hell bent on changing lead into gold, Daniel Sendecki
labored long hours over the creation of the Small Press Exchange,
designed especially for self-publishers with a hankering for
self-promotion.  It's a kind of myspace and it includes a bookstore.
Members are encouraged to blog, review each others' books and cook up
promotion schemes for their efforts.  Google it up and join in the fun.
(Don't forget to shout Wahoo! when you feel empowered!)  It had a
pretty good listing of readings in the Toronto area but that's fallen
by the wayside recently.  Dan wanted to keep it separate from our
efforts at Ahadada Books, though it exists on the same server.  Wahoo!
Wahoo! There's even a membership drive!  Jess of Japan (one tick north
of Lafayette, Louisiana).

Hi Steve, whom I don't know--

Yeah, great point! So how many more Rosenbergs should have been murdered by
the state? Just Pound, or how many others?

Eager to hear your murderous suggestions. You sound like a jolly dude.

I find that what Amy is saying here is serious and has to be taken into
consideration. He was sick, as Jason states, as much as the entire world wa=
s
sick, or better the ones that fomented the 2nd World War and allowed it to
break out. Pound was conscious of his position in the world of letters, he
was the one who promoted Imagism and modernism, had contact _or better
'made' _European poetry, and probably all the arts at the time (thanks to
him Vivaldi was revalued), corresponded with intellectuals in China and in
Japan, was personally received by Mussolini who commented favorably on his
Cantos and wanted to meet him on the following day, which did not happen
because on the next day Mussolini was called to sign the entrance of Italy
in the war. Times were hot. He spoke in English on the Italian radio, maybe
understood by 50 people _to be very optimistic. He was coming from the
States where he had tried his best to keep the U.S.A. out of the war.
It is true that he told Ginsberg in an interview in Venice that he regrette=
d
what he had said against the Jews, but it is also true that the first
picture they took of him when he landed in Italy after his stay at St.
Elizabeth's depicts him with his right fist in the air. And that Olson, as
someone already said, stopped visiting him at St. E. because disgusted by
his continuous remarks against the Jews, as much as he was a close friend o=
f
Zukofsky (there is a very nice anecdote by him).
Pound is an incredible mixture of angelic and diabolic. I also wanted badly
to have answers, to find him redeemed somewhere in history but that is not
the way it is.
He was caught in what was defined, as I already said elsewhere, a delirium
of power supported by his economic theories. His position at the time was
exceptional, be it intellectual or in terms of contacts. As a matter of fac=
t
he thought he was much more powerful than he actually was.  In  his
ingenuity he confused  knowledge and personal charisma with politics.
There should be some medical reports at St. Elizabeth's. I never went
through them, I don't know if they are public. On the other hand, what kind
of medical report could any one of us have after having been kept in a cage
for about a month, and treated as if we were mad in the midst of a world
war?
It anyhow makes me laugh that on anthologies we find The Waste Land by
Eliot, revised by Pound and we cannot find Pound.

Maria and Nick raise important points. Perhaps the phrase "misunderstood
poet Ezra Pound" that appears in the title of The Independent's review
refers to Pound's criticisms, in The Cantos, of what the reviewer calls
"anti-democratic capitalism": i.e. Pound's criticisms of "anti-democratic
capitalism" have been "misunderstood." But this also needs to be
questioned. What the review's elliptical language irresponsibly enables a
reader to presuppose is that, were Pound's criticisms properly
"understood," The Cantos or Pound would come off as being "for" something
either like "democratic capitalism" or "democratic anti-capitalism." The
latter two options form one of the binaries of journalese today (hence
Pound is "really like us liberals," if only we "understood" him, and
fascism, then and now, need never be addressed, let alone "understood").

Why does this listserve so often remind me of a right wing AM radio
call-in show? Fascinating how when Pound's advocacy of pogroms and
systematic assassinations is even *mentioned*, certain people (was it
really 8?) jump up to ensure that those considerations are not really
connected in any meaningful way to Pound's "work" or the reception of
his work -- and that bringing that up as meaningful is in fact a good
way to be pretentiously called simplistic and dismissive.

I return from a weekend of poetry in Chicago with friends to find a
welter of indignant responses to the suggestion that Pound's canonicity
is about power, legitimation, and fetish rather than Pound as genius,
progenitor, misunderstood and emotionally complicated father.

I learned from this flurry of indignation that by refusing to teach
Pound as an object of adulation, I am dismissing him. I learn that I am
simplistic to explore Pound in relation to structures of literary power.

Yes, how simplistic of me to try to show my students that Pound's
consecration was a function of many different dynamics, including the
sociology of author-as-fetish, the manufacture and use of symbolic goods
in academe, repeated attempts to elide class and racial hatreds, the
effacement of anti-semitism, the history of fascism's relation to
aesthetics, and the erasure of the ways symbolic capital is produced and
policed in small literary communities. How simplistic of me.

How ridiculous of me to suggest to students that a more instructive set
of footnotes to, say, /The Pisan Cantos/ isn't merely Sieburth's
apologetic, almost comically Nabokovian apparatus, but instead
Sieburth's elisions and excuses taught in tandem with Leonard Doob's
transcriptions of EP's radio speeches. How foolish of me to encourage
students to not simply believe Sieburth's celebration of Pound, but to
consider Siebuth's position as an actor with a vested economic interest
in deploying a specific rhetoric designed on the one hand to augment and
mystify his object of study and on the other to reframe if not outright
efface its more horrifying aspects. And to show that Sieburth's tactics
are not peculiar to him alone but are evidence of a common structural
tactic deployed by many others in 1946, 1951, 1954, 1957, 1963, 1971,
1977, 1983, 1996, 2001, 2003, 2008 (and just yesterday on this list).

In fact, how dare I use Pound as a case study by which to examine the
sociology of the belief in charismatic legitimation. How dare I use
Pound to study the sociology of literature:

I should be using Pound to study Pound. This is about venerating
authors, not helping students understand the world.

Pound should be studied to study the greatness of Pound.

Pound was begotten, not made!

Interesting, too, to see all the posts seeking condescendingly to remind
me that Pound is complex. Hmm, ahh!, how could I have somehow missed
that Pound was complex? Maybe I just need to read Canto XIII again.
Gosh, I must have missed all of his trenchant economic ideas and his
sociopolitical critique and how they suggest the evils of oligarchy
capitalism, war, and the military-industrial complex.

Alison -- in a telling example of a common trope used by celebrants and
believers -- actually goes so far as to call his thoughts on these
points "prophecies."

These "prophecies" were ideas cribbed from numerous sources. Further,
they were descriptions of conditions already inhering, not those to
come. Calling them prophecies is a convenient way of diverting not only
any deeper understanding of EP's rhetoric, but also how deliberate he
was in the construction of his texts, as well as his construction of
himself as an author. For example, his "prophecies" about the arms race
were in part cribbed from Charles Trevelyan, circa 1914.

Alison's suggestion that I "focus so narrowly on dynamics of power that
they obscure the experience of the poetry itself" is an interesting
attempt to reformulate my post. "Poetry itself." If it is narrow to
encourage students toward a disciplined understanding of a host of
phenomena surrounding a text, rather than just pretending to a pure
exegesis and appreciation of the text-qua-text, then I'm narrow. What I
refuse to do is credit the unexamined existence of a "poetry itself,"
which Alison speaks of. I've frankly never been able to find this mythic
"poetry itself" Alison speaks of. I've found a few "poetries
themselves," each one, for better or worse, wholly invested in a system
of symbolic goods and social profit -- and the worst and most dishonest
systems are those that perform a pretense of aesthetic autonomy by
insisting on a "poetry itself."

Regarding Canto XIII. To whomever it was who suggested I just need to
read XIII again in order to get my head screwed on straight: If that bit
of orientialism is somehow meant to serve as self-evidence of EP's
greatness, very good, enjoy your orientalist postcard. Enjoy your
everlasting thirteenth cookie.

But literature isn't my religion. And if its yours: good, enjoy it. But
stay off my porch with your pamphlets. I don't teach religion. And I
don't buy yours, Mr. Eliot.

My word. Is literature as a religion really this alive and well (read
necrotic and festering)?

Where's my Nicene creed?

Best,

Gabe

This morning I had a burning idea. What if the reviews journal of
self-published books, objects and ephemera were to coincide with a free
distributor? The name kept rolling around in my head - No Press
Distribution, or NPD. I think it would be best to outline such potential
projects here, and hope to get feedback from members of the community.

No Press Distribution
"Pressless is Priceless"

1. First we begin by soliciting members of the poetry community for
self-published books, pamphlets, chapbooks, objects, ephemera, etc.

2. We collect these publications in a database which will eventually
become a web-based distributor like Small Press Distribution. I will build
a website and update consistently. NPD will collect no fees for sales
(we're not a consignment venture - god forbid!)

3. There will be an option for each title for on-line reviews, similar to
the amazon.com model. I'm not sure what kind of period the physical
journal of reviews will be distributed, but I think it would be conducive
to saving paper if I create a CD-Rom version of the review journal, or
keep it strictly web-based. In this case, ANYONE can review titles. I
believe this option will be more democratic and expansive.

4. Each title will be linked to info about how to purchase or obtain it.
There will be no central "housing"; the web-based distributor is merely a
central catalogue. All business is directed toward the individual.

5. Naturally, no fees will be amassed by me, or anyone managing the
web-content, catalogue, etc.

6. I do ask, though, that anyone who wants to submit titles for
cataloging/review should send a copy to me.

This is the basic skeleton. Firstly, I am trying to build a databse of
people who want to send me materials. Let's try something first.

1. Send me an electronic copy (pdf, doc, rtf) of the description of the
material(s) along with a scanned image/photo (if possible) of it/them.

2. Send me your name and address if you'd like to be informed about future
updates to reviews/catalogue.

Please write me if you have any questions. Any help is crucial and highly
desired...

Subject:      Re. Pound
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"; format=flowed

I've been following the Pound discussion--let me add a couple of
cents.  In Uncertain Poetries (Salt 2005), I have an essay, "The
Narrative of Ezra Gorgon Pound," which a bit tongue in cheek suggests
reading the Cantos as a 'gothic,' so as to get at how Pound's ideas
about history and politics are deeply entwined in his technique--it
includes a bit of a rejoinder to my good friend Charles's "Pounding
Fascism."  I post this excerpt from the book, since it gets at the
nub of the argument the way I see it:

"We might usefully compare Pound's troping of history with the
poetics of poets such as George Oppen or Robert Duncan for whom
historical contingency is continually registed in the voice,
suggesting that history can never be entirely read as 'the past', nor
as the present either, and so, in order to be meaningful for the
present, must be passed through an active vocalizing subject.  In
Oppen or Duncan, the strata of history as a series of weights on the
being of the poet, no longer remain discrete but are cumulative and
so prevent anything as straightforward as Confucist re inscription of
historical maxims.  At the sama time, conscious revisionism or
admittance of known error are luxuries these poets must deny
themselves; in Duncan's case, because the event or its linguistic
signature is the gateway for entrance into a living past which is all
process continually working itself out in times and individuals; in
Oppen's, because today's word is burdened with the totality of
historical knowledge.  Their 'vigilance' is of an entirely different
order from that of Pound's.
              I want to conclude my discussion with a brief look at
what we can say about Pound's methodology in terms of present day
practice of poetry.  My spring board is a recent essay by Charles
Bernstein in Sulphur entitled "Pounding Fascism" in which Bernstein
attempts to save Pound the technician from Pound the fascist.  Let me
say at once, that I suspect the motive behind this essay has less to
do with Pound than with Bernstein's revising of literary history in
an attempt to valorize, it would seem, language centered writing as
it leans on or is beholden to Poundian poetics.
             Bernstein begins with the claim that Pound's fascism,
"far from hindering the canonization of his poetry by American
literary culture, has been a major factor in its acceptance. (C.
Bernstein, 99)"  Now I know of few mainstream or establishment
studies of Pound that support this view the very places it ought to
be encountered if Bernstein is correct; in fact, the 'technical' side
of Pound is what is praised in even as conservative a critic as
Blackmur who, en passant, insists that even as we admire Pound's
craft, we ought to drop the notion of Pound as a thinker or literary critic.
              Bernstein goes on to say, and this is the crucial
issue, that he does not "equate Pound's politics with Pound's
poetry.   The Cantos, and other of Pound's work, are in many ways
basically at odds with the tenets of Pound's fascist ideals. (C.
Bernstein, 99)"  They are at odds, according to Bernstein, because
"the 'hyperspace' of Pound's modernist collage is not a predetermined
Truth of a pan cultural elitism but a product of a compositionally
decentered multiculturalism...a polyvocal textuality...the result of
his search for deeper truths than could be revealed by more
monadically organized poems operating with a single voice and a
single perspective. (C. Bernstein, 100)"
             Now it is most probably the case that if Pound were a
maker of 'monadically organized' poems, if he had written in the
style of D'Annunzio for example, few in the American literary
establishment would have insisted on his canonization.  On the other
hand, if one perceives The Cantos as something like a gothic, its
'multiculturalism" is an illusion, its "polyvocal textuality" a
chorus of foreign sounding voices all mouthing the same rules and
verities.  If you accept this point of view, then Bernstein's
analysis leaves one major question still begging, the one I have
tried to develop in this paper: whether Poundian techniques, in
particular the cultural plundering, revising and activity of
selection induced by the search for history's repeats, the absence of
a clearly defined authorial voice, tend to undermine fascist
tendencies or aid in furthering them.
             At this point, my own answer to the question must be
necessarily quite tentative, but my argument goes something like
this: Recent studies of the aesthetics of fascism (such as
Friedlander's mentioned above) acknowledge not only the fascist need
for rigidity, its fears of social and cultural disorder, but also
demonstrate how fascism creates imagery and phantasms and other
machinery for the generation of fear and anxiety in order to maintain
itself.  These are what Elias Canetti, in speaking about fascism,
calls "the adjacency of construction and destruction".
             The mechanisms of fascism not only respond to the
indeterminate but use it, feeding it back into the social system,
creating anxiety and paranoia in order to maintain and accomplish
political purposes.  Friedlander describes this as "the fusion of
kitsch and death" where through aesthetic devices, anxiety and
authority are everywhere and nowhere, a blend of domestic, mythic and
archaic materials which produce a disembodied gotterdammerung of
calculated effects.
             I would suggest that The Cantos, seen as a gothic,
approximate, on the linguistic level, this technology of
fascism.  Pound, as he selects from history and rewrites where
necessary, may in fact be operating his own Orwellian Ministry of
Truth (or as Plato would probably call it, The Ministry of Poetry).
             For what most effectively maintains a totalitarian state
of mind is not unassailable logic but unassailable 'thought'.  And
thought is first of all unassailable when 'authorship' is put in
doubt, when history seems like a series of repeats, and texts are no
longer the products of writers but historical inevitabilities.  The
sense of historical inevitablity, as both Froula and Michael Andre
Bernstein point out, is precisely what Pound sets out to achieve
through his maskings and erasures of authorship.  And it is this
troublesome legacy which has been raised to an unexamined and
somewhat mystical status in much contemporary theory of writing and reading.
             As in the gothic, Pound's poem has elided the very rule
of 'sincerity' he set for himself.  For sincerity demands in a sense
accountability, and accountability demands an author or voice.   The
Cantos like Pym, obscures authorship, not because of its polyvocal
texture, but because the gothic form must trade, not on believability
but on a vicarious believability, the emotional conviction that this
dangerous stuff called history is safely happening to you.  The
gothic thrall, the fictive aura of terror inspired by Poe's stories,
is close to the dramaturgy of Pound's poem with its parade of
decisive heroes performing their deeds.   I would add that these
kinds of emotional tonalities may not be far from that which the
Leader creates when he tells the crowd how powerful it is and its
members believe it."  --Michael Heller

Dear Michael,

You claim that Bernstein's "revising literary history" (a claim you also don't explain) is an attempt to 'valorize language centered writing' -- I'm not trying to be provocative here & I read your excerpt, but I just don't understand what you base this assumption on or why.  Did you arrive at this conclusion simply by association?

Also, your argument on Pound seems to require an either/or position -- Either Pound's poetry uses the authorial voice of 'fascist aesthetics' successfully or it legitimately uses the polyvocal textuality that supports/explores the indeterminate and its uncertain possibilities (& becomes a gothic?).  You state that using the former -- the "technology of fascism" ("The
mechanisms
of
fascism
not
only
respond
to
the indeterminate
but
use
it, feeding
it
back
into
the
social
system, creating
anxiety
and
paranoia
in
order
to
maintain
and
accomplish political
purposes.") - renders the indeterminate an "illusion", either making the implications and repercussions of indeterminacy invisible or absorbing indeterminacy for its own fascist use.

... As if contradictions can't co-exist, as if readers don't selectively celebrate and promote, esp conservative ones as you named, one style over another - willfully ignoring other styles employed and the effects they have - while also quietly using the politics of the co-existing style to explore & dip a toe into that forbidden pond ... Pound's fascism betrays his poetic intent as he used the polyvocal to query and explore *despite* his focus on authorial proclamations and certainties to establish a "phallic order" (Pound's term)  ... What, and moreover, *How* we hate reveals and speaks volumes, sometimes betraying us and that coherent/concrete facade we're so intent on constructing, even despite what we say we're trying to sell ...

The cracks and fissures and bubbles and behind-the-scenes and oh-my-slip eventually start showing ...

Someone asked me to give an example of how politics can inform poetry, and while I'm no good at critical explanation, esp any attempt to expound on Pound - ha - the following excerpt from Robert Graves' and Laura Riding's A SURVEY OF MODERNIST POETRY might elucidate, not so favorably, a bit:

"...indeed a great deal of what passes for poetry is the rewriting of the prose summary of a hypothetical poem in poetical language.  Before further discussing this particular poem, let us quote the beginning of a ballad by Mr. Ezra Pound in illustration of the prose-idea poeticalized:

THE BALLAD OF THE GOODLY FERE
(Simon Zelotes speaketh it somewhile after the crucifixion)

Ha' we lost the goodliest fere o' all
For the priests and the gallows tree?
Aye, lover he was of brawny men
O' ships and the open sea.

When they came wi' a host to take Our Man
His smile was good to see,
"First let these go!" quo' our Goodly Fere,
"Or I'll see ye damned", says he.

Aye, he sent us out through the crossed high spears,
And the scorn of his laugh rang free,
"Why tood ye not me when I walked about
Alone in the town?" says he.

Oh, we drank his "Hale" in the good red wine
When we last made company,
No capon priest was the Goodly Fere
But a man o' men was he.

I ha' seen him drive a hundred men
Wi' a bundle o' cords swung free
When they took the high and holy house
For their pawn and treasury ....

Stripped of its imitated antiqueness, the substance of all this could be given simply as follows:  "It would be false to identify the Christ of the sentimentalists with the Christ of the Gospels.  So far from being a meek or effeminate character He strikes us as a very manly man, and His disciples, fishermen and others, must have reverenced Him for His manly qualities as much as for His spiritual teaching.  His action in driving money-changers from the Temple with a scourge of cords is a proof of this.  So is His courageous action when confronted by the soldiers of the High Priest sent to arrest Him--He mockingly enquired why they had not dared arrest Him previously when He walked about freely in the city of Jerusalem, and consented to offer no resistence only if His disciples were allowed to escape.  The Last Supper was surely a very different scene from the Church Sacrament derived from it, where a full-fed priest condescendingly officiates; it was a
 banquet of friends of which the Dearest Friend was Our Saviour."  Here we see that the poeticalization has in fact weakened the historical argument.  By using the ballad setting Mr. Pound has made the fishermen of Galilee into North-country sailors of the Patrick Spens tradition and given them sentiments more proper to the left wing of the Y.M.C.A."  ...

Gabe,


No one is attacking you for teaching your class and the approach taken. In
fact, who would dare argue that teaching The Cantos in conjunction with more
sources wouldn't be beneficial to students?

Dear Louis---

Thanks for that journalistic clarification,
If Fascism's primary definition is the merger of state and corporate
power
(or even the subordination of the former to the latter), then
"anti-democratic capitalism" (or corporatism) seems a very fitting
characterization
of fascism (to say nothing of the contemporary American cultural/
economic situation).
Whether or not this has anything to do with Pound I'll leave to the
self-proclaimed Poundians
and Pound apologists....

Dear David--

Who wrote this article? The idea that 60 American poets celebrated
Dr. Perloff
becoming the new MLA President (with CB as their spokesperson) in the
wake
of Hussein's murder is.....interesting.
A better word than interesting?  Hilarious? Scary?  Absurd? Sneaping?
Is the analogy accurate? In a way no, but in a way yes---

Against the backdrop of the severed Hussein head, there's Haliburton/
blackwater regime
and Marjorie Perloff.
(as if the old MLA "cultural studies" regimes were like Hussein)...

Of course, if CB is to be believed, I'm just writing about 29
December 2006
as a "Work of Art," here, and not trying to "extract sociological or
historical information from" it--

Yet, even though the Dead Saddam image's cultural relevance may be
tangential to the main point of this article,
and to the politics of the MLA (and was used by Bush et al to 'wag
the dog' for Iraqis and Americans),
if we consider this article a 'work of art,' it becomes an effective
journalistic device....

I don't really agree with the academic either/or binary between
"Cultural Studies" and "Poetics,"--
If that is, indeed, the "two party system" that dominates the
academic/literary landscape today
(and I bet that Bernstein would still claim room for 'cultural
studies' in his idea of poetics,
though Perloff, like Vendler, is a formalist---and both are Pound
apologists
(though diffferent forms of Pound...and much intraparty wrangling has
been known to occur over this)

I'm glad you bring up Baraka as an alternative; another "third party
candidate" who goes beyond
the "Cultural Studies" (Saddam Hussein supported by the U.S. Gov't in
the 1980s?)
and "Poetics" (the Haliburton/Blackwater regime....)...
and I'm glad it wasn't he who was hanged on that cold December 29th
of 2006...

"be a spirit, not a ghost"

Chris








On 29 December 2006, Saddam Hussein was hung in Baghdad , and, outside
Philadelphia,  at an MLA "off site" reading, roughly 60 American poets
celebrated each other s works, and Dr Marjorie Perloff's becoming the
new
President of the MLA, With Dr Perloff's Presidency, the general
consensus
was that   the long dark ages of cultural studies were over with, and
a new
era of focus on poetics would begin.

  "What we're interested in is talking about these works as works of
art,
rather than extracting the sociological or historical information from
them",

Gabe, if you misread Pound as badly as you misread me, then I feel sorry for
your students. Where did I say anywhere that Pound's poetry is not connected
meaningfully with his politics? Or that one should ignore or elide those
politics? Nowhere, in fact. I was arguing for a reading of Pound which fully
takes these into account. (I also agree that Pound "constructed himself as
an author", which is why I am interested in those fractures).

But this feels like bait and switch: If you had originally said, instead of
calling Pound an "abomination" and an "asshole" who writes a "poetry of
hatred", that you  "try to show my students that Pound's consecration was a
function of many different dynamics, including the sociology of
author-as-fetish, the manufacture and use of symbolic goods in academe,
repeated attempts to elide class and racial hatreds, the effacement of
anti-semitism, the history of fascism's relation to aesthetics, and the
erasure of the ways symbolic capital is produced and policed in small
literary communities," we might have had a different conversation. Though
rather than circling narrowly in on the what you call the politics of
literary and academic consecration - something in which I have no interest
at all, being neither religious nor any kind of academic - I think it might
be more interesting to look at the politics of the west as a whole and
examine how Pound uneasily resonates within post war assimilations of
fascism, maybe through Adorno.

But if the point of your teaching is to show that Pound's poetry is
worthless, that in fact one shouldn't read Pound in order to study Pound,
but merely as a political symptom, then we part company.  The reasons that
poetry matter to me are complex and in the end personal. The poetic excess
that remains in Pound's work after all these critical examinations is maybe
the more troubling factor in Pound's work: how much easier life would be if
one could prove that Pound's poetry is only a function of a whole lot of
ugly politics, and that any admiration of his work is an act of bad faith
made by those who would preserve their own privilege. Maybe because I've
spent my whole life reading poets who sideline my sex and my poetical,
emotional, political and even my physical existence, and whose poetry
nevertheless stirs, illuminates and inspires me, I am more used to
negotiating these kinds of differences. No, I don't think all literature is
an expression of power: I think the reverse, in fact, that there is in
literature, in poetry, and even in Pound's most problematic writing, an
abnegation of power that I find much more interesting. You can construe that
how you will.

Best

David and Chris,

This kind of 'criticism' feels a bit opportunistic and pointless ... first, who stopped their day short when Saddam Hussein was, unbeknownst to the American public, hanged?  I didn't even hear about it until the nightly news.  Should I have foreseen the event and stopped teaching my Writing Poetry class earlier that evening?


Second, the quote from the MLA event does not exclude the kind of inquiry Bernstein outlines in "Pounding Fascism" -- he did not say, "We will not teach students to consider the sociological and historical effects on poetry or vice versa."  What he did say is something that is taught in most basic poetry courses, which is that we will study poems as works of art ("art" certainly does not exclude considerations of the influence of history and sociology), and we will not teach students to 'extract sociological information,' as in, we're not mining poems for facts ("information") and throwing the stylized husks away, but rather something more complex:  we'll study how poems function, create and sell what they seem to sell, how artifice illicits/solicits emotional and intellectual response, etc.  Nice mining for that quote though ...

What I find more compelling about this kind of reaching 'argument' is its frequency and that it seems to appear whenever Bernstein is mentioned as though he is some kind of pariah to be dealt blows on appearance alone ... I'd really like to know what it is about Language Poetry (I'm assuming this is an associative response) that is so threatening that a) everything he has written is blanketly stamped with disapproval and b) the mere mention of the man conjures an aggressive affront worthy of a murderer.  I should note that those who react to the mere mention of his name usually tend to be a rotating few.  But the vehemence ... it astounds me.  Usually when I don't agree with someone's politics and/or poetry, I say I don't like it, I might even go so far as to not like them and dismiss the entire package -- but I don't assume the attack position if they walk into the room, reach for the fact that he sneezed and then read it as an insult to validate my
 punch.  My experiences with Bernstein (studied with him, but moreover, read his books) have revealed a generous spirit -- he has promoted poets of all kinds of flavors and styles, he allows for a wide range of ideas and discourse in his classroom as an educator, he has given poets this platform to voice their opinions, disagree, including criticism of his own work -- but some of that criticism has extended to him as a person, and that's the part I don't get.  He has maintained this forum for many years now where I likely would have buckled.  So really, I guess I'm just wondering about the handful of poets here who go beyond criticizing his work to transparently misconstrue and attack him in a way that really speaks to the attackers' desires ...

Does anyone out in Listserv land know the issue of Sulfur that Michael Palmer's essay on Pound was in? I recall it was a fascinating discussion of the extreme rightwing scholarship that is attracted to Pound.

I suspect one reason that ND books never did a further volume of selected letters past the 1941 close of the existing book that, in addition to corresponding to Paul Blackburn, etc,. Pound was writing to such luminaries as George Lincoln Rockwell, founder of the American Nazi Party, and others who would surface in the 60s as leaders of the most extreme elements of the American Right. In fact, Rockwell and his ilk were regular visitors to Pound's room at St. Elizabeth.

So, what's a poet to do? As a younger writer, I was assured" by Allen Ginsberg, Denise Levertov and other poets w/ left-wing creditentials to ignore the politics and read the poetry. Exhibit "A" was Ginsberg's account of playing the Beatles and Donovan to the old poet and his comments of regret.

Then, the radio Broadcasts of Pound became available --making him the Allen Freed of Fascism w/ the scattered comments found here and there in cantos about Usury emerging as full-blown pathological anti-Semitism. Since then, much more stuff has emerged that has really changed his position among poets.

What to do? There is a whole segment of American poetry that ignores his poetry based on the rejection of his politics --I have in mind Stanley Kunitz and poets in his wide circle. The results is a poetry though high on moral efficacy is low in interest for those interested in innovative writing. The only poet in the mainstream who is vocal in his interest in Pound is Charles Wright.

Maybe Pound needs to be seen as an extreme view among a community of Modernists who were unembarrassed enough about their anti-Semitism to stick it in their poems (Eliot, Cummings), casually supported Fascism in their letters (Stevens), could refer to Alfred Steiglitz in print as that "dammed Jew from Hoboken' (WCW) or would just refuse to attend a party in honor of Langston Hughes (Tate and Robert Penn Warren).

Hello,

The Pound threads are very interesting and I'm looking forward to reading both
Zhaomin Qian and Michael Heller's books. _Cantos_ as Gothic? I like this idea.
I've been wondering how to introduce the location of Sermione into a discussion
of Pound's editorial imagination. That was where he edited _Wasteland_. A more
'Goth' locale there isn't.

Perhaps we might think about what Pound was consecrating instead of how we must
best consecrate Pound? A dialectic understanding of the man and his work still
seems the best for doing the latter.

I do wonder about what Pound was visioning forth. It changes it seems-

Riding and Graves' understanding of Pound's "Ballad of the Goodly Frere", its
"imitated antiqueness" and all, reminds me of George Steiner, where, in his
Babel book, he talks about the translationese of _Cathay_ and _The Seafarer_ as
being purposeful archaisms he used to instantiate putatively false and
alternative and virtual memories of what it is that had been unwritten in
history, to make the unwritten history present in his poetry, to make _The
Cantos_ a poem containing history.

"The translator can manipulate anachronisms for special effects"
(Steiner 367). Steiner discusses _Cathay_ and suggests that that Charlie
Chan tin-pan voice is used to create "a general phenomenon of hermeneutic
trust" with his readers out here in the far far west (377). Pound and his
readers conspire, Steiner says, through their ignorance, to learn something
new. The point though may not have been to learn much about China at all. Pound
accepted Fenollosa's manuscripts skeptically in Sarojini Naidhu's London
apartment. So it seems.

Steiner also argues that Celia and Louis Zukofsky's _Catullus_ is anything but
homage. Rather it is a linguistic collage that aims to "project possible
futures" (370). They learned this technique, Steiner suggests tacitly, I think,
by studying _Cathay_.

Consecration is a part of Pound's motive - but not its object. He
was an iconoclast first, non?

"We endure, we endure creatively due to our imperative ability to say 'No' to
reality, to build fictions of alterity, of dreamt or willed or awaited
'otherness' for our consciousness to inhabit. It is in this precise sense that
the utopian and the messianic are figures of syntax." (_After Babel_ xiv)

So when it comes to a question of what Pound was consecrating we could do worse
than to think about how he used translation.

Chris

Alison,

You seem publicly concerned that I misread you, so I'm replying to you
personally here.

You seemed concerned that my last post was addressed to you personally
-- and that it was accusing you personally of elisions regarding Pound.
My post was an omnibus reply to the many robust and sometimes empty
responses to this thread while I was away, yours among them. My post was
not a reading of you per se. Where my post mentioned your reading of
Pound as a prophet, I did quote you, yes. The bottom of my post -- in
which I did quote you characterizing Pound as a prophet and in which I
mark your notion as idealist, if not utopian, that poetry can exist as
"poetry itself" free from a "dynamics of power" -- also bears a
quotation from you. Beyond that, the reply was general.

But as to where I did mention you:

I hear your concern that EP be treated appropriately, that he be
understood as Author and Poet and Prophet, that he not be "dismissed,"
and that his "prophecies" (to use your word) be understood
"shorn of their Anti-semitism." (your phrasing)

I also hear you suggesting we "part company" if I read EP "merely as a
political symptom." I feel we do part company, yes, but not for that
reason: I do not feel he's "merely" a political excrescence.

We part company because I cannot adopt a specifically aesthetic
disposition regarding EP. So, no, I don't see him as a shaman, or a
sacred heretic, or a "conflicted vates" and certainly not as a prophet
uttering "prophecies." Especially if they are "shorn of their
Anti-semitism."

As for your concerns about my students: they can take care of
themselves, believe me. In part because of where they are in their
lifecourse, their familial and institutional subject positions make them
  particularly savvy at seeing through, and understanding the reasons
for, the host of myths about authorship proffered by the field. I learn
a great deal from them.

Best and be well,

Gabriel

PS. I was stuck, Alison, by this text from one of your posts.

"Maybe because I've spent my whole life reading poets who sideline my
sex and my poetical, emotional, political and even my physical
existence, and whose poetry nevertheless stirs, illuminates and inspires
me, I am more used to negotiating these kinds of differences."

I had one final question about gender. Specifically your thesis here
about how gender inflects and heightens your abilities to negotiate
"these kinds of differences." I find it fascinating that you seem to be
saying that the fact that you're a woman makes it easier for you to
overlook Pound's hatred of Jews, Slavs, Africans, African-Americans, and
his encouraging his listeners to murder Jews, bankers and political
leaders. Forgive me for asking if I'm way off base here, but it does
stand out as a curious thing to say -- is that what you're saying there?
I'm just not sure how to read that.

I'm quite tired Amy since it is already midnight here
but I will give you the answer even if quickly.
Your question is rhetorical and naive:
general envy, mistrust and so forth. Add to it whatever you wish of the
sort. Man is fundamentally lazy and belongs to the hypocritical species and
much worse (see Dante's Inferno) but hates the one who is able to rise above
the average and will do whatever he can to cut him out.
And if you continue as you have been doing since when I first met you, you
will follow the same fate.
What Gabe said before that this seems a bunch of fascists was not completely
out of order.
Hopefully you will receive more reassuring answers. I am done for the day.

Hi Gabe

I'm not sure how much we're understanding each other. Possibly not at all. I
am sure your students do manage perfectly well, but perhaps you might
understand my mistrust of your reading of Pound if you quote what I said so
wilfully and partially.

You distort my meanings seriously; for instance by taking out of context
what I said originally about the possible interest of reading Pound as a
counter-argument to the triumphalism of the post-war west, a hostile
critiquer who might, through all his spleen, have a couple of points that
are borne out in the western arms industry and financial markets, to suggest
that I am buying into the whole Poet-As-Seer business and, worse, seeking to
ignore and excuse his anti-Semitism. (OK, it was unwise to use the word
"prophecy", mea culpa - will foresight do?) And yet I am precisely
interested in the conflict that occurs in the collision between Pound as
aesthetic and political phenomenon. That is why I framed Pound as a dilemma
and a problem; not in order to fillet the poetry out of the political and
psychological tangle that Pound in fact is, but in order to attempt to see
the energies within that poetry more clearly. What bothers me about what
you're saying is that, unlike Bernstein, you don't address the poems _at
all_. It is possible to talk about Pound without speaking about the affect
and qualities of his poetry, of course, but I wonder what the point is; and
I am interested in poetry, and so want to talk about the poems. I don't know
what you mean by a "specifically aesthetic position", but to characterise my
admiration of his poetry - although, like all poets, he had his better and
worse days - as an embrace of the vatic seer means I have bizarrely
misexpressed myself, since what I actually think is so very far from that
position.

Why isn't it possible to read Pound as Olson read Melville, as an expression
of the American machine, in Pound's case perhaps a psychotic expression
which seems curiously aligned to the paranoia and psychosis of contemporary
US politics? Why is that desire read by you as an _excusing_ or
_overlooking_ of Pound's politics, when it is in fact the reverse? And even
if one did this - which is perhaps more to the point - how does this explain
the poetry? Isn't there something that eludes this framing, and that yet can
neither be ignored nor dismissed?  Is the fractured and radical beauty - I
know, unfashionable word, but that is what I mean - that Pound attained
simply an expression of his fascist politics? It doesn't really bear much
resemblance to the art - unambiguous, realist, uplifting - that the Nazis,
for instance, promoted. So what does it mean to say that the poetry is
fascist? There have been some interesting suggestions in this conversation,
but I wonder all the same...  Joel Lewis puts the problem well: "What to do?
There is a whole segment of American poetry that ignores his poetry based on
the rejection of his politics --I have in mind Stanley Kunitz and poets in
his wide circle. The results is a poetry though high on moral efficacy is
low in interest for those interested in innovative writing."

In relation to this question of uneasy politics: there's an exemplary essay
on Yeats and his fascist leanings by David Lloyd in his book Anomalous
States, which in beginning with the poetry itself - its "obsessive and
haunting quality" - doesn't, as you seem to be in your posts here, make an
argument to annihilate Yeats' poetry from the face of the earth as an
abomination, and yet is very clear about how fascist or authoritarian
thought wound through Yeats' aesthetic. Eg:

"All this is to suggest neither that we abandon political judgment to
aesthetic adoration nor that there is anything to be gained by simple
ethical condemnation... though I show that Yeats' authoritarian political
predelictions are as insistent as they they are consistent with his
aesthetic, that argument is of little avail when it comes to the attempt to
comprehend the obsessive, haunting quality of his poetry.... Insofar as the
ends of any state are questioned in the questioning of its beginning, Yeats'
insistent brooding on the issue of political and poetic foundation _holds
these questions open_ in a manner which continues to arrest our thinking."
(My emphasis).

Lloyd goes on to look at some poems in detail, and sketches Yeats's ideology
and aesthetic in relation to the emergence of the Irish state. It's an
argument that I can't summarise here, but which I think is deeply
illuminating. Towards the end, Lloyd says that the terror of Yeats' poetry
comes from the clarity of his recognition that death exists at the heart of
culture and in the base of the state. "If, as Walter Benjamin put it,
fascism is the 'aestheticisation of politics', Yeats' writings are
profoundly antagonistic to the the representational aesthetics in which
fascism finds its legitimation... but to recognise this is to recognise
equally the futility of any condemnation of Yeats' politics in the name of
representational democracy, for it is to the same symbolic aesthetic that
democratic states appeal for their own legitimation..."

Which is a pretty interesting paradox, and perhaps a parallel thought might
be pursued with Pound. For me, it's precisely this suspension, the "holding
open" of questions, the faultines and fractures and contradictions, that
interest me in Pound: he is, like most poets, least interesting when he
thinks he knows what he's doing, and most interesting when most conflicted.
But I guess it all depends what you want from poems. I don't seek ethical
certainty or political cleanliness. If I read and enjoy Milton (and I do)
that doesn't mean I subscribe to his ideas about women or that I become a
revolutionary puritan: I have a self with which I can engage this other
poetry. And I assume everybody else does. So I am not sure where you're
heading here Gabe - to the tribunals and Year Zero? Who is pure enough for
you?

My point about gender is a simple one. There are a large number of poets
from whom I have gained much from in my practice as a poet. However, I can't
read these poets without facing the fact that they subscribe to the gendered
prejudices of their time and sex and place. (Pick your poets, from Homer
on). I suppose you won't question that the vast majority of western poetry
has been male-oriented, reflecting and often promoting a male dominated
hierarchy, and you could argue that is still largely the case. I could, if I
were to follow your logic, throw all those poets out of the window, dismiss
all their poetics as irredeemably sexist and corrupted by patriarchal models
that are violent, authoritarian and have been consistently disempowering,
even murderous, to women. That would no doubt clear me of all ethical
difficulty, but it would leave me with very little poetry. On the other
hand, I could choose to engage with those poets whose work I admire in an
active dialogue, in which I am aware of these histories of violence and
disempowerment, and attempt to work out what it is that nevertheless moves
and stirs me in the poems that these people have made. That requires a
certain suppleness and stubbornness of relationship, a dance of refusals as
well as acceptances, most of all an acceptance that, while Poet X may be
male, he is also of the same species and - often - language, and we might be
said to have something in common as well as difference. Most of all, it
means that I am continually seeking to see those poetries as clearly as I
can, as works of art that I am encountering in a particular time and place,
which constellate particular effects and meanings that occur in interior and
personal ways, and that were written in specific historic and social
contexts that also condition - but do not determine - my own responses. Ie,
I'm talking about an open-ended and argumentative and uncertain process that
pursues curiosity rather than judgment.

Anyway, thanks for the provocation. I am not sure how interesting it might
be to anyone else to continue explaining myself, that can just get boring,
and I'd rather not bore. So I hope this is as clear as I would like it to
be.

Cheers

Alison

Like Chris suggests, "anti-democratic capitalism" can be taken in many
directions. I resort to a Marxian view that criticizing finance capitalism
is what the reviewer means, when he suggests Pound's Cantos criticize
"anti-democratic capitalism." That's to read the Cantos only for their
detective plot ("fifteen years on the case!" etc). And "finance capital"
isn't Pound's theoretical generality (no more than is "modernism").
Anyway, so this reviewer, I'm suggesting, says that what is
"misunderstood" is that that is Pound's real subject, namely finance
capitalism.

The problem with such a generous New Leftish reading is that the Cantos
don't merely point to the material effects of finance capital like some
Agassiz towering over a fish. The text also and very amply offers, in
almost all its nooks and crannies, theories about systemic "root" causes
of, and solutions to, what a Marxist would call finance capitalism. These
purported causes and solutions are offensive, stupid, terrifying,
fascistic.

Who reads the Cantos, symptomatically even, for their criticisms of
"finance capital"? Tellingly, not even Fredric Jameson, it would seem.
Maybe it's time, as it would let the history into a form that does its
utmost to include it, a form that has barely begun to be closely read.

Best, Louis

Hi all,

Some staff changes to announce as of issue 49 (due in March):

--Poetry co-editor Laura Elrick has stepped aside to concentrate on school
and teaching full-time, and Rodrigo Toscano will continue on, sans the co.

--Politics editor Christina Strong will shift her focus toward our website,
http://welcometoboogcity.com/, and other projects. And I'm real happy to
announce that Jen Benka and Carol Mirakove are coming onboard as politics
co-editors. (This also makes Carol our first two section editor, as she
previously served as poetry editor in 2004.)

as ever,
David

Subject:      Pound - Poetics and Politics
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
Content-Disposition: inline

Last week, an undergraduate exchange student asked me "Isn't it true that
the modernists were against women?"  What I hear behind this question as
behind some of the comments and observations to the list of late is a desire
to dismiss a writer on political grounds.  The hurling of labels, whether
political/ideological or simply scatalogical is never a very promising
beginning to a dialogue, presuming that is one wants to enter a conversation
rather than merely blow off steam.

Attempting to celebrate the poetry by severing it from the politics or
simply dismissing the poetry on account of the politics ... two sides of the
save evasive coin.  Why not reflect on the complex negotiations with Pound
in some of his better readers?  Oppen at the Mediterranean shore listening
to EP discuss the "boss,"  Zukofsky reconciling his personal friendship.

I'm reminded of this Bernstein follow-up to the poetics list of many years
ago:  http://epc.buffalo.edu/authors/bernstein/essays/poundbern.html

Rachel DuPlessis cultural poetics essays (Propounding Modernist Maleness,  *
Modernism/Modernity* 9.3 (2002) 389-405) model, on a different ideological
vector, ways of reading in and through the politics.

How much of the ideological "antipathy" towards Pound is based on a reading
of the politics of and within the poetry? How much reflects the received
wisdom about his radio broadcasts?  Let's not reduce the list to the
equivalent of a CNN Presidential Candidate likability poll.  Whether one
would rather have a beer with Ezra Pound or Mina Loy is really not the
question. Or, I should say, is not a question I find very promising.  Who,
besides Ben Friedlander, has actually listened to the polemical broadcasts?

Dear Amy---

I'll respond to the "opportunistic and pointless" charge...
In my response to David, I was primarily curious in the language of
that piece of journalism he was quoting.
I hadn't really been following this thread that deeply, so forgive me
if I missed some history, but I was mildly (but genuinely) curious
(still am) who wrote the piece,
as I couldn't tell in David's post when the MLA journalist's writing
stopped and David's own commentary started.
I thought asking David to talk more about it would be an interesting
entry into the conversation about Pound and such
(since I'm less interested in Pound than in the issues that often
come up when his name is evoked).

Regardless of who wrote that piece (the one that begins with the
Hussein reference), I was curious about what the writers' attitude/
stance/agenda, what-have-you- might be,
because it's interesting for me to hear what others (alive) think,
and put-forth, when they use words like 'cultural studies' and
'poetics'--
hotly contested words and phrases in certain circles that I sometimes
have to put an appearance in...

Anyway, even if I may end up largely disagreeing with the author of
that piece, I also have to admire
the intelligence that made the 'inappropriate' leap from Hussein to
whomever was head of the MLA before Perloff-
So I tried in that post to parse out what he was saying.
I guess I don't see what is 'opportunistic' or 'pointless' about
that....
Yeah, maybe because my piece tried to be somewhat playful
(as I was thinking about the two allegedly opposing views---"cultural
studies" and "poetics"--I felt I had to try to balance the "deadly
serious" tone with a playful one to find that balance),
my tone could be read as flippant.

But I'm curious about how (or why) what I wrote can be taken as
"assuming an attack position"....
I distrust the naturalization of many aspects Pound's poetics (I'm
not even talking about the fascism issue here, though that may play a
part) in contemporary American poetry,
and I find myself confronting it, almost daily, in my work as a
teacher, poet, and other writing (not so much in my music, coz the
Pound-assumptions aren't so much an issue there).
Sure, there will be times I catch my self spouting a Poundian-ism
here and there, or find points of agreement with Vendler, Perloff,
Bernsteiin, and others,

but I do agree with those who argue that contemporary poetry is still
understood too narrowly (I'm trying to avoid the word 'boring')
and want to encourage students (and others who may be skeptical
toward "poetry'')
  to realize that "poetry" can have a wider range than many
spokespeople for it acknowledge or admit (whether 'mainstream' or
whatever...),
to say nothing of what others who never really read much poetry
(besides say "My Papa's Waltz" and "Aunt Jennifer's Tigers") often
reduce it to...
In short, that poetry can accomodate their most profound needs if
they need those needs accomodated.

But, oh no, now I might be doing nothing more than "Assuming a
Defense Position." Well, so be it.
The long and short of it is, re: your point (stutter, stutter)--
Some of my disagreements with Bernstein for instance are probably
well-documented somewhere, but we do agree on some things
(like, for instance, the need to argue about poetics and/or culture
in a public context, and try to be entertaining about it in one way
or another),
and that argument sometimes becomes an "argument against
argument" (or we'd probably all be dead by now)...
and we may disagree over MUSIC, the meaning of music, the kind of
music we like, or even play,
but such disagreements, if respectful and playful, do not mean we
couldn't sit on a panel together...

Maybe Amy, we then disagree on the meaning (or feeling) of play and
respect
(now those two 1967 "Queen of Soul" hits a
re going through my so-called head)
and that's why I'm asking you now

After the Grammy Awards, Natalie Cole commented on Amy Winehouse winning
five Grammies:

"I don't think she should have won. I think it sends a bad message to our
young people who are trying to get into this business, the ones who are
trying to do it right and really trying to keep themselves together. We hav=
e
to stop rewarding bad behavior."

The following morning on the TV show The View, during its hot topics
discussion segment, the Cole comments were brought up. Here's where co-host=
s
Joy Behar and Barbara Walters went:

Joy Behar: Isn't it part of the presentation about Amy Winehouse? She's
talented. Look, I brought up this morning [off-air] Ezra Pound, a very
famous poet, a big antisemite. Now, are you going to read his poetry, if
it's not antisemitic poetry?

Barbara Walters: Now we're not saying you shouldn't read it. He shouldn't b=
e
applauded, and he was not applauded.

JB: Who, Ezra Pound?

BW: Not at the time, no he was not.

JB: OK, you don't have to applaud =8A

BW: We're not talking about her music, we're =8A

JB: =8A his antisemitism. Nobody's applauding Amy Winehouse's drug abuse.
Poetry, bad antisemite, separate things.

BW: They're not quite the same, because he was condemned at the time and I
don't want her condemned.

Review of Books I Like (and think you might too)


I'm remiss on reviewing for the past few months; I'm been jammed with any
number of things from current research to the death of a loved cat, my own
bad health, moving to West Virginia for close to a year. The books aren't
in any particular order - which I prefer, hopefully giving an element of
surprise.

The Essential Blender, Guide to 3D Creation with the Open Source Suite
Blender, edited by Roland Hess, blenderfoundation, 2008. The book comes
with a cd-rom including Blender 2.44, otherwise downloadable of course.
I've used Blender for years now; it's an amazing and lean 3D program that
runs on pretty much any platform, and has become increasingly easy to use.
When I began, there wasn't any menu bar; now there are complete menus,
keyboard shortcuts and the like. The program does everything from inverse
kinematics to gaming to video or still image output; you can even program
Python with it. The book introduces the program, gets you started; it's
the first in a forthcoming series presenting specific information in
relation to gaming, design, etc. I strongly urge you to get it, download
the program, and begin! While there is a tremendous among of online
information at blender.org etc., I've always found a manual more conven-
ient - it's faster, leaves the screen alone, makes good subway reading.
Like all the Blender manuals, this one is excellent and abjures the
over-the-top design of some of the others. By the way, Blender is great
for design/art/multi-media courses; consider introducing your students to
it.

Windows Vista Annoyances, David A Karp, O'Reilly, 2008. I needed a high-
powered desktop cheap, ended up with an HP quad w/sata, etc. But I didn't
need Vista. I had no choice, given the particular configuration I wanted
and could afford. The result is a terrific rendering machine with a horrid
operating system; I won't go into the problems of user account control,
disappearing files, insane terminal error messages, absence of such useful
programs as telnet, and just plain craziness. I'm using the free version
of TweakVI and a program called TweakUAC, CCleaner, CoreFTP Lite, AVG, and
Desktop Maestro; I can't afford more. I looked at a LOT of Vista books,
and found this the best for configuration and resource. It doesn't get rid
of UAC, but it helps. Enough said.

Introduction to Tibetan Buddhism, John Powers, Snow Lion, 1995. I have
been working through Tibetan, Madhyamaka, and Pali Canon philosophies
recently, in order to reconfigure distinctions among real, virtual, anal-
og, digital, dream, hallucination, sign, anysign, and world and true
world. I needed a guide into the complex culture of Tibetan Buddhism in
particular, and can recommend this one in particular; it's extremely
detailed, lends itself as an introduction to other texts, and cleared up
some confusion I had in relation to doctrine, sect, and history. If you're
going to read one book on the subject, I would think this would be it.
(Another approach of course is to read one or another originary text in
translation; see below.)

Contemporary Poetics, edited by Louis Armand, Northwestern, 2007. I'm in
this volume, so I'm prejudiced, but I see few anthologies giving much
credence to codework of any sort. The book has materials from McKenzie
Wark, Charles Bernstein, Marjorie Perloff, Bruce Andrews, Gregory Ulmer,
Steve McCaffery, Armand, and others; there are references to Frege, Joyce,
Acker, Cage, etc. and the essays are terrific. Do check this out!

Living on Cybermind, Categories, Communication, and Control, Jonathan Paul
Marshall, Peter Lang, 2007. Again I'm prejudiced, since Michael Current
and I began Cybermind together near the beginning of 1994, and the book is
a lengthy and detailed ethnography of the list. That said, I was pleased
at its brilliant analysis of online communication in general; on a person-
al note, it was oddly rewarding to find myself one of a number of subjects
of ethnographic research. This is the most detailed work I've seen on
online communication; it avoids the usual statistical approaches (although
an appendix presents these) in favor of a phenomenological attitude that
emphasizes terms like _asence_ ("The suspension of certainty between
presence and absence which is experienced online. Asence is often resolved
by acknowledgment.") and _aura_ ("The 'total communication' which occurs
in the background or off the particular Internet social formation it
surrounds."). I _use_ this book constantly in my work, and you might find
it useful as well.

Tibetan Religious Dances, Tibetan text and annotated translation of the
'chams yig, Rene de Nebesky-Wojkowitz, Paljor, (reprint) 2001. This book
is a translation of a manual for sacred dances with an amazing root text
running through it. The major part of it was written by the fifth Dalai
Lama, 1617-1682 and was for use of a lamasary within the Potala precincts.
I've used this book in thinking through ritual movement within the true
world, Second Life for that matter; you might find it of great interest as
well, particularly if you're concerned with movement, ritual, rite, and/or
Tibetan Buddhism in general.

The Story of Tibet, Conversations with the Dalai Lama, Thomas Laird,
Grove, 2006, is one of the best introductions to Tibetan history and
culture. Laird is not a 'believer,' however defined, and his conversations
are dialogic; one gets an insight both into Tibet and the Dalai Lama. This
book came highly recommended to me, and for good reason; it should be read
by everyone interested in the philosophy and moment of Tibetan Buddhism,
as well as recent Tibetan history. Like Powers' book above, this is
extremely illuminating.

A Theory of Semiotics, Umberto Eco, Indian, 1976. This might well be the
best background or theory book on the phenomenology and semiotics of code
- and of everything else - I've seen. I've always been surprised it hasn't
been required reading in any theory 'canon'; perhaps its complexity is the
reason. In any case, it's essential, fundamental. There are 110 pages on
the theory of codes. I think the book a classic; if you find a copy, buy
it. I think it goes well with Instruments of Communication, An Essay on
Scientific Writing, by Patrick Meredith, Pergamon, 1966; I hadn't heard of
this book until I found a copy in Pittsburgh. It too deserves to be better
known; it works through forms of representation, issues of meaning, and
the instrumentality of language. It reminds me of Kripke's Meaning and
Necessity. I can't review it; unlike the Eco (which I studied intently),
I've been reading into this, on and off, for a while. Do check it out if
there's a university library around.

Kalachakra Tantra, Rite of Initiation, His Holiness the Dalai Lama,
translated, edited, and introduced by Jeffrey Hopkins, Wisdom, 1999. This
book is great and at least for me is a core text itself for comprehending
the true world, the inherency and emptiness of 'real' and 'virtue,' any-
sign, the image/imaginary, and so forth. Hopkins' introduction is amazing
and he 'walks' you through the Kalachakra mandala. The book requires
careful attention, and it's problematic whether it should be 'public' at
all, since the tantric rites are generally protected, somewhat secret, and
are of course for initiates. So I'm reading this as an outsider who at
best is a fellow traveler; as such, I more than recommend it.

Apparitions of the Self, The Secret Autobiographies of a Tibetan Vision-
ary, Janet Gyatso, Motilal Banarsidass, 2001. The visionary is Jigme
Lingpa. The autobiographies are Dancing Moon in the Water and Dakki's
grand Secret-Talk, and they took my breath away. The book has copious
notes and commentary, the texts are classics in any number of genres, and
if you can find this online or at your local Tibetan bookstore, pick it
up. (There was one in Brooklyn, where I found this and many other texts;
it's unfortunately closed.)

The Emptiness of Emptiness, An Introduction to Early Indian Madhyamika,
C.W. Huntington, Jr., and Geshe Namgyal Wangchen, Motilal Banarsidass,
2003, but first published by U. Hawaiian Press, 1989. This is a trans-
lation of, and commentary on, Candrakirti's Madhyamakavatara, The Entry
into the Middle Way, which itself is a commentary on Nagarjuna. Candra-
kirti's text is referenced everywhere; I have two translations of it. I
find the work tough going, but illuminating (in both versions), but I
wouldn't read it without reading Nagarjuna first, of course.

I want to speak briefly of my inclusion of so many Buddhist/philosophic
texts. I find them immensely useful and interesting, in light of a general
movement, online, towards virtual communalities, etc.; my work with
emanents, avatars, SL, and so forth, is part of this. These texts tend to
emphasize emptiness, imagining, virtual deity, co-dependent co-origina-
tion, issues of purity, and other concepts or areas that move elsewhere
than the subject/object or language/psychoanalytics orientation of most of
the western (European, American, etc.) theory I've read. I found myself at
an impasse. It's too easy on the other hand to move towards or through
'spirituality' with these texts - something I resist at any rate. Rightly
or wrongly I find a philosophic Buddhism without issues of rebirth, and I
find enough without these issues to give me hope in a different way of
looking at the world, a different way of inhabiting it. My recent writing
reflects this direction, murky as it (my recent writing) is. Now back to
reviews. -

Popular Physics, Peck's Ganot,, or Introductory Course of Natural Phil-
osophy, for the use of Schools and Academies, edited from Ganot's Popular
Physics, by William G. Peck, A.S. Barnes, 1873. revised from 1860. This is
the book I've described with a section on 'electrical recreations'; it
also formed a basis for rethinking the phenomenology of matter, both
'real' and virtual, in light of the sections on electrostatics and elec-
trical fluid. The engravings, often of young men demonstrating sparks,
etc., to young women, have been useful, and eventually led me to getting a
copy of Ganot's Traite Elementaire de Physique, Paris, chez l'auteur,
1854, third edition. This is an advanced university text; Peck's text was
modeled on Ganot's rewrite of the Traite for younger students. The young
men and women, even electrical recreations, are gone, but the illustrat-
ions are by far the best steel engravings I've seen, and amazingly useful
- they provide an accounting of the state of knowledge, both magnetic and
electrical, static and dynamic (not to mention the other subjects of
physics), of the mid-19th century material world (which may or may not be
the same as our own). A philosophy of matter is presented here, in short,
and, again, it relates to online versions/visions of worlds, something I'm
drawing out at the moment.

A System of Natural Philosophy, J.L. Comstock, Pratt Woodford Farmer and
Brace, 1854, fifth stereotype revision, and the same, Robinson and Pratt,
1841, 'Stereotyped from the fifty-third edition,' but most likely the
first revised edition (if that). These, again, are elementary physics
texts for use in the United States; they are equally fascinating in their
presentation of matter, and odds and ends (which is where such things as
Sharp's Rifle and House's Printing Telegraph are found). The descriptions
of matter, electrical fluid, and the like, augment Peck and Ganot; I've
been working with all four volumes. If you're interested in the social
phenomena of electrostatics, I'd recommend Peck; if you're interested in
the technical details, go back to Ganot. But all of them differ in inter-
esting ways - in the description of electrical machines, for example.

Several other older texts:

Radio Phone Receiving, A Practical Book for Everybody, by various, van
Nostrand, 1923. An excellent guide to the state of early radio on the
verge of widespread broadcasting. Sections on crystal radio, vacuum tube,
commercial broadcasting, etc.

The Telegraph Instructor, G.M. Dodge, Valparaiso, Indiana, 1908, fourth
edition. From the only telegraph operator's school in the US at the time.
This book has proved one of the most useful on codes and early communica-
tions technology; while the telegraph originated decades earlier, its
increasing complexity led to the development of more codes and more com-
plex codes, which I've described elsewhere. They were needed for trains,
for ships, for crossings of all sorts, for press corps, for private and
public communications, and so forth; they were required to be succinct,
and almost without redundancy, since cable space/time was money. They were
also required to be checked for accuracy. If a cable went down, either
shorting or left open, the location of the break had to be determined as
fast as possible. All of this required an enormous amount of knowledge, and
all of this is described in Dodge's textbook.

Hawkins Electrical Guide, various editions, Hawkins and Staff, Audel,
1914-1917, etc. I use these constantly; the volumes I have (which still
can be found, relatively inexpensive) cover such things as electric
trains, trolleys, and cars; crystal radio receivers and transmitters;
therapeutic and medical uses of electricity and x-rays; electrical meas-
urement; motion picture camera and projector technology; and telegraphy
(codes, printouts, sounders, etc.). You can build from these books; you
can also get an understanding how, for example, electrostatics ended up in
the form of vaginal and rectal electrodes (among other things). I do want
to praise the Audel's series/handbooks in general; they cover everything
from rouge to automobiles, and they're authoritative.

Karl Kraus, Apocalyptic Satirist, Culture and Catastrophe in Habsburg
Vienna, Edward Timms, Yale, 1986. Kraus is one of my favorite writers, in
spite of his problematic, feminism/anti-feminism, occasional conservatism,
etc. His writing and condemnations of war, anti-feminism, misuse of lang-
uage and psychoanalysis, is fierce. His Jewishness is odd; he turned
towards and then away from, Catholicism. Timms goes as far as possible
into understanding him. I found a first edition of Die letzten Tagen der
Menschheit (Last Days of Mankind) and was thrilled; I'm amazed he wasn't
hung for it. One of his books, Spruche und Widerspruche, has been trans-
lated by Jonathan McVity as Dicta and Contradicta in a very neat volume
published by Illinois, 2001; I most highly recommend this (I find the
German so compressed, I can't read it without the translation) which
resonates with his more-than-aphoristic style.

The Concealed Essence of the Hevajra Tantra, with the commentary Yogarat-
namala, G.W. Farrow and I. Menon, Motilal Banarsidass, 2001. This is one
of the main non-dual Yogini tantras, and I love it; in particular, there
is a lot on secret sign language, on the fire sacrifice, on purification,
on nonexistence, and so forth. Translated from Sanskrit and Tibetan. For a
Chinese version, somewhat different but again quite beautiful, there is
The Chinese Hevajratantra, Ch. Willemen, Motilal Banarsidass, 2004.

Counterexamples in Topology, Lynn Arthur Steen and J. Arthur Seebach, Jr,
Dover, 1995, from the 1978 edition. The book gives around 150 counter-
examples of topological spaces, which are quite useful in thinking through
analog/digital (or discrete) issues and their meeting at the limits. It's
also fun to read, imagining some of the oddest mathematical models around.

The Archaeology of Knowledge & The Discourse on Language, Michel Foucault,
Pantheon, 1971. This slippery text, which you must know better than I do,
deserves a closer look; it resonates, I think, with Buddhist epistemology
in its problematizing of language and statement, its diffusion, and at
times the language reminds me of the Flower Ornament Sutra. Ok, far-
fetched, and I'm deeply Foucault-ignorant, but it seems that the work is
increasingly useful in considering outdated real/virtual distinctions.

bash Cookbook, Carl Albing, JP Vossen, and Cameron Newham, O'Reilly, 2007.
I asked O'Reilly to send me this as a review copy; I love the bash shell,
and this book presents the world of it. There are chapters on scripting,
shell tools, getting started, novice 'goofs'; there are numerous reference
lists as well. As I've said before, the O'Reilly books have been a guide
for me, from Linux 2.0 stuff on. They're intelligent, amazingly well-
written, authoritative, and backed up online. There's no wasted space and
they're well-printed, rarely going out of date - I'm using ones that are
twenty years old. I particularly like the degree of detail which allows
someone, from a novice to a programmer, to quickly find the tools she
needs. I also like the fact they're _books_; for a while I subscribed to
Safari (when I could afford it!), but I ended up carrying the books around
instead - they make good reading away from the computer as well. I highly
recommend this book to anyone working in Unix/Linux; you won't regret it,
and you'll use it often.

Overview of Buddhist Tantra, General Presentation of the Classes of Tan-
tra, Captivating the Minds of the Fortunate Ones, Panchen Sonam Dragpa,
translation by Martin J. Boord and Losang Norbu Tsonawa, Library of
Tibetan Works and Archives, 1996. This text is from the 15th-16th century;
I read it in conjunction with F.D. Lessin, Alex Wayman, Introduction to
the Buddhist Tantric Systems, Mkhas-grub-rje (1385-1438), Samuel Weiser,
1980. I prefer the latter which is elegant and beautiful to read. (I know
I'm using 'beautiful' as well as 'useful' a lot, and this text is of
course both.)

The Fundamental Wisdom of the Middle way, Nagarjuna's Mulamadhyamakakar-
ika, translation and commentary by Jay L. Garfield, Oxford, 1995. This
sets out the Middle Way, and is _the_ philosophical text, I think, under-
lying almost all the others I describe here. A great deal of Nagarjuna's
work - including works on logic - has been translated, and is well worth
reading. I'm currently stumbling through Nagarjuna's Refutation of Logic
(Nyaya), Vaidalyaprakarana, translated from the Tibetan by Fernando Tola
and Carmen Dragonetti. The paradoxes _matter._ Emptiness resonates with
true world, at least in my mind. What more can I say?

Cabaret Performance, Sketches, Songs, Monologues, Memoirs, Volume II:
Europe 1920-1940, selected and translated, with commentary by Laurence
Senelick, Johns Hopkins, 1993. This book is important to me, as are any
number of others dealing with Weimar (etc.) cabaret; I'm influenced by
such figures as Valeska Gert and Anita Berber. (This comes out clearly in
the SL performances.) Cabaret Performance presents material from them and
a number of other people; there's been a _lot_ of material on cabaret from
this period, which was way ahead of its time. I've reviewed The Seven
Addictions and Five Professions of Anita Berber before; you can begin
there, or online with google, etc.; in any case the material in Senelick's
book ranges over far wider territory and is an absolute revelation.

Prehistoric Digital Poetry, An Archaeology of Forms, 1959-1995, C.T.
Funkhouser, Alabama, 2007. Disclaimer: my work is in it. Claimer: This is
by far the most generous text I've seen on the origins and meanderings of
digital literary-plus forms; I think it's fundamental, if anything is.
Funkhouser ranges over a vast territory, from codeworks through concrete
poetry, from Mac Low to hypercard. This should be essential reading in any
experimental/new media/electronic literature/writing class; it's also fun!

The Lankavatara Sutra, A Mahayana Text, Daisetz Teitaro Suzuki, Motilal
Banardsidass, 1999, from the London 1932 edition; and Studies in the
Lankavatara Sutra, D.T. Suzuki, Mushiram Manoharlal, 1998, from the
original 1930 edition. Everyone knows D.T. Suzuki; this is clearly his
masterwork - his translation of the sutra, and subsequent analysis. I find
his emphasis on Zen somewhat biased (as, elsewhere, his emphasis on
Bushido and Rinzai Zen), but he's done an invaluable service in this
translation - and better yet, it's now available, along with commentary,
in relatively inexpensive Indian editions. The sutra is wonderful, if for
no other reason than the amazing list of questions and answers propounded.
This is an important sutra, and Suzuki discusses the theory of mind,
externals, and egolessness inherent in it. Not to be missed I think.

Introduction to the Middle Way, Chandrakirti's Madhyamakavatara with
Commentary By Jamgon Mipham, translated by the Padmakara Translation
Group, Shambhala, 2002. This should be read in conjunction with the other
translation listed above; this is by far the most poetic. The text is
highly compressed in the original, and both commentaries help elucidating
Chandrakirti's meaning.

Tantra in Practice, edited by David Gordon White, Motilal Banarsidass,
2001. This is a great collection of Buddhist, Hindu, Jain, and Islamic
texts; it's incredibly wide-ranging and includes both contemporary
commentary and translations. One of the best detailed collections of
tantric rites.

Beautiful Code, Leading Programmers Explain How They Think, edited by Andy
Oram and Greg Wilson, O'Reilly, 2007. All I can say is this is currently
my favorite computer book; I'm learning more about programming practices
than I have from years of kludging! This goes well with another currently
my favorite computer text, Paul A. Fishwick's Aesthetic Computing, MIT,
2006. Both of these chart out territories of deep code and visualization -
from the visualizing of programming itself, to interfacing and image pro-
duction. I think these are the two books to get, in terms of coding and
new media; I frankly prefer them to any of the straightforward anthologies
out there.

Feynman, Lectures on Computation, edited by Tony Hey and Robin W. Allen,
Perseus, 1996, reprinted with corrections, 1999. This is an interesting
guide to coding, communication, computation and thermodynamics of com-
putation, quantum computers, etc. There's a good section on the physical
aspects of computation. If you like Feynman or are interested in a very
readable exposition of difficult material, you'll like this, in spite of
the fact some of it is out of date (but not the basic material).

Maps of the Profound, Jam-yang-shay-ba's Great Exposition of Buddhist and
Non-Buddhist Views on the Nature of Reality, Jeffrey Hopkins, Snow Lion,
2003. The original dates from 1689. This version contains both the root
text, which is terse and difficult, and commentaries, which are terse and
difficult. This enormous work is a presentation of tenets text, used to
systematize a number of schools and viewpoints. I've not read it straight
through, but it is terrific to dip into, follow the strands of philosophy
and disputation. Among other things, it's indicative of the depth of the
Tibetan/Buddhist philosophical tradition, and what it has to offer to the
rest of us, mired, I believe, in issues of subject/abject/object and all
their inconsistencies.

Chasing Clouds, A decade of Studies, Emily Cheng, Timezone 8, 2008. I've
followed Emily's work for years (she was also cameraperson on the Blue
Tape with Kathy Acker), and have admired her paintings, drawings, and
graphics and their relationships to history, aesthetics, and issues of
Buddhism/Taoism, and multiculturalism in general. This book focuses on her
studies, which are small, intimate, often intricate, and remind me of
Taoist talismans; they're also wonderfully beautiful and meditative. It's
not often a collection of reproductions functions on its own as a book to
be cherished, but this one does! The reproductions are beautiful as well.

Second Life, a Guide to Your Virtual World, Brian A. White, Que, 2007 -
the most useful book I've seen on Second Life, with the least amount of
fluff; it even covers the use of bvh files and Poser. This is the one to
get. It takes you through particles, economics, scripting behavior, model-
ing, etc. Highly recommended.

The Embodied Mind, Cognitive Science and Human Experience, Francisco J.
Varela, Evan Thompson, and Eleanor Rosch, MIT, 1991. I hadn't seen this
before; Sandy Baldwin pointed it out to me. It discusses mind and self
with an approach based both on Madhyamika philosophy and cog sci and
should be read by anyone interested in the topic. Again, highly
recommended; I'd been looking for this kind of approach for a long time.
The last sentence is prescient: "At the very least, the journey of
Buddhism to the west provides some of the resources we need to pursue
consistently our own cultural and scientific premises to the point where
we no longer need and desire foundations and so can take up the further
tasks of building and dwelling in worlds without ground."

Go for it Louis!
(though I'd rather hear a Cabrian critique of finance capital
than a critique of finance capital mediated by the terms of a long
poem written before Reaganomics fer instance...
(even if losing one's center (fighting the world) is truly 'news that
stays news', etc....)

Chris,

Thanks very much for your note and explanation.  Now it's my turn to apologize -- I didn't have you in mind when I wrote the last paragraph about the 'rotating few' -- their flame messages can be found throughout the archives here (when the list wasn't moderated), and I've even encountered some in person.  They are, if anything, consistent and persistent in getting their sentiments across ...  Your email struck me as being in the same camp but not your ongoing contributions to the list.   I apologize again, esp as it seems I mis-read your intent.

Thanks again,
Amy

I've been sitting back casually reading some of the polemic that this topic
has generated. There was a recent collection of Al Purdy's poetry issued.
The editor was Rob Budde. In his introduction, Rob explained why some poems
were not selected for inclusion. One of the ones not selected was 'Caribou
Horses', the title poem for the collection which won Purdy the Governor
General's award in 1964, I believe. Budde's position was that this poem, the
setting of which was Thousand Mile House in the Rockies of Alberta, referred
to female Indians as 'squaws' and various Indian groups - the Blackfoot,
Sioux, etc. - as if they were homogeneous. If Budde had looked into Purdy's
life a little more, he would have discovered that Purdy was involved in
Indian rights and anti-discrimination. The depiction Purdy created in his
poem was necessary in order to instil the proper atmosphere and was using
the conventions of the time. There was no offense intended. Nor, given
Purdy's background, could there have been.
Certainly, Pound's situation is not the same. Not even close. Yes, he was
anti-Semitic. Yes, he was a fascist. But, if we examine his times, this was
probably the prevalent - or, at least, one of the prevalent - views. And
yes, this would have colored his poetry to a certain extent. But does this
mean, viewing Pound - and Eliot who held the same views - in hindsight, that
we must discard the poetry? My feeling is that we can regret that these
attitudes were once part of our culture and do our best to ensure they are
not part of our current cultural values, but that the poetry is still great
poetry.
There are probably a number of current cultural values in play which, when
viewed in the hindsight of a hundred years (provided the human race lasts
that long), are going to suffer the same fate. I think of the great feminist
literature and poetry which has been written and continues to be written. It
may, to a certain extent, be considered necessary today and in earlier days
as a means of liberating women but it does contain a great deal of
androgyny. This, at some point, will have to be dealt with - and, hopefully,
will not be dealt with by being discarded which would be a disservice to
feminist poets.

Dear Amy---

I'll respond to the "opportunistic and pointless" charge...
In my response to David, I was primarily curious in the language of
that piece of journalism he was quoting.
I hadn't really been following this thread that deeply, so forgive me
if I missed some history, but I was mildly (but genuinely) curious
(still am) who wrote the piece,
as I couldn't tell in David's post when the MLA journalist's writing
stopped and David's own commentary started.
I thought asking David to talk more about it would be an interesting
entry into the conversation about Pound and such
(since I'm less interested in Pound than in the issues that often
come up when his name is evoked).

Regardless of who wrote that piece (the one that begins with the
Hussein reference), I was curious about what the writers' attitude/
stance/agenda, what-have-you- might be,
because it's interesting for me to hear what others (alive) think,
and put-forth, when they use words like 'cultural studies' and
'poetics'--
hotly contested words and phrases in certain circles that I sometimes
have to put an appearance in...

Anyway, even if I may end up largely disagreeing with the author of
that piece, I also have to admire
the intelligence that made the 'inappropriate' leap from Hussein to
whomever was head of the MLA before Perloff-
So I tried in that post to parse out what he was saying.
I guess I don't see what is 'opportunistic' or 'pointless' about
that....
Yeah, maybe because my piece tried to be somewhat playful
(as I was thinking about the two allegedly opposing views---"cultural
studies" and "poetics"--I felt I had to try to balance the "deadly
serious" tone with a playful one to find that balance),
my tone could be read as flippant.

But I'm curious about how (or why) what I wrote can be taken as
"assuming an attack position"....
I distrust the naturalization of many aspects Pound's poetics (I'm
not even talking about the fascism issue here, though that may play a
part) in contemporary American poetry,
and I find myself confronting it, almost daily, in my work as a
teacher, poet, and other writing (not so much in my music, coz the
Pound-assumptions aren't so much an issue there).
Sure, there will be times I catch my self spouting a Poundian-ism
here and there, or find points of agreement with Vendler, Perloff,
Bernsteiin, and others,

but I do agree with those who argue that contemporary poetry is still
understood too narrowly (I'm trying to avoid the word 'boring')
and want to encourage students (and others who may be skeptical
toward "poetry'')
  to realize that "poetry" can have a wider range than many
spokespeople for it acknowledge or admit (whether 'mainstream' or
whatever...),
to say nothing of what others who never really read much poetry
(besides say "My Papa's Waltz" and "Aunt Jennifer's Tigers") often
reduce it to...
In short, that poetry can accomodate their most profound needs if
they need those needs accomodated.

But, oh no, now I might be doing nothing more than "Assuming a
Defense Position." Well, so be it.
The long and short of it is, re: your point (stutter, stutter)--
Some of my disagreements with Bernstein for instance are probably
well-documented somewhere, but we do agree on some things
(like, for instance, the need to argue about poetics and/or culture
in a public context, and try to be entertaining about it in one way
or another),
and that argument sometimes becomes an "argument against
argument" (or we'd probably all be dead by now)...
and we may disagree over MUSIC, the meaning of music, the kind of
music we like, or even play,
but such disagreements, if respectful and playful, do not mean we
couldn't sit on a panel together...

Maybe Amy, we then disagree on the meaning (or feeling) of play and
respect
(now those two 1967 "Queen of Soul" hits a
re going through my so-called head)
and that's why I'm asking you now

Kenneth,

You missed an opportunity there.

Instead of choosing to read this student's query as a sign of bad faith
and a fear in the professorial sin of "dismissing" a writer
(the horror), perhaps a more helpful reply might have been:

"Yes, Susan, many modernists were quite misogynistic, that's true. As
well as classist and racist. And in fact a great deal of the poetry that
was suppressed during that time was suppressed precisely because it
contained progressive content. Modernism was a right-leaning literary
ideology. In fact, I could suggest, Susan, two great books by Cary
Nelson on the topic. One is /Repression and Recovery: Modern American
Poetry and the Politics of Cultural Memory/ and the other is
/Revolutionary Memory: Recovering the Poetry of the American Left/. I'd
be happy to hear what you think about these books."

It would be better to praise this student's desire to read politically,
and to in fact inform her/him that it's utopian and impossible not to.

But it seems you instead chose to read this student's reasonable and in
many ways quite correct query as suspicious.

I find myself feeling a little sorry for that student.

Best,

Gabriel

Kenneth Sherwood wrote:
"Last week, an undergraduate exchange student asked me "Isn't it true that
the modernists were against women?"  What I hear behind this question as
behind some of the comments and observations to the list of late is a desire
to dismiss a writer on political grounds.  The hurling of labels, whether
political/ideological or simply scatalogical is never a very promising
beginning to a dialogue, presuming that is one wants to enter a conversation
rather than merely blow off steam.

Attempting to celebrate the poetry by severing it from the politics or
simply dismissing the poetry on account of the politics ... two sides of the
save evasive coin.  Why not reflect on the complex negotiations with Pound
in some of his better readers?  Oppen at the Mediterranean shore listening
to EP discuss the "boss,"  Zukofsky reconciling his personal friendship.

I'm reminded of this Bernstein follow-up to the poetics list of many years
ago:  http://epc.buffalo.edu/authors/bernstein/essays/poundbern.html

Rachel DuPlessis cultural poetics essays (Propounding Modernist Maleness,  *
Modernism/Modernity* 9.3 (2002) 389-405) model, on a different ideological
vector, ways of reading in and through the politics.

How much of the ideological "antipathy" towards Pound is based on a reading
of the politics of and within the poetry? How much reflects the received
wisdom about his radio broadcasts?  Let's not reduce the list to the
equivalent of a CNN Presidential Candidate likability poll.  Whether one
would rather have a beer with Ezra Pound or Mina Loy is really not the
question. Or, I should say, is not a question I find very promising.  Who,
besides Ben Friedlander, has actually listened to the polemical broadcasts?"

I think Christophe Casamassima's idea for a "No Press Distribution" site is
fabulous. An apt and democratic use of the medium and so charitable of CC. I
only hope he won't be overwhelmed, ultimately, by willingness to set the
site up, arrange for hosting, and update it frequently without any
remuneration. Would it be worthwhile to charge a nominal fee to be listed,
say, $25? That's still much cheaper than SPD!

Great ideas, Andrea, and thanks for your energy!

I'll set up the website via my towson.edu account, which is free. I have 1 =
GB of space, and can update it as I need it. For now cash is not a factor, =
but I will take donations if there's need to set up something more complica=
ted, or if some people help out with layout and content management. We'll s=
ee.

For now, just send me books or whatever and I'll create a space for readers=
 and writers to link up with an option to review on-line.=20

This is just silly. Pound was way more extreme in an extreme time
than passive antisemites like Eliot and Williams, and he worked hard
to propagate his views, certainly with a degree of awareness of the
murderous results of those views--this was not something that most
people did. I read him, I admire a lot of the work, even some of it
that makes me wince, but with far more ambivalence than I read, say,
Dante or Shakespeare (who also make me wince), who expressed views
that were murderous in their time but almost universal. I expect that
my being Jewish has something to do with this. As Alison said about
reading as a woman applies to Jews and all the other outsiders of
European culture. One learns to take what's valuable from the trash
heap, and one notes that the trash doesn't smell any better.

Modernism wasn't a right-leaning tendency, though some important
modernists leaned that way. I'd suggest you expand your list.

Dear Everyone:

Here's the 411 on the situation.

After years of hard work on the part of Fred Dewey and others
advocating for Beyond Baroque, City Councilman Bill Rosendahl agreed
at the end of fall 2007 to extend Beyond Baroque's lease of the
 building at 681 Venice Blvd. for another 25 years. We on the Board of
Trustees went off into the holidays relieved that the issue had
finally been resolved and that Beyond Baroque's homestead was secure.

 I was stunned to learn last night that last week, Councilman
Rosendahl was informed by City Attorney Rocky Delgadillo's office
that the City Attorney wants to put the lease to 681 Venice Blvd. up
for an auction process for other non-profits to bid on. This despite
 the facts that:

1) It is generally up to the City Councilman of a given council
district to determine how city property assets are parsed out for
public use;

2) 681 Venice Blvd. has been Beyond Baroque's home for nearly 40
 years;

3) Beyond Baroque's staff and supporters have put their time, money,
and talents into not only keeping up and improving the building and
its facilities, but also into beautifying its landscape.

This new snag may be Mr. Delgadillo's way of playing politics with
Councilman Rosendahl, but he has ordered a hearing to decide the
matter NEXT TUESDAY. That's right. Rocky gives us until Tuesday,
February 19, to do something about this.

We need to take action NOW.

Please send an e-mail to City Councilman Bill Rosendahl
(Councilman.Rosendahl@lacity.org) to thank him for supporting the 25-
 year lease renewal for Beyond Baroque and to let him know that you
support him in his battle to keep Beyond Baroque in its rightful
home. IMPORTANT! Be sure to cc: the City Attorney
(Rocky.Delgadillo@lacity.org) on your e-mail. Large numbers of e-
 mails WILL get their attention. It does not have to be a long e-mail.
You can personalize it by adding a few words about what Beyond
Baroque means to you as a resident of Los Angeles.

If you aren't from L.A., please tell them that Beyond Baroque is an
 important reason for you to keep coming back to Venice and to Los
Angeles. If you are from out of state or out of the country
altogether, please talk about how you know of Beyond Baroque's
outstanding reputation and why it's important for Los Angeles to
 protect and sustain its only literary arts center.

Be polite and supportive so that both parties understand that keeping
Beyond Baroque exactly where it is is a positive move that benefits
everyone.

Do this tonight or tomorrow. The hearing is on Tuesday.

I thank you for taking action.

Much love and in solidarity,

Points well taken -- but I have to say I find the concept of a
"passive antisemite" startling -- this is a distinction I'm not sure
I'd want to hold to --

Dear Alison,

Thanks for helping me understand the way gender inflects your reading of
Pound and what you meant regarding the notion of the prophetic in Pound.

It does seem hard for us to follow each other, yes. I'm chalking that up
both to the overall political anxieties inhering in any reading of
modernism and keenly so in EP, and to the anxieties attending the way
posts to such a large listserv will inevitably be accidentally and
sometimes willfully misread as performative or ironic or hostile. I
assure you, my very substantial failings as a reader notwithstanding,
that I've no willful desire to misread you (scary, isn't it!?) :)

Because misreading is the word of the day, I'll, one last time, respond
to your repeated concern, repeated here by you with new phrasing,
despite some several posts to the contrary, that mine is a desire to
"annihilate" Pound's "poetry from the face of the earth." This seems
homologous to the paranoia about "dismissal" of authors. My response to
that concern is this: this concern strike me as a symptom of an anxiety
that a faith is being attacked.

Pound, as a conflicted object of faith, a faith constructed and policed,
is where the focus of my interest lies. I've been very grateful to be
reacquainted, through Amy King's posts and through Kenneth Sherwood,
Bernstein's account of his conflicted relationship to EP -- CB's quotes
P: "Faith is totalitarian. The mystery is totalitarian."

I am not attacking anyone's faith in EP. That faith and its object is
unassailable from without. In order to properly attack that faith, one
must adopt it and attacking it from within. Rather, I would again urge a
sociological reading of the institutions that surround and construct the
"belief" in Pound, the industry of Pound, the industry that creates,
maintains -- and then polices -- a belief in Pound. Not to destroy Pound
(he's safe, believe me), but to understand the canonizing function
itself as a dynamic that in part encourages, fosters, and cherishes
controversy as a means of provoking assent or, more aptly, submission.

This is merely another approach to reading EP -- not as an end in
itself, however (the modernist worry about the autonomous primacy of the
text) but as a means of understanding the sociology of
literature. Such a reading is not wrong. And it's not an attempt to
efface the poetry, which is, as always, an interesting read.

Fascist poetics is an apt phrasing. The fascist ideal of a populist
authoritarian charismatic leader seeking to forge a state in which all
individuality is subordinated to the leader's conception of that state
is in many interesting ways homologous to canonicity. The desire to
police a reading of Pound is what is wrought by the field.

We remember controversy vividly. That is why it arises both as an
individual tactic (posts re masculine transgressor) and a structural
element.

As such, the canon needs an enemy. Pound needs an enemy. Expect yourself
to be called the enemy if you ready beyond what the field consitutes as
"Pound." Sometimes that enemy is "dismissal," sometimes that enemy is
elitism, sometimes that enemy is misreading, sometimes that enemy is the
author herself or himself. In Pound's case -- and this is what makes him
so intransigent -- that enemy is Pound himself.

Anyway, take care and be well -- and be happy, Alison!

Warmly,
Gabriel

It doesn't make me real happy, either--I'll never get into the
country club. But finding nazis simply way too lowlife in their
behavior towards us distasteful Jews, as Williams and a great many
other did, is way better than Pound's position. I'd much prefer a
universal reform of the human spirit. Until then I'll settle for
non-polar distinctions.

[this sad news just in -- I met him once, briefly, in 1982 at Catholic
University -- My favorite passage from his critical work:

"My novels have not been received, upon publication in France, with unanimous
enthusiasm . . . "]





French writer Robbe-Grillet dies







The writer's novels include Les Gommes and Le Voyeur Alain Robbe-Grillet, the
French writer who pioneered the so-called "new novel" genre, has died at the
age of 85.


He was best Known for his unorthodox narratives, but enjoyed success, with
novels such as Les Gommes (The Erasers) and Le Voyeur still studied today.


He also worked in film, first as a scriptwriter and later as a director.


The novelist was admitted to the Caen University Hospital in France over the
weekend for cardiac problems and died on Monday morning, officials said.


Robbe-Grillet was born on 18 August, 1922, in Brest, western France.


The son of an engineer, he studied agricultural engineering and worked as a
statistician and an agronomist before finding fame as a writer.


Murder


He developed the idea of the "nouveau roman" in a series of essays in the early
1960s.


Dispensing with traditional literary devices such as plot, narrative and
chronology, the new novel sees story subordinated to structure, with the
significance of objects more important than human action.


Les Gommes, his 1953 debut novel, remains among his most celebrated works and
tells the story of a murder committed by the detective who has come to
investigate it.


In 1958's La Jalousie (Jealousy), Robbe-Grillet writes of a man living on a
banana plantation who suspects his wife of having an affair.


It was described in The New York Times Book Review as "a technical masterpiece,
impeccably contrived".


But his novels were sometimes accused of resembling timetables or inventories.


The author was also associated with the new wave of French cinema, writing the
screenplay for Alain Resnais' Last Year at Marienbad and making several films
under his own name.


Among his movies are 1963's L'Immortelle (The Immortal), 1966's
Trans-Europ-Express, and 1968's L'Homme Qui Ment (The Man Who Lies).


His last novel, Un Roman Sentimental (A Sentimental Novel), was published in
2007.

 **Punch Press/damn the caesars
 http://damnthecaesars.org/

 Punch Press is a machine press used for cutting and shaping metal. Established in 2005, Punch Press is a small press poetry imprint committed to supporting work that ignites and destructs.

Dear Amy,

Thanks for your response.  Let me deal with some=20
of your points as I see them. I don=92t know if=20
these will satisfy you, but I=92ll try.


=93You claim that Bernstein's "revising literary=20

-- I'm not trying to be provocative here & I read=20
your excerpt, but I just don't understand what=20
you base this assumption on or why.  Did you=20

First, I don=92t =93claim=94 but say =93I suspect the=20

because Bernstein does say that =93=92hyperspace=92 of=20

that, indeed, the Cantos is in fact presenting =93a=20

piece.  Bernstein=92s =93claims=94 about Pound=92s=20
canonization are not in agreement with the=20
historical record.  Bernstein turns the criticism=20
of Pound upside down.  As a technician and=20
craftsman he was honored, as a political thinker=20
(including the fascism, the economics, the=20
monetary policies=ADyou name it) that Bernstein=20
says led to his =91acceptance) was almost always negatively critiqued.

=93Also, your argument on Pound seems to require an=20
either/or position -- Either Pound's poetry uses=20
the authorial voice of 'fascist aesthetics'=20
successfully or it legitimately uses the=20
polyvocal textuality that supports/explores the=20
indeterminate and its uncertain possibilities (& becomes a gothic?).=94

I say that=ADin keeping with the analysis so many=20
others have made=ADthat the =93multicultural=94 IS an=20
=93illusion,=94 an illusion because what looks like=20
polyvocality says the same thing over and=20
over.  This is not just my idea, but that of so=20
many of the best commentators on Pound.  Again,=20
you take a point that I consider to be worth=20
speculating about and turn it into something hard=20
and fast.  I say a question is begged as to=20
=93whether Poundian techniques, in particular the=20
cultural plundering, revising and activity of=20

repeats, the absence of a clearly defined=20
authorial voice, tend to undermine fascist=20

It=92s a question--

Amy, you say =93You state that using the former --=20
the "technology of fascism" ("The

absorbing indeterminacy for its own fascist use.=94

I=92m not sure I understand the point you were=20
trying to make.  My point=ADand that of other=20

Very sad.
I really love grappling with his work, trying to see it.  I laughed the
entire time while reading a cantankerous interview with him in
BookForum some time ago.  So mean to Richard Howard.
I would have loved to meet him and praise his work in bad French.
Should have sent that letter...

 I know many of you are familiar with Ren and this project from WOMPO and

a
satirical age -- either we are all wrong or...

Catherine

P.S.  I have not been reading the really excellent Pound discussion
carefully, but -- there's a wonderful book I once read about Italian fascis=
t
art shows -- much earlier than official art shows in some other european
countries which are not Italy -- how most every artist came because, sort o=
f
like the time share pitch, the fascist art show was the price one paid for
an otherwise sponsored trip to Italy.

Last time I will post about the protest poems project here, I promise.
But I wanted to let everyone know that the the project will continue.
The current compilation is online now www.protestpoems.org

and a call for the next action is out - for the Tunisian comedian H=E9di Ou=
led
Baballah.
Since he was arrested for satire, I am asking for satire.

There is a sign up form on the website if you would like to be alerted for
new calls.

I know these are unedited compilations (a voice is a voice, and I don't
think the people in prison care if it is off-key), so if you are concerned
about wanting to use the poem elsewhere- I will send the poem to the
diplomats, but leave it off the online compilation - using first letters or
other spacers to indicate your participation.

Please take the time to read about the project. I am sure most of us think
that protest letters are a waste of time. But they aren't. I have two
friends who can testify to that. If you link from "it has happened before",
you can find their poems.

Thanks for passing it on. Who would forget his marvellous screenplay
Last Year At Marienbad done for Alain Resnais - perhaps, by far, the
profoundest handling of the memory theme in cinema.

Didn't Robbe-Grillet work on several Godard projects too ?

French writer Robbe-Grillet dies







The writer's novels include Les Gommes and Le Voyeur Alain Robbe-Grillet,
the
French writer who pioneered the so-called "new novel" genre, has died at the
age of 85.


He was best Known for his unorthodox narratives, but enjoyed success, with
novels such as Les Gommes (The Erasers) and Le Voyeur still studied today.


He also worked in film, first as a scriptwriter and later as a director.


The novelist was admitted to the Caen University Hospital in France over the
weekend for cardiac problems and died on Monday morning, officials said.


Robbe-Grillet was born on 18 August, 1922, in Brest, western France.


The son of an engineer, he studied agricultural engineering and worked as a
statistician and an agronomist before finding fame as a writer.


Murder


He developed the idea of the "nouveau roman" in a series of essays in the
early
1960s.


Dispensing with traditional literary devices such as plot, narrative and
chronology, the new novel sees story subordinated to structure, with the
significance of objects more important than human action.


Les Gommes, his 1953 debut novel, remains among his most celebrated works
and
tells the story of a murder committed by the detective who has come to
investigate it.


In 1958's La Jalousie (Jealousy), Robbe-Grillet writes of a man living on a
banana plantation who suspects his wife of having an affair.


It was described in The New York Times Book Review as "a technical
masterpiece,
impeccably contrived".


But his novels were sometimes accused of resembling timetables or
inventories.


The author was also associated with the new wave of French cinema, writing
the
screenplay for Alain Resnais' Last Year at Marienbad and making several
films
under his own name.


Among his movies are 1963's L'Immortelle (The Immortal), 1966's
Trans-Europ-Express, and 1968's L'Homme Qui Ment (The Man Who Lies).


His last novel, Un Roman Sentimental (A Sentimental Novel), was published in

Whether or not Pound's stock is up or down out of all this, I do suggest, since I am just up to my knees in it, a read of Gabriel Gudding's rather phenomenal (in all senses of that word) RHODE ISLAND NOTEBOOK (Dalkey Archive, 2007). 'Astonislingly ambitious' probably a stupid phrase to apply to a work that is clearly compelled by a life obligation to literally drive through and face hell - with humor, insight, dread - there upon a cross that mixes the country, divorce, a child, mixed into the heavy Iraq national poisoned collective fog on an ironic bunch of roads that constitute getting back and forth between Normal and Providence (only our national version of  Pilgrims Progress could provide or nail anybody with that kind of municipal nominology!).
 On some level, from Gabriel's perspective,  the work gets to the exposed nails under whether or not Mr. Pound should be cast in or out as 'our' national literary faux relief doughboy.

 Apart from all that, in the new,but not so new China lit fix, in addition or apart from Mr. Pound, it seems to west coast prejudiced me to elevate equal or more significant attentions to translation and religio work of Kenneth Rexroth, Philip Whalen, Joanne Kyger, A Ginsberg and early work of Gary Snyder - obviously none of them oblivious to Pound, but certainly very significantly on their feet, and certainly casting strong shadows -say, via Naropa - on American writing of the last 50 years (Kenneth Koch and other NY satires of such not withstanding).

 Without wanting to be prejudicial, one impulsively wonders where Marjoria Perloff - as a member of the UPenn project in China - may stand in relationship to these contemporary American poetic traditions that have been shaped by Japanese, Chinese and India sources of meditation/concentration - essentially religous tradiitons.    Of course, what contemporary Chinese poets accept or dismiss of these traditions, undoubtedly, will also be of pivotal and on-going interest.

 I think its a great project on the part of UPenn - as far as I have read of it.

Gabriel Gudding <gmguddi@ILSTU.EDU> wrote: Dear Alison,

Thanks for helping me understand the way gender inflects your reading of
Pound and what you meant regarding the notion of the prophetic in Pound.

It does seem hard for us to follow each other, yes. I'm chalking that up
both to the overall political anxieties inhering in any reading of
modernism and keenly so in EP, and to the anxieties attending the way
posts to such a large listserv will inevitably be accidentally and
sometimes willfully misread as performative or ironic or hostile. I
assure you, my very substantial failings as a reader notwithstanding,
that I've no willful desire to misread you (scary, isn't it!?) :)

Because misreading is the word of the day, I'll, one last time, respond
to your repeated concern, repeated here by you with new phrasing,
despite some several posts to the contrary, that mine is a desire to
"annihilate" Pound's "poetry from the face of the earth." This seems
homologous to the paranoia about "dismissal" of authors. My response to
that concern is this: this concern strike me as a symptom of an anxiety
that a faith is being attacked.

Pound, as a conflicted object of faith, a faith constructed and policed,
is where the focus of my interest lies. I've been very grateful to be
reacquainted, through Amy King's posts and through Kenneth Sherwood,
Bernstein's account of his conflicted relationship to EP -- CB's quotes
P: "Faith is totalitarian. The mystery is totalitarian."

I am not attacking anyone's faith in EP. That faith and its object is
unassailable from without. In order to properly attack that faith, one
must adopt it and attacking it from within. Rather, I would again urge a
sociological reading of the institutions that surround and construct the
"belief" in Pound, the industry of Pound, the industry that creates,
maintains -- and then polices -- a belief in Pound. Not to destroy Pound
(he's safe, believe me), but to understand the canonizing function
itself as a dynamic that in part encourages, fosters, and cherishes
controversy as a means of provoking assent or, more aptly, submission.

This is merely another approach to reading EP -- not as an end in
itself, however (the modernist worry about the autonomous primacy of the
text) but as a means of understanding the sociology of
literature. Such a reading is not wrong. And it's not an attempt to
efface the poetry, which is, as always, an interesting read.

Fascist poetics is an apt phrasing. The fascist ideal of a populist
authoritarian charismatic leader seeking to forge a state in which all
individuality is subordinated to the leader's conception of that state
is in many interesting ways homologous to canonicity. The desire to
police a reading of Pound is what is wrought by the field.

We remember controversy vividly. That is why it arises both as an
individual tactic (posts re masculine transgressor) and a structural
element.

As such, the canon needs an enemy. Pound needs an enemy. Expect yourself
to be called the enemy if you ready beyond what the field consitutes as
"Pound." Sometimes that enemy is "dismissal," sometimes that enemy is
elitism, sometimes that enemy is misreading, sometimes that enemy is the
author herself or himself. In Pound's case -- and this is what makes him
so intransigent -- that enemy is Pound himself.

Anyway, take care and be well -- and be happy, Alison!

Warmly,
Gabriel

Gabe, thanks for your post. Just one thing, while we're speaking of
misreading: the line you pick up (annihilating Pound from the face of the
earth as an abomination) is a consciously hyperbolic response to your own
rather old testament language. You are thundering from the pulpit rather
when you condemn Pound as an ABOMINATION, and it made me smile when you so
misunderstood my use of "prophecy" (which I used thoughtlessly in the most
banal way possible), in the same way I've been smiling at your aggressively
masculinist, nay, controversial, defences of women in poetry, in which you
point out how the discourse of masculinist controversy has been used to
sideline many fair and deserving damsels.

Of course you can't "destroy" Pound, any more than I can make him a saint.
But there have been times and still are places where writers of all sorts of
stripes have been banned or worse because of the supposed evil of their
work. I can never hear such statements without unease.

I do not have "faith" in Pound - how can anyone have faith in him? I read
his poems. Here in my study, on the wrong continent, writing the wrong sort
of poems, interested in the wrong artforms, even suspiciously pulpy and
gothic, I am too far away to see what I'm supposed to be submitting to. I'm
glad this conversation has prompted me to take the Cantos off the shelves
and read them again.

Myself, I would like to think poetry is about other possibilities besides
the formation of enemies in order to maintain our creakily paranoid and
destructive selves. Now that's utopic, since the world of poetry proves me
wrong all the time, as indeed you point out, and it seems to be the shape of
our wider political lives. I'm sorry it's like that, and I would like the
world to be otherwise. I also know that, on a small scale, it can be.

All best

Alison

Gudding,
I found that comment to be extremely rude and condescending.
Kenneth's reaction was perfectly reasonable, and I think much more
nuanced than you are giving him credit for, and yet in spite of that
you felt the need to challenge his teaching ability and lament for
his students. Look to thine own house, Gabe.

All the best,
Jason

Is anybody following this plagarism claim from Hillary Clinton. Local
news just ran footage of the Obama speech in question. The gist is a
series of quotes of other campaign speeches, followed by the refrain
"just words" ("'We hold these truths to be self-evident'... just
words? "Ask not what your country can do for you'... just words?",
etc). It turns out this bit of rhetoric was uttered by Patrick Duvall
in 2006, according to their archive footage. Both, I take it, were
defending themselves against claims that their rhetoric was empty.

So, if I follow right. There is meta-criticism of Obama's rhetoric
(i.e. that it is 'merely rhetoric'), followed by Obama's meta-textual
response (i.e. "are these words merely words") followed by the meta-
critical point that the Obama speech was "plagarism", but not
mentioning that it was plagarism of a speech made up mostly of other
speeches.

Apparently, she governs not only in prose, but in critical prose.

I have been reading the fury of arguments around Pound the last two weeks,
or so, with some bemusement because to me they have the quality of a
discussion about the weather, whether winter or summer is good or bad. Let
me explain.

a) To me, there is no doubt that any argument about American poetry today
would have been impossible without the existence of Ezra Pound. Or, if we
could conceive his non-existence, our concepts of American poetry would hav=
e
been so different that it would be impossible for us to imagine them. This
importance goes beyond good or bad poetry, beyond which of Ezra Pound's poe=
m
are good or bad. It has to do with the shaping of thought, what a poem is o=
r
can be, what a translation is or can be, what diction in a poem is or can
be, etc. Olson, Creeley, Spicer, Duncan, Williams, Zukofsky, etc, etc., are
all chIldren of Pound, more than Eliot ever was. He brought a sense of
liberation, the entitlement of the poet over language, to poetry which very
few of us would like to close the door and leave behind (Gabriel, do you
think your wonderful, fantastic *rhode island notebook* could have been
written without Pound? How many "experimental" poets today could
simultaneously appreciate and support poets as diverse as Frost, Eliot and
Zukofsky?).

b) As a human being (at least as a political human being), Pound was a
creep. His appellation as "insane" was obviously a legal fig leaf used to
prevent him from going to jail and having the key thrown away, even being
executed, something achieved by poets (Jews, enemies, friends) who honored
his contributions as a poet.

These contradictions are facts. I do not see exactly what these arguments
are doing, except making poets feel good about themselves for liking and
admiring a poet whose political views are loathsome to them. For example,
Gabe, what was the exact purpose of your original post which I think starte=
d
these discussions. Do you want to stop teaching American poetry after
Emerson and Whitman? Do you really think there was a conscious conspiracy t=
o
"canonize" Pound as a male chauvinist, phallic icon? Is it not rather that =
a
number of poets, some of them quite different, were instinctively drawn to
him, used and defended him, something still going on, including among women
writers, as Alison's and Amy's posts here demonstrate?

As for Charles's claim that the collage structure is basically democratic
(therefore, as a creator Pound not a fascist): I can see how the collage
structure of *The Cantos* has something to do with the liberating, opening
impact of Pound as a poet, though I do not thing it is nearly the only
thing. But I do not think a poetic form does, can contain a political stanc=
e
per se. It can function very differently, with different social impacts, in
the hands of different poets. Let me give a recent example: the flarf
practice of harvesting words and references from the web for
ironical/poetical purposes is utterly within the framework of collage (also
quite Poundian). But this decoupling of references from their autonomous
place and existence (withlittle awarness that this is being done) is deeply
exploitative, offensive to me.

Ciao,

Barry,

I remember the great effect *The Erasers* had on me when I first read it. I
was in London at that time. It was with that novel I discovered how a
disciplined depiction of physical object can capture traces of time
(accumulation of different traces of dust in different places).

Ciao,

Murat

Subject:      pound & heteroglossia -- and the radio broadcasts
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1; format=flowed
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

Mike Heller's take on polyglossia in EP is akin to Bakhtin's thoughts on
heteroglossia in novelized genres.

Upshot is, at least in Bakhtinian terms, Mike Heller is more right, CB
less so: EP's work is not truly "polyvocal" in any fully Bakhtinian sense.

Bakhtin formulates heteroglossia as NOT just about many voices. It's a
spectrum of many registers, a huge part of which is humor.

Bakhtin provides a list of descriptors for what is heteroglossia,
insisting that heteroglossia is "permeated with laughter, humor,
elements of self-parody." Those are elements sorely lacking in ep
cantos. (This as found in "Epic and Novel: Toward a Methodology of the
Study of the Novel," as found in a few places, but I'm looking at is in
David Duff's edition of _Modern Genre Theory_).

More importantly EP's cantos reinforce rather than revise literariness
and poeticalness -- and assert a national epic past and a national epic
distance. Most importantly, they are the speech (or "a" speech) of
official elite literary culture. They are not the speech of the "low,"
which is what MB says is a great part of dialogic heteroglossia as he
formulates it.

MB also insists that tragedy was always a polyglot genre and that
polyglossia always existed -- so merely containing many voices is NOT
itself some kind of structural radicalism.

In short, /The Cantos/ are not poly- or heteroglossic.

But Pound's *radio broadcasts* are. It's in the radio broadcasts -- as
texts -- that Pound becomes heteroglossic in a truly Bakhtinian sense.
(I've only read them, not listened to them). His sick humor -- racist,
murderous, paranoid, whackjobby, yet weirdly self-parodic -- really
comes to the fore. If you can consider the radio speeches "permeated
with laughter, humor, elements of self-parody," you can see them as more
dialogically polyglossic in a Bakhtinian sense. This coupled with the
fact that they are both oral and written "text."

Those who've read /The Cantos/, especially /The Pisan Cantos/, and
who've not yet done so, might also read Leonard W. Doob's 1978 _Ezra
Pound Speaking: Radio Speeches of WWII_ by Greenwood Press. It contains,
as far as I know, the only collection in print of EP's war era speeches.
The collection is not quite exhaustive, but almost all of them are there.

In appendix 4 Doob "in serious jest" describes the speeches as
"The Poor Man's Cantos." These are in some ways the real footnotes to
the Cantos, esp the Pisans.

Doob's appendices are interesting. Charts provide rough plot of his
topics and types of persons/institutions mentioned.

There is a 22 page glossary and index of names.

It appears the only copies left new are hardbound.

I was saddened to read of Robbe-Grillet's passing in today's NY Times.  He was a hero of mine in my teens.  I loved his early novels and films but lost interest in his work after he got involved with sadomasochistic content.  I have no idea what his later work is like.  Perhaps he returned to the "greatness" and rigor of his early work, both in novels and in film.  Fortunately or unfortunately, I have no idea.  Regards, Tom Savage

[this sad news just in -- I met him once, briefly, in 1982 at Catholic
University -- My favorite passage from his critical work:

"My novels have not been received, upon publication in France, with
unanimous
enthusiasm . . . "]





French writer Robbe-Grillet dies







The writer's novels include Les Gommes and Le Voyeur Alain Robbe-Grillet,
the
French writer who pioneered the so-called "new novel" genre, has died at the
age of 85.


He was best Known for his unorthodox narratives, but enjoyed success, with
novels such as Les Gommes (The Erasers) and Le Voyeur still studied today.


He also worked in film, first as a scriptwriter and later as a director.


The novelist was admitted to the Caen University Hospital in France over the
weekend for cardiac problems and died on Monday morning, officials said.


Robbe-Grillet was born on 18 August, 1922, in Brest, western France.


The son of an engineer, he studied agricultural engineering and worked as a
statistician and an agronomist before finding fame as a writer.


Murder


He developed the idea of the "nouveau roman" in a series of essays in the
early
1960s.


Dispensing with traditional literary devices such as plot, narrative and
chronology, the new novel sees story subordinated to structure, with the
significance of objects more important than human action.


Les Gommes, his 1953 debut novel, remains among his most celebrated works
and
tells the story of a murder committed by the detective who has come to
investigate it.


In 1958's La Jalousie (Jealousy), Robbe-Grillet writes of a man living on a
banana plantation who suspects his wife of having an affair.


It was described in The New York Times Book Review as "a technical
masterpiece,
impeccably contrived".


But his novels were sometimes accused of resembling timetables or
inventories.


The author was also associated with the new wave of French cinema, writing
the
screenplay for Alain Resnais' Last Year at Marienbad and making several
films
under his own name.


Among his movies are 1963's L'Immortelle (The Immortal), 1966's
Trans-Europ-Express, and 1968's L'Homme Qui Ment (The Man Who Lies).


His last novel, Un Roman Sentimental (A Sentimental Novel), was published in
2007.

his exquisitely excruciating slo-mo description of a
crowd of people moving through a passageway of the
Metro?

Yes, his early novels are amazing, as is L'Annee derniere a Marienbad.=0AIn=
cidentally, as part of that same weekend, there was a sort of symposium whe=
re various artists were called upon to speak about Robbe-Grillet and his in=
fluence on their work, and Robbe-Grillet was supposed to speak and answer t=
heir questions. Everything was going fine until the senior figure among the=
 artists, Dan Graham, started talking about how, back in the '60s, for the =
New York artists, French writing was their ideal, their favorite critic was=
 Roland Barthes, and of course in part through Barthes they came to the nou=
veau roman, which totally inspired them, they read all of them....and then =
he added, "Of course, I preferred Michel Butor!" Well, you should have seen=
 Robbe-Grillet's eyebrows go up when his translator passed that on to him. =
From then on in, everything Dan said made Robbe-Grillet angrier and angrier=
, even the most anodyne things, and finally Robbe-Grillet stormed off.=0AI =
once met his wife, now widow, Catherine. She was (maybe still is) a famous =
dominatrix.=0A=0A----- Original Message ----=0AFrom: Murat Nemet-Nejat <mur=

 On the larger level, I suggest to any of us that we take any line or phrase out of any of our poems, critical papers, whatever, and put that phrase into a "Google Search" and most claims of being "original" will go up in smoke (and sometime very interesting smoke in that Google will produce curious bed fellows, girls, children. parents, elders and non-tribal relatives - bordering on the ultimate poly-glossolalia.

 Local
news just ran footage of the Obama speech in question. The gist is a
series of quotes of other campaign speeches, followed by the refrain
"just words" ("'We hold these truths to be self-evident'... just
words? "Ask not what your country can do for you'... just words?",
etc). It turns out this bit of rhetoric was uttered by Patrick Duvall
in 2006, according to their archive footage. Both, I take it, were
defending themselves against claims that their rhetoric was empty.

So, if I follow right. There is meta-criticism of Obama's rhetoric
(i.e. that it is 'merely rhetoric'), followed by Obama's meta-textual
response (i.e. "are these words merely words") followed by the meta-
critical point that the Obama speech was "plagarism", but not
mentioning that it was plagarism of a speech made up mostly of other
speeches.

Apparently, she governs not only in prose, but in critical prose.

*Artifact Reading Series Announces a New Partnership With the Oakland Art
Gallery*

* *Artifact: a reading series of innovative writing, is pleased to announce
that it will soon return from its hiatus in a new location at the Oakland
Art Gallery.  Centrally located in the hustle and bustle of downtown
Oakland's Frank H. Ogawa Plaza, the Oakland Art Gallery provides a vital
site for national and regional envelope-pushing visual artists to display
work ranging from painting and sculpture to video and new media.  The
writers Artifact has hosted--who range from post-Language writers like
Juliana Spahr and Lisa Robertson to New Narrative writers like Robert Gluck
and Dodie Bellamy--are certainly no strangers to unknown aesthetic
territory, and this shared aesthetic, as well as the beauty of the space
itself, makes the Oakland Art Gallery an ideal venue for hosting Artifact's
textual experiments.  This partnership will have its official kick off on
March 22nd, 2008, with a reading by David Buuck, Craig Perez, and Leslie
Scalapino.

Artifact began in San Francisco's Mission District on November 20, 2004, in
the living room of longtime friends and writers Melissa Benham and Chana
Morgenstern. Recognizing a need for a new experimental poetry and prose
venue, they began the Artifact Reading Series, which quickly became a vital
social and artistic gathering spot for many Bay Area writers. Since then,
the reading series has garnered praise in a number of newspaper and magazine
articles.  Venus Zine called it a "place for renegade literature," and
Michelle Tea, writing in the San Francisco Bay Guardian, wrote that the
series hearkens back to the "cozy salons of yore." Artifact maintains a
partnership with Hooke Press (www.hookepress.com), which publishes chapbooks
of "poetry, criticism, theory, writing, and ephemera" by past Artifact
readers and other innovative writers, as well as Digital Artifact (
www.digitalartifactmagazine.com), an online journal interrogating narrative
in contemporary culture through fiction, criticism, experimental prose, and
web-based audio-visual work.

Artifact is a Member of the Intersection Incubator, a program of
Intersection for the Arts (www.theintersection.org) providing fiscal
sponsorship, incubation and consulting services to artists.

Thank you for this anecdote Barry. This is the Robbe-Grillet I admire too --
amazing how translational barriers reconfigure a character like
Robbe-Grillet so entirely into the American context. Like Graham, Vito
Acconci recently wrote (in the new intro for his the 0 to 9 reprint put out
by Ugly Duckling Presse) that he considered himself sort of the
Robbe-Grillet to Bernadette Mayer's Sarraute!!! The crossover from the new
novel into the minimal / conceptual arts scene in New York in the 60s is
really fascinating to me. In this way, I can't help but read (& I'd argue
one might well read)
Jealousy<http://mydearcountess.blogspot.com/2007/09/alain-robbe-grillet-jealousy-window-is.html>(still
my favorite, why no mention of this title around?), The Erasers,
Djinn (tho later) & even the autobiographical Ghosts in the Mirror in
company with the conceptual writing projects like those of Graham and
Acconci in the 60s/70s. Perverse, but I think productive.

Also yes, I hear Catherine is still entertains as dominatrix. World
renowned. In digging these passageways I would recommend her fantastic
erotic text The Image (written under the alias Jean de Berg --
interestingly, a figure that plays prominent in Robbe-Grillet's
collaboration with Rauschenberg). Recently, in an autobiographical work,
Catherine admitted that Robbe-Grillet wrote the introduction to this work
under the (fittingly unprovable at the time!) pseudonym Pauline Reage!

I blogged around this idea
once<http://jhenrychunko.blogspot.com/search/label/catherine%20robbe-grillet>(&along
some bondage side-tracks).

You are aware that Obama has admitted it and said he should have
given credit? It was a headline yesterday, hard to miss.

Unlikely that, if he gets the nomination, he'll look like a boy scout
when the Republicans are finished with him.

Re: the Bob Dylan lyric is from the song "I Shall Be Free"
The full verse from "The Freewheeling Bob Dylan"  is:

Now, the man on the stand he wants my vote
He's a-runnin' for office on a ballot note
He's out there preachin' in' front of the steeple
Tellin' me he loves all kinds of people.
He's eatin' bagels, he's eatin' pizzas, he's eatin' chitlins.

He never sings the last line that's printed in the Bob Dylan Lyrics book:

He's eatin' bullshit.

Instead he would make this wild disgusted sort of "whe---eww!" sound,
which has a similar connotation--but is noteworthy because its a
"swallowed" lyric.

There's other versions, such as "I Shall Be Free No. 10" on "Another
Side of Bob Dylan" with this verse:

Now, I'm liberal, but to a degree
I want ev'rybody to be free
But if you think that I'll let Barry Goldwater
Move in next door and marry my daughter
You must think I'm crazy!
I wouldn't let him do it for all the farms in Cuba.

This lyric is curious because Dylan mentions his admiration for
Goldwater in the recent _Chronicles_ book,
even though,.for some reason,  & I know I'm crazy, I keep thinking he
means Paul Wellstone.
I like the way he turns the tables on a lot of racist rhetoric in
these lines, switches the code.  He did it once, he can do it again.

my sense is that almost all of them are NOT there and that doob
selected no more than a third of the total for his edition. as i wrote
a while back:

"the finding aid for the beinecke library's pound collection lists 492
folders with radio speeches. this does not mean 492 discrete speeches
as some are undoubtedly duplicates. there's also a folder titled "300
radiodiscorzi" (sounds so much better in italian), possibly a table of
contents for an italian edition that pound wanted to publish. in any
case, the 105 speeches doob printed in ezra pound speaking are likely
only 1/3 or less of the total extant radio speeches."
<http://heuriskein.blogspot.com/2006/03/antheil-pound-etc.html>

to be exact, the finding aid
<http://webtext.library.yale.edu/xml2html/beinecke.pound1.con.html#SIV>
lists them as "Radio Articles A-Z" (Box 128 Folder 5312 thru Box 134
Folder 5804)

Murat,

The answers to your questions are available already in my posts. The
original post was a response to a notification from the MLA publications
committee about the new Pound volume. No I do not want to "stop teaching
American poetry after Emerson and Whitman." The how and why of the kind
of pedagogy I've adopted is amply explained in my previous posts.

Alison,

I do not "condemn" EP as an abomination. But instead *teach* EP as an
abomination -- in the technical, not euphemistic, sense of the word: as
something in part ominously constructed of hatred and disgust that in
turn inspires hatred and disgust to the point of ethical confusion. A
pedagogical approach to Pound as a case study through which to teach the
sociology of consecration and the canonizing function -- is not aberrant
nor incorrect, just another way to approach literature. So, for I think
the 5th time: no condemnation or dismissal.

Kenneth,

A public apology to accompany the backchannel apology to you about the
presumptuous tone of my reply about your student: I regretted that post
as soon as it left my send button.

Best,

Gabe

Can you please be more specific, Murat? It sounds sort of like you find
collage in general exploitative and offenseive. I expect that isn't what you
mean.

Certainly collage (whether visual, wordular, or sonic) *can* be exploitative
and offensive. But it seems to me necessarily a case-by-case issue rather
than being able to tag an entire genre or method (or whatever) as inherantly
exploitative and offensive. I expect this isn't what you meant to do.

Thanks, Doug. I am glad you picked up and ran with this Dylan piece!
 At least Obama does not seem to be super slippery,or hypocritical about his choice of "covers"  - an editorialist was joking about Obama as the first Presidential candidate to do  'covers' for other peoples songs, words. Why not if they are good choices? A little credit helps.  (Help if I remembered the name of the editorial writer, too, for his 'concept.')
 I like the rap producer - who did not claim to be a singer - but has become a Utube success by just reciting Obama's speeches with to a rap sound back track. Loop-de-loo! Everybody seems to be getting into it. The restoration of speech, taking it  back from the "arrogant, paranoid pre-emptive 'my way or the highway'beligerants!'    Breathing again, so to speak.

 'I am not there'. Je suis un autre. Bull shit. Vote!

There must, Tom, be an interesting story behind that discrepancy
because on page
428 of the Greenwood Press edition, in appendix 3, doob says, "Now that the
actual texts of almost all the broadcasts are available in this book...."

It makes a person wonder if Doob wasn't shown all the transcripts. Robert H.
Walker does mention in the foreward, dated Febr 1978, that the "Pound Literary
Trustees" were reluctant to have the transcripts in print: "We applaud, then,
the respect for a complete historic record which has allowed the Pound
Literary
Trustees to overcome an understandable reluctance toward seeing these
scripts in
print." (page x)

On the other hand, in the last paragraph of doob's intro, Doob lists
himself as
one of the "Pound Literary Trustees." So one has to wonder if Doob himself
misrepresented their quantity in order to hide some (even more) unpleasant
content.

Doob writes, too, "Neither the Italian archives, for example, nor an
examination
of the papers at the Beinecke Library at Yale University have revealed
why Pound
ceased broadcasting between July 26, 1942, and February 18, 1943,"
which makes a
person wonder if those broadcasts aren't "a missing 18 minutes." The
first thing
that comes to mind is perhaps EP'd learned of and commented on, during that
time, the Nazi genocides.

a while back:

"the finding aid for the beinecke library's pound collection lists 492
folders with radio speeches. this does not mean 492 discrete speeches
as some are undoubtedly duplicates. there's also a folder titled "300
radiodiscorzi" (sounds so much better in italian), possibly a table of
contents for an italian edition that pound wanted to publish. in any
case, the 105 speeches doob printed in ezra pound speaking are likely
only 1/3 or less of the total extant radio speeches."

to be exact, the finding aid
<http://webtext.library.yale.edu/xml2html/beinecke.pound1.con.html#SIV>
lists them as "Radio Articles A-Z" (Box 128 Folder 5312 thru Box 134
Folder 5804)

After a preliminary meeting between Councilman Rosendahl's staff and
City Attorney Delgadillo's staff that concluded today, the issue of
Beyond
Baroque's lease extension enters a new phase.

The City Attorney plans to make a recommendation that all city-owned
properties have their leases put up for bid on expiration. This means
not only Beyond Baroque but every property owned by the city that
houses a non-profit or any other charitable entity will be required
to bid for its lease renewal on the open market. Councilman Rosendahl
intends to advocate for a review process that would take community
needs into consideration before granting a lease, so that gives
Beyond Baroque at least a fighting chance.

The crisis is not over, however, since there must be community
support for a review process that gives fair hearing to community
needs.

Thanks to the over 400 email messages received by Councilman
Rosendahl's office over the weekend he is firmly in support of Beyond
Baroque, so  gratitude to everyone who answered Amelie's call for
help.

Richard Modiano,

Here's a link to the uncensore Michelle Obama clip. Apparently many news

i do alot of collage itis both exploitative and freely creative  the
exploitative quality
is the ustilization of extant materials not one's own
the freedom is in the making them into something wholey new
there are 2 sides to this collaging of image and words
(stealing/borrowing  recontextualizing)
possibly a worthy discussion   enough with pound already
too much for this illiterate to handle

Murat says it all very well.  I would only add another little bit of
historical context: that there are periods--some fairly recent--in
which some people do see form and technique, not as neutral, but as
political and cultural matters and attribute all kinds of bad
politics and motives to those who don't write like they do.  No more
need be said.

There must, Tom, be an interesting story behind that discrepancy because
on page 428 of the Greenwood Press edition, in appendix 3, doob says,
"Now that the actual texts of almost all the broadcasts are available in
this book...."

It makes a person wonder if Doob wasn't shown all the transcripts.
Robert H. Walker does mention in the foreword, dated Febr 1978, that the
"Pound Literary Trustees" were reluctant to have the transcripts in
print: "We applaud, then, the respect for a complete historic record
which has allowed the Pound Literary Trustees to overcome an
understandable reluctance toward seeing these scripts in print." (page x)

In the last paragraph of doob's intro, he lists himself as one of the
"Pound Literary Trustees."

Doob writes, too, "Neither the Italian archives, for example, nor an
examination of the papers at the Beinecke Library at Yale University
have revealed why Pound ceased broadcasting between July 26, 1942, and
February 18, 1943."

It makes a person wonder if those broadcasts aren't "a missing 18
minutes." And if so, why.

Michael,

I was making my comments about the basic neutrality of forms with complete
awareness of what you are saying. I am glad you picked up on that point.

I can't speak for Murat, of course, but I'd say that collage is just like all the
other forms/genres: basically offensive unless well handled. Art is lying. It is a
presentation of the false in a false context in order to try to produce a
metaphoric or analogic truth. So, unless the thing is done elegantly and well,
all you get is an awkward lie, which is, let's face it, pretty offensive.

Collage itself has the added burden of being a collection of other people's lies,
so the chances of getting the presentation-of-lies-to-tell-truth right are a good
deal worse. The collagist is relying on viewers of the collage to be aware of
the original sources of the material, and the original context of that material,
together with the new context the collagist is presenting, so there is a lot more
room for stumbling and failure, and there is, in fact, a lot more stumbling and
failure.

FEBRUARY 22 - DAVID MCGIMPSEY IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA

David McGimpsey, author of Sitcom, visits L.A. -- well, Santa Monica, =20=

Finding any art offensive is not only a slippery slope, it shows a very narrow perspective.  I'm not saying all art is good.  Much of it is secondrate or worse just by the definitions of these terms.  But to be offended by anyone's art, unless it shows a murder or a rape that actually happened and was perpetrated in order to make the art, say, or something equally extreme like that, betrays a squeamishness that is a limitation of the critical faculty of the person being offended.  I sometimes receive poetry that I don't like.  But to say that I'm offended by it would be an overstatement. I feel much more offended by the bad politics of the current American regime and, for example, felt terribly offended by the Taliban's destruction of Bamiyan in Afghanistan some years ago.  Things like that in the so-called real world are much more of an occasion for feeling offended than anything in the realms of the arts.  As for Pound as a poet and collagist, the record of his collected
 works is mixed but none of it offends me.  I might feel different about that if I were Jewish but I am not.  Does a poet have the right to be or to have been wrong in some of his works?  Perhaps yes, perhaps no.  Baraka's recent perpetuation of a false rumor about 9/11 first caused me to think much about this.  But to deny a poet the right to be ever wrong smacks of perfectionism.  No one I know of inside or outside the arts has achieved perfection.   Regards, Tom Savage

I agree with you, mostly, Steve.  Collage is freely creative for the most part.  To call it exploitative because it takes already existing materials created by others is an exaggeration having possibly to do with an obsession with ownership which collaging rightly challenges, at least in my opinion.  Regards, Tom Savage

point  well  and badly taken tom since you are a good friend and claim to
be a practicing buddhist

so remember the old statement "you don' t have to be jewish to eat levy's
rye bread"
well doesn't that apply to anti-semitism, pound aside, byou don't have to
be jewish to be against those who are anti-semites
major problem in world  you say "if i were jewish"
 as if it's ok to not be offended by not the ART  but the sentiment
behind the ART or statements
because you are NOT a jew
i love baraka, pound but cannot excuse they're possible, and as always
with these horrors
that cause so much pain in the world bad judgement, excesses of prejudice

(which we all have and and have encountered)
if i said i hate buddhists  would that then bug you?
but yes sure everyone has the right to be WRONG not just the poet
tho the way poets act you'd think they think they're never WRONG
does bush  hitler stalin extremes of course have the right to be wrong
when in their warped judgements
they perhaps think they were / are right as pound no doubt did
excuse a wrong?  why  who's right and who's wrong anyway?  something for
a buddhist to think about
a talmudic buddhist perhaps......

Lyric & Spirit: Selected Essays 1996-2008

To order Lyric & Spirit:   go to www.omnidawn.com/hlazer389
Lyric & Spirit -- the first compilation of essays by Hank Lazer
following his ground-breaking and much revered two volume Opposing
Poetries -- offers twelve years of incisive writing at the
intersection of two of the more contentiously debated topics in
current letters. Drawing on poetic traditions as seemingly disparate
as Language writing and Buddhist poetry, Lazer pursues a way of
reading that is rich in the music and spirit of the word, attuning
readers to the pleasures and range of possibilities for innovative
poetry. In a very accessible writing style, and with flashes of
brilliance, Lazer explores and identifies new approaches to the lyric
and to the writing of spiritual experience in American poetry of the
past one hundred years. In this book of essays, interviews,
reflections, and more, Lazer focuses on two topics central to the
poetry of our time: the changing nature of beauty in the lyric and the
necessity of finding new ways of embodying spirituality. By bringing a
wide range of perspectives to his readings -- from the jazz of Monk
and Coltrane to the philosophy of Heidegger and Derrida -- Lazer's
essays inspire readers to enter into a renewed and renewing
relationship with poetry.

organized by the Publishers & Booksellers Guild. Every
year, a focal theme country is given a large pavilion
to showcase its countries' books and publishers. The
United States was selected for 2008 and US Kolkata
Literary Exchange (USKLE) was created to organize this
event with the Consulate General of the United States
of America in Kolkata. The bookfair was supposed to be
held from January 30 to February 10, 2008, but it was
BANNED!

In the aftermath of the cancellation of the Kolkata
Book Fair by the High Court, USKLE (US-Kolkata
Literary Exchange), the organization sponsoring the
visit to India by 15 American writers including
Pulitzer Prize-winning poet Yusef Komunyakaa, revised
it's schedule of events. A number of the American
readings, seminars, and presentations were hosted by
the Bangla Akademi with additional events around town
including a poetry jam session with Native American
poet Joy Harjo and Bob Holman from New York at the
Park Hotel on January 31, 2008 and a special
presentationon "Give Peace a Chance" at the Bengal
Club on February 4, 2008 hosted by Subodh Sarkar and
Mallika Sengupta. Yusef Komunyakaa gave a special
reading accompanied by a Baul singer on February 8,
2008 also at the Park Hotel.


USKLE delegation members Goutam Datta, Ram Devineni,
and Catherine Fletcher worked closely with the
Publishers and Booksellers Guild as well as Sunil
Gangopadhyay, Subodh Sarkar, and Mallika Sengupta and
the Bengali literary community to create the amended
program. Despite the setbacks, the American delegation
announced the release of its commemorative anthology,
A Mingling of Waters, at the symbolic opening of the
Book Fair at Town Hall. Copies were presented to West
Bengal's Chief Minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee by the
delegation and its publisher, Supernova, and were on
sale at the Bangla Akademi. The delegation used the
retooled schedule as an opportunity for its writers to
get to know the city of Kolkata, its writers, and its
residents more intimately.

Subject:      re Pound & a great many Pound videos at my blog
MIME-Version: 1.0

A couple days ago i put a great many videos of Pound at my blog,
including one of the radio broadcasts.  there are also some related
videos of Homages to Pound from various people in various media,
Mussolini's last speech, Mussolini and Hitler, but mostly its is Pound
reading-- as well as my favorite one of them all--
Pasolini reading to Pound in Italian, as Pound sits listening.

http://davidbaptistechirot.blogspot.com

I think if one reads the definition of the fasces given below, one has
an idea of a possible different approach to the structure of the
Cantos.
A binding together of the elements, the rods, to the axe (axis)  to
give the "strength in unity."
I've been writing  and thinking about this in terms of Pound's
ventriloquism, uses of masks (influence of the Greek and Noh theaters)
and his great lifelong interest in Confucian Authoritarianism as well
as the fascist period which developed later in his life.
The issue of treason is very important--Pound was charged indicted and
faced prison, if not having been  adjudged mentally incompetent to
stand trial so to speak.

The treason comes from his KNOWING BETTER WHAT WAS GOOD FOR
AMERICA--which he of course had left  very long ago.
The ventriloquism and masks are related with Pound's "personae," in
which the "documentary" aspects of his  materials are transformed in
to an Epic Docu-Drama, a "soap opera" of serial Cantos,--(i don't mean
soap opera disparagingly)-

Montage, whose greatest theoretican and practitioner may still well be
the Jewish Gay Soviet Marxist Sergei Eisenstein, was also greatly
influenced by the Chinese ideogram, which Eisenstein studied in some
detail and writes of in his essays.
The equating of montage with being "less liberatory" as it were than
collage I think would greatly surprise Eisenstein.

Also Pound is not as "Euro-centric" at all as Bernstein makes
out--indeed the new association with Chinese poetry begun by Bernstein
and Perloff is an example of over a century's such studies, interests,
translations, exchanges among Chinese and American writers and writing
in which Pound played a large role in the West.
(And one might ask what sorts of conflicts this new association raises
with China's imprisoning so many poets and artists--if their civil and
human rights are or not a question in this--)

It is not the elements in the work which make it fascist or not, but
the manner in which Pound personally binds them into   fasces of the
Cantos.
This is why so many poets the world over have been influenced and
inspired by Pound in spite of his personal politics and
prejudices--they have learned from him without having Pound's drive to
become a Dictator, the "Great Communicator" or "Mr Know-it-All"
dictating "poetry and public policy" to the masses.

The fascism of Pound was defeated, he was charged with treason and
rather than being embraced due to his fascism, shunned by  great many
readers and writers the world over for this.  What has gained him his
recognition is his contributions to writing--as Murat pointed out,
this list would not exist without Pound's work.


Pound's sense of having failed with the Cantos in the sense of their
not ultimately cohering is something learned by a great deal of
Twentieth Century efforts towards creating a "Total Work."  Not even
Einstein was  able to realize the Einsteinian Unified Field Theory.

This is a fascist era in the US, and rather than denying fascism as it
 operates in a work or is found in groups and persons, one needs to
study this, in order to more clearly see and hear the fascism all
around one.

The radio broadcasts of Pound are a prototype of Talk Radio and cable
news and the Memri disinformation and censored newspapers.  Propaganda
is so prevalent it becomes invisible, taken for "the way things really
are" rather than for the manner which they have been designed to
appear.
Pretty much most of the discourse one hears and sees and reads is in
varying degrees directed and controled by these voices, images, words,
discourses all round  one, even in the ways one may imagine one is
"resisting" or embracing things which announce  themselves being
"oppositional the unquestioning acceptance of Authority is disturbing.

How many "natural" thoughts and responses are not the result of a
lifetime of training? How many words does one read and silently nod in
agreement without really wondering what they may mean as they are
being used?

How does this function to create every more conformity and acquiesence
to Authority, in every area of life?
"Question Authority"  becomes ever more displaced by "don't question
Authority"--
and questions to do with poetry and politics as with everything else
become reduced, as Orwell predicted, to ever smaller vocabularies of
catch phrases and doublespeak.



here are definitions from  Paxton, found at Wikipedia, followed by the
quote from Leonard Peltier i used in a letter before.
I think what he is addressing is what Naomi Wolff also does in The End
of America Letter to a Young Patriot--how much these times are
following very closely the  rise of Nazi Germany and the compliance of
the citizenry and government as their rights are systemically taken
away and their society is turned into  nothing more than a War
Machine.

The term fascismo was coined by the Italian Fascist dictator Benito
Mussolini and Hegelian philosopher Giovanni Gentile. It is derived
from the Italian word fascio, which means "bundle" or "union",[9] and
from the Latin word fasces. The fasces, which consisted of a bundle of
rods tied around an axe, were an ancient Roman symbol of the authority
of the civic magistrates, and the symbolism of the fasces suggested
strength through unity: a single rod is easily broken, while the
bundle is difficult to break. It is also strongly associated with the
fascist militia "fasci italiani di combattimento" ("League of
Combat")A form of political behavior marked by obsessive preoccupation
with community decline, humiliation or victimhood and by compensatory
cults of unity, energy and purity, in which a mass-based party of
committed nationalist militants, working in uneasy but effective
collaboration with traditional elites,\
 abandons democratic liberties and pursues with redemptive violence
and without ethical or legal restraints goals of internal cleansing
and external expansion


Paxton further defines fascism's essence as:
...a sense of overwhelming crisis beyond reach of traditional
solutions; 2. belief one's group is the victim, justifying any action
without legal or moral limits; 3. need for authority by a natural
leader above the law, relying on the superiority of his instincts
; 4. right of the chosen people to dominate others without legal or
moral restraint; 5. fear of foreign `contamination."


The government under pretext of security and progress liberated us
from our land, resources, culture, dignity and future. They violated
every treaty they ever made with us. I use the word "liberated"
loosely and sarcastically, in the same vein that I view the use of the
words "collateral damage" when they kill innocent men, women and
children.
They describe people defending their homelands as terrorists, savages
and hostiles . . .
My words reach out to the non-Indian: Look now before it is too
late=97see what is being done to others in your name and see what
destruction you sanction when you say nothing.

I can't speak for Gabe, but your 'offensive' (ethically off-set by
elegance v awkward) provides an art-for-art's aestheticism to set beside
'abomination' (ethically off-set by sociology), albeit a rather
under-nourished companion.=20

On the matter of collage, Bernstein's position is being under-read here,
both as regards his argument in 'Pounding Fascism' about collage and the
Cantos, and about the meaning of form. Speaking for Bernstein, let me
quote from his 'Revenge of the Poet-critic' in MY WAY: =20

"You can't fully critique the dominant culture if you are confined to
the forms through which it reproduces itself, not because hegemonic
forms are compromised 'in themselves' but because their criticality has
been commanderred. There is no wholly intrinsic meaning to any form, nor
are there a priori superior forms. Devices and techniques--the tools and
the styles of the past--shift in meaning and value over time, requiring
continuing reassessment. Yet forms do have extrinsic, social meanings
that are forged through a contestation of values from which it is
impossible to withhold judgement" (p.4)

  Wystan

I can't speak for Murat, of course, but I'd say that collage is just
like all the other forms/genres: basically offensive unless well
handled. Art is lying. It is a presentation of the false in a false
context in order to try to produce a metaphoric or analogic truth. So,
unless the thing is done elegantly and well, all you get is an awkward
lie, which is, let's face it, pretty offensive.

Collage itself has the added burden of being a collection of other
people's lies, so the chances of getting the
presentation-of-lies-to-tell-truth right are a good deal worse. The
collagist is relying on viewers of the collage to be aware of the
original sources of the material, and the original context of that
material, together with the new context the collagist is presenting, so
there is a lot more room for stumbling and failure, and there is, in
fact, a lot more stumbling and failure.=20

All this is fine, Steve.  But one example of poetic tolerance, if I may call it that, that I've been meaning to add to this discussion, I will do so here.  I'm gay.  Generally, I'm deeply offended by anti-gay statements by people.  Thomas Hart Benton was well-known for making these statements.  Nevertheless, I have a print of one of his paintings in my kitchen.  I decided not to take it down even after I found out about Benton's verbal gay-bashing.  Of course, it's not really present in his work so this is different slightly.  Nevertheless, I like the work too much to take it down.  The same goes for Pound.  I love too much of his poetry to decry it even though I realize that some of it contains his anti-Semitic sentiments.  As for anti-Buddhist sentiments, I have encountered that in some pseudo-hip, wiseguy poetry of the present moment.  I tend to avoid poetry readings where I know or suspect I will hear attacks on the dharma based on what I have already heard.  Criticisms
 of the way Buddhism is practiced by some people are another matter.  I find those interesting sometimes.  In the latest Tricycle, a Buddhist magazine to which I subscribe, Phillip Glass, one of the editors of the magazine, takes American Buddhists to task for being upper middle class dilletantes and asks:"How many Buddhists do you know who would take a vow of poverty?"  I've been thinking a lot about this, too.  Of course he was comparing well-off American Buddhists to Gandhi, who wasn't a Buddhist.  Still, I take criticisms of Buddhism into account and consider them if they are intelligent.  Simple attacks, I deflect and forget about as soon as I can.  Regards, Tom Savage

"Poetry was another weapon to fight for freedom."
--Marcos Ana

Pedro Almodovar is now making a film about the life of poet Marcos Ana.
Should be amazing!  Below is a paragraph from Elizabeth Nash's article
recently published in Madrid.  To all those who fight censorship!
CAConrad
http://PhillySound.blogspot.com <http://phillysound.blogspot.com/>

Marcos Ana, now 88, was 19 when General Francisco Franco had him thrown in
jail in 1939. As a political inmate who had fought against Franco's
victorious troops during the Spanish Civil War, Ana was tortured, shunted
from prison to prison and managed to avoid two death sentences before he
emerged, bewildered to the point of nausea, a free man in 1961. He was 41
but retained the desires of innocent youth. The film, which will be a world
away from Almodovar's habitual high-octane cinema, is based on Ana's
autobiography Tell Me What A Tree Looks Like, published in September.
Almodovar secured the rights to the book last week.

Yahoo is not releasing the message below, so I'm re-sending from this
account.  Apologies if you receive this more than once ...



~~



No more need be said?  It's all settled now, and still, I wonder --







Form, which I understand evolves from a group of people trying to say things
another way and usually bears out political implications --  a way that
gives voice to their experience or an attempt to (simplistically said w
apologies) say something apart from or new to the status quo -- can later be
divorced from its content (i.e. the overt and/or implied political matters)?
So when I decide to rap my poems (sans content about the urban African
American experience), I will in no way evoke the associations and political
implications from which that form was born and used?   I will only be
conjuring the 'unpolitical' or "neutral" aesthetics associated with that
use?  The form may not "contain a political stance, per se", but it
certainly carries political weight and implications that people associate
with the form itself.  Remove its content, the form still has origins and
uses that it cannot be "cleansed" of simply by removing overt content.



As for Pound using collage, the implication is not only the "opening" Murat
refers to below, but also, that by employing it, Pound is betraying his own
desire for the Fascist ideal of one unified authoritarian voice.  And here
we are going in circles ....

As for Charles's claim that the collage structure is basically democratic



(therefore, as a creator Pound not a fascist): I can see how the collage



structure of *The Cantos* has something to do with the liberating, opening



impact of Pound as a poet, though I do not thing it is nearly the only



thing. But I do not think a poetic form does, can contain a political stance



per se. It can function very differently, with different social impacts, in



the hands of different poets.

Benton was at least equal-opportunity hateful. He was antisemitic and
racist as well, part of an attack on the East Coast art establishment
as he knew it. How much of this was a pose adopted when he switched
from abstraction (he was pretty good) to storytelling is anybody's
guess, but it didn't hurt his career.

 1.  If you attempt to post to the list from a Yahoo account and your signature contains html code (a website address), your email may be rejected directly by the server.  Make sure you receive an automated reply from the listserve a few minutes after you post; otherwise, assume that the listserve has rejected your reply.  It seems to read these signatures, sometimes, as an attachment, and attachments cannot be sent to the list.

2.  When I switched over to the updated Yahoo mail viewer, the updated spam filter began filtering many listserve emails into my Spam box.  Simply look in your Spam box, and if you locate any listserve posts, mark them as "Not Spam".  They will then be moved to your Inbox, and Yahoo will begin to send new Poetics posts to your Inbox.

Thanks for the links to the book fair closing in India, and for the link to=
 the MoMA exhibit.  I shared them with a friend of mine who responded, and =
I'm posting his comments with permission (he wishes to be identified as CPR=
) because they ask some interesting questions, make some interesting points=
, etc, and I'm curious to hear what others think.=20

In response to India's "high court's" decision to cancel the book fair on "=
environmental grounds," the reasons for which the book fair organizers are =
curiously silent, and in which a number of American writers were to partici=
pate:
I wonder if it's due to an anti-American backlash, and these folks don't th=
ink of themselves as "American" writers, being marginal figures here. Of co=
urse, this kind of anti-Americanism, if that is the case, is just as stupid=
 and parochial as American patriotism. It's not fair to these poets who wan=
t to share their work. Whether we like it or not, people elsewhere are liab=
le to brand us as "American" writers. This is partly what I meant about bei=
ng American having stained my soul. So this seems to be a problem for Ameri=
can writers at the moment, how to deal with their "Americanness" while tryi=
ng to transcend the merely national and attain the human...and then if they=
're insane enough try to push it from there. But these people who ban book =
fairs for political reasons, no matter what those reasons are [environmenta=
l sounds like bullshit, but we don't actually know], stifle that which I ho=
ld most important in Life: free artistic expression and the evolution of th=
e human through art. Maybe you could pose this question to the Poetics Disc=
ussion group. I'd be interested to hear what others think. I don't really h=
ave any ideas myself. Sorry state of affairs. Thank the Freud family...Mayb=
e this is why there's been silence about it. Everybody's trying to figure o=
ut what they think. Anyone thinking out loud?It also occurs to me that, by =
the sounds of their names [book fair participants, Indian-American, if memo=
ry serves right], they are not stereotypically "American," and that the adj=
ective "American" carries a lot of baggage with it that isn't fair to such =
a large, multi-ethnic, multi-racial, multi-cultural nation. How does someon=
e named "Sunil" as opposed to "Mike" deal with being lumped in with the "Te=
xas Cowboys?" And how about the actual honest to God Texas cowboy who has a=
 bunch of "Texas Cowboys" smearing his good name? Good lord, what are we to=
 do with this adjective "American?"  How do we release the cowboy?
=20
=20
And in response to the MoMA exhibit and its NY Times reviewer:
=20
...I'm reading the [expletive] idiotic review... But seriously, there seems=
 to be something going on. Not just at the Times, but throughout the Americ=
an MSM, which is that being [expletive equivalent to "stupid"] when it come=
s to the humanities seems to be a job requirement. These people don't know =
anything about the "humanities" because in America, unlike Europe and some =
parts of Asia, public education emphasizes math, science and sports from da=
y one. Church on Sundays. A God-fearing militaristic society.  Now the peop=
le who write for the Times are for the most part privately educated and com=
e from at least the upper middle or professional class, but where their for=
efathers knew they were duping the masses due to their understanding of the=
 humanities, these folks themselves have also been duped because they never=
 learned from their fathers the most important aspects of their fathers' kn=
owledge. Beckett gave up teaching because he said the things that need to b=
e taught can't be taught. Where their fathers had minds that had, as part o=
f their evolution, a solid dose of arts and literature, they deprived their=
 children of it, mistakenly believing that the irrational arts no longer ha=
d a place in the world. Kind of like the mafia. Once they started selling s=
mack on the street, it was only a matter of time before they started doing =
it themselves, and these new addictions among certain members evolved over =
time into their ultimate demise as a group. Though they continue thinking o=
f themselves as cosa nostra, it's a delusional joke that they think so, bec=
ause the code they claim to live by is a dead one. Like Campbell said, we n=
eed new myths to psychologically adapt to new actualities, or some such. Hu=
man "reality" has to match or seam Earthling "actuality." The American arts=
 and literature scene, I fear, has fallen victim to this mafia syndrome, Wa=
lt Whitmans and Al Capones having become addicted to making money and snort=
ing junk, living what they think are good and decent lives. I imagine this =
exhibit, if it were scheduled elsewhere, that is not in the homeland, would=
 run the risk of cancellation. The artists would once again fall victim to =
critics. I'm not judging the artists or the individual works in the exhibit=
, what else are artists to do? I would sell the film rights for Smoke to Fo=
x for $75,000 to clear my school loan and other debt and have something lef=
t over. We must live, and live well, that is with dignity. But I am judging=
 the fact that they--we--are being stained by the culture surrounding us. Y=
ou can't live in shit and not smell and look like shit. Some of the work it=
self sounds as if it might be interesting if I could experience it for myse=
lf. Who knows? I don't, not for certain anyway. What I do know is that arti=
sts left Germany and the Soviet Union in droves. But how do non-famous arti=
sts transcend or extricate themselves from American be-ing, when even the b=
est of us seem brainwashed or manipulated to some extent. I myself get furi=
ous daily by television, no matter what's on [almost]. I seem to need the f=
ury, the rage seems righteous...but is it a manifestation of the way I've a=
llowed myself to be psychologically manipulated? And if so, what am I as an=
 "artist," that is an autonomous homo sapiens sapiens, to do about it? I do=
n't want the easy answer, the romantic stuff about art we say when we feel =
good about it, but the nitty gritty stuff that keeps us going even when we =
feel shitty about it. I want to know if we have a responsibility to leave t=
he country, which isn't easy, one must do it with all one's might, to leave=
 it literally or figuratively or both. And then how do we do it with, if no=
t dignity, at least with style. Like Bukowski once reportedly said: "All th=
at matters is how well you walk through the fire."  How do we walk through =
this fire we perceive and feel?The question again seems to be what can Amer=
ican artists do about their Americanness? It seems we need to deconstruct o=
ur own patriotisms and nationalisms, tribalisms...so 10 billion human being=
s can experience for themselves what's being represented and exhibited at t=
he MoMA.

I am not quite clear what these two posts are saying. How is it known that
the cancellation of the fair in India had anything to do with America? This
hints of self-centeredness to me. Obviously, it is possible that the fair
was cancelled due to political considerations, showing that the courts in
India are not totally independent either; but the considerations may have
been domestic. India has its own domestic frictions. Or "environmental
reasons" may be a term like "disturbing the peace," which was the regulation
used to control crowds during demonstrations in The United States.

As for the review of the MOMA exhibit, I had mixed emotions about it. The
whole show possesses the bazaar spirit, demystification of art, which MOMA
has assumed as its new persona after its renovations. There was a discussion
about it -between the old MOMA and the post modern spirit of the new MOMA-
more or less two years ago on the Poetics List. I generally liked this new
look and on balance thought it was a positive thing, though occasionally it
had a deflating effect on me. I specifically referred to the Modrian section
which was all crammed into one single room. Seeing Mondrian paintings
hanging one after another on the wall was like watching a film at fast speed
(or those books where one flipped the pages to see a series of photos move).
It put Mondrian's development as an artist in sharp, narrative focus. On the
other hand, having Mondrian's life time work, his obsessions, expressed in
minimalist variations over the years -a work which looms so large in my
imagination at least- turned into a twenty-minute walk through a room was
depressing. (Here we are talking about the dimension of speed, its
doubled-edge ambiguity, which I think is essentiall in understanding our
present world.)

The reviewer of the present exhibition -which obviously seems to possess the
wonderful spirit of the bazaar which MOMA has developed- emphasizes the
porous, borderless relation between science/technology and art. This is
great. A symbiotic relationship between the two is vital and serves both
sides. I remember years ago, again at MOMA, an exhibit of new Italian
architecture, which had exactly the same qualities. The design of the show,
also cramped in a relatively tight space, where different designs of
buildings or projects were packed into each other, had the effect for the
visitor of walking through an intricate, Alice in Wonderland kind of
sculpture, moving from one point/site/design to another following his/her
inclinations. The exhibition itself had become for me an ephemeral and
resonant piece of sculpture. I loved this merging of genres, of conceptual
divisions and thought it was radical, new, and the best spirit of the
post-modern.

I have not yet seen the new exhibition and, on the surface, the reviewer
seems to celebrate a similar spirit of conceptual differences (here between
art and technology) merging together. But I think something else is going on
for which I have no patience at all. The reviewer seems also to be saying
that the difference between art and technology *does not* exist; in the new
world they are the same. Of course, this would be an ideal state in a
panopticon/capitalist society where every parcel of human life is sized up,
measured up, cut up for commercial use/exploitation (its new field of
conquest being totally "commercializing the internet"). This way the ghost
is exorcized from the machine, and everyone can become a good, democratic
(American?) citizen. This same argument is presently going on between Jim,
Jason, David and me in the Poetics List around the issue of collage and
sound poetry to which I am in the process of writing a response which I have
not finished due to my attempt to finish a section of The Structure of
Escape at the moment.

There has been a tussle going on between the publishers and booksellers
guild, the writers of the city, environmentalists and lawmakers over the
venue of the Kolkata bookfair. It had been held for all these years at the
Maidan - an open park-stretch, part of which is a parade ground. This is a
vast stretch of greenland considered in the recent years to be the "lung of
the city" - something like the NYC central park in its own scale. However,
this is an open area, least protected environmentally and little maintained
by the city administration. When 3 million people walk that space over 10
days within the bookfair premises, the green, as you can expect, vanishes. A
dust popularly called "bookdust" streams over large parts of the city during
the late afternoon hours causing much distress.

With summers getting hotter and hotter in the city and given the callous
city maintenance strategies, it takes months now to grow back the grass.
Environmentalists have argued against the venue for the past couple of
years. Last year the court ordered against holding the bookfair at the
Maidan.

Protests followed immediately from writers. A symbolic bookfair was held at
the Maidan last year. The protests were led by senior writers of the city
promptly supported by most literary magazines and organizations. Kaurab took
part too. Here are some snapshots from the last symbolic bookfair -
http://www.kaurab.com/kabita_camp/baimela2007-1.html

Kolkata is literary city like none. A city that houses a few thousand
writers, artists and intellectuals. Books are a first. Who cares for a clean
environment if books are banned ! That's a popular thought. Moreover,
everything about Kolkata is complex and passionate. The environmentalist
organization that took the issue to court are anti-literary people in the
first place. Writers argued why the bookfair was picked as a
conscience-cleaner when there are a thousand other sources of environmental
pollution in and around the city including a rapidly growing population of
automobiles, a sizeable portion of which rarely get e-checked. "Books don't
pollute" - the banners carried by the writers and small-presses said.

Finally, the venue was shifted to the ramparts of the biggest soccer stadium
of the city - Yababharati Krirangan or the Salt Lake Stadium. The same
incidents repeated this year. The leftist government supports the guild and
the writers but has little role to play. The tussle is between the court and
the publishers and booksellers guild.

Underneath all this lies a strong suspicion that Anand Bazar Publications,
the most powerful literary establishment in the city and the publishers of
one of the largest selling dailies in India, helped catapult a situation
like this. The bookfair is clearly a public event where thousands of little
magazines and small presses participate. These presses often make the
largest sales of the year during these ten days. Many depend on the fair for
a livelihood. ABP seeks greater control of literary business at the fair,
wants to privatize it and drive out the small fish and the errand boys.

Each year, the bookfair selects a country as its theme. This year it was the
USA. Some of the literary stalwarts, most of whom are popular writers (not
necessarily the more innovative or experimental ones) who have led these
protests and have taken charge of the American delegates, are products of
ABP and maintain a close nexus. Quite naturally, the literary crowd of the
city are examining their roles with great caution.

This year, I have heard many allegations from writers in the city that the
American delegates were shielded from them. Free interactions were
prevented. The messages conveyed by the American delegates have also failed
to create a literary interest of any serious proportion.
Furthermore, it might have been also been quite frustrating for the
delegation to return without a proper participation at the fair.

It's a sad tale in brief.

agree w/ all you say, mark, except that Pieces seemed to have influenced
some Lang poets & others, & Later & other later books are as strong as his
early writing--stronger than that it doesn't get.
charles altieri has such insightful writing on creeley--what he was doing,
existentially, in each period of his work, in an essay on creeley & merwin,
in Enlarging the Temple.

Request for Submissions: JAMES BROWN Anthology
==============================================


This is a shout out for help. Almost a year ago, when
brother James Brown made his transition, I posted the
following Call for Poems about the impact his
lifetime of music has had on anyone within the reach
of the call. To date the response has been powerful
but as of today-February 20, 2008, the number of
poems submitted for consideration number less than 50.

Poets we need at least another 150 poems, to put
together a strong anthology.

I know a lot of people hit this drum. I'm asking each
person who reads this call to stop and take a minute
to forward it to at least 3 people they know who are
either poets or who know poets.

If you belong to other listserves, consider helping us
out by posting this call on it if possible.

If ya'll don't have a James Brown poem-considering
writing one and send it to us. I realize all things
come in their own time, but on the practical
side-books like these have their time too-

James Brown. In his honor, get down-send us your James
Brown poems today. Peace, Mary Weems

E. Weems, and Michael Oatman. We grew up on James
Brown's hit me! When he danced every young Black
man wanted to move, groove and look like him. Mr.
Brown wasn't called the hardest workingman in show
business because he wasn't. Experiencing a James Brown
show was like getting your favourite soul food twice,
plus desert. His songs, like black power fists you
could be proud of and move to at the same time.
When Mr. Brown sang make it funky we sweated even in
the wintertime.

Losing him was like losing somebody in our family.
This is a shout out for poems about the impact James
Brown had on our lives. Poems that will help people
remember, honour, and celebrate his legacy. Don't be

Substitute, say, "language poetry" for "fascism" and the trajectory of
these invented lives would be much the same as they are for the busy
networks of real writers Bola=F1o knew from the inside out . . .

Who said literature has no real power to affect history? Not Bola=F1o =97
for him, literature is an unnervingly protean, amoral force with
uncanny powers of self-invention, self-justification and
self-mythification. The mythmakers, he suggests, certainly do matter.
If Hitler had won, for instance, the not entirely absurd stories in
this encyclopedia would be the prevailing stories of the culture. Is
Nazi poetry an oxymoron? Not a bit of it, posits Bola=F1o. On the
contrary, it's all too possible.

Subject:      quotations from the Oulipo Compendium
MIME-version: 1.0
Content-type: text/plain; charset=iso-8859-1
Content-transfer-encoding: 8BIT

Here are some interesting passages from the Oulipo Compendium edited by
Harry Matthews. The first bunch are from Matthews's introduction.

12. It so happened that shortly after the creation of Surrealism, France
witnessed the birth--this time in the domain of mathematics--of anohter
avent-garde group called Bourbaki [1920's]. There can be no doubt that, when
they founded the Oulipo, Queneau and Le Lionnais, amateur mathematicians
that they were, had this group in mind.

13. When the Oulipo was conceived [1960], Bourbaki provided a counter-model
to the Surrealist group.

14. We can also say that the Oulipo is an homage to Bourbaki and an
imitation of Bourbaki.

15. At the same time, it is no less obviously a parody of Bourbaki, even a
profanation of Bourbaki.
.
.
.
21. The aim of the Oulipo is to invent (or reinvent) restrictions of a
formal nature (constraintes) and propose them to enthusiasts interested in
composing literature.

22. An initial misunderstanding can thus be eliminated at once: as a group,
the Oulipo does not count the creation of literary works among its primary
aims. Whatever its other merits, a literary work that deserves to be called
Oulipian may have been written by a member of the Oulipo, but it may have
been written by a non-member.

23. It follows that truly Oulipian publications (those published in its
name) do not necessarily lay claim to the title of literary works. (Whence
certain critical misunderstandings, not always innocent).
.
.
.
26. ...the Oulipo's work is collaborative.

34. The limiting and at the same time crucial role of mathematics in
Oulipian
art represents an intentional choice on the part of its founders. Their
basic
reason was that, in Queneau's and Le Lionnais's view, after the exhaustion
of the generative powerr of traditional constraints, only mathematics could
offer a way out between a nostalgic obstinacy with worn-out modes of
expression and an intellectually pathetic belief in "total freedom"...
.
.
.
36....A definition: An Oulipian author is a rat who himself builds the maze
from which he sets out to escape.

37. It is clear from what has so far been said that Oulipian procedures are
as remote as possible from "automatic writing": and, more generally, from
the notion of any kind of literature whose strategic foundation is chance...
.
.
.
39....It should be remembered that the Oulipo turned to Bourbaki for its
method, the "axiomatic method"....Constraints are presented in explicit and
systematic form and can be notated in the language of mathematical logic.
Oulipian texts thus become the literary consequences of these axioms...

40...."A text written according to a constraint describes the constraint."
[Or perhaps "models" the constraint.] "A text written according to a
constraint dependent on a mathematical theory utilises the non-trivial
theorems of the theory."
.
.
.
47. The Oulipo has obviously not invented a form that can compare to the
sonnet. The conditions determining the appearance of a durable literary
form, whatever its nature, are far too complex to lie within reach of the
most determined individual or group, no matter how "gifted"...
.
.
.
50. ....Francois Le Lionnais was a strict, integral Oulipian who never made
concessions. This meant that he devoted himself entirely to Oulipian theory
and did not himself write Oulipian texts, a task that he left to his
disciples--us--and to his friend, Raymond Queneau. Forthormore, the Oulipo
was for him no more than the first instance of a far vaster undertaking, one
that I hve called the "quest for a generalised Ou-x-po": and in fact he
founded not only an Oulipopo, the Ouvroir de littéerature policiere
potentielle (or Worshop for Potential Detective Fiction, still
flourising),... but in addition an Oupeinpo for painting, an Oumathpo for
mathematics, ... and an Oucuipo for the art of cooking. And, following  the
same model, he foresaw a general extension of potentiality to the entirety
of human activities, in other words a family of Ou-x-pos, the range of the
xs being potentially infinite and subject to recursive treatment, so that
there would be an Ou-(ou-x-po)-po, then an Ou-(ou-(ou-x-po)-po)-po, annd so
forth....
.
.
.
52. In conclusion, what is the Oulipo's general aesthetic policy? Certainly
Pythagorean, as is shown by the invention of "Queneau's numbers", a most
up-to-date version of the golden mean. But I shall say no more on this
point. In the words of the operetta, "Some secrets you don't give away."


This is from the entry named 'Machines for Writing' in the Oulipo
Compendium:

"In the broadest sense of the word, every Oulipian technique can be thought
of as a writing machine."

This is from 'What is the Oupeinpo?' in the Oulipo Compendium:

2. de peinture, for painting, but the term is used synecdochically, since
the Oupeinpo does not limit "painting" to the art of applying pigment. On
the contrary, it has no scruples about extending it to all the graphic and
plastic arts and it advocates not only the painter's brush and palette knife
but the draughtsman's pencil, the engraver's burin, the stucco-maker's
float, the tagger's spray-can, even the mouse of the electronic image-maker.
Camera and printing press are no strangers to it. And it makes a point of
encouraging needle and scalpel, larding-pin and chopper, spray-gun and
compressor, printer driver and pile-driver, laser and rolling-mill, and
field artillery (bombs if necessary), not to mention bare hands and digital
agility. Indeed, one of the Oupeinpo's objectives is to increase the range
of what is available to the painter in the way of material as well as of
materials, surfaces, techniques, procedures, subjects, viewpoints, theories,
and so on.

3. potentielle, potential: because the Oupeinpo itself produces no actual
paintings. It applies itself not to works but to the methods, arrangements,
manipulations, structures, and formal restrictions with which painters past,
present and future were, are and will be able to create their works. If it
does not reject what is manifest in works of art, it asserts that this is
the business of artists, patrons, and the world of viewers. Its own role is
to suggest "forms" or transformations where works exist as possibilities. We
hasten to add that its members do their best to become the first to keep
these forms from remaining empty by embodying them in examples."

---

This is of particular interest to me at the moment as I write dbCinema, a
graphic synthesizer or movie painter.

It occurs to me that if, in a generative visual program, something is making
marks on the screen, then we might as well say that a pen or brush is
involved. In this sense, generative visual art is all about creating
interesting brushes and ways to combine them. From a software architecture
point of view, we may hypothesize that the fundamental classes or abstract
structures of generative visual art are

1. the brush/pen
2. the canvas/screen
3. the 'paint'

Which is to say that if one creates flexible such classes and relations
between them (and gives each of these good, general, properties and
methods), one is on the way to being able to do anything doable in
generative visual software art.

Subject:      "Listening to Istanbul" .::.  My near-future project announcement

Hi there,

  This is to announce my near-future project. On 11 March 2006, the German city of Essen (representing the Ruhr region), the Hungarian city of Pécs and the Turkish city of Istanbul were selected as European Capitals of Culture for 2010 by the EU council. "Listening to Istanbul" is my candidate project among many others that are being proposed for Istanbul 2010 European Capital of Culture Agency, and is an implementation of my idea of a "living poem" which is changing continuously by collaborative and interactive work. I'm looking for sponsors for the project. Nevertheless, I decided to continue developing it on my own, in case I can't find one.

  I have chosen Orhan Veli's "I'm listening to Istanbul" as the entry point for the project, for it is probably the most popular and most beautiful poem ever written on Istanbul. Written over half a century ago, in that poem, the poet imagines the city as a living human body, and by listening to it with his eyes closed, tries to touch and feel it's liveliness. But since the city has changed tremendously ever since Veli wrote his poem, a new listening effort would be valuable in order to portray today's Istanbul, and in order to follow the poet's way. Aiming at this points, the contributors of the project "Listening to Istanbul", that is the visitors and the registered users of project's web site, will try to suggest new words for the poem in order to express the feeling of living in today's Istanbul. All suggestions will be collected periodically to be reviewed by the project committee and then a new version (the nth iteration) of the text will be published as the actual
 version on project's web site, Veli's poem being the iteration numbered 0. Then in the same way this actual version will be processed again to get the new iteration. This process can be repeated as many times as desired.

  In addition to this "iteration of text" process, the contributors of the project will be allowed to comment any part of the version in hand with any kind of material (text, image, sound, hyperlink to a web site, etc) they provide to project's web site. Furthermore, the project will be supported with interactive forums, chat rooms and live activities. After a period of a
  year, huge material and numerous creative work could be collected via project's web site.

  The project's web site will be set up soon at http://www.workmanofchild.com

  Best regards,

  Ozcan Turkmen

This is a great story--

the leading collector and expert on Chinese painting of his times--
provides himself with works to "authenticate"
which he has created himself

and so produces works which he himself can adjudge and others applaud
as the "oldest known" "Masterpieces" of their kind--

i find forgery fascinating as a disruptor of codes and systems which
expose the "economic" "values" which are enmeshed with
artistic/literary "values"--
and the exposure of the "forgery" as it were of "authority" in "judging"
"masterpieces," the "canon," social historico-cultural "contested
values" and meanings.

The Chinese example here bringing to mind the role ofChina in the
discussion of Pound and Bernstein's work--

(fre forgery--for example--the forgery of the "Italian Letter"
combined with the disinformation of Curveball used to invade Iraq--
which Jenny Holzer's "Projections" and paintings  of 6 year old
documents preceding the war are enmeshed in a mirroring of the power
they "critique"--mirroring "Star Wars" which mirrors Leni
Riefenstahl's "Triumph of the Will"--and found reflected in aspects of
the tortures at Guantanamo and changes there to "win hearts and
minds"--for a tour of the images and quotations and interlocking
relationships among  these & Holzer's bean bag  chairs and paintings
of paintings see-

in a 21 february  post Wynston Curnow wrote:

Speaking for Bernstein, let me
quote from his 'Revenge of the Poet-critic' in MY WAY:

" There is no wholly intrinsic meaning to any form, nor
are there a priori superior forms. Devices and techniques--the tools and
the styles of the past--shift in meaning and value over time, requiring
continuing reassessment. Yet forms do have extrinsic, social meanings
that are forged through a contestation of values from which it is
impossible to withhold judgement" (p.4)

What struck me when i first read this is the use of the word "forged"--
not only does one think of Hephaestus at his forge, or the immortal
Village Smithy, but those who have "forged" art works, literary
documents, historical and archaeological evidence, identity cards,
passports, ad infinitum.

In this regard, it is possible to "forge" "extrinsic, social meanings"
in such a way that "it is impossible to withhold judgement" --a
judgement "forged" a priori by "forging" an "extrinsic, social
meaning" which generates the grounds, the "evidences" for this
"judgement."

The punning meanings of "forged" collapse "Authority," "judgement," "
contested values" "extrinsic, social meanings," as well as the split
in the origins of the word in "faber" as "worker" and "maker." ( Eliot
called Pound-, alluding to Dante--"il miglior faber"--)

The "Mint" at which Pound's father worked in Philadelphia--omen, "site
of origin,"  of his son's monetary "schemes" and economic
"speculations"--turns into a Forge for the making of counterfeit
coins.
(Pound's ideas of the American monetary system "forged" to create an
overthrow of the one in existence.)

In turn, Bernstein's "judgement impossible to withhold" is of "forms
{that} do have extrinsic, social meanings
that are forged through a contestation of values."

This judgement,  based on being "forged through a contestation of
values" creating "extrinsic, social meanings"is then subject to the
collapsing energies of the pun, "forged."

Why is it then "impossible to withhold judgement" unless that
"authority"  who demands "judgement impossible to withhold" has
"forged" ahead of time the "extrinsic, social meanings," by which the
"subject" is forced to a judgement "impossible to withold?"

The "subject" is placed in the position of being as it were coerced
into the position of not withholding judgement, and a judgment which
it is presumed to be, msut be, consistent with that of the
"authority."

As a Russian artist has put it:  "Language is a fascism not because it
silences and  censors, but because it forces one to speak."

(Is this not what torture is for after all?  Many accounts by persons
who have undergone torture report that it is not "the truth" one way
or another that the torturer cares about--but that the person being
tortured is "forced to speak."
The "greatest crime" in the eyes of the torturer is not withholding
information so much as withholding speech.
Hence the continual citing of the worthlessness of information
extracted under torture as far as information goes.  What the torturer
is demanding is speech "impossible to withhold," regardless of
"content." )

When one is told that "extrinsic, social meanings" forged through "a
contestation of values" make it impossible to withhold judgement--
this is setting up the "poet-critic" as a superior "judge" to the
actual Law, which did indeed find it impossible to withhold judgement
on Pound, and indicted him for treason, since time immemorial
considered one of the most heinous and despicable of transgressions.

In a sense, is not Bernstein's  position similar to Pound's own?  In
that, in both cases, the poet-critic is "forging" their own justice
and authority in order to align themselves with what each one sees as
those "extrinsic, social meanings forged of a contestation of values?"

And is it not unexpected that under such circumstances, each might
find the other to be the "forger" aspect of "faber"?
Or, in a sense the forger who sets out to overthrow the father?
The father of the Mint, and the "miglior faber" of the Cantos?

(In Deleuze's re-formulation of Masochism, the one being beaten is the father.)

from the online dictionary re "to forge"

v.tr.
1.
a. To form (metal, for example) by heating in a forge and beating or
hammering into shape.
b. To form (metal) by a mechanical or hydraulic press.
2. To give form or shape to, especially by means of careful effort:
forge a treaty; forge a close relationship.
3. To fashion or reproduce for fraudulent purposes; counterfeit: forge
a signature.
v.intr.
1. To work at a forge or smithy.
2. To make a forgery or counterfeit.

I think that this does need to be discussed more, the relationship
between language writing and politics.

I can't speak for the male language writers, or all of the time about
what happened on the east coast, but it seems to me that women
writers, like Lyn Hejinian and Rosmarie Waldrop, were radically
political in that, after the so-called failures of the revolution in
the seventies, they turned inwards, trying to radically reconstruct
consciousness, going even beyond the personal-is-political slogans to
break the lyric 'I' for political purposes, screen it out from
reading, and make people aware of patterns and structures--one of the
most important being the ideologically suspect nature of grammar and
syntax itself.

So it's really strange to hear people talk about the obsessively
technical, non-political nature of language poetry.

I hear this side of the story so rarely these days that sometimes I
think that I am just making it up. Have other people  have written on
the radical feminist nature of langauge poetry? Are there any feminist
langauge writers who claim that project explicitly?

I do think that such a project is there if you read either Lyn
Hejinian or Rosmarie Waldop's poems. I suppose I may have to sit down
and pick out a few distinctive examples to analyse eventually...

Very interesting Jim. If you'll permit me an extension:

I've recently become very interested in Heidegger's Zuhandenheit mode =20=

of being. That is, the being of things, the beingness of which is =20
their readyness-to-hand, or their existence as equipment. It strikes =20
me that in what you're defining what is being described is the =20
equipment of an artform. That an artform has equipment necessary to =20
creating it is fairly obvious. Creating is essentially an activity, =20
and it is always going to be an activity done with something, and =20
that something is its equipment. in visual art, that something is the =20=

list of tools necessary to manipulate the visual image, and I think =20
your classes of abstract structures seem pretty exhaustive, although =20
I'm not a visual artist. I will say, however, that it appears to be =20
an additive process, whereby your set of abstractions create a visual =20=

image by starting with a blank and adding things to it in order to =20
reach the final product. It occurs to me that this is not exhaustive =20
as a great deal of visual art is also subtractive. I'm thinking here =20
of a kind of sculpture, whereby the sculptor starts with a blank and =20
then removes things from it in order to reach the final product. That =20=

is to say, i think if you want to establish something that's truly =20
exhaustive, you have to incorporate the subtractive process. The =20
blank itself is something worth considering, and not just in visual =20
production, but also in sound, in text, and really anything I can =20
think of that has at its end something other than performance. I =20
don't know what the blank is in a performance, and for me it's =20
difficult to conceptualize. I'm not overly worried about that, =20
however, as I don't personally find performance to be particularly =20
interesting except as it leads to the creating of some other product, =20=

be it a recording, a film, a painting, or a sculpture, or whatever. =20
But do you think it's possible then to extend your abstracts in the =20
following way:

1. The Implement
2. The Blank
3. The Methods of Impact

Wherein in any circumstance of creating art, and not just auto-=20
generative production methods, what the work is is something that =20
began with a blank, wherein something or someone acted on that blank =20
with an implement in order to leave a record of it's activity through =20=

some method or methods of impact. Here we have the page impacted by =20
letters through a writing implement, a screen impacted by light =20
through a computer, a canvas impacted by ink with a pen, etc.

There are places where this doesn't seem to hold up for me, and that =20
would seem to indicate that this model has an inherent bias toward a =20
certain kind of visual work in it's metaphorical abstraction. I think =20=

that's fine though. But the question to ask then is, what other =20
metaphors might be possible here? It's something to chew on for me, =20
so thanks for the post.

Thanks,
Jason

Please join us next Monday at 7pm in the CVA Gallery:

For the inaugural reading in The Pierre Bourdieu Memorial Reading Series
(see end of press release for more information about this series).

Kristy Odelius & Aaron Belz.

KRISTY ODELIUS is an Assistant Professor of English at North Park
University. Her work in a variety of venues, including Chicago Review,
Notre Dame Review, ACM, GutCult, La Petite Zine, Diagram, etc. Her poems
are anthologized in The City Visible: Chicago Poetry for the New Century
(Cracked Slab Books). Her chapbook Bee Spit was published by dancing
girl press in December 2007

AARON BELZ, from St. Louis, is known nationally through his many
publications in journals like LIT, Fence, Court Green, Painted Bride
Quarterly, Black Clock, and Fine Madness, as well as through his series,
Observable Readings (http://observable.org) which has showcased more
than a hundred poets since 2003.

Of his first book, The Bird Hoverer (BlazeVOX, 2007), The Boston Review
writes, "These impressive, loopy poems are touched by a raw grace of
mind and nimble phrasing."

JACKET describes Belz as "a poet who has retained a sense of childlike
amazement. His eclectic reference points attest to a wide-eyed
fascination with the world. He commingles high and low culture, the
historical and the contemporary."

His second collection of poems, _Direction_, is forthcoming from Persea
Books. More information about Aaron Belz is available at http://belz.net.

***

The "Pierre Bourdieu Memorial Readings Series" is so-named to
commemorate the contributions of this important sociologist to a
critical understanding of a range of phenomena specific to the field of
cultural production against which, in which, and through which social
actors such as writers, readers, students and professors create,
consecrate, fetishize, and disparage. Bourdieu's theories and
methodologies provide unusually perspicuous tools with which to correct
subtle and pervasive injustices in the field and to envision the
possibility of a community of friendly makers less beholden to the
illusions of aestheticism, the fetish of the author, and the
preciosity of writing -- for a closer, sparer, clearer relation to use,
wonder, kindness, being, love, world.

The "Pierre Bourdieu Memorial Readings Series" is associated with and
spiritually sponsored by MANDORLA: NEW WRITING FROM THE AMERICAS, a
magazine we are particularly proud to have here at ISU.

Celebration ... is
self-restraint, is attentiveness, is
questioning, is meditating, is awaiting,
is the step over into the more
wakeful glimpse of the wonder -- the
wonder that a world is worlding
around us at all, that there are
beings rather than nothing, that
things are and we ourselves are
in their midst, that we ourselves
are and yet barely know who we are,
and barely know that we do not know this.

- Martin Heidegger

that's a pretty cool extension of the idea, Jason. i'd say that takes it
further. generalizes it usefully. there's the philosopher in you as
architect of ideas.

these sorts of structures are very useful to artist-programmers. and they're
useful, well, to anybody who is dealing with art in any number of ways.

these sorts of abstract classes are an attempt to provide a good starting
point to mull over in relation to where one is going. i came up with the
more specific version i offered not too long ago. way after i started
dbcinema. so dbcinema contains no screen/canvas/blank class. but it would
profit from it. and it contains no paint/ink/'methods of impact' class and,
again, it would profit from it. it would profit by these ideas opening up
possibilities, mainly, and relevantly organizing already-inherant
possibilities in the existing dbcinema architecture.

Object-oriented art-making? But the objects are instantiations of abstract
classes, not items in the gallery. Object-oriented art-making as
methodology. That's what object-oriented programming is, a methodology. Not
a programming language, for instance. A methodology that can be and usually
is used when one creates a programming language. Or when one creates a
program/'abstract machine'.

Perhaps we've created a new field? Or just found a handy way to synthesize a
philosophical approach and an architectural approach in the creation of art
or art machines? Or what?

Wow, it amazes me how the incredibly stupid people get to wiggle into the
Times these days.  What's the point of that paper if they continue to employ
such DISASTROUSLY stupid people?

THE GRAND PIANO is rife with details of politics which are 180 degrees
turned away fascism.

And to be honest, this is an attack so severe, and weird, that it makes me
wonder if people who claim to know poetry saying such things really know
anything at all about poetry?  It reminds me of a poet who has many degrees,
teaches creative writing at one of the more boring schools, AND, this poet
won the MacArthur award for being a GENIUS (cough-gag!), but said to me when
Alice Notley's book MYSTERIES OF SMALL HOUSES came out, "Oh no, I'm not
interested in her, I can't stand LANGUAGE poets!"

So I opened the book, which I had just the previous day read from cover to
cover, and opened to a particular page to show the GENIUS (gagging!
again!) Notley's line about how the LANGUAGE poets arrived on their
Gilligan's Island.

It's not just uninformed, but in their UNINFORMEDNESS these people misinform
one another with tattletale qualities they must have perfected in grade
school.  I have NO degrees of any kind and knew perfectly well that Alice
Notley is NOT a LANGUAGE poet for cripes sake!  GEESH!

Oy, the crap will not cease squeezing out of the tedious, the mediocre, the
poets awaiting their special podiums of fire in the after world.  If I have
to share it with them I'm not dying, that's all there is to it!  An eternity
of open readings with these dolts has GOT TO BE some kind of working off
time in purgatory!

Nobody mocks the inherent elitism and tyranny of literary movements
quite like Roberto Bola=F1o. His characters eerily exemplify this
narcissism, also rife among the rebellious avant garde, and eventually
most face absurdity. He has the chilling ability to portray the
complicity of both powerful and confused ordinary people, each of whom
believes art is more or less than it is. Bola=F1o's theme of fascists as
patron/artists deconstructs the value of the arts. How many of us are
comfortable in the delusion that artists who are racist, sexist, etc.
are harmless and should be tolerated for the sake of their precious
talent?

How many of us are comfortable in the delusion that non-artists who are rac=
ist, sexist, etc. are harmless and should be tolerated for the lack of thei=
r precious talent? Or that racist, sexist, fascist, authoritarians should n=
ot be tolerated at all.

the first sacrifice that must be made in order to live in an open society i=
s that one must commit to tolerating repugnant ideas. that repugnant ideas =
are often expressed beautifully is a warning to all thinking people that in=
 and of itself demands to be heard. the value of a talented pig is that it =
reminds us to separate the aesthetic from the political for fear of being l=
ured by beauty into a realm of horrors.

here's an example of how a screen/canvas/blank class would have been (may
still be, if doable) useful in dbcinema.

a friend asked if dbcinema could create print-size bitmaps, ie, real
biggies. currently, it creates bitmaps of whatever resolution the monitor is
set at. and that goes up to around 3000 pixels or so, depending on the
monitor and video card. whereas print-size bitmaps are much bigger if
they're painting-sized. not to say you can't work on the bitmaps dbcinema
produces to make them bigger, but it would be better to have an option
whereby you can set the size of what it produces. in other words, an option
to mess with the properties of the canvas/screen/blank. and this is more
easily done if the canvas/screen/blank has its own class, rather than a
situation where its properties are incidentally (and perhaps also somewhat
mysteriously) scattered throughout the code of the program. a
canvas/screen/blank class rescues the concept from the realm of spagetti
code and places it in a context where its properties and methods could be
developed more broadly and easily.

“The cost of adding a feature isn't just the time it takes to code it. The
cost also includes the addition of an obstacle to future expansion. ... The
trick is to pick the features that don't fight each other.”

Hello all!

I have just released my new collection "Molly B. Whips It Out" with
text/sound compositions. (It has unfortunately been very much
delayed, due to technical problems as well as because of my chronic
illness.)

Eight of the 19 tracks on this CD are available on the web for free
(together with eight additional tracks not on the CD at all). See
http://www.nisus.se/molly/

The CD contains text/sound compositions, influenced by the concrete
poetry and sound compositions of the 60's, such as the work made by
people like Bengt-Emil Johnsson, Ake Hodell or Henri Chopin, Charles
Dodge and Charles Amirkhanian.

I used the computer for filtering texts (Macintosh Hypercard!),
synthesizing speech from text and also in order to add some sampled
instruments for some of the pieces, for instance some effects with
percussion and bass clarinet.

Jim,

It is amazing all your analysis, endeavor has the purpose of making things
easier, therefore, more productive: "a
canvas/screen/blank class rescues the concept from the realm of spagetti
code and places it in a context where its properties and methods could be
developed more broadly and easily"; whereas what is of worth in art is
almost alwayscreated through these cracks, what you call "spaghetti codes,"
I assume, in a derisive way. (What is a spaghetti code anyway, is it a
specific technical term or a nickname what the software geek can not
explain? "There are more things in heaven and earthe, Horation, than are
dreamt of in your philosophy?" Do you think Hamlet is passe now, another
fool into the dustbin of history, as Ramsfeld used to say about the Iraq War
and his generals who wanted more soldiers, "old thinking." He did not
believe in the existence of resistance.)

"The trick is to pick the features that don't fight each other."
Yes it would be great to phantasize a world without conflict, in the
software programmers' (but altimately software companies') image. "The trick
is to pick the features that don't fight each other" represents exactly what
I mean by the lack of skepticism, an uncritical enthusiasm about the
computer technology among poets using it, how insiduously -not neutrally at
all- the software imposes its own structure on reality, forcing its user
-who more than anything is interested in the "efficiency" of the procedure-
to eliminate what does not fit it. What we have at the end is a reality
without spaghetti, what I suppose one can call a no-carb diet of it.

D. H. Lawrence said that most people live under an umbrella on the surface
of which inside are drawn stars and the sun. The job of the artist is to
tear away that umbrella and reveal the true sky. I think Lawrence's
statement must be thought over very carefully in our artistic enthusiasm
about the boundless virtues and promises of this new tecnology.

Ciao,

Murat

C-Society
Sunday, March 2 at 7pm
at betalevel (http://betalevel.com) directions below
http://betalevel.com/2008/03/02/c-society/

Please join us for C-Society an evening of collaborative readings, featuring
Noah Eli Gordon and Joshua Marie Wilkinson reading from their recent book,
Figures for a Darkroom Voice, published by Tarpaulin Sky Press. Harold
Abramowitz, Amanda Ackerman, Allison Carter and Mathew Timmons will also be
reading from collaborative projects.

"In Figures for a Darkroom Voice the rhetorical twisting of Noah Eli
Gordon's abstractions meld with the ominous narratives of Joshua Marie
Wilkinson's fragments, turning Wallace Steven's notion of a supreme fiction
toward a supreme friction, one where the work of these two poets is fused
into a voice as singular as it is sinister."

Noah Eli Gordon is the author of A Fiddle Pulled from the Throat of a
Sparrow (New Issues, 2007), Figures for a Darkroom Voice (in collaboration
with Joshua Marie Wilkinson, Tarpaulin Sky, 2007), Inbox (Blaze VOX, 2006),
The Area of Sound Called the Subtone (Ahsahta Press, 2004), and The
Frequencies (Tougher Disguises, 2003), as well as numerous chapbooks,
including That We Come to a Consensus (in collaboration with Sara Veglahn,
Ugly Duckling Presse, 2005). He teaches at the University of Colorado at
Denver.

Joshua Marie Wilkinson was born and raised in Seattle and has since lived in
Arizona, Slovakia, Ireland, and Colorado. He is the author of three books,
most recently Figures for a Darkroom Voice (with Noah Eli Gordon, Tarpaulin
Sky P) and two more books are forthcoming next year: The Book of Whispering
in the Projection Booth (Tupelo) and a book of conversations between younger
poets and their mentors (U of Iowa Press). He lives in Chicago and teaches
at Loyola University.

Harold Abramowitz is a writer and teacher from Los Angeles, author of a
chapbook, Three Column Table, from Insert Press. With Mathew Timmons, Harold
co-curates the Late Night Snack literary cabaret series at BetaLevel in L.A.,
and with Amanda Ackerman, he co-edits a short form literary press called
eohippus labs. Harold also has a book, Dear Dearly Departed, to be published
in the near future by Palm Press and a micro-book, Sunday, or a Summer's
Day, to be published in the near future by PS Books. He teaches at Charles
R. Drew University of Medicine and Science in Los Angeles.

Amanda Ackerman lives in Los Angeles where she writes and teaches. Along
with Harold Abramowitz, she is co-editor of the press eohippus labs. She is
also a member of BetaLevel. Her work has been published or is forthcoming in
flim forum; String of Small Machines; The Physical Poets; and the
Encyclopedia Project, Volume F-K.

Allison Carter is an LA based designer, teacher and writer. Her work has
appeared in Fence, 5_Trope, P-Queue and others. Her first book, A Fixed,
Formal Arrangement, is forthcoming in August 2008 from Les Figues Press. She
currently edits P S Books.

Mathew Timmons is guest editor of Trepan, co-edits Insert Press, co-hosts
LA-Lit, and co-curates Betalevel's Late Night Snack. His writings appear in
Manufactured Inspirato, Greetings, Disaster, Sleepingfish, P-Queue, Holy
Beep!, Outside Voices 2008 Sound Poetry Anthology, Flim Forum, The Physical
Poets Vol. 2 and PSBooks.

First off thanks for this discussion, politics vis-a-vis the literary.  Tho=
ugh I haven't read Bolano (it's now on the list), the Times reviewer seems =
to suggest that all visions and promotions of those visions constitute fasc=
ism.  Rather, fascism (its tenets parcelled out in detail by plenty of obse=
rvers elsewhere) constitutes a particular ideological stranglehold.  Langpo=
, or any literary movement, turns (or threatens to turn) fascist only at th=
e point where it becomes intolerant of alternative modes of being.  Perhaps=
 langpo is subject to this charge only for the veracity and (dare I say) ef=
fectiveness of its critique of the "self" as an organizing term, of the sel=
f as the site where meaning occurs, of the representational (of "outside" r=
eference) in face of the self-referential nature of the signifier.  What ma=
ny observers fail to mention is Language practioners' eventual renunciation=
 of certain prior criticisms.  Dan Chiasson, for example, notes Ron Sillima=
n and Susan Howe's ventures into autobiography.  I recently came across an =
expansive poem by Steve McCaffery in the newest edition of the Colorado Rev=
iew that most certainly engages this planet, that is something more than a =
fetishistic inquiry into the material quality of the word.  And of course t=

Maybe object oriented programming as a metaphor for theory. One of
the things that eventually turned into my ceiling of incompetence
with coding is object oriented design. In some ways it just seemed
really wrong to me although I've never really been able to work out
why that is. One of the things that i didn't like about it, at least
in python and java which are the only two programming languages I
ever tried to work with extensively that are object oriented, was the
way that all the introductions to object oriented programming always
started by saying that object orientation conceptually is similar to
the way the world is. that is that there are objects and their
extensions and properties and instantiations and methods in the real
world, and so object oriented programming is just a mirror of that. I
could never really wrap my head around that in code, and so was
always more successful playing around with structured languages like
Basic and C. but to think of objects in the world not as a metaphysical
  ordering of reality, but rather as a phenomenological one, where
the object is the thing that is, as the abstraction that allows for
an ontological investigation, that to me seems like it has legs
because it ties modes of being to uses and methods and properties and
classes in a way that I think makes a lot of intuitive sense for the
various ways of being-in-the-world that different classes of objects
have. It's very easy, i notice, now that I'm thinking in this way to
just slip into talking that way. The blank class then defines those
objects which will become a work through being worked on by the class
of implements, and maybe then the methods of an implement object
define the methods of impact? this is where my understanding of
programming terminology starts to get fuzzy so I think i'll just quit
while I'm ahead. One thing that maybe ties this back to oulipo though
is that having defined the basic classes of objects in this way, it
becomes possible to address them recursively in a way that makes not
just for generative works, but for a generative poetics. by defining
a set of methods for given implements and the behaviors of given
blanks, perhaps then it is possible to cause genetic or otherwise
evolving algorithms to generate not just works but rules for creating
works and even rules for judging the quality of works. I can envision
then not just a program that would create work, but would then also
be capable of evaluating and refining it's own output and even making
a decision about when a work is "finished" based on some set of
tolerances for quality that it generates for itself.

maybe i've just gone off the deep end from computer science to
computer science fiction, but then there's a reason i side with
Wittgenstein in his debates with Turing and I've often wondered if
it's because I have a fundamentally different understanding of what
mathematics is than is taken to be the case in computer science. but
then, i barely passed calculus and really struggled reading Tarski
and Church on higher order logic, so what the hell do I know?

ANyway, stimulating ideas as always Jim. Keep us posted on your
progress.

what carmack meant, murat, is that when you build something that you hope to
develop further (some writing projects are like that, rather than quick
one-offs), things that you add may make it harder to develop the thing in
some directions rather than others. this is true not only of software but
anything we build. including ourselves. as one builds, the possibilities for
what the thing or person can be become narrowed, although the thing or
person may be better off with the addition. individuation. as things grow,
they become individuated, individual, and cannot be many other things they
might have been earlier on in the process. we make our bed and then we must
lie in it.

when he says "the trick is to pick the features that don't fight with each
other", he means that when you add new parts to a piece, they should not
bring the whole thing to a grinding halt, but resonate with what is already
there. it isn't so much a matter of efficiency or productivity as
understanding the organic form and directions of growth that one has set in
motion.

as to 'spagetti code', it is a loose technical term that refers to code that
is hard to understand because the logic is needlessly convoluted and spread
out and intermingled with the rest of the thing. it's true that some such
programs can be quite marvelous. it's also true that they cannot grow past a
certain, usually somewhat premature, point.

you are quick to misinterpret and take offence at what i say, murat. you
seem to see me as lacking skepticism, and possessing uncritical enthusiasm
about computer technology and its use within poetry and art. the evidence
you marshall for these claims is full of misinterpretation and
misunderstanding, as in your last two posts to me.

this sort of art and approach to art seems to freak you out. sorry. don't
mean to tweak your freak, murat.

we're all deluded yer all anti-semites we're all fascist commie pinkos
enough of this self righteous lefty stuff quit halt desist

delusions?????  bad is bad
good art produced by bad people   is still good but they're not
so drop it   look at poor old emile nolde a nazi through and through but
his art was branded degenereate anyway
not because of his beliefs but because hitler that "great" failed visual

too expressionistic or sumthin
knock it off yer turn will come to fry

Scientific research is subject to political infiltration and coercion,
not to mention constant religious attacks. Likewise, in just the past
few years it was disclosed  that certain literary foundations and
publications were subjected to the same. One doesn't need to read
Roberto Bola=F1o's books to become aware of such, but I recommend them
to fully experience the paranoia. It's not simply about bad people
producing or purveying good art but the naivet=E9 of thinking it doesn't
matter. (Yes, Steve, we're all going to die, but we can still speak
about things that interest us.) Most artists are aware of the
degeneracy of the media, but not always immune to subtler powerful
influences. Think of normal social interactions and you'll realize how
effortless an agenda can be accomplished. Obviously in free societies
we suffer these dangerous fools, but we can also excoriate their evil.
Bola=F1o also suggests that rebel artists are just as liable to ruin the
lives of one another in their quixotic, nearly mystical, adventures
for the avant-garde and freedom of speech.

This may help no one, what I'm going to say.  It might be meaningless.  But
I know what it is, EXACTLY what it is to want poets to be MORE, or better,
or perfect, or something along those lines, you know?

This is part of the challenge, to charge headlong into such searches, needs,
wants, to allow disappointment, to allow anger, to allow a certain amount of
stupidity even.  The right amount of stupidity allows room for getting out
of the seriousness when it's necessary.

This is endlessly painful in other words.  Because we care.  Really,
actually care.

This is a rotten truck load of shit coming down the road for the fields.

This is going back to the conversation about Pound, and others, and, the
bigger question, I think, isn't whether we should DAMN these other people,
but learn and be different?

If we're going to stand on shoulders shouldn't we be higher?  What's the
point of emulating?  What's the goal in all we want, ALL we want from
poetry?  Our goals for poetry have a lot to do with these bigger political,
social issues having a chance to be seen clearer, and punctured to let the
hot air out.

But I still say the word fascism is a manipulative word in this case.  It's
a loaded word.  It conjures the worst possible forms of hatred, and in the
end to conflate that with LANGUAGE Poetry is plain fucking wrong.  Someone
is going to have to be pretty damned clear with examples before I entertain
such a word being used.  It's a word that always sits in the hot coals,
waiting to be used to make nothing but the most shocking example of someone,
or some group.

In the end the word fascism is too often used by lazy, boring idiots who are
pissed off but don't have any REAL way explaining their dilemma.  There are
too suddenly all these "experts" in the world of poetry who should really be
looking for work in the wonderful world of fast food, since all they want in
the end is a side of fries to satisfy their "argument" of vague sauces and
protein.

The Times has for too long been defending the kind of poetry which has done
as much damage to our reputation around the world as Bush/Cheney/Rove/Rice.
And in the end, if we had never invaded Iraq, the poets of Poland and France
will still think we're all Sharon Olds and Robert Bly.  In other words FUCK
THE NEW YORK TIMES!

Of course, the substitution of 'language poetry' for 'fascism', while =
made in passing is an outrageous slander. For me, no other contemporary =
'poetics'
is both more political, and more sophisticated in its recognition of the =
inseparability of poetry and politics and more securely of the left than =
that
associated with langpo ( who is not a ancient chinese master translated =
by E. Pound). In this respect its 'critique' of the 'self' and its =
revision of autobiography, is somewhat incidental;  such 'observers' who =
register it otherwise are precisely those who have the largest and most =
powerful territory to maintain.

First off thanks for this discussion, politics vis-a-vis the literary.  =
Though I haven't read Bolano (it's now on the list), the Times reviewer =
seems to suggest that all visions and promotions of those visions =
constitute fascism.  Rather, fascism (its tenets parcelled out in detail =
by plenty of observers elsewhere) constitutes a particular ideological =
stranglehold.  Langpo, or any literary movement, turns (or threatens to =
turn) fascist only at the point where it becomes intolerant of =
alternative modes of being.  Perhaps langpo is subject to this charge =
only for the veracity and (dare I say) effectiveness of its critique of =
the "self" as an organizing term, of the self as the site where meaning =
occurs, of the representational (of "outside" reference) in face of the =
self-referential nature of the signifier.  What many observers fail to =
mention is Language practioners' eventual renunciation of certain prior =
criticisms.  Dan Chiasson, for example, notes Ron Silliman and Susan =
Howe's ventures into autobiography.  I recently came across an expansive =
poem by Steve McCaffery in the newest edition of the Colorado Review =
that most certainly engages this planet, that is something more than a =
fetishistic inquiry into the material quality of the word.  And of =
course there's Lyn Hejinian's "My Life."=20

Thank you Mary Jo for a very succinct communication of many facets of
Bolano's writings.

"They're going to knock the house down They'll rip out the basement.
It's where one of Jimmy's men killed the Spanish UNESCO official.
It's where Jimmy killed that Cecilia Sanchez Poblete woman.  Sometimes
I'd be watching television with the children, and the lights would go
out for a while.  We never heard anyone yell, the electricity just cut
out and then came back. Do you want to go see the basement? . . . .and
she said, That's how literature is made in Chile. I nodded and left.
While I was driving back to Santiago, I thought about what she had
said.  That is how literature is made in Chile, but not just in Chile,
in Argentina and Mexico too, in Guatemala and Uruguay, in Spain and
France and Germany, in green England and carefree Italy. That is how
literature is made.  Or at least what we call literature, to keep
ourselves from falling into the rubbish dump."
Roberto Bolano, By Night in Chile

For the most part, responders don't seem to have actually read the
review in its entirety, let alone any works by Bolano.  I hope like
Jarid many readers go on to read Bolano's works, truly among the most
extraordinary written and published in the last decades of the 20th
century and first years of the 21st. (Bolano died in 2003, aged fifty,
of liver cancer and chain smoking combined.  The extreme  production
of his final years was undertaken to ensure that his widow and their
son would have an income after his death.)

Bolano's works  are especially interesting today, in this country
From Bolano one  learns the shocks and  methods from the inside of
how Fascism, so long invisible in its approach, by its posing, say, as
a fellow student in avant-garde poetry classes as does "Alberto
Tagle-Ruiz" ( aka Carlos Weider in Bolano's Distant Star-)-,how
Fascism,  someday, overnight--in the morning--calmly announces itself
as in charge.

(Weider and Distant Star grew out of the character Lieutenant Ramirez
Hoffman, whose story is the final entry in Nazi Literatures of the
Americas.)

And that suspicious seeming poet in the classes, who dates the most
beautiful and talented twins, stars of an avant-garde's early moments,
turns out to be none other than this Lieutenant in the Air Force, and
the ambitious creator of what is to be the New Chilean Poetry--a
combination of sky writing, strange essays and perhaps plagiarized
poetries,  and their crowning achievement, a privately shown
exhibition of photographs covering a room except for the floor, in
which are displayed the tortured and dismembered bodies of a great
number of the recently, "missing" local young people, students,
primarily young women,  including maybe both of the twins.

For a long time it has been advancing, the symptoms are there all the
time, hidden in plain sight, yet until the fatal moment is reached, no
one wants to think, hear or see that it is remotely possible.

One of the things that Bolano examines is something which has just
occurred here--the rush to a judgement and opinion born of a few
words, ("language poetry," "fascism") which one is trained not to
think of as sharing in any way possible an affinity, nor ever
occurring in the same sentence.  Without thinking of a further enquiry
into the review itself or the author reviewed's books, or their
backgrounds--all that "context" which people at times claim that they
owe their awareness of to various of the language poet
authors/authorities--without further enquiry, a judgment is passed,
and the matter considered "taken care of."

 Orwell in the sections on Language following the novel  1984, charts
the development of newspeak in which opposing ideas can be reduced
into one by finalizing their conjunction in a single word. This causes
the arresting of thought at a threshold beyond which it is not
allowed, let alone possible,  to go, without entering the sure-death
zones of "thoughtcrime."

By even seeing the words "language poetry" and "fascism" in such close
proximity, two words believed as a gospel truth to be absolutely,
completely antithetical , thought becomes arrested and is turned into
outrage at what is perceived to be a "thoughtcrime."

In a real sense, this illustrates to what degree the absolute control
of a subject's thoughts has  taken place, without the subject being
aware of it.  The "thoughtcrime" that so outrages the subject is
thought to be "unnatural," on the order of a taboo, rather than
perhaps something along the lines of a rational enquiry.

It doesn't matter what the reviewer has actually written, al that
matters is that they have committed a "thoughtcrime", simply by having
the two words close together within a sentence.

It is this kind of reality that many of Bolano's characters are forced
to face: torture in the basement, the literary salon right overhead.
This has now become the reality in the USA--torture discussed in the
Senate on tv while drinks are poured and people discuss the latest
literary bons mots and events, fads, For al the discussants know, the
person in the next apartment could be "disappearing" into the
rendition flight oblivions of "black sites" and "secret prisons."
Meanwhile the phone, the computer, the banking records and store
purchases, the gasoline consumption and drinking habits, the preferred
reading tastes and favorite musics of the gathered company are
completely transparent to the authorities.

Fascism becomes so much a part of the landscape that it blends right
into the feng shui arrangements of the room's decor and seeps steadily
into the thoughts and responses of the literary get together.

The American scene becomes a "remake" of  one in Bolano's By Night in Chile,
the literary salon noted by the reviewer that takes place above a
labyrinthine series of corridors in the basement which lead to various
torture cells.  The owner of this establishment is Jimmy, (cited above
in the quote), an American who is often "away on business" and who
supports his wife's literary ambitions and her well attended soirees.

As it is later revealed, Jimmy, who  leaves Chile and his family
behind with the end of the Fascist regime--is an agent of the American
CIA or some other "Special" or "Dark" Ops group in charge of the
training, overseeing and funding of the Chilean "experiment"  so
brilliantly and ferociously described in Melanie Klein's Shock
Doctrine.  The USA today is a "remake" of   Friedman's Pinochet
implemented Shock economics combined with the use of extreme force and
torture, in the name of security and national defense. The one change
so far being that only a few American citizens as yet have been
subjected to the extra-legal treatment reserved for our "enemy
combatants"

The coup in Chile took place on a 9/11--in 1973.  For Melanie Klein,
9/11 2001 allowed a similar Shock Doctrine to be installed in the USA,
without the need of physical force, but accompanied by the steady
removal of democratic rights, the implementation of mass surveillance
and security systems and the invasion of and dispensing with Civil and
Human rights in the  name of Homeland Security.

 Invasion of privacy is accompanied by the privatization of as much of
the public sector as possible, directing billions of public monies in
to the coffers of the few--the privatized corporations, contractors,
management specialists, reconstruction specialist, arms dealers who
make up the bulk of the nation's budget.
The declaration of the "unending War" on "Terrorism" in which the
President can now personally decide who is and who is not "an enemy
combatant" means the country becomes in effect a corporate-military
machine with a minimal government which is  increasingly concentrated
in the role of the Chief Executive.

That Americans today face the situations which Bolano writes of --in
large part caused by American power and interests-- gives his work an
added power, as that which one is taught "can't happen here,"  is
happening here.  The effect is not unlike that of what the
military-intelligence calls "blowback."

    What the reviewer is saying, I think, is that if the writers in
Nazi Literatures of the Americas were "language poets" and not
"fascists," their careers would be on the "winning" side rather than
the "losing."  That is, they would be, like the language poets, the
writers acceptable to the State and the society and their
self-mythologizing would be and is part of a Nationalist Narrative.
Their recognition throughout the "official" culture of academies,
memberships in the National Academies such as Arts and Letters, their
positions as Authorities" and  "Authors" of "radical, innovative"
works, of blogs and "canon formations"--al of these things are
acceptable because they are a part of the overarching discourse of the
National Agenda. In this agenda, America is Number One--in the
military-corporate avant-garde and in the literary and artistic
avant-garde.  What counts is the supremacy, unquestioned, of Power, of
being Number One.

That is why something as simple as seeing "fascism" and "language
poetry" in the same sentence can cause such an immediate and heated
outrage. The mere thought that there should ever be any such thing as
a question or statement involving or not even involving but merely
mentioning together  these words, is something not only not allowed,
but "impossible."

       Bolano's work makes clear just how many impossible things are
not only possible, but can be suddenly revealed as the reality one
lives in, which has been there al the time, hidden in plain sight, and
simply waiting for the moment to emerge from its camouflaged
"normalcy" to  reveal --who knows--the being of the Supreme Author,
the Dictator of the New State of Emergency and suspension of all laws
other the Martial.

we might say that the sorts of classes we are looking at posit a poetics (as
i think you also are suggesting below). a poetics of whatever sort of thing
is under construction via the classes.

i had problems with oop also. it wasn't until i tackled some relatively
large programming projects that its virtues started to become evident. i'd
write myself into a mess that i couldn't take any further. couldn't take it
any further because the spagetti forbade it; the spagetti rose to entwine me
and making any sort of significant addition became a herculean effort worth
a brain hemmorage while trying to remember convoluted spagetti structures.

oop was developed to address precisely this sort of problem. oop is a
programming methodology that offers the possibility of creating programming
projects without getting hopelessly bogged.

so the value of the sort of classes we're discussing is not only
poetical-philosophical-theoretical, but it also offers some hope of creating
software art that can be developed further than it could be otherwise. that
makes intuitive sense also: beginning with rich, interesting, flexible
poetics might make for greater scope in a project.

oop can thereby be of use in realizing the software one would like to make,
as opposed to having to lower one's aspirations in response to getting
bogged early.

the classes you suggest are quite high-level. the higher the level, the more
abstract. i don't have a sense of whether it would be useful to write code
at that level, don't know if one could describe the properties and methods
at that level. perhaps. but it *is* useful to realize that whether one is
going to write something in generative visual art or in various other art
forms, a good starting point would be the classes you suggest. that's very
useful. the classes one makes into the foundation for an app end up having a
large effect on the evolving shape of the thing through development.

that's also very interesting.

since i started creating programmed works, my pieces have gone from
relatively short and simple pieces such as Seattle Drift, which is 'one
page' of code and took a month or two to make--and it was obvious to me when
these early pieces were finished--to pieces such as dbCinema which are
thousands of lines long and take more than a year to make. these latter
sorts of pieces have been 'finished' when it'd kill me to take them farther,
'finished' when the architecture groans, threatens to collapse, and
threatens to give me a cerebral hemmorage in trying to extend the
architecture.

hence the need for really clear initial work of the sort you suggest,
because a good foundation supports ambitious projects further along.

it's not quite the same sort of thing as getting bogged in writing a long
poem or novel or whatever. in these cases, the spagetti doesn't really
entwine one. one simply runs out of narrative or other sorts of steam. as
opposed to what one has written actively offering resistance.

reading math is very difficult, or so i find it. working with others in such
an undertaking is useful. the ideas themselves are almost always quite
simple. simpler than ideas in art. but understanding the language they're
written in is the difficult thing.

wittgenstein was in debate with turing? what about?

ja

Early mocap results with Foofwa d'Imobilite and Kira Sedlock. Why should

and why this constant production of the doubly-inundated body? Each ham-

images are heaps on images and somewhere I'm sure something's elusive, or

This may help no one, what I'm going to say.  It might be meaningless.  =
But
I know what it is, EXACTLY what it is to want poets to be MORE, or =
better,
or perfect, or something along those lines, you know?

This is part of the challenge, to charge headlong into such searches, =
needs,
wants, to allow disappointment, to allow anger, to allow a certain =
amount of
stupidity even.  The right amount of stupidity allows room for getting =
out
of the seriousness when it's necessary.

This is endlessly painful in other words.  Because we care.  Really,
actually care.

This is a rotten truck load of shit coming down the road for the fields.

This is going back to the conversation about Pound, and others, and, the
bigger question, I think, isn't whether we should DAMN these other =
people,
but learn and be different?

If we're going to stand on shoulders shouldn't we be higher?  What's the
point of emulating?  What's the goal in all we want, ALL we want from
poetry?  Our goals for poetry have a lot to do with these bigger =
political,
social issues having a chance to be seen clearer, and punctured to let =
the
hot air out.

But I still say the word fascism is a manipulative word in this case.  =
It's
a loaded word.  It conjures the worst possible forms of hatred, and in =
the
end to conflate that with LANGUAGE Poetry is plain fucking wrong.  =
Someone
is going to have to be pretty damned clear with examples before I =
entertain
such a word being used.  It's a word that always sits in the hot coals,
waiting to be used to make nothing but the most shocking example of =
someone,
or some group.

In the end the word fascism is too often used by lazy, boring idiots who =
are
pissed off but don't have any REAL way explaining their dilemma.  There =
are
too suddenly all these "experts" in the world of poetry who should =
really be
looking for work in the wonderful world of fast food, since all they =
want in
the end is a side of fries to satisfy their "argument" of vague sauces =
and
protein.

The Times has for too long been defending the kind of poetry which has =
done
as much damage to our reputation around the world as =
Bush/Cheney/Rove/Rice.
And in the end, if we had never invaded Iraq, the poets of Poland and =
France
will still think we're all Sharon Olds and Robert Bly.  In other words =
FUCK

rrested."  You are in essence engaging the dichotomy that if we feel, we th=
erefore cannot think.  The heart of your proposition is a silly default (an=
d one that would keep the genders in the dark ages of men=3Drational, women=
=3Demotional) -- most thinking folks acknowledge that our intellects are gu=
ided by our emotions -- but the equation of fascism with Lang Po has not re=
ndered me speechless or impotent though (my thoughts are not "arrested" nor=
 "outraged") -- but ultimately, I'm simply left wondering what you are  att=
empting to prove?   And finally, I (and I don't think I'm alone here) am re=
ally left to ask why you
 continue to produce "sensational-speak" around Lang Po without actually sa=
ying what your problems are with that particular school of thought.  =0A=0A=

Wystan, your stance actually explains the only possible justification for c=
iting language poetry in this context--precisely because it can be argued t=
hat it represents the most sophisticatedly resistant political stance in co=
ntemporary literature, it serves as a "for instance" of how in some context=
 any position whatsoever can be coopted; that is, it says, "even something =
as ant-Fascist as this can be turned into a kind of Fascism." I'm not entir=
ely sure I think the reviewer is smart enough to citing it in this way, rat=
her than as a simpleminded example of whatever she doesn't like; the review=
 is not clearly enough written for that. =0A=0AAnd I have to say I am sorry=
 to see you, David, whom I respect immensely, taking the equation between l=
anguage poetry and fascism as a given, which is simply ridiculous. I have t=
o say about the language poets what someone here said about Pound--that mos=
t of what most of us do could not have come to be done without them (and I =
suspect the same is true of you too, David). Attacking them is attacking th=
e foundations of our own (your own) efforts.=0A=0A----- Original Message --=

terature in the Americas - Roberto B o la=F1 o - - NYTBR--Nazi Poetry/ lang=
po & fascism=0A=0AFirst off thanks for this discussion, politics vis-a-vis =
the literary.  Though I haven't read Bolano (it's now on the list), the Tim=
es reviewer seems to suggest that all visions and promotions of those visio=
ns constitute fascism.  Rather, fascism (its tenets parcelled out in detail=
 by plenty of observers elsewhere) constitutes a particular ideological str=
anglehold.  Langpo, or any literary movement, turns (or threatens to turn) =
fascist only at the point where it becomes intolerant of alternative modes =
of being.  Perhaps langpo is subject to this charge only for the veracity a=
nd (dare I say) effectiveness of its critique of the "self" as an organizin=
g term, of the self as the site where meaning occurs, of the representation=
al (of "outside" reference) in face of the self-referential nature of the s=
ignifier.  What many observers fail to mention is Language practioners' eve=
ntual renunciation of certain prior criticisms.  Dan Chiasson, for example,=
 notes Ron
 Silliman and Susan Howe's ventures into autobiography.  I recently came ac=
ross an expansive poem by Steve McCaffery in the newest edition of the Colo=
rado Review that most certainly engages this planet, that is something more=
 than a fetishistic inquiry into the material quality of the word.  And of =
course there's Lyn Hejinian's "My Life." =0A=0AJared Schickling=0A=0A=0A=0A=

i wanted to share my considerations & thoughts on this recent issue:

It is surprising how the shock of seeing "language poetry" next to "fascism=
"
in the same sentence has created such response in the poetics list
community=97most of whom know in a very meaningful way that language poetry
was & is written out of a profound ethical need to counter the
self-justifying myths and modes of writing that allow for vast oversights i=
n
the actual economic and political circumstances of our culture, and a need
to disclose what is "hidden in plain sight" by means of the rhetorical form=
s
of our discourse.  In my view, it aimed to transform the grammar, and to
force the contradictions and hidden correspondences of these placating and
euphemistic official/newspaper/TV-talking-head forms=97to look at the very
language used by us, but also by the commercial, technical and bureaucratic
world, as material, and also as the very means by which particular
face-saving and "natural" attitudes are maintained and patrolled.  If
anything, this commitment to experience as it is lived HAS to be transforme=
d
if only to keep alive the sense of another mode of thinking, a way out.  Th=
e
cognitive and theoretical dimensions of that effort are, I think, the reaso=
n
that it gets criticized on two fronts=97the first being the complexity of t=
he
effort, which may make it seem to be a very elite affair, and thus open to
attacks for its abandonment of the general, less invested reading public,
removing it from causal reading or the "absorption" that entertainment
provides as a diversion from the very real constraints, oppressions and
injustices each of us face in our daily lives and real transactions.  Of
course, in its stated or implicit left/ethical position it is again open to
attack from the status quo of what Kenneth Rexroth characterized in 1961 as
official American literature, the "pillowcase headdress" aesthetics of the
Creative writing programs then being established=97does anyone remember tho=
se
"poetic objects" free of all links to a context (of a writer, a place, and
an intention) and emerging as a beautiful ideal creations in the
transcendent space of eternal pure forms?  Oh, we don't have to remember
them, because they are still the going thing.  I know I have endeavored to
write in these forms: they were part of my literary education.  Even so,
doubly condemned, the language poets have succeeded in making inroads into
the academy and the developed intellectual culture, but I would propose the=
y
have done so in order to represent a very real, "plain sight" alternative t=
o
the ameliorative and collaborative cultural systems that would perpetuate
the imbalances and antidemocratic forces holding sway at present, the forms
and models that are winning our hearts and minds in order to continue
exploiting American labor and immigrant populations, and perpetuate violent
aggression.  Now, I do not actively dislike any of the more celebrated &
laurelled "court" poets I have met, because they are often enough very
generous people, but it's a kind of bedside manner that they wear=97as the
patient is dying, they are there with the warm towel and the hot cup of tea=
.
If anything, the language poets allow us to cognitively and aesthetically
become aware of the depth of the crisis and the pleasure of perceiving its
resolution=97and have labored to break & suture the language in very effect=
ive
ways.  If the American academic and public institutions were adamant in
refusing to recognize the contributions of this literary group, it truly
would be fascist=97so at least the recognition of these artists and writers
leads me to have a slender thread of hope that, though the "national" mind
has been sorely blunted and dulled, it can still recognize what it has
abandoned, and what may be useful in liberating itself from unearned
privileges, ignorant prejudices, and the slavish ventriloquisms of
conventional "wisdom".  What is more startling to us than to hear people,
workers, professionals, homeowners, reproducing the very sentiments that
directly counter their own interests and livelihoods, as they exercise thei=
r
frustration by externalizing threats, fearing their own somatic drives, and
turning in their neighbors as deviants and freeloaders?  But I do think, qu=
a
literature, that the artistic "protest" and activity of innovative poetry
cannot do enough to address these problems, the lack of perspective that
continuously reasserts itself.  I think that every person needs to have
their own "kit" and skills for dismantling the subtle influence and
seduction of convenience and consumerism as it is manifested in public
discourse and commercial/professional appeal.  It was what I saw as my
central activity as a teacher of writing and literature=97get as many modes
and possibilities for re-thinking, questioning, and re-creating the terms o=
f
art as could possibly delivered from within the educational framework.  I
did not, and still do not, abandon that avocation as a teacher, but I did
find myself isolated further and further from the professional sphere as I
went along teaching the conflicts and the "radical" writers, so that, at th=
e
moment, I am not teaching at all.  I think this is a reflection, not of my
effort, but of the degree of suspicion held against experimental form and
teaching as an art of identifying injustice and helping a younger generatio=
n
learn new, creative, and potentializing activities.  [sorry about the rant
here, but four years of fruitless MLA job searching DOES take its toll].  T=
o
sum up, the reviewer at the New York Times wanted to force the issue=97what
would we think if our most trusted examples of the current "free verse" wer=
e
revealed to be monstrous, brutal, and invested in the cruelest form of
sociopathy?  Just such an effect was made here in this forum, but it also
got us to think usefully about what we assume to be just, ethical, and
progressive=97and to ask ourselves if what we assumed would make the world =
a
better place wouldn't indeed turn out to cause enormous misery.  The other
dimension of this linkage is that it does NOT include the name of our most
successful schools of poetry and writing, and cannot=97but we are definitel=
y
asked to see if the idea of the "new" could in fact be "The same old" and
even "worse".  There ARE wolves in sheep's clothing, and the commercial
culture has been co-opting the idea of innovation, the new, and hip
disobedience ever since the so-called rise of postmodern art & the free
love/colonial war 1960s.  (Though I agree that a lot of self-identified
postmodernists were interested with, among other things, drowning the beast
by glutting it with its own product, see my Flaff comments below).  For me
the most valuable lesson to be learned from this example is that we have to
ask ourselves how we continue on when we can't feel or see the tangible
effects of our own efforts to shake the system loose of its worst
consequences, and to instill some sense of compassion, open-mindedness, and
critical intelligence.  It is useful to me, because I get the chance to
articulate what this means in all its complexity.  That, because of my
studies, I would be considered a "post-language" poet (which I am not
considered, nor consider myself to be) would mean that I was trying to
perpetuate the questioning of language structures, though holding &
articulating some sympathy for the basic modal pleasures that poetic forms
can provide.  I think one development of this "turn", the Flaff poets,
suffers from the lack of context, because their works are not easily
recognized as satire, and suffer from a technique of simple "mixing"
(googlemix?) to create an effect that is hardly new, and that may be, and
often is, perceived more as contemptuous of any evanescent "public" than
productively engaging that public in questioning its assumptions.  So there
is a certain guilty pleasure involved in exercising blunt and crass impulse=
s
in this effort, even as much as I applaud the signal-jamming that it does.
I think younger poets, when they are not discouraged by the many and
attendant difficulties of working into their own productive means of
creative, critical activity (as there are thousands of discouragements), ar=
e
anxious to meet or test general readerships once again, not in order to fee=
l
authoritative & provide pedantic admonitions, but to make some beneficial
inroads into a public discourse that has been hijacked and sequestered from
any meaningful continuities and responsive exchanges between "power" and
"people".  It IS possible to see language poetry, in some of its most
careless (albeit rare) manifestations, as having turned its back on public
discourse as not worth the effort & impossible to take seriously.  But in
doing so, I think it speaks to a more serious disinvestment in ideas of
social bodies as really what we do "have" and need to keep active.  I agree
with some of my peers and friends that it may be best to let old-fashioned
notions of identity die in order to let us get on with living, but even as
we emerge into these newer forms of consciousness, perception, and
correlation to others I think we are faced with the crisis of the choice
between "banned books" and "translation".  We miss too much when we flatly
ban consideration of the past or make straw figures out of this or that
representative example, rather than take up the work of translating what
we've gone through, what was once held as a model of dynamic potential,  in=
to
our new, and sometimes bewildering circumstances and conditions.   We need
equipment!

David, while I like many of the things you have to offer in responding to
Mary Jo, your assumption that "For the most part, responders don't seem to
have actually read the review in its entirety" is curious to me.  Maybe you
can elaborate on how you came to this conclusion.  But meanwhile...

The fact is that Stacey D'Erasmo makes her pitch that LANGUAGE poetry is
akin to these invented lives in Bolano's NAZI LITERATURE IN AMERICA.

One of the bigger aspects of these invented lives in Bolano's writing
(according to D'Erasmo) surrounds his characters writing work NOT being
noticed, NOT being published, NOT being reviewed.  The VERY FACT that
D'Erasmo mentions LANGUAGE poetry like she does, with NO introduction, SHOWS
that she knows we know.  That alone shows how pointless her "argument" is.

And let's just be perfectly honest here that it's OUTRAGEOUS she would use
LANGUAGE poetry as an example, considering the number of Jewish LANGUAGE
poets there are.  This work by Bolano she sites is talking about anti
semites.  Is D'Erasmo THAT unfamiliar with what she thinks she knows so
well?

There are SO MANY people like D'Erasmo these days who THINK they KNOW who
and what LANGUAGE poetry is, but really they don't.  It's this term that
gets thrown around by disgruntled, tedious professors and poets who don't
really want to investigate.  As long as professor So-And-So, or poet
So-And-So says that LANGUAGE poetry is X-Y-Z, well then, IT MUST BE TRUE!

The paper chase without lifting a hand toward the actual source is much of
the problem.  D'Erasmo's review is pathetic for the reason that she not only
contradicts herself, but shows that she probably doesn't even know what the
fuck she's talking about in the first place.

I hope D'Erasmo's stupidity doesn't reflect negatively on the good name and
work of Bolano.

I think that there is an interesting discussion to be had around this:
it's the same discussion as happened once between Hegel, the Young
Hegelians and Feuerbach, the Marx

and the same one as we had in the 1980's around questions about
political correctness: when does the important work being done on
langauge by poetry become a substitute for material change. How do
these new subjectivities that langauge poetry supposedly created
appear in the world? How do we make places for them?

I think that it has to be a two way street. Think of Cuba's literacy
movement. Or Lyn Hejinian who is just a very good persion. Or of Amiri
Baraka--how he struggled with his experimenalist roots--and the
post-langauge movement that both works with poupular culture and
cliche, but through some very odd subjects and sentence structures.

What Orwell was really writing about was not communism but the--is
ironic the right word--distance that grew between langauge and life.
The strange part of that is how inventive those communist, and
(recently) American code words can be.

<<Orange alert!>> that is really funny, and what good words. Very
sensual this fear that they are trying to make. But if people just
turn off then there gets to be these two realms... one of phrases, and
another of life.

D'Erasmo may be ignorant of langpo, but the simplest received
understanding of it is adequate to explain her reference, I think--
(and how wonderful that someone on _this list_ recently needs to ask,
sincerely, what the term means!)--

I don't think the implicit argument works along the lines
"langpo=nazism"--

rather, I think, it's along the lines of "fascism=communism (langpo)
=extremism=
poor, deluded, political writers who fail to share in the comfortable
bourgeois certainties of the NY Times"

Guest Speaker: Dr. Francisco Marinho, Federal University of Minas
Gerais, Belo Horizonte, Brazil
Title of Talk: Multimodal Digital Poetry and Transdisciplinarity
Date: Tuesday, March 4, 5 - 6 PM
Location: CFA 235

Professor Francisco Marinho is a resident researcher of IEAT
(Transdisciplinary Advanced Studies Institute) of UFMG, Federal
University of Minas Gerais (Belo Horizonte, Brazil) and Co-director of
Midia@rte <mailto:Midia@rte>, (Media and Art Laboratory, School of Fine
Arts). He is in residence at UB as a Visiting Scholar in the Department
of Media Study where he is working with Professor Vibeke Sorensen on the
collaborative research project "Open Books."

On Tuesday March 4 at 5 PM in CFA 235, he will be giving a talk about
his prize-winning interactive installation Palavrador (multimodal
digital poetry) which was exhibited at ACM SIGGRAPH 2007 in San Diego.
It is currently installed in CFA 252.  In addition, Professor Marinho
will speak about transdisciplinary media research interests at UFMG and
a possible agreement between the Department of Media Study at UB and UFMG.

Additional information about Palavrador:
Palavrador is an interactive computer artwork conceived and produced in
2006, during the 38=BA Winter Festival sponsored by UFMG in Diamantina
(UNESCO World Heritage Centre). Over a 15 day period, artists and
professors from Brazilian Universities and abroad used a
transdisciplinary methodology to create content that would reflect the
complex scenario entwining arts, science and philosophy. At this
multimedia workshop, a proposal for a work created through collective
authorship mixing visual arts, literature and music emerged. Palavrador
is a poetic cyberworld built in 3D. It uses computational procedures
applying artificial life behaviors based on autonomous agents, and
computer graphics techniques to create poetic expressions. It was
conceived and implemented as a result of synergetic collective
assemblage of ideas and activities of the group. Authors with
backgrounds in arts, literature, and computer science worked together in
order to conceive and produce a cyberworld which has an interface as
interactive as games, as dynamic as motion pictures, and as deep as
poetic discourse.

Please do not send messages to the entire list when you intend only to

hi; just chiming in, because the unpublished sequel to DaDaDa is called
OOD:  Object-Oriented Design.

I'm not really a programmer programmer, never was.  But I wrote a few ADMs.
The ood idea for us was the opportunity to reduce, reuse, recycle the
objects, sorta like a script library or template, but, you know, not.

Well, we could cut to the chase and discuss whether or not language
poetry has or could become hegemonic. Is it inclusive enough to avoid
becoming so? Fascism is such an inflammatory word, one which even the
Right is hurling upon the Left!

Emanent new-work in the true world


Please note: If you check http://www.alansondheim.org/ every few days,
just click on recent images/videos/textfiles. We're beginning radio-work
in relation to the National Radio Quiet Zone in West Virginia. Sedlock
works with a vibration transducer, sensitive from around .1hz-400hz, as
well as a NASA Inspire very low frequency radio and long-wire antenna.
Foofwa d'Imobilite and Sedlock completed a set of split-node motion
capture work; I've been putting up examples. Azure, Foofwa, and Sedlock
worked on a group of large laser scans with and without movement; these
are still being processed. Abjection smears sound/space/time/inscription
across vibration, vlf radio, scan, motion capture - work either at the
limit, or smeared from the center. The center dissolves with sheave-skin
but recuperates with shell thickening in 3d post-processing software.
So far I'm fascinated by the images/sounds; although the differences with
the avatar/mocap videos may appear minute, they represent fairly large-
scale behavior differences in the studio.

Nick, yes, it's GREAT someone asked when not knowing, that's my point:
ASK.  D'Erasmo doesn't ask, she assumes to know.  But still, she DOES KNOW
that LANGUAGE poets exist!  And it's one thing for someone on this list to
ask, and yet entirely ANOTHER thing for someone writing for one of the most
read, most respected newspapers on the planet to NOT ask when she obviously
should ask.

Her point is that Bolano's point is that his invented characters are
ignored, unknown, chomping away at their typewriters, or computers, or
whatever they use to write their hate-filled literature.

Okay, first of all, LANGUAGE poets are clearly NOT unknown, maybe not known
as they should be, but they are recognized, to the point D'Erasmo casually
mentions them in her stupid book review.

Second, these Bolano characters are writing Nazi literature.  If D'Erasmo
doesn't know enough about who and what is LANGUAGE poetry, how on earth are
we to trust that she's lifting Bolano's ideas into this higher abstract of
seeing LANGUAGE poetry as fitting some compulsory equation for all avant
garde groups to slide into with HELLISH authority?

Are we to not inform ourselves at some point that LANGUAGE poetry is
inhabited by real live people who happen be real and live presently and are
as capable of seeing their way to their lives and this world through poetry
as any other school or philosophy?

And it really is not asking too much that the New York Times get better
fucking editors who INSIST their writers know what the fuck they're actually
writing about.  Frankly!

In case anyone has not begun to notice, the country, if not the world is about to get a huge 'rush' of '60's revisits from a variety of practically parallel historic eruptions and incidents. Ironically, these rememberances will be compatible with the vigorous rush within, behind and in opposition to the youth filled Obama rush.  April 23  will be the 40th anniversary of  Columbia 1968, which preceded Chicago '68, and Paris Fall '68, all of which were a relative Mandarin umbrella over the emergence of diverses black liberation struggles (Black Panthers, Black Muslims, Rap Brown), Feminism, Chicano liberation, etc. etc. All of which - in this country, at least -  a heavily racist, mysogynist  right wing has been literally 'hell bent' to repress, ignore for much of the last 40 years.  This 60's period - roughly until 1978 - also provoked the emergence of liberations in music (free form jazz - Sun Ra, Chicago Art Ensemble, Meredith Monk) - dance (Simon Forti, Ann Halperin,
 etc), theater (Growtowski, The Living Theater), and, least of all, poetry.  Forms and conventions broken and pushed to the max, the history of much of which has been maxed into the darkness. (True some of it went way overboard and there were real casualties. My favorite satire - not completely as such - is "My Dinner With Andre."

 I would suggest - particularly in the recent attention  and absorption with  Lang Po  and its  various internal and external views of historical significance - that what should be, ideally, a rich and informed revisit to significant political and cultural events of - to be accuarate let's call it 1965 to 1975 - that folks might question what has been lost, if not literally killed  from that era. And, while doing that maybe juxtapose the significance of Lang Po to that history - what was refuted, ignored or rejected?  What was  absorbed?

 My suspicion is that we are back in a great big historical swirl. If the Right has applied their equivalent of botox to make a disfiguration of  history, I suspect, or want to, that, Obama's campaign notwithstanding, we might be going back and forward into some real unhinging. A botox removal?

 Suspect after 7 years of this blatantly repressive, counter-imaginative regime, the country is ready for a new, and adventurous ride.

Folks, here's the podcast for "From Reznikoff to Public Enemy," now called "From Charles Reznikoff to Chuck D" (though it should probably be called "to Flava Flav," since I do a reading of "911 is a Joke").

Nick, yes, it's GREAT someone asked when not knowing, that's my point:
ASK.  D'Erasmo doesn't ask, she assumes to know.  But still, she DOES =
KNOW
that LANGUAGE poets exist!  And it's one thing for someone on this list =
to
ask, and yet entirely ANOTHER thing for someone writing for one of the =
most
read, most respected newspapers on the planet to NOT ask when she =
obviously
should ask.

Her point is that Bolano's point is that his invented characters are
ignored, unknown, chomping away at their typewriters, or computers, or
whatever they use to write their hate-filled literature.

Okay, first of all, LANGUAGE poets are clearly NOT unknown, maybe not =
known
as they should be, but they are recognized, to the point D'Erasmo =
casually
mentions them in her stupid book review.

Second, these Bolano characters are writing Nazi literature.  If =
D'Erasmo
doesn't know enough about who and what is LANGUAGE poetry, how on earth =
are
we to trust that she's lifting Bolano's ideas into this higher abstract =
of
seeing LANGUAGE poetry as fitting some compulsory equation for all avant
garde groups to slide into with HELLISH authority?

Are we to not inform ourselves at some point that LANGUAGE poetry is
inhabited by real live people who happen be real and live presently and =
are
as capable of seeing their way to their lives and this world through =
poetry
as any other school or philosophy?

And it really is not asking too much that the New York Times get better
fucking editors who INSIST their writers know what the fuck they're =
actually
writing about.  Frankly!

anyone had any recommendations as to what would be a good overview of

yes nick, or i think her assumption even more explicitly is langpo =
aesthetic absolutism.

i'd have to ask another question in response to your first, mary jo: what
evidence would one marshall in support of a claim that langpo "has become
hegemonic" -- are not language poets still well in the minority throughout
university creative writing programs, the literary press, the popular press,
the extensive system of prizes grants and awards, etc.?

your second question contains an interesting assumption: inclusivity
necessarily avoids hegemony.  that is, if you have a big enough tent, you
won't end up dominating? is this really the case? or the contrary, that if
you exclude you will inevitably dominate?

curious,
tom

... but, John, do please insert the proviso that -- like American Football
and baseball -- it's big in USAmerica, but nowhere else in the world.

"Parochial" doesn't even *begin to describe it.  <g>

Like you, I once wondered what it all was all about, but  being, I suspect,
older than you, I brought a bit of previous to this, having grown up in the
middle of the Glasgow Language Wars in the sixties.

Now there was a time ...

I now know what I'm supposed to think, but I'm not sure I really want to
know.

If I had to coin an image to describe what it all seems like from the
outside, langpo is a bit like Imagism without Ezra Pound.

Mind you, as the wheel of time turns in its courses, I'm currently engaged
in tracking the use of cant in English writing between 1500 and tomorrow,
and as such, I'm probably less than wholly sympathetic to poetic movements
that get gobbled up by the Academy before they're hardly even out of the
egg.

Yay! I really love this quote. My thoughts exactly.

It would be one thing if poetry were made of words alone,
but it is not--no more than words themselves are.

There are different periods of his work and Barthes' readers have different preferences accordingly. I would call your attention above all to his later work, that is, from the '70s, esp. A Lover's Discourse, Camera Lucida, and The Pleasure of the Text. In the French editions of his Oeuvres completes, these are in the 4th and 5th of the five volumes.

Despite the assertion here that Language poetry is of no interest outside the US, I can certainly attest than when poets in the general orbit of Language poetry came to read in the reading series I ran here in London, they generally got the biggest turnout. For whatever that's worth.

"Parochial" doesn't even *begin to describe it.

Like you, I once wondered what it all was all about, but being, I suspect,
older than you, I brought a bit of previous to this, having grown up in the
middle of the Glasgow Language Wars in the sixties.

Now there was a time ...

If I had to coin an image to describe what it all seems like from the
outside, langpo is a bit like Imagism without Ezra Pound.

Mind you, as the wheel of time turns in its courses, I'm currently engaged
in tracking the use of cant in English writing between 1500 and tomorrow,
and as such, I'm probably less than wholly sympathetic to poetic movements
that get gobbled up by the Academy before they're hardly even out of the

hi CA--

"someone" meant not Stacy D'Eraser but the guy who simply asked the list
politely what he should read, maybe two days ago...I was just
commenting on
the irony of that request being on this list.....

the main part of my message expresses what I still think is true:

	I don't think the implicit argument works along the lines
"langpo=nazism"--

	rather, I think, it's along the lines of "fascism=communism (langpo)
=extremism=
	poor, deluded, political writers who fail to share in the
comfortable bourgeois certainties of the NY Times"

this is not an excuse, but an analysis of why such an equation can
appear in the times--
I don't disagree with anything you say about language poetry.....

The metonymic and syntactical connection implied in this article between "l=
anguage poetry" and "fascism" is absurdly unfounded. The poets evoked by Bo=
lano's story sound more like the New Formalists than any other contemporary=
 movement, especially in their nostalgia for classical form. Language Poetr=
y has always been extremely clear about its stated anti-fascist and anti-he=
gemonic intentions. The article is basically confusing the popular front wi=
th fascism under the observation that both are groups, and both are concern=
ed with literary form. But nearly all writers are concerned with both issue=
s, also. That's not something particular to language poetry. We're all invo=
lved in literary micropoliticking, and some of us have bigger or smaller gr=
oups than others.

The involvement of a number of significant Jewish writers in Language poetr=
y furthermore causes this juxtaposition to border on anti-semitism.

For a reviewer to furthermore go out of her way to make such an offhanded a=
ccusatory remark through an indirect gesture raises the question for me of =
why she is spending her time reviewing books and accusing current literary =
movements of fascism while the President builds our standing army and conce=
ivably innocent citizens are being tortured at Guantanamo.

Well, it depends on whom or what you play them against.

[Or equally, what you mean by langpo?]

Tom Leonard, Kurt Schwitters, Barry Griffiths?

I'm not saying no one here has heard of Charles Bernstein,  just that the
loud drum of langpo in USAmerica is more like a tiny tinkle here.

british-poets is probably the major list here for sound/semantic/avant
poety, and I don't hear langpo being much discussed there, if at all.

[And on a more personal level, I have yet to be given one statement form a
langpoet that made me want to read more, or a quotation from a langpoet poem
that made me want to read further.

Sorry, mate.]

Robin: It was designed to be gobbled up by the academy.

And it's not that big in America, either. Parochial begins in a (few)
journals and MFA programs.

Baseball, on the other hand, is something you Brits definitely out to
think about importing. It would go so well with pasties and pies.

Tim: I think the article is wrongheaded, but I think you're a bit off
that "we're all involved in literary micropoliticking, " unless you
mean the sort of loose associations of affinity and enmity there have
always been. Large numbers of poets of my and the preceding
generation have had little to do with all but the most transient of
groupings, even among those who have posthumously, as it were, been
inducted into this or that group (sounds a bit like Mormon posthumous
conversion). Frankly, it's always ticked a lot of us off, even those
who have gained by it. I say this despite a genuine fondness for some
language poets and their poems. Though I'm not always sure what
defines so disparate a group beyond the critical lexicon.

Try this: One could see French poetry of the interwar period as
dominated by surrealism. Then one would have to remember Cocteau,
Jacob, Jammes, three who immediately come to mind as not part of the
club, not to mention those like Apollinaire who didn't live long
enough to to find out if they'd get the sign-up sheet (I doubt he
would have joined any club that didn't let Jacob in).

Well, it depends on whom or what you play them against.

Dear Amy , Barry & Friends-


It's my birthday  today so I thought to essay a reply to some of the
letters and especially to my friend Barry, who wrote that I had
equated fascism with language poetry, and that most on the list
including probably myself  included, have language poetry as the
foundation for their work, so how can one "attack." one's foundation?

Misreading I think is what produces so many  misundertandings, and is
best to address them I think before they become a locked in stone
profile of oneself and/ or others.

(A friend of mine from Latin America and myself have often thought and
at times begun to collect misreadings as a new form of enquiry into
the nature of the production of "misknowledge.," a new branch of
"mis-criticism." with which to produce ultimately "misled texts and
misleading texts."!)

 I did not equate language poetry with fascism, and actually  I do not
have language poetry as a foundation for my efforts as Barry writes.
To hopefully make matters a bit clearer, I thought to explain a little
of what my foundation so to speak is.

Unlike many people on this list, I did not know about language poetry
at all until later in life, beyond the "formative years"  during which
perhaps others discovered it.  For a thirteen year period of my teens
and twenties, I was living a lot in Europe, and when I came back to
America at one point I married, as generations and generations in my
family have since 1650 in Quebec, an Indian, a Mohawk.  For the next
many years a lot of my life was in the world of her family, the Mohawk
world,  the Indian Programs, and AIM.
The ideas and influences I had then and still do, are from  Europe
(primarily France), Vermont,  Boston and Milwaukee and the Indian
world  and street world and a lot of reading, movies, music, art and
so are rather different from most people here. Most of the last 7
years I've lived at the poverty level in the Central City after being
put on disability for degenerating spine from my back being broken
three times.   Combined with other factors, a good part of my life has
not been in the same country that probably most here know as
"America." I'd say where I live in a sense is always a liminal place,
crossing back and forth among various regions physically and mentally,
via the bus daily and via the mind continually.

I know that often  I have to remember to try to translate into terms
not my own things which are difficult enough to express  to begin with
.   Not having the shared foundation as Barry says  in language poetry
and some other areas that others do, I realize that many things which
mean something here mean the opposite to myself, and the world I've
lived in.  To try to grasp often what is being written one has to go
into a kind of reverse, almost a reverse engineering at times, to be
able to understand what is being presented from the other point of
view.

I try to understand from the other person's point of view and so read
as carefully as possible.

It is not at al that the writing or ideas are "difficult," but that
the frame within which they are formulated is one I have to try to
squeeze into and get a sense of the arrangement of the room.  It
participates in a world  and world view which is much narrower than
the one one is in, so it takes some work to essay the transition into
what may be called the normative academic /language world.

 Once within that frame, one essays to translate back and forth in
order to achieve some form of balance, and from that balance to essay
to express things which hopefully will not be misread. It's very
difficult at times, because terms that mean one thing to me to others
mean something else, and being the "odd man out," I have to learn
others' codes because one can't expect others to understand languages
which they are unaware of the existence of.

Misreading is a frequent occurrence with email, and one essays to not
be misread, as when it occurs, it can become weapon for violence
against whomever is judged to be the  culprit.
Sadly, miscommunications have been since time began the cause of a lot
ot unnecessary conflict.

 I'm very saddened by some comments as they were based on misreadings of my
 letter, as well as based on confusing what I write with what the
 reviewer writes.

I think the only way to find out what the reviewer meant is simply to
write her a thoughtful letter.
One can speculate until the cows home, and work oneself into a lather,
and be all bothered over nothing, if one finds out that perhaps what
the writer meant is not what was angering one.  I think the best thing
to do is address a letter to the reviewer, and in that way clear up
the problems one has with what she has written.

I should note also that one can't really speculate responsibly on who
and what the writers in the book are by extrapolating from what is in
the review. Read the book ! I say and find out for yourself. The
writers come from all classes and backgrounds and degrees of
education. and from various countries in North and South America.
What Bolano is presenting is a heterogeneous group of people most of
whom have no idea of each other.  The only one who is truly dangerous
is Lieutenant Ramirez Hoffman of the last chapter, who becomes
Alberto Ruiz-Tagle aka Carlos Weider and is the "star" of the
brilliant and harrowing novella Distant Star.


 It is saddening to me to find misreadings of what I write because it
occurs among a group of people who are
 professional readers and writers with whom one is hoping to share
 ideas and information which may be of interest and use.

As I understand it, one of the tenets of language poetry is close
reading. Perhaps due to email format, close reading seems to dissolve
often here in the blurs of speed reading, in which the reader skims,
scans and seeks for "key words" and word clusters." These, read in
haste and ignoring context=97another tenet of language poetry which I
admire=97are seized on and become "monsters from the deep."

 I think more than most I have tried to abide by and contribute  what
 the list states as its goals:

 . Our aim is to support, inform, and extend those directions in poetry
 that are committed to innovations, renovations, and investigations of
 form and/or/as content, to the questioning of received forms and
 styles, and to the creation of the otherwise unimagined, untried,
 unexpected, improbable, and impossible . . .  The Poetics List exists
 to support and encourage divergent points of view on innovative forms
 of modern and contemporary poetry and poetics, and we are committed to
 do what is necessary to preserve this space for such dialog.

 In my letter I am trying to convey why the reading of Roberto Bolano's
 works--especially By Night in Chile, Distant Star and some of the
stories in Last Evenings on Earth- is of such interest and use to
American readers in thinking
 about the situation here post 9/11 2001 via the ways Bolano writes of
 confronting the situation in Chile before, during and after the events
 of 9/11 1973.  By citing the example of Naomi Klein's great work, The
 Shock Doctrine, I presented an easy-to-find source for a lot of my
 recent thinking  on the concrete cultural, historical, economic,
 military and extra legal uses of torture  which directly demonstrate
 the close interrelationships among Chile post 1973 and what is
 happening in the USA post 2001.

I have written of Bolano and his works a number of times on this list,
and am working on some essays which draw on his work.
I have been reading and thinking on his works for over three
years now, and for a year had greatly anticipated the scheduled
release of this volume. (Frankly compared to others of his works, I
found it a
little bit disappointing in terms of the writing.)

I  think his work is truly remarkable and of great interest to
contemporary American readers. It engages many issues which are being
faced in the post 9/11 USA, itself the origin of the events which
shaped the directions Bolano's life and work were to take beginning on
9/11 1973.
This particular book that is reviewed is one that has enjoyed an
immense popularity and acclaim in Latin America especially, where the
realities which gave rise to its fictions are all too real to millions
of readers.

As Naomi Klein and Naomi Wolf, among a great many others have written,
many of the fictions and realities which are present in  Bolano's
worlds have been arriving in America for some time, and creating a
kind of "blowback" reality especially since 9/11.  That makes the work
al the more interesting and necessary as a kind of "through a glass,
darkly" method of viewing from that past created in large by the US,
the reality that the US. is becoming in the present.

 "Context"--is what I am essaying to provide, rather than reductive
sound bytes. Like a number of the language poets, Context to me is an
issue of great importance in writing and thinking about writing.

he discussion almost a hundred years ago in Russia among the
Formalists, (Russian) Futurists and Marxists on the occasion of
Marinetti's grand tour of Russia in 1913 I think of the greatest
interest still today in relation with a number of the discussions here
and my own interests.

The question of speed in relation with vision and hearing has been one
that especially interests me.  And from that speed--the examination of
information and disinformation
which is both received and transmitted, and the study of these in
documents, treating texts as documentary sources which are at the same
time quasi fictional in nature in relation with language.

The origins of the word avant-garde are military, and this connection
of the avant-garde in War and in poetry and the arts was made  by the
first self-professed avant-garde movement of the 20th Century, Italian
Futurism.  Due to Italian Futurism's later association with fascism,
many of its ideas did not receive much recognition outside of Italy for
many decades. Like Paul Virilio, a figure who has greatly inspired me,
I am interested in examining and reexamining the interrelationships of
contemporary culture and the developments of technologies which
originate in the military that Italian Futurism opened the door to.  I
have also read a great deal of work on economics, security,
surveillance, counter insurgency and insurgency and intelligence
issues which, like those of Naomi Klein and the authors of such works
as Curveball, The Italian  Letter and Collusion have opened I find
many ways to widen the scope of the creation and study of writing in
all its media.


 One of my main concerns is expressed in a quote I began a Pound letter
 with which was perhaps overlooked.

 The government under pretext of security and progress liberated us
 from our land, resources, culture, dignity and future. They violated
 every treaty they ever made with us. I use the word "liberated"
 loosely and sarcastically, in the same vein that I view the use of the
 words "collateral damage" when they kill innocent men, women and
 children.
 They describe people defending their homelands as terrorists, savages
 and hostiles . . .
 My words reach out to the non-Indian: Look now before it is too
 late=97see what is being done to others in your name and see what
 destruction you sanction when you say nothing.
 =97Leonard Peltier, Annual Message January 2004

 Perhaps due to  my shared heritage with Mr Peltier, to having lived in
 countries aboard which were under repressive regimes, and to my living
 situation of the last seven years,  this warning may be more immediate
 and real to myself than others.


Rather than listening to the "promises" of language, of which I am
 very skeptical, I hope to find other ways in which there is the
 language of promise, that is of, of openness into a different
 situation and writing than the current dominant ones have to offer,
 let alone impose.

I don't think in this regard I'm particularly different than anyone else he=
re.

Paul Celan wrote:  "Poetry no longer imposes itself, it exposes itself."
This is the writing I find "exposed" in the ground and streets via the
rubBEings, and all those writings hidden in plain site/sight/cite from
that which looks out at writing and the world, looks back at the
writing and world which  is being "imposed, "  "imposing itself" on
the ground itself so that no other poetry or writing may be found.

For myself, and my work, from the perspective which is mine, many
things that occur in language and in writing I find heard and seen in
a different accent, and so work to understand what it is others are
hearing and seeing in order to understand what it is that seems the
opposite to me in  what others say.

The words that mean certain things easily understood and that are
accepted by a great many others, and find their way into the society
and culture and spread steadily, it is not so easy for myself to
accept with the same ease. I think that Mr Peltier indicates the
usefulness of this, in that it provides society with persons who
question with a deeper skepticism and more of a life and death
concern, things which promise to "liberate" one.

Scepticism is necessary for survival in a society which too often says
and writes one thing and then acts in the opposite way.

I hope that makes clearer that I share a direction with  this list, I
simply find a different means continually with which to keep moving in
that direction.

Barry,

Interesting that you would focus on Barthes's later work, with which
assessment I completely agree. I would add to your list the volume *The
Responsibility of Forms*, particularly the essay on Einstenstein's Stills
{from films], which deals with the idea of the third eye. I would add the
essays on Loyola and Fourrier (which appear in a single book with the essay
on Sade). I also like his essay on the human voice, comparing I think two
kinds of singers, one based on expressiveness and the other on something
like timber. I do not remember the title of the essay. Finally, I would
suggest Barthes's posthumous book which includes three fascinating sections,
the first describing the "light" in different parts of France, the second
consisting of his journal in North Africa chasing boys, the third being
"Parisian Nights," his diary in the last few days of his life. In the very
last entry of this diary (I think) Barthes says he does not want to live any
more if he stops being attractive to other men, a revelation suggesting that
the "accident" of being hit by a bus (streetcar?) may have been a suicide
after all. The French love euphemisms, officiial fictions as much as
anybody. This posthumous book came packed, and may still be, with another
book by a gay academician; that book is totally dismissable and I remember
being annoyed to have to buy both books together.

Years ago, I used to give a workshop on writing of poetry. The first text
the participants had to read was the North African Journal, me asking them
how or if this "memoir" was in any way different from Barthes's other books.

I think *The Pleasure of the Text* was a great break and a new departure for
Barthes. In that book he asserts the reality of a "chaotic," disjointed
dimension in the [his] experience of reading. A lot of his later work is I
think an expansion of this "chaotic" ("the third eye") factor. Obviously,
this goes against the principle in semiotics where one assumes every
gesture, every act is symbolically determined. Barry, you seem to be aware
of it.

Another book of his I like is *Barthes on Barthes*, where a "life" is told
in essay/fragments (I think numbered). I was also very affected that he
introduces photographs in the first section of this book in one saying, "*
this* is the way I looked at a certain age." This radical introduction of
the "eye" into writing, its introduction in a new way, had a profound effect
on me establishing possibilities of new relationships between words and
seeing. The very first seeds of my essay *The Peripheral Space of
Photography*, where I say photography more than being a plastic medium
related to painting is a meditative medium relating to words, were planted
by the photographs in *Barthes on Barthes* (and later the essay on
Einstenstein's stills). Barthes discovers a completely new way (a "pasive,"
erotic way) the eyes can enter literature, which leads to the concept of a
literary space, a tactile space created by words. Barthes first brings this
idea in his essay on Loyola (along with the Fourrier essay written while he
was also writing his "private" North Africacan journals) which ends with the
statement [I am paraphrasing], "All I remember of Loyola are his eyes, full
of tears."

I'm not so sure ANY poetry is meant to be outside the academy at this point,
Mark.  Being someone outside the academy I find that I'm going to have to go
INSIDE the academy whether I like it or not.  Not as a student, but, THIS
LIST for instance.  PENNSOUND for instance.  You're someone I respect very
much, but I can't say I agree with some of what you say here.

But it seems, like anything, almost anything at all at this point, if there
is a way to create money from it, then it gets plugged into the banks and
the loans and the ON button gets pushed and visiting poets get funded, and
workshops and readings and luncheons and retreats and lectures and whatever
else gets going.

And furthermore the experimental schools are a much smaller wedge of pie in
the academic machine of poetry wouldn't you say?  And I'm NOT EVEN saying
that I dislike the poems coming out of all of these schools, I'm simply
stating a fact.  It's rare to find a poet who does not have, or is
not going for a Masters.

And getting back to D'Erasmo's book review, no, I'm not seeing how the
argument works.  Meaning no one here, not one of you, has yet pointed out
HOW the LANGUAGE poets are fascists.  And I do mean fascists in whatever
terms you mean.  Fascist because why?  Fascist because they are the brand
name now for all and any experimentation in poetry?  Can we get some real
answers here please?

For years and years I've encountered these vague arguments, which apparently
work in some circles since even D'Erasmo herself doesn't seem to need to
know ANYTHING about LANGUAGE poetry in order to make bold declarative
statements in the New York Times.  Her peers read her review and nod
approvingly, and it stays that way, and it's in the New York Times after all
and therefore all but irreproachable evidence of fact.

For years I've heard rumors.  Many rumors.  Murmurs.  Constant chattering
about LANGUAGE poets.  When I was a teen it made me WANT to know who these
miscreants were!  And when I finally meet them I find that they're some of
the most generous poets I've ever met, frankly.  FAR MORE generous than some
faculty I've met at places like Iowa, and Warren Wilson (Warren Wilson is a
stone's throw from the grounds of Black Mountain College, yet half a world
away in every other respect).

I'm telling you that from MY own experience the LANGUAGE poets are much more
interested in hearing me do WHAT I WANT with my poems, using ANY means in
this world to create a different sound, or image.  But these others, from
these more mainstream schools, THOSE are the REAL fascists!

Many stories I could impart!  Stories of HAMMERING away at poet friends of
mine in workshops to MAKE them see how wrong they are for daring to write
the way they want.  One friend of mine persuaded me to send poems to her
school's literary magazine, forgetting how much her own poems had been
altered to fit their Robert Frost and Louise Gluck codes.  A professor of
that school ACTUALLY SAID TO ME in the rejection letter, "Why do you feel
the need to reinvent the wheel?"

I'm not even angry at that statement.  Amused partially, creeped out
partially, with a little room for sadness.

LISTEN, I do not consider myself a LANGUAGE poet.  Yet at the same time I
will not pretend I have not learned MUCH from them!  MUCH!  The LANGUAGE
poets are just as rich and fertile a place for a poet to find and absorb
extraordinary tools as is The New York School, Black Mountain, Surrealists,
Futurists, etc.

My experience has also been that the LANGUAGE poets themselves, as people,
aren't the monsters I was led to believe they were when I was a kid.  It was
more than a little shocking to find out just how untrue the stories had
actually been.  I was expecting some sort of crazed Pound figure yelling and
screaming, but instead found men and women who took time to say, Hey, have
you read So-And-So?  What do you think of So-And-So?  Or, if you LIKE this,
then look at THIS!  The enthusiasm for poetry is alive and well in that
community, it's undeniable!

While I would certainly not claim that LangPo has swept the world, my =
own experience (perfectly anecdotal) is that it seems to crop up =
wherever I turn.  Just this last weekend I met a young Polish poet very =
interested in, knowledgeable about, and influenced by LangPo; as well as =
an Aussie musician, poet, scholar, whose work I don't know, but who is =
certainly quite interested in and knowledgeable about the folks =
involved.  Several years ago at a summer seminar I struck up a =
friendship with a Frenchman similarly immersed in Language Poetries (and =
its affinities/tensions with contemporary French poetry).  And, last =
year, I heard Charles Bernstein introduced by an eminent scholar who has =
been no partisan champion of LangPo as "the man who has done more than =
any single living poet to shape how we read poetry today."  Indeed, I =
find it impossible to imagine contemporary writing without Charles & Co. =
 Has language poetry become dominant and/or hegemonic?  I think not.  =
But its significance both within and beyond these shores cannot be =
shrugged off.

For brilliancy in close reading (Balzac in this case), I'd recommend S/Z.
The essays in Image-Music-Text have been helpful to me in reconsidering the

Well, I guess the Japanese are going to be pretty disappointed to learn that
baseball isn't big in their country. I suspect that the same disappointment

 Thank you for your recent e-mail expressing your support for the City's
extension of the lease of City property to Beyond Baroque.  We applaud the
wonderful work that this organization performs for our City residents, and
wish to make clear that the City Attorney's Office is not in any way
prohibiting the City from continuing its long-standing relationship with
Beyond Baroque.

The City Council and Mayor are responsible for decisions to lease City
property.  The City Attorney's Office's role in these matters is solely to
approve the form of the lease and to advise City officials regarding
applicable laws.  The City Attorney's Office does not set or control policy
in leasing matters.

We understand that Council Member Rosendahl has recommended to the City
Council that the City's lease with Beyond Baroque be extended.

If you have questions about the Council Member's motion or the Council
process going forward, you may wish to speak with his office.

Again, thank you for taking the time to send your e-mail.

  I want to thank you in advance for the lease renewal for Beyond Baroque,
located in Venice's former city hall?  Fire station?

I am a poet, and I have read and taught at Beyond Baroque many times.  When
I moved from New York to Los Angeles, I stopped at Beyond Baroque on the way
to the temporary housing from LAX.  THAT's the sort of national and
international reputation BB has -- it has put that particular community on

I don't think it's *just me -- the most agressive innovative list here --
British and Irish Poets -- discusses lots of things which would seem to fall
into this area, but langpo isn't normally among them.  Perhaps there's a
feeling that it had all been done already here by J.H.Prynne.

That said, when I first came across the term a few years ago, I was curious
enough, like John, to see what it was all about.  Nothing I read, whether in

Oh, we've got it here, maybe even had it before you lot, just that it's
called rounders and is played by little boys and girls on the beach,
normally.

Not that I want to be judgmental <g>.

Equally, we don't (yet) have anything quite like the MFA system in the
States.  For better or worse.  This may partly have to do with the
alternative tradition of the Group (in the technical sense -- Cambridge,
London, Belfast, Glasgow, to mention the most prominent, and elsewhere).  So
the institutionalisation of poetry isn't quite the same here in the UK as in
the USA.

Hi,
I've just joined the list: I'm Obododimma Oha from Nigeria. Amanda, I suggest you pick a copy of Image-Music-Text, a collection of writings by Barthes. You have full texts of essays such as "The Death of the Author", "Rhetoric of the Image", "Photographic Image", etc published there. Best wishes.

On Barthes: most do start of with S/Z for an introduction to the concept =

'Let Freedom Ring'
Art and Democracy in the King Years 1954 â€“ 1968

A Lannan Literary Symposium & Festival

By sweeping away legal segregation in the public sphere, and especially by
securing the right to participate in the democratic franchise for people of
color, the Civil Rights Movement fundamentally changed American life. This
struggle for social justice has been well documented and justly honored. Less
well-documented is how the arts helped sustain the Movement and were essential
to its successes. On the fortieth anniversary of the death of Dr. Martin Luther
King, the Lannan Literary Symposium seeks to acknowledge this legacy while
paying special attention to the contributions of poets, writers, and artists to
the public discourse of the Movement, especially during the period Taylor
Branch has called "the King Years," 1954 -1968.

Readings, performances, lectures, and discussions will take place on April 15,
16, & 17 at Georgetown University, in Washington, DC.

This same review appeared two days earlier with a somewhat less
inflammatory title. It seems  D'Erasmo has an axe to grind and/or
needs controversy to promote her own career as novelist-professor.

"They are, in other words, writers. Substitute, say, "language poetry"
for "fascism" and the trajectory of these invented lives would be much
the same as they are for the busy networks of real writers Bola=F1o knew
from the inside out. Whereas in "By Night in Chile" Bola=F1o's
dissection of hypocrisy and bad faith (the main character is a morally
bankrupt priest allied with the junta) is swift and merciless, here it
is not only as if the writer in him couldn't keep himself from
filigreeing in endless perfect and revealing details about his lost
souls and their laughable oeuvres, but also as if he couldn't entirely
resist them."

Apparently she couldn't resist either.

There are many interesting points in your post, David, as usual--but as usual for me I can only address one thing at a time. In this case I simply want to point out that you are mistaken in saying that language poetry is tied to a practice of close reading. I don't actually think that's true, at least not close reading in the sense that I learned in college and came from the "new criticism", Cleanth Brooks and all that. This is not the best way to appreciate language poetry, which opens up much more under a more free-floating field of attention. This is something that I remember Ron Silliman writing about somewhere, though someone else will have to supply a specific reference.

David Chirot <david.chirot@GMAIL.COM> wrote:  Dear Amy , Barry & Friends-


It's my birthday today so I thought to essay a reply to some of the
letters and especially to my friend Barry, who wrote that I had
equated fascism with language poetry, and that most on the list
including probably myself included, have language poetry as the
foundation for their work, so how can one "attack." one's foundation?

Misreading I think is what produces so many misundertandings, and is
best to address them I think before they become a locked in stone
profile of oneself and/ or others.

(A friend of mine from Latin America and myself have often thought and
at times begun to collect misreadings as a new form of enquiry into
the nature of the production of "misknowledge.," a new branch of
"mis-criticism." with which to produce ultimately "misled texts and
misleading texts."!)

I did not equate language poetry with fascism, and actually I do not
have language poetry as a foundation for my efforts as Barry writes.
To hopefully make matters a bit clearer, I thought to explain a little
of what my foundation so to speak is.

Unlike many people on this list, I did not know about language poetry
at all until later in life, beyond the "formative years" during which
perhaps others discovered it. For a thirteen year period of my teens
and twenties, I was living a lot in Europe, and when I came back to
America at one point I married, as generations and generations in my
family have since 1650 in Quebec, an Indian, a Mohawk. For the next
many years a lot of my life was in the world of her family, the Mohawk
world, the Indian Programs, and AIM.
The ideas and influences I had then and still do, are from Europe
(primarily France), Vermont, Boston and Milwaukee and the Indian
world and street world and a lot of reading, movies, music, art and
so are rather different from most people here. Most of the last 7
years I've lived at the poverty level in the Central City after being
put on disability for degenerating spine from my back being broken
three times. Combined with other factors, a good part of my life has
not been in the same country that probably most here know as
"America." I'd say where I live in a sense is always a liminal place,
crossing back and forth among various regions physically and mentally,
via the bus daily and via the mind continually.

I know that often I have to remember to try to translate into terms
not my own things which are difficult enough to express to begin with
. Not having the shared foundation as Barry says in language poetry
and some other areas that others do, I realize that many things which
mean something here mean the opposite to myself, and the world I've
lived in. To try to grasp often what is being written one has to go
into a kind of reverse, almost a reverse engineering at times, to be
able to understand what is being presented from the other point of
view.

I try to understand from the other person's point of view and so read
as carefully as possible.

It is not at al that the writing or ideas are "difficult," but that
the frame within which they are formulated is one I have to try to
squeeze into and get a sense of the arrangement of the room. It
participates in a world and world view which is much narrower than
the one one is in, so it takes some work to essay the transition into
what may be called the normative academic /language world.

Once within that frame, one essays to translate back and forth in
order to achieve some form of balance, and from that balance to essay
to express things which hopefully will not be misread. It's very
difficult at times, because terms that mean one thing to me to others
mean something else, and being the "odd man out," I have to learn
others' codes because one can't expect others to understand languages
which they are unaware of the existence of.

Misreading is a frequent occurrence with email, and one essays to not
be misread, as when it occurs, it can become weapon for violence
against whomever is judged to be the culprit.
Sadly, miscommunications have been since time began the cause of a lot
ot unnecessary conflict.

I'm very saddened by some comments as they were based on misreadings of my
letter, as well as based on confusing what I write with what the
reviewer writes.

I think the only way to find out what the reviewer meant is simply to
write her a thoughtful letter.
One can speculate until the cows home, and work oneself into a lather,
and be all bothered over nothing, if one finds out that perhaps what
the writer meant is not what was angering one. I think the best thing
to do is address a letter to the reviewer, and in that way clear up
the problems one has with what she has written.

I should note also that one can't really speculate responsibly on who
and what the writers in the book are by extrapolating from what is in
the review. Read the book ! I say and find out for yourself. The
writers come from all classes and backgrounds and degrees of
education. and from various countries in North and South America.
What Bolano is presenting is a heterogeneous group of people most of
whom have no idea of each other. The only one who is truly dangerous
is Lieutenant Ramirez Hoffman of the last chapter, who becomes
Alberto Ruiz-Tagle aka Carlos Weider and is the "star" of the
brilliant and harrowing novella Distant Star.


It is saddening to me to find misreadings of what I write because it
occurs among a group of people who are
professional readers and writers with whom one is hoping to share
ideas and information which may be of interest and use.

As I understand it, one of the tenets of language poetry is close
reading. Perhaps due to email format, close reading seems to dissolve
often here in the blurs of speed reading, in which the reader skims,
scans and seeks for "key words" and word clusters." These, read in
haste and ignoring context—another tenet of language poetry which I
admire—are seized on and become "monsters from the deep."

I think more than most I have tried to abide by and contribute what
the list states as its goals:

. Our aim is to support, inform, and extend those directions in poetry
that are committed to innovations, renovations, and investigations of
form and/or/as content, to the questioning of received forms and
styles, and to the creation of the otherwise unimagined, untried,
unexpected, improbable, and impossible . . . The Poetics List exists
to support and encourage divergent points of view on innovative forms
of modern and contemporary poetry and poetics, and we are committed to
do what is necessary to preserve this space for such dialog.

In my letter I am trying to convey why the reading of Roberto Bolano's
works--especially By Night in Chile, Distant Star and some of the
stories in Last Evenings on Earth- is of such interest and use to
American readers in thinking
about the situation here post 9/11 2001 via the ways Bolano writes of
confronting the situation in Chile before, during and after the events
of 9/11 1973. By citing the example of Naomi Klein's great work, The
Shock Doctrine, I presented an easy-to-find source for a lot of my
recent thinking on the concrete cultural, historical, economic,
military and extra legal uses of torture which directly demonstrate
the close interrelationships among Chile post 1973 and what is
happening in the USA post 2001.

I have written of Bolano and his works a number of times on this list,
and am working on some essays which draw on his work.
I have been reading and thinking on his works for over three
years now, and for a year had greatly anticipated the scheduled
release of this volume. (Frankly compared to others of his works, I
found it a
little bit disappointing in terms of the writing.)

I think his work is truly remarkable and of great interest to
contemporary American readers. It engages many issues which are being
faced in the post 9/11 USA, itself the origin of the events which
shaped the directions Bolano's life and work were to take beginning on
9/11 1973.
This particular book that is reviewed is one that has enjoyed an
immense popularity and acclaim in Latin America especially, where the
realities which gave rise to its fictions are all too real to millions
of readers.

As Naomi Klein and Naomi Wolf, among a great many others have written,
many of the fictions and realities which are present in Bolano's
worlds have been arriving in America for some time, and creating a
kind of "blowback" reality especially since 9/11. That makes the work
al the more interesting and necessary as a kind of "through a glass,
darkly" method of viewing from that past created in large by the US,
the reality that the US. is becoming in the present.

"Context"--is what I am essaying to provide, rather than reductive
sound bytes. Like a number of the language poets, Context to me is an
issue of great importance in writing and thinking about writing.

he discussion almost a hundred years ago in Russia among the
Formalists, (Russian) Futurists and Marxists on the occasion of
Marinetti's grand tour of Russia in 1913 I think of the greatest
interest still today in relation with a number of the discussions here
and my own interests.

The question of speed in relation with vision and hearing has been one
that especially interests me. And from that speed--the examination of
information and disinformation
which is both received and transmitted, and the study of these in
documents, treating texts as documentary sources which are at the same
time quasi fictional in nature in relation with language.

The origins of the word avant-garde are military, and this connection
of the avant-garde in War and in poetry and the arts was made by the
first self-professed avant-garde movement of the 20th Century, Italian
Futurism. Due to Italian Futurism's later association with fascism,
many of its ideas did not receive much recognition outside of Italy for
many decades. Like Paul Virilio, a figure who has greatly inspired me,
I am interested in examining and reexamining the interrelationships of
contemporary culture and the developments of technologies which
originate in the military that Italian Futurism opened the door to. I
have also read a great deal of work on economics, security,
surveillance, counter insurgency and insurgency and intelligence
issues which, like those of Naomi Klein and the authors of such works
as Curveball, The Italian Letter and Collusion have opened I find
many ways to widen the scope of the creation and study of writing in
all its media.


One of my main concerns is expressed in a quote I began a Pound letter
with which was perhaps overlooked.

The government under pretext of security and progress liberated us
from our land, resources, culture, dignity and future. They violated
every treaty they ever made with us. I use the word "liberated"
loosely and sarcastically, in the same vein that I view the use of the
words "collateral damage" when they kill innocent men, women and
children.
They describe people defending their homelands as terrorists, savages
and hostiles . . .
My words reach out to the non-Indian: Look now before it is too
late—see what is being done to others in your name and see what
destruction you sanction when you say nothing.
—Leonard Peltier, Annual Message January 2004

Perhaps due to my shared heritage with Mr Peltier, to having lived in
countries aboard which were under repressive regimes, and to my living
situation of the last seven years, this warning may be more immediate
and real to myself than others.


Rather than listening to the "promises" of language, of which I am
very skeptical, I hope to find other ways in which there is the
language of promise, that is of, of openness into a different
situation and writing than the current dominant ones have to offer,
let alone impose.

I don't think in this regard I'm particularly different than anyone else here.

Paul Celan wrote: "Poetry no longer imposes itself, it exposes itself."
This is the writing I find "exposed" in the ground and streets via the
rubBEings, and all those writings hidden in plain site/sight/cite from
that which looks out at writing and the world, looks back at the
writing and world which is being "imposed, " "imposing itself" on
the ground itself so that no other poetry or writing may be found.

For myself, and my work, from the perspective which is mine, many
things that occur in language and in writing I find heard and seen in
a different accent, and so work to understand what it is others are
hearing and seeing in order to understand what it is that seems the
opposite to me in what others say.

The words that mean certain things easily understood and that are
accepted by a great many others, and find their way into the society
and culture and spread steadily, it is not so easy for myself to
accept with the same ease. I think that Mr Peltier indicates the
usefulness of this, in that it provides society with persons who
question with a deeper skepticism and more of a life and death
concern, things which promise to "liberate" one.

Scepticism is necessary for survival in a society which too often says
and writes one thing and then acts in the opposite way.

I hope that makes clearer that I share a direction with this list, I
simply find a different means continually with which to keep moving in
that direction.

Critic David Lehman has called the New York School of Poetry "the Last
Avant Garde." Poet and critic Maggie Nelson suggests it might better be
considered "one of the first gay avant gardes," since its original members
included Frank O'Hara, John Ashbery and James Schuyler. We examine the
role of women in the New York School: Barbara Guest, Alice Notley,
Bernadette Mayer and Eileen Myles. How did these women pave the way for
today's women poets, who, like Maggie Nelson, are conscious of gender and
its effects on poetry?

 I'm proud to say I had (lost it) a letter from Roland Barthes, in which he wrote (excuse the lack of diacritical marks)? "J'ecris pour etre aime de loin." (I write to be loved from afar). Since my letter to him was a criticism of Le Plaisir du Texte,"? he added that in my case, "C'est rate."? (It? didn't work).

Before I could write to him again telling him how much I loved his work, he was hit by the damned laundry truck.

I would start reading Barthes at the fabulously fun Mythologies.

Hi,
I've just joined the list: I'm Obododimma Oha from Nigeria. Amanda, I suggest
you pick a copy of Image-Music-Text, a collection of writings by Barthes. You
have full texts of essays such as "The Death of the Author", "Rhetoric of the
Image", "Photographic Image", etc published there. Best wishes.
Obododimma.

i often see references to / excerpts from the work of Roland Barthes,
particularly in discussions on language poetry. i was wondering if
anyone had any recommendations as to what would be a good overview of
his writing or where to start.

If anything, baseball is bigger in Japan than in the
USA. It's pretty big in Latin America and the
Caribbean as well. Not so big in Mexico, as far as
I've seen.

**Dream Bitches
http://www.dreambitches.org/
http://www.myspace.com/dreambitches
=20
After a debut record that merely hinted at the cacophonous pop sound of =B990=
s
bands like The Breeders and The Muffs, NYC=B9s Dream Bitches plunge in
head-first on their sophomore LP, Coke-and-Spiriters, out on Recommended If
You Like Records this March.
=20
The band, co-fronted by Yoko Kikuchi and Ann Zakaluk, formed back in the
fall of 2003, when the two long-time friends and musical collaborators took
a drive to Atlantic City and watched a bucket of quarters pour from the
mouth of a slot machine. They'd struck it rich! The first Dream Bitches son=
g
was born, as was the band.
=20
The two quickly found themselves playing all over New York, performing as a
duo. Guitarist Casey Holford joined the fray just before the band recorded
their 2005 debut, Sanfransisters, a playful folk-pop affair with jangly
acoustic guitars and catchy choruses that made Dream Bitches an East Villag=
e
cult sensation. To realize the full-band sound of the record, bassist Julie
DeLano and drummer Jen.Knee were recruited to complete the lineup.
=20
After two years as a five piece, the band naturally rocks harder and louder=
,
and so does its sophomore record. Coke-and-Spiriters captures the band at
their most volatile, featuring 10 tracks of distorted rock hooks and
hyper-literate acoustic ballads. Snarling anthems like "Maniacal Mechanic"
and "Bad Luck Bill" lend a new spirit of rock =B9n=B9 roll bombast to the
relentlessly wordy lyrics that make Kikuchi a classic antifolk songwriter i=
n
the tradition of Rough Trade=B9s Jeffrey Lewis and K Records=B9 Kimya Dawson.
Coke-and-Spiriters was recorded by Mark Ospovat of Emandee Studios
(CocoRosie, Wooden Wand, Jeff Lewis) and produced by Casey Holford (Cheese
on Bread, Daouets). After the release of the album, Dream Bitches will play
select dates throughout the United States.

http://www.serenamusic.com
=20
Serena Jost is a Swiss-American singer/songwriter and cellist living in New
York City. Her forthcoming record, Closer Than Far, was produced by Brad
Albetta (Martha Wainwright, Teddy Thompson) and mixed at Monkeyboy Studios
in NYC. This stunning debut features Serena singing and playing guitar,
cello, and piano. Some of NYC=B9s tastiest musicians help to bring these
remarkable songs to life, which =B3seamlessly merge classical and pop
melodies=B2. (Lucidculture) Closer Than Far will be released at Joe=B9s Pub on
March 3rd, 2008.
=20
Serena has performed at seminal NYC venues such as The Living Room, Barbes,
Joe=B9s Pub, Tonic, Banjo Jim=B9s, Pete=B9s Candy Store, The Bowery Poetry Club,
The Kitchen and St. Mark=B9s Church. She is an original member of Rasputina,
the well-corseted cello group, and has collaborated with numerous other
artists including poet Dan Machlin (=B3Above Islands=B2 on Immanent Audio), and
has toured the United States and Europe extensively.

**Robert Kerr
=20
Robert Kerr is a playwright and songwriter living in Brooklyn. He wrote the
book and lyrics for the short musical The Sticky-Fingered Fianc=E9e, and the
songs for his plays Kingdom Gone and Meet Uncle Casper, as well as his
Brothers Grimm adaptations Bearskin and The Juniper Tree. He was a founding
member of the Minneapolis band Alien Detector.

**Chris Maher
http://www.myspace.com/chrismaher
http://www.chrismaher.net
=20
(pronounced mar): A young songwriter from New York City, wise beyond his
years and schooled below his wisdom, proud and protective of the tricks up
his sleeve. His music is oft an exercise in contradiction: Neurotic and
savvy, country and city, wry and idealistic. He=B9s a deft adjuster but his
fear of pigeonholes has been his pitfall=8Bto date, he has only two =B3released=
=B2
songs to his credit.
=20
This is, perhaps, because Chris has always felt most comfortable on the
fence, never willing to confine himself to any one musical community. Back
in the early 2000s, when first crashing the Lower East Side=B9s
love-it-or-detest-it Antifolk scene, Chris was also playing bass for hip-ho=
p
band Automato (Dim Mak/Capitol) as they were writing their DFA-produced
debut=8Bwhat else to do when Woody Guthrie and Wu-Tang Clan make equal sense.
=20
New York=B9s Recommended If You Like Records released the first of two
commercially available Maher-penned songs, =B3Summer Song,=B2 in 2004. It=B9s the
A-side of the debut release by The Morningsides, a two-song, 7-inch single
recorded by Walter Martin of The Walkmen. The single received considerable
praise and generous college radio airplay, but the band fractured before
committing anything else to tape. It wasn=B9t until late 2005 that Chris=B9
first =B3solo=B2 release, an early version of his =B3Ungrown Flowers=B2=8Bappeared on
Seattle label Baskerville Hill=B9s 2005 compilation Dr. Rhinocerous or, How I
Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Charge.
=20
Chris has previewed countless other compositions in various places: On the
radio (in both the U.S. and the U.K.), via the Internet and during his
frequent live shows. One song, =B3Pretty Smile,=B2 made its debut in the short
film, Rewind, by German filmmaker Joerg Steineck. Since 2006, Chris has
spent considerable time on the road, touring throughout the United States
and Europe. He has shared bills with a smorgasbord of fellow songwriters
such as M. Ward (Merge / 4AD), Mike Doughty (ATO), Kimya Dawson (K), Nellie
McKay (Columbia / Hungry Mouse), and Jeffrey Lewis (Rough Trade). He has
also appeared, as a singer and a multi-instrumentalist, on a number of othe=
r
peoples=B9 albums, including Throw Me the Statue=B9s Moonbeams (Secretly
Canadian / Baskerville Hill), Jack Lewis=B9 Lvov Goes to Emandee (Smoking
Gun), Huggabroomstik=B9s Ultimate Huggabroomstik (Luv-A-Lot), and Phoebe
Kreutz's Big Lousy Moon (self-released).
=20
Now, at long last, Recommended If You Like Records is gearing up to release
Chris=B9 debut long-player, Epigram on the Death of a Feeling. The 10-song
collection recalls the verbose bitterness of Leonard Cohen=B9s Songs of Love
and Hate and the restrained tenderness of early Wilco as well as Paul
Westerberg=B9s aggressive melodicism. Recorded primarily in Williamsburg,
Brooklyn with Mark Ospovat (Wooden Wand, Dufus), the album features an
assortment of Chris=B9 past and present musical comrades. Soon after the
record=B9s release, Chris will embark on full-scale tours of the U.S.A. and
Europe.

The Leader rock out with the dynamic grace of two sonic gymnasts. Careening
through a thousand time signatures and pop genres, bassist Julie DeLano and
drummer Sam Lazzara reign supreme over the low end, with suspenseful
rhythmic patterns beneath wickedly clever melodies and lyrics. It would be
math rock if it weren't so soulful.

Yup, tends to do best in places we've occupied (though Germany was
curiously resistent). Like cricket, which doesn't get much beyond the
former British Empire.

Will we someday see a franchise in Baghdad?

Ok, so I <glumly> withdraw baseball (rounders) from The List Of Parochials.

(Teach me to generalise based on Western European culture and the sports
pages of the Virginia Pilot.)

But I notice nobody's leapt to universalise American football.

In the ranks of the semiotics of mayhem, shinty has to rank high, but.

Or is that too too parochially Scottish?

Robin

[Is there an either/or between baseball and cricket?  The later in England,
India, Pakistan, Australia, the former ...  Or do they play both in the West
Indies, Hal?
