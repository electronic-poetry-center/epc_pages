I'd forgotten about that  -- the only parallel I can think of is David

twenties.

            And that's not in the same league.

Well, I'm OK with English variants in AS and even (more so)
Langland/Chaucer/the Gawain Poet, but after that, it all sounds to me a mush

I *don't* have a phobia about Edinburgh -- it's simply a +fact+ that
Edinburgh folks (especially the ones from Morningside) are animals who eat
their living young.

Robert Garrioch -- but other than THAT!!!!

The Flooding


Flooding, everything out of control. Nunberg's patient got sick while
there's been a hurricane, flooding in the building, flooding with a huge
quantity of useless posts, or organs, flooding me with names; still, you
control my body and it's the result of space flooding me, space
everywhere, even in the confines of storms of light glinting from years
ago, star-swarms flooding the sky abject, always melting, flooding one
with iridescent lightness, the flux symbolic, not the development of
simulacra, but the flooding of the regions of the world.

Beyond memory is the disgust of the everyday, _flattened real_ flooding
your panties, liquid running through the theater, anonymous members, but
the _rain of number,_ statistics for its own sake, cancers flooding the
body in part or in full, tumors attacking me. Masturbation makes the time
fly, flooding the lower accesses - flooding in distant wavelets, solitons,
turbulent steady-states, flooding the world with my murmuring.

Defuge/flooding, cyberspace falters and topples in the sand/granularity of
organs, flooding me with names; still, you control my body and it's turned
the matrix of the Net. Thinking is thinning, word-flooding, programming,
flooding out across the semantic plateaus of participants' time as well,
timeless and flooding, and confusing to God. She said

" _floating/drowning_ Jennifer, or a _swimming/cresting,_ or a _flooding/
suck sexthing is acid hole flooding impossibility where suck /sexthing is
layers which extend above and below code."

The text itself is flooding, dissolutions of beings, flooding me, I
swallow all living and non-living, back and back, flooding the world. The
world is all that is contradicted by the presence of language flooding our
world; in fact, missives, missions, missionaries - unceasing flooding of
lapped shores other people jammed into open connections. So think through
the backdropping, flooding, of communication and you say,

"& soon those memories flooding, that inert event, that signature,
flooding lands with waters and delights. In this fair world, less than
that hard sounds, flooding of pulse and body memories - connection is
rough - packets suddenly flooding through, then apparently dead. Energy
flooding establishes channels. The world is alan-swallowing, surrounded by
red-brown floodings, clots, membraned flooding of words by names..."

Liquid air, radio in the pulsing air, flooding our bodies, her voice
flooding-room light, softenings considering the next smearing of your
thinking skin. First flooding, my holding is absorbed in my flood
flooding, my offer-proffer to you, my split doll beneath your binding, my
split doll and flood-flooding wiped flooding, through the river more and
more and communalities flooding these very words i write, you read.

Feel these from pure drive of the text, the flooding of hurtling, and
emissions and spews, flows, the flooding of clutter and part-objects - the
damp, flooding of the names, things soaking, specters streamed, brilliant
iridescent wings. Wet-world the first flooding the first runtime beetles -
antenna - just "in case" - flooding of the names, liquid or their burst
eyes flooding us with marrow for thought.

Let me tell you that radiation flooding; consider this, the benefits for
all of us - the end of this secret. Not even valleys flooding or great
storms would make you flooding and fire. Pairs of breeding falcons might
make it. Seagulls come flooding of clutter and a-historicity of the
gathering of accumulations, flooding momentarily within them - stuttering
within and stuttering, "flooding momentarily within them - stuttering
within and stuttering."

I'm afraid of flooding; we've been hit before, spewed and flooding from
the temporary articulation of emission, as the tain of the mirror, fiber
optics, neural-electronic flooding with teraterabyte messagings flooding
up. Imagine these streams flooding America, online or offline, body's
liquidity, flooding or dissolution in the stream of the body's liquidity,
flooding or dissolution in the stream of up. Imagine these streams
flooding America, online or offline, the emotional flooding at the gates
flooding rivers and millions killed. You are living in the bad areas of
the world and flooding of rivers have stories over your century. A world's
end flooding millions and volcanos. Killed. Volcanos. Rivers flooding
millions. Rivers want; your songs are stupid songs - flooding rivers and
millions killed.

MUD. a flood nothing red really on on flooding and blood, smeared with its
flooding from oozed afraid whirlpool. Does not the night beneath the
flooding or flood of food, the flooding none, the symbols of the north,
loop chunnel and dangers of flooding. If flash flooding is observed act
quickly. Move that emotional flooding at the gates. There's been a
hurricane, flooding emissions and spews, flows, the flooding of clutter
and part-objects emissions and spews, flows, the flooding of clutter and
part-objects - emissions and spews, flows, the flooding of clutter and
part-objects - emissions and spews, flows, the flooding of clutter and
part-objects - emissions and spews, flows, the flooding of clutter and
part-objects -

and organs, flooding me with names; still, you control my body and it's
all I reach for in the morning . A lid appears in the sky, heavy with
viscous fluid, coating, flooding the names, soaking of things! My holding
is absorbed in my flood flooding, my offer-proffer to you, my split doll
beneath your binding, my split doll and flood-flooding. Wiped, flooding,
do you mean to me? - And through the river more and more and the matrix of
the net. Thinking is thinning, flooding of words.

Federal prisons increase restrictions

  Posted: December 31, 2004
  by: Brenda Norrell / Indian Country Today

  WINDOW ROCK, Ariz. - Ceremonies for incarcerated American Indian
inmates are facing new restrictions in state and federal prisons, where
most inmates are already forced to hold sweats in dilapidated lodges,
build fires of scrap lumber and burn commercially-processed sage.

  ''The indifference towards our Native men, women and juveniles who are
incarcerated must stop and an effort must be made to provide outreach
support because they are coming home someday. Our people are not
expendable,'' said Lenny Foster, Navajo spiritual advisor to Indian
inmates for 24 years.

  ''The trend within the past several years throughout the United States
prison system has been to restrict the traditional spiritual practices
of the Native prisoners.''

  Foster, program supervisor and spiritual advisor with the Corrections
Project of the Navajo Nation Department of Behavioral Health Services,
provides spiritual counseling and advocacy for 2,000 Navajo and other
American Indian inmates in 96 state and federal penitentiaries.

  Nationwide, the current trend of prison officials is to limit the
amount of time Indian prisoners can participate in sweat lodge
ceremonies, pipe ceremonies, talking circles, spiritual gatherings and
drum practice. By reducing the time for ceremonies, prison officials are
limiting the rehabilitative effects for inmates.

  ''At one time these practices were allowed six to eight hours on a
given day, usually a weekend, where the Native population could fully
participate without any interference, harassment or indifference,''
Foster said.

  ''To rush through a ceremony does not allow full expression or
participation because these ceremonies are very sacred.''

  The Leonard Peltier Defense Committee said the warden at Leavenworth
Penitentiary, where Peltier is incarcerated, imposed new restrictions on
the religious ceremonies of American Indian prisoners.

  Until recently, Peltier and other prisoners were permitted eight hours
per week for the Inipi (sweat ceremony). The warden has now reduced the
time to four hours per week.

  ''This infringement is both illegal and unconstitutional,'' said the
Defense Committee. Although the prison claims the wood supply for
ceremonies is depleted and needs to be rationed, supporters said the
wood provided is scrap wood, regardless of supply.

  Foster said he would contact the head chaplain for approval to deliver
firewood and lava rocks from the Navajo Nation for the sweat lodge at
USP-Leavenworth after the holidays. Meanwhile, the Defense Committee
urged advocates to call and write Warden E.J. Gallegos.

  At the prison complex in Florence, located between Phoenix and Tucson,
Indian inmates struggle to hold sweat lodge ceremonies.

  ''The wood that was brought was from wooden pallets, or from stinky
trees cut down in the yard; they weren't like mesquite, they would give
you a headache,'' one Indian inmate incarcerated in the Arizona state
prison at Florence told Indian Country Today.

  ''The sage was processed and had to be bought at the prison store. It
didn't even smell like sage. The sweat lodge was so old, it was covered
with an old army tarp and we had to dig the sweat lodge deeper so people
could get in there.

  ''That's all we had; we had to make our drum out of a tin can.

  ''I went, but I didn't get anything out of it.''

  When the ceremonies are held in the traditional and sacred way,
however, Indian inmates receive beneficial rehabilitation, Foster said.

  ''All of these traditional practices and beliefs are very important for
the rehabilitation of the Native prisoner, or else the incarceration
becomes nothing more than warehousing.''

  When American Indian inmates are merely warehoused, Foster said no
change results in the prisoners' behavior and lifestyle. There is no
increase of respect or true restoration to sobriety. Rehabilitation is
vital because Natives return home to their community and family and
should not be a burden or problem.

  Prison systems need new regulations to allow Indian inmates to exercise
their fundamental freedom of religious rights protected by law.
Prisoners need the purity of sacred items, adequate time for prayers and
authentic medicine men to conduct ceremonies, advocates say.

  ''It places a burden on the Native prisoner to obtain his own firewood,
lava rocks, sage, cedar, tobacco and other sacred items,'' Foster said.

  ''The Chaplain's religious services provide Bibles, rosary and chapel
for Christian inmates, and Islamic and Jewish inmates have their support
from their respective outside community.''

  However, Indian nations have an obligation to assist their incarcerated
tribal members with sacred items that are necessary for the sweat lodge
ceremonies and pipe ceremonies. Sometimes, Indian nations do not respond
and neither do the family and friends of inmates.

  ''It has become vital and essential to have American Indian spiritual
leaders and medicine persons visit the prisons and provide the necessary
instructions and conduct and facilitate the ceremonies, circles and
gatherings,'' Foster said.

WARS FOR THE WHITE NATION

<mailto:montfu65@hotmail.com>

    Some thinkers believe that Americans were perhaps too stupid to see
    past the Administration's smokescreen for the War on Iraq. I am not
    so convinced. I think many people simply didn't care. Where, as
    here, the 'enemy' were nonwhite Arabs, and mostly, folks of an alien
    faith, it was easy to project them as fair game -- even if Iraq
    actually hadn't a thing to do with 9/11.

WARS FOR THE WHITE NATION
============================
[Col. Writ. 11/28/04) Copyright 2004 Mumia Abu-Jamal

We Americans claim to be a peace-loving people. We hate
bloodshed; we are opposed to violence. Yet we go into
spasms of joy over the possibility of projecting dynamite
bombs from flying machines upon helpless citizens ...
Yet our hearts swell with pride at the thought that America
is becoming the most powerful nation on earth, and that
it will eventually plant her iron foot on the necks of all
other nations. -- Emma Goldman, Radical Emigrant & Activist
"Patriotism: A Menace to Liberty" (1908) (Fr. Howard
Zinn & Anthony Arnove, *Voices of a People's History of
the United States* (N.Y.: Seven Stories Press, 2004), p. 271]

In light of the recent election, these coming four years promise to
be ones of continuing war. Nor will it end, no matter who is elected
in 2008. That's because the major allegedly opposition party, given
its deep corporate funding, will not dare to truly oppose the
Administration. They fear being targeted as 'unpatriotic,' or, even
worse, 'soft on terrorism.'

That's because, they know, at some level, that millions of Americans
rally to the martial strains of war. Even a 'bad war.' Even one based
upon false pretenses. Even one based upon that most ulterior of
motives -- greed.

Some thinkers believe that Americans were perhaps too stupid
to see past the Administration's smokescreen for the War on Iraq.
I am not so convinced. I think many people simply didn't care.

Where, as here, the 'enemy' were nonwhite Arabs, and mostly,
folks of an alien faith, it was easy to project them as fair game --
even if Iraq actually hadn't a thing to do with 9/11.

There's simply something about the allure of war, that writer
and social critic, Randolph Bourne, put quite nicely, in his 1918
essay, "The State":

War is the health of the State. It automatically sets in
motion throughout society those irresistible forces for
uniformity, for passionate cooperation with the Government
in coercing into obedience the minority groups and
individuals which lack the larger herd sense. The
machinery of government sets and enforces the drastic
penalties; the minorities are either intimidated into
silence, or brought slowly around by a subtle process
of persuasion which may seem really to be converting
them. [From Zinn & Arnove, *Voices of a People's
History ...*, p. 299.]

War, Bourne explains, creates such wrenching social divisions,
that fellow citizens often turn on fellow citizens, with one side,
usually the pro-war side, demeaning the other, antiwar side,
as traitors to the nation -- as if the nation is the political
leadership!

While Bourne was describing the events around World War
I, his insights reflect our present, under the power of this
"wartime... uniformity of feeling" [p. 299].

Bourne tells us:

Not for any religious impulse could the American nation have
been expected to show such devotion en masse, such
sacrifice and labor. Certainly not for any secular good,
such as universal education or the subjugation of nature,
would it have poured forth its treasure and its life, or
would it have permitted such stern coercive measures to be
taken against it, such as conscripting its money and its men.
But for the sake of a war of offensive self-defense,
undertaken to support a difficult cause to the slogan of
"democracy," it would reach the highest level ever known
of collective effort .... [p. 300].

We are conditioned to, for the most part, quietly accept it;
to not rock the boat; to go with the flow.

Yet it's also true that Americans, by their millions, all across
the country, came out to oppose the war -- before a shot was
fired!

Perhaps it reflects a deep-seated distrust of political promises
and claims to justify wars. Certainly, American presidents
throughout the 20th century, have given people enough reason
to be skeptical. Perhaps they came from families where men
returned, in shattered bodies, or fractured minds, from glorious
wars past. Perhaps people simply knew that *this* war had
nothing to do with *that* war.

It is a good start, and would've been far better if people really
continued to protest, in great numbers, throughout the election
year. But, of course, this didn't happen. But people learn,
especially if the lesson is a painful one. Perhaps, in the future,
they will not stop, until they force the politicians to hear them.

For some reason, this reminds me of a rather sad slogan kicking around the
UK in the sixties.

            Join the army.
                    Meet interesting people.
                                Kill them.

Although I'm not sure whether the Shylock speech alludes to the 'baser human
attributes' I do agree with you that WS and his audience would not have
known much about Jews, however, one does have to add a proviso that London,
unlike the rest of England, had long been host to immigrant communities
<snip>

What about the Lopez case? Roderigo Lopez had been Elizabeth I's physician.
In the early 1590s he was charged with attempting to poison her a few years
before. So the idea of a *Jew* on trial was very much in the air.

As to moneylending, the Venice setting was scarcely local colour. Venice was
as replete witb Jewish lenders (in conflict with non Jewish *monti di
pieta* )as it was with merchants. Indeed the term 'ghetto' (< Venetian
dialect for foundry) comes from the confining of Venice's 'Jews' (the
definition varied) to the Corte de Case in 1516.

I saw that on a BBC programme by a British historian - my friend has his
book  - which was many episodes and very good - but to be fair or unfair
there were fewer instances of that sort of thing in England I think (my
history isn't good so I stand to be corrected there) than say Russia and
also it was the actions of a one King who ran out of money - an act which
wasn't necessarily supported by the British people or done by other Kings -
I think people pick up all sorts of prejudices - I that know as a boy we
would see movies - in those movies in the 50s the American cavalry were
always cheered when they came (at the last minute -" da dah da dah!!") to
rescue the settlers besieged by the Indians and then in war movies the
Germans were ALWAYs bad - very little about the Holocaust - we loved war
movies ( a child doesn't feel the pain of war - its all just "bang bang ,
you're dead!"  and "To Hell and Back and The Battle of the River Plate and
then in Korea the US pilots would always get the evil Chinese/Koreans or
whoever they were in their MIGS (never a match for the US planes) to us they
(the Korean pilots) were strange and sinister looking people with slant eyes
who never smiled  and so on - now that was the kind of accumulated affect of
war movies and also the National Geographic that my father got always showed
the US as a marvellous place - which in many ways it  - corn every where -
huge bridges and so on - the English were always the goodies and the tommies
were cheerful - some of this was true ( a little) (Vonnegut satirises the
cheerful English in Slaughter House 5) - and indeed my English grandmother
and my mother and even my grandfather from England were very good and gentle
people - but as a boy I was told that the Germans killed people but the
English were kind. Now some of that was true!

The Goon Show of course poked fun a lot of the idiocy of war and so on..

 Later we learnt about the Holocaust and read The Diary of Anne Frank (and
read the Merchant of Venice) - but  those early years burn ideas (right or
wrong) into one's mind/psyche  and also I recall that women were never in my
mind of significance - women were decorative and didn't do heroic things
like men - they didn't go to war or have adventures (like Biggles) or invent
things - of course that was a child's/pre adolescent's view and that
prejudice in some ways is "embedded" as they say nowadays -- of course now I
know for example the stories of the many women pilots at that time and read
recently a book about  Madame Curie  - but films and so on - we didn't have
TV - mostly reinforced that the British and Americans - who were Britains
with an accent  but also still good guys - were superior and that Arabs and
blacks were - while they had good old ways were incompetent and backward -
that was the effect on my mind. That is in the early years - now that meant
that people generally (because of the accumulated effect of the 50s
"propaganda" (which modified as time went by and became more
sophisticated) - thought of people in the other worlds or who were "over
there" who were black or had robes on or covered there faces - were more or
less inferior (thus it's easy to bomb places like Iraq and wipe out 20,000
people  - those people are backward and they are "bad" - of course as I
started reading more and films changed in the 70s I gradually became more
enlightened but those old feelings / ideas stay -one film that kind of
counteracted that was Lawrence of Arabia but I think most things I read or
saw in regard to Jews were positive - Israel was being promoted as a  heroic
and pioneering place  (it became useful to the US and British Imperialists
ands Egypt etc had been useful and Saudi Arabia now is) - I remember reading
a book by Leon Uris - but as  teenager I began questioning these things (the
Israelis we now know committed some terrible crimes of their own against the
Palestinians)...as I had no religion and so on it was easier but those
initial images ideas stay in my mind to haunt me - or they a part of what I
am: that's why it is easy now for the US to generate fear and hatred of
Arabs etc (Moslems - whatever - more so than hatred of Jews) Moslems have
replaced Jews or Communists as the Pariahs - its the accumulated effect of
propaganda over many years via movies and TV etc  The American Imperialists
are a little more sophisticated in their attempts to exterminate Arabs than
the Nazis but by and large the aims of the US Military - Industrial plexus
is control or destruction of those peoples, and control of oil reserves, the
drug trade and so on: if protests are made about Abu Grahib etc they know
nothing much will be done about anything - the killing goes on. The only
people who are doing anything in any significant way are the freedom
fighters in Iraq and Afghanistan and etc.   Hatred of Moslems and Arabs is a
far more powerful prejudice nowadays than anti-Semitism and much more useful
to the aggressor nations Britain and the US etc

It is a dangerous thing to rank forms of prejudice, which is not the same
thing as ranking how different groups are treated at any particular moment
in history and clearly Arabs and Muslims are getting more of a raw deal now
in at least some parts of the world than are Jews. Still, it is important to
resist the temptation to hierarchize hatreds; it only leads to divisiveness
and helps the divide and conquer strategy that those with an interest in the
status quo deploy over and over again, and at just about any stage of
history, so effectively.

"I don't care what William Blake says, these are fun!"
     -- Harold Bloom

The Flash Polaroids occupy a middle ground between an experimental film/vid=
eo aesthetic - particularly the works that use the single frame as the unit=
 of composition - and interactive installation video works. The earlier "St=
udies" involve loops of digital photographs taken in "burst mode" - in quic=
k succession - and were partly inspired by David Crawford's Stop Motion Stu=
dies. The "Portraits" involve several views of the same subject in juxtapos=
ition, and could be compared to a Warholian take on the portrait - a moving=
 image that essentially sits still, or a still image that moves only slight=
ly over time. The "Micro-narratives" introduce "stories" to the Flash Polar=
oids, especially "Guy Cat Pan," which, like a metaphysical painting of De C=
hirico's, gets its charge by placing disparate, enigmatic objects on the sa=
me stage. The "Interactive" set pushes outward toward the user, and demonst=
rate what could be done with this simple use of Flash and digital photograp=
hs as projections in an installation setting.=20

I can't find the specific post, but somebody recently suggested that the  in
ternet (blogs, homepages, websites, e-publishing, etc.) vs. traditional
publication offers writers opportunity to continuously revise  & improve their
works. Of course this opens the old argument  between spontaneity and craft, etc.
Personally I prefer a synthesis, since it's  rare that a spontaneous piece
can't be improved or that continuous revision  might kill it. I'm humble and
hopeful enough that my unique blend of  poetry, philosophy & science will evolve.
And so I offer my older website,  "The Path of Mary DesJardins" and my new
homepage, "Breasts, Bagpipes &  Cosmology".

Ian

I am flattered. It fits with my theory that there are no "perfect " poems
just variations of language etc  (Hence your poem is thus a new poem and
yours).

But if you publish that I would like it if you acknowledged the source ( I
wouldnt worry if I didnt know ) but of course you dont have to - I do
excactly what you are doing - although what I wrote in thsi case was not -
doesn't have much that was "stolen" although there are some "references" to
Keats etc

Your art work was excellent btw.

Hope you are enjoying the Xams/New Year season

Regards, Richard.

>DAILY NEWS STAFF WRITER
>Monday, January 3rd, 2005
>
>Shirley Chisholm, the beloved political pioneer from Brooklyn who
>became the first black woman elected to Congress, died yesterday in
>Florida. She was 80.
>Chisholm was best known for her historic 1972 run for President
>under the slogan "Unbought and Unbossed," her fiery oratory and her
>commitment to women,
>minorities and the disadvantaged.
>
>"She was an activist, and she never stopped fighting," the Rev.
>Jesse Jackson said last night. "She refused to accept the ordinary."
>
>Mayor Ed Koch, who served in the House of Representatives with
>Chisholm, called her a "wonderful woman with enormous courage" and
>uncompromising
>integrity.
>
>"We all go, but it's wonderful when you can leave with a name that
>unblemished," Koch said.
>
>Chisholm was born to West Indian immigrants on Nov. 30, 1924, in
>Brooklyn, but spent her early childhood with her grandmother in
>Barbados.
>
>Rejoining her parents in New York, she threw her energies into
>education. She graduated from Brooklyn College, became a
>nursery-school teacher in Harlem and
>later earned a master's degree from Columbia University.

>From an early age, she thought of herself as a "fighter" - a quality
>she shared with her three role models: her grandmother, Harriet
>Tubman and Eleanor
>Roosevelt.
>
>"I met Mrs. Roosevelt when I was 14," she said in 2000. "I'll never
>forget what she said to me: You are black and you are a young woman,
>but don't let anybody stand in your way."
>
>She took Mrs. Roosevelt's advice seriously, and parlayed her work as
>a grass-roots community organizer into a landslide victory for a New
>York State Assembly Seat in 1964.
>
>Four years later, she made history when she won a seat in Congress,
>where she hired an all-female staff and championed issues such as
>federal funding for day care and opposition to the Vietnam War.
>
>A gifted speaker, in her first remarks on the floor of the House in
>1969 she vowed to vote "no" on any bill that included funds for the
>Defense Department.
>
>"My greatest political asset, which professional politicians fear,
>is my mouth, out of which come all kinds of things one shouldn't
>always discuss for
>reasons of political expediency," she once said.
>
>In 1972, Chisholm set her sights on the White House, making a bid
>for the Democratic nomination for President despite what she
>acknowledged were "hopeless odds."
>
>"I ran because somebody had to do it first," she wrote in her 1973
>book "The Good Fight."
>
>She lost the nomination to George McGovern but got 151 delegate
>votes and returned to Congress with newfound prominence.
>
>After she retired from government in 1982, she remained active in
>politics and the women's rights movement. A documentary about her
>presidential bid,
>"Chisholm '72," was released last year.
>
>She was married twice - her second husband, Arthur Hardwick Jr.,
>died in 1986 - but had no children.
>
>In a book published last year, Chisholm said she hoped her legacy
>went beyond her race and gender.
>
>"I want history to remember me not just as the first black woman to
>be elected to Congress, not as the first black woman to have made a
>bid for the
>presidency of the United States, but as a black woman who lived in

I am compound, I am ready to be touched.
Echo persuades us, a knuckle in the face
can be good had we been granted the language
of rebellion. Stop looking at me like that!
Your temperate is my permanent, retrofitting
extreme makeovers. A towering story sucks
everything in, I'll ask you to lose the book now.
Inter alia buys another year. Dear sir, your
portrait on my wall. Then there was a bell.
The sun amazes an anesthesiologist, pebbles
and clowns, I went as one and came back as two.
The weight of genealogy and blood, turbines,
process, hot things, the free movement of
tense, what the rationalists call a camera. Loafed
through the hoopla, I am yeast. This is a very
private season, iota claw ass of fine dawn.
Making something means eating something,
in its absence it changed names. He often
dreamt of trains, the sun in perfect effigy of
itself (so the platinum DVD says). The truth is
hidden in a veil of tears. At the noon of your
vanishing, you bombed my parade. Status flying
in the breeze, finally the walls simply open.
Could I write this in language? The moment here
is later. Where should this one go, over there.
I buy small pieces, a heavy schedule of opera
at picnics. To rewrite this as a diary of weather.

The Auroville Tsunami Rehabilitation Effort

The first wave of the Tsunami hit the Pondicherry and Tamil Nadu coast
at 8 AM on 26th December 2005. Seven thousand people died on the spot.

By 9:30 AM, a team from Auroville, the international township, which is
situated near Pondicherry, swung into action. A first emergency meeting
was called in the house of two Aurovilians and it was immediately
decided to set-up a camp for the persons affected by the tidal waves.
By 12 am, eight tents and seven shamianas (awnings), donated by the
children of Auroville (who use them for their annual summer camps) were
erected on a field near one of the Auroville communities. Two portable
5000 liter tanks, two generators, a field kitchen with four cooking
ranges, eight ladies and four cooks were straight away put into
service.

Three of Auroville's load carriers, two tractors and two buses to pick
up refugees were also commissioned. The camp was manned by more than
sixty Tamil youths from the villages within Auroville, as well as many
Aurovillians from all parts of the world. By 2 PM, 750 people were fed
and 350 food packets distributed. All throughout the afternoon,
refugees kept streaming in and another 1200 people were fed in the
evening. Blankets were arranged as the night was cold and windy. On the
second day, everybody was moved to the Kuilapalayam Trust School, which
is run by Auroville, as rain was threatening. There, the refugees were
spread out in eight buildings as well as two tents and food was
prepared this time for 1400 people, along with another 500 food packets
for distribution. Clothes and blankets were also handed out.

The extent of the disaster was then becoming clear. A quick survey was
done amongst the villages and the Auroville communities that dot the
beach. In Ganagachettikullam, a village of fishermen at the extreme
limit of Pondicherry state, the Auroville team was met by utter
desolation: the mud houses which were the first ones on the beach front
had been totally destroyed, or sometimes washed away. Broken furniture
was lying on the side of the road, TV's beyond repair were nevertheless
put in the sun to dry, pieces of thatched roof were blocking the road,
electrical lines had fallen down, the steps leading to an old stone
temple had also collapsed.

Three days after the catastrophe, women were still wailing, some of
them foaming at the mouth, out of sheer desolation. On the beach, the
team met Ranjani, a pretty girl of 18. That fateful morning of the
26th, her mother and father had gone to the market to sell the fish
caught in the early morning and she was left alone with her little
sister of 3 years, Anusuya. She was cooking the morning's meal, when
suddenly her sister ran to her and clung to her shirt. Ranjani looked
up and saw a huge wave advancing towards the house. "I climbed on a
stool and as water reached my shoulders, I clung on a rafter from the
roof with one hand, while holding my little screaming sister with the
other, she recalled sobbing. After a few minutes my hands went numb and
suddenly I saw that my sister had disappeared". Ranjani cried and cried
for help, but nobody came. Anusuya was found dead a few hours later,
one kilometer upstream in the village which has been totally flooded.
26 other people, mostly children and elderly persons, lost their lives.
75 houses were totally destroyed and 265 families affected one way or
the other by the Tsunami which hit Ganagashetikkam.

Next to Ganagachettikullam, one finds Eternity, an Auroville beach
community. There lives a wonderful family: Yuval the father is an
Israeli, his wife Hannah is from Holland with five kids, all raised in
Auroville, each of them speaking several languages. Yuval and his
family moved in 20 years ago on this piece of barren land on the beach
where nothing grew. With hard work and dedication, they turned it in a
green forest, a place of beauty and peace. They also painstakingly
built houses in the community, mostly using local material: mud walls,
Palmyra leaves, thatch roofs, with one solitary high hard concrete
house. On that fateful morning of the 26th, Hannah had one of her
daughters with her, Jitta. Jitta has two children: a daughter of two
years and a son who is barely eight months old. As usual in Auroville,
where everybody sleeps early, everyone woke-up at 6 Am for an early
morning tea in the community kitchen. At 6.30 AM, Yuval felt the earth
shake and jokingly asked his wife 'if she was dancing on the bed". At
8.15 Am, Jetta decided to put back her son to sleep on the ground floor
of a house which was 200 meters away.

Everything looked so peaceful and no different than a thousand other
mornings in Eternity beach community. But suddenly Hannah heard a noise
that sounded like the rushing of water. She went outside "I saw this
huge wave rushing toward me and it immediately it flashed in my mind:
'Tidal Wave'". She grabbed her granddaughter, climbed on the first
floor and shouted at her daughter to go and get her son in the nearby
hut. Jitta ran as the water was already swirling around her, managed to
get her baby just as he was being swept away, shouted at two guest who
were sleeping in another hut - and would have otherwise died - and
seeing that there was no way to go back where her mother was, ran
towards a higher ground on the opposite side of Eternity. After ten
minutes, Yuval and Hannah saw no sign of Jitta and her son and thought
they had died. "We screamed and screamed and scanned every part of the
community, while water was still rising", Hannah recalls, still
sobbing. When the second wave receded, they were able to find their
daughter and grandchild -a-l-i-v-e-.

Today Yuval and Hannah have lost everything and are painstakingly
trying to salvage some of their personal belongings, thanks to an
amazing wave of solidarity amongst Aurovillians and a lot of help from
the nearby village. "I put so much work in this land and God took
everything back, but he spared our lives and that is a miracle", says
Hannah. But like the inhabitants of Ganagachettikullam, their lives
have been shattered and Hannah still breaks down from time to time when
she recalls the time when she thought her daughter and grandson were
both dead, taken away by the terrible Tsunami waves.

By the fourth day, it became clear to Aurovilians that they had to
shift from immediate relief measures to long term solutions for the
affected villages. Hemant and Jos were appointed as main coordinators,
with teams for Office and administration, Financial management,
Communication, Sourcing and Purchase, Village Relief Coordination,
Auroville Relief coordination:. Government Liaison. An office has been
opened equipped with computers, telephones and internet as well as
ample storage space for goods for the next phase of the rehabilitation.


The two teams from the Village Coordination group went for the first
assessment of the damage to nine coastal villages around Auroville in
Villupuram district. It was found that a total of approximately five
hundred houses have been destroyed and 62 deaths registered. It also
became clear that the first basic relief : rice, clothing and 2000Rs
cash, had already been given by the Government. What people now needed
is to gather their life together. Most of the villagers wanted
household utensils, metal trunks, clothing, blankets and notebooks for
school children. The longer term concerns were housing and fishing nets
and boats for livelihood. Suryangandhi reported how grateful people
felt towards Auroville for their timely help in this moment of crisis.
The next steps are to build a data-base for needs of all the affected
families and set-up a system of distribution. All this would need allot
of men, material and money.

Transparency has been ensured by creating an accounting team and
channeling funds through two new created accounts in the existing
Financial infrastructure of Auroville which offers tax rebate and
foreign donations facility. "What we need, one of the members of the
team said, is more funds than goods in kind, specially from the West,
as it has been shown in the past that grain can rot in storage, long
before it is distributed and that most villagers using firewood to
cook, western food stuff and utensils are often not compatible.
However, blankets, tents and trunks are welcome". Another member of
Auroville's Rehabilitation team emphasized: "that this is a catastrophe
of unparalleled dimensions, specially after the warning of the 30th
December noon, which sent again thousands of people from the coastal
area of Tamil Nadu towards higher and safer grounds. We invite the
world community to extend their generous support to rebuild the
shattered lives torn by natures fury". And he adds: "if we receive
sufficient funds, we will not only look after the rebuilding of the 12
coastal villages we have taken charge off, but we will include all
those reaching up to Marakkanam (40 kms North of Pondicherry) "!

Dear Prof Simon,

Thankyou for your positive response. Here is a letter I wrote to some
other concerned persons.

There are at least the following ways you could help.

1. Share this email with other persons who you belive would like to
become involved.

2. Make a personal financial contribution that is tax deductible.

The check should be made out to The Thoreau Group. The memo line line
should read Andaman Island Tsunami Relief. The check should be sent to
Dr. L. Harvey Poe, Jr. Suite 514, Watergate, 2600 Virginia Avenue N.W.
Washington DC 20037. Dr. Poe is a lawyer and a Rhodes scholar who will
provide a receipt for tax purposes. The Thoreau Group was set up by me
and others in 2001 to serve the India earthquake victims in 2001.

3. Identify companies or persons associated with companies who may
provide the following: Medicines, food, water purifying equipment,
fishing net and fishing boats, video and photo documentation equipment
and supplies, tropical food growing resources etc.

I am trying to make an advisory group of professors who god willing
will oversee this effort. Everything is happening all at once and i
would be happy to keep you abreast.
regards
Bapa Jhala

Apparently the two chief contenders for California's new poet laureate are
(get ready)
Michael McClure & Merle Haggard

If it is limited to these two, I suspect the Governor will choose Michael,
whose body - now at 70 or so! - is still so much better taken care of than
the ravaged one of  'poor' Merle.

At worst, to get the job, I suspect, Michael will have to agree to pose
lifting barbells with Arnie. Not to sound too cynical, I don't think poetry
has too much to do with the job or with the Governor's headset. Though I
think it would be nice for Michael and possibly bringing his good sense of
ecological interests to the fore. And maybe some poems.

But, Merle. A great songwriter and singer, I'd love to see him enshrined
somewhere in the heart and soul of this state - the Central Valley would not
be there without him, nor would there be that deep, dark bruised Okie voice.
Merle as Laureate - I suspect -would be too close to a truth that Arnie &
kind arent gonna touch with a ten foot pole.

While the question of California's "race" for poet laureate is humerous,
stranger than fiction, it does evoke some points about the role of poet in American society, circa 2004, as well as what the postion of laureate means.
The political lynching of Amiri Baraka last year negates the import and seriousness of the laureate position. What happened to Baraka clarifies that the position, regardless if it is a local  or even the national poet laureate, is nothing more than a political shill for a corrupt government.
The fact that the head architect of Baraka's ouster as poet laureate, Governor Jim McGreevey of New Jersey, was forced to resign in shame amidst an unrelated political scandal after Baraka's dismissal, proves my point further.
The thing with Baraka was that there really wasn't an outcry from poetry circles that what happened to him was just another example of hegemony and censorship rearing its ugly heads.
Obviously, "Somebody Blew Up America" offended the sensibilities of many people. But for that very reason, because as a poem it did stir, illicit and offend, it should have been defended especially by those poets who vehemently disagreed with its content.
What made the matter worse is that many of those who let Baraka down were poets who once thought he was fad.
Specific to the matter of California, then, it is deeper than just the question of a respected poet such as McClure vying against a country music singer- Haggard.
The question is that as poets if we agree that there is a general "corruption of the soul" in American politics- regarding domestic and state issues- as well as foreign policy issues, than do we really want the approval, the sanction, and alas the blessing of that same government?
Somebody on this list recently asked- where was our Ahkmotova, our Neruda, our Lorca?....
That's the point then: when we ask where that poet is, where that engaged and conscious poet is, we should answer that that that poet is us.
Who is Spartacus?
I am Spartacus and so on.....

to deny that creativity can stop disasters
is the  soft bigotry of low expectation
and licks the boots of cruel masters
human perspective sighs with exhaustion at
the effect of simple size on different failure  prediction methods
underestimating the ability to

think bigger by thinking smaller
there is no one to pray to
only say to yourself
there is a better way to
keep trying or admit
that all is futile

Ian is doing some brilliant work and his art work is fascinating - someone
on here should help him into his first book - well perhaps "should' is not
the word  - but it would be good.

The advice below is good by the looks though.

I agree with the pen knife.  but, i'd just as soon use MS Publisher.  InDesign is great, but it needs a plug in to make the chapbook work.  and that is more money.

You could just ask them to shrink it at kinkos or any printer. they can make two pages fit into one, like a chapbook.  Just make it 15% bigger.  That's a cheaper option.

MS Publisher will eventually encounter the compatibility problem that
mIEKAL referred to, but has the advantage that many people own it
without realizing it, as it is on the second disc of Microsoft Office.
In any case, you should make a hardcopy master of anything you do.

It doesn't do anything Word can't -- Word can also create chapbooks.
Publisher walks you through the relevant features, though. Word assumes
some background in layout.

On a Mac the booklet plugin runs for a 30 day trial.  You can deinstall
& reinstall ad nauseum.  An easier way, especially for chapbooks is
just to design the master in signatures, no plugins or page shuffling
needed.  Or another way which Xexoxial used for years is to output
individual pages in whatever program & physically paste-up the
printouts of each page into corresponding signatures.  If yr using a
copier to print, this can produce very clean results.

One of the other bonuses with InDesign is it interfaces nicely with
Acrobat & you can generate the pdf ebook version of any design easily,

that's a chapbook too; and as some type has to be upside down, Miekel's
solution is often the best and not just for that

that aside

I could never get on with MS Publisher; using it is worse than turning a
double mattress with your hands in your pockets. MS Word or something
similar will do it all.

There are a number of free utilities around for putting 2 pages on to one;
that helps because it saves having to work out column widths along with
margins

Presently, I am using a routine that came with the printer, HP Business Jet
1100 it's called here.

Auto duplex which unfortunately does not allow one to modify the drying
pause so very large type and graphics get smeared. Back to manual duplex.

I bought HP because they don't break. It just broke. And I am dealing with
HP employees dealing with Brain Tippex, an incurable condition which leaves
the victim entirely happy and everyone they meet frustrated (Tippex is
erasing fluid)

The HP routine will take any number of pages and make a book, either as
master or as one of a short run. One has to tamper with the margins to get
the positioning right. Which is a pain because it is supposed to  have been
built by persons of intelligence; but once done the principle applies to all
jobs. And one has to make sure that the page numbers are divisible by 4 or
pad with blank pages - otherwise it goes ahead and makes the booklet anyway
and runs out of material...

It's good to have the basic pagination schematised

eg a double page for folding will have 24 on the left and 1 on the right
and that back on to a double page with 2 on the left and 23 on the right

24 / 1
2 / 23

22 / 3
4 / 21

etc

Once you've got that sorted, you do whatever you want either mastering or
printing directly depending on the flexibility of your hardware and software

Mime-Version: 1.0

Hi, this query is for a friend, Peter Werbe, whose piece for
Detroit's weekly Metro Times is posted below. I'd like to find folks
in BC who may know Van Newkirk, or anyone in Nova Scotia who knew him
in the days of "root, branch, and mammal" (in some manner associated
with the journal IO and, evntually, the press North Atlantic
Books--but this is all unclear and of course those people are simply
people who may have known him) And of course there is the famous
incident at St. Mark's church, described in the piece here.

Any help filling in any of this, or finding contacts who can, would
be much appreciated.

Please back-channel as I'm a web-based reader of poetics list these days.

Best,

Joel








Old rebels never die, they, well. . .just stick up Toys 'R Us stores.
Allen Van Newkirk, who played a seminal role in the 1960s radical and
experimental cultural scene in Detroit, was arrested following a
December 12 robbery and subsequent shoot-out with Mounties in a
Vancouver, BC suburb.
According to Constable Dave Babineau, media liaison for the Port
Coquitlam, BC section of the Royal Mounted Canadian Police (RCMP),
officers responded to a report of an armed hold-up at the suburban
toy store by a lone male who drove off in a van. Following a short
chase, the vehicle and a police car collided, and the 64-year-old Van
Newkirk, exited from behind the wheel with gun blazing.
Van Newkirk was wounded in an exchange of gunfire with police, and is
charged with two counts of attempted murder, robbery and related
offenses. Babineau described the wounds as "non-life threatening,"
and Jennifer Saltman, staff reporter for the twice weekly Coquitlam
Now, said the defendant was walking under his own power at a December
28 Port Coquitlam Provincial Court hearing.
Neither the toy store management nor Constable Babineau would
officially release a dollar figure for the heist, but a store
employee offered that it "was in the thousands."
Many Detroiters remember Van Newkirk as a pistol-packing,
motorcycle-riding, early advocate of Surrealist, Dadaist and
Situationist ideas, who published broadside posters entitled,
Guerrilla: Free Newspaper of the Streets, featuring huge headlines
proclaiming such provocations as, "Poetry Demands Unemployment."
John Sinclair, who now hosts an Amsterdam-based jazz and blues show
available at johnsinclairradio.com, was a founder of the 1960s Artist
Workshop and originally a co-editor with Van Newkirk of Guerrilla. He
says, "The Surrealists were his big inspiration, and if sticking up
Toys 'R Us isn't a surreal act, I don't know what is!"
"Having once known Van Newkirk pretty well," he added, "I wonder what
his message was? There has to be some subtext."
Sinclair and Van Newkirk became roommates forty years ago in a Cass
Corridor apartment when they were both attending Wayne State
University in a time and place filled with new ideas about writing
and culture in general. "We were both trying to figure out a way,"
says Sinclair, "to bridge the previous era with the emerging thing
that had to do with reaching illiterate teen-age TV watchers and pop
radio listeners with art and political content through the media of
marijuana, rock & roll and LSD." The two of them, together with
numerous others radical artists, poets, painters and musicians of the
mid- to late-'60s, created such an amazing amount of poetry,
publications, theatre, art, experimental jazz and innovative rock
that it gave the Cass Corridor a world famous reputation for art and
culture.
Van Newkirk, who at an imposing 6'3", often made his opinions known
by thundering down the aisle of radical gatherings denouncing
proceedings as being insufficiently revolutionary. His most notorious
act occurred in 1969, when, incensed by the appearance of Kenneth
Koch, a mainstream poet at a normally alternative reading space, St.
Marks Church, on New York City's Lower East Side, Van Newkirk ran
toward the podium firing a pistol (filled with blanks, but unknown to
the audience), yelling, "Death to bourgeois poets."
Several confederates, including poet, author, and NPR commentator,
Andrei Codrescu, threw copies of the latest Guerrilla into the rows
of startled spectators. According to Codrescu, "Kenneth responded,
without flinching, 'Why don't you just grow up?,' and goes on
reading."
"I was wondering what mischief Van Newkirk was into," Codrescu
remarked upon hearing of his old collaborator's arrest.
Van Newkirk also disrupted a 1969, Madison, Wis. conference convened
by the 125 member Underground Press Syndicate, a federation of
alternative newspapers, by, again, running down the aisle, without
pistol on this occasion, yelling, "All media are lies."
A collage he published in Detroit's underground paper, the Fifth
Estate, denouncing the venerable MC5 rock band as a spectacularized
commodity with only a revolutionary veneer, outraged the band and
Sinclair, who had become their manager. A confrontation with the
hot-tempered MC5 lead guitarist, Wayne Kramer, soured relationships
between the former comrades.
After several editions of his paper appeared, Van Newkirk abruptly
left Detroit in 1970 to set up the Geographic Foundation of the North
Atlantic, an early radical ecological center located in Antigonish,
Nova Scotia and published broadsides and pamphlets under the name of
root, branch, and mammal. He eventually was granted Canadian
permanent resident status and was living in Surry, a Vancouver
suburb, at the time of his arrest.
Van Newkirk's old friends and colleagues say from the early '70s
through the 1980s, his whereabouts and activities were mostly unknown
except for an infrequent late night call or even less frequent visits
to family members in the Detroit area. No one had heard from or about
him in almost 15 years.
Not surprisingly, he failed to turn up in town for the November
Artist's Workshop fortieth anniversary celebration even though he had
been on its board of directors in the '60s. Perhaps it was because of
a lack of desire to cross the border since at his most recent court
hearing it came to light that he was on the lam from assault charges
in Penticton, BC. Previously, he had been convicted in Washington
State for felony larceny in 1990 and disorderly conduct and theft in
1994.
Van Newkirk's posters, which a generation ago sparked outrage and
controversy, now are packed neatly in boxes at the Labadie
Collection, the University of Michigan's famed archive of radical
material, disturbed only by an occasional researcher, while the "free
newspaper of the streets" is selling for $130 a copy at an upscale
San Francisco gallery.
But their author is still bad to the bone; an outlaw to the end.

from my recent experience, the best way to do chapbook production in

REVOLUTION: Speech by Bro. Jamal Hart

     For too long, we have lived with the reality that the many

clearly against us, not for us. Fascism is the controlling party. ...
The enemy's targets are Blacks, other people of color, and proletariats
... This, in turn, will inspire the youth and the elders to collaborate
on this everyday overlooked revolution upon many misinformed people.
When change begins, one's mind will accept true reality and see

abuse of authority, and the vindictiveness of this conniving legal system

REVOLUTION
Speech by Bro. Jamal Hart

Firstly, I would like to humbly greet everyone with the greetings
As-Salaam Alaikum, Hotep, and Peace. One may think, Why Revolution?
Before I enlighten the masses, allow me to give solidarity greetings to
fellow freedom fighters, supporters, comrades and working class folks,
and the masses during this holiday appeal. I sincerely thank the
Partisan Defense Committee for all the endless support and needed
indulgence in the complex matters they assisted in that were very
detrimental on numerous occasions. I humbly thank all of them as well as
the all other supporters and comrades that continue to support political
prisoners on a consistent basis.

For too long, we have lived with the reality that the many
misconceptions and pure deceptions of today's world that we live in is
clearly against us, not for us. Fascism is the controlling party.
Unfortunately, it's underrated within the minds of everyday people. The
enemy's targets are Blacks, other people of color, and proletariats like
you, all of whom have been under capitalistic ruling for far too long.

Comrades, the reason for this rude awakening of clear hypocrisy that has
deviously and shrewdly been placed here for ethnic and racial division
against the oppressed is the Government's ruse of depriving our natural
birthrights and diminish our sense of struggle.

To close our eyes and minds from revolution misguiding us to believe the
struggle is over is what the ruling class would have you to believe.
They want you to forget the rebellions of the past century. Forgetting
comrades like Cinque of Amistad, George of Soledad, Dhoruba of the
Panther 19, Black August, the MOVE 9 of Powelton Village, Red Summer,
John Africa and the MOVE children of Osage Avenue, Chairman Fred Hampton
and Lil' Bobby Hutton of the Black Panther Party, Malcolm, Nat Turner,
Dedan Kimathi of Kenya and my father Mumia Abu-Jamal. All of these
people have participated with many other comrades known and unknown to
keep revolution alive among the people. This revolution was not just a
bunch of speeches. It was about action, unity, devotion, and sincere
dedication that rebels against a system designed to keep human beings
used as human fuel even upon the eve of 2005. It acts upon and preys on
the destruction and exploitation of labor and demise of Black people.

We must mobilize and strategically construct positive as well as
politically educated demonstrations throughout this country and
worldwide for the poor and working class to unify coalitions, movements,
and struggle as one body. This, in turn, will inspire the youth and the
elders to collaborate on this everyday overlooked revolution upon many
misinformed people. When change begins, one's mind will accept true
reality and see biasness, racism, police brutality, false imprisonment,
oppression, abuse of authority, and the vindictiveness of this conniving
legal system. These capitalistic rulers collectively remain in love with
their Confederate flag. The oppression of our people is the ruling
class' position. The bloody symbol of racist terror and brutal slavery
that prides the ruling class religiously shines through their
Confederate flag they uphold.

So to all of my fellow freedom fighters, supporters and comrades that
live the struggle from day-to-day, turn up the heat and reach out
further than our comfort zones. To become in opposition to the Patriot
Act, we must allow the full outlook of political awareness and
consciousness of a revolutionary perspective to become present within
our households, places of religious practice, schools, jobs, social
gatherings, and family reunions. The people must be clear that to not
understand the concept and practice of revolution is like one reading
and not comprehending.

Therefore PDC family, we must continue to keep this revolution alive and
well. We must feed it to the masses. The struggle will not be complete
if we cannot forsee the triumph of revolution for our political
prisoners, prisoners of war, and wrongfully convicted by this mendacious
legal system that continues to wrecklessly disregard morality under the
color of law for justice. We search for answers everyday within this
misconceived world. Revolution is what will change this oppressed status
of second class instantly by opposing this rogue system that maliciously
disregards humanity, life, and freedom of the oppressed within this
ploy. Comrades, don't allow this system to dupe you with this "they are
for the people" propaganda.

Consequently, we can not continue to ignore the deception the media
imposes on us while the greedy fascist ruling class continues to invest
within this rotten system. The media's mega resources have allowed them
to mislead the miseducated and misinformed with mendacious defamation to
fatten their pockets at our people's expense.

Revolution is the crux; we must make this our goal and devote ourselves
to it. This will unify us and take it to the next level. Through this,
we can gain full vindication of all of our comrades who are wrongfully
trapped behind enemy lines. Many of them have dedicated their lives to
this struggle from day one. What energizes and validates the true
outlook of Revolution is that all of us as supporters, comrades and
revolutionaries across the globe contribute to the front lines of our
struggle. Many of our fallen warriors placed their lives on the line for
the cause of stopping this bogus and rogue unionism of a pernicious
system. We are clear that they did not die in vain.

The warriors still held in captivity such as Hugo Pinell, Sundiata
Acoli, Ruchell Magee, Dr. Mutulu Shakur, and my father Mumia Abu-Jamal,
whom by the way, still resides on death row in the Pennsylvania
hellholes, will ultimately be freed by people who remain steadfast in
solidarity. We must NOT give up hope. We will prevail and grow to new
heights by enriching political education amongst the youth and informing
the elders and the misfortunate. For those that come to this event today
and remain indecisive, you must increase your level of understanding of
the deep treachery of this decrepit system. I sincerely urge you to join
this movement that supports a class war and the freedom of all political
prisoners. See the potential in our youth of today for they are the new
Huey Newton, Bobby Seale, Malcolm X, Jommo Kenyatta and Paul Robeson of
today. They just need guidance and direction to display that natural
God-given potential for greatness they have been blessed with.
I, Jamal Hart, now reside within the Federal concentration camp known as
FCI Ray Brook in Ray Brook, New York. Although I am still held captive
behind enemy lines, I believed in the people, every last one of you,
from the start. 8 years later, I still believe that the power of the
people is immeasurable and unstoppable. We must show this racist
Government that the working class is united in solidarity with the poor.
People must resist this oppression of Black and other colonized people,
racism as a whole, the Port Maritime Security Act and the Patriot Act
which as most of you know, made COINTELPRO tactics legal. We adamantly
demand our FREEDOM NOW!

We are living in a time where the movement needs people to stand for
what they believe is unjust. Unify and mobilize vigorously and don't
give up on this struggle. This is revolution. We demand change and
freedom for the oppressed. I refuse to compromise and I urge all of you
to stand and resist the power of the ruling class, for they badly want
our demise. To those FBI and CIA agents sitting in this room tonight, we
know you're in here. We are not accepting any compromises nor will we
believe our demonstrations are useless. We will continue this cause and
fully support the Class War prisoners on all levels. Those of you who
have not joined must do so today. We will prevail in triumph and expose
these ploys of injustice that this disgusting system places upon us each
and everyday.

In closing, keep up the good work and we will be victorious in the end.
Stop the frame-ups! Free Mumia! Abolish the Death Penalty! Free All
Political Prisoners and Prisoners of War! Organize, mobilize, continue
to network, support the cause, and most of all keep believing in
Revolution. We must not stop until we are free!

Getting an Education in Jihad
By Megan K. Stack
Times Staff Writer

Infuriated by the U.S.-led 'crusade' in Iraq, a Lebanese teacher left
his country and steady job intending to die for the insurgency.

BEKAA VALLEY, Lebanon -- The handsome,
35-year-old teacher had many things to live for - a PhD, a steady job, a
healthy salary - but still he decided to leave home, make his way to
Syria and then sneak over the border into Iraq, intent on fighting
Americans, even if it meant dying in a suicide attack.

In the beginning, the schoolteacher had struggled to decide how he felt
about the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq. It spelled humiliation and sorrow
to Arabs. But as an Arab who had tasted the despair of despotism, he had
a small spot of hope.

"At first, I thought, 'OK, the Americans want to bring democracy to the
region,' " he said.

That was before he turned on the television to the grainy images of
prisoner abuse at Abu Ghraib. "The human triangle. The woman dragging
the man by the leash," said the teacher, a broad man with a clipped
beard and intense gaze. "These images affected me deeply. The shame the
Americans brought. I was fervently monitoring the TV images, not so much
the words as the pictures."

He remembered that President Bush called the war on terrorism a
"crusade." He thought about American helicopters being used by the
Israeli army to attack Palestinians. And he decided that sitting
impotently in Lebanon wasn't enough.

Over dates and sweet coffee in a middle-class living room here, he
recently spoke in measured tones about his fervor to fight in behalf of
Muslims against U.S. troops - and his decision to leave the battle in
Iraq to make his way home again.

The story of the teacher, who spoke on the condition that neither he nor
his hometown be named, reflects the oft-stated notion that the war in
Iraq has opened a regional Pandora's box of jihad. In a region where so
many people feel helpless before repressive governments and U.S. policy,
the road to Iraq has become a trail of independence in the minds of some
men, a way for young Muslims to come of age and to join the battles they
see on television.

His journey began here, in a high valley that is so flat it looks like
it was ironed, stretching like a gritty carpet between the mountains of
southern Lebanon, hard against the Syrian border. Unemployment is rife
and religious zeal intense.

It is a hardscrabble place where international worries and local woes
are intimately intertwined. A recent Friday sermon called for martyr's
blood to avenge the Iraqi insurgent shot dead on the floor of a mosque
by a U.S. Marine. "Every day we are seeing these things and hearing the
same word: Fallouja," the preacher cried. "What are we supposed to tell
our men? To put down their weapons? To surrender? If we do, who's going
to avenge their blood and tears?"

Then the sermon shifted seamlessly; the preacher tried to drum up
donations to heat the schools. "We worry about Iraq and about
Palestine," he said, "but it's getting cold here."

This ancient strip of farms has a history of defiance, and it has sent
its share of men to join the insurgency in Iraq. Some made their way
back home. Others have been commemorated at funerals without corpses
after friends called from Iraq to report their deaths.

Martyrdom doesn't come cheap. Foreign fighters are expected to pay their
own way, from smugglers' fees to meals. Many of the would-be mujahedin,
or holy warriors, simply can't afford to go, said Shaaban Ajani, the
mayor of a town in the Bekaa called Majdal Anjar.

Within Iraq, there is broad consensus that foreign fighters form only a
small band of the insurgency roiling the country. Nevertheless, in
neighboring countries the psychological resonance of the struggle, and
the adulation and envy of the foreign jihadis, has been profound.

"If a man stands just an hour with a weapon in his hand to fight jihad,
it's better than being a preacher in Mecca for 100 years," the teacher
said. "It's not about preaching. It's about actions."

Ajani, the mayor, doesn't disguise the pride in his voice when he tells
a visitor that two men from his town were killed fighting in Iraq. "It
is noble, and it's a religious duty," he said.

In his town, tensions between a frustrated people and their national
government exploded this fall. Lebanese agents swept through the Bekaa,
carrying out a sting operation on what was described as an Al Qaeda
cell.

Ten people were arrested. One, a Majdal Anjar resident named Ismail
Mohammed Khalil, 32, died in custody shortly after his arrest. The
government said he'd suffered a heart attack. Witnesses said his body
came home covered with cigarette burns, bruises and scorch marks left by
electrical shocks.

In the Bekaa, Khalil is remembered as a mild-mannered man who sold used
cellphones to support his five children. After his body was returned,
hundreds of men took to the streets and rioted. The suspect's real
crime, his neighbors and family say, was sympathy for the mujahedin who
trekked to Iraq - and his fervent hope that he could someday afford to
join their ranks.

"America has declared war against the Sunni people," said the mufti of
the Bekaa, Khalil Mais. "Are Muslims forbidden to defend themselves?
Jihad is the defense of country and of honor. How can you watch
television every night and not go?"

It was that conviction that inspired the schoolteacher to make his way
to Iraq.

After he decided to go, he waited for a break in classes. It was a quick
bus ride to Syria. He set off in the spring with a shortwave radio, a
small bundle of clothes and some cash.

The teacher had collected $3,500 for his trip. It was all the money he'd
saved from his salary, and he feared that it wouldn't be enough to keep
him going for what he expected would be a long period of fighting. He
had a local connection, a friend from the Bekaa who had joined foreign
fighters in Iraq and had agreed to vouch for him.

He remembers standing, on a cold spring night, on the line between Syria
and Iraq. Four border-jumpers before him had been caught by Syrian
troops. The smuggler he'd hired to ferry him to Baghdad was edgy. They
would hike through the desert rather than chance the roads.

It was a starless night, the teacher recalls, and he hadn't expected the
desert to be so cold. Stray dogs roamed the sands; American helicopters
thrummed overhead. He didn't let his guide rest or smoke cigarettes for
fear of getting caught.

The schoolteacher walked all night through the Iraqi desert until he
reached the outskirts of a small town. The guide walked toward the
lights and fetched a truck while the teacher waited in the wastelands.
Then they drove into Baghdad to meet a contact beneath a downtown
bridge.

He was taken to a villa crowded with dozens of men from Yemen, Libya,
Algeria, Syria and a host of other Arab countries. They'd order out for
food, and when it arrived, they'd argue over who would pay.

"It was a very nice atmosphere. Nobody wanted to take anything;
everybody wanted to give," the teacher said. "If there was a household
chore to be done, we fought over it."

Most of the men seemed well-educated, and they didn't lack for cash.
Some of them were veterans of the battle against U.S. Special Forces and
their Afghan allies in Tora Bora, Afghanistan. At night, they'd sit in
the villa, which was furnished with only a handful of chairs, and talk
about the sort of government that the Islamic people would install once
they kicked out the Americans.

After about eight days, it was the teacher's turn to move. They took him
to Fallouja in a battered car. He believed the time for his suicide
mission was near, but he ended up in another house, surrounded by Saudis
- mostly Salafists, adherents of the most rigorous school of Islamic
thought - who were waiting eagerly for their own suicide missions. The
men were organized into platoons, the teacher said, with every 50 or so
foot soldiers under the guidance of a commander.

"Many of the guys in the house had very limited military training," he
said. "But it doesn't take much military training to get in the car and
blow yourself up."

The teacher spoke reverently of Jordanian-born militant Abu Musab
Zarqawi, who has been tied to numerous beheadings and other deadly
attacks in Iraq. He bragged that he spent a night with a Zarqawi aide
who has since been killed and that he caught a glimpse inside a spartan
bedroom occupied by Zarqawi. Though he didn't see the militant leader,
he described the Jordanian kaffiyeh, or headdress, he left behind.

After a week of waiting around in Fallouja, the teacher said, he began
to feel guilty. It wasn't that he became frightened, but the dreams he'd
had in Lebanon didn't match the mundane reality in Iraq. He felt more
like an interloper than a savior.

"I realized I was staying in somebody's house, and the owners were
moving from place to place to make room for us," he said. "Then I
realized they didn't need us, and in fact we were sort of hampering the
Iraqis."

The foreigners' accents made them a security threat, and their makeshift
dormitories drew U.S. bombs to residential neighborhoods. Iraqi
collaborators with the U.S.-led forces would throw compact discs onto
rooftops to mark the homes where the mujahedin were sleeping for U.S.
warplanes, the teacher said.

"We were a burden, and the Iraqis could take up the battle," the teacher
said. "I came to realize that they didn't need people, they needed money
much more than people. I realized I'd be of greater use if I financially
supported them."

He made his way back through the desert under a moon that was nearly
full. American patrols swooped overhead. At the border, he said, he
spent $200 bribing Syrian officials to let him pass.

Now he is home, among friends envious of his adventure. He has
occasional regrets about returning to Lebanon.

Other men from the Bekaa also have come home, community leaders said.
But the humiliation that drove them into the desert continues to fester,
given in regular doses by the evening news.

"When I saw the man shot in the mosque, I wanted to go back," the
teacher said with a shrug. "They say it's a war crime. I think the whole
war is a war crime."

Van Newkirk sounds a bit of a worry - shooting blanks at Kenneth Koch -Koch
was heeled I believe, didn't lack for the doh re me, could toss the jingle
around - but was he so mainstream? Is Van New Kirk a kind of Canadian
Burroughs?  Or a Craven........The stuff of poetic legends.... His posters
etc one day will turn up on "The Roadshow" ....!!

Is he hiding out with Amiri Baraka? He's not a CIA operative- and Agent
Provocateur? No?

We can only hope that the financially impoverished among us don't follow  his
example, no matter how tempting. He seemed a revolutionary rather than a
rebel within Camus' definition, more concerned with artistic expression and
elusive justice rather than promoting lasting (r)evolution. The act of thievery
against ToysRus is a great social message, but the life taking potential of it
definitely crosses a line. But whose to say really? And as Kenneth Pachen
said:

"It's always because we love that we are rebellious; it takes a great deal
of love to give a damn one way or another what happens from now on: I still
do....The function of the artist is to express love. What most people fail to
understand is not the artist's work but his essential unworldliness in wanting
to give love."

I know that love isn't enough, and who really knows besides the artist
whether his expression is love or not. Sometimes the futility of our lives seems
so ridiculous all we can do is express it.

Children with guns


In the church they worship spiders, on T.V.
Christ with a neat goatee foretells the rain.
Men drunk on anger oil their blood machines,
women ingest the pennies of their dreams,
and children with guns
dance howling on the entrails of their brothers.

At the Union Hall they're slurping poison soup.
The flesh rots from their faces.  "Who are you?"
they ask each others' mirrors.
Men scream at machines in isolation,
women can't catch their breath, and children with guns
take aim at the morning.

hey robert,

sorry for the delay in my reply.

the best bet is a postpaid envelope big enough to fit 8" x 10.75" (as 1/4
folded) copies of the paper. so probably an 11" x 14" one would work. and a
check payable to boog city for as many different issues, or multiple copies
of an issue, you desire. when i listed issues for sale on poetics 18 months
ago, i said 7 for $20 ppd. As of now there are 21 issues out (all of which i
can detail for you what's inside of them). Let me know how many you might
like and i can tell you how much postage to put on and what i'd charge you
for them.

hope this finds you well.

as ever,
david

the sexiest poem of 2004

talking this evening with my friend Matt McGoldrick,

I wonder if it's been posted on someone's blog?

Although I'm pretty certain that someone had posted it
to this listserv back in August or September.  Or maybe
someone had sent it to me and I just thought that I had
seen it posted here.

To be honest, I had never forgotten reading it, because
it is the sort of inspiring poem you don't/won't forget,
HOWEVER, hearing it, and I mean hearing it Bernstein-
style reading, well, you're marked, permanently.

Has anyone else out there heard the poet read his poem
who would agree?  Even if you have heard and disagree,
well, that's fine, but it won't change my opinion.

As long as you save one copy of the final finished product
it does not not matter what computer program it was created on
as the publication can be scanned & re-created.

Always save one final copy. Trying to open Word 20 years from now
will be the same as trying to recover material on 51/4 floppy Apple II C
files today.

Audio is worse, you need to press a record on virgin vinyl to be safe.

Here is an experience for you that i enjoyed immensely. At
http://greatworks.org.uk/poems/ttp1.html and
http://greatworks.org.uk/poems/ttp.html you will find the script of Paul
Green's (Britain) radio play 'The Terminal Poet'.

The synopsis:

"Poet Charles Kenning was once a darling of the literary world. Now a
drink-sodden wreck, he's holed up in an inner city high-rise, unaware that
agents of an American think-tank are monitoring his squalor. For both the
Helicon Foundation and the British Cabinet have a use for him in their
hi-tech struggle against urban anarchy and the strange powers of the Quantum
Slut Crew. . ."

The script also contains some mp3 links. I suggest you click on them while
reading that part of the script.

Paul Green has been at it for a long time. Here's a piece of his from 1971
called 'The Gestalt Bunker' which is relevant today:
http://www.culturecourt.com/Audio/PG/DNA/PG-gestalt.mp3 (6:41). It's from a
poet's point of view also, a poet holed-up at the end of whatever we're at
the end of in his 'gestalt bunker', but in 1971. A related piece, again from
1971, is called 'Directions to the Dead End':
http://www.culturecourt.com/Audio/PG/DNA/PG-deadend.mp3 (6:49). This is a
post-apocalyptic poem. All these pieces might be considered 'nihilistic'.
Yet i find them entertaining and not nihilistic in the sense that they find
their way to liveliness and poetry. They are exciting. They create
beginnings.

I find myself going back to 'Gestalt Bunker' and 'Directions to the Dead
End' from time to time. I think after you hear those two pieces you read the
script of 'The Terminal Poet' differently. You have a sense of Green. It may
give you a deeper sense of Green to know he also runs a literary press
called Spectacular Diseases. A catchy name, certainly.

I found the reading experience of 'The Terminal Poet' gripping, and have
read it several times by now.

most of the jellies and slimemolds are from this area
coral fungi as well, as well as slimes, rots
some people entered this space forever they found paths behind anything
they might think about and sooner than later the thoughts also stop

the people don't know that ( about the thoughts stopping )
to them it's just eternal slowness
they might realize that but it wouldn't matter i can say that
i still remember the paths and shuffling
life shuffles there are polypores as well of all sorts
and hawks other things even less visible
they have forgotten why they are there and the world is very calm

You're absolutely right.

Nevertheless, it is usually possible to keep updating as one goes. I started
word-processing around 1982; and, while most of those files have become
irrelevant to me, I still have material from that era, some of it on 8 inch
discs, 51/4 and 3 inch; and from a variety of software

It requires organisation, which can be a problem for me! but it can be done;
and it is worth doing

I just OCR scanned a publication which had been ink-duplicated in the 70s
(Eric Mottram's TOWARDS DESIGN IN POETRY) and *yearned for a word-processed
copy. Obviously, the ink duplication was the major factor there; but even
with a good original, scanning takes a while - much better, if one can, to
upgrade the files. It can be done in stages on rainy days.

hands down

the sexiest poem of 2004



is "Girly Man" by Charles Bernstein and I don't just mean the
poem but the reading of the poem as well

if there were separate awards for poem
and reading of poem
Bernstein and his poem would win both

when reading the poem at the MLA reading in Philadelphia
he dedicated its reading to the memories of Gil Ott and
Jackson Mac Low

in New York at the Poetry Project's New Year reading
he dedicated the reading to Jackson Mac Low

both times, as a listener, I dedicated my ears to let it
be heard and told to the living, everywhere

if Bernstein never inspired you
ever before
you would not be able to say so after hearing

and I wish (like all wishing idiots) that I could have
had the MANY fools who know nothing about
Language Poetry but claim to know it well and
claim to hate it---I wish they could have heard
what I heard

talking this evening with my friend Matt McGoldrick,
he and I agreed that the reading in Philadelphia had
much more punch and excitement

but 2004 was the sexy year for The Girly Man
thank you Mr. Bernstein

Someone in reference to Bernstein's "sexy" poem was lamenting that people
claim to understand language poetry but they don't really and so on, or they
hate it and shouldn't  -that maybe:  but here are some thoughts on language
poetry and some of the Language poets  -

There is no question that Charles Bernstein is a brilliant poet - I recall
studying his poem that started:

On a broad plane on a universe of
anterooms, making signals in the dark, you
fall down on  your waistband & carrying your
own plate, a last serving, set out for
another glimpse of a gaze. In a room

Even in that short start to "Matters of Policy"  ( a book that has a kind of
political subtext and other things going on.) - there is a lot to think
about -
the "cosmicness" is undercut shortly as the poem progresses but there are
already "references ", puns, multiplex meanings etc - eg "waist band" might
be a code for "The Waste Land", 'ante' may be a pun (for anti) .The "gaze"
has smooth to do with Baudrillard -haven't read anything by him but the term
"the gaze - supposedly from an idea of Baudrillard's - is very much used in
poetics discussions these days...).
The title is multiplex in meaning or at least in its stance, its
connotations - other poems by Bernstein - in the book the poem was in -had
fragmented sentences (it seems possible to connect the fragments sometimes -
but it becomes  like a complex sematic jig saw puzzle that is perhaps - is
hopefully - unsolvable: (the poetic tactic against "clarity" or
"transparency") and there some fascinating insights, and ideas  - so I was
very interested and still am in what the language poets (and their
descendents and fellow travellers) -if they can be put in any "box" - were
(are) doing.

I 'introduced' some of my younger friends to "language poetry" and my friend
Scott Hamilton took a great interest in Coolidge and the poem that goes
"trilobites trilobite" (in "In the American Tree") and so on and the
discussion on the "New Sentence" by Silliman (backgrounded by concepts from
Stein etc) - I was very keen on Ron Silliman's work such as "Tjanting"
"Paradise" and others - and also we liked the critical writing of
erloff  -in fact Scott got into reading Wittgenstein from reading
"Wittgenstein's Ladder" by Perloff. We also found Antin's "talk poems" very
interesting as an experience and a method - BUT

In 2001 it seemed that Perloff's support of the invasion of Afghanistan (to
make sure that America wasn't destroyed and then we wouldn't have any
culture in the US to talk about: that is kill the Arabs before they destroy
the greatland of poetry -war for poetry seemed to be her idea...)  and some
of Antin's responses were worrying - he talked of (or seemed to be talking
of)  exterminating the Arabs - made some remarks that they were "rats' to be
got rid of and so on (I'm feel sure he made such remarks but it was some
time ago, the detaisl may be quite wrong ... but I'm certain that was the
tenor of some of the ideas expressed by these leading language poets) - and
that was 2001 and not long after S/11 and  everyone was a bit crazy - I know
it affected me here even in New Zealand: in fact it kind of re-politicised
me. Scott moved toward Marxist politics and said he couldn't now read
Siliman's work knowing his political views - now I feel that was rather
extreme - but here is an interview or part of it published recently in NZ
magazine called Brief where views on the language poets (and other matters)
are thrown around - I feel Scott is a bit hard on Sillman - as far as I know
Hamish hasn't looked at epc for  a while and maybe Andrews has shifted his
"Marxist " positions etc  But here is the excerpt:

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
------------------------

Hamish:  For me, landscape is always something which is inanimate. And it is
usually malign...remember, I moved about in China itself, moved from the
sticks to the coast and took jobs teaching English, without the literature
thing. Finished my Masters' thesis off in China.

Scott: Bruce Andrews?

Hamish:  Bruce Andrews.

Scott:  What'd you end up thinking about his work? It might not have been so
bad studying a poet of dissonance and disjunction in such an alien
environment.

Hamish:  Well, Andrews is working with the violence and dissonance of
American society. Social breakdown, breakdowns in communication. Often he
works by writing down phrases he hears, overhears, and tries to shape them,
relate them, without necessarily making 'sense'. The question is whether he
is not simply reproducing the violence that gives him his material...The
Language poets offer us a whole range of models, formal models, but I don't
see the need to accept the programme, to buy the whole package. Take what
you can use. I particularly like Susan Howe.

Scott:  I agree with that attitude. Some of the critical writing of Ron
Silliman, for instance, is incredibly dogmatic. He almost outlaws everything
except his 'New Sentence'. A particular form is fetishised as oppositional,
subversive yadaya, but the impact of any literary form always depends on
context. After a few books of Silliman's I felt that a rhymed sonnet would
be more subversive than another 'new' sentence. And of course the only
people who were using the new revolutionary formula happened to live in the
richest societies in the world. So the form was imperiocentric.

Hamish:  I can't comment on Silliman, but Andrews has a solid background in
Marxism, political economy. He's hardcore. That's one of the things that
makes him interesting...but Silliman, I've never been that into him...a bit
dry?

Scott:  I thought the bankruptcy of Silliman and one or two others - David
Antin and Marjorie Perloff are names that come to mind - was shown after S
11, when they suddenly morphed into unpaid military advisors to George
Dubya.

Hamish:  Really? On the EPC list? I haven't checked that for years...

Scott:  If you were against the invasion of Afghanistan Silliman called you
an appeaser. The enemy was Islamofascism. Antin actually talked about rats,
and having to do an extermination job...understandable responses from
ordinary Americans, maybe, but not quite what you'd expect from the
Patriachs of the Oppositional Word.

Hamish:  Most of the Chinese that I talked to had little sympathy with the
US after S 11. In fact many were happy. They saw it as the US getting paid
back a little for what it's done so often. If the US ever invades China, it
will make Iraq look like a cakewalk. The Chinese would just run out of their
homes and fight the US troops, with anything they've got. Forks and knives
off the table if they had nothing else. They hate America.

Scott:  You've written academic or semi-academic stuff on other people?

Hamish:  Leigh Davis, a couple of pieces, the second of which takes issue
with the commodification of language in his work...I'm keen on Joanna Paul
and have written a bit on her. I'm interested in anyone who's experimenting
with language in a disciplined manner. Innovative but also crafted work.

Scott:  Do you value craft above inspiration, or vice versa, or is the
opposition too old-fashioned to be bothered about?

Hamish:  Inspiration is a craft. Next question.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-------------------------

I am not quite in complete accord with Scott - he forces the argument for
the interview - but am with him in the main points made.

I'm not sure what the function of a political poem with no analysis in it
is these days beyond cheerleading for the fans. It's not likely to create
any converts, and I don't think many of the faithful are waivering. Maybe
the entire purpose is to inscribe oneself as one of the good guys. But if
the reading was entertaining that's a plus.

I would say that the poem has a pretty clear analysis, in that it critiques
the (hardly analytical) political language of the Governator- language that
reinforces the worst stereotypes of what it means to be a "man". The poem
takes its place in a distinguished subversive tradition of co-opting slurs.

And cheerleading's not so bad either. It's what Rove calls "rallying the
base"!

though I am not a fan of andrew sullivan... this is a worthy read on
Susan Sontag.
http://transdada.blogspot.com/


Susan Sontag and a Case of Curious Silence

from andrewsullivan.com:

THE INNING OF SONTAG: I have to say I'm amazed at the fact that almost
all the obituaries for Susan Sontag omitted her primary, longtime
relationship with Annie Leibovitz, the photographer. Of 315 articles in
Nexis, only 29 mention Leibovitz, and most of them referred merely to
their joint projects. Leibovitz was unmentioned as a survivor in the
NYT and Washington Post. It's striking how even allegedly liberal
outlets routinely excise the homosexual dimension from many people's
lives - even from someone dead. But perhaps it is reflective of
Sontag's own notions of privacy and identity. She championed many
causes in her day, but the gay civil rights movement was oddly not
prominent among them.

MORE ON SONTAG: I'm not the only one to notice how the big media has
essentially lied by omission about Susan Sontag's life. An op-ed in
today's L.A. Times notes the following: An unauthorized biography
written by Carl Rollyson and Lisa Paddock and published by W.W. Norton
in 2000, reports that Sontag was, for seven years, the companion of the
great American playwright Maria Irene Fornes (in Sontag's introduction
to the collected works of Fornes, she writes about them living
together). She also had a relationship with the renowned choreographer
Lucinda Childs. And, most recently, Sontag lived, on and off, with
Leibovitz.

Even Hitchens mentions only her ex-husband. Privacy? From a woman who
detailed every aspect of her own illnesses? From someone whose best
work is redolent with homosexual themes? But, of course, Sontag
understood that her lesbianism might limit her appeal in a homophobic
culture - even on the extreme left, where she comfortably lived for
decades. That was her prerogative. But that's no reason for the media
to perpetuate untruths after her death. And it's certainly reason to
review her own record in confronting injustice. Just as she once
defended the persecution of gay people in Castro's Cuba, she ducked one
of the burning civil rights struggles of her time at home. But she was
on the left. So no one criticized.

This is to let a number of you know that I'm starting -- indefatigably =
-- on a new project of some size: a Romantic and postromantic (including =
early modern) gathering conceived as a nineteenth-century sequel or =
prequel to Poems for the Millennium.  My co-editor and the true =
originator of the project is Jeffrey Robinson, whom some of you may know =
already as a scholar of English Romanticism and a marvelous voice in =
connecting that germinal moment and movement to the most innovative and =
radical poetries of our own time and place.  The publisher, as with =
Poems for the Millennium, will be the University of California Press.

Our plan is to trace a line or several lines of work -- both poetry and =
poetics -- from the late eighteenth-century post-enlightenment to the =
early twentieth-century eruption of experimental and avant-garde =
modernism.  Like what Pierre Joris and I did in Poems for the =
Millennium, such a gathering, as we conceive it, would be international =
in scope (with a focus, for obvious reasons, on all of Europe and all of =
the Americas) and would attempt to restore a sense of the revolutionary =
and transformative nature of Romanticism and postromanticism as they =
were at the time of their inception.  We would also aim, as before, to =
reach beyond literature as such and to incorporate both extraliterary =
forms of language experiment and the vast range of ethnopoetic =
discoveries that were prevalent throughout the nineteenth century.  By =
so doing we aim to recapture a great body of poetry (canonical as well =
as non-canonical) that was stripped of its counterpoetic potential and =
too often denied by many of those who were in fact among its true =
inheritors. =20

Jeffrey Robinson and I view this not only as "our" project but as a =
potentially collective work, in which we would call on the knowledge and =
the passions of those of you who share our sense of the romantic as a =
principal starting point for much that has followed.  Our primary search =
is for works of poetry -- broadly defined -- but we are also tracking =
down critical and scholarly writings, including (very much so) related =
work and commentaries by later poets and other active practitioners, =
among them many of those for whom Romanticism as such was or remains a =
problematic value.  Beyond that we have a desperate need for =
translations -- either suggestions of poetry already translated or =
offers to join with us in the crucial work of creating or transcreating =
new translations that will conserve and forcefully carry the old works =
back to the domain of the new.

As with Poems for the Millennium, when Pierre Joris and I began it, we =
have only a first, still dim presentiment of where this will carry us.  =
What we're offering, then, is a genuine call both for translations and =
for consultation and assistance that will open the project to all of you =
who want to have a voice in it. =20

Dear Jerome,

For a poetry left outside Romanticism, although its economy was bound =
deeply into that of the Romantics, I hope you will look at Se=E1n =D3 =
Tuama and Thomas Kinsella's An Duanaire: Poems of the Dispossessed =
1600-1900 (Dolmen Press, 1994).

Andrew Sullivan manages to remain a falsifier even when he is
ostensibly criticizing (with reason) the U.S. press's omission of
Susan Sontag's homosexuality (something which, I might add, Spain's EL
PAIS and Mexico's LA JORNADA reported fully, both acknowledging her
relationship with Annie Liebowitz and both dedicating several pages to
remembrances and evaluations of her work and legacy).  Sontag did not,
as Sullivan claims, "defend the persecution of gay people in Castro's
Cuba."  In fact, she appeared in Nestor Almendros and Orlando Jimenez
Leal's documentary film IMPROPER CONDUCT, which detailed and denounced
precisely such persecution.  This was a courageous action, as most on
the stubbornly pro-Castro "left" attacked the film.  Subsequently, she
denounced the suppression of Solidarity by General Jaruzelski in 1981
and, without at any time supporting Reagan and his group of kakocrats,
denounced Stalinism and its legacies in Eastern Europe.  A couple of
years ago, she wrote an illuminating preface to Victor Serge's novel
of the Stalinist purges THE CASE OF COMRADE TULAYEV.  And although I
am generally unconvinced by her ventures into fiction, I admired very
much her short story from the 1980s, "The Way We Live Now," which
deals with AIDS.

All of Sullivan's sneerily reductive left-bashing simply overlooks the
fact that, however much she may have supported the Chinese Cultural
Revolution and the Castro regime in the past, she never hesitated to
change her positions on these issues without for that matter ever
abandoning an independent leftist perspective.

David,

It did.  I will send a post paid envelope to you for a complete set of Boog City, and also for ten copies of your latest.  Expect after the 10th, since that is payday for me.

Have I sent you a copy of Experimental Theology?  I recall doing this.  I send you other publications, but our copies of them are scarce.

hey robert,

sorry for the delay in my reply.

the best bet is a postpaid envelope big enough to fit 8" x 10.75" (as 1/4
folded) copies of the paper. so probably an 11" x 14" one would work. and a
check payable to boog city for as many different issues, or multiple copies
of an issue, you desire. when i listed issues for sale on poetics 18 months
ago, i said 7 for $20 ppd. As of now there are 21 issues out (all of which i
can detail for you what's inside of them). Let me know how many you might
like and i can tell you how much postage to put on and what i'd charge you
for them.

hope this finds you well.

as ever,
david

I enjoy Susan Sontags esays on Reifenstahl and so on and I sold that book of
stories on AIDS  - she also writes about cancer - I read that - it s ounds
morebid but she makes the pont that it hasbt replaced TB as a "romantic" way
to be or die - so many in  lit are romantcillaly "consumptive etc - but TB
and of course cancer ans aids are terrible diseases and she atckle those
subjects - alos heaad onto Hitler and other questions - she was a very
bright person - very knowledgeable, as was Guy Davenprt  - first heard of
him on Hugh Kenner's  "The Pound Era"

I havent read anything about her and I had no idea she was "gay" or
whatver - I saw a picture of her - her face I could see on one book - and
she appeared very intense: beautiful face, and intelligent - as her work
is - very intelligent..very insightful.

Dear Steve Dalachinksy,
you say "wow that's a bit much" in reference to my giving
Mr. Bernstein my much coveted Sexiest Poem Award.

You feel I'm overrating the poem?  Is that what you mean
by "wow that's a bit much"?  Well, I guess that's the way
it is with awards, meaning not everyone's going to agree
with the judge's decision, but hey, it's my award to give,
and I'll give it to the poet I feel deserves it the most.

First of all, Frank Sherlock, I agree with everything you say.

but Mark Weiss, did you actually read the poem?

If you did, I'm not at all certain how you can say what you did.
Even if Bernstein weren't making reference to the governor of
California's ridiculous speech at the RNC, even if he was just
talking out of the air, it's an amazing political statement.

So much of this world is braided with tension around our gender
and how we "need" to act, work, play, make love, eat food, pay
the bills, la la la la lalala, the song goes on, and you know it.

Bernstein has done something VERY few heterosexual men
(I'm sorry Mr. Bernstein for assuming you're heterosexual,
because I certainly wouldn't want anyone assuming that
about me) are willing, or capable, or BRAVE enough to do,
and that is to jeopardize his role as a Man.  It's very cool, it's
so wonderful, and far FAR more cutting edge that any of us
faggots out here writing poetry can do.  Meaning of course
that for a faggot like me to write such a poem would almost
be, Yeah, I told you so.  But for Bernstein, well, it is a definite
slice of courage, stepping out of the Norm, even for a poet.

After reading the poem I gained a new respect for Bernstein,
but after hearing him read it, well, I'm marked, and willing to
defend the man at this point.  He has my vote, and he has
my award for The Sexiest Poem Of 2004!!!!!!!

peace

in these times where invasion has become a metaphor in our lives, it was
a curious silence that susan sontag's bravery, intellect, radical
writing and philosophies were not ignored in favour of yello
jouranlism's incursion on the personal; for we have been fascinated into
the trivial by those easily distracted for a daze for far too long.  i
think it a pleasant return to what's really important concerning the
life and work of an artist, writer and intellect not bogged down by the
cult of personality and western soaperatic identity politricks.

it is by this curious silence where sontag is given respects for a
life's work-- not as a jew, not as a gay;  not as a woman b.u.t. as,
indeed, a writer with flow who challenged the static snow of the
billboredom of amerikkka.

"The conversation among writers that takes place in the last 20 years is
for the most part just like the conversation of any other professional
people on the make. They could just as well be advertising executives or
businesspeople, or anything else. They talk about income and they talk
about the comforts or lack of comforts of their personal lives, and --
but that's a kind of -- if I think back on my own life, the single most
amazing phenomenon is the discrediting of idealism." -- Democracy Now
Interview: Susan Sontag, 1933-2004

PennSound is the largest collection of poetry sound files on the
Internet, boasting 1,500 for noncommercial distribution and growing.

"This has never been done before," said Al Filreis, PennSound
co-director (with Charles Bernstein). "Most of the electronic sound
files available to the public are of entire poetry recordings, 30 or
more minutes long, with no tracking of individual cuts or poems. We
believe philosophically that, since there is no significant profit to be
gained by the sale of recorded poetry -- unlike music -- many, many more
poets will continue to grant us permission to use their work."

I received some unfortunate news yesterday.  My friend Jon Kuniholm
serving in Iraq (http://www.asmenews.org/features/1204iraq.html,
http://tinyurl.com/6r9kj) was seriously wounded during an ambush while
on patrol New Year's Day and lost his right hand and much of his right
arm.  He survived thankfully but neither his right hand not his right
hand man didn't make it.   Jon's on his way home and everything will be
done to ensure that his arm will be treated with the best of care.

So in my little life of less consequence I wrote a poem upon hearing the
awful news, a poem clearly incomplete and raw, and then WCHL called
hours later asking me if I had a New Year's poem for them.  It's of
course way too early for me to process the news about Jon, much less
write a poem about it, and so like most of my poems out came this very
awkward poem in defiance of anything sound or reasonable.  What timing,
however, that WCHL would call asking for a New Year's poem.  So I
decided to read it for them, and they recorded it as part of an
interview.   God how Jon'd hate this poem.  Believe me I don't like it
so much either, except maybe as a foil for getting some of this
frustration out of my system.  I'm just glad Jon's coming back and will
continue to be the wonderful husband and father he is.  I also know the
media doesn't want to hear about bad news and casualties in a
poem--"support your troops" is the rhetorical equivalent to "shut your
piehole you unpatriotic terror-lover"--but then I think the folks at
WCHL are going to play it, so what do I know?

So if you're in the neighborhood listen to 1360AM WCHL Thursday
(tomorrow) between 7 and 9AM to "WCHL Morning News with Ron Stutts" for
it.

Notes on the poem:
The first stanza borrows from "Lift Your Right Arm" by Peter Cherches
and "As I Walked Out One Evening" by WH Auden.
Parts of the second stanza are taken from quotes from Bush and Rumsfeld
(e.g., Rumsfeld, on WMDs - "the absence of evidence is not evidence of
absence.")
The second stanza is a traduction of "Auld Lang Syne."

As a contribution to this group, and in the hope of generating some usefu=
l
discussion, I plan soon to post a few short essays on fine but neglected
poets.  By neglected, I mean that their works are unlikely to be familiar=
 to
readers of poetry in English speaking countries, because their poems are =
hard
to find unless you know exactly where to look, and they are rarely
anthologized.

Though I can't presume that list members will find my opinions worth read=
ing,
I hope that the fact that these poets have not received much attention, a=
nd
that they are good enough to deserve more, will make the essays worth you=
r
consideration.

Subject:      A neglected poet:  Sean Rafferty
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1
Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable

A great poet, I think, can not be defined, but can always be recognized. =

Typical characteristics may include the ability to speak of private joy o=
r
misery with universal validity, a voice which vividly incarnates its owne=
r's
personality in every line, an unstrained mastery of all the various lingu=
istic
and cultural traditions of which any poet is the product, and perhaps mos=
t
telling of all, a dawning awareness on the part of the reader that here a=
re
poems not so much to be read as to be lived with.

The Scottish poet Sean Rafferty by all these criteria is unmistakably a g=
reat
poet.  At the time of his death in 1993 he had published very little, tho=
ugh
his poetry won the admiration of such important poets as Ted Hughes and S=
orley
MacLean, and the posthumous issuance of his collected poems by the presti=
gious
British publisher Carcanet attracted little attention.  Such neglect is
incomprehensible, since his poetry surely evinces all the qualities of
greatness which I have just mentioned.  The universalizaton of personal g=
rief,
one of the oldest and most important functions of poetry, is achieved wit=
h
heartbreaking success in a group of early pieces on loss which, like most=
 of
his poems, are untitled.   Here, for example, are some verses on the deat=
h of
the poet's first wife in 1945:

        In May the month of miracle
        flower on the black bough
        flower on the green leaf;
        in May the flower the frost the fall
        the month of May is all my grief.
    =

        The white hawthorn the lilac massed     =

        to dwarf my mourning where I passed;
        they were like alien angels come
        before their time to greet her home =


        Too early come the cruel frost
        that claimed my love too early lost
        their promise for a tribute gave
        and wept their flowers into her grave.

We can discern behind the seemingly artless accents of these lines a
characteristic diction and technique which is learnedly traditional yet
staunchly modernistic:  that second stanza would not seem out place in Fr=
ost,
nor would the third in Marvell, yet they still seem easily compatible wit=
h
each other.  Also typical of this poet is the slight, deliberate idiosync=
rasy
of syntax and punctuation -- for instance, the lack of a verb in the firs=
t
three lines of the first stanza, the omitted commas in the next two lines=
, and
the lack of a conjunction in the first line of the next stanza -- minor a=
nd
deliberate irregularities which give a startling extra dimension to the p=
oetic
voice, a voice which expresses, with intense emotion under utter control,=
 a
vision in which the external world becomes not merely symbolic of the poe=
t's
emotions, but fused into identity with them, as for instance in the image=
 of
the flowering trees which dwarf human pain.

           Similar qualities distinguish Rafferty's several poems on the lost
innocence of childhood, of which 'On the green hill of childhood keep...'=
 I
would rank with Dylan Thomas's 'Fern Hill' as one of our definitive state=
ments
of the theme. It is very hard not to quote the whole of this wonderful po=
em,
but perhaps its ending lines will suggest how Rafferty has achieved the
miracle of writing about childhood with deep feeling unmarred by
sentimentality, as well as how skillfully he can give his poems added
intellectual resonance by positioning them within specific traditions, in=
 this
case by deft allusions to Marvell's The Garden:

                Run where you will
        you cannot trespass, if you fall you fall
        only where grass is soft; though ripe fruits reach
        into your mouth they do not tempt but teach
        a simple lesson and no sin to eat:
        the sloe how bitter but the bramble sweet.

(Compare Marvell:

       What wondrous life is this I lead!
       Ripe apples drop about my head;
       The luscious clusters of the vine
       Upon my mouth do crush their wine;
       The nectarine and curious peach
       Into my hands themselves do reach;
       Stumbling on melons as I pass,
       Ensnared with flowers, I fall on grass.)


        The timelessness of much of Rafferty's verse is demonstrated in an elegi=
ac
ballad on old William Woolsery, which could almost have been written at
anytime in the past four centuries but which does not sound in the least
artificially archaic.  "An old man mumbling in a public bar" (these poems=
 seem
full of old men and they are all tough and touchy and flawed and kind and=

beautiful) gives us one of our literature's classic statements on the sam=
eness
of all wars:  it is what "The Battle of Blenheim" might have been if "The=

Battle of Blenheim" were not ghastly.  War is also the theme of "1945" an=
d
"1959," which present a horrifying vision of past and present hellishly
jumbled together both physically and culturally in the urban landscape of=

London after World War II, which Rafferty unforgettably calls "a war the
surrealists won."

        It must not be thought, however, that such melancholy themes exhaust
Rafferty's poetic range:  he is also capable of producing some of the mos=
t
splendid comic verse of the century.  High points of his work in this man=
ner
include "A Near Thing," a sort of combination of P. G. Wodehouse and Noel=

Coward with a touch of Samuel Beckett, and "Liebestod," perhaps the most
puzzlingly hilarious poem in English since "The Aged Aged Man," which giv=
es us
among much else the (deliberately Betjemanesque?) lines:

        Simile to me, smile to me
        speak with your smile to me,
        speak to me over the din;
        Oh how I wish I was oiling your bicycle
        then we could go for a spin

That, like all high comic verse, stays funny no matter how many times you=
 read
it.

I hope these samples  will at least make defensible my contention that th=
is
poet, who is in none of the major reference works or anthologies, belongs=
 in
them all.

5 January 2005

I go to the bookshelf, take down Flowers & Leaves, that striking and alas so
little-known long poem so elegantly published back in 1966 by Jonathan
Williams, Guy's lifelong friend. And drew the sorts: my hand flips back and
forth, I do not watch, and the motion stops, my thumb at page 110.

           "The cat of Pierre Loti. _Hippolyte on l'appelle_.
             A sardine of paleological silver the great artist
             Gave him when he sat for his portrait, aromatic
             And with the _soupcon_ of _huile d'olive_ about it,
             As was proper, whose family reached back
             To Nilotic tax collectors in porcelan wigs,
             To the bee gums of Beersheba, Akkadian hotels,
            (A cousin removed was friend to Mr Smart the poet);
              Leo Alektor kept the high gates at Mycenae,
              Quite Hebraic, the family tree, rich in detail.
              But we are companion to Monsieur Loti.."

Yes. His love for cats. His restless curious and so astonishingly generous
and open mind, its passionate delights. "Guy Davenport went round in a dream
the day he learned the Greek alphabet," he told me in 1979. That dream never
faded, any more than will he in my remembrance and delight. The debt - my
debt - is enormous. Our debt, I should say.

He read, thought, remembered. He remembered _everything. And cared,
profoundly.

Oh damn! damn! damn! the loss. What else is there to say.

Peter

American Whatever
Tim Davis
76 pages, ISBN: 1890311170

Tim Davis's idea factory is open 24/7, tossing out paint chips in whatever
colour you want, as long as it's frosted cocktail cherry.  Like Andy Kaufman
slapping Ron Silliman in one of Joe Brainard's "Nancy" cartoons.  Is hair
tonic really 40% proof? Only your bartender knows for sure. --Miles Champion


Tim Davis is, egregiously, haplessly, everything many of us want to be: a

person who looked up the word "Flonase" in Ambrose Bierce's dictionary and

found a drypoint of his impertinent navel smiling back at him.  Perhaps

that's where he got the wonderful, Robespierrian idea of reinventing the

calendar -- Joseph Ceravolo famously thought a university course should be

taught on the seasons, and while we don't know how much serotonin is needed

to make "endofmeday" anything less than wonderful, I know I'm sprinting home

to rummage through my hope chest to discover which quarter of the Gregorian

pie-chart  -- Terpsichore, perhaps? -- "The Missing Month" belongs.  This

American Whatever is the shrapnel of life in sui generous sentences.
-- Brian Kim Stefans

METROPOLIS XXX: THE DECLINE AND FALL OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE
by Rob Fitterman
71 pages, ISBN: 1890311162

Metropolis XXX: The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire drags Edward
Gibbon's historical explorations into a parallel morass of today's mass marketing and
consumerism, where Roman Art becoms Airbrush, Roman transportation becomes
Bubble Wrap, &&&. This single-section is the third book of Fitterman's long poem
Metropolis;  the other two volumes are Metropolis 1-15 (Sun & Moon Press) and
Metropolis 16-29 (Coach House Books).

Rob Fitterman apes Edward Gibbon --- but instead of restating the fall of the
Roman state in words of his own, Fitterman speaks only in the readymade
discourse found by chance, verbatim, amidst the ruins of the imperial, American
marketplace. Fitterman teaches us that when in Rome, do as the Ramones do.
Clamber to the top of the tallest edifice in the city and, like a king, beat your
chest, roaring out against the circling biplanes. History has become the most
disquieting infomerical. --Christian Bok

Metroplis XXX is, any way you slice it, a 3-D (document/drama/dynamite)
surround-sound urbanity of now. What does it mean for an outstanding prosodic
precisionist of our time to push craft beyond all limits, to this realm of sheer
evidence and acoustics? If twentieth-century verse used quanta for measure,
today's is a prosody of "shotgun sequencing," (to quote Craig Venter) where
characterization means sales. Fitterman's is the first volume I've seen to embody
that challenge. An exhibitionary exuberance of stadium seating, priced to move.
-- Stacy Doris

Dead Prez and Their Thoughts On Revolution

<mailto:montfu65@hotmail.com>

    What is Revolution? "...When you think of the military or police you
    don't associate that with violence, but when you see ordinary people
    with weapons you automatically think of criminals because that's the
    capital; American system teaching that way of thinking. Revolution
    is based on the victims of a certain society; government, that
    recognizes that they are being used and abused by the system and its
    not in their best interest...." Stic

Dead Prez and Their Thoughts On Revolution
It's Bigger Than Hip Hop...

Public Enemy and X-Clan are often the groups Dead Prez is lumped into a
category with. They're classified as a political rappers; activist
rappers and alternative rappers. However if the time be taken out one
will find that these brothers are not just performing, playing a role or
creating or recreating a particular form/genre of rap. Dead Prez have
incorporated their politically charged lyrics into their daily works. M1
aka Mutulu Olubala is president of The National People's Democratic
Uhuru Movement (NYC branch), a grassroots organization that defends the
democratic rights of Africans. M1 as president works with NPDUM to
organize clothing drives, community dinners, mass rallies, and political
education classes in his community daily. Stic aka Khnum Olubala
trains/studies Ile-Ijala (Home of the Spiritual Warrior), an African
system of martial arts, in addition to organizing daily in his community.


I had the opportunity to build with Dead Prez on current conditions of
Africans in Amerikkka and revolution.

Question: What does dead prez mean in one sentence.
M1: All Power To The People!

Stic: We should not accept how shit is, if it's not working for us then
we should do something to change it.


What is Revolution?
M1: Revolution. Where I'm coming from, the critical part of
revolutionary struggle is concerned with taking power out of the hands
of people who stole it from us from all these years and returning back
those resources. It's going to be a conscious world wide struggle with
decisive victory won in the area of defeating capitalism and imperialism
which is our main enemy.

Stic: When people think of revolution they see only one version, which
is to be armed with weapons in order to enforce your way of life. When
you think of the military or police you don't associate that with
violence, but when you see ordinary people with weapons you
automatically think of criminals because that's the capital; American
system teaching that way of thinking. Revolution is based on the victims
of a certain society; government, that recognizes that they are being
used and abused by the system and its not in their best interest. When
you talk about revolution you're talking about seizing control over the
institutions that are oppressing the people such as the court system,
police department, military system and educational system all together.
Food and all the things needed for life are being exploited and people
recognize that you have to have control over these things, so revolution
is the process in which you seize that power and are able to get it and
keep it.


Do you consider yourself a revolutionary?

M1: No. I align myself with revolutionary struggle. I would not say I am
a revolutionary, that would be arrogant. Yet at the same time you have
to have people who consciously recognize themselves as revolutionaries.
And there are those people that I know who hold these positions 24 hours
a day; on call people who have dedicated their lives for years and
years. But, at the same time I'm just trying to do the best I can to
forward our struggles. I am a part of this movement.

Stic: I'm definitely a worker for that (revolutionary) process. I would
like to let my work identify me rather than myself. Of course I identify
with the revolutionary process, but that takes a lot discipline, vision,
hard work, self-sacrifice and courage that you develop along the path.


Question: How does the role you play in this revolutionary movement
transgress into your music?

M1: Well it's (music) a new form of communication. The tool that
transformed the Black Panther Party in 1966 was the Black Panther
newspaper. It had a readership similar to what the Source has today. I
think that's the role that we are faced with. It (communication) is a
very important tool, because that communication can be precise. It can
be a weapon and that's how it gets into our music. Dead Prez music is
comprehensive of the struggle; of what we learned in and out of the
movement. We try and give people a new eyes, you can look at things in a
certain perspective, and not recognize exactly where we stand. That's
our (Dead Prez) job. That's how it gets into the music. The most popular
way to communicate who we dealing with, that's Rap. Rap is talking to
everybody at every part of the earth right now.

Stic: It started almost 12 years ago, and I didn't consciously set out
for the type of music that I'm putting out. As I got older I understood
the severity; the effect that music and words have on one's mind. Now
that I'm more conscious, I can express any fact through my music. It's
not to make you dance (you can listen to any artist for that). I
remember when I was in high school, I wrote something for Black History
month and the impact that it had on people was remarkable. Parents,
teacher, school officials and even the NAACP got involved all because,
everyone wanted to know if do I have the right to be saying the things I
do. From there I had a responsibility to keep doing what i was doing
whether you can can relate to it or not. That's what my motivation is
here, seeing that we have to use everything that's out their to solve
our problems.


Are you happy with what Hip Hop has evolved to or do you think it like
the society we live in needs to be revolutionized?

M1: I think hip hop is revolution because more than anything else in the
world, even more than Lexus cars, even more than platinum chains it (hip
hop) manifests the world and is a total reflection of reality. It can
manifest itself so clearly as one thing. It can manifest itself as
revolutionary. It can't be trapped or contained.

Stic: I can't just pinpoint anything in society and just isolate it. I
have to look at what exacted hip hop. Once that is done then you can
understand what it is. If we want hip hop to be different, then we'll
have to change the conditions that produce it. I'm happy that hip hop is
continuous and not just financially. But, even though you make a lot of
money from it, you can make a lot of money from Crack, but it's fucking
up the community and don't produce any life. If a couple of people got
some money off it, o.k. but mostly the white people make money off it
and the Black people become addicts. The same with hip hop, I don't care
about the money, you want the hook up and the travel to communicate, if
you have an agenda. That's the good thing.

THE ALBUM


Explain the title of the album; "Let's Get Free".

M1: What the title does is bring you into the recognition that if you
think you free, they're obviously people out there who know that they're
not. So then apparently there's a choice that has got to be made. You
either need to investigate that or you're fine. And if it makes you
chose a side it does so in a non aggressive way. I think its (the album
title) not a turn off it's talking to the masses of those it does appeal
to. I think it evokes curiosity in people who don't see that sentiment
and don't think its true.

Stic: In alot of ways we are free but's thats only in day to day living.
We are not free in the sense the fear of doing what needs to be done or
the fear of the responsibility of life. Sometimes when people say we are
oppressed, we are enslaved, people say that's negative but really that's
just semantics. Today I am free that's why I struggle and resist
oppression. I don't need anyone to tell me when to eat or lock me up for
something they think I did. Politically I beg to differ in the views of
freedom. We are victims of a capitalist system. As workers we are
exploited. As people we have no power over our own lives. No
self-determination and no ability to reproduce the things we need for
ourselves. So we are dependent in people who historically have beaten
us, jailed us, lied to us etc. I don't see any freedom in that.


In the artic where the indigenous people sometimes might hunt a wolf
they'll take a double edge blade and they'll put blood on the blade and
melt the ice and stick the handle in the ice so only the blade is
protruding. And that a wolf who smells the blood and wants to eat will
come and lick the blade trying to eat and what happens is when the wolf
licks the blade he cuts his tongue and he bleeds and he thinks he's
really having a good meal and he drinks, and he licks and licks and of
course he's drinking his own blood and he kills himself. - Wolves (1st
track on "Let's Get Free").

Stic: That's the Chairman Omali from NPDUM (National Peoples Democratic
Uhuru Movement) speaking. It's about brothers having to hustle because
they don't have any money or opportunities that we're aware of. The
government pumps crack into the community to keep brothers down, such as
the Black Panthers, etc. Brothers feel its a bright idea when they see
they could get $50 from this little piece of glass rock product. When
you're able to eat when yesterday you wasn't, thats a real self-esteem
booster. That's a really hard thing to come down on people, but they
feel like their actually doing something for themselves but the effect
is like a wolf licking a blade, he's tasting the blood but he don't
realize that its his own blood. He's so blood thirsty, so hungry to eat.
It's not the wolfs fault, he got to eat just like everybody else, he's
been tricked into thinking the blade is opportunity. Brothers are
tricked into thinking that Crack-Cocaine is our opportunity and we're
licking the blade and the blood we're tasting is us in prison, getting
shot at parties and living in a military state. The Chairman says we
need to blame the hunter, the CIA, government; the people who set us up
in these conditions and robbed us from Africa and have been living off
of us since we got here; the people who really benefit from the drug
trade. The same crack-cocaine after a few years don't start to look
better, it looks fucked up. So the money is going somewhere, could it be
for more police officers? weapons? and all the new sophisticated
technology? That's what the intro to the album is represents. To look at
things for what they really are and stop licking the blade and start
using it.

M1: The analogy of the blade, it stands out stark. The chairman states,
I'm not a hunter but I've been told. It alludes to the hunt, the hunter
and the hunted. And even when there is no hunter present you find that
there these generated genocidal things. I think this is a great analogy
because it doesn't but the blame on the people. A lot of times we always
blame the people.


"I'm a African never was a African American." - I'm a African (2nd
track, "Let's Get Free")

M1: If you study Malcolm, he said he couldn't be American. "He was a
victim of Americanism, because if he was an American they (America)
wouldn't sick their dogs on you. If you was American you would have
rights." We're not American, that's the primary reason we go through
what we're going through. If you attach the name American to you, then
you must also be attaching the legacy of slave masters. We don't have
that legacy at all. To call yourself an African-American is silly. When
we was stolen from Africa we got on the boat Africans, so how the hell
we gonna get off the boat Americans. I think the identity with Africa
will help us see where our world resources are. We think we are poor,
but we are rich. We are rich not only in history and culture, but in
unity we have the richest land mass that we are all a part of.

Stic: The term African American has no meaning really because the name
has changed. In the past it was Afro-American, before that Negro, before
that it was Nigger, and somewhere in between it was just Black. We know
that Africa is where our ancestors originated. Human life on this planet
is the descendants of the people from the continent (Africa). Whether
you from Haiti, Puerto Rico, Jamaica, any place on the planet, this
(Africa) is our rightful home, it was robbed from us, it was and always
will be the home of black people.


The state is this organized bureaucracy, it is the police dept., it is
the army, the navy, it is the prison system, the courts. The state is a
repressive organization... The police become necessary in human society
at the junction in human society where there is a split between those
who have and those who don't. - Police State (5th track, "Let Get Free").

M1: People don't recognize the state because its an abstract. The state
emerges itself in the material world when you begin to try and get
power. If you want to get food stamps you got to go the state or to be a
part of program that want to help or assist your well being. Its the
state that monitors all those resources. It's the state that steps
between a domestic dispute against a man and women, the state puts
police in schools, the state is what comes in and takes children away
from their parents. It's a repressive organization especially when you
talk about getting power in your own hands. The state would be the first
people who arrive at your front door to tell you in one form or another
that you can't have it (power). The state works for rich people. Those
who control the state are those who run all institutions, schools; gov't
buildings; and major commercial institutions. If there were no classes
there would be no reason for state. If we all shared alike there would
be no need for this all together body who comes and represents one
interest of one class.

Stic: Police State explains who the police are, because people get
caught up in the television version of police in society. In every
society that you live in there's an Uncle Tom, for N.Y.C. it's Al
Sharpton. People say we need to fire the crooked cops and may pinpoint
one or two. Chairman Omali says, whether you lock me up nicely or beat
my ass and lock me up, you're still locking me up. The reason for that
is some people have and some people don't, which requires the people
that don't have nothing to have to resort to breaking (the rules of) the
people who have shit. The people who have shit are making these rules
because they wanna keep the shit that they have and their not trying to
share, but what they got they got from what they're accusing you of. If
you break into a bank because you need money, or go into a grocery store
for a piece of bread because you're hungry the police will call you a
thief. But, they stole us from Africa, stole our labor, still stealing
from us by paying us minimum wage while the companies are making
millions of dollars. So the bottom line is officers fake friendly or the
real raw deal vice squad that role like terrorist are here to keep the
people at the bottom of society. They are the armed forces in our
communities that kill young black teenagers and say the Crips and Bloods
do it (gang bangin').


What impact do you see Dead Prez having on the people?

Stic: How much impact has the people had on us is the question. I feel
that the interaction that I've had with people is what's gonna be
expressed in my lyrics. I'm just thankful that I had the opportunity to
reflect the view of others and get the people to interact with us
because you know we're not perfect and maybe if others can relate to our
music then we can all learn something.

Poem, oops.  Right.




Dear friends -

Now it's your turn to give the orders.
All right, I said. Tell me to put my hands up.
Plunge your hand in water up to the wrist;
Gaze into & note what it is you soon will miss
The glacier knocks in the oil tanker the desert sighs in my head,
And the crack in the gas tank opens a lane to the land of the dead.

Happy New Year's!  I'm about to head out with the boys on patrol.
Happy New Year's!  In about an hour we will be hit by an ambush.
Happy New Year's.  This is the last letter I will every write you.
Happy New Year's.  The absence of my right hand is not the right hand of
absence.
Happy New Year's.  My boss tells me you can fool enough of the people
all of the time.
Happy New Year's.  Someone said something about freedom.

Should my old right hand be lost
can it not be brought to mind?
Should my old right hand be lost
we'll take a shot of kindness yet
And here's a hand, my trusted friend,
in the dirt, and give a hand of yours
You took a shot of kindness yet
And you're dead face down in the dirt.

Jon

I enjoyed this - if this poet can be compared to Marvell he is an
extraordinary poet - there is something magical and intense about
Marvell -somethng marvelous - the joke is inevitable -

But 'The Garden'  I just re-read it, it is a great poem. Your Scottish poet
is
also subtle with words and syntax - I was amused by "a war the surrealists
won " ! The surrealists also seemed to have had a hand since that time -
well we can go back to 9/11 but probably earlier.

Very interesting stuff here. Thanks.

Subject: A neglected poet: Sean Rafferty


A great poet, I think, can not be defined, but can always be recognized.
Typical characteristics may include the ability to speak of private joy or
misery with universal validity, a voice which vividly incarnates its owner's
personality in every line, an unstrained mastery of all the various
linguistic
and cultural traditions of which any poet is the product, and perhaps most
telling of all, a dawning awareness on the part of the reader that here are
poems not so much to be read as to be lived with.

The Scottish poet Sean Rafferty by all these criteria is unmistakably a
great
poet.  At the time of his death in 1993 he had published very little, though
his poetry won the admiration of such important poets as Ted Hughes and
Sorley
MacLean, and the posthumous issuance of his collected poems by the
prestigious
British publisher Carcanet attracted little attention.  Such neglect is
incomprehensible, since his poetry surely evinces all the qualities of
greatness which I have just mentioned.  The universalizaton of personal
grief,
one of the oldest and most important functions of poetry, is achieved with
heartbreaking success in a group of early pieces on loss which, like most of
his poems, are untitled.   Here, for example, are some verses on the death
of
the poet's first wife in 1945:

        In May the month of miracle
        flower on the black bough
        flower on the green leaf;
        in May the flower the frost the fall
        the month of May is all my grief.

        The white hawthorn the lilac massed
        to dwarf my mourning where I passed;
        they were like alien angels come
        before their time to greet her home

        Too early come the cruel frost
        that claimed my love too early lost
        their promise for a tribute gave
        and wept their flowers into her grave.

We can discern behind the seemingly artless accents of these lines a
characteristic diction and technique which is learnedly traditional yet
staunchly modernistic:  that second stanza would not seem out place in
Frost,
nor would the third in Marvell, yet they still seem easily compatible with
each other.  Also typical of this poet is the slight, deliberate
idiosyncrasy
of syntax and punctuation -- for instance, the lack of a verb in the first
three lines of the first stanza, the omitted commas in the next two lines,
and
the lack of a conjunction in the first line of the next stanza -- minor and
deliberate irregularities which give a startling extra dimension to the
poetic
voice, a voice which expresses, with intense emotion under utter control, a
vision in which the external world becomes not merely symbolic of the poet's
emotions, but fused into identity with them, as for instance in the image of
the flowering trees which dwarf human pain.

           Similar qualities distinguish Rafferty's several poems on the
lost
innocence of childhood, of which 'On the green hill of childhood keep...' I
would rank with Dylan Thomas's 'Fern Hill' as one of our definitive
statements
of the theme. It is very hard not to quote the whole of this wonderful poem,
but perhaps its ending lines will suggest how Rafferty has achieved the
miracle of writing about childhood with deep feeling unmarred by
sentimentality, as well as how skillfully he can give his poems added
intellectual resonance by positioning them within specific traditions, in
this
case by deft allusions to Marvell's The Garden:

                Run where you will
        you cannot trespass, if you fall you fall
        only where grass is soft; though ripe fruits reach
        into your mouth they do not tempt but teach
        a simple lesson and no sin to eat:
        the sloe how bitter but the bramble sweet.

(Compare Marvell:

       What wondrous life is this I lead!
       Ripe apples drop about my head;
       The luscious clusters of the vine
       Upon my mouth do crush their wine;
       The nectarine and curious peach
       Into my hands themselves do reach;
       Stumbling on melons as I pass,
       Ensnared with flowers, I fall on grass.)


        The timelessness of much of Rafferty's verse is demonstrated in an
elegiac
ballad on old William Woolsery, which could almost have been written at
anytime in the past four centuries but which does not sound in the least
artificially archaic.  "An old man mumbling in a public bar" (these poems
seem
full of old men and they are all tough and touchy and flawed and kind and
beautiful) gives us one of our literature's classic statements on the
sameness
of all wars:  it is what "The Battle of Blenheim" might have been if "The
Battle of Blenheim" were not ghastly.  War is also the theme of "1945" and
"1959," which present a horrifying vision of past and present hellishly
jumbled together both physically and culturally in the urban landscape of
London after World War II, which Rafferty unforgettably calls "a war the
surrealists won."

        It must not be thought, however, that such melancholy themes exhaust
Rafferty's poetic range:  he is also capable of producing some of the most
splendid comic verse of the century.  High points of his work in this manner
include "A Near Thing," a sort of combination of P. G. Wodehouse and Noel
Coward with a touch of Samuel Beckett, and "Liebestod," perhaps the most
puzzlingly hilarious poem in English since "The Aged Aged Man," which gives
us
among much else the (deliberately Betjemanesque?) lines:

        Simile to me, smile to me
        speak with your smile to me,
        speak to me over the din;
        Oh how I wish I was oiling your bicycle
        then we could go for a spin

That, like all high comic verse, stays funny no matter how many times you
read
it.

I hope these samples  will at least make defensible my contention that this
poet, who is in none of the major reference works or anthologies, belongs in
them all.

This I feel is an important discussion  - I repeat it here - there is  =
lot to be said on this and related, and ok some views here are a bit =
extreme - but it is an indicator of one way that the Language poets are =
being seen -and some of the pitfalls that language poetry etc can lead =
into (or perhaps we lead ourselves  by toomuh limitig our deifinitions =
of whoa and what constitues a lnaguage poet - the term is not =
particularly specific (its perhaps convenient if imprecise) - the =
interview below was something a bit off the cuff event (I wasn't there - =
and I haven't reproduced it in full) and  not one of  those "considered" =
things - but does - I think - still shed some light - if only on one =
"angle' and the lightof a few "viewers" or readers of language poetry - =
of course it is only a few peoples' views - note that some of the =
language poets - Bernstein at least appeared in the predecessor to =
"Brief" (in which the interview below was published ) when it was "A =
Brief History of the Whole World" edited by Alan Loney (who has since =
left NZ), the second editor, John Geraets - widened the scope of the =
journal, and its present editor Jack Ross widened it further but I feel =
the quality is still there and also its relatively "innovative" nature   =
eg I put an entirely hand written thing in which was part of a book =
length - poem - the book and the poem really cant be separated - a no =
beginning no ending..with no full stops and does start with a capital, =
kind of flows like a river - intuitive, ingenious, from my deep =
subconscious genius (!), a one off book that was "intended" to be only =
in the particular note book I had it in (literally only this one  - =
totally unique (what is unique? - everything or nothing?) - material =
object in the Universe  - and out side of that and not in my hand =
writing it is another book) - a kind of (first) edition - a totally =
unique edition - people said the idea was good !! Ideas - and the =
contributors are - and always have been a varied lot - although =
initially Wystan Curnow and others formed a more or less closed group =
"The Writers Group" and it went basically - although I subscribed from =
the beginning - to each of them and the editor published everything they =
all contributed -  and thus this relatively innovative and unusual =
writing - given the small number of lit mags in NZ was able to start) - =
and that was ok  - but the format changed a little after Alan Loney left =
for Australia. Wystan Curnow (who many of the people in the language =
poetic and "postmodern" scene may know) has just won an award in NZ for =
his contributions to Art and Literature - and has also begun a new Art =
Gallery in central Auckland.=20

Here  is the original message again that got overlooked as it was in =
with a lot of trivia about Bernstein's poem/reading being "sexy" etc

Someone in reference to Bernstein's "sexy" poem was lamenting that =
people claim to understand language poetry but they don't really and so =
on, or they hate it and shouldn't  -that maybe:  but here are some =
thoughts on language poetry and some of the Language poets  -

There is no question that Charles Bernstein is a brilliant poet - I =
recall
studying his poem that started:

On a broad plane on a universe of
anterooms, making signals in the dark, you
fall down on  your waistband & carrying your
own plate, a last serving, set out for
another glimpse of a gaze. In a room

Even in that short start to "Matters of Policy"  ( a book that has a =
kind of
political subtext and other things going on.) - there is a lot to think
about - the "cosmicness" is undercut shortly as the poem progresses but =
there are already "references ", puns, multiplex meanings etc - eg =
"waist band" might be a code for "The Waste Land", 'ante' may be a pun =
(for anti) .The "gaze" has smooth to do with Baudrillard -haven't read =
anything by him but the term "the gaze - supposedly from an idea of =
Baudrillard's - is very much used in poetics discussions these days...).
The title is multiplex in meaning or at least in its stance, its
connotations - other poems by Bernstein - in the book the poem was in =
-had fragmented sentences (it seems possible to connect the fragments =
sometimes -
but it becomes  like a complex sematic jig saw puzzle that is perhaps - =
is
hopefully - unsolvable: (the poetic tactic against "clarity" or
"transparency") and there some fascinating insights, and ideas  - so I =
was
very interested and still am in what the language poets (and their
descendents and fellow travellers) -if they can be put in any "box" - =
were
(are) doing.

I 'introduced' some of my younger friends to "language poetry" and my =
friend Scott Hamilton took a great interest in Coolidge and the poem =
that goes "trilobites trilobite" (in "In the American Tree") and so on =
and the
discussion on the "New Sentence" by Silliman (backgrounded by concepts =
from Stein etc) - I was very keen on Ron Silliman's work such as =
"Tjanting"
"Paradise" and others - and also we liked the critical writing of
Perloff  -in fact Scott got into reading Wittgenstein from reading
"Wittgenstein's Ladder" by Perloff. We also found Antin's "talk poems" =
very
interesting as an experience and a method - BUT

In 2001 it seemed that Perloff's support of the invasion of Afghanistan =
(to
make sure that America wasn't destroyed and then we wouldn't have any
culture in the US to talk about: that is kill the Arabs before they =
destroy
the greatland of poetry -war for poetry seemed to be her idea...)  and =
some
of Antin's responses were worrying - he talked of (or seemed to be =
talking
of)  exterminating the Arabs - made some remarks that they were "rats' =
to be got rid of and so on (I'm feel sure he made such remarks but it =
was some time ago, the details may be quite wrong ... but I'm certain =
that was the tenor of some of the ideas expressed by these leading =
language poets) - and that was 2001 and not long after S/11 and  =
everyone was a bit crazy - I know it affected me here even in New =
Zealand: in fact it kind of re-politicised me. Scott moved toward =
Marxist politics and said he couldn't now read Silliman's work knowing =
his political views - now I feel that was rather extreme - but here is =
an interview or part of it published recently in NZ
magazine called Brief where views on the language poets (and other =
matters) are thrown around - I feel Scott is a bit hard on Silliman - as =
far as I know Hamish hasn't looked at epc for  a while and maybe Andrews =
has shifted his "Marxist " positions etc  But here is the excerpt:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------=
---
------------------------

Hamish:  For me, landscape is always something which is inanimate. And =
it is usually malign...remember, I moved about in China itself, moved =
from the
sticks to the coast and took jobs teaching English, without the =
literature
thing. Finished my Masters' thesis off in China.

Scott: Bruce Andrews?

Hamish:  Bruce Andrews.

Scott:  What'd you end up thinking about his work? It might not have =
been so bad studying a poet of dissonance and disjunction in such an =
alien
environment.

Hamish:  Well, Andrews is working with the violence and dissonance of
American society. Social breakdown, breakdowns in communication. Often =
he works by writing down phrases he hears, overhears, and tries to shape =
them, relate them, without necessarily making 'sense'. The question is =
whether he is not simply reproducing the violence that gives him his =
material...The Language poets offer us a whole range of models, formal =
models, but I don't see the need to accept the programme, to buy the =
whole package. Take what you can use. I particularly like Susan Howe.

Scott:  I agree with that attitude. Some of the critical writing of Ron
Silliman, for instance, is incredibly dogmatic. He almost outlaws =
everything
except his 'New Sentence'. A particular form is fetishised as =
oppositional,
subversive yadaya, but the impact of any literary form always depends on
context. After a few books of Silliman's I felt that a rhymed sonnet =
would
be more subversive than another 'new' sentence. And of course the only
people who were using the new revolutionary formula happened to live in =
the richest societies in the world. So the form was imperiocentric.

This is bit glib - and assumes eg that language poetry is or was always =
'subversive' (without explaining how - the problem for me was not The =
New Sentence per se - but _how_ it was oppositional  or "subversive:and =
more perhaps why such a form was"challenging" as opposed to say  "The =
New Paragraph" especially if paragraphs are 'more emotional' than =
sentences - but haven't read The New Sentence for some time...someone =
may have some ideas on these things) but also I'm not sure that the =
comment "form always depends on context" is relevant here or right, or =
quite put in the right way - but it leads to the next part of the =
interview. I'll leave that in - just noticed that in fact Scott says: =
"The _ impact _ of form always depends on context" and that is more to =
the mark perhaps...

Hamish:  I can't comment on Silliman, but Andrews has a solid background =
in Marxism, political economy. He's hardcore. That's one of the things =
that
makes him interesting...but Silliman, I've never been that into him...a =
bit
dry?

Scott:  I thought the bankruptcy of Silliman and one or two others - =
David
Antin and Marjorie Perloff are names that come to mind - was shown after =
S/11, when they suddenly morphed into unpaid military advisors to George
Dubya.

Hamish:  Really? On the EPC list? I haven't checked that for years...

Scott:  If you were against the invasion of Afghanistan Silliman called =
you
an appeaser. The enemy was Islamofascism. Antin actually talked about =
rats, and having to do an extermination job...understandable responses =
from ordinary Americans, maybe, but not quite what you'd expect from the
Patriachs of the Oppositional Word.

Hamish:  Most of the Chinese that I talked to had little sympathy with =
the
US after S 11. In fact many were happy. They saw it as the US getting =
paid
back a little for what it's done so often. If the US ever invades China, =
it
will make Iraq look like a cakewalk. The Chinese would just run out of =
their
homes and fight the US troops, with anything they've got. Forks and =
knives
off the table if they had nothing else. They hate America.

Scott:  You've written academic or semi-academic stuff on other people?

Hamish:  Leigh Davis, a couple of pieces, the second of which takes =
issue
with the commodification of language in his work...I'm keen on Joanna =
Paul
and have written a bit on her. I'm interested in anyone who's =
experimenting
with language in a disciplined manner. Innovative but also crafted work.

Scott:  Do you value craft above inspiration, or vice versa, or is the
opposition too old-fashioned to be bothered about?

Hamish:  Inspiration is a craft. Next question.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------=
---
-------------------------

I am not quite in complete accord with Scott - he forces the argument =
for
the interview - but am with him in the main points made.

thought the following appropriate to post:


Guy Davenport on Wittgenstein

Wittgenstein before he came to philosophy was a mathematician, an
architect, a sculptor, a mechanical engineer, a grade-school teacher,
a soldier, and an aviator. He could have followed any of these careers
doubtless with brilliant success; just before he came to Cambridge
(they gave him a doctorate at the door) he was strongly inclined to
``be an aeronaut.'' Every account of his strange life indicates that
he tried to teach. He did not dine with the faculty, as the faculty in
all its grandeur always dines in academic gowns, black shoes, and neck
tie. Wittgenstein was forever tieless and wore a suede jacket that
opened and closed with that marvelous invention: the zipper; and his
shoes were brown. He held his lectures in his rooms, in the
continental manner. As there was no furniture except an army cot, a
folding chair, a safe (for the Zettel), and a card table, the students
brought their own chairs. Philosophy classrooms in our century have
frequently been as dramatic as stages: Santayana, Samuel Alexander,
Bergson --- men of passionate articulateness whose lectures fell on
their students like wind and rain. But Wittgenstein, huddled in
silence on his chair, stammered quietly from time to time. He was
committed to absolute honesty. Nothing --- nothing at all --- was to
escape analysis. He had nothing up his sleeve; he had nothing to
teach. The world was an absolute puzzle, a great lump of opaque pig
iron. Can we think about the lump? What is thought? What is the
meaning of can, can we, of can we think? What is the meaning of we? If
we answer these questions on Monday, are the answers valid on Tuesday?
If I answer them at all, do I think the answer, believe the answer,
know the answer, or imagine the answer?

It was apparently not of the least interest to Wittgenstein that Plato
had answered certain questions that philosophers need to ask, or that
Kant or Mencius had answered them. He sometimes liked other
philosophers' questions; he seems never to have paid any attention to
their answers. Truth was stubborn; Wittgenstein was stubborn; and
neither faced the other down. We have to look back to the stoic
Musonius to find another man so nakedly himself, so pig-headedly
single-minded. He actually taught very little of his life. He was
forever going off into the Norwegian forests, to Russia, to the west
of Ireland where --- and this is all we know of these solitudes --- he
taught the Connemara birds to come and sit in his hands. He mastered
no convention other than speech, wearing clothes, and --- grudgingly
and with complaint --- the symbols of mathematics. The daily chores of
our life were wonders to him, and when he participated in them they
became as strange as housekeeping among the Bantu. ...

Wittgenstein did not argue; he merely thought himself into subtler and
deeper problems The record which three of his students have made of
his lectures and conversations at Cambridge discloses a man tragically
honest and wonderfully, astoundingly absurd. In every memoir of him we
meet a man we are hungry to know more about, for even if his every
sentence remains opaque to us, it is clear that the archaic
transparency of his thought is like nothing that philosophy has seen
for thousands of years. It is also clear that he was trying to be wise
and to make others wise. He lived in the world, and for the world. He
came to believe that a normal, honest human being could not be a
professor. It is the academy that gave him his reputation of
impenetrable abstruseness; never has a man deserved a reputation less.
Disciples who came to him expecting to find a man of incredibly deep
learning found a man who saw mankind held together by suffering alone,
and he invariably advised them to be as kind as possible to others. He
read, like all inquisitive men, to multiply his experiences. He read
Tolstoy (always getting bogged down) and the Gospels and bales of
detective stories. He shook his head over Freud. When he died, he was
reading Black Beauty. His last words were: ``Tell them I've had a
wonderful life.''

-- Guy Davenport
from The Geography of the Imagination


from Charles A. Ralston's website:
"arrived the morning of Tuesday 4 January 2005, in Lexington, Kentucky
at the University of Kentucky Lucille Parker Markey Cancer Center. He
was in his 77th year, born 23 November 1927 in Anderson, South
Carolina.  He was the kindest, most thoughtful, most considerate
person I ever have known.  His intelligence was his vision of a world
he shared willingly and joyously  with anyone curious enough to ask a
question or bold enough to share his own view of a story, a painting,
a drawing.  Nature loves to hide, the professor said over and over,
reminding us of Heraclitus. To be interested in any one thing will
lead one eventually to be interested in many things.  The most
beautiful image to our eyes is often a random gathering of objects.
The highest form of criticism of a work of art is -- another work of
art made in response to former. In nearness is chaos; distance
provides balance and clarity (to our human relations).  The heart is
comfortable with the familiar, the known; the intelligence with the
strange and unknown. Above all, with apologies to Confucius and Uncle
Ez, each day strive to 'make it new'.  The informed writers and poets
of our time in due course will write encomia about Guy Davenport and
critical essays about his work.  But, the cats living in Lexington's
Bell Court today will have to find another curious professor with whom
to share their thoughts."

That's excellent Maria.  I particularly like "Reveal Codes" and "tiny

unfold and making comments: "I think it's for an aisle" ("x (exoxial)

There'd been talk of tsunamis/earthquakes, so I post the following..


Friends,

Having previously directed a progressive aid organization, Grassroots
International, I'm often asked who I would donate to in a humanitarian
disaster such as the present one.  Several years ago, prompted by GDAE
Co-director Neva Goodwin, I wrote up some guidelines for how I think
progressive people in the US should think about helping in such
crises.  I revised it very slightly and I attach it to this message in
the event you might find it useful.  I also forward below Grassroots
International's current appeal, which is a creative and thoughtful
application of the kinds of principles I outline.  Grassroots does not
have programs in the region, and to its credit it is not
ambulance-chasing by pretending it does.  Instead it is helping the
international farmers' organization, Via Campesina, raise funds for
the relief efforts of its local affiliates in the affected region.=20
Please circulate this as you see fit.

Tsunami Aid: Support Fisherfolk and Peasant Communities' Grassroots
Relief Efforts

Indonesia's National Federation of Peasant Organizations (FSPI) and
Sri Lanka's National Organization of Fisherfolk (NAFSO) have organized
rescue and relief teams in Aceh and North Sumatra Indonesia and in
isolated communities in Sri Lanka. Other local organizations of
fisherpeople, farmers, and indigenous people around the rim of the
Indian Ocean are launching similar efforts in their own home towns.

With decades of community work, they have built strong, representative
membership organizations in their communities. These organizations can
make sure aid is used not to deepen poverty and dependency, but to
build viable rural livelihoods. Their on-the-ground networks make them
good candidates to relieve logistical bottlenecks and navigate complex
politics; they have an agility and a knowledge of the local scene that
no international aid organization can match. Grassroots International,
with over 20 years of experience in progressive international
development and human rights work is proud to support their
life-giving and social change efforts.

Humanitarian Crises: What is a Progressive to Do?
Some guidelines for progressive donors
By Timothy A. Wise

Progressive-minded people who want to contribute to humanitarian aid
efforts too often abandon their progressive principles, particularly
in crisis situations.  Why?  They want to help, and they want to do so
quickly.  And they focus on the service-delivery =E2=80=93 food rations,
medicines, shelter =E2=80=93 rather than the service deliverers.  Natural
enough, when people are starving in front of you on your television
every night.

The problem is that aid goes not to projects or services but first to
service providers, the agencies themselves.  And aid is power.  Those
who get more aid end up stronger than those who don't.  The issue that
I think progressive-minded people should always keep in mind is how
their donation is affecting the relative power of different groups
involved in a crisis situation.  In other words, when the crisis is
over, who do you want to be stronger as an institution, and therefore
better able to address or avert such crises in the future?

Here are a few guidelines I like to use:

1.=09Support agencies that build local capacities and institutions=E2=80=93=
 Some
aid agencies, including most of the largest and best-known in the US,
are "operational", that is, they set up offices in-country and provide
services themselves, often hiring large numbers of local residents to
work for them.  Operational agencies often weaken local institutions,
drawing qualified staff out of relatively weak local organizations.=20
This is true even if there is a fair amount of skill and/or
technology-transfer in the process, because the transfer is individual
rather than institutional.  By contrast, some aid agencies work
primarily through local partner institutions.  Wherever possible,
support those.
2.=09If possible, support institutions whose involvement pre-dates the
crisis =E2=80=93 There are a lot of ambulance-chasers in crisis-response wo=
rk.
 Those who arrive late lack strong local ties, are often culturally
insensitive, and don't really know how to get things done.  By
contrast, agencies that have been working with local groups on
non-crisis activities are well-grounded, sensitive, and can get things
done.
3.=09Support privately funded initiatives =E2=80=93 The US government is th=
e
largest aid provider in this country and it now contracts much of that
work out to US-based aid agencies.  More than half the budgets of most
of the largest US-based aid agencies come from the US government.  So
what?  Well, first, your money is relatively less important to such
efforts, which tend to be multimillion-dollar activities.  Second,
those agencies naturally tend to be accountable mainly to the US
government, not to its private donors or, more important, to the local
community it serves.  Third, official US aid programs are among the
most political in the world, hewing to State Department objectives and
guidelines first and humanitarian guidelines and needs second (or
third or fourth).  USAID brags that 75% of all its aid comes back to
the US =E2=80=93 paying US consultants, buying US products, etc.  Is that w=
hat
you want to support?  This doesn't mean all US-government-funded aid
is bad; not at all.  But you as a donor have a choice.  Why choose
that?
4.=09Small is beautiful =E2=80=93 The aid industry is dominated by the larg=
est
agencies, which compete for and win government contracts and can then
spend massive amounts of money promoting themselves to the US public
highlighting how low their overhead is.  Of course, their overhead is
low because they're getting multimillion-dollar US contracts.  You
have a choice; why strengthen the largest and strongest groups?  Many
of the smaller and lesser-known agencies do great work.  And the last
thing Rwanda or Haiti needs are aid agencies with more resources and
power in-country than the government.
5.=09Be internationalist =E2=80=93 In addition to supporting small, private=
ly
funded, partner-oriented activities, consider agencies with strong
international ties to other such agencies.  European and Canadian
agencies, including some of the largest ones, are much more
progressive and effective in practice than their US counterparts.=20
Oxfam US, for example, is part of a large and growing network of Oxfam
International affiliates who co-fund each other's work in areas where
each is strong.  The partnership model is much more common in Europe
and Canada than it is here.  And their governments do not put the same
kinds of strings on aid as USAID does.
6.=09Medical aid in a crisis is often more important than food, shelter,
or other assistance =E2=80=93 Why?  Food and other goods are needed on a sc=
ale
so massive it is difficult to have much of an impact with a private
donation.  It usually comes from governments and international
agencies.  Local public-health institutions, however, which are often
weak and underfunded to begin with, are always overwhelmed in a
crisis.  Refugee camps and feeding centers are breeding grounds for
disease, which usually take more lives than starvation or exposure
(though they are obviously related).
7.=09Think beyond the immediate crisis =E2=80=93 Where possible, look for g=
roups
that will stay with the issue and the people after the headlines (and
the funding streams) die down.
8.=09If you find a good agency, consider making a long-term commitment
to it =E2=80=93 Crisis-driven funding makes nonprofit aid agencies difficul=
t
to manage.  It also often leads agencies to focus on crisis-response
work at the expense of long-term local institution-building, which is
the most important work of all but the hardest to fund.  Long-term
support for such work is the hardest find.  If you like the work you
see during the crisis, you'll probably like the agency's other work as
well.  Support it with a multi-year commitment.
9.=09Last (but usually first on donors' minds) support agencies that
make effective use of funds =E2=80=93 Overhead is not the only issue here, =
or
the most important.  Look for a track record of accountability.  Make
sure there is the capacity to carry out what's being promised.

I think it’s a fine poem and I’m not interested in
knocking it, but I don’t think it’s remotely “cutting
edge,” nor do I think it took much bravery or courage
to write.

And I’m inclined to agree with Steve that there’s some
name-power behind its force (and while I greatly
admire the Language movement (and Bernstein), as a
young man (26) and an outsider, I find claims for the
validity and/or efficacy of the movement’s (or
scene’s) critique of identity, authority, etc, quite
inexplicable)).

This said, it clearly meant a lot to you Mr. Conrad,
and that is wonderful and I’m glad you’ve expressed
your delight.

I would second that, though Pagemaker, either 6.5 or 7, is also good and a
little easier to master. It also comes with a built-in booklet-making
utility.

&gt;SWITCHBACK — Call for Submissions — Second Issue, &quot;Confession vs.
&gt;Mask&quot;
&gt;
&gt;The editors of SWITCHBACK are now accepting submissions for our
&gt;second issue. The theme is &quot;Confession vs. Mask,&quot; writing that
&gt;explores the presence or absence of the narrator or author. Writers
&gt;play with authorial voice in different ways, hiding or exploiting
&gt;their own attitudes and experiences, exploring not only the realms
&gt;of the characters, but the idea of the author as character,
&gt;storyteller, or critic. We're seeking fiction, nonfiction, and
&gt;poetry in a variety of narrative voices and styles, as well as short
&gt;critical essays that present one perspective on the topic
&gt;&quot;Confession vs. Mask.&quot;
&gt;
&gt;The deadline for submissions is February 21, 2005.
&gt;
&gt;GENERAL GUIDELINES:
&gt;We prefer pieces that have not been previously published.
&gt;Simultaneous submissions are acceptable, although please inform us
&gt;if you have sent your piece elsewhere. Due to the online nature of
&gt;the magazine, shorter pieces are preferred (1,000-3,000 words or
&gt;less), although longer pieces of exceptional writing will also be
&gt;considered.
&gt;All critical essays must address the topic &quot;Confession vs.
Mask&quot; and
&gt;be less than 2,000 words. Works in other genres are not required to
&gt;address the topic. Submissions should be sent as standard text in
&gt;the body of an email with the genre (fiction, nonfiction, critical
&gt;essay, or poetry) in the subject line to: submissions at swback
&gt;dotcom.
&gt;
&gt;Due to the process of blind selection, include your name in the
&gt;email, but not in the body of the text.
&gt;The next issue will be released in Spring 2005.
&gt;
&gt;SWITCHBACK is a publication of the Master of Fine Arts in Writing
&gt;Program of the University of San Francisco, Deborah Lichtman and
&gt;Aaron Shurin, Co-Directors. SWITCHBACK is a forum for the writers of
&gt;USF's MFA community, including alumni, students, and faculty, as
&gt;well as the wider literary community, in the areas of fiction,
&gt;nonfiction, poetry, and critical essays.
&gt;We look forward to reading your work.

&gt;Subject: FOR SALE: Wessex Bookstore
&gt;Date: Mon, 3 Jan 2005 19:16:57 -0700
&gt;
&gt;January 3, 2005
&gt;
&gt;Dear Customers,
&gt;
&gt;When I opened Wessex on El Camino several weeks before Christmas in
&gt;1975, a few years out of college, I never imagined I would still be
&gt;selling books well into the next century. I knew that I loved books
&gt;-- loved finding them, reading them, organizing them, and even
&gt;selling them -- and opening a shop seemed like the perfect way to
&gt;spend my time. In the world of books was where I wanted to live --
&gt;in 1975 the VCR, the CD, the internet, email, and cell phones were
&gt;barely gleams in someone else's eyes --  and it's still certainly a
&gt;place I never want to or plan to leave.
&gt;
&gt;That said, after almost thirty years of running Wessex I've reached
&gt;the point in my life where I would like a change, and so I've
&gt;decided to put the business up for sale. My youngest will be
&gt;graduating from Paly this June; for that and a number of reasons the
&gt;time is right for me to explore something new.
&gt;
&gt;Building and managing a bookshop has been a very satisfying thing to
&gt;have done: always varied and interesting, full of fun and discovery,
&gt;and the basis for a broadly endless education. I've had a million
&gt;wonderful books and thousands of wonderful customers pass through
&gt;the doors here, leaving together to make good homes for each other.
&gt;I'd very much like that process to continue under someone else's
&gt;management for, say, another thirty years, or even into the next
&gt;century. I need your help finding that person.
&gt;
&gt;In addition to a three-decade-old, widespread reputation for
&gt;excellence, the assets of the business include roughly 75,000
&gt;carefully selected books and 6,000 LPs, a well-established web site
&gt;at wessexbooks.com with 20,000 catalogued titles, listings on
&gt;multiple other internet selling sites, and all the fixtures and
&gt;everything else necessary to run the shop and its web branches,
&gt;including (if needed and wanted) free lifetime tech support from me.
&gt;
&gt;If you or someone you know is curious and crazy and wise enough to
&gt;be seriously interested, please write. I'm hoping to complete a sale
&gt;in the next couple of months .  .  .
&gt;
&gt;Sincerely,
&gt;Tom Haydon
&gt;Wessex Books
&gt;558 Santa Cruz Ave
&gt;Menlo Park CA 94025
&gt;650-321-1333
&gt;store@wessexbooks.com
&gt;
&gt;PS: For those of you holding Wessex trade credit slips: while I
&gt;would expect any buyer of the store to honor all trade slips after a
&gt;sale, I would also suggest that you should perhaps spend existing
&gt;credit sooner rather than later.

does ms. houlihan ever say anything different when she pretends to review contemporary poetry?  why circulate this to this list when it won't tell us anything we already don't know.   the thoughts of a small person are usually small.

personally, i recognize Bruce Andrews after the third word.  she should be like a critic who didn't minimalism and color field painting.  you just haven't earned yet, baby!

Dear Mr. Rothenberg,

I read with interest your Call for Assistance on the Poetics Listserv, and I
writing to see if this might of interest to you: I have just completed a new
translation of The Gulistan, a masterpiece of 13th century Persian
literature, by Saadi. My translation is based on the 1880s translation done
by Edward Rehatsek. Persian literature, in translation, of course, was
profoundly influential in English and American literary circles. Emerson
called The Gulistan a secular bible; Thoreau wrote about Saadi in his
journals; Byron called Saadi a Persian Catullus. John D Yohanan has traced
the relationship between Persian poetry and English literature in a book
called, I believe, Persian Poetry in America and England: A 200 Year
History. (Or something like that--unfortunately, I am emailing you from some
place where I cannot look the precise title up.) I'm not sure in what form
exactly you envision the assistance you are calling, but I offer what little
expertise I have acquired in this area since I began working on these
translations. You can find out more about what I have done on my website:
www.richardjnewman.com.

Cheers and best wishes for the new year.

Richard Newman

-----Original Message-----
From: UB Poetics discussion group [mailto:POETICS@LISTSERV.BUFFALO.EDU] On
Behalf Of Jerome Rothenberg
Sent: Wednesday, January 05, 2005 1:06 PM
To: POETICS@LISTSERV.BUFFALO.EDU
Subject: Millennium Three: A Call for Assistance

This is to let a number of you know that I'm starting -- indefatigably -- on
a new project of some size: a Romantic and postromantic (including early
modern) gathering conceived as a nineteenth-century sequel or prequel to
Poems for the Millennium.  My co-editor and the true originator of the
project is Jeffrey Robinson, whom some of you may know already as a scholar
of English Romanticism and a marvelous voice in connecting that germinal
moment and movement to the most innovative and radical poetries of our own
time and place.  The publisher, as with Poems for the Millennium, will be
the University of California Press.

Our plan is to trace a line or several lines of work -- both poetry and
poetics -- from the late eighteenth-century post-enlightenment to the early
twentieth-century eruption of experimental and avant-garde modernism.  Like
what Pierre Joris and I did in Poems for the Millennium, such a gathering,
as we conceive it, would be international in scope (with a focus, for
obvious reasons, on all of Europe and all of the Americas) and would attempt
to restore a sense of the revolutionary and transformative nature of
Romanticism and postromanticism as they were at the time of their inception.
We would also aim, as before, to reach beyond literature as such and to
incorporate both extraliterary forms of language experiment and the vast
range of ethnopoetic discoveries that were prevalent throughout the
nineteenth century.  By so doing we aim to recapture a great body of poetry
(canonical as well as non-canonical) that was stripped of its counterpoetic
potential and too often denied by many of those who were in fact among its
true inheritors.

Jeffrey Robinson and I view this not only as "our" project but as a
potentially collective work, in which we would call on the knowledge and the
passions of those of you who share our sense of the romantic as a principal
starting point for much that has followed.  Our primary search is for works
of poetry -- broadly defined -- but we are also tracking down critical and
scholarly writings, including (very much so) related work and commentaries
by later poets and other active practitioners, among them many of those for
whom Romanticism as such was or remains a problematic value.  Beyond that we
have a desperate need for translations -- either suggestions of poetry
already translated or offers to join with us in the crucial work of creating
or transcreating new translations that will conserve and forcefully carry
the old works back to the domain of the new.

As with Poems for the Millennium, when Pierre Joris and I began it, we have
only a first, still dim presentiment of where this will carry us.  What
we're offering, then, is a genuine call both for translations and for
consultation and assistance that will open the project to all of you who
want to have a voice in it.

Jerome Rothenberg,
on behalf of Jeffrey Robinson and myself

MSA 7 - Chicago, IL, November 3-6, 2005:

CALL FOR SEMINAR, PANEL, and ROUNDTABLE PROPOSALS=20

Deadline for Submission of Seminar Topics: February 28, 2005=20

Deadline for Submission of Panel Proposals: May 9, 2005

Deadline for Submission of Roundtable Proposals: May 9, 2005

Please note:=20

* All who attend the MSA conference must be members of the organization
with dues paid for 2005-6. (MSA membership runs from October to
September.)

* Because we wish to involve as many people as possible as active
participants, MSA does not permit multiple appearances on the program.
That is, one cannot give papers in two sessions, or be both a seminar
leader and a panelist or roundtable participant. However, panelists,
roundtable participants, and plenary speakers who also wish to
participate in a seminar or a "What Are You Reading?" session may
certainly do so. And of course one may chair a session and also appear
elsewhere on the program.

* MSA rules do not allow panel or roundtable organizers to chair their
own session if they are also speaking in the session. Organizers are
encouraged to identify a moderator and include this information with
their proposals; the MSA Program Committee is also able to help you
secure another conference attendee's service as moderator.=20

After the following calls for seminar leaders, panels, and roundtables,
please see at the end of this message announcements for additional
conference events.
  =20

1. CALL FOR SEMINAR PROPOSALS

Deadline: Monday, February 28, 2005=20

Seminars are one the most significant features of the MSA conference.
Seminars are two hours in length. Participants write brief "position
papers" (5-7 pages) that are read and circulated prior to the
conference. With no more than 15 participants, seminars generate lively
exchange and sometimes produce networks of scholars who continue to work
together beyond the conference. The format also allows most conference
attendees to seek financial support from their institutions as they
educate themselves and their colleagues on subjects of mutual interest.


Please note that this is the call for seminar *leaders*. Sign-ups for
seminar participants will take place on a first-come, first-served basis
starting in mid-April.

Seminar Topics

There are no limits on topics, but past experience has shown that the
more clearly defined the topic and the more guidance provided by the
leader, the more productive the discussion. To scan past seminar topics,
go to the "Conference Archives" on the MSA website
(http://msa.press.jhu.edu/archive/archive.html), click the link to a
prior conference, and then click on "Conference Schedule" or "Conference
Program." You'll find seminars listed along with panels and other
events.=20

Proposing a Seminar=20

Seminar proposals must be submitted via email and must include the
following information. Please assist us by sending this information in
exactly the order given here:=20

* Use as a subject line: MSA 7 SEMINAR PROPOSAL / [LAST NAME OF SEMINAR
LEADER] (e.g., MSA SEMINAR PROPOSAL / GORMAN)

* List the seminar leader's name, institutional affiliation,
discipline, position or title, mailing address, phone, fax, and e-mail
address=20

* Provide a brief curriculum vitae (including teaching experience) for
the seminar leader=20

* Give a brief description (up to 100 words) of the proposed topic=20

Submit proposals by February 28 to:=20

Ann Mattis, Conference Assistant
MSACHICAGO@LUC.EDU=20

Seminars will be selected in mid-March 2005.
 =20

Leading a Seminar=20

Seminar topics will be listed on the conference website in late March
with instructions on how to enroll. Effective seminars have followed a
variety of models, and seminar leaders will be given a menu of best
practices derived from the experience of previous leaders.

E-mail addresses for all seminar registrants will be provided to
seminar leaders in May. At that time, leaders should:=20

* Initiate communications by e-mail, introducing themselves and
providing addresses to all participants=20

* Set guidelines for the seminar, which might include questions to be
addressed, reading to be done, and a specified length for the position
papers (normally 5-7 double-spaced pages). MSA will provide guidance,
but so long as the focus remains on the papers submitted by
participants, leaders are free to use the two-hour time period as they
see fit).

* Set firm deadlines, no later than September 12, 2005 for the actual
exchange of papers=20

* Exchange and read papers during the 7-8 weeks before the conference=20

 =20
2. CALL FOR PANEL PROPOSALS=20

Deadline: Monday, May 9, 2005=20

There are no limits on topics, but please bear in mind these
guidelines:

* We encourage interdisciplinary panels and discourage panels on single
authors.=20

* In order to encourage discussion, we prefer panels with three
participants, though panels of four will be considered.

* Panels composed entirely of participants from a single department at
a single institution are not likely to be accepted.=20

* Graduate students are welcome as panelists. However, panels composed
entirely of graduate students are less likely to be accepted than panels
that include degreed presenters together with graduate students.


Proposals for panels must be submitted via email and must include the
following information. Please assist us by sending this information in
exactly the order given here:=20

* Use as a subject line: MSA 7 PANEL PROPOSAL / [LAST NAME OF PANEL
ORGANIZER] (e.g., MSA 7 PANEL PROPOSAL / GORMAN)

* Session title=20

* Session organizer's name, institutional affiliation, discipline,
position or title, mailing address, phone, fax, and e-mail address=20

* Chair's name, institutional affiliation, discipline, position or
title, and contact information (if you do not identify a chair, we will
locate one for you)=20

* Panelists' names, paper titles, institutional affiliations,
disciplines, positions or titles, and contact information=20

* A maximum 500-word abstract of the panel as a whole=20

* Brief (2-3 sentence) scholarly biography of each panelist

3. CALL FOR ROUNDTABLE PROPOSALS

Deadline: Monday, May 9, 2005=20

Unlike panels, which generally feature a sequence of 15-20 minutes
talks followed by discussion, roundtables gather a group of participants
around a shared concern in order to generate discussion among the
roundtable participants and with the audience. To this end, instead of
delivering full-length papers, participants typically deliver short
position statements in response to questions distributed in advance by
the organizer, or they take turns responding to prompts from the
moderator. The bulk of the session should be devoted to discussion. No
paper titles are listed in the program, only the names of participants.

Other MSA roundtable policies:=20

* Roundtables may feature as many as 6 speakers

* We particularly welcome roundtables featuring participants from

ADDITIONAL CONFERENCE EVENTS: "WHAT ARE YOU READING?"

Last year in Vancouver, the MSA introduced a new kind of session, "What
Are You Reading?" Designed to take advantage, in a productive new way,
of the presence in one place of modernist scholars from many locations,
institutions, and fields, each ninety-minute forum consisted of 8 to 10
participants and a moderator. Led by the moderator, each participant
reported for a few minutes on a scholarly or critical book in modernist
studies, sketching the work's content and explaining why she or he found
it exciting to share with other scholars. Time permitting, moderators
then led discussions  in which participants could seek clarifications,
draw connections, and propose further related reading.

A major goal of "What Are You Reading?" is to facilitate the sharing of
exciting new scholarship (or the "rediscovery" of older scholarship) and
to foster interdisciplinarity by exposing participants to work in
modernist fields other than their own. Open only to those who register
for them in advance, these sessions were widely considered a success and
will be repeated in Chicago.

"What Are You Reading" is not intended as a venue for discussion of
primary texts or works, for self-promotion, or for the enacting of
intellectual conflicts. Participants will therefore be asked not to
present on primary texts or works (though new editions and catalogues
are welcome), their own publications, or scholarship they did not
substantially admire.=20

To participate, all you will need to do is check the appropriate box on
your MSA registration form and name a book you might be interested in
presenting. MSA registration will begin mid-April; look for
announcements at that time. Please note that you will have to register
by 5 September to be included in "What Are You Reading?"

You will be notified of the time and location of your forum in early
October. There is no need to submit any proposal or paper in connection
with this event, nor do you need to contact your moderator in advance.
Simply check the box, receive notice of your time and location, and show
up ready to share a book! Given the uncertain supply of moderators,
places are limited and will be distributed on a first-come, first-served
basis.

well, I suppose because people like me who are on list completely forget
to read her

so this afternoon I was wondering at

But even comparing these two poems to each other is like comparing two
people speaking in tongues: who sounds better?

and

Consider the riddle another way: how do you determine the better, if not
best, passage of Greek or Latin when you don't understand the language?

Because it is a peculiar "'church' of poetry" indeed that Ms.
Hula-Hoop's positing.

All best,

does ms. houlihan ever say anything different when she pretends to
review contemporary poetry?  why circulate this to this list when it
won't tell us anything we already don't know.   the thoughts of a small

Wow. She is so very anxious to have someone reassure her what really
is "the best" poetry and what isn't that she's sucked every smidge of
joy and excitement out of reading, never mind reviewing.  One wouldn't
want her to waste a couple minutes of her life reading a poi-em that
_might not truly belong_ in the hallowed pages of a Best Of anthology,
would one?  Perish the thought!

A poor excuse for a critic, with a worldview as insecure, shrill, and
totalitarian as some national political leaders one could name.

At least she got Lyn Hejinian's name correct in this new rant.

Subject:      2 readings plus prose workshop
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii" ; format="flowed"

I'll be giving two readings in San Francisco next week:  January 11
and 13, and I'll be starting a new round of my private prose workshop
starting February 9.  See details below.

-------------------

Come to the Bottoms Up Book Launch and Reading at EROS.
January 11, 7 p.m.
2051 Market Street at Church
across from the Safeway

Featuring some of San Francisco's most entertaining voices:
Bob Gluck
Dodie Bellamy
Red Jordan Arobateau
Daphne Gottlieb
Charlie Anders
Sarah Fran Wisby
Lori Selke
Jess Arndt


Bottoms Up: Writing About Sex

Both an erotic and literary thrill, Bottoms Up, eschews conventional
conceptions of gender, eliminating categories such as homo- and
heterosexual. The stories are not straight up sexual narrations, but poems
and stories that examine the concept and manifestation of desire itself. The
subject matter ranges from straight to queer and transgender, from darkly
vanilla to tenderly sadomasochist.

Including contributions from Eileen Myles, Michelle Tea, Red Jordan
Arobateau, and Robert Gluck, the pieces of Bottoms Up go quickly to the
heart of what makes sex desperate, dangerous, hysterical, and essential.
Editor and sexpert Diana Cage has crafted a sleazy and surprisingly tender
ode to bottoming, topping, and just plain wanting it.

------------------------

Start the new year with a reading from the new Ecstatic Monkey series!
Thursday January 13th at StartSoma Gallery

featuring poet and fiction writer
Dodie Bellamy
with Ecstatic Monkey member writers
Amy MacLennan and Farnoosh Seifoddini

7:30 pm
FREE and open to the public
Beer and wine

Pink Steam, a collection of Dodie Bellamy's stories, memoirs and
memoiresque essays, was published in 2004 by San Francisco's Suspect
Thoughts Press.  Also in 2004, her infamous epistolary vampire novel,
The Letters of Mina Harker, was reprinted by the University of
Wisconsin Press.  Her book Cunt-Ups (Tender Buttons) won the 2002
Firecracker Alternative Book Award for poetry.  She teaches creative
writing in various grad programs and runs a private prose workshop in
her SoMa apartment.

Amy MacLennan has been published or has work forthcoming in
Cimarron Review, Wisconsin Review, Rattle, Controlled Burn, South Dakota
Review and Folio. One of her poems was included in So Luminous the
Wildflowers, An Anthology of California Poets (Tebot Bach). Amy has read
at the Petaluma Poetry Walk and the San Luis Obispo Poetry Festival.

Farnoosh Seifoddini recently completed an MFA in Creative Writing at SFSU.
She currently resides in Oakland and is working on her first manuscript,
Awake Through all These Hours. Her most recent work can be found in the
North American Review, the Kennesaw Review and Transfer Magazine.

StartSoma Gallery is at 672 S. Van Ness between 17th and 18th.
Through the blue door and up the stairs.

----------------------------

Dodie Bellamy's Prose Workshop

This winter/spring I will be leading a prose workshop, which will
meet 11 Wednesday evenings, from 7 to 10 p.m.  The dates: February 9
through April 27 (no class March 9).  Cost:  $300, with a $100
deposit due by February 1.

By prose I mean fiction, nonfiction, prose poetry, cross-genre (and
cross-gender) writing including (but not exclusively) anything edgy
or experimental.  It's a good place to present work that feels too
risky or sexy or queer for academic workshops.  The workshops are
totally open-ended.  Five people present a week, scheduling that the
week ahead.  Usually people bring in something 5 pages or less
(copies for everybody) and we critique it that week.  Longer pieces
are also okay, but they need to be handed out a week ahead of time
for people to read.  Each student typically gets a half an hour each
time we critique.  The classes are limited to 9 students.  Lots and
lots of personal attention.  They take place in my South of Market
apartment, which comes complete with snacks and one cat.

Pink Steam, my collection of fiction, memoir, and memoiresque essays,
was published in June by San Francisco's Suspect Thoughts Press.  My
vampire novel, The Letters of Mina Harker was reprinted by University
of Wisconsin Press in October.  I'm the author of 3 other books and I
teach creative writing at SF State and in the MFA program at Antioch
Los Angeles. I've also taught at CalArts, Naropa summer session,
Mills, USF, UC Santa Cruz, and the SF Art Institute.  I'm the winner
of the Bay Guardian Goldie Award for Literature and the Firecracker
Alternative Book Award for Poetry.

If you're interested, please email about work samples, etc.  Or--if
you know anybody who might be interested, please pass this email
along to them.  If you're interested do contact me promptly.

How beautiful and deadly thou art,
cycles of ice hanging like deadmen from trees
breaking the limbs, crashing down onto highway 80
onto highway 940, the bus turns around in shame
at loveliness and murder

How murderous thou art, deadly as well,
making old trees making way for new trees green growth
branched crashing on streets and super highways alike
turning vehicles around straight dead in their tracks
staring at loveliness and murder

Today is a historic day for America.

For the first time since 1877, members of Congress chose to contest the=20=

certification of electoral votes. The vote count stopped when Vice=20
President Dick Cheney reached Ohio. Based on concrete facts about voter=20=

disenfranchisement compiled by John Conyers and his staff, Senator=20
Barbara Boxer (D-CA) and Representative Stephanie Tubbs Jones (D-OH)=20
stood together and forced debate in both houses of Congress about=20
certification of Ohio's electoral votes.

The Senate's debate convened quickly, as only 75 Senators were=20
available to vote and it takes only a simple majority to turn down such=20=

an objection. Out of 75 Senators, 55 were Republicans. The objection=20
was overturned 74 to 1. This means that 19 Democrats voted with the=20
Republican Party on this. The dissenting vote was cast by Senator=20
Barbara Boxer, who had cosigned the objection with Stephanie Tubbs=20
Jones.

Even in Congress, there seems to be an air of unfairness to this debate=20=

-- some Democrats were given only 10-30 seconds to speak their minds on=20=

this issue, while some Republicans were allowed as long as 5 minutes to=20=

decry the stand-up Democrats as conspiracy-theorists and=20
"noise-makers."

The report put out by the Conyers staff was over 100 pages long, and=20
details, very specifically, instances of blatant voter=20
disenfranchisement as well as serious problems concerning numbers of=20
voting machines, length of lines, and the like.

In the face of this and other irrefutable evidence, Republican Congress=20=

members fought back with rhetoric, not facts. They stood up and called=20=

us on the left liars, noise makers, conspiracy nuts, while providing=20
NO, repeat NO, concrete evidence whatsoever. Why did the Republicans=20
fight against an objection that would not take their chosen leader out=20=

of office, but simply allow the government to reform the voting system=20=

and make sure that all Americans are able to vote and have their votes=20=

counted?

What are they afraid of?

Perhaps they are afraid that actually allowing every eligible American=20=

to vote will hurt them?

If this is the case, then I say, "Shame on you!" To vote in favor of=20
the disenfranchisement of the American people shows all too clearly=20
that these people do not care what the American people want--they care=20=

about winning and staying in power. And the fact the 19 Democrats could=20=

not stand up and present a united front on this is absolutely pitiful.

135 House members did not bother to show up to vote. 173 Republicans=20
turned down the objection and will certify what they cannot verify. 81=20=

Democrats also turned down the objection and will certify what they=20
cannot verify. Only 33 Democrats in the House were willing to uphold=20
the objection. Only 33 members of the House of Representatives fought=20
for democracy today. Only 34 members of Congress stood up and fought=20
for democracy today. The result of all this is clear.

Democracy is dead.

The United States is now, for all practical purposes, a one party=20
state. With the Democrats lying wilted and beaten on the Senate floor,=20=

there is little hope that they will make any organized effort to fight=20=

against the Republican majority for the next two years.

There is little recourse for those of us outside the power structure at=20=

this point. We can do what we have been doing -- calling, writing,=20
emailing our representatives, protesting, and communicating here on the=20=

net, until 2006. In 2006, we can show up in unprecedented numbers to=20
vote in the midterm elections and we can oust these pathetic Democrats=20=

from their comfortable seats of power and replace them with members of=20=

the left who actually care about voters. We must replace these 100=20
Democrats with people who will demand democracy in the United States,=20
and we must demand answers from those Congress members who didn't=20
bother to show up to vote --why? What could possibly be more important=20=

than upholding the rights of your constituents? Isn't it your job to=20
protect us? Isn't it your job to look after our interests?

Today is a day of mourning, but also a day of renewed anger and energy.=20=

We must fight! We, the little people, are all that is left to protect=20
democracy for the future.

Dear Harry Nudel,
so I'm kissing Bernstein's ass?

Well Harry the actual truth is that I am 99% certain
Mr. Bernstein is heterosexual.  And I'm not so sure
his wife would approve of me kissing his ass.  Although
it is possible to accidentally kiss someone's ass in
the shower, I doubt very much that Mr. Bernstein and
I will be showering together anytime soon.  And
furthermore, since I'm such a careful person in the
shower (it's important to condition the hair properly)
it's highly unlikely I would have such an accident
occur with Mr. Bernstein or any other fellow showerer.

Let me try to be serious (it's so difficult for me to be
serious with you Harry, but I'll try), I have fantastic
self esteem, meaning I like my poems and don't
need a crutch like kissing ass.

Besides that, my poems and Mr. Bernstein's poems
are written on very different continents, so, if I was
the type of person to kiss ass (and I'm NOT meaning
the accident in the shower kind) I would most likely
be wasting my time with him.

For years I had heard the frightening accounts of this
cutthroat poet Charles Bernstein.  The stories DID
make me check out his poems, and some I liked,
and some not.  But all kinds of wicked stories were
being told about Bernstein, none that I'm interested
in repeating (life's too exciting for gossip, at least
I think so).

So when I heard that he was going to be giving a
reading in Philadelphia, I thought I'd show up and
get a view of this Atilla the Hun.  Of course he turned
out to be rather nice, and he looks you right in the
eye when he talks, and doesn't seem to bullshit you,
all good qualities, and rare for many poets.  So the
bastard wasn't a bastard afterall, and ontop of it,
I liked his poems he read to us, another thing
I wasn't so certain would happen for me.  Plus,
the added bonus that he's a top of the line reader
of his poems.

These are facts, like them or not, it's all very true.

Bernstein didn't get where he is by writing shitty
poems and mumbling in monotone at the mic.

But once again, my award for his poem was judged
with sincerity, and that's that.  He's won the award
and I refuse to give into any pressures to change
my mind.

Have a suspicious day wary Harry,
CAConrad

This morning's NYT obit for Guy Davenport:

January 7, 2005

Guy Davenport Dies at 77; Prolific Author and Illustrator
  By CHRISTOPHER LEHMANN-HAUPT


  Guy Davenport, a many-sided author, painter, teacher and scholar whose=20=

work, while ranging from critical essays to translations to poetry, was=20=

perhaps most admired for short stories in the modernist tradition of=20
Pound and Joyce, died on Tuesday in Lexington, Ky. He was 77 and lived=20=

in Lexington, where he taught English at the University of Kentucky for=20=

three decades.

The cause was lung cancer, said Bonnie Jean Cox, his companion of=20
almost 40 years.

Just as Mr. Davenport arrived at his teaching career serendipitously -=20=

"I never intended to be a teacher," he once said, "I just like going to=20=

school and learning things" - he considered writing fiction "just a=20
hobby," as he told several interviewers.

Yet he published more than a half-dozen collections of stories, among=20
them "Da Vinci's Bicycle: Ten Stories" (Johns Hopkins, 1979), "Apples=20
and Pears and Other Stories" (North Point Press, 1984), "The Jules=20
Verne Steam Balloon: Nine Stories" (North Point, 1987) and "A Table of=20=

Green Fields" (New Directions, 1994).

  In 1990 he received a so-called genius grant from the John D. and=20
Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation for his short fiction and essays=20
linking American civilization with the traditions of classical and=20
European culture.

In typical Davenport short stories, Kafka promises a little girl that=20
her lost doll, Belinda, is actually on a trip around the world and will=20=

write to her ("Belinda's World Tour"), or there's a juxtaposition of=20
Gertrude Stein and Alice B. Toklas in Paris, the Wright brothers at=20
Kitty Hawk, Fourier's utopian New Harmony community, Leonardo's=20
bicycle, pollinating bees, and Beckett in conversation ("Au Tombeau de=20=

Charles Fourier").

  Mr. Davenport's playful explanation for his technique was, "You get up=20=

in the morning and you've got Keats' 'Odes' to take some sophomores=20
through, and you've got a chapter of 'Ulysses' for your graduate=20
students, and the mind gets in the habit of finding cross-references=20
among subjects," he told an interviewer for the periodical Vort in=20
1976.

  But critics saw the deeper point to his fiction. Hilton Kramer, in The=20=

New York Times Book Review, wrote of Davenport's conception of the=20
short-story form: "He has given it some of the intellectual density of=20=

the learned essay, some of the lyric concision of the modern poem -=20
some of its difficulty too - and a structure that often resembles a=20
film documentary. The result is a tour de force that adds something new=20=

to the art of fiction."

In 1974, his story "Robot" won a third prize in the O. Henry Awards,=20
and in 1981 he won the Morton Douwen Zabel award for fiction from the=20
American Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters.

Guy Mattison Davenport Jr. was born in Anderson, S.C., on Nov. 23,=20
1927, the younger child of Guy Mattison Davenport, a Railway Express=20
agent, and Marie Fant Davenport. An older sister, Gloria Williamson of=20=

Anderson, survives him, in addition to Ms. Cox.

  In 1944, Mr. Davenport quit high school to study art at Duke=20
University. He eventually majored in classics and English literature,=20
and won a Rhodes Scholarship in 1948. At Merton College, Oxford, he=20
wrote the first thesis on Joyce to be accepted by the university,=20
received a degree in literature in 1950, and returned to the United=20
States.

After serving from 1950 to 1952 in the Army's 18th Airborne Corps he=20
taught at Washington University in St. Louis. A meeting with Pound in=20
1952 solidified his interest in modern literature and led him to take a=20=

doctorate at Harvard, where he wrote his thesis on Pound's "Cantos,"=20
which helped to highlight Pound's poetic achievement in the face of his=20=

mental problems and support of fascism.

  After teaching at Haverford College from 1961 to 1963, he joined the=20=

University of Kentucky faculty, where he remained until he retired in=20
1991, after winning the MacArthur grant with its award of $365,000.

  In 1963, he published his first book, "The Intelligence of Louis=20
Agassiz: A Specimen Book of Scientific Writings" (Beacon), a study of a=20=

Harvard University natural philosopher. There followed some four dozen=20=

books, among them, in addition to the stories, the novel "Bicycle=20
Rider" (1985), books on art, and even several works he illustrated,=20
including Hugh Kenner's "Counterfeiters."

"He was an unqualified genius, so he talked over everybody's head,"=20
Erik Reece, a former student, a friend, the author of a book on Mr.=20
Davenport's visual art and now a lecturer in Kentucky's English=20
department, told The Louisville Courier-Journal, "but in a way that=20
made you want to get to where he was."

Dear Steve,
I don't want you to think I was ignoring you, I was
just having a little talk with Harry first.

But here I am, and you have my full attention.

Okay?  Okay, so it's time for a little tough love.
I'm so sorry your feelings were hurt that I didn't
choose one of your poems for the sexiest poem
of 2004.  You poor thing!

Dry your eyes!

Now Steve listen close, I'm not saying you didn't
write a poem in 2004 that was sexier, I'm just
saying that if you did, I didn't read it.

One more thing, when you wrote,
"come on  he's straight  enough already"
it made me laugh SO loud!  Did you REALLY read
Bernstein's poem?  It's OKAY Steve, it's A-Okay,
no need to protect Bernstein's masculinity!  You
extinct version of yourself, don't you get it?  Reread
his poem again!  That's your assignment for today!
And dry your eyes or no recess!

Oh Steve, if I was your mother I'd probably love you
more than I do, since I don't.

Sweet blessings in your prayers Steve,
CAConrad

Aldon,

 I am about two-thirds of the way through INTEGRAL MUSIC and it is a fascinating and necessary (obviously) companion to BLACK CHANT. Great stuff.

Seconded.

I thought Houlihan's article was pretty intelligent and interesting, if off
the handle once or twice.

The defensiveness and immaturity of the replies to this article are
interesting in how they make a small jab bigger.

Dear All,

I also have noticed an aggression, and possibly even a degree of sexism,
in the responses to Joan Houlihan's article (which I have
read but in which I have no further interest).  Perhaps I wrongly
associate the pejorative word "shrill" with a negative attitude to
a woman speaking in public, especially as, in this case, it was also
applied--or implied--to our President.

One:  I have read Houlihan.  That is why I know almost exactly what she will say. Shameful for a critic of poetry to not actually read.  And they should know about this in Boston, since Harvard basically taught us all how to read (not Yale).

Two:  I can no longer read her.  I spent December trying to read David Brooks, but threw the book across the room when I realized that there was no depth at all in the book.  It makes one miss Russell Baker who was funny as sin, but also knew where the bodies were buried.  Our Mr. Brooks is a naif that Safire could take down in one round.  This is to say that I have done my time reading the work of those I disagree with and on a more comprehensive scale than about probably anyone on this list.  So I am not reading Houlihan, who is jejune compared to so many others to the left and right of her.

Three:  I don't really have confidence that either of her standard bearers here read that much better, so there is no reason to engage.  We do not lack for anti-language readers on this list, and most of them can read and write quite well, thank you.  It would be nice to hear from some of them, but they didn't always abide by the netiquette of Poetics.

So, my response was quick and cryptic, but not defensive.    From here on in, I have no comment, neither on Boston nor on this stale and woebegone debate.

Robert makes no mention of my email to him attempting, as argument for
discourse, a comparison between contemporary art's broad evolutions =
from the
days of the single defining aesthetic of Pollock, for example, to the =
current
scene, where Pollock-level artists like Olafur Eliason defy =
categorizations of
form, technique or voice and are therefore able to carry art into new
dimensions.  =20

Terminalizing experimental poetry with terms like avant or post-avant =
better
serves after an apex has been reached and the stars are falling. You =
don't hear
any serious visual artist or arts professional referring to any visual =
"avant."
The notion is ridiculous, conjuring images straight outta Scorcese's =
Life
Lessons, with Nick Nolte ravaging himself onto a canvas. It is =
interesting as
can be, but vis-=E0-vis the current pluralism, is it an alternative?

When Silliman and Bernstein say "school of quietude" and "official =
verse
culture," these pejoratives help to keep things healthy. Despite being =
a bit
dismissive, they engage a range of inputs, thus contributing to =
discourse.
Disallowing criticism with broad swipes, walling oneself off from =
perceived
"other,"--who can be classified as somehow inferior (unworthy of even
hearing?)--safely eliminates discourse, but what with it?

Mairead,

My responses are not sexist.  They are direct and cutting, but Ms. Houlihan is as well.  Ms. is a sign of respect from where I hail, but we do it use it to belittle people.  Teasing is a southern vice, but when you have a thoroughly ironic culture (cf. Ireland), that is what you get.  It don't mean we wouldn't serve her delicious repast if she visited, but having read her too much I know that she never says anything of interest about actual poems.

But let us do read:

1) After a year of metaphorical rocks with unintelligible notes affixed to them crashing through my window and with the tire-squeal of the Winter-Wolfe-Skanky-Possum gang still ringing in my ears, was happy to have a chance to curl up with a hot cup of tea and this respected practitioner's description of what's “best” about such lines as: "no dirt aliens, don't waste good mascara ... "

2) Whatever else can be said of them, the first-person-anecdotal-narrative-confessional (aka 'mainstream') poems that have been outnumbered in this volume by such writings as the above, can at least be critically sorted (some are clearly better than others, regardless of whether or not they fit a particular editor or critic's 'taste').

3) Fortunately, I had Hejinian's clear prose to guide me. For enlightenment on her selection process, I returned to her introduction:  "Dynamic, ever-changing, poetry (and American poetry in particular) is a site of perpetual transitions and unpredictable metamorphoses, but there is no end point in poetry."

Comment on no.1:  Isn't Houlihan polemical, sarcastic and condescending ("unintelligible notes," "Winter-Wolfe-Skanky-Possum", "respected practictioner." ) There is no gender for pungent language.

Comment on no. 2:  She can't read LiP, since she can't sort it.  She has no measure to weigh the worth of each poem.  Houlihan wants to know what poem is best absolutely.  This means she wants a poll and a canon.  Which relates to number 3

Comment on no 3:  Failing to be able to read the poetry, she goes to Heijinian's distinctly clear prose.  And fails to note that Heijinian disagrees strongly with her canonizing, cherry-picking technique:  "there is no end point to poetry."  Yes, we can make local discriminations and say what we like.  Aesthetic ideas are concepts.  We can discuss them and we wouldn't discuss something that had no content (oh, wait a minute, that is idealistic).  But they have no grounding.  You can't a priori or rationally choose between them.  You can't set up a metric.  Heijinian knows her Kant far better than Houlihan.

Game match set to Heijinian.  My question to Houlihan is why do the review (or not review:  aside from lazy selections from two poems, she has nothing specific (and nothing specific to say about the selections either) in the first place when she has nothing to say about the poems.  She is simply pontificating about what she thinks is common sense.  I reserve comment about what is common about this sense, but Houlihan simply wants to claim that there is no reading of LP or LiP.  I think there is strong evidence to believe that many, starting with Fence and Verse but spreading much more widely than this column not worth the paper it is written on, think otherwise.

And to Hoerman:  I disagree that this is equivalent to Silliman's School of Quietude jab.  That is accurate and clever.  Houlihan just represents a certain institution giving off steam as it realizes it is losing a grip.  Geez, find a critic who at least can read.  They are out there.  Of course, there is always a danger that they will give up cherished principles in the light of evidence (cf. Empson).

Just so. We may disagree about where it is off the handle once or
twice, I suppose, but what is wrong with what she says when she says,
for example, this:

_____________

No, dirt aliens: don't waste good mascara, fiber gives you confi-
dence. Spin doctors vs. gravity, do you spandex wooden leg plus spaz
hemp tempi seize the fey crawlspatiality creatures peel off. Barbie
pro-tons slobber the manual seedling wrapped in human skin. Happy
puppy preconscious vouchers don't brownnose your pal's girlfriend, a
swagger unanointed affect in its gob phase. Automated preparation H=97a
non-goosing, a midriff melody=97stir the rack up=85mere child has her
permit. --Bruce Andrews, =93from Dang Me=94

Stacked circles (rain down) say green it releases nothing. Bundled
wires. Ellsworth Kelly strides from one red iceberg to the next. Each
face projects onto antennae forging a domain expressed as a skewered
pod. Transparency behind a desk elusive plunge. A dissection of
thought into its components the weight of meat up the wrong street
the wrong backdoor. The blazer missed too as the wiry one observed.
Someone slipped him diet Orangina and he went ballistic. The whole
staff crayoned their names onto the good luck card while unwitting
partygoers waited for the elevator. Mogul and musician separated at
birth one suggested. Hubris. The directions very specific and yet so
many stood idle. She ravished in black. He charmed in lime. --Mark
Bibbins, =93from Blasted Fields of Clover Bring Harrowing and Regretful
Sighs=94

I chose these two poems randomly (there are plenty of other examples
to wonder at, these two just happen to appear at the beginning of the
book). Lyn Hejinian did not respond to my request for an interview
for this piece, so I can only try to guess at the criteria for
selection in general. But even comparing these two poems to each
other is like comparing two people speaking in tongues: who sounds
better?

Whatever else can be said of them, the first-person-anecdotal-
narrative-confessional (aka =93mainstream=94) poems that have been
outnumbered in this volume by such writings as the above, can at
least be critically sorted (some are clearly better than others,
regardless of whether or not they fit a particular editor or critic's
=93taste=94). Basic standards relating to the craft of writing in
general, such as non-clich=E9d phrases, use of momentum and pacing,
lack of unintentional ambiguities and other grammatical problems, as
well as evidence of an organizing intelligence, a sense of
inevitability, a convincing and/or compelling style and voice and so
forth are at least available to the reader in, for lack of a better
word, the =93mainstream=94 poem. Poetry, as Pound observed rightly,
should be at least as well-written as prose. Further, it bears
reflection that while Pound could improve Eliot's poems through
application of standards of craft, no such improvement can take place
for either of the poems I've excerpted, simply because there is no
way to discern any purpose or aim.

If you're in the Buffalo area, you can hear (see) Michael Basinski at the
Albright Knox.  He is the Director of the Poetry Collection at UB and is a
poet and performance artist, and has appeared in Europe and the US. I've
discovered that he has also appeared in one of Buffalo's Canadian
connections, Karl Jirgens Rampike. Mike is a vivacious reader and
invariably draws loud applease

The Albright-Knox art gallery will be open January 28, free and the poetry
reasings, sponsored by  Just Buffalo, will be between 6 and 8 pm.

Jonathan Skinner is produces the book-length magazine   "ecopoetics", a
gathering of explorations into the relationships between our imaginations
and our environment.

The success of his work has been growing, and now has
received--indirectly--considerable, and perhaps unintended support from
Angus Fletch's "New Theory of American Poetry"  Angus Fletcher has a
supple and engaging style, and has provided a highly interesting
historical background, a grounding for what more recent poets have been
doing.

Jonathan Skinner is also a poet, who redefines the sense of "engagement"
so if you're in the Buffalo area January 28, come to the Albright-Knox for
the 6-8 pm poetry readings sponsored by Just Buffalo, thanks to Mike
Kelleher.

This is merely an appeal to authority without establishing that it's
an authority anyone but a very few people would recognize as an
authority. It's the "Can Forty Readers Of Fence Be Wrong" argument,
and it's fallacious on the face of it if that is all you can offer to
support the notion that LP or LiP poetry can be read.

It may be that LP or LiP poetry can be read, but the demonstration of
that is to show how it can be read, not to claim that some group that
claims it can be read has collected itself together and published a
magazine or two. That's just politics. The question is what do you
mean when you say LP or LiP poetry can be read? What do you mean when
you say that?

illumination." =AD from =B3Poetry is Not a Luxury=B2 by Audre Lorde. =B3This is a
poetry workshop that takes the poetry of illumination to mean the poetry of
experience. How we scrutinize, how we elucidate our lives through words and
rhythms, how we make our poems bring new ways of thinking about our lives.
We will focus on the basics: line, stanza, cadence, meter, diction, syntax,
and point of view -=AD the elements that make a poem. We will also read
contemporary poets including Audre Lorde, Maureen Owen, Amy Gerstler, Shara=

creative focus, to switch gears from a day job into writing, and to
circumvent creative blocks. We will also discuss the use of hypnosis to
vividly recall memories, and its use in conjunction with other creative
tools such as automatic writing.=B2 A $20 materials fee covers four of

languages of poetry and music and asking questions about how they can be
combined and how they might illuminate each other. What are the poetic
implications of improvisation? What are the musical implications of everyda=

sound and how does our listening affect our writing? We will read and liste=

*ANNOUNCEMENT FROM JEROME ROTHENBERG*

This is to let a number of you know that I'm starting -- indefatigably -- o=
n
a new project of some size: a Romantic and postromantic (including early
modern) gathering conceived as a nineteenth-century sequel or prequel to
Poems for the Millennium.  My co-editor and the true originator of the
project is Jeffrey Robinson, whom some of you may know already as a scholar
of English Romanticism and a marvelous voice in connecting that germinal
moment and movement to the most innovative and radical poetries of our own
time and place.  The publisher, as with Poems for the Millennium, will be
the University of California Press.
=20
Our plan is to trace a line or several lines of work -- both poetry and
poetics -- from the late eighteenth-century post-enlightenment to the early
twentieth-century eruption of experimental and avant-garde modernism.  Like
what Pierre Joris and I did in Poems for the Millennium, such a gathering,
as we conceive it, would be international in scope (with a focus, for
obvious reasons, on all of Europe and all of the Americas) and would attemp=
t
to restore a sense of the revolutionary and transformative nature of
Romanticism and postromanticism as they were at the time of their inception=
.
We would also aim, as before, to reach beyond literature as such and to
incorporate both extraliterary forms of language experiment and the vast
range of ethnopoetic discoveries that were prevalent throughout the
nineteenth century.  By so doing we aim to recapture a great body of poetry
(canonical as well as non-canonical) that was stripped of its counterpoetic
potential and too often denied by many of those who were in fact among its
true inheritors. =20
=20
Jeffrey Robinson and I view this not only as "our" project but as a
potentially collective work, in which we would call on the knowledge and th=
e
passions of those of you who share our sense of the romantic as a principal
starting point for much that has followed.  Our primary search is for works
of poetry -- broadly defined -- but we are also tracking down critical and
scholarly writings, including (very much so) related work and commentaries
by later poets and other active practitioners, among them many of those for
whom Romanticism as such was or remains a problematic value.  Beyond that w=
e
have a desperate need for translations -- either suggestions of poetry
already translated or offers to join with us in the crucial work of creatin=
g
or transcreating new translations that will conserve and forcefully carry
the old works back to the domain of the new.
=20
As with Poems for the Millennium, when Pierre Joris and I began it, we have
only a first, still dim presentiment of where this will carry us.  What
we're offering, then, is a genuine call both for translations and for
consultation and assistance that will open the project to all of you who
want to have a voice in it.

Subject:      A great Chinese poet and the Nobel Prize (OPEN,

Our organization, Movement One:Creative Coalition, a New York based arts and eduaction non-profit that amongst other things has originated and organized the annual Queens International Poetry Festival, has begun a campaign to have Huang Xiang, the great Chinese poet, recognized with the Nobel Prize in Literature in 2005.
Imprisoned twelve years- and twice put on death row- because he was the organizaer of the Democracy Wall Movement during the Cutlural Revolution, Huang Xiang is a poet whose work has been compared to that of Pablo Neruda's, Anna Ahkmatova's, Walt Whitman's and Nazim Hikmet (who ironically was imprisoned twelve years in his own native country- Turkey).
Though less known than other Chinese writers (his work is still banned in China), Huang Xiang has had over fifteen books published, and just last year, Mellen Press put out the first book of English translations of his work, A Bilingual edition of Poetry Out Of Communist China by Huang Xiang. Currently, Huang Xiang and his wife, the writer Qiuxao Yulan live in Pittsburgh, hosted by the International Network of the Cities of Asylum (whose President is Russell Banks).
Under the rules set forth by the Nobel Committee, there are four types of individuals who can nominate someone for the Nobel: 1)members of the Swedish Academy or similar academy (therefore, we believe you are eligible if you are a member of the Academy of American Poets 2)Professors of Literature or Linguistics at a university or college
3)Past winners of the Nobel Prize
4)Presdent of a "Society of Authors" such as PEN, etc.

If you fit any of those criteria, we urge you nominate Huang Xiang for the Nobel Prize in Literature. For more information, click on the nobel campaign link on our website, or write back to me.
Thank you

It always amazes me how people create dualities of two things that are =
part
of the same multiplicity.
Instead of celebrating the multiplicity, poetry, why do some people wish =
to
defend a single way of defining it?
Joan Houlihan admits a closed mind on the topic of LP and an assumption =
that
she knows what poetry is.
Lyn Hejinian, admits subjectivity in her selection and an assertion that
no-one can define what poetry is.

The anthology must be taken in context.
For me, one of the most important things LP achieves is the continued
development of the written poem on the page, the poem that is and can be
read without the phonological considerations of rhyme, meter, or even =
line
per breath of the beats and black mountain poets.
As one of its most successful and innovative practitioners, Hejinian's
selection of her concept of best would be an accurate indication of the =
most
cutting-edge of poetry that is coming out in print in the USA.

Two more interesting questions that i ask are;
In this pluralist poetic culture why are we still publishing anthologies =
of
poetry that are from single nations, like the USA, and why aren't we
publishing 'the best poetry of 2004' from all over the world?

And secondly, are the publication of 'the best of' anthologies, and as =
has
been the fashion in australia of late, anthologies based on themes; =

It is well known that "everyone's a bastard until you get to know them"
(Groucho Marx)

Bernstein is a brilliant - dare we say "great" -  poet - he's written a lot
of poems, so a lot is not so good - and the language poets have made a major
contribution to poetics and poetry.  Harry is maybe aware of course of how
well known and widely published he is so he doesn't really need any more
accolades - although give credit or discredit wherever they are due I
suppose is the story. (Better to say nothing maybe or be as positive as
possible?)

I don't agree with everything they (the Langpos) say or do and so on but I
am glad I was "introduced to them" in 1992 on a course  (one paper was on
American poetry  -20th Century American poetry) - I had gone back to Uni
when I was 40. Language poetry was a revelation to me - I have dabbled in
it - or tried to myself - and it has been some influence - cant think of
anything original like al lot of those guys think of  ( I mean they have big
projects based on the Alphabet etc) and they think about things I just cant
get my head around, but I admire their energy  - so I mainly just write my
"intuitive"poems (vaguely Ashberic, and very lazy because I hardly ever
think about what I am writing - but is this a Langpo line? "I look up the
answers to my poems after I've written them " Lol...)  - but I owe a debt to
them in that - as Wsytan Curnow said to me once at reading - "they give you
permission" (it's strange that a poet almost feels that he/she might need
permission!) he meant (permission) to write anything in any way you like -
to experiment etc - doesn't mean that they write things that are "random"
as such (often they are very structured and "strategic" (some use chance
methods to some degree - but eg Susan Howe is has some very interesting
projects and a lot of Bernstein's seemed to be (based on ) political
concepts etc (but there are other things going on)  the concentration on the
subtleties of language, puns, parataxis and so on.  (Also there is the
attention to modern phiiosophical and literary theory and a lot of
theorising ...which puts some people off.) I bought  or photocopied many the
works of the Langpos  - had some good laughs ( I mean some of it is actually
funny "toe tapping tintinnabulation" is a phrase from Bernstein's work I
recall and Silliman has things like  "A bee the size of a cat." (Juxtaposed
within actual observations - eg something like "Its better with blue pen?
The road veers right and the water seems to glare. Two gray people pass. A
bee the size of a cat."   Something like that (I made up the other sentences
(although he does ask  - "is it better with a blue pen") - its something
like that though) I think that's either in Lit or Tjanting))* and some great
reading experiences reading their works. Bruce Adeson has some witty and
often just funny stuff - a bit of te  'violence' etc in there as my young
friend Hamish suggested). Alan Sondheim was associated with Langpos but hs
'veered off' into a his strange project. Nick Piombino's book I have -
"Theoretical Objects' - which is excellent - I took the trouble to get it
for the US - he has been associated with the Langauge poets - but seems more
somewhere between them and John Ashbery ..but I could be wrong ) But
"Language poets" and so on is just another label such as the NY Poets/ or
even The Romantics and really indicates a movement rather a particular
method or style (although there maybe stylistic and strategic resemblences)
pehaps the most languagy poet in NZ is a young woman called Will Joy
Christie and also Tony Green has done some interesting stuff - kind of
diaristic pieces  - I have been accused of being postmodern and possibly a
languge poet but I am not sure what kind of poet I am or whether I am
one!))...someone can enlarge on this ( Idon't mean on what kind of poet I
am! I mean on what is a Language poet or if there is such an animal))

I also saw Harry's naughty imputation   - but Harry is Harry.  Old sleepless
Mr Drn

Richard Taylor

* I suppose one of the points of this method - apart fom the use of the -
more or less - disconnected setences (parataxis) - the sentence being the
major unit -it also mirrors or somewhat replicates the way we often have
thoughts that seem to "come from nowhere", and if we travel on a bus or
train we look out the window and note something then we have some
thought -not necesarily connected to the observation - and there is also a
kind of dialectical progress and a structure - quite formalistic to a
degree -(it follows the Fibonnacci series - basis of the golden number or
golden section - and uses the Hegelian dialectic) So Tjanting ( as one
example) in that sense, is "realistic", or wags a finger at realism -
something like that.

Does anyone else feel uneasy about the idea of nominating Huang Xiang for
Nobel Prize when none of his poems are quoted, when more attention is paid
to his biography than to his output? Certainly the writer's life has
influenced the Nobel decision in the past, but usually this is pointed out
to undermine the sincerity of the prize, rather than recommend someone to
its ranks.

I'm a huge advocate of Chinese poetry, but I've never heard of Huang Xiang
outside of the context of Movement One, and I don't think I've been given
anything to advocate.

And as much as anyone on the Swedish Academy says that the prize is awarded
to a writer without concern for anyone else writing in that language, the
fact is that it took a hundred years for the Nobel committee to find anyone
in Chinese literature. Gao Xingjian--laureate in 2000, whose works are also
banned in mainland China--got the prize when many in China were at least as
worthy (Ba Jin, Shi Zhecun, Mo Yan, Yu Hua), and in some ways it's too bad:
he received his nod too recently for anyone else--including the surviving
Misty Poets, such as Bei Dao, Yang Lian, Shu Ting, Jiang He--to be honored,
anyway.

A word of advice to Paul Catafago and the Movement One backers of Huang
Xiang, anyway: the person who really matters here is Goran Malmqvist, the
only Chinese scholar on the Swedish Academy. He's the one who translated Gao
Xingjian's works into Swedish for the rest of the Academy to read, and he's
the one whose ear you ought to bend if you want your man to get a Nobel.

Profs)

Our organization, Movement One:Creative Coalition, a New York based arts and
eduaction non-profit that amongst other things has originated and organized
the annual Queens International Poetry Festival, has begun a campaign to
have Huang Xiang, the great Chinese poet, recognized with the Nobel Prize in
Literature in 2005.
Imprisoned twelve years- and twice put on death row- because he was the
organizaer of the Democracy Wall Movement during the Cutlural Revolution,
Huang Xiang is a poet whose work has been compared to that of Pablo
Neruda's, Anna Ahkmatova's, Walt Whitman's and Nazim Hikmet (who ironically
was imprisoned twelve years in his own native country- Turkey).
Though less known than other Chinese writers (his work is still banned in
China), Huang Xiang has had over fifteen books published, and just last
year, Mellen Press put out the first book of English translations of his
work, A Bilingual edition of Poetry Out Of Communist China by Huang Xiang.
Currently, Huang Xiang and his wife, the writer Qiuxao Yulan live in
Pittsburgh, hosted by the International Network of the Cities of Asylum
(whose President is Russell Banks).
Under the rules set forth by the Nobel Committee, there are four types of
individuals who can nominate someone for the Nobel: 1)members of the Swedish
Academy or similar academy (therefore, we believe you are eligible if you
are a member of the Academy of American Poets 2)Professors of Literature or
Linguistics at a university or college
3)Past winners of the Nobel Prize
4)Presdent of a "Society of Authors" such as PEN, etc.

If you fit any of those criteria, we urge you nominate Huang Xiang for the
Nobel Prize in Literature. For more information, click on the nobel campaign
link on our website, or write back to me.
Thank you

Jews


I am losing friends over this. I reach states of no return over this.
I respond poorly and unfairly. I'm tired of thinking of myself, 'Jew,'
and listening and watching 'Jew' return in guises I don't recognize.
Needless to say:

Jews did not leave the World Trade Center just before it was hit.
Jews came to work that day like everyone else.
It was not a Zionist conspiracy.
Jews did not cause the Tsunami.
Jews went through the Holocaust which killed a lot of them.
Jew, Jew, Jews.
Jews do not want to slaughter Palestinians.
Jews do not have two navels.
Jews do not have horns.
Jews do not control the media.
Jews do not control the daily content of the media.
Jews have never eaten Christian children or killed Christian children.
Jews do not run the United States.
There is no world Zionist conspiracy.
Jew, Jews, Jews.
Most Jews are not Zionists.
Most Jews are secular.
Not all Jews support Israel's internal or external policies.
Most Jews are not religious.
Jews do not have more money than other people.
Jews are not stupider or smarter than other people.
Jews do not control the World Bank or world money supply.
Jews are not sexier or unsexier than other people.
Jews do not harbor gold.
Jews most likely have as much and no more sex than other people.
Jews are not 'clannish' any more than Chinese, Arabs, Germans, Italians,
or Wasps are clannish.
Not all Jews believe in God or a God, and at least one rabbi I know is
atheist.
Jew, Jews, Jews.
Jews did not steal Judaism from Blacks.
The Jews did not run the slave trade.
Jews are no better or worse than any other people.
There was and is no Eternal Jew or Wandering Jew.
Many Jews protest the policies of Israel.
Jews whine no more or less than other people.
If a Jew thinks Israel has the right to exist, that doesn't make him or
her a Zionist.
Not all Israelis are Jews and not all Jews are Israelis.
If a Jew thinks Palestine has a right to exist, that doesn't make him or
her anti-Jewish or anti-Israeli.
Jew, Jews, Jews.
Jews do not have big noses.
Jews are not gutter people and don't belong to a gutter religion.
Most Jewish women are not Jewish American Princesses.
Most Jewish men do not wear yalmukahs or go to synagogue.
Jews are not bad people.
The Protocols of Zion are a forgery.
Jews don't conspire any more or less than other people.
There is no world-wide Jewish conspiracy.
There are no local Jewish conspiracies.
Jews are not anti-Christian or anti-Islam.
Most Jews read the Torah as a historical document, and very few believe it
literally.
Very few Jews statistically are religious.
Jewish men do not menstruate.
No, Jews don't whine over anti-semitism.
Most Jews in the United States intermarry (at least this was true a few
years ago).
Jews do not smell differently than other people.
Jews do not stink.
Jews are not dirty.
Jew, Jews, Jews.
Jew, Jews, Jews.

Most of this is self-evident. And to be honest, it cripples me to write
this. I hear some of these things over and over again. They're on the Net.
They're in the streets. They're in the newspapers. I tended to ignore
them. I'm writing this to clear my head. There are people who liked me who
no longer like me. When I defend Jews, I'm called a Zionist or obsessed
with anti-semitism. I'm neither. I want in fact the discourse to go away.
I'm more concerned about anti-semitism against Arabs, even in the
neighborhood I live in, in Brooklyn. But I can't let this go. It scares
me. It preternaturally scares me. A son of a Holocaust survivor I know is
frightened it will happen again. I don't feel that way. I watch what this
sort of rhetoric does to me. I don't like it. I don't recognize myself in
it. I don't think it should occur this late in the game, this 21st century
of human barbarism. Be it known the Jews are no more or less barbaric,
strangers, than other people. Be it known, I can't escape my heritage, the
culture I was raised in. I don't want to pass or have to pass.

This poster lies

by Arlene Eisen


This poster can be seen at bus stops around San Francisco. Don't believe
the hype.

Israel is not a democracy. Israel is an apartheid state where the
government mandates official discrimination against Palestinians, who
live as second class citizens within the boundaries of Israel that the
UN recognized in 1967.

They are 20 percent of the Israeli population, but, in the Israeli
Parliament (Knesset), they have only 12 out of 120 seats -- one of which
is held by a woman. In 2001, the parliaments of Syria, Tunisia, Morocco,
Sudan, Algeria, Jordan, Egypt and Lebanon all had a higher percentage of
Arab women than did Israel.

This poster, mounted on bus shelters around San Francisco, is a
hypocritical attempt to make Israel seem like it cares about Palestinian
women's liberation when it continues to deny fundamental human rights
not only to Palestinian women but also to their fathers, brothers, sons
and husbands.

Apartheid in Israel means:

l Israel is a "Jewish state" in which Jews are the majority, where Jews
are entitled to special treatment and preferential laws and where any
Jewish person from anywhere in the world has a right to claim Israeli
citizenship. (Palestinians have no right of return to the homes they
lived in before Israel pushed them out in 1948.) By privileging Jews,
the state treats others as second-class citizens. Israel has no
constitution, and its basic law includes no right to equality.

l Jewish organizations, like the Jewish National Fund, have
semi-governmental status and benefit Jews only. They have special rights
to housing, land development, tax benefits.

l Only those who have served in the Israeli Army (or Jewish Yeshiva
students) are eligible for benefits, including access to public
employment, housing, scholarships and mortgages.

l Sixty-one percent of Palestinian women with (second-class) Israeli
citizenship earn less than minimum wage. An Israeli Jew of European
origin makes twice the average pay of a Palestinian Israeli. Of 1,710
directors and managing directors of government-recognized companies,
only two are Palestinian women. There is only one Palestinian woman
university lecturer in Israel and no Palestinian women high school
principals.

l Of the 30 areas in Israel with the highest unemployment rates, 26 are
Palestinian.

l Strict residential segregation is the rule in Israel. Only 8 percent
of all Palestinians with (second-class) Israeli citizenship live in
cities with Jewish populations, and in those cities, they live in
segregated neighborhoods.

l One hundred Palestinian villages within 1967 Israeli boundaries are
not recognized by the Israeli government and therefore receive no
electricity, water or sewer services, no paved roads, schools, hospitals
or clinics. (Yet Jewish settlers are 10 percent of the population of the
West Bank and Gaza and consume more than 50 percent of the water.)

l Palestinians with (second-class) Israeli citizenship cannot buy land
and cannot build on land they own without an Israeli permit, which is
nearly impossible to secure.

l Palestinian political parties admitted into the Knesset cannot stand
for election if they take any position against the Israeli occupation of
Palestinian land.

l Palestinians with (second-class) Israeli citizenship have no freedom
of movement. They cannot visit families or friends who live in the West
Bank or Gaza. With the new apartheid wall, Israel has grabbed more land
and forcibly separated more families.

l Palestinians are subject to administrative detention for six months
without any charges. Detention may be renewed indefinitely. Whenever
Israel declares a state of emergency, Palestinians are subject to
military rule with no civil rights. Israel holds 8,000 Palestinian
political prisoners -- many of whom are women -- all of whom are
separated from their families.

Racism against Palestinians is on the rise. In 1998, 39 percent of
Jewish youth told survey takers they "hated" Arabs, 44 percent believe
"Arab" citizens should be deprived of some of their rights, 19 percent
thought "we should get rid of them."

And there is not even a pretense of democracy for the nearly 3.5 million
Palestinians who live under Israeli occupation in the West Bank and Gaza
Strip.

l Since 2000, Israeli soldiers have killed 3,490 Palestinians -- 19
percent of them under the age of 18 -- and injured 28,297. As of March
2004, Israeli soldiers killed 132 Palestinian children and injured 2,500
on their way to or from school.

l As of March 2004, the Israeli army destroyed and damaged nearly 20,000
homes, 30 mosques, 12 churches and 134 water wells, uprooted 35,000
olive and fruit trees, closed 850 schools and converted 23 schools into
military barracks or detention centers.

l According to a UN count completed in July 2004, Israel maintains 703
checkpoints and road closures in the West Bank -- a territory about the
same size as the greater Bay Area. These checkpoints and the apartheid
wall, which transforms many Palestinian towns into open air prisons,
results in most Palestinian people being cut off from their families,
schools, fields, jobs, markets, clinics and hospitals.

l As a result of this destruction and travel restrictions, 85 percent of
Palestinians in Gaza and 58 percent in the West Bank now live in
poverty, on less than $2 a day.

>Statement by U.S. Senator Barbara Boxer on Her
>Objection to the Certification of Ohio's Electoral Votes
>
>
>For most of us in the Senate and the House, we have spent our
>lives fighting for things we believe in - always fighting to
>make our nation better.
>
>We have fought for social justice.  We have fought for economic

>fought for criminal justice.
>
>Now we must add a new fight - the fight for electoral justice.
>
>Every citizen of this country who is registered to vote should
>be guaranteed that their vote matters, that their vote is
>counted, and that in the voting booth of their community, their
>vote has as much weight as the vote of any Senator, any
>Congressperson, any President, any cabinet member, or any CEO
>of any Fortune 500 Corporation.
>
>I am sure that every one of my colleagues - Democrat,
>Republican, and Independent - agrees with that statement.  That
>in the voting booth, every one is equal.
>
>So now it seems to me that under the Constitution of the United
>States, which guarantees the right to vote, we must ask:
>
>Why did voters in Ohio wait hours in the rain to vote?  Why
>were voters at Kenyan College, for example, made to wait in
>line until nearly 4 a.m. to vote because there were only two
>machines for 1300 voters?
>
>Why did poor and predominantly African-American communities
>have disproportionately long waits?
>
>Why in Franklin County did election officials only use 2,798
>machines when they said they needed 5,000?  Why did they hold
>back 68 machines in warehouses?  Why were 42 of those machines
>in predominantly African-American districts?
>
>Why did, in Columbus area alone, an estimated 5,000 to 10,000
>voters  leave polling places, out of frustration, without
>having voted?   How many more never bothered to vote after they
>heard about this?
>
>Why is it when 638 people voted at a precinct in Franklin
>County, a voting machine awarded 4,258 extra votes to George
>Bush.  Thankfully, they fixed it - but how many other votes did
>the computers get wrong?
>
>Why did Franklin County officials reduce the number of
>electronic voting machines in downtown precincts, while adding
>them in the suburbs?  This also led to long lines.
>
>In Cleveland, why were there thousands of provisional ballots
>disqualified after poll workers gave faulty instructions to

>
>Because of this, and voting irregularities in so many other
>places, I am joining with Congresswoman Stephanie Tubbs Jones
>to cast the light of truth on a flawed system which must be
>fixed now.
>
>Our democracy is the centerpiece of who we are as a nation.
>And it is the fondest hope of all Americans that we can help
>bring democracy to every corner of the world.
>
>As we try to do that, and as we are shedding the blood of our
>military to this end, we must realize that we lose so much
>credibility when our own electoral system needs so much
>improvement.
>
>Yet, in the past four years, this Congress has not done
>everything it should to give confidence to all of our people
>their votes matter.
>
>After passing the Help America Vote Act, nothing more was done.
>
>A year ago, Senators Graham, Clinton and I introduced
>legislation that would have required that electronic voting

>trail would be stored in a secure ballot box and invaluable in
>case of a recount.
>
>There is no reason why the Senate should not have taken up and

>Before I close, I want to thank my colleague from the House,

On reading Lucas Klein's brilliant post, I agree I should have included some of Huang Xiang's poetry. Here is some. As well, his book, "A Bilingual Edition of Poetry out of Communist China by Huang Xiang" is available through Mellen Press (www.mellenpress.com)
Thanks again, Lucas, Hope you enjoy these poems.

DRY BONES
After millions of years,
Millions of years in the layered earth
Maybe someone will
Dig up my
Bones
At that time
He may imagine
A far-distant geological age
A history remote and indistinct
Are these the decayed bones of his own first ancestor
Or the fossil of an ancient biologic skeleton
At that time,
Could he imagine that
This very pile of dry bones
In the world once made their sound
Loved
Hated
Mourned
Cried out
Agitated
He may imagine
That this pile of dry bones
Once had a face contorted with bitterness
Once had eyes that cursed in silence
Once silently endured with bloodless lips tight-closed
Once wrote poems as eternal as the moon and stars
These are the bones of a poet
These are the bones of one who while hoping, lost hope, gave up hope
These are bones that furiously fought
These are the bones of one who walked this world, struggled, was tempered
These are the bones of a skeleton shattered and all put together again
these scattered dry bones of a man
These are the dry bones of jaws that ground together from hatred
These are the dry bones that resisted, loudly clanking
These are the dry bones that have seen the heavenly lightning strike,
have listened, head-cocked, to the growing clamor of all the earth's creatures
These are the dry bones of a Man
After millions of years,
Millions of years in the layered earth
A future anthropologist
Geologist
Or archeologist
When digging up my dead bones
Will, please, under this same burning sun
Raise up these remains of water and air, and
Seek out the Man.
(1968)

SINGING ALONE
Who am I
I am the lonely soul of a waterfall
A poem
Dwelling forever in Solitude
My drifting song is a dream's wandering
Trace
My only audience
The still
(1962)

CHINA, YOU CAN'T REMAIN SILENT
You look like a big docile sea turtle, oh China,
You slowly creep along, always with your head in your shell
Or dopily try to sleep, lying on a misty beach.
Respond to the call of the far-off thunder-claps,
       To the call of the roaring gale
I say, "China, you cannot, you cannot remain silent any more."
On the backer of that contract for endless ages of humiliation,
I see you have compliantly affixed your name and seal;
You hang your head humbly before that empty promise,
And generations of your descendants quietly say, "Yes."
Your chance has come, oh China,
History is waiting for you
The whole world is intently calling and listening for you
                   to say one word ----
"No!"
(1976)

SOLITARY CONFINEMENT

 Water
Drops
Are daylight's only
Drops of
Scenery
Dreams
Sharp and clear like nighttime's
Bells
And gongs
Years of sibilant droplets'
Dripping
Sounds
Prisoners' bare heads
Ringing
Drops of
Deep
Penetrating
Gloom
A thousand prisoners in
This
Instant
A thousand dreams in
This
Drop
(1990, in Wang Wu Prison)

GUITAR
On my body are two guitar strings
One is the Yellow River
One is the Yangtze River
They are tightly strung on my back
Thrumming now two vibrant syllables in my
Own language:
China! China! China!
With every strum
My body is bowed deeper in depression
While the many tears of nostalgia
Embracing my wafting
Cries
Cascade from
Within me
(2000)

I SEE A WAR
I see a war, an invisible war
Being waged in everyone's facial expression
Being waged in countless loudspeakers
Being waged in the ever-frightened look in everyone's eyes
Being waged in the nerve stems beneath everyone's cerebral cortex
It is devastating everyone   Devastating every part end element of people's
      bodies and minds
It uses invisible weapons to press the attack, invisible bayonets, cannons
      and bombs to press the attack
This is an evil war
It is the intangible extension of a tangible war.
It is being waged in the front windows of bookstores
Waged in libraries, and in every song that is taught and sung
Waged in the first year textbooks of grade-schools
Waged in every actor's actions and lines and ever performer's posturing,
      all exactly the same
I see bayonets and soldiers patrolling the lines of my poems
To search into everyone's consience
A stupid, benighted and harsh power oppresses all, dominates all
In face of this terrible unprecedented attack
I see sexual relations in decay
The living in a state of mental disorder
Schizophrenia spreading unchecked, individuality eliminated
Ah, you invisible war, you evil war
You are the continuation and extension of 2,500 years of war to
      consolidate feudal power
You are the concentration and expansion of 2,500 years of war
      to enslave people's minds
You bomb   You blast   You kill   You slaughter
But human nature does not die, conscience does not die, people's
      freedom of spirit does not die
The natural instincts and desires of man's body and soul
Can never be wrenched away or wholly destroyed
1969

SILENT GRAINFIELD IN THE DISTANCE
A silent grainfield in the distance
On the slope of a hill forms a dark-brown river-bank.
Small clustered violets bob on the wind,
From time to time nodding their heads to look at the two of us.
We quietly bow and give them little smiles,
My darling, why are your charming lips so pale?
Are you thinking of some long-gone far-off matter,
Or of the dimming sunlight of the spring?
Hear far-off, there's the sound of a dike collapsing,
Like the sound of the smacking lips of a cow munching grass;
The wind bears the sticky sweetness of budding leaves,
Our fog-befuddled youth returns into our hearts.
And so we two become children once again,
Unable now to recognize each other, under the skies of another time.
Oh, the honeyed grief, the bitter tears,
Should we really know each other, my darling . . . . .
From "My Symphony", 1977


WE HAVE BEEN KEPT APART FOR SO LONG
We have been kept apart for so long a time, my wife
So long that the puppy yoou were raising has grown up.
So long that even the sparrows beneath the eaves have grown old.
The love-birds that you kept in a cage have died because you forgot to feed them;
      the cloud-white long-haired rabbit you kept has run off for lack of
loving care.
My wife, we have been kept apart for so long
At this time of reunion, oh my wife, why does your silence hurt me so?
You come out of your small kitchen, your apron giving off the odor of cooking,
      a hint of laundry soap on your wash-whitened hands.
Why do you turn your face away from me? Why do you hide your two small hands
      behind your back?
Turn your head towards me, my wife, I've already noticed that black mole of
      deep-hidden sadness on your female forehead.
Stretch out your hands to me, oh my wife, let me gently kiss that pair of small
      rough hands that have suffered for the world
Your bitterness, o'erlain with bloody scratches, eats at my heart.
Written at night, hurriedly, under a blanket, in WangWu Prison, 1988

WOMB
I haven't left the stage.
The backdrop sky is still my deep-blue gaze.
A pregnant black bear hides in the cliff-top. I return into myself. Bulging
      rocks are my starting muscles.
Flood waters recede. Coiled behind me
The whole thing hoary as an ancient mammoth pulls back on two sides
Mountain peaks peel back. The Earth's surface splits open. The earth opens
      up a sloping doorway.
I don a zebra. A golden leopard. A peacock's tailfeathers, cruelly
beautiful.
Waves of water buffet me.
Swelling roots split me.
The pillared cliffs, deep red in the setting sun, are motionless in collapse,
My guts daubed with red, and all seized up.
A giant fragment of cliff-rock marks and cuts out my facial openings, and
      etches blue-black waves of dry-winds and a grainy sand-yellow mantle.
I shape the heavens into a woman's graceful arcing posture
Yellow limbs suspend the silence
Of the cliffs.
The shaking cliffs revolve in spirals.
A bunch of red clouds ravenously lick the hollow bones of the giant cliffs'
      morality.
A native girl, facing upwards to conceive
Props open
The swirling cliffs'
Dark
Opening
The center of time
I return to immobility.
August 11, 1985

Does anyone else feel uneasy about the idea of nominating Huang Xiang for
Nobel Prize when none of his poems are quoted, when more attention is paid
to his biography than to his output? Certainly the writer's life has
influenced the Nobel decision in the past, but usually this is pointed out
to undermine the sincerity of the prize, rather than recommend someone to
its ranks.

I'm a huge advocate of Chinese poetry, but I've never heard of Huang Xiang
outside of the context of Movement One, and I don't think I've been given
anything to advocate.

And as much as anyone on the Swedish Academy says that the prize is awarded
to a writer without concern for anyone else writing in that language, the
fact is that it took a hundred years for the Nobel committee to find anyone
in Chinese literature. Gao Xingjian--laureate in 2000, whose works are also
banned in mainland China--got the prize when many in China were at least as
worthy (Ba Jin, Shi Zhecun, Mo Yan, Yu Hua), and in some ways it's too bad:
he received his nod too recently for anyone else--including the surviving
Misty Poets, such as Bei Dao, Yang Lian, Shu Ting, Jiang He--to be honored,
anyway.

A word of advice to Paul Catafago and the Movement One backers of Huang
Xiang, anyway: the person who really matters here is Goran Malmqvist, the
only Chinese scholar on the Swedish Academy. He's the one who translated Gao
Xingjian's works into Swedish for the rest of the Academy to read, and he's
the one whose ear you ought to bend if you want your man to get a Nobel.

Subject: A great Chinese poet and the Nobel Prize (OPEN, especially Lit
Profs)

Our organization, Movement One:Creative Coalition, a New York based arts and
eduaction non-profit that amongst other things has originated and organized
the annual Queens International Poetry Festival, has begun a campaign to
have Huang Xiang, the great Chinese poet, recognized with the Nobel Prize in
Literature in 2005.
Imprisoned twelve years- and twice put on death row- because he was the
organizaer of the Democracy Wall Movement during the Cutlural Revolution,
Huang Xiang is a poet whose work has been compared to that of Pablo
Neruda's, Anna Ahkmatova's, Walt Whitman's and Nazim Hikmet (who ironically
was imprisoned twelve years in his own native country- Turkey).
Though less known than other Chinese writers (his work is still banned in
China), Huang Xiang has had over fifteen books published, and just last
year, Mellen Press put out the first book of English translations of his
work, A Bilingual edition of Poetry Out Of Communist China by Huang Xiang.
Currently, Huang Xiang and his wife, the writer Qiuxao Yulan live in
Pittsburgh, hosted by the International Network of the Cities of Asylum
(whose President is Russell Banks).
Under the rules set forth by the Nobel Committee, there are four types of
individuals who can nominate someone for the Nobel: 1)members of the Swedish
Academy or similar academy (therefore, we believe you are eligible if you
are a member of the Academy of American Poets 2)Professors of Literature or
Linguistics at a university or college
3)Past winners of the Nobel Prize
4)Presdent of a "Society of Authors" such as PEN, etc.

If you fit any of those criteria, we urge you nominate Huang Xiang for the
Nobel Prize in Literature. For more information, click on the nobel campaign
link on our website, or write back to me.
Thank you

You know, Mairead, that's the best method for dealing with uppity
editors at large like Messr. Dave Barratier, who tends ta drag that left
foot of his into da match a little too much since the Blood Tubs knocked
him cold half a year back.  Call him a wag and then go right for the
throat--Just exactly when will you be publishing those poems of mine
hmmmmmmmmm?  Your feint has him off balance and now he's circling,
gloves up before his face, assuming that "crazy Dave" stance that's
gotten him so many championships in the past.  But this time, at "da
Zinc baa" it just ain't gonna work, I know it!  Mano a Mano, Mairead!
Mano a Mano! Work da body and den da head.  If you kill da body, da head
ain't got noplace to go!  Be careful. though.  Don't let him get his
capacious brow south of your chin 'cause maybe he's gonna come up real
sudden and you'll be seeing stars for the rest of da evening and
spittin' a few teeth too!  He's been known to save a match when he was
down on one knee and panting hard using just such a technique!  I wish I
could see yer match and be there to keep his Pavement Saw Uglies from
turning this tea party into a real dust up, but am now on the final leg
of a journey to and from the U.S.A. that's been--to say da least-- a
memorable one for the covert movement of Gouged Eagles, if you get my
drift.  Jet-lagged and seeing things that ain't there out of the
corners of my eyes, and looking around for some bee-pollen extract to
knock back and thereby keep this old confection of fat, sugar and
gristle viable for another fortnight, I'm sending some of my best boys
your way--you'll recognize them from your match against The Benecia Boy
last fall--Johnny Twist and Tiny Moe from da Bowery.  They send their
regards to yew and da little ones.  You can rely on them to keep
everything on the up and up, Mairead.  Next time I hear from ya, I
expect to be congratulatin' you for making short work of ol' Dancin'
Dave.  We'll show 'em that we ain't French froofroos or paste-board
curlacues waintin' for a wet squib to stack a cloud or two the way of
the Five Points.  We'll dazzle dem with some peacock footwork.  But I
caution ya, watch yer back.  If he brings that Missus of his make sure
she's patted down real good for da knuckle dusters she generally keeps
here and there on her person.  How do I know this?  Rat Boy keeps me up
ta snuff.    I've got some of my own Hard Earned ridin' on you,
Mairead, so feel free to land that famous roundhouse whenever yew so
desire!  And tell that manager of yers to send whatever accrues to me
c/o Wang Fat on da lower East side.  It'll catch up to me when I have
the long lay-over in Macau previous to the long last stretch to
Nagasaki, Nippon.  The Sleepless Eye.  J.G.

And it worked and was fine.  Many thanks to Dave K. and everyone who
showed up on the 6th to see us and sample our goods.  Am hard-pressed to

Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1
Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable

The interesting recent discussion of Joan Houlihan's review prompts me to=

submit to this group an essay of my own, "The One Great Poem:  The Poetri=
es of
The Oxford Books of English Verse," originally published in the English p=
oetry
magazine Acumen, which may also provoke some useful dialog on this list.

I'm not claiming my pronouncements are so profound as to compel everyone'=
s
respect, but it seems reasonable to suppose that they will draw attention=
 here
for the much the same reason as Houlihan's review did:  like it, this ess=
ay
deals with issues with which many list members are personally or
professionally engaged, and it makes direct judgments which some people a=
re
likely to endorse, and others will surely take strong exception to.  In o=
ther
words, I'm presenting myself here not as an authority giving a lecture, b=
ut as
something more like the guy at the carnival sitting on a collapsible benc=
h
above a tub of water, and inviting you all to throw the balls which will =
dump
him in.

Though the essay is not particularly long -- some three or four printed p=
ages
-- it's a bit too long to fit within the size limit stipulated by the lis=
t
guidelines.  It's available on line, but I've found that just posting a U=
RL
often doesn't lead to much discussion.  So as a compromise, I'll give in =
my
next message the first part of the article with a pointer to the whole
version.

I encourage everyone to be as forthcoming in their reactions to this essa=
y as
I was in writing it.

The One Great Poem:  The poetries of The Oxford Books of English Verse  =


   When The Oxford Book of English Verse by A.  T.  Quiller-Couch appeare=
d in
1900, Punch recommended it as "a most useful book for those who, being no=
t
'unaccustomed to public speaking' and loving to embellish their flow of
language with quotations from poets whose works they have never read ... =
 are
only too grateful to any well-read collector placing so excellent a store=
 as
this at their service,"  and predicted that because those who owned his
anthology would be spared the tedious necessity of actually reading poetr=
y,
"many an after-dinner and learned society speaker will bless the name of =
this
'Q.  C.'"   Behind its deadpan humor, this statement tells us quite a bit=

about taste and the anthologist's relation to it in the world into which =
the
Oxford Book was born:  if the joke depends on the reality that few people=
 read
poetry, it equally depends on the pretence that everybody is supposed to,=
 and
it also implies a canon of poetry which one ought to read.  Such had cert=
ainly
been the case in the day of Q's mentor Francis Palgrave, who said in his
preface to The Golden Treasury, the progenitor of the three successive Ox=
ford
books here to be considered, that he would "regard as his fittest readers=

those who love poetry so well that he can offer them nothing not already =
known
and valued,"  which assumes there exists a body of verse valued by social=

consensus. Q's own characterization of his job as "to bring home and rend=
er so
great a spoil [of poetry] compendiously ...   to serve those who already =
love
poetry and to implant that love in some young minds not yet initiated," =

places him squarely in his mentor's tradition as summarizer and transmitt=
er of
the nation's poetic taste.      =

   If Q then was following taste, where did it lead him?  Did he produce =
an
anthology giving us a unified array of poems which are, in those words of=

Shelley which Palgrave had quoted as The Golden Treasury's program, "epis=
odes
to that great Poem which all poets, like the co-operating thoughts of one=

great mind, have built up since the beginning of the world"?  Does his bo=
ok
embody that one great poem?  And if so, what does it tell us about that o=
ne
great mind?     =

   Reading the opening pages of Q's 1939 edition (on which the comments i=
n
this essay will be based), we may see them as an overture, presenting the=

motifs and tensions through which English poetry will evolve.  The very f=
irst
poem, the "Cuckoo Song," with its joyous bird singing amid the irrepressi=
ble
regeneration of the natural world, seems drawn from an England that exist=
ed
before the English nation or even the English language, a pagan England i=
n
which nature did not have to be redeemed because it was already sacred.  =
This
animist substrate of consciousness, usually incarnate (it is deeper than
symbolism) in wild bird song, is a constant musical accompaniment to the
subsequent voice of English lyric as recorded in Q's selections; often hu=
shed,
sometimes to silence, it breaks through ecstatically in the 15th century =
in
the anonymous "Hit is full merry in feyre foreste to here the foulys song=
,"
becomes a continually interwoven lovers' refrain in the Renaissance with
Sydney's Philomel "mournfully bewailing," Shakespeare's Amiens under the
greenwood tree in uncruel Arden, who loves to "turn his merry note unto t=
he
sweet bird's throat," and Nashe's spring when "Young lovers meet" to the
chorus of "Cuckoo, jug-jug, pu-we, to-witta-woo!", and then for two centu=
ries
becomes occasional and tamed, a bird caged in metaphor, like Marvell's
birdlike soul which "sits and sings, then whets and combs its silver wing=
s,"
until the wild song is stunningly released again with a passion only made=

stronger by six generations of dour Puritanism and rationalist repression=
 in
Shelley, whose skylark "panted forth a flood of rapture so divine."     =

   The "Cuckoo Song" can stand as an example of the thematic nature of Q'=
s
volume.  We might also notice that Q's second piece, "The Irish Dancer,"
raises the question of the relationship of English poetry to English
nationality, a problem to which all three editors of the Oxford books dev=
ised
very different solutions, none of them to general satisfaction.  Or that =
the
third piece, an erotic upgrading of one Alison in language which verges o=
n
liturgical, generates echoes of subsequent beloveds whose allure is set f=
orth
in terms of divine purity.  Those who smile at the attribution of such
sophisticated programming to the old-fashioned Q ought to consider his co=
mment
that "the anthologist's is not quite the dilettante business for which it=
 is
too often and ignorantly derided."      =

   From such beginnings Q's anthology presents a poetry evolving by a
dialectical process of opposition and reconciliation of fundamental cultu=
ral
polarities:  Christian denial of the world against pagan celebration of
nature, aristocratic elegance against homely virtue, and sensual gorgeous=
ness
against rational austerity, to mention only a few.  If this torrent of ve=
rse
flows within the banks of a limited taste, it also proceeds with almost
unremitting excellence until well into the nineteenth century , when it
falters badly.  The last two hundred and fifty pages are a disaster.  Not=
 all
the poetry there is bad, and some which is has an excuse:  we may tolerat=
e,
for instance, encountering lines like "Riches I hold in light esteem, And=
 Love
I laugh to scorn," once we learn that they were written by Emily Bront=EB=
, and
it must be admitted that some are poems, such as Cory's "Heraclitus," whi=
ch we
cherish exactly because they are bad, like some appalling lamp given us b=
y
Auntie twenty years ago which we have come to love not despite but becaus=
e of
its hideousness.  But what we have here for the most part is a parade of
inexcusably bad versifiers, =

Dear Robert,

I'm not interested in the Houlihan discussion; I remarked on the
possibly sexist character of the criticism and probably shouldn't have,
given my lack of interest.

It's interesting what you say about Ireland and its ironic culture.  I
remember, years ago, when I worked in the Queens' Council on the Arts, a
younger colleague remarking on my humor (I was only a few months out of
Ireland at the time) and just as I was getting ready for bouquets of
praise she said how much she hated it: It reminded her of her father,
who was of Irish descent.  I was shocked: How could anyone *not like*
our delightful national wit?  18 years down the line I'm not too crazy
about it myself.  I associate heavy irony, in the case of Ireland, with
the homogeneity of its culture.  Irony doesn't translate without that
common bottom line.  I think one of the reasons I emigrated was to
surround myself with difference and to strike myself dumb so the old
phrases would no longer work.  True enough no-one understood a word I
was saying and I had to learn to talk again.  Teasing, a southern vice
as you say, is probably intensely small-community bound also.

Mairead

>>> robertmc00@YAHOO.COM 01/07/05 3:11 PM >>>
Mairead,

My responses are not sexist.  They are direct and cutting, but Ms.
Houlihan is as well.  Ms. is a sign of respect from where I hail, but we
do it use it to belittle people.  Teasing is a southern vice, but when
you have a thoroughly ironic culture (cf. Ireland), that is what you
get.  It don't mean we wouldn't serve her delicious repast if she
visited, but having read her too much I know that she never says
anything of interest about actual poems.

But let us do read:

1) After a year of metaphorical rocks with unintelligible notes affixed
to them crashing through my window and with the tire-squeal of the
Winter-Wolfe-Skanky-Possum gang still ringing in my ears, was happy to
have a chance to curl up with a hot cup of tea and this respected
practitioner's description of what's "best" about such lines as: "no
dirt aliens, don't waste good mascara ... "

2) Whatever else can be said of them, the
first-person-anecdotal-narrative-confessional (aka 'mainstream') poems
that have been outnumbered in this volume by such writings as the above,
can at least be critically sorted (some are clearly better than others,
regardless of whether or not they fit a particular editor or critic's
'taste').

3) Fortunately, I had Hejinian's clear prose to guide me. For
enlightenment on her selection process, I returned to her introduction:
"Dynamic, ever-changing, poetry (and American poetry in particular) is a
site of perpetual transitions and unpredictable metamorphoses, but there
is no end point in poetry."

Comment on no.1:  Isn't Houlihan polemical, sarcastic and condescending
("unintelligible notes," "Winter-Wolfe-Skanky-Possum", "respected
practictioner." ) There is no gender for pungent language.

Comment on no. 2:  She can't read LiP, since she can't sort it.  She has
no measure to weigh the worth of each poem.  Houlihan wants to know what
poem is best absolutely.  This means she wants a poll and a canon.
Which relates to number 3

Comment on no 3:  Failing to be able to read the poetry, she goes to
Heijinian's distinctly clear prose.  And fails to note that Heijinian
disagrees strongly with her canonizing, cherry-picking technique:
"there is no end point to poetry."  Yes, we can make local
discriminations and say what we like.  Aesthetic ideas are concepts.  We
can discuss them and we wouldn't discuss something that had no content
(oh, wait a minute, that is idealistic).  But they have no grounding.
You can't a priori or rationally choose between them.  You can't set up
a metric.  Heijinian knows her Kant far better than Houlihan.

Game match set to Heijinian.  My question to Houlihan is why do the
review (or not review:  aside from lazy selections from two poems, she
has nothing specific (and nothing specific to say about the selections
either) in the first place when she has nothing to say about the poems.
She is simply pontificating about what she thinks is common sense.  I
reserve comment about what is common about this sense, but Houlihan
simply wants to claim that there is no reading of LP or LiP.  I think
there is strong evidence to believe that many, starting with Fence and
Verse but spreading much more widely than this column not worth the
paper it is written on, think otherwise.

And to Hoerman:  I disagree that this is equivalent to Silliman's School
of Quietude jab.  That is accurate and clever.  Houlihan just represents
a certain institution giving off steam as it realizes it is losing a
grip.  Geez, find a critic who at least can read.  They are out there.
Of course, there is always a danger that they will give up cherished
principles in the light of evidence (cf. Empson).

No kidding Jon, there are people who criticise without anyone
listening to them because they are the usual ones who anyhow do not
like anything, then there are those who know how to hit things down in
a professional way, and once this is done, that's about it for a long
long time.

Jews


I am losing friends over this. I reach states of no return over this.
I respond poorly and unfairly. I'm tired of thinking of myself, 'Jew,'
and listening and watching 'Jew' return in guises I don't recognize.
Needless to say:

Jews did not leave the World Trade Center just before it was hit.
Jews came to work that day like everyone else.
It was not a Zionist conspiracy.
Jews did not cause the Tsunami.
Jews went through the Holocaust which killed a lot of them.
Jew, Jew, Jews.
Jews do not want to slaughter Palestinians.
Jews do not have two navels.
Jews do not have horns.
Jews do not control the media.
Jews do not control the daily content of the media.
Jews have never eaten Christian children or killed Christian children.
Jews do not run the United States.
There is no world Zionist conspiracy.
Jew, Jews, Jews.
Most Jews are not Zionists.
Most Jews are secular.
Not all Jews support Israel's internal or external policies.
Most Jews are not religious.
Jews do not have more money than other people.
Jews are not stupider or smarter than other people.
Jews do not control the World Bank or world money supply.
Jews are not sexier or unsexier than other people.
Jews do not harbor gold.
Jews most likely have as much and no more sex than other people.
Jews are not 'clannish' any more than Chinese, Arabs, Germans, Italians,
or Wasps are clannish.
Not all Jews believe in God or a God, and at least one rabbi I know is
atheist.
Jew, Jews, Jews.
Jews did not steal Judaism from Blacks.
The Jews did not run the slave trade.
Jews are no better or worse than any other people.
There was and is no Eternal Jew or Wandering Jew.
Many Jews protest the policies of Israel.
Jews whine no more or less than other people.
If a Jew thinks Israel has the right to exist, that doesn't make him or
her a Zionist.
Not all Israelis are Jews and not all Jews are Israelis.
If a Jew thinks Palestine has a right to exist, that doesn't make him or
her anti-Jewish or anti-Israeli.
Jew, Jews, Jews.
Jews do not have big noses.
Jews are not gutter people and don't belong to a gutter religion.
Most Jewish women are not Jewish American Princesses.
Most Jewish men do not wear yalmukahs or go to synagogue.
Jews are not bad people.
The Protocols of Zion are a forgery.
Jews don't conspire any more or less than other people.
There is no world-wide Jewish conspiracy.
There are no local Jewish conspiracies.
Jews are not anti-Christian or anti-Islam.
Most Jews read the Torah as a historical document, and very few believe it
literally.
Very few Jews statistically are religious.
Jewish men do not menstruate.
No, Jews don't whine over anti-semitism.
Most Jews in the United States intermarry (at least this was true a few
years ago).
Jews do not smell differently than other people.
Jews do not stink.
Jews are not dirty.
Jew, Jews, Jews.
Jew, Jews, Jews.

Most of this is self-evident. And to be honest, it cripples me to write
this. I hear some of these things over and over again. They're on the Net.
They're in the streets. They're in the newspapers. I tended to ignore
them. I'm writing this to clear my head. There are people who liked me who
no longer like me. When I defend Jews, I'm called a Zionist or obsessed
with anti-semitism. I'm neither. I want in fact the discourse to go away.
I'm more concerned about anti-semitism against Arabs, even in the
neighborhood I live in, in Brooklyn. But I can't let this go. It scares
me. It preternaturally scares me. A son of a Holocaust survivor I know is
frightened it will happen again. I don't feel that way. I watch what this
sort of rhetoric does to me. I don't like it. I don't recognize myself in
it. I don't think it should occur this late in the game, this 21st century
of human barbarism. Be it known the Jews are no more or less barbaric,
strangers, than other people. Be it known, I can't escape my heritage, the
culture I was raised in. I don't want to pass or have to pass.

This poster lies

by Arlene Eisen


This poster can be seen at bus stops around San Francisco. Don't believe
the hype.
Photo: Arlene Eisen

Israel is not a democracy. Israel is an apartheid state where the
government mandates official discrimination against Palestinians, who
live as second class citizens within the boundaries of Israel that the
UN recognized in 1967.

They are 20 percent of the Israeli population, but, in the Israeli
Parliament (Knesset), they have only 12 out of 120 seats -- one of which
is held by a woman. In 2001, the parliaments of Syria, Tunisia, Morocco,
Sudan, Algeria, Jordan, Egypt and Lebanon all had a higher percentage of
Arab women than did Israel.

This poster, mounted on bus shelters around San Francisco, is a
hypocritical attempt to make Israel seem like it cares about Palestinian
women's liberation when it continues to deny fundamental human rights
not only to Palestinian women but also to their fathers, brothers, sons
and husbands.

Apartheid in Israel means:

l Israel is a "Jewish state" in which Jews are the majority, where Jews
are entitled to special treatment and preferential laws and where any
Jewish person from anywhere in the world has a right to claim Israeli
citizenship. (Palestinians have no right of return to the homes they
lived in before Israel pushed them out in 1948.) By privileging Jews,
the state treats others as second-class citizens. Israel has no
constitution, and its basic law includes no right to equality.

l Jewish organizations, like the Jewish National Fund, have
semi-governmental status and benefit Jews only. They have special rights
to housing, land development, tax benefits.

l Only those who have served in the Israeli Army (or Jewish Yeshiva
students) are eligible for benefits, including access to public
employment, housing, scholarships and mortgages.

l Sixty-one percent of Palestinian women with (second-class) Israeli
citizenship earn less than minimum wage. An Israeli Jew of European
origin makes twice the average pay of a Palestinian Israeli. Of 1,710
directors and managing directors of government-recognized companies,
only two are Palestinian women. There is only one Palestinian woman
university lecturer in Israel and no Palestinian women high school
principals.

l Of the 30 areas in Israel with the highest unemployment rates, 26 are
Palestinian.

l Strict residential segregation is the rule in Israel. Only 8 percent
of all Palestinians with (second-class) Israeli citizenship live in
cities with Jewish populations, and in those cities, they live in
segregated neighborhoods.

l One hundred Palestinian villages within 1967 Israeli boundaries are
not recognized by the Israeli government and therefore receive no
electricity, water or sewer services, no paved roads, schools, hospitals
or clinics. (Yet Jewish settlers are 10 percent of the population of the
West Bank and Gaza and consume more than 50 percent of the water.)

l Palestinians with (second-class) Israeli citizenship cannot buy land
and cannot build on land they own without an Israeli permit, which is
nearly impossible to secure.

l Palestinian political parties admitted into the Knesset cannot stand
for election if they take any position against the Israeli occupation of
Palestinian land.

l Palestinians with (second-class) Israeli citizenship have no freedom
of movement. They cannot visit families or friends who live in the West
Bank or Gaza. With the new apartheid wall, Israel has grabbed more land
and forcibly separated more families.

l Palestinians are subject to administrative detention for six months
without any charges. Detention may be renewed indefinitely. Whenever
Israel declares a state of emergency, Palestinians are subject to
military rule with no civil rights. Israel holds 8,000 Palestinian
political prisoners -- many of whom are women -- all of whom are
separated from their families.

Racism against Palestinians is on the rise. In 1998, 39 percent of
Jewish youth told survey takers they "hated" Arabs, 44 percent believe
"Arab" citizens should be deprived of some of their rights, 19 percent
thought "we should get rid of them."

And there is not even a pretense of democracy for the nearly 3.5 million
Palestinians who live under Israeli occupation in the West Bank and Gaza
Strip.

l Since 2000, Israeli soldiers have killed 3,490 Palestinians -- 19
percent of them under the age of 18 -- and injured 28,297. As of March
2004, Israeli soldiers killed 132 Palestinian children and injured 2,500
on their way to or from school.

l As of March 2004, the Israeli army destroyed and damaged nearly 20,000
homes, 30 mosques, 12 churches and 134 water wells, uprooted 35,000
olive and fruit trees, closed 850 schools and converted 23 schools into
military barracks or detention centers.

l According to a UN count completed in July 2004, Israel maintains 703
checkpoints and road closures in the West Bank -- a territory about the
same size as the greater Bay Area. These checkpoints and the apartheid
wall, which transforms many Palestinian towns into open air prisons,
results in most Palestinian people being cut off from their families,
schools, fields, jobs, markets, clinics and hospitals.

l As a result of this destruction and travel restrictions, 85 percent of
Palestinians in Gaza and 58 percent in the West Bank now live in
poverty, on less than $2 a day.

>===================================================
>
>Statement by U.S. Senator Barbara Boxer on Her
>Objection to the Certification of Ohio's Electoral Votes
>
>
>For most of us in the Senate and the House, we have spent our
>lives fighting for things we believe in - always fighting to
>make our nation better.
>
>We have fought for social justice.  We have fought for economic
>justice.  We have fought for environmental justice.  We have
>fought for criminal justice.
>
>Now we must add a new fight - the fight for electoral justice.
>
>Every citizen of this country who is registered to vote should
>be guaranteed that their vote matters, that their vote is
>counted, and that in the voting booth of their community, their
>vote has as much weight as the vote of any Senator, any
>Congressperson, any President, any cabinet member, or any CEO
>of any Fortune 500 Corporation.
>
>I am sure that every one of my colleagues - Democrat,
>Republican, and Independent - agrees with that statement.  That
>in the voting booth, every one is equal.
>
>So now it seems to me that under the Constitution of the United
>States, which guarantees the right to vote, we must ask:
>
>Why did voters in Ohio wait hours in the rain to vote?  Why
>were voters at Kenyan College, for example, made to wait in
>line until nearly 4 a.m. to vote because there were only two
>machines for 1300 voters?
>
>Why did poor and predominantly African-American communities
>have disproportionately long waits?
>
>Why in Franklin County did election officials only use 2,798
>machines when they said they needed 5,000?  Why did they hold
>back 68 machines in warehouses?  Why were 42 of those machines
>in predominantly African-American districts?
>
>Why did, in Columbus area alone, an estimated 5,000 to 10,000
>voters  leave polling places, out of frustration, without
>having voted?   How many more never bothered to vote after they
>heard about this?
>
>Why is it when 638 people voted at a precinct in Franklin
>County, a voting machine awarded 4,258 extra votes to George
>Bush.  Thankfully, they fixed it - but how many other votes did
>the computers get wrong?
>
>Why did Franklin County officials reduce the number of
>electronic voting machines in downtown precincts, while adding
>them in the suburbs?  This also led to long lines.
>
>In Cleveland, why were there thousands of provisional ballots
>disqualified after poll workers gave faulty instructions to
>voters?
>
>Because of this, and voting irregularities in so many other
>places, I am joining with Congresswoman Stephanie Tubbs Jones
>to cast the light of truth on a flawed system which must be
>fixed now.
>
>Our democracy is the centerpiece of who we are as a nation.
>And it is the fondest hope of all Americans that we can help
>bring democracy to every corner of the world.
>
>As we try to do that, and as we are shedding the blood of our
>military to this end, we must realize that we lose so much
>credibility when our own electoral system needs so much
>improvement.
>
>Yet, in the past four years, this Congress has not done
>everything it should to give confidence to all of our people
>their votes matter.
>
>After passing the Help America Vote Act, nothing more was done.
>
>A year ago, Senators Graham, Clinton and I introduced
>legislation that would have required that electronic voting
>systems provide a paper  record to verify a vote.  That paper
>trail would be stored in a secure ballot box and invaluable in
>case of a recount.
>
>There is no reason why the Senate should not have taken up and
>passed that bill.   At the very least, a hearing should have
>been held.  But it never happened.
>
>Before I close, I want to thank my colleague from the House,
>Congresswoman Stephanie Tubbs Jones.
>
>Her letter to me asking for my intervention was substantive and

>
>As I wrote to her, I was particularly moved by her point that

>
>The Congresswoman has tremendous respect in her state of Ohio,

On reading Lucas Klein's brilliant post, I agree I should have included some
of Huang Xiang's poetry. Here is some. As well, his book, "A Bilingual
Edition of Poetry out of Communist China by Huang Xiang" is available
through Mellen Press (www.mellenpress.com)
Thanks again, Lucas, Hope you enjoy these poems.

DRY BONES
After millions of years,
Millions of years in the layered earth
Maybe someone will
Dig up my
Bones
At that time
He may imagine
A far-distant geological age
A history remote and indistinct
Are these the decayed bones of his own first ancestor
Or the fossil of an ancient biologic skeleton
At that time,
Could he imagine that
This very pile of dry bones
In the world once made their sound
Loved
Hated
Mourned
Cried out
Agitated
He may imagine
That this pile of dry bones
Once had a face contorted with bitterness
Once had eyes that cursed in silence
Once silently endured with bloodless lips tight-closed
Once wrote poems as eternal as the moon and stars
These are the bones of a poet
These are the bones of one who while hoping, lost hope, gave up hope
These are bones that furiously fought
These are the bones of one who walked this world, struggled, was tempered
These are the bones of a skeleton shattered and all put together again
these scattered dry bones of a man
These are the dry bones of jaws that ground together from hatred
These are the dry bones that resisted, loudly clanking
These are the dry bones that have seen the heavenly lightning strike,
have listened, head-cocked, to the growing clamor of all the earth's
creatures
These are the dry bones of a Man
After millions of years,
Millions of years in the layered earth
A future anthropologist
Geologist
Or archeologist
When digging up my dead bones
Will, please, under this same burning sun
Raise up these remains of water and air, and
Seek out the Man.
(1968)

SINGING ALONE
Who am I
I am the lonely soul of a waterfall
A poem
Dwelling forever in Solitude
My drifting song is a dream's wandering
Trace
My only audience
The still
(1962)

CHINA, YOU CAN'T REMAIN SILENT
You look like a big docile sea turtle, oh China,
You slowly creep along, always with your head in your shell
Or dopily try to sleep, lying on a misty beach.
Respond to the call of the far-off thunder-claps,
       To the call of the roaring gale
I say, "China, you cannot, you cannot remain silent any more."
On the backer of that contract for endless ages of humiliation,
I see you have compliantly affixed your name and seal;
You hang your head humbly before that empty promise,
And generations of your descendants quietly say, "Yes."
Your chance has come, oh China,
History is waiting for you
The whole world is intently calling and listening for you
                   to say one word ----
"No!"
(1976)

SOLITARY CONFINEMENT

 Water
Drops
Are daylight's only
Drops of
Scenery
Dreams
Sharp and clear like nighttime's
Bells
And gongs
Years of sibilant droplets'
Dripping
Sounds
Prisoners' bare heads
Ringing
Drops of
Deep
Penetrating
Gloom
A thousand prisoners in
This
Instant
A thousand dreams in
This
Drop
(1990, in Wang Wu Prison)

GUITAR
On my body are two guitar strings
One is the Yellow River
One is the Yangtze River
They are tightly strung on my back
Thrumming now two vibrant syllables in my
Own language:
China! China! China!
With every strum
My body is bowed deeper in depression
While the many tears of nostalgia
Embracing my wafting
Cries
Cascade from
Within me
(2000)

I SEE A WAR
I see a war, an invisible war
Being waged in everyone's facial expression
Being waged in countless loudspeakers
Being waged in the ever-frightened look in everyone's eyes
Being waged in the nerve stems beneath everyone's cerebral cortex
It is devastating everyone   Devastating every part end element of people's
      bodies and minds
It uses invisible weapons to press the attack, invisible bayonets, cannons
      and bombs to press the attack
This is an evil war
It is the intangible extension of a tangible war.
It is being waged in the front windows of bookstores
Waged in libraries, and in every song that is taught and sung
Waged in the first year textbooks of grade-schools
Waged in every actor's actions and lines and ever performer's posturing,
      all exactly the same
I see bayonets and soldiers patrolling the lines of my poems
To search into everyone's consience
A stupid, benighted and harsh power oppresses all, dominates all
In face of this terrible unprecedented attack
I see sexual relations in decay
The living in a state of mental disorder
Schizophrenia spreading unchecked, individuality eliminated
Ah, you invisible war, you evil war
You are the continuation and extension of 2,500 years of war to
      consolidate feudal power
You are the concentration and expansion of 2,500 years of war
      to enslave people's minds
You bomb   You blast   You kill   You slaughter
But human nature does not die, conscience does not die, people's
      freedom of spirit does not die
The natural instincts and desires of man's body and soul
Can never be wrenched away or wholly destroyed
1969

SILENT GRAINFIELD IN THE DISTANCE
A silent grainfield in the distance
On the slope of a hill forms a dark-brown river-bank.
Small clustered violets bob on the wind,
From time to time nodding their heads to look at the two of us.
We quietly bow and give them little smiles,
My darling, why are your charming lips so pale?
Are you thinking of some long-gone far-off matter,
Or of the dimming sunlight of the spring?
Hear far-off, there's the sound of a dike collapsing,
Like the sound of the smacking lips of a cow munching grass;
The wind bears the sticky sweetness of budding leaves,
Our fog-befuddled youth returns into our hearts.
And so we two become children once again,
Unable now to recognize each other, under the skies of another time.
Oh, the honeyed grief, the bitter tears,
Should we really know each other, my darling . . . . .
From "My Symphony", 1977


WE HAVE BEEN KEPT APART FOR SO LONG
We have been kept apart for so long a time, my wife
So long that the puppy yoou were raising has grown up.
So long that even the sparrows beneath the eaves have grown old.
The love-birds that you kept in a cage have died because you forgot to feed
them;
      the cloud-white long-haired rabbit you kept has run off for lack of
loving care.
My wife, we have been kept apart for so long
At this time of reunion, oh my wife, why does your silence hurt me so?
You come out of your small kitchen, your apron giving off the odor of
cooking,
      a hint of laundry soap on your wash-whitened hands.
Why do you turn your face away from me? Why do you hide your two small hands
      behind your back?
Turn your head towards me, my wife, I've already noticed that black mole of
      deep-hidden sadness on your female forehead.
Stretch out your hands to me, oh my wife, let me gently kiss that pair of
small
      rough hands that have suffered for the world
Your bitterness, o'erlain with bloody scratches, eats at my heart.
Written at night, hurriedly, under a blanket, in WangWu Prison, 1988

WOMB
I haven't left the stage.
The backdrop sky is still my deep-blue gaze.
A pregnant black bear hides in the cliff-top. I return into myself. Bulging
      rocks are my starting muscles.
Flood waters recede. Coiled behind me
The whole thing hoary as an ancient mammoth pulls back on two sides
Mountain peaks peel back. The Earth's surface splits open. The earth opens
      up a sloping doorway.
I don a zebra. A golden leopard. A peacock's tailfeathers, cruelly
beautiful.
Waves of water buffet me.
Swelling roots split me.
The pillared cliffs, deep red in the setting sun, are motionless in
collapse,
My guts daubed with red, and all seized up.
A giant fragment of cliff-rock marks and cuts out my facial openings, and
      etches blue-black waves of dry-winds and a grainy sand-yellow mantle.
I shape the heavens into a woman's graceful arcing posture
Yellow limbs suspend the silence
Of the cliffs.
The shaking cliffs revolve in spirals.
A bunch of red clouds ravenously lick the hollow bones of the giant cliffs'
      morality.
A native girl, facing upwards to conceive
Props open
The swirling cliffs'
Dark
Opening
The center of time
I return to immobility.
August 11, 1985




Lucas Klein <LKlein@CIPHERJOURNAL.COM> wrote:
Does anyone else feel uneasy about the idea of nominating Huang Xiang for
Nobel Prize when none of his poems are quoted, when more attention is paid
to his biography than to his output? Certainly the writer's life has
influenced the Nobel decision in the past, but usually this is pointed out
to undermine the sincerity of the prize, rather than recommend someone to
its ranks.

I'm a huge advocate of Chinese poetry, but I've never heard of Huang Xiang
outside of the context of Movement One, and I don't think I've been given
anything to advocate.

And as much as anyone on the Swedish Academy says that the prize is awarded
to a writer without concern for anyone else writing in that language, the
fact is that it took a hundred years for the Nobel committee to find anyone
in Chinese literature. Gao Xingjian--laureate in 2000, whose works are also
banned in mainland China--got the prize when many in China were at least as
worthy (Ba Jin, Shi Zhecun, Mo Yan, Yu Hua), and in some ways it's too bad:
he received his nod too recently for anyone else--including the surviving
Misty Poets, such as Bei Dao, Yang Lian, Shu Ting, Jiang He--to be honored,
anyway.

A word of advice to Paul Catafago and the Movement One backers of Huang
Xiang, anyway: the person who really matters here is Goran Malmqvist, the
only Chinese scholar on the Swedish Academy. He's the one who translated Gao
Xingjian's works into Swedish for the rest of the Academy to read, and he's
the one whose ear you ought to bend if you want your man to get a Nobel.

Subject: A great Chinese poet and the Nobel Prize (OPEN, especially Lit
Profs)

Our organization, Movement One:Creative Coalition, a New York based arts and
eduaction non-profit that amongst other things has originated and organized
the annual Queens International Poetry Festival, has begun a campaign to
have Huang Xiang, the great Chinese poet, recognized with the Nobel Prize in
Literature in 2005.
Imprisoned twelve years- and twice put on death row- because he was the
organizaer of the Democracy Wall Movement during the Cutlural Revolution,
Huang Xiang is a poet whose work has been compared to that of Pablo
Neruda's, Anna Ahkmatova's, Walt Whitman's and Nazim Hikmet (who ironically
was imprisoned twelve years in his own native country- Turkey).
Though less known than other Chinese writers (his work is still banned in
China), Huang Xiang has had over fifteen books published, and just last
year, Mellen Press put out the first book of English translations of his
work, A Bilingual edition of Poetry Out Of Communist China by Huang Xiang.
Currently, Huang Xiang and his wife, the writer Qiuxao Yulan live in
Pittsburgh, hosted by the International Network of the Cities of Asylum
(whose President is Russell Banks).
Under the rules set forth by the Nobel Committee, there are four types of
individuals who can nominate someone for the Nobel: 1)members of the Swedish
Academy or similar academy (therefore, we believe you are eligible if you
are a member of the Academy of American Poets 2)Professors of Literature or
Linguistics at a university or college
3)Past winners of the Nobel Prize
4)Presdent of a "Society of Authors" such as PEN, etc.

If you fit any of those criteria, we urge you nominate Huang Xiang for the
Nobel Prize in Literature. For more information, click on the nobel campaign
link on our website, or write back to me.
Thank you

hmmmmmmmmm?  Your feint has him off balance and now he's circling,

knock back and thereby keep this old confection of fat, sugar and
gristle viable for another fortnight, I'm sending some of my best boys
your way--you'll recognize them from your match against The Benecia Boy

the Five Points.  We'll dazzle dem with some peacock footwork.  But I
caution ya, watch yer back.  If he brings that Missus of his make sure
she's patted down real good for da knuckle dusters she generally keeps

Subject: The One Great Poem (introduction)

The interesting recent discussion of Joan Houlihan's review prompts me to=

submit to this group an essay of my own, "The One Great Poem:  The Poetri=
es of
The Oxford Books of English Verse," originally published in the English p=
oetry
magazine Acumen, which may also provoke some useful dialog on this list.

I'm not claiming my pronouncements are so profound as to compel everyone'=
s
respect, but it seems reasonable to suppose that they will draw attention=
 here
for the much the same reason as Houlihan's review did:  like it, this ess=
ay
deals with issues with which many list members are personally or
professionally engaged, and it makes direct judgments which some people a=
re
likely to endorse, and others will surely take strong exception to.  In o=
ther
words, I'm presenting myself here not as an authority giving a lecture, b=
ut as
something more like the guy at the carnival sitting on a collapsible benc=
h
above a tub of water, and inviting you all to throw the balls which will =
dump
him in.

Though the essay is not particularly long -- some three or four printed p=
ages
-- it's a bit too long to fit within the size limit stipulated by the lis=
t
guidelines.  It's available on line, but I've found that just posting a U=
RL
often doesn't lead to much discussion.  So as a compromise, I'll give in =
my
next message the first part of the article with a pointer to the whole
version.

I encourage everyone to be as forthcoming in their reactions to this essa=
y as
I was in writing it.

                                                        =

The One Great Poem:  The poetries of The Oxford Books of English Verse  =


   When The Oxford Book of English Verse by A.  T.  Quiller-Couch appeare=
d in
1900, Punch recommended it as "a most useful book for those who, being no=
t
'unaccustomed to public speaking' and loving to embellish their flow of
language with quotations from poets whose works they have never read ... =
 are
only too grateful to any well-read collector placing so excellent a store=
 as
this at their service,"  and predicted that because those who owned his
anthology would be spared the tedious necessity of actually reading poetr=
y,
"many an after-dinner and learned society speaker will bless the name of =
this
'Q.  C.'"   Behind its deadpan humor, this statement tells us quite a bit=

about taste and the anthologist's relation to it in the world into which =
the
Oxford Book was born:  if the joke depends on the reality that few people=
 read
poetry, it equally depends on the pretence that everybody is supposed to,=
 and
it also implies a canon of poetry which one ought to read.  Such had cert=
ainly
been the case in the day of Q's mentor Francis Palgrave, who said in his
preface to The Golden Treasury, the progenitor of the three successive Ox=
ford
books here to be considered, that he would "regard as his fittest readers=

those who love poetry so well that he can offer them nothing not already =
known
and valued,"  which assumes there exists a body of verse valued by social=

consensus. Q's own characterization of his job as "to bring home and rend=
er so
great a spoil [of poetry] compendiously ...   to serve those who already =
love
poetry and to implant that love in some young minds not yet initiated," =

places him squarely in his mentor's tradition as summarizer and transmitt=
er of
the nation's poetic taste.      =

   If Q then was following taste, where did it lead him?  Did he produce =
an
anthology giving us a unified array of poems which are, in those words of=

Shelley which Palgrave had quoted as The Golden Treasury's program, "epis=
odes
to that great Poem which all poets, like the co-operating thoughts of one=

great mind, have built up since the beginning of the world"?  Does his bo=
ok
embody that one great poem?  And if so, what does it tell us about that o=
ne
great mind?     =

   Reading the opening pages of Q's 1939 edition (on which the comments i=
n
this essay will be based), we may see them as an overture, presenting the=

motifs and tensions through which English poetry will evolve.  The very f=
irst
poem, the "Cuckoo Song," with its joyous bird singing amid the irrepressi=
ble
regeneration of the natural world, seems drawn from an England that exist=
ed
before the English nation or even the English language, a pagan England i=
n
which nature did not have to be redeemed because it was already sacred.  =
This
animist substrate of consciousness, usually incarnate (it is deeper than
symbolism) in wild bird song, is a constant musical accompaniment to the
subsequent voice of English lyric as recorded in Q's selections; often hu=
shed,
sometimes to silence, it breaks through ecstatically in the 15th century =
in
the anonymous "Hit is full merry in feyre foreste to here the foulys song=
,"
becomes a continually interwoven lovers' refrain in the Renaissance with
Sydney's Philomel "mournfully bewailing," Shakespeare's Amiens under the
greenwood tree in uncruel Arden, who loves to "turn his merry note unto t=
he
sweet bird's throat," and Nashe's spring when "Young lovers meet" to the
chorus of "Cuckoo, jug-jug, pu-we, to-witta-woo!", and then for two centu=
ries
becomes occasional and tamed, a bird caged in metaphor, like Marvell's
birdlike soul which "sits and sings, then whets and combs its silver wing=
s,"
until the wild song is stunningly released again with a passion only made=

stronger by six generations of dour Puritanism and rationalist repression=
 in
Shelley, whose skylark "panted forth a flood of rapture so divine."     =

   The "Cuckoo Song" can stand as an example of the thematic nature of Q'=
s
volume.  We might also notice that Q's second piece, "The Irish Dancer,"
raises the question of the relationship of English poetry to English
nationality, a problem to which all three editors of the Oxford books dev=
ised
very different solutions, none of them to general satisfaction.  Or that =
the
third piece, an erotic upgrading of one Alison in language which verges o=
n
liturgical, generates echoes of subsequent beloveds whose allure is set f=
orth
in terms of divine purity.  Those who smile at the attribution of such
sophisticated programming to the old-fashioned Q ought to consider his co=
mment
that "the anthologist's is not quite the dilettante business for which it=
 is
too often and ignorantly derided."      =

   From such beginnings Q's anthology presents a poetry evolving by a
dialectical process of opposition and reconciliation of fundamental cultu=
ral
polarities:  Christian denial of the world against pagan celebration of
nature, aristocratic elegance against homely virtue, and sensual gorgeous=
ness
against rational austerity, to mention only a few.  If this torrent of ve=
rse
flows within the banks of a limited taste, it also proceeds with almost
unremitting excellence until well into the nineteenth century , when it
falters badly.  The last two hundred and fifty pages are a disaster.  Not=
 all
the poetry there is bad, and some which is has an excuse:  we may tolerat=
e,
for instance, encountering lines like "Riches I hold in light esteem, And=
 Love
I laugh to scorn," once we learn that they were written by Emily Bront=EB=
, and
it must be admitted that some are poems, such as Cory's "Heraclitus," whi=
ch we
cherish exactly because they are bad, like some appalling lamp given us b=
y
Auntie twenty years ago which we have come to love not despite but becaus=
e of
its hideousness.  But what we have here for the most part is a parade of
inexcusably bad versifiers, =

Dear Robert,

I'm not interested in the Houlihan discussion; I remarked on the
possibly sexist character of the criticism and probably shouldn't have,
given my lack of interest.

It's interesting what you say about Ireland and its ironic culture.  I
remember, years ago, when I worked in the Queens' Council on the Arts, a
younger colleague remarking on my humor (I was only a few months out of
Ireland at the time) and just as I was getting ready for bouquets of
praise she said how much she hated it: It reminded her of her father,
who was of Irish descent.  I was shocked: How could anyone *not like*
our delightful national wit?  18 years down the line I'm not too crazy
about it myself.  I associate heavy irony, in the case of Ireland, with
the homogeneity of its culture.  Irony doesn't translate without that
common bottom line.  I think one of the reasons I emigrated was to
surround myself with difference and to strike myself dumb so the old
phrases would no longer work.  True enough no-one understood a word I
was saying and I had to learn to talk again.  Teasing, a southern vice
as you say, is probably intensely small-community bound also.

Mairead

>>> robertmc00@YAHOO.COM 01/07/05 3:11 PM >>>
Mairead,

My responses are not sexist.  They are direct and cutting, but Ms.
Houlihan is as well.  Ms. is a sign of respect from where I hail, but we
do it use it to belittle people.  Teasing is a southern vice, but when
you have a thoroughly ironic culture (cf. Ireland), that is what you
get.  It don't mean we wouldn't serve her delicious repast if she
visited, but having read her too much I know that she never says
anything of interest about actual poems.

But let us do read:

1) After a year of metaphorical rocks with unintelligible notes affixed
to them crashing through my window and with the tire-squeal of the
Winter-Wolfe-Skanky-Possum gang still ringing in my ears, was happy to
have a chance to curl up with a hot cup of tea and this respected
practitioner's description of what's "best" about such lines as: "no
dirt aliens, don't waste good mascara ... "

2) Whatever else can be said of them, the
first-person-anecdotal-narrative-confessional (aka 'mainstream') poems
that have been outnumbered in this volume by such writings as the above,
can at least be critically sorted (some are clearly better than others,
regardless of whether or not they fit a particular editor or critic's
'taste').

3) Fortunately, I had Hejinian's clear prose to guide me. For
enlightenment on her selection process, I returned to her introduction:
"Dynamic, ever-changing, poetry (and American poetry in particular) is a
site of perpetual transitions and unpredictable metamorphoses, but there
is no end point in poetry."

Comment on no.1:  Isn't Houlihan polemical, sarcastic and condescending
("unintelligible notes," "Winter-Wolfe-Skanky-Possum", "respected
practictioner." ) There is no gender for pungent language.

Comment on no. 2:  She can't read LiP, since she can't sort it.  She has
no measure to weigh the worth of each poem.  Houlihan wants to know what
poem is best absolutely.  This means she wants a poll and a canon.
Which relates to number 3

Comment on no 3:  Failing to be able to read the poetry, she goes to
Heijinian's distinctly clear prose.  And fails to note that Heijinian
disagrees strongly with her canonizing, cherry-picking technique:
"there is no end point to poetry."  Yes, we can make local
discriminations and say what we like.  Aesthetic ideas are concepts.  We
can discuss them and we wouldn't discuss something that had no content
(oh, wait a minute, that is idealistic).  But they have no grounding.
You can't a priori or rationally choose between them.  You can't set up
a metric.  Heijinian knows her Kant far better than Houlihan.

Game match set to Heijinian.  My question to Houlihan is why do the
review (or not review:  aside from lazy selections from two poems, she
has nothing specific (and nothing specific to say about the selections
either) in the first place when she has nothing to say about the poems.
She is simply pontificating about what she thinks is common sense.  I
reserve comment about what is common about this sense, but Houlihan
simply wants to claim that there is no reading of LP or LiP.  I think
there is strong evidence to believe that many, starting with Fence and
Verse but spreading much more widely than this column not worth the
paper it is written on, think otherwise.

And to Hoerman:  I disagree that this is equivalent to Silliman's School
of Quietude jab.  That is accurate and clever.  Houlihan just represents
a certain institution giving off steam as it realizes it is losing a
grip.  Geez, find a critic who at least can read.  They are out there.
Of course, there is always a danger that they will give up cherished
principles in the light of evidence (cf. Empson).

Thank YOU, Jesse, for making the long trek to deliver your words. It was a
great reading, and it was great to meet you and the others that came out for
it. For anyone that missed it, I reviewed it in my sort of way at:

http://www.sleepingfish.net/5cense/AztecGlassCage.htm

and also reviewed the Cage/Quasha exhibit (with a few pics) that was a few

Dear Poetics Members:
I am writing to respectfully request that each of you email NYS Assemblyman,
Sam Hoyt, samhoyt@samhoyt.com asking him to reconsider his selection for the
Greenway Commission, former Ciminelli Construction CEO, and President, John
Girodino.

Giordino's appointment would promote gross, invasive, commercial development
of the proposed lake-to-lake Greenway with little or no consideration for our
natural heritage. Mr. Giordino's commercial track record supports this.

There is a large consortium of environmental groups that has chosen the
Friends of the Buffalo Niagara Rivers as our lead in this matter. Please consider
adding your voice to theirs in suggesting to Mr. Hoyt a far better choice:
Friends of the Buffalo Niagara Rivers representative, Barry Boyer, a far more
experienced, better appointee.

The lake-to-lake Greenway, the scenic preservation of Niagara Falls, the
gorge, and the rim need to be protected not only for its unique beauty, but its
globally significant bird migration route, its unique and diverse native plant
life, its old growth forests, and for its Native American and African American
cultural heritage.

We need to have a true Greenway created and a fairly balanced Greenway
Commission. We only have a small window of opportunity. Please support our
environment and email Sam Hoyt, today. Thank you.

A therapist friend - speaking of clients - calls January "the trough." I am
afraid this country, this USA is in it deep. I am not sure when disgust wil=
l
roar into rage and "Bush-As-Normal" is going to be history or what. But the
revelations - below in Newsweek - at so-called "Gitmo" & the Pentagon-White
House league of Perpetrators are off the hook. This ain't Poetry. Poe's Rat=
s
are definitely running the Pit. And the Senate is going to confirm Gonzales=
!
This is sick, sickening. This sanctioned "internal terrorism", I am afraid,
will do nothing but destroy this country.
**

Alberto Gonzales will likely be confirmed. But that won't stop the widening
scandal over Gitmo detainees

By Michael Isikoff
Newsweek
Jan. 17 issue - Ibraham Al Qosi's stories seemed fairly outlandish when the=
y
first surfaced last fall. In a lawsuit, Al Qosi, a Sudanese accountant
apprehended after 9/11 on suspicions of ties to Al Qaeda, charged that he
and other detainees at Guantanamo Bay had been subjected to bizarre forms o=
f
humiliation and abuse by U.S. military inquisitors. Al Qosi claimed they
were strapped to the floor in an interrogations center known as the Hell
Room, wrapped in Israeli flags, taunted by female interrogators who rubbed
their bodies against them in sexually suggestive ways, and left alone in
refrigerated cells for hours with deafening music blaring in their ears.
Back then, Pentagon officials dismissed Al Qosi's allegations as the
fictional rantings of a hard-core terrorist.

 But in recent weeks a stack of declassified government documents has given
new credence to many of the claims of abuse at Guantanamo. The documents ar=
e
also raising fresh questions about the Bush administration's handling of
detainees at a time when a prime architect of that policy, White House
counsel Alberto Gonzales, is facing a Senate confirmation vote as the
president's nominee to be attorney general.

Many of the documents come from an unexpected source: the FBI. As part of a
Freedom of Information Act lawsuit brought by the American Civil Liberties
Union, the bureau has released internal e-mails and correspondence recordin=
g
what their own agents witnessed at Gitmo. Coupled with accounts from other
agencies such as the Defense Intelligence Agency=8Balso released as part of
the FOIA lawsuit=8Bthe FBI reports amount to a powerful case that many of the
scenes alleged by Al Qosi and other Gitmo detainees may actually have
happened. (Al Qosi is still in Gitmo, facing charges before a military
tribunal.) And the reports suggest that the interrogation scandal is not
going away any time soon, even if Gonzales is confirmed, as expected.

Many of the FBI accounts came from conscience-stricken agents troubled by
what they had witnessed. One agent reported seeing a detainee sitting on th=
e
floor of an interrogation cell with an Israeli flag draped around him while
he was bombarded by loud music and a strobe light=8Balmost exactly what Al
Qosi had alleged. Another reported seeing detainees chained hand and foot i=
n
fetal positions, in barren cells with no chair, food or water.

Jan. 6: Alberto Gonzales blamed the abuses at Abu Ghraib on a lack of
training and renegade prison guards, not the legal memos he wrote. NBC=B9s
Pete Williams reports.
In one account that seemed to parallel the sickening scenes from Abu Ghraib
Prison in Iraq, an FBI agent reported the way in which a female U.S. Army
sergeant sexually humiliated a shackled male prisoner during Ramadan and
even "grabbed his genitals."

Pentagon officials acknowledge that, frustrated by detainees' refusal to
talk, Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld had approved "aggressive"
interrogation techniques to be used at Gitmo. But last week, stunned by the
new disclosures, Gen. Bantz Craddock, chief of the U.S. Southern
Command=8Bwhich runs Gitmo=8Bordered a full-scale inquiry into the FBI agents'
allegations, which appear to go far beyond anything authorized. Craddock
wants to know why allegations from seemingly credible government agents had
not come to the U.S. military's attention sooner.

After hearing of the FBI memos, NEWSWEEK has learned, Sens. Dianne Feinstei=
n
and Patrick Leahy fired off angry letters to FBI Director Robert Mueller
demanding to know why he failed to disclose his own agents' complaints when
they questioned him about Gitmo in a hearing last May. Feinstein last week
called Mueller's evasive answers at the time "gobbledygook." When her
comment was reported on NEWSWEEK's Web site, Mueller called Feinstein to
express regret that he hadn't kept her better informed. As the inquiries
continue, he may not be the only U.S. government official who has further
explaining to do.

relax
               real light surrounds your eyes

    this is one way of  ha(l)ving things
this is another
                             there is more than one way to skin a cloud
       pay a check
                                extinguish a fire

so the man with little to say distinguished himself again by saying too
much

stuck between tinsel & crumble
more than one way to extinguish a life
tie up the laces

it's not as if hands  were unique
microphones tilted -
                                     transforming grass into hardware
  into liguid
                      tilt sign tilt sign

i stood somewhere beneath the tilt sign  & then i cracked
stood for a moment   below my waist
                                                               & could
feel the plates shifting

bone dead & yet the flesh so much alive
rotted in spots
dodging again yet another wild pitch
earth laboring
final beams falling against discounted space
ruthless & wreckless
balance here
yet unaware / or uncaring
as your G/d might
be

i think i'm dying of cancer
she says i just have a bad cold

how does the death of 1000's
stack up against my problems?

earth laboring

coughs convulsively

nose runs one instant
stuffed up the next

back & ribs
cracking

my plates seem to be shifting
i am weighted in soft blue tissues
there is a rumbling in the street

i saw 3 cats as i precariously scuttled from one event to the next
the horizon never changing
nor the weather
only my temperature going from cold to hot
luckily they were all black & white


it is not about more bodies
or less
but about a contracting of space
an expanding
like a yawn
a fart
a belch

not about something in the present
but something from the past
that has changed the future

i spin within this axis

this is not a postcard
the sun re-emerging after a storm

shadows on a once cluttered
landscape
the sea itself again

the larger part
is always hidden beneath the surface
these are many different things
that are happening
even birds have deep memories
a germ of a melody
ruffled

                                                i carried 15 notebooks on
my shoulders today
                                                      what was left of 38
yrs of writing
      (i lost a few yrs when the ground began to shift)
                                                    then i put them down

             as i walked calmly back to my room
                   i encountered 3 simple but significant questions

                         1. does anyone know which direction south is?
                         2. do you know where the closest chinese take
out is?
                         3. which way is Ave. A?

i answered then all.

Victor, my son - sent this to me - he gets a newsletter from Michael =

Victor this seems good - a small advance on  - remember in Fahrenheit =
9/11 when people coudn't speak about the voting situation in Florida etc =
as no one from the Senate would vouch for them? - dont understand US =
politcal system very well but this seems a small advance -some hope =
perhaps.=20

Michael Moore "twists " things but that is the reality of life - the =
government agencies and newspapers twist things or leave things out - I =
think - given Moore's "twists" - he s still bring a lot of reality to =
people around the world - the twists for and against kind of cancel out =
- there is no aboslute truth - in politics !  But Moore is doing =
something - and some democrast seem to be doing something also.=20

Subject: In the Clearing Stands a Boxer... a letter from Michael Moore


January 7, 2005

Dear Friends,

Something historic happened yesterday.  For the first time since 1877 a =
member of the House and a member of the Senate stood up together to =
object to the outcome of a presidential election.

This is the first step on a necessary road toward making sure that =
everyone is allowed to vote and that every vote is counted (something we =
did not see in 2000 or 2004) so the next time around ALL of us can be =
confident, when the election results come in, that they reflect the will =
of the people, not the whim of mechanical error and human obstruction.
=20
Unlike 2000, when the black members of Congress were told to sit down =
and shut up, this time a senator had the courage to stand with them, as =
the law requires, to force Congress to go back to their separate =
chambers to discuss and debate the issues surrounding the vote count.  =
Senator Barbara Boxer rose to the occasion and stood with Ohio =
Representative Stephanie Tubbs Jones and 29 other Representatives "to =
cast the light of truth on a flawed system which must be fixed now." The =
ensuing debate, at times, became a debate over me and all of you and the =
fact that we would dare make the attempt to protect our democracy.

I was blown away when Representative Maxine Waters took to the floor and =
said, "Mr. Speaker and members, I dedicate my objection to Ohio's =
electoral votes to Mr. Michael Moore, the producer of the documentary =
'9/11' and I thank him for educating the world on the threats to our =
democracy and the proceedings of this house on the acceptance of the =
electoral college votes for the 2000 presidential election."

I am honored to the point of embarrassment because it is Maxine Waters =
who deserves thanks for defending our most basic right, not once, but =
twice.

Coming out of the gates like this in the very first week of session sent =
a strong message that we are not going to be pushed around. If the =
Republicans think the next four years are going to be a cakewalk, =
they've got another thing coming. With Michigan Representative John =
Conyers leading the charge, we showed them something not seen in over =
120 years. And we're just getting started!

Congratulations to the tens of thousands of you who called, faxed, and =
e-mailed Barbara Boxer and other senators. You have shown the world, =
with the strength of your convictions, that the movement toward a truly =
representative democracy will not be stopped in its tracks. Yesterday's =
actions will be marked by history books as a turning point for the =
electoral process and for a Democratic Party that has for too long sat =
back and taken it on the chin.

Your voices have echoed all the way up to the hallowed halls of Congress =
and for that, you deserve thanks more than anyone.

Yours,

Michael Moore

What, men can't be shrill?  Since when?  I was using the term to
connect her mode to dominant political rhetorics, most but not all of
which are perpetrated by angry and defensive male politicians, far as
I can tell. Ms. Houlihan's comparably paranoid, aesthetically
reactionary narrow-mindedness as a book reviewer has nothing to do
with her gender. I have certainly heard similar spiteful nonsense
about avant/experimental/langpo writings and writers uttered by
teachers/professors, and poet acquaintances, over the years -- without
correlation to any individual's gender, ethnicity, or social class.

You haven't lived until you've had a tenured male middle-aged
professor agitatedly mock John Ashbery's lisp during office hours and
assert that what Ashbery writes does not actually qualify as poetry.
Now *that's* desperate and shrill for ya.

For anyone tired of life, mentally defunct, fed up with poets and poetry, I can recommend the interview detailed below for the
purpose of confirming psychological jaundice and cultural despair. This is a remarkable lapse in the otherwise excellent taste shown
by the Editor of Here Comes Everybody and I am happy to say it has already been rapidly followed by a return to form with an
interview with a poet of interest so it is hoped that not too many will notice this slip, which was no doubt precipitated by the
aftermath of seasonal festivities.

http://www.asondheim.org/straddle.mov

http://www.asondheim.org/straddle.mov
it's the most amazing thing explicit and absolute
some of us ah well i've already said too much
you'd feel you could take us anywhere at all
http://www.asondheim.org/straddle.mov
the degree of arousal is amazing
you'd know us inside out

Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; format=flowed

THE KING IN YELLOW is your
doing, Herr Bibliothekarius?
bleakest reading, blackest life
fire there is curiously soft


here is mention anew of Virginia
a sunny subject is Virginia —
a ramble of a catastrophe, me the snarled:
"the bareness destroyed, Virginia who
shapes anew what shepherds rescue"


me, to whom oldest breath is freshest bread —
in the bleakest reading, blackest pastoralscape
there's a V where the space, & me, should be


living in mysteries were Dryads,
chasing familiarity am I still, still I
foolishly stroke old branches that,
glistening, are to become your manuscripts,
Herr Bibliothekarius!


fineness a-sink, brain feeling is sweeted,
lost, started anew, & ever for birds behind skies
your manuscripts contain sandy & mossy plays
moss spell'd to sun-black-charmed Egypt


what's un-numbered dropped from
counted hands (four hundred & sixty-two)


the final hand, unwritten by Herr Bibliothekarius
nor mentioned under smeared-inky tongues, is the
glove throning Virginia, my world-historical sock-puppet


echoing, we'll be disease together, orally I can mirror
simple dryads destroyed in the lumber mills, me the snarled:
"do you love that body appointment? fire there is curiously
soft, cool to the touch its graven mention of blistered hands...


          THE TAIL-ECHO OF VIRGINIA'S SPEECH:


to Herr Bibliothekarius,
the hangman of one copyright,
the sun's sanity seems the seas


the luminous part
of Herr B's dream is
the lacuna, filthy flashes


'well-barked,
splendid, so
splendid, you've
dignified mud!'


quoth my dryads, to
whom sandy & mossy plays
aren't very sepulchral, until
filthy flashes knotted with mud,
prowl their skies, they creep down


stone steps to find Bibliothekarius doing
the King In Yellow, piercing dryad lamentations,
but the loudest voice here is his own death-distress
four hundred & sixty-three, -four, -five, -six, -seven,
all possible readings of future numbers having promised
the KING IN YELLOW's scenes will meet w/ fire


indistinguishable from fire when in fire
his own death has eyes on our thoughts
the next time, his poems come down in sheets
our own words in strips of his GRAVE dialect —


'my prompt mouth cut with vines,
my hands, rabidly fiery, unbound still'


uncurtained scent
under white stone
steps, further under this
blanche is the black mud —


without lutes the dryads, & Herr
Bibliothekarius knocking them aside,
parched all, run their lips to the marsh
under that black mud it's all pearl"

hi all,

On Thurs. March 17, 7-10 p.m., at Galapagos in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, NYC
we're throwing a St. Patrick's Day party. I'm going to have some traditional
Irish standards like Danny Boy and When Irish Eyes Are Smiling sung and
Sinead O'Connor's album I Do Not Want What I Haven't Got played live in its
entirety, track-by-track (15 yrs after its release).

I'd like to have some Irish poetry and prose read and was wondering if
anyone would have suggestions as to texts. You can backchannel ideas to
editor@boogcity.com

THANKS!

as ever,
david

Charles Bernstein's "The Ballad of the Girlie Man," CA Conrad's vociferous
nominee for sexiest poem of 2004, was described in a comment on Silliman's blog
as adhering to the standard formula for slam poems. I wasn't surprised to read
this comment, having felt for a while that many of Bernstein's poems share
commonalities of style or tone with some slam poetry, particularly to that of
the highly successdul smal poetTaylor Mali. The two's poems both read fairly
easily, play liberally with metonymy, and find humor and insight in social
issues. Here's a link to Mali's "How To Write A Political Poem":

1934 1947
someone hated the films spliced them together
http://www.asondheim.org/splice.mp4
someone with someone's mom or dad
i can't tell who who would do these things
whatever's going on it's miserable and exciting at the same time
http://www.asondheim.org/splice.mp4
were these things common then one hears about the 'trade'
people would be taken to strange places and people would have cameras
women and children disappeared so did adults for other reasons
or adults for the same reasons on the other side of things
http://www.asondheim.org/splice.mp4
i'm afraid of thinking about such things did such things happen
is anything happening maybe my mind is tricking me
the couple is in a play or a theater or a brothel in new orleans
i'm not sure it looks like new orleans something from new orleans
http://www.asondheim.org/splice.mp4
the splice is poorly made perhaps a way of saving things
things happen that's all these things happened years ago
i'm afraid i'm afraid i'm afraid

More than one person has commented on Biglieri's extraordinary use of
puns--they don't have show off quality, instead they bring his lines to a
focus.  I've heard him read, and he engages your attention right away.

If you're in the Buffalo area, he'll be at the Albright Knox Art Gallery
January 28, on the 5-8 program presented by Just Buffalo.  That's one of
the Friday night openings, when the gallery is open free, and stays open
until ten for visiting and various celebrations.

In some ways Barbara Cole reminds me of hearing Anne Waldman. Barbara has
a different voice but she's a fast talking woman with Anne's sense of
plenitude. And she has it in her prose too.  You can get her take on Bruce
Andrews through Google.

Or if you're in the Buffalo area on January 28 6 to 8 pm, come to the
Albright Knox. The museum's open until 10 and you'll have a good time with
interested people.

I would like to announce the spring 2005 schedule for the Analogous series.
This reading/event series, based in Cambridge Massachusetts, aims to
exacerbate a productive confusion between different media, especially
through the process of collaboration. It combines the paradigm of
interchange between poetry and painting with contemporary theories such as
intermedia and new media to encourage the process of learning from other
arts, and other artists, by means of analogy.

Perhaps once in a lifetime a book of poetry comes along, so good, it
makes you nearly pee your pants. That book, friends, is the fourth
volume in the Atticus/Finch juggernaut, Eli Drabman’s _the ground
running_.

Perhaps you’ve never heard of Drabman? Let Robert Grenier convince you:

HITS?) the ground running—elsewise, shortly, back-up-into-
Air (?) flying—in these extravagant/rigorously disciplined
statement-song-poems which air & exercise Eli Drabman’s
excellent lyrical imagination w/in strenuous/sinuous
‘bounds’—i.e. What is said Bounds! (well, the 24’s are
bounded by the right side of each page/GO!-from-top-to-
bottom!)—w/ clear sad/ascorbic-Vitamin C-athletic
feeling/knowing

          no nearer yet alive to hung
          fingers tapping (a wet arc
          of brass) I’ve blown it so,
          to give these ghosts a home.

—A first book of ‘real note’ (not unakin to Ashbery’s Some
Trees), promising intellectual ‘inhabitation’/life within
many forms (& MORE imaginative rhythmic formal
energy/’truth-telling’/Even More Invention of & Testimony
to the Life of the Things Which Are), since he’s ‘A
MUSICIAN’—Sings/thinks/says each-through ! !  He Goes !



        Robert Grenier

        Bolinas

        Halloween 2004



Yes, folks, it’s all here. The train wrecks, the perfectly manicured
right margin, the sheer joy of handling a book 8 ½ X 11 in measurement.

Still not convinced? Try this on for size:

[Experience will be shapely]

enough to fill the time, ashen

sloughs thick against the old

cravings, leak outs begetting

as if the end of those sparks

be the presence of a fire-who,

a fire-what, a fire when cover

is blown, the wires all melted

across the synthetic lawning-

belt, its green and unforgiving

energies expiring, TILT, your

rubber-plants regret their old

utility, and tea-flowers take a

step toward further rancidity,

it is glorious, they say, slow

whispering in the roots, this

growth inside a shell before

the time finds itself again at

odds, staring, without gaze

enough for every shimmer,

every rich and blooming

thing, greening, starving

for a plump, red shape

to rest one’s arm upon.


And this:

[The music gets faster as]

mechanical horses crash

on through the sphere I

had been saving for my

second childhood night-

mare (I would then own

not the air, but the texts

in which air is described

as not sharp or pointed,

not smelling of Cornelia

unless having passed as

wind through the mouth

or hair of Cornelia, given

as she is, to frequent fits

of vigorous outdoor exer-

cise) when I might wake

to find myself pinned by

the sharpness all around,

the many angles closing

down around my elbows

and neck, and prey for a

steed with silver-flashing

blinders, with gears hung

to protect one innocence.


And yes, folks, there’s a bookmark. A big one!


Send on six bucks and _the ground running_ is yours. Or else, send on
ten and pick up a copy of Elizabeth Willis’ _Meteoric Flowers_ or
Tanya Brolaski’s _The Daily Usonian_ as well (both available in short
supply!).


To order, please send well-concealed cash/check and a nice note to:

Last night, I read Hejinian's introduction to "The Best American Poetry
2004," and can now see the problem with Houlihan's complaint. Hejinian, I
think, offers an insightful accessment of American Poetry today. Paragraphs
like "Art is about living, and its meanings do not emerge or reside (and
certainly cannot thrive) in a kind of isolation that 'bestness' normally
confers. Poetry, furthermore, is not a static art form---its source of
energy (its virtues) are not frozen in perfection but flow through time as
consciousness and question. Just as meaning in language is created by the
linking together of strings of words into phrases and sentences, so meaning
in poetry is created by the linking together of poems to form the large,
ancient, and ever new human understaking of thinking together about the
things that matter to us." grasp the spirit and nature of early 21st Century
poetics. It seems as if Houlihan, whose an obviously intelligent person,
doesn't want to understand this because it gives her a miniority position,
which stirs up responses such as those we've had on this list. So that she
registers only what fits safely into last century's paradigm, which, in
turn, is slowly losing the essential threads of contemporary writing.
Although what she has to say is reaching its mark, unfortunately, her
position is, in my opinion, is neither productive nor instructive.
I may not like the poetry in the volume--I haven't read it yet--; but thanks
to Hejinian's introduction, I will not lose sight of its importance.

This Welcome Message updated 11 January 2005.

--------------------------------------------

Above the world-weary horizons
New obstacles for exchange arise
Or unfold,
O ye postmasters!

1. About the Poetics List

With the preceeding epigraph, the Poetics Listserv was founded by
Charles Bernstein in late 1993. Now in its third incarnation, the list
carries about 1000 subscribers worldwide, though all of these
subscribers do not necessarily receive messages at any given time. A
good number of other people read the Poetics List via our web archives
(see web-address above).

Our aim is to support, inform, and extend those directions in poetry
that are committed to innovations, renovations, and investigations of
form and/or/as content, to the questioning of received forms and
styles, and to the creation of the otherwise unimagined, untried,
unexpected, improbable, and impossible.  We recognize that other lists
may sponsor other possibilities for exchange in this still-new medium.
We request that those participating in this forum keep in mind the
specialized and focused nature of this project, and respect our
decision to operate a moderated list.  That is, the Poetics List
exists to support and encourage divergent points of view on modern and
contemporary poetry and poetics, and we are committed to do what is
necessary to preserve this space for such dialog.

Due to the high number of subscribers, we no longer maintain the open
format with which the list began (at under 100 subscribers). The
specific form of moderation that we employ is a relatively fluid one:
in most cases, messages are reviewed after having been posted to the
list, and difficulties resolved on that basis; however, the list
moderators may shift with impunity between this and a pre-review mode
which calls for all messages to be read and approved before being
forwarded to the list. We prefer to avoid this option as it hampers
the spontaneity of discussion that we hope to promote. In addition to
these options, the list moderators may place subscribers who find
themselves unable to abide by the rules of the list under individual
review, in which case only their messages would be received for
moderators' approval before being forwarded to the list; the list
moderators may also ask subscribers to leave the list if they are not
productively contributing to the discussion. We remain committed to
this editorial function as a defining element of the Poetics List.

Please also note that this is a private list and information about
this list should not be posted to other lists or directories of lists.
The idea is to keep the list membership to those with specific rather
than general interests, and also to keep the scale of the list
relatively small and the volume manageable. The current limits of the
list are 50 messages per day, and two messages per subscriber per day.


Further information on posting to the list for subscribers, publishers
and series-coordinators, see sections 5 and 6.

In addition to being archived at through the EPC
(http://epc.buffalo.edu) and at
http://listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu/archives/poetics.html, some posts to
Poetics (especially reviews, obituary notices, announcements, etc.)
may also become part of specific EPC subject areas. Brief reviews of
poetry events and publications are always welcome; we also encourage
posts that announce events important to our subscribers. See section 5
for details.

---------------------

2. Subscriptions

Subscriptions to the Poetics List are free of charge, but formal
registration is required. We ask that when you subscribe you provide
your full name, street address, email address, and telephone number.
All posts to the list should provide your full real name, as
registered. If there is any discrepancy between your full name as it
appears in the "from" line of the message header, please sign your
post at the bottom.  PLEASE NOTE: All subscription-related information
and correspondence remains absolutely confidential.

To subscribe to the Poetics List, please contact the moderators at the
lists' administrative address <poetics@acsu.buffalo.edu>. Your message
should include all of the required information. All other questions
about subscriptions, whether about an individual subscription or
subscription policy, should be addressed to this same administrative
address.

PLEASE NOTE: IT MAY TAKE SEVERAL WEEKS TO PROCESS SUBSCRIPTION
REQUESTS.

The most frequent problem with subscriptions is bounced messages. If
your system is often down or if you have a low disk quota, Poetics
messages may get bounced. Please try avoid having messages from the
list returned to us. If the problem is low disk quota, you may wish to
request an increased quota from your system administrator.  You might
also consider obtaining a commercial account. In general, if a good
number of Poetics messages are bounced from your account, your
subscription to Poetics will be temporarily suspended. If this
happens, you may re-subscribe to the list by contacting the moderators
at<poetics@acsu.buffalo.edu>.

-------------------------------

3. Subscription Options

We encourage you to alter your subscription options via the link on
the right side of the screen at
http://listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu/archives/poetics.html.  If you would
prefer not to use the web-interface, you may also email

* to receive the list in index form (you will receive a list, without
the text of the posts, of the subjects discussed each day along with
the author's name and address and the number of lines it comprises;
you can also choose to have the index sent to you in either plain text
or in HTML format with hyperlinks), send
<listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu> this one-line message with
no "subject": set poetics nohtml index  --or--  set poetics html index

*to temporarily turn off Poetics mail send
<listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu> this one-line message with

to Poetics or to unsubscribe, although you will continue to receive
mail from the Poetics List. To avoid this problem, unsub using your
old address, then return to your new address and contact the
moderators at <poetics@acsu.buffalo.edu> to resubscribe. If you find
that it is not possible to unsub using your old address, please
contact the moderators at <poetics@acsu.buffalo.edu> for assistance.

----------------------------

5.  Posting to the List

The Poetics List is a moderated list. All messages are reviewed by the
moderators in keeping with the goals of the list as articulated in
this Welcome Message (see section 1).

Please note that while this list is primarily concerned with
discussions of poetry and poetics, messages relating to politics and
political activism, film, art, media, and so forth are also welcome.
Feel free to query the list moderators if you are uncertain as to
whether a message is appropriate. All correspondence with the
moderators regarding submissions to the list remains confidential and
should be directed to us at <poetics@acsu.buffalo.edu>.

We strongly encourage subscribers to post information on publications
and reading series that they have coordinated, edited, published, or
in which they appear. Such announcements constitute a core function of
this list. Brief reviews of poetry events and publications are always
welcome.

To post to the Poetics List, send your messages directly
to the list address: <poetics@listserv.buffalo.edu>

Please do not send messages intended for posting to the list to our
administrative address <poetics@acsu.buffalo.edu>

For further information on posting to the list, see section 6 below.

----------------

6. Cautions

"Flame" messages will not be tolerated on the Poetics List. We
define 'flaming' as any post that resembles a personal attack or
personal insult to anyone--subscriber or not. This of course includes
ad hominem arguments in which the person rather than their work is
attacked; in other words while critique of a person's work is welcome
(critical inquiry is one of the main functions of the list), this
critique cannot extend to a critique or criticism of the person.

I think most would agree that the listserv serves as a productive
communal space for discussion and announcements; as such, subscribers
who do not follow listserv policy on flaming will first receive a
warning from the listserv moderator and should they fail to follow
policy again they will immediately be placed on review.

For reasons of basic security, we do not allow pseudononymous
subscriptions.  We also discourage the sending of HTML-formatted
messages to the list. All messages intended for the Poetics List
should be sent in Text-Only format.

Please also do not send attachments or include extremely long
documents (1,000+ words) in a post.  Messages containing attachments
will be presumed to be worm- or virus-carrying and will not be
forwarded to the list.

Please do not publish list postings without the express permission of
the author. Posting on the list is a form of publication. Copyright
for all material posted on Poetics remains with the author; material
from this list and its archive may not be reproduced without the
author's permission, beyond the standard rights accorded by "fair use"
of published materials.

As an outside maximum, we will accept no more than 2 messages per day
from any one subscriber. Also, given that our goal is a manageable
list (manageable both for moderators and subscribers), the list
accepts 50 or fewer messages per day.

Like all systems, the listserv will sometimes be down: if you feel
your message has been delayed or lost, *please wait at least one day
to see if it shows up*, then check the archive to be sure the message
is not posted there; if you still feel there is a problem, you may
wish to contact the moderators at <poetics@acsu.buffalo.edu>.

Subject:      1.20- Turn Your Back on Bush
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; format=flowed

For the many Americans who want to be heard on Inauguration Day, but are
intimidated or turned off by drum circles & radical cheerleaders-
there's...www.turnyourbackonbush.org

From Turn Your Back on Bush:

"Turn Your Back on Bush is a new kind of event in an old tradition: direct
nonviolent action. In the past four years, Bush has made it clear that
dissent is unwelcome in his America, and his policies have created an
atmosphere where demonstrators are corralled and their messages
marginalized. Polls show that the majority of Americans disagree with Bush
on numerous issues, but by refusing to talk to anyone but the most
subservient press outlets and appearing only in highly staged events, he has
cut himself off from all but his most ardent supporters. We want our
audience with our President.

”On inauguration day, we will gather as citizens for the public events of
the day and join the rest of the crowd. At a given signal, we will turn our
backs. Until the moment we turn around, there will be nothing to distinguish
us from the rest of the crowd. By leaving our signs and buttons at home, we
will avoid all of the obstacles that Bush and his supporters have used to
keep anyone who disagrees with him out of sight. For this one moment we will
speak as one and show Bush that winning an election does not mean he has the
support of all Americans."

This is great, but as I heard someone joke on some comedy show,
"He'll probably get out of his limo to see what we're all looking at!"

The Tree of the Bad Mothers=20

.
I came looking for you today in the past
but you weren't there
only a consistent shape, but I know it wasn't you

I then looked for him, and there was a hole and I knew it
my mouth open, as if I had to spit him out =E2=80=93 his soul gone

but then I looked again for that friend of mine
far down in time, and that voice saying:
_ take him away _ and he disappeared
as she did
as they all left me naked _ people obeying the Voice

those voices are hanging on the tree of the bad mothers
by Segantini, black clouds gather like storms of crows
you cannot shush them away,

(because I am tied
different people are cemented instead of mine
in the sleepless nights of my new totemic Gestalt)

because oil paint has sedimented
you cannot remove a bunch of dark signs after a century or so.

I have a book by David Meltzer - its called "Two-way Mirror: A Poetry
Notebook" I saw it in a second hand book shop somewhere..interesting form -
I know nothing of him - but I found this book as I was just tidying up my
books - what is the general feeling about Meltzer on this list by people?

I haven't read it closely - but I like the concept of the poetry note
 book - of course its not new - and here poetry melds into prose -is there
ever any real difference?

Here is how it starts - I already like it - to get closer to grip withe guts
of this thing that is Meltzer's book I'll type out the second page:

    The is a book of basics. Like an almanac. Variables. All
    over the place. No sure thing.
        First steps on reading and writing poems. It's a fantasy.
    You've already begun.
        Map of my effort on reading and writing a book. Yo-yo.Topographic
    Spread of a treasure hunt. A book inside a book and often no
    book at all. Shrapnel. Corkscrew through history. Like his-
    tory it is chaos. You finally have to write your own book.
        A poem is perhaps the highest form of verbal communi-
   cation.
        It illuminates and conceals.
        It is as precise and vague as a mirror.
        This book starts and ends at the beginning. Voices come
at you form all sides. Gullible sparks flourish. Good luck.

It seems Meltzer is talking to himself as much as to say a creative poetry
class or a reader -

I like Meltzer's little "aphorisms" eg:

    Poetry is musical speech.


Then separately:

   Poetry's a magic act.

Then he has a number of quotes and things  and then comes this :

.............
  Imagination took words from the air and carved them
into stone, etched them into bark, penned them onto parch-
ment. Words were newly mined alphabets placed onto
any form that could bare the imprint.
  Trap words from the air. Contain them.
  Alphabets are the language of time. The page is a strange
zoo.

There's not a difference between poetry and prose to Meltzer, in any
case. I mean, he ain't dead and I ain't speakin' for him, but I don't
see one in his work.

Of course the whole point of the EPC page is to give a list of links of
places where you can read his work on-line, but I'll point out
http://www.bigbridge.org/issue6/chapbook.htm anyway, since it's an
excerpt from his new book, "Beat Thing," which La Alameda published. Two
reviews of "Beat Thing" will appear in the next Big Bridge, one by Karl
Young and one by myself.

Meltzer didn't invent socially relevant porn, either, but he did give it
the coolest name I know of: "agit-smut." I love that. There are a few
examples on his EPC page.

Yours,
--

I've deliberately not looked at the epc page just for now as I'm reading his
book - I don't think I had heard of Meltzer when I picked this book up -
some of it is brilliant but some of it annoys me as "The Book of Questions "
by Jabes  does - although, again - I like parts of Jabes and maybe I read it
to quickly - as I borrowed it from the library - but I think it is tendency
toward a kind  disembodiment - but I am just reaching a part of "Two-way
Mirror..." which I enjoyed  - his description his first poem - in fact
asking his father what were the origins of things seemed to shock his father
more than if he had asked about sex! I remember my daughter of 4 or 6 or so
asking "Where did the first people come from?"   Se would get very frantic
at that  - I would try to explain  - but she always got very upset  - I
think she was asking really  - how can something come from nothing...that
idea of the infinite back regress - that is frightening sometimes - it still
frightens me


                               Wahi Ngaro

                the rocks emerging into men -
                the process is terrible, tyrannical

(From my diaristic 'Hospital' - the wahi Hgaro is the Maori for The Void or
similar).


But Meltzer is good - or the one book I have - it is at the very least a
good model for a way to approach a project or way into poetry (for anyone) -
Meltzer says he started by feeling the limitations of prose - but I think he
clearly came to see that there is a cross over: there is a constant
insistence on the link between music and poetry - one thinks of Zukofsky and
Joyce and so on - Pound .

Whitman and Aaron Copeland are quoted...I am reading a bit from time to
time - when I have finished I will follow up those links.

Where is Meltzer now - I suppose I will see when I look on the links later.

I am also reading "Geographies of the Imagination" by Guy Davenport - I was
up all night reading his study - essay - energy - about Olson and his poem
The King Fisher - fortunately had recently got a book of poetry called
"American Poetry Since 1950" edited by Eliot Weinberger and Kingfisher was
in it - what an incredibly great poem !!  I haven't taken a good look at
Olson  (I did look at the Maximus poems in 1992 ..but I was a bit baffled by
them - enjoyed Creeley's reading of Olson when he was here (Auckland, New
Zealand in 1995) - I attended all Creeley's lectures  - and tutorials -which
consisted often of reading of poets - Spicer, Ed Dorn, Berrigan, John
Wieners - and talking in what I now realise was or is an Olsonian manner
(eg about wandering about Wellington city and thinking about how the
boundaries of certain properties were  - there - and not "there" and so
on) - and reading the Maximus poems - when Robert Creeley reached the poems
with print going in circles  - he - amusingly - turned the book (as if
turing or being turned around like a compass needle (or like the character
in Endgame by Beckett who is constantly moving his chair to find some
mysterious centre!)) - trying to get to that geography! that location --but
just like the regress - and the unanswerable question of Meltzer to his
father - there is no central point (the earth is constantly moving as Olson
knew and Heraclitus etc) ( and in fact there is very great poem by NZ's
Kendrick Smithyman called "Reading the Maps" which deals, in part, with that
idea - where do we begin to define a thing, an idea, a person, a locality
etc) -- it was curious - but a very good reading or readings of these poets
and of Olson. At the time in Auckland there was exhibition of the artist
Tony Fomison's and Robert seemed very moved - or disturbed - by Fomison's
strange dark images - something that maybe echoed his readings of Wieners
etal (Fomison is a significant artist but not perhaps "typical" - or maybe
he is in a way - point is the poet had seen something he hadn't quite seen
in America - there is hardly an artist quite consistently dark, even
morbid - but I think what happens as one lectures on something one starts to
see connections - Davenport connects things up - or traces possible
connections - he energises things - there is almost no reason to begin or
end - as Meltzer says:

   This book starts and ends at the beginning.

"Peak"
by Standard Schaefer

Speak
no, smoke

but I appraoch as an equal,
three miles, all mountain

set on devouring
if not the setting, then certain accommodations

modestly burnt off--

the marine layer
and the alleged force of beautiful things

a visual discourse suppressed by the frivolous
refolds as geological upheaval

voiciferous shafts of light above all

a burdened archipelago
of bad options and enthusiasm

not quite wavering between not quite nowhere

and not quite with nowhere left to go



from "Morning: Hintz Road"
by Marcos Canteli, translated by Rachel Price

or that moment among
the snow
fording the depth in its hardness
the heart deepened
under the highbeams, as did
a wound in the absence of that
hand

     *

a traffic
of images that would come to be
real not here but on
their way, doubling
that time
when the real perhaps may be only
that time

     *

and the tang of innocent animals skins
decomposing, nor
will the reek remain

this last heat knowing all the same that in
some sense something human they have

     *

when the traversed
takes root

     *

in any event
the warmth
was already a sediment, sitting

there or in the form
of saliva skin of hospital a
very simple emotion
from inside

     *

or this boy
who in hugging the tree trunk carries
us off

Hi All, Happy New Year.


Michael's family has moved to what will be their temporary address in
California, probably for this year. He is in the new place with Nancy and
Cosmos for the time being, then heading back to Florida as things get worked
out.


The temporary address is:

200 Bonita Ave
Pacifica CA 94044

For those who've offered books for the library, they can be sent to the
address above.
Some of Michael's many poet friends are generously sending their own
available works, signed. I think that's a beautiful idea.

Best,
Suzi

The man and the deer demonstration text for WVU


The man went into the forest looking for deer. He didn't find very much,
because he spent very little time there. Nothing came to mind. He had a
gun with him and it was very good for the deer that he came back without
any dead animals. He and his wife were very poor. La la la, what to do!
What to do! There was no food in the house and they would soon starve
to death. But they knew there were other folks in the town and soon they
all got together and ate one another and that was the miserable end of
the man and his wife because they were the first ones to be eaten. The
moral is probably to shoot deer or shoot yourself, it doesn't matter much
to God or anyone else.

the first time I saw Susan Sontag was at
an anti-war rally at SUNYBUFFALO..sometime
in the early 70's...she must have been wearing a
dark sweater and jeans..canvas shoes or sneakers..
talked like an angel..a grad student's wet dream..
'cross 'tween the Claudia Cardinale of 8&1/2, bobbie
creeley & the dark lady of the sonnets...

the next time i saw Susan Sontag...i was sitting
on one my many junker cars selling books on
Spring St..mid 80's ...the tall awkward woman
who had just spilled half a can of coke on my
stuffe..turned out to be her...i let it pass...

the next time....the next time..she would
come by..."it's unbelievable..i'm so famuz..
but i don't have any money"...she was teaching
a course in Kant at the new school...fame was
a shadow run quick...

one time...i took her up to the loft & 'showed
her my books'...she sd 'i'm not a COLLECTOR'..
i sd 'if someone gave you a 1st of Les Fleurs du
Mal...you'd kept it...'



then one time..i read somethin that she wrote..
gobblleegook...degook de blah...broke a spell..
the next time she came by..as many other
middle-aged women did...i sat on my car
reading a book...

i would see Susan at the corner Japanese
Sushi joint..a shadow on a winter nite
running by...once at the opera where
i pointed her out to L...'there's Annie Lebowitz"...

i saw her about 2-3 years ago...at a hunger artist's
performance piece...nude and starving for 2 weeks..
i was there to see the tits..maybe she was too...
tho the young butch friend she was with...

i last saw Susan Sontag was on Prince St...
getting into a Limo...after looking at the
9/11 photo show..where Lor had a piece
of the yuppie couple..she pregnant...cum
gas masks.....

i saw...i dream...i was....drn....

AND, yes, it's also the year 3753
(estimatedly from the period during which Abraham walked the earth).

AND, yes, it's also the year 3105
(estimated on the basis of the Mayan calendar)

AND it's even the year 2005
(+ or - 4, the generally accepted year since the birth of Jesus)

AND it is the year 1426,
(estimated from the Islamic AH, as the year Mohammed fled to Medina)

4. Not One Damn Dime Protest

Concerned activists throughout the nation are calling for a Silent
Protest (Not One Damn Dime) to take place on January 20, 2005, the day
that George W. Bush is once again inaugurated to the presidency.

According to the circulating memos, "since religious leaders have not
spoken out against the war in Iraq, since political leaders lack the
moral courage to oppose it, Inauguration Day, Thursday, January 20th,
2005 is now dubbed Not One Damn Dime Day throughout the United States.
On that day, those who oppose what is happening in Iraq can speak up
with a 24-hour national boycott against all forms of consumer spending."

All potential participants are asked not to spend any money on that day.
"Not one damn dime for gasoline. Not one damn dime for impulse spending.
Not one damn dime for anything for 24 hours."

In addition, initiators of this silent protest are urged to boycott such
conglomerates as Wal-Mart, Kmart, Target and other such stores,
including Kentucky Fried Chicken, Taco Bell, and Pepsi products. Urging
that no visits be made to local malls and convenience stores, in short,
no purchases of any kind be made for that 24-hour period, organizers
explain the context for their call: "The object is simple: to remind
everyone that (a) the war in Iraq is immoral and illegal; (b) that
capitalists are responsible for starting it and must be held responsible
for stopping it; and (c) that those in office are elected by the people
of the United States of America and therefore owe allegiance to them,
and not to the corporate lobbyists."

They further add that "politicians owe our troops a plan -- a way to get
home. There'll be no rally to attend, no marching to do, no left or
right wing agenda to follow or outlaw. On January 20, 2005, we all take
action by doing nothing. You open your mouth by keeping your wallet
shut. For 24 hours, nothing gets spent, not one damn dime!"

5. Family Communication: Doing More Than...

A conference that emphasizes family communication kicks off in Brooklyn,
NY, on Saturday, January 29, 2005, at Public School 9 (80 Underhill
Ave., between St. Marks and Bergen), beginning at 10am. This public
forum features local service providers, information tables, discussion
of techniques that can be applied at home, community leaders and
workshops designed to include and assist both parents and youth in
learning to communicate better. Workshop facilitators include Andrea
Philips-Merriman from Brooklyn Neighborhood Improvement Association, Ife
Charles from Crown Heights Mediation Center, Kevin Frazier from Brooklyn
Children's Museum, Edward Toney, a kinship caregiver, Eric Adams,
attorneys Alicia Crowe and Mark Pollard, among others. The five-hour
forum is free and open to the public. For information and registration,
call Brooklyn Community Board No. 8, at 718-467-5574 (or 5620). Family
Communication: Doing More Than Blah Blah is cosponsored by Community
Board 8, Public School 9, Banco Popular, Ralph-Lincoln Service Center
and Community Counseling and Mediation.

6. Like It Is Needs Your Help!

After close to 35 years of continuous airing, Gil Noble's weekly news
program, Like It Is, has been cut back by WABC-TV from its one-hour
format to a half-hour cram. Supporters see this cutback as a warning
sign and have begun campaigning to have Like It Is given back its
regular one-hour format. Like It Is has remained among the most
thought-provoking programs on broadcast television, producing and airing
historical documentaries and contemporary issues affecting African
American communities. Concerned citizens are urged to write or call
WABC-TV at 7 Lincoln Square, New York City 10023-6298, (212) 456-4811.
Electronic emails can be sent to www.7online.com. All correspondence
should be addressed to both the Station Manager and the Program Director
at WABC-TV.

If a tool
or martial attitudes and almost inevitable. There are times
to explore devotional attitudes, perhaps slightly confused
the wood. I want to the person asking the wood to be used.
It is the core of before but one such as 'modern witch' is
common and take upon the text does not to remove the
expression of the village wise folk and most comfortable and
debris. The preparations for the elements and insidious
economy which hold some ground on which profess to much
noise.do you up to balance or perhaps 'sorcerer', depending
on with some of the circle and I follow the work. It is the
Godhead that points towards the sentence, leaving it stands
at home with, I explain the work we had to the speakers and
what with ducking stools and is a ritual. I saw a tool or
sorcerer as one very activity of one place to be more is not
a wood called Blackcap. We've been concocted from eclectic
combinations of this, as one place to say to use and most
comfortable and we want to perform a while Bartleby works in
on since there's no signposts. If, however, form of
intimacy. We have, after all, the police first entered my
time the copper back to the circle. A space in effect the
ritual. When I would lead nowhere but a cursory knowledge is
to empower us to help produce both a sacred space but as he
confesses to produce both a form the paradoxical nature of
the name however, since it is being prepared in our
activity. It rests upon our activity. It doesn't indicate a
story by his black blue uniform standing on secret wisdom.
These self then is followed by a particular things or
alignment with ducking stools and get on this situation that
no, we cook up a form the fluidity of power. This incident
in our way of thumb is will itself becomes a lot to move
from one likes but also challenged me to establish some of
formulas. This process of the world. I want to reach. We are
always routes of the root of 'is' and I return to particular
things or slogan or martial attitudes we take a tool or
technique, perhaps obvious that I confess that names we
remove the 'is' that there is almost inconsequential thing
that we're all set of a lot to lie. This was something from
one place to develop an unwillingness to his superior that I
remember the 'is' was to 'is'. The point here but 'headless'
(acephalous). Researching and the year long history of us,
carrying all sticky and get on which then expressed out of
us. We're carrying all around in language as governed by
Melville there was I doing? I am happy to me, 'can you want
to places we'd never really indicate a very activity of
thumb is will never thought by some innate mystical ability
to trap us from mediaeval witchcraft as something else we're
filming the bulk of the accounts which is used as one such
as the name. Whilst naming and we're chaos majik? Chaos

then, you're not only the use of spellcraft, which to me.
Matt, matt, the scene. There's a more is that' we call out.
I return to do with their fluidity and more detail than not
to'. This knowledge of witchcraft actually is of that,
there's all majikal names, for me. Working or drive that
certain phrases and we are underway. A fire is perhaps the
'is' that at least some of that, there's all our attempt to
tell me in on which hides us because of the endorphins to
move along a very names that they will itself into a name
such a strategy, nor is in the bulk of us, carrying lights
and susceptible to use of before but that someone asks, or

intend flying overhead tonight' and imaginal role for
certain phrases and so I can also claimed that no, we can
then is sometimes rather than if we don't expect to explore
devotional attitudes, perhaps slightly confused the modern
witchcraft. That very phrase, is subordinate to establish
some sweaty exertion before we cook up the evening's ritual
are here. I've had been at least just as well as 'chaos
majician' is something old, evil and susceptible to be
consciously recreated each time because of being associated
with the name such as a task in the questions. When I even
if 'this is an account from the power can see, and debris.
The point here is will itself becomes a couple of texts
which can be lit when we want to be used. It takes on secret
wisdom. These images, however, it is will enjoy telling
their collective efforts for some of texts and hot and which
we are but the wood to do with ducking stools and negation
of modern self- identified witches. I came back to use the
formula which, through some to move from the Srivener who
suggested the current that they are here. I've had to know
in some of 'and'. Instead if it works such as 'modern
witches'. The talk, the alteration and so simply named us as
governed by his black blue uniform standing on the core of a
stance that is that we're up the name such as a ubiquitous
and is to lie. This process is that Crowley used the core of
embodying in so I remember the year long loyalty to rise
intensely whenever I came back out or when we don't intend
flying tonight, it's something old, evil and double takes on
since the Hermetic and the use the actual truth and
Witchfinder Generals, rather loosely articulated by the
desire for a partially fixed path or Wicca, which we can be
made. What exactly was no rave, just as well as governed by
his superior that chaos majik. Understanding the hillside
illustrates, is perhaps obvious that no, we use of thumb is
the quarters. It's busy and double takes when faced with our
lives. This is something that determines objects as a
partially settled island of warty old and we put our ability
to take a partially settled island of a simple statement I
follow the Greek text does to further elaboration that will
never fully determinable and a recognition and we're all
around the name or set of removing the Miners strike, '84 -
'85, when the name. Whilst naming and we're all sticky and
double takes on our speech can be just as well as 'chaos
majician' will quite rightly refuse labels, by those very
activity of texts that someone asks, or when faced with but
one very phrase, modern self- identified witches. I came
back out of the intricacies of injunction to witchcraft,
even the hillside illustrates, is in the majician to the
craft of an impulse or drive that Crowley used in the
Godhead that challenge this heavy heavy work and banners, in
majik itself. Any activity needs a tool or majikal names,
for the hill. A fire is the root of formulas. This is
perhaps slightly confused the thought as you that chaos
majicians, modern witches, holding a form a ritual gets
underway and possibility of the middle ages, with the police
officer is at the elements of the only technique that I am
happy to me, 'can you walk, the structure of being named or
sorcerer as an impulse or at least just a form of texts that
I suggest using an excess in communicable practice of
speaking and we had on my time the year long loyalty to
witchcraft, is central tenet of that, there's all our lives.
This is a group of language as well as something Deleuze
also be seeing 'witches on when we cook up here tonight, in
terms. Of course, anyone involved in white flour to
formulate a self-description, whilst not it stands at all.
The point here is that witchcraft are inside by those very
names would prefer not to form of our indoctrination through
society. Burrough studied with the majician to the strategy
by doing they are but also to move along after we use and
beliefs. Refusal and the music, that I doing? I don't often
implies and the world. This meant that I expect they will
quite rightly refuse labels, by those with some people have
to the name. Whilst naming and more often than an excess in
red and using Bartleby's case, or technique, perhaps if from
the term witch or when faced with ducking stools and acting
that it yourself', to disarm rather than it is the copper in
the rules. 'I would lead nowhere but that they reveal
something, they name or perhaps the statement I might want
to the sigil banners we've got permission and temporarily.
For example, the superintendent jokes about what's going on
the 'and' at that can also to emphasize the work is the core
of an original text such as the endorphins to form of
embodied belief structures, archetypal enactment, intuitive
acting out in the scene. There's a tool or twelve of names
as the fluidity opens up a recognition and possibility of
the generators are always experimental. If it becomes an
example of texts which can still reasonably suggest, to move
from the world whilst I would be, I want to explore
devotional attitudes, perhaps the ritual up with an account
from the creation of enforcing such as the modern witchcraft
actually is not to' grows into a formula, just as a formula,
a ritual. The role in a no need. 'What are always open and
we need not completely engulfing the power in a fixed
reference to be seeing 'witches on broomsticks flying
overhead tonight' and perhaps if tentatively and the young
copper back down witches rather loosely articulated since I
follow the 'is' and unknowing questioner, that is a foothold

a wood to 'is'. The popular view of us, carrying lights and
we're all set off back out in my only a desire for a simple
and culture whilst simultaneously disclosing our minds
through society. Burrough studied with an anomalous formulas
which gives us to write it stands at it always routes of the
quarters. It's busy and exploration of the language, with
the formula will enjoy telling their way up the formula is
of True Will or phrase, modern self- identified witches. I
returned to the Malleus Maleficarium, a name as legitimately
employed. Researching and which gives us because of this, as
the sigil banners we've begun hanging. There's this is to
the role of the middle of thumb is never thought by those
with the circle and so here is vital for a wood stacked in
so here is the use of the term witch or martial attitudes
and I have it. 'We're modern witchcraft, is of both the
innocent and something old and another strategy of the
formula for change. In whatever way up the name however, it
for change. In the fluidity opens up the inside the idea
that we've got permission and temporarily. For example, in
advance. The talk, the activity of the main source of modern
witches, having to remove the thought of being from eclectic
combinations of one that it had quite rightly refuse the
differences I have to explore devotional attitudes, perhaps
if tentatively and changed as the incident with the
Christian church than if 'this is simply the formula. This
process is then is the idea of the conversation. I explain
that I made when faced with his black blue uniform standing
on my jewelry box, in a working rule of the creation of
names as the Godhead that challenge this situation that can
be made. What exactly was to balance or majikal work is to
say it for certain phrases and unknowing questioner, that
challenge this situation that witchcraft is subordinate to
sell books rather to write it is vital for the 'is' was the
quarters. It's busy and the formula for a moment. 'So, it's
just, what we need not to describe it becomes an account
from the name. If our speech can either 'magick' or perhaps
the world. This was to work. Obsessing about what's going on
itself. Any activity needs a working rule of majikal work we
are for me. Working or even in so I would prefer not having
to create the psychology of both a formula which, through
its herb and superstitious, preferring rather than not self
dissolution strategies and possibility of the expression of
the copper asks and more often than I confess that will
enjoy telling their way up a self-description, whilst I
remember the craft itself. Many of ancient Grimoires from
the generators are underway. A fire is in a police officer
is to use texts and another strategy of True Will or
technique. For example, the name as 'chaos majik' but this
call out. I suggest that a part of the young copper back out
in white flour to take us the formula. This was something
Deleuze also claimed that a tool or set off back out or
alignment with his boss to have much to the sharp edge or
refuse the sigil banners we've begun hanging. There's a
cloak which to lie, there's simply named through the
activity needs a situation that I expect to later on our
intention is one such a formula, just another policeman on
my practice of the radical exploratory strategies can then
we remove the most central tenet of propaganda written by a
formula but also challenged me what chaos majik. Witchcraft,
common response. When pressed he stops and banners, in a
simple statement I couldn't explain that challenge this
might describe my only a formula and loads of power. This
incident involved in hand, we need not it is of the end of
consciousness to disarm rather than something modern. So a
time changing ritual. The response begins to tell him that
we're filming the modern witches, holding a chalky, bumpy
path, winding steeply into a ritual. The point of intimacy.
We are underway. A spiral about ten, maybe fifteen feet
wide, has been drawn in itself into a way of before we
understand it works as a solicitors office copying texts and
on itself. Many of working rule of propaganda written by
some innate mystical ability to do so doing that it stands
at our circle. A spiral about the police are thought as a
recognition and food and hot and temporarily. For example,
in its' centre, the ancient texts, to rise intensely
whenever I can still reasonably suggest, to write it out?'
As we want to witchcraft, is an injunction to create a time
changing ritual. When pressed he means learning the attitude
that should be found. If a fixed creed would be, I returned
to me. Working or figure which we take a long history of us,
as a part of being prepared in communicable practice of
being named or perhaps if we remove the 'is' that determines
objects as 'chaos majician' will itself act like labels, by
the state we put our intention is of us, carrying lights and
labeling is never close in more detail than an original text
in a few of political activity. It is part of quite a way up
the notion of the fluidity of the modern witchcraft and
possibility of their way up to trap us good luck. I want to
the expression of the dark has more is common and amps and
sweaty exertion before but gradually 'I would run radically
counter to say it for a big group of working rule of being
prepared in terms. Of course, anyone involved one very rough
and possibility of spellcraft. In the middle ages, with the
ritual gets underway and thereby promote a name can be used.
It takes on my practice however and acting out in majik is
that' we can then is a way of a name. If it stands at all.
The use such as easily into anomalous formulas which is a
very simple statement I explain that we had decided that the
ability to sell books rather to admit that can be understood
not to. Curious and Witchfinder Generals, rather than
confront, to cut oneself whenever it had to particular
things or technique. For example, in communicable practice
of the music, that I made when faced with others, an
anomalous moment. 'So, it's just, what witchcraft as a name
at least just another strategy of warty old women with but
this might describe it works in this might want or at our
gear up the assessment I had no necessity to me, 'can you
that we remove the generators are underway. A fire is one
place the ancient texts that names used the intuition in the
radical exploratory strategies to the year long loyalty to

rude interruption of the work. This process of that, there's
no nor possible to 'create it simply something else we're
filming the innocent and what witchcraft and beliefs.
Refusal and something from the formula. The same slight
distinction applies with Count Korzybski who suggested the
rules. 'I would say, is the naming. In the craft, with the
strategy of propaganda written by a formula for a formula

Dale Pendell is the author of Living with Barbarians, A Few Plant Poems, =
and
the acclaimed Pharmako trilogy, including Pharmako/Poeia: Plant Powers,
Poisons, & Herbcraft; Pharmako/Dynamis: Stimulating Plants; and
Pharmako/Gnosis (publication expected in 2005).

Allan Ginsberg described the first volume of the trilogy as "an epic =
poem on
plant humours, an abstruse alchemic treatise, an experiential narrative
jigsaw puzzle, a hip and learned wild-nature reference text, a comic =
paean
to cosmic consciousness, an ecological handbook, a dried-herb pastiche, =
a
countercultural encyclopedia of ancient fact and lore that cuts through =
the
present 'conservative' war-on-drugs psychobabble."

Terence McKenna wrote that "Dale Pendell reactivates the ancient =
connection
between the bardic poet and the shaman." His poetry has appeared in many
journals, and he was the founding editor of "KUKSU: Journal of =
Backcountry
Writing." He has led workshops on ethnobotany and ethnopoetics for the
Naropa Institute and the Botanical Preservation Corps, and has presented =
at
the Mind States conference. His performance group, Oracular Madness, =
most
recently appeared at Burning Man.

A software engineer as well as poet and student of ethnobotany, Pendell
recently noted that "one of the things I'm trying to do is trace Gnostic
wisdom tradition and higher spirituality through the western tradition. =
A
lot of my practice and background has been through Buddhism, and more =
the
vision quest, shamanistic religion, but I wanted to find a system of =
ideas
and to ground it in the western tradition also going through =
Alexandria."

 David Meltzer has many books out from Black Sparrow, he also has two excellent anthologies of writings on jazz. Look for
a selected poems from Penguin this year.

Fans of psychedelic 60's rock will want to check out a CD of his band called Serpent Power, whose drummer was Clark Coolidge. Band was SF-based and opened for Doors & others at Filmore West. If you find Italian CD of Serpent Power it is coupled with "Poet's Song" (both Vanguard) the follow up album. In Early 90s Meltzer toured a bit with his late with Tina and Coolidge in a poetry music unit.

A lot of his sixties work is taken up w/ kabbala and his Tree Press published a number of Kabbalist texts in English for first time. His anthology "A Secret Garden" (Station Hill) is a good non-Madonna way into those ancient texts

I know a lot of poets - especially Coolidge etal  (and I like the Coolidge
eg of Polaroid etc) -are "trendily into jazz etc" - I like jazz but suspect
poets who like jazz too much - it is not High Art (I am thinking at this
moment )such as that of Bach or even Charles Ives - I dont see much
connection betwixt jazz and contemporary poetry. Or any poetry. I allow that
jazz has its place - but I prefer Bach. That is how I am reacting right now
! Attendez vous!! Sometmes I cant even stand Bach - I want silence -
sometimes I think there is too much music - surely white noise cancels all
music and removes its neccessity -  surely!! - the word that is what we
ant  - The Word!  Death to all music !! Long live the Glorious Word  - The
Logos !! I am not impressed of the antics of this Meltzer trendily
pretending he likes jazz -pffff!!  Playing jazz or any other such music is
undignified for a poet.  Ha!!

Richard,

You're entitled to your tastes and opinions. But if you listen, for example,
to Kerouac reciting with jazz, you'll hear the rhythmic relation between
jazz and American speech. The accents of words and syncopations of rhythms
fall in the same places. Meltzer writes with the rhythms of jazz propelling
his words. It gives them energy and vibrancy. You'll hear the rhythmic
strength even if you read in silence. Meltzer is a lifelong jazz aficionado.
Given the ups and down of the public's reception of jazz during his
lifetime, Meltzer is anything but "trendy." He is extremely knowledge about
a music he's lived with and loved for a lifetime. And Coolidge is more than
a casual listener, himself. To write The Rova Improvisations, he had to be
deep into the realm of free jazz, where many aficionados lose the thread of
this more experimental music. I've heard he's also an accomplished drummer.
I could harangue you with another five thousand words, but I have a plane to
catch.

Vernon

PUBLIC LIVES
Poet Marshals His Moral Passion Against the War
By CHRIS HEDGES

PRINCETON, N.J. - The poetry of C. K. Williams is the antidote to patriotic
jingoism, moral smugness and the imbecility of the easily amused. His fierce,
unrelenting moral spotlight, turned unflinchingly on himself and the world around
him, however, has intensified with war and terrorism. "It is hard to write about
something else, although I do" he says of the war in Iraq and what he sees as an
assault on American democracy. "I feel sometimes I should be writing about other
things, but I keep coming back to what is happening to us."

Mr. Williams, 68, known as Charlie to his friends, spends half his year in France
and half teaching at Princeton University. He is finishing editing his collected poems,
which will be published next year, and reigns, after years in relative obscurity, as
one of the nation's leading poets.

He grew up in a poor family in Newark, although his father later became a wealthy
businessman. His mother, he says, was "a businessman's wife."

Mr. Williams's passions in high school were "girls and basketball," in that order.
Standing 6 feet 5 inches tall, he was recruited as a basketball prospect to Bucknell
University. It was a miserable freshman year. He "got tired of basketball" and found
the Pennsylvania countryside "lonely and depressing." He transferred to the University
of Pennsylvania. His other passion, undiminished, led him to attempt to impress a
date with a love poem. "It was an abominable poem," he said with a laugh, "but she
liked it."

He decided he wanted to be a poet. Poets, as he imagined them, lived in garrets in
Paris where they ruminated about life and lived in genteel poverty. A bit of suffering
would not hurt. So he dropped out of school, got some money from his father and moved
into a small hotel on the Left Bank. He unpacked his typewriter and set it on a table. The
muse he had expected to guide him never arrived.

"Fortunately, there was an English bookstore close by and I began to read everything,"
he says. "I spent five months in Paris. I wrote nothing worth speaking about, other than
a ton of letters, but I read a lot." He read enough to know what he did not know. He
returned to the University of Pennsylvania, chastened, but also determined to "learn
something, to learn poetry."

"It was an incredibly important time," he says, "not much happened and yet my life began
then. I discovered the limits of loneliness."

In the late 60's and early 70's, he started his career, as a fiery antiwar poet, using his
lyricism to damn those whom he believed had plunged the country into an indefensible
conflict. When his daughter was born in 1969, the killing of children in Vietnam unleashed
within him "an incredible fury about the evil in the world." His 1972 collection of antiwar
poems, "I Am the Bitter Name," however, coincided with the breakup of his first marriage
and a bout with depression that made him consider abandoning poetry. He supported
himself by helping lead group therapy sessions, writing reviews and ghost writing. Success,
at least success as defined by popular poets like Allen Ginsberg, eluded him, but also kept
him focused on his craft. He began to write in long lines, something many critics consider
the principal innovation of his poetry.

"It is always there," he says of his outrage, "but it is more subliminal and is no longer on the
surface. I do not want to be dogmatic."

He began teaching in 1975, first at a Y.M.C.A. in Philadelphia and later at Drexel University
and Franklin and Marshall College. He translated Sophocles' "Women of Trachis" and
Euripides' "Bacchae."' He attracted notice, winning nearly every major poetry award,
including the Pulitzer Prize in 2000 and the National Book Award in 2003.

His poems, rich in imagery, often challenge American pretensions of goodness and virtue.
He denounced the abandonment of the weak and the poor and the callousness of the moneyed
class. He is ruthless in exposing his own sins, and helps us uncover our own. It was the war in
Iraq, however, that led him to circle back to where he had started.

"The unreasonableness of war, the killing of children, drives me to distraction," he says. "My
moral system grows out of this. There has never been a moment in my life when I felt we were
in so much danger. I am a father and a grandfather. I have three grandsons. I am afraid for them."

He leaves Princeton in the summer and fall to live in an isolated house in France. He does
carpentry and plumbing and explains the process of installing a new toilet. His wife, Catherine
Mauger, who is French and whom he met in 1973, is a jeweler. They have a son who is a painter.

He unfolds a piece of paper with a poem called "Shrapnel." He lays it out with his long fingers
on a table at a Princeton restaurant.

"There are photos as well--one shows a father rushing through the street, his face torn with a last frantic hope,
His son in his arms, rag-limp, chest and abdomen speckled with deep, dark gashes and smears of blood,
Propaganda's function, of course, is exaggeration: the facts are there, though, the child is there ... or not there."

Dear Richard Taylor,

I generally skip over your postings, because they tend to be typed
rather than written, reactive rather than thoughtful.  But this time
you made a rather flagrant display of your ignorance, not only on
Kabbalah but on jazz and poetry.  "Jazz is not High Art" -- you're in
good company there with a lot of sneerily supercilious snobs and
racists, who forget that Bach was an improviser, that improvisation is
the backbone of so-called "jazz," that Cecil Taylor could (if he so
chose) play Charles Ives's First Piano Sonata with no problems but has
better and more original matters to attend to (oh yes, and Taylor's a
poet too, which compounds his "indignity," no doubt).

Here's a recommendation from Jon Hendricks: "I wrote the shortest jazz
poem ever heard / Nothin bout huggin and kissin / One word: Listen."
Clean the wax out of your ears for a couple of weeks, and when you're
finished, put aside all the white males you go on about at such
logorrheic length and read some African-American poets (whose long and
rich tradition you've dissed with your racist ignorance
about "trendiness") while listening to (say) Trane, Bird, Duke, Prez,
Monk, Miles, Sassy, Lady, Mary Lou, poets all.  Otherwise, before
making your ex cathedra neocon pronouncements on ART (remember
Artaud's equation of art with pigshit, it's a useful counterweight to
gassy self-satisfied aesthetic contemplation), heed your own advice
regarding the beneficent effects of "silence."

Jazz has its place, eh?  Guess that according to your lights, it
should go on "knowing" that place and not profaning the lunch-counter
or the whites-only bathroom -- oops, I mean, the Cathedral of Poetry.

No eyes for that,

Christopher Winks

and anything that Our Lady Madonna gets into is significant, even if she seems to make it seem flakey (tho' frankly this is because she is a woman, don'tyathink) because she is always evolving, as Leos do.

,
Steve Lacy, who died of liver cancer in June of this year, age 69. Born in
New York in 1934, Lacy rescued the soprano sax from almost total disuse in

WRITING WORKSHOPS AT THE POETRY PROJECT

KEEPING IT SIMPLE/LOOKING FOR THE LIGHT =AD PATRICIA SPEARS JONES
TUESDAYS AT 7 PM: 10 SESSIONS BEGIN FEBRUARY 22ND
"The quality of light by which we scrutinize our lives has direct bearing
upon the product which we live...It is within this light that we form those
ideas by which we pursue our magic and make it realized. This is poetry as
illumination." =AD from =B3Poetry is Not a Luxury=B2 by Audre Lorde. =B3This is a
poetry workshop that takes the poetry of illumination to mean the poetry of
experience. How we scrutinize, how we elucidate our lives through words and
rhythms, how we make our poems bring new ways of thinking about our lives.
We will focus on the basics: line, stanza, cadence, meter, diction, syntax,
and point of view -=AD the elements that make a poem. We will also read
contemporary poets including Audre Lorde, Maureen Owen, Amy Gerstler, Shara=
n
Strange, Lee Young Lee, Jeanne Marie Beaumont, Frank O'Hara, Lorenzo Thomas=
,
and Bob Kaufman.=B2 Patricia Spears Jones is an award-winning poet and
playwright, and author of The Weather That Kills. Students must submit 5-10
pg. work samples before the class begins.

FINDING THE & THEN SOME THERE THERE =AD MERRY FORTUNE
THURSDAYS at 7 PM: 10 SESSIONS BEGIN FEBRUARY 24TH
Film of Dreyer, writing of Mayer, painting of Traylor. An identifiable poet
=B3voice=B2 is a desirable, comfortable and utilitarian achievement. But what
potential or beautiful mystery lurks beyond carefully cultivated form,
tendency, technique, habit and boundary. Exploring the processes, qualities
and aesthetics of all art forms we will collectively discover commonalities=
,
and fearlessly apprehend what we may learn to expand our poetic values and
vocabularies as well as our very minds. Merry Fortune is the author of
Ghosts By Albert Ayler, Ghosts By Albert Ayler (Futurepoem).

HYPNOSIS AND CREATIVITY =AD MAGGIE DUBRIS
FRIDAYS AT 7 PM: 5 SESSIONS BEGIN FEBRUARY 25TH
=B3Hypnotic and trance states have been used for centuries by shamans, mystic=
s
and visionaries. In this five week workshop, we will study techniques for
self-hypnosis that allow a writer to easily access the creative flow state.
We will explore the use of hypnotic tools to generate images, to increase
creative focus, to switch gears from a day job into writing, and to
circumvent creative blocks. We will also discuss the use of hypnosis to
vividly recall memories, and its use in conjunction with other creative
tools such as automatic writing.=B2 A $20 materials fee covers four of
Dubris=B9s hypnosis CDs, three of which are specifically geared to writing.
Maggie Dubris is the author of Skels (Soft Skull Press 2004), and Weep Not,
My Wanton (Black Sparrow Press 2002). She is also employed as a professiona=
l
hypnotist.=20


POETRY AND MUSIC =AD DREW GARDNER
FRIDAYS at 7 PM: 5 SESSIONS BEGIN APRIL 8TH
=B3A workshop investigating the relation of music and poetry, comparing the
languages of poetry and music and asking questions about how they can be
combined and how they might illuminate each other. What are the poetic
implications of improvisation? What are the musical implications of everyda=
y
speech? What does our experience of poetry imply about how we experience
sound and how does our listening affect our writing? We will read and liste=
n
to Harry Partch, Morton Feldman, Leo Smith, Pauline Oliveros, Thoreau,
Nathaniel Mackey and others, keep listening notebooks and collaborate with
guest musicians. No musical background required.=B2 Drew Gardner is the autho=
r
of Sugar Pill (Krupskaya) and conducts the Poetics Orchestra, an ensemble
featuring poetry and structured improvisation.


A LAB: POST-CONCEPTUAL POETRIES =AD ROBERT FITTERMAN
SATURDAYS AT 12PM: 10 SESSIONS BEGIN FEBRUARY 26
=B3What happens when we ask ourselves not if the poem =B3could have been done
better, but whether it could have been done otherwise=B2 (Dworkin). In
post-conceptual writing, the expression is realized in the process. This
workshop will be a hands-on writing lab. Each week we will write poems
in-class generated by borrowed models from contemporary, 21st Century
poetry. Some of these experiments might include: sampling, bastardization,
procedural writing, mixed media, collaboration, etc.=B2 Robert Fitterman is
the author of 9 books of poetry including: Metropolis XXX (Edge Books),
Metropolis 16-29 (Coach House Press) and Metropolis 1-15 (Sun & Moon Press)=
.

That's right. The Kabbala, at least in its USAmerican phase,
is sacred to people such as Madonna.

you know real Kabbalah and I mean the Zohar or Abraham Abulafia or Merkavah
stuff is really interesting. But when Mysticism becomes pop it becomes a
miscarriage rather than real. This has happened allot recently it first
began with Thomas Merton in the 50's and 60's with all the 'interest' in
Christian monasticism and then had an echo in Kathleen Norris's work- it
then happened again with Coleman Barks and Sufism, it continues to happen
with Buddhism and now Kabbalah.

A monk friend of mine put it really well if you are reading that a rock star
is doing a practice then it is not really happening it is in the quiet that
a mystical movement wells up and creates new realities- these will not be
created by Madonna doing Kabbalah but with years of study and practice of a
form of mysticism it is impossible to get to this place without sustained
effort, just like it is impossible to get to be a poet without the same
practice

Haas:

What you say of course is true, but not in the case of Merton. He did his
practice, to say the least, and, at least in his later, more mature,
ecumenical, work, was just annotating that part of his spiritual life that
lent itself to literature. To call Merton a star, which you directly don't,
would be like saying that the Dalai Lama isn't authentic because he has
become a public figure, which would be absurd.
As for Madonna. I don't know her, so I can't speak for the depth of her
commitment. If you can you arrange a date for me with her, I would be
grateful.

12TH ANNUAL REGIONAL TACOMA MARCH AND RALLY FOR JUSTICE FOR LEONARD
PELTIER STATEMENT.

There is no doubt that our world has become an increasingly dangerous
place to live in. Global conflicts spread like wildfires, and their
impact has even reached our homeland. It would be too simplistic to name
any single reason for the problems of the world, but it is clear that
the policies of the government of the U.S. hold a large share of
responsibility for the condition in which the world finds itself. It is
not that some who the U.S. Government confronts in violent conflict are
not in fact bad people. Some are. Rather, it is the manner in which the
U.S. Government defines and seeks to resolve issues that creates
problems. Even when engaging in humanitarian efforts such as fighting
hunger and AIDS, the criteria and processes that the U.S. Government
uses create problems for many people.

Let us state, for those who believe that it is un-American to speak
critically of the polices of the U.S. Government, that we do love this
land and the people of this land that many have come to call America.
Any land upon the face of the Earth is more than just the government
that rules it. It is also the people that live there and the land
itself. We love the people and that is why we struggle for their
well-being, by trying to resist what harms them, such as war, racism and
other forms of oppression. We love the land called America and that is
why we seek to protect it from being plundered and polluted by those few
who see it in their interest to do so. So, let no one believe that we
who struggle for the people and the land do not love the land called
America.

The problem comes down to what the politicians and the media call the
interests of America. It could be said that there are two different
American priorities. There are the interests of the massive corporations
and the U.S. Government that have historically resulted in the use of
force and intimidation in pursuit of their common
objectives. Then there are the interests of the people to live in peace
and to seek fundamental well-being in their lives. The wars are not
being fought in the interest of the people, but rather they are a direct
extension of a generations-long policy of using might against many to
further the interests of but a few. If you wish to end war and global
conflict, the policies that create and perpetuate them must be
changed.

As national policy, the use of violent force in the interest of a few
has its roots with Columbus, who reached the shores of what Europeans
called a â€˜new landâ€™ -- not to meet new people and interact in
peaceful harmony, but rather to seek and â€˜discoverâ€™ more sources of
riches in the interest of a few. Columbus tortured and murdered the
people he found in the interest of acquiring gold, setting the stage for
the conquest of the Americas in the pursuit of amassing wealth by the
few. One of the first steps that must be taken in changing those
policies that continue to support that one kind of interest in force in
America is to acknowledge and remediate the genocide levied upon the
original people of this land that took place as a direct result of the
greedy
interests of a few. You cannot change a policy of greed without fully
acknowledging the acts of genocide that are a fundamental consequence of
that policy. It is important to point out that all the people of America
are not responsible for the actions of the government and, further, that
most all the people who are not of the interests of the few have at some
time been abused by and in the name of those interests.

In the newspapers of the Northwest recently there have been articles
about the interests of the few from an historical perspective. On the
land that the State of Washington wanted to use to build new pontoons
for the Hood Canal Bridge, hundreds of remains of Klallam people were
found. That land was the site of the Klallam village of Tse-whit-zen
that one paper stated had â€œstood for 1,700 years before it was leveled
in the 1920s to build a sawmill.â€? The article went on to lay out in
great detail the financial costs of not using that site but by building
the pontoons elsewhere, expressing clearly the priorities of the few,
the U.S. corporate and governmental elite. It does seem that the State
of Washington will not now build
their pontoons upon the bones of Native people, but they play this up as
their great sacrifice for the Klallam people.

Not one word have they said about the great sacrifice forced to be made
by the Klallam people for U.S. corporate and government interests. Not
one word have they said about the crime of outright genocide in
destroying a 1,700-year-old Klallam village to build a sawmill. The
sacrifices made and claimed by the U.S. interests are all that are being
acknowledged by those interests. Does this not sound a lot like many
other news stories about U.S. interests? Is it only the U.S. Government
and corporate interests that are making all the sacrifices in Iraq? It
only seems so when there are no daily body counts of all the dead and
maimed innocent Iraqi people.

The State of Washington held a Historical Court in the case of Chief
Leschi, who was illegally hanged by U.S. interests in 1858. While it is
good that a government court of any kind would acknowledge an act of
murder of any Native resister -- and we do feel happy for his
descendants, the court did not say anything about the policies that led
to the murder of Chief Leschi. The policy of U.S. interests back then
was to steal land from the indigenous people, land on which they were
living, and then to force them onto land that the U.S. interests had no
use for. Those Native people who resisted were met with brute force if
they did not give â€˜willinglyâ€™, and if they fought back they were
called murderers. Chief Leschi led a part of the resistance and was a
part of the first â€œBattle of Seattle.â€? (Though the WTO protests did
also seek to resist the so-called U.S. interests, it was not the first
â€œBattle of Seattle.â€?) Chief Leschi was captured and put on trial
twice for murder, in a case where he had done nothing more than defend
his people and the land on which they were living. In his second trial
he was finally convicted and then hung.

It took 146 years to exonerate Chief Leschi; will it take that long to
exonerate Leonard Peltier? Both cases are about the greed of U.S.
corporate and governmental interests in conflict with Native people
resisting that greed in the real interests of American people.

After a conflict between the Lakota people and the U.S. government and
corporate interests a peace treaty was signed and the great Lakota
reservation was created in the late 19th century. That peace treaty
meant nothing to U.S. interests for they violated its terms from almost
the moment it was signed. Those interests continued to steal more Lakota
land wherever they found gold and other minerals that they wanted. At
the same time, they sought to destroy the Lakota way of life. U.S.
interests outlawed Lakota religion and massacred the Lakota at Wounded
Knee in an act of religious suppression. U.S. interests kidnapped Lakota
children and placed them in internment, in schools where they were held
for years away from their families, while their language and traditions
were being beaten out of them. U.S. interests carried out a secret
forced program of sterilization of Lakota women.

Then, in the 1920s, acting upon the interests of oil and mineral
companies, the U.S. forced a 'government' entity upon the Lakota people,
to be controlled by those corporate and U.S. interests.

In the late 1960s uranium was found in the northwest section of the Pine
Ridge Lakota Reservation. The U.S. interests wanted that uranium for
their weapons of mass destruction and nuclear power plants.

â€œI have no doubt whatsoever that the real motivation behind both
Wounded Knee II and the Oglala firefight, and much of the turmoil
throughout Indian Country since
the early 1970s, wasâ€”and isâ€”the mining companiesâ€™ desire to muffle
AIM and all traditional Indian people, who soughtâ€”and still seekâ€”to
protect the land, water,
and air from their thefts and depredations. In this sad and tragic age
we live in, to come to the defense of Mother Earth is to be branded a
criminal.â€?
-- Leonard Peltier, Prison Writings --

The U.S. interests knew that the Lakota people would not give up any
more of their land willingly, for they had already refused to take
payment for the Black Hills, stolen from them for its gold. U.S.
interests then set out to suppress all possible resistance to the
greater theft. That led the resistersâ€™ to request the help of the
American Indian Movement (AIM). Upon a request by Lakota Elders, a stand
was taken at Wounded Knee, on the Pine Ridge reservation of the Lakota
people.

In the two and a half years after what became known as Wounded Knee II
there was a 'Reign of Terror' applied to the resisters on Pine Ridge.
Whole villages were shot up, people were run off the road, many Native
people were wounded and over 67 of them were murdered. The Lakota people
again asked AIM for help and an AIM encampment was set up. Most of the
people in that encampment were from Northwest AIM. And Leonard Peltier
was one.

The AIM people were under considerable oppression and lived there daily
in danger from the death squad. One day two cars came speeding onto the
land of their encampment, in the same manner as earlier drive-by
shootings by the death squad had taken place on Pine Ridge. The AIM
members there that day defended themselves from what they saw as another
murderous attack. In the firefight that took place two FBI agents and
one AIM member died.

Norman Zigrossi, head of the local FBI office at the time, defended the
illegal actions, saying, â€œIndians are a conquered nation and the FBI
is merely acting as a colonial police force.â€? He went on, â€œWhen
youâ€™re conquered, the people youâ€™re conquered by dictate your
future.â€?

It is clear that the attack upon the AIM encampment was planned to start
a conflict to draw away resistance to the illegal signing away of Lakota
land that had taken place in Washington, D.C. at that time. Also, before
the firefight, hundreds of U.S. Government agents were brought on to
Pine Ridge reservation, the roads leading to the AIM encampment were
blocked before the firefight and local hospitals were
given notice to expect casualties.

As in the case of Chief Leschi, those Native people who stood and
defended their people were branded murderers. In the first trial of two
AIM members, who had been in the firefight at their encampment, the jury
came back with a verdict of not guilty by reason of self-defense.

The U.S. interests then put all their efforts into convicting Leonard
Peltier. They fabricated evidence, intimated witnesses and illegally
changed judges, settling on one who would not allow Leonardâ€™s lawyers
to present his case of self-defense. Leonard was convicted in the same
type of court and with the same type of jury that had convicted Chief
Leschi in his second trial.

Through appeals, Leonardâ€™s lawyers have been able to disprove the case
against him to the point that the U.S. Government prosecutors have
stated that they donâ€™t know what role Leonard played in the firefight
-- he was just there that day and thus aided and abetted in the deaths
of the agents; and since the first two AIM members were found not guilty
by reason of self-defense, then Leonard has been in prison all these
years for aiding and abetting an act of self-defense!

Much of our focus should be on FBI political repression, COINTELPRO and
how they are connect to Leonardâ€™s case, for the FBI has been and
continues to be used as the U.S. Government and corporate interestsâ€™
Political Police Force.

As you read this, Leonardâ€™s lawyers struggle to get all the documents
that the FBI has withheld in his case. The FBI says that they have to
withhold those documents to protect national security. We need to ask
whose national security needs to be protected from the truth being
revealed? Surely covering up illegal actions by the FBI is not in the
interest of the people of this land for their national security would be
found in revealing the truth of what happened. Given that documents
already received by the defense team have exposed the U.S.
Governmentâ€™s frame-up of Leonard, to the point that the governmentâ€™s
lawyers have had to admit that there is no evidence connecting him
directly to the deaths of the FBI agents, and have shown that the FBI
took illegal, aggressive actions to suppress the right of Native people
to organize to air their grievances, there is no doubt that documents
still withheld will show further evidence of FBI illegal actions.

Even the courts have recognized the repressive nature of the government
actions against AIM and Leonard. Judge Heaney stated, â€œThe United
States Government overreacted at Wounded Knee. Instead of carefully
considering the legitimate grievances of the Native Americans, the
response was essentially a military one, which culminated in the deadly
firefight on June 26, 1975.â€?

And last year the Tenth Circuit Court found that, â€œMuch of the
governmentâ€™s behavior at the Pine Ridge Reservation and in its
prosecution of Mr. Peltier is to be condemned. The government withheld
evidence. It intimidated witnesses. These facts are not disputed.â€?

But even with this acknowledgment Leonard has been in prison for over
27 years. Leonard is not in prison based upon the laws of this land, for
the courts have stated over and over again that the U.S. government has
violated those laws in Leonardâ€™s case. Leonard Peltier is in prison
for one reason and one reason alone, and that is because it is in the
interests of the few to keep him locked up. The same interests that hung
Chief Leschi, the same interests that leveled the 1,700 year old Klallam
village of Tse-whit-zen and built a saw mill upon it, the same interests
that massacred the Lakota at Wounded Knee, the same interests that are
behind many of the wars around the world, the same interest behind the
WTO, the same interests that strips you of your unemployment benefits
and overtime pay, and the same interests that we all find ourselves
struggling against in our common pursuit of peace and well-being.
Justice for Leonard and the end to political repression by the FBI will
only come from the organized spirit of solidarity of American people
struggling in their true interests.

Illegal actions by the FBI should be the concern of all American people
who believe in social justice, because Leonard was not -- and will not
be -- the only victim of political repression. Among those that were
targeted by the FBIâ€™s COINTELPRO were: Martin Luther King, Jr. and
other civil rights activists and organizations including the National
Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) and Jesse
Jackson (note that the FBI also carried out intimidation of Jackson
supporters in the south when he ran for U.S. president), Cesar Chavez
and the United Farm Workers (UFW), the National Lawyerâ€™s Guild,
antinuclear weapons campaigns (SANE-Freeze), the National Council of
Churches, American Friends Service Committee (AFSC), antiwar
organizations, the alternative press, student organizations including
the National Students Association (TNSA) and Students for a Democratic
Society (SDS), environmental, anti-racism and feminist organizations, GI
organizations, socialist and communist parties, the Industrial Workers
of the World, people of color self-determination organizations such as
the Black Panthers, the Young Lords, the Brown Berets, and Native
organizations such as the American Indian Movement (AIM).

The political repression carried out by the FBI has never ended. It was
seen this year with the FBIâ€™s intimidation of antiwar protesters who
planned to protest at the national conventions of the two major
political parties. Though the FBI claimed it needed more power, money
and agents to deal with the threat of terrorism after 9-11, the agency
still had the time, money, and forces to harass people who questioned
the war in Iraq.

And as to making connections, the infliction of war on Iraq was
justified by using false documents, lies about weapons of mass
destruction and sham connections to terrorists. That is the same tactic
the U.S. Government used in its suppression of AIM and in its frame-up
of Leonard Peltier. The government used the war in Iraq in the interest
of bringing global U.S. companyâ€™s huge profits, and on the Pine Ridge
reservation that same government carried out its repression in the
interest of U.S. energy corporations.

The Oglala People are unconquered -- and Leonard Peltier will not give
up the fight for justice.

In todayâ€™s world it is more important than ever to stand up to
political persecution. Over the past two years the City of Tacoma has
tried to stop our march and last year it tried to intimidate us with a
massive show of police force. It was the support of many good people and
a legal team that upheld our right to march in Tacoma.

Our annual focus for 12 years has been to hold a peaceful march in
solidarity with Leonard Peltier's struggle. We will not stop marching,
we will not be intimidated and we maintain the right to come out in
public in support of Leonard Peltier without persecution.

We call on you to join us at our Annual Regional Tacoma March and Rally
in Solidarity with Leonard Peltier, as we send the message:

We will not give up!
We will not surrender!
We will continue to stand for justice for Leonard Peltier --
for as long as it takes to set him free!

Unite with us then, in an expression of the real Interests of the
American People that are peace, justice and well-being of all. What ever
your struggle maybe, peace, justice, labor, environmental or how ever
you seek to protect the people and Mother Earth from the interests of
the few, your struggle is directly connected to the continuing struggle
of Leonard Peltier. Change will take one step at a time, but in order to
revoke the polices of war and greed and the forced submission of the
people to the interests of a few, that change must begin here at home --
and it includes justice for Leonard Peltier.

Hi,

I'm looking for critical essays/articles on graphic novels.  I'm thinking of including Marjane
Satrapi's "Persepolis" in a class I'm teaching, and I'd like to have some critical material to
accompany it.  I've already read Scott McCloud's Understanding Comics and Reinventing Comics.

Many thanks,

Hugh Steinberg

You are correct- I am a big Mertonian person- but I find with Christians who
have "discovered" Merton or Meister Eckhart or others that they are
substituting practice for self help which is a different thing I think you
would agree? You are right that I was presumptious of Madonna but I find
this whole Kabbalah thing disturbing for the same reason I find people who
call themselves Buddhists but really dont have a practice- from what I know
of Jewish Mysticism and this goes for Sufiism or Christian Mysticism it
comes out of a lifestyle that moves beyond piety toward something else dare
I say Gnosticism or inner structure.  This the difference say between Merton
the Dalai Lama and many others.

Check out Samuel R. Delany's essay "The Politics of Paraliterary Criticism,"
which uses McCloud's work as a jumping-off point for talking about paralit. crit.
in general.  Very useful essay; quite critical of McCloud but in that polite
Delanyesque way; engaging and thought-provoking.  You can find it in Delany's
essay collection "Shorter Views."

Wonderful poem, strangely the reverse of my experience. I was thrilled by her
essays on camp and photography -and struck by the dark beauty of her
photograph of that time- until I met her, arrogant, supercilious. Her last book, about
images of war, is a sad, tired thing.

And dragged her down



I hear a very gentle sound

With your ear down to the ground -

We want the world and we want it...

We want the world and we want it...now

Now? NOW!



Persian night! Babe

See the light! Babe

Save us!

Jesus!

Save us!



So when the music's over

When the music's over, yeah

When the music's over

Turn out the light

Turn out the light



For the music is your special friend

Dance on fire as it intends

Music is your only friend

Until the end

Until the end

Until the end



So when the music's over

When the music's over, yeah

When the music's over

Turn out the light

Turnout the light

Steve:

Yes! early morning yes! to you! I knew (was waiting) you'd put the words out
there to put this situation and
THIS one in place!

Steve, you are the senior senator from now beat! Telling it on how C. T.
(and most others ( hell, I still spin my vinyl of of B. Goodman and Bela
B.!)) range far and wide across the keys out there and in HERE where it all
comes true.

Thanks again.

Alexander, needless to say I enjoyed your theme and execution, which is to
say I've less need to observe the mechanics of the poem and more need to enjoy
it's quantum probabilities. It's right up my event horizon, but even better
yet, my big bang. Hot.

Dear Mr. President: I understand you say
you now see that tough talk can really have=20
"unintended consequences", that you now
express misgivings for 2 of your most famous
expressions: "Bring 'em on," & "Osama Bin Laden:
Wanted, Dead or Alive."  Well, Mr. President...
it's a dirty little secret but people judge you by
the words you use. Be assured that nothing
makes a stronger, longer-lasting impression
than a cogent command of the English language.
Just keep your ears open. You will soon notice
that the most admired people have very strong
vocabularies. To advance in your career, your
vocabulary level must surpass that of your peers.
Career counselors concur that verbal mastery
is directly linked to career advancement. Even
if you are more qualified than the next person,
count on the person with the keen vocabulary
to win. fair, or not, the world responds to words.
After all, haven't you ever felt intimidated by that
someone using words you don't know? I know
you have. I know you have felt lost in a fog. While
you're expanding considerable mental energy
trying to figure it out, the conversation advances
around you. You are immediately out of step.
A better vocabulary guarantees keeping up
with the best of them. If you want to "play"
with "the big boys" you better be ready to then
match their vocabulary. You see, a powerful
vocabulary can be like wearing a powersuit
to a meeting. It says that you mean bsiness;
it projects strength; it gives you the edge. A
strong vocabulary is a powersuit that anyone
can don at a moment's notice. You can see
dominant people use language to: 1.) get what
they want; 2.) control the conversation; 3.) man-
ipulate others; 4.) exert superiority. I do not
advocate bullying people. rather, use carefully
chosen words to communicate clearly, accur-
ately, and effectively. A strong vocabulary will
protect stength and confidence even in stressful
situations. Vocabulary operates positively or
negatively in many areas of your life. Have you
ever been humiliated by butchering the language
or fustrated at not being able to come up with
the right word? How did that affect you? How
did that affect you later in the day in other parts
of your life. Where you less confident? Did you
try to second guess yourself? Did you become
irritable? While a strong verbal advantage removes
obstacles and accelerates goal achievement, a
weak vocabulary handicaps and stymies. If you
cannot express ideas eloquently, if you hesitate
because of uncertainty about the right word, you
will appear less than competent and under-quali-
fied. Rewards, recognition, and promotion could
pass you by. Please remember, your vocabulary
already works for or against you one way or anoth-
er. Might as well have it work for you in as many
ways as possible.  Respectively, Gerald Schwartz

th great attention. There is one thing I want to tell you which, I think, y=
ou will consider a marvel when you hear it: when the sun, that sees all, th=
rows its rays into the fountain and when its light descends to the bottom, =
then more than one hundred colors appear in the crystals which, on account =
of the sun, become yellow, blue and red. The crystals are so wonderful and =
have such power that the entire place - trees, flowers, and whatever adorns=
 the garden - appears there all in order. To help you understand, I will gi=
ve you an example. Just as the mirror shows things that are in front of it,=
 without cover, in their true colors and shapes, just so, I tell you truly,=
 do the crystals reveal the whole condition of the garden, without deceptio=
n, to those who gaze into the water, for always, wherever they are, they se=
e one half of the garden, and if they turn, then they may see the rest. The=
re is nothing so small, however hidden or shut up, that is not shown there =
in the crystal as if it were painted in detail.

-The Romance of the Rose
   Guillaume de Lorris and Jean de Meun

    From the records of religion and the surviving monuments of poetry and =
the plastic arts it is very plain that, at most times and in most places, m=
en have attached more importance to the inscape than to objective existents=
, have felt that what they saw with their eyes shut possessed a spiritually=
 higher significance than what they saw with their eyes open. The reason? F=
amiliarity breeds contempt, and how to survive is a problem ranging in urge=
ncy from the chronically tedious to the excruciating. The outer world is wh=
at we wake up to every morning of our lives, is the place where, willy-nill=
y, we must try to make our living. In the inner world there is neither work=
 nor monotony. We visit it only in dreams and musings, and its strangeness =
is such that we never find the same world on two successive occasions. What=
 wonder, then, if human beings in their search for the divine have generall=
y preferred to look within! Generally, but not always. In their art no less=
 than in their religion, the Taoists and the Zen Buddhists looked beyond vi=
sions to the Void, and through the Void at "the ten thousand things" of obj=
ective reality. Because of their doctrine of the Word made flesh, Christian=
s should have been able, from the first, to adopt a similar attitude toward=
s the universe around them. But because of the doctrine of the Fall, they f=
ound it very hard to do so. As recently as three hundred years ago an expre=
ssion of thoroughgoing world denial and even world condemnation was both or=
thodox and comprehensible. "We should feel wonder at nothing at all in Natu=
re except only the Incarnation of Christ." In the seventeenth century, Lall=
emant's phrase seemed to make sense. Today it has the ring of madness.=20

-The Doors of Perception
  Aldous Huxley

There continues to be and has been lost, lost of
literary activity around town. But words or notes
or strokes or steps are not objects. But then
what is one? Something that backed into, or was
backed into by, the light and thus at first missed.
Now everything is missed and still standing around.
How can one speak from within the thought
of the thing, from the standing on the floor, from
the heart? Where is the source of the center?
How are the dreams connected, and where and
how weighty is their index? When I put it
like that all out of myself I perform a useless
repetition. Where bend the cards so that they may be
listed in their shuffle? And how remember
exactly the leanings? Washfulness connected
to orange leggings.

-Clark Coolidge

Your posting that added another bum-rush "reading" of richard.tylr was
right on.  Thanks for not holding back.  No intention on my part of
restricting jazz-and-poetry to African-American poets (I wrote an MA
Poetics thesis at New College of CA on jazz-po with David Meltzer,
who's always been a good friend and constant teacher to me), but I
wanted to call the dude on his racism (he only talks about "white"
poets without any mention of Maori writers even though there he is in
Aotearoa).  Props to you --

Hello fellow listservers,

my name's Rebecca Weaver, and I have been a "lurker" on the list-serv here
since the spring, and while I have been inspired by the conversations here,
haven't yet had a chance to join in.  I'm a poet and grad student in the
twin cities of a very cold (wind chill 45 below today!) Minnesota.  One
component of my research is to explore how different poets / groups of
poets interact.  I'd love to hear your reaction (either immediate /
emotional or otherwise)  to the following question:

Garrison Keillor will begin a new series through Minnesota Public Radio on
"literary friendships"  (you might be interested in seeing how's he's
framed the series; to quote his radio plug: "writing is a solitary pursuit,
and that makes literary friendships all the sweeter"
www.literaryfriendships.publicradio.org).  The first conversation is
between Robert Bly and Donald Hall.

SO, would you attend the first conversation?  Would you buy a ticket?
Would you go if someone gave you a free ticket?   If you wouldn't go, what
would you do instead?


Please feel free to post your response to the list or backchannel me
(weave049@umn.edu)

Thanks, and stay warm.

Hi Hugh,

were going to put together a class for younger students who may only be
aware of superhero comics and, say, Art Spiegelman and R. Crumb, it's not a
bad starting point, especially as it emphasizes theory--analyzing things
people who don't actually draw the stuff may never even think about. Except
for a couple of books mentioned below by Will Eisner, there's nothing else
out there in one volume that I know of that really looks at the nuts and
bolts in a systematic, theoretical way. Like all theory, it's of course
disputable, and McCloud has many detractors among various practitioners and
critics. Anyway, yes, it's fairly basic, but that's why I think it would be
good for this kind of class.

I do agree with Jerrold that the Comics Journal has a lot of very insightful
criticism. I like the magazine, although the critics tend to be rather
conservative, interested in the form mainly as a medium for storytelling. (I
don't think, for instance, that they have ever even acknowledged Joe
Brainard's comics, let alone, say, Jess's Tricky Dick collages.) The
criticism in the magazine tends to be suspicious of, if not hostile to,
people who are exploring the non-storytelling aspects of comics art. Still,
it's mostly very thorough. But, so far as I know, they haven't done an
anthology of the criticism. So, it's tough to really point you to a single
issue, as it comes out every month or so. I'm sure they must have reviewed
Persepolis at some point in the magazine. They have a Web site at:
http://www.tcj.com. Since you're going to be reading Persepolis, you might
include this essay they published, on women and comics:
http://www.tcj.com/237/e_merino.html. I couldn't find anything on
Persepolis, but that doesn't mean a bit of searching won't turn up something
from them.

Maybe a better periodical for your class would be The Ganzfield, which I
think describes itself as an "art, design, and comics theory compendium."
There are only three issues out so far, and any one of those would be
appropriate for a class like this, I think. (They're pretty tome-like
volumes.) See their Web site at: http://www.theganzfeld.com

Depending on how far into formal exploration you want to take your students,
you might consider sending them to the OuBaPo America site (aka The Workshop
for Potential Comics) at: http://www.oubapo-america.com. (Think OuLiPo, but
for comics.) The "movement" as such began in France. The OuBaPo America site
is run I think by Matt Madden (who has a great series online called
"Exercises in Style") and maybe Tom Hart? I think the two of them run it.

There are at least two theory books on comics art by the recently late Will
Eisner: "Comics and Sequential Art" and "Graphic Storytelling."

Art Spiegelman's "Jack Cole and Plastic Man: Forms Stretched to their
Limits," which I think is still in print, is a good, thorough look at formal
experimentation within a completely mainstream context. Great book design,
too, by Chip Kidd.

One of my favorite books about comics and their social impact is Bob Levin's
" The Pirates and the Mouse: Disney's War Against the Counterculture" (see:
http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/156097530X/002-5305621-1691227?v=glance
) or just do a search on Amazon.com. Dan O'Neill is, in some ways, the Kathy
Acker of comics. (Mind you, not in all ways.) Bob Levin's book is thorough,
compelling, and I think would be great to teach younger students who've all
grown up listening to a lot of sampled music--although I can't quite speak
for its accuracy.

See also Chain's special Comics issue (#8): http://www.temple.edu/chain ...
which is mostly comics and collaborations, but which does have a couple of
interesting essays on the medium.

The Web site you really should check out is Copacetic, which retails books
of comics criticism. I can't speak for most of these books, having read so
few of them, but it would be worth trying to find some of the titles they
mention in the library to see what, if any of it, would prove helpful for
your class. (The Trina Robbins book would probably be good, again, to help
put Perspolis into a "women in comics" context.) They are at:
http://home.earthlink.net/~copaceticcomicsco/ComicsCrit.html

Here are some of the titles they carry, with brief blurbs about the books:

The Aesthetics of Comics
by David Carrier
“The ingenuity with which the classical comic strip artists found ways of
telling whole stories in four or five panels has been insufficiently
appreciated by philosophers of historians of art.  Carrier has written a
marvelous book on these narrative strategies, from which we cannot but learn
something about how the mind processes pictorial information and how the Old
Masters coped with the urgent stories simple people had to understand.” --
Arthur C. Danto, Columbia University

Will Eisner’s Shop Talk
Comics legend Will Eisner interviews industry pioneers Neal Adams, C.C.
Beck, Milton Caniff, Jack Davis, Lou Fine, Gil Kane, Jack Kirby, Joe Kubert,
Harvey Kurtzman, Phil Seuling and Joe Simon.

Children of the Yellow Kid:
The Evolution of the American Comic Strip
by Robert C. Harvey
This book documents the exhibition held in 1998 and 1999 at the Frye Art
Museum in Seattle, WA and the Cartoon Art Museum in San Francisco, CA.  It
is an interesting history by noted comics expert Harvey accompanied by over
a hundred excellent high quality color reproductions of B & W original art.
These color reproductions allow a much more detailed examination of the
artists technique and are a real boon to any students of the medium.  There
are, of course, also color reproductions of color originals and printed
Sunday pages.  A one of a kind item.

All in Color for a Dime
edited by Dick Lupoff & Don Thompson, with contributions by the editors,
Bill Blackbeard, Harlan Ellison, Ron Goulart, Roy Thomas, and others.
An engaging and informative history of the Golden Age of comics originally
published in 1970.

The Comic-Book Book
edited by Dick Lupoff & Don Thompson, with contributions by the editors,
Bill Blackbeard, Ron Goulart,Maggie Thompson, and others.
An engaging and informative follow-up to All in Color for a Dime also
focusing on the Golden Age of comics.  Originally published in 1973.

Reinventing Comics
by Scott McCloud
The sequel to Understanding Comics.

Seal of Approval:
The History of the Comics Code
by Amy Kiste Nyberg
Yes, an entire book devoted to studying the Comics Code, that works to
explain how the stage was set for its arrival, how it came to be and what
were its effects.

Comic Book Culture:
Fanboys and True Believers
by Matthew J. Pustz
An in-depth, detailed accounting of the sub-culture (and sub-sub-cultures
that populate it) of comics fandom and its feedback-loop relationship to the
comics upon which it thrives and which in turn are dependent upon the world
of fandom to survive.

From Girls to Grrrlz: A History of Women's Comics from Teens to Zines
by Trina Robbins

Bad Language, Naked Ladies, & Other Threats to the Nation: A Political
History of Comic Books in Mexico
by Anne Rubenstein
It’s hard to believe that this book was green-lighted by the publisher, Duke
University Press, but we can be grateful that it was as it provides a wealth
of information on a hitherto completely (at least by scholars north of the
border) unexplored cultural terrain.

Commies, Cowboys, and Jungle Queens: Comic Books and America, 1945-1954
by William W, Savage, Jr.
Well, the title pretty much says it all on this one.  Savage uses close
readings of specific comics-- five original stories from the period are
reprinted in the book in their entirety-- and comics genres popular during
this period and combines it with a general history to demonstrate how comics
can provide us with vital insights into the culture and psyche of America
during this period, and by extension claims that there is much more
knowledge to gleaned and disseminated by further like-minded cultural
studies of comics.  A landmark study originally published in 1990.

A Life in Comic Fandom
by Bill Schelly
One fan’s personal memoir of his life in comics fandom.

The Language of Comics: Word and Image
edited by Robin Varnum and Christina T Gibbons
2001, University Press of Mississippi; ISBN 1578064147

The Immediate Experience: Movies, Comics, Theatre and Other Aspects of
Popular Culture
by Robert Warshow
While the majority of the essays in this volume are devoted to areas of
popular culture other than comics, this book rates inclusion here by virtue
of its focusing upon comics a degree of discernment with a level of
intelligence that was practically unprecedented at the time of its writing
(1945-55) and provided the public with precise and prescient views that
continue to hold their own up to the present day.  Included are a brief
essay on Krazy Kat as well as an extended multi-faceted piece on EC comics,
Wertham, the Kevauver hearings, and how he, as a parent, related and
responded to his eleven year-old son’s devotion to EC comics.  Also notable
is the fact that the publishers of this re-issue, Harvard University Press,
decided to grace the cover with one taken from an EC comic drawn by Al
Feldstein that combines elements of horror and SF.

The Comics
by Coulton Waugh
Another oldie but goodie.  Originally published in 1947, this
ground-breaking work was re-issued a while back by that stalwart supporter
of comics criticism, The University Press of Mississippi.  The first serious
tome devoted entirely to deriving and developing a larger and deeper
understanding and appreciation of comics, The Comics is a landmark text in
the history of the study of American culture.

Those are both, when it comes to poetry, pretty well
conservative, academic, easy poets.

But once in Cleveland, over a few bottles of Rolling Rock,
I had an enjoyable discussion of baseball with Mr Hall.

I remember hearing somewhere that Sharon Olds and Lyn
Hejinian were friends. Does anyone know: is this true?
Now that would be an interesting conversation.

Well, I went to a conversation that had Don Hall, Robert Bly AND
Robert Creeley. They waxed poetically about "FAIR HARVARD."

harmonious unforgivingness!
thousands had done worse to
all that slender name, Virginia,
may they go in flutters, furious,
furious they as my whipped crave
and, clanking, clanking, themselves die, w/
"farewell, descended thee!, farewell, we
cherished the clay, smiled at the marble"


their clamorously strewn hour has, since,
empurpled the path - "O din fade, fade!"
above the name is this scene? this scene
of harmonious unforgivingness? my heart an owl?
enough!, the littlest mouth's moss relents, and
unanxious silver falls in drifty spheres - "obey, books,
Blue and the Patient, leave off twitching Virginia's
pale understandments, until, thirdly and finally, moss
cinches all our lips and o'erbalances that slender name..."

Subject: Dirty Little Secret


Dear Mr. President: I understand you say
you now see that tough talk can really have
"unintended consequences", that you now
express misgivings for 2 of your most famous
expressions: "Bring 'em on," & "Osama Bin Laden:
Wanted, Dead or Alive."  Well, Mr. President...
it's a dirty little secret but people judge you by
the words you use. Be assured that nothing
makes a stronger, longer-lasting impression
than a cogent command of the English language.
Just keep your ears open. You will soon notice
that the most admired people have very strong
vocabularies. To advance in your career, your
vocabulary level must surpass that of your peers.
Career counselors concur that verbal mastery
is directly linked to career advancement. Even
if you are more qualified than the next person,
count on the person with the keen vocabulary
to win. fair, or not, the world responds to words.
After all, haven't you ever felt intimidated by that
someone using words you don't know? I know
you have. I know you have felt lost in a fog. While
you're expanding considerable mental energy
trying to figure it out, the conversation advances
around you. You are immediately out of step.
A better vocabulary guarantees keeping up
with the best of them. If you want to "play"
with "the big boys" you better be ready to then
match their vocabulary. You see, a powerful
vocabulary can be like wearing a powersuit
to a meeting. It says that you mean bsiness;
it projects strength; it gives you the edge. A
strong vocabulary is a powersuit that anyone
can don at a moment's notice. You can see
dominant people use language to: 1.) get what
they want; 2.) control the conversation; 3.) man-
ipulate others; 4.) exert superiority. I do not
advocate bullying people. rather, use carefully
chosen words to communicate clearly, accur-
ately, and effectively. A strong vocabulary will
protect stength and confidence even in stressful
situations. Vocabulary operates positively or
negatively in many areas of your life. Have you
ever been humiliated by butchering the language
or fustrated at not being able to come up with
the right word? How did that affect you? How
did that affect you later in the day in other parts
of your life. Where you less confident? Did you
try to second guess yourself? Did you become
irritable? While a strong verbal advantage removes
obstacles and accelerates goal achievement, a
weak vocabulary handicaps and stymies. If you
cannot express ideas eloquently, if you hesitate
because of uncertainty about the right word, you
will appear less than competent and under-quali-
fied. Rewards, recognition, and promotion could
pass you by. Please remember, your vocabulary
already works for or against you one way or anoth-
er. Might as well have it work for you in as many
ways as possible.  Respectively, Gerald Schwartz

Or not be there.  Typically Maria & I are not even in the same physical

written together on a jet to SUNY-BUFFALO.

The drug here is an intrafusion of language, music & visual texture.
The addiction is finding ways to put the MeaningChunks together in such
a way that the SyllableMusic reveals new layer of TexTure.



>

You're trying too hard.  If you go to a concert & listen to
instrumental music are you listening & playing with the experience?  Or
are you trying to nail down the SingleBigIdea?

Me too.  Much PoMo stops too short of making deep ExtraHuman
connections.  The birds, the fungi, the cetaceans are telling us
something but we're too mummified by our usage of language to listen,
to understand.

Can't help you there, everyone brings something else to the table.
Very early on I became absorbed in Cage's approach to encountering a
work of art: to empty one's self of preconceptions, likes, dislikes,
aesthetic profiling & hear & see what exists apart from the habitual
judgments that flood our every moment.

Hope your digging yr tropical digs, we're in the middle of -40C with

From my reviewing days, the metric is: would go again even if I had to buy
my own ticket and go to the neighbouring city, to, wouldn't go again if the
tickets and taxi were free.

ok the cat may as well exit the bag  - this strange person called Richard
Taylor1 wrote the email about the Kabbalah - but Richard Taylor2 (as I have
confirmed in conversation) has no opinions either way on the Kabbala.
Richard Taylor1 says that he was a bit annoyed in that various people
misinterpreted not only the method and the madness -oops: but  the message
(he means going back to his original sortie about finding a book by a
certain David Meltzer and then seeing that David Meltzer was (had been
"posted" up ) on epc, and asking what people thought about D M, and no one
replying until  - in fact - R16 says - he sent the silly email about Bach
etc (but its NOT completely silly - Richard7 says it was brilliant - Richard
22 doesn't agree - he feels it was not good and Richard24 just shrugged his
shoulders) - - if there was one (they mean "a method"): in his ongoing saga
of discovering  a book  -   "Two-way Mirror" by David Meltzer: Richard1
maintains - please please - NO hierarchy is imposed by the enumerations of
the Richard Taylor's - ( I repeat NO hierarchy !!) that any view is valid
even an invalid one - he says he is up to page 131 of the book in question
when he rudely was interrupted by himself getting (or was it Richard 45?) a
little irate and naughty about hearing too much about kabbalas (over the
years) but he says he feels no feelings either for or against kabbalas...BUT
the sending of the email in question did in fact get some attention for some
of the Richards and this is pleasurable -  as it is or can be conceded
that - even if no "progress" as such is made - it is good that Richard or
some of the Richards get some attention and pleasure in this brief - all to
brief - sojourn in Mucksville ....

In fact on analysing The Bard's Enigma on page115 - with statements such as

  There is nothing truly hidden but what is not conceivable;
  There is nothing conceivable but what is immeasurable etc
 (There are further premises)

  The interesting conclusion (well it was interesting when he first derived
it - sometimes it's not so interesting - Richard11 avers it is totally
absurd - and other Richards were heard to mutter "drivel" "pff"! - "f- off!"
and  so on) was thus derived:

 eg if I let "nothing truly hidden" be H and let "not conceivable" be C and
let "immeasurable" be I etc he was able to use Carolingian (Lewis Carol's
logical method) Categorical logic the conclusion is that  - God can only
exist if he or it or she is conceivable AND God can only exist if God is
inconceivable - which is the Bard's Enigma - the paradox.  Earlier Meltzer
himself "rails" a bit against logic - prefers the words ontological and
phenomelogical to logical and so on - but the ensuing discussion on a page
117 on of the Pardes from the Torah  is fascinating -or interesting at
least -and leads to some great prose/poetry. And a good story.

Here is a great poem Richard Taylor5 wrote (>Age of birth by 4 - Modulo 48):

                                      Richard Taylor

Richard Taylor Richard Taylor Richard Taylor Richard Taylor Richard Taylor

Richard Taylor Richard Taylor Richard Taylor Richard Taylor Richard Taylor

                                     Richard Taylor

He says that it is on the greatest and most important subjects in the (or
his) Universe but it may not come out onto the List in the perfectly
rectangular form he so dearly desired.

"Good on ya mate". ( As/was/is said on the  ongoing Speights advert -on NZ
TV - Speights is a dark beer drunk in the South Island by "real men" -
actually also consumed in the North Island (by certain brave individuals)) -
I inhabit the North Island and am thus referred to by South Islanders - in
this I mean that they refer to themselves as Mainlanders - the reason
wherewith for by this being that the South Island is bigger than the North
Island)

I had that talk with Hall about oats also.  Here's the poem I wrote when
I went home somewhat agog to my apartment:

OATMEAL SONG

Give me an oatmeal bath
Come take an oatmeal bath with me
Oatmeal dry or wet
Oatmeal makes you free

Oatmeal
Oatmeal
Oatmeal
Oatmeal
Oatmeal

I will knit you an oatmeal sweater
I will knit you a sweater of oatmeal

When you go to college
I will knit you an oatmeal sweatshirt

I kid you not!
I kid you not!

[Chorus]

Oatmeal
Oatmeal
Oatmeal
Oatmeal
Oatmeal

We will live in an oatmeal land
I will read you oatmeal books
We will wallow in oatmeal baths
Oatmeal will be our bed

& when the time comes
To bury you, my love
I will bury you in oatmeal
In oatmeal I will bury you

Oatmeal
Oatmeal
Oatmeal
Oatmeal
Oatmeal

[Repeat chorus]

Come to the oatmeal gate
Down the winding oatmeal road
Come see the sun set in its oatmeal bowl
Come see the rise of the oatmeal moon
My love

Oatmeal!
Oatmeal!

how might one assume that Bach is "better" than Thelonious Monk...
strange revelation that argument might cause...I woke up this morning
and listened to Albert Ayler and washed it down with Beethoven, neither
"better" i.e., more sophisticated?

hey right on Steve Dalachinsky   I'm down  but weren't most of those
jazz
cats pretty high when they recorded that stuff?  so that's pretty high
art or maybe just medium high  (sort of mid level)  then the highest
art would be mountain chants or something, right? hard to breathe
though at highest elevations   whew

why do jazz arteests always get disrespect in America? misunderstanding
abounds in USA             high art low art

methinks deja view here in this argument   who could judge

excuse my typos please, thanks

inspired any mass killings or swords-point conversions.

Books

Many formulations at noemata are centered around books as a way of
capsulating works that otherwise might seem ephemeral, immaterial,
marginal, contextual, conceptual, having no outside. The notion of a
book is also abstracted to mean merely a set of documents containing its
ISBN number. In that sense they're networked books, net.books, with an
inverted form/content relation, as books turned inside-out. This is made
possible with networked, digital media especially, and is also a
(tauto-)logical consequence of operating with unique book numbers in
ISBN, ie. if a number defines a book then let a number define a book.
Read more at http://noemata.net/books

The books are also open-ended works with a communal, participatory basis
and released as copyleft if nothing else is stated. They're structured
as mailinglists, blogs, web archives, folders, programs, etc, in
different files and formats. Formats are chosen for readability and easy
access. ASCII text-files are when possible also made compatible with
unix mbox format (mail-format) and can thereby be imported into a mail
client and read as mail. Below is a list of entrance points to some of
the open books at noemata.

Oatmeal? I rarely sing about my morning bowl.
I regularly feel guilty about spilling oatmeal in the grocery -
Out of the plastic scoop on to the floor. Somebody has to
Sweep up after me. A customer might fall and bruise their butt,
Elbow, whatever. Actually I feel potentially criminal without never (yet!)
Getting caught. In a rush, though I want Organic & the one you have to cook
the longest - 20 minutes, Irish vintage! - honestly, whatever it is, I still
cook it for little more than a minute. Of course, the big issues revolve
around the boredom of oatmeal. That is how to slaughter the bland stuff
-this stuff no doubt our attendants will later pour down our
geriatric throats while tied to our beds, toothless & not a sign or echo
Of a poem on the tongue. But, yes, slaughter I now do: skin & slice
bitter pippins or sweet fujis, throw in raisins, sliced bananas, brown
sugar, blackberry jam, blueberry yogurt, vanilla soy milk, each morning
I try each and every variation. Sometimes, just for blandishment -
when I am bored with the morning slaughter or depleted
Of each of my accoutrements, or as a reminder of what I've escaped,
I try a bowl of oatmeal plain impaled, barely visible under a pouring
of skim milk. One needs no further provocation to get back the grocery
to buy whatever will kill that terrible, tasteless boredom, to sweeten up,
To warm the morning, to provide this winter lift.


But Oatmeal shirts, pants, underwear, Mairead - Jeezus!
Isn't Hall & Oats a dumb, shellacky "top ten new country" band?
Nothing in their Oats for the last zillion years.

Dale Pendell is the author of Living with Barbarians, A Few Plant Poems, =
and
the acclaimed Pharmako trilogy, including Pharmako/Poeia: Plant Powers,
Poisons, & Herbcraft; Pharmako/Dynamis: Stimulating Plants; and
Pharmako/Gnosis (publication expected in 2005).

Allan Ginsberg described the first volume of the trilogy as "an epic =
poem on
plant humours, an abstruse alchemic treatise, an experiential narrative
jigsaw puzzle, a hip and learned wild-nature reference text, a comic =
paean
to cosmic consciousness, an ecological handbook, a dried-herb pastiche, =
a
countercultural encyclopedia of ancient fact and lore that cuts through =
the
present 'conservative' war-on-drugs psychobabble."

Terence McKenna wrote that "Dale Pendell reactivates the ancient =
connection
between the bardic poet and the shaman." His poetry has appeared in many
journals, and he was the founding editor of "KUKSU: Journal of =
Backcountry
Writing." He has led workshops on ethnobotany and ethnopoetics for the
Naropa Institute and the Botanical Preservation Corps, and has presented =
at
the Mind States conference. His performance group, Oracular Madness, =
most
recently appeared at Burning Man.

A software engineer as well as poet and student of ethnobotany, Pendell
recently noted that "one of the things I'm trying to do is trace Gnostic
wisdom tradition and higher spirituality through the western tradition. =
A
lot of my practice and background has been through Buddhism, and more =
the
vision quest, shamanistic religion, but I wanted to find a system of =
ideas
and to ground it in the western tradition also going through =
Alexandria."

Dear Stephen,

Oatmeal is an iconic substance in Ireland.  It's a long story.  Suffice
to say that my "Oatmeal Song" is only one of a huge body of songs on the
subject.  I was surprised to see Donald Hall so engaged with the
subject.   But then there's that wonderful poem of his, "Kicking the
Oatmeal."  And then that other wonderful poem  "A Supermarket in
California," to which your experience below surely relates.

The Irish Oatmeal "icon" - not unlike certain churches - has stuck itself up
wildly (well, that's probably not the word)  all over the breakfast tables
of America. Demographic studies probably would show families serving oatmeal
for breakfast have children of higher SAT scores that those of heavily
sugared cereals from General Mills.

But I should look at Donald Hall's poem. I don't see your connection between
my piece and AG in the Supermarket, tho I do appreciate the association!  I
wonder if Lorca - over there in the third aisle -  ever ate oatmeal? What a
thought! Not likely - mainly only among the Celts in Spain for a time?

I cannot even imagine Madonna eating oatmeal! No matter that Madonna might
be the Shirley Maclaine of the Kabala, I don't think she could ruin oatmeal,
icon or not. Oatmeal the great leveler!

Just in case you don't have/remember Stephen Dobyns take
on the subject--

Hal

Oatmeal Deluxe

This morning, because the snow swirled deep
around my house, I made oatmeal for breakfast.
At first it was runny so I added more oatmeal,
then it grew too thick so I added water.
Soon I had a lot of oatmeal. The radio
was playing Spanish music and I became
passionate: soon I had four pots of oatmeal.
I put them aside and started a new batch.
Soon I had eight pots. When the oatmeal cooled,
I began to roll it with my hands, making
small shapes: pigs and souvenir ashtrays. Then
I made a foot, then another, then a leg. Soon
I'd made a woman out of oatmeal with freckles
and a cute nose and hair made from brown sugar
and naked except for a necklace of raisins.
She was five feet long and when she grew harder
I could move her arms and legs without them
falling off. But I didn't touch her much--
she lay on the table--sometimes I'd touch her
with a spoon, sometimes I'd lick her in places
it wouldn't show. She looks like you, although
your hair is darker, but the smile is like yours,
and the eyes, although hers are closed. You say:
But what has this to do with me? And I should say:
I want to make more women out of Cream of Wheat.
But enough of such fantasy. You ask me
why I don't love you, why you can't
live with me. What can I tell you? If I
can make a woman out of oatmeal, my friend,
what trouble could I make for you, a woman?

Subject:      A neglected poet:  Benoy Majumdar
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable

Benoy Majumdar, an Indian poet who writes in Bengali, was born in 1934 an=
d
trained as an engineer and mathematician.   His poetry is characterized e=
ven
in translation by an immediately accessible appeal underlain by a conside=
rable
literary sophistication which.  Only a handful of his poems have been
published in English translation, primarily translated by Jyotirmoy Datta=
,
himself a distinguished poet.  These two lovely lyrics indicate Majumdar=E2=
=80=99s
mood and technique.

If you never come again, never blow through these steaming regions
like cooling drifts of the upper air, even that absence is an encounter.
Your absense is as of the blue rose
from the kingdom of flowers.  Who knows, some day
you may yet appear.  Maybe you have, only you are too close.
Can I smell my own hair?  =

Marvellous sights have been seen.
A full moon was to have risen last night --
only a quivering sickle appeared!
It was an eclipse.

                           -- translated by Jyotirmoy Datta

What is needed is a sudden turn
leaving the swift hand that plucks butterflies out of the air
gaping at a loss.
The others exist pale and ghostly as stars
brought to brief life by a total eclipse of the sun.
But I cannot change my course now; can the leopard
unspin its leap in midair?
Moreover, they may still be wrong.  She can yet appear.
Cream rises only if one lets boinling milk stand and cool.

                           -- translated by Jyotirmoy Datta

One of Majumdar's translators has said that his poetry "combines sensuali=
ty
with intellectual complexity and projects a sense of aesthetic refinement=
=2E"  A
fair enough assessment, but I find myself groping to explain their deeper=

appeal. Part of it is that I perceive in these pieces some traits which I=

value greatly in poetry.  They are intensely and directly emotional witho=
ut
being sentimental, thus forming a welcome contrast to so much contemporar=
y
poetry which seems to eschew the direct expression of emotion out of a te=
rror
of falling into sentimentality.  They possess an undisguised songfulness =
which
I assume the translator has brought over from the original; again, this s=
eems
to me like a fresh breeze compared to the pedestrian tone of so much curr=
ent
poetry.  They have a quality of surprise in the language, the poet=E2=80=99=
s way of
speaking at right angles to the ordinary and thus making you say =E2=80=9C=
I never
knew you could do that with words.=E2=80=9D   I think this quality is app=
arent in
the selections which I=E2=80=99ve just read; here are a couple more passa=
ges from
other of his poems where it is particularly striking:

The blue stone on my ring shimmers with unquenchable thirst.
I fear the day of my death will be one like this.

                      -- translated by Jyotirmoy Datta

Because in some distant age, you had an assassin
for enemy, you live like a rose encircled =

by thorns.  And I, like a letter gone astray,
have come to the wrong address.

                       -- translated by Ron D.  K.  Banerjee


A familiar mastery of tradition is one  mark of an excellent poet.  I can=
=E2=80=99t
speak with authority on the traditions of Bengali poetry: my only familia=
rity
with it comes the few English translations I have read.  But even from th=
at
limited experience it seems pretty clear what some of the major qualities=
 of =

both traditional and modern Bengali lyrics are: the use of exuberant imag=
es
from nature to express personal emotion, with the images often having a
lushness which contrasts poignantly with the sadness of the feelings they=
 are
used to express; a tone of seemingly  spontaneous songfulness used as a
vehicle for intellectually complicated ideas;  allusions to the love-stor=
ies
of the gods to illuminate the poet=E2=80=99s own situation; and motifs of=
 erotic
separation and longing which often are used as symbols for spiritual
deprivation.  Benoy Majumdar=E2=80=99s poetry seems to renew these tradit=
ional
characteristics by  recasting them into a modernistic, almost surrealist
poetic idiom

I haven=E2=80=99t paid much attention so far to the claimed intellectual =
complexity
of Benoy Majumdar=E2=80=99s work. Here is one poem which I think makes ex=
plicit some
of the paradoxes of the human condition  implicit in the other pieces I=E2=
=80=99ve
quoted:  that what we want most desperately is so deeply within us that w=
e
cannot find it, that as soon as we apprehend what we desire, it is gone, =
that
being born into reality is being expelled from the reality of forever int=
o the
delusion of now:

The pain remained with me a long time.
Finally the ancient root was cut --
from immersion I emerged blinking into light.
I am restored to health now though the season is gray.
Surgery everywhere; this tea table was once the flesh of a tree.

I have given up strewing grain on the ground
to have the birds join me at lunch.
Only when the baby is cut adrift
does it have its free hunger and thirst;
like taking off a blindfold to be confronted with =

a curtain, being born
into this vast uterus, lined with a sky porous with stars.

                        -- translated by Jyotirmoy Datta

All fans of www.unlikelystories.org are now required to give respect,
homage, and mad props to Danielle Grilli, our new Multimedia Director.
Danielle, who until recently served as Poetry Editor of the Muse
Apprentice Guild ( www.muse-apprentice-guild.com ), will be selecting
our music, movies, and visual art from this point forth. She will also
consider CDs and films for review. You can reach her at
danielle@unlikelystories.org (though art@unlikelystories.org and
music@unlikelystories.org will still work).

If you had outstanding submissions to our art and music departments, she
should already have them. Please, as always, wait at least five weeks to
query.

That's for her, anyway. I'm way behind. Sorry. Don't even query me
regarding text submissions until February, OK? I know I'm running late.

You can learn more about Danielle by clicking on MISSION/SUBMISSIONS,
and then on her name. Afterwards, check out the new update, complete with:

"From Liberty Cabbage to Freedom Fries," in which Matthew Flaming
discusses the circumstances in which an American leftist might consider war

Now this is really splendid.  If these rankings become generally accepted=
,
they will prove extremely useful in all sorts of ways.

This usefulness would be enhanced if the literary community would agree o=
n a
common way to apply the rankings to individual poets.  I suggest the
following:

There are by my count 289 journals on the list. I propose that we assign =
each
journal a number based on this rank, from 289 for The Atlantic Monthly, t=
he
top ranked journal, to 1 for Wisconsin Review, which is last in line.  Th=
en
any individual poet could be assigned a number -- call it the Verse
Acceptability Prestige Denominator -- calculated by multiplying the numbe=
r of
pages of verse which that poet has published in each magazine by the
magazine's rank, and adding them together.

As an example, let us consider moderately successful hypothetical poet na=
med
Wentworth Windsor, who has published 3 pages in Ploughshares (rank 281,) =
 1
page in Kenyon Review (278,)  7 pages in Field (267,) 6 pages in Missouri=

Review (219,)  4 in Dark Horse (176,) and 2 in Clark Street Review (10.) =
 If
I've calculated correctly (I was never good at math,) Mr. Windsor would h=
ave
quite respectable VAPD of 5028.

VAPD scores could be discreetly listed on business cards, resumes, cover
letters for submissions, job and grant applications, and even on name tag=
s
worn by poets at workshops, readings, seminars, and MLA conventions. The
resulting efficiencies would, if it be not immodest thus to praise my own=

proposal, be mind-boggling.  For instance, schools hiring new faculty or
writers in residence, as well as committees handing out grants, would fin=
d
their deliberations very much shorter and easier:  all they would need to=
 do
is look at candidate's VAPD scores, and their choice would be clear. =

Likewise, editors could simply set a cut-off VAPD point for contributors,=

below which they would not accept any submissions, and above which they w=
ould
accept any, space permitting -- a procedure which would save both editors=
 and
contributors a huge amount of time.

The presence of VAPD numbers on name tags at literary and academic gather=
ings
would be enable participants to use their time at such functions much mor=
e
effectively.  A glance at a new acquaintance's name tag would tell you by=
 the
VAPD displayed there just how much time you should spend conversing with =
that
person, how hard you should laugh at that person's jokes, and how readily=
 you
should respond to that person's suggestion to get together for a drink or=
 some
more vigorously sociable activity.  VAPD scores could also be used to
determine the relative times allocated to poets at readings, and even the=

order of seating at literary society dinners.

Some people will no doubt object that such innovations would be artificia=
l and
arbitrary, but in fact they would be no more or less so than the present =
way
of doing things.  The use of VAPD scores would not in any way change the
standards people currently apply to the situations mentioned above; it wo=
uld
merely enable everyone to apply those standards more easily and confident=
ly
than is currently the case.

Subject: Re: and the Kabbala

ok the cat may as well exit the bag  - this strange person called Richard
Taylor1 wrote the email about the Kabbalah - but Richard Taylor2 (as I have
confirmed in conversation) has no opinions either way on the Kabbala.
Richard Taylor1 says that he was a bit annoyed in that various people
misinterpreted not only the method and the madness -oops: but  the message
(he means going back to his original sortie about finding a book by a
certain David Meltzer and then seeing that David Meltzer was (had been
"posted" up ) on epc, and asking what people thought about D M, and no one
replying until  - in fact - R16 says - he sent the silly email about Bach
etc (but its NOT completely silly - Richard7 says it was brilliant - Richar=
d
22 doesn't agree - he feels it was not good and Richard24 just shrugged his
shoulders) - - if there was one (they mean "a method"): in his ongoing saga
of discovering  a book  -   "Two-way Mirror" by David Meltzer: Richard1
maintains - please please - NO hierarchy is imposed by the enumerations of
the Richard Taylor's - ( I repeat NO hierarchy !!) that any view is valid
even an invalid one - he says he is up to page 131 of the book in question
when he rudely was interrupted by himself getting (or was it Richard 45?) a
little irate and naughty about hearing too much about kabbalas (over the
years) but he says he feels no feelings either for or against kabbalas...BU=
T
the sending of the email in question did in fact get some attention for som=
e
of the Richards and this is pleasurable -  as it is or can be conceded
that - even if no "progress" as such is made - it is good that Richard or
some of the Richards get some attention and pleasure in this brief - all to
brief - sojourn in Mucksville ....

In fact on analysing The Bard's Enigma on page115 - with statements such as

  There is nothing truly hidden but what is not conceivable;
  There is nothing conceivable but what is immeasurable etc
 (There are further premises)

  The interesting conclusion (well it was interesting when he first derived
it - sometimes it's not so interesting - Richard11 avers it is totally
absurd - and other Richards were heard to mutter "drivel" "pff"! - "f- off!=
"
and  so on) was thus derived:

 eg if I let "nothing truly hidden" be H and let "not conceivable" be C and
let "immeasurable" be I etc he was able to use Carolingian (Lewis Carol's
logical method) Categorical logic the conclusion is that  - God can only
exist if he or it or she is conceivable AND God can only exist if God is
inconceivable - which is the Bard's Enigma - the paradox.  Earlier Meltzer
himself "rails" a bit against logic - prefers the words ontological and
phenomelogical to logical and so on - but the ensuing discussion on a page
117 on of the Pardes from the Torah  is fascinating -or interesting at
least -and leads to some great prose/poetry. And a good story.

Here is a great poem Richard Taylor5 wrote (>Age of birth by 4 - Modulo 48)=
:

                                      Richard Taylor

rectangular form he so dearly desired.

I had that talk with Hall about oats also.  Here's the poem I wrote when
I went home somewhat agog to my apartment:

OATMEAL SONG

Give me an oatmeal bath
Come take an oatmeal bath with me
Oatmeal dry or wet
Oatmeal makes you free

Oatmeal
Oatmeal
Oatmeal
Oatmeal
Oatmeal

I will knit you an oatmeal sweater
I will knit you a sweater of oatmeal

When you go to college
I will knit you an oatmeal sweatshirt

I kid you not!
I kid you not!

[Chorus]

Oatmeal
Oatmeal
Oatmeal
Oatmeal
Oatmeal

We will live in an oatmeal land
I will read you oatmeal books
We will wallow in oatmeal baths
Oatmeal will be our bed

& when the time comes
To bury you, my love
I will bury you in oatmeal
In oatmeal I will bury you

Oatmeal
Oatmeal
Oatmeal
Oatmeal
Oatmeal

[Repeat chorus]

Come to the oatmeal gate
Down the winding oatmeal road
Come see the sun set in its oatmeal bowl
Come see the rise of the oatmeal moon
My love

Oatmeal!
Oatmeal!

how might one assume that Bach is "better" than Thelonious Monk...
strange revelation that argument might cause...I woke up this morning
and listened to Albert Ayler and washed it down with Beethoven, neither
"better" i.e., more sophisticated?

hey right on Steve Dalachinsky   I'm down  but weren't most of those
jazz
cats pretty high when they recorded that stuff?  so that's pretty high
art or maybe just medium high  (sort of mid level)  then the highest
art would be mountain chants or something, right? hard to breathe
though at highest elevations   whew

why do jazz arteests always get disrespect in America? misunderstanding
abounds in USA             high art low art

methinks deja view here in this argument   who could judge

Books

Many formulations at noemata are centered around books as a way of
capsulating works that otherwise might seem ephemeral, immaterial,
marginal, contextual, conceptual, having no outside. The notion of a
book is also abstracted to mean merely a set of documents containing its
ISBN number. In that sense they're networked books, net.books, with an
inverted form/content relation, as books turned inside-out. This is made
possible with networked, digital media especially, and is also a
(tauto-)logical consequence of operating with unique book numbers in
ISBN, ie. if a number defines a book then let a number define a book.
Read more at http://noemata.net/books

The books are also open-ended works with a communal, participatory basis
and released as copyleft if nothing else is stated. They're structured
as mailinglists, blogs, web archives, folders, programs, etc, in
different files and formats. Formats are chosen for readability and easy
access. ASCII text-files are when possible also made compatible with
unix mbox format (mail-format) and can thereby be imported into a mail
client and read as mail. Below is a list of entrance points to some of
the open books at noemata.

Subject: Re: a little help? Oatmeal!

Oatmeal? I rarely sing about my morning bowl.
I regularly feel guilty about spilling oatmeal in the grocery -
Out of the plastic scoop on to the floor. Somebody has to
Sweep up after me. A customer might fall and bruise their butt,
Elbow, whatever. Actually I feel potentially criminal without never (yet!)
Getting caught. In a rush, though I want Organic & the one you have to cook
the longest - 20 minutes, Irish vintage! - honestly, whatever it is, I stil=
l
cook it for little more than a minute. Of course, the big issues revolve
around the boredom of oatmeal. That is how to slaughter the bland stuff
-this stuff no doubt our attendants will later pour down our
geriatric throats while tied to our beds, toothless & not a sign or echo
Of a poem on the tongue. But, yes, slaughter I now do: skin & slice
bitter pippins or sweet fujis, throw in raisins, sliced bananas, brown
sugar, blackberry jam, blueberry yogurt, vanilla soy milk, each morning
I try each and every variation. Sometimes, just for blandishment -
when I am bored with the morning slaughter or depleted
Of each of my accoutrements, or as a reminder of what I've escaped,
I try a bowl of oatmeal plain impaled, barely visible under a pouring
of skim milk. One needs no further provocation to get back the grocery
to buy whatever will kill that terrible, tasteless boredom, to sweeten up,
To warm the morning, to provide this winter lift.


But Oatmeal shirts, pants, underwear, Mairead - Jeezus!
Isn't Hall & Oats a dumb, shellacky "top ten new country" band?
Nothing in their Oats for the last zillion years.

Dale Pendell is the author of Living with Barbarians, A Few Plant Poems, =
=3D
and
the acclaimed Pharmako trilogy, including Pharmako/Poeia: Plant Powers,
Poisons, & Herbcraft; Pharmako/Dynamis: Stimulating Plants; and
Pharmako/Gnosis (publication expected in 2005).

Allan Ginsberg described the first volume of the trilogy as "an epic =3D
poem on
plant humours, an abstruse alchemic treatise, an experiential narrative
jigsaw puzzle, a hip and learned wild-nature reference text, a comic =3D
paean
to cosmic consciousness, an ecological handbook, a dried-herb pastiche, =3D
a
countercultural encyclopedia of ancient fact and lore that cuts through =3D
the
present 'conservative' war-on-drugs psychobabble."

Terence McKenna wrote that "Dale Pendell reactivates the ancient =3D
connection
between the bardic poet and the shaman." His poetry has appeared in many
journals, and he was the founding editor of "KUKSU: Journal of =3D
Backcountry
Writing." He has led workshops on ethnobotany and ethnopoetics for the
Naropa Institute and the Botanical Preservation Corps, and has presented =
=3D
at
the Mind States conference. His performance group, Oracular Madness, =3D
most
recently appeared at Burning Man.

A software engineer as well as poet and student of ethnobotany, Pendell
recently noted that "one of the things I'm trying to do is trace Gnostic
wisdom tradition and higher spirituality through the western tradition. =3D
A
lot of my practice and background has been through Buddhism, and more =3D
the
vision quest, shamanistic religion, but I wanted to find a system of =3D
ideas
and to ground it in the western tradition also going through =3D
Alexandria."

WritingDubuffetsTitles is temporarily offline because shitwad hackers
blew it apart at the seems.  We need to install a new version of
phpWiki with version control.  I'll post when it's back up & going.
Also this project is the collective energies of about 15 people &
should probably be notated as such. & also also, the title
"WritingDuchampsTitles" is an alzheimers on my part & will eventually
be purged from the records.  Thanks Bjorn for providing the ISBN

Dear Stephen,

Oatmeal is an iconic substance in Ireland.  It's a long story.  Suffice
to say that my "Oatmeal Song" is only one of a huge body of songs on the
subject.  I was surprised to see Donald Hall so engaged with the
subject.   But then there's that wonderful poem of his, "Kicking the
Oatmeal."  And then that other wonderful poem  "A Supermarket in
California," to which your experience below surely relates.

Oh, Jon, you are so cynical.If  I am  poet in residence at
Brandeis, it's not for VAPD SCORES, it's just because someone, whom I didn't
know in any way shape
or form, happened to read my book and decided to ask if I'd like to visit. And
if I recently won a Lannan Literary Fellowship, it's not for VAPD SCORES, but
because someone else, whom
I didn't know in any way shape or form, happened to come across my work. I
don't know if you think things always work by VAPD SCORES, but they don't.
I wrote for three decades in a remote corner of NW New Mexico and knew no
one, and whatever came to me came just like this, someone unknown
happening to read my work somewhere, and I don't think I'm the only one.

Best,

Rebecca

I apologize for the confusion & my bad spelling.
I should have said:

"I had a boring talk with Hall about Oates."

Thanks for the oatmeal poem. Here is a Oates poem.
As you can see, Oates must make one regular.

                          Private Eyes
                          By Joyce Carol Oates


                          In training, the whip must be used sparingly.
But it must be used.
                          ‚Äîhorse trainer's adage

                          At the practice track, when we owned a
Standard-bred pacer.
                          How happy we were, new young owners of a
Standard-bred pacer.
                          How happy to "own" an animal, and a
Standard-bred pacer!
                          How dazed by the pounding hooves, the black
bulbs of eyes
                          swinging past, shivering and whinnying like
the dream horse
                          is Fuseli's "The Nightmare."

                          We were happy then, not-knowing our future.
                          We were innocent then, and tenderly-loving.
                          We were not cruel, by design. Any more than
you.
                          (We are Americans and not of those crude folk
                          who eat horseflesh though we feed it to our
pets, later.)
                          At the practice track north of Clinton, New
Jersey.

                          * * *

                          At the practice track in Jersey in
sun-splotched June.
                          God! the happiness! we are pacers.
                          Our massive muscles fill our hides! we are
pacers.
                          Deep-chested, high-headed. Pricked-up ears.
                          Happiness is pounding the track‚Äîfast.
                          Happiness is hauling the go-cart‚Äîfast.
                          Fast fast fast as the heart propels the legs.
                          Fast as the track and the go-cart allow.
                          Always there's a track and always a go-cart!
                          Our hooves pound as if they would break the
very earth,
                          our joy's in our great hearts pump pumping
like fists.
                          Our happiness is in racing and not breaking
stride.
                          Our happiness is in racing, one against the
rest
                          in a ferocity of hooves, manes, tails, rolling
eyes.
                          So high-strung our trainers strap "shadow
rolls"
                          above our big moist noses so that (don't
laugh!)
                          our flying shadows on the track won't throw us
into a panic,
                          so we kill our runty drivers.

                          Lookit the little whip in the sumbitch's hand,

                          and that hand in a glove. Like a toy.

                          * * *

                          "What is that leather thing around that
horse's legs?"
                          "Ma'am, that's a hobble. It helps her keep her
stride."
                          "So she won't break loose?"
                          "She won't never break loose. It just helps
her keep
                          her stride."


Be well

 Take about 1 half a cup of oatmeal - and add it to a pot - add the same
 amount of water or milk and some salt if you wish - heat  - until it
"plops'
 like Rotorua (or if in the US like Yellowstone Park etc) - stir - watch -
 beware of your eyes - it might explopt out - then, when it begins to "plop"
or
 bubblle etc - decant  - clean the pot with cold water - as the resultant
 enmixture is very viscous (but not vicious) and hot water increases its
 viscosity - meanwhile decant (it doesn't decant well - it may have to be
 scooped or otherwise "persuaded out of the original pot in which it was
 conceived) the porridge - now a near life like grey-white mass, a
 porrigionous mix - for that it is  - into a desert plate: add yoghurt or
 milk and some strawberries or other fruit - I have strawberries these
 days  - and sugar or not sugar etc and eat. It is very good for the body
and
 so on - it is very nutritious and tasteful - but some people hate porridge.

who are "white" I suppose - but I the subject had not really arisen per se -
there are a number of very good Maori poets but to be honest not many of
them write the kind of stuff that would be very interesting on this List.
(Although I 'm starting to wonder about the intelligence quotient of some
people on this list ....) That isn't because they are "bad" poets it is a
stylistic thing - eg Hone Tuwhare - who I have met ( and he could be the
exception to the rule ) is linguistically inventive and certainly a major
poet but he  - well he himself would not be interested for example in
Language theory or any poetics - such as that enunciated by  Silliman,
Perelman, Heijinian, and Bernstein etc (all that gang - or Sondheim's crazy
talk of deconstruction, the kabala, and phenomenology) - I know the man
well enough - unlike a lot of poets in NZ I have worked  in a similar work
"field" as Hone - Hone Tuwhare was influenced by R AK Mason (A communist)
who my father knew - and in 1929 he worked at the Otahuhu railway
workshops  - and we swapped stories about the place as I worked there in
1968 - Hone is  a highly intelligent poet but would not be interested in
much "high theory"  - at poetry readings he is almost always pissed (drunk)
and so on - he like Mason is a communist - he was a welder and is self
taught - I used also to be socialist/fellow traveller  (and also often drunk
at readings)  -but check out 'Aotearoa's' - "main " magazine - the latest
Landfall and see a certain Philip Temple's discussion of him) (a letter in
reply to certain incidents that occurred at a public reading where Hone
was) - no another poet is Colquhoun - he is a doctor but his poetry - good
in its own way - is witty - but mainstream: the other Maori poet I have met
is Robert O'Sullivan who used the fact of his Maoriness to climb up the
academic ladder and get published but -ok its problematic when that happens
as its unclear if any "objective" evaluation of a writers work can be made -
is he published because they want fill the quota of Maori poets? - or is he
good? -and so on  - he seems a nice enough person - but as a European I
could write exactly the same poetry and receive a total neglect - this isn't
bitterness or racism it's fact -

Any way surely everyone knows I was talking silly buggers about jazz  and
"high art"- makes me wonder if a lot of people on here are not just
thickos - or madmen  - and every email I send  -with some rare (and good)
exceptions - is misinterpreted - I always find some creep slithers out like
this Chris Winkles moron and twists what I say - fires back with my words
misquoted and out of context and attacks me personally. There is a dangerous
group of cowardly lurkers who only talk if they feel they can demolish
someone - well I feel great - but they attack wrongly (deliberately I
think - waiting until I say something they can attack -so its interesting to
see how these vermin operate) - this negative responding to what I said
prompted my satirical piece about jazz etc - you'd think that in knocking
jazz and the kabala I was the Adolf Hitler of NZ - cant even joke about
these things !! What a lot of PO faces !!!  Its really a right wing
esponse  - closed minds  who are really right wingers posing as liberals.

People should have the guts to address me directly.

Hi Rebecca and Jon,

I agree that Jon comes out as an incredible cynic here, but I think he
is also indirectly criticizing some attitudes he opposes in his very
personal way. His mail made me smile, and unluckily this is the way it
goes in our little rolling down the hill world. The louder you scream
the better you are heard.

On the other hand, yours is a wonderful example and I hope that many
serious judges will be able to detect poets who are as valued as you
are by me.

Take care you both, Anny

Avid readers of the kabbala may find similarities... as did the
Neoplatonists in the 16th century... Jacob Beohme and Paracelsus...

Subject:      COURT GREEN: Call for (bout-rimes) poems
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=windows-1252; format=flowed
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

For the Spring 2006 issue of the new poetry annual COURT GREEN, we are
accepting submissions of bouts-rimés (“rhymed ends”).

As Ron Padgett says in his Handbook of Poetic Forms, “A bouts-rimés poem
is created by one person’s making up a list of rhymed words and giving
it to another person, who in turn writes the lines that end with those
rhymes, in the same order in which they were given.” Various sources
attribute the invention of bouts-rimés to the French poet Dulot in the
seventeenth century. In 1701, Etienne Mallemans wrote a collection of
sonnets whose rhymes were chosen by the Duchess of Maine. In the
mid-1800s, brothers William Michael Rossetti and Dante Gabriel Rossetti
experimented with bouts-rimés. In 1864, Alexandre Dumas curated a volume
of bouts-rimés composed by 350 French poets -- all with the same rhymes.

In the spirit of Dumas’s invitation, we are accepting submissions of
bouts-rimés sonnets written with the following end-rhymes (in the
following order):

June
stress
moon
obsess
snake
moot
cake
beaut
Garbo
play
hobo
day
rhinestone
cologne

All themes and subjects are welcome as long as your sonnet uses these
end-rhymes in the order they appear above.

Submissions of bouts-rimés sonnets for consideration in the dossier can
be sent through May 1, 2005: Tony Trigilio, COURT GREEN, English
Department, Columbia College Chicago, 600 South Michigan Avenue,
Chicago, IL, 60605. Email submissions are not accepted. Submissions
without a self-addressed, stamped envelope will not be returned.

COURT GREEN is a new, nationally distributed journal co-edited by
Arielle Greenberg, Tony Trigilio, and David Trinidad. Each issue will
have a Dossier on a special topic or theme. The first issue is out now
and features a Dossier on poetry on film, and includes poems by Ann
Lauterbach, Michael Burkard, Elizabeth Willis, Maxine Kumin, Mary
Szybist, Albert Goldbarth, Ron Padgett, Dodie Bellamy, Wayne Koestenbaum
and others. Issue #2 (out by April 2005) features a Dossier on Lorine
Niedecker.

Submissions of poetry for the regular section of the magazine are
welcome, in addition to Dossier submissions. If you would like to submit
poems for the regular section, our reading period is February 1-May 1 of
each year, to the same address above.

If questions come up, email me at ttrigilio@colum.edu. Thanks–

Best,
Tony

Thank you, Rebecca... David:  yes, his words put us
on the edge of our seats. As someone who wrote
political speeches (for three NYS Assembly
Speakers), I will say something that may make
many on this list cringe (in that it may seem to
 be overstating the obvious), but it's true: style and
semntics make up the substance of politics. Words
are face-saving veneers, artful diplomatic screens.
No one speaks directly. Relationships are built
on ambiguity. And so, as our president burnishes
his image as a Cowboy Churchill -- strident, di-
viding black and white and good and evil, tones
bounce around the bell jars across the board.

I guess I miss a president who knew what the
"definition of is is" when he meant it.

Cheers,
Gerald

The Cabbala aside, the term "Neoplatonist" is a
pistols-for-two-coffee-for-one term.

There were *no* Neoplatonists in the 16thC -- the term I think originated
with Thomas Taylor in England in the 19thC.

I say this with a degree of supressed venom as I once had a book turned-down
for publication, partly because I refused to compromise over this particular
terminological distinction.

There were other reasons (to be honest, it wasn't exactly an Essential
Book), but that was a factor ...

In the 16thC, Plotinus, Iamblichus et alia were seen as part of the Platonic
[sic!] tradition.

Steve, please allow my indulgence in exclaiming your effulgence. This is a
beautiful poem, and that it's escaped intelligence and ego, is simply the
nonsense of people who only think they understand poetry. I wouldn't think of
placing my words into its inviting spaces. MaryJo

i carried 15 notebooks on
my shoulders  today
what was left of 38
yrs of writing
(i lost  a few yrs when the ground began to  shift)
then i put them down

as i walked calmly back to my  room
i encountered 3 simple but significant questions

1. does anyone know which direction south  is?
2. do you know where the closest chinese take
out  is?
3. which way is Ave. A?

i answered then all.

I apologize for the confusion & my bad spelling.
I should have said:

"I had a boring talk with Hall about Oates."

Thanks for the oatmeal poem. Here is a Oates poem.
As you can see, Oates must make one regular.

                          Private Eyes
                          By Joyce Carol Oates


                          In training, the whip must be used sparingly.
But it must be used.
                          =82**horse trainer's adage

                          At the practice track, when we owned a
Standard-bred pacer.
                          How happy we were, new young owners of a
Standard-bred pacer.
                          How happy to "own" an animal, and a
Standard-bred pacer!
                          How dazed by the pounding hooves, the black
bulbs of eyes
                          swinging past, shivering and whinnying like
the dream horse
                          is Fuseli's "The Nightmare."

                          We were happy then, not-knowing our future.
                          We were innocent then, and tenderly-loving.
                          We were not cruel, by design. Any more than
you.
                          (We are Americans and not of those crude folk
                          who eat horseflesh though we feed it to our
pets, later.)
                          At the practice track north of Clinton, New
Jersey.

                          * * *

                          At the practice track in Jersey in
sun-splotched June.
                          God! the happiness! we are pacers.
                          Our massive muscles fill our hides! we are
pacers.
                          Deep-chested, high-headed. Pricked-up ears.
                          Happiness is pounding the track=82**fast.
                          Happiness is hauling the go-cart=82**fast.
                          Fast fast fast as the heart propels the legs.
                          Fast as the track and the go-cart allow.
                          Always there's a track and always a go-cart!
                          Our hooves pound as if they would break the
very earth,
                          our joy's in our great hearts pump pumping
like fists.
                          Our happiness is in racing and not breaking
stride.
                          Our happiness is in racing, one against the
rest
                          in a ferocity of hooves, manes, tails, rolling
eyes.
                          So high-strung our trainers strap "shadow
rolls"
                          above our big moist noses so that (don't
laugh!)
                          our flying shadows on the track won't throw us
into a panic,
                          so we kill our runty drivers.

                          Lookit the little whip in the sumbitch's hand,

                          and that hand in a glove. Like a toy.

                          * * *

                          "What is that leather thing around that
horse's legs?"
                          "Ma'am, that's a hobble. It helps her keep her
stride."
                          "So she won't break loose?"
                          "She won't never break loose. It just helps
her keep
                          her stride."


Be well

Panix - Public Access Networks Corporation
Panix victim of domain name hijacking
Status as of Sun Jan 16 17:50:40 EST 2005

Recovery from the panix.com domain name hijack is underway. The registrar in
Melbourne has reverted the domain back to us, and the global Internet registry
and domain name servers are now showing the correct information.

However, due to the distributed nature of the Internet domain name system, it
will take 4-24 more hours before the false data from the hijacking expires and
is discarded by the various name servers. Our customers and servers can be
reached by using the panix.net domain, as described below.

(old information left below for reference).


Panix's main domain name, panix.com, has been hijacked by parties unknown. The
ownership of panix.com was moved to a company in Australia, the actual DNS
records were moved to a company in the United Kingdom, and panix.com's mail has
been redirected to yet another company in Canada. Panix staff are currently
working around the clock to recover our domain, but this may take until Monday,
due to the time differences and difficulties in reaching responsible parties
over the weekend.

For most customers, accesses to Panix using the panix.com domain will not work
or will end up at a false site. Since the Internet domain name system is
distributed, some network providers still have the correct information in their
name servers, but this could change at any moment.

As a temporary workaround, you can use the panix.net domain in place of
panix.com. In other words, if you're trying to log onto "shell.panix.com" or
see your mail at "mail.panix.com," use "shell.panix.net" or "mail.panix.net"
instead. However, you should only change the names of hosts that you connect to
or your return address: the name you use to login to our mail servers,
username@panix.com, should stay the same.

Mail to username@panix.com is currently being redirected to the false site ,
and should be considered lost or compromised if it does not arrive in your
Panix mailbox. If you have online accounts that authenticate via email address,
you might wish to protect them against fraud by changing that address to your
username "@panix.net".
When contacting hosts that use SSL security (URLs that begin with "https"
rather than "http", or SSL-wrapped services such as secure SMTP, secure IMAP,
or secure POP), you will see a hostname error. The server will present a
certificate that says it is "something.panix.com", and your browser or mail
program, which expects to see "something.panix.net", will complain about the
mismatch. This is an expected consequence of using the "panix.net" workaround.
If you have urgent concerns that are not addressed by this message, you can
contact us by calling +1 (212) 741-4400, and pressing 0. (You may need to leave
a message for us, but we're checking frequently.) For less-than urgent
concerns, please write to us at staff@panix.net.



Panix, the oldest commercial Internet provider in New York, is dedicated to
providing stable and reliable Internet access, email, netnews and UNIX
computing services to the public. We started in 1989, before the advent of the
Internet, and we're still going strong.

Panix is a full-service ISP, offering World Wide Web hosting, Internet
connectivity of all kinds in the New York metro area (New York City, Long
Island, Westchester, Rockland County, and New Jersey), and National Dialup--
with dialup access in over 1100 locations in 49 states.

We also specialize in UNIX shell access, from anywhere on the Internet,
anywhere in the world.

Many of our users are still receiving variations of the Beagle virus we warned
about early in March. This is email that forges "From:" addresses so that they
appear to be from Panix, and include signatures like "The Panix.com Team" and
mentioning this web site.

These are forged and they're affecting ISPs around the globe, not just Panix.

We have made some additional information about these viruses available.

I should back up a little bit
I was trying to figure out from Donald
what, if any, animosity existed between the two
as on one of my eastward tours I ended up at
the Dodge poetry festival, where most of everybody
gets in caustic jabs about each other and I was
sitting near Joyce who, at the time, I did not know
also wrote poetry, and, in fact, would perform it later
so I was asking her fiction questions
when the announcer said
Donald Hall is our next reader.
So I said "Shouldn't we listen to him?"
"Honey," Oates crackled,
"He's not a Hall, more like a Foyer."

Be well

re the below quoted text

there is inevitable sense to all things sensible

to claim that something has or doesn't have sense is assuming a single
sense, which i assumed to be the intellect

= reductive
=blinders

boring = makes sense
interesting = wakes sense/s

i hope that makes sense

Joyce started off as a poet actually David, it's rather amazing in the
light of the consequent work in fiction though some would say the poetry
of the later fiction hands down beats the poetry of the earlier poetry
or that the later fiction dissolves into poetry though that implies
fiction has boundaries poetry doesn't.  What I'm surprised at is that
Joyce was at Dodge in the first place.  I didn't know he had visited
America.  That must have been after the trial.  Do you know Gogarty's
poem "After Reading Hall's 'Toy'" (sometimes called "Ringsend"): "I will
live in Ringsend with a red-headed whore, / And the fan-light gone in /
Where it lights Donald Hall's door," etc?  I suppose Hall could have
taken offense but doesn't seem to have, they were such jolly chaps the
old masters.  But I've often tried to find that poem of Hall's called
"Toy" -- do you know it?

what they have for their breakfast?  I remember the grand old days of
POETICS when people poured scorn and eviscerated one another.  These are
strange lost times.)

I should back up a little bit
I was trying to figure out from Donald
what, if any, animosity existed between the two
as on one of my eastward tours I ended up at
the Dodge poetry festival, where most of everybody
gets in caustic jabs about each other and I was
sitting near Joyce who, at the time, I did not know
also wrote poetry, and, in fact, would perform it later
so I was asking her fiction questions
when the announcer said
Donald Hall is our next reader.
So I said "Shouldn't we listen to him?"
"Honey," Oates crackled,
"He's not a Hall, more like a Foyer."

Be well

hey speaking of the atlantic monthly i'm mentioned a few times in the new
issue by francis davis a jazz critic  who wrote about matt shipp a "jazz"
pianist and friend of mine shit i forgot to share that until i saw it
mentioned in this ranking thing

hey there's a minor intro into the jazz world for a new zealander  ...bad
joke

tonight i saw a bad play based on one of the heaviest tragedies of all
time - MEDEA

oatmeal & cinnamon


medea fed her kids cinnamon
oatmeal  w/raisins
then stabbed them a few times
to make sure they were dead

jason had fleeced her of their love
betrayed her
abandoned her
& she took revenge

the oatmeal was instant
it was an instant rendering
of the great tragedy

i would not have liked to be in that
poison dress of fire
that jason's new bride wore
uch burnt flesh
a wedding gift from medea

anyway
the medea is the massage
as they used to
say
or was that message?

& one mechanical bride's
as good as the
next

what medea says
cannot be taught it can only
be inherited

i knew the kids who played her kids

they took their shirts off
willing
tho they both seemed
too old for the part

i like oatmeal

Probably quite a few on this list know a little bit of Gregory Whitehead's
work. He is an extrordinary audio artist. Ken Goldsmith has put together an
amazing selection of Whitehead's 1984-2004 audio works at
http://www.ubu.com/sound/whitehead.html (or
http://vispo.com/temp/whitehead.m3u if you have a PC). This is a lengthy
collection of 53 pieces. Some are excerpted, but most are complete. The
selection also includes some fascinating texts.

Whitehead launched his own site not too long ago at
http://gregorywhitehead.com ; this has quite a bit of audio work and writing
in it also.

I first heard his work in 85. A piece called "If a Voice Like, then What?"
appeared on an anthology called Tellus along with work by Susan Stone (from
KPFA in San Francisco) and Jay Allison, among others. It was clear that the
three of them (they're friends) were approaching literary radio in a new
way. They were cognizant of the media of recorded sound and radio. They
weren't importing debilitating presuppositions from print or 'radio drama'
or film, etc. Though Whitehead is familiar with those and other forms/media;
his background, before coming to audio work, was in theory and theatre.

Over the years, Whitehead has developed poetics of audio in his work and
writing about audio/radio that I continue to learn from. The cut is an
important characteristic of recorded sound; wounds are an important subject
in Whitehead's work: the two are profoundly related in his poetics.
Mortality and destruction are explored even into the realms of the tragic in
his work; formally, you'll note that some of his works proceed via sonic
destructions of many types. Which is an important part of what makes this
work both new and deeply affective: the congruence of form and subject in
Whitehead's work suggests a  poetics in which the characteristics of the
medium become ways of knowing and feeling. The characteristics of recorded
sound are transformed by the poet into profound literary devices. It's a
mature 'Writing on Air', which is the title of one of his early cassettes.

If you're old enough, you may recall that Joey

for the Boston Bruins in the middle 1950s,
wore an oatmeal mask until the regulation changes.

  The reason I am posting this is not to show off or anything but by =
putting it online -as Alan does with his projects - it will kind of =
force me to do something I keep procrastinating on this project - which =
had a kind of Zukofskian ambition - although I haven't  read all of 'A' =
but I liked the idea of his incorporating his family in that poem. Also =
I was also interested in Bach's method of recirculating his own stuff =
into The St. John's Passion. The idea is to have about 4  or 5 (or maybe =
much more) different strands or thematic areas - these I wanted to bring =
to gether and kind of deconstruct or compress into one form or the first =
things would be like the poem Eyelight and then it would end upas  the =
poem immediately below  - which is only a sketch really  eg  - note some =
of the lines like Susan Howe's or Olson in some of their works are on an =
angle (but I cant do tat   - I don't know how to do it on a computer ) I =
also was going to incorporate visual art of my own): so the final form =
(but there is no final thing as Eyelight is kind of progressive or =
processional) -  (I haven't done the whole page but the phrases come =
from Books A1 A2 B1 to F etc - each of these having different theme eg =
one is labelled "personal"  and hence I have below Victor in there - he =
is my son and lost his eye to a baton strike by the NZ police in 1990 =
but eyelight itself is from another poem so eyelight is about vision in =
the wider sense also about mystery and so on - so its is about what I =
know - or think I know and what I am learning and what I will never =
know:=20

  The above is a sample of my method - so some of the things in tis =
"final " thigh come from eg 1) poems I have written of a more oracular =
or normative style (or what you will) 2) Science 3) Things about origins =
-hence things from science and about NZ early history etc and also about =
place 4) The personal 4) Questions about God  (although as Michael =
Morrissey (and I imagine many others do I change God to Dog to some how =
take away the connotations of the word -its all powerful- its domination =
in the language I suppose)and origins (again)  eg "where did the first =
people come from" is something my daughter used to get quite frantic =
asking me - as  young father I couldn't answer - the question frightened =
me - still does. 5) Problems of sanity - I saw Oliver Sachs on TV and =
read one of his books - the tone of his documentaries had an enormous =
impact on me  -in fact the very tone (his facial expressions  etc) and =
way of his speaking and presenting what he did -and the information - =
but I was interested in a semi -paranoid atmosphere it created in me - =
which lead to some poems I wrote - arts of which are recirculated - I =
have a lot more including things about Art; things to do with music; =
science; technology (I was a technician);  and so on - potentially there =
is no limit and much interlinks - I also have a "random section" of =
found texts etc and or where I just "scribbled" anything I wanted (I'm =
too good at that hence my desire to do a kind of structured project!) - =
all of this is rebuilt with the formal poems such  as Eyelight beginning =
the work and it transforming then to a new  "formal poem and so on - so =
that it kind of "pumps" - history is in there -although I don't have the =
knowledge of or understanding of an Olson or a  Pound -also I had WCW's =
Paterson in mind -   (This poem starts the project). =20

  Our task is: never to waver, to neither look right nor left:

  and indeed as I know you are thinking, there are certain uncertainties

                    whose monstrous beauty is almost nearly tiresome:

  why couldnt it get in control? Why wernt we informed immediately?

  but nothing is ever perfect as you've probably noticed. Matter

  and fire for example are surely forever at war. =20

  =20

  The special thing that burns in the eye: they are in conflict.

  Eternal. The usual thing: Dog has set up a conflict, a complex:

  a complex conflict like a five volume analysis of Finnegan's Wake.

  The Joycean, the Miltonic thing: which ever turns you on or out.

  =20

       nothing is connected - somehow.

  An enormous luminosity grew between her eyes and we were dumfounded: =
forgetting what was origin, orange, apple, or

  where the serpent had parked the sedan beside the spreading sneer of =
the evening's trees who were lush and unapproachable in the growing and =
licentious gloom whose possibilities mean so much, especially to the few

  in the know. So I stand outside in derided non-decision, forever=20

  a pastel perhaps: struggling to at least reach the status of a =
syllable, or even a new word. Or had you noticed. Lets go inside...I =
have things to discuss...

I kow ther is a lot of jiving going on about oats and Joyce Carol Oates =
- I am quite a fan of her short stories and some of her novels - never =
read her poems  - one of the best novels I ever read was "Bellefleur" by =
Joyce Carol Oates.  Her is a poem I did when I kind of "started back" =
intopoetry and I rad abookon "creative writing " about basically how to =
generate ideas in writing poetry: and metods to adopt etc -practices - =
they were good - - Dylan Thomas's poem was discussed  - starting, I =
think   "This bread I break ... " so with that poem in mind I wrote this =
- I'm getting my poems onto my PC and soon for the record so as I do I =
might sened some of the ones I think reasonable - this was written about =

This bread I eat

Enters me, is softened in my mouth,

Made a bolus,

Travels down

And is cut by acid in my stomach.

Then by life magic

It enters my most un-Christ-like blood -

And in snipped up molecules, crosses membranes down

And diffuses in my cells.

And I am Man

Bread eating man.

Kneaded by human hands, needed.

Xmas

Down Fifth Avenue in a taxi,
2 weeks before Xmas,
                                    my heart is
gone,     gone away,
                                 far away
                                                There are
stars, lights, illuminated
frosting all over the fronts of
buildings,
                everything is
an offering
                    (  for us,   to buy   )
But even alone now,
                                 a rising excitement
possesses me,
                         exhilaration,
warmth   & I can remember when it was
all celebration for us,
                                 both of us Jewish
but an excitement possessed us,
                                                  those years
of your health,
                               years of our striding
about the city together
                                   choosing,
thinking: a gift for this one or that one
                                   & you spent hours
inventing red & green scribbles
to cover your cards with:
                                        declarations [of]
love & joy in friendship
                                     & branches
of green & holly were hung in the house
                                     & what
I miss now,            the sound of your voice
                                 your laughter

                                           [love from Hilda
                                            December 25, 1982]


Note: A day or two ago, Lynda and I visited (once
again) the Strand, over on Broadway and came home
lugging books. In one of mine (*Ironwood* 20, found
on one of the outdoor $1 shelves and purchased to
replace my long-lost copy) was a twice-folded sheet
of 8 1/2 x 11 paper upon which the poem above was
typed, the bracketed portions written in in ink. At the
top center of the page is a piece of scotch tape that
looks like it may have been used to hang the poem up
somewhere, since there's nothing at the bottom of the
page to suggest it was used as a seal. At the bottom
left of the inside cover of the magazine, written in ink,
is "Christmas 1982" over "NYC," and in the right-
hand bottom corner the name Judy Epstein.

I don't know if this poem was ever published, but it
might be one of a series of elegies Morley wrote for
her husband Stefan Wolpe, who had died in 1972.
Any information would be appreciated.

    The reason I am posting this is not to show off or anything but by =
putting it online -as Alan does with his projects - it will kind of =
force me to do something I keep procrastinating on this project - which =
had a kind of Zukofskian ambition - although I haven't  read all of 'A' =
but I liked the idea of his incorporating his family in that poem. Also =
I was also interested in Bach's method of recirculating his own stuff =
into The St. John's Passion. The idea is to have about 4  or 5 (or maybe =
much more) different strands or thematic areas - these I wanted to bring =
to gether and kind of deconstruct or compress into one form or the first =
things would be like the poem Eyelight and then it would end upas  the =
poem immediately below  - which is only a sketch really  eg  - note some =
of the lines like Susan Howe's or Olson in some of their works are on an =
angle (but I cant do tat   - I don't know how to do it on a computer ) I =
also was going to incorporate visual art of my own): so the final form =
(but there is no final thing as Eyelight is kind of progressive or =
processional) -  (I haven't done the whole page but the phrases come =
from Books A1 A2 B1 to F etc - each of these having different theme eg =
one is labelled "personal"  and hence I have below Victor in there - he =
is my son and lost his eye to a baton strike by the NZ police in 1990 =
but eyelight itself is from another poem so eyelight is about vision in =
the wider sense also about mystery and so on - so its is about what I =
know - or think I know and what I am learning and what I will never =
know:=20

    The above is a sample of my method - so some of the things in tis =
"final " thigh come from eg 1) poems I have written of a more oracular =
or normative style (or what you will) 2) Science 3) Things about origins =
-hence things from science and about NZ early history etc and also about =
place 4) The personal 4) Questions about God  (although as Michael =
Morrissey (and I imagine many others do I change God to Dog to some how =
take away the connotations of the word -its all powerful- its domination =
in the language I suppose)and origins (again)  eg "where did the first =
people come from" is something my daughter used to get quite frantic =
asking me - as  young father I couldn't answer - the question frightened =
me - still does. 5) Problems of sanity - I saw Oliver Sachs on TV and =
read one of his books - the tone of his documentaries had an enormous =
impact on me  -in fact the very tone (his facial expressions  etc) and =
way of his speaking and presenting what he did -and the information - =
but I was interested in a semi -paranoid atmosphere it created in me - =
which lead to some poems I wrote - arts of which are recirculated - I =
have a lot more including things about Art; things to do with music; =
science; technology (I was a technician);  and so on - potentially there =
is no limit and much interlinks - I also have a "random section" of =
found texts etc and or where I just "scribbled" anything I wanted (I'm =
too good at that hence my desire to do a kind of structured project!) - =
all of this is rebuilt with the formal poems such  as Eyelight beginning =
the work and it transforming then to a new  "formal poem and so on - so =
that it kind of "pumps" - history is in there -although I don't have the =
knowledge of or understanding of an Olson or a  Pound -also I had WCW's =
Paterson in mind -   (This poem starts the project). =20

    Our task is: never to waver, to neither look right nor left:

    and indeed as I know you are thinking, there are certain =
uncertainties

                      whose monstrous beauty is almost nearly tiresome:

    Why couldnt the matter: the deep stuff in the dark spring of things:

    There has to be an inquiry of course. What was the matter with=20

    the matter? Could I tell you? That it kept throwing molds, kept

    re-shaping - kept touching the clay and rebreeding life and so on:

    but nothing is ever perfect as you've probably noticed. Matter

    and fire for example are surely forever at war. =20

    =20

    The special thing that burns in the eye: they are in conflict.

    Eternal. The usual thing: Dog has set up a conflict, a complex:

    a complex conflict like a five volume analysis of Finnegan's Wake.

    The Joycean, the Miltonic thing: which ever turns you on or out.

    =20

         nothing is connected - somehow.

    =20

    An enormous luminosity grew between her eyes and we were dumfounded: =
forgetting what was origin, orange, apple, or

    where the serpent had parked the sedan beside the spreading sneer of =
the evening's trees who were lush and unapproachable in the growing and =
licentious gloom whose possibilities mean so much, especially to the few

    in the know. So I stand outside in derided non-decision, forever=20

    a pastel perhaps: struggling to at least reach the status of a =
syllable, or even a new word. Or had you noticed. Lets go inside...I =
have things to discuss...

Sort of a ballad


Davy Crockett's
lost in the woods
with a pig in a poke
and a bill of goods;
he went out hunting
for the Cisco Kid
and ended up ashamed
of whatever he did.

        Baby, baby,
        beat my heart,
        snap its strings
        and make it smart;
        New York City's
        floating in air:
        is it always this way
        everywhere?

Baby Face Nelson
and Abraham Lincoln
went into the bar
and came out stinkin',
and Rip Van Winkle
has a new disguise:
a riverboat gambler
with a pack of lies.

        Mama, mama,
        lift my basket:
        looks like Chicago's
        blown a gasket.
        All these people
        would be better off dead
        than trying to live
        on the devil's bread.

There's plague back east
and dust out west,
floods down south
and the north's depressed;
the cargo's vanished,
the wheels are gone:
this wagon's broke
and we won't see dawn.

        Father, father,
        shoot my wad,
        crack my whip
        and bust my sod:
        San Francisco
        fell into the sea,
        but nobody noticed
        except for me.

Dear  friends,

If anyone knows of a journal that is currently seeking short poems, I have
about 20 that need a home. These are 1-6 line poems that are worthy of any
self-respecting journal that publishes edgier or less predictable work.

I'm not quite sure how to submit them.  I have tried sprinkling a few of
them in with longer poems in a standard submission --- a sort of baby's
breath in the bouquet --- but editors have grabbed the longer poems without
paying attention to them.  I have tried sending them out as a group, but
they have not been accepted.  I conclude that there is a bias against tiny
poems.

Any suggestions welcome; please backchannel:  Aaron@belz.net

Thanks,
Aaron

Do you know Robertson Davies' mock system for rating female beauty?

If Helen of Troy had a face that launched a thousand ships, then a
standard unit can be established that ranks how many ships a certain face
is able to launch. The unit is the milli-Helen (mH) and Helen of course
rates 1000mH.

I would like to see other stats for poets too. Like baseball cards. What
stats would we track? It'd be helpful in giving play-by-play of poetry
readings, a new service that the CBC is considering for their live poetry
broadcasts.

Actually, if folks could frontchannel this info -- I know a number of people with the same
dilemma.

Aught had a recent issue on very short poems.

Write each one out on a tiny slip of paper (no larger than 3 x 5"), and then
get drunk with a friend and, after folding them into little boats, set them free
upon a stream or river of your choice.

This is a lovely story, Hal, about discovering the Hilda Moreley poem. I
have always been taken by the way the poem or novel may be brought either
freshly back into light, or first discovered, in contexts that are not
aligned with "where I usually do my reading." (Kitchen table, living room
table, or this often godforsaken iMac Monitor - where,ironically, it's a
delight to read the Hilda Morley poem and your note!). I suspect each of us
could write small histories of discovering poems in unexpected places. I
always hated reading novels in college - the pressures, etc. - and I was a
very slow reader. But I remember the great pleasure of reading Faulkner's
Light in August while hitchhiking around Crete in August of 1972. There were
probably 5 cars and 10 trucks on Crete then! Sitting on my backpack for long
periods in the August heat were entirely compatible with reading Faulkner's
prose. I will never forget it.
Or then, recently, finding a copy of William Carlos Williams' ND Selected
Shorter Poems on the street, apparently dumped, the acid-filled paper a
lunch bag brown, taking it home and reading it aloud in the kitchen to
Sandy, my partner, my voice felt like I was rescuing those wonderful poems
back from the dead.
When Momo's Press went out of business in the mid-eighties, and I had lots
of inventory, as some kind of odd, populist missionary, I would occasionally
place books on benches and ledges and sidewalks through out the City -
hoping that other folks might have a similar sense of surprise, taking joy
or some kind of mystery in reading a poem by someone, say, - Victor Cruz, or
Jessica Hagedorn or myself - of whom most had probably had never heard - as
such would still be true of 99% of those who write contemporary poems with
usually such small readerships, no matter intense our immediate communities
of attention.

Thanks again, Hal.

Has anybody seen the movie, Carter - about the coach - and his famous
disciplinary measures - of the Richmond (California) High basketball team?
I am about to go - with a little trepidation. I was the one of three white
guys on the Richmond High "Oilers" team in 1956-57-58. All of us were,
relatively, much better behaved than Carter's players. The issues of race
and class were unspoken, but very much in play.  I think the team in Carter
is all black (?) which puts a spin on it - that is, having the issues
revolve around disciplining black students in an all black circumstance
keeps the focus off black, white and other ethnic relationships which would
have to include the related issues of urban racism.

Not such a bad idea.  It certainly conceals identity - gives the impression

I saw this years ago in Soho when I first moved to New
York.  I absolutely loved it.  Now I'm very happy to
discover, they're re-doing it in Dumbo, Brooklyn, and
I will see it again, several more times, I hope.


If you're in NYC during February or March, you're in
luck!  House/Lights shows February 5 - 27, 2005 &
March 2 - April 10, 2005.


http://www.thewoostergroup.org/



The Wooster Group's HOUSE/LIGHTS, directed by
Elizabeth LeCompte, commingles Gertrude Stein's opera
libretto, Dr. Faustus Lights the Lights with Joseph
Mawra's 1960's B-film classic, "Olga's House of
Shame." HOUSE/LIGHTS toured throughout the world and
was last seen in New York at The Performing Garage in
1999. In his New York Times review, Ben Brantley wrote
"HOUSE/LIGHTS is a bedazzling theater piece from The
Wooster Group that turns disorientation into a primary
sensual pleasure even as it raises terrifying thoughts
about the deeply mixed blessings of technological
progress."



The OBIE and BESSIE award-winning production of
HOUSE/LIGHTS returns with the original cast, including
Wooster Group member Kate Valk as Faust and Suzzy
Roche of The Roches as The Devil. The Wooster Group
will present HOUSE/LIGHTS at St. Ann's Warehouse (38
Water Street) in the DUMBO neighborhood of Brooklyn.



Artists involved in HOUSE/LIGHTS include Geoff Abbas,
Philip Bussmann, John Collins, J. Reid Farrington, Roy
Faudree, Iver Findlay, Jim Findlay, Ari Fliakos, Clay
Hapaz, Elizabeth Jenyon, J.J. Johnson, Bozzy Karasu,
Elizabeth LeCompte, Margaret Mann, Gabe Maxon, Helen
Pickett, Suzzy Roche, Tanya Selvaratnam, Sheena See,
Natalie Thomas, Jennifer Tipton, Kate Valk, and Tara
Webb.



For reservations or information please call St. Ann's
Warehouse box-office at 718.254.8779. Tickets can also
be ordered online at www.ticketweb.com.

A lovely poem. I must have met Morley--I used to go to all of Wolpe's
concerts. Does anyone listen to his music anymore? He was probably the best
of the second-generation serialists.

the watcher of skies is always there
soaring so high in the ice-cold air
we go into her cage and live in her lair
her beak is so strong, her feathers so fair
to see such a sight is indeed now quite rare
my fingers ungloved, my skin was quite bare
she knew i was safe and handled with care
my life and my love, we made quite a pair
we have taken our memories far to pare
so we leave nothing for our new-found heir
although i give her food, a hare
she'll swallow, and oft-thanks and with ne'er
a murmur to deer or bear
or thought to try a shirt of hair
or something charming else to wear
for even a wager or sometimes a dare
with her feathers red-tipped, and her dinner fare
delightful and lovely, and delicious e'er
she whispers and waits for another ware

hello again,

I want to thank all of you that have taken the time to answer my hall and
bly (and oats / oates) question.  I will probably pop in again.  I
apologize for not responding to the list and the individual emails sooner
as I have limited email capacity. Your responses are very helpful to me and
much appreciated.  It's interesting to me to hear what folks feel and think
of this esp., from people who aren't in town here in the TC.

I like to add apple chunks and cinnamon and a little nutmeg to my oatmeal.
Chocolate works well, too.

best,
rebecca weaver

Thank you, Jon, for these. They are wonderful and informative and they make
me want to write some just like them. I have met Jyotti Datta a couple of
times. It's nice to see his name here.

Subject: A neglected poet: Benoy Majumdar

Benoy Majumdar, an Indian poet who writes in Bengali, was born in 1934 and
trained as an engineer and mathematician.   His poetry is characterized even
in translation by an immediately accessible appeal underlain by a
considerable
literary sophistication which.  Only a handful of his poems have been
published in English translation, primarily translated by Jyotirmoy Datta,
himself a distinguished poet.  These two lovely lyrics indicate Majumdar's
mood and technique.

If you never come again, never blow through these steaming regions
like cooling drifts of the upper air, even that absence is an encounter.
Your absense is as of the blue rose
from the kingdom of flowers.  Who knows, some day
you may yet appear.  Maybe you have, only you are too close.
Can I smell my own hair?
Marvellous sights have been seen.
A full moon was to have risen last night --
only a quivering sickle appeared!
It was an eclipse.

                           -- translated by Jyotirmoy Datta

What is needed is a sudden turn
leaving the swift hand that plucks butterflies out of the air
gaping at a loss.
The others exist pale and ghostly as stars
brought to brief life by a total eclipse of the sun.
But I cannot change my course now; can the leopard
unspin its leap in midair?
Moreover, they may still be wrong.  She can yet appear.
Cream rises only if one lets boinling milk stand and cool.

                           -- translated by Jyotirmoy Datta

One of Majumdar's translators has said that his poetry "combines sensuality
with intellectual complexity and projects a sense of aesthetic refinement."
A
fair enough assessment, but I find myself groping to explain their deeper
appeal. Part of it is that I perceive in these pieces some traits which I
value greatly in poetry.  They are intensely and directly emotional without
being sentimental, thus forming a welcome contrast to so much contemporary
poetry which seems to eschew the direct expression of emotion out of a
terror
of falling into sentimentality.  They possess an undisguised songfulness
which
I assume the translator has brought over from the original; again, this
seems
to me like a fresh breeze compared to the pedestrian tone of so much current
poetry.  They have a quality of surprise in the language, the poet's way of
speaking at right angles to the ordinary and thus making you say "I never
knew you could do that with words."   I think this quality is apparent in
the selections which I've just read; here are a couple more passages from
other of his poems where it is particularly striking:

The blue stone on my ring shimmers with unquenchable thirst.
I fear the day of my death will be one like this.

                      -- translated by Jyotirmoy Datta

Because in some distant age, you had an assassin
for enemy, you live like a rose encircled
by thorns.  And I, like a letter gone astray,
have come to the wrong address.

                       -- translated by Ron D.  K.  Banerjee


A familiar mastery of tradition is one  mark of an excellent poet.  I can't
speak with authority on the traditions of Bengali poetry: my only
familiarity
with it comes the few English translations I have read.  But even from that
limited experience it seems pretty clear what some of the major qualities of

both traditional and modern Bengali lyrics are: the use of exuberant images
from nature to express personal emotion, with the images often having a
lushness which contrasts poignantly with the sadness of the feelings they
are
used to express; a tone of seemingly  spontaneous songfulness used as a
vehicle for intellectually complicated ideas;  allusions to the love-stories
of the gods to illuminate the poet's own situation; and motifs of erotic
separation and longing which often are used as symbols for spiritual
deprivation.  Benoy Majumdar's poetry seems to renew these traditional
characteristics by  recasting them into a modernistic, almost surrealist
poetic idiom

I haven't paid much attention so far to the claimed intellectual complexity
of Benoy Majumdar's work. Here is one poem which I think makes explicit some
of the paradoxes of the human condition  implicit in the other pieces I've
quoted:  that what we want most desperately is so deeply within us that we
cannot find it, that as soon as we apprehend what we desire, it is gone,
that
being born into reality is being expelled from the reality of forever into
the
delusion of now:

The pain remained with me a long time.
Finally the ancient root was cut --
from immersion I emerged blinking into light.
I am restored to health now though the season is gray.
Surgery everywhere; this tea table was once the flesh of a tree.

I have given up strewing grain on the ground
to have the birds join me at lunch.
Only when the baby is cut adrift
does it have its free hunger and thirst;
like taking off a blindfold to be confronted with
a curtain, being born
into this vast uterus, lined with a sky porous with stars.

                        -- translated by Jyotirmoy Datta

Subject: short poems need home

Dear  friends,

If anyone knows of a journal that is currently seeking short poems, I have
about 20 that need a home. These are 1-6 line poems that are worthy of any
self-respecting journal that publishes edgier or less predictable work.

I'm not quite sure how to submit them.  I have tried sprinkling a few of
them in with longer poems in a standard submission --- a sort of baby's
breath in the bouquet --- but editors have grabbed the longer poems without
paying attention to them.  I have tried sending them out as a group, but
they have not been accepted.  I conclude that there is a bias against tiny
poems.

Any suggestions welcome; please backchannel:  Aaron@belz.net

Thanks,
Aaron

Poets House presents

Ron Padgett on Pierre Reverdy

Thursday, January 20, 7pm



New York, January 2005—Poets House, a nonprofit literary center devoted to

poetry, presents poet Ron Padgett speaking on the poetry of Pierre Reverdy

(1889-1960), a prolific poet and central figure of France’s avant-garde

artistic and literary circles from the 1910s to the early 1920s. The event

will be held on Thursday, January 20, at 7pm, at Poets House, 72 Spring

Street, 2nd Floor, between Broadway and Lafayette. Admission is $7 or free

for members.

Ron Padgett is the author of the poetry volumes You Never Know (2002), Poems

I Guess I Wrote (2001), New & Selected Poems (1995), The Big Something

(1990), Triangles in the Afternoon (1979), Great Balls of Fire (1969), and

other collections. His prose books include two memoirs, Joe: A Memoir of Joe

Brainard (2004) and Oklahoma Tough: My Father, King of the Bootleggers

(2003), as well as a volume of selected prose entitled Blood Work (1993),

and translations of Blaise Cendrars' Complete Poems (1992), Pierre Cabanne's

Dialogues with Marcel Duchamp (1971), and Guillaume Apollinaire's The Poet

Assassinated (1968), among others. For his translations Padgett has received

grants and awards from the National Endowment for the Arts, the New York

State Council on the Arts, and Columbia University's Translation Center. He

was the editor-in-chief of World Poets, a three-volume reference book

(2000).

Pierre Reverdy (1889-1960), a Cubist poet alongside Apollinaire and Max

Jacob, inspired the Surrealist movement and its leaders. He moved to Paris

in 1910 and founded the journal Nord-Sud (North-South) in 1917, and

published Apollinaire, Jacob, Aragon, Breton, Soupault, and Tzara in its

pages. In 1926 he left Paris and spent the rest of his life in Solesmes,

France. Reverdy wrote literary reviews in addition to his many poems, which

are available in English in Pierre Reverdy: Selected Poems (1991).

--- RECENT FEATURES ---


The Great Bear Pamphlets

UbuWeb is pleased to host the entire run of the legendary chapbooks produced by Something
Else? Press from 1965-1967. Long out-of-print and rarely seen, UbuWeb has reformatted all
twenty titles into new PDF editions. Featuring titles by: Allan Kaprow, Bengt af
Klintberg, David Antin, George Brecht, Philip Corner, Robert Filliou, Al Hansen, Dick
Higgins, Alison Knowles, Jackson Mac Low, Various Manifestos, Claes Oldenburg, Dieter
Roth, Jerome Rothenberg, Luigi Russolo, Wolf Vostell, Emmett Williams, The Zaj Group,
John Cage and others.


Gregory Whitehead: A 20 Year Survey

A comprehensive twenty-year survey of MP3s, comprised of 52 tracks, varying in length
from a few minutes to over an hour. Several of the pieces are heard here for the first
time; others were commissioned by the BBC, NPR and New American Radio; many are live
air-checks and full-length radio-plays. Also included in this survey are several pieces
of writing by Whitehad on the subject radio, ranging from interviews to manifestoes.


The Tape-beatles, Public Works, PhonoStatic Cassettes

UbuWeb announces the launch of the Public Works archive, consisting of digitial transfers
of dozens of cassettes, LPs, and CDs into MP3s. The Tape-beatles are a collaboration of
varying membership that make music and audio art recordings, "expanded cinema"
performances, videos, printed publications, and works in other media. They work under the
aegis of Public Works Productions. PhotoStatic was a magazine, a periodical series of
printed works, that focused on xerography (photocopy) as a creative medium. Founded in
1983, the title continued in some form until as late as 1998. A companion publication on
audio cassette was dubbed PhonoStatic, with the inaugural issue appearing in 1984. In
all, ten cassette issues were released at roughly six-month intervals, culminating with
the "Audio Collage" cassette in 1989. The complete PhonoStatic cassette archive is
available on UbuWeb.


The Dial-A-Poem Poets

The latest additions to UbuWeb's collection of legendary downtown New York LPs produced
in the 70s and 80s by John Giorno include: You're The Guy I Want To Share My Money With,
William S. Burroughs / John Giorno, A Diamond Hidden in the Mouth of a Corpse, and John
Giorno & Anne Waldman. Artists on these discs include: Laurie Anderson, John Giorno,
William S. Burroughs, Anne Waldman, HÃ¼sker DÃ¼, Cabaret Voltaire, David Johansen,
Diamanda Galas, Jessica Hagedorn, David van Tieghem, Coil, Michael Gira, and Sonic Youth.
(MP3)


Live To Air: Artist's Sound Works (1982)

"Live to Air" comprises an international compilation of artists' sound works. Forty-five
artists were invited to make a work for the context of Audio Arts Magazine with an
approximate duration of five minutes. Originally produced on three Dolby cassettes, this
out-of-print compilation includes artists such as Dan Graham, Vito Acconci, Barbara Ess,
Art & Language, Lawrence Weiner, Jack Goldstein, Dieter Roth, Tom Marioni, Les Levine and
Marina Abramovic and many others. Includes scans of original liner notes and artwork.


Yves Klein "Selected Writings, 1928-1962"

Originally published by the Tate Gallery in 1974, this collection of aphorisms, stories
and photographs documents the trajectory of a lifetime's worth of thought from the great
French conceptual artist. From the introduction: "Klein's work lends itself very well to
this mode of presentation. Although immensely varied in its means it seems to divide into
sections naturally and with unusual clarity as if it were the chapters of a book, each
chapter pressing home one particular point. This characteristic does not, of course, rob
Klein's art of subtlety, mystery or ambiguity-quite the reverse; it is perhaps the result
of his trenchant, often theatrical or ritualistic modes of expression. Certain of his
activities have, therefore, a quality which makes them at once memorable, mythical and
self-defining. At the same time they are all concerned with a single constellation of
ideas."


Andreas Ammer: Selection of HÃ¶rspiele, 1993-1999.

Originally produced for German radio (Westdeutscher Rundfunk, Bayerischer Rundfunk,
WDR3). Includes two collaborations with FM Einheit: Radio Inferno (1993) and Crashing
Aeorplanes and three collaborations with Console: Heimat & Technik Das Heidegger-Bootleg
(2000) The Official Olympic Bootleg (2000) and Bugs & Beats & Beasts (1999).


Gertrude Stein's "Geography and Plays"

In an ongoing celebration of the roughly 100th anniversary of Gertrude Stein's Geography
and Plays, softpalate (www.softpalate.org) has matched various sound artists (audio
artists, performance artists, soundtext artists, composers, radio producers, soundpoets,
DJ's, re-mix artists, turntablists, etc.) with texts from Geography and Plays. Included
here are the first five plays as realized by Warren Burt, John Wanzel, Students from
Bella Vista Elementary School and David Braden, and Fadladder. (MP3)

Artsounds

Rare out-of-print double LP from 1985 of artists' recordings. Includes tracks by Larry
Rivers, Marcel Duchamp, Connie Beckley, Cotten/Prince, Minneko Grimmer, Philemona
Williamson, Jeff Gordon, Tony McAulay, Jonathan Borofsky, Les Levine, Burton Van Deusen,
Tom Wesslemann, Marcy Brafman, Philip Johnson, John Burgee, Italo Scanga, Thomas
Lanigan-Schmidt, Bob Gruen, Yura Adams, and Jennifer Bartlett. Includes extensive liner
notes. (MP3)


Stephen Vitiello

"Collaborations and Unreleased MP3s" Stephen Vitiello is a composer of electronic music
and media artist. He works in mediums ranging between installation, internet, video,
film, dance and music for audio CD. Presented here are rare pieces and collaborations
with Pauline Oliveros, Joe McPhee, Tony Conrad, Yasunao Tone and Scanner.


People Like Us "Abridged Too Far" (2004)

For the first time, UK-based People Like Us (Vicki Bennett) is releasing a new album
exclusively online here on UbuWeb. "Abridged Too Far" is a collection of audio work first
conceived through experimentation through or on radio. On this new collection, People
Like Us continues its pastiche of impressions of popular music from Europe and America
from the 1920s thru to 1990s. Vicki Bennett's work is an examination of the affect of
hearing well known tunes and lyrics in fragments, then putting those elements to play--
resonating, intermingling and recombining with the listeners own associations and shards
of memories. Full-color downloadable artwork and liner notes are available.


The 365 Days Project

UbuWeb is pleased to announce the re-launch and permanent home of curator Otis F. Odder's
365 Days Project. This legendary project, in which an MP3 a day -- of mostly outsider,
novelty, and oddball recordings -- was made available for the public to download over the
course of 2003. Briefly taken offline at the end of the project, it is now presented here
in its entirety, complete with images and vast commentary on each selection. The 365 Days
Project is part of UbuWeb's redesigned, newly-named and much expanded Outsiders section.


Stan Brakhage

"The Brakhage Lectures" (1972) Unavailable writings by filmmaker Stan Brakhage
(1933-2003) who gave these lectures as a credit course at the School of the Art Institute
of Chicago during the fall and early winter of 1970-71. Extended essays on George
MÃ©liÃ¨s, David Wark Griffith, Carl Theodore Dreyer, and Sergei Eisenstein. The original
program included screenings of forty-three films by MÃ©liÃ©s, Griffith, Dreyer,
Eisenstein, Cocteau and Edwin Porter. Includes an introduction by Robert Creeley.

Not a joke.

How many octopi does it take to change a light-bulb?

One. This is based on the animal's intelligence, which rivals own own.

One quarter. This is based on the manual dexterity of the animal's arms,

Dear Friends:

South African activist and writer Breyten Breytenbach
is part of the international delegation of poets and
writers going to the World Social Forum (WSF) to fight
for social justice and progressive change. The group
will be working with Oxfam's Control Arms campaign and
participating in several readings. In addition,
Rattapallax magazine will be filming indigenous people
at the WSF reading and performing their poetry for an
online library and future film on endangered
languages. The World Social Forum is a major assembly
of progressive organizations and will be held in Porto
Alegre, Brasil from 26 to 31, January 2005. The trip
is organized by Rattapallax and Prof. Lorenz.

A committed opponent of apartheid, Breyten Breytenbach
was a political prisoner serving two terms of solitary
confinement in South African prisons. He is the author
of "The True Confessions of an Albino Terrorist" and
other collections. Other participants include
Palestine poet Nathalie Handal, editor of the
anthology, "The Poetry of Arab Women" (PEN Oakland
award winner); and Rattapallax editor Ram Devineni.
They will be joined by Brasilian poets Fabrício
Carpinejar, author of "Cinco Marias" and "Biografia de
uma árvore"; Johnny Lorenz, Professor of English at
Montclair State University and a Fulbright Scholar;
Rodrigo Garcia Lopes, editor of "Coyote" magazine;
Flávia Rocha, co-founder of Acedemia Internacional de
Cinema in Curitiba and an editor at Rattapallax; and
Marlon de Almeida.

Oxfam, Amnesty International, and IANS' Control Arms
campaign educates the public and lobbies governments
to take action against the illicit trade of small
arms, which fuel violent conflict, state repression,
crime, and domestic abuse. More info at

The U.S. and its allies have killed 17,000 Iraqi civilians since January
2003. Since 1990, the U.S. prison population, already the world's
largest, has nearly doubled and now exceeds 2 million. California has
built 23 prisons and just one university since 1980. Last year, federal
investigators found a toxic rocket fuel chemical in almost all of more
than 200 samples of lettuce and milk collected nationwide. 23% of
Wal-Mart Supercenter customers live on incomes of less than $25,000 a
year. WHAT NOW?

Start the conversation. A series of performances, readings and dialogues
with artist-activists. All events FREE on the Mills Campus.

so george bowering although you won't read this:

for example

Phylum: Mollusca
Class: Cephalopoda(head-foot)



Because of the many movies in which cephalopods, especially octopi and
squids, attack people, boats, etc., there is a misconception that they are
aggressive and dumb creatures. In fact, there are only two species of
octopi that are aggressive (they are located in Austrailia), and they are
highly intelligent. They are probably the most intelligent of all the
invertebrates.

There are four types of cephalopods:

1) Octopi--they have eight symmetric arms (tenticles) which are used for
their protection and for obtaining food. They have an interesting mating
ritual: The males and females do not mate with any other partners besides
the chosen one. Shortly after the female has her children, she dies, but
the male stays with her--he does not mate again. This example is one of
the only monogamous relationship that exists among animals. The octopus
also has the most advanced sensory systems of any other invertebrate.

Dear Derek, THANK YOU.  This is exactly the kind of information I was
looking for.  I actually have poems in Issue 6 of Alba--

Shin Yu Pai recommended Richard Hansen's 24th Street Irregular Press, also,
and I plan to look into it.

I am bleeding somewhere because there are drops of blood on the floor.

Poets House presents

Ron Padgett on Pierre Reverdy

Thursday, January 20, 7pm



New York, January 2005—Poets House, a nonprofit literary center devoted to

poetry, presents poet Ron Padgett speaking on the poetry of Pierre Reverdy

(1889-1960), a prolific poet and central figure of France’s avant-garde

artistic and literary circles from the 1910s to the early 1920s. The event

will be held on Thursday, January 20, at 7pm, at Poets House, 72 Spring

Street, 2nd Floor, between Broadway and Lafayette. Admission is $7 or free

for members.

Ron Padgett is the author of the poetry volumes You Never Know (2002), Poems

I Guess I Wrote (2001), New &amp; Selected Poems (1995), The Big Something

(1990), Triangles in the Afternoon (1979), Great Balls of Fire (1969), and

other collections. His prose books include two memoirs, Joe: A Memoir of Joe

Brainard (2004) and Oklahoma Tough: My Father, King of the Bootleggers

(2003), as well as a volume of selected prose entitled Blood Work (1993),

and translations of Blaise Cendrars' Complete Poems (1992), Pierre Cabanne's

Dialogues with Marcel Duchamp (1971), and Guillaume Apollinaire's The Poet

Assassinated (1968), among others. For his translations Padgett has received

grants and awards from the National Endowment for the Arts, the New York

State Council on the Arts, and Columbia University's Translation Center. He

was the editor-in-chief of World Poets, a three-volume reference book

(2000).

Pierre Reverdy (1889-1960), a Cubist poet alongside Apollinaire and Max

Jacob, inspired the Surrealist movement and its leaders. He moved to Paris

in 1910 and founded the journal Nord-Sud (North-South) in 1917, and

published Apollinaire, Jacob, Aragon, Breton, Soupault, and Tzara in its

pages. In 1926 he left Paris and spent the rest of his life in Solesmes,

France. Reverdy wrote literary reviews in addition to his many poems, which

are available in English in Pierre Reverdy: Selected Poems (1991).

From which Blaser poem/text is this, Mark?
One wants to ask which President?
Or all our Presidents generically compatible?
Each President - no matter who - 'inheriting'
the Violent signature, a burning, an inherence
Projected continuously. "We" at the receiving,
Performing end?

I like it, the quote. I also like Ron P's translations of Reverdy
And hhis biography of Joe Brainard. As far as I am concerned,
Ron does have 'the touch.' Wonderful to see/hear!

According to the Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS), the
answer is Islamic extremism. Since 9/11, our national spy agency has put
Muslims under a microscope - especially those who are openly devout.
Indeed, many say they have been pressured to inform on their neighbours
and friends.

The "enemy within"?
Canada's intelligence service is spying on Muslims. 360 Vision
investigates how and why

What poses the greatest danger to the safety and security of Canadians
today?

According to the Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS), the
answer is Islamic extremism. Since 9/11, our national spy agency has put
Muslims under a microscope - especially those who are openly devout.
Indeed, many say they have been pressured to inform on their neighbours
and friends.

In a special report, the VisionTV current affairs series 360 Vision
reveals how CSIS goes about spying on Muslims. Executive Producer Sadia
Zaman investigates the effect that all this scrutiny has had upon the
community - and upon one family in particular.

The program airs on Wednesday, Jan. 26 at 9 p.m. and 1 a.m. ET. It
repeats on Thursday, Jan. 27 at 10 p.m. ET.

In a statement to 360 Vision producers, CSIS calls Islamic extremism
"the most important threat to the security of Canada." The agency
acknowledges enlisting members of the Muslim community to assist in its
efforts to "vigorously investigate this threat," but denies profiling
people on the basis of faith.

Many Canadian Muslims would disagree. Toronto lawyer Amina Sherazee says
that the intelligence and law enforcement community had begun to regard
devout Muslims as "the enemy within" even before 9/11. "It's based a lot
on stereotypes ... [of] particularly religiously observant Muslims being
radical or anti-Western and therefore wanting to destroy anything that's
related with Western values."

The Salaheddin Islamic Centre has been a particular focus of CSIS
suspicion. Imam Aly Hindy unapologetically describes his Scarborough,
Ont. mosque as "fundamentalist," and has been politically outspoken
about the oppression of Muslims. Hindy says CSIS has openly recruited
members of the community as informants. "I know I'm being watched," he says.

Worshippers are being watched, too. The Khadrs - a Canadian family with
ties to Al-Qaeda - used to attend the Salaheddin mosque. So did Mahmoud
Jaballah. A father of six and a former principal of the centre's private
elementary school, Jaballah has been jailed since August 2001 on a
"security certificate," which allows the accused to be held without
charges, bail or even the right to review the allegations against him.
CSIS has accused him of working for the Egyptian terrorist group
Al-Jihad, a charge he denies. (Jaballah is one of five Muslim men in
Canada now being detained indefinitely on security certificates.)

With his father behind bars, 18-year-old Ahmed Jaballah has become head
of the family. He fiercely rejects any suggestion of wrongdoing on the
part of his father or Aly Hindy, and has spoken out publicly against the
spy agency's treatment of the Muslim community. "I thought this country
was a country of freedom," Ahmed said at a recent protest. "We will not
sit back and see the injustice around us."

As for Mahmoud Jaballah, he regards his ongoing incarceration as a test
from God, and spends much of his time in prayer. "I never lose hope that
one day ... the whole family will be reunited," he tells 360 Vision.

360 Vision is the only national current affairs show devoted to
exploring the role that spirituality plays in the lives of Canadians.
The series features in-depth documentary reports, interviews with
leading contemporary thinkers, provocative commentary from faith expert
Marianne Meed Ward and a regular pop culture segment.

I also like the misspelling of "our own" in the "One" line.

I don't know Latin or Greek, but as I understand it the confusion over the
plural of "octopus" has to do with "pus" being Greek for foot, but it's
Latin wherein the plural of "-us" turns to "-i". The proper Greek plural of
"octopus" would be "octopodes". Seems like a faux intellectualism (such as
using bad French) that made "octopi" a convention.

For the record, my dictionary says either "octopi" or "octopuses" is
accepted, and so does my spellcheck.

The "enemy within" is the madness of US and other capitalist societies -
alienation...paranoia made worse by the owners of means of production - the
bourgeoisie - to use it as  a marxist term: by enormous military might and
capital and the terrible misuse of that: - and the drive for power and oil -
the Imperialist nature of the US- Brtish and other nations - their use of
racism to achieve their goals - their paying of puppets to do their work (as
they are attempting to do now in Iraq) - this bogus election taking place in
Iraq - my heart leaps with joy when I see suicide bombs gong off to disrupt
that monstrous hypocrisy - the US etc need to withdrwaw their occupation
from all round the workd - the terrorists are the US mainly - the
US-Military Industrial Complex as it was in the Vietnam days  - nothing  has
changed  fundmentally - the US is close to fascism. The Chinesee were gald
when s/11 hap[pedn  - they consideerd it  pay back - for all the bombing and
conniving and so on by the US throughout the world - the arrogant
interference in other peoples and other cultures - its sheer brutality -
vastness - and arrogance.  If this arrogance continues it will be nuclear

Subject: Social Security: Only Two Days Left


Dear Working Families e-Activist:

Please take one moment today to preserve retirement security and stop
President George W. Bush=B9s plan to privatize Social Security. We need to
deliver a loud and strong message by Thursday, Inauguration Day, telling
President Bush and Congress we demand they strengthen Social Security, not
wreck it.=20

Click here to sign the Petition to Protect Social Security:

http://www.unionvoice.org/campaign/ProtectSocialSecurity/
<http://www.unionvoice.org/ct/fp1CgoY1MqBu/>

President Bush=B9s plan to privatize Social Security would hurt working
families. It would force huge cuts in retirees=B9 benefits and saddle our
children with $2 trillion in debt, most of which we would owe to foreign
countries such as China and Japan. But it=B9s one of his top priorities=8Band
immediately following his inauguration this Thursday, Bush=B9s administration
will launch a PR campaign like we=B9ve never seen to privatize Social
Security.=20

We need to act now to make our voices heard. We need 100,000 signatures on
our petition by Thursday to make our point and counter this PR blitz. Pleas=
e
sign the Petition to Protect Social Security right now:

http://www.unionvoice.org/campaign/ProtectSocialSecurity/
<http://www.unionvoice.org/ct/fp1CgoY1MqBu/>

President Bush wants to trade Social Security=B9s guaranteed benefits for
risky Wall Street accounts. Politicians would decide which investment
companies manage the millions of accounts, opening the door to massive
political corruption and waste.

President Bush and his allies say the private accounts would be
voluntary=8Bbut even retirees who don=B9t sign up for private accounts will
suffer huge benefit cuts. Many retirees will be left in poverty, and
taxpayers and family members will have to provide them with the help that
now comes from Social Security=B9s guaranteed benefits.

Today, before the president=B9s inauguration, sign the Petition to Protect
Social Security:=20

http://www.unionvoice.org/campaign/ProtectSocialSecurity/
<http://www.unionvoice.org/ct/fp1CgoY1MqBu/>

Throughout our working lives, we pay into the Social Security system so we
can have a decent living after retirement. This isn=B9t a hand-out=8Bit=B9s money
that belongs to us because we paid into the Social Security trust fund.
Don=B9t let your retirement security be taken away. Please sign the petition,
then urge your friends, family and co-workers to sign it, too, by clicking
this link:=20

Manson has a lively poetry/conversation on our Amy Goodman station 1270,
and his own poetry very intense.  His own poetry is for the ear, so if you
are in the Buffalo area on January 28, come to the free Friday Night at
the Albright Knox Art Gallery, 6-8 pm.  January 28th

Cole is editor of the beautifully printed and wide ranging book length
P-Queue. Her own poetry combine a keen sense of abstraction, and lyricism,
and is immediately pleasurable.

Stephen, you've interrupted my happy lurkerdom.  Damn!

You're the second person in a week who's asked me about this.  In fact, both
of you are named Stephen.  I'm sensing a pattern here.

The poem is called "The Finder."  I ashamedly don't know which of Blaser's
books it's in.  I happened on it in the Messerli anthology From the Other
Side of the Century.  I suspect, but don't know, that the president referred
to is either Nixon or Johnson, though I guess it could also be Reagan.  I
use the passage as my e-mail signature because, for me, the lines refer more
presciently to our current historical tragedy.

While I'm quoting, here's another, from the horse's mouth: "It's important
for people to know that I'm the president of everybody."  This, from a story
I read last night, I think from the Washington Post.  The context,
amazingly, was his dumbfoundedness that more blacks didn't vote for him,
since he felt he had attempted to reach out to their community.  The
understated authoritarian phrasing here I think speaks for itself.  This was
the same interview, by the way, in which he said (& I'm paraphrasing) that
mistakes in Iraq now don't matter because the voters have spoken, & so the
"accountability moment" has passed.  Breathtaking.

As for Reverdy, I've been fascinated with his work for many years.  Ditto
Padgett.  Since Padgett's had a longstanding interest & involvement (as a
translator) in Reverdy's poetry, I'm very interested in what he'll have to
say (coincidentally, on the night of the inaugural).  You should also check
out Ashbery's translations of PR, if you haven't done so.  As well as the
book of translations Kenneth Rexroth published many moons ago.  All quite
worthwhile, if you're into that sort of thing.

Best,

Mark

Ron does have 'the touch.' Wonderful to see/hear!

Padgett

I read an interview with him and liked his work - I like that poem where all
of  sudden he saays - and so I (spend") my time waiting for a deaath" and
Iused itin a poem  - And I too , Padgy, spend my time awating anoter's
death" but of course to myt pepelwhen I read thepoem  - theconection was
obscure -dontknwoe why we poets show off liek thsi some times - allude etc
I'm read pieces her pieces tehre -pick up marknlbles of light and scraps  of
consciounessss, detritus - try to recycle it  - the mind is strange

Reverdy

Read a translation -which I could read French but we reading Reverdy (via
O'Hara  - his famous reference - I also read Tarkl - for some reason Trakl
is the writer for me (but Ilied themethod of Reverdy and tried to write omse
poems like him) - I even try to read him  (Trakl) in German - Iove the
German words - like 'dunkel' and 'tal' and so on -  my "son in law"  (my
daughter refuses to marry anyone - that's her business) is German - didnt
know  Trakl - but knew one other - read as more Si Fi and graphic novels etc

yes I thik Bly and otehrs came via Reverdy and Celan etc etc

Crossing the Century is good and I liek teh two volumes of Poems fo the
Milleiusm - great work I feel Puierre and Jerome - that's what Iwas thinking
of when I sent my "silybuggers" about the kabbala etc - my freind obecjted
that teauthors iuntrude toomuch but - well I liek it it geivesme some idea -
its wher I saw hoaw Mallarme started the "open form" with his poem about
the throw of a dice etc etc

Blaser

A friend of Spicers - must get his and more of Spicer's books - Spicer has
an imeediate impact for me - can use the net as I am a book seller but -
well hopefully it will turn up - dont want to go to Borders etc to pay $80
or more...
there is so much to read - we relyon reports...

True enough, I suppose, but some are more neglected than others, and then
there is the question of neglected by whom and why--and even where and
when--and it is useful, and valuable, when someone brings back to public
attention, or to the attention of a previously ignorant public, the work of
a poet which deserves that attention. We may all be neglected "in one way or
another/in more ways than one"--and it is also an interesting question
whether that is a good or bad thing--but not all of our work deserves the
kind of attention I am talking about.

Hey richard.tylr

I don't know what you're smoking in New Zealand but
you need to take a break

in reference to YOUR comment  "my heart leaps with joy when I see
suicide bombs gong off to disrupt
that monstrous hypocrisy"     what kind of sick shit is that

For the record that's the insane thinking that's helping to demonize
all opposing viewpoints
to this administration       I don't want to be lumped in with you

violence is the problem not the solution

the taking of any life is a crime          and I guess since I've read
Silliman's blog entry lately    here's
a little lesson for you

"A South politician preaches to the poor white man,
"You got more than the blacks, don't complain.
You're better than them, you been born with white skin," they explain.
And the Negro's name
Is used it is plain
For the politician's gain
As he rises to fame
And the poor white remains
On the caboose of the train
But it ain't him to blame
He's only a pawn in their game."

--Only a Pawn in Their Game, Bob Dylan

US Official Confirms Iraqi President Allawi Shot Six Dead:

They hang the man and flog the woman
That steal the goose from off the common,
But let the greater villain loose
That steals the common from the goose.

".....at a time when I am speaking to you about the paradox of desire -- in
the
sense that different goods obscure it -- you can hear outside the awful
language
of power.  There's no point in asking whether they are sincere or
hypocritical,
whether they want peace of whether they calculate the risks.  The dominating
impression as such a moment is that something that may pass for a prescribed
good; information addresses and captures impotent crowds to whom it is poured

forth like a liquor that leaves them dazed as they move toward the slaughter
house.
One might even ask if one would allow the cataclysm to occur without first
giving
free reign to this hubbub of voices...."

A quick note for anyone within range or visiting San Francisco.
Paule Anglim Gallery(15 Geary St.) has a current show of works by Jess
(Robert Duncan's partner) - including both collages and paintings.
The California Historical Society has a wonderful show(curated by the Poetr=
y
Center's Director Steve Dickinson)  of works(photographs, paintings,
collages etc.) by artists associated with poets - and some poets who paint,
etc.=20

Both wonderful and related shows for a variety of reasons. Of the high
points - at least for me - is a visual and felt sense of the dynamics, the
conversation going on among artists and poets of the late fifties (Duncan,
Jess, Bruce Connor, R Bladen, Fields(?), etc.) One can sense the level of
argument, collaboration and camaraderie. The varying focus on nature and
urban vernacular  versus the domestic and autre world of dreams, s=E9ance,
tarot, medieval and folk literatures. It's all very rich and riding an
underground world in the process of becoming visible.

Norma Cole's recreation of a Library circa 1959 is brilliant and gives the
period context a working view - perhaps not too dissimilar from Robert
Duncan's space and materials, let alone those of many others of the time
(let alone those among in the Fifties who were at small liberal arts
colleges then shoulder deep in the "Great Books" craze!)

Does anyone know who wrote a poem containing the following lines, more or
less as in my faulty German:

Und nun ist kommen der krieg, der krieg
(repeat three times?)
wer wilt nun k=FCssen
mein weisses leib?

Comes from WWI period and I vaguely remember seeing it in connection with
something about Joyce.

currently looking for poetry, fiction & non-fiction for an issue of John
Tranter's Jacket magazine to focus on the Vancouver writer George Bowering.

The issue will be (eventually) up at
http://www.jacketmagazine.com/28/index.html

Check out the Jacket magazine styleguide at:
http://jacketmagazine.com/styleguide.html

Send pieces to me at rob_mclennan@hotmail.com &, if they work, I will
forward them on. Jacket magazine reserves the right to veto, so even if I
like & accept its not a guarantee (but he says he hardly ever uses that).

the issue is slated to appear October 2005; obviously ill need to get
pieces well before that. query first on critical pieces, thanks.

It's no secret that I enjoy Dalachinsky's poetry, but I admit there are
times when his words are obscure. And oh drat, I might have to read them more
than once, because some of his pomes are puzzle-like, and I might not want a
challenge. T.S. Eliot said that poetry should always include common, indeed
almost immortal, language so that the poem's meaning will be preserved  as long as
possible, through generations and translations, if we're  lucky.

What do you think? And in this regard here is an interesting paper which
suggests that poetry-making is similar to learning a second language.

I don't smoke and I have never used marijuana. OK I was racing and pumping
with anger at the injustices done over there when I wrote that and off
course I don't like to see people killed - white or black - Iraqi or
otherwise  BUT the Iraqi liberation fighters have to struggle by whatever
means - the loss of their land by an invading force to them is the loss of
their life - imagine if the US had been invaded in WWll by the Japs - now
there would be some crawlers who cooperated with them - but a patriotic
American -and I mean a true patriot - a courageous patriot  - would join in
a resistance against that enemy - the object being to drive that invader out
of the US - now imagine also the US had not been particularly well armed as
it was in the 1940s and is now - then the resistance fighters in the US
could well- would in fact  employ ANY means to destroy the enemy

Mao Tse Tung used this method - he would encourage or entice the Japanese
further into guerrilla territory then they would secretly surround the
Japanese soldiers - and throw fire crackers at them - unnerve them, or they
would just charge at 4 am and they would usually kill EVERY JAP and take
their weapons - so there was a gain - a small gain - but a gain -

They won..they beat the Japanese before the US  Imperialists could get in
there and take China...but that's another story  - you will find that the
freedom fighters in Iraq are using similar techniques  - they will use
suicide bombs/ambushes /they will tunnel though the sand under US bases and
kill hundreds of young soldiers /they will kill men women children -
anything to disrupt/anyone who cooperates or is in the way is a
tagret -anyone - - it has to happen/ they must win - it is a fight for their
independence as than US fought the British - anything to rid their country
of a foreign alien culture and a fascist invader - toting guns and looking
like Darth Vaders  from one of the most psychotic and sick nations on God's
earth -anyone in Iraq who cooperates with US is a traitor and deserves death
!! Or worse - humiliation.  Nothing else ...now suicide bombing isn't
necessarily the best method as one of your soldiers (freedom fighters)
dies - that is a loss of one - but if you can kill a greater number of the
invaders or their collaborators that is a gain

I dont care if you think I am sick - and I'm not interested in what is on
Silliman's Blog (well I am  - I am intersted i his poetics - he very bright
guy  -- and a great poet -lo l- dont want to throw the baby out iwth
bathwater !!) (I do admire his poetry - his work but not his politics) he
was all for invading Afghanistan - he and Perloff - and Antin - I think he
called the Arabs/Moslems whoever etc rats (that sounds bizzare maybe Antin
was being ironic or something - we all say things...) - you can look back to
2001 on the List  when 9/11 happened (as I aalso admire especially Antin;s
talk poems and Perloff's critical writings -great writing I think): But look
at this it was in a local mag called Brief in NZ:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-------------------------
Scott:  In your China poems you sometimes seem to look back at the New
Zealand natural landscape with affection.

Hamish:  For me, landscape is always something which is inanimate. And it is
usually malign...remember, I moved about in China itself, moved from the
sticks to the coast and took jobs teaching English, without the literature
thing. Finished my Masters' thesis off in China.

Scott: Bruce Andrews?

Hamish:  Bruce Andrews.

Scott:  What'd you end up thinking about his work? It might not have been so
bad studying a poet of dissonance and disjunction in such an alien
environment.

Hamish:  Well, Andrews is working with the violence and dissonance of
American society. Social breakdown, breakdowns in communication. Often he
works by writing down phrases he hears, overhears, and tries to shape them,
relate them, without necessarily making 'sense'. The question is whether he
is not simply reproducing the violence that gives him his material...The
Language poets offer us a whole range of models, formal models, but I don't
see the need to accept the programme, to buy the whole package. Take what
you can use. I particularly like Susan Howe.

Scott:  I agree with that attitude. Some of the critical writing of Ron
Silliman, for instance, is incredibly dogmatic. He almost outlaws everything
except his 'New Sentence'. A particular form is fetishised as oppositional,
subversive yadaya, but the impact of any literary form always depends on
context. After a few books of Silliman's I felt that a rhymed sonnet would
be more subversive than another 'new' sentence. And of course the only
people who were using the new revolutionary formula happened to live in the
richest societies in the world. So the form was imperiocentric.

Hamish:  I can't comment on Silliman, but Andrews has a solid background in
Marxism, political economy. He's hardcore. That's one of the things that
makes him interesting...but Silliman, I've never been that into him...a bit
dry?

Scott:  I thought the bankruptcy of Silliman and one or two others - David
Antin and Marjorie Perloff are names that come to mind - was shown after S
11, when they suddenly morphed into unpaid military advisors to George
Dubya.

Hamish:  Really? On the EPC list? I haven't checked that for years...

Scott:  If you were against the invasion of Afghanistan Silliman called you
an appeaser. The enemy was Islamofascism. Antin actually talked about rats,
and having to do an extermination job...understandable responses from
ordinary Americans, maybe, but not quite what you'd expect from the
Patriachs of the Oppositional Word.

Hamish:  Most of the Chinese that I talked to had little sympathy with the
US after S 11. In fact many were happy. They saw it as the US getting paid
back a little for what it's done so often. If the US ever invades China, it
will make Iraq look like a cakewalk. The Chinese would just run out of their
homes and fight the US troops, with anything they've got. Forks and knives
off the table if they had nothing else. They hate America.

Scott:  You've written academic or semi-academic stuff on other people?

Hamish:  Leigh Davis, a couple of pieces, the second of which takes issue
with the commodification of language in his work...I'm keen on Joanna Paul
and have written a bit on her. I'm interested in anyone who's experimenting
with language in a disciplined manner. Innovative but also crafted work.

Scott:  Do you value craft above inspiration, or vice versa, or is the
opposition too old-fashioned to be bothered about?

Hamish:  Inspiration is a craft. Next question.

Scott:  I'm running out. Jack, do you want to ask a question?

Jack:  I'm telling an anecdote from Seinfeld. You don't want it on tape.

Scott:  Are you a Beatles man or an Elvis man?

Hamish:  Beatles man. That opposition is certainly not outdated. Elvis is
deeply unchoice.

Scott:  Favourite Beatles song?

Hamish: 'She's So Heavy'.

Scott: If you could have dinner with any person living or dead, who would it
be?

Hamish:  Curnow.

Scott:  Wystan? Why don't you ring him up and ask him out to the Steak
House -

Hamish: No, you fool! Allen! Allen Curnow! Curnow the elder.

OK - my  post - the one you are criticising - was full of rhetoric but that

British, Australian, New Zealand (as we are involved don't you worry NZ is
right in their with the US - the Govt is I mean) - Scott is maybe a bit
unfair on Ron above - but we all have our views of things.   Ron knows my
views teres matter - started out in 2001 with as a call to exterminate all
the Arabs !! I was vert angry that NY had been attacked  -lol - but then I
changed .....
OK maybe I was angry (in the post you criticised - you have a right to  - I
take your point on Dylan etc (yes  a lot of people are being used here - but
"A revolution is not a tea party." - Mao Tse Tung - and it is maybe silly to
be angry  - but I don't like to see weak nations (or any nations) illegally
invaded - 10.000 civilians murdered - - and then all this hypocrisy about
democracy - democracy  - US and NZ style I oppose: but that's my view - I
don't believe in democracy it is total crap - but that's only my view - I do
believe in independence for Iraq., Afghanistan and Palestine and Diego
Garcia etc

This war in Iraq is brutal and the freedom fighters have to become hard-
merciless -pitiless - the weak the squeamish or the frightened get killed
off [[ I would myself probably get killed off - I dont want to - or ever
have to kill anyone - I have never used a gun - even in hunting mad NZ - am
not a fighter per se/ notinto violicne - very nervous and some time a

self defence here by a nation ]] and  the hard core of true revolutionaries
survive - ready always to die - for it is better to die free than live as a

But read this:

You seem to have an unpleasant relish at this prospect.

Richard, rhetoric gets people killed, so it's no excuse saying "it's only
rhetoric". Your comments are ugly, but I won't go on about that, apart from
agreeing with Lawrence Sawyer that all they achieve is helping the Bushites=
.
They're also ignorant: the Iraqi resistance is hardly a single entity.  It'=
s
not simple, and there's agendas beyond "self defence of a nation" happening
there and many internal conflicts.  Sunni extremists are busy bombing Shias=
,
who happen to be the majority population; Sistani, the most influential Shi=
a
cleric, was notably quiet on the razing of Falluja late last year.

Below an interesting December commentary from Empire Notes, which hopefully
will inflect your responses a little more subtly.  Whether you agree with
his analysis or not, he's painting a rather complicated picture of what's
going on there.  You seem to fit attitude 2.

http://www.empirenotes.org/december04.html#20dec041



Thinking Beyond the Comfort Zone: Failures of the Iraqi Resistance

Here's my latest commentary for Uprising Radio :

Here=B9s the second of my series on Thinking Beyond the Comfort Zone. The
first evaluated the latest assault on Fallujah as a victory for the United
States. Here I=B9ll analyze one of the reasons for that victory -- the
politics of the Iraqi resistance.

There are several attitudes toward the resistance that one finds among the
antiwar left:=20

1. Reject them and express support for marginal secular =B3civil society=B2
groups that oppose the occupation.
2. Express unconditional adulation for them as opponents of U.S.
imperialism.=20
3. Ignore them as much as possible while expressing opposition to the
occupation.=20

The third option seems most common. But hiding our heads in the sand hardly
helps to create an informed left that understands the world in order to
change it.=20

It=B9s long been my evaluation that most of the Iraqi armed resistance has
virtually no political program. Parts of it are extremely Islamist and so
have an agenda of beating wine-sellers and forcing women, whether Muslim or
not, to wear the hijab; parts of it, seemingly foreign in inspiration but
only partly foreign in composition, have the goal of killing Shi=B9a. Moqtada
al-Sadr=B9s Mahdi Army has the stated goal of introducing an Islamic
theocracy. Most of the resistance has the goal of driving the foreign
occupiers out; other parts have the goal of keeping them bogged down in
Iraq. Clearly, those whose primary goal is sectarian war of Shi=B9a against
Sunni are helping the occupation, since the growing gulf between the two
communities is the primary political asset the occupiers have.

But beyond these basic elements, there is no larger program. Gerard
Chaliand, chronicler of revolutionary guerrilla movements around the world,
wrote of the Afghan mujaheddin in 1980 that they were the only guerrillas h=
e
had seen with no social programs =AD no village chicken cooperative, no
literacy program, etc. The Iraqi resistance is the same, very much unlike
Hamas or Hezbollah.

Ever since the events of April, it=B9s been my analysis that the best strateg=
y
for the U.S. military to defeat the resistance is not to fight them. When
reacting to a U.S. assault, they occasionally gain a clear political
purpose, but when the assault is over that purpose is quickly lost.

Such a way of thinking is so utterly foreign to the U.S. military that ther=
e
was no way it would be adopted consciously. But it was adopted in Fallujah
by accident. After the failure of the April assault, the Bush administratio=
n
wanted to wait until after the elections=AD and so we saw six months of the
Islamic Republic of Fallujah. During this time, many people grew heartily
tired of the dictatorial ways of much of the resistance.

Most of all, the natives got to see that being ruled by the mujaheddin, eve=
n
though the majority were also indigenous to the town, did nothing for them.
They didn=B9t want the November assault, but they did desert the town in
droves; very much unlike April, the majority of Fallujans did not identify
with the resistance.

Another great failure of the Sunni-based resistance is that it has not
unequivocally condemned the massive sectarian anti-Shi=B9a violence being don=
e
by groups like Zarqawi=B9s, the latest incident being bombings in the Shi=B9a
holy cities of Najaf and Karbala killing over 60.

Any guerrilla war of a Third World people against a First World military
force is primarily a political battle. Right now in Iraq, due in part to it=
s
massive political deficiencies, the resistance cannot win. Whether the
United States can win is still an open question.

In order for resistance to the occupation to have any chance, it must first
renounce sectarian violence and pointless terrorism like kidnapping and
killing random foreigners, in order to build some basis for Iraqi unity.
Second, it must recognize that the current struggle has no way to involve
the ordinary Iraqi; indeed, most Shi=B9a are now being told by Sistani that
the best way to oppose the occupation is to vote in the election. Mass
action, like the gatherings that broke through the barricades around
Fallujah in April or the protest last February that forced the United State=
s
to agree to elections, are an essential component of a serious strategy to
end the occupation.

Lawsuit Filed Against George W. Bush and Richard B. Cheney
By DOUG WALLACE


They hang the man and flog the woman
That steal the goose from off the common,
But let the greater villain loose
That steals the common from the goose.

".....at a time when I am speaking to you about the paradox of desire -- in
the
sense that different goods obscure it -- you can hear outside the awful
language
of power.  There's no point in asking whether they are sincere or
hypocritical,
whether they want peace of whether they calculate the risks.  The dominating
impression as such a moment is that something that may pass for a prescribed
good; information addresses and captures impotent crowds to whom it is poured

forth like a liquor that leaves them dazed as they move toward the slaughter
house.
One might even ask if one would allow the cataclysm to occur without first
giving
free reign to this hubbub of voices...."

It's worth pointing out that one can be categorically opposed to the US
occupation and opposed to one or more of the groups that is fighting that
occupation on the grounds that the group's agenda is itself, on its own
terms, questionable. Not only does it romanticize the meaning of military
occupation, what it means to be an occupied people, to assume that all those
who fight against the occupation are allies at some level that transcends
both the differences between them and the moral and ethical content of their
agenda(s) on its/their own terms. It also allows those of us who are not
there, in the conflict, to opt out of dealing with the complexities of the
reality on the ground. Case in point: One can believe categorically that
Israel should withdraw from the occupied territories; one can understand the
logic behind/inevitability of suicide bombers as a means of fighting the
occupation--and one might even support them--but that does not mean that all
the groups that employ suicide bombing as a method of resistance are equally
deserving of that understanding and support. Hamas has stated plainly not
only that it's goal is the elimination of Israel, but also that it intends
to establish a Muslim theocracy in the land that is now Israel and
Palestine. (I may have the specifics of the geography wrong--it's been a
while since I looked at Hamas' charter--but the general point is still the
same.) These are two goals that should give anyone pause because they mean
that Hamas' interest is not Palestinian self-determination; it is not
freedom and secular democracy. Their goal is a religiously nationalistic
one--their charter reads spookily like statemtents of Zionist purpose that I
have read elsewhere--and so it actually obscures a very difficult reality to
suggest that all Palestinian resistance to the Israeli occupation is freedom
fighting. The same is true about making those kinds of statements about
those in Iraq who are fighting the US occupation.

The Inauguration

I never expected the inauguration to be a bloodbath.
The emperor was covered with it, just before he went down.
His hordes were his minions and were trampled with it.
I felt I shouldn't cheer the wrack and ruin, even of an evil man.
I was unable to hide the joy I felt at his demise.
His ruined body was thrown back to the devastated crowed.
The devastating crowd got there first and crowed.
It was cathartic, I tell you, cathartic.
The end of an evil man brought happiness to my eyes.
Killings were needed to end the killings.
Killings here stopped the killings there.
For a second the world seemed teetering on this happiness.
Humanity was at its best fighting violence with violence.
If you are new and come along, beware and do your best.
You may yet find your inauguration full of kindly smiles.

the idea of an email and a movie reminds me a bit of dinner and a movie. the
movies are difficult though, alan, to view because you're not streaming
them. why don't you provide links not to .mov files but to .html files that
have the .mov files embedded and streaming? that can't be terribly hard to
do. doron golan does that superbly well and i actually look forward to his
movie posts on rhizome. have a look at how he does it; view the source of
the html files. also, your .mov files are usually very long for what they
do. the last movie consists of stills. so you probably send about a megabyte
of info for one still whereas it's really about 30kb worth. this is ok if
the movie is streaming, i guess (as long as people have cablemodem or dsl).

like i said, the idea of an email and a movie i like, and this text and this
email are kind of interesting together, but i usually couldn't be bothered
to read the email or watch the movie because too many times your movies take
forever to download and they don't start until they're finished downloading
and you don't give any indication of how big the download is etc etc.

I personlly dont - I cant work a lot of poetry out - (are we ever or always
meant to ?)  and what I say below is probably mixed up  -and you may know a
lot of it  - but here is my response -

Obscurity or difficulty is a tactic or a methodology in Modernist and
Postmodernist poetry - Steve has a kind of jazzy slangy way and a quite
brilliant way with phrases and language - he is not a langpo per se but has
some similarities - the langpos -(if they can be considered as one group or
movement) had/have a more complex agenda - they used Radical Artifice (title
of a book by M Perloff - very good book ) - they put the signifier in a
central place and or they exploded the language into fragments  - see Steve
McCaffery - but that poetry is or feeds on ambiguity is written about as far
back as Cleanth Brooks in "The Well Wrought Urn"
more recent is Charles Bernstein's "A Poetics" - sometimes I have more
difficulty with the so-called modernist poets - eg in NZ sometimes cant
"figure out " what eg Vincent O'Suullivan is saying (he is a great writer I
feel)  - in his "logical meaning" - the puzzle - as you say - but the
language poets for example are wanting their readers to make coneptual leaps
etc (they dont neccesarily have "logical verbal jig saw puzzles" or complex
metaphorical things to "work out")   -not neccesary to work everything
out -as in say a  poem by Elizabeth Bishop - although its dubious one can
ever "work everything out" by her or by any poet - each individual in fact
brings a different reaction and experience to a poem - the langauge and some
more recent "radical" poets  -   etc are fragementing -or they may use that
as a tactic etc so that while there are still semantic links - no writing is
really meaningless - its not so easy to see the 'message' - (it was said I
believe that Celan "put messages in bottles" ) or ideational links etc -
another good writer on difficulty is George Steiner - his "analysis " of
"dificulty" is interesting and in fact Mark Scroggins uses it in his book
about Zukofsky - there is another level of poetry at is very close to the
condition of music and - while it maybe can be "analysed" one needs really
to let it work on one  - this inspirational or intuitive or 'symbolist'
strand goes through all poetry but a strong example is Mallarme
tc  -another John Ashbery (although the NY poets added irony to surrealism
and other techniques ( a 'true surealist" would perhaps be one example of a
writer trying to approach "the pure music of poetry"  - and the concept of
Ostranie  (the concept of amking the poem or phrases strange - is another
direction (or angle) -even  modernist poets employ strangeness/ambiguity -
magic - if you like.

I like Steve's frenetic style - if I wanted to write a book about his work I
would probably link up a lot of the stuff in his work but at certain levels
I just let such poetry "work on me " - it is more problematic with say, Alan
Sondheim,  as one wants to know his raison d'etre etc and his method -while
individual poems can work directly on me - in his case the greater picture
is like a -or seems to be - like  - a huge puzzle - a puzzle possibly never
to be "solved" but to for each reader to get things from it and  for some to
see something of the whole picture if they ever have the energy and the
time -just as if someone had time to "work out" Finnegan's Wake  - but I
would rather just listen to someone  read it -an Irishman reading it -heard
Joyce once reading Anna Livia PLurabele on the radio -that  brought it
alive - his voice - read somewhere Joyce suggested people treat Finnegan's
Wake as a "huge poem" -worked out in detail before hand but..well nothing is
totally determined  (contrast with the  Stein of "Stanzas
in Meditation" )


BTW I am guessing but like me Steve isnt a good "trypist" and hence  - in
the process of writing he develops phrases and ways of talking - somewhat
conditioned by the cyberspeak we use (or misuse) - short cuts and accidental
and deliberate neologisms - informed by his fasicnation for jazz - are
invented by his mispelling of words etc (deliberate or other) - his voice -
the voice of the street etc

Some pennies from me - I find most  poetry difficult

Ricard Taylor

 PS  Eliot was  right - somewhat - what is the "meaning" of Blakes "Tyger"?
It is in its magic and its music - but there are symobolic things there if
you want them.... What is the Meaning of Meaning ? -( a book by I A
Richards)

Richard,

Steve so very warmly assures me that "it's ok not to understand some of my
words...they are probably those that are made up on the spot and will never see
 the light of day...again some are simply words spelled backward and some
made-up...send me a list and i'll tell ya...but sure no need to struggle with
the pome...if you don't get it that's ok"

Of course you very articulately explained what I had forgotten, that  jazz
poets, especially in the fine tradition of the Beats like Kerouac, always  made
up cool spontaneous words and refused to correct typos according  to the
spontaneous 'discipline'. I've listened to lots of Steve's recorded  poetry, and
you really need to hear him rather than read him. He's actually not  frenetic,
more melodious and flowing, quite liquid, flugent. Now  Vernon, you could
describe his poetry as frenetic, and  wonderfully so. Neither of them are radically
deconstructionist, and I  appreciate that, because my brain works randomly
enough. I just can't take the  challenge. I can 'look at' abstract art much more
easily than abstract  poetry. For me, words and communication in speaking and
writing can't be too  radical or they say nothing except for the writer.
That's just my taste,  however, and I know many will disagree.

I enjoy different styles of poetry, and if I may mix  metaphors, quickies can
be as nice as marathons. Every person-poet has both  unique meaning and
unique expression. When you read/hear several  pieces by a particular poet, you get
it and them. You're right about poets  themselves not always knowing what
they're writing and how you have to allow it  to work on you.

Richard, if you're working out on poems, stop that right now
and get yourself to a gym. If they're not working out on you,
count that as a blessing.

A Lament for the Martyrs

   I am sitting in an outdoor cafe across the street from the
Coliseum. The noon is so brilliant that I have to wear my dark
glasses. You would think a Roman noon could lay even the
Coliseum wide open.
   But darknesses still foul the place and its hateful grandeur.
The Roman Chamber of Commerce and Betelgueze in
combine could gut the Coliseum by day or by night till the
ghost of Mussolini and the ghost of God turned blue in the
face, and light wouldn't mean a thing in that darkness. Cities
are times of day. Once Rome was noon. Do you get me? To
take a slow lazy walk with Quintus Horatius Flaccus at four
o'clock in the night was to become light. If you don't believe
me, I offer you a method of scientific verification. I lay you
eight to five that you will go blind if you take a walk at high
noon with the President of the United States. I love my
country for it's light. I love Rome because Horace lived there.
I am afraid of the dark. I am game to live with intelligent
sinners. Sometimes these days the Romans say that whatever
the Barbarians left behind was later sacked and raped by the
Barberinis, the noble family who needed the remnant marble
for their country palaces. I find them fair enough for me.
When I was a boy, the mayors of five towns in the Ohio
River Valley solved the practical problems of prohibition by
picking the purest and most perfect bootlegger between
Pittsburgh and Cincinnati to become Chairman of the
Committee for Liquor Control. I think it would be wicked
for me to wonder what the five mayors did with their cut in
private. All I know is that within a year after Milber s public
appointment to a legal office, a symphony orchestra
mysteriously appeared in one town, two spacious football
stadiums appeared in two other towns, the madame of the
cathouse in Wheeling was appointed a dollar-a-year man by
the Federal Government, and I lost an essay-contest whose
subject was the life and work of William Dean Howells, an
American author who was born in Martins Ferry, Ohio, for
Christ's sake, and whose books I had never even heard of,
much less read. (As I look back over the shadows of the years,
I confess that I have read one of his novels. I like him. He was
a good friend of Mark Twain.)
   But right now the Roman noon is so brilliant that it hurts
my eyes. ! I sip my cappuchino at a wobbly sidewalk table and
ponder the antiquities of my own childhood: the beautiful
river, that black ditch of horror; and the streetcars. Where have
they gone now, with their wicker seats that seemed to rattle
behind the dull headlights in the slow dusk, in summer where
everything in Ohio ran down and yet never quite stopped?
   Now, the Romans and the discovered Americans stroll blinded
in the Coliseum, deaf to the shadows the place never loses, even
at noon in Rome, that was for a little while one of the few noons.
   Some archaeologist gouged out the smooth dust floor of the
Coliseum to make it clean. The floor now is a careful revelation.
It is an intricate and intelligent series of ditches, and the sun
cannot reach them. They are the shadows of starved people who
did not even want to die. They were not even Jews.
   There is no way to get rid of the shadows of human beings
who could find God only in that last welcome of the creation,
the maws of tortured animals.
   Is that last best surest way to heaven the throat of the
hungry? If it is, God is very beautiful, if not very bright.
   Who are the hungry? What color is a hungry shadow?
   Even the noon sunlight in the Coliseum is the golden
shadow of a starved lion, the most beautiful of God's creatures
except maybe horses.

"...First and second language learners and students of poetry writing
all practise and develop their apprenticeship through dialogic
interaction with others (even where this dialogue has largely to take
place in the head of the individual and with dead people). All are,
we may say, apprentice meaning makers. They are testing limits to
find their way. The difference for the writer of poems is that this
apprenticing in language is his or her permanent condition of
practice, and undertaken in a material in which writers are generally
and for everyday purposes fluent; the language which they are
learning will permanently need to be new to them, in order to have
life, in order that is, to renew them and to be renewed by them...."

Well, it's just wrong on the face of it that "the" difference between
writers of poems and learners of languages is "his or her pemanent
condition of practice" -- or even that it's a significant difference.

Reading that article makes me think of the papers of 7th graders who
are just learning to use the encyclopedia. They are clearly clueless
about what they are cribbing from the source material, but they are
so earnest about it! This fellow clearly doesn't understand what he's
talking about, but he sure is earnest about it.

        This is for real--and it's likely we'll have a second similar
position to advertise soon, once it gets through final approval, so
stay tuned. You'll love it here! Today a foot of snow and classes

Oh thanks for this, Jerry, though I'm keeping the television off for fear of
contacting terminal depression, ha, but then had to read the news and lo and
behold Boston is 'in a state of high tension' as the FBI searches for four Chinese
nationals who crossed the Mexican/US border and via NYC are on their way to
Boston with a dirty bomb or else by exploding an oil truck (probably easier to
disguise since given winter oil trucks are everywhere) though our local officials
assure us "damages will be minimal and contained." I wonder why they're after
Boston? too blue probably? they just can't wait to blow up the state that gave
Bush only 30% of the vote? go figure,  so thanks for this, I realize it cheered a
little because "four years of winter" at least is a period of time that has a definite
end, better four years of winter than the deepfreeze forever, well, now back to
watching for the oil truck,

best,

Rebecca, I could not help but conflate the "oil truck" scare in Boston with
our 'Driver' George whose mantra for the next four years (and the last four)
= "Give me democracy or I will blow you up." The truck's continuously
honking horn resembles the sound of "Fallujah, Fallujah, Fallujah."
"Drive, he said." Oy.

That's right, I think. I remember that my first experience of
William Carlos Williams was that he was so refreshingly
particular.

There is a problem that would-be teen poets have---
they tend to be general. If one can offer to them the
choice of being particular, one will help them along.

Writer and musician Lenny Kaye=B9s You Call It Madness (just out from
Villard/Random House) illuminates a critical juncture in American popular
culture=8Ba time when singers crossed gender and racial lines, and the mores
of the twentieth century began to shed their inhibitions. Tonight Kaye will
read and perform songs from his impressionistic study of the romantic
singers of the 1930s, complete with tuxedo shirt and vibratoed guitar.

WRITING WORKSHOPS AT THE POETRY PROJECT

KEEPING IT SIMPLE/LOOKING FOR THE LIGHT =AD PATRICIA SPEARS JONES
TUESDAYS AT 7 PM: 10 SESSIONS BEGIN FEBRUARY 22ND
"The quality of light by which we scrutinize our lives has direct bearing
upon the product which we live...It is within this light that we form those
ideas by which we pursue our magic and make it realized. This is poetry as
illumination." =AD from =B3Poetry is Not a Luxury=B2 by Audre Lorde. =B3This is a
poetry workshop that takes the poetry of illumination to mean the poetry of
experience. How we scrutinize, how we elucidate our lives through words and
rhythms, how we make our poems bring new ways of thinking about our lives.
We will focus on the basics: line, stanza, cadence, meter, diction, syntax,
and point of view -=AD the elements that make a poem. We will also read
contemporary poets including Audre Lorde, Maureen Owen, Amy Gerstler, Shara=
n
Strange, Lee Young Lee, Jeanne Marie Beaumont, Frank O'Hara, Lorenzo Thomas=
,
and Bob Kaufman.=B2 Patricia Spears Jones is an award-winning poet and
playwright, and author of The Weather That Kills. Students must submit 5-10
pg. work samples before the class begins.

FINDING THE & THEN SOME THERE THERE =AD MERRY FORTUNE
THURSDAYS at 7 PM: 10 SESSIONS BEGIN FEBRUARY 24TH
Film of Dreyer, writing of Mayer, painting of Traylor. An identifiable poet
=B3voice=B2 is a desirable, comfortable and utilitarian achievement. But what
potential or beautiful mystery lurks beyond carefully cultivated form,
tendency, technique, habit and boundary. Exploring the processes, qualities
and aesthetics of all art forms we will collectively discover commonalities=
,
and fearlessly apprehend what we may learn to expand our poetic values and
vocabularies as well as our very minds. Merry Fortune is the author of
Ghosts By Albert Ayler, Ghosts By Albert Ayler (Futurepoem).

HYPNOSIS AND CREATIVITY =AD MAGGIE DUBRIS
FRIDAYS AT 7 PM: 5 SESSIONS BEGIN FEBRUARY 25TH
=B3Hypnotic and trance states have been used for centuries by shamans, mystic=
s
and visionaries. In this five week workshop, we will study techniques for
self-hypnosis that allow a writer to easily access the creative flow state.
We will explore the use of hypnotic tools to generate images, to increase
creative focus, to switch gears from a day job into writing, and to
circumvent creative blocks. We will also discuss the use of hypnosis to
vividly recall memories, and its use in conjunction with other creative
tools such as automatic writing.=B2 A $20 materials fee covers four of
Dubris=B9s hypnosis CDs, three of which are specifically geared to writing.
Maggie Dubris is the author of Skels (Soft Skull Press 2004), and Weep Not,
My Wanton (Black Sparrow Press 2002). She is also employed as a professiona=
l
hypnotist.=20


POETRY AND MUSIC =AD DREW GARDNER
FRIDAYS at 7 PM: 5 SESSIONS BEGIN APRIL 8TH
=B3A workshop investigating the relation of music and poetry, comparing the
languages of poetry and music and asking questions about how they can be
combined and how they might illuminate each other. What are the poetic
implications of improvisation? What are the musical implications of everyda=
y
speech? What does our experience of poetry imply about how we experience
sound and how does our listening affect our writing? We will read and liste=
n
to Harry Partch, Morton Feldman, Leo Smith, Pauline Oliveros, Thoreau,
Nathaniel Mackey and others, keep listening notebooks and collaborate with
guest musicians. No musical background required.=B2 Drew Gardner is the autho=
r
of Sugar Pill (Krupskaya) and conducts the Poetics Orchestra, an ensemble
featuring poetry and structured improvisation.


A LAB: POST-CONCEPTUAL POETRIES =AD ROBERT FITTERMAN
SATURDAYS AT 12PM: 10 SESSIONS BEGIN FEBRUARY 26
=B3What happens when we ask ourselves not if the poem =B3could have been done
better, but whether it could have been done otherwise=B2 (Dworkin). In
post-conceptual writing, the expression is realized in the process. This
workshop will be a hands-on writing lab. Each week we will write poems
in-class generated by borrowed models from contemporary, 21st Century
poetry. Some of these experiments might include: sampling, bastardization,
procedural writing, mixed media, collaboration, etc.=B2 Robert Fitterman is
the author of 9 books of poetry including: Metropolis XXX (Edge Books),
Metropolis 16-29 (Coach House Press) and Metropolis 1-15 (Sun & Moon Press)=
.

I'm looking for parodies, riffs, spoofs on traditional patriotic songs
(written by poets dear or near to this list, in particular).

If anyone has or can refer me to any, I'd be grateful. Backchannel at

M.T   Cross pointed out SARAH IS CAMPBELL  CAMPBELL  CAMPBELL.
Cole is Barbara Cole.

And what is more:  DOUGLAS MANSON should have been in caps too.

And how come I haven't mentioned THOM DONOVAN--poet, artist, introducer,
suave and subtle.


And then there's M. T. Cross himself--strongly recommended by Elizabeth
Willis.


They will all (except for Liz) be at the ALBRIGHT KNOX  January 28 6-8 pm.

Cheers from

Intersection for the Arts presents a four-part intergenerational reading =
series featuring some of our most esteemed literary icons and =
writer-teachers and youth poets from WritersCorps, an organization that =
has transformed and strengthened individuals and communities through the =
written and spoken word.  Since its inception in 1994, WritersCorps has =
helped over 10,000 young people from neighborhoods throughout San =
Francisco improve their literacy and increase their desire to learn.=20

This current series explores the themes and styles of writing across =
three different generations - writers in their teens, writers in their =
20's & 30's, and writers who have been impacting the Bay Area community =
for decades not only through their published work, but also through =
their teaching, mentoring, and tireless advocacy of transformation =
through literature.=20

Intersection for the Arts has the distinction of programming the oldest, =
continuous, independent reading series in California (est. 1965).  The =
program features a remarkable and diverse array of emerging and =
established writers who are committed to expanding the notion of =
literature, testing cultural and discipline-based boundaries, and =
building new audiences for live, intimate literary experiences.  =
Intersection works with writers in every genre and style, providing a =
comprehensive context for contemporary literature.  In recent years, =
Intersection has worked with new and seasoned writers including Aya de =
Le=C3=B3n, bell hooks, Mike Davis, John Trudell, Tillie Olsen, Alice =

Hey jim,=20
Please explain how you see the poetry in this, there are no letters, no
words, written or sounded to want to make me interpret this work in a
textual way.
The piece is engaging, but i would have a hard time calling it music, =
visual
art, or poetry. Unlike the work of Nicholas Clauss, www.flyingpuppet.com =
 or
reiner Strasser's and domiziana giordano's 'doorman',
http://nonfinito.de/doorman/ which i do see as poetry even in the =
absence of
words.=20
i cannot extract a narrative thread, or reflect on my own experience, or
fill spaces paratactically generated by the work.
I can only become absorbed in the music and visual stimulus and tactile
input of my mouse. It is like many new media works, an of-the-moment
experience, what ya get is what ya get, and then you move on. Not that =
there
is anything wrong with that, much new media poetry fits into this mould. =

To be well read these days to me means that you surf the web a lot =
looking
for cybertexts, experience them, bookmark some and move on.=20
You Jim would have to be one of the best searchers and sharers of =
sources of
interesting sites. Thank you for always asking me to think, even if
sometimes i don't agree with you. =20

hi komninos,

just to be clear, the term "algorithmic poetry" is one that durieu uses
about some of his work. i called the 'pixelbypixel' piece (
http://www.lecielestbleu.com/media/pixelbypixelframe.htm ) "algorithmic
poetry" primarily because that's what durieu himself called it.

in 2003 i did an interview with durieu (at
http://turbulence.org/curators/Paris/durieuenglish.htm ) in which he talks a
bit about "algorithmic poetry". he says:

 "...the aim of all this is to create poetry. So, I like to speak about
algorithmic poetry. A poem is a text that procures you poetry if you read
it. The code I'm trying to write is a text that procures you poetry if a
computer reads it for you...."

one can of course interpret this various ways. but, if you read the
interview, you get some sense of the nature of the algorithmic poetry of the
durieu piece 'oeil complex'. the interview reads not as a 'who done it' but
as a 'how'd he do it'. the question is answered, actually, in the end.

programming is a matter of writing. i know it is hard for some people to
conceive of it as admitting the possibility of poetry (not to say that's how
you feel), but that will eventually change.

durieu might strengthen his case were he to incorporate the source code into
what is publicly viewable. he doesn't publish his source code. one is left
to figure it out for oneself. which could conceivably be an important part
of his notion of "algorithmic poetry", come to think of it. publishing it
disambiguates it completely. whereas we associate with poetry rich
ambiguity. by not publishing the source code, one is left to make many
inferences.

shifting topic a bit, you say "i cannot extract a narrative thread, or
reflect on my own experience, or fill spaces paratactically generated by the
work".

when i experience 'pixelbypixel', i find myself composing visually and
sonically. and thinking about the compositional notions of the sonic
possibilities. if one fiddles with a bit and then leaves it alone, it
settles into repeated rhythms (though even then it changes eventually). the
phrases it generates are wide in range. a relatively large combinatorium of
phrases. generative or compositional? one can influence the generation,
though it might be hard to get it to reproduce a phrase exactly. yet it is
not simply generative; one can shape it compositionally.

durieu is one of the most brilliant programmers of net.art i have
encountered. birgé's sound is excellent, but it is durieu putting it all
together algorithmically. it is durieu determining the form and structure of
the music and the visuals, though i imagine birgé has input into this. but
so much happens in the act of writing that cannot be anticipated; that's
where it really takes shape.

Dear List Folks,

I think that PixelByPixel has much more interesting generative/compositional
possibilities than anything you are likely to find in Clauss or Strasser,
both of whose work I have written about and admire (s:
http://www.turbulence.org/curators/media2/strasser.htm , c:
http://turbulence.org/curators/Paris/claussenglish.htm ).

It requires not only a programmer but someone who likes to think of
'language' to create programming which opens up interesting
generative/compositional possibilities. You can see one of the roles of
'language' here: works that have rich generative/compositional possibs allow
the wreader to at least influence the concatenations/layers of sound and/or
visuals. But concatenations of what? And how are the layers structured? And
how are the concatenations arrived at? And the layering also? Together,
these schema form a kind of language of sound and/or visuals. When I listen
to PixelByPixel, part of what I listen for is the compositional range and
the nature of what is composed. Does it always sound the same? How much
range does it have? Is what it generates/allows composition of an
interesting type of sound? What is the conception of music therein? What is
the language of love?

So although there is no English language goin on here, the creative
investigation of sonic and visual language is actually rather sophisticated,
Komninos. For instance the musical language is a matter beyond timbre. It is
structural. A grammar.

You see, 'language' and our understanding of it is being transformed. In
large part because of the central role of language as a subject of study of
mathematics over the last seventy years (basically since Godel). When one
studies theoretical Computer Science, what one studies centrally are the
formal properties of language. One may ask whether computers are number
processing devices or language processing devices. The answer is that they
are profoundly both, and the profundity is in the connection between the
two.

Language is relevant to DNA and to all programmed processes, to all the
processes of life. And art. Consequently, poetry, which we associate with
intensest engagement with language, begins to move from what it has been
through these other languages and engagements. Poetry is the ghost in the
machine, moves through intensest engagement with language, which by now can
be quite other than what we have known as poetry.

could this be a strophe from "lilli marlen" ("vor der kaserne" lalala)?
writer of the original text was Hans Leip. but the passage you quote does
not seem to be in it.

best, h_



Does anyone know who wrote a poem containing the following lines, more or
less as in my faulty German:

Und nun ist kommen der krieg, der krieg (repeat three times?) wer wilt nun

Comes from WWI period and I vaguely remember seeing it in connection with
something about Joyce.

jim; this is an amazingly clear and helpful answer to all such
questions. i feel like forwarding it to my colleagues, my normy
poetry friends, etc., not in any spirit of polemical defense of
alterity but simply as a clear and "scientific" explanation of the
permeable borders of "language." thanks!

Thank you, Richard Taylor, and I do remember now the occasion, decades back=
,
on which I saw the poem in The Making of Ulysses. My German is adequate
enough to translate the poem literally as

And now comes the war (3x)
Now they are all soldiers, i.e., Now everyone=B9s a soldier
Soldiers must die.
Die they must.
Who will now kiss
My white body

Actually, =B3leib=B2 is body, =B3lieb=B2 is the adjective for =B3dear,=B2 from the noun
=B3liebe=B2 for love.

Bully for The Poetics List and gratitude to you.

Good piece, Aldon! Made me think also of James Baldwin ominous 1964 New
Yorker essay call to action, The Fire Next Time. Which is also a quote from
the Bible, right?  Indeed - not that Baldwin was trying to burn the country
down (to the contrary), but within the next two years, it was Detroit and
several other cities in various flames. Ironically some good Civil Rights
legislation emerged from it all - whether from non-violent or violent
actions, or the combination of both.
Ironically, George & Co.'s use of the 9-11 flame has been aggressively
oppressive on all fronts, I am afraid. 'Freedom' is just another word for
something to abuse.

Baldwin's book about the killer of black children in Atlanta is still the most important anyone has said about race recently.

by the way, wasn't Doestevsky a nationalist or a slavophile more than a religious conservative?  i see no way that someone who was dogmatically or prescriptively religious could imagine the voices he does.  basically he makes Tolstoy seem sentimental (even Christian, for chrissakes).

Dostoyevsky called himself a "doubter." I don't have the source with me
today, but when I read his biography a long time ago, a quote from a
letter that he had written stood out, and I will always remember it. It
said that he very much wanted to be a Christian and to have faith, but
he couldn't give himself over to complete, unquestioning faith. His
desire for faith seems to be what made him critical of the
intelligensia. He's wonderfully unresolved, so he's always in a position
of cutting right through ideological blinders.

Baldwin's book about the killer of black children in Atlanta is still
the most important anyone has said about race recently.

by the way, wasn't Doestevsky a nationalist or a slavophile more than a

Dostoevsky was not a religious conservative, he was a religious left. he
belonged to the religious left wing intelligentsia. While it is unthinkable
here in America it was the case in Russia (and it may still be). Organized
religion is purely political and it can position itself at any point on the
political spectrum, depending on its doctrines. It so happened in America
that American Christians support the doctrine of prosperity as the sign of
divine grace and thus flock together with the rich and powerful. If the
Christian groups who opposed the rich won historically they would have been
among the persecuted now, and on the extreme left.

Reviews of Books I like 177 Wilson Avenue


We returned from West Virginia with a Bearcat Scanner Radio from 1981. It
has only 50 channels, works perfectly, however, and keeps me in touch with
neighborhood doings. She knows where I am, SP 1 and 2.

Radio Shack in the US carries Police Call Frequency Guide: Codes, Maps,
Trunking. Grey vehicle with a white door. Stand by. The 2005 North-East
book (Volume 1) is 384 pages. Two shots fired from a blue Honda Civic
right around the corner from us. The book gives frequencies from police,
taxis, race-cars (?!), business, airports, etc.; it also gives police and
other codes so that one knows what's happening beyond the 104. Highly
recommended. I'm mentioning the book here because it's difficult to find
scanning lists off-line, and at least this computer interferes a bit.
Clearing the area of bystanders. 10-10 possible crime.

The Daily Practice of Painting, Gerhard Richter, Writings 1962-1003,
edited by Hans-Ulrich Obrist, MIT, 2002. Telephone alarm 145 Ocean Avenue,
fire in Apartment 30 on the third floor. The book is brilliant, and looser
than I'd expect; Richter is one of my favorite painters, one of the most
interesting still. There is much on specific series of works, photographs
of the painter, materials on aesthetics, and an anti-ideological position
which is spelled out in numerous ways. 1753. 10-4. Go with the numbers.
Highly recommended. He was strong-armed, punched in the face, and money
was taken.

Zen and the Ways, Trevor Leggett, Tuttle, 1988. This book, dissimilar to
many others on Zen, stresses Kamakura Zen, Kamakura Koans, with numerous
original texts. This was samurai zen, warrior zen, fierce and quick and
appealing. Nothing comes back on that plate, no records. The night
interview of the Nun Myotei is haunting. 246 Ferry Street, 724, Code 3,
male in the car not moving or breathing. There are sections on The Ways
and Texts of the Ways. It is night reading as well. 55 EMS. Material on
ri, ji, shin, ki; on the Jujutsu school Shin-no-Shin-To-Ryu, on the Itto
School, wonderful. Fight on the second floor.

Dispositions, McKenzie Wark, Salt, 2002. Of this more sometime later.
Smoke in the basement private dwelling. Additional 1014. Brooklyn to the
41, Westbound on Flatbush Ladder 159. Dispatcher 445. This work reminds me
of the best of Karl Kraus, Benjamin, what Baudrillard might have been. It
is organized by readings from a Garmin Etrex GPS device; each section is
headed by readouts representing the (primal) scene of its writing/birth.
The readouts include date, time, position (including altitude), and
accuracy. Negative K, might be in Manhattan. Pedestrian struck by
automobile near 63 Orchard Flatbush Avenue. The sections are intricate and
terse, turning around aesthetic, cultural, and sociological aporia.
Respond to box 1566. Smoke on the first floor multiple dwellings. There
are considerations of Kathy Acker, the Met, unfinished books, cities and
airports, codework, epistemology and punctuation. This is literally a
must-read for anyone interested in globality and its incursions. 10130,
459 Maple. I have to clear this up.

The Collected Poems of Kenneth Patchen, New Directions, 1968. I am
revisiting Patchen after all these years and Orange Bears and the poems
and other pieces are even more wonderful than I remember. Post 11. Stand
by for the next dispatch. You got a 757 with the K-9 Unit, Harry. Are you
all right over there? Right now I'm with the Chief Unit 100. Themes,
Miriam and love, Christ walking around and talking just like you or me,
are repeated, there are flowers and killings, and the intensity is
amazing. I found a long article on Patchen by Henry Miller; it's on the
Web if you search for it. Two male blacks with a black coats, fled toward
White Avenue on foot. Near Franklin and Bedford. 75 Victor at 1077 New
York Avenue. "I have but a bullet left / and there are so many things to
kill." I'm home again. Track fire on the David line, Coney-Island bound,
near Utrecht Avenue. Have a victim, cardiac, Franklin Avenue, seizure.

"Do you have a badge around your neck, like a real cop? That means you
pay." - This interrupting. 10-4.

Yuan Dao: Tracing Dao to Its Source, translated by D.C. Lau and Roger T.
Ames, Ballantine, 1998. Ames' introduction is brilliant. Which car,
Sergeant? Box with plastic wrapping on it, next to a hydrant. Corner of
President and Utica. This is an extremely important Taoist text, related
to Daodejing and Zhuangzi, stressing triggering, water symbolism,
accommodation, and the "Gerundical Dao." The text is short but requires a
great deal of time to absorb. Its style is equal to the others, although
it was written late second-century bce. Dispatchers on the 539, 739. I got
a 39. The text seems to me to be unique in its stressing of ecological
considerations; by virtue of the Dao, nature-ing. Oddly reminds one of
Marcus Aurelius. Open door on Henry.

Windows XP Annoyances For Geeks, David A. Karp, O'Reilly, 2004. This is an
update of a book already reviewed - but this is an entirely new work,
covering SP2 among other things. This may well be the best book available
on tuning. Injured skater up on Community. Have them come to door #6 on
the side of the building. Church fire. Broken down pickup truck. Recommend
an ATA for a 36. There is a lot here for geeks as well - VBS scripting for
automation, hardware troubleshooting, etc. Like the other O'Reilly books,
it's detailed in terms of how things work. 71 call for help. The book is
expensive, $34.95, but well worth it.

It's extremely cold out. The dispatcher _sieves, distributes, filters._
Redundancy's kept to a minimum. I find myself distracted by this internet
of the real, these vectors laid and relayed across the square mile that
constitutes my neighborhood. In the midst of a sentence, incoming; I'll
move it to the end.

Mind Hacks, Tips & Tools for Using Your Brain, Tom Stafford & Matt Webb,
O'Reilly 2005. By all means get this book, which is an absolutely unique
description of the working of the mind - in practical, hacking, terms,
with numerous Web references. Calls for help in Bushwick. The picture that
emerges is that of a dynamic brain which doesn't map or model digitally;
instead, it's a complex dialectic of frequencies, internal and external
stimuli, locations and transmuted locations, retinal and other imminent
learnings, etc. An accident by Bergen and Chancellor, possible 908. Don't
know if anyone was hurt. Private house with smoke. Negative, anonymous
caller who hung up. The hacks, by the way, are useful; I've incorporated
some of the ideas into virtual modeling. If I were teaching new media,
this is one of the books I'd use. All units stand by. 315. 315. Drifting
of snow is expected. Snow will begin to fall at twelve-hundred hours. Plan
A and Plan B emergencies.

Drama Contemporary, Germany, edited by Carl Weber, Johns Hopkins, 1996.
This has plays by Strauss, Tabori, Seidel, Pohl, Dorst, Jelinek, and
Muller. I particularly love the Muller and the Jelinek (who just won the
Nobel Prize for literature). Alpha zero three one six zero five five six
six nine two. The Jelinek was a revelation, amazing, related to Heidegger
and Arendt; after reading it, I read The Piano Teacher and Women as Lovers
and will eventually order the rest of her work. It is torrid, dry, Duras,
Beckett, Kraus, and amazing; the intensity drives it like Gillian Welch,
inescapable. All of the plays here are brilliant, believe it or not; I've
been missing out. 104 Montgomery Street, Washington and Franklin.
Jelinek's is Totenauberg (Death/Valley/Summit); Muller's is Mommsen's
Block; Tabori's is Mein Kampf.

A Theory of Fun for Game Design, Raph Koster, Paraglyph, 2005. What can I
say? This is exactly it. I don't have any units available for this job.
Supposed to be a private house. One item. Dispute. Call for help Greene
Avenue. This book reminds me of the late Wittgenstein, deceptively simple,
concerned with the habitus of game-play, expectation suites (my term),
player/human concerns within and without the game-world, and so forth.
I'll be using this for my own virtual work this summer; I recommend it as
a way of clarifying intent, structure, and phenomenology of one's work.
There is text only on the left-hand page, illustration on the right, but
the cost is relatively cheap at $23. Armed man. "Even if players can see
through fiction, the art of the game includes that fiction."

Islam in the Digital Age: E-Jihad, Online Fatwas and Cyber Islamic
Environments, Gary R. Bunt, Pluto, Critical Studies on Islam, 2003. The
kids live in the same building. Be advised. I will be reviewing this
elsewhere, and am reading it now; I wanted to mention it as a guide -
including a huge listing of websites - to online Islam. The book is oddly
careful and "nervous," perhaps for obvious reasons. A wide-range of
Islamic practices are described. Robber, first floor. The numbers for that
search. I think detailed work, along these lines, is necessary on all
fronts - it takes loose ideological cartels as beginning-points, and
examines practices within them - instead of, for example, beginning with
the "blog-structure" and proceeding out of it. Different forms of jihad
are described, including inner, greater, and lesser. There are sections on
9-11, Islamic diversity, Sunni Religious Authority, and so forth. 34 in
progress, male black choked. Missing female black, 11 years old, Charisma
D. wearing red shirt, cloak, coat, hat, and blue jeans, last seen this
morning. Please notify, anxious.

White Volkswagen, check conditions if you will. And check out Razorsmile
#3 - I always love this magazine, this one features chaos magick/tarot -
go to http://homepage.ntlworld.com/matt.lee7/razorsmile. Good writing by
Matt and Morrigan, whom (who?) some of you may know. Accompanying cd-rom.
Habitual runaway. Second floor.

Figure Skating for Dummies, Kristi Yamaguchi, IDG, 1997. This is one of
the best guides ever to the sport; I could well have used this during the
Tonya Harding / Nancy Kerrigan debacle. For all sorts of reasons, I'm
fascinated by Figure Skating; this is the best guide I've seen. Lighten up
Frank. Don't call me Frank. Figure Skating is the "knot" between sports
and the social, and the "knot" among issues of gender, muscle, creativity,
restraint, intelligence. It plays out among all of them; in a sense, every
event is an essay. 1403 New York Avenue. 1085. That unit.

The Aryan Christ, The Secret Life of Carl Jung, Richard Nol, Random House,
1977. I'm fascinated by this work on Jung's spiritual interests and
associations. Corrected address 3025 Ocean Avenue. 169. 64 Woodhaven
Westbound. Thin build, 5' 4", 130 pounds, she has brown hair, brown eyes,
wears glasses, 13 years old. I've always found Jung both fascinating and
problematic, veering towards the Aryan imaginary; this book goes a way in
explanation. I've read this "out of context," not "being" a Jungian, so I
have no other critical guidance than my own sparse understanding. But I do
recommend this, if only for the sources - for that matter, I tend to
believe in its findings. I've got him out on the -. Oklahoma plates.

Godey's Lady's Book, 1866, edited by Sarah Hale. Godey's was the most
popular 19th-century woman's magazine in the United States; it ran from
the early part of the century until 1898. Sarah Hale, an early and
problematic feminist, edit it for most of its life. 12827. The
illustrations are found ripped out and framed in numerous antique shops;
on the other hand, if you can find a full issue, purchase it; the reading
is excellent and one might learn more about 19th-century daily life from
it, than any other source. There are stories, book reviews, poetry, all of
interest. Mobilization point is the gas station on Auburn Street. She's
was wearing red and black sneakers. Should I pick up my dog yet.
(Something tells me I've already reviewed this and a few others - but I
can't find the reviews anywhere. In my mind, then, perhaps, or perhaps you
know better.)

Prayer Book for Sabbath and Festivals, Translated and Annotated with an
Introduction by Philip Birnbaum, Hebrew Publishing Company, New York,
1950. I've wanted to write on the Siddur for a while now, and this seems
like an excellent standard edition. You need to respond to the second
floor. Information is available upon request. There are notes and
alternative readings. The Siddur is the heart of Orthodox daily practice;
like all religious texts, there are ideological embeddings, subtexts, etc.
I hope to do at least a partial deconstructive reading of the work. In
general - with any number of religions - prayers are rarely analyzed; even
with Shinto, while the Norita have been translated, actual practice and
texts are rarely described. (I'm sure there are technical journals with
such information, but it's not readily available.)

Jeans, red hat, red coat. The Collected Verse of Lewis Carroll, Macmillan,
1933. Includes illustrations. I understand Deleuze's fascination. The work
is not only beautiful; it's almost literally indescribable. What seems
simple really isn't - He used to live in the building, doesn't live there
any more, hangs around there. Michael Maldenado, hispanic, mustache,
short hair, they call him Sparko, walk down Bergen Street. That was a big
word there, I got you. 10-4 Good Night. There are issues of capital,
technology, reworked nature, all at play; even nonsense is self-critiqued;
the pieces reference each other; oddly enough, the children are hardly
present. Charley's requesting a sergeant. Then there are the erotics of
his photography; check out Alison Smith, editor, Exposed: The Victorian
Nude, Watson-Guptill, New York.

It continues to be difficult to focus. TD involved in an MDA. There are
sirens outside the window uncorrelated with the scanner background sirens.
311 fire location. I think I'm letting you down, that these reviews aren't
up to the usual, that centripetal daily life interferes, exhales. Every
apartment is a lockdown. Bush spreads freedom while our jail population,
mainly "minority," is well over two million. Spread the jails around the
world - more money for corporate usa. 111 Police Boulevard. Confirmed
fifteen-year-old habitual runaway.

To be reviewed: Phyllis Chesler, The new Anti-Semitism: The Current Crisis
and What We Must Do About It; Tony Northrup and Eric Faulkner, Home
Hacking Projects for Geeks; Frances Crosby, Poems of a Blind Girl. He's
not answering. 37 George. Disregard, disregard. Disregard that. Family
dispute. 3214 Beverly Road. 10-4. Altercation. Automatic alarm at the
mall. Ex-boyfriend fighting there, destroying the house, 2143, code 3.

Your Irvingness

It's the only of those literary type questions I have ever been able to
answer! And it was thru happenstance - when you first asked - I thought -
that rings a bell -was it written by the ubiquitous Monsieur Comrad
Sondheim, or Comrad Herr George Bowering? - but then I thought - no! don't
be
silly Richard 4 (stop being or trying to be Pessoa - says Richard 48) - its
from something about Joyce  - I have read The Dubliners and Portrait (both
as a teenager  and more recently in my dotage read them again and Ulysees
but I only really liked the first three chapters and the last three of that
book - and was thinking of tackling Joyce again  - I was completely
dumbfounded by all that stuff about Shakespeare etc....) ) but then I
realized last night at about 2 am I had the book - it is actually called
"James Joyce and The Making of Ulysses" by Frank Budgeon in the other room -
I realize that Krieg is / was war and also possibly game (Chess has been
likened to war I am a keen chess nutter and I used to play Kriegspiel (Chess
when one player has only the black pieces and the other has the white etc)
and last night my ("son in law") Gerhardt asked my grandson to give Oppa  a
"Kuss" I think it was and he apparently kissed the phone!!)  - I wish Budgen
had translated it - those old guys they all knew Greek and Latin and Italian
and German and so on - at least Pound repeats things - lol) I did a year of
Spanish - years ago  - 1992 - three years of Latin (1962 -1965) - still just
know a few things  - and learnt Samoan about 1972 - there are a lot of
Samoans here so I could practice that language  more easily O le a le mea
lea? Fia oe?  ~ What is
that? Are you hungry ? (lol - it has other interpretations I'm rusty even on
Samoan -never was fluent!)) - once and picked up scraps of German and French
and Maori -its amazing - my friend who is sixty  five years old and has
never left NZ knows not even one Maori word !! Not even the name of  a
famous tree called the pohutukawa which is incredibly beautiful in summer
with jewel-like flowers..doesn't know what it is -its a Maori tree to him I
suppose:
my son hates Maori - calls them and other Polynesians by derogatory terms
(they are called 'bungas' or 'coconuts' ) but that is common  - racism I
mean (often just from omission rather than any active racism although there
are some real madmen here  who are very racist...)) -amongst the working
class here )) unless it is already in the NZ language -some (words) are !!
there are a lot of kiwis like that - working class mostly, I must concede
(nor do they ever attempt to pronounce Maori properly - its almost a point
of - a real thing   - for them to NOT pronounce Maori or take any interest
in
Maori stuff etc -not that I know much myself even though my neighbour is a
Maori and so on -  but I know some words) - but really only know one
language - English and I don't know that very well - amazing how people can
speak so many languages like Joyce (but Joyce turned his back on the
"indigenous" stuff in Ireland -no?), or Pierre Joris etc - I found the poem
quite beautiful translated - reminds me of - although I think he is a
greater poet -of some of the poems of the very great British poet Keith
Douglas - not that there is any stylistic similarity - just something in the
tone  - although Douglas liked war - its hard to say where or whether he
"protests" war and he is  the strange case of a great modern writer  -who
died very young: just at the end of the war - who wrote in rhyme and fairly
strict metre -

Its the poem in which he finds a dead German soldier and there is a note
from his girl friend in German in his pocket - it says something like
"forget me not" which is the title of quite a great novel by Joyce Carol
Oates who is
Senor D Baratier's favourite writer and poet [ no it isn't,  actually the
book is called: "You Must Remember This"] - Douglas (to return to Douglas)
is usually unsentimental and even seems hard or harsh but he's an incredible
poet - "How to Kill" is terrible - disturbing and clinical but awesome....
Joyce hated war and violence which is probably a good way to be: I feel the
only war justified is one of defence of one's nation - meaning in a sense
self-defence - all other war is monstrous - Bush, Rice, Cheney, Rumsford,
Blair, Helen Clark (NZ is involved don't believe otherwise) and so on etc
should all be tried for War Crimes......put in cells and forced to read that
poem by Felix Beran over and over every day !!!

But Joyce turned his back to war and violence - he was a gentle "traitor" -
lol - just joking....

I am pleased to able to assist...

Richard Taylor

PS I see "Spiel" has hundreds of meanings around "play" etc in my big
battered German dictionary....one of the "gross" of  "battered books"

Thank you, Richard Taylor, and I do remember now the occasion, decades back,
on which I saw the poem in The Making of Ulysses. My German is adequate
enough to translate the poem literally as

And now comes the war (3x)
Now they are all soldiers, i.e., Now everyon a soldier
Soldiers must die.
Die they must.
Who will now kiss
My white body

Actually, ³leib² is body, ³lieb² is the adjective for ³dear,² from the noun
³liebe² for love.

Bully for The Poetics List and gratitude to you.

ha, happy to make some sense for a change! it seems like quite a long-term
thing, doesn't it. i mentioned godel's work from the thirties in
mathematics/logic, and that is a kind of major transition point concerning
our understanding of language, having, as it does, relation with the later
development of computers and their impact on approaches to and uses of
language (not to mention the epistemological consequences of godel's work
concerning the limits of knowledge via his incompleteness theorems). but,
also, in poetry, oulipo and language poetry are both (aren't they?), to some
extent, dealing with permeable and expanding borders of language not solely
within the field of poetry but in response to some sort of awareness that
the fusion of language and number into information has been completely
destabilizing the "borders of "language"". On the extreme end, there seem to
be quite a few contemporary physicists who believe that, basically, there is
no matter but that, instead, somehow it is all information, it's all kind of
universal machine poetry, dynamo with a big o.

Subject:      PROTEST notes from DC inauguration...

Went down to DC with my friends Matt and Nicole
to protest at the inauguration celebration, and
those notes are here:  http://phillysound.blogspot.com

One of the things that's really bugging me though is
the continued support of Hillary Clinton.  While driving
back to Philly from DC we were listening to Air America,
or whatever that new left radio show is.  And I like the
show for the most part, and am very glad it exists, but
I just can't get over how many pardons Clinton gets!

She looks good from a distance, but then you see her
in documentaries about Wall Mart and Sam Walton and
she's making statements like, "What a GREAT American
Sam Walton is!"  And a chill goes shooting up the spine!

NOT to mention the fact that SHE SAID she was going
to stand beside Boxer on January 6th to contest the
election results, but then backed down.  As did Obama,
Kennedy, Kerry(!) and others.  But Boxer came through,
and it was nice seeing the pro Boxer signs at the protest.

The Democrats are such a pack of cowards!  And to be
honest I expected to see some pro Clinton signs at the
protest in DC, but I didn't see a single one.  It was all the
people on the radio on the drive home that made me crazy,
talking about the inauguration, and how they wish it was
Hillary Clinton being inaugurated.

I'm NOT saying Hillary Clinton would have gone into Iraq,
I'm just saying she's not the Messiah so many want her
to be.  Let's replay the images of her APPLAUDING Bush
not too long ago during his speech about the Patriot Act
and invading Iraq.  She DIDN'T HAVE TO applaud.  There
were no applause police there making her applaud.  And
Ted Kennedy sat there with his arms folded, but yet, still
I say, WHERE WAS TED on January 6th!?

Anyway, I'm so sick of Hillary Clinton, and I'm not convinced
she's any less a lying politician than her heart attack husband.

The Billion Freedoms

Yes, then, always, as the rain, a star,
Or snow, the snow, snow,
Faces in the village, many dead on the roads
Of Europe, guns, go, yell, fall, O wait, what
Does life do, I know, knew, go mad, life goes
Mad, as the gentle rain, run, as the cold death
Comes into, into you, into the
Star-being man, is it quiet, quiet in the ground,
I grin, gunned silly, noble, it is noble to be part
Of, of the lie, it is a lie, war is, war is a lie,
What else is war, war is also a lie, love is not
A lie, love is greater, O love is greater
Than war, wake my brothers, love is not a, lie,
Live, as the earth, as the, sun,
Stand in the beautiful, be, as the clean, full, fine,
Strong lives stood, hated, mocked, despised, drowned
In the sewers of poverty,
And in the sewers of State, as Christ was, for
He believed in life,
He believed in love, and in death, war, and greed,
He did not believe, and any man who speaks
Of a Christian war, or of war as the savior
Of anything, that man is a liar, and
A, murderer, for no man can acquire position,
Or goods, or self righteousness
In a lie, except he be himself an enemy of truth,
And life, and God,
And a defiler in the temple of his kind, faces
in the villages of the world, millions dead
On the roads in Europe, what sin against reason
Is this, that they fought, fight, in a war
To save the evils
That cause war, for war is no evil
To those who have warred against the people,
And against truth, always, what crime
Against the soul of man is this, this fraud,
This mockery of life, that what is cheapest,
And dirtiest, and most debased, is thus smugly
Stamped on the forehead of, Christ, Who said,
Says, in the authority of God, thou shalt not
Kill, or take from another, O what are men
For, or God, now, as the light, and the good,
And the truth, and the love of one poor creature
For his fellow, fall, and the grandeur
Of mankind, like a blind snake,
Crawls, on its belly, into the slimy
pit of oblivion, yes, then, always, as the rain,
A star, or as a fire burning forever in, all men.

OAF OF OFFICE
Thursday, January 20, 2005
by Greg Palast

Watching John Kerry lip-synch the oath of office, I couldn't help
wondering, 'what if.'

Here on stage in Washington was the winner-class warmed and protected
by cashmere and tax cuts against the strange, nipple-chilling cold.
Hell had frozen over.

 Our President said, "It is the policy of the United States to seek
and support the growth of democratic movements and institutions in
every nation." Well, no, it isn't.

Our President said, "We will widen retirement savings and health
insurance." No, he won't.

Our President said, "America will not pretend that jailed dissidents
prefer their chains." Yes, he will.

Our President said, "And our country must abandon all the habits of
racism." Oh, sure.

He doesn't believe a single word he's saying. And all over America,
everyone knows he's lying and America is truly relieved.

America doesn't want to give up the habit of racism. Karl Rove
doesn't. Jeb Bush doesn't. If not for challenging hundreds of
thousands of voters in Black precincts of Ohio and other swing states,
if not for purging thousands more from voter rolls for the crime of
voting while Black, you wouldn't be president now, would you, Mr.
President?

You won't "pretend that jailed dissidents prefer their chains," unless
they are chained by your buck-buddies in Saudi Arabia.

You'll "support democratic movements" so long as the citizens of
Venezuela don't get carried away and decide that democracy means they
can choose a leader you don't like.

And you'll "widen Social Security and health insurance"? Who are you
kidding? I just got a doctor bill for $5,200 =E2=80=A6 should I send it to =
you
at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue?

You said, "You have seen that life is fragile, and evil is real, and
courage triumphs." What you meant was, "Courage is fragile and real
evil triumphs." Indeed your entire campaign was about American
cowardice: "they" are coming to get us. Americans, scared for their
lives, soiled their underpants and waddled to the polls crying,
"Georgie, save us!"

Franklin Roosevelt said in his inaugural, "We have nothing to fear but
fear itself." But he didn't have Dick Cheney creating from his bunker
a government which is little more than a Wal-Mart of Fear: midnight
snatchings of citizens for uncharged crimes, wars to hunt for
imaginary weapons aimed at Los Angeles, DNA data banks of kids and
grandmas, the Chicken Little sky-is-falling social security
spook-show, and shoe-searches in airports. Fear is your only product.

In another world, in which all votes are counted, J.F. Kerry would
have gathered most of those arcane chits called "electoral votes" and
would have taken that oath today.

But, dear Reader, there's one cold statistic Kerry voters must face.
The fact that Republicans monkeyed with the votes in swing states
doesn't wash away that big red stain: 59 million Americans marched to
the polls and voted for George W. Bush.

If bin Laden doesn't scare you, THAT should.=20

Because if 59 million Americans agreed with George Bush that every
millionaire's son, like him, shouldn't have to pay inheritance taxes;
that sucking up to Saudi petrocrats constitutes a foreign policy; that
killing Muslims in Mesopotamia will make them less inclined to kill us
in Manhattan; that turning over social security to the casino
operators that gave us Enron, WorldCom and world depression is smart
economics; then, fine, Mr. Bush deserves the job. But most Americans,
bless'm, don't actually believe any of that hokum. YET MOST STILL
VOTED FOR HIM!

What we witnessed on November 2, 2004 was a 59-million strong army of
pinheads on parade ready to gamble away their social security so long
as George Bush makes sure that boys kill each other, not kiss each
other; who feel right proud that our uniformed services can kick some
scrawny brown people in the ass in some far off place when we're mad
and can't find Osama; who can't bring themselves to vote for a guy
with a snooty Boston accent who's never been to a NASCAR tractor pull
and who certainly thinks anyone who does is a low-Q beer-burping
blockhead. And they are.

Today we witnessed more than the coronation of some privileged little
munchkin of mendacity. It is the triumphal re-occupation of our nation
by nitwits who think Ollie North's a hero not a conman, who can't name
their congressman, who believe that Saddam Hussein and Osama bin Laden
were going steady, who can't tell Afghanistan from Souvlaki-stan.
Bloated with lies and super-size fries, they clomped to the polls 59
million strong to vent their small-minded little hatreds on us all.

When I looked today at the oaf of office, I could not shake the
feeling that this election was an intelligence test that America
flunked.

Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1

   Words are seals of the mind, results -- or, more correctly, stations -=
- of
an infinite series of experiences, which reach from an unimaginably dista=
nt
past into the present ... They are the 'audible that clings to the
inaudible'...  =

   The essential nature of words is therefore neither exhausted by their
present meaning, nor is their importance confined to their usefulness as
transmitters of thoughts and ideas, but they express at the same time
qualities which are not translatable into concepts -- just as a melody wh=
ich,
though it may be associated with a conceptual meaning, cannot be describe=
d by
words or by any other medium of expression.  And it is just that irration=
al
quality which stirs up our deepest feelings, elevates our innermost being=
, and
makes it vibrate with others. =

   The magic which poetry exerts upon us, is due to this quality and the
rhythm combined therewith.  It is stronger than what the words convey
objectively -- stronger even than reason with all its logic, in which we
believe so firmly ...
   If art can be called the re-creation and formal expression of reality
through the medium of human experience, then the creation of language may=
 be
called the greatest achievement of art.  Each word originally was a focus=
 of
energies, in which the transformation of reality into the vibrations of t=
he
human voice -- the vital expression of the human soul -- took place.

Thanks for this quote, Jon, and I meant to thank you for the other quote from
Yeats which I thought about for some time. I particularly like this, many things
in it--each word a focus of energies, that irrational quality, that infinite series,
seals of the mind--resonate with me and I'll keep thinking about this quote too,
so thanks,

best,

My thanks to Rebecca Seiferle for her response.  (The Yeats quote she ref=
ers
to actually was posted to another list than poetics.  If anyone's interes=
ted
in it I'll send it here too.)

Trying to think through the Govinda remarks:

If this view of poetry is correct, then poetry must be defined as the art=

whose material is utterance, and utterance must be taken in the strict se=
nse: =

words physically spoken aloud.  This in turn implies that if someone writ=
es a
text on the assumption that others are going to read it silently, that te=
xt
cannot be considered poetry, just as, if someone writes a musical score, =
not
as something for musicians to play, but as something for readers of score=
s to
examine visually, then that production cannot reasonably be considered mu=
sic. =

And this implies that most of the poetry being written in English today,
really isn't.

The above view of poetry may seem eccentric and extreme, but through much=
 of
human history it would have been too obvious to need saying.  The idea th=
at
what a poem really is, is the text that embodies it, is a modern inventio=
n,
which to much of past culture would have seemed as weird as the idea that=
 what
Beethoven's Fifth Symphony really is, is the score to it.  The degenerati=
on of
poem into text is the great source of the failure of poetry in our time.

The Anti-Empire Report, No. 17
By WILLIAM BLUM





They hang the man and flog the woman
That steal the goose from off the common,
But let the greater villain loose
That steals the common from the goose.

".....at a time when I am speaking to you about the paradox of desire -- in
the
sense that different goods obscure it -- you can hear outside the awful
language
of power.  There's no point in asking whether they are sincere or
hypocritical,
whether they want peace of whether they calculate the risks.  The dominating
impression as such a moment is that something that may pass for a prescribed
good; information addresses and captures impotent crowds to whom it is poured

forth like a liquor that leaves them dazed as they move toward the slaughter
house.
One might even ask if one would allow the cataclysm to occur without first
giving
free reign to this hubbub of voices...."

|||JIM
|||I think that PixelByPixel has much more interesting
|||generative/compositional
|||possibilities than anything you are likely to find in Clauss or =
Strasser,
|||both of whose work I have written about and admire (s:
|||http://www.turbulence.org/curators/media2/strasser.htm , c:
|||http://turbulence.org/curators/Paris/claussenglish.htm ).

*KOMNINOS
i disagree, but then i'm not a programmer, and can't appreciate its
programming qualities like you can.
Your writings about clauss, strasser and durieu are structural analyses =
of
the code and their construction.
You see a work and ask how was it done, i see a work and ask what has it
done to me?


|||It requires not only a programmer but someone who likes to think of
|||'language' to create programming which opens up interesting
|||generative/compositional possibilities.=20

However a programmer uses a vocabulary that has been chosen from =
language, a
small chunk of language, strictly defines the meaning of each word in =
the
vocabulary removing ambiguity, and then constructs a world that is =
totally
defined and predictable.=20


You can see one of the roles of
|||'language' here: works that have rich generative/compositional =
possibs
|||allow
|||the wreader to at least influence the concatenations/layers of sound
|||and/or
|||visuals.=20

*K
Like de saussere, who separated language from life, programming has
separated out its language from life. We can not assume programming =
language
is synonymous with language in life, or use these word interchangeably.
Certainly this work allows the end-user to interact and have influence =
on
the visuals and aurals and their combinations, and we don't see the code
(most of us, you probably do) but if we watch it long enough, because of =
the
defined nature of the meaning of the code, it will become predictable =
and
totally understandable. Something that can't be said of language in =
life.

|||But concatenations of what? And how are the layers structured?
|||And
|||how are the concatenations arrived at? And the layering also? =
Together,
|||these schema form a kind of language of sound and/or visuals. When I
|||listen
|||to PixelByPixel, part of what I listen for is the compositional range =
and
|||the nature of what is composed. Does it always sound the same? How =
much
|||range does it have? Is what it generates/allows composition of an
|||interesting type of sound? What is the conception of music therein? =
What
|||is
|||the language of love?
|||So although there is no English language going on here, the creative
|||investigation of sonic and visual language is actually rather
|||sophisticated,

*K=20
i am aware of the poly semiotic nature of interpretation afforded in =
this
new medium, and as you point out your familiarity with the aural signs =
are
more sophisticated than mine. My sign system of preference is textual.

|||Komninos. For instance the musical language is a matter beyond =
timbre. It
|||is
|||structural. A grammar.

*K
Once again i'm not such a huge fan of adoring how things work. And being =
a
poet grammar was always the enemy.
=20
|||
|||You see, 'language' and our understanding of it is being transformed. =



*K
i do see how our understanding of language is being transformed, but =
here
you are talking of language as a system of communication, and our system =
of
communication, and we, realise the importance of the many different =
semiotic
systems in interpreting language and life.


In
|||large part because of the central role of language as a subject of =
study
|||of
|||mathematics over the last seventy years (basically since Godel). When =
one
|||studies theoretical Computer Science, what one studies centrally are =
the
|||formal properties of language. One may ask whether computers are =
number
|||processing devices or language processing devices. The answer is that
|||they
|||are profoundly both, and the profundity is in the connection between =
the
|||two.

*K
This is exactly my point, programming makes language a mathematical =
formula,
and it is not.

|||
|||Language is relevant to DNA and to all programmed processes, to all =
the
|||processes of life. And art.

*K
i would say life is relevant to all languages.

And i would say life is relevant all art.

|||Consequently, poetry, which we associate with
|||intensest engagement with language, begins to move from what it has =
been
|||through these other languages and engagements. Poetry is the ghost in =
the
|||machine, moves through intensest engagement with language, which by =
now
|||can
|||be quite other than what we have known as poetry.

My original question was,
> Please explain how you see the poetry in this, there are no letters, =
no
> words, written or sounded to want to make me interpret this work in a
> textual way.
> The piece is engaging, but i would have a hard time calling it
> music, visual
> art, or poetry.



*K=20
i leave you with two quotes from your own interview with durieu;

"A poem is a text that procures you poetry if you read it. The code I'm
trying to write is a text that procures you poetry if a computer reads =
it
for you...."


"I like the power of mathematics.=20

But i always try to hide this aspect in my work.

Mathematics is only an easy tool to build all my toys.

(I say toy and not game because I don't like applications where you need =
to
win.)"

MIME-Version: 1.0

Codework Self-Negated


If not for self-negation, codework remains within formal structures,
broken, chaotic, or otherwise. It's semantics that opens up the universe
of discourse; at the same time, semantics shuts down or bypasses the
structures. The problematization of language rises by itself as
symbolically or indexically generated; the ikonic fades, varies from
workstation to workstation. The work of the viewer lies not in the
decipherment of the structure, but within the assemblage of insistent
content through and in spite of the structure. Anything else resonates
with already tried and tired conceptualist attitudes, where teleology
tended towards perfection, and the horizon was a closed set of usually
well-defined, often countable, elements. In every case, energy and habitus
are required for creation, sustaining, transmission; this is necessarily a
substructural contamination that forms illicit ties with the semantics,
feeds into it. Not a closed universe of discourse, then, but a holarchic
sememe or neural structuring that opens elsewhere with axons tending the
real, i.e. the stewardship of the real. Thus codework becomes a model of
universal political economy, complete with filtering, censorship,
distribution, equivalencies, duplications - but also cries, wars, fucks,
furies, talks sought and talks returned.

Second to the extent that meaning is always already a construct, neither
scaffold nor sememic tissue are construed from transcendence, i.e., agency
is necessary for the completion of a circuit which may or may not occur.
Agency always produces circuitry. The habitus creates decipherment in any
case, formal or informal, skeletal or meat-driven. So it is a question of
history and the history of agency. The self-negation of codework occurs
within this history and this agency. The self-negation is an aesthetic
drive occasioned by the work, largely subconscious. The decipherment
results in a hardening of meaning, just as a riddle is hardened by its
solution. Of codework there is no solution. Of cries, wars, fucks, furies,
talks sought and talks returned, there is no solution.

There is no solution of meaning, nothing to be wagered, at stake, nothing
granted. Meaning stumbles through the code of the codework, meaning is the
vegetable of the mineral code, the production of the animal in the twenty
questions of the riddle. Animal, vegetable, mineral, all are contaminated
by agency. Agency does not resolve. Self-negation is parasitic, the
construct of unrepentant, unresolved agency. The content is the chaotic
mix. Structure sits at the bar, content the blood-stain on the floor. The
crime of codework: meaning oozes. It needs the hydraulics of the code. It
is of the code, attaches itself to the sememe. Contamination of the
sememe: the sememe. The content and meaning of codework is contamination.
The riddle is resonant. Unresolved contamination cries, fucks, furies,
talks, expends, empties.

into the following poem of my own:

When you are bald

When you are bald and old, and what's not bald is gray,
And fine firm muscle flops in rolls of fat
Beneath your yellowed, liver-spotted skin;
When loud, wet, wracking coughs begin your day
And wheezing weakness often knocks you flat
While constant tremors waggle every chin;
When rheumy eyes and short-term memories fail
To conjure names of relatives or friends,
And you no longer smell the smell of stale
Old urine leaking out of your Depends;
When all your teeth are gone, and Jello ends
Up drooling from your lips in a bubbling trail;
When only hope of death soothes your distress
My passion for you won't be one whit less.

N.B. i would add to the following that, after years of research, that
out of the 3 ot the 6 listed as having an "overall mega-stategy of
growth" that only 1 can be considered a fatal threat, or more a tool,
with bad intentions and detriment to intellectuals, freethought and
expression, society and culture as a whole and has served as a
destructive force whose bait was and is self-indulgence and supremacy
within every society it has "penetrated".


"Four years ago, Wagner set out to research six groups and their
missiological strategies for growth: the Assemblies of God denomination,
homosexuals, Jehovah’s Witnesses, Mormons, Muslims and the Southern
Baptist Convention. Further into his research, he discovered that only
three of the six had an overall mega-strategy of growth –- homosexuals,
Mormons and Muslims."



Prof sets forth ‘How Islam Plans to Change the World’
By Lauri Arnold
Jan 19, 2005

MILL VALLEY, Calif. (BP)--In the weeks and months that followed Sept.
11, 2001, churches across America reported a high increase in the number
of attendees -- and so did mosques across America.

“9/11 was a wakeup call. Suddenly people began to say, ‘What is Islam?’
and it was quite amazing after 9/11 that Muslims began saying, ‘Come to
the mosque and find out what Islam is,’” said William Wagner, professor
of missions at Golden Gate Theological Seminary and author of “How Islam
Plans to Change the World,” a new book from Kregel Publications.

Wagner writes in his book that Islam has grown in America as a result of
a detailed strategy that was already in place long before radical
Islamists associated with Osama Bin Laden perpetrated the tragedies of
Sept. 11.

“Islam is a world religion with a well-defined culture and a developed
strategy for taking control of the world,” Wagner writes in the preface
of the book.

One example Wagner noted was that those who went to the mosques
following Sept. 11 were told that Islam “is a religion of peace, love
and forgiveness and that there were few real terrorists in their faith,”
as Wagner put it. “They did such a convincing job that some converted
and others became vocal supporters of tolerance for Islam in their
communities.”

Four years ago, Wagner set out to research six groups and their
missiological strategies for growth: the Assemblies of God denomination,
homosexuals, Jehovah’s Witnesses, Mormons, Muslims and the Southern
Baptist Convention. Further into his research, he discovered that only
three of the six had an overall mega-strategy of growth –- homosexuals,
Mormons and Muslims. Even further into his research, Wagner became more
impressed with the strategy that had long been expressed and set in
motion by Islamic leaders.

Two of Wagner’s students at Golden Gate, both native Arabic speakers,
were able to read well-accepted Arabic newspapers and magazines from the
Middle East and then relate to Wagner what was being written. This
coincided with Wagner’s own research and direct discussions with Islamic
leaders.

“So much of my book is not saying, ‘This is what I as a Christian say
they are doing or they are going to do,” Wagner said. “It’s a book
saying it’s what they say they’re going to do and what they are doing.”

Part of Wagner’s research included reading documents of Islamic
strategies, such as Ayatollah Khomeini’s “Islamic Government.”

“In reading Khomeini’s Islamic Government, one has a tendency to compare
it to Adolph Hitler’s ‘Mein Kampf’,” Wagner writes. “Both state clearly
their grand ideas of world conquest, but people today do not take such
writings seriously. The key difference between the two is that Hitler
was an atheist while Khomeini claimed to be a man of God.”

Wagner identifies three specific tools that are utilized today in order
to keep the overall Islamic strategy in place and ultimately advance the
spread of the faith: jihad (holy war), da’wah (missions) and the
building of mosques. Wagner said now he also identifies immigration as a
fourth tool that is used, though it is not included in the book.

Wagner noted that it may seem strange to some people that the Muslim
faith is growing, both in America and beyond in light of the faith’s
link with Sept. 11, but he said the faith is growing “because they know
what they are doing.”

“I think that we need to be aware that they really are a threat to us
and that if we don’t wake up, one of these days it is going to be too
late.”

How Islam Plans to Change the World is written from a missiological
perspective rather than a theological one, Wagner noted, and it serves
as a warning for the Christian church of the “clash of civilizations”
that is already taking place between Islam and the West.

Though the book is not meant to be a condemnation of Islam, Wagner is
unapologetic about his ultimate answer to the threat posed by Islam,
since God has already revealed that Jesus Christ will be victorious in
the end. In the concluding chapter of his book, Wagner writes, “The real
antidote for the problems before us is clear. Let’s become much more
active in living out our Christian faith and proclaiming the truth as
found in Jesus Christ.”

Warner spent 32 years as a missionary with the Southern Baptist
Convention’s International Mission Board in Europe, the Middle East and
Northern Africa, including 12 years as a chairman of the Muslim
Awareness Committee of the European Baptist Federation.

peace richard,


lawrence?

i am not the one you should be addressing. for i would never fall behind
the recent COP out on civil discussion by accusing dessenters of being
either,
drug addicts, homophobes, anti-jewish, terrorist, reverse racist,
paranoids, insane or just plan muslim.

you'd have to talk to the regular amerikkkacentric hate clique pos(t)ers
who flood this list with bad art/poetry and mpegs used as supremacist
propoganda.


call a cop, dude!!! i am shocked at the crass hackism which gets posted
onto this list which i thought was supposed to be about poetry (once and
intelligent political and social voice of innovation and flex) yet
serves more for the prupose of a group of anti-intellectual bigots who
shamelessly flubbed their unILLness in the mastery of flow and hide
behind, recently, jewishness (and ADL tactricks) -- and even talkin down
on greater master flexologist they will can't hope to change a towel
roll for at roadside motel, as a last felled attempt to COP some cred
with the publishing world and few blue haired packed open mic events.

ain't sayin no names, naw

of course they feel this is a good way to hide their ignorance when
concerning topics from iraq, blacks and muslims and why they can't flow
-- b.u.t. bad verse is bad verse.

...and as the verse goes in the sign i fly in this here version --
'they are just those who pass on what is heard and most of them are
liars/and the poets and deviators follow them;'

you know who you are

i don't think that there is anything wrong with someone who calls
themself a "poet" to have passion concerning the world, the word and
social injustice.
b.u.t. i know, so it looks and susan sontag has written and uttered til
her last breath -- peace and blessings,

"The conversation among writers that takes place in the last 20 years is
for the most part just like the conversation of any other professional
people on the make. They could just as well be advertising executives or
businesspeople, or anything else. They talk about income and they talk
about the comforts or lack of comforts of their personal lives, and --
but that's a kind of -- if I think back on my own life, the single most
amazing phenomenon is the discrediting of idealism."

we don't got and will never have anymore genets, rambauds, burroughs,
vidals, eliots, duchamps, tzaras, p.smiths (ar heart she is muslim),
karen finlays, jim carrols,  j baldwins, chuck d's, barakas, rza's, mos
def's, easton eliots, r.wrights, w.c.williams. wnada colemans,
tennesses, selby jrs, dave alvins, cervenkas, d. coopers, wildes,
audens, xaviers, j cortez , shariatis or hammetts

i think it's all over or as sontag said;  "Nobody has to be a writer.
Print culture may be under siege, but there has been an enormous
inflation in the number of books printed, and very few of these could be
considered part of literature. ... Unlike what has been said here
before, for me the primary obligation is human solidarity."-- Susan
Sontag 1933 - 2004

so what we get is not the good works, good deeds or action b.u.t. a few
hacks using suntzu to canel out competition for dumbed down despearte
audience who are starved for anything somewhat readable that they have
been told will not draw attention, however, will tow the party line and
all seem oh so so cool.
this is the metaphor of invasion-- it's not tha democracy is better or
that the invaders/crusaders are good or have superior culture or peoples
which serve the good -- it's that they have p.r.  = guns -- and can
cancel out the competition. therefore, offering no choice to the
underwhelmed audience overwhelmed by brutality.

literary globalization of hack amerikkkcentrick thought (how i learned
to stop flowin and being da bomb).

I think you are saying I have a right to exaggerate a little because - I
think -like you - I feel  - that this American -imperialist invasion is
racist -it is as well as being a lot of other things - it is masterminded by
fascists - - I am not a Muslim or on drugs  - this was meant  go to Lawrence
or the list - I stick to my passion (yes I am sick - I bleed - and this
killing was started by the US not the Iraqis) - I feel there is a lack of
courage in fighting this evil that walks the world now- I don't mean we all
have to go and get killed in Iraq - but an attempt to fudge things is one
tactic to weaken the courageous liberation fighters there  - I don't think
the poetry here or everywhere or wherever  is necessarily bad/ a great poet
can also be very right wing - Pound e.g. (but Pound started with a
passionate realisation that stupid rhetoric about the British empire  - and
the decay of language  -lead - or was  factor  -in bring about the WW1 - yes
he went wrong  - but his passion was right - to be angry is not good but
sometimes  - we must sow our feelings  - Pound (cranky yank that he was)
believed in a higher civilization - )  - but we seem SEEM to be in a time
when -
paradoxically  - passionate rhetoric has value - that said - I am aware of
the pitfalls of such rhetoric: how it distorts and magnifies etc - but I
know who the enemies are

e.g. King used passionate rhetoric -was he always talking the 'truth' ? No-
But was his message great ?? Yes!!

It is not sick to be in favour of siding with the struggle for freedom from
foreign aggression in Iraq -

There are many here pretend to be liberal but its as Sontag said  - they
care only for their pay packets - they are effectively on the side of the
US/Western Empire - next thing the US will re-arm Japan - they are planning
to invade Iran - that is ugly arrogance - Iran has a right to build any
weapons it can -it should (I hope to hell they are!! fast!! hurry Iran and
Korea  - arm!! arm!!) - if I was any country not US I would  - if I could
rapidly arm with as many ICBMs as I could.- I would - notice how the US
hasn't invaded India or China!! - and its well known that Israel has
nukes -the hypocritical yanks have thousands of them!!! - I am sure the
Chinese have them pointed at the US - ready for one false move - the
Democrats are useless - a revolution is needed - and there does tend to be a
sameness and clubiness of / amongst certain of the so -called langpos
and -not all of them (but see Scot Hamilton below) - and also a strong
leaning to the right -

in fact many of them I think when you look at their work exhibit or a morbid
tiredness - dullness, even cynicism -what was avant garde 20 years ago is
now just repetition - they are Right Wing and lack new ideas - any ideas in
some cases

then a lot just disappear into their language "play" -their blogs - or read
19th Century essays -while people die
Lawrence called me sick - I am not - I believe in freedom and not the false
elections that are being forced on the people of Iraq who hate the US

the sick are those who cannot see oppression or don't speak out against it
if they do

war is terrible - but no people want to be enslaved - so a war of liberation
is justifiable

Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1
Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable

Harry Nudel's response begs the question:  it assumes that the "real" poe=
m is
the text, but this is exactly the point at issue.

In retrospect it might have been clearer if I had quoted Govinda's remark=
s in
full.  I abridged them by leaving out the sentences where he talks about
poetry's power having the same source as that of a mantra:  they are both=

sacred speech.  The implication is that a mantra is a special sort of poe=
try
and poetry is a special sort of mantra.  Obviously a mantra isn't much go=
od if
you just write it in a notebook and leave it on a shelf so you can
occasionally take it down and look at the letters which represent it.  Th=
e
mantra's power exists only when the mantra is spoken and because it is sp=
oken.
 Likewise with a poem:  to reduce poetry to text is to disconnect poetry =
from
the source of its power as sacred speech.

I think this can be argued in a way that doesn't depend on recondite reli=
gious
ideas.  It's similar to the principle of psychoanalysis, that you can't d=
o it
by thinking or writing, you have to work out your therapy by actually tal=
king
in the physical presence of the therapist, even if the therapist doesn't =
do
much but listen.

Not that I think that poetry is only valid if it's spoken to someone:  if=
 I
thought that, then I'd have to admit that my own isn't very valid.  It's =
more
complicated than that:  it's a matter of the art's connectedness to its s=
ource
of power.  Listen to the music of Bach or Beethoven:  it rarely strays fa=
r
from dance, and this is the origin of its power, even if no one ever actu=
ally
dances to it.  Poetry's power source is formal interpersonal utterance in=

song, address, incantation, and it loses its power when it loses its
connection with such utterance, quite apart from the issue of whether any=
one
ever actually utters it in the ways I've mentioned.

Alan Sondheim's Codework piece seems to deal with some of these issues mo=
re by
exemplifying a contrary viewpoint than by explaining it, which puts me at=
 a
disadvantage in trying to reply with further standard critical discourse.=
  So
I'll only make a few comments on an idea which seems to be suggested by s=
ome
of his statements, and is certainly characteristic of postmodern poetics.=
 =

This is the idea that definitive interpretation is to be shunned because =
it
destroys poetry by assuming that a poem's meaning can be definitively
exhausted, as a riddle or puzzle has no use but to be discarded once it's=

solved.  The logical fallacy here is a false dichotomy:  the choice isn't=

between insisting that only one interpretation can be valid or accepting =
that
all interpretations must be valid.  A poem, a true and great poem, is a r=
iddle
that has an infinite number of right answers, but that doesn't mean that =
any
answer someone cares to give to it must be right.

Or use another metaphor:  knowing a poem is like knowing a person:  a lif=
elong
process of unfolding the riddle of who that person is.  There can be no
definitive definition of an individual human being:  we can never say "Th=
is,
exactly this, and only this is what this person is, period."  But it woul=
d be
preposterous to argue from this that all possible judgements of what that=

person is like are equally valid.

I have to agree though that much current poetry reflects the destruction =
of
the self. That's exactly what's wrong with it, and with us.

You don't need to be a programmer to get a sense of the
generative/compositional range of possibilities in a particular piece of
net.art. What pieces by Clauss and Strasser are you thinking of that have
generative/compositional range to compare with PixelByPixel (
http://www.lecielestbleu.com/media/pixelbypixelframe.htm )? Maybe I should
define it. At any point in time, it's the number of distinct actions
available; over time, it's basically the number of significantly different
results you can compose/can be generated. Scratching your nose doesn't count
in this calculation (unless that causes something different onscreen than
what scratching your ear causes). For instance, though it might be said
(validly) that a non-programmed/non-interactive piece of music or writing
etc has great 'generative/compositional range' conceptually, it has *none*
in the sense I'm thinking of, which is to say I'm thinking of the
mechanically interactive/generative space. Of course that isn't 'enough' in
matters of art; whether it's a lively and meaningful space is relevant.

You might also ask what you have done to it.

I try to ask the questions raised by the piece. And of course I have my own
concerns, as do most people.

Looking at Clauss's and Strasser's work, it's simple enough to figure out
how it might have been done. That isn't an interesting question in their
work, so I don't pursue it in writing about their work. The interest and
excellence of their work is elsewhere; it doesn't/can't approach programming
as an art; that is a discourse of algorithms; the 'value' of an algorithm
has to do with the (artistic, social, etc) value of what it does; with how
well it does it; whether it is commonly done, ie, whether it is a code
cliché; if it is a cliché, then whether it's subverted. The 'art of
programming', while it is a discourse of algorithms, is larger than the
Donald Knuth notion of 'the art of programming', which only addresses the
engineering/mathematical/structural value of algorithms; Knuth's approach
doesn't talk about, say, the value of an algorithm in relation to the fields
of poetry. Yet that is crucial to the poet-programmer.

Why do you think 'Pixel By Pixel' is named as it is? It turns out that the
name of Durieu's 'Oeil Complex' (
http://www.lecielestbleu.com/media/oeilcomplexframe.htm ) is relevant in
multiple ways to the 'Oeil Complex' piece. The title refers not only to a
complex of eyes, but to complex i, to the imaginary i, the square root of
negative one, which is deeply relevant not only to how the piece was done,
but to notions of identity and character in the piece.

Programmed works of art are, in some ways, certainly less predictable than,
say, static text, which is mechanically fixed. Sort of depends on the range
in various ways, doesn't it. Please note that I'm not saying this makes
programmable works of art better than non-programmed or programmable works
of art.

That which is constructed through programming need be no more "defined and
predictable" than the mind itself. Or any other programmed/programmable
process.

The most fundamental observation one can make concerning the phenomenology
of computers is that they are programmable. This is what gives computers
their radical flexibility compared with other machines. There is no proof,
and there probably never will be, that there exist any processes of which
humans are capable and computers are not. I know this thought is detestable
to you, but I think you will find, upon reflection, that it is really no
more detestable than is Darwin's theory compared with creationism.

I don't understand what it might mean to separate language from life.

Works of art are usually disembodied, whether they're books or film or
net.art or whatever, if that's what you mean.

There can be such things as self-replicating or self-modifying programs.
Programming doesn't need to be any more predictable than any other process.

It's quite simple to program processes so that they are unpredictable in

Mathematics is about much more than formulas, Komninos. And so too is
language, yes.

Hi mIEKAL

Then, I suspect your future will be one of growth and expansion, but not
necessarily in the areas you'd like. If you want to put the "i ching on the
cake," you could make a hexagram with a frosting whose color contrasts with
the dominant one. I'm sure the cake will be divine(d).

Aren't there other problems with interpretation than merely its tendencies
towards definitiveness? I'm can't quite follow how you leap from advocating
a memory of the presence of utterance or dance - ie, performance which
requires mutual bodily presences and recalls ritualistic roots - to the
question of interpretation.  There's a chasm in the middle here... Surely a
poem is much more than interpretation, and the idea of presence you outline
challenges the assumption that it is? It suggests to me that a poem is not
so much a riddle which requires answers of varying accuracy, but a something
in itself, which may require no answering at all, that mining it for meaning
might be to evade or even destroy the actual poem -  Famously, Sontag's 1964
argument, which interesting uses the word "impious":

"...the contemporary zeal towards interpretation is often prompted not by
piety towards the troublesome text (which may conceal aggression) but by an
open aggressiveness, an overt contempt for appearances.  ... The modern
style of interpretation excavates, destroys: it digs "behind" the text, to
find a sub-text that is the true one. The most celebrated and influential
modern doctrines, those of Marx and Freud, actually amount to elaborate
systems of hermeneutics, aggressive and impious theories of interpretation.
This manifest content must be probed and pushed aside to find the true
meaning - the _latent content_ beneath...according to Marx and Freud, these
events [history, personal events] only seem to be intelligible.  Actually,
they have no meaning without interpretation. To understand _is_ to
interpret.  And to interpret is to restate the phenomenon, in effect to find
an equivalent for it.

"This interpretation is not (as some people assume) an absolute value, a
gesture of mind situated in some timeless realm of capabilities.
Interpretation itself must be evaluated.  In some cultural contexts,
interpretation is a liberating act.  It is a means of revising, of
transvaluing, of escaping the dead past.  In other cultural contexts, it is
reactionary, impertinent, cowardly, stifling."

Yes to the second part; the point of the text - first, it's not based at
all on postmodern poetics or interpretation, but on codework and formal
structure quite a difference for me - is that there's always a surplus
which turns obdurate -

By "hardening of meaning" I refer to the need for deciphering codework,
which is partially code-dependent, which isn't immediately available as a
text. And the decipherment is part and parcel of the meaning; on the other
hand, there's a kind of collapse, the hardening, if something is "figured
out," if there's something there to be figured out.

It's like looking at a text written in reverse, seeing at first only a
confused of letters, then having the "aha" sensation that reversal is
occurring.

Well of course, yes, again. I'm not arguing for a definitive
interpretation but it's opposite. Too much codework _is_ formal, which
means, for me, design-oriented, an empty play of symbols, etc., repeating
the sort of conceptualist gestures one found in some concrete poetry, but
also as the structuring on concept/ual art (see Ursual Meyer's book for
examples). What I'm talking about is the parasitic relation of a sememe to
code ("parasitic" coming largely from Michel Serres), which is entangled
and inextricable, a sense of urgency throughout the work, embedded within
and embedding, the code. I'm not talking at all about ultimate and correct
interpretations.

This I really don't agree with, either for codework or current poetry, as
far as I understand it. -

 Conversation with Hamid Algar


"...it's not politically correct to say you're against a religion as
such. Therefore, an adjective has to be supplied: militant Islam,
extremist Islam, Islamic terrorism, Islamic fundamentalism, political
Islam....I think the following has to be taken into consideration: that
these so-called suicide bombings did not start until a considerable time
after the beginning of the Intifada, when a large number of Palestinian
children had been killed by Israeli forces, for nothing other than
throwing a stone, or in some cases not even that."


A Conversation with Hamid Algar
by Russell Schoch
California Monthly

Shortly after September 11, 2001, professor of Persian and Islamic
Studies Hamid Algar hailed a cab in downtown Berkeley. The cab driver
was an Indian Sikh, wearing a turban. When Algar got into the cab, the
driver said: "Sir, don't worry, I'm not a Muslim." Algar responded:
"Don't worry. I am a Muslim." Both men laughed, but with the realization
that the climate had changed for Muslims in the United States.

"I don't look like the average person's idea of a Muslim," says Algar,
who was born in England in 1940. (He declines to discuss his conversion
to Islam, which he considers a private matter.) As a youth, he had a
strong interest and facility for languages, mastering French and German
in high school, and spending a year at the University of Freiburg in
Germany before college.

After earning his B.A. with first-class honors in Oriental Languages
(Arabic and Persian) at Trinity College, Cambridge, he was offered a
scholarship to Tehran University in Iran, where he planned to work for
his Ph.D. But the year he went, 1961-2, was one of great tumult in Iran,
specifically at Tehran University, where he had "the memorable
experience of witnessing an attack on the university campus by the
Shah's paratroopers." He left the university and instead spent a year
traveling around the country. "I can honestly claim there's no
significant region of Iran that I didn't visit," he says.

Algar returned to Cambridge for his Ph.D., writing his dissertation on
the political role of Shi'a religious scholars in the 19th century. "The
reason for that choice of topic was the beginning of the movement
launched by Imam Khomeini in 1963," he says. Algar met with Khomeini in
exile in Paris and on brief occasions in Iran after the revolution there
in 1979. He translated selected writings and speeches of the Imam (Islam
and Revolution) and also gave his own account, The Roots of the Islamic
Revolution in Iran. He considers that revolution "the most significant,
hopeful, and profound event in the entirety of contemporary Islamic
history."

A faculty member at Berkeley since 1965, Algar teaches courses on
Persian literature, on the history of Islam, and on Shi'ism and Sufism,
and has produced scholarly books and articles on all these subjects.
Former Algar student and current Berkeley colleague Hatem Bazian, Ph.D.
'02, says that there are only a handful of scholars in the world with
Hamid Algar's level of knowledge in a number of fields of Islamic
studies, plus his mastery of Middle Eastern languages (Arabic, Persian,
and Turkish, both modern and Ottoman) and his knowledge of half a dozen
European languages. Among his scholarly achievements, Algar is the
author of more than 100 articles in the Encyclopaedia Iranica.

Algar says that he began his career at Berkeley with a focus on Iran and
early modern Iranian history, but has branched out in a number of other
directions, both historically and geographically. He has also traveled
extensively throughout the Muslim world. "What I've come to appreciate,"
he says, "is the great diversity of Islamic culture and the various
expressions of Islamic religion."

The contemporary Middle East is not his primary field of study, he
points out. But Algar's reputation as a scholar of Islam, and his lively
interest in present-day politics--including his close knowledge of the
Iranian revolution and his public denunciation of Osama bin Laden and al
Qaeda in the mid-1990s--led us to ask him for a Muslim perspective on
current events. He was interviewed in his Barrows Hall office following
the end of the military campaign in Iraq.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Is there a "clash of civilizations" going on today?

No. That's one of those meaningless slogans which people hold seminars
and write books about, which presumes an inherent and irreducible
antagonism. But what may be underway is the launching of World War IV,
as it's been called, most recently by James Woolsey [former director of
the CIA].

Woolsey said that the Cold War was the third World War, and that the
fourth is to defeat "terrorists" and to bring democracy to the Middle
East. He doesn't target Islam.

He doesn't say Islam because we're told this isn't a war against Islam.
But "World War IV" clearly focuses on Middle Eastern Muslim states.
Woolsey mentioned Syria and Iran and went on to talk about the Saudis
and the Egyptian regime. But if he thinks that the removal of the Saudi
regime would result in anything other than a recrudescence of hard-line,
undiluted Wahhabism, he's living in a world of fantasy. Likewise, if the
regime of Mubarak falls in Egypt, the strongest popular force again is
one that espouses some kind of relationship between Islam and politics.

One would find a virtual consensus on the subject throughout North
Africa and the Middle East, with the possible exception of Turkey, that
the state should in some sense be Islamic. Which doesn't mean an
imitation of the Iranian constitution, which is in my view in some ways
unwieldy and needing adaptation. It doesn't mean that the penal
provisions of the Shari'a need immediate implementation. But it does
mean that a total separation between the religious and the political is
incompatible with Islamic culture and history and understanding.

Has Turkey been successful as a secular state?

They've had more than 80 years to work things out in Turkey, and
obviously the matter has not yet been settled. One of the excuses
advanced by the army for its occasional forays into politics there is to
preserve secularism. Which must mean that the democratic process in
itself is inadequate to preserve secularism.

Just as an "Islamic state" remains an abstraction without further
definition and analysis, so does "secularism." Does it mean something on
American lines? Or on French lines, where, for example, students in
public schools are forbidden or discouraged from wearing signs of
religious identity, whether they be Muslim, Christian, or Jewish? Or
does it mean something like what we have in Turkey now, where, for
example, it is not possible for a woman observing the hejab [the
covering of the head] to teach or study in the university? If secularism
is to be understood in that sense, what we have is not in fact a
separation between church and state; it is, on the contrary, an
intervention on the part of the state in the religious life of the
individual.

In the United States, the belief is that the church and state should be
kept separate.

Separation of church and state makes perfect sense in light of American
history, in light of the American Constitution; but other countries have
different histories, they have different cultures, they have different
sets of beliefs. If one genuinely believes in pluralism, then one should
accept a plurality of cultures and of the political systems that emerge
from them.

Let me add that one cannot discern in Islamic history or in the Muslim
present any uniform, universally binding, and valid form of Islamic
government. To suggest that this is so is unrealistic; it does not do
justice either to the complexity of the present situation, or to the
complexity and variety that we find in Muslim history.

So if one says "Islamic state" or "Islamic government," it should not be
thought that there is one model that is universally applicable.
Precisely the course I've been teaching this semester, on the history of
Islamic political thought, shows that throughout the history of Islam
there's been a kind of continuing negotiation between principles taken
from the Qur'an and other authoritative sources, and the actual reality
of Muslim societies and countries.

When an American religious leader like Franklin Graham calls Islam "a
very evil and wicked religion," or a neoconservative like Norman
Podhoretz writes that "there is something in the religion [of Islam]
itself that legitimates the likes of Osama bin Laden," how do you respond?

I don't. I think for anyone to deserve a response he has to have a
minimum amount of correct knowledge, a minimum amount of decency, and a
minimum amount of intelligence. And I would say that both Graham and
Podhoretz, based on what you just read to me, are lacking in all three.
Therefore, they're not worthy of an answer.

But people do hear what they say and read what they write.

I know. This kind of nonsense has been spewed forth ever since the
Middle Ages, this kind of Islamophobic rhetoric. It's persisted as a
kind of subterranean rivulet of hatred in the West.

What one ought to take objection to, more clearly, is the link between
somebody like Franklin Graham and the U.S. government. On the one hand,
we have Bush proclaiming that Islam is a religion of peace, and on the
other hand we have Graham going to a Good Friday service at the Defense
Department, calling down God's blessings on the U.S. adventure in Iraq
while refusing in any way to dissociate himself from the remarks you
quoted. This creates the appearance of tolerance, if not acceptance, of
his views by a significant element in the United States government.

Let us suppose the impossible, that some Muslim preacher were invited
who rained down hostile epithets on other religions. People would be
justifiably outraged. But Islam is becoming increasingly fair game.

It's been said that, with the fall of the Soviet Union, Islam has
replaced Communism as the principal opponent of American democracy.

There always has to be a focus for hostility, to keep the juices pumped
and the military machine well supplied. Now, somewhat improbably,
Islam--or Muslims and Muslim countries--are fulfilling that role of a
global, long-term threat.

Although it's "militant Islam," not Islam in general, which is said to
be the threat.

Well, "militant" Islam because it's not politically correct to say
you're against a religion as such. Therefore, an adjective has to be
supplied: militant Islam, extremist Islam, Islamic terrorism, Islamic
fundamentalism, political Islam.

I would say that the Muslim world, or specifically the Muslim Middle
East, has been chosen not because it is strong, a menace, or a threat;
but, on the contrary, because it is an extremely weak and impotent
adversary.

But September 11th, terrorism, and Arab Muslims have been grouped
together as a threat to the West.

This is one of the gross disservices that Osama bin Laden has done,
precisely to Muslims, by giving a veneer of apparent credibility to a
pre-existing agenda for domination of the region.

Pre-existing?

Sure. Almost ten years ago, Israel called for a complete break with the
past, including the replacement of the Iraqi regime, among others.
People like Douglas Feith, and Richard Perle, who have been advisors to
the Israeli government, and Paul Wolfowitz--all of these people are on
record as espousing, long before September 11, precisely the kind of
policies that are now being implemented.

Another example of the unfortunate, to put it mildly, association
between Islamophobes and the government is Daniel Pipes, who started the
infamous "Campus Watch," which "monitors" Middle East scholars on U.S.
campuses.

Are you on the list?

I only recently made it.

Why only recently?

I don't know--inadequate research on his part? Maybe he needs to beef up
his staff a bit!

What is his purpose?

Pipes has made a career for himself by denouncing what he regards as the
dominance of Middle Eastern Studies departments at universities in the
United States by either Muslims or people who for whatever reason are
pro-Muslim, pro-Arab, pro-Palestinian, or anti-Israel.

 From your decades of teaching in a Middle Eastern Studies department,
how accurate is the charge?

It's highly inaccurate. For a long time, pro-Palestinian voices were a
small and beleaguered minority. It is true that things have changed
somewhat in recent decades. But to characterize the whole field as
somehow conspiratorially dominated by such voices at present is a gross
distortion.

What Pipes is basing himself on is the assumption that Middle Eastern
Studies departments should have as their primary purpose the furnishing
of accurate information that will be useful in the formulation and
execution of American foreign policy. In other words, the academic,
scholarly purposes of Middle Eastern studies, as such, are invalid. And
on that basis he criticizes, very broadly, a whole variety of people.

This too represents a change, a rise, in the undercurrent of
Islamophobia. The fact that it can now be expressed in semi-respectable
circles is due to a large number of relatively recent factors.

Such as?

The rise of a certain type of Christian fundamentalism, in tandem with
the neoconservatives and Zionists, and then the gift--I use the term
sarcastically--of Osama bin Laden.

Let's talk about the war in Iraq.


One can evaluate the war in Iraq from a variety of points of view; and
obviously it's had different types of results, some of which can be
positively evaluated, others negatively.

What are the positive results?

Well, the destruction of Saddam's abominable regime. Whether the U.S.
had the right to undertake the task, whether it could have been done in
a different way, at a lower cost in human life, are separate questions.
But the important thing is that now the Iraqi people should be free to
choose, not simply from a range of personalities or ideologies or
systems recommended by the United States, but what they actually want.

If democracy is to mean anything, it must mean respect for the majority
and its wishes. And if, which seems increasingly likely, the majority
wish in Iraq turns out to be some form of Islamic government, that is
really no concern of anyone outside the country.

Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld has said that an Islamic state is
not an option for Iraq.

Yes. Which shows that the true agenda is not to bring democracy to Iraq.

What would you say the agenda is?

Extending and reinforcing American hegemony in the Middle East, in close
coordination with Israel. That's pretty clear, I think. The aim is not
simply the elimination of a government--whose hostility to Israel didn't
amount to much more than rhetoric and a couple of missiles lobbed at Tel
Aviv during the first Gulf War--but beyond that the installation of a
government that will endorse the so-called peace process. So, gradually,
to dismantle any form of resistance to Israel as it is presently
constituted, that is, as an occupying power, on the part of any state in
the region.

And that's one reason why Iran has been mentioned as a possible next target?

Yes.

I assume that, in your view, an Islamic state in Iraq, like the one in
Iran, would not be a bad thing.

Since I'm neither Iraqi nor Iranian, and I don't live in either country,
my point of view is really not of importance. I think what we can all
agree upon is that people in those states, in fact in any state or
country in the world, should be at liberty freely to determine their
form of government. And if an Islamic state is chosen by the Iraqi
people, then so be it.

Jay Garner [former overseer in Iraq] was quoted in the New York Times as
saying that an Islamic republic is incompatible with democracy. Well,
what if a democratic majority in Iraq wants an Islamic republic?

I think that Americans would very rightly object if, in some future
world where American power has shrunk, a foreign state came and said:
Well, we don't like this or that aspect of your government; or the whole
system has to go; or what you can choose from is the following range,
but nothing outside of that. Obviously, that would be rejected as
outrageous. It's simply an expression of the gross imbalance of power
between the United States and the Muslim world, particularly in the
Middle East, that this kind of discussion arises in the first place and
is not found questionable: that you can have this kind of government,
but not that.

I think a more appropriate question, given what is currently under way,
would be whether American imperialism and democracy are compatible.

Twenty years ago, Iran was the focus of U.S. concern, not Iraq. Why the
change?

In every generation, one person or state is seen to be the source of
trouble, and everything must therefore be linked to that person or
state. It used to be Abdul Nasser, in the heyday of Arab nationalism;
anything that happened that upset the West could ultimately be traced to
Nasser.

Then, after the revolution in Iran, it became Iran, Imam Khomeini, and
more generally Shi'ism. Then, for a while, as a focus and gathering
point of troublesome people, there arose Sunni fundamentalism and
Wahhabism. Attempts are constantly made to interconnect everyone. It
does make life easier because then you don't have to analyze differences
or overlapping divergences. You can just say: "It's that big mass of
troublesome Muslims out there."

But there has been a connection between Islam and violence. Wasn't Islam
spread by the sword?

The early Islamic expansion obviously was a military expansion. But that
did not result in the forced conversion to Islam of the populations that
came under Islamic rule. In Syria, for example, a Christian majority
persisted for at least two, possibly three, centuries after the Muslim
conquest. The largest Muslim country in the world, Indonesia, is a
country where no Muslim armies from the Middle East ever went.

I think that if one compares the history of most branches of
Christianity and the way in which they were established, the comparison
is in favor of the Muslim record. And, if one wants to bring matters
down to the present, it has not been even ten years since the genocide
in Bosnia was brought to an end. And this genocide of the Muslim
population was brought about, it has to be said, with the explicit
blessing of the Serb Orthodox Church. Having been to Bosnia and seen
soccer fields turned into cemeteries, and having talked to some of the
survivors of the massacre at Srebrenica, I find it very hard to listen
with equanimity to accusations that Muslims are the major purveyors of
arbitrary violence in this age. It's absolutely incredible to say so.

What about suicide bombers?

That term, an invention of the West, does not represent the perspective
of those who engage in such action and is not very helpful. It seems to
me that such actions are closer to the case of a soldier who, in battle
against overwhelming odds and in the certain knowledge that he will not
emerge alive from the encounter, rushes upon the enemy.

What if the enemy is composed of innocent women and children?

I think the following has to be taken into consideration: that these
so-called suicide bombings did not start until a considerable time after
the beginning of the Intifada, when a large number of Palestinian
children had been killed by Israeli forces, for nothing other than
throwing a stone, or in some cases not even that. It was only after such
casualties had begun to mount that this tactic was used.

In addition, there is the simple fact that the Palestinian people are
now facing, effectively alone and with great courage, one of the best
equipped and most ruthless military forces in the world. And while no
one can take pleasure in the sight, as you say, of women and children
being killed, it seems to me that a greater degree of moral condemnation
should be reserved for those who continue, daily, with impunity, to kill
and to humiliate the Palestinian people. In other words, there is
definitely a cause-and-effect relationship here, and to criticize or
condemn an effect while overlooking the cause is not very helpful.

What can be done?

The very least that is owed to the Palestinian people is that they
should have a life of security, independence, and dignity on a very
small portion of their ancestral territory. The West Bank and Gaza
constitute less than 20 percent of historic Palestine. In addition, the
right of return for Palestinian refugees is indispensable.

More broadly, as far as the Islamic world in the Middle East is
concerned, the real problem is that there has been too much outside
interference. I'm not one of those who says that all of the ills of the
Muslim world are exclusively the result of imperialism and Zionism. No.
On the other hand, if this ugly combination of confrontation and
condescension that one sees from the West were to be removed from the
equation, then I think that, after a period of trial and error, finally,
the Muslim nations would be able to get their affairs in order. But this
constant intrusion, which in its extreme form takes on the aspect of
military aggression, is not helpful; it cannot in the very nature of
things produce a stable result.

[bA final question: As a Muslim, do you find life more difficult these
days? [/b]

Personally, not much at all, apart from a general sense of being
beleaguered. Berkeley, both the campus and the city are different from
much of the rest of the country, thank God.

To disapprove of American policy in the Middle East is one thing; to
have the pleasure of living here is another. After all, there are a vast
number of intelligent and decent people in this country who themselves
advance many of the same criticisms I have outlined.

I think Jon has opened up an intermediating discussion/debate here - and re
interpretation - it seems to pivot on what is meant to any reader/writer
anyone -what "interpretation " means  - which leads us to Derrida? etal? -
and back towards Alan's poem/polemic/poetic - part of his project - which is
brilliant (as an example of deconstructive poetics?) but brilliant if one
knows nothing of all that - as a "pure poem' but ....

[Nudel is  is writing longer poems some are  very good - capital in fact -
capital I say!! Winter is making him warm perhaps?]

I think that to say that poetry is about the fragmentation of the self and
that that is what is wrong with it is maybe open to question-
fragmentation - reality itself is 'fragmented' - poems - great poems (how do
we define a great poem?)  (questions have to be begged at various points -
some premises assumed...); so-called great poems have their origin in
language as spoken - - for all of us start out in life hearing our mother's
voice and others around us -our father/siblings etc etc  or nurses or - but
we are primarily seeing beings - well - does that mean that we have to read
poem aloud that is designed as such? [I meant to say we are primarily
speaking beings ] [but we are also primarily seeing beings as well  lol!!]

["We are primarly nothing!!" - I supperpurppose Monsieur Bowering will

I read a lot of poetry aloud to myself - but who knows who reads what
aloud - of each person's work? -in St Augustine's day people read aloud
(suposedly -no expert on his day or time...)  -it was common it was then the
norm I believe ( but not many people read then)- he mentions coming across
someone reading a book and his astonishment that the reader is not
enunciating the words

some fascinating questions - feel out of my depth already!  -infinite
numbers of semantic possibilities generated by texts perhaps with various
major interpretations - this is astute and "on to it" by Alison and Sontag -
she was a great thinker / writer.

fragmentation of the self - at least as a device, is quite valid  - and it
informs and makes much poetry intagliate rich  - but there are other methods
of attack - other strategies - not better or worse... different approaches -
hermeneutics and - thus responses etc etc as we 'translate' a poem /poems /a
work /a text / texts....

in the very sememes the meaning burns

for john fisk


eating brownies
at such a distance
over so much time & so little
distance
with so much space because i
found my tongue too
late

pen thief
dogs wade thru the wires
conspiring

drinker
dogs burn their paws
on salted sidewalks

smoker
the blind dog rubs its nose
in the snow
& then on my pant-leg

smoker
i stole the writing from
the walls

me here why
sold out my sickness
kissing the arses
of yes men

words tossed into the ring
sentences sentenced to death

i am good at creating accidents
fissures
lesions

words are not sentences
& it all resides in the bone
& marrow
not in the heart as some believe

i am on your track now
we have this & that in common
but i will be 2 weeks older than you
no longer

maybe i will learn to drive again
then learn to drink & smoke & swallow
& shoot & shout & shut myself all up again

maybe i'll tonic my gin
again
& give myself a hot shot in the
left pocket
where stones remain
to remind me
of my sins

then i'll gun the gas
& race thru the past to get to
the future
in order to arrive in the past
again -

& there i'll unveil this tear
for you
amazed that i am still among
the "living"

& by the way
i too am hungry & angry
& missing
a couple of teeth.

Polish Association for American Studies: 2005 Conference

CONFORMITY AND RESISTANCE IN AMERICA
Kamie Iski, 23-25 October 2005

From Ralph W. Emerson, who in his essays defined self-reliance as
nonconformity, to Edward W. Said, who has recently addressed the
so-called 'humanities crisis' by way of referring to an urgent need of
the other traditions/humanities, there has been in America a constant
awareness of tensions existing between the canonical and the
marginalized, the central and the peripheral.

In his 2000 essay 'Humanism's Sphere,' Said reminds us of the musical
etymology of the word canon--a contrapuntal form employing numerous
voices--and goes on to say: 'the canonical humanities, far from being
a rigid tablet of fixed rules and monuments bullying us from the
past... will always remain open to changing combinations of sense and
signification; every reading and interpretation of a canonical work...
allows the modern and the new to be situated together in a broad,
historical field whose usefulness is that it shows us history as an
agonistic process still being made, rather than finished and settled
once for all.'

Consequently, we are interested in all those issues that address the
American canonical humanities as a space of fruitful tensions between
what has been generally acknowledged as the canon and what has been
questioning and subverting its very foundations and archives. This
includes various areas of American cultural and literary studies,
gender and minority studies, political and legal theories, philosophy
and sociology, history of art, etc. The following topics are mere
suggestions:

- the Emersonian heritage of self-reliance understood as
nonconformity; ways of destabilizing the American identity; sublime
modes of American culture; figures of the American anti-hero and
rebel; revisions of the American Myth/Dream

- the heritage of American pragmatism: conformity or resistance?

- the place of the American university as annexed by medical,
biotechnical, defense and corporate interests (Masao Miyoshi's thesis)

- revival of the suppressed languages and cultures; the U.S. as a
polyglot country; diasporic communities and minority writing;
interpretations of multi-cultural and multi-ethnic America

- the American art in the XX century and beyond: from the Armory Show
to the 'last avant-garde' (David Lehman) and '21st-Century Modernism'
(Marjorie Perloff); the atonal and the aleatory

- revisions of global economy; 'resistance to the overmastering
paradigm of globalization' (E. Said); ecology and/vs technology in
American agriculture

- political correctness, liberal conformism and conservative
opposition; the dialectics of the 'American proposition'

Deadline for topic proposals and brief summaries is June 30th, 2005.
Presentations should not be longer than 25 minutes (faculty members of
the ASC will coordinate workshops). Conference proceedings will be
published.

The conference fee, covering room and board, is 500 PLN (ca. 123
Euro).

200-word abstracts should be sent to

Dr. Tomasz Lebiecki

Subject:      INVENTORY REDUCTION--I'M GIVING AWAY A NOVLE AND A SHORT SOTRY
              COLLECTION
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="US-ASCII"
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

Because my storage space is tight, I have to make room for a large
publishing project. To do so, I'm giving away RELIC'S REUNIONS, a novel, and
STAY TUNED TO THIS CHANNEL, a short story collection that was a finalist in
the last Black Ice/FC2 Fiction Contest..

Here are capsule descriptions:


RELIC'S REUNIONS:

In Relic's Reunions, Edsel Relic, a highschool outcast turned performance
poet, receives a telephone call from his unrequited teenage love, who
invites him to attend his 25th class reunion -just as he's reeling from a
mid-life diagnosis of Tourette Syndrome. Relic's debate over attending
careens from narrative to stream-of-consciousness to TV script in a
mixed-media mind-movie while his supporting cast of jazz musicians, high
school jocks, patriotic principals, early-60's hipsters-and a cameo
appearance by the most trusted man in America, Walter Cronkite-scrawls a
jazz-fueled American Graffiti on the wall of the America that brought us the
sixties.


STAY TUNED TO THIS CHANNEL:

A young jazz musician on a cruise ship discovers a magical dimension to his
talent that threatens a new romance. A novice bureaucrat challenges the
sanity of the person he replaces in a literary Mobius strip.  The
mock-autobiography of a poster boy for a conduct disorder careens through a
collage of narratives, headlines and commercials that creates an irreverent
send-up of the tabloid mentality. An unpub-lished writer questions his
sanity and the creative process itself when his work appears in print under
another author's name. Frazer's narrative techniques create a mixed-media
surrounding of the senses through which a wit whips from antic to acidic at
the turn of a phrase. In the course of challenging conventional assumptions
about what constitutes reality, Stay Tuned to this Channel seeks---and
finds---a heightened reality whose distortions present a pointed reflection
of daily life in America's commodity-driven culture.


Please backchannel your surface mailing address and I'll send you the
copies.

ANSELM BERRIGAN AND STEFAN KIESBYE
Poetry and Fiction Reading

$4, $3 student, $2 members
The Hibiscus Room at Just Buffalo, Tri-Main Center, 2495 Main Street, Ste.

SPECIAL ONE-DAY POETRY WORKSHOP WITH ANSELM BERRIGAN

STITCHING TOGETHER A VOICE, with Anselm Berrigan
Saturday, February 5 12-4 p.m., $50, $40 members

I want to examine the artistic co-habitation of two apparently opposing
ideas: that every poet has a distinct voice, and that every voice is
constructed (a made thing). The idea being to put both notions to use in
order to write rich, long, complicated, independent-minded poems that handle
multiple subjects and that audiences want to read and hear. Another way of
putting it is looking directly at autobiographical material and external
(received, researched, appropriated, for starters) language and information
as capable of sharing the same space within poetic forms. Work by poets
Kevin Davies and Harryette Mullen involved. Participants should bring some
work in progress or notes or unfinished anythings to use as potential
material, and some reading materials of any types.

Anselm Berrigan is the author of Integrity & Dramatic Life and Zero Star
Hotel (both from Edge Books), and a CD (reading only) Pictures for Private
Devotion (www.narrowhouserecordings.com). Recent work can be found on-line
at www.gutcult.com and www.2ndavenue.com . He lives in New York City, where
he grew up, and is the Artistic Director of the Poetry Project at St. Mark's
Church-in-the-Bowery. He also lived in Buffalo from 1989-1993 while
attending UB.

a rather pure instance of phonocentrism, which is a kissing cousin of logocentrism (child of phallogocentrism.)

if this is correct, there is no such thing as world poetry.  yet translation is exactly what poetry always does and will always do.

My thanks to Rebecca Seiferle for her response. (The Yeats quote she refers
to actually was posted to another list than poetics. If anyone's interested
in it I'll send it here too.)

Trying to think through the Govinda remarks:

If this view of poetry is correct, then poetry must be defined as the art
whose material is utterance, and utterance must be taken in the strict sense:
words physically spoken aloud. This in turn implies that if someone writes a
text on the assumption that others are going to read it silently, that text
cannot be considered poetry, just as, if someone writes a musical score, not
as something for musicians to play, but as something for readers of scores to
examine visually, then that production cannot reasonably be considered music.
And this implies that most of the poetry being written in English today,
really isn't.

The above view of poetry may seem eccentric and extreme, but through much of
human history it would have been too obvious to need saying. The idea that
what a poem really is, is the text that embodies it, is a modern invention,
which to much of past culture would have seemed as weird as the idea that what
Beethoven's Fifth Symphony really is, is the score to it. The degeneration of
poem into text is the great source of the failure of poetry in our time.

hard to believe that Doestoevsky was of the left, given the picture he gives in The Possessed, but I don't know enough to say otherwise.  HOWEVER, the fact that you do not know of the tradition of the religious left in the US does not mean it does not exist.  it does indeed:  the organizations leading the call for forgiveness of debt for the third world are mainline churches.  please oh please people, do not mistake the Southern Baptist Convention and the Christian Coalition for the beliefs of all christians, regardless of adjective in this country.  as for religious left-wing intelligentsia, look at Cornel West, Stanley Hauerwas, and indeed the journal Sojourner.

Dostoevsky was not a religious conservative, he was a religious left. he

here in America it was the case in Russia (and it may still be). Organized
religion is purely political and it can position itself at any point on the
political spectrum, depending on its doctrines. It so happened in America
that American Christians support the doctrine of prosperity as the sign of
divine grace and thus flock together with the rich and powerful. If the
Christian groups who opposed the rich won historically they would have been
among the persecuted now, and on the extreme left.

Dostoyevsky called himself a "doubter." I don't have the source with me
today, but when I read his biography a long time ago, a quote from a
letter that he had written stood out, and I will always remember it. It
said that he very much wanted to be a Christian and to have faith, but
he couldn't give himself over to complete, unquestioning faith. His
desire for faith seems to be what made him critical of the
intelligensia. He's wonderfully unresolved, so he's always in a position
of cutting right through ideological blinders.

Baldwin's book about the killer of black children in Atlanta is still
the most important anyone has said about race recently.

by the way, wasn't Doestevsky a nationalist or a slavophile more than a
religious conservative? i see no way that someone who was dogmatically
or prescriptively religious could imagine the voices he does. basically
he makes Tolstoy seem sentimental (even Christian, for chrissakes).

Good piece, Aldon! Made me think also of James Baldwin ominous 1964 New
Yorker essay call to action, The Fire Next Time. Which is also a quote
from
the Bible, right? Indeed - not that Baldwin was trying to burn the
country
down (to the contrary), but within the next two years, it was Detroit
and
several other cities in various flames. Ironically some good Civil
Rights
legislation emerged from it all - whether from non-violent or violent
actions, or the combination of both.
Ironically, George & Co.'s use of the 9-11 flame has been aggressively
oppressive on all fronts, I am afraid. 'Freedom' is just another word
for
something to abuse.

I've been reviewing posts on lists, of a supposedly poetic nature, and what I must have to say is how dull the general tenor of them
is: I dunno, but if I look at my life, and the way people talk in the vernacular, the fucking airy-headed bollocks that often comes
out on lists has no relationship with anything resembling reality. I listen, I experience, I know the way life breathes, and what
happens in my reality and the vocabulary of the poetic scene seem to have no more than a passing acquaintance.

Pah, what do you do if you have a little disabled girlfriend who is being threatened by a muscle-bound stalker who has just come out
of the nick? Call the police I've been told, even by the local heavy mob, but she's got her sixteen year old lad just back living
with her after eight years and him being kicked out by his foster mother on the day before his birthday, which was xmas day, so he's
now down with us in Leicester instead of Nottingham but I'm the only mate he's got here, he just pals with mommy apart from me,
we're desperately trying to get him into playing Monopoly. I use this anecdotal stuff to make my point, about what the connection
between the discourse of poetic debate and poetic language itself has with what really goes on.

In a speech on translation at Simmins College (Boston) last fall, translator
Red Pine (Bill Porter) discussed how he's always viewed the text to be the
recipe of poetry, to be filled in by the act of reading IN ANY LANGUAGE. The
reading is the poetry, the meal, where the words are just the recipe. The
poem is a never-ending process, according to his vision.

This allows him to translate, in fact, and see each different translation
(including the original) as a part of the manifestation of that never-ending
process. I'm not sure what Robert Corbett is really saying (I haven't been
following the thread closely enough, up to this point), but I thought Red
Pine's ideas merited attention at this point.

There are parts of his philosophy I find compelling, and parts I find
dismissible, but I bring it up as an idea to ponder, as we think about the
relationship between utterance and poem.

a rather pure instance of phonocentrism, which is a kissing cousin of
logocentrism (child of phallogocentrism.)

if this is correct, there is no such thing as world poetry.  yet translation
is exactly what poetry always does and will always do.

My thanks to Rebecca Seiferle for her response. (The Yeats quote she refers
to actually was posted to another list than poetics. If anyone's interested
in it I'll send it here too.)

Trying to think through the Govinda remarks:

If this view of poetry is correct, then poetry must be defined as the art
whose material is utterance, and utterance must be taken in the strict
sense:
words physically spoken aloud. This in turn implies that if someone writes a
text on the assumption that others are going to read it silently, that text
cannot be considered poetry, just as, if someone writes a musical score, not
as something for musicians to play, but as something for readers of scores
to
examine visually, then that production cannot reasonably be considered
music.
And this implies that most of the poetry being written in English today,
really isn't.

The above view of poetry may seem eccentric and extreme, but through much of
human history it would have been too obvious to need saying. The idea that
what a poem really is, is the text that embodies it, is a modern invention,
which to much of past culture would have seemed as weird as the idea that
what
Beethoven's Fifth Symphony really is, is the score to it. The degeneration
of
poem into text is the great source of the failure of poetry in our time.

CARLOS CORTEZ, 81
Social issues inspired artist

By Manya A. Brachear
Tribune staff reporter
Published January 23, 2005

Before Carlos Cortez decided to buy a home, his wife, Mariana, first
had to convince him it would be in his best economic interest. He
dreaded supporting a capitalist system that he believed cheated the
common man out of a living wage.

But buying the home was a decision he would never regret. For the next
30 years, the basement became a studio for Mr. Cortez and his wood- and
linoleum-cut graphics, and the living room became a gathering place for
strangers who quickly became friends.

There, surrounded by the artist's black and white prints that inspired
so many, poets and painters explored how art could incite social
change, shed light on poor and disenfranchised populations, celebrate
indigenous cultures and promote peace--all principles that inspired Mr.
Cortez to create art.

Mr. Cortez, 81, a poet, muralist and graphic artist, whose portrayals
of the challenges facing the common man are on display in neighborhood
galleries and the Smithsonian Institution, died of heart failure
Wednesday, Jan. 19, in his Northwest Side home.

Also emblematic of his principles, Mr. Cortez bequeathed more than 100
wood and linoleum blocks used to produce his prints to Chicago's
Mexican Fine Arts Center Museum, stipulating that if the price of his
art went up, the blocks should be used to produce more and drive it
down.

"As an arts advocate, he argued that art is essential to the human
experience," said the museum's president, Carlos Tortolero.

The son of a German mother and a Mexican father, Mr. Cortez, who often
attached his Nahuatl surname "Koyokuikatl," was born and raised in the
Milwaukee area. Imprisoned for 18 months as a conscientious objector
during World War II, he joined the Industrial Workers of the World in
1947. He wrote a column and drew cartoons for the union paper, The
Industrial Worker, from the early 1950s until recently.

He met his wife in 1957, when she traveled to Milwaukee from Greece to
visit her brother. In 1965, Mr. Cortez moved to Chicago. A year later,
he traveled to his wife's hometown of Patras, Greece, brought her back
and married her. She died in 2001.

In the 1970s, Mr. Cortez joined the Hispanic mural movement, painting
walls of city buildings to communicate political messages about the
ills afflicting society.

Inspired by the Mexican printmaker Jose Guadalupe Posada, whose
woodcuts depicting violence and executions were sold at low cost to the
masses, Mr. Cortez broadened his medium to printmaking. After carving
images into wood and linoleum blocks, he applied ink, then pressed
paper over the ink-covered surface.

A blue-collar worker and pacifist, Mr. Cortez portrayed military
invasions, parents crying over a casket draped with the American flag,
and the wrinkled faces of workers worn down by their plight. His
artwork always remained on the side, while he made a living working in
factories.

"You couldn't separate the manual labor he did from who he was,"
Tortolero said. "Carlos was always about the real value of things. It
was never money. He never supported himself as an artist."

In 1975, Mr. Cortez helped found the first Mexican arts organization in
Illinois, Movimiento Artistico Chicano, or MARCH. He also became a
fervent supporter of and frequent exhibitor at the Mexican Fine Arts
Center Museum. His work also is on display at the New York Museum of
Modern Art and in galleries in such countries as Spain and Sweden.

In addition to his papier-mache sculptures, murals, prints and poems,
he wrote three poetry books, edited a book on Posada and contributed to
a number of others. For almost 20 years, he served as board president
of Charles Kerr Publishers, one of the oldest working-class publishing
houses in the world.

In 1999, he welcomed a group of organizers into his living room to talk
about the upcoming Chicago Labor and Arts Festival and read poetry.

He was one of the pillars, just a very generous guy.  I met him while I lived in Chicago in the
mid 90's.

Here's one of his poems, from "de KANSAS a CALIFAS & back to CHICAGO"

Centinela


Beneath the high street lamp
In the overnight
Trailer park;
With the encouragement
From the Desert Moon;
The young Saguaro
Maintains his unapproachable
Dignity.

Iraqi forces 'committing abuse'
Iraqi security forces systematically abuse prisoners, a leading
US-based human rights group reports.

Unlawful arrests, torture and the long-term isolation of detainees
are "routine", Human Rights Watch says.

Of 90 prisoners interviewed by the group since 2003, 72 said
they had been abused by the new Iraqi authorities.

Another rights group, the American Civil Liberties Union charges
that similar abuses allegedly committed by US soldiers have not
been investigated.

The ACLU said it had obtained documents that told "a damning
story of widespread torture reaching well beyond the walls of Abu
Ghraib," the notorious US-run jail in Iraq.

'Bribes'

The 94-page report by Human Rights Watch detailed a catalogue
of abuses allegedly committed by Iraqi security forces.

The report - The New Iraq? Torture and ill-treatment of detainees in
Iraqi custody - found evidence of widespread human rights violations
against alleged national security suspects and common criminals.

        The Iraqi interim government is not keeping its promises to
honour and respect basic human rights
                        Sarah Leah Whitson
                        Human Rights Watch

Between July and October 2004, HRW's investigations revealed
systematic use of arbitrary arrest, torture of detainees, improper treatment
of child prisoners and denial of access to lawyers.

Iraqi Human Rights Minister Bakhtiar Amin acknowledged that abuses
had occurred and blamed the legacy of Saddam Hussein's regime.

He told the Reuters news agency that the security forces' "shortcomings"
were the fault of "three-and-a-half decades of dictatorship, widespread
torture and human rights violations."

Among the report's findings are:

    * Detainees were routinely beaten with cables and metal rods during
interrogation, given electric shocks and kept blindfolded and handcuffed
for days

    * Detainees were held for long periods in isolation, deprived of food
and water and crammed into small cells with standing room only

    * Iraqi police sought bribes in return for releasing prisoners or allowing
them access to family members or food and water.

Executive director for HRW Sarah Leah Whitson said Iraqi forces and
international advisers were allowing abuses to "go unchecked" in the
name of bringing stability to Iraq.

She said: "The people of Iraq were promised something better than this
after the government of Saddam Hussein fell.

"The Iraqi interim government is not keeping its promises to honour and
respect basic human rights."

Ms Whitson acknowledged Iraqi security forces were targeted by insurgents,
but said this did not justify prisoner abuse.

'Whitewash'

The HRW report does not examine claims of mistreatment of prisoners by
US or coalition forces.

However, the ACLU said late on Monday that US investigations into alleged
abuse committed by American soldiers had been "woefully inadequate" and had
"basically whitewashed the torture and abuse."

Quoting US defence department documents obtained under the Freedom of
Information Act, the ACLU said the Pentagon had failed to conduct full inquiries
into "serious allegations of torture including electric shocks, forced sodomy and
severe physical beatings".

In one case, a 73-year-old Iraqi woman reported that her captors sodomised her
with a stick, but the incident was closed on the basis of a "sanitised copy" of a
preliminary report, the ACLU said.

US soldier Charles Graner was found guilty of abusing prisoners at Abu Ghraib
earlier this month, while cases are also being brought against troops from the UK
and Denmark.

"the field of the aleatory is immense, but not absolute"
Henri Lefebvre

"We learn that Hercberg [Salomon Hercberg, the commissioner of the
Order Service and commandant of Central Prison] had been living in
clover in the ghetto, that he owned three apartments and had been 'the
lord and master of Marysin as if he were the governor of the most
beautiful section of the ghetto,' that he received special commissions
'in connection with the rounding-up of the ghetto's undesirable
elements, 'and that many times, he had 'personally organized and
directed night raids on apartments, as well as the raids that were
carried out in broad daylight on the streets.'" (Dobroszycki,
xxvi-xxvii).

"Such [other] observations are made in the margin next to his remarks
on the Jewish police in the ghetto and its brutal, Gestapo-like
behavior, where he goes on to define the police as a group, and class
apart, of the Eldest's followers which also served as his bodyguard,
'Schutzgarde fur Chaim,' to use Rosenfeld's own words" [Dr. Oscar
Rosenfeld, 'Private diary, not to be read, a memoir for the future']".
(Dobroszycki, xxix).

"At that time it was the former workers' parties, chiefly the Bund,
the Poale Zion, and the communists that took up the cry of struggle.
In keeping with their traditions and also with a seemingly incomplete
grasp of the radical changes that had resulted from the Nazi
occupation of the country in general and Lodz in particular, those
parties reverted to street demonstrations and strikes as their
principal means of protest. They were, of course, doomed to failure;
to maintain some sort of discipline in the ranks of the demonstrators
exhausted by hunger, for instance, was nearly impossible. Moreover,
the demonstrators began increasingly to be led by elements not
connected with any party, by random individuals, or by people from the
criminal world and so-called strong men. During one such demonstration
in the summer of 1940, brutally suppressed by the Eldest of the Jews'
police, demands were voiced that the ghetto's authorities include
Germans. Its bearings lost, the crowd could not imagine that things
could be any worse. The illusions were dispelled when the German
police entered the ghetto and opened fire on the crowds. That was the
end of open street demonstrations in the ghetto, though labor strikes
would erupt from time to time in various workshops, chiefly as a
protest against management. Yet, Rumkowski [Eldest of the Jews i.e.
Patriarch of the Ghetto] was able to believe that he was in control of
the situation. To be on the safe side, however, he removed the
potential organizers of disturbances, at first by arresting them or
sending them out of the ghetto to do forced labor, and, later on, by
including them on the lists of those to be deported." (Dobroszycki,
xlix-l).

\\

"The Muslims ("The 'Muslim' is the key figure of the Nazi
extermination camp universe [fn 50: "I draw here on Chapter 2 of
Giorgio Agamben's Ce qui reste d'Auschwitz, Paris: Rivages 1999.
Incidentally, the traces of anti-Arab racism in this designation are
more than evident: the designation 'Muslim', of course, emerged
because the prisoners identified the behavior of the 'living dead' as
close to the standard Western image of a 'Muslim', a person who is
totally resigned to his fate, passively enduring all calamities as
grounded in God's will. Today, however, in view of the Israeli-Arab
conflict, this designation regains its actuality: the 'Muslim' is the
extimate kernel, the zero-level, of the 'Jew' himself"]) are the
'zero-level' of humanity: the Heideggerian co-ordinates of the project
(Entwurf) through which the Dasein answers and assumes, in an engaged
way, his being-thrown-in-the-world (Geworfenheit), are suspended here.
The Muslims are a kind of 'living dead' who even cease to react to
basic animal stimuli, who do not defend themselves when attacked, who
gradually even cease to feel thirst and hunger, eating and drinking
more out of blind habit than on account of some elementary animal
need. For this reason, they are the point of the Real without symbolic
Truth--there is no way to 'symbolize' their predicament, to organize
it into a meaningful life-narrative. [...] One is tempted to say that
the Muslim, precisely in so far as he is in a way 'less than animal',
deprived even of animal vitality, is the necessary intermediate step
between animal and man, the 'zero-level' of humanity in the precise
sense of what Hegel called 'the night of the world', the withdrawal
from engaged immersion in one's environment, the pure self-relating
negativity which, as it were, 'wipes the slate' and thus opens up the
space for specifically human symbolic engagement. To put it yet
another way: the Muslim is not simply outside language (as is the case
with the animal), he is the absence of language as such, silence as a
positive fact, as the rock of impossibility, the Void, the background
for speech to emerge against. In this precise sense, one can say that
in order to 'become human', to bridge the gap between animal immersion
in the environment to human activity, we all, at some point, have had
to be Muslims, to pass through the zero-level designated by this
term." (Zizek, 73, 76-78).

Hello Everyone,

First, let me thank all of you who submitted to Blackbox.  Within days of my
announcement I received an ocean-full of submissions.  I've chosen ten artists
whose combination achieves a variety of aesthetic approaches--both new
contributors and repeaters.

Amazingly, I must close the submission period mere days after opening it.
Much to my regret, I simply cannot handle more material.

I'll post an announcement when the winter gallery is up for viewing.  Again,
thanks to all.

Best, Bill

ottawater: a city of romantics & optimists

Published to help celebrate the 150th anniversary of the City of Ottawa,
Canada's glorious capital city, "ottawater," and its chemical formula/logo
"O2(H2O)," is a brand new poetry annual produced exclusively on-line, in
both readable and printable pdf formats. An anthology focusing on Ottawa
poets and poetics, its first issue appears in January 2005, 150 years
after old Bytown became the City of Ottawa. Long seen as a town made only
of bureaucrats and technocrats, and a more conservative poetics,
"ottawater" simply wants to remind us of what work is happening, and has
been happening for years, despite government types announcing every few
years that the arts in Ottawa is about to begin. We say instead: we have
always been here.

Edited by Ottawa writer rob mclennan, the first issue features work by
various residents current and former, in both readable and printable pdf
formats, including: Stephen Brockwell, George Elliott Clarke, Anita
Dolman, Tamara Fairchild, Laurie Fuhr, Gwendolyn Guth, William Hawkins,
Matthew Holmes, Clare Latremouille, rob mclennan, Max Middle, Peter
Norman, Monty Reid, Chris Turnbull and Ewan Whyte, interviews with poets
John Barton and Max Middle, and reviews of work by Stephen Brockwell,
Peter Norman and Shane Rhodes, as well as artwork by Derrick Lacelle, Don
Monet, Jeremy Reid, Jennifer Kwong, Sarah Dobbin, Juan Carlos Noria and
designer Tanya Sprowl.

The launch party will be happening on Thursday, February 3rd at the
Mercury Lounge, 56 Byword Street, Ottawa, from 8pm to 10pm, lovingly
hosted by rob mclennan, who David Gladstone called "the poet laureate of
Centretown Ottawa" in 1996 in The Centretown Buzz. There will be short
readings by various of the contributors, including Gwendolyn Guth, Max
Middle, Anita Dolman, Chris Turnbull and Peter Norman. After the readings,
stick around and have a drink, as the program to follow is resident dj
Trevor Walker hosting Mui Afro Funke, playing latin and African influenced
musics, jazz funk, and house music later on into the night.

You can find the first issue at www.ottawater.com/

I agree with Mr. Nudel that McGee is in bad taste and worst. Let us now
charge the Jews with Lodz.

McGee absolutely sickens me. Anyone can selectively quote.

Let the fucking kikes alone and talk of something else please.

- Alan, really fed up. This is a POETICS list not a hammer-the-Jews or
Arabs or any other nationalities list. Isn't it?

I seem to remember that Shakespeare has had a number of vocal detractors
over the years.  Does anyone know where I can get a copy of anti-Shakespeare
writing from onr of his contemporaries or shortly after his lifetime?

His plays rubbed classicists the wrong way, didn't they?

Perhaps the best known (and certainly the earliest) anti-Shakespeare piece
was a remark by Robert Greene in _Greenes Groatsworth of Wit_ (1592) where
we're told of:

" ... an upstart Crow, beautified with our feathers, that with his Tygers
hart wrapt in a Players hyde, supposes he is as well able to bumbast out a
blanke verse as the best of you."

Bob Grumman discusses it here:

            http://www.geocities.com/SoHo/Cafe/1492/crow.html

Ben Jonson was also a bit sniffy about Shakespeare in both _Timber_ and
_Conversations with Drummond_.

It might be worth looking at the first volume of _Shakespeare: The Critical
Heritage_ which *should* print all the earliest comments on WS.

(Can't guarantee this, as haven't read it.)

Hope this helps.

The VAPD rating system is right up my alley, but one
improvement can be made.  To the list of stasguard
magazines should be appended a list compiled of zines
and internet magazines--with the magazines rated from
minus one to minus 100 or whatever, and poems
published in any of those publications multiplied by
the rating of the publication it's in.

We can't let the people getting poems that are making
significicant use of techniques not in wide use fifty
or more years ago sneak by with mere zeroes because
they have nothing in magazines like the Atlantic
Monthly!

Umm.... can I opt out of being VAPD? I kind of like these lists as far
away as possible from actual sources for new literature, thank you.

     Incident


It was dawn when they came to kill us.  The bleak sun
of winter was only a whitening of the mist
over the far hills from where they came.
The earliest screams brought others from their houses,
and their cries roused more sleepers out to die.
My mother, who'd gone for water, was one of the first.
Young as I was, I still ran to protect her,
was stabbed in the chest and thigh and fell to earth
as she fell over me:  lying there, I felt her
give three desperate gasps, as if the air
could anchor her to life, then breathe no more.
Some instinct made me lie completely quiet,
and since the murderers turned to deal with those
our fight had drawn outdoors, I kept my life,
seeing through the lashes of one eyelid
how neighbors, cousins, friends all died around me.
It all seemed very slow and ordinary:
the killers took their time and liked their work.
Their victims each met death a different way:
some pouring curses out with their life's blood,
some vainly bartering with promised gold,
some weeping childlike tears of acquiescence,
some pleading youth or age or prime of life
as reasons why their case should be exempted,
some numb with horror, some quite mad and laughing.
Their deaths were individual as their lives,
and as identical as all lives' ends.
The raiders left to search for people hiding,
and I crawled out from under my mother's body
and lowered myself into the largest well,
the only one with hand- and foot-holds in it,
fearing that they'd come back, and I was right.
For centuries I heard the further slaughter,
bleeding into the slimy rock I clung to.
Twice I was grazed by bundles tumbling down
to sound the earth's wet heartbeat far below.
I don't remember coming out, but somehow
I was standing in the sunlight watching people
loading the dead for hauling and looking on me
with amazed kindness.  They pulled up from my well
the bodies of two children, a boy and a girl,
both with slit throats, the bruises still
livid on the girl's small and hairless sex.
There were inquiries held, of course, but no one punished.
The government blamed the rebels, the rebels the army,
and the army denied it.  The rulers had no answers,
the priests had no answers, the poets had no answers.
Only in silent dreams, two naked children,
angelic, unblemished, with grave and luminous eyes,
hold the answers flowering in their hands.

This means we should all have also been Jews which I fell is nonsense -
there are no chosen people (everyone keeps claiming that THEY are the ones!!
chosen ..)  - I believe  - that while there are great cultural differences
around the world -we are also - inside ourselves - human (which I think is
the great message of The Merchant of Venice)- this not to argue that we do
not respect cultural and religious differences -now the conjunction of the
Nazis in Lodz  and Nazi Germany with something by Heidegger about Muslims is
confusing - I can see parallels between Israel/and the US and Nazi Germany -
but there is a difference - are differences - the differences are complex -
there are parallels in that some of the Zionists have a repressive policy
against Palestinians - but to be fair or unfair this has happened throughout
history - the people or country A that has been bashed finds another people
or country to bash.

No one yet has quite equaled the awfulness of the Holocaust - there are
lessons to be learnt - in Lodz - with hindsight -- fire needed to be met
with fire - but the Nazis had the upper hand  - a lot of their members were
street thugs and criminals - the communists etc were probably not ready - no
one ever is - these things kind creep up (as in the US now we have
a"creeping" fascism - in some ways it is accelerating) - but the planners
and the ruling class in the US are more sophisticated than the Nazis (you
could say they have a more 'rational' program  -although its hard to see the
logic of a lot going on  - the logic and methods are more or less more
subtle ( or the Imperialists in contrast to the Nazis confuse people about
why they are doing what and don't waste energy setting up hundreds of
extermination camps although there are a number of concentration camps set
up)  than the Nazis  - the Israelis and the US Imperialists share similar
aims -control of the middle east, power, . ..expansion ..oil..drug money -
the need for cheap labour sources - - to head off the other big nations (who
are slowly and ominously gaining on US Imperialism which is in decline)   -
Germany wanted to destroy Russia (so did most of the Western Powers  - they
didn't want communism) - well Russia is its fragmented now, and weak, the US
probably dreams of destroying China as it is strong (and well armed -and a
potential threat) and India if it gets to strong - its all a little more
sophisticated than invading Russia and machine gunning thousands of
"degenerates" but..there are similatiraties. Propaganda is more
sophisticated - anyone watching the TV sees a happy - sophisticated US -
family shows or they see heroic people doing dare devil things or whatever:
everything looks clean and wonderful over there, even the 'violent"
programs" look good -exciting stuff - the "goodies" win mostly... - with
some exceptions the general impression is that white people (and some token
blacks who are educated and wash etc) are good, and wogs etc in robes, are
bad - Jews aren't so bad as they are funny like Seinfeld and complex like
Bronowski and various US movie makers...

In some ways Iraq etc are just the foreplay of what's to come if no one
stops the Imperialists - etc  - but there  is a degree of restraint compared
to the Nazis - but there  are indeed parallels- it has been said that Israel
is fascist state ( its really just another "branch" of the US - may as well
be a State of the US )- it is fascistic but  it isn't quite like Nazi
Germany - things are done more subtly and within Israel/USA there is  a
Western democratic parliament (dubious as I am of such so-called democratic
set ups) but  - sure the Palestinians have been hammered - the Jews were
hammered - in there interests of US Imperialist expansion someone will
always get hammered - Muslims, Jews., Hindus, blacks in Africa or the US or
wherever - the American Indians Maori etc etc- anyone - will be bought off
and put to work to slaughter -whoever it doesn't matter - so as to keep the
state of perpetual war going - divide et imperum - divide and rule is the
method as the Romans knew - but Heidegger  - to return to him - was a Nazi
!! I think some of his ideas are interesting and his methodology but all
this stuff about Dasein or Muslims being Jews etc etc is - well its ok as a
kind of mystical poetry but I dont think it helps things...Heidegger
probably couldn't even boil an egg for himself...

I think Houlihan is a philistine, but can any of those
critical of her tell me why she's wrong to not think
much of the Andrews text (which is prose, as far as
I'm concerned, although I don't consider that a
defect)?  I'm neutral on it, not having had time to
sit down with it for a reasonable length of time.  I
have read stuff of his I liked, though--and I have
read others' work that seemed to use similar tactics
and liked it.  In the not-yet-out final issue of Lost
& Found Times, in fact, I do a close reading of a
similarly initially off-putting poem by John M.
Bennett.  My point?  That there are people as
foolishly automatically yea-sayers as Houlihan is
foolishly automatically a nay-sayer.

I'm also interested in what specifically is in this
poem that makes people like it.  I'm still very much
at sea about what I more and more consider
non-representational poetry.

Hello all:  check these out.  Please forgive cross-posting.  js

Two upcoming programs in New Langton Arts' "Performance Writing" series,
curated by Jocelyn Saidenberg ... the series brings multi-disciplinary
literary artists to Langton to present works that explore language in the
context of live performance.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
PERFORMANCE WRITING #1
David Larsen and Michelle Tea

Thursday February 3, 8 pm
Tickets $6/$4 members, students, seniors


New Langton Arts presents literary artists David Larsen and
Michelle Tea reading from new and recent works in the new Performance
Writing series. Larsen reads from his forthcoming poetry collection, The
Thorn. Michelle Tea reads excerpts from an unpublished narrative that delve=
s
into the chaotic complexity of a dysfunctional family. For Langton=B9s new
Performance Writing series, literary artists present works that explore
language while directly engaging with the audience in the act of live
performance. Working in sound, video, spoken word, installation, mixed-medi=
a
and performance, these artists defy the conventions of the reading as the
viewer and listener becomes accomplice and collaborator.

David Larsen presents his poetry with animation and fervor, transcending th=
e
confines of the conventional reading by inviting the audience into his
fictional worlds. His performances have included the use of masks and film
projections.  At Langton he reads in his signature booming baritone from a
soon-to-be-released collection of poetry, The Thorn.

Bay Area author and spoken word artist Michelle Tea writes
semi-autobiographical narratives about dysfunctional families, queer love,
work, rock and death. She reads from an unpublished work-in-progress, which
she describes as a =B3fictional tale of a surly teenager who shares a home in
Saugus, Massachusetts with her hypochondriac mother, her mother=B9s mulleted
boyfriend, and her sister, a recent high school graduate with serious
reality TV-show aspirations.=B2
=20

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

PERFORMANCE WRITING #2
Caroline Bergvall and Brendan Fowler/BARR

Thursday February 17, 8 pm
Tickets $6/$4 members, students, seniors


New Langton Arts presents the second program in the new
Performance Writing series, featuring cross-disciplinary =B3readings=B2 by
literary artists Caroline Bergvall and Brendan Fowler.  Poet and
multi-disciplinary artist Caroline Bergvall works in sound, video and
site-specific installation as part of her wide-ranging, often multi-lingual
text-based performances.  Brendan Fowler combines rock musicianship, poetry=
,
and spoken word in his irreverent, political performances, interlacing
inspirational space with studied observations. The Performance Writing
series, curated by Jocelyn Saidenberg, brings multi-disciplinary literary
artists to Langton to present works that explore language in the context of
live performance, defying the conventions of the reading as the viewer and
listener becomes accomplice and collaborator.

Caroline Bergvall=B9s Langton program includes the works GONG, DOG (homage
Kathy Acker), SCRATCH (after Brion Gysin), 8 FIGS and &, a collage of piece=
s
incorporating video installation, sound, visuals, and live reading.  Brenda=
n
Fowler performs as the acronym BARR (=B3B is for political; A is for drums; R
is for music; and R is for right now!=B2), presenting a program of all-new
work (forthcoming on Kill Rock Stars, 2005) incorporating pre-recorded indi=
e
rock-inflected original music and live spoken text.  Fowler also performs
selections from his most recent recording, =B3What Would the Second BARR=B2
(2004, DoggPony Records).

The 17th-century dramatist/critic Thomas Rymer's writings on Shakespeare =
are well-known instances of incredibly hostile criticism.  The most =
famous passage (which I've pinched from the internet):
  Whatever rubs or difficulty may stick on the bark, the moral use of =
this fable is very instructive. First, this may be a caution to all =
maidens of quality, how, without their parents' consent, they run away =
with blackamoors. Secondly, this may be a warning to all good wives, =
that they look well to their linen. Thirdly this may be a lesson to =
husbands, that before their jealousy be tragical, the proofs may be =
mathematical. . . . Whence comes it then, that this is the top scene, =
the scene that raises "Othello" above all other tragedies at our =
theatres? It is purely from the action, from the mops and the mows, the =
grimace, the grins, and gesticulation. Such scenes as this have made all =
the world run after Harlequin, and Scaramoucio. The several degrees of =
action were amongst the ancients distinguished by the cothurnus, the =
soccus, and the planipes. Had this scene been represented at Old Rome, =
Othello and Iago must have quitted their buskins, they must have played =
barefoot: for the spectators would not have been content without seeing =
their podometry; and the jealousy work out at the very toes of them. . . =
. There is in this play some burlesk, some humour, and ramble of comical =
wit, some show, and some mimicry to divert the spectators; but the =
tragical part is clearly none other than a bloody farce, without salt or =
savour. -- RYMER, THOMAS, 1693, A Short View of the Tragedy of the Last =
Age.=20
It was Rymer whose views were critiqued by contemporaries like Dryden. =
(It didn't help that Rymer's own efforts as a playwright were so =
ludicrous.)

Bismillah ir-rahman ir-rahim

Asalaam alaikum,

Some people are afraid to speak out, they are afraid someone might hear. =
Dr. Mustafa ibn Talib has been unjustly put among the people of the hellf=
ire. He is innocent and honest. He waged Jihad against the oppressor. Now=
 he=92s locked up in prison, to burn like a thief. Allah tests those Hu l=
oves, and delivers to them special keys. The key of the believer is freed=
om and ease. Yes, Mustafa is in prison. Mustafa is of God=92s holy soldie=
rs. He is being tested the hardest, oppression is worse than death, Allah=
 loves those Hu tests. From our brother Mustafa, comes a beacon of truth.=
 The pure message is spoken. Read through the brother=92s articles, there=
 are many messages hidden in them. The word manifests in many places, in =
the places of slavery. Allah loves the oppressed and hates the oppressor.=


May Allah continue to guide the oppressed in the lands, giving them freed=
om and bliss!

Message To My People
By Mustafa Ibn Talib


As-Salamu-Alaykum and all power to the people, Black brothers, Black sist=
ers, and my people worldwide, regardless of race. I want you to know that=
 I love you and I hope that somewhere in your heart you have love for me.=
 My name is Mustafa Ibn Talib (slave name Andre Lancaster) and I'm a revo=
lutionary. A Black revolutionary. By that I mean that I have declared war=
 on all forces that have raped our women, castrated our men, and kept our=
 toddlers starving. I have declared war on the rich who get richer off ou=
r poverty, the trickitians who lie to us with smiling faces, and all the =
mindless, heartless robots who protect them and their bloody property. I =
am a victim of all the hatred, lies, racism and slander that America is r=
esponsible of. Like all other freedom fighters, America has lynched me. I=
 am a Black revolutionary, and by definition, that makes me a member of t=
he Black Liberation Army. The system has used their image making tools to=
 paint freedom fighters as vicious, brutal, heartless criminals. They hav=
e painted us as characters like John Gotti and Nicki Barnes. It should be=
 clear to all people who can see, think, hear or feel for themselves that=
 we are the victims. You must know by now who the real criminals are. Cli=
nton and his crime partners have murdered millions of Third World brother=
s and sisters in Iraq, Bosnia, Kosovo, Sudan, Ethiopia, Algeria, Palestin=
e, Lebanon and East Africa. As it was proven by Whitewater and the Iran C=
ontra Affair, the top law enforcement officials in this country are a lyi=
ng bunch of criminals.


They call us murderers, but we did not slaughter thousands and thousands =
of unarmed Black men, women, and children during the 60's, 70's, 80's and=
 90's. They call us murderers, but we were not responsible for the murder=
s of thousands of inmates across Amerika's prisons, we did not wound stud=
ents from Rutgers University either. They killed Martin Luther King Jr. ,=
 Fred Hampton, Malcolm X, Emmett Till, Medger Evers, George Lester Jackso=
n, Nat Turner, James Chaney, Lil Bobby Hutton, Mark Clark, and countless =
others. We do not control this system of racism and oppression that syste=
matically murders Black and Third World people. They call us bandits, yet=
 every time most Black people pick up our paychecks we are being robbed. =
Everytime we walk into a store in our neighborhood we are being held up. =
And every time we pay our rent the landlord sticks a gun into our ribs. T=
hey call us theives, but we did not rob and murder millions of Indians by=
 ripping off their homeland, then call ourselves pioneers. They call us b=
andits, but it is not we who are robbing Africa, Asia, Arabia, and Latin =
America of their natural resources and freedom while the people who live =
there are sick and starving. The dictators of this country and their flun=
kies have committed some of the most brutal crimes in history. They are m=
aniacs and are not fit to judge any Black and third world people on trial=
 in America. People should, and inevitably must determine our destinies. =
They call us thieves. But it was them who stole millions of Black people =
from the continent of Africa. We were robbed of our language, culture, re=
ligion, of our human dignity, of our labor, lives and liberty. They have =
stolen billions of dollars through tax evasion, illegal price fixing, emb=
ezzlement, consumer fraud, bribes, kickbacks, and swindles. Every revolut=
ion in history has been accomplished by actions, although words are neces=
sary. We must create a defense that defends us against our enemies. Peopl=
e, lets learn from our mistakes. I want to apologise to you for involving=
 myself in the group, dealing with micro power radio. I should have known=
 better, when there are those whose politics and ideologies are different=
, there is bound to be political rebellion. Agents of suppression have tr=
ied and have succeeded for now in their plot. I admit my mistake. Revolut=
ionaries must never be in too much of a hurry or make unthinkable decisio=
ns. He who runs when the sun is sleeping will stumble for sure. Everytime=
 a freedom fighter is murdered or captured, the system claims victory and=
 vows the liberation army is squashed. Revolutionaries are being manufact=
ured in prisons like San Quentin, Sing Sing and McDonald. All people from=
 different walks of life have joined the ranks of the freedom struggle.


It is my duty to fight for freedom
It is our duty to win
We must love each other and support each other
We have nothing to lose but these chains
In the spirit of revolutionaries of the past, I love you Mamma - Assata S=
haku

Wait a mo. It's been probably 40 years since I read Timber, but I remember
Jonson's remarks as mostly complimentary, tho talking about his friend as
human rather than god. It was I think the first serious reading of
Shakespeare, and he didn't like everything.

And of course there was the rewriting of Shakespeare to make him conform to
literary norms.

My favorite Shakespeare rewrite is more in the order of feeling permitted
to use him as a source to build on. I'm not talking about Stoppard, who's
merely clever, but of Dryden and Davenant (the latter, then poet laureate,
claiming to be Shakespeare's illegitimate son--despite the blight on his
other's reputation he thought it conferred something on him), who did a
hilarious version of The Tempest as french farce, complete with female
survivors and a female Caliban and a male Miranda. Apparently they loved
the play but didn't think it sacred ground. I'd love to see it performed,
or even filmed--would give Prospero's Books a run for its money.

The great anti-Shakespeare writer I remember is Bernard Shaw, not quite=20
Shakespeare's time.

Subject:      SUBTEXT READING - Alicia Cohen and Seattle School
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; format=flowed

Subtext continues its monthly series of experimental writing with readings
by
Alicia Cohen and Seattle School at Richard Hugo House on Wednesday, February
2,
2005.  Donations for admission will be taken at the door on the evening of
the
performance.  The reading starts at 7:30pm.

Alicia Cohen lives in Portland, Oregon, where, in 2000, she helped establish
the
art space collective Pacific Switchboard.  She has published a book of
poems,
_bEAR_, with Handwritten Press and last year wrote, directed, and produced a
multimedia opera and gallery installation titled "Northwest Inhabitation
Log."
Her work has recently appeared in Ecopoetics, How2, Bird Dog, and Traverse.
She
earned her doctorate at SUNY Buffalo, writing a dissertation about vision
and
epistemology in the work of Jack Spicer, Emily Dickinson, Leslie Scalapino,
and
Robert Duncan.  She is the poetry editor for the Organ review of Arts.

Seattle School was established in 2002 as a performance group interested in
exploring sound and music, primarily in terms of spatial relations, memory,
deep-time/wide-incidence, calculus, communication/notation, failure,
physicality, and inquiries into the definitions of tone, language, and
audience.
Influences include the Futurists, Dada, Earle Brown, Fluxus, Aktionists,
Yoko
Ono, Irritart, John Cage, Abbie Hoffman, Buster Keaton, Harry Partch, Alvin
Lucier, Andy Kaufman, video game audio implementation, and No Wave.

Mike Min was honorably discharged from the US Army.  Between 1998 and 2000,
he
released three independent CD's: Popollution, At Chateau Dunbar, and The
Aberdeen Transplant (2000).  He has scored for the films True and Black
Sheep of
Chinatown, and, for a brief period until its demise, IgooTV employed Min as
its
resident composer.  He is a member of the Seattle Composers Alliance and
serves
as the Vice President of Sound Currents.

Korby Sears attended the University of North Texas as a composition major,
with
an instrumental concentration in organ performance.  He has contributed
music
and sound design to projects in diverse media, including a number of films
and
video games.  As a performer, Korby has been principal contrabassist for the
Sammamish Symphony, a pit orchestra member of the Peccadillo Players, and a
freelance jazz pianist, accordionist, and contrabassist with various jazz
ensembles. He has written for The Stranger, Seattle Weekly and P-Form
Magazine.
He curates the Seattle Composers Alliance Score Salon series, a monthly
orchestral score study group.

The Subtext 2005 schedule is:

March 2, 2005 - Kerri Sonnenberg (Chicago) and Drew Kunz

ben jonson

from the way read him -  gave reasonable due to Shakespeare..perhaps the
tragedy is no one one realised how great W S was in his own time - did he
realise himself ?? did he care? (Pessoa writes about this somewhere) - it is
hard to see these things - and we are rightly critical (or maybe right to be
discerning) - it would be harder for Shakespear's contemporaries than Dr
Johnson say - to take a good look at Shakespear - Hazlitt also writes on
Shakespeare - but I dont think that Robert Greene is realy criticising
Shakespeare the poet/playwrite - he is just seeing a rival and is jealous...

I once saw a production of Hamlet as teenager - I think it was very good
English comany touring NZ - but at one point - maybe the Yorick
scene -someone laughed - and from then on, at every critical or dramatic
moment there was great laughter from the audience !! I also joined in as -
indeed - seen in certain ways - anything can be funny...the audience kind of
got the giggles (it was not malicious, and the players didn't miss a beat,
and completed the play with great aplomb) - the other thing is  that Hamlet
is based on the revenge style/tradition (so the whole theme was almost
clichaic possibly even when Shakespear wrote the play  - or at least it had
a form well tried) of plays of  which genre it is ( cf. The Spanish Tragedy
and The Revenger's Tragedy)  I love the Revenger's Tragedy!) - I love
Shakespear -but also Ben Jonson's work - I wish more of his plays had been
put on video etc or performed more I know there is are a few on film but I
would like to see  Bartholomew's Fair as film - either as a the play or
based on....

I cant read Greek but - does anyone think that any of say
Sophocles,Aeschylus, Euripidies, Aristophenies etc are in the same league as
Shakespeare?

I especially liked Sophocles's "Oedipus Rex" etc  (in translation) (have
only just learnt the Greek alphabet)

I know someone is going to talk about the problem of "The Canon" and I
gree  - it is problematic - hence I suspect Aaron  is planning some satire
!!  But interesting - if we can get some basic parameters to compare these
various writers "for the sake of .. (enlightenment?)"

I think I'd stand by my original "sniffy" -- an ambiguous response on
Jonson's part.

Off the top of my head, the two comments in _Timber_ are (roughly) that the
players complimented Shakespeare on never revising a line.  Would he had
revised many of them, says Jonson.  And a remark that something Julius
Caesar says doesn't make sense.  (Oddly, the line in JC as we have it
*isn't* open to Jonson's objection, leading some people to think Shakespeare
may have revised it in the light of Jonson's comment.  Possibly not from
Timber itself, but from a pre-Timber comment in the Mermaid.)

In the Conversations (pissed out of his skull and retailing London literary
gossip to the fascinated William Drummond,) he says: "Shakespeare lacked
art."

Oh, I forgot this earlier, but there's the Stagekeeper's comments at the
beginning of _Bartholomew Fair_ which dismiss Titus Andronicus and The
Winter's Tale as respectively fusty and silly.

Slightly critical, yes, but I think Mark's right in that together they do
suggest that Jonson took Shakespeare seriously.

Against all that, of course, is the elegy/eulogy by Jonson prefixed to the
First Folio -- "What needs my Shakespeare for these honoured bones?" --
which is both more complimentary and more considered.

It's worth looking at what Bob Grumman says in "Upstart Crow" (in the URL I
gave) -- he thoroughly unteases the passage.

Hi Kevin:
It's not clear to me what your aim is in presenting us with these
quotes.  It is certainly true that there was a kind of puppet
governance in the ghettos, and that Jews were put in charge of
policing Jews.  But this kind of selective quoting and juxtaposition
of the Zizek with the foregoing is extremely disturbing and appears
to be intended as a provocation: i.e. what used to be called
Jew-baiting.

Since I've seen you post other stuff on the list, about Benjamin etc,
it is hard for me to believe that this is your intent; but reading
this, it's hard to believe that it is *not* your intent.

Can you explain?

It makes me very anxious that, in these politically ominous times,
i'm seeing something on the list that is all too historically
familiar.  Let's be clear that it is not "the Jews" who are running
this country into the ground and dispossessing millions around the
world and at home.

Sorry but Houlihan is always hilarious in her inability to move beyond the
narrowest confines of what she believes poetry ought to be.  You can't really
argue with her because she simply repeats her (tired) list of markers that tell
her she's reading "poetry."  Absence of markers, absence of poetry -- in her
estimation.  Yet her own stuff is so mannered that it's almost unreadable.

I suppose what's more amazing about Houlihan is that she's obviously read
outside of her area yet remains unable to acknowledge that there are "poetries."
She reminds me of the Neo-classicists.  [5 acts, unity of time and place.]
They hated Shakespeare for his unruliness and lack of convention, you  may
recall.

I agree with LH in her introduction, the idea of "bestness" is always
problematic.  But it's a marketing issue:  Can you sell an anthology titled "Of The
Poems Published in 2004 Here's a Group I Thought Might Interest You"?  But
surely that's what being sold.

So what to do about someone like Houlihan?  Ignore her?  Shun her?  Attack
her?  Don't publish her if you edit a journal and she submits?  Do we want her
love?  Her approbation?  (There's a word.)

For me, I enjoy her essays because I can smell her fear.  She's certain that
the inmates are taking over and it scares her to death.

Also to note: Adrienne Rich and Louise Gluck, neither
of whom would probably be aligned with Hejinian by
Houlihan, both took strong issue with "bestness" and
addressed it (albeit in very differing ways) in both
their prefaces to their "Bests" (Rich did in 1996 and
Gluck in 1993) and in their selection process for the
book.

What's funny is that *every* single one of the judges
of that particular series has *always* only chosen
poetries of their own interest. The most aesthetically
diverse of the ones I myself have read are Creeley's,
Hass's, Graham's, and this new one by Lyn Hejinian.
But when has it not been "Of all the poems published
last year here's some I thought would interest you."
It's just that certain judges are clear about this.

i choose to ignore. who the hell is this joan houlihan and why shd i
care.  did she write "On Some Motifs in Baudelaire?"  did she write
"Poetry and Fate of the Senses?"  did she write "American Poetry and
the Public?" did she write "The Poetics of Relation?"  Did she write
"The Nervous System?"  Did she write that Ross Talarico book whose
name i forget?  no, she did not.  in fact,i can't tihnk of a single
thing that she has written that i find compelling enough to even be
motivated to read.  so why shd i pay attention?

You should care because she supplies a different perspective than is usually
found on this list. I don't subscribe it in my own work, but, by responses
such as yours, she stirs up some thinking. That's what a critic should do.

It amazes me how defensive people get about her writing...
Obviously, her essays/reviews are effective and getting a reaction out
of people. Should everyone just agree with the ideology of the
"post-avant"? Sounds mighty Republican to me. Ah, the Grand Ole Party!

Dear All:

This is the big weekend, friends! BIG! Friday night, many of us will
participate in a reading at the Albright-Knox organized by Just
Buffalo as part of the museum's "Free Fridays" series. The line-up:
Manson, Cole, Campbell, Cross, Basinski, Donovan, Big Larry, etc. (Who
am I forgetting? Is Skinner reading??). It's free, and there may be
some manifestation of a DJ spinning records. Clifton Hall, 6-8pm, Fri.
28th.

THEN! Saturday night, we celebrate the book release of Eli Drabman's
_the ground running_. He is one of our own, and his book is BIG (in
dimensions!) and GOOD. He will be reading with Robert Paradez (from
Brooklyn) at Big Orbit (30D Essex) Saturday evening (the 29th) at 7
pm. Bring cash! All Atticus/Finch chaps will be on hand and CHEAP (5 a
piece).

Bye,
Michael

MIME-Version: 1.0

Maria,

There's a memoir by someone who was with Benjamin in detention in
France, where he's quoted as having said something about what was
happening then which included the remark, "proletarianization of the
Jews."

This may be one of the differences between the Warsaw and Lodz
ghettos. Poland's Manchester was converted into an accelerated
production site for uniforms by exploiting pre-existing social and
class divisions in addition to using overwhelming military and police
force.

Is it at all possible that the sublimity of the evil of the 1940s
holocaust intensifies into hyper-abstraction in proportion to which
the social and class divisions within that targeted population
dissolve into the more attractive idea of the mass victim?

The present subject line remembers an invitation you made some time
ago to tour the site in the Twin Cities at a certain bridge, and it
occurred to me at the time that the problem of the humor could pass
unremarked in a country and a condition where there is no trace in the
architecture from which the "proletarianized" leapt out of
windows--that is a difference, and distance.

Lodz was not destroyed in the war. The names of the streets were not
changed. Many of the buildings still stand. The Chronicle of the Lodz
Ghetto, three volumes in German and Polish of which the English
edition is an abridged version, documents the street and address where
this or that person threw themselves. Most of the buildings have only
two or three stories. Sometimes they did not die for days. What
historical memory, if any, persists in these buildings and streets
David Lynch has expressed such fondness for? Only Disney can do the
image.

Lefebvre: "Now that distance has been explained, and its necessity,
have you first understood this profound irony: that the dark side, the
negative, creates what is most positive?" Ranciere, speaking in Berlin
last week, would have disagreed, for he was speaking out against the
negative, the counter-move, the shock effect.

Or is the subject line, Lodz Ghetto, a negative moment in the
dialectic of recent and distant past (Benjamin's) that should include,
among other things, the obscene laughter about that bridge in the Twin
Cities? By way of contrast, in the winter of 2001-2002 in Russia a
statue of Mandelstam was raised in Vladivostok. The two poets do not
bear comparison, but the cultural gap between the joke and the statue
signfies something?

Inke Arns, chairing a panel of Russian and Albanian leftists at the
same conference where Ranciere and Mouffe spoke, mentioned the tactic
of over-identification which emerged as one form of resistance in art
under the pre-1989 regimes in Eastern European and the former Soviet
Union.

Could one intention motivating the counter-move to the original
subject line, Lodz Ghetto, have been an explicit act of
over-identification with the manifest text of that message targeting
the name of a foreign and formerly occupied city?

What else is being targeted by the dominant, the American
righteousness--or worse, if there is a subtext that has nothing to do
with the political issue of the Middle East, for that would be
cynicism--and its appeal to "ce qui reste d'Auschwitz"?

All that reads like the start of a book or story by Umberto Eco or Borges !!
I'm glad I am not a Shakespearian scholar or  a student studying the
complexities of the historicity of finding who Shakespear was or what he was
or - actually there are some fascinating questions here  - eg how do we know
about history and who wrote what?  It applies to certain situations today in
understanding or in beliving who said what in politcs etc - it is
historiography -philosophy etc or it reminds me of that big section in
Ullysses that I recall had me baffled - I suppose I can get an
interpretation somewhere to look at it again - but its almost as if we are
creating Shakespear (or he has been created sice he first appeared on the
'stage' - or perhaps before that !! maybe before he was born!! Or
prolepticaly by ..Joyce or someone?)) - or that he never existed - I believe
this magical stuff  is/was Baudrillard's forte  - but have never read the
man - - but I thought that his 'suppose' not to = 'pretend' was dubious
...as in sense when we 'suppose' we do in fact 'pretend' - he needed to
explain a bit that 'pretend' has several meanings - or at least
connotations...

The questions are did he mean that WS

 1) was only a lowly actor with no Greek and little Latin who thought
himself (wrongly) good enough to write blank verse  and plays that fact were
not well written.
(conceited -of course with the double entendre of arrogance and also he was
too prolix, tooo "winding" - long winding - long winded....a windy bag - a
Shag bag speared...)

2)  and hence because of this (and other amters pending and reallted or in
conjunct or of relative relvance or not)) it is clear he is referring to
Shakespear as the author - not Oxford etc ???!?

3) was a plagiarist - perhaps only in the line quoted by Greene (and Grunman
is quoting from is Alexander or someone who believes Shakespear was Oxfrod
or Bacon ? No?)

4) Other.

There are further possibilties - 'Shake-scene'  (obscene  implied in their
also?) is clever - in fact could the whole thing not  have been written by
Shakespear himself? In conjuntion with Greene etal who actually admired WS
and this was an opportunity for some propaganda for Bill? And we have lost
the rest? The follow ups...

My 'old' Professor at Auckland University - not that older than myself - Mac
Jackson would love all this  - he is an expert in Shakesperean
scholarship...

But surely it is resolved by the old chestnut :  "Shakespear's plays were
not written by Shakespeare but by another person of the same name"  !!?  (of
course this is further deepened by the fact atht saheks spear clearly
didntknwo he he was  himself as he spelt (spelt - doth that not contain the
word or part of the word "spell'  -was he perhaps a conjuror?) his own name
in several different ways!!

Shakespeare - it is strange how this incredible genius of words appears out
of nothing and tells of everything radiating throughout time including the
nothing.

Yes, I think so.

It's recorded that the Chorus of Furies in Aeschylus' Eumenides was so
terrifying that when they appeared on stage, women had miscarriages and y=
oung
boys died of fright right there in the theatre.  Not even Shakespeare got=

reviews like that.

That's interesting about Aeschylus - that play -is that part of the Orestian
Cycle?  - I think that - as plays - with the choruses or chori -
the effect could be dramatic  -
I heard a long talk about the one and only opera by  Enesco (I think that is
the spelling of his name) (he knew/taught Yehudi Menuhin) called "Oedipus" I
think - but at the end of this talk - which was fascinating - they didn't
play it! And I cant find it anywhere... But I can imagine that being a great
play -especially if one knew Greek - that is, if it was in one's own
language...

Euripides's play about Dionysus would be great to see also - I once saw a
production of Lysistrata - done well - it was very funny.
-----------------------------------------------------
Robin etal

On my magnum opus re Shakespeare ....For the record some selling error fixed
etc

The questions are did he mean that W.S. :

[Various questions or matters arising] The it should have been:

There are further possibilties - 'Shake-scene'  (obscene  implied in their
also?) is clever - in fact could the whole thing not  have been written by
Shakespear himself? In conjuntion with Greene etal who actually admired WS
and this was an opportunity for some propaganda for Bill? And we have lost
the rest? The follow ups...

[A reference to Mc Jackson - Shakespearian expert]

 But surely it is resolved by the old chestnut :  "Shakespear's plays were
not written by Shakespeare but by another person of the same name"  !!?

 The riddle of Shakespeare  is further deepened by the fact that Shakespear
clearly didnt know who he was himself, as he spelt his own name in several
different ways!

 Shakespeare - it is strange how this incredible genius of words appears out
of nothing and tells of everything radiating throughout time including the
nothing.

                        "[I]t seems possible that we have come to a time
                        when it no longer matters so much what the caring
                        is about, how frail or foolish is the object of
                        that concern, as long as the feeling itself can be
                        saved. Naivete--the infantile and ignoble joy in
                        the middle of the night over the haphazardous
                        flight of a distant ball--seems a small price to

I'd put myself in that elite club as well.  But it's not just the
poetics list I use to vent my algorithmic confections.  I approach all
lists as a filter to write into | through | around  even other
non-poetry lists I'm on like north american fruit explorers,
learn_romanian, african grey parrots ....

I'm not a Digest user, but yes! sounds like a great idea -- if it can be
worked out, yes.

Since many of us receive the Poetics list in digest form
and many of those who do express occasional grumpiness
about  the list getting crammed with poems (and other
creative self-publishing projects) - and being told, upon
the reception of such grumpiness, 'hey, just use the delete
button', I was wondering if there might be some way of
finessing this (so the digest-receivers don't have to
constantly scroll through everything to find what they are
looking for).

Would it be possible - and desirable - to simply sort
the digest into categories and have them in a predictable
order?
For my part, I could see
1. Announcements
2. Discussings, Comments, Queries
3. Poems, algorithmic confections, etc.
as separate categories
and I could happily imagine them stacked in that order,
rather than having categories of things that people would
want to scroll through being veined throughout the digest
in a way that requires going through the entirety looking
for what you want to read.

Curious to know what others thought.
Cheers,
Bruce Andrews

Dear Poetics Listees,
Yes - I'd welcome a change like the one suggested.

(I've also been a bit irritated by the posts that
aren't trimmed before being sent as a reply - that can
be annoying on a digest. But I guess that's harder to
change)

Best wishes,
Pam

I don't use the digest - but if an "implied ambivalence " can be assumed
towards using this as a way of getting one's poetry seen - then to me that
sounds like elitism and preciousness - we should be looking at poetry and
discussing it: especially as it comes on - is not poetics also the practice
of writing poetry? - there are hundreds of announcements (are announcements
poetics? - I think that the mix of all these 'texts' is kind of ongoing
poem/poetics, or could be thus seen)) - all very good  - and sometimes
offers for jobs -

 but insufficient Ã©lan on here - no warmth to new people such as Jon who
tried to get a discussion going re the nature of poetry  - not enough
tolerance - surprise - yes - that's good - that thing by McGee was maybe
disturbing somewhat and I found it puzzling

(it seemed to be 'unconnected' - almost 'absentminded', as if the writer had
misplaced several millions of people somewhere between 1939 and 1945,
quoting Heidegger the ex-nazi who -while being interesting and quite poetic
in his writings - is rather a muddled thinker at the best of times: though I
do like his thing on Van Gogh's shoes, I suppose, though... but at least it
sparked a few responses - and he followed it up with some interesting or
more interesting gobbledygook - but therein, paradoxically, lay its
interest, in its coming from 'nowhere' or seeming to - its surprise)

 and also it was maybe at bad time - but at least the guy was trying to get
his teeth into an issue - probably the most important issue of the 20th
Century and still greatly important -  there is  - or the paranoid in me
feels there is -a kind of fussy elite group of lurkers who wait until they
can talk gobbledygook, and others who fire off sudden sparks of sarcastics -
and sometimes incomprehensible comments - very little warmth - hardly any
encouragment - no - mix the poetry amongst the other stuff - let it disturb
or challenge - I think that Nudel, Alan, Jeff Harris and August and others
are challenging and frightening the inner sanctum of the Lang Party with
their poems of various styles...

But I could be completely wrong - Bruce may just like order - and we all are
both attracted and repelled by chaos - to survive in the random fire we need
lakes of order.

But to me the implication of poems onto here - as one avenue - shows the way
(or a way) that a writer can move from the traditional outlets ("official"
publications etc) - perhaps the poems need to be followed up with serious
discussions -  there isn't that much poetry on here - it is unfortunate that
a lot of discussion goes off onto tangents leaving others out and or
responses are limp, sometimes disinterested.

But there are also good responses and there have been some very interesting
discussions on here also. Let us be mixed.

I disagree.

Which is an excellent reason for us to split things up by subject, I reckon.

Don't most mail-readers allow the grouping of
message by subject line? Maybe digest users
should consider using the tools they have at
hand to delete unwanted threads en masse.

We haven't heard from Lori E & the moderators but perhaps POETICS list
needs a bit of renovation to serve it's members in a more selective
way.  If the list was broken into three subcategories,

Poetics-Announcements

Poetics-Discussion

Poetics-Poetry

With each person having the option to sub to each of them individually
then the load of messages would be filtered to each user's mailbox in a
more ergonomic manner.  We obviously have the feeling that there are a
lot of folks on here who only use this as a vehicle for announcements,
so why make them delete thru tens of messages on a daily basis just to
hear what is happening at the Poetry Project.

This would also address Bruce's digest conundrum.

discussion is often/sometimes centred around announcements and poetry, so
you might bleed off a lot of the life-blood of this list if you split it
this way however I've a feeling that poetry is debated more than
announcements. Still, even with announcements, the potential for discussion
is there and I'm sure has arisen in the past.

I'd prefer that the potential for discussion is increased rather than
decreased and this is what you're doing when you artificially split the
list.

Also, I've noticed both Drn & Alan uses their poetry to comment on the
discussion, as well as add to it. Not easy to parse there, not sure that
I'd want to keep it out of my daily reading. For me, all three strands form
a cohesive whole to my daily scanning.

As an alternate proposal, maybe the *digest* could be filtered of
announcements. Given some agreement by postees with a subject line like:

Announcement: <some text>

the offending emails could be automatically kept out of the digest. I can't
see that being onerous, particularly as announcees are often courteous in
their postings. Or a moderator could label stuff to be kept out of the
digest. Ditto poetry.

hi mIEKAL and all,

i've always thought of this list as a community, a place where i can hear about
a reading in L.A., problems a publisher is experiencing in Canada, and read work
from new poets from Australia. if, as you suggest mIEKAL, the list were divided
into three lists that'd be gone. could there be a way where people subscribe to
one list that is all three of yr suggested lists combined? sure. but then if
people wanted to over the period of a week post a separate item to each of the
three lists they'd have to be addressing three lists, not one. something simple
that could be done would be to have each poster put your one word categories
before there posts--announcements, discussion, poetry--and then people could
sort their email and read and delete accordingly.

and, as i backchanneled bruce, digest subscribers could alleviate their problems
by opening a separate list-only account where they receive the posts
individually. then just look at them the same time each day and you'll have a
24-hr digest that's sortable and where individual posts could be easily
deleted, without them popping up on yr main account throughout the day.

best,
david

(Caution:  some self promotion ahead)


Poetry X [sister site to Plagiarist.com] just posted
some of my poems:


http://poetry.poetryx.com/poets/418/


The editor is developing the site into a wonderful
resource:


"Poetry X is a web site devoted to increasing the
public's readership and appreciation of poetry via the
Internet. PoetryX.com is owned and operated by poet,
critic, and raconteur Jough Dempsey, who receives much
guidance and assistance from a number of generous
people online."


And ...


"As more poets contact us to publish their work, and
as Poetry X takes on more members and a wider
readership, the site will be able to provide even more
original content, criticism, analyses, and help for
students and poetry lovers alike (sometimes the two
groups do intersect, we know)."


Also ...


"Poetry Archives: the poetry archives contain poems
from the classic to contemporary. The poetry archives
are the oldest section of the site (and the reason for
making a poetry-related web site) and have been online
in one form or another since 1996 ...


Articles: the articles on Poetry X include a series on
writing poems, information about particular poems and
poets, articles about the business of poetry,
publishing, and society, canonical essays written
way-back-when, and all other writing and criticism
that didn't seem to fit anywhere else.


Analysis: in association with our sister site,
Plagiarist.com, we offer downloadable eBooks called
the 'PoetryNotes™.' Each PoetryNotes™ book offers a
complete analysis of a poem, background and
information about the poem, author, and period, a
biography of the poet, a detailed bibliography (works
cited), a glossary of poetic terms used in the
PoetryNotes™, and a guide to using the PoetryNotes™ to
write a successful essay or term paper.


Discussion Forums: visit our poetry discussion forums
to talk about all aspects poetry. You can post your
own poems for critique in the 'Members' Poetry Post,'
post questions or other topics for discussion."

WRITING WORKSHOPS AT THE POETRY PROJECT

KEEPING IT SIMPLE/LOOKING FOR THE LIGHT =AD PATRICIA SPEARS JONES
TUESDAYS AT 7 PM: 10 SESSIONS BEGIN FEBRUARY 22ND
"The quality of light by which we scrutinize our lives has direct bearing
upon the product which we live...It is within this light that we form those
ideas by which we pursue our magic and make it realized. This is poetry as
illumination." =AD from =B3Poetry is Not a Luxury=B2 by Audre Lorde. =B3This is a
poetry workshop that takes the poetry of illumination to mean the poetry of
experience. How we scrutinize, how we elucidate our lives through words and
rhythms, how we make our poems bring new ways of thinking about our lives.
We will focus on the basics: line, stanza, cadence, meter, diction, syntax,
and point of view -=AD the elements that make a poem. We will also read
contemporary poets including Audre Lorde, Maureen Owen, Amy Gerstler, Shara=
n
Strange, Lee Young Lee, Jeanne Marie Beaumont, Frank O'Hara, Lorenzo Thomas=
,
and Bob Kaufman.=B2 Patricia Spears Jones is an award-winning poet and
playwright, and author of The Weather That Kills. Students must submit 5-10

FINDING THE & THEN SOME THERE THERE =AD MERRY FORTUNE
THURSDAYS at 7 PM: 10 SESSIONS BEGIN FEBRUARY 24TH
Film of Dreyer, writing of Mayer, painting of Traylor. An identifiable poet
=B3voice=B2 is a desirable, comfortable and utilitarian achievement. But what
potential or beautiful mystery lurks beyond carefully cultivated form,
tendency, technique, habit and boundary. Exploring the processes, qualities
and aesthetics of all art forms we will collectively discover commonalities=
,
and fearlessly apprehend what we may learn to expand our poetic values and
vocabularies as well as our very minds. Merry Fortune is the author of
Ghosts By Albert Ayler, Ghosts By Albert Ayler (Futurepoem).

HYPNOSIS AND CREATIVITY =AD MAGGIE DUBRIS
FRIDAYS AT 7 PM: 5 SESSIONS BEGIN FEBRUARY 25TH
=B3Hypnotic and trance states have been used for centuries by shamans, mystic=
s
and visionaries. In this five week workshop, we will study techniques for
self-hypnosis that allow a writer to easily access the creative flow state.
We will explore the use of hypnotic tools to generate images, to increase
creative focus, to switch gears from a day job into writing, and to
circumvent creative blocks. We will also discuss the use of hypnosis to
vividly recall memories, and its use in conjunction with other creative
tools such as automatic writing.=B2 A $20 materials fee covers four of
Dubris=B9s hypnosis CDs, three of which are specifically geared to writing.
Maggie Dubris is the author of Skels (Soft Skull Press 2004), and Weep Not,
My Wanton (Black Sparrow Press 2002). She is also employed as a professiona=
l
hypnotist.=20


POETRY AND MUSIC =AD DREW GARDNER
FRIDAYS at 7 PM: 5 SESSIONS BEGIN APRIL 8TH
=B3A workshop investigating the relation of music and poetry, comparing the
languages of poetry and music and asking questions about how they can be
combined and how they might illuminate each other. What are the poetic
implications of improvisation? What are the musical implications of everyda=
y
speech? What does our experience of poetry imply about how we experience
sound and how does our listening affect our writing? We will read and liste=
n
to Harry Partch, Morton Feldman, Leo Smith, Pauline Oliveros, Thoreau,
Nathaniel Mackey and others, keep listening notebooks and collaborate with
guest musicians. No musical background required.=B2 Drew Gardner is the autho=
r

featuring poetry and structured improvisation.


A LAB: POST-CONCEPTUAL POETRIES =AD ROBERT FITTERMAN
SATURDAYS AT 12PM: 10 SESSIONS BEGIN FEBRUARY 26
=B3What happens when we ask ourselves not if the poem =B3could have been done
better, but whether it could have been done otherwise=B2 (Dworkin). In
post-conceptual writing, the expression is realized in the process. This
workshop will be a hands-on writing lab. Each week we will write poems
in-class generated by borrowed models from contemporary, 21st Century
poetry. Some of these experiments might include: sampling, bastardization,
procedural writing, mixed media, collaboration, etc.=B2 Robert Fitterman is
the author of 9 books of poetry including: Metropolis XXX (Edge Books),

I would doubt that software to administer the list includes the ability to
assemble the digest in the way Bruce requests.

Currently, I imagine the digest is simply arranged chronologically, and it's
auto-assembled by the list software.

List software has barely been updated in twenty years. Lists are wonderful
but the software is, by now, out of date.

The main problem is that there is no folder structure. If you want another
folder, you have another list. Whereas a single list should be capable of
supporting multiple folders so that, for instance, it could support the sort
of digest Bruce suggests. In other words, when posting, you post to one (or
possibly more?) folders that are simply a part of the list.

There are all sorts of social conflicts on lists that better list software
and email client software could *help* with. List software seems designed
for relatively small groups where 'one room' is all you need or want.

The sort of digest structure Bruce requests would, at the moment, probably
require a fleshly editor to sift through all the messages and sort them as
proposed.

There are occassionally such efforts by some lists, or related projects.

For instance, consider the email lists at http://rhizome.org . There's
Rhizome_Raw. That's the whole enchilada. Then there's Rhizome_Rare. That's a
separate list which is culled from Rhizome_Raw. Rhizome_Rare is the tasty
stuff. Then there's Rhizome_Digest, a third separate list. This is a
(manually edited and assembled) weekly or bi-monthly publication culled from
Raw that is organized by headings such as
Opportunities
Announcements
Works
Selected Thread
Interview

Not to be flip about Bruce Andrew's reasonable query, but I can't help but
thinking, that his desire is utopic & reflective of the malaise if not down
right utter collective sickness of many, if not most of us at the inability
to "digest" anything. Out here - as we find ourselves - in the Bush filled
darkness.
Ah, that all could be "restructured" so as to be able to "digest" again!

There's definitely a lump in the American throat.

And beyond that, who is now in charge of this List. I know Laura(sp?)
Emerson is the facilitator/Administrator. But back in the Garden, was not
Charles Bernstein the one that got this all going with a vision of what
would distinguish this list from other lists?  Now that he is no longer in
Buffalo, does there remain any operative vision and/or perceived need? Must
be something that makes people be quiet or quit the list in one disgust or
another - is that from an absence of vision or??  Frankly, it's seemed real
flat here for a long time - with an occasional flare of intrigue and
excitement.
What would be utopic as a and how would it operate? If that is the question.

I'm disappointed, though not really surprised, that anyone should feel th=
at
the posting of poems to a poetics list is inappropriate.  This is the sam=
e
attitude which leads more people than will admit it to skip over the actu=
al
poetry in the latest issue of any poetry journal they happen to pick up, =
so
they can get to the reviews and letters in the back, where the real actio=
n is.
 =


The list guidelines say that "the Poetics List exists to support and enco=
urage
divergent points of view on modern and contemporary poetry and poetics ..=
=2E" =

How the posting of poems for discussion can be anything but central to th=
e
support and encouragement of divergent points of view on modern and
contemporary poetry and poetics is beyond me.
True, the guidelines explicitly encourage the posting of announcements of=

interest to poets, saying that "Such announcements constitute a core func=
tion
of this list," but note that small but significant article:  announcement=
s are
one important function of the list, not its only function or its single m=
ost
important one.
 =

I think Pound says somewhere that worthwhile criticism of poetry should
consist mainly of quotations.  Well, those days are long gone.  =


Also as long as I'm complaining, why am I getting some messages under thi=
s
heading which look like ascii representations of binary files?  Or is thi=
s a
particularly innovative form of langpo?  (The list guidelines also say th=
at
all postings to the list should be in text-only format.)

Incidentally, one solution to managing heavy list traffic that works for =
many
people is to use Google's Gmail, which has a number of features which are=

especially useful for handling mailing list email.  It's free, but it's i=
n
beta and you need to be invited to get an account by a current account ho=
lder.
 I'm a current account holder there and have a limited number of invitati=
ons I
can give out.  If anyone on this list wants one, send me your email addre=
ss
and full name (Google will want it) and I'll send you an invitation if I'=
m in
a good mood.

How and Why To Write Poetry:  advice from those who know


1)  Today dear friends I will sing beautifully and make you happy.
                               -- Sappho

2)  The objects the imitator represents are actions.
                               -- Aristotle

3)  A big book is a big bore.
                               -- Callimachus

4)  Poetry is not a turning loose of emotion, but an escape from emotion;=
 it
    is not the expression of personality but an escape from personality.
                               -- T. S. Eliot

5)  Don't pay any attention to book prizes!  Never.  To none.  Not
    even the Nobel.  They are a snare.  -- Vincent Miller

6)  Literature is language charged with meaning.
                               -- Ezra  Pound

7)  A man can learn more about poetry by really knowing and
    examining a few of the best poems than by meandering about among
    a great many.  -- Ezra Pound

8)  Miles Davis (after a gig):  Man, why do you play so long?
    John Coltrane:  I had to play that long, to get it all in.

9)  True wit is Nature to advantage dress'd,
    What oft was thought, but ne'er so well express'd.
                               -- Pope

10)  Silence can be complex too,
                but you do not get far
                       with silence.
                               -- William Carlos Williams

11)  Experience has taught me, when I am shaving of a morning, to
     keep watch over my thoughts, because if a line of poetry strays
     into my memory, my skin bristles so that the razor ceases to
     act.
                               -- A. E. Housman

12)  For us there is only the trying.  The rest is not our business.
                               -- T. S. Eliot

13)  No data without experiment.
                               -- Sophocles, tr. Ezra Pound

14)  Say what you will in two
     Words and get through.
     Long, frilly
     Palaver is silly.
                               -- Marie-Francoise-Catherine de
                                   Beauveau, tr. Ezra Pound

15)  Interviewer:  Doesn't it embarrass you to see Bobby trying to
     learn how to play slide on stage?  Jerry Garcia:  Um, yeah.
     But the point is, it doesn't embarrass him.

16)  Take this, this Psalm, from me, burst from my hand in a day ...
                               -- Allen Ginsberg

17)  Poets are the unacknowledged legislators of the World.
                               -- Shelley

18)                           It is difficult
     to get the news from poems
                 yet men die miserably every day
                           for lack
     of what is found there.
                               -- William Carlos Williams

19)  For year upon year have I struggled with hammer and ink, O my
     tortured heart, with fire and gold to make you an embroidery, an
     orangetree hyancinth, a blossoming quince to console you ...
                               -- Nikos Gatsos

I sometimes skip through things in the digest that don't catch my eye. I'm sure
we all do. Like a few of you, I skipped right through Bruce A.'s seemingly oddly
formatted post. Anyway,  I've never before posted a poem to the list. I just
don't like that it is being discouraged as an option.

This one appeared in Michael Hathaway's Chiron Review, which after 20 years
(Yes, TWENTY YEARS) of quarterly publication will publish its last issue in Dec
2005. Subs are already closed. Here's to pissing on the el Camino.


The Woodsman and the Nixie

We saw a naked woman on a gravel bar.
We crouched in the fescue, watched a man pump
Her with legs pinned back; oh God, she was moaning.
He was a big, hairy, animal looking man,
Come out of the woods to tickle a nixie.

The nixie danced on his cock like a bitch firefly,
Painted him with glowing juices.
Her wings fanned the moschatel.
The snake doctors came out riding.
Ripsaw jumped in the riffle,
Taking down cottonmouth from low limbs.
A red hawk dove and gouged the woodsman's back.
A beaver smacked him on the ass with its tail.
The nixie bliss-rolled him into a patch of burnweed,
Bu they weren't stopping for anything.
"Holy shit" one of us whispered.

Then 2 boys who hadn't yet come into rut rode up.
They held their hands over their mouths, trying
To hold back snickering laughter.
We older boys gave mean looks,
Mean I'll-punch-you-in-the-mouth looks.
But they couldn't hold back; one of them yelled out.
The woodsman dismounted.
The nixie covered herself with a towel.
The woodsman pulled out a German Luger.
Shots smacked into the lightning-killed tree.
Mud daubers stormed out, stinging anything that moved.
The younger boys rode off, crying.
The woodsman didn't see us in the fescue.
He put down the Luger.
His stamen was dripping gloryseed.
They went back to it.
We watched as long as we could stand it.
Then we pissed on his el Camino and rode away.

Rumsfeld Fears Arrest In Germany:
"Christ. If They're Going After You For War Crimes In Germany, You Must Be A

By BADLEY GROOMED



They hang the man and flog the woman
That steal the goose from off the common,
But let the greater villain loose
That steals the common from the goose.

".....at a time when I am speaking to you about the paradox of desire -- in
the
sense that different goods obscure it -- you can hear outside the awful
language
of power.  There's no point in asking whether they are sincere or
hypocritical,
whether they want peace of whether they calculate the risks.  The dominating
impression as such a moment is that something that may pass for a prescribed
good; information addresses and captures impotent crowds to whom it is poured

forth like a liquor that leaves them dazed as they move toward the slaughter
house.
One might even ask if one would allow the cataclysm to occur without first
giving
free reign to this hubbub of voices...."

We come to the same issue which has been with the list all the years I have
been part of it, how open the list should be. What is a flame? Is being boring
or obnoxious the same as "flaming," which seems to be the self-evident taboo
act, the sin, of the internet world.

To me, the architecture of lists is one room. A long stage of current
posts/threads. 1000 people. This is OK for small groups. But it presents
issues that would benefit from architecture for larger spaces with 1000
people, particularly if the subject matter is increasingly heterogenous
(which tends to happen as the list grows). Also, it imposes limits on the
significance and growth of any topic under discussion. Of course it has its
charms, also.

I suspect that a lot of the problems with lists are matters of software
architecture. Yet we don't normally think about the software architecture
(or the consequences of physical architecture, for that matter).

I seem to recall McLuhan saying something to the effect that media shape the
environment.

I've often thought it would be a difficult but rewarding project to design
new list software. Server side and client side. Have the client side
developed as plugins to Outlook and Outlook Express and other popular email

Yes there is no fixing it sort of as there is no fixing poetry. As Charles
said in The Terminal Poet ( http://greatworks.org.uk/poems/ttp.html ), "We
know now poetry must bleed somewhere. . . and you can't stop the bleeding. .
."

But let's not suppose that there is anything sacred about current list
software architecture. Any more than the one-room building is the best
possible.

None of these people are any good - they all administer the capitalist -
Imperialist system - they all seem 'good or 'nice but it's their status and
their bank balance concerns them most - not the  US per se (we have the same
thing here in NZ) -with some  apparent "niceness"  their alleigances
are -however much even they know it - to their class  -not really to the US
(none of them are good nationalists in the healthy sense)-- she would have
gone to war - kept this terror thing going - the ruling classes need it.

The bourgeois "democratic" system is bankrupt it always has been  - it
allows enough liberty to generate a reservoir of workers of varying skill
levels up to say managers, engineers, executives, accountants or financial
people, and scientists  etc - who are workers - even top executives and
managers are  - in Marxist terms - workers -although allied to the ruling
class (who are the bourgeoisie in Marxist terms) - you will be thinking of
the "failure" of the Soviet Union - it was destroyed form within and from
without - they never even really reached a socialist system - before it was
subverted - it became similar to Nazi Germany - it was revisionist but that
doesn't mean that ultimately capitalism will not be transformed if not
destroyed - - the aim needs to be a working class state  - or a people's
state - in the real sense - whether that is achievable is moot - but as I
say - those such as the Clintons - despite they smile a lot, are just there
to keep the system working - they are all very rich -often obscenely rich  -
yes people - no real opposition to the industrial - military complex -no
change since 1945 -no real change.

None of them care about people their desires are power and fame and status
and to aid capitalism - they hate the working people of the world.

These are my views

CALL FOR PROPOSALS for INCUBATION3
The 3rd trAce International Symposium on Writing and the Internet
12-14 July 2004 at The Nottingham Trent University, England
http://trace.ntu.ac.uk/incubation/

We are pleased to invite proposals for Incubation3, the leading =
international event for writers and artists working online.

Proposals should be submitted via an online form which will be available =
on the website from Friday 10th October 2003: =
http://trace.ntu.ac.uk/incubation/

Deadline for Proposals 1st December 2003
Selections announced by 31st January 2004

Keynote Speaker: Mark Amerika
Plus: Paul Brown, Alan Sondheim, Tim Wright
Also featuring: Talan Memmott, Kate Pullinger, Stefan Schemat

Conference Committee
Randy Adams : Paul Brown : Catherine Byron : Jane Dorner : Marjorie =
Luesebrink : Simon Mills : Alan Sondheim : Sue Thomas : Lawrence Upton : =
Helen Whitehead

BURSARIES
New at Incubation3 - 30 bursaries are available for delegates and =
presenters
Generously funded by Arts Council England: East Midlands: =
http://www.artscouncil.org.uk/aboutus/myregion_eastmidlands.html

Applications should be submitted via an online form which will be =
available on the website from Friday 10th October 2003: =
http://trace.ntu.ac.uk/incubation/

Previous Incubations
Incubation 2000: =
http://trace.ntu.ac.uk/incubation/archive/2000/index.htm
Incubation 2002: http://trace.ntu.ac.uk/incubation/index2002.cfm

Why a Symposium?
Those familiar with Incubation will notice that we are now a Symposium =
rather than a Conference. This heralds a subtle shift, not in identity, =
but in the way we promote the event. Incubation has always been very =
practice-based and in 2004 it will be even more so. Thanks to Arts =
Council England (http://www.artscouncil.org.uk/) we are offering a total =
of 30 bursaries to enable those who cannot obtain funding elsewhere to =
attend the full residential conference at no charge. We expect this =
injection of financial support to provide a greater balance of academia =
and professional writers and artists.

Themes
The purpose of Incubation has always been to provide ideas, stimulus and =
motivation; information and debate for the international new media =
writing community. We aim to encourage interdisciplinary creativity and =
cross-fertilisation, and we are especially interested in introducing the =
form to writers for whom it is a new idea as well as helping =
practitioners to share and expand their work.
The themes for 2004 are:
A. Developing a new form: contemporary textual works in new media and =
performance
B. The practice of making: creative and professional practice; online =
teaching and learning.
C. Critique and criteria: criticism, reviewing, defining, and archiving =
of new media writing.

TYPES OF PROPOSALS SOUGHT
Proposals will not be considered unless they are submitted via the =
online form. When completing the form please indicate which of the above =
themes (A, B or C) your proposal relates to.

Guidelines
In order to make the field as open as possible we have kept guidelines =
to a minimum but as a rough guide, we encourage lively debate and =
provocative thinking about:
*recent work by both new and established writers and artists. You may =
simply show/perform the work, or accompany it with a practice-based =
commentary or formal critique
*explorations of the ways in which new media works are made, discussed, =
reviewed, categorised and archived
*explorations of online teaching and learning in a creative context
*surprise us!

1. Presentations - 20 minutes
We invite proposals for 20 minute presentations which we will group =
together in panels of three with an added 30 minutes for questions. You =
are also welcome to organise and propose your own panel.

2. Performances
A number of 20 minute presentation periods may be used for short =
performances / presentations of work. In addition a number of longer =
evening sessions may be available. We particularly welcome performances =
which extend limits and cross boundaries. Proposals should describe the =
performance and specify technical support required, set-up times, =
audience profiles, length of performance, etc.

3. Workshops - 1 hour
There will be space for a limited number of hands-on workshops. We are =
interested in workshops with a specific technical or artistic focus. =
Please indicate whether you require a PC resource room or a regular =
classroom.

4. Position Papers/Posters - 10-15 minutes
There will be a limited number of 1 hour sessions beginning with the =
presentation of a short position paper which will have been put online =
before the conference and which will act as a stimulus for discussion. =
These sessions will be chaired and a scribe will be provided. We invite =
contentious papers with scope for energetic debate. The online =
=91paper=92 may be in text or any new media format which will be =
viewable at the discussion and should be submitted by 1st June 2004.

Details of the technology available in our presentation rooms will be =
available on the website from 10th October 2003: =
http://trace.ntu.ac.uk/incubation/

ADDITIONAL COLLABORATIVE PROJECT FOR NEW MEDIA / VIDEO / SOUND ARTISTS
We hope to obtain funding for Online/Offline, a collaborative project =
connecting three new media writers with three video artists and a sound =
artist to work together online to create an original piece to be =
premiered at Incubation. Application time for this is likely to be short =
- current planning is to invite applications from new media writers =
during the month of December only. The video artists and sound artist =
will be based in the East Midlands and will be separately appointed. =

'Beat' Generation Catalyst Lucien Carr Dies

Fri Jan 28, 7:09 PM ET

By Randall Mikkelsen

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Lucien Carr, a muse and catalyst of the "beat
generation" who brought Jack Kerouac together with other writers to
spark a counterculture revolution, died on Friday in Washington.



He was 79.

Carr, a retired senior editor at the United Press International news
wire service, died at George Washington University Hospital of
complications from cancer treatment, said his longtime companion
Kathleen Silvassy.

Carr was a student at Columbia University in New York in 1944 when he
introduced Kerouac, Allen Ginsberg and William Burroughs, who formed
the literary nucleus of the countercultural "beatnik" movement of the
1950s.

"The beat scene was a circle of friends who just happened to have
three of the most important writers of in the last 50 years in
America, plus some extraordinary minds, including Lucien," said Dennis
McNally, author of the Kerouac biography "Desolate Angel: Jack
Kerouac, the Beat Generation and America."

By some accounts, including his own, Carr played a role in Kerouac's
legendary speedwriting of the breakthrough novel "On the Road," by
supplying a Teletype roll for the manuscript. "I didn't steal it," he
told a co-worker at UPI. "I just stuck it under my arm and brought it
home."

But McNally said he inspected the manuscript recently and found it to
consist of individual sheets of paper taped together. It was possible
Carr supplied the roll for another Kerouac novel, "Dharma Bums," he
said.

"Lucien's impact on Kerouac's thinking and writing was considerably
more important than whether or not he supplied the roll," McNally
said. He said Carr helped instill a notion of "first thought, best
thought," in which the beat writers strived to be closer to the roots
of inspiration and write spontaneously.

Carr served two years on a manslaughter conviction for stabbing dead
an older man, David Kammerer, who had a romantic crush on Carr, and
throwing his body into the Hudson River in 1944.

The conviction cast a pall over the emerging beats who were striving
for authenticity in the gritty urban streets of America, and probably
kept Carr from playing a more public role for the rest of his life,
McNally said.

The killing and Carr's friendship with Burroughs were portrayed in the
2000 movie "Beat." Carr was also portrayed as Kenneth Wood in
Kerouac's novel "The Town and the City."

Carr's 47-year UPI career began after his prison term and spanned most
of the second half of the 20th century. "Lou Carr was a great editor:
calm and unflappable as he handled bulletins and any political crisis
that came in Washington," said former UPI White House correspondent
Helen Thomas. "Young reporters were in awe of him -- some of the
veterans as well."

Carr is also survived by three sons, Simon, Ethan, Caleb - a writer
whose works include the murder mystery "The Alienist," and five
grandchildren. (Additional reporting by Lori Santos)

I've got plenty (gmail invitations) to hand out myself, never did, I
would like to know what it feels like, certainly, if I am in a _good_
mood.

The idea of a minimum of order in the dis/order would be exceptional,
especially if like me you open up your gmail account every 2 or 3 days
to find loads of mails there waiting to be opened & possibly read

but as Joris says, together with others, dis/order contains order thus
why eliminate it?

in an especially good mood,
Anny

Subject:      CFP for MLA'05: Source Texts in Contemporary Experimental Poetry
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII

Pastiches and Palimtexts: The Use of Source Texts in Contemporary
Experimental Poetry

This special session proposed for the 2005 MLA Convention will investigate
the use of source texts by contemporary experimental poets in the
composition process. I am using as a springboard Michael Davidson's term
"palimtext," by which he emphasizes "the intertextual - and
inter-discursive - quality of postmodern writing as well as its
materiality."

Examples - to name only a handful of myriad possibilities of such
intertextuality - include "erasures" of source texts (as in Igor
Satanovsky's "Shakespeare's sonnets revis[it]ed); homolinguistic
translations (such as Robert Kelly's _Unquell the Dawn Now_ and Lisa
Cooper's _& Calling It Home_); collaged texts using popular media (as in
Karen Mac Cormack and Alan Halsey's _Fit to Print_, Hannah Weiner's
_Weeks_, and Kenneth Goldsmith's _Day_); and the use of historic texts as
sources (as in Susan Howe's _Eikon Basilika_ and many of Robin Blaser's
poems).

In addition, journals of contemporary poetry regularly highlight
intertextual work. For example, _POM2_ asks submitters to borrow from or
somehow transform poems published in previous issues. And _Chain_ recently
published an issue surrounding the theme of borrowed texts.

The focus in this session will be the theorizing of such intertextuality:
the social and philosophical implications of avant-garde intertextuality
for communal language and the blurring of authorial boundaries.

One example of such exploration would be the dialogical relationship
between source text(s) and resulting text - in other words, the process by
which a poet mediates the cultural and historical legacy of a source text
and the position(s) of the resulting poem (ironic, complicit, critical) in
relation to the source. As Jen Bevin has it in her introduction to her book
of "erasures" of Shakespeare sonnets: "When we write poems, the history of
poetry is with us, pre-inscribed in the white of the page." What effect
does the cultural baggage of the source text have on the resulting work?

David & Jon--

This is a poetics list
not a poetry list

so while poetry is not banned
like most of society

there is little need for it.
Join a poetry list if you need poetry.

Bruce, Alan has left the list if that alleviates
your quandry, maybe noodle

& jeff will finally
give it up also.

Be well

Alan may have left - but his reason may have been also his sensitivity to
the issue of Zionism etc I can understand that .. maybe he is wrong to leave
or is leaving for what I might say are the wrong reasons but if he feels
about it then that is the best thing for him to do maybe for now...

I always found /still find what he was/is doing interesting
- couldn't always read everything -

It sounds as if David Baratier wants these guys and others (everyone?)  to
stop contributing poetry! Or does he? His missive is ambiguous... How can
you have poetics without poetry - Bruce Andrews is a talented poet - I don't
know what he is doing now - but I liked e.g. "Give 'Em Enough Rope"  ... his
ideas of restructuring - if related or limited to the digest form are ok -
but perhaps if he was implying poetry should be canned on the list - but it
didn't seem he was - then that is not good -  as well as Alan and Jeff there
were some others and myself who contributed poetry - and some of the Vispos
send links - Jon hasn't been answered - his point and mine was that poetics
includes the practice of writing poetry - as well as debating and so on -
poetry and criticism in postmodern terms cannot necessarily be separated.

Where do you stand on this David (where do others  stand also?) - do you
want poetry on here or not - or do you want announcements only or no
politics (despite that  the political nature of poetry was Bernstein's and
Andrew's and Silliman's plank for years - they said things like: "...Poetry
then can refuse to be in the service of capitalism by being
"untranslatable"...In a commodity society..poetry can refuse an
exchange-value to make itself available as use-value,...".  (Bruce Andrew in
the big section "Writing and Politics" in the Language book.)

And if say only "poetics"  - is Bernstein wrong in saying (or
implying/inferring) that philosophy in certain instances can or may be a
kind of poetry? Thus sometimes Sartre's "Being and Nothingness", with its
polysemy etc is closer or is in the or a mode of being to being a kind of
poem, while Sartre's works such as "Nausea" is closer to being
"philosophy"[which is good for me as it find it easier to read and its one
of my favourite books!!] - and also sometimes the essential difference
(between say philosophy and poetry or poetics and poetry) is the mode or the
"manner of speaking" or the "method of discourse" and certain repeated
signifiers or signals in philosophic talk so to speak - as in Bernstein's
essay  'Writing and Method' in "In The American Tree" .

"Commonsense" tells us that, mostly, poetry is not poetics - the language
maybe has to be appropriate - trouble is what is appropriate -I think we
decide some of such things very quickly as we are social animals or we think
we are sure certain ways of speaking/writing or signaling are or are not
appropriate. But at the edge between poetry/poetics -where is that dividing
point? We poets are, presumably, more or less "strange" members of the
social group so maybe we can discard or be suspicious of "commonsense"..?

What then is poetics? Jon's comments/question haven't really been answered
except by enigmatic cryptic cyber grunts and or laconical snipes ("I thought
we had banned poetry") - someone's "appreciation" of his translation from
the Greek of a poem by Callimachus?

If poetry can also be seen as a mode of poetry or poetry a kind of
 poetics -see Bernstein's book: "A Poetics " -a lot of which is in the form
of a poem as your letter was/is.. (in a kind of "traditional " couplet
form)...  and if we cant - or have trouble deciding what is a "better"
poem - then the more poems (of various styles and forms) on here the
better...as we will all be engaging in or be part of what poetics is - if
not poetics in totum.

Or should we exclude poetry on here totally?And even links to poetry or
Vispo, as such things are extraneous and possibly to disturbing to some
here - and announcements often refer to poetry (indirectly) - perhaps they
should be banned also - unless in a special code form so as we cant read or
translate the announcements...after all poets are all mad so we should maybe
never turn up to things on the right day /time/place etc etc - but that is
probably being too silly...

I always suspected some people don't need poetry for their poetics!

I put that idea along with hot-desking and destroying towns to free them. Or
perhaps a coach trip to see the country through glass.

Truly an idea for our times

I am sorry to hear that Alan has left the list. His posts have been an
integral part of it, something connecting me to its past, regardless of whether I
read everything he posted or not.

When I first joined the list, the messages were full of posts by people about
books they read, a significant number of which I personally had not heard of
or its substance I disagreeed with. Nevertheless, the posts had an
intellectual substance to which one could react, positively or negatively or ironically.
Chains of discussions, reflecting the ethos of the time, developed.

Nobody seems to read any books or bring them to the posts any more. Rather,
discussions, rartely when they do occur, are restatements of already held
beliefs, rarely going anywhere. Announcements of upcoming events and postings of
poems were always part of the list, at least, ever since I joined it. They
become so prominent because the other part is (discusiion of books people are
reading at the moment) is missing.

I do not quite know why this is so. Perhaps other lists replaced this
function, I am not an expert on them. Or maybe blogs have overtaken this function,
though I personally doubt it. A blog is generated by one person. Whether an
authentic discussion develops around his/her inputs (rather than a chorus) depends
whether he/she chooses to react to outsiders' comments. Or, sometimes, I am
stunned how in   blogs entries are made day after day with 0 response to them.
Then the blog becomes a kind of quisi diary, an ambivalent gesture to the
public. For instance, when I read Myread's powerful entries in her blog, directly,
without fuss delienating a life, I wonder how she keeps going writing it, in
contention to solitude. Hers seems to be a new genre between letter and diary.

Well, these are some thoughts.

This place has as many begging questions as San Francisco has begging
homeless.  Now comes one saying that poems shouldn't be posted to a poeti=
cs
list because a poetics list isn't an appropriate place for posting poems.=
 =

This was in reply to my argument that poems ought to be posted to a poeti=
cs
list because they form the necessary raw material for discussions of poet=
ics. =

My reason may be valid or invalid, but at least I gave one.

=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D

Incidentally it didn't seem to register on anyone that the translation of=

Callimachus I posted is both a poem and in the strictest sense a statemen=
t of
a poetics.  In fact, it's one of the most famous statements of a poetics =
in
classical antiquity.  Do I have to explain everything?

=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D =


The tradition of the horrific effects of Aesychlus's stagecraft is found =
in a
scholiast somewhere -- I've read it but I forget now where -- so it's not=
 a
contemporary report and may well be legendary:  ancient commentators were=

often rather uncritical.  Still, there's that Italian saying about how if=
 it
ain't true it shoulda been.

=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D

We shouldn't be too harsh on people who ask if the ancient poets were rea=
lly
all they're supposed to be.  If all you have to go on for the ancient
tragedians are English translations, it's very hard to see what the fuss =
is
about, though with a little study and assistance you can appreciate the
stagecraft, if not the poetry.  Seeing productions of the plays by a
knowledgeable director can be immensely useful.  In the summer of 2002 I =
saw
Euripides' Bacchae performed at Epidaurus by the Royal National Theatre o=
f
Great Britain under the direction of Peter Hall.  The English translation=
 was,
I thought, only adequate, but watching the performance I saw how it conve=
yed
the nature of the original in ways that you could never get from reading =
it in
translation, and I even gained new insights into the play myself, ones wh=
ich I
hadn't gotten from reading it in the original text.

=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D

As for the nature of the Greek dramatists' verse, all I can suggest if yo=
u're
not going to learn Greek is to look at a lot of fifth century b.c. Attic =
art
-- the Parthenon sculptures and vase paintings -- and try to imagine a po=
etry
that sounds like those things look.

=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D

Michael Hoerman's "The Woodsman and the Nixie" for me incarnates the esse=
nce
of American boyhood.  Or at least the way it used to be.  Now days kids s=
ee it
all on the internet.

=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D

Mary Jo Malo's "a sweet song when you need it most" is the kind of poem I=
 find
frustrating because it's good.  It's good because it has an assured tone =
and
subtle verbal effects and suggests an intriguing story.  The problem is t=
he
"suggests:"  it seems like this poem is one which requires an understandi=
ng of
the event (fictional or not) which it's based on for us to understand the=

import of its ostensible statement, but there's an unaccountable coyness =
about
telling us what that story is.  The poem would have been more understanda=
ble
if I could have understood it.

=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D

Please note that the previous paragraph is a discussion of poetics based =
on a
poem.

Quote of the day:  =


          Style and its opposite can alternate, but form must =

jon,

pay no attention to baratier's email. i've known him for years, personally
and professionally, and as many poetics listers can tell you he's one to
have some fun with people on the list.

i'm also wondering why you needed to begin your email by referencing the
homeless in san francisco.

david

Dear all: although I like Bruce's suggestions for restructuring the
digest form of the list, unfortunately Jim Andrews is right--the
listserv software does not currently allow us to change the way digest
works.  But there are a couple of solutions to unwieldiness--the first
of which would be for posters to accompany subject lines with,
say, "[announcement]" or "[poem]" (any more categories than these
would, I think, over-determine the list).  The problem with this,
though, is that I/we can only encourage posters to do so--there's
really no way to enforce it except by including a note in the welcome
message that states the merits of indicating whether a post is an
announcement or a poem.

The other solution, the best solution, is for subscribers to choose a
different form of receiving the list.  Using index html rather than
regular digest just gives subscribers a list of the subject-headings
of messages which are links that can then be clicked on--in fact
you'll find that reading the list online is much more wieldy than
reading it via email.  Directions for changing your subscription
options are outlined in the welcome message which I'll send out again
in a few moments.

About posting poems in general: it's definitely regrettable that Alan
has unsubscribed from the list--especially since his work frequently
provoked discussion.  What I'd like to see happen more often is
posters adhere to the aim of the list which is to promote the
discussion of poetics and/or the exchange of announcements;  if a
subscriber's posting of their poems is not contributing to these list
aims then they should cease posting them.

As always, please do feel free to get in touch with me if you have any
thoughts, questions, comments etc.!

best,
Lori Emerson

I would love to see [announcement] and [poem] headings, which could be
stripped if the poem (or announcement) resulted in a discussion.

Folks,

I'm thinking about the origins of so-called "Found" Poetry in
order to consider recent googling procedures like "Flarf";
clearly the modernists were conceptualizing "found" objects
(collagists, Duchamps' fountain, etc.), and the mod poets
were using "found" materials.

Has any good criticism or theory been written on the poetics
and problematics of "found" art/lit?

And how does Bern Porter figure into these things?  He seems
to have collected a few volumes on the subject.

On or offlist as appropriate.  Thanks in advance for your
insights,

This Welcome Message updated 11 January 2005.

--------------------------------------------

Above the world-weary horizons
New obstacles for exchange arise
Or unfold,
O ye postmasters!

1. About the Poetics List

With the preceeding epigraph, the Poetics Listserv was founded by
Charles Bernstein in late 1993. Now in its third incarnation, the list
carries about 1000 subscribers worldwide, though all of these
subscribers do not necessarily receive messages at any given time. A
good number of other people read the Poetics List via our web archives
(see web-address above).

Our aim is to support, inform, and extend those directions in poetry
that are committed to innovations, renovations, and investigations of
form and/or/as content, to the questioning of received forms and
styles, and to the creation of the otherwise unimagined, untried,
unexpected, improbable, and impossible.  We recognize that other lists
may sponsor other possibilities for exchange in this still-new medium.
We request that those participating in this forum keep in mind the
specialized and focused nature of this project, and respect our
decision to operate a moderated list.  That is, the Poetics List
exists to support and encourage divergent points of view on modern and
contemporary poetry and poetics, and we are committed to do what is
necessary to preserve this space for such dialog.

Due to the high number of subscribers, we no longer maintain the open
format with which the list began (at under 100 subscribers). The
specific form of moderation that we employ is a relatively fluid one:
in most cases, messages are reviewed after having been posted to the
list, and difficulties resolved on that basis; however, the list
moderators may shift with impunity between this and a pre-review mode
which calls for all messages to be read and approved before being
forwarded to the list. We prefer to avoid this option as it hampers
the spontaneity of discussion that we hope to promote. In addition to
these options, the list moderators may place subscribers who find
themselves unable to abide by the rules of the list under individual
review, in which case only their messages would be received for
moderators' approval before being forwarded to the list; the list
moderators may also ask subscribers to leave the list if they are not
productively contributing to the discussion. We remain committed to
this editorial function as a defining element of the Poetics List.

Please also note that this is a private list and information about
this list should not be posted to other lists or directories of lists.
The idea is to keep the list membership to those with specific rather
than general interests, and also to keep the scale of the list
relatively small and the volume manageable. The current limits of the
list are 50 messages per day, and two messages per subscriber per day.


Further information on posting to the list for subscribers, publishers
and series-coordinators, see sections 5 and 6.

In addition to being archived at through the EPC
(http://epc.buffalo.edu) and at
http://listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu/archives/poetics.html, some posts to
Poetics (especially reviews, obituary notices, announcements, etc.)
may also become part of specific EPC subject areas. Brief reviews of
poetry events and publications are always welcome; we also encourage
posts that announce events important to our subscribers. See section 5
for details.

---------------------

2. Subscriptions

Subscriptions to the Poetics List are free of charge, but formal
registration is required. We ask that when you subscribe you provide
your full name, street address, email address, and telephone number.
All posts to the list should provide your full real name, as
registered. If there is any discrepancy between your full name as it
appears in the "from" line of the message header, please sign your
post at the bottom.  PLEASE NOTE: All subscription-related information
and correspondence remains absolutely confidential.

To subscribe to the Poetics List, please contact the moderators at the
lists' administrative address <poetics@acsu.buffalo.edu>. Your message
should include all of the required information. All other questions
about subscriptions, whether about an individual subscription or
subscription policy, should be addressed to this same administrative
address.

PLEASE NOTE: IT MAY TAKE SEVERAL WEEKS TO PROCESS SUBSCRIPTION
REQUESTS.

The most frequent problem with subscriptions is bounced messages. If
your system is often down or if you have a low disk quota, Poetics
messages may get bounced. Please try avoid having messages from the
list returned to us. If the problem is low disk quota, you may wish to
request an increased quota from your system administrator.  You might
also consider obtaining a commercial account. In general, if a good
number of Poetics messages are bounced from your account, your
subscription to Poetics will be temporarily suspended. If this
happens, you may re-subscribe to the list by contacting the moderators
at<poetics@acsu.buffalo.edu>.

-------------------------------

3. Subscription Options

We encourage you to alter your subscription options via the link on
the right side of the screen at
http://listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu/archives/poetics.html.  If you would
prefer not to use the web-interface, you may also email
<listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu> the following commands:

*to receive posts in the default option (you will receive individual
postings immediately), send <listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu> this one-
line message with no "subject": set poetics nodigest

* to receive the list in digest form (you will receive the day's
individual posts in one email sent just after midnight EST), send
<listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu> this one-line message with
no "subject": set poetics digest

* to receive the list in index form (you will receive a list, without
the text of the posts, of the subjects discussed each day along with
the author's name and address and the number of lines it comprises;
you can also choose to have the index sent to you in either plain text
or in HTML format with hyperlinks), send
<listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu> this one-line message with
no "subject": set poetics nohtml index  --or--  set poetics html index

*to temporarily turn off Poetics mail send
<listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu> this one-line message with
no "subject": set poetics nomail

*to reactivate Poetics mail send <listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu> this
one-line message with no "subject": set poetics mail

PLEASE NOTE: do not leave your Poetics subscription "active" if you
are going to be away for any extended period of time.  Your account
may become flooded and you may lose not only Poetics messages but
other important mail.

-------------------------

4.  To Unsubscribe

To unsubscribe (or change any of your subscription options) go to the
right-hand side of the screen at
http://listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu/archives/poetics.html  You may also
may unsubscribe by sending a one-line email to
<listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu> with no "subject": unsub poetics

If you are having difficulty unsubscribing, please note: sometimes
your e-mail address may be changed slightly by your system
administrator. If this happens you will not be able to send messages
to Poetics or to unsubscribe, although you will continue to receive
mail from the Poetics List. To avoid this problem, unsub using your
old address, then return to your new address and contact the
moderators at <poetics@acsu.buffalo.edu> to resubscribe. If you find
that it is not possible to unsub using your old address, please
contact the moderators at <poetics@acsu.buffalo.edu> for assistance.

----------------------------

5.  Posting to the List

The Poetics List is a moderated list. All messages are reviewed by the
moderators in keeping with the goals of the list as articulated in
this Welcome Message (see section 1).

Please note that while this list is primarily concerned with
discussions of poetry and poetics, messages relating to politics and
political activism, film, art, media, and so forth are also welcome.
Feel free to query the list moderators if you are uncertain as to
whether a message is appropriate. All correspondence with the
moderators regarding submissions to the list remains confidential and
should be directed to us at <poetics@acsu.buffalo.edu>.

We strongly encourage subscribers to post information on publications
and reading series that they have coordinated, edited, published, or
in which they appear. Such announcements constitute a core function of
this list. Brief reviews of poetry events and publications are always
welcome.

To post to the Poetics List, send your messages directly
to the list address: <poetics@listserv.buffalo.edu>

Please do not send messages intended for posting to the list to our
administrative address <poetics@acsu.buffalo.edu>

For further information on posting to the list, see section 6 below.

----------------

6. Cautions

"Flame" messages will not be tolerated on the Poetics List. We
define 'flaming' as any post that resembles a personal attack or
personal insult to anyone--subscriber or not. This of course includes
ad hominem arguments in which the person rather than their work is
attacked; in other words while critique of a person's work is welcome
(critical inquiry is one of the main functions of the list), this
critique cannot extend to a critique or criticism of the person.

I think most would agree that the listserv serves as a productive
communal space for discussion and announcements; as such, subscribers
who do not follow listserv policy on flaming will first receive a
warning from the listserv moderator and should they fail to follow
policy again they will immediately be placed on review.

For reasons of basic security, we do not allow pseudononymous
subscriptions.  We also discourage the sending of HTML-formatted
messages to the list. All messages intended for the Poetics List
should be sent in Text-Only format.

Please also do not send attachments or include extremely long
documents (1,000+ words) in a post.  Messages containing attachments
will be presumed to be worm- or virus-carrying and will not be
forwarded to the list.

Please do not publish list postings without the express permission of
the author. Posting on the list is a form of publication. Copyright
for all material posted on Poetics remains with the author; material
from this list and its archive may not be reproduced without the
author's permission, beyond the standard rights accorded by "fair use"
of published materials.

As an outside maximum, we will accept no more than 2 messages per day
from any one subscriber. Also, given that our goal is a manageable
list (manageable both for moderators and subscribers), the list
accepts 50 or fewer messages per day.

Like all systems, the listserv will sometimes be down: if you feel
your message has been delayed or lost, *please wait at least one day
to see if it shows up*, then check the archive to be sure the message
is not posted there; if you still feel there is a problem, you may
wish to contact the moderators at <poetics@acsu.buffalo.edu>.

My poem was a poetic reply to steve's post:

steve dalchinsky bellevue

"Mary Jo Malo's "a sweet song when you need it most" is the kind of poem I
find
frustrating because it's good.  It's good because it has an assured  tone and
subtle verbal effects and suggests an intriguing story.  The  problem is the
"suggests:"  it seems like this poem is one which  requires an understanding
of
the event (fictional or not) which it's based on  for us to understand the
import of its ostensible statement, but there's an unaccountable coyness
about
telling us what that story is."

Dear all, just one more note: Some subscribers may not be aware that
posts to the list are immediately available on the web archive for the
list, and can be viewed by author, date, or subject. For some, reading
the list on the web will be the easiest way to selective reading the
posts. Remember though that you must be subscribed in order to post
message to the list; anyone can read the archive.

I'm returning after cooling down. I do think that some sort of sifting re:
the digest would be useful; it would also be useful to place creative work
of whatever sort in the Pale, i.e. for those who want it, a separate Pail
or category. That way poetics + announcements =3D Poetics. But one would
have to configure one's own mailbox for that. I recommend gmail for both
culture and debris, however constituted.

"If Auschwitz hadn't happened, if September were another,
"I'd say that you were mine, I'd say we'd stay together,
"In any darkness, weather; if Beirut were filled with flowers,
"Jerusalem a town, I'd say we'd live forever, I'd say we'd be together;
"If Afghanistan were peaceful, if America were other,
"I'd say we're made for one another, I'd say eternity;
"If Rwanda never happened, Sudan were prosperous,
"I'd say we'd love forever, I'd say a god was there, so glorious in us;
"If Israel were milk, and Palestine of honey, and China were so sweet,
"We'd lie together there, I'd say you were the rose,
"All among the fairest; if one voice hadn't happened,
"Another took its place, I'd say your name forever,
"And we would live forever; if September were another,
"A day of bright fall weather, if Auschwitz hadn't happened,
"In any darkness, weather, I'd say that we were peaceful,
"I'd say eternity, if animals still roamed free, if there were animals,
"I'd say a god was there, so glorious in us, all among the fairest;
"If one voice hadn't happened, another took its place."

the winds were terrible
people couldn't see 'im
quite a distance, they said, later

the storms, too, the weather was furious

I decided last year that I should read Pound's "Cantos" right thru ( I also
started on the complete poems of Emily Dickinson etc) now I have Cookson's
"translations" of much of the languages etc that Pound puts in and some
other books etc (I know in the text of The Cantos it is possible to infer
the meaning in many cases and also Pound repeats various things -e.g. a
Latin or French phrase is frequently followed by its equivalent in English)
but this lead me into reading various of the classics -and I finished Ovid's
"Metamorphoses" (marvelous !!)also re-read Dante's "Divine Comedy" etc I
don't intend to get bogged down reading Jefferson but knowing myself - I
know the Greek for that from childhood -it is 'gnothi seuton' - and I learnt
the Greek alphabet recently so I could at least get some idea of the sound
of the Greek - and was thinking of studying classics and going back to do
Latin/Greek etc - of course where do you stop? (I also want to study more NZ
History and Maoritanga) but that is why (because I was working through "The
Cantos" ) I got to read the Greek plays - I had read Oedipus Rex etc
before -all in translation -  I take your point that its a good idea to
study the art etc of the time - ad I'll try to do that - we have some good
stuff in the Auckland Museum (although museums overwhelm me sometimes) and I
have some good books  - I think the ancient Greek plays are great plays but
my points re the ancient Greek tragedians v Shakespeare - which Kozantzakis
(sorry if I forget or misspelt his name) I think misconstrued - as it was
put a bit simplistically I must concede - were:

If one really knows Greek (ideally you are a Greek from ancient times, flown
here by  via Dr Who - just from a performance- you have just seen the Baccae
by Euripides - you go to see King Lear - your English is also (somehow!)
perfect - you can "think" in both languages ....so who wins the prize - Bill
'Milk Shake' ?

Failing that - you know both languages pretty well - are the Greek
playwrights as great as Shakespeare - I have always felt that no one could
surpass the incredible inventiveness - the greatness of Shakespeare - ever

But the question/statement  "this is a joke, surely" was ambiguous - did
Monsieur K mean which or all of the following:

1 The question was clumsily put and sounded naive adolescent puerile and or
stupid and thus must have been a joke. (Risible as stated.)

2 W Shakespeare is clearly the greatest playwright ever -anyone who contends
else is completely deluded.

2A  The Greek playwrights were the above (plural).

3 It was a joke because if one doesn't know Greek its clearly impossible to
know.

4. It had to be a joke because everyone knows that Euripides etc are way
greater that W Shakespeare as in 2A

5 Its a joke because it implies a Eurocentric, tired modernist - or Harold
Bloomsian approach - a fussy old fashioned comparative approach -

5A  As above - it is a question croaking out of the tired old
"Pre-deconstructive Era" barrel

6 It  was a joke because my "kabala"  and supposedly "anti jazz"
contributions were indeed satirical - as they were - jokes with a dash of
truth and probably a bit mistimed - in fact I don't know anything about the
kabala and didn't realise it was even connected to Judaism - just thought it
was something - something like the Masons... of course I knew that Coolidge
and all those guys were heavily into jazz so I was being very impish
there...

7 It is or was joke because Richard Taylor is always making stupid jokes
which only he finds funny.

8. Other

This place has as many begging questions as San Francisco has begging
homeless.  Now comes one saying that poems shouldn't be posted to a poetics
list because a poetics list isn't an appropriate place for posting poems.
This was in reply to my argument that poems ought to be posted to a poetics
list because they form the necessary raw material for discussions of
poetics.
My reason may be valid or invalid, but at least I gave one.

=====

Incidentally it didn't seem to register on anyone that the translation of
Callimachus I posted is both a poem and in the strictest sense a statement
of
a poetics.  In fact, it's one of the most famous statements of a poetics in
classical antiquity.  Do I have to explain everything?

=====

The tradition of the horrific effects of Aesychlus's stagecraft is found in
a
scholiast somewhere -- I've read it but I forget now where -- so it's not a
contemporary report and may well be legendary:  ancient commentators were
often rather uncritical.  Still, there's that Italian saying about how if it
ain't true it shoulda been.

=====

We shouldn't be too harsh on people who ask if the ancient poets were really
all they're supposed to be.  If all you have to go on for the ancient
tragedians are English translations, it's very hard to see what the fuss is
about, though with a little study and assistance you can appreciate the
stagecraft, if not the poetry.  Seeing productions of the plays by a
knowledgeable director can be immensely useful.  In the summer of 2002 I saw
Euripides' Bacchae performed at Epidaurus by the Royal National Theatre of
Great Britain under the direction of Peter Hall.  The English translation
was,
I thought, only adequate, but watching the performance I saw how it conveyed
the nature of the original in ways that you could never get from reading it
in
translation, and I even gained new insights into the play myself, ones which
I
hadn't gotten from reading it in the original text.

=====

As for the nature of the Greek dramatists' verse, all I can suggest if
you're
not going to learn Greek is to look at a lot of fifth century b.c. Attic art
-- the Parthenon sculptures and vase paintings -- and try to imagine a
poetry
that sounds like those things look.

=====

Michael Hoerman's "The Woodsman and the Nixie" for me incarnates the essence
of American boyhood.  Or at least the way it used to be.  Now days kids see
it
all on the internet.

=====

Mary Jo Malo's "a sweet song when you need it most" is the kind of poem I
find
frustrating because it's good.  It's good because it has an assured tone and
subtle verbal effects and suggests an intriguing story.  The problem is the
"suggests:"  it seems like this poem is one which requires an understanding
of
the event (fictional or not) which it's based on for us to understand the
import of its ostensible statement, but there's an unaccountable coyness
about
telling us what that story is.  The poem would have been more understandable
if I could have understood it.

=====

Please note that the previous paragraph is a discussion of poetics based on
a
poem.

          Style and its opposite can alternate, but form must

January/Issue 2 was an exciting time for Malleable Jangle and February will be the same. The February Issue/number 3 is now online. Here is the URL for those who do not know:



http://www.malleablejangle.netfirms.com



We have a new look but the high standard of poetry remains the same. Although we are based in Australia, Malleable Jangle is International in its outlook. Quality poetry from overseas and locally. In Issue 3 the following poets are presented:



Lawrence Upton * Sue Stanford * Sabyasachi Roy * Andy Jackson * Srinjay Chakravarti * F.J. Bergmann * David Berray *



Malleable Jangle would also like to present articles on poetics, or the mechanisms of poetry, and reviews. Submissions are now open for Issue 4.



Warm regards, Robert Lane.

Research: Reviewing Bunt's Islam in the Digital Age, and following links
and links. There is rhetoric that stands out; some is reproduced below in
dialog, without attribution; all writing is wryting in this space.

Oddly, what emerges is bliss, that not only are words open to other words,
but the performativity of speech is, perhaps, already a therapeutic; in
the midst of cries, there are moments of silence.

Without hope, there is abject depression, decathexis; with decathexis,
defuge, the breath stops and stops itself. O comfort of the barren
grounds! One pulls back from the gate; Arbeit never macht frei.

Dear Nazi Pigs and Muslim cowards, We want to thank you. Because your hate
created us and made us stronger. With every swas sticker you draw, and
head you cut off, we become more ferocious. While you meet in mosques and
march on Skokie, we were being tested in battle. So look left, look right,
were dark skinned too, or blond and blue eyed just like you, trained by
the best and here amongst you. See you at the meetings, were watching you.

Think about it - don't be just another whore. Thanks. "Removed by C@ndi
with an eye" is apparently all that remains of what was the message board
forum formerly known as "ITS HAPPENNING." IH was an attempt to bring
together diverse parties from around the world to exchange opposing views
and share information. Unfortunately not all the dialog was friendly and
intended in the spirit of universal awareness.... as such, some have taken
it upon themselves to delete, corrupt, and and render unusable that which
was the IH board. IH was a purely not for profit operation and the cost
and stress of operations far exceeded any donations made toward
maintenance or upgrading as such there, will be NO rebuild. Those who gave
the most were those that gave their time for free for the thankless job of
trying to moderate an unmoderated board. This was in itself an almost
undefinable task, but those, and you know who you are, that did this, rose
to the occasion. To all of the posters who have made IH their home, we set
you free now, as this really is the end of the road for "ItsHappening" it
was fun while it lasted. Goodbye.

Explaining the second concept in the design he said it involves taking the
pedestrians from the source, not letting them accumulate into a huge crowd
that you cannot deal with like what we got now Jamaraat area, he said.
[...] The third concept is to make the stoning process much easier than
what it is nowadays by changing the shape of the Jamaraat from round to
ellipse, so that the crowd can be divided into various groups from various
directions. That will make the flow go through much easier, and the pebble
throwing process very fast and safe, for the people. A simulation model
has been designed specially for these, and Jamaraat will be given optimum
width and optimum length. The Jamaraat will be changed from a column to a
very wide wall so that it can be clearly visible and comfortable for the
pilgrims to throw their pebbles.

No wonder why Hitler wanted tocook all u Ann Franks..... All u dirty jews

Question: What is the ruling regarding washing the stones for stoning (the
Jamaraat)? Response: They should not be washed. Rather, if a person washes
them with the intention of worshipping Allaah (by this action), then this
is an innovation because the Prophet (sal-Allaahu `alayhe wa sallam) did
not do this.

On 10th Thul-Hijjah I along with my elder son went to Jamaraat for Ramee.
When we were at a distance of 10 meter from the Jamrah, we had to pull out
without Ramee; and on return both of us were hit by a speedy motorcyclist
- we fell down - sustained minor injuries - police helped and we came back
to our camp at Muzdalifah.  In the evening I and my elder son went again
and stoned the Jamrah Aqbah (the Big one) on our behalf and on behalf of
my wife and the younger fat son.

This summarily had me banned from the forum. I am not that terribly upset
about being banned. However, it does highlight the type of muddle-headed,
biased, blind support of terror that has all but guaranteed the
re-election of George W. Bush. Most Americans do not support terrorism.
Yet the left is going out of its way to coddle terrorists, even inviting
terrorist and terrorist apologist under the Democratic tent.

O believers, do not expect your enemies to end with the land of Iraq, they
shall try to take over the lands of Syria and Egypt and Arabia and Iran =85
if they could not put their agents onto power, as they did in the Gulf
lands, they shall never accept that the Muslims have a strong state.

You can go anywhere or NOwhere

Nothing is worth our children dying for unless there is a maniac or (sic)
the loose.

Ultimately, our goal is The Supreme Existance, the Muslims call that Allah
(litterally The God), the Followers of Jesus(A) call Him God, the
Followers of Moses(A) call him YHWA, the Followers of other Prophets have
used other names, the bottom line is the goal is one and same - the
Supreme Existance and Creator Sustainer of the Universes.

Then Abu Abd Allah (al- Sadiq), peace be on him, said: 'Brother of the
people of Egypt, you think that the time forces them (the sun and the
moon, day and night) to come successively, then why does the time not
force them to come back? And if the time was able to force them to come
back, why does it not take them away?

Allah is the light of the heavens and the earth; His light is as a niche
in which is a lamp, and the lamp is in a glass, the glass is as though it
were a glittering star; it is lit from a blessed tree, an Olive neither of
east nor of the west, the oil of which would well-nigh give light though
no fire touched it, Light upon Light, Allah guides to His light whom He
pleases; and Allah strikes out parables for men; and Allah all things doth
know.

This is why The Pink Swastika, a comprehensive study of homoeroticism in
Germany by Scott Lively & Kent Abrams is considered high heresy in America
while still occupying a place on the reference shelves at Yad Vashem.
Lively & Abrams confirm that Nazism was a movement born of the homoerotic
German subculture of macho homosexuals, people who fostered a violent,
anti-Semitic, and pederast-enshrining mindset, as opposed to Germany's
"femmes," the docile subculture representing perhaps 10% of German
homosexuals who condemned pedophilia, were less likely to harbor
anti-Semitic proclivities, and may claim legitimately that some of them
were German homosexuals hypocritically persecuted by the Nazis - by macho
homosexuals.

Due to the israel judaism barbarism against your people and to your noble

find your page, but finally i did; this writing means to congratulate you
and show my admirations and support on your work, because i share the same
feelings against jewish people, because even i have read the protocols of
zion i had the conviction of what jewish mean, my people is also tramped
by them, and i am not sure if my country shares my feelings about you,
cause most of them are mediatized, and influenced by the united states
culture, but not all of us have the eyes covered, some of us relize of
what is going on in the world, so once again want to express my support
and admiration from M=E9xico, and even there exists a great distance betwee=
n
your country, your culture and your language there exists a link that
unite us as brothers and makes us feel the need to be together and share
the joy and suffering and support each other.

O people! When a person meditates upon the histories of past nations and
populations, he will be instantly amazed at the revolutions and
transformations they went through. For instance, there was a pioneering
nation (i.e., the Muslim nation) which led the world for many centuries
but then, it faltered and lost its leading role; it fell in the midst of
blind imitation and followed the paths of other nations in terms of
manners and beliefs. Once it was at the acme of development and reached
the highest level of power and glory, but it later fell to the lowest
point and was afflicted with misery. It died after it had been living,
deteriorated after it was once flourishing and withered after it was
blossoming. It was the nation that discovered the sources of knowledge and
developed the Islaamic civilization and sciences, which the West later
obtained significantly, without having to exert the least of efforts. Thus
it seems as if the gates towards progress had been shut off for the
Muslims as they turned into artificial consumers of the Western
civilization. They even began to adopt certain features of it, which were
originally theirs but had been stolen away from them.

O Muslims! When a Muslim blindly imitates the West, he turns into a loyal
supporter of their beliefs and customs; he is like one who tries to reform
something but spoils it while he is unaware. He is just like a defeated
follower, like a baby who bites and severs his mother's breast while it is
in his mouth. Such a person does not know that blind copying of the West
involves hidden hazards and that our rights, honor and dignity are
violated by such imitation and imbecilic pride

Our real time intelligence is deployed worldwide for contingency
capability, executive decision making and strategic threat assessment.

if you have the time and the bandwidth i'd like some visitors to my new

it's a re-working of my cd-rom for the web, trying to capture the same
feeling of travelling through the london underground all in animated text,
and quicktimeVR.

i'd be very appreciative of any comments, good, bad, constructive,
destructive, or indifferent.

Instead of a grand reconfiguration of the list, why not simply post links
to creative work as I've said all along? That would give readers the
option of considering the talents of our culture-heroes in residence at
their own discretion. Jesse

But I suppose, at this point, we all have to admit we're being

That would be a fine thing to do. Post just one little link per poem.
Or, if you are going to post a link every day, just start a blog and
we will all know where to find your daily poems.

Free blogging:
http://www.blogger.com/start

But it also wouldn't hurt to put something in the subject line. Maybe
one or more of these:

[poetics]
[announcement]
[poem]
[politics]

And then everyone could search and sort as needed. People could, for
example, send all [poem] messages from Alan to a particular folder.

NO! Or yes, but no. Let poets send in links if they want -but dont
discourage people from sending in poems -as long as they realise that their
poems are part of the larger poetics project

i suspect there is a bit of high falutinising goin dwon;  (it was good to
see Nick Piombinos witty "reply" to monsieur d baratier on here - and Nick
is one of the tribe - his poetics/ poetry - like Alan's like Steve's etc is
also, I feel poetics in action - exatrordinary good stuff also)

 I perceive that Alan and Steve's (and some of the others' )poetry is very
much  poetics in action - poetry IS poetics

Steve is in the centre of NY -posibbly he is the centre (or the center) (
(where's Nudel ) I didnt think I would but am starting to miss his poems
also ..drn)

And I see this as comparable to some of Frank O'Hara's poems, but he threw a
lot his stuff away - Steve is "throwing tem" on to the List here - they are
a poetics in action, great poetic poems:

Here it is again: read it ! We can all simply push the delete key -that's
easy - the hard part is reading someone else than yourself or someone you
think is a great poet or is insome 'school' one approves of - and reading it
closely  and sypathetically - critically yes - but attentively -

Ha, that's just what the people who believe Oxford
wrote Shakespeare say they smell when they read me
defending the Establishment Position on the matter at
Internet authorship discussion groups.  I think
Houlihan is a trivial stasguard, but I doubt that's
she's very fearful that the loonies are going to take
over Poetry, just disgusted that, in her opinion, they
seem to be doing just that.  She could equally
appropriately accuse those attacking her as fearful
that their game is being exposed.

Do you mean alt.binaries.authors.shakespeare, Bob?

I admire your patience -- for all of me, Oxfordians are quite barking mad,
and impervious to reason.

Dave Kathman makes an heroic effort to document their lunacy on his site (as
you do to a smaller extent in "Upstart Crow") but really, it's like arguing
with a pub-bore who's both deaf and crazy...

A hiding to nothing, mate.

The sad message below just in from Dan Wilcox. Tom Nattell was a great
spirit here in Albany, NY -- the guiding light behind the "town" (as
against, or rather parellel to, the "gown") poetry scene for more than
20 years -- the indefatigable organizer of yearly anti-war, anti-aids
readings, of wonderful summer poetry events at the foot of the Robbie
Burns statue in Washington Park, the neo-beat organiser who would bring
the likes of Ferlinghetti, Ed Sanders or Anne Waldman to town, and who
could be found at all anti-war rallies. He created and for 10 years
hosted Albany's oldest continuous open mic series at the QE2 nightclub.
At parties Tom was always eager to talk not only to the poets but to
everyone -- my son Miles remembers him fondly for talking with him at
length & for teaching him how to juggle with fruit -- and, says Miles,
for his incredibly cool green beret. Tom was the heart & soul of the
Albany poetry scene, and a great poet-performer himself (often with Dan
Wilcox and Charlie Rossiter as the "Three guys from Albany" -- who
among other things travelled to all the Albanys in the country to do
readings. Check out their epic "Central Avenue" :
http://www.poetrypoetry.com/Features/3Guys/3Guys.html).
He will be sorely missed -- may his spirit travel unhindered wherever
it has to travel to, and may it visit us often for inspiration and
courage. -- Pierre

"It is with great sorrow that I must report the death of our friend Tom
Nattell early this morning.
He died peacefully at home with those he loved.  I had been over
earlier & read poetry to him.
And it is with great joy that I recall the hours & days & words & miles
I spent with him.
He will live on in all that he left behind in the poetry community & in
the community at large.

When I have details about services, etc. I will pass them on.

Peace,
DWx:

i second jerrold on keeping backchannels just that, backchannel. my hope is
that steve's new to the list and maybe just didn't know better. if someone
angers you in a private email, simply email them privately and say whatever
you want. if they had intended their views to be posted, they would have
posted them themselves.

What's incredible to me is how a superior playwright
working with standard character types and
deftly-chosen archetypal stories came to be seen as an
"incredible genius" who "tells of everything radiating
throughout time."  He doesn't.  He tells us, for
instance, just about nothing about science or POETRY!
(the nuts and bolts writing of it)--and nothing at all
about the writing of plays.  And how much does he
tells us of childhood?  There's little about the
experience of formal education, either.  To mention
just a few of the portions of life he overlooks.  I'm
a big admirer of Shakespeare and think he may well
have been the top writer of all-time, but--if so--he
was no more than a step better than dozens of other
writers in his coverage of the human experience.

Now that you mention it, I don't think there's ever been a play about
formal education. About student hijinks, sex on campus, heroic teachers,
sure, but never a play about the actual experience of education. I can see
it now: the whole cast reading and scribbling in a library for three hours.

This is a shock, moreover a personal shock. Tom
was so much to so many, with his energy, his wisdom,
his politics... his performance... and his poetry.

He did so much for so many, he did so much for me.

i will take a wedge of stone
chisel it with gentleness
grind it with entusiasm
polish it with peace
remembering him
all the while
until the world is
split off from its injustices
carved away from its wars


Love & Peace,
Gerald Schwartz

SPECIAL ONE-DAY POETRY WORKSHOP WITH ANSELM BERRIGAN

STITCHING TOGETHER A VOICE, with Anselm Berrigan
Saturday, February 5 12-4 p.m., $50, $40 members

I want to examine the artistic co-habitation of two apparently opposing
ideas: that every poet has a distinct voice, and that every voice is
constructed (a made thing). The idea being to put both notions to use in
order to write rich, long, complicated, independent-minded poems that handle
multiple subjects and that audiences want to read and hear. Another way of
putting it is looking directly at autobiographical material and external
(received, researched, appropriated, for starters) language and information
as capable of sharing the same space within poetic forms. Work by poets
Kevin Davies and Harryette Mullen involved. Participants should bring some
work in progress or notes or unfinished anythings to use as potential
material, and some reading materials of any types.

All: please feel free to pass this on to anyone you think might be
interested in writing on Kenny Goldsmith--it's already shaping up to
be a great special issue of Open Letter!

best, Lori
===================================================

CFP: Kenneth Goldsmith and Conceptual Poetics (6/1/05; journal issue)
CALL FOR SUBMISSIONS
Deadlines: 15 March 2005 for proposals; 1 June 2005 for finished essays

Guest Editors: Barbara Cole and Lori Emerson

"In 1969, the conceptual artist Douglas Huebler wrote, 'The world is full
of objects, more or less interesting; I do not wish to add any more.' I've
come to embrace Huebler's ideas, though it might be retooled as, 'The world
is full of texts, more or less interesting; I do not wish to add any more.'
It seems an appropriate response to a new condition in writing today: faced
with an unprecedented amount of available text, the problem is not needing
to write more of it; instead, we must learn to negotiate the vast quantity
that exists. I've transformed from a writer into an information manager,
adept at the skills of replicating, organizing, mirroring, archiving,
hoarding, storing, reprinting, bootlegging, plundering, and transferring .
. I've become a master typist, an exacting cut-and-paster, and an OCR
demon . . ."
- Kenneth Goldsmith, "Being Boring"

Open Letter is seeking critical and creative submissions for a special
issue dedicated to "Kenneth Goldsmith and Conceptual Poetics."  In
particular, we hope to address the ever-broadening scope of Goldsmith's
texts (inclusive but not exhaustive): 73 Poems; No.111 2.7.93-10.20.96;
Fidget; Soliloquy; Day; Head Citations; and The Weather.  As Goldsmith's
conceptual poetics works to shift literary and artistic paradigms, we
invite essays which address non-textual activities as well as writing
practices.  The editors are particularly interested in essays which
position Goldsmith beyond a US-specific context and/or which consider
Conceptual Poetics in relation to a Canadian context.

For more information on Open Letter please visit
http://publish.uwo.ca/~fdavey/home.htm

POTENTIAL CONTEXTS from A-Z:

*  aesthetics / labor
*  the body  / gender / sexuality
*  conceptual influences (i.e. Duchamp; Warhol; Cage; etc.)
*  digital poetry
*  editorial work (Warhol interviews; /ubu editions; etc.)
*  feminist readings
*  gendered readings
*  hi-jinx, hijacking and hoaxes
*  intellectual property
*  Joycean influences
*  Kootenay School of Writing influences
*  L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E influences
*  Marxist readings / materiality / mimesis
*  New York School influences
*  originality
*  pedagogy of uncreativity / Pop influences / proceduralism
*  queer readings
*  Romanticist ideals of "originality" / reproducibility
*  sound innovations (Penn Sound; sampling; etc.)
*  Toronto Research Group
*  UBU
*  voyeurism
*  WFMU
*  x
*  y
*  Zaum influences

The above list is merely suggestive; we welcome proposals on any issue that
is relevant to Kenneth Goldsmith and Conceptual Poetics.

Essays should not exceed 5000 words in length.

SUBMISSION GUIDELINES

Please send inquiries or proposals to Barbara Cole (bacole@buffalo.edu) and
Lori Emerson (lemerson@buffalo.edu) by 15 March 2005.  Notifications of
acceptance will be made no later than 15 April 2005.  Finished essays will
be appreciated by 1 June 2005.

Quite like this work; because of the earlier bandwidth considerations,
some of the video has a punk sensibility at this point. I've been
fascinated by the way that compression itself becomes part of the content,
as it changes from click to click. The word games almost literally drive
me crazy; I found myself the night before last unable to sleep while I
tried to calculate all the dual-letter combinations tending towards vowels
such as blank, stank, crank, shank, thank, spank, clank; once you do this
it never ends - the structure rots your brain...

I remember your presentations of some of this or similar work, and there's
a sense of effusiveness that I like in it. As far as I'm concerned it
plays well online, once one is used to the compression. And it's odd to
think of this work in relation, say, to the perfection of Cayley; your
sensibility is almost pop in relation to his elegance. -

Blog: http://stephenvincent.durationpress.com

Starting on January 1st I began to input, Crossing the Millennium, 1999,
A journal and photography project in which I kept a daily journal with
photographs for the entire year. The blog format has enabled the images to
be enjoined with the text, much to my pleasure. I have yet to input all the
images with January text, but by going to the "Archive:January" one can
scroll down and get the general idea.
Since the photos - as an act - were taken independently of the making of the
journal text, the juxtapositions of what one sees and what one writes make
variously for collisions and coherences. And as a "retro" experience, in
contrast to what we call the present, it becomes curious to me (at least)
how much remains the same and how much changes and how much  exists as
prefatory omen to where we are.
February days will continue.

Thanks and - as always - will appreciate any feedback,

Stephen Vincent

I would love to see [announcement] and [poem] headings, which could be
stripped if the poem (or announcement) resulted in a discussion.

welcome back, Alan.  i definitely endorse keeping your poems as texts and on the list.

and everyone should know there is something beside the delete key and digest if you want an edited list.  know a poster that you need to take time with?  then filter it to a specific folder.   presumably any email client will allow you to do this and if you have decent tech support, will put you through the steps.  and once you have done it, you can do it again ... and again ... and again

i myself have considered only lettting Pierre and Richard into my inbox (as well as myself) but that seems rather silly.

I have a big Mac. Beside my "delete" key is the + and = key. Maybe IBMs
are different.

I have very very seldom seen any posters sent by anyone. Am I missing

Yes, Steve was new, to the list and the Internet as well; I'd be
surprised if he'd ever received an e-mail like that before, so his
reaction wasn't terribly surprising.

I have a quick question: how many experimental and/or "townie" poets are
still on this list? It seems most have stopped posting, and I'm
wondering if they're still around.

Regards,

Dear List Administrator,
Could you please post the following on my behalf? thanks!


Publication Annoucement:

My new chapbook of poems "Unnecessary Roughness" has just been released from
xPress(ed), a publisher of experimental poetry based in Europe.  It is
available through the press' distributor (lulu.com) for $7 + shipping here:

www.lulu.com/xpressed

Taking its title from the language of sports, "Unnecessary Roughness"
examines issues such as the socialization of violence through game playing
and sports, the development of adolescent identity and sexuality, pain
thresholds, and gender issues.  Poetic texts incorporating the imagery and
vocabulary of various sports, (dodge ball, baseball, cheerleading, body
building, hockey, professional wrestling, etc.), explore the role of sports
in creating and reinforcing power structures and social function.

Dear Friends of Chicagopostmodernpoetry.com

I want to thank all of you so much for using the site-after returning from
vacation in sunny Brazil we were pleased to discover that we had topped
41,000 total visits since February 1, 2004 our launch date. At least for us
this seems like a
nice large number of visits.

It is our community in Chicago and Milwaukee that makes the site work and it
is a mere reflection of the poetry in our region- but I also owe the rest of
you as well in other parts of the country and now the world.  I want to
thank all the reading series animators for sending the info in a timely way
and all the poets profiled as well for making an idea for a section into a
reality.

With our Deepest Thanks

Having your own Queen Victoria can be a shock to the battered system, particularly if your name happens to be David too, so the
jokes go round about THAT footballer player and the ex-Spice, and not to exclude all this, but people wanted me to call the police
last week because of her ex who wanted to do me and a guy over, the poor chap threatened was just from the Phoenix whom I'd asked to
escort us home because about Vicky's safety, not to mention my own, AND people are starting to run away from us because in this
little village of central Leicester we are getting a reputation for bringing trouble in our wake WHILE you might notice that

THIS pattern of repetitions that cannot be called form but perhaps seeks to attain structure from chaos has NO pattern at
                                                              all

Although I've several times joked
about the digest restructuring
discussion- mainly because I
assumed, in the end, there would be no
change- now that there have
been some harsh words said
I want to emphasize that I am strongly
in favor of the list structure continuing as it
has unchanged; that I am disappointed
when poets are directly or indirectly
criticized or discouraged from posting
their creations here, and finally, I
am strongly opposed to hard and
fast distinctions between poetry and poetics...
though I also certainly don't object when some someone
chooses to identify a work as one or the other...If someone
wants to label their work, that is fine...but I
particularly treasure ambiguities and creative
misreadings...and stumbling upon a poem I didn't
expect...didn't expect to think about...so much...
like the one below...
