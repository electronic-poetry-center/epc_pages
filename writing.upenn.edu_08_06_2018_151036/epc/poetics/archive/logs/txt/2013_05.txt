Horse Less Press
Call for Book Manuscripts, Poetry & Cross-Genre Writing
Open until May 31
Editors: Jen Tynes, Michael Sikkema, Erika Howsare, and Jen Denrow
horselesspress.com

We are interested in full length (60 pages or more) manuscripts of poetry
or cross-genre writing. Please include an acknowledgements page. We prefer
PDFs.
To submit, visit our Submittable page:
https://horselesspress.submittable.com/submit

Manuscripts will be read by all four of our editors as well as a team of
trusted and brilliant readers. We will select 1-2 manuscripts from this
reading period to publish in 2014. We will make decisions and announcements
no later than August 31, 2013. Please don't query before that date. We're
happy to accept simultaneous submissions, but please contact us immediately
if your manuscript has been accepted elsewhere. We will raise a glass with
you.

We do not read blind. We are equally interested in publishing writers we
know and writers we don't, and we believe that the writer-publisher
relationship is important to the success of a book. We want to collaborate
with our authors to create the best books possible. In your cover letter,
please tell us why you think Horse Less Press is a good fit for your
manuscript. Please also tell us a little bit about your vision for the
publication and promotion of your book.

We are uncomfortable with reading fees, but we are also uncomfortable
working with authors who aren't readers and supporters of small press
publishing. When you submit your manuscript, we ask that you pre-order one
of our 2013 titles (Kristin Abraham's *The Disappearing Cowboy Trick* or
Stephanie Anderson's *In the Key of Those Who Can No Longer Organize Their
Environments*) for $15. This is the regular cost of the books, which
doesn't include shipping or the fee for using Submittable; there is no
extra fee for reading your manuscript. That is to say, it's a good
deal.*Please remember to specify which book you want in your cover
letter.
* If you don't specify, we'll choose for you. Abraham and Anderson's books
will be mailed by late summer.

Hi All,

I'm going to be running another writing workshop in the NYC area this
summer.  I'd really appreciate it if you could forward this to any
interested parties.

Thanks,
Lisa Jarnot


This summer I'll be continuing the theme of *The Poet's Notebook* with an
emphasis on *The Five Senses*. The class will run for ten weeks, with
a sequence
of two week segments exploring the fields of sight, hearing, taste, smell,
and touch.



We'll experiment with braille and sign language and synesthesia, and we
will think about our habits as writers (what sensory information do we
favor? what sensory information do we ignore?).



The class is open to creative people of all kinds, and the dates of
meetings are Mondays (6 pm to 8:30 pm):



June 3, 10, 17, 24,


July 1, 8, 15, 22, 29,

 Aug 5

Fee for the class is $300 ($275 for returning students) and the class will
be held in Jackson Heights, Queens.



Contact me at ljarnot@gmail.com to register.

Poet and publisher Jill Stengel founded a+bend press in 1999 as the print
component of her poetry reading and publication series held in San
Francisco's historically-rich North Beach, producing a chapbook for each
reader. Later she added a journal, mem, featuring writing by poet-mothers
raising young children.

Dear Jack, Jill's first full-length collection, will be available this
Spring from Black Radish Books. Nearly a dozen of her chapbooks have been
published, some of which can be viewed online at dusie.org and other
sites. Her writing has also appeared in print and online journals and
anthologies, including Boog City, Kindergarde, Otoliths, Try, and Touched
by Adoption. She has taught poetry and book arts, participates in poetry
collectives, and is active in the Poet-Moms listserv community.

children, and an oft-changing number of non-human animals.

glance at the lineup below indicates how wide-ranging the journal has
become in literary & artistic endeavor & scope, how truly international it
now is.

Subject:      dusie : the tuesday poem,

Over at the Swiss online journal Dusie (http://www.dusie.org/),
editor/publisher Susana Gardner is allowing me to curate a weekly poem on
the dusie blog. On Tuesday, April 9, 2013, the series opened with "On
Recovery," a poem by American poet Elizabeth Robinson (currently the Hugo
Fellow at the University of Montana). The Tuesdays that immediately
followed included the poem "Cityscape," by Kansas poet Megan Kaminski, "from
Winter of Weak Welcome" by Toronto poet Marcus McCann and "ANGEL GOING POW"
by American poet (and current Toronto resident) Hoa Nguyen.

http://dusie.blogspot.ca/

The series aims to publish a mix of authors from the dusie kollektiv, as
well as Canadian and international poets, ranging from emerging to the
established. Over the next few weeks and months, watch for new work by
dusies and non-dusies alike, including Stephen Collis, j/j hastain, David
W. McFadden, Edward Smallfield, Er¡n Moure, Roland Prevost, Maria Damon,
Rae Armantrout, Jenna Butler, Cameron Anstee, Sarah Rosenthal, Kathryn
MacLeod, Camille Martin, Pattie McCarthy, Stephen Brockwell, Rosmarie
Waldrop, Nicole Markoti and Deborah Poe.

A new poem will appear every Tuesday afternoon, Central European Summer
Time, just after lunch (which is 8am in Central Canada terms).

I was fortunate enough to participate in a number of dusie projects,
including the fifth dusie kollectiv, and guest-edited Dusie 10: the
Canadian issue.

Praise for *By The Hours*

The poems presented in this collection represent over a decade of work,
including poetry previously published in long out-of-print and difficult to
find chapbooks and self-published collections, newly revised for this
edition, uncollected poems from obscure journals and ezines, and a
selection of new poems. Together, they present the development of a
singular voice and vision in poetry.

The particularities of a deeply felt life are brought into focus in Eric
Hoffman=92s lovingly and carefully worked language =96 its handsome and qui=
et
music, set down as a tangible event within the flow of time.  *=96Burt
Kimmelman*
An Excerpt from *By The Hours*

The angel of history is propelled
on the storm winds of catastrophe =96

The voices recovered,
the voices redeemed =96

That lost, Adamic tongue,
secretly beneath all language,
whose presence makes possible
the impossible
act of translation =96

Perhaps
the greatest philosopher
is the collector of books,
the frequenter of emporiums
and arcades, of
illuminations,
the precisions of hermetic symbolism,
of white magic =96

Waiting has a way
of keeping one alive,
an initiative aimed at a miracle,

an infinite amount
but not for us -

Hi, everyone!

rob mclennan's notice about his weekly Dusie poem reminds me that I've
been meaning to introduce you to the weekly poem blog that I curate, The
Week Shall Inherit The Verse.

The concept is simple: each week, I post a single, previously unpublished
poem by a poet I admire. I've been putting them up since July, and have so
far published works by poets from Canada, the U.S., Scotland, Denmark, and
Israel. Browse through the "back issues" and you'll find exciting new
poems by Eileen Myles, Alice Burdick, Niels Hav, Diana Hartog, David W.
McFadden, Joel Lewis, Jay MillAr, and lots more.

All the poems are solicited. Hope you find some to enjoy!

$5 admission (in support of the readers).



*Madeline Gins*: This exceedingly troubling figure has provided our
benighted species with a new option for how to live life on this planet=97n=
ot
bad for someone who first stepped forth as a p-p-p-poet. Intent on
achieving [a] reversible destiny for our up-against-it species, she ever
pits =91despitefulness=92 against poignancy no matter how touching. Is ther=
e
any discourse she has not entered??

According to the Many-Worlds Interpretation of Quantum Physics, the version
of *Alex Duensing* that you meet may have successfully utilized a
combination of politics, theater and poetry to create anti-time, bodily
free-energy and a Gordian Knot-Type solution to all Zen koans. You may also
encounter him as pure money or as a mechanical dog.

*C. Spencer Yeh* is recognized for his interdisciplinary activities and
collaborations as an artist, composer and improviser. Recent recorded works
include *Ambient* (with Robert Piotrowicz), *1975* and* CS Yeh=92s
Transitions.* Yeh also volunteers as a movie trailer editor for Spectacle
Theater in Williamsburg, Brooklyn.

I discuss the conservative policy intellectual Niall Ferguson's sneer
that Keynesian economics are dangerous in the long run because Keynes
was a childless homosexual who preferred reading poetry to making
babies. I then recommend a short course of reading (just nine lines) for
Professor Ferguson.

hi all,

boog city is  hoping to do another oakland, calif. travel piece,
similar to one stephanie young did for us just about 10 years ago:

http://boogcity.com/boogpdfs/bc09.pdf

i'm looking for pieces of up to 250 words on whatever you want to
write about oakland, be it some words on your favorite music shop,
musical act, bookstore, writer, restaurant, park, sit-down restaurant,
delivery place, laundromat, how you take in an a's game, why you like
oakland so.

if you're up to doing so, great. eventually i'll need images to go
with your text. if you have some, swell. if not let me know as soon as
you do what you plan on writing on and i'll start to gather them.

this will all run in Boog City 81, which will be uploaded on June 18.
You'd need to email all words and images to editor@boogcity.com on or
by May 28.

if you have any questions please email editor@boogcity.com.

talk soon,
david

The first of its kind, *Troubling the Line: Trans and Genderqueer Poetry
and Poetics* gathers together a diverse range of 55 poets with varying
aesthetics and backgrounds. In addition to generous samples of poetry by
each trans writer, the book also includes "poetics statements"-reflections
by each poet that provide context for their work covering a range of issues
from identification and embodiment to language and activism.



"Just as poetry bends language away from the utilitarian task of
communication, towards unanticipated expressive potentials, so too do trans
and genderqueer ways of being have the capacity to exceed and transform
what society would have our bodies mean and do. The poets collected in this
anthology live their art as well as write it. Let them change you. Don't
miss a word." - Susan Stryker



"Troubling the Line deftly oscillates between poems and poetics statements,
detonating sense and sense making through powerfully embodied zones of
sexual desire and social play. Herein are rich meditations of
self-fashioning for a future that trips the hard wiring of our nervousness
into fearless acts of being. In this stunning and timely anthology are
complex mirrors and long shadows where the trans and genderqueer self
evolves, re-shot into poem as photograph, as exercise, as memory, art made
from enduring phenomenon into lasting primer." - Ronaldo Wilson



Poets Include:



Ahimsa Timoteo Bodhr=E1n, Aimee Herman, Amir Rabiyah, Ari Banias, Ariel
Goldberg, Bo Luengsuraswat, CAConrad, Ching-In Chen, Cole Krawitz, D'Lo,

Hello everyone,

I teach a class at NYU's Interactive Telecommunications Program about
generative, procedural and conceptual writing. We're holding our final
performance later this week, and I thought it might be of interest to some
of you. I'm glad to answer any questions about the event by e-mail. Details
below. -a

*GENERATE THIS*

Thursday, May 9th, 2013
7pm
721 Broadway, New York, NY
Ground floor (Common room)
Free

On the web: http://www.decontextualize.com/2013/05/generate-this/

On this evening, fifteen students of NYU=92s Interactive Telecommunications
Program will read aloud their experiments in generative and procedural
electronic text. These experiments, built using the Python programming
language, have been brewing and bubbling for the duration of the semester.
Examples of what you may encounter: the Bible meeting the Kama Sutra, while
the New York Times site meets its own comments. Markov chains of many sizes
and varieties; otherworldly haiku; accidental hiphop; attempts to pronounce
the unpronounceable. The corpus meets the body. One night only!

Reading and Writing Electronic Text is a course offered at NYU=92s
Interactive Telecommunication Program. (http://itp.nyu.edu/itp/). The
course is an introduction to both the Python programming language and
contemporary techniques in electronic literature. See the syllabus and
examples of student work here: http://rwet.decontextualize.com/

UnAmerican Activities #1: Peter Larkin and Lanny Jordan Jackson
May 12, 2013

UnAmerican Activities is a poetry reading series held simultaneously in New
York and Cambridge. The series aims to activate and accentuate
transAtlantic crosspollination, bringing new audiences and readers into
contact and extending the range of their activities.

Readers will reach audiences on the other side of the Atlantic via live
audio link. In the interval between readings, live video portals will be
opened in both venues so Cambridge and New York audiences can engage in
dialogue across the geographical distance.

For this first event in the series, Peter Larkin will read in Cambridge and
Lanny Jordan Jackson will read in New York.

Date: 12 May 2013
Location NYC: Page Poetry Parlor, 345 W 22nd Street
Time: 3pm (EST) refreshments, 3.30pm readings

Location Cambridge: Judith E Wilson Drama Studio, Cambridge
Time: 7-30 for 8pm (GMT).

Organisers: Ian Heames, Luke McMullan, Sophie Seita
Recordings of the readings will be hosted on Archive of the Now.

Dear Poetics List Community,

I'll be running an online poetry workshop, in affiliation with Barrelhouse
Magazine <http://www.barrelhousemag.com/>, starting June 2. The workshop is
limited to 12 participants and costs $250.00 for 8 weeks. This is a great
way to receive some feedback on your work and an opportunity to write some
new poems. Please see below for more information. Or, you may also go
directly to Barrelhouse's website (please scroll down for poetry workshop
info): http://www.barrelhousemag.com/online-fiction-workshop/.

*WORKSHOP DESCRIPTION:*

As William Carlos Williams once suggested, =93a poem is a small (or large)
machine made of words.=94 With this in mind, we will pay particular attenti=
on
to the making and writing of poems in our workshop discussions. While this
class will focus primarily on poems written by the participants, there will
also be some assigned readings. One of the peripheral goals of the course
will be to read a sampling of contemporary poets. As a poet, I take an
interest in working with local, immediate detail. So, in the course we will
also spend some of our time discussing how we can write poems that are more
responsive to our environments. Because this course will include
participants from all over we should be able to have some interesting
conversations on this topic. This course is open to all levels of
experience.

*WHEN?*

The workshop starts on June 2, 2013, and runs for 8 weeks.

*HOW MUCH?*

The workshop is $250.

*ABOUT STAN MIR:*

Stan Mir is the author of two recent books of poetry, *Song & Glass* (Subit=
o
Press) and *The Lacustrine Suite *(Pavement Saw Press). His poetry and
reviews have also appeared in publications such as American Letters &
Commentary, Colorado Review, Fence, The Poetry Project Newsletter, and
Verse. He lives in Philadelphia with his wife and daughter, and organizes
the Chapter & Verse reading series with Ryan Eckes.

Kimberly Ann Southwick was good enough to interview me for the new issue
of New York's Boog City on twenty years (so far) of above/ground press. Thanks
very much!

I've posted the interview here:

http://www.abovegroundpress.blogspot.ca/2013/05/keeping-time-rob-mclennan-interviewed.html

But you can download the original, along with the entire issue (a baseball
themed issue of poetry etc) here:

http://www.boogcity.com/boogpdfs/bc80.pdf

Boog City was also the host, many years ago, of an above/ground press
reading (and the American launch of the anthology "Groundswell: the best of
above/ground press, 1993-2003") featuring myself, Clare Latremouille and
Stephen Brockwell, January 7, 2004.

best,

Hey everybody,

Let's get Matt Roth from Kansas to NYC for the 7th annual Welcome to
Boog City poetry, music, and theater festival for the live show of his
classic Me Me Me album and perform a solo set, too.

Matt Roth was a large part of the New York City music community,
helming Olive Juice Music; recording, mixing, and mastering music for
himself and others, including Kimya Dawson, Daniel Johnston, Jeffrey
Lewis, Adam Green, The Trachtenburg Family Slideshow Players, and Toby
Goodshank; and performing live as part of Schwervon and Kansas State
Flower, and solo as Major Matt Mason USA. It was as Major Matt that he
released his classic album Me Me Me in 1998 (http://www.allmusic.com/album/me-me-me-mw0000259918
).

Now, as Me Me Me turns 15, we're going to be performing it live on
Sun. Aug. 4 at Sidewalk Cafe as part of our Classic Albums Live series
during the Welcome to Boog City festival. I've invited Matt to play
some new songs and kick in on some old ones, too, and he's excited to
take part. Now all we need to do is raise the $500 to get him here.

Donations of any and all amounts are welcome. For every dollar you
donate, get a word in the online program for the 7th annual Welcome to
Boog City poetry, music, and theater festival. 2 dollars, 2 words; 10
dollars, 10 words, and so on. For every $25 you donate get a H-2" x
W-4", 25-word 1 image ad.

Every $25 gets Matt 60 miles closer to NYC. 20 $25 donations gets us
$500 and all 1,200 miles. As donations come in, we'll update you on
how things stand.

Please send all donations to editor@boogcity.com via http://www.paypal.com/
.

Thanks for your support!

best,
David

P.S. Separately, if you have frequent flyer miles you would like to
use to get Matt a roundtrip plane ticket from Kansas, please email me.

Until June 1 we're running a subscription drive! Buy a two-issue
subscription starting with Versal 11, and receive a free back issue of
your choice. That's a bit of Versal past AND future for your illustrious
library.

Versal 11: A journal, a story of its making

it took an even ?
greater fugitive?
to get us to?
this point
--Samuel Ace, Letters

Gracing the cover of Versal 11 is a dead fish.

We've never chosen an image that so compellingly captures the work
within an issue.

Versal 11 assembles struggles and triumphs, the births and deaths we
face, and the holding on and letting go required in making our newest
issue. Featuring artwork from Andrew Friend and Mario Zoots, poetry from
Mathias Svalina, Gregory Sherl, and Zarah Butcher-McGunnigle, as well as
prose from Adam Peterson, Traci O Conner, and Leah Bailly, this is
arguably our best Versal yet.

I hope you'll join us in celebrating independent literary publishing,
and our newest issue, and all the good stuff that is
poetry&prose&art&inbetween.

Thanks for your eyes and ears, and all the best from Amsterdam,

Reception for (& presentation by) the artist, Sunday, 19 May 4 - 6 PM

*SOUTHFIRST* is proud to present *"Language Objects: Letters in Space, 1970
- 2013," *a retrospective exhibition tracking (via notebooks, holographic &
published texts, archival materials and works on paper) the evolution from
early typewriter-generated forms to more recent four-color drawing poems in
the work of American poet *Robert Grenier* between 1970 - 2013. The show
will be on view from May 18 =96 June 30, 2013.

*On Sunday, May 19, 4 - 6 PM, Robert Grenier will introduce the 'idea' for
the show, and speak to/read from & provisionally 'interpret' certain of the
materials set forth in the room. *

Over the past 40 years, poet/artist Robert Grenier (b. 1941) has constantly
pushed poetry into new frontiers of practice and utterance. His handwritten
poems, produced in the last two decades, cross the upper limit of
inscription to be both writing and drawing. His works include *Series *(Thi=
s
Press, 1978), *SENTENCES* (Whale Cloth Press, 1978), *Oakland *(Tuumba
Press, 1980), *A Day at the Beach *(Roof Books, 1984), *Phantom Anthems* (O
Books, 1986), and *OWL/ON/BOU/GH *(Post-Apollo Press, 1997), as well as
more recent online color drawing poem sequences like *POND
1*<http://bit.ly/106cFxV>
 and *PENN SCANS* <http://www.whalecloth.org/grenier/pennscans>. A graduate
of Harvard College and the Iowa Writers' Workshop, Grenier has received two
NEA fellowships for poetry writing and a 2013 grant from the Foundation for
Contemporary Arts. An archive of his work is housed in the Stanford
Libraries' Department of Special Collections. He lives in northern Vermont.

MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8

The Conversant <http://theconversant.org/>, an online literary journal that
is a part of the larger poetics collective, The Volta <http://thevolta.org/>,
is now taking submissions!

We're open to a broad range of interview projects but particularly keen on
ambitious, multi-part interview series that explore specific fields, themes
and methods. Examples include H.L. Hix's
<http://theconversant.org/?cat=42> three-question
and one-question "mini-interviews" and Philip
Metres<http://theconversant.org/?p=2864>' interview
series with Russian poets. The Conversant is also happy to accept as
submissions soundscapes/audio pieces, videos, as well as transcribed
dialogues.

As we have previously published several online
chapbooks<http://theconversant.org/?cat=252>,
we're also interested in longer interview projects that can be converted
into chapbooks.

For submissions and queries, please email the editors at
conversant.editors@gmail.com.

Poets for Living Waters is a poetry action begun in 2010 as a response to
the Gulf Oil Disaster of April 20, 2010, one of the most profound man-made
ecological catastrophes in history. While devastating, could that extreme
event be best understood as merely a partial manifestation of a widespread
but at least somewhat limited consciousness producing global ecological
crisis?

Zen Master Thich Nhat Hanh suggests that in response to the contemporary
situation, we refrain from appeals to effective argument but rather stir
affective compassion: =93We should not talk in terms of what they should do=
,
what they should not do, for the sake of the future. We should talk to them
in such a way that touches their hearts=85=94 This artistic initiative
contributes to this latter conversation, motivated by the belief that
poetry helps return us to our senses.

If you would like to submit work for consideration, please send 1-3 poems,
a brief statement of ecopoetics, a short bio, and credits for any
previously published submissions to poetsforlivingwaters@yahoo.com

Subject:      Review by Alfred Starr Hamilton--I am Immune
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

In 1984, I sent a copy of my chapbook Enoch to Alfred Starr Hamilton for
his comments and he wrote back: "I'm not the sort of poet to comment,
but I knew an Enoch and he was ok I think.

Immune,

Alfred Starr Hamilton."--That's just a remembered paraphrase--it was
actually wilder than that and the letter was more of a poem about
traveling among the stars and being a member of a Lodge.

He also sent a black & white photo-booth-in-a-bus-stop-pix which may be
in my archives at the University of Maryland--stuck away in the
letters--incl. the one I just paraphrased.  I believe he was wearing a
hat in the picture, and was looking rather dapper.

If anyone on this list remembers Alfred Starr Hamilton it would be great
to read about it.

I'd considered asking him for a tape of his reading some of his poems,
but I didn't.  Wish I had.  He probably read in a low, stumbling
forward manner--a cane-tapping of the tongue.

I'd always imagined myself ending up in a rented room writing poems and
getting old.  Happy to say that a family helps immensely.  I'd always
liked his way of saying farewell in his letters: Immune, or I am immune.
 With the permission of the Manes of Alfred Starr Hamilton, I've
borrowed it.

Immune,

Jesse

*

Quirky, electric poems, spare and challenging.
-Peter Matthiessen, author of*Shadow Country

*

*WABAC Machine* begins innocently enough with the thought that a cat has no
real name and proceeds through inexorable dream/dervish/fairy tale logic to
a place (the wild?) where nouns dissolve. This is a world of radical flux
where self is barely even a construction. Let's call it post-human. There
is nothing academic about it. Things loom up and are always something else.
Here it makes perfect sense for one "me" to say, "I sell temporary kitties
in the form of reconstituted sponges."

-Rae Armantrout, author of *Versed* and *Just Saying*

punchlines
by Aaron Tucker
$4

	why was the camel unhappy?

	its still a good idea to contemplate
	while the city sprawls out in waves
	beneath our apartment balcony:

	my father is dead hit by a car

	I land + rush to the hospital
	in time for the whistle of one lung working
	but my father is dead, mist

	later I mow my mothers lawn careful to avoid
	sporting goods skeletons + that highway
	that barn sprawling towards the cow field

	I let the grass clippings blow onto the yard
	careful to avoid thinking about that blade
	whirling slicing through the flesh of my hand

	slicing through my arm torso like an ocean drowning
	|| a bumper impact || a twenty nine story fall
	the way a yard might rush upwards me downward

	as if I woke up on a river shoreline in Montana at sunset
	repeating the same motion that the night takes
	rushing downwards over the mountains

	the moon whirls out + my mother goes to bed
	dreams of my father pushing the lawnmower
	back into the barn closing locking the door

	that blade hyperlinks to
	the grass pouring out
	of my veins onto our apartment balcony

The Dublin Writers Festival presents ...

=93LA NUIT EST MA FEMME :

Jack Kerouac=92s search for

a Language and an Identity=94

_____________________________________


Venue : The Workman's Club in Dublin, Ireland

Date : Thursday, 23 May 2013

Time : 8:30 p.m.

_____________________________________


=93LA NUIT EST MA FEMME=94

Kerouac's given name wasn=92t Jack; it was Jean-Louis.  His mother
tongue wasn=92t English; it was French.  In the early fifties Kerouac
wrote two unpublished works in French =97 =93Sur le chemin,=94 and =93La nu=
it
est ma femme,=94 in which Kerouac identified French as the language in
which he often swears, often dreams, and always cries.

=93When Jack was feeling wounded or angry,=94 Joyce Johnson remarks, =93he=
=92d
sign his letters Ti Jean.  He=92d save Jean-Louis for his darkest
moments.=94  She suggests he never felt truly American, and his love for
the star-spangled nation was always the love of an outsider.

In =93Lonesome Traveller,=94 Kerouac wrote =93My people go back to Breton
France, first North American ancestor Baron Alexander Louis Febris de
K=E9rouac ... was granted land along the Riviere du Loup after victory
of Wolfe over Montcalm; his descendants married Indians (Mohawk and
Caughnawaga) and became potato farmers ...=94

Kerouac=92s father told him : =93Ti Jean, n=92oublie jamais que tu es
Breton!=94 (=93Never forget that you are Breton!=94)  In 1965, he traveled
to Brittany searching his family=92s roots.  Unfortunately, he followed
a wrong track.  He never went any further until just before his death,
in 1969.

=93LA NUIT EST MA FEMME=94 will construct a literary exploration of
Kerouac's relationship to French, to Catholicism and Buddhism; of his
bi-lingual identity; and of his fraught relationship with America.
The selections will draw on his letters, poems, haiku and novels ...
especially his writings in French.

Two writers =97 Gabriel Rosenstock and Gear=F3id Mac Lochlainn =97 will bot=
h
translate and respond to Kerouac=92s work, in Irish and in English.  The
texts will be read to improvised jazz accompaniment by The Dirty Jazz
Band and on-screen projections created by Margaret Lonergan.

=93LA NUIT EST MA FEMME=94 is curated by Liam Carson, director of the
IMRAM Irish Language Literature Festival.

Hey everyone,

Once again, it's time for Boog City's now 10th annual small, small =20
press fair, and we'd like to extend to you once more an invite to each =20=

of you to exhibit.

The fair will once again span two days, Sat. Aug. 3-Sun. Aug. 4, and =20
be held at Brooklyn=92s Unnameable Books (600 Vanderbilt Ave.) in their =20=

spacious backyard. The fair will take place during the 7th annual =20
Welcome to Boog City poetry, music, and theater festival.

The fair will open on Saturday with performances by authors from each =20=

of the tabling presses.

Tables are $30 for the fair, $20 dollars if you bring your own bridge =20=

table (up to 3=92 x 3=92). All tabling presses will also receive a =20
complimentary online business card size ad (H-2" x W-3.5") in the =20
festival program issue of Boog City.

You can send all payments to editor@boogcity.com via =
http://www.paypal.com/=20
.

When you email me to reserve your table and schedule your reader =20
here's what I'll need:

=97a bio, logo, and url for the press

=97a bio, color foto, and url for your press' reader. (Each press will =20=

have 10 minutes total for a reader and, perhaps, to talk about their =20
press.) Though most poets (myself included) don't have their own =20
websites, I'm guessing your poet might have work, or perhaps even an =20
interview with them, online. If so, if you can please send one of =20
those urls.

Please email all of the information and images to me on or by Fri. =20
June 7, and make payment via paypal to editor@boogcity.com.

This year=92s fair will feature readings, musical performances, short =20=

political talks, our new BoogWork poetry workshop and reading series, =20=

and our annual panel.

We look forward to the fair once again being a warm gathering with =20
wonderful books, poetry, music, and other items from around our =20
creative community.

as ever,
David

P.S. Apologies if you received more than one copy of this email.

I'm very pleased to announce that my new book is out from Singing Horse
Press (singinghorsepress.com).  This is the second and concluding volume
of my work on my mother's Alzheimer's.

The book is also available from from spdbooks.org at
http://www.spdbooks.org/Producte/9780935162516/quotshe39s-welcome-to-her-diseasequot-dementia-blog-volume-two.aspx

Please see there for information about the book and a cover image. Gaye
Chan did beautiful covers for both volumes. The back of each includes a
"memory box," inspired by those you see in Alzheimer's homes.

Thank you to everyone who has supported this project over many years.

aloha,

Susan M. Schultz

In Wim Wender's magnificent film, Wings of Desire, Peter Falk (who plays himself), at
one point rhapsodizes on the immediacy of life as illustrated by the marks created with
his pencil. For the artist, the pencil is the intermediary, the conduit between eye and
coordinated vision. Over the years, I have amassed a collection of pencils that were
either intrinsically intriguing or that suggested a specific purpose. I doubt that many
of them would be especially prized by bonafide pencil-collectors;  no, this display is
pretty-much self-indulgent. I do however, appreciate the possibility of a story told on
as well as by-means-of these implements, which is I suppose, what advertising-pencils
are about. And, it will possibly come as no surprise (assuming that you've seen my
otherwork), that I just liked the idea of these long thin scans of pencils linked to
their itemization. Something could also be made of the dwindling availability of
varieties of drawing implements over the years.

** Kenyon Review Managing Editor Tyler Meier Named New Executive Director
of the University of Arizona Poetry Center
------------------------------------------------------------
College of Humanities Dean Mary Wildner-Bassett has just named Tyler Meier=
 as the new Executive Director of the University of Arizona Poetry Center.=
 Meier brings years of experience as a poet, administrator and teacher to=
 his new position at the Poetry Center, which he assumes on August 5.

Meier comes to the Poetry Center from The Kenyon Review in Ohio where he w=
as the managing editor as well as the co-director of the Young Writers Sum=
mer Program. He received an MFA from the University of Washington, and his=
 poetry and nonfiction have appeared in At Length, AGNI (online), Laurel R=
eview, Bat City Review, jubilat, Washington Square, Thermos, Forklift, Ohi=
o, and elsewhere.

=E2=80=9CNow that the Poetry Center has settled into its landmark building=
, we are ready to embark on the next era of the Center, to expand our vibr=
ant programs and build new audiences for poetry here and across the countr=
y. I know Tyler will bring energy and enthusiasm to the position,=E2=80=9D=
 said College of Humanities Dean Mary Wildner-Bassett.

=E2=80=9CI=E2=80=99m thrilled to join the Poetry Center staff as Executive=
 Director,=E2=80=9D said Meier. =E2=80=9CFrom the volunteers and donors an=
d docents to the writers who visit in the Reading Series, from the incredi=
bly dedicated staff to the larger community served by the collections and=
 programs and events, I=E2=80=99ve been truly astounded by all of the peop=
le who participate in the daily life of the Center.  The place positively=
 hums.  This must be what Ruth Stephan had in mind over fifty years ago wh=
en she had the original, beautiful idea for a Poetry Center.  It is an asp=
irational space that recognizes and celebrates a central role for poetry i=
n our contemporary culture, and it amplifies our hopes for what the art fo=
rm might do in the years to come.=E2=80=9D

Meier will replace Gail Browne who has served as the Executive Director of=
 the Poetry Center since 2002. Browne is pursuing other arts administratio=
n opportunities in the greater Phoenix area.

Hi,

In a little over two months, to mark our 22nd anniversary, we'll be =20
putting on our seventh annual Welcome to Boog City poetry, music, and =20=

theater festival, featuring poets, musicians, and playwrights =20
performing at two venues, in two boroughs, over four days, from Fri. =20
Aug. 2-Mon. Aug. 5. Among the over 70 acts taking part are the poets

Toby Altman * Margaret Bashaar * Marina Blitshteyn
        Christophe Casamassima * Charity Coleman * Leopoldine Core
Steve Dalachinsky * Ray DeJes=FAs * Thomas Devaney
        Timothy Donnelly * Buck Downs * Greg Fuchs * Tony Iantosca
Jenny Johnson * Becca Klaver * Amy King * Alan Kleiman
        Ron Kolm * Jaclyn Lovell * Tony Mancus * Kristi Maxwell
Lynn Melnick * Suzanne Mercury * Thurston Moore
        Melanie Neilson * Yuko Otomo * Daniel Owen * Morgan Parker
Sarah Jeanne Peters * Montana Ray * Larissa Shmailo
        Paul Siegell * Kimberly Ann Southwick =95 Sampson Starkweather
S.M. Stone * Paige Taggart * Maribeth Theroux * Sarah Anne Wallen

Ten days before the event, we'll be putting out the festival issue of =20=

performers. Here's what last year's looked like:

http://www.boogcity.com/boogpdfs/bc72.pdf

Advertising in the festival issue of Boog City means you will reach =20
more than 3,000 readers, poetry lovers, and small press aficionados =20
throughout the East Village, other targeted areas of lower Manhattan; =20=

Williamsburg and Greenpoint, Brooklyn; as well as bonus distribution =20
at Boog City events. That's an increase of 33.3% over our regular =20
issues for no additional cost. And, since this issue is also a program =20=

for the festival, readers will give it a closer read as they check to =20=

see who's up later on that day and throughout the festival.

Boog City continues to offer our special Small Press Ad Rates. That =20
means when you advertise with us you will save 50% off of our regular =20=

As I mentioned in previous emails to you, Boog City focuses on getting =20=

the word out about lesser-known artists, be they poets, prose writers, =20=

musicians, painters, photographers, or cartoonists. Each month we =20

Jarnot, Eileen Myles, Kristin Prevallet, and recent Pulitzer Prize =20
winnr Tracy K. Smith, alongside our music section, small press book =20
reviews, political commentary, art, comics, and photographs.

We look forward to working with you to bring your message to the local =20=

arts community to increase awareness and sales of your publications in =20=

the New York area.

as ever,

"GEEK OF THE WEEK":

Before our Q&A, Geekadelphia's Chris Urie generously writes: "To me, =

Subject:      my first two novels,

FICTION: If anyone is interested:

since I've been going through boxes lately for the sake of preparing my
literary archive, I've discovered further copies of my first two
novels--white (2007) and missing persons (2009)--either or both of
which can still be purchased directly through me.

They're $20 each (postage included; outside of Canada, $20 US) either via
my paypal on the sidebar of robmclennan.blogspot.com, or by sending cheques
to me at: 402 McLeod Street #3, Ottawa ON Canada K2P 1A6.

I've also a collection of short short stories out next spring, have
another collection of short stories I've been spending the past year
attempting to complete, and have been working on at least one other novel,
with the hopes of completing such possibly next year, or even the year after.

A selection of my upcoming collection of short short stories appeared this
past January as a chapbook with Sacrifice Press:
http://sacrifice-press.tumblr.com/post/40217210025/january-2013-the-uncertainty-principle

And stories from my more recent manuscript recently appeared online
in Numero Cinq:

Archive from "A Secret Location": Small Press / Mimeograph Revolution, =
1940s-1970s

We are pleased to offer for sale a captivating and important research =
collection of little magazines and other printed materials that =
represent, chronicle, and document the proliferation of avant-garde, =
underground small press publications from the forties to the seventies.

The starting point for this collection, "A Secret Location on the Lower =
East Side," is the acclaimed New York Public Library exhibition and =
catalog from 1998, curated by Steve Clay and Rodney Phillips, which =
documented a period of intense innovation and experimentation in =
American writing and literary publishing by exploring the small press =
and mimeograph revolutions.

The present collection came into being after the owner "became obsessed =
with the secretive nature of the works contained in the exhibition's =
catalog." Using the book as a guide, he assembled a singular library =
that contains many of the rare and fragile little magazines featured in =
the NYPL exhibition while adding important ancillary material, much of =
it from a West Coast perspective.

The Archive from "A Secret Location" was collected by a reclusive New =
Jersey inventor and offers a rare glimpse into the diversity of poetic =
doings and material production that is the Small Press Revolution. It =
provides a rich gathering for framing an understanding of the various =
drifts, swirls, and eruptions in the poetry and art firmament of the =
era, including: Beat Generation, Counterculture, New York School, Venice =
West, San Francisco Renaissance, Wichita Vortex, Black Mountain, =
Mavericks, Hippies, Diggers, and related iterations that inform, incite, =
and inspire one another and the culture at large in ways we are only now =
beginning to fully grasp.

The collection includes excellent runs and significant examples of =
important little mags including:

Angel Hair, Beatitude, Big Table, Black Mountain Review, C, Caterpillar, =
Fuck You, Gnaoua, Grist, The Hasty Papers, Insect Trust Gazette, J, =
Kulchur, Locus Solus, Matter, Measure, Miscellaneous Man, Merlin, =
Mother, Now, Open Space, The Outsider, Pacific Nation, Poems from the =
Floating World, Renaissance, San Francisco Earthquake, Set, Some/thing, =
Tree, Trobar, Whe're/, and Yugen.

Additionally, the collection includes a representative sampling of =
sixties West Coast counterculture publications, including: The San =
Francisco Oracle, The Southern California Oracle, Communications Company =
(the publishing arm of the Diggers); items relating to the explosive San =
Francisco music scene including a collection of handbills and postcards =
from Family Dog and others; newspapers and magazines of radical politics =
such as The Berkeley Barb, Ramparts, The Realist; uncommon pre-zine =
self-published journals of offbeat commentary such as Horseshit and Jack =
Green's Newspaper; and a wide assortment of pamphlets, magazines and =
diverse additional obscure and rarely seen publications from the period.=20=

Subject:      recs for contemporary poetry with witches?
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1

Hello All,

I'm working on a sequence of poems about witches and girls. I'm interested
in the natural kinship between these adversaries and how they engage in a
battle without weapons. While my project is largely metaphorical--about
feminine archetypes, aging and coming of age--I'm doing a little research
on early modern witch trials (esp. Spanish Inquisition) that I hope will
connect.

Right now I have a good list of books and films, but it's a little short on
poetry, especially contemporary poems. Jennifer Calkin's *A Story of
Witchery* (Les Figues Press) is on my desk as I write and I'm looking for
other books to join it.

I'm open to any and all suggestions!

Thank you,

Meryl DePasquale
