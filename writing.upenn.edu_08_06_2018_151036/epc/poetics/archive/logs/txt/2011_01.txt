"Launch it on the cusp," replied Caleb when I asked him if he wanted his
book to come out in 2010 or in 2011. So I am. It's 2011 on this side of the
International Date Line, but still 2010 for most of the mailing list, so
this is both the first book from Otoliths for the new year, & the last for
the old.

Che Guevara and I met again at the annual conference in Wichita. We set to
scavenging the pre-conference breakfast platters, pouring ourselves some
black coffee and catching up on business. Over the course of conversation,
Che became alarmingly introspective and by the time we finished our cups he
made this observation: =93While a person dies every day during the eight or
more hours in which he or she functions as a commodity, individuals come to
life afterward in their spiritual creations. But this remedy bears the germ=
s
of the same sickness: that of a solitary being seeking harmony with the
world.=94



At first I was taken aback, confused as I was by his statement, but it all
started to make sense as the day progressed. Indeed, later that night in my
motel room I was so consumed with Che=92s insight that I began penning *Mar=
ket
Street Exit* as a response. Che, old buddy, this one=92s for you. *=97Caleb
Puckett*



Do not adjunct your set!  Do not change that diode!  But by all means take
the next exit at Market Street if you want to ride into the sunset of a
fading empire and its Western Sizzler buffet of fandangoed language.  A
gallows poetics haunts this bible-belt church funhouse of prose. Do not
Pascal.  Do not collect toe wonder doll wars.  You'll be begging your pardo=
n
for the Earth because this book by Caleb Puckett has "the highest level of
recycled content. Guaranteed."  *=97Grant Matthew Jenkins*

Hi poetics list folks, I made a web toy thing!

  http://resolution.decontextualize.com/

Struck by inspiration on New Years Eve, I scraped twitter for the word
"resolution" for 24 hours or so, extracted things that looked like new years
resolutions, and fed them through a Markov chain-based text generation
algorithm (a la Travesty). The results are a sometimes syntactic, sometimes
absurd mishmash of twitter's 2011 aspirational zeitgeist. Examples of the
generated output:

"Stop using the world, and just be awesome junior art director, hello!"
"Not be someone can have a few, but then it occurred to me after the
wedding,... maybe."
"Avoid people interested in helping me out so bad. And CHILL OUT!"
"Meet @justinbieber to follow me back!"

Enjoy!

CALL FOR PROPOSALS

The editor of a book collection tentatively called The Wild That =
Attracts Us: New Critical Essays on Robinson Jeffers invites proposals =
for essays that evidence the advance in Jeffers scholarship, especially =
since the publication of the most recent collections in the early- and =
mid-1990s.  Since the publication of those volumes, The Robinson Jeffers =
Association has prompted a great deal of new work on Jeffers, most =
especially through their annual academic conferences.  Likewise, the =
founding of Jeffers Studies has proved to be a real stimulus for Jeffers =
scholarship.  Given the enlivened atmosphere of Jeffers scholarship, the =
time is right for a new collection of essays, one that significantly =
adds to the body of critical work on Robinson Jeffers.
=20
To that end, proposals are invited for essays that specifically address =
the critical sea-change of the past two decades, especially as it =
concerns Jeffers study, including but not limited to: the full advance =
of ecocriticism; the re-imagining of regionalism as place studies; the =
continuing development of cultural studies and the new historicism; the =
development of the New Formalism; the increasingly poignant vector of =
science and literature; the advances in narratology; the glaring =
omission of feminist analysis in Jeffers scholarship; the similar dearth =
of writing about the teaching of Jeffers.  The primary audience for this =
project will be academic, faculty and students primarily at the =
undergraduate and graduate level; secondary audiences would include the =
general public, especially given that Jeffers has long maintained an =
energetic and mindful readership.
=20

The new ebook from Argotist Ebooks is =E2=80=9CMuseless Now Fay Wray=E2=80=
=9D by Michael Basinski, with Illustrations by Ginny O=E2=80=99Brien
Description:=20
=E2=80=9CMuseless Now Fay Wray=E2=80=9D is a collection of poems in three s=
equences. The poetries are juxtaposed fragments composed to conceal and rev=
eal by focus and out of focus musical constellations. There is rhythm first=
 rather than the arrogance of meaning. They are to be ancient.

open dates are Tues. June 28 and Tues. July 26 at 6:00 p.m.

Below this note is our invite letter, which spells everything out.

Please backchannel any inquiries or suggestions, be they for your own =20=

Hi,

David Kirschenbaum here. I=92m the editor and publisher of Boog City, a =20=

20th year. I=92d like to invite you to take part in season eight of our =20=

other beverages, and cheese and crackers and hummus and chips.

Once a month I have a different non-NYC press host and feature three =20
or more of their authors to read (we=92ve had as many as 10 for one =20
press and usually have 3-6) for 60 minutes total. We also have a =20
musical act perform two 15-20 minute sets. If the visiting press is =20
able to book the musical act that=92s preferred, so it=92s truly their =20=

night, if not I can book one that I think will work well with the =20
night. (Also, once a year we play host to our NYC brethren.)

Reading this year -- Wish I'd known, but will try to get there and hope to
see y'all there too.

Apologies for cross-posting

Just a reminder that the podcast with Andrew Brewerton reading his "Raag
Leaves" continues. If you click on the feed link at
www.wildhoneypress.com you will have a number of options: you can
subscribe to the feed via various programs or listen to a particular
page by clicking on the number. One can also subscribe via iTunes (just
search for Brewerton in the iTunes store.)

To quote from the Shearsman page:
(http://www.shearsman.com/pages/books/catalog/2008/brewerton.html )

"Raag Leaves" is a book of 37 eight-line lyrics - printed on the recto
pages only - offered to the author's friend, the Bengali artist Paresh
Chakraborty, one of whose pastel works graces the cover of these two
editions. The collection demonstrates what some of us have known for
some time: that Andrew Brewerton's quiet poetic voice is one of intense
power. As Chris Goode wrote, of Brewerton's reading at the 2006
Cambridge Conference on Contemporary Poetry: 'the plastic resilience and
the musical precision of these beautifully balanced and organised poems
was utterly compelling'.

On a personal note, I find it difficult to articulate why I like these
poems so much in any way that do them justice. There are parts I'm
fairly sure I don't understand, despite repeated readings / listenings.
Yet "Raag Leaves" continues to be an experience of wonder, undiminished
no matter how often I've returned to it.

Enjoy,

Randolph.

THE CURSE OF THE "CODE BLUE" MOTTO

http://tinyurl.com/2ekdp9c is the most useful 'explanation' I've run across
of what happened to the Canadian Junior team in its stunning 5-3 loss to
Russia. It isn't an explanation, of course, so much as a good indication of
just what happened. Many are asking whether it was a collapse or a comeback.
The article supports both quite well. In my opinion, it's more interesting
as a comeback than it is as a collapse. The Canadian media, after the game,
held one long funeral attempting to explicate the collapse. It was totally
"code blue". Cardiac arrest. The motto of the club this year was "Code
Blue". The media gave them their code blue at the end of the game.

Who knew that their motto would prove ironic? Did whoever thought up the
motto for the Canadian juniors, after the final game, glimpse in a kind of
literary horror the final meaning the motto would have in history? Motto as
pressaging the cardiac arrest of the Canadian team itself in the third
period from hell? A sense of being trapped in the inevitability of a story
that they had helped write without knowing the ending and the meaning that
would give the motto?

Consider another case of literary horror. In The Shining, there's the moment
when the wife discovers that what her husband has been writing all winter
amounts to an entire volume of repetitions of one sentence: "All work and no
play makes Jack a dull boy."

It's funny but it's also a moment of literary horror. He's mad! Or is he
just postmodern???? A conceptual poet??? No he's mad, look out for the axe!!
A boy so dull cannot but be mad!!

Similarly the moment, after the third period, of the revelation of the final
meaning of the "Code Blue" motto. A little frisson of the secret wiles of
destiny. A peek into the machinery of the universe.

It's more interesting as a comeback than it is as a code blue, however. This
was the third straight game in which the Russians had rallied from at least
a 0-2 score in the third period to win the game. These were the comeback
kids supreme. ...The article I've linked to says

"Down the hall in the Russian dressing room, head coach Valeri Bragin let
his players have it. He broke the white board and urged them for one more
comeback like they did against Finland in the quarter-finals and Sweden the
following afternoon in the semis. "After that, we have no choice but to
win," said Russian forward Maxim Kitsyn, who scored his club's second goal,
13 seconds after Artemi Panarin scored his first of two."

One of the things we saw that was quite beautiful was a reinvigorated
Russian attack. The Russians are deservedly famous already for the offensive
dynamism of their top forwards such as Ovechkin, Malkin, Semin, Datsyuk,
Federov, and Kovalchuk. We saw similarly brilliant Russian stings from the
captain Vladimir Tarasenko, Artemi Panarin, and Yevgeni Kuznetsov. They
swarmed in full swoop around the Canadian goal in cohesive attack. To say
nothing of the stellar defence provided by the likes of Dmitri Orlov who, in
the third period, engineered lightning quick puck take-aways and offensive
movement into the Canadian zone. And Igor Bobkov, the questionable second
stringer goalie from the Ontario Hockey League, the only Russian playing in
Canada, was absolutely perfect in relief of Shikin for two periods. The
Canadians did not score one goal on the immense Bobkov.

Tarasenko's one-timer, the tying goal, was a thing of beauty. He received a
similarly beautiful pass from Evgeny Kuznetsov who got 3 assists, the most
points by anyone in the game. Kuznetsov is the only Russian player young
enough to be eligable for the NHL draft next year. And Artemi Panarin got
two goals. We will hear more from him also. Tarasenko came back to score his
goal after being escorted from the ice doubled-over in pain.

The Canadian team collapsed into code blue. But the idea that they did it to
themselves discounts far too much the sensational comeback mounted by a club
that had mounted similar comebacks in their two previous games. They were
the cardiac kids, and they were heart stoppers. Score one for the
Fatherland! Nastrovia! It is good to see Russian hockey strong. Canada has
won that tournament too much. It is good to see other countries winning.

That game was one of the most exciting hockey games I have ever seen. Ever.
Even when it was 3-0 for Canada, it was definitely a game. As the article
I've linked to points out, the Russians began to assert themselves even in
the second period. The first period was total and complete Canadian
domination and ended 2-0. But in the second period, the Russians showed life
and played better than the Canadians even while shorthanded. The game was
chuck full of brilliant scoring opportunities for each team, crushing but
totally legal hits, little masterpieces of hockey genius plays, and
outstanding saves at both ends. It was not an ugly match at all.

Imagine the party in Moscow! Rock on Ruskies! Rock on! International hockey
is very healthy. That tournament was dramatic proof.

I had a funny encounter with my cousin about the World Junior tournament. He
feels it's wrong. It's wrong to put such a spotlight on kids so young. It
can destroy lives and warp them forever. All in the name of a national
obsession with winning hockey games. He's an odd duck. He also does not like
NHL hockey or drama. Entertainment drama is an empty shell that pales to
life, for him. Reality. Let us seek reality.

The reality for me is that I have rarely seen hockey so good as the final
two games Canada played against the USA and Russia. It was supremely
entertaining. And quite hopeful, I feel, for both the sport of hockey and
the future we glimpse for both the budding Russian stars and the great
talents we see on the Canadian team including Bradon Schenn from Saskatoon
who tied a Canadian tournament record for the most points (18) in the entire
tournament. He did better than Gretzky, Crosby, Lemeiux, and all but Dale
McCourt among Canadian players. Though he did not come close to Peter
Forsberg's record of 34 points. Marcus Naslund got 24, that year.

The quality of the hockey was often just way more entertaining than NHL
hockey and it was dipped in the explosive, brilliant athletic energy of
teenagers emerging on a world stage with all their might. And the Russians
did it in a deafening arena packed to the rafters with foreign Canadians who
had invaded Buffalo with all the force Canada applied to the Russians in the
first two periods. It was absolutely sensational, memorable, exciting,
inspiring, invigorating. Teens are of course of somewhat frailer
psychologically than adults, but judging from the interviews with the
Canadian players, they're taking it in stride and are justly proud of what
they brought to the rink. And they left it all on the rink. They played
their hearts out. To a code blue, yes. But life goes on, and this will make
them stronger.

Another article says

"The Russians have often been the anti-team of late, a collection of talent
that cannot be meshed. Well, not this time. Russia is a hard country, and a
country of artists, and this team managed to blend them both. When asked why
this team had no quit, what made it so special, Bobkov did not hesitate.
"Friendship. Yes, [we play] only for each other," he said, positively
glowing. "It's unbelievable. We won last three games . it's unbelievable.
It's the friendship. We never gave up.""

I expect the friendships among the Canadians formed through this tournament
are very similar. Braydon Schenn got a one-timer equal in beauty to
Tarasenko's goal--and with a pass from Marcus Foligno as beautiful as
Kuznetsov's to Tarasenko.

But they could not escape the fatal motto. The fatal motto of "Code Blue"
that, all along, hid the true nature of its meaning till the end. Who is the
lucky man? The ancient Greeks say "Who knows who is lucky until the end?"
Indeed. The "Code Blue" motto secretly whispered of the comeback of the real
cardiac kids who stopped the heart of an entire Canadian nation and
jump-started a party in Moscow I would love to be part of.

The Canadian coaching very explicitly created an "identity" for the team
that all players had actually to sign their agreement to. This "identity"
was of a lunch-bucket brigade of team players. It served them well for two
periods. But it was an identity lacking in artistic possibility. The "Code
Blue" in hockey often awaits the lunch-bucket brigade facing another
identity--the cardiac kids of other cultures playing for each other and the
beauty of the game. The Canadian lunch-bucket identity was rattled and could
not cope with the Russian art.

Which only underscores the need for greater artistry in Canadian culture!
Nostrovia!!

With the help of my stepson, I've managed to correct some technical =
problems I experienced when I published ENTER /EXIT to YouTube several =
months ago. I've posted an improved version of the  work that is much =
closer to what I originally recorded. Please check it out at:


http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DpVuy-L6X2OI


Jukka-Pelka Kervinen, publisher of x(Press(ed) Books has agreed to let =
me publish AVENUE NOIR on Scribd.com. Interested readers can still =
purchase it from Lulu.com or Amazon.com. Among  my writing, AVENUE NOIR =
continues to be one of my personal favorites. I've also considered it a =
comparatively easy way for new readers to grasp the nature of my work. =
You can read it at:

MIME-Version: 1.0

Dear Friends,

Last year I curated and constructed a collaborative, hand-sewn,
one-of-a-kind book for Bernadette Mayer, with submissions from
artists/writers around the country. This project led me, as *Drunken
Boat*<http://www.drunkenboat.com>'s
fiction editor, to conceptualize a larger folio of work. The folio will be
published in *Drunken Boat*'s Issue 14 (summer 2011), and below is the call
for submissions (drafted with Bernadette Mayer):
*
Call for Submissions: The Bernadette Mayer Folio: Bernadette Mayer's writing
experiments, from the 1970s to the present, challenge artists to change the
world. We are looking for art and writing that responds to this notion
and/or to Bernadette Mayer. Your response can be written, performance-based,
filmed, recorded, visual. We seek responses through any medium, and
encourage media projects. Consider ways in which your response might operate
at the intersection of conceptual art, performance and experimental
work*.*Deadline 15 April, 2011.
*

Please pass along to writers and artists who might be interested in
submitting/creating something for this folio. Thank you for your time and
consideration.

Best wishes,
Deborah Poe

Praise for Kate Street
Looking over Kate Street, over the rambling boulevard littered with "a
permissible tryst", "a bedouin of shoes", the cagey tenderness of a father
ushering his daughter into self-hood backlit by the "nuzzle-spent release
of horror", one is compelled to trudge forward on the trail rob mclennan
has generously broken, searching madly for "a pretty name for what we
almost do." Love-worn, rage-prone, and intent upon reuniting with nature,
these poems pick through the detritus of the contemporary conflagration
without complaint, and deconstruct our flabby material acquisitions in
search of real human connection. Never precious, these poems ask for
forgiveness for their very existence in an oft-dismissive world,
apocryphally offering: "I am at the end of the machine, extending whatever
boundary of forgiveness that I would know too well." -- Paige
Ackerson-Kiely

Bernadette Mayer wrote STUDYING HUNGER JOURNALS on the heels of completing
=93Memory,=94 her big =93emotional science project=94 of the early seventie=
s. In
part the journals explore psyche and were undertaken, appropriately, in
cahoots with a psychiatrist via two running journals, so that while she kep=
t
writing in one he could read the other. She wrote in colored pens, intendin=
g
to =93color-code emotions=94=97to see if her synaesthetic ability to see le=
tters
as colors might act as a bridge to seeing emotions. Her intentions also
included recording =93special states of consciousness=94 as an =93observer =
of self
in process.=94 She had had an idea: =93=85if a human, a writer, could come =
up with
a workable code, or shorthand, for the transcription of every event, every
motion, every transition of his or her own mind, & could perform this
process of translation on himself, using the code=85 he or we or someone co=
uld
come up with a great piece of language/information.=94 While an abridged
edition appeared in 1975 with Adventures In Poetry/Big Sky, this is the ful=
l
text of that enterprise.

Heading into 2011 my next posting on Poems and Poetics (January 13) is a =
small group of excerpts from the early twentieth-century Yiddish poet, =
Mikhel Likht, translated by Merle Bachman with the following comments by =
herself and me:

=20

"What emerges in Likht's work from 1923, as Bachman delivers it to us in =
English, is an extraordinarily complex & experimental poetry & poetics, =
far more radical in structure & content than all but a handful of his =
American counterparts & near contemporaries [Pound, Zukofsky, Williams, =
Cummings] & to some degree predating most of them.  It is a confirmation =
as well of Kenneth Rexroth's observation of a Yiddish avant-garde & =
futurist presence in his own early years in New York: 'A good case could =
be made for the claim that the best writing done in America in the first =
quarter of the [twentieth] century was in Yiddish. I don't think it's =
really true, but it is sufficiently true to be passionately arguable in =
one of those passionate arguments that used to sprinkle the whiskers =
with sour cream in the Caf=E9 Royale.' In Likht's case, however, the =
aptness of Rexroth's original appraisal, often repeated in conversation, =
seems remarkably & strikingly on target.=20

=20

"Writes Bachman in a brief summary of Likht's life & career: 'Mikhl =
Likht was an avant-garde Yiddish poet in New York in the 1920s and '30s =
(although he kept writing until his death at the age of sixty in 1953).  =
Born in a Ukrainian village in 1893, he came over to the U.S. in 1913, =
where he eventually participated in the short-lived movement of American =
Yiddish modernist poetry associated with the "In zikh" group (meaning =
"within one's self; introspective").  Likht was both lauded and scorned =
by his Yiddish contemporaries for the ways in which he dared to leap =
over the heads of his Yiddish audience by embracing a highly =
idiosyncratic and often obscure vision in his poetry. However, he is a =
potential figure of great interest for poets and scholars interested in =
a multi-ethnic American modernism.  Likht was an avid reader and =
follower of modernist poetry in English, and translated numerous poems =
into Yiddish by writers as diverse as Carl Sandburg, Mina Loy, Ezra =
Pound, and Gertrude Stein.  Perhaps his greatest achievement lies in the =
nine lengthy poems he published that he called "Processions."  Pages =
long, they run through a gamut of styles and innovations and could =
justifiably be regarded as choice examples of the modernist "long =
poem."'

=20

"A full translation of Likht's 'Processions' - by Bachman & myself - is =
now in progress. (J.R.)"

MIME-Version: 1.0

Hi all,

I'm teaching two weekend poetry workshops in Sunnyside Queens and am
looking for students. I'd appreciate it if you could pass this along
to interested parties.

Thanks very much,
Lisa Jarnot

One:  a manuscript development workshop
on the weekend of January 22nd and 23rd.

Limit 4 students

Students should have roughly 30 pages of material to bring to the
class (more if you have it). I'd like to work with
manuscripts-in-progress, but the parameters are wide: chapbooks in
progress, full-length books in progress, or groups of poems that seem
destined to fit together in some kind of larger work.  You don't need
80 pages of work, and you don't have to have it in any set order.  In
our two group meetings we'll read the works out loud, look at themes,
form, potential organizing principles, and publishing options.

The class will meet on two consecutive days so that we can build up
some momentum:

Saturday January 22 from 2:30 to 5:30 and Sunday January 23 from 2:30
to 5:30.  In addition I will schedule a one hour follow up individual
tutorial with each student in early February. (Giving you time to make
revisions and giving me a chance to have a second read of the work.)

The fee is $150, payable in two installments if you need to.

Two: An ongoing drop in class every other saturday (next meeting Jan.
15th, 3:30 pm). In this workshop we're reading the Oxford English
Dictionary (next class is the letter G) and students are bringing
their own work to share. $30 per class.

see also my website lisajarnot.com for more details.

and please contact me at ljarnot@gmail.com to sign on.

hello again,

the very kind Maleka Fruean recently interviewed me for Big Blue Markble =
Books.

some things said: "...and your jeans, yeah, they=E2=80=99re down around y=
our ankles
and you have to do that hilarious, wide-legged lurch over to the cabinet =
to
get another roll."

"An Evening of Remembrance: Haiti, the Earthquake" at the DuSable Museum



Saturday, January 15, 2011 (6:00-10:00 p.m.)



The Haitian Congress to Fortify Haiti invites you to an evening of
reflection and remembrance of the January 12, 2010 Haiti earthquake victims,
and in honor of the birthday of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., at the DuSable
Museum of African American History. Dignitaries, friends, and allies will be
in attendance. The Haitian Congress to Fortify Haiti is organizing this
event in collaboration with the Consulate General of Haiti in Chicago, the
Borderbend Arts Collective, and other local organizations. There is a $15
suggested donation.



Participants, performers, and activities include:

  * Beethova Obas, world renowned Haitian artist

  * Clifford Kelley, WVON radio show personality-emcee

  * Afro-Ethnic Folklorico featuring Groupe Dara Gee

  * Avery R. Young, poet

  * Tamboula Ethnic Dance Company

  * Also, children and families can participate in arts workshops at the
event, before the performances begin.



This event also serves to celebrate important historical and cultural
connections Chicago and Haiti; since this event happens on Dr. Martin Luther
King's birthday, events during this day will highlight Civil Rights
connections between Haitians and African Americans. Attendees are encouraged
to donate to efforts to help Haitians with ongoing efforts to rebuild their
country, since the earthquake that hit Haiti in January 2010.



The location chosen for this event, The DuSable Museum of African American
History, is important for several reasons. The Dusable Museum is one of
Chicago's most important cultural institutions, and its commitment to
presenting African American programs is essential. In addition, the museum
is named after Haitian-born Jean Baptiste Point du Sable, who is widely
regarded as the first settler of Chicago.

If you look through Bernadette Mayer's writing experiments, you'll find
several possible quotes.

Someone is also doing an anthology of Centos, though I've lost track of the
details. There is a page about the Centos form, and a links to some people
who have used it:

Actually, it's 18 seconds over a minute. The poem recently appeared in =
Peter Ganick's Experimetal-Experiential Literature. I liked the way it =
sounded when I recited it aloud, so I decided to make a video to try a =
few things  with it that I haven't done with my other videos.

Collage and Imagery by Marguerita Bornstein
Three-Dimensional Visual Art by Shawne Major

line of perfectbound books: /Soy solo palabras but wish to be a city/ by
León De la Rosa//Monolith/ by Anne McMillen, /My Hands Were Clean/ by
Tom Bradley//Dr. Gonzo/ by Deb Hoag, and our massive anthology,
/Unlikely Stories of the Third Kind/. The workload was fantastic, the
mini-tour of New Orleans, New York and Boston was wonderfully
inebriated, and not everything happened on time. Some folks are still
waiting on contributors' copies -- these continue to ship. We thank you
for your patience with our delays, both in the books and the web site.
But we're back and rolling now, so please send your submissions to the
web site and enjoy the great new stuff to see, watch, and read!

Much love,

              Ephemera Issue Subscriptions
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1

Dear Readers,

Thank you for following five years of LRL -- to celebrate, we have some
exciting announcements for our sixth issue: we will be holding an open
reading period for LRL e-editions, converting to a new (way more organized)
submission manager, as well as selling subscriptions for a new mail-out
(extremely limited) ephemera issue!!

OPEN READING PERIOD for LRL e-editions (http://littleredleaves.com/ebooks )
will be from January 15th - Feb 15th. Please send a chap or book length ms.
through the appropriate section of our new submission manager (
http://littleredleaves.submishmash.com/Submit)! Manuscripts selected for the
e-edition series will be available as both a free .pdf and in paperback
through lulu.com. Selected authors will be notified by late May 2011.

NEW SUBMISSION MANAGER: we will also be receiving all submissions to the
journal through submishmash from now on (rather than our insanely cluttered
gmail acct!). Please visit http://littleredleaves.submishmash.com/Submit and
our updated guidelines at http://littleredleaves.com/contact.html

EPHEMERA ISSUE SIX: for this issue we have enlisted the help of expert
ephemera artists Dawn Pendergast and Paul Klinger, who will hereby be
joining the LRL masthead! Miraculous and enthralling ephemera will be
constructed for each poem accepted and mailed out. We are asking for a
subscription donation of $30 for this extremely limited and gorgeously
produced edition. We are only offering 10 subscriptions, so please act
quickly. Subscriptions to the ephemera series can be purchased through the
LRL blog via paypal (http://littleredleavesjournal.blogspot.com). When the
ephemera series is complete, each item will be scanned in to comprise the

Squeezed a high chair

Between the narrow doorway

Of the bathroom to set

The fan on high, cooling

Me from the shower that

Does not dry, beady droplets

Forming a rash against

My forehead and chest,

Where talcum powder mixes

With sweat, to form a pasty

Amalgam not easy to wipe

Away.

Even so, it=92s ambitious

To put on makeup

My face nose-to-grid,

The fan=92s airflow

Rousing the humid

Lethargic air

Of this sizzling summer

Round this ecosphere

Casually cooling my face

With a balmy whiff of

Calm, extant for a

Flash.

=20

I dress for the party

And smile.

I really like the Fran Lebowitz quote--not surprising, coming from a =
writer w/the worst case of writer's block imaginable. But what about the =
poets? There's got to be some famous quote or 4 about poems made out of =
other poems. I just can't think of it.

I'll be reading at the Poetry Project with Lisa Robertson at 8pm on
Wednesday, January 19. I'll be reading from Contradicta: Aphorisms (Green
Integer, 2010). Toni Simon will be projecting new drawings of the collaged
illustrations she created for the book, plus other new work by her to
accompany recent Contradicta.

In all fairness, I didn't get mine recorded promptly, as I'm seriously ill,
though I was repeatedly (and kindly) urged and reminded. Trying to find a
quiet place to record -- my readings with husband and parrot screams in the
background have become more embarrassing than indicative or fun --

and aren't we all tired of hearing and making this excuse.

All best,

I have posted two short "sounding portraits" of Michael McClure and
Kythe Heller at:

http://www.quasha.com/axial-video/sounding-portraits

Basics:

1. *McClure (a sounding portrait)* (2 min. 8 sec.), second in a series
of "sounding portraits," presents poet Michael McClure performing a
poem, including animal sounds, and an Emily Dickinson poem reflective of
what poetry is. The recording was made on November 29th, 2007 at the
poet's home in Oakland, California.

2. *Kythe (a sounding portrait)* (3 min. 13 sec.),  first in a series of
"sounding portraits," presents poet Kythe Heller singing a Macedonian
song (originally as part of a speaking portrait session mainly for
"poetry is"). Kythe reports that she refused to learn the meaning of the
words so as not to reduce the direct power of the song. Recorded on
August 8th, 2010 in Barrytown, New York.

Right on, dude! Because focusing on equal representation of men and women in
the literary sphere DEFINITELY precludes an examination of equal
representation of all types of marginalized poets.

It has indeed been one of Raft's shortcomings that it's featured so few wom=
en. Almost all of the work published in the first two numbers was unsolicit=
ed. The truth is that I've received precious few submissions from women--in=
 all, about 15. I can't dismiss the idea that this might be in some ways my=
 fault, although it's by no means my design. I've been concerned about it r=
ight along.

So, since Amy has broken the ice, I'll use the opportunity to say that I re=
ally hope to receive a lot more work from women than I have so far. I'll be=
 very glad to see these numbers even out.

All best to all--

Thanks, Brian.  I like much of the work in Raft and would definitely like to see
more parity.  I think folks tend to submit where they think their work would be
welcome.   Just glancing at your table of contents alone (not that that is the
only deciding factor), I might make my way to another journal due to the lack of
women.


I realize men are much more active about submitting work than women.  The
reasons are speculative and vary (we talk about it here --
http://vidaweb.org/what-we-talk-about-when-were-talking-about-the-count ).  My
solution as an editor is to simply solicit more women.  Plenty of great work out
there, so I have no problem finding women whose work I like.  It often just
takes a little nudge:  an invitation.


Best,

Amy

It has indeed been one of Raft's shortcomings that it's featured so few women.
Almost all of the work published in the first two numbers was unsolicited. The
truth is that I've received precious few submissions from women--in all, about
15. I can't dismiss the idea that this might be in some ways my fault, although
it's by no means my design. I've been concerned about it right along.

So, since Amy has broken the ice, I'll use the opportunity to say that I really
hope to receive a lot more work from women than I have so far. I'll be very glad
to see these numbers even out.

All best to all--

Elizabeth,

Sarcasm. See James Watt, Reagan's Interior Secretary:

A public controversy erupted after a speech to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce by
Watt in September 1983, when he mocked affirmative action by saying about a
coal-leasing panel: "I have a black, a woman, two Jews and a cripple. And we
have talent."[21] Within weeks of making this statement, Watt submitted his
resignation letter.[21][22]

Hi Susan,

Maybe you could approach publishers of poetry books that you like or that p=
ublish work similar to yours. =20

As for me, I am not a publisher, but for query letters posted to lists (suc=
h as this), it is helpful if you send a sample poem or poems, along with an=
 artist statement or bio.  Maybe a link to your work or webpage?

From your post, I know nothing of your poems, style, who you are or what yo=
u are up to. =20

Take care,


Millicent=20

Heading into the new year, Post Apollo Press is about to release my first
book:
"There Are People Who Think That Painters Shouldn't Talk" : A GUSTONBOOK

The press has delightfully posted a discussion between Will Yackulic and
myself:
http://postapollopress.blogspot.com/

Thanks to Lindsey Boldt! for laying out the blogpost.

The book is expected to be out by the end of the month, and will be
available directly from Post Apollo as well from SPD. Copies may be
available during AWP @ the SPD table... Anybody interested in Guston and/or
relations between painters and poets, please check it out!

cheers,

It's clear you were attempting to use sarcasm, Paul.  Elizabeth gets that.  What
you obviously don't get is her issue.  Think about it.

acknowledged, let me revise my previous statement:

I'm a poet with a disability. We're not here to be used as part of a
sarcastic rhetorical point that takes no account of us as human beings.

What denunciation?  Pointing out the obvious?  You assume incorrectly and
without justification.



Sarah, clearly you are having some issue with thinking I haven't invited you to
read in a series I no longer run.  Perhaps you should take your own advice and
backchannel.

I don't gauge male or female contributors when I submit my work. I just
submit.

I have to assume the Raft editor was contacted privately before the public
denunciation.

I agree about lack of parity, but once I started pushing, five or so years ago,

Amy,

I guess my age is showing. I thought everyone would see that it was a quite from
Ronald Reagan's Secretary of the Interior, James Watt. Nope. My mistake.

I don't think Brian Seabolt and Raft are attempting to exclude women, as is the
implication from your email. He's already explained the circumstance and one
well-regarded poet (who happens to be a woman) has chimed in.


It is all too easy to paint someone as racist, sexist, homophobic, intolerant,
&c. As poets, unless these things are quite obvious, we should have some
tolerance for other poets in this community. I did not see your email, Amy, in
the spirit of community, perhaps I did not read your intent properly, but I
thought humor would illustrate my point that affirmative action should have no
place in art.


"Cripple" was James Watt's word and I think other words express my own ideas
best in that matter. Like yesterday when I emceed a celebration of Martin Luther
King and edited Wanda Coleman's poem to take out a certain word. I also edited
Dr.King's words, taking out his use of the word "Negro." The folks there, not
poets, would probably not see either word in the spirit it was offered, but I
expected more from poets and despite the events of the last two days, will
continue to do so.

Elizabeth,

Sarcasm. See James Watt, Reagan's Interior Secretary:

A public controversy erupted after a speech to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce by
Watt in September 1983, when he mocked affirmative action by saying about a
coal-leasing panel: "I have a black, a woman, two Jews and a cripple. And we
have talent."[21] Within weeks of making this statement, Watt submitted his
resignation letter.[21][22]

I counted and posted the gender breakdown without any context.  You read those

I didn't get the sarcasm so much as  I got the historical reference.
Granted, it had to be explained, since I don't remember much about Reagan
unless it deals with his Latin American policies, but I get it. I think.

Amy,

Good point. However, as someone who has read your posts and those you link
to about number issues and gender breakdowns in poetry publications, the
context is pretty clear.

That said, I think what you're doing is necessary, and certainly necessary
to point out. I celebrate this as an issue, in fact, since it has made me
more aware of the inadequacy of exclusion, which is exactly what it is.

A more flagrant example: a few months ago Vice Magazine released its version
of who's who in new fiction. There was ONE woman, the rest (around 15,
20...) were men. This cannot be at all what reality looks like.

Admitting our ignorance is constructive, so it's worth mentioning here that
I would have never noticed this harsh discrepancy had I not read your posts
and links about it.

-Ryan

Dear friends,


  Just a brief note to let you know about an important reading at =
Acequia Booksellers this weekend. On Sunday January 23 at 3pm, we are =
pleased to present renowned poets Jonathan Skinner and Mei-mei =
Berssenbrugge. This reading is free, so tell all your friends. Don't =

  Jonathan Skinner's poetry collections include Birds of Tifft =
(BlazeVox, 2011), Warblers (Albion Books, 2010), With Naked Foot (Little =
Scratch Pad Press, 2009) and Political Cactus Poems (Palm Press, 2005). =
He founded and edits the journal ecopoetics (www.ecopoetics.org), which =
features creative-critical intersections between writing and ecology. =
Skinner also writes ecocriticism on contemporary poetry and poetics: his =
essays on the poets Ronald Johnson and Lorine Niedecker appeared in =
volumes published by the National Poetry Foundation and by University of =
Iowa Press. His essay "Thoughts on Things: Poetics of the Third =
Landscape" appeared recently in the Ecolanguage Reader (ed. Brenda =
Iijima). Skinner teaches in the Environmental Studies Program at Bates =
College, in Central Maine, where he makes his home.  She currently sits =
on the contributing editorial board of the literary journal =
Conjunctions.


  Mei-mei Berssenbrugge was born in Beijing and grew up in =
Massachusetts.  She is the author of twelve books of poetry.  Her =
selected poems, I Love Artists, was published by the University of =
California Press in 2006.  Concordance, a collaboration with artist Kiki =
Smith, originally produced as an artist's book by the Brodsky Center of =
Rutgers University is recently published by Kelsey Street Press. She is =
the recipient of two American Book Awards, and sits on the Contributing =
Editorial Board of Conjunctions Journal. She lives in Abiquiu, New =
Mexico and in New York City.

MODES OF LOVE AND REASON: A BERNADETTE MAYER SYMPOSIUM

The University at Buffalo Poetics Program invites scholarly submissions
for a critical panel to take place as part of a one-day symposium on the
work of Bernadette Mayer. This long-overdue celebration of Mayer’s life
and work will consist in equal measures of devoted fandom and rigorous
study of Mayer’s work -- of “love” and “reason” -- and will be held in
the Poetry Collection at Buffalo on April 1, 2011. The symposium is
planned to coincide with Mayer's visit to Buffalo for the University's
Poetics Plus series, and its finale will be a reading by Mayer herself
in downtown Buffalo that night. Paper topics may include, but are not
limited to: Mayer and the New York school; Mayer and the visual arts;
Mayer and gender; poetic form in Mayer’s work; Mayer and American
regionalism; Mayer and Conceptual writing; and Mayer and small-press
print culture.

The deadline for submissions is March 1, 2011, to Joey Yearous-Algozin,
at <jfyearousalg@gmail.com>. Respondents will be notified within a week.

Xerolage 48 - Poemics (POEtry + coMICS) by Poemic Blog

http://xexoxial.org/is/xerolage48/by/poemic_blog

New work by Potr Szreniawski, Mateusz Suchecki, Nelle Hannes, Rosaire
Appel, Satu Kaikkonen, Jonny Gray & Sven Staelens.

from the intro:

There are many definitions of poemics. Poemics can be understood as an
art combining elements of poetry and comics, the space between poetry
and comics, or a place where poetry and comics meet. Sometime poemics
are classified as visual poetry, sometimes as experi- mental comics,
and sometimes as both. We think poemics can be a great way of
expression, perhaps that is why we create them.

---

    Spoken Image: Speech Balloons in Poemics is where rigamarollers
crunch amid the awkward bones of half-eaten word burgers! Pszren and
crew fill bellies with poemics as knobby as the carapace of expired
foie gras and as delicious as the misdeeds of mammy! Seconds please.
    =97Andy Martrich

    The Poemics issue of Xerolage 48 features work by Piotr
Szreniawski, Satu Kaikkonen, sven staelens, Mateusz Suchecki, Nele
Hannes, Rosaire Appel, and Jonny Gray. The introduction by Piotr
Szreniawski says "Poemics can be understood as an art combining
elements of poetry and comics, the space between poetry and comics, or
a place where poetry and comics meet."

    The work in Xerolage 48 indeed looks both like visual poetry and
comics. Panels and 'thought bubbles' are present, but they're
typically not driving a storyful narrative as a more poetical
exploration of language or epiphany or philosophical inquiry or
presentation of thoughts on poetics.

    There's some thoughtful, provocative work here. For instance,
there's a piece by Jonny Gray called EXCESS that includes this text:
"He said that what gets left off is central to the design. Absence is
usually more important than presence. Talk is cheap." The panels are
silhouettes of ripped male torsos. With schematic diagrams overlayed
in the white areas. I'm trying to lose some weight at the mo. Ya my
design is to leave some of that stuff off.

    And there's a piece by Satu Kaikkonen called co'nnec ti'on that
consists of linked thought bubbles. and the things in the thought
bubbles are, themselves, sometimes linked to some of the other thought
bubbles or things in thought bubbles.
    =97Jim Andrews

    New hybrids arrive because a need for dual expression exists that
requires attention. In this case, visual poetry and comics have
decided to merge into a group of artists calling their hybrid =96
POEMICS. The entirety of purpose here is housed in the speech balloon
and how it lives in any given situation. More specifically, in this
sampler of POEMICS, the speech balloon is placed amidst signage and
symbol, alphabet and phoneme. Speech is, of course, intimated by the
balloon, but what utterance ensues is a quirky mirror of visual
thought.  You see what could be said about seeing, and the content of
that utterance is revealed by the image itself. There have been
several forays into POEMICS in the past, but this latest incarnation
seems more vibrant and cohesive. We hope its legs are strong, and we
see even more work soon.
    =97Nico Vassilakis



The primary investigation of Xerolage is how collage technique of 20th
century art, typography, computer graphics, visual & concrete poetry
movements & the art of the copier have been combined. Each issue is
devoted to the work of one artist.

I wonder if her husband actually says that ("You're being a bit neurotic")
or if that's just another canned male stereotype in print.

As I mentioned before, I now notice how lopsided gender representation is i=
n
most magazines. I'll also reiterate that this was something that didn't
often come to mind, and that was pointed out to me -- a revelation I'm
grateful for -- by reading "Numbers Trouble" and Amy's posts. I'll admit
that my first reaction was disbelief, perhaps because I'd like to think tha=
t
actions and communities I devote my time to possess virtue. Part of this
virtue is the ability to "check yourself."

We need a Bechdel
Test<http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBechdelTest> for
print and online publications.

I don't like admitting that this was not something on my radar. I wish I
were post-feminist and this and other realizations proves the truism that
just because you don't see it doesn't means it's not there. A struggle,
unlike a fight, is continuous; longevity is implied. There will always be
those who feel that things have gone to far and who seek to roll them back.
One day, it might be commercial suicide to publish only men, but this hasn'=
t
happened yet. The problem isn't just numbers, it's the internalization that
"only men do ____." As cultural artifacts, these publications only reveal
via exclusion what less astute readers might not notice: why aren't women
writers/published? Or even more pressing, why aren't more women published i=
n
the publications that we think matter?

of all of the non-trivial books on ED.  Actually, her poems as she wrote
them are good enough for me.  The rest of course is dross.

"The emergence of computer technology has further given the photographer the
opportunity to be more and more creative with photographs as modes of
speaking. These days when it is possible for a photographer to excise the
bust of a public figure and superimpose it on the body of a donkey, or to
clean up an image of a face terribly ruined by chicken pox, is the rhetoric
of the photographic image indeed not some cheese for someone's bite?"

George, and others Please check Mr. Morse's blog to see where the
"trivial" request came from.  He reviewed a book on ED and pronounced
it trivial and suggested that there was a plethora of other trivial
books on ED out there (without mentioning any titles).  I'd also like
to see a list of non-trivial ED books as well, and I'll start the list
off with an old teacher of mine: Sharon Cameron's "Lyric Time"--which
is one of the best discussions of ED's poetics that I've ever come
across. Interestingly enough, Susan Howe's "My Emily Dickinson" came
out soon after and the rigour of Cameron's thought and analysis puts
Susan Howe's attempt to shame. Jess

Jesse,

I liked Susan Howe's "My ED"!  I will have to take a look at Cameron's
book.  Thanks.

I know that Cris will welcome a discussion about his prosody; his point
about pitch made me remember my old focus on the VU Meter.

http://jacketmagazine.com/40/r-daly-vauxhall-rb-cooley.shtml

If you haven't read Catherine Daly's work, I hope this little essay gives
you the impetus. If you have, you know what I mean. This extraordinary poet
"has somehow found a pathway through the maze of modern life, in her work
and in her poetry. She seems a kind of oracle of the new: she is not afraid
of Rite Aid; she is devoid of lessons, which gives her voice frightful
clarity and shows us a bit of the world=92s chaos and meaninglessness with =
no
hint of despair."


Thanks,
Catherine Daly

Jesse=2C

Do you mean that Cameron's book is better as lit crit?  That is a 'genre=2C=
' I believe=2C that Howe was deliberately trying NOT to write in.  And that=
 is one of the things that remains interesting about her book=97 that it is=
 not just another 'critical discussion' of a 'major poet.'  It's more livel=
y.  It is poetics=97 thinking inside writing: one poet writing about anothe=
r poet (c.f. Call Me Ishmael=2C The HD Book=2C Bottom: On Shakespeare=2C es=
says by Creeley=2C Williams=2C Stein=2C etc.=2C etc.).

I personally feel=2C after all these years=2C that Howe's book is pretty gr=
eat.  And I do not say that lightly.

So=2C are you saying that Cameron's book is AMAZING?  And if so=2C where ca=

Later, awkwarder, stickier, and number-sixier than ever before, the new
issue of *Abraham Lincoln* wants desperately to be held tight to your
heaving thoraxes (thoraces?) as you get so excited by the poems it contains
that you gnaw the staples out WITH YOUR TEETH and commence slobbering at the
moon. Can you afford NOT to throw away your hard-earned shekels on this
splendid rag?

(sorry)=2C as an aesthetic construct=2C it=92s not something I=92m normally=

For the rough patches.  As that I goes=2C so does this one=2C and that one=
=2C and point is=2C the
experience of hearing it sticks to you. =20
Which is somehow leading me to formulate another call for
work and subscriptions to Eccolinguistics at eccolinguistics.blogspot.com=

pasted here.  Thank you to everyone
sending work and writing in.  Still lots

Two fine poets and one worthy of encouragement were chosen and introduced
by Jack Foley. Price: $15.00 from Small Press Distribution.

Contributors:

Mary-Marcia Casoly--a new name and a writer with an eye for the exotic:
her series on Australia is wonderful.

Katherine Hastings--whose exploration of myth and the long poem is very
fine.

Jack Foley--a long-time poet/performer and essayists on things literary
in the Bay area.

Melanie Lynn Moro-Huber--a poet whose work shows promise.

Enjoy!  Jess of Japan, the original Ahadada, whose opinions are--of
course--his own.

Blazevox recently released Millie Niss's City Bird: Selected Poems
(1991-2009) edited by Martha Deed. Although Millie was perhaps best
known for her web-based work, she was an early contributor to such
online journals as Beehive and Muse Apprentice Guild. Many of those
works can be seen again in City Bird.

Millie Niss draws from so many different poetic influences and writes in
so many different tones – wistful, sneaky, sincere, outraged,
outrageous, sweet and funny and snide – that it makes me nearly dizzy.
This is a wonderful, whimsical compendium of a mind on fire, devoted to
poetry, mad for malarkey. In rants, e-mails, poetic forms,
collaborations, school notebooks, mock epics, found text, imitations,
concrete poetry and intercepted letters, Millie calls it like it is and
we are so lucky for it! -- Kazim Ali

City Bird is available from the editor, Blazevox, Talking Leaves (Indie
bookstore in Buffalo, NY), and Amazon.

To celebrate the publication of her work, Just Buffalo Literary Center
is holding a "Big Night for Millie Niss"

scenes) -- will also be shown.

Martha, I'm thrilled to be able to buy a copy of Millie's book online. From
Geoffrey's press. He who cooked such a delicious meal for a bunch of us in
Buffalo at the first e-poetry conference where I first met Millie. And hey
Geoffrey way to go with the online paypal thing. It was very simple and
quick to purchase the book.

So did you include the one about the horse, Martha? I thought that was such
a great piece. Horse Fuck Rock, I believe it was called. I am really looking
forward to the book, Martha and Geoffrey. Many thanks. Wish I wasn't a few
thousand miles away from the evening for Millie.

All the best,
ja

Yes, Susan Howe explained that to me in person by saying: But it's MY
Emily Dickinson!  She gave a presentation on her book at Marquette
university and when she started explaining in a slide show how certain
word groupings in the original manuscripts looked like clouds, etc.,
some of the English profs in the back almost threw up.  She also had a
hard time explaining why Thomas Johnson's regularization of ED's
punctuation was harmful and sexist to boot, as it actually allows one to
begin to begin a reading of ED's poems.

I'd just gotten through the seminar with Ms. Cameron and Susan Howe
reminded me of the classmate who'd attempted to make a case for ED's
poetics being an early example of Olson's "projective verse" and
being reduced to tears by Cameron's "words like blades".

I really don't accept your categories: Howe attempts her own
interpretation of the poems (weak as it is) and expects us to take her
seriously, no?  Why should anyone coming to Howe's book expect anything
less than what they would find in Cameron's--who also offers an
interpretation of ED's work.

Lyric Time is from Johns Hopkins University press and it IS amazing.

SLIDVID 3.0
http://netartery.vispo.com/?p=789

Here's an article I wrote about a JavaScript slideshow program I've been
developing called Slidvid. I just finished version 3.0 of this software, and
it's gotten to the point where it is fairly easy to configure and use by
other people, so I thought I'd write some documentation about the software.
If you would like to show your graphics in a slideshow on your site, drop me
a line.

The article links to a slideshow of photos I took when I was recently in
your head. I was looking at your language. You were humming, doing the
dishes. The images are song shapes.

Janet Holmes
The ms of my kin

is a fascinating erasure of the poems of Emily Dickinson. It reminds me of
Susan Howe's work in that both really internalize Dickinson's poetry and

            This is my collaboration with artist Nobuho Nagasawa for the
            recently completed Soto Station on the Los Angeles Metro
            Goldline located in the heart of Boyle Heights. I
            contributed "wall preverbs" as huge inscriptions on subway
            walls to her public-art sculptural installation:

            one*definition of "preverb" is: a one-line intentional act
            of language that invites configurative reading to become a
            singular event of meaning*

On behalve of Eddie woods
--Andreas Maria Jacobs

Dear Friends,

Early this morning the murderously barbaric Iranian regime hanged my friend,
and my friend Jane?s friend, Zahra Bahrami. Her crime? To be in the wrong
place at the wrong time. Even though the (ugh!) Islamic Republic of Iran
would like for the world to believe otherwise. Zahra was 46 years old and a
dual Dutch-Iranian national. Only the Iranian government refused to
recognize her Dutch citizenship and therefore consistently denied Dutch
consular officials in Tehran any access to her. And today they killed her.

Zahra, formerly a student of Indian classical music at the Rotterdam
Conservatory and a professional belly dancer, had traveled to Iran more than
a year ago to be with her daughter, who was undergoing chemotherapy.
Foolishly perhaps, she (like thousands of others) participated in one of the
Ashura demonstrations that were held on December 27th 2009 to protest the
disputed presidential elections in June. Zahra, who has never belonged to
any political organization (contrary to another false claim being made by
the regime), was arrested and kept in solitary confinement until the moment
of her death. During the entire time she was repeatedly beaten and tortured.
And was once forced to make a public confession, which she later retracted.
A few months ago her Iranian lawyer, a lady well in the regime?s sights for
handling other human-rights cases, was also imprisoned. While just the other
day the Dutch foreign ministry appointed two attorneys from the Netherlands
to ?represent? Zahra, a much-belated move that may well have sealed her
fate. For Zahra had first been tried and sentenced to die not on the
political charges (that trial was still meant to happen) but for possessing,
smuggling and selling narcotics. Drugs which had clearly been planted (as
though they would need to plant them: they could simply say she had them and
that would be that). Zahra did not even use drugs, any drugs, and was
certainly not a smuggler. But by trying her for this, the Iranian regime
hoped (successfully, it appears) to blindside Western governments, and the
Dutch in particular, as to their real motivations by saying this was all
part of a ?war on drugs.?

TEHRAN [says]...it is holding a Dutch-Iranian woman caught with drugs, state
news agency IRNA reported, after the Netherlands sought details about a dual
citizen reportedly on death row...
      ?One of the cases that Western countries use to pressure the Islamic
republic is the case of a woman named Zahra Bahrami, who holds European
passports as well as an Iranian passport,? Iranian foreign ministry
spokesman Ramin Mehmanparast said, quoted by IRNA.
      ?(Bahrami) has been arrested by the police for carrying over 1kg of
narcotics,? Mr Mehmanparast said without elaborating on the sentence or her
nationality.
      He dismissed foreign interference in the case, in comments apparently
aimed at the Netherlands which sought clarification...about a Dutch-Iranian
woman in her 40s reportedly sentenced to death.
      ?They are not allowed to interfere in our internal affairs and our
judiciary is quite independent,? said Mr Mehmanparast. AFP

And further: ?It is expected from the western countries to appreciate Iran's
efforts to combat drug trafficking and even cooperate accordingly,? he said.
      ?Unfortunately, however, we are witnessing their support for Zahra
Bahrami and they have even called for her release,? he added.
      ?The West should realize that if the issue of combating drug
trafficking is not taken seriously, it will directly affect their own youth
who will be entrapped by drug traffickers,? the Foreign Ministry spokesman
said. HSH/MMN

I have lived in Iran. And twice worked there as a journalist. That was when
the Shah was in charge. The same Shah who had a rather nasty secret police
force called SAVAK. (But hey, aren?t all secret police everywhere nasty?
They damn sure are!) Yet unless you were actively involved in trying to
overthrow the Shah, SAVAK pretty much (well...) left you alone. The bastards
running the show in Iran nowadays don?t leave anyone alone. They call
themselves ?men of God? but they are evil through and through. Quite as the
Ayatollah Khomeini was evil. I shall write more about Iran and my extended
stays there in due course. And about the Shah. At present suffice it to say
that the power-wielding mullahs and their traitorous (to the Iranian people)
cohorts must go. As for how to get rid of them, I do not know. Except that
it must come from within. As it came from within in Tunisia and is coming
from within in Egypt. And hopefully will come from within in numerous other
nations ruled by equally brutal and corrupt regimes.

Capital punishment is abhorrent, period. And to say it is more abhorrent in
Zahra?s case is missing the point. Zahra?s case is a tragedy because she
never should have been arrested, should not have been imprisoned, ought not
to have been tortured, and certainly not sentenced to death and hanged. But
Zahra is not alone. Iran executes people day in and day out. As does China.
As does the bloody United States. And too many other countries. In the
European Union it is banned. Even Russia abolished the death penalty. The
rest must follow suit. Without any exceptions and in all circumstances. It
is wrong. It would have been wrong for Hitler (how guilty can you get!), it
was wrong for Eichmann (banality incarnate), and it sure as hell was wrong
for Zahra Bahrami. Who also happened to be innocent. And thus becomes a kind
of martyr. For Iran. For her people.

Oh yes, I have actually witnessed an execution. A public execution. By
firing squad. In Thailand. More on that, too. Anon.

To find out more about Zahra, you can google her name. Dozens and dozens of
links will pop up. (On her Dutch passport the first name was spelt Sahra,
which is what the BBC is using.) Her surname had been Mehrabi, until the
Dutch government allowed her to change it. That when Zahra proved to their
satisfaction that she was on an Iranian death list. Her brother was executed
for having a photograph of the Shah in his possession! Her elder daughter
committed suicide. She is survived by a younger daughter and a 22-year old
son.

RIP Zahra Bahrami. What a terrible way to die. At the blood-stained hands of
a horrible regime that is as close to pure evil as any regime possibly can
get.

Thank you for reading this, EDDIE

some of you may have seen this front-page article in the NY Times:


http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/31/business/media/31link.html?_r=2&hp

As the article points out, because of the absence of women contributors,
subjects about women, or of interest to women, are severely scanted.  It's
pretty shocking, especially when you consider what a standard reference
wikipedia is becoming.  It occurs to me that many of this list are not only
writers but have lots of literary and scholarly expertise --
