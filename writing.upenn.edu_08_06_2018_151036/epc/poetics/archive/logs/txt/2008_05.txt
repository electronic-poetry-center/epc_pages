Fascinating drug, LSD.  I only had, or made, the occasion to
"do/consume" it twice, myself, and both "trips" clean, comfortable,
relaxed, "good," quite fun and entertaining. =20

=20

Naw, didn't "see God" or otherwise experience anything profoundly
"mystical" and "transformational" (I think ya have to be inclined to
have/harbor belief systems that would lead ya to "unconsciously" Desire
to experience such things, and I was/am a bit too "rational,"
"scientific," and "atheist" to be inclined that way).  Were really neat
and fun experiences, considerably more "intense" than the mushrooms
abundant in central Florida back at that time, but in any case Thank You
to Mr. Hofmann for making those two occasions possible.

=20

He represents a wonderful combination of "soul," "heart," and "mind" - a
scientist for all seasons, including poetic ones.  Okay, maybe that's a
little "sappy," and what do I really know, just a 70's generation
neo-hippy still idealizing those from the 50's and 60's...

Last year, Les Figues Press, i.e Press, and 1913 all had presences here...
booths are free, but as you can see, will be scarcer.


 Dear Booksellers and Friends,

We hope this email finds you well.  Please find attached the vendor form an=
d
contract for the Third Annual San Diego City College International Book
Fair.  The vending area of this year's fair will again be held on the San
Diego City College campus from 10:00 AM to 5:00 PM on Saturday, October 4th=
,
2008, and it will be bigger and better than last year's.  Saturday's
exciting line-up features Carolyn Forche, Li-Young Lee, Thomas Frank, Helen=
a
Viramontes, Paul Rieckhoff, Robert Hine with Mike Davis, Reyna Grande, and
many more.  We have leads on a couple of big name writers who might be adde=
d
soon=97check our website at www.sdcitybookfair.com for updates later on in =
the
summer!

Once again, we are proud to be able to offer a limited number of vending
booths free of charge due, in part, to our partnership with the San Diego
Booksellers Association.  However, this year, because of recession-related
budget cut-backs, we lost a couple of our bigger sponsors.  Therefore, in
order to maintain the quality of the program and to keep building the Fair,
we've had to reduce the number of vending booths to 24.  *San Diego Book
Sellers Association members and other Book Fair sponsors have priority and
booths will be allotted on a first-come, first-serve basis.*  *It's
important that you return your contracts well before the June 2nd deadline
so that you don't get shut out of this year's fair!
*
This year's fair will be widely advertised in the San Diego *CityBeat*, the
San Diego *Reader*, the San Diego *Union-Tribune*, KPBS,  KSDS Jazz 88.3,
and elsewhere.  As soon as posters and cards are available in July, I will
let everyone know so you can help get the word out.

To ensure your free booth, please fill out and return the enclosed contract
by *June 2nd, 2008* to:
*Jim Miller, San Diego City College, 1313 Park Boulevard, San Diego, CA,
92101.
*
Since booths will be at a premium, please do not reserve a booth unless you
are certain that you will attend the fair.  Every no show costs the fair
$100 per booth which takes away money for increased advertising which will
bring you all more customers.

For those of you unfamiliar with San Diego City College, please see this
link for a more complete map than the one on our website:
http://www.sdcity.edu/FAQ/directions.asp  All the other logistical details
are covered in the attached vendor contract.   If you have any further
questions, feel free to reply to this email or email my assistant, Wendy
Castellanos, at wcastell@sdccd.edu or the Assistant Director, Kelly Mayhew,
at kmayhew@sdccd.edu

Thank you for your continued participation in our fair,

Jim Miller, Director
San Diego City College International Book Fair and Literary Center

action.

staff and
researchers linking creative writing with environmental issues on climate
change. The
specific content and structure of this programme will be a basis of

as workshops,
public readings and seminars.

The award is 2 days per week for 9 months (October =AD June) and it is =A38,000
plus up to
=A31,000 for expenses. The Environment Institute will provide office space as
required during
this period.=20

to Ms
Marianne Knight, UCLEI, Pearson Building, Gower Street, London, WC1E 6BT or

following: a brief CV,
giving details of recent publications, readings and/or broadcasts and any
experience of
teaching creative writing, as well as a proposed programme of work.

I recently wrote regarding the Wolf magazine in London, and thought of you
again today when I heard from my department at UCL about a post that has
opened up. It's a writer-in-residence post sponsored by the UCL Environment
Institute and the English department. I've attached the advert, in case you
are interested or if you know someone who would like to apply.

People made poems to remember their stories and ideas. Sound is an essential element of words. Some words are just delightful to say aloud or see on the page."

Home page overhaul:

http://vispo.com/index.html
http://vispo.com/index2.html
http://vispo.com/index3.html
http://vispo.com/index4.html

the first of the above urls is what you see when you go to http://vispo.com
. the other of the above urls are reachable by clicking either the numbers
at bottom right of the graphic table at http://vispo.com or by clicking the
VispO logo repeatedly.

the backgrounds are from the dbCinema project.

if you're on a pc, note that the F11 key should toggle Fullscreen viewing
(that's a browser thang). i usually use the Opera browser to view net art
because its version of Fullscreen gets rid of every single pixel of the
browser. ie used to be that way. but their fullscreen mode now includes
browser chrome. i read the other day that the main writer of the sopranos
says he hates almost every single minute of television as corporate
propaganda for the state. i hate every pixel of the browser that encroaches
into my art space.

the main nav principle on vispo.com is this: to go home, click the VispO
logo. the home page lets you nav the site in a variety of ways: search; full
site menu; "highlighted" projects; and by graphic table.

i used to use javascript to put textual descriptions of projects in the
status bar. and i used the 'alt' property in the image tag. but those only
works in ie. so i ditched those and, instead, now provide brief textual
descriptions of projects in the main window itself via mouseover of the
graphic table and any other links.

on most pages on vispo.com, i try to focus attention. i center things
horizontally and vertically. blogs are often very info overload with a
million things on the page.

in early versions of my site, there was constantly a nav menu on the left,
wherever you were on the site. i ditched that years ago because usually i
want the whole window for composition.

BODY {
  background-color=#000000;
  background-image: url(dbcinema/saint/47.jpg);
  background-attachment:fixed;
  background-repeat:no-repeat;
  background-position: center center;
  }

the above code is used on the homepages. this centers the background image
and makes it so that only one copy appears on the page. when the browser is
resized, the background image retains its position relative to the other
stuff on the page; all is centered.

i wrote a bit of javascript to change the opacity of images in the graphic
table on mouseover. wee bit of interactivity, together with the text
messages on mouseover.

the above pages are all html/css/javascript. by the way, there's a terrific
css tutorial at http://www.w3schools.com/Css . i find this w3schools.com
site very useful for html/css/javascript learning. for instance, i looked at
http://www.w3schools.com/Css/css_image_transparency.asp for the opacity
stuff.

the homepages are designed so that they look good and function on all
browsers at all resolutions of 800x600 and larger and whatever the browser
window size is.

http://web.archive.org/web/*/http://vispo.com shows the dev of the vispo.com
homepage since 1999. the site has been around for longer than that. before i
bought the vispo.com domain, the site's url was speakeasy.org/~jandrews and,
before that, islandnet.com/~jandrews going back to 1995. the dev of the
homepage has mostly been incremental over 13 years.

i try to use the whole screen, however big the space i have is. i don't
think net art should settle for being 'content' in a space dominated by
other stuff.

Lesbos islanders dispute gay name
By Malcolm Brabant
BBC News, Athens

http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7376919.stm

The term lesbian is now widely used to describe homosexual women

Campaigners on the Greek island of Lesbos are to go to court in an
attempt to stop a gay rights organisation from using the term "lesbian".

The islanders say that if they are successful they may then start to
fight the word lesbian internationally.

The issue boils down to who has the right to call themselves Lesbians.

Is it gay women, or the 100,000 people living on Greece's third
biggest island - plus another 250,000 expatriates who originate from
Lesbos?

The man spearheading the case, publisher Dimitris Lambrou, claims that
international dominance of the word in its sexual context violates the
human rights of the islanders, and disgraces them around the world.

He says it causes daily problems to the social life of Lesbos's
inhabitants.

Injunction sought

In court papers, the plaintiffs allege that the Greek government is so
embarrassed by the term Lesbian that it has been forced to rename the
island after its capital, Mytilini.
map of Lesbos

An early court date has now been set for judges to decide whether to
grant an injunction against the Homosexual and Lesbian Community of
Greece and to order it to change its name.

A spokeswoman for the group has described the case as a groundless
violation of freedom of expression, and has pledged to fight it.

The term lesbian originated from a mythological goddess and poet
called Sappho, who was a native of Lesbos.

Sappho expressed her love of other women in poetry written during the
7th Century BC.

But according to Mr Lambrou, new historical research has discovered
that Sappho had a family, and committed suicide for the love of a man.

Not only that, but "Lesbian" is used as both a noun and an adjective, =
which is confusing. I mean, which is it? It can't be both. I'd like to =
initiate a class action lawsuit to have one of these functions =
eliminated.

Poetry-in-Motion - the Bush/Cheney Collective Paralysis Machine is Not Entirely Omnipresent/pervasive. A bit of America is still breathing on one of its edges! Go dockworkers. Hope there is a poet or two among you! To wit:


 Thousands of dockworkers at West Coast ports stayed off the job on Thursday in what their union said was a call for an end to the war in Iraq.
        The International Longshore and Warehouse Union said more than 25,000 members in 29 ports stayed off the job. The action came despite an order issued Wednesday by an arbitrator directing the union to tell its members to report for work as usual in response to a request from employers.
 “Longshore workers are standing down on the job and standing up for America,” Bob McEllrath, the union’s president, said in a statement. “We’re supporting the troops and telling politicians in Washington that it’s time to end the war in Iraq.”
 The scene at most West Coast ports was quiet, without any scuffles or confrontations. The cranes used to unload container ships stood idle and few trucks were lined up outside gates.
 Guillermo Durell, 45, a truck driver, was at the Los Angeles-area port of Long Beach. “I got up at 6 a.m. to drop a load off,” he said. “When I got here the security guard said ‘Drop this, but that’s it. We’re all leaving.’ ”
  Mr. McEllrath said the walkout was not ordered by the union’s leadership, but was the result of a “democratic decision” made by the rank and file in February to demonstrate on May 1, a traditional day for labor activism.
  He said employers were notified in advance of the plan, but refused to accommodate the union’s request, instead seeking the arbitrator’s ruling.
  The longshore union and other labor groups are planning marches and rallies in various cities along the West Coast, and authorities in some location warned that these activities could snarl traffic during the evening commute.
  Rebecca Cathcart contributed reporting from Long Beach, Calif.

Oh did she? I couldn't remember the end. Why is my name so disgraced? I will
have to follow the same destiny. I should take Tolstoj to court, yes, that
is what I will probably do.

Button (Tsunami Editions, 1992; reissued online by the haute bourgeois /ubu
editions). Nada Gordon is the author of four poetry books: Folly, V. Imp.,

Crap. I lived on the isle of Lesbos.  Tis too gorgeous to be in want of
anything, including a man.  The thalassa (sea) shines and the fish are
plentiful. Women committing suicide over men, when they could fish for fi=
sh
and cook them with fresh olives?  Even Plath didn't kill herself over a m=
an.
That's a warped interpretation.  I'm totally suspect.

When I read the initial post in this series this morning, I found myself la=

ld have been invented by some=A0updated version of the Marx Brothers.=A0 Wh=
y can't the people of this island just call themselves Greeks and stop tryi=
ng=A0to fight further a worldwide appellation they will never be able to ch=

s thought she was just an ordinary human being.=A0 Admittedtly, an extraord=
inary poet, but still human. Regards, Tom Savage

 It's important to express how we're feeling.  Some poets have asked why I'm
wasting my time writing to the Buffalo List about the war if most readers
(if not all?) already feel similarly about the war.

I've recently met YET ANOTHER person who knows of US military service men
and women who, after serving their time in Iraq come back to the states,
only to LOSE THEIR MINDS living amongst us when seeing how we do NOT address
the war everyday, do NOT want to address it, and leave us to be citizens of
other counties (mainly Germany).

It's so weird when you think about our expatriates with THIS war being our
own military.  Usually it's artists who leave us in a huff, but we have many
angry military people, angry at you and me, and leave confused and damaged,
forever.

A good friend working in Public Health has told me that ALL of her peers and
especially her teachers and supervisors are stating that never before have
they seen as many cases of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder from patients.
Patients not in the war, but citizens like you and me.  What my friend is
saying is that the disorder is (in many opinions) from our living with the
stress of guilt inside the belly of a system which wants us to deny what is
going on.  There are not enough comfort foods in the world that Martha
Stewart can whip up for us apparently.

We're under the weight here.  We don't even understand how much pressure
we're under.  I DO NOT understand it at all, but feel it, and want it to be
understood.  MANY of you have written to me via back channel since my last
post.  Some supportive, and agreeing, others angry.

To the angry, especially to the angry, saying to me that I should spend my
time working to stop the war.  Apparently you didn't read my post entirely.
I ALREADY said that we've been marching, writing letters, DOING many things,
many creative things to try to end the war.  The powers that be ignore all
of it.

We must sound like the ocean to Bush and Cheney and Rice at this point.

We can't even get our candidates running for president to properly discuss
the war, with time wasted on harpooning pastors of churches, and other such
nonsense.

This is going to make even more people angry, but I feel very strongly that
there is only one candidate who has the credentials for ending the war, and
that's Obama.  Only Obama had the foresight and sensitivity to foresee the
tragic outcome of invading a country whose innocent people did not raise a
hand against us.

If Clinton and McCain had authorized Hitler's invasion of Poland they would
have been tried for war crimes, and found guilty for the misuse of their
powers of authorization.  It was THEIR JOB to keep the checks and balances
of the power structure we live under in place, and they failed.  Their
failure must not be overlooked this year.  In fact if I had my way they
would be taken OFF the campaign trail in shackles and put on trial in
international court alongside Bush, Cheney, Rice, Rumsfeld, Wolfowitz, etc.,
etc.

Yes I address poets right now.  There are many people in my life I talk with
about the war everyday, and why not with poets?  Why not?  It's our war, it
belongs to us too, us poets.  ALL OF US live our lives as poets in the
invading country's shelter, going to poetry readings, going to AWP, going to
the publishers.  I'm JUST AS GUILTY, trust me I know it!  But what about the
poets of Iraq?  What are their lives like?  There must be MILLIONS of poets
in Iraq, and the neighboring countries where we have caused ENDLESS
displacement of lives of Iraqi citizens seeking refuge in other countries.
The web of suffering WE have created, and continue to uphold with our taxes
will be addressed I hope by the poets of all those countries.

How do we make all our crimes right?  The war is five years old and if
McCain wins it will go on and on and on into the lives of the young children
who were born since the invasion.  Will Clinton end it?  I don't know.  She
says she wants to end it, which is good.  But I can't vote for her because I
can't vote for someone who voted for the war in the first place, and of
course she also refuses to denounce torture.  Even McCain denounces torture
for cripes sake!  Obama has always been opposed to the madness.

Those words would have consequences, yielding everything from runic silence to braying cacophony, from open improvisation to orchestral scores. Baubles and bells. Bicycle horns. The rumble of a hundred tubas. Ancient drums and electronic striations, and flashes of full-tilt swing.


The pianist and composer Muhal Richard Abrams uttered that statement of purpose one afternoon some 43 years ago, in a meeting on the South Side of Chicago. In the process he laid the groundwork for the Association for the Advancement of Creative Musicians, an organization that has fostered some of the most vital American avant-garde music of the last 40 years.


Though noncommercial, often pointedly conceptual and unabashedly arcane, this music has had a profound influence over the years on several generations of experimental musicians worldwide.


The scene plays out vividly in â€œA Power Stronger Than Itself: The A.A.C.M. and Experimental Music,â€ an important book by the trombonist-composer-scholar George Lewis due out from the University of Chicago Press this month. Reconstructing that inaugural meeting from audio tapes, Mr. Lewis conveys not only Mr. Abramsâ€™s aim but also the vigorous debate begun by his notion of â€œoriginal music.â€ (Whose music? How original?) From the start, itâ€™s clear, the association expressed its firm ideals partly through collective discourse.


Next Friday night another sort of discourse will unfold at the Community Church of New York in Murray Hill, when the association convenes a panel discussion with a handful of its current members, including Mr. Lewis, the multireedist Henry Threadgill and the pianist and vocalist Amina Claudine Myers. The conversation will precede a concert featuring Mr. Lewis and Mr. Abrams in an improvising trio with the trumpeter Wadada Leo Smith.


The evening was conceived largely as a celebration of Mr. Lewisâ€™s book, which in turn was conceived largely as a celebration of the organization, an African-American body now rooted in both Chicago and New York. Mr. Lewis narrates its development with exacting context and incisive analysis, occasionally delving into academic cultural theory. But because the book includes biographical portraits of so many participating musicians, itâ€™s a swift, engrossing read.


â€œI told George, â€˜Itâ€™s like you wrote a Russian family novel of the A.A.C.M.,â€™ â€ said the critic Greg Tate, who will moderate the panel.


Mr. Abrams reflected on the book and the organization last week in a conversation on the roof terrace of the apartment building in Clinton where he has lived since 1977. â€œThe A.A.C.M. is a group of individuals who agree to agree, or sometimes not to agree,â€ he said. â€œOur cohesiveness has been intact because we respect each otherâ€™s individualism.â€


Mr. Lewis, the Edwin H. Case professor of American music and the director of the Center for Jazz Studies at <A title="More articles about Columbia University." href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/c/columbia_university/index.html?inline=nyt-org">Columbia University</A>, offered a similar thought. â€œAs I saw it,â€ he said in his office, â€œhereâ€™s a group of people who had a robust conversation going on, with basically no holds barred, and yet managed to manage their diversity without falling apart, without falling into factionalism.â€


Such is the basic philosophy of an association once pegged by the jazz critic Whitney Balliett as â€œa black musical self-help group.â€ Three years ago, as part of its 40th-anniversary celebration, some clearer definitions emerged at a colloquium presented by the Guelph Jazz Festival in Ontario.


The saxophonist Roscoe Mitchell began by recalling how the organization grew out of the Experimental Band, led by Mr. Abrams on the South Side of Chicago. â€œWe wanted to have a place where we could sponsor each other in concerts of our original compositions; provide a training program for young, aspiring musicians in the community; reach out to other people and other cities; and have exchange programs,â€ he said.


Noticeably absent from Mr. Mitchellâ€™s description, and from the language of the early planning meetings, was the word jazz. This was partly in keeping with the armâ€™s length the organization intended to establish between its art and the commercial realm of nightclubs, then the de facto setting for any African-American art music. Partly, too, these musicians were concerned with a breadth of style that reached beyond jazz, to encompass serious classical composition, as well as music from Africa and the East. Having inherited the new freedoms of 1960s jazz innovators like <A title="More articles about John Coltrane." href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/c/john_coltrane/index.html?inline=nyt-per">John Coltrane</A> and <A title="More articles about Ornette Coleman." href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/c/ornette_coleman/index.html?inline=nyt-per">Ornette Coleman</A>, the artists in this movement were ready for a next step!
 , one they could claim as their own.


â€œThis is a book about mobility and agency,â€ Mr. Lewis said. He links this impulse conceptually to the Great Migration, illuminating how the associationâ€™s first generation came from families that had moved to Chicago from a postslavery South. He examines the continuing debate over the organizationâ€™s exclusion of nonblack musicians, shedding new light on the phrase Great Black Music, which many in the association adopted.


â€œWhat a lot of us are looking for,â€ he added, â€œis a much more open-ended conversation than any simplistic prescriptions of blackness will allow.â€

Pluralism has always been an ideal of the organization. Reporting on a marathon WKCR radio broadcast in 1977, Mr. Balliett quoted one unidentified member, responding to a question of style: â€œThe A.A.C.M. sound? If you take all the sounds of all the A.A.C.M. musicians and put them together, thatâ€™s the A.A.C.M. sound, but I donâ€™t think anyoneâ€™s heard that yet.â€

Wadada Leo Smith will perform with Mr. Abrams and Mr. Lewis next Friday in New York. <A name=secondParagraph></A>


The utopian tinge of such language was hardly lost on the artists themselves. â€œIf this was to be a revolution,â€ Mr. Lewis writes, â€œit would be a revolution without stars, individual heroes or Great Men.â€


But the association has had its share of great men (and a few great women): audacious improvisers like the trumpeter Lester Bowie, the tenor saxophonist Fred Anderson and the violinist Leroy Jenkins; visionary composers like Mr. Abrams, Ms. Myers, Mr. Threadgill, Mr. Mitchell and the saxophonist Anthony Braxton. The Art Ensemble of Chicago, the most celebrated of all its groups, has always principally emphasized the elusive chemistry of its players, who in the groupâ€™s heyday included Mr. Bowie and Mr. Mitchell alongside the multireedist Joseph Jarman, the bassist Malachi Favors and the drummer Famoudou Don Moye.


Yet even in the most solitary of settings â€” the solo saxophone recital, as represented by Mr. Braxtonâ€™s landmark 1968 album, â€œFor Altoâ€ (Delmark) â€” the aesthetic of the organization called for something other than the jazzmanâ€™s heroic voice. For this reason, Mr. Lewis said, the association represents a postmodern ideal: â€œYouâ€™re thinking about it in terms of multiple subjectivities rather than a unified subject.â€


Unlike Coltrane or even Ornette Coleman, who each developed a recognizably penetrating sound, these artists largely favored a sense of identity that was protean and slippery. And their resistance to habitual gestures was fierce.


â€œWith the A.A.C.M., youâ€™re not rooted in a set of simple, codifiable practices,â€ Mr. Lewis said, â€œbut youâ€™re rooted in an attitude, in a creation of an atmosphere, in an orientation to experience.â€


Not surprisingly, this approach never enjoyed mass acceptance, though the Art Ensemble of Chicago has always played to large concert audiences. The greater impact of the association has been felt among other artists. It inspired the formation of the Black Artists Group in St. Louis in the late 1960s. And as its first generation gradually relocated to New York in the 1970s, its experimental ethos connected with a larger circle of musicians. One was the alto saxophonist and composer <A title="More articles about John Zorn." href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/z/john_zorn/index.html?inline=nyt-per">John Zorn</A>, a chief architect of the so-called downtown scene of the 1980s and â€™90s.


Mr. Lewisâ€™s book takes a cleareyed view of the historic tensions between the Chicago and New York chapters of the association. Within his narrative those tensions sit side by side, unresolved, as they are in real life. The flutist Nicole Mitchell, a younger member of the organization who now serves as its first chairwoman, suggested as much in an e-mail message this week: â€œNew York and Chicago will continue to be very distinct organizations.â€


But Ms. Mitchell, who lives in Chicago, framed those differences in positive terms. â€œFor example, new members only come through in Chicago, and the A.A.C.M. School only exists in Chicago.â€ She was referring to the organizationâ€™s educational program, which, as she put it, â€œcontinues to fill a gap that is still present today on Chicagoâ€™s South Side.â€ And she pointed out that the two chapters had grown much more interactive in recent years, partly as a result of events surrounding the 40th anniversary in 2005.


Matana Roberts, an alto saxophonist, weighed in as a younger member of the Chicago chapter who now lives in New York. â€œThe Chicago organization and the New York organization have different goals,â€ she said. â€œThe people who came to New York were pretty major performers on an international level, whereas there are a lot of people in Chicago who perform on more of a local level. So I think there has been a lot of misunderstanding. But in the last five or six years, things seem to be pretty well connected.â€


The associationâ€™s presence in New York can be harder to find than it is in Chicago, but it has grown increasingly pervasive. Certainly its spirit of self-preservation and collectivity can be found in the Vision Festival, presented each June on the Lower East Side by the artist-run nonprofit organization Arts for Art. (This yearâ€™s event will feature performances by numerous members of the association, including Mr. Lewis.) A related entity, Rise Up Creative Music and Arts, has been presenting performances each weekend this spring, also on the Lower East Side. On Friday the series will feature Ms. Roberts in a solo performance.


The associationâ€™s practices can also be found around the city on a regular basis, thanks to artists like the pianist Vijay Iyer, a nonmember who has worked extensively as a sideman with Mr. Smith and Mr. Mitchell. Both of the albums released by Mr. Iyer last month reflect his deep experience with the organization; one, â€œDoorâ€ (Pi), is a product of the collective trio Fieldwork, which could be considered a sort of unofficial byproduct of the association. (Fieldworkâ€™s other two members are the drummer Tyshawn Sorey, who has backed Mr. Abrams in concert, and the saxophonist Steve Lehman, who is now a teaching assistant for Mr. Lewis.)


For Mr. Lewis, who began work on â€œA Power Stronger Than Itselfâ€ more than a decade ago as a professor in the music department at the University of California, San Diego, the association presents a continuing story, especially given the relatively recent arrival of talent like Ms. Mitchell and Ms. Roberts. And as he has demonstrated in his own career, the older members of the organization have continued to create and innovate.


Mr. Abrams made much the same point. â€œCertainly there has been great development, and I think at the base of that development is constant work,â€ he said.


And at the heart of that work? Originality, of course. Or as Mr. Abrams put it, â€œThe word and the work are the same.â€

This is the first I've heard that Sappho is a suicide, for man or woman.
Sappho did have a daughter, Kleis.  Some say, and others deny, her husband
and Kleis' father was a wealthy merchant of Andros named Kerkolas/Kerkylas.

Mr Lambrou is a familiar and recurring figure throughout the history of
literature and the literature of history; the agent in charge of restoring
to social norms and aesthetic conformities the lives and legacies of
Legendary Writers, of Cleaning Up the Act, so to speak, so its more fit for
"public consumption."   This Remarkable Revisionist is not confined to
patrolling the Classical Ages--one finds the same figure just as active
among contemporary and recently past avant-gardes, post-avants, neo-avants,
traditionalists, reactionaries, Retro-Futurists, Neo-Conceptualists, Pre-Da
Vinci Code Codists,  post- Sopranos Digitalists,  Neo-Electronic
Post-Luddite Meditationalists, proto-Tactilians, FauxK Balladeers,
Crypto-Cunieformalists, Falanguage Classicists, , Neo-Concretists, Old
School New Agists, Dead-Beat  Bards, Hip Hop Hyper Textualists,
Ultra-Soundists, Extra-Sensory Perceptionalists, Phonemdalists, Satanic
Versifiers, Peniteniacostalists, Forced Confessionalists--everywhere Mr
Lambrou looks, the Augean Stables beckon, for is it not indeed a Herculean
task to "restore the purity of the language of the tribe?"

Mr Lambrou would have poets, those Muse-blessed beings, as well as  their
lowly counterparts  among humans living and dead or undead for thousands of
years, be dwellers in a state of purity in which miraculously it was
entirely unknown for persons to be married and have a family with a person
of the opposite sex, and at the same be in love with or lovers with persons
of the same sex.

Does it "redeem" Sappho if she had killed herself for a MAN?

Or--does this assertion of Mr Lambrou's redeem" HIMSELF?
As a "lover" of Sappho's work--?

Perhaps, it is rather the case--and here one may hear the first stirrings of
terror in his voice as he stands poised at the edge of the abyss--

Perhaps it is the other way round, and it is Mr Lambrou who would kill
himself for the love of HER--Sappho!!!

For having betrayed "him' with a--dare one utter it???--WOMAN!!

(It's already been  hard enough for poor Mr Lambrou to take-- her bearing
another man's child and all--)

Plato called Sappho "the Tenth Muse"--the first Nine being all males--who,
being "Greek" so to speak--wrote poems of love addressed to--men.

Amazing how this doesn't seem to need Mr. Lambrou's Urgent Attention as a
Concerned Citizen in the way that Sappho's "situation" does!

But then, while many may be called, few are chosen--and so it has fallen to
Mr Lambrou to set this Terrible Lie, this Adulterous, this "Lesbian"
Deception,  to rest--and, though suffering much, to rise to his appointed
and Herculean task and "purify the language of the tribe, " and at the same
time sacrifice himself for his love--for Sappho--

Ah! What an incredible and fittingly "noble'" public service has Mr Lambrou
performed!!

Does he not deserve to have the some "changed aspect" of the Isle of Lesbos
named in his honor--to perhaps--Lambrous?  At least, a nice little cove with
that name, complete with the bequeathing of a lifelong honorary citizenship
and wonderfully appointed villa whose windows open out to those spectacular
views for which the island has become, in good part thanks to Sappho, so
justly famous--

I wonder how Mr Lambrou "negotiates" his way through such "treacherous"
lines of Sappo's as these:

To me he seems like a god
as he sits facing you and
hears you near as you speak
softly and luagh

in a sweet echo that jolts
the heart in my ribs. For now
as I look at you my voice
is empty and

can say nothing as my tongue
cracks and slender fire is quick
under my skin.  My eyes are dead
to light, my ears

pound, and sweat pours over me.
I convulse, greener than grass,
and feel my mind slip as I
go close to death,

yet, being poor, must suffer
everything.

It's just hetero propaganda.  Pfffft.

From Wikipedia:

A tradition going back at least to Menander (fr. 258 K) suggested that
Sappho killed herself by jumping off the Leucadian cliffs for love of Phaon,
a ferryman. T*his is regarded as ahistorical by modern scholars*, perhaps
invented by the comic poets or originating from a misreading of a
first-person reference in a non-biographical poem. The legend may have
resulted in part from a desire to assert Sappho as heterosexual.

As for Sappho marrying and having a family, it's kind of important to
remember that in many cultures getting married and having children is more
about a notion of duty, and not necessarily about who you love and often
even less about who you are sexually attracted to.  People were and are
married off all the time to people they barely know and accept it as an
economic relationship.  This doesn't say anything really about how Sappho
actually felt.

What is interesting is how many people historically really, really need to
disavow her sexuality.  What;s that all about?

It reminds me of that old Voices and Visions PBS show on Walt Whitman when
the interviewer first showed Harold Bloom proclaiming "there is no proof at
all that Whitman was homosexual...." and then cut immediately to Allen
Ginsberg opening Leaves of Grass, thumping his finger down on a passage and
saying "It says so right here...."

Cheers,

Suzanne

It's a long-standing story.  I think it crops up first in the 8thC AD
_Suda_, or possibly earlier.  The guy's name was Phaon.

It's been recognised as late apochryphal rubbish (although Donne and Pope
both apparently bought it) for ages, so goodness knows why it's suddenly
resurfaced.

Well, that's pretty much par for the course, and probably why the story was
invented in the first place, lo these many centuries ago.

Lambrou also seems to illustrate another all-too-common "scholarly"
phenomenon -- someone not bothering to do a blind bit of research into the
material he's retailing, and as a result producing, or reproducing, rubbish.

You can't even call it "pernicious rubbish", since it's so silly.

As Peter Porter says in another context, "Finally we are condemned for our
lack of talent."

Hello Buffalo Poetics---

Introducing the
Kenning-Editions-is-going-to-press-with-a-new-title-and-reprinting-an-old,
simultaneously, fund raising drive! We're broke & passing the savings on
to you. Offer good through May. Here's your chance to pre-order the
forthcoming chapbook, THE PINK, by Kyle Schlesinger. Full details on
this title in a forthcoming mailing.

Subscribe to the trade paperback series by check (or carefully concealed
cash), write "POETICS LIST" across the top of the sub form, and take
three bucks off the overall price of your order. Here's that
subscription form: http://www.kenningeditions.com/images/sub07-08.pdf

Note that this includes an offer to our subscribers a free copy of our
forthcoming chapbook title during the intermission between the Dorantes
and Lu titles. So, in the order you can expect them to arrive, here are
the details on all three books.

* * * sexoPUROsexoVELOZ and SEPTIEMBRE, by Dolores Dorantes, translated
by Jen Hofer * * *

/sexoPUROsexoVELOZ and SEPTIEMBRE/ are books two and three of Dolores
Dorantes’ lifelong project, entitled /Dolores Dorantes/. They consist of
fragmented interlocking poetic sequences that create a scaffolding to
frame Dorantes’ vivid explorations of the intensely personal and
intensely social questions inhabiting the space called “Dolores
Dorantes.” /"Dolores Dorantes/ is a visionary book whose absent parts
reclaim the author and haunt the reader. It contains spectral
dimensions, whether one considers the relationship between poet and
translator (collaborators, really) who shadow each other across the
pages, or if you stop to notice the interplay (intertext) Dorantes
allows her readers." —Guillermo Juan Parra, /Venepoetics/
//
* * * THE PINK, by Kyle Schlesinger * * *
//
"The Pink: the color of course, or the recurrent carnations among the
gathered leaves of this little bouquet, but also the sheer force of the
form, the shear of a kind of textile cut, jagged and precise—a kind of
coup de grace—not just between lines but also opening the serrated space
between letters to reveal the "hue" in "house" or to separate the "ink"
from the "inkling," the "blue" from the "print." To distinguish, in
other words, the abstract plan from the material written form. In that
linguistic pinking, Kyle Schlesinger cuts both into and against the
weave, an angular slide into the inframince space of "the leading of a
phrase" (both the leading question of rhetoric and the spacing of
letterforms), somewhere "between the chair and the thought of it" (where
chair is the French for "body"), or "the sensation of a concept" and
"the concept of a sensation." Here is the world, of words, in miniature,
through rose-colored magnifying glasses." --Craig Dworkin

* * * AMBIENT PARKING LOT, by Pamela Lu * * *

Part fiction, part earnest mockumentary, /Ambient Parking Lot/ follows a
band of musicians as they wander the parking structures of urban
downtown and greater suburbia in quest of the ultimate ambient
noise--one that promises to embody their historical moment and deliver
them up to the heights of their self-important artistry. Along the way,
they make sporadic forays into lyric while contending with doubts,
delusions, miscalculations, mutinies, and minor triumphs. This saga
peers into the wreckage of a post-9/11 landscape and embraces the comedy
and poignancy of failed utopia. Pamela Lu is the author of /Pamela: A
Novel/. Her work appears in the anthology /Biting the Error/ and in
periodicals such as /Harper’s/, /Chicago Review/, /call: a review/,
/1913/, and /Fascicle/.

NOTE TO CURRENT SUBSCRIBERS: You'll get THE PINK as a free bonus, too,
of course. NOTE TO DISINTERESTED PARTIES: Are you dumb or something?
NOTE TO THOSE WISHING TO HELP THIS STRUGGLING PRESS ALONG: The most
helpful thing you could possibly do is to purchase the Kenning Editions
titles at full price through our website: www.kenningeditions.com.

There are many, many, many reasons-- too many to list-- to miss Allen.

In association with making a recent "haptic" drawing, I listened to John O'Keefe's wonderful recent performance adaptation of Walt Whitman's Song of Myself.   It was a presentation last summer here at the Marsh in San Francisco, filmed by William Farley, and just released on as DVD, (Go to www.farleyfilm.com for an exerpt and ordering details). O'Keefe's voices achieves a robust, sensual and ecstatic relationship with the original text and brings, at least, his sense of the man, quite to life. A real delight

 I am naive to much critical work on Whitman. However, listening to the poet's spirited sense of intimacy of eye and ear for the streets of his Manhattan (folks et al), it's impossible not to make connections with Frank O'Hara's work on that island approximately a hundred years later. I cannot imaging that O'Hara was not imbued by this work.

 Oh, if you want to see the drawing go to my blog (below my short riff on Rashenberg/Raushenberg Erased
    http://stephenvincent.net/blog/
 For the drawing In addition to O'Keefe's Whitman, I was also listening to Ornette Coleman's Meta Body. I also imagine a relationship between Ornette's sense poly-expansiveness in rhythms and idioms and Whitman. But that's an idea for another day. Of course, you can look at the "haptic" and see nothing to do with any of the above compadres.

Hi,
What poets have come closest in practice to parallelling

 the 60's (from free jazz in general to Miles' band with Wayne Shorter in p=
articular) with contemporary elements from hip hop, drum&bass and world mus=
ic. Originally from Munich (Germany) he studied at Berklee before he moved =
1995 to New York. Here he played and recorded a.o. with Frank Lacy, Sonny S=
immons, Sabir Mateen, Jeffrey Shurdut, Lukas Ligeti, Vernon Ried  and parti=

5/23 - JC resident and interactive guitarist Damian Catera - with Michael L=
opez on drums and spoken-word artist G. E. Schwartz on poetry and vocals

"Call it dark space music or experimental drones, this music rattles the so=
ul -- and the windows."
                                                -- Fran=E7ois Couture, allm=
usic.com
Damian Catera is an electroacoustic composer/improviser, sound installation=
 and media artist. Catera's work reflects interests in experimental composi=
tion/ improvisation, transmission and sociopolitical critique. He has toure=
d and exhibited his work the US, Europe and Asia. His primary mission as an=
 artist is to blur disciplinary boundaries often utilizing appropriated mat=
erial and algorithmic processing. In recent years, Catera has performed sol=
o improvised "decompositions" using computer manipulated live radios as ins=
trumentation in such venues as the New Museum of Contemporary Art and The K=
itchen in New York City , the ZKM institute in Germany and the Institute fo=
r Contemporary Art in Prague. He is represented by the Hogar Collection Gal=
lery in Brooklyn, NY and is the recipient of a 2008 Fellowship from the New=
 Jersey State Council on the Arts.

Writer, poet and vocalist G. E. Schwartz, frozen by the mad love of John Mo=
ntague and Joseph Brodsky and Joey Heatherton, and the immense teaching of =
their spring of broken symbols, has turned and twisted in the circles of SO=
LOMONS RAMADA, FAKING TRAINS and EONCHS OF RUBY. He forfeited the divine na=
meless by putting out the book Only Other Are: Poems (LEGIBLE PRESS), all t=
he while his little finger plumbing the dark moist sepal of new terrain. Th=
e Bellingham Dance Company has just choreographed his "House of Silver Wind=
ows" out in the Seattle area).=20


5/30 - JC resident and trumpeter Nate Wooley -- with Chris Speed on tenor s=
axophone and clarinet, Reuben Radding on bass and JC resident Harris Eisens=
tadt on drums
"Local trumpet ace Nate Wooley (is) one of the few cats who is working hard=
 at redefining the vocabulary and sound of the trumpet."
                               -- Bruce Gallanter, Downtown Music Gallery

Nate Wooley grew up in a small fishing town in Oregon.  He grew up in his f=
ather's big band, beginning his professional career at age 13. After a peri=
od of study, Nate landed in Jersey City.  He has made a name for himself as=
 a sideman, working with such improvisors as Paul Lytton, Anthony Braxton, =
John Butcher, Steve Beresford, Joe Morris, and Daniel Levin. His experiment=
ation on the trumpet has led to him being labeled "exquisitely hostile" by =
the Italian magazine, Touching Extremes.  His solo work, acoustic and with =
unprocessed amplification, has led him to work in fields left and right of =
the jazz world as well, with bands such as Akron/Family, Wolf Eyes, Burning=
 Star Core, and David Grubbs. The quartet will perform pieces of Nate's wor=
ked to a wonderful frayed edge over the past 5 years. =20

The group, featuring two of the leading lights of the Brooklyn/downtown sce=
ne, Reuben Radding and Harris Eisenstadt (a JC resident who participated in=
 last year's "HFA" festival), welcomes special guest Chris Speed tonight fo=
r a reading of this music as well as some of Nate's new Christian Wolff ins=
pired "exercises".

I've recently submitted a review to Contemporary Verse 2 of Robert Creeley's
Selected Poems where I argue that many of his poems are a poetic version of
abstract expressionism.

sitting around to finish?title is "__________." It is about the rise,
of __________?one article talks about "monastic groupies," people who
connected themselves to a monastery, practiced some of the disciplines
but lived outside in the world. I have tended to go to different
monasteries, three I think at this point but was a regular at a
retreat center for about a year.

Also Just finished reading __________ on "__________." They have
excellent material in that __________, maybe I need to re-subscribe?
Of course, I have had this one lying around for 6 months and only now
finished it. One article talked about the problem of __________ and
how so many __________.

I am moving slowly through __________ but hope I can sustain my

significant impact on him (in the __________ I just finished). I
should finish __________ by the __________ of my recently completed
_________?hmmm, if I am saying should, that is not a good sign. Also
have a couple of chapters to finish in __________?that is one that
started out very promising but couldn't sustain itself and so I put it
aside?maybe having two __________ to finish had something to do with
it. What is next? A couple on my desk that I am looking at
longingly?__________ by__________, __________ by __________and
__________by __________. I do want to head back and finish __________

I just sent a 3 lb package of books to London & it cost me $26 for the
cheapest rate.  Anyone know of any cheaper alternatives for getting
books overseas?  In the old days there used to be a surface rate that
took weeks or months but at least it was a reasonable charge.

The question--or, the answers--confuse(s) me. While I expect some of the
names that have appeared, it's only through what secondary snippets I've
read; I've never been able to figure out the criteria. What are they? How=

can anyone who uses language to represent anything--which literature seem=
s
almost to have to do, even if it also represents itself--do what abstract=

visual art does? I'm obviously missing something... but what?

And sometimes, on top of it, they tax the addressee. They explained me at
the post office that it is a customs law and, if I receive any packages
without paying the due tax it is because the employee did not notice it came
from the States. *Ipse dixerunt.*
Thus, keep silent and keep on paying, this is what I got out of it.*

maybe none of these yer all fishing for straws
they all had a free associastion with visual arts and artists
but abstraction in ther writing where?
ashberrry more surreal yau more ashberry
schyuler lyrical shapiro wonderful and is an art maniac but abstract?
ohara come on they were his pals but his work is more like freilicher
paintings pardon the spelling
maybe coolidge's free formisms
open forms
they may be influenced but technique
a spontaneity as in a jazz solo improv
as in pollack klein not really possibly de kooning somewhat etc
one abstract expressionist herman cherry wrote lovely pomes

If you're sending a lot, M-bags are the best bet.  I had two complete sacks
sent from the US to the UK no problem.  Took about two weeks, I think, to
arrive.

A got a friend in the US to check the details for me, and here's what she
said:

Priority Mail  International would seem to come out at $9 for 3 lbs.

I've related what DuPlessis, Vanderborg and Davidson call in various ways=
 palimptexts to the types of painting that Jackson Pollack does, where the=
 text becomes layered and increasingly illegible, creating the depth of=
 greys, blacks and whites or off-whites of the drips and TEXTures.

Sara Lundquist writes about Barbara Guest and the abstract expressionists,=
 too.

Your (Art)world is based on mutual relief at your common corruption.  Maybe some
cultures are based on even worse. But that wouldn't change the bad faith of it and
as years go by, you wake at night in terror of your whole life being an act of bad
faith, where everything is self-interest and nothing more, where every human
interaction is driven by a silent, even subconscious calculation of some ulterior
motive, to the point that a sea of bad faith has taken over your whole life, there's
no small island left from which you can even try to build a bridge of good faith,
because even that effort becomes suspect, even good faith is nothing but
self-interested, even altruism is nothing but solipsistic, even your professed
agonizing right here right now is nothing but a gesture, made to the conscience in
order to assure it that it exists.

A poet/writer not yet noted re the Abstract Expressionists is Jack
Kerouac--who was friends with many of the painters, and used
"sketching" as fundamental of his Spontaneous Bop Prosody, combing
visual and sonic awareness brought togetehr with the "frame" of the
page of a pocket notebook--which could be pulled out and sketched in
"on site"--

though a difference in scale makes Kerouac's approach, until he gets
to his "studio" and its typewriter--portable in a way that the huge
canvases of the painters is not--

in this sense Kerouac moves also from visual/sonic sketching to his
considerations of photography and his collaborations with Robert
Frank--in photography and film both--

certainly Kerouac can be called an "Action Poet" in the sense the
painters are "Action Painters"--from the sketches to his famous high
speed typing, which was considered by some an almost athletic feat in
itself--(and like many athletes then and now, aided by "banned
substances" such as the still popular "uppers"--)

Kerouac called writing at this stage "silent meditation going a
hundred miles an hour"--the sonic aspects of Bop and immediate sounds
in the world of the sketching and dreaming over photographic images
now being converted to type at such high speed that it become a silent
meditation on the art of the writer--while the spectators/listeners
through a crack in the door reported the non-stop "clang clang clang"
of the return bell, the typing being so fast that lines were finished
"almost immediately---

While the article & exhibition are concerned with critical writings
rather than poetry in re Abstraction Expressionism/Action painting--
very much the "war of words" involved in a "war of images" during the Cold War--

for all it's reputation critically, at the time Abstract
Expressionism/Action Painting sold poorly--it's exhibition often was
via the State Department and other official venues as a major
propaganda/cultural export like Jazz, promoting American "freedom of
expression" versus its "opposite number" behind the Iron Curtain.

(Also promoting USA as new center of High Culture--in painting and
music--and the novel--was Sartre helping out here by having written
some very interesting essays on the European receptions and
manipulations of American novels by Fascist and Communist
governments--during WW2--the Nobel Prize for Faulkner and the impact
of American "hardboiled" writers and Hemingway-)

John Zerzan has an  interesting essay & different take on the
painters/painting of this period
in his book Running on Emptiness The Pathology of Civilization, called
"Abstract Expressionism  Painting as Vision and Critique."

Zerzan considers the painters from the point of view of their lifelong
involvements with Anarchism (Newman, Gottlieb, Rothko, and Still).
Reading the statements by and quotes from remarks in conversations
with Newman, Rothko, Still and Pollock, the passion and violence as
well as peaceful, Utopian aspects of Anarchism are very alive.  By
contrast with the timidity of "radical" American artists and writers
today, these characters sound like "extremists" not far removed from
being "detained."  Perhaps the suicides of several were like that of
Van Gogh, as described by Artaud during this same time period:  "The
Man Suicided by Society."  Not to mention a pronounced alcoholism, a
slower form of suicide.
(Or, one may also ask, does the particular stance adopted and the time
period and place in which it was operative, in a sense, aided by
alcoholism, function as a set-up--the "heroic" aspirations which can
"never be realized here" setting up the scenario for the
self-immolating Icarian Fall---)

Interesting question.  Thanks for thinking of me, J.
Michael.  At first, upon reading your post, I thought,
yes, I must surely be as ab-ex in my poetry as anyone
since I compose ab-ex graphics for use as terms in my
long-division poems, and have copied canonical
specimens of 1950's ab-ex works into my poems.  On
reflection, though, I realized that I use ab-ex
conceptually rather than do it--although I may be a
lot like Gottlieb in that.  A poet who uses words the
way ab-ex painters used paint, though, is John M.
Bennett, whom I've called the Jackson Pollock of
contemporary poetry.  I see ab-ex painting as
non-representational painting at its most visceral,
primitive level--a reveling in color as dance-steps,
pre-conceptual expression of sub-cerebral inner
(animal) states; Bennett, in much of his poetry does
something similar with words, which he transforms into
sub-verbal vocalizations of sub-cerebral inner states
rendered in dance-steps as a literary equivalent of
action painting.

I don't think too many poets are much like the
abstract-expressionists--but Ficus strangulensis,
yes--and you, J. Michael, too.  Mike Basinski in some
of his work.  Jackson Mac Low, very possibly, although
I'm not sufficiently conversant with his work to be
sure.  But certainly not post-Eliot/Pound jump-cut
poets like Jorie Graham.  Nor most language poets, I
don't think, who seem to me to have different aims
than the ab-ex painters.

Bob,

Very interesting post.

I think to see into the relationship between the eye and words, particularly
the way Jackson Pollock may use the visual, for example, one might go to
Stan Brakhage, particularly films like mothlight, the garden of earthly
delight, the stars are beautiful, and what he says about the titles of his
films.

Ciao,

Murat

But that layered texture has a cadence, a rhythm, a song. That is, it is not
all a matter of technique, or surfaces.

Yesterday at the Jasper Johns show at the Met I noticed that one of the
paintings included the cover to Ted Berrigan's The Sonnets; others were
dedicated to Frank O'Hara and Hart Crane.

What about John Ashbery's *The Tennis Court Oath*, Kenneth Koch's *When The
Sun Tries To Go On* (with a cover by Larry Rivers),  Clark Coolidge's
*Space* (with a cover by Jasper Johns), and *Polaroid*, and early Bernadette
Mayer like *Story* and *Moving*(especially the ending), and other works
published in O-9 edited by Acconci and Mayer?

You remind me of d a levy, who was very much an
abstract expressionist in his treated texts, which
featured various kinds of overprinting, and were
intentionally accident-prone to an extreme the way I
think much abstract-expressionism was.  Also visceral,
"sloppy," and primitive-seeming.  Another visual poet
who has been abstract-expressionist with
over-printing, although rather carefully, is Tom
Phillips.  Doris Cross, another, and fully intuitive
and "sloppy."  Still, for splattering words like
Pollock splattered paint, I think John M. Bennett one
of the very few (although he's a visual poet, too, who
splatters ink of various colors, too, and who knows
what else).

I'm confused-- how are rhythm or cadence not techniques or surfaces?
Couldn't that be where the action happens?

Hi,

Juliana Spahr and I are pleased to announce the publication of =
Intersection: Sidewalks and Public Space, edited by Marci Nelligan and =
Nicole Mauro. It is the first in a new book series called ChainLinks, a =
spinoff project of the journal Chain. The goal of this new series is to =
produce books that might change people's minds, might agitate for =
(thought) reform, might shift perspectives. This project also continues =
Chain's desire to provide space for work that slips through genre cracks =
and falls outside of disciplinary boundaries. In the spirit of Chain =
magazine, these books will combine works that normally would not be =
published side by side, organizing them around a formal thematic.=20

Intersection is a collection of essays concerning sidewalks and public =
spaces in contemporary society. Each contributor presents a unique =
response to concepts first laid out by Jane Jacobs in her influential =
work The Death and Life of Great American Cities (excerpts of which are =
reprinted at the beginning of the book). Contributors include historian =
Claire Potter, performance artist William Pope.L, sociologist Mitchell =
Duneier, surveillance expert Melissa Ngo. Also included is a photo essay =
by Paul Madonna on stencil art on the sidewalks of San Francisco's =
Mission District.

This book can be ordered through Small Press Distribution:
http://www.spdbooks.org/Details.asp?BookID=3D1930068395 =
<http://www.spdbooks.org/Details.asp?BookID=3D1930068395>=20


The next book in the ChainLinks series will be Borders, edited by =
Susanne Christensen & Audun Lindholm. For more information on ChainLinks =
and how to propose a book for the series, please go to www.chainarts.org

Thanks,
Jena Osman

Murat,
    Mentioning Brakhage, who's the best candidate--but easiest since the
painting-film connection is easier to make--so far for an ab-ex in some
other art, reminds me of Len Lye, whose hand-painted, scratched films
Brakhage admired. I wrote a piece ("Len Lye and Abstract Expressionis,"
for the catalogue for Lye' Pompidou show some years ago).
   Seems to me the 'expressionist' analogy is the one most have looked
for (but several so-called ab ex's weren't=20
Bery 'expressionist', such as Barnett Newman) whereas it is the
'abstract' part on which the analogy falls over.
What's abstract poetry? And, more difficult still: does it mean the same
thing as abstract painting? And if it does or doesn't, does it matter?
       Wystan    =20

Bob,

Very interesting post.

I think to see into the relationship between the eye and words,
particularly the way Jackson Pollock may use the visual, for example,
one might go to Stan Brakhage, particularly films like mothlight, the
garden of earthly delight, the stars are beautiful, and what he says
about the titles of his films.

Ciao,

Murat

Flesh of the world -- Flesh of the body -- Being
                                                              May, 1960

  _Flesh of the world,_ described (apropos of time, space, movement) as
segregation, dimensionality, continuation, latency, encroachment -- --
Then interrogate once again these phenomena-questions: they refer us to
the perceiving-perceived _Einfuhlung,_ for they mean that we are already
_in_ the being thus described, that we _are of it,_ that between it and us
there is _Einfuhlung_
  That means that my body is made of the same flesh as the world (it is a
perceived), and moreover that this flesh of my body is shared by the
world, the world _reflects_ it, encroaches upon it and it encroaches upon
the world (the felt [_senti_] at the same time the culmination of subject-
ivity and the culmination of materiality), they are in a relation of
transgression or of overlapping -- -- This also means: my body is not only
one perceived among others, it is the measurant (_measurant_) of all,
_Nullpunkt_ of all the dimensions of the world.

[...]

  The _touching itself, seeing itself_ of the body is itself to be under-
stood in terms of what we said of the seeing and the visible, the touching
and the touchable.  Ie. it is not an act, it is a being at (etre a).

- Merleau-Ponty, The Visible and the Invisible, from the Working Notes


of there to here as not both here and here, neither here nor here -- --
"my body is made of the same flesh as the world" - incipient accumulative
processes, no differing among real and virtual, prim and corporeality,
tissue and organ -- emanent life, emanent living --

(clearly these speak to my recent work/theory, and thanks to Sandy Baldwin
for sending me to the book)

Dear David,
           I'm with you on Kerouac, at his most improvisational anyway. =
Improvisation is one of the widely pervasive aspects of practice that is =
under-discussed in my view. But closer still to Abstract Expressionist =
poetics is surely Olson's Projective Verse and his own practice; there's =
something to that fact that Black Mountain College was visited by de =
Kooning, Kline, Twombly, Rauschenberg and others. The approach  =
'composition by field' was shared ' by the painters, Olson, and Merce =
Cunningham to choreography. Olson's 'Propriception' essay, sketches out =
a phenonmenology of the gesture that is as appropriated to 'gestural =
abstraction,' as to Len Lye's kinetic sculpture's 'figures of motion.' =
of the late 50s.=20
      cheers,
   Wystan

A poet/writer not yet noted re the Abstract Expressionists is Jack
Kerouac--who was friends with many of the painters, and used
"sketching" as fundamental of his Spontaneous Bop Prosody, combing
visual and sonic awareness brought togetehr with the "frame" of the
page of a pocket notebook--which could be pulled out and sketched in
"on site"--

though a difference in scale makes Kerouac's approach, until he gets
to his "studio" and its typewriter--portable in a way that the huge
canvases of the painters is not--

in this sense Kerouac moves also from visual/sonic sketching to his
considerations of photography and his collaborations with Robert
Frank--in photography and film both--

certainly Kerouac can be called an "Action Poet" in the sense the
painters are "Action Painters"--from the sketches to his famous high
speed typing, which was considered by some an almost athletic feat in
itself--(and like many athletes then and now, aided by "banned
substances" such as the still popular "uppers"--)

Kerouac called writing at this stage "silent meditation going a
hundred miles an hour"--the sonic aspects of Bop and immediate sounds
in the world of the sketching and dreaming over photographic images
now being converted to type at such high speed that it become a silent
meditation on the art of the writer--while the spectators/listeners
through a crack in the door reported the non-stop "clang clang clang"
of the return bell, the typing being so fast that lines were finished
"almost immediately---

While the article & exhibition are concerned with critical writings
rather than poetry in re Abstraction Expressionism/Action painting--
very much the "war of words" involved in a "war of images" during the =
Cold War--

for all it's reputation critically, at the time Abstract
Expressionism/Action Painting sold poorly--it's exhibition often was
via the State Department and other official venues as a major
propaganda/cultural export like Jazz, promoting American "freedom of
expression" versus its "opposite number" behind the Iron Curtain.

(Also promoting USA as new center of High Culture--in painting and
music--and the novel--was Sartre helping out here by having written
some very interesting essays on the European receptions and
manipulations of American novels by Fascist and Communist
governments--during WW2--the Nobel Prize for Faulkner and the impact
of American "hardboiled" writers and Hemingway-)

John Zerzan has an  interesting essay & different take on the
painters/painting of this period
in his book Running on Emptiness The Pathology of Civilization, called
"Abstract Expressionism  Painting as Vision and Critique."

Zerzan considers the painters from the point of view of their lifelong
involvements with Anarchism (Newman, Gottlieb, Rothko, and Still).
Reading the statements by and quotes from remarks in conversations
with Newman, Rothko, Still and Pollock, the passion and violence as
well as peaceful, Utopian aspects of Anarchism are very alive.  By
contrast with the timidity of "radical" American artists and writers
today, these characters sound like "extremists" not far removed from
being "detained."  Perhaps the suicides of several were like that of
Van Gogh, as described by Artaud during this same time period:  "The
Man Suicided by Society."  Not to mention a pronounced alcoholism, a
slower form of suicide.
(Or, one may also ask, does the particular stance adopted and the time
period and place in which it was operative, in a sense, aided by
alcoholism, function as a set-up--the "heroic" aspirations which can
"never be realized here" setting up the scenario for the
self-immolating Icarian Fall---)

Ya know, I kinda miss that word "Sapphist".  I think someone needs to bring
it back into common usage.  You start the team, I'll create the t-shirt and
show up to whistle.

Sigh.  Just wrote and deleted a fantasy that is waaaaaaaay off topic.
Heheh.

The M-bags that have been mentioned worked wonderfully for me in moving the
last of my books to England, but in my experience delivery took six weeks
and I was originally advised 4-6.

If anyone comes up with a cheaper alternative for smaller parcels, please
let me know!

M-bags (stands for 'media' bags, I was told at the PO)
also can get pretty mashed around, so careful packing
and strapping tape are a good idea even though they
put the boxes inside canvas bags. And yes on the 6-week
time frame in my experience also -

Good point, Steve!

=20

Sounds like it's quite possible that I missed "bad trips," that is to
say, experiences that might have "gotten deeper" and ruptured whatever
ego control was "protecting" or "guarding"

"darker" sides of myself that might have proved more than simply
"entertaining."  =20

=20

Yeah, I'll buy that, if that's what you're implying. =20

=20

AND if that is in fact "the case..."  Again, I might argue that quite
possibly "bad" trips might not be "available" to some whose minds might
perhaps be "too rational" to permit certain "fears," that is, get
terribly shook up by even "fear," itself. =20

=20

(I'm not saying that I was invulnerable to "fear" or Fear's ghostly
sister "anxiety."  Nor that I was hyper-rational; that's be an
irrational delusion, anyhow.  Nor that I didn't have considerable
"stuff" to "work on"; several years of deep, long term
psychotherapy/psychoanalyis years later certainly revealed all kinds of
"hurt" and pain and fear and the like.)

=20

Interesting question(s) arise, though: Were "bad trips" caused by "bad
acid?"  Or were folks more deeply vulnerable - for example, folks with
organic schizophrenias (schizophrenias caused by true, genetically
physiological chemical imbalances - more likely to experience "bad
trips?" Or develop more so-called "mystical" experiences?  If one did
NOT experience "bad trips," then did one have too rigid or uptight an
ego system or "defenses," or did one just override the interpretation of
the experience as "bad," that is, somehow keep in "mind," yes, a
conscious-ego awareness, that "hey, we're along for the ride now, and it
will be over after a certain number of hours and then that will be that,
so no reason to be scared or frightened?"  If one did not experience any
"bad" trips, then did one miss out on -- fail to go deep enough to
experience - truly "worthwhile" psychological/perceptual "territory?"
Or, if one did not experience "bad" trips, then does one perhaps suffer
from a "retarded" or "underdeveloped" imagination or soul-system?  (Of
course, that last question is pretty much rhetorical.  Not experiencing
"bad" trips would NOT suggest an underdeveloped imagination; it would
only suggest that one had developed his/her imagination to=20

concentrate on less esoteric and obscure interpretations of experience,
or that one was, simply, much less inclined to indulge in or find
compelling more "fantastic" interpretations of experience/reality.)


=20

I did, in fact, "do"/consume "freshly picked mushrooms" dozens of times
(and raw peyote buttons once).  I lived in Gainesville, Florida, for
about a year after finishing college at Jacksonville in 1979.  It was,
essentially, the "mushroom capital of the East," and we used to go sneak
on farmlands and ranches out in the country and pick them by the grocery
sack-ful.  My roommate, who was 6-7 years older, had organized and
facilitated various "acid-tests" there a decade earlier, too, and he was
"gentle" and "careful" introducing me to such things.  Also, this
"guide" had, in turn, been introduced to me by humanistic psychology
professors and Gestalt therapist(s) and others involved in progressive
psychiatries up in Jacksonville, so there was even more "safety" and a
point-of-view "going into psychodelics ingestion" that all had been
"done before" by all kinds of very solid, together, "rational," and
courageous folks, and THEY MADE IT THROUGH THESE THINGS QUITE INTACT, so
nothing to be scared about...  Now, hey, heck, we used to eat the
mushrooms until we were "totally Saturated," that is, ingest 6-8 of them
(east coast mushrooms are not as potent as west coast and mexico
mushrooms), enough so that one's body chemistry cannot really be
affected by further ingestion, as the body's chemistry can only
metabolize or interact with just so much of the chemicals, and any
excess is simply "ignored" (the body runs out of receptors available, I
think).  Anyhow, it was always just an especially intense (and very
"muscular," as the stomach muscles really, really get put to the test,
ditto with peyote buttons) "visual" and "time" experience.  A great deal
of "joy," and "laughter," and "distortion of space and bodily sensation
and perception," but, truly, how much of that is really exceptionally
"irrational" or extraordinary?  There are "chemicals" in one's body and
those chemicals affect one's perception and one's physical sensations.
What's so extraordinary about that?

=20

(Well, one thing that WAS unusual with both LSD trips/experiences is
that I temporarily lost my "fear of heights."  First trip, we climbed up
"monkey bars" in a city park and I moved along like a cat, completely
"coordinated" and "graceful" and "fearless."  Same thing, Second trip,
in San Francisco, down at the Marina in 1990, we trekked to some high
ground that ordinarily would scare the heck out of me and put me on my
hands and knees, afraid of falling and getting hurt, but ON ACID, there
was no such fear of heights...)

=20

Here's a few questions more obviously and directly related to "poetics"
and poetry: (1)if ONE OF "poetry's" purposes and effects is
"liberation," would one want to "be liberated from"=20

the vulnerability of having "bad trips" while taking hallucinogens; or
"liberated from" the inclination to interpret any given trip, including
quite arresting and frightening ones, as "bad"; or "liberated from"
psychological and emotional disorders and fixations that cause one to
experience life with diminished spirit and joy and courage and
awareness?  (2)If "liberation" that "poetry" can be said to engender or
actualize IS/WERE the same kind that "psychotherapy" engenders and
actualizes, what kinds of poetries really do that as well as really
effective psychotherapies?  (The latter question is always especially
compelling to me, as I often see a great divide between effective
psychotherapies and conscientious psychotherapists who truly "guide
people" to greater liberation and awareness and consciousness and some
poetries and poets who, understandably, perhaps, do NOT seek to engender
"liberation" in the first place.  BUT I do not see why "charlatans" in
either "discipline" should be respected or emulated or rewarded,
either...)

See also O'Hara's monograph "Jackson Pollock," especially a brief

Experiment solitary touching appetite of union in bodies.

  293. It is certain that in all bodies there is an appetite of union, and
evitation of solution of continuity; and of this appetite there be many
degrees; but the most remarkable, and fit to be distinguished, are three.
The first in liquors; the second in hard bodies; and the third in bodies
cleaving or tenacious. In liquors this appetite is weak; we see in liquors
the threading of them in stillicides (as hath been said); the falling of
them in round drops (which is the form of union); and the staying of them
for a little time in bubbles and froth. In the second degree or kind, this
appetite is strong; as in iron, in stone, in wood, &c. In the third, this
appetite is in a medium between the other two: for such bodies do partly
follow the touch of another body, and partly stick and continue to
themselves; and therefore they rope, and draw themselves in threads; as we
see in pitch, glass, birdlime, &c. But note, that all solid bodies are
cleaving, more or less; and that they love better the touch of somewhat
that is tangible, than of air. For water, in small quantity, cleaveth to
any thing that is solid; and so would metal too, if the weight drew it not
off. And therefore gold foliate, or any metal foliate, cleaveth: but those
bodies which are noted to be clammy and cleaving, are such as have a more
indifferent appetite (at once) to follow another body, and to hold to
themselves. And therefore they are commonly bodies ill mixed: and which
take more pleasure in a foreign body, than in preserving their own
consistence; and which have little predominance in drought or moisture.

(from Francis Bacon, Sylva Sylvarum: or A Natural History, 1627)

( think of electrick fluid, magnetism, electrostaticks; think of mud or
other problematic 'objects' in Plato; of abjection; of Kristeva's Powers
of Horror; of Being and Nothingness (last sections); of the analogick; of
substance and its uncanniness; of the discrete and its imaginary. this has
always been with us, think of Visuddhimagga, highest tantra, think of
purification rites, scapegoats, abjections, dis/ease, dis/comfort, think
of anything unthought ... )

**Boog City
http://www.welcometoboogcity.com

Boog City is a New York City-based small press now in its 17th year and Eas=
t
Village community newspaper of the same name. It has also published 35
volumes of poetry and various magazines, featuring work by Allen Ginsberg
and Lawrence Ferlinghetti among others, and theme issues on baseball,
women=B9s writing, and Louisville, Ky. It hosts and curates two regular
performance series=8Bd.a. levy lives: celebrating the renegade press, where
each month a non-NYC small press and its writers and a musical act of their
choosing is hosted at Chelsea=B9s ACA Galleries; and Classic Albums Live,
where up to 13 local musical acts perform a classic album live at venues
including The Bowery Poetry Club, Cake Shop, CBGB=B9s, and The Knitting
Factory. Past albums have included Elvis Costello, My Aim is True; Nirvana,
Nevermind; and Liz Phair, Exile in Guyville.


**Dibson T. Hoffweiler
http://www.myspace.com/dibson

The latest in a long line of quirky anti-folk ingenues, including Beck, Ada=
m
Green, and Jeffrey Lewis, Dibs applies that time-honored tradition of
off-beat songwriting to his own private world of sugar factories, laundry
baskets, and ducks. With a low voice, both sweet and deadpan, and a
guitar-style both virtuosic and sloppy, Dibson Hoffweiler carves out a spac=
e
of compassion and intelligence in a landscape of boring love songs and
thinly veiled songwriterly misogyny.


**Huggabroomstik
http://www.huggabroomstik.com
http://myspace.com/lehuggacoustique

Huggabroomstik is not even really a band, it plays music and is 7 years old


**Poton
http://www.myspace.com/poton
http://myspace.com/deadrabbitmusic

While not walking his pet pig Oscar through the forest looking for winter
truffles with Cat Stevens blaring through his iPod, Poton (aka Adam Richard
Rudolf Ferretti) sits around in his hometown Staten Island abode crafting
songs about Zombies, not so endangered animals and the end of time, but
never ever love. Sometimes he plays with a band of Rabbits.


**Randi Russo
http://www.myspace.com/randirusso
http://www.randirusso.com

Randi Russo has ended up on the wrong side of the tracks=8Aat least when it
comes to her guitar playing. Her fingers ride and glide the rails of string=
s
of a right-handed guitar played upside-down and backwards. In other words,
this southpaw is not just taking a righty guitar and switching the strings
around, but keeps the guitar as is and just flips it over, so that the bass
strings are on the bottom. This style of playing is her foremost artistic
muse: It allows her to experiment in an organic way, resulting in unique an=
d
interesting chords. Randi's singing style is as equally intense and
beautiful as her guitar playing is edgy and unusual. The Village Voice has
called her a "guitar goddess" and has said that, "her guitar playing is
sweet when it needs to be, but nasty in all the right places. All she needs
is one gig opening up for someone like Cat Power and her fame is pretty muc=
h
guaranteed."

There is a toughness and tenderness in Randi's songwriting and performances
that has led to comparisons to fellow New Yorkers Lou Reed and Patti Smith.
Armed with gutsy songs and infectious melodies, she cuts deep with her
poignant, incisive lyrics. After a few overseas tours and shows in the U.S.=
,
Randi earned a spot at the Milwaukee Summerfest in 2004, playing alongside
main stage artists Crosby, Stills and Nash. She has shared bills with acts
such as Kimya Dawson, Adam Green, Jeffrey Lewis, and Regina Spektor, and ha=
s
also been on an Antifolk compilation along with cult hero Daniel Johnston.

Critics have been praising her latest release, Shout Like a Lady, mostly
commenting on her "provocative lyrics" (The Big Takeover) and "exceptional
vocals" (http://babysue.com). Randi plans on heading back into the studio
later this spring.


**So L=B9il
http://www.myspace.com/solil
http://goodbyebetter.com

So L'il are an ambient glam band from Brooklyn comprised of keyboards,
violins, drums, cut-ups, harmonies, guitars, bells, and fabulousness. They
like to explore the dreamlike spaces. Sometimes music to fall into,
sometimes music to have fun in.

In the last five years they have released a six-song self-titled EP, one
split 7-inch with the band Timesbold (both on Neko Records), and the
full-lengths 'Revolution Thumpin' and 'Dear Kathy,' (both on Goodbye
Better). In 2007 So L'il was featured on White Label Music's 'Electronic
Bible 3', and contributed three new tracks to the Goodbye Better compilatio=
n
Weird Terrain. They have just finished a new album, A Glittering Facade,
recorded at Emandee with Mark Ospovat, to be released in 2008.


**The Passenger Pigeons
http://myspace.com/rachelandrew

Andrew Phillip Tipton and Rachel E. Talentino are two birds who migrate
between Brooklyn and Staten Island. Their diet consists of nuts, fruits, an=
d
small insects. They exhibit lifelong partnership rituals and make fine quie=
t
music.  =20


**The Trouble Dolls
http://www.troubledolls.net/

Trouble Dolls are Cheri, Matty, and Chris. They play pop music. They are
from Brooklyn. They do not smoke. Their album "Sticky" is available on Half
a Cow Records. They thank you for coming to see them play.


**Todd Carlstrom and The Clamour
http://www.myspace.com/toddcarlstrom

After Todd Carlstrom recorded his solo album, Gold on the Map, it was clear
to him that the songs deserved more than to simply remain a studio project.
He set about recruiting members of the band that would become Todd Carlstro=
m
and The Clamour. TJ Farr, the usual bassist (not for this gig,
unfortunately), was contacted through MySpace. He managed to entice drummer
Eric Shaw of The Domestics into moonlighting. Guitarist Brian Elmquist, a
singer/songwriter from Georgia by way of Nashville, came on in early '08.
Their show expertly intertwines the poppy wrath of The Pixies, the classic
rock nods of Built to Spill, the rumbling slink of Sleater-Kinney, and,
occasionally, the odd stoner jam a la Brian Jonestown Massacre. Check out
songs from Gold at their above myspace page.

Wasn't the New York School of Poets called that because of its association =

Mystery deepens over German poet Schiller's skull
Mon May 5, 2008 1:10pm EDT

http://www.reuters.com/article/email/idUSL0537267920080505

BERLIN (Reuters) - A painstaking two-year investigation to determine
which of two skulls belonged to Friedrich Schiller has found neither
is a match, prolonging a 180-year-old mystery over the celebrated
German poet's remains.

A team of international experts came to their surprise conclusion
after comparing DNA samples from the two skulls in question to
material from the graves of the poet's relatives.

"The investigations into the relics which have been attributed to
Friedrich Schiller have proven that neither of the skulls is
authentic," said a statement released by the Weimar Foundation and MDR
broadcaster who had supported the research.

German anthropologists from Berlin and Freiburg had initiated the
project and earlier this year they exhumed the graves of several of
Schiller's family members in southern Germany.

The puzzle over the skull began in 1826, 21 years after Schiller died
when the mayor of Weimar had 23 skulls dug up from a mass grave in
which the poet was buried.

The mayor identified the biggest skull and one which bore a
resemblance to the dramatist's death mask as Schiller's and it was
brought to the home of his contemporary Goethe before being buried in
a crypt in the eastern city of Weimar.

Later, Goethe's tomb was placed next to Schiller's in the crypt which
still attracts about 41,000 visitors a year. Schiller had spent the
last years of his life in Weimar which is mostly famous for being
Goethe's home for almost 50 years.

However, in 1911, another skull was retrieved from the mass grave and
researchers claimed that was the real one, sparking a lengthy dispute
amongst academics, historians and anthropologists about the origin of
the two skulls.

It is now a mystery where the dramatist's skull is.

Schiller, who lived between 1759 and 1805, wrote plays which are still
performed regularly both in Germany and abroad. His poems including
the Ode to Joy which Beethoven set to music in his Ninth Symphony.

The team of experts came from institutions in Germany, Austria and the
United States.

But "the New York School" of the '50s was not only the abstract expressioni=

ed by Duchamp, figurative painters like Fairfield Porter and Larry Rivers (=
who were at some point lovers with Schuyler and O'Hara respectively), and s=

 of applying it to the poets, and he explains how it came about either in h=

Subject:      Ray Johnson & The New York School of Correspondance
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
Content-Disposition: inline

Ray Johnson found a way to "build a new society in the shell of the
old," by punningly linking the "High Culture" New York School with
"Low Class" "Correspondence Schools" and creating the New York School
of Correspondence (1962) , from which rapidly developed Mail Art, the
International Eternal Network.

"{Mail Art} has no history, only a present, which was a pun, of
course, on present as now, and present as gift.  A pun on my own way
of giving information and objects or whatever, in letter form."


Ray Johnson also created (1960) what he called' "nothings"--which are
"more about an attitude" than a "performance" per se.

Johnson attended Black Mountain College 1945-8, studying under Josef
Albers and Robert Motherwell.  Via friends and their friends from
Black Mountain days (all the usual suspects--), he became part of the
art-society scene in NYC, becoming known as "the most famous unknown
artist." of the time, in part for being a Pop Artist since the
mid-1950's, before Pop was "Pop."
(Except in England--where it wasn't yet called "Pop" either--as in the
works of Richard Hamilton, et alia--)


Johnson was attacked on 3 June 1968, the same day Valerie Solinas shot
Andy Warhol.  From then on, he lived outside NYC and became
increasingly reculsive, eventually fo9rbidding any public exhibitions
of his works, though still sending it out in large volume via the
mails.

Johnson created his life as a work of art in itself, and so
elaborately planned and staged his own death, jumping off a bridge on
13 January  Since his death, a myriad clues to it and concealed puns
and jokes regrading it have been found among the documents he left
behind for various friends.  His final testament and will being works
of art in themselves, "presents in the present" rather than "memento
mori."

Johnson developed on the most intricate and complexly referential
collage styles and bodies of works by any artist, and worked also in
creating "tesserae" starting in the late '50s. These are little blocks
made of layers of cardboard that are glued together, then painted and
sanded.  The combination of layering and sanding shapes the materials
and moves them from two dimensional "flats" into three dimensional
forms.  The painting and sanding afterwards also gives a much more
vibrant feel to the colors, in turn enhancing the senses of volumes,
giving the pieces a feeling of energy and mass that far exceeds their
small sizes.

An excellent--and hilarious and very moving-- introduction to Johnson
and his work is the six-years-in-making film How to Draw A Bunny.
Check it out-!

In relation with writing, poetry--Johnson was a pioneer of many
aspects of Conceptual Art (though definitely a lot funnier and more
imaginative and inventive than most of its rather solemn
practitioners--) in the ways which which he works and plays with the
interrelationships of images and words, often through elaborate series
of extended puns.

Internationally, Ray Johnson is one of the great ever present Beings,
with countless exhibitions, Mail Art Calls, "Nothings" events and
homages public and private pouring forth seemingly non-stop. His Bunny
image and "RayJay" logos and symbols of all sorts decorate postcards
and envelopes in continually active circulations, making him perhaps
the most mailed "person" in the world over the last roughly fifty
years.

Answers can be back or front channel, but going to be road-tripping
through the northwest, thinking of booking some dates and/or catching
some readings from folks I'd never have otherwise heard. Wondering
where the spots would be, and who the folks would be. This is around
the last week of June/ first week of July.

When I was referring to Stan Brackage in terms of poetry and Abstract
Expressionism is because Brackage consistently connects his "abstract
expressionist" quick moving, short films (a dart's instantaneous license) to
language, to specific titles. Most of them have commentaries, somewhat the
way mentions Grenier did with his poem drawings, which I also witnessed at
The Poetry Project. Brackage is very aware of the conflict between the eye
and the word. In relation to of of his pieces (it might be mothlight, but I
am not sure), he says that the word myth derived from the word mouth. He
wanted to create a myth completely made, expressed with the eye. That is to
say, in his "abstract expressionist" phantasmagoria, where the eye is forced
to move faster than the mind can absorb (mytholohize) he was trying to make
a conversion of the word into the visual.

That's my two bit at the moment.

Ciao,

Murat

"Absolute north" is to "guerilla outpost" as "love" and "antelope" are to
the bush they occupy: uniform urgency as overt as names on a skirt. The
range is an exercise, tame as a vase, and to talk is to occupy. In time, the
range is a plain without end, an envelope of light unable to injure itself.
Or an ostrich, and light becomes the uniform -lips, a skirmish between
what's open and what is tapping to loosen time.



The plan to explain is absolute, but only an entrance.

After spending a lovely evening with my friend CAConrad in Philly at the Hi=
ghwire Gallery in Fish Town, it has come to dawn upon me that CAConrad is n=
ot a poet, but a beautiful poem in the shape of a human being.

Thanks, Conrad. Be well until we meet again. Karen sends her love.

Jonathan Skinner and Ben Bedard
Wednesday, May 7th, 8pm

UB Green Environmental Library
220 Winspear Ave, UB South Campus
Buffalo, NY


Currently an assistant professor of environmental studies at Bates College,
UB Poetics grad and *ecopoetics* editor Jonathan Skinner will discuss
ecopoetics as well as read from the magazine and from his own work, on
Wednesday, May 7th at 8pm in the UB Green Environmental Library on the UB
South Campus.  As notions of personal and industrial "sustainability" gain
momentum and create a national agenda, ecopoetics can open up this discourse
to a much needed examination. Jonathan's talk will focus on "New Pastoral
Procedures: Objectivist to Noulipo." Buffalo poet Ben Bedard joins Jonathan,
in the discussion and the reading.


So where is the UB Green Environmental Library?

UB Green is located at 220 Winspear Avenue on the UB South Campus between
Bailey Ave. and Main St. If coming onto Winspear from Bailey, 220 Winspear
is the two story stone building on your right after the first stop sign.
Enter the building from the Rotary Road entrance and take the stairs to the
second floor. The library is at the top of the stairs. Parking is available
on the street and there is a bike rack outside the building.

Reading featuring Brenda Coultas & Jonathan Skinner

Thursday, May 8th, 7pm
Butler 210, Butler Library
Buffalo State College

Jonathan Skinner edits the review ecopoetics and Field Books, teaches
Environmental Studies at Bates College and lives in Bowdoinham, the tick
capital of Maine. His Political Cactus Poems are available through Palm
Press. His manuscript Wetlands, written in the Tifft Farm Nature Preserve,
is looking for a home.

Brenda Coultas is the author of The Marvelous Bones of Time (Coffee House
Press, 2007), Early Films, (Rodent Press 1996), and of A Handmade Museum
(Coffee House Press, 2003) which won the Norma Farber First Book Award from
The Poetry Society of America and a Greenwald grant from the Academy of
American Poets. She was a New York Foundation for the Arts Fellow in 2005.
Her poetry has been published in Brooklyn Rail, Encyclopedia, Conjunctions,
and in many other journals. Brenda Coultas lives in the East Village in
Manhattan.

Her latest book, The Marvelous Bones of Time, consists of two manuscripts
connected by an exploration of narrative, folklore, found materials and
place. This first section, The Abolition Journal is an investigation into
borders, namely the north-south border between Daviess County, Kentucky and
Spencer County, Indiana, where Abe Lincoln spent his boyhood.  The Abolition
Journal also explores what remains of past in the local idioms of her
county, for example, the sound and lost origins of the names of villages and
townships, the trace of 19th century Americana.

A Lonely Cemetery, the 2nd section, begins with an exploration of narrative,
namely the genre of the ghost story. For this project, Coultas collected
narratives of the weird and the haunted from her own experiences, found
materials, and interviews. She asked poets and friends to tell her a true
ghost tale. After a day or two, she would write the story from memory, so
that what is remembered may be exaggerated or distorted: in the manner of a
ghost story, the lucid details and the thrills remain.


The Rooftop Poetry Club was established in June 2005 to provide a creative
venue for writers of the Buffalo State College community. Through poetry
readings, open-mike events, workshops, and campus wide poetry projects, the
club has proven itself an invaluable forum for the campus writing community
and an asset to the entire college.

The layout of Butler Library is unique in that it contains a second-floor
center courtyard called the "Rooftop Garden." Those of you who are
unfamiliar with rooftop gardens may not appreciate the poetic nature of such
a space. But if you've ever sat up on a roof--away from the world, yet smack
dab in the middle of it all--you can surely see how one might be drawn to
read, write, and think in such a space. The rooftop garden is a perfect
meeting place for the Rooftop Poetry Club. Simply walk up the center steps
of the library to the second floor and look to your left--you'll see the
door leading you out to the rooftop.

One poet who was deeply involved in Ab Exp movement was the poet Weldon
Kees. He studied with Hans Hoffman and exhibted his work in group shows w/
Pollock. He was close to Clement Greenberg, who commissioned him for cover
art of Partisan Review. He also had a couple of solo exhibits in this late
40s-early 50s period (yes, his work was in ab ex style). A rather
fascinating figure he was also a filmmaker, jazz musician (who,like Pollock,
favored Chicago and swing styles) and sharp critic. His poetry, though
formalist, avoided much of the New Critic claptrap of the era and is a quite
interesting counterpoint to the open form movements of his day(University of
Nebraska publishes his collected poems) . He jumped off the Golden Gate
Bridge  in 1955.

Let's not forget that Robert Creeley was there, in the fist of it. I suspect
his unique way of tensing a line, and his ear for gravity, developed in
conversations with Abstract Expressionist painters.

 Add to this William Carlos Williams, whose love of the material world was
born from AE paintings.

A Meritage Press Announcement

A Pre-Release Special Offer for:

DISAPPOINTED PSALMS
Poems by Brian Clements
ISBN-13: 978-0-9794119-4-6
ISBN-10: 0-9794119-4-7
Price: $16.00
Release Date: Fall 2008
Distributors: Small Press Distribution, Amazon.com & www.MeritagePress.com


Meritage Press is delighted to announce the release of Disappointed
Psalms by Brian Clements.  This poetry collection is published as the
recipient of the Colombian Poetry Gift sponsored by Meritage Press.

After years of working exclusively in the prose poem, Brian Clements
shifts in Disappointed Psalms to short bursts, in turns raw and
lyrical, that turn the languages of war and religion, so frequently
aligned, against themselves.  Combining short phrases from The Book of
Psalms and catch phrases from the post-9/11 cultural reservoir with
Clement's own lamentations on lost faith, these short poems and the
litany that closes the book, like all the best political poems,
attempt to wrest the ability to make meaning from the hands of spin
doctors, liars, dissemblers and would-be builders of empire.

The following is an excerpt from Disappointed Psalms:


One who realizes he is not a believer
May clothe himself with curses as his cloak,

And he may set up the sign of ignorance
As his own sign.

But one who realizes he is a believer
May know you, Lord,

And he may set himself up as your creditor
And seize all that he can,

And he may set up shop
In your name.


Brian Clements is the author of several collections of poetry,
including And How To End It and Essays Against Ruin. He edits the
small press Firewheel Editions and its Sentence: A Journal of Prose
Poetics and coordinates the MFA in Professional Writing at Western
Connecticut State University.


PRE-RELEASE SPECIAL OFFER
To celebrate the release of Disappointed Psalms, Meritage Press is
pleased to offer a special disounted pre-release arrangement good
through June 30, 2008.  You may order the book for $12.00 (a 25%
discount from the book's $16 retail price) plus free shipping/handling
for orders throughout the United States.  (For non-U.S. orders, please
email us first at MeritagePress@aol.com.)  Send a check made out to

Dear Steve,

Thank you for your reply and good thoughts, explanations, elaboration.

Yeah, I suspect that "bad trips" are extremely bad and could/would
surely endanger even the "healthiest," "toughest," "most 'experienced'"
trippers and "explorers," especially as the stuff is, after all, "a
Chemical" (and essentially a "toxin") and obviously any "foreign"
chemicals can mess up
any human's brain and body chemistry.

I suspect it is also good, in some cases, to differentiate between "bad
trips" caused by crappy chemicals, really "bad acid," etc., and "bad
trips" labeled as such by the tripper...

Even "bad trips" caused by "bad acid" AND labeled as such by the tripper
could in some cases be "experienced"/interpreted as "meaningful" and/or
good or insightful experiences and trips, I'm sure, too...

My own hunch about your friend is that (1)to some extent he didn't have,
or desire, "a next plateau" to be opened to.  This in itself is
primarily just a metaphor or set of metaphors ("opening the door," "to
the next plateau").
Doesn't one have to perceive "things" as "plateaus," like plateaus of
consciousness or perception or "the Unconscious" or "the Soul" or
whatever before one would be inclined to describe "experience" as
occurring on different levels or plateaus of experiences?  And of course
the way one=20
describes it and or labels it ("experience") determines, limits,
expands,=20
enhances, diminishes "experience," too.  Also, your friend may indeed
have had all kinds of "levels" or plateaus available, but no
desire/interest/inclination to "access" or explore those "plateaus" or
any other psychological or perceptual or cognitive or aesthetic
"territories" via psychedelics.  (Like you point out, he did not,
himself, take the drug to get that kind of experience; he was not
inclined to "open himself to that kind of experience," and in his case,
though it may not be an option to a lot of folks, he was not going to
let the drug "control him" or, in other words, cause him to perceive
himself as being "out of control" (which doesn't say he wasn't out of
control, either, but only that he confidently and somewhat deliberately
and I believe quite factually perceived himself as being in control and
"only taking the drug to get high")).

I suspect that I was a lot like your friend -- taking the drug, and
mushrooms and peyote when I did them, mostly to "get high," or, let's
say,
ummmmm, really, really enhance some "visuals" and other VERY physical or

sensory sensations, intensify and distort "seeing," "hearing,"
"smelling," and such, "experience" the distortions in perceptions.  I
guess that if I wanted to "see God," then I would have approached that
objective more traditionally, and/or maybe tried a "Casdenada approach,"
too, but seeing God and other such cliche AND unique "mystical"
experiences did NOT hold any special appeal for me.  And I suppose that
if I had wanted to experience "higher" or "greater" self-awareness, then
I would have approached THAT objective via quite effective psychotherapy
techniques and commitments, the ones I like and respect, quite
consistently and definitely NOT employing drug-induced alterations or
modifications of mental states, as these things would, in most folks'
opinions, actually "limit" HOW genuinely and effectively one might
explore one's Unconscious mind and psyche.

Still, I suspect that I, like you AND your friend, took these drugs to=20
"take a trip," wherever it might go.  And I doubt that any of us ever=20
maintained any complete "control" over where these chemicals "took us"=20
or that we endeavored to maintain such "control."  I mean, surely, what
we desired, one way or another, was some particular "novelty" as regards
what can be "experienced" and "perceived" with these very powerful
neuro-receptor mixer-uppers, surely...  Even your friend, who wanted to
"get high," mostly, wasn't going to get that particularly "perceptual"
"high" from stuff like cocaine (which is in my opinion one of the
stupidest effing drugs out there and essentially the opposite of the
hallucinogens -- it gives some folks a great illusion, and definite
Delusion, that they are powerful and "in control" of their "powers" but
in the most self-destructive and delusionary manner possible; that is,
it rifles up extremely narcissistic "ego-control" and a very illusionary
sense that one's "self-control" is a powerful thing in the first place).
No, your friend was out for the Perceptual ride AND
whatever else went along with it, perhaps to some lessened effect than
you yourself might have gotten (because on some level of consciousness
or belief system indeed it was going to be ONLY to "get high,"
essentially).  But didn't all of us, one way or another, indeed seek "a
ride" that we couldn't get any other way, period?  That's what I think.

Ummmm, I must confess: I never took any kind of drug like that when I
very definitely knew that I might be "vulnerable" to any kind of severe
or dangerous emotional or psychological crisis.  Perhaps because I had
been studying Psychology, and especially psychotherapy and clinical
psychology and psychiatry and emotional disturbance and emotional
well-being, I was likely quite cognizant of the dangers involved in
approaching "emotional distress" and potential crisis via any kind of
very dangerous drug use or intake, or perhaps I was just timid and
simply feared further aggravating emotional pain.  In fact, most of my
life I've never even "drank" in response to emotional distress,
depression, pain, suffering.  And I've had plenty...  But (1)I don't
believe in those kinds of reactions to psychological and emotional pain;
(2)I don't "trust" those kinds of reactions; (3)My interpretations of
"suffering" is that it is=20
an integral and authentic part of one's life experience and in fact an
especially necessary and inevitable marker that one is truly living an
authentic and fully courageous life, that one is genuinely actualizing
as much of one's potential to live a full and meaningful life as one
can; (4)I of course was privvy to much more effective and truly powerful
methods of=20
dealing with emotional distress and depression (namely therapy, though
most of early life, I could not afford it, sadly), AND I was always
determined to
be self-reliant and try to resolve things myself, NOT with some foreign
substance that took my own powers away from me.  Like your friend, and
yes plenty in my time, I have always only taken drugs of any kind,
including alcohol and reefer, and I've had plenty of both, as well as
other things, to get "high," though that kind of "high" has grown
increasingly "old" and not particularly interesting to me most of the
last decade or two.  (And even in my mid-twenties, when my favorite
high, next to reading/insight and sex, was surely "running," most all
drugs were particularly boring and uninteresting and thus avoided most
of the time.)  But jeepers, LSD and mushrooms, and even marijuana, to
some extent sure have been "fun" and interesting and even fascinating to
a whole bunch of us, haven't they?  Certainly to me they have been (and
still are on occasion, who knows)...

Hey, Steve D., Thank you for your response to my second post, and if you
get a chance or the spirit moves ya, perhaps respond to other
thots/questions that the topic brought up for me.  There's a lot of
poetics "territory" worth exploring there, in my opinion.  I am, for
example, interested in approaching "the worth" and "merit" of, to be
quite direct, "poetry" produced by alcoholics and other addicts, or
poetry produced under the influence of alcohol and drugs if such
chemicals could be said to have diminished (OR "enhanced") such things
as "courage," "authenticity," "compassion," "clear-mindedness" (for
what, Ha, THAT might be worth, but seriously, it's NOT a joke, either
and too), and the like. =20

Now, I know that this whole line of inquiry might seem very peculiar and
even "provocative."  Think about it -- would you "Trust" a
psychotherapist or analyst who was drunk or stoned all the time, or who
was "irresponsible" and spent most of his/her existence getting numbed
and wrecked or neglecting spouse or children or paycheck provider?  Naw,
probably not, and such a jerk wouldn't/couldn't possibly be half as
effective or conscientiousness or valuable to you as others who go
through life more courageously and caringly and brightly.  Okay, we're
talking poetry, though, right?  Isn't that something one does outside of
the world of "self-actualization" and more for "the fun of it," for
"aesthetic pleasure(s)," for "entertainment" (some of which is
nonetheless more "authentic" and "truthful" than other "Entertainments"
are, mind you, and Life IS short, after all), and for other things that
mostly satisfy more "artistic" than, say, "psychological" needs and
desires.  Heck, isn't psychotherapy and psychiatry for, Yes, assisting
individuals in becoming more true to themselves and "authentic," so if
that's the case, then for some poets "being MORE true to themselves, and
by extention more True to others and more TRUE in their aesthestic
creations" might in fact mean, PARODOXICALLY, getting really
self-destructive and "high" and "drunk" and "stoned" and thus producing
"art" that could ONLY HAVE BEEN PRODUCED by someone courageous enough to
sacrifice certain "psychological or emotinal well-being" for their
"art." =20

There are or would be, and always will be, all kinds of parodoxes and
contradictions and ironies and the lot here.  It IS no mere coincidence
that the vast majority of artists and poets throughout time have been
MORE likely to have experienced life under the influence of drugs and
alcohol, to have experienced "the further reaches of humankind" (i.e.,
more extreme emotional and psychological states and "limits"), and to
have produced their "arts" in fact BECAUSE they have had, or developed,
the courage to explore those exceptional states and "limits" or
otherwise "express their authentic Being," which were to some extent
only accessible and expressible via creating art objects.  Personally, I
am quite sure that the majority of really good, AND really "new," and
really worthwhile poming in the last 30 years has been produced by quite
responsible and generally quite "sober" and un-"addicted" pomers.  (And
then, some of the most respected pomers of the last 30 years sat around,
got really stoned, and simply "played" and developed quite revered
poetries as a result, so what's the beef, maybe...)  And as one older
poet and mentor said to me some years ago, the thought that one has to
go out and endlessly reproduce self-destructive lifestyles or patterns
or habits, or be fucked up and wrecked or drunk all the time, or relive
old, depressed and self-hating emotional states, in order to produce art
or do something unique or access useful creative abilities or engage in
commendable art production is an old cliche and stupid myth... =20

I think this all goes further, though.  And I don't think that I'm the
only one who wrestles with these kinds of concerns and questions.
Gabriel Gudding over at his blog _Earth and Pragmatism_, for example,
has been doing some really excellent writing/thinking about what he
calls "A Rationale for Writing Poetry with a Kind Mind" (See
http://gabrielgudding.blogspot.com/2008/02/rationale-for-writing-with-ki
nd-mind.html).  I find a lot of his thinking very compelling in this
area.

And personally I have opined for some time (admittedly like a complete
pedestrian and boor at times, I'm sure) that the truly "new" in coming
years will attend more to matters of "content" and "substance" than
matters of "form."  This may sound quite naive and silly and dumb -- I'm
sure most pomers don't fiddle with divisions between Form and Content,
and Yeah, so much compelling poming is pure Substance often BECAUSE it's
majestically, or even "defiantly," opaque, "difficult," more formal than
material -- but I still cannot keep from coming back to such "concerns,"
so at least for me there's a lot that needs to be resolved and explored
and investigated...

Dear Barry Murat & Tom:

The Fall 1963 Film Culture issue number 30 is a Brakhage issue in its
entirety and concludes with an appropriately huge, long letter called
"Eastern Conference" written by Brakhage to his wife Jane on 17
May1963, recounting in great detail his first meeting and into the
night/morning conversation with Charles Olson in Gloucester. The
letter is written at two different points of time on the following
day, so that the second section becomes more exposition of ideas than
the first, which essays to get a sense more direct of the actual
spoken conversations. (Brakhage had gone there in company of poet
Gerrit Lansing.)

Olson confronts Brakhage with the question of "FOCUS."  Brakhage is
startled to discover that Olson is reminding him ("stop trying to
defend the fact that you are, indeed, myopic") that the film maker,
like the poet, is near-sighted; Olson noting that Brakhage had thrown
away his glasses at age 18.)

{"Myo Pics Shortsighted Stop Gap"  was a headline in old spoofs of
Variety i used to make to go with "reviews" of non-existent films,
which in a sense is a way of making the films exist.}

The discussion is, to be sure given the participants, very
"wide-ranging," and reads now like a deep dive into an "oceanic"
language--very much in the spirit of the times and persons--in which
Myth and Magic , Duncan's Adam, Jesus and the economic situations of
the arts are swirling about, with the near-sighted artists, via a
remark of Brakhage's re Lascaux, finding (near-sighted) Focus in
Olson's disquisitions of Pleistocene humans painting with faces close
to cave walls.

{While reading the letter, I kept reframing it in my head as a piece
by Robert Smithson, using something like the methods of "A Tour of the
Monuments of Passaic, N.J." applied to the flowing masses of materials
here . . . Smithson's "art if is to be art needs to a container,"
though, not unlike Olson's "Limits are what any of us are inside of,"
that Creeley writes of in an early essay.)

Brakhage is very intrigued that Olson has told him that "With you
Brakhage it is at this point a question of focus--it is not?"  This
perception of Olson's re Brakhage's focus of perception seems
implicitly to border on the question of magic, which is never very far
from Brakhage's thoughts throughout the conversation, although he does
confess in the letter being careful not to raise the issue too much.
The issue does come to the fore at the conclusion--in the letter--of
the exchange, echoing the earlier discussion of "temptation":  "You
are not a black magician--you are white magician," Olson says, "and
that is a very difficult, dangerous thing to be in a time like this .
. . I mean how much we are each of us drawn to evil in such a time,
how easy it is, how each of us falls into all ways, that is because of
all the ways."

This cautionary statement echoes an earlier observation of Olson's.
Prior to the "focus on focus" so to speak, Olson, taking off from
Brakhage's critique of drama and the loss of masks, says, "Yes, we
must, must get rid of drama, at all costs--I mean, even get rid of
narrative--the temptation, you hear?"


Olson also critiques the continual uses of puns, "that dispersal of my
newer writing," in Brakhage's writing, advising to "keep it simple"
(Brakhage's words) "Keep focused," so to speak--though given the way
in which both Brakhage and Olson seem in conversation at least, to use
focus as a way of creating a hole through the object, and entering
into an opening out, as in cave exploration, the focus seems to
continual "take off"as it were into the mythic and magic.

The emphasis on ridding one of the temptations of "evil," not to
mention puns, narrative and drama, is the spiritual undertow that
seems to be pulling both artists towards myth, and for Brakhage at the
time, magic. (More specifically, Duncan's conceptions of it as well as
Tolkien's.)
And also for Olson, psylocibin and various Hopi and Maya examples.

All the while that the artists discuss artefacts and Olson hauls some
actual ones out of various heaps, the conversation and account are
turning into an artefact in themselves, their language, references,
allusions, concerns, at once flowing in time and preserved in amber.
An Anarkeyology of the mind and eye operate simultaneously as an
opening of a cave as it were into the past and at the same, a Tour of
the monuments.

The dismissal of the puns by Olson fortunately Brakhage doesn't pay
attention to--as puns are openings as much as cave mouths for sure, or
Black Holes to elsewheres.

As a piece of writing, the letter is very interesting, to me at any
rate, in terms of the continual punning, the continual digressions on
digressions, the wanting to get things "write/right," and at the same
time as one essays fixing them ,seeing them begin to move off,
elusively--indeed, for Brakhage, take off into the skies which can be
a bug close up observed or the Dog Star.  (Olson had his Dog Town and
Brakhage his Dog Star Man.)  Brakhage's writing is a form of charting
a journey into Vision as it is happening, making it perhaps
"allegorical" more by far than "dramatic."  In that since of "as it is
happening" it's also not unlike Bataille's conception of the recit,
which includes the allegorical Vision-Voyages of Moby Dick and
Rimbaud's A Season in Hell.  Read as kind of distant Prelude to the
first edition of the Brakhage Lectures (1972, with a Forward by
Creeley) one' s very much struck with the ways in which Brakhage
continually is working not only with Vision in all its senses, but
also with writing.  Mnay of the devices in embryo in this letter and
others of Brakhages' early texts, find themselves put to an ever
widening range of explorations and adventures in the self-awareness
they continually reflect on while indeed providing their own versions
of the recit.

A kind of dream for me at the time, I got to meet Brakhage some great
time ago and talk about writing and film with him, except[t the kind
we spoke of was in a sense at three "[superimposition" as it were.
That is, I was taking some lines of Rimbaud from various poems and
prose pieces, as images, and filming them as not a
"description/illustration" but a crude form of "illumination" in the
various senses of the word.  On top of the images then one proceeds to
scratch, burn, make small tears and holes in the film itself, to in a
sense make even more present a sense of "Illumination" by "light
flowing through the darkness," "light coming in from the outside" and
so forth.  Take an image, series of them of a burning chemical fire at
a dump, and then burn through into the film--or slashes creating
flashes and the like.  If the Word can be made flesh, then why not the
film itself?  The film as a skin or membrane of vision and at the same
time an obstruction in a sense--

So did tearing and burning constitute a wounding, a form of "cutting"
with the "cuts" made by editing,which must then be "sutured"--turning
the cinema into a form of operating theater so to speak--

From there we got into discussing fire itself, looking into fire, as a
way of finding images, flickerings, castings of shadows, dance of
elongated and abruptly shortened forms and the continual alteration of
colors, an example of a form of creation that lives not only via
destruction but as its own self destruction, its "all consuming
desire" in the end extinguishing it--leading to discussion of stars.

I hadn't thought of this conversation until today writing this, which
is rather odd as of about a year have started using burning and
cutting in paintings--in fact a series working on oflate--sevral are
in the new issue of Otoliths)--is called the Cinema of Catharsis--

(Issue 30 of Film Culture has layout by George Maciunas, with a wide
strip at top on front saying Film Culture and wrpping around to on
back  Fluxus  ad stapled to corrugated cardboard cover, with on the
front a hole through which one sees the silvery negative print eye of
Brakhage's face, this page followed by the positive of the image--his
face in both cases taking up the page entire--)

Since May 1st, I've been posting poems on Ariel Gordon's May Day Poems
blog, along with a number of other Canadian writers. Lately, through
reading Sarah Manguso, and thinking of other poets such as Juliana Spahr
and Lisa Jarnot I've read over the past couple of years, I've been
thinking on the sentence, wanting to work lines without relying as
heavily on the line break; the straight line that isn't necessarily
straight. Here's what I posted to Gordon's May Day today, part of an
ongoing larger group of pieces.

I think the contemporary distinction between "expressionist" and
"conceptualist" is problematic.   I invest a degree of emotional energy
in some of the most "procedural" works I compose.  I don't think I want
to compose "coolly"-though this might be fun to try.  And the
distinction between the mental phenomena of a mind structured by
language and an idea that occurs to that mind and acts on a medium in
the world-an arbitrary distinction.  The a.e. movement had something to
link the two. =20

And three cheers for the grotesque beauty of outsider sloppiness.=20

Dear Hooligans,

The wars have changed, but the appetite for images in America has not. The Widow Party comprises a Buffalo Bill dumb show at the end of time, a rootin' tootin' aeschatology with sound effects by Jacob Knabb and a soundtrack by the Genius Child Orchestra, featuring Pentagon-bankrolled expert commentary by Britney Spears.

As Walt Disney has observed, it's easier to imagine the end of the world than the end of capitalism.

The main action of The Widow Party was scripted by Johannes Göransson, based on visions revealed in a semi-comatose conflation after a carcrash following a hazardous homejourney after the 2007 MLA. With Joyelle McSweeney and Jen Karmin in a pas de deux for the miracle twins Hannie Oakley and Annie Weiner, and Patrick Durgin performing a Declamation which will be an explanation and evaluation of all that has come before. With two Widows, a Reporter, Crash, Walter Cronkite, You, Satchmo, Lisa Janssen and James Shea in alarming and supporting roles.

Please extinguish.

At the conclusion of the performance, time will also conclude.

The core artists (Pollack, Kline, Newman, Still, Rothco, etc.)  which
constituted the abstract expressionism movement
primarily eschewed the concept of figuration as well as representation.

Poet such as Ashbery, Creeley, O'Hara and others mentioned , while
transcending what was considered the 'norm' of poetry,

 never sought to make their poetry into works of total abstraction; at least
not in the ways that the visual artists endeavored to portray.

Poets I had in mind were ones similar to those included in the Imagining
Language book edited by Jed Rasula and Steve McCaffery.

But I guess the question is: can poetry actually 'not' represent, insofar as
it is a written medium, no matter how it is presented?

I think of John Cage and his theory of representation and association. It
then becomes an issue of  relativity to the individual apprehending

the medium in question.no?

however abstract images may be, they are particular and concrete in a way
that only language need not be.

images are extrordinarily helpful in understanding mathematics but they
cannot negotiate its generality, the extent of its abstraction.

image begins to change to language when an image begins to lose its
particularity and become a placeholder for a class.

art of language+image is forever exploring the borders between the concrete
and abstract, the tipping points of the particular into the general, the
'real' into the 'imaginary', the simultaneous instants when a cigar is just
a cigar and when it is not.

MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=iso-8859-1

Hello, all!

In case you're interested, there will be some (I
humbly submit) top-notch satirical music in the Bay
Area over the next few days, songwriting that's worth
announcing on a poetics list.

The Prince Myshkins (of which I happen to comprise
one-half) perform harmonically complex, wordy, funny,
thought-provoking songs in an attempt to link and
simply squash together unlikely combinations of issues
(employing guitar and accordion to do so). Charlie
King is an old-time social justice folk singer who
writes some of the most emotionally complex political
songs I've heard, simultaneously ridiculous, deeply
moving, full of great stories and surprising ethical
positions. Roy Zimmerman is perhaps the only
rhymesmith since Tom Lehrer to equal the master's
craft, and is a magnificent live performer.

The three of us will play three shows, and then
Charlie and the Myshkins will do one more. We'll be
sitting in on each others' songs, adding harmonies and
theatrics, cracking each other up with
meticulously-rehearsed precision.

I don't really write the songs. Therefore, you can
trust me as a comparatively neutral observer when I
give this music high praise. It'll be a fine series of
evenings.

 ABOUT THE BOOK

Boringkén

Ediciones Callejón / La Tertulia (San Juan)
2008

Boringkén is a book of poems with rock/poetry  CD, the latest collaboration between Urayoán Noel (Las flores del mall; Kool Logic) and composer Monxo López (Spanic Attack). It's a text-sound hybrid, a pro-forma performance: Boringkén is the (com)promised land of tourists in tedium ("the boring Barbie with her boring Ken!"), impossible cities, botched tropics, terrorists in walkups, and leather-clad bankers. Seventeen poems that oscillate between litany and parody, between the stage and the stanza, tuned to electrobeats and lounge-plena. It's postpunk poetry for the shopworn masses.

On the 60th anniversary of the founding of the state of Israel, I think about the incredible founding of the state against all odds, and also the terrible losses that it meant for Palestinians. I also go back to the poetry of Yehuda Amichai, indisputably one of Israel's most important poets. As the celebrations ensue, the fireworks and flags, I think of the complex portrait that Amichai paints in this little poem, "Jerusalem," about what fireworks and flags distract us from.

"Jerusalem"

On a roof in the Old City
laundry hanging in the late afternoon sunlight,
the white sheet of a woman who is my enemy,
the towel of a man who is my enemy,
to wipe off the sweat of his brow.

In the sky of the Old City,
a kite.
At the other end of the string,
a child
I can't see
because of the wall.

We have put up many flags,
they have put up many flags.
To make us think that they're happy.
To make them think that we're happy.

(by Yehuda Amichai, from The Selected Poetry of Yehuda Amichai, translated by Chana Bloch and Stephen Mitchell).

Teacher fired for refusing to sign loyalty oath

http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-oath2-2008may02,0,6280956.story

LET GO: =93I wanted it on record that I am a pacifist,=94 Wendy Gonaver =20=

said. She wants an apology and a teaching job for next year.
Cal State system ousts another instructor who objects on religious =20
grounds to a pledge adopted by California in 1952 to root out =20
communists.

When Wendy Gonaver was offered a job teaching American studies at Cal =20=

State Fullerton this academic year, she was pleased to be headed back =20=

to the classroom to talk about one of her favorite themes: protecting =20=

constitutional freedoms.

But the day before class was scheduled to begin, her appointment as a =20=

lecturer abruptly ended over just the kind of issue that might have =20
figured in her course. She lost the job because she did not sign a =20
loyalty oath swearing to "defend" the U.S. and California =20
constitutions "against all enemies, foreign and domestic."

The loyalty oath was added to the state Constitution by voters in 1952 =20=

to root out communists in public jobs. Now, 16 years after the =20
collapse of the Soviet Union, its main effect is to weed out religious =20=

believers, particularly Quakers and Jehovah's Witnesses.

As a Quaker from Pennsylvania and a lifelong pacifist, Gonaver =20
objected to the California oath as an infringement of her rights of =20
free speech and religious freedom. She offered to sign the pledge if =20
she could attach a brief statement expressing her views, a practice =20
allowed by other state institutions. But Cal State Fullerton rejected =20=

her statement and insisted that she sign the oath if she wanted the job.

"I wanted it on record that I am a pacifist," said Gonaver, 38. "I was =20=

really upset. I didn't expect to be fired. I was so shocked that I had =20=

to do this."

I've been meaning to add Abraham Lincoln Gillespie, my favorite
abstract writer of the early 50s...  Tho dismissed by many as a Joyce
imitator, his approach to language in the 40s & 50s is really in a
world by itself.  The Syntactic Revolution (Out of London Press, 1970)
is well worth the buy if you find one hiding in a bookstore.

& thanks to Joel L for the Weldon Kees nod.  Led me to a detailed New
Yorker article on his disappearance & life...

Nope. Williams was tight with the first generation American
modernists, gathered around Stieglitz' two galleries. Though a couple
of them were abstractionists--Hartley for a few years, Dove most of
the time--none of them were much like the abstract expressionists.
Closer, many of them, to Cubism, including the realist Charles
Demuth, a close friend of WCW. The Whitney did an exhibit it must be
twenty years ago, WCW and the American Scene 1920-1940. The excellent
catalogue is still around.

What are you complaining about? Of course, it's hard on the dog, and prett=
y soon rape
and murder will be "art", too, and equally hard on its victims, but it's a=
ll according to the
express theory of postmodern "art" that "anything is art that anyone says =
it is". If you
want to stop the silly progression, you have to stop adhering to the silly=
 theory.

So, is anything art that anyone says is art, or are there some things that=
 just aren't art?
And if starving a dog to death in a museum is not art, WHY is it not art i=
f the artist says
it is?

I notice that there are no traceable sources for your account of the "dog e=
xhibition" (including no source for the quotation from the artist). This is=
 consistent with all the e-mails I have been getting about this over the la=
st few weeks. Wikipedia does have a fairly well-sourced account from which =
I quote this:=0A=0AIn 2007 Guillermo Vargas took a stray dog from the stree=
ts of Managua, Nicaragua, and tied it to a short leash in an art gallery, t=
itling his exhibit "Eres Lo Que Lees" ("You Are What You Read"). Photograph=
s appeared on the Internet showing a emaciated dog, tied to a wall by a len=
gth of rope in a room full of standing people, with the title of the exhibi=
t written on the wall in dog food. The outrage triggered by the exhibit spa=
wned allegations that the dog, had been left to starve to death; these alle=
gations quickly spread internationally via blogs, e-mails, and other unconf=
irmed sources. However, other than a three-hour period during which the dog=
 was on display as part of Vargas' exhibit, the gallery alleges the dog was=
 not tied up, and was fed with food brought in by Vargas himself. There are=
 no indications in the photos of where or when they were taken, nor of who =
took them. Juanita Berm=C3=BAdez, the director of the C=C3=B3dice Gallery, =
was quoted in La
 Prensa as saying that the animal was fed regularly and was only tied up fo=
r three hours on one day before it escaped. Upon conducting a probe, the Hu=
mane Society was informed that the dog was in a state of starvation when it=
 was captured and escaped after one day of captivity; the Humane Society al=
so acknowledged, in reference to reports that the dog had been starved to d=
eath, "the facts [had] been misconstrued in some news articles"; however, t=
he organization also categorically condemned "the use of live animals in ex=
hibits such as this." =0AThis matter was brought to the attention of the Wo=
rld Society for the Protection of Animals (WSPA), who investigated the issu=
e found it had enough merit to take action, and are satisfied that no anima=
ls will be abused during the upcoming Biennial, exhibition.=0A=0AGo to http=
://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guillermo_Vargas for the complete enty with citati=

 as art for a long time. Both Richard Serra and Jannis Kounellis, for examp=
le, exhibited live horses in galleries in the late '60s. Gino de Dominicis =
presented a person with Down's Syndrome under the title Second Solution of =
Immortality: The Universe Is Immobile at the Venice Biennale in 1972, a wor=
k that was recreated after the death of de Dominicis by the Wrong Galley (M=

Remembering the Nakba during Israel's 60th anniversary

Today, Jews around the world are celebrating the 60th anniversary of
the founding of the state of Israel. These celebrations reflect the
understandable joy of Jews who view Israel as the symbol of 60 years
of freedom from centuries of persecution, culminating in the
Holocaust. Nevertheless, not all Jews will be celebrating.

Download Fact Sheets Now

What was the Nakba? Who are the Mizrachi Jews? Was there a population
exchange between Middle Eastern Jews and Palestinians? Find out the
answers to these questions and more in our fact sheets written by
Sephardic scholar Ilise Cohen. Go to our online Nakba resource center
to get your fact sheets now.

While Israel provided a safe haven for countless Jewish refugees who
had nowhere else to go, many of them members of our own families, the
terrible fact is that over 700,000 Palestinians were made into
refugees to make room for the future state of Israel. Sixty years and
several generations later, that number has swelled to an estimated 7
million. Many live in 58 registered refugee camps dispersed throughout
the Middle East, and some 4 million Palestinians in the Occupied
Territories continue to endure reprehensible collective punishment to
this day.

That is why the creation of the state of Israel, an occasion marking
great celebrations for many Jews throughout the world, is known as the
Nakba, or the Catastrophe, to Palestinians.

And that is why many of us will not be celebrating, for as long as
Palestinians are still fighting for their fundamental human rights, we
can not rejoice.

Any peaceful future depends on recognizing both the Palestinian and
the Israeli narrative. And yet, just as the names of over 400 pre-1948
Palestinian towns and cities have been deliberately erased from maps,
the history of the Palestinian Nakba itself has been all but erased
from consciousness.

At Jewish Voice for Peace, we cannot participate in celebrations that
erase both the history and modern-day injustices experienced by
Palestinians. It is precisely this rendering invisible of Palestinian
experience and claims for justice that makes reconciliation between
Israelis and Palestinians impossible. We choose instead to remember,
to know, and to work towards justice and self-determination for both
peoples. As Jews and Palestinians, our pasts are intertwined, and so
too are our futures.

Today, because much of the world has forgotten, we remember that:

In April, 1948, the same month as the infamous massacre at Deir
Yassin, Plan Dalet was put into operation. It authorized the
destruction of Palestinian villages and the expulsion of the
indigenous population outside the borders of the state.

On May 22, 1948, Jewish soldiers from the Alexandroni Brigade entered
the house of Tantura residents killing between 110-230 Palestinian
men.

On October 28, 1948, in the village of Dawayameh, near Hebron,
Battalion 89 of the 8th Brigade occupied the village. Israeli soldiers
said of the massacre that babies... skulls were cracked open, women
raped or burned alive in houses, men stabbed to death. 145 men, women
and children were killed. Over 450 went missing, of which 170 were
women.

Commemorate the Nakba: Mother's Day Action

JVP has joined with Adalah-NY in this action asking mothers to sign
this letter urging a Mother's Day boycott of notorious illegal
settlement builder and  diamond dealer Lev Leviev.

Under the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, every person "has the
right to leave any country, including his own, and to return to his
country."  Israel has never accepted the legitimacy of this basic
human right as a basis for peace negotiations, whether by return,
compensation, or resettlement.  Surely it is now time to acknowledge
the narrative of the other, the price paid by another people for
European anti-Semitism and Hitler's genocide.  As the late Palestinian
intellectual Edward Said emphasized, "Like it or not, this is the
historical reality. We must better understand them, and they must
better understand us. We must make clear the link between the Shoah
(the European Jewish Holocaust) and the Nakba (the Palestinian
catastrophe of 1948). Neither experience is equal to the other, and
neither should be minimized."

Many of us will not celebrate as long as Israel continues to violate
international law, inflicts a monstrous collective punishment on the
civilian population of Gaza, and continues to deny to Palestinians
their human rights and national aspirations.

We will celebrate when Arab and Jew live as equals in a peaceful Middle East.

Jim,

You are focusing on a very crucial issue. I will propose a reverse concept:
the visual is a space (maybe a meditative one, at the edge of language)
where the syntactical, semantic and other classifications of language do not
enter. In that way it (the visual) may be a less concrete space than
language is. It is important to distinguish between two opposing extremities
in the concept of an image. On the one side, there are forces pushing  the
image to become a "logo," specific, possessive, manipulative, finally
leading towards commerce, fixed reactions, political power. On the other
side, one case what I would call "photographic image," which is porous,
elusive opening spaces through which a mental dialogue can occur.

Ciao,

Murat

You may like this PBS special airing Sunday night about the rise of
Middle Eastern-American comedy. It was shot over 3 years and they
profile 5 of us in it.
It airs nationally this Sunday at 10:00 PM on PBS in NYC, LA, and DC
and different times in other markets.
Hope you are well!

 Breaking down stereotypes one joke at a time
 It's an age-old American tradition: immigrant groups take up comedy
to fight against discrimination. One path to understanding is to make
people laugh. Now Muslim-Americans have come forward to help dismantle
the stereotypes and hatred that have surged since September 11, 2001.
 STAND UP: Muslim American Comics Come of Age is the story of five
comedians: Ahmed Ahmed, Tissa Hami, Dean Obeidallah, Azhar Usman and
Maysoon Zayid.
 Tissa Hami performs part of
her comedy routine in the
traditional Muslim hijab
 Each of these artists felt the aftershock of 9/11 personally. At a
time when people of Middle Eastern origin were advised to lay low,
they all chose to stand up - and tell jokes.  This film explores how
they are responding to 9/11, each in a different way, but all using
humor to define who they are.
 STAND UP is the story of Ahmed's battle to get beyond playing
"Terrorist No. 4."  It's about Obeidallah's journey to discover his
Arab heritage.  It's about Zayid's resolve to turn being "a
Palestinian Muslim woman virgin with cerebral palsy from New Jersey"
into a career asset.  It's about Usman's quest to become the Muslim
comedy role model he himself never found.  It's about Hami's
determination to challenge American conceptions about Muslim women.
 "We can't define who we are on a serious note because nobody will
listen.
 The only way to do it is to be funny about it."
 - Ahmed Ahmed
 From false arrests to death threats, these comics face challenges
from both mainstream America and within the Muslim community. All are
at critical points in their careers, each evolving differently as a
comic. But they are all striving for one thing: to break through the
typecasting and achieve mainstream comedy success.
 Following in the footsteps of comics such as Lenny Bruce, Richard
Pryor, George Lopez, and Margaret Cho, they are using stand-up comedy
to make the case for Arab and Muslim inclusion in the American "public
square."
 Above all, STAND UP: Muslim American Comics Come of Age is an
American story. Which means almost anything is fair game for a laugh.

Huh?  Is this confused response, and your double use of the word "silly", "=

I'm not sure the comparison between Serra using a horse in his exhibit vers=
us Habacuc's use of a starved dog is valid, especially as the circumstances=
 of the latter are dubious, at best, and any details about Serra's use are =
omitted.  While I notice influence between artists, I don't usually compare=
 works of art based on "materials", or in this case, animals used to create=
, or actually "be", the exhibit.  I can, though, say that I am against the =
inhumane treatment of people and animals for any purpose, including enterta=
inment and for "art's sake".  This "treatment" also includes non-treatment.=
  If you assume the responsibility of caring for a domestic animal, that in=
cludes getting it help if needed -- especially help that consists of the ba=
sic necessities.   If Serra and the others you list treated the animals in =
their exhibits humanely, then I guess I'd have to finally see the exhibit t=
o respond and offer my judgment.   As for "exhibiting" or turning
 someone into a spectacle based on their having a disability, I'd seriously=
 question the ethics of the "artist".   Society does that enough without us=
ing galleries.  That it's already been done doesn't somehow render it valid=
.  =0A=0AIn the case of my posting, I noted that the circumstances were unc=
lear around Habacuc's use of this stray dog, especially regarding how he ac=
tually treated the dog.   Unfortunately, my hyperlinks didn't come through:=
  http://www.euroweeklynews.com/news/6831.html, and I'll post a string of o=
thers below.   I can't find Habacuc's original blog post, though it suppose=
dly appeared on his Myspace page, now defunct.  If true, it was one of the =
main impetuses for the internet buzz, if one counts how many blog posters n=
oted it.  Habacuc has made several statements since the initial alleged sta=
tement appeared, mostly defending his "political" use of the dog and noting=
 that he doesn't have to say if the dog died or escaped.  He especially emp=
hasizes that it would have died anyway ...  If this logic works, why not ju=
st put a sickly homeless person on display and give her a sandwich in secre=
t?  She'd be homeless, hungry, and possibly ill anyway, right?  Or what abo=
ut
 a malnourished baby in a crib in a gallery?  Lots of babies all over the w=
orld are malnourished -- would this bring helpful attention to the cause?  =
=0A=0ABased on things I've seen written on the site, I would hesitate befor=
e using Wikipedia as a source to prove anything.  I might try Snopes (http:=
//www.snopes.com/critters/crusader/vargas.asp)  or  Hoax Slayer (http://www=
.hoax-slayer.com/starving-dog-art.shtml), which both determined that the cl=
aim is ultimately disputed, as originally pointed out in my first post thou=
gh the link to my easily-googled article didn't come through.   But does do=
ubt mean Habacuc gets a free pass, and I should not draw attention to this =
petition?  =0A=0AAnd finally, a note I wrote on another list:    I figured =
regardless of the final truth, the photos and the various versions of the s=
tory around the "display" amount to a terrible=0Aspectacle and are certainl=
y abusive.  We wouldn't let a malnourished child sit in a=0Agallery for hou=
rs on end; why should a domesticated animal be treated=0Athat way?  Also di=
sturbing is the lack of "patron" reaction.  I don't=0Aknow why someone didn=
't untie the dog and attempt to walk out of=0Athe gallery with him or her. =
 Maybe they tried.  Maybe the reports of all patrons' passivity are also in=
determinate.  And just Maybe this is the kind of discussion Habacuc's "art"=
=0Ais supposed to inspire along with drawing attention to the homeless dog=
=0Asituation, but ultimately and regardless of his aim, the installation=0A=
is abhorrent because there are far more effective ways to address=0Athe hom=
eless dog problem -- if he really cared to do so.   =0A =0ABest,Amy=0A =0Ap=

Dear David,

Once again, an absolutively! (absolutely?, the black magic inside the
computer made me, or did it itself, write absolutively) stunning post.

Did you know that Melville had bad eye problems and  did not read
Shakespeare until in his thirties (?) when he discovered an edition of
Shakespeare's works with very large prints. Then, he wrote *Moby Dick*.
Olson mentions that in *Call Me Ishmael*. In indirect ways, Olson is
comparing Brackage to Melville, which is of course both an insightful
comment and a huge compliment.

The connection between bad eyesight and vision (prophecy, magic, the
Tiresias connection), I write about it also in my essay "Eleven Septembers
Later" where, discussing Benjamin Hollander's work as an example of Film
Lumiere, point to his account of how "Onome," one of the two works in *Levinas
and the Police*, came about. He was sitting in a completely darkened room.
On impulse, he scribbled a word on a piece of paper on the table. What he
found was "onome" (*Oh! no, me!*). I wonder why Olson objected to puns. Did
he associate them with academic (new criticism) formalism? Of course, puns
are at the heart of this new language universe, its rhizomes.

"Illuminations," "commentaries," digressions, anatomies ("anthologies"),
these basically archaic forms, both explore the relationship between the
visual and language (illuminations in the medieval and Persian manuscripts)
and create rhizomic structures (*The Talmud*). Commentaries in *The
Talmud*are burns into single words, creating a sacred, communal text
of Jewish
life. A commentary is a new space a word opens. In "Eleven Septembers
Later," I call *The Talmud* a literary example of Film Lumiere. Your account
of your meeting with Brackage has the feel of a dream, as does the all night
vigil between Brackage and Olson. Brackage, painting into films, carving
wounds in them. Through them, "mythos" (of the mouth) turns an experience of
the eye. (Has anyone seen Brackage's mind boggling film of autopsies as they
are taking place?) One should not forget the burns Papaditsas (the possessor
of original texts) makes in the manuscript, creating gaps/holes/spaces, in
Kent Johnson's *The Miseries of Poetry*.  Your own ruBEings another example
of that?

It seems to me what this thread is about the nature and form of sacredness
(particularly in a secular society). Aren't major sacred texts, *The Bible*,
*The Odyssey*, the Veda manuscripts, etc., basically anthologies, in their
sacred avatars full of digressions, repetitions, superimpositions, in this
form being supreme examples of hypetexts, with anonymous authorships,
heteronyms, etc.?

I am in the process of reading Chris Funhauser's fascinating new book
*Prehistoric
Digital Poetry*. It has begun to occur to me how much the web, with its
infinite number of links, digressions, commentaries, in its dialectic and,
in my opinion not so easy relation between word and image, has the form of a
sacred text. I do not think this is arbitrary and has a lot to do with the
stunning and paradoxical nature of the web as a medium.

Enough for now.

Ciao,

Murat

 fairly well-sourced account from which I quote this:> > In 2007 Guillermo =
Vargas took a stray dog from the streets of Managua, Nicaragua, and tied it=
 to a short leash in an art gallery, titling his exhibit 'Eres Lo Que Lees'=
 ('You Are What You Read'). Photographs appeared on the Internet showing a =
emaciated dog, tied to a wall by a length of rope in a room full of standin=
g people, with the title of the exhibit written on the wall in dog food. Th=
e outrage triggered by the exhibit spawned allegations that the dog, had be=
en left to starve to death; these allegations quickly spread internationall=
y via blogs, e-mails, and other unconfirmed sources. However, other than a =
three-hour period during which the dog was on display as part of Vargas' ex=
hibit, the gallery alleges the dog was not tied up, and was fed with food b=
rought in by Vargas himself. There are no indications in the photos of wher=
e or when they were taken, nor of who took them. Juanita Berm=FAdez, the di=
rector of the C=F3dice Gallery, was quoted in La> Prensa as saying that the=
 animal was fed regularly and was only tied up for three hours on one day b=
efore it escaped. Upon conducting a probe, the Humane Society was informed =
that the dog was in a state of starvation when it was captured and escaped =
after one day of captivity; the Humane Society also acknowledged, in refere=

The Humane Society is following this issue pretty closely. They are
*very*clear in their condemnation of this extremely exploitative act.
(By the way,
do you notice how all the reports note that the dog "escaped"-- not
released, but "escaped". Could we all just take a moment to think about the
very real terror and suffering this creature experienced?)

Here is their latest article:

Art, Examined

During the last month, I've received a torrent of email about Costa Rican
artist Guillermo Vargas featuring a starving street dog as
"art"<http://www.hsus.org/about_us/humane_society_international_hsi/cruelty=
_issues_around_the_world/starving_dog_as_art_42308.html>in
a Nicaraguan gallery. According to accounts we've received, Vargas
picked
up the poor creature and displayed him in the gallery=97attempting to make =
the
point that such an animal on the street would go unnoticed, but in a galler=
y
setting would be a spectacle. A local animal welfare group says the dog
escaped after a day in the gallery.
Vargas's supposition about the shock value of his exhibit was prophetic. Bu=
t
even more so than he could have imagined, or bargained for. The image of th=
e
plaintive dog, presumably left to languish and suffer in the presence of
gallery visitors and Vargas himself, was too much to fathom for many people
who learned about it on the Internet. There was a spontaneous outburst of
online petitions<http://weblogs.baltimoresun.com/features/mutts/blog/2008/0=
4/post_61.html>and
condemnations of the supposed artist=97a not uncommon phenomenon in the
Internet age when shocking information goes viral.

Two observations. First, this circumstance underscores that there must be
some limits in artistic expression, even if they are self-imposed by the
artists themselves. Free expression is itself a moral imperative, but it is
not absolute. It's one thing to document cruelty, but another matter to pla=
y
a part in it, to exploit the suffering of other creatures, and to fail to
provide any social context for it. Art and other cultural forms can be
powerful media for promoting awareness of animal suffering and abuse, and
for celebrating animals as creatures who deserve our admiration and respect=
,
but this was not one of those cases. Obviously, if Vargas had taken
photographs of starving street animals and called attention to the problem,
then his art or documentary would not have provoked any calumny.

This controversy comes on the heels of a similar debate that erupted last
month over an exhibit at the San Francisco Art Institute by the Paris artis=
t
Adel Abdessemed titled "Don't Trust Me." According to the San Francisco
Chronicle<http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=3D/c/a/2008/03/29/BAG=
NVSRME.DTL>,
"the show included a series of video loops of animals being bludgeoned to
death with a sledgehammer in front of a brick wall. The animals killed
included a pig, goat, deer, ox, horse and sheep." An outcry ensued, and the
Art Institute pulled the exhibit, and rightly so.My other reaction is that
we should rechannel our anguish and anger about Vargas and direct our energ=
y
to combat street dog problems in the developing world. Vargas is probably n=
o
more than a struggling artist, and we need not waste our time with further
denunciations. But let's focus our energy on fighting the street dog proble=
m
and working to develop programs and infrastructure that can bring some
relief to these creatures. This is a massive problem in the developing
world, affecting hundreds of millions of animals, and our global affiliate
Humane Society International has a Street Animal
Welfare<http://www.hsus.org/about_us/humane_society_international_hsi/speci=
al_programs_projects/hsis_humane_animal_mgmt.html>program
to develop humane care, spay and neuter, and vaccination programs.
Please do get involved with HSI. Get on our email
list<https://community.hsus.org/hsi/join.tcl?qp_source=3Dgahidd>and get
plugged in to our many international
activities <http://www.hsus.org/about_us/humane_society_international_hsi/>=
to
help street dogs, to fight factory farming, and to stem the wildlife
trade.

We cannot turn our gaze from this terrible problem throughout the world. An=
d
when we do focus on the problem, we must turn our anger into action, and
select the right targets. Let's pivot from Vargas and focus on the ongoing
cruelty, rather than seek retribution.

The issue is not whether a depiction of a starving dog is art; the questio=
n is whether
actually starving an actual dog to death in a gallery is art. If anything =
is art, then why
isn't starving a dog to death art?

My criticism of the "anything is art" school of thought is not that it all=
ows DEPICTION of
rape or murder to be art, but that it allows ACTUAL rape or murder to be a=
rt. Once you
say "anything" you've lost the whole war -- if ANYTHING is art, then why i=
s an actual
rape of an actual woman not an act of art? I say it's not, and you, if you=
 really say
"Anything is art", you say it is. I'm trying to point out the absurdity of=
 the "anything is art"
school of thought, not defend starving a dog. I think it's terrible to sta=
rve a dog and call
it art.

But if you say that anything is art, then on what grounds do you say starv=
ing a dog is
not art?

> And why do you always, historically
> and often wrongly, assume anyone who posts about art are defenders
> of the "postmodern faith"?<

If you don't think that "anything is art that anyone says is art" then you=
 can avoid my
criticism by simply saying you don't think that. Voila. But if you argue w=
ith me when I
say it's ridiculous to say "anything is art that anyone says is art" it's =
perfectly
acceptable, it seems to me, for me to believe that you DO hold that "anyth=
ing is art that
anyone says is art" because (wait for it) you're arguing with me when I sa=
y that's
ridiculous. If I say it's ridiculous, and you say it's not, then you're de=
fending it -- and if
you're defending it, then you're either defending it because you believe i=
t, or you're
defending it because, what -- you just like to argue?

> And no to your simplistic equation:  calling something art doesn't
> make it art.<

That's really not getting it. It's not MY "simplistic equation", it's the =
stated position of
people who do, and admire the work of people who do, things like put a cru=
cifix in a
plexiglass cube of piss and call it art. For example. And my question is, =
if you think
"Piss Christ" is art, why don't you think starving a dog is art? Where do =
you draw the
line, and why?

My position is that starving a dog to death is NOT art, because NOT "anyth=
ing is art
that anyone claims is art". You're ARGUING with me. You're taking the OTHE=
R SIDE.
The other side is that you DO believe that "anything is art that anyone cl=
aims is art" --
or else perhaps you just like to argue, and will take any side I don't tak=
e.

Just as true as hysterical mass-forwards in the email box.

But why not address the real issue: if anything is art that anyone says is=
 art, why isn't
starving a dog to death art? Why isn't rape? Why isn't torture? If anythin=
g is art then
there can be no line between art and non-art. Don't you see that "anything=
 is art that
anyone says is art" leads ineluctably, and inevitably, not merely to sayin=
g "fuck" in a
poem or putting a cross in a plexiglas cube of piss, but to truly transgre=
ssive acts.
Learn a lesson from the dog: stop saying "anything" when you don't mean it=
.

<http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=3D/c/a/2008/02/28/BAT3V9LUJ.DTL>
where Tom Clark taught for 21 years have compounded his health problems. To
add insult to injury, Tom and his partner Angelica were not notified that
New College had allowed employee health insurance to lapse due to unpaid
premiums, leaving the Clarks without adequate access to healthcare at a tim=
e
of urgent need. While Tom is fighting stroke-related problems, Angelica is
recovering from hip surgery performed earlier this year. Without either
reliable healthcare, including physical rehabilitation services or a salary
(severance, other compensation including back wages have been withheld by
New College) the Clarks are in precarious straits. This is certainly not a
scenario that they expected after so many years of dedication to both New
College =AD as an institution with a mission of social change and equality =AD
and the scores of students who came through the school=B9s Poetics Program.

A group of Tom and Angelica=B9s friends, as well as, former students are
trying to secure immediate =AD and long term =AD support for the Clarks. A fund
through the auspices of Giorno Poetry Systems, an organization with a long
history of supporting artists and writers in crisis administered graciously
by John Giorno, has been established to channel financial assistance to Tom
and Angelica. If you would like to make a contribution to assist the Clarks

Jonathan Holden characterizes Ashbery's images as "abstract
images"--because they are singular yet without a context and so could
suggest limitless associations.  In Murat's terms then, Ashbery was
pushing images toward the porous singularity of the "photographic"--not
"representative".  =20

however abstract images may be, they are particular and concrete in a
way
that only language need not be.

images are extrordinarily helpful in understanding mathematics but they
cannot negotiate its generality, the extent of its abstraction.

image begins to change to language when an image begins to lose its
particularity and become a placeholder for a class.

art of language+image is forever exploring the borders between the
concrete
and abstract, the tipping points of the particular into the general, the
'real' into the 'imaginary', the simultaneous instants when a cigar is
just
a cigar and when it is not.

Subject:      NEW BOOK: The Complete Poetry and Prose of William Blake
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii" ; format="flowed"

Dear Poetics-L:


RE: http://listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu/archives/poetics.html

The University of California Press  is pleased to announce the publication of:

The Complete Poetry and Prose of William Blake, With a New Foreword
and Commentary by Harold Bloom

Largely unrecognized during his lifetime, <B>William Blake
</B>(1757-1827) was a visionary English poet, painter, and
printmaker. His wide-ranging influence can be seen in genres from
theology and literature to popular music and graphic novels.

http://go.ucpress.edu/Blake



"For our sense of Blake in his own times we are indebted to David
Erdman more than anyone else."- _Times Literary Supplement _
"The crucial preliminary problem [in establishing Blake's text] is
simply to make out what Blake wrote. . . . Erdman has used modern
aids such as infrared photography and microphotography. . . but his
real achievement has been to look at Blake's text more closely and
intelligently than any previous editor." -_New York Review of Books _
"Very much fuller textual annotations [than any other Blake edition]
and incorporates a remarkable number of new readings." -_Southern
Review _

Since its first publication in 1965, this collection has been widely
hailed as the best available text of William Blake's poetry and
prose. It is now expanded to include a new foreword by Harold Bloom,
his definitive statement on Blake's greatness.

Full information about the bookis available online: http://go.ucpress.edu/Blake

jured up this "anything is art" claim since I have not, even remotely, clai=

that "anything is art" with you.  =0A=0ABut secondly and moreover, I know f=
rom firsthand experience with you on this list and other lists that you do =
indeed like to argue, very much, often just for the short-lived and shallow=
 joy of argument's sake.  Sometimes people need to feel like they have an E=

I'm sorry, Amy, but it's not my quagmire, and I didn't create it. I'm CRIT=
ICIZING it; I
don't assert it, I criticize it. The "anything is art that anyone says is =
art" is a long-
established position of the modern and postmodern art avant garde, and lat=
er art
establishment, used to defend all kinds of work as art.

Since that's indisputably the case, my question was, and remains, why isn'=
t it a
perfectly good defense of Vargas's dog installation?

And, second, if it's not, then I invite you to join me in criticizing the =
"anyting is art that
anyone says is art" position.

Marcus

It's not the wiki article I necessarily believe. I do believe the
Guardian, and I do believe the other sources listed at the bottom of
the page. That we can still be suckered by such a deliberate shock
tactic employed by a rather mediocre artist seems really troubling.

Marcus, old chap, I truly admire the way you have made an art of beating
the shit out of a series of poor, innocent straw men. One seldom finds
such dedication to an ongoing performance art project.

Dear Friends of POG:

We're writing on behalf of POG, the Tucson-based non-profit arts
organization whose mission is to present to the public the work of
innovative poets and other artists, to ask you to consider becoming a POG
Patron or Sponsor.

This is POG's eleventh season of public arts programming.  Our Poetry in
Action series presents several Tucson events per year, often pairing a
reading by a poet with a presentation by a visual artist or musician, and a
visiting presenter with a local one.  Our programming is nationally
acclaimed.  Poet Ron Silliman notes that "from the perspective of poetry, at
least, Tucson has been the liveliest community in the Southwest for
something like 15 years now" and emphasizes the key role that members of the
POG collective have played in developing that reputation.

POG is supported annually by the Arizona Commission for the Arts, the
National Endowment for the Arts, and the Tucson-Pima Arts Council. However,
these public monies cover only about one-third of our annual budget, which
in recent years has typically exceeded $4,000.  We need to raise the
remainder through a combination of event admissions, special fundraisers,
and private and corporate donations.

We hope you'll consider becoming a 2007-2008 Patron, for the modest amount
of $100, or a Sponsor, for $50.  Both Patrons and Sponsors are listed in all
POG publicity.  In addition, Patrons receive two free admissions to all POG
events; Sponsors receive one free admission to all events.  Or please
consider donating another amount, whether greater or smaller.  As always,
our spring fundraising efforts are crucial to balancing our budget!

POG is an IRS recognized 501(c)3 non-profit corporation.  All contributions
are fully tax deductible to the extent allowed by law.

If you'd like to become a POG Sponsor or POG Patron, please go to
www.gopog.org and click on the "pledge form" link near the top of the page,
then print out the document, complete it, and mail it, along with your check
made out to POG, to:

POG, 5029 N Post Trail, Tucson, AZ  85750.

Or you can simply mail your check without filling out a pledge form.

If you have any questions, please email Tenney Nathanson at
tenneyn@comcast.net or POG at pog@gopog.org.

Thank you for your interest in POG.

Sincerely,

Tony Luebbermann
President, POG Board of Directors

Tenney Nathanson
Treasurer, POG Board of Directors

I am sorry to write that David is taking his final steps on the road of =
life. I don't think he will be getting back to email. He is awake for =
minutes at a time only, his kidneys and liver are starting to fail. My =
guess is he has a few weeks at most. He appears to be comfortable when =
resting, he will stay at home with family and friends, minimal medical =
care from hospice nurses.

Words fail me...

You seem to be confusing a few different issues, Marcus. You seem to think =
that there is a problem about determining aesthetic value if "anything can =
be art" but if there is such a problem, it already existed before one notic=
ed that "anything can be art." For instance, if art can only be, for instan=
ce, oil painting on canvas, you still haven't determined whether every sing=
le item made of oil on canvas is art, or only certain ones of them--and if =
the latter, how do you decide which ones? Personally, I would say that aest=
hetic judgments can only be made case by case through one's own response to=
 the work--there are no rules that can be set in advance, and this is why a=
nything can (potentially) be art even though not everything is (necessarily=
) art. But that issue is different from the issue of ethics. If Habacuc had=
 really and truly starved a dog for art--which I doubt--it is conceivable t=
hat this could be both a powerful work of art and a vile, possibly
 criminal act. His success at making a work of art would not clear him of h=
is ethical offense. Here's a real life example: In my opinion, the greatest=
 film ever made would be La Regle du Jeu by Jean Renoir. The film includes =
an important scene of a rabbit hunt, and as is very clear when you see the =
film, real rabbits were shot and killed in order to make this scene. If one=
 believes it is wrong to kill animals, as some people do--or if you believe=
 that it is wrong to kill animals for any other reason than for food, as pe=
rhaps more people do--or in any case if one believes that it is ethically q=
uestionable to kill animals for such a frivolous reason as to make a piece =
of "entertainment," a movie--then one would have to conclude that Renoir co=
mmitted an ethical transgression and the fact that thanks to this transgres=
sion he made a great film would not be a sufficient defense.=0A=0A=0A=0A---=

I think it's probably pretty widespread on reflection. I know that
mark rothko has probably had more impact on me as a writer than any
poet besides maybe ted berrigan and gertrude stein. and like steve
mentioned about action painting, when looked at from that angle i
think you could make a strong case that a number of the list members
who do a lot of work with aleatory or procedural work through
programming in particular are "action poets." also, i think that
goldsmith's uncreative writing and his "unboring boring" aesthetic
could be classed as a sort of "action poetry"

four thoughts:

1.) art is not a simple word and this whole discussion, and the whole =20=

boring travesty that is conceptual art that leads to nonsense like =20
people putting a starving dog in a gallery, and at least conceivably =20
raping or murdering someone as a form of performance art (see the =20
novel "The Debt to Pleasure" or my own occasional critical theory =20
parody series "the poetics of aggravated sexual assault by E.L. =20
Borgnine") \, follows from a fundamental confusion of the use of the =20
word art both as "something put on display to evoke an aesthetic =20
response" and as a term used to express a high degree of quality or =20
value in such a "something". which is to say the former isn't a form =20
of praise or condemnation but is objective description, while the =20
latter is a subjective expression of a given evaluators valuation.

2.) a starving dog put on display in a gallery is art because it was =20
put on display in a gallery. a starving dog put on display in a =20
gallery is not art because the idea to put a starving dog on display =20
in a gallery is idiotic, and the act of putting a starving dog on =20
display in a gallery is cruel and serves no greater aesthetic end.

3.) transgression for its own sake is duller than art for it's own =20
sake. transgression for its own sake masquerading as art for it's own =20=

sake, which is what I think pisschrist is, is art, but it is also not =20=

art. that is, it's an "artwork" but it's also a "piece of shit" or =20
maybe more appropriately "a brick of frozen urine" both literally and =20=

figuratively.

4.) if we can just stop confusing the issue by thinking that calling =20
something art is synonymous with calling it good art, or put another =20
way to say that any artwork is ART in the sense of the sentence "now =20
THAT'S art!" then not only can we stop having this aggravating "what =20
is art" conversation that's been dogging our culture for the better =20
part of the last 150 years, but maybe people will stop thinking that =20
garbage like "Shed-Boat-Shed" and "Starving Dog in Gallery" are worth =20=

anybody's time, and the shallow dilletante's who promote such garbage =20=

will see their profit motive lead them elsewhere. Like say Patricia =20
Piccininni, who is awesome.

1.  Maybe the issue isn't really whether or not it's "art" at all, but
whether or not we find it acceptable.  Even if we *can* call anything =
"art"
does that justify the specific practice we are engaged in?  If we don't =
call
it "art" does that automatically give us license to reject or condemn =
it?
Is "art" inherently a free pass?  I don't think the issue is the problem =
of
"postmodernist" art at all. =20

2.  Seems to me that by tying the dog up, you have limited its options.
Perhaps a stray wandering dog would die anyway, but it is also possible =
it
would be able to track down food in garbage cans, wander to someone who
would help it, even if desperate enough, kill something to eat.  So =
without
coming down on one side or the other, I find the assertion that the dog
would inevitably die of starvation spurious.  If the dog wasn't eating,
perhaps it was not only stray, but also sick . . . .

3.  Finally, how often do those of us who teach tell our students to
evaluate sources carefully--including Wikipedia (and any of the other =
links
regarding this event.)  I admit I have come to inherently mistrust most, =
if
not all, internet petitions.  I also would not be inclined to toss out a
Wikipedia entry as "proof" of anything either. =20

The issue is not whether a depiction of a starving dog is art; the =
question
is whether=20
actually starving an actual dog to death in a gallery is art. If =
anything is
art, then why=20
isn't starving a dog to death art?=20

My criticism of the "anything is art" school of thought is not that it
allows DEPICTION of=20
rape or murder to be art, but that it allows ACTUAL rape or murder to be
art. Once you=20
say "anything" you've lost the whole war -- if ANYTHING is art, then why =
is
an actual=20
rape of an actual woman not an act of art? I say it's not, and you, if =
you
really say=20
"Anything is art", you say it is. I'm trying to point out the absurdity =
of
the "anything is art"=20
school of thought, not defend starving a dog. I think it's terrible to
starve a dog and call=20
it art.

But if you say that anything is art, then on what grounds do you say
starving a dog is=20
not art?

If you don't think that "anything is art that anyone says is art" then =
you
can avoid my=20
criticism by simply saying you don't think that. Voila. But if you argue
with me when I=20
say it's ridiculous to say "anything is art that anyone says is art" =
it's
perfectly=20
acceptable, it seems to me, for me to believe that you DO hold that
"anything is art that=20
anyone says is art" because (wait for it) you're arguing with me when I =
say
that's=20
ridiculous. If I say it's ridiculous, and you say it's not, then you're
defending it -- and if=20
you're defending it, then you're either defending it because you believe =

or you're=20
defending it because, what -- you just like to argue?

That's really not getting it. It's not MY "simplistic equation", it's =
the
stated position of=20
people who do, and admire the work of people who do, things like put a
crucifix in a=20
plexiglass cube of piss and call it art. For example. And my question =
is, if
you think=20
"Piss Christ" is art, why don't you think starving a dog is art? Where =
do

Below is an email a friend received from David Silva, a friend of David
Daniels. As many of you will know, David is the author of
http://thegatesofparadise.com . Much of his work is also at ubu.com.


Hi Regina
I am sorry to write that David is taking his final steps on the road of
life. I don't think he will be getting back to email. He is awake for
minutes at a time only, his kidneys and liver are starting to fail. My guess
is he has a few weeks at most. He appears to be comfortable when resting, he
will stay at home with family and friends, minimal medical care from hospice
nurses.

He spoke to me often of you Regina, he considered you a great friend and a
very fine human being.

Words fail me...

Dog argument reminds of Beuys' exhibit in SoHo where he was sequestered in
the gallery with a coyote--I think it was for a week or two.  The coyote was
listless, terrified and seemed to be slipping away toward death.  My
contempt for Beuys was boundless.  You can read about it here along with
other exhibits:

The issue is not whether a depiction of a starving dog is art; the question
is whether
actually starving an actual dog to death in a gallery is art. If anything is
art, then why
isn't starving a dog to death art?

My criticism of the "anything is art" school of thought is not that it
allows DEPICTION of
rape or murder to be art, but that it allows ACTUAL rape or murder to be
art. Once you
say "anything" you've lost the whole war -- if ANYTHING is art, then why is
an actual
rape of an actual woman not an act of art? I say it's not, and you, if you
really say
"Anything is art", you say it is. I'm trying to point out the absurdity of
the "anything is art"
school of thought, not defend starving a dog. I think it's terrible to
starve a dog and call
it art.

But if you say that anything is art, then on what grounds do you say
starving a dog is
not art?

> And why do you always, historically
> and often wrongly, assume anyone who posts about art are defenders
> of the "postmodern faith"?<

If you don't think that "anything is art that anyone says is art" then you
can avoid my
criticism by simply saying you don't think that. Voila. But if you argue
with me when I
say it's ridiculous to say "anything is art that anyone says is art" it's
perfectly
acceptable, it seems to me, for me to believe that you DO hold that
"anything is art that
anyone says is art" because (wait for it) you're arguing with me when I say
that's
ridiculous. If I say it's ridiculous, and you say it's not, then you're
defending it -- and if
you're defending it, then you're either defending it because you believe it,
or you're
defending it because, what -- you just like to argue?

> And no to your simplistic equation:  calling something art doesn't
> make it art.<

That's really not getting it. It's not MY "simplistic equation", it's the
stated position of
people who do, and admire the work of people who do, things like put a
crucifix in a
plexiglass cube of piss and call it art. For example. And my question is, if
you think
"Piss Christ" is art, why don't you think starving a dog is art? Where do
you draw the
line, and why?

My position is that starving a dog to death is NOT art, because NOT
"anything is art
that anyone claims is art". You're ARGUING with me. You're taking the OTHER
SIDE.
The other side is that you DO believe that "anything is art that anyone
claims is art" --
or else perhaps you just like to argue, and will take any side I don't take.

for what it's worth, my mother went to high school w/ asger jorn, they
rode their bikes to school together every day...she says he was "the
silliest person i ever met." not that he's strictly a lettrist, but

"Anything can be art" and "Anything anyone says is art is art" are two ent=
irely different
notions, and the attempt to conflate them is on the order of Amy's speciou=
s attempt to
conflate the notions of a depiction of an act and the act itself. To say "=
Anything can be
art" is a statement of possibility; but to say "Anything anyone says is ar=
t is art" is an
assertion of definition. I happen to agree with "Anything can be art", but=
 I disagree with
"Anything anyone says is art is art".

My question was, and remains, if "Anything anyone says is art is art", the=
n it seems as
if the acts of starving a dog to death, or raping a woman, or murdering a =
person (as
opposed to their depictions), are art if someone claims they are, because =
"Anything
anyone says is art is art" admits of no exceptions. If you believe there a=
re exceptions,
then you should disapprove of saying "Anything" or "anyone" or both, as I =
do. But if you
hold that "Anything anyone says is art is art", then on what grounds do yo=
u hold that
starving a dog, raping a woman, or murdering a person is not art?

I agree with you, which is why I argue against the "Anything that anyone s=
ays is art is
art" formula. But I hope you can see that those who hold that that formula=
 is valid must
allow that starving a dog, or any other act, however heinous, is art if so=
meone says it
is. The idea that by calling something "art" the artist gets a free pass t=
o do anything he
or she pleases is explicit in the "Anything that anyone says is art is art=
" formula. The
hard part, of course, is in trying to say why something is not art when on=
e is committed
to the notion of art as an act of individual freedom.

The notion that something may be both a powerful work of art and a vile, o=
r a criminal
(or both) act is an argument for the notion that "Anything is art that any=
one says is art"
-- though you are saying it may be something other than art, too. My quest=
ion for you,
then, is this: is an artist free to do as he or she pleases, to commit vil=
e or criminal acts,
and claim that art exempts him or her from the ethical or legal consequenc=
es of his or
her art acts? Or are you saying that people may admire the art while despi=
sing the
ethics, or that the community is justified in arresting, trying, convictin=
g, and punishing
him or her for a crime while the community admires the art?

In tyrannical states of various kinds artists have long been arrested, tri=
ed, convicted,
and punished for art that the community characterized as vile or criminal =
or both. To
say that the community may do that, which is what it seems you may be sayi=
ng when
you say that art may also be a vile or criminal act, is explicitly to put =
the claim "But it's
art!" to one side as invalid or unsound as a justification for an act. Tha=
t's the appeal of
"Anything is art that anyone says it is", of course: as a justification fo=
r artists as
emblems of individual freedom against tyranny. But it's a flawed notion be=
cause it's too
broad. Guillermo Vargas's dog installation shows just how it is too broad.=
 Whether
Vargas starved a dog or not, the mere suggestion that he did, in a gallery=
, and that
people watched instead of helped the dog, calls into question the entirety=
 of the "Art is
anything anyone says it is" notion. Vargas's installation is the other sid=
e of the art-and-
tyranny coin.

You can see, I'm sure, that this position has dangerous consequences. Stal=
in claimed
that many many artists had committed ethical, and other, offenses, and had=
 them shot.
It's no better to say that all works of art must be eithical than it is to=
 say any act is art if
someone says it is, particularly when what is ethical changes not only fro=
m society to
society, but over time within a single society.

Perhaps it was a sufficient defense at the time.

Now, you seem to be saying, it's not. Well,there you have it: ethical stan=
dards change
over time, and sometimes over pretty short periods of time. To say that on=
e must be
careful in one's art not only to be ethical by the standards of today, but=
 ethical by the
standards of tomorrow or a thousand years from now, is to put such a burde=
n on the
artist that no art would get made at all. Who's to say that breaking out i=
nto song on
stage, or dancing!, might not be judged unethical again, or that acting on=
 stage at all
might once again be banned, for example?

Ethics change. In 20 years it may be that the world has so changed that th=
ere'd never
be a starving dog in a gallery show because the audience would collectivel=
y kill it and
eat it right there in the gallery, so starved is the population -- we don'=
t know. It could be
that within the same 20 years even the mere depiction of a starving dog wo=
uld land the
depictor in jail on the grounds that anyone who finds a suffering animal i=
s held to be
responsible for relieving its suffering, and taking a photo of it first wi=
ll be judged a lapse
of moral judgment. We don't know. We can't know. To burden artists with th=
e
obligation to know what can't be known seems ridiculously unwise.

I'm arguing that what Vargas has done, by putting a dog in a gallery, is e=
xactly to call
into question the notion of "Art is anything anyone says it is", and the f=
ree pass that
that notion has been held to have been, in opposition to conventional poli=
tical tyranny.
What happens, Vargas seems to me to be saying, when you claim things are a=
rt that
are not in opposition to a conventional political tyranny?

The Early Purges
Seamus Heaney

I was six when I first saw kittens drown.
Dan Taggart pitched them, "the scraggy wee shits",
Into a bucket; a frail metal sound,

Soft paws scraping like mad. But their tiny din
was soon soused. They were slung on the snout
Of the pump and the water pumped in.

"Sure isn't it better for them now?" Dan said.
Like wet gloves they bobbed and shone till he sluiced
Them out on the dunghill, glossy and dead.

Suddenly frightened, for days I sadly hung
Round the yard, watching the three sogged remains
Turn mealy and crisp as old summer dung

Until I forgot them: But the fear came back
When Dan trapped big rats, snared rabbits, shot crows
Or, with a sickening tug, pulled old hen's necks.

Still, living displace false sentiments
And now, when shrill pups are prodded to drown,
I just shrug, "Bloody pups". It makes sense:

"Prevention of cruelty" talk cuts ice in town
Where they consider death unnatural,
But on well-run farms pests have to be kept down."

Jason:

My mental picture of an "action painter" is someone standing before an easel
and painting faster than he or she could think; dancing, almost, as Pollock
used to do. Of course this is the opposite of Rothko, for example, who sat
in front of his work and contemplated it. I assume that someone writing code
is sitting. It would be interesting, I think, to discuss the posture of a
poet.

Hi everyone--

I'm delighted to email, below, full information on the Beat Generation
Symposium that the Beat Studies Association is putting together for
October 10-11, 2008, at Columbia College Chicago.

I'll be sending the call for papers shortly.

Please keep in mind, as I say below in the announcement, that hotel
rooms are at a PREMIUM that weekend.  It's important that you book
your room as soon as possible, as the Chicago Marathon is taking place
October 12.  (We only discovered this convergence recently, after we'd
already booked the featured readers.)

The Homewood Suites in downtown Chicago (close to Columbia's campus)
has created a room block for us.  Information on this is below.  But I
also provided a list of hotels in the area, with contact
information.

If you have any other questions, please email back to the list, or
feel free to email me directly (ttrigilio@colum.edu).

Hope to see you there!

Best,
Tony

***********************************************
THE BEAT GENERATION SYMPOSIUM
***********************************************

Please join us for a conference devoted to the literary and cultural
legacy of the Beat Generation:  "The Beat Generation Symposium,"
sponosored by the Beat Studies Association, Columbia College Chicago,
and Illinois State University.

Friday, October 10, and Saturday, October 11, 2008.

Location:  Columbia College Chicago, Film Row Theater (1104 South Wabash
Avenue, 8th floor).

This is an academic Beat Studies conference to be held in conjunction
with the Columbia College's Center for the Book and Paper Arts's Fall
2008 display of the Jack Kerouac ON THE ROAD manuscript scroll.  The
Beat Generation Symposium features panel discussions each day, with
poetry readings by Joanne Kyger (October 10) and Diane di Prima (October
11).

Conference fee for those who pre-register before August 1:  $50 ($25 for
Graduate Students, Independent Scholars, and Retired Faculty).  After
August 1, the fees are $100 and $50.

Checks should be made payable to Columbia College Chicago, and should be
sent to:

Columbia Ticket Center
33 East Congress St., Suite 610
Chicago, IL 60605
Ph: 312-344-6600 (fax 312-344-8470)
columbiatickets@colum.edu

A limited number of hotel rooms are available at the Homewood Suites by
Hilton Chicago-Downtown, 40 East Grand Avenue, Chicago.  This hotel is a
very short cab or subway ride from the Columbia campus.  The Homewood
Suites prepared a special link for us to book online.  Just click below
and you'll find directions for reserving a room:

http://homewoodsuites.hilton.com/en/hw/groups/personalized/CHIHWHW-CLC-20081009/index.jhtml

It's important that you book your room as soon as possible, as the
Chicago Marathon is taking place October 12.  (We only discovered this
convergence recently, after we'd already booked the featured readers.)

A Visitor's Guide for the Beat Symposium is pasted below, with a list of
nearby hotels.  Columbia College Chicago is located downtown, in the
heart of the city's South Loop neighborhood, and is easily accessible
from these hotels by foot or cab.  All major subway/El trains come into
the South Loop, too, so it's possible to book hotels in other parts of
the city and make it to the Symposium without difficulty.

Mention that you're a Columbia College Chicago visitor to receive
discounted rates at some of these hotels.  It's crucial to book as soon
as possible because of the marathon.

For more information, contact Tony Trigilio at
ttrigilio@colum.edu<mailto:ttrigilio@colum.edu> (312-344-8138).

VISITOR'S GUIDE:  THE BEAT GENERATION SYMPOSIUM

Airports:
O'Hare Airport (western suburbs) and Midway Airport (southern suburbs)
are the two airports servicing the Chicgao area.  They are approximately
equidistant from Columbia College.

Transportation:
 From Midway Airport, take the Orange Line elevated train to Adams
Street. From there, walk south on Wabash until you reach Congress
Parkway. From O'Hare Airport, take the Blue Line to La Salle. Walk East
on Congress (away from the Chicago Stock Exchange Building, which you'll
see upon emerging from the subway) until you reach Wabash (about 5 short
blocks).

Use www.transitchicago.com's<http://www.transitchicago.com's/> free Trip
Planner service to plan the rest of your trips while you're here.
Simply enter your starting point and destination, and Trip Planner gives
you detailed directions. As of 2008, fares are $2.00 one-way with a
$0.25 transfer. Each train station has kiosks where you can buy transit
cards and reload them (cash only). The Blue Line and Red Line run 24/7;
the other lines stop running for a few hours late at night.

Taxis are available throughout the city. From Midway Airport to the
English Department, cab fare would be approximately $25 and from O'Hare
Airport cab fare would be approximately $50. If you need to call a cab,
call (773) or (312) TAXICAB.

Metra Trains service suburban areas.  Visit

Dear Amy,

=20

You are so right-on posting alert to this heinous, insane garbage.  Yes, =
will indeed sign the petitions, and Thank You for sharing the alert and =
getting the word out about this so-called =93art.=94

=20

If anything like this is =93art=94 OR =93poetry,=94 then I myself =
don=92t want anything to do with so-called =93art=94 and =93poetry.=94  =
Enough said for the moment, but goddamn it, this is part and parcel of =
related, perhaps broader travesties that anyone with half a heart, OR =
half a Brain, must surely be feeling vigilant about, always, the last oh =
so many years and the coming who knows how many years, so I know =
there=92s more to talk about and deal with down the line...

=20

Yeah, hmmmm, reminds me of a line or two that I was writing last night =
that refers to =93irreverence,=94 too, something that is absolutely =
essential in creating seriously evocative and provocative and hilarious =
and thoughtful =93comedy=94 the way some of the world=92s best =
comedians, and some poets, do.  There IS a dangerous gray area beyond =
which, or within which, whatever, one flirts with =93cruelty=94 and =
ugliness, where irreverence can become very tricky business.

=20

In any event, there=92s plenty to be and become mindful about, and this =
alert to Senor Haba=92s =93deep failings=94 are serious food for thought =
and consideration.

we 'make sense' of what we see. so do other animals. there is apparently a
considerable process of inference going on in how we make sense of what we
see. in some other animals also, i gather.

whether this process involves 'language' or 'code' isn't clear to me. but
surely code can have syntax and semantics also.

Call it what you like, Steve.  I'll re-post one of my earlier points before=
 my original post gets lost in a separate debate altogether:=0A=0A1.  I am =
against the inhumane treatment of people and animals for any=0Apurpose, inc=
luding entertainment, political, and for "art's sake".  This=0A"treatment" =
also includes non-treatment.  If you assume the=0Aresponsibility of caring =
for a domestic animal, that includes getting=0Ait help if needed -- especia=
lly help that consists of the basic=0Anecessities.  =0A=0AWould you adopt a=
 child or an animal, who you find out later is sick, and simply dismiss its=
 condition and your decision not to treat it just because "it would die eve=
ntually?"=0A=0AThe above refers to people and animals who are dependent on =
others for care.  Dogs most certainly fall into that category, especially a=
 sickly one you "adopt" and "employ" for your own art exhibition, regardles=
s of whether you kill it or not -- the least Habacuc could have done was ge=
t care and treatment for what was obviously a sickly animal since it was su=
ddenly under his "care" and in his "employment."  Instead of doing so, he p=
ublicly dismissed outrage against him by stating that "the dog was going to=
 die anyway."    Steve - What people autonomously do with their own bodies,=
 and the rights they have to do whatever they choose (i.e. suicide, amputat=
ion, piercing, etc), is another question and subject altogether.=0A=0A2.  A=
nother quote from the same post, since a couple of folks on the list seem t=
o have taken issue with the very fact that I even mentioned the petition, a=
s well as the dissent around the controversy:=0A=0AI might try Snopes  or  =
Hoax Slayer,=0Awhich both determined that the claim is ultimately disputed,=
 as=0Aoriginally pointed out in second half of my first post, though the hy=
perlink to my=0Aeasily-googled article didn't come through.   *** But does =
uncertainty about how Habacuc ultimately did treat the dog, and his public =
unwillingness to even claim if he killed it or set it free after he used it=
 for his own public spectacle, mean=0AHabacuc gets a free pass, and I shoul=

Alan, bravo!

Barry, I was thinking exactly along the same lines. In Robert Bresson's *Au
Hazard Balthazar,* in the final scene of the movie a donkey crouches in the
middle of a meadow standing completely still, dying. Since Bresson does not
use actors, and since a donkey (as any animal) is a quintessential non-actor
(only an acter?), one inescapably asks, is the donkey ("the real donkey")
dying before our own very eyes. In another, utterly heart-breaking scene of
the movie, two kids (?) poke a stick into Balthazar's ass, and the donkey
startled brays and takes a few steps to move away. The film starts, before
the credits, with several brays of a donkey *not* visible on the screen.

I wrote a poem about that final scene which is part of my *The Structure of
Escape* poem. The poem may tangentially relate to the issues discussed here,
the relationship between cruelty, suffering, blasphemy ("the cross in
urine"), sainthood and art.

         Au Hazard Balthazar

How can you let a donkey die for your film. in a final gesture, a wandering
lamb from nowhere, sniffing its feet?

Is it because it can not act?

Marcus, can you point to any avant-garde or post-modern manifesto, or work,
where the statement "anything is art that anyone says is art" is made? I
always thought it was a neo-con canard.

Ciao,

Murat

Schwabsky,

Sure. I'm familiar with his work as an artist in Costa Rica. You can google
him. I'm sure you'll find more work of his. Great stuff. Real, "middle of
the night attack" type .... Grabs a dog, makes gringos angry, assumes many
people would not act in a crisis situation (human or animal), turns out to
be right. Sophomore effort might need revamping, however. Shock and awe is
difficult to surpass.

 this could be both a powerful work=0A> of art and a vile, possibly=0A>  cr=
iminal act. <=0A=0AThe notion that something may be both a powerful work of=
 art and a vile, or a criminal=0A(or both) act is an argument for the notio=
n that "Anything is art that anyone says is art"=0A-- though you are saying=
 it may be something other than art, too. My question for you,=0Athen, is t=
his: is an artist free to do as he or she pleases, to commit vile or crimin=
al acts,=0Aand claim that art exempts him or her from the ethical or legal =
consequences of his or=0Aher art acts? Or are you saying that people may ad=
mire the art while despising the=0Aethics, or that the community is justifi=
ed in arresting, trying, convicting, and punishing=0Ahim or her for a crime=
 while the community admires the art?=0A=0AIn tyrannical states of various =
kinds artists have long been arrested, tried, convicted,=0Aand punished for=
 art that the community characterized as vile or criminal or both. To=0Asay=
 that the community may do that, which is what it seems you may be saying w=
hen=0Ayou say that art may also be a vile or criminal act, is explicitly to=
 put the claim "But it's=0Aart!" to one side as invalid or unsound as a jus=
tification for an act. That's the appeal of=0A"Anything is art that anyone =
says it is", of course: as a justification for artists as=0Aemblems of indi=
vidual freedom against tyranny. But it's a flawed notion because it's too=
=0Abroad. Guillermo Vargas's dog installation shows just how it is too broa=
d. Whether=0AVargas starved a dog or not, the mere suggestion that he did, =
in a gallery, and that=0Apeople watched instead of helped the dog, calls in=
to question the entirety of the "Art is=0Aanything anyone says it is" notio=
n. Vargas's installation is the other side of the art-and-=0Atyranny coin.=

Another problem about trying to take a position on this is, not only do I n=
ot necessarily believe the accounts that are circulating about this, but ev=
en if I were decided to believe that the (mostly untraceable) quotes from t=
he artist were really things that he said, I'm not sure if I would believe =
him either. I don't know anything about him, never heard of him before, but=
 something about this whole thing suggests a trickster at work, someone who=
, in order to provoke, may have said one thing and done another--maybe the =
whole thing never happened and he himself started the whole campaign agains=
t himself just to see what would happen. At this point and in the absence o=

child or an animal, who you find out later is sick, and simply dismiss its =
condition and your decision not to treat it just because "it would die even=
tually?"=0A=0AThe above refers to people and animals who are dependent on o=
thers for care.  Dogs most certainly fall into that category, especially a =
sickly one you "adopt" and "employ" for your own art exhibition, regardless=
 of whether you kill it or not -- the least Habacuc could have done was get=
 care and treatment for what was obviously a sickly animal since it was sud=
denly under his "care" and in his "employment."  Instead of doing so, he pu=
blicly dismissed outrage against him by stating that "the dog was going to =
die anyway."    Steve - What people autonomously do with their own bodies, =
and the rights they have to do whatever they choose (i.e. suicide, amputati=
on, piercing, etc), is another question and subject altogether.=0A=0A2.  An=

Subject:      NEW BOOK: The Complete Poetry and Prose of William Blake
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii" ; format="flowed"

Dear Poetics-L:


RE: http://listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu/archives/poetics.html

The University of California Press  is pleased to announce the publication of:

The Complete Poetry and Prose of William Blake, With a New Foreword
and Commentary by Harold Bloom

Largely unrecognized during his lifetime, <B>William Blake
</B>(1757-1827) was a visionary English poet, painter, and
printmaker. His wide-ranging influence can be seen in genres from
theology and literature to popular music and graphic novels.

http://go.ucpress.edu/Blake



"For our sense of Blake in his own times we are indebted to David
Erdman more than anyone else."- _Times Literary Supplement _
"The crucial preliminary problem [in establishing Blake's text] is
simply to make out what Blake wrote. . . . Erdman has used modern
aids such as infrared photography and microphotography. . . but his
real achievement has been to look at Blake's text more closely and
intelligently than any previous editor." -_New York Review of Books _
"Very much fuller textual annotations [than any other Blake edition]
and incorporates a remarkable number of new readings." -_Southern
Review _

Since its first publication in 1965, this collection has been widely
hailed as the best available text of William Blake's poetry and
prose. It is now expanded to include a new foreword by Harold Bloom,
his definitive statement on Blake's greatness.

Full information about the bookis available online: http://go.ucpress.edu/Blake

I guess that's exactly why I'm not willing to take up, and give validity to=
, the whole "Is it art?" debate around Habacuc -- his entire presentation i=
s suspect.  He hasn't been clear on his treatment of the dog, and if he's b=
eing dodgy as a "trickster" artist, then it's not worth my time to wonder i=
f it is art.  What is worth my time is to question his ethics first and for=
emost.   Much of the photographic evidence is shameful, as are his and the =
gallery owner's publicly-document statements in The Guardian and elsewhere,=
 even if he believes he somehow rendered a tied-up starving dog artisticall=
y.=0A=0ASimply:  Doing something in the name of art or calling something ar=
t, whomever deems it so, doesn't somehow magically erase one's ethical resp=
onsibilities.  An artist is still a person.=0A=0AAmy=0A=0A _______=0A=0A=0A=

 I were decided to believe that the (mostly untraceable) quotes from the ar=
tist were really things that he said, I'm not sure if I would believe him e=
ither. I don't know anything about him, never heard of him before, but some=
thing about this whole thing suggests a trickster at work, someone who, in =
order to provoke, may have said one thing and done another--maybe the whole=
 thing never happened and he himself started the whole campaign against him=
self just to see what would happen. At this point and in the absence of rel=

t the inhumane treatment of people and animals for any=0Apurpose, including=
 entertainment, political, and for "art's sake".  This=0A"treatment" also i=
ncludes non-treatment.  If you assume the=0Aresponsibility of caring for a =

 or an animal, who you find out later is sick, and simply dismiss its condi=
tion and your decision not to treat it just because "it would die eventuall=
y?"=0A=0AThe above refers to people and animals who are dependent on others=
 for care.  Dogs most certainly fall into that category, especially a sickl=
y one you "adopt" and "employ" for your own art exhibition, regardless of w=
hether you kill it or not -- the least Habacuc could have done was get care=
 and treatment for what was obviously a sickly animal since it was suddenly=
 under his "care" and in his "employment."  Instead of doing so, he publicl=
y dismissed outrage against him by stating that "the dog was going to die a=
nyway."    Steve - What people autonomously do with their own bodies, and t=
he rights they have to do whatever they choose (i.e. suicide, amputation, p=
iercing, etc), is another question and subject altogether.=0A=0A2.  Another=
 quote from the same post, since a couple of folks on the list seem to have=
 taken issue with the very fact that I even mentioned the petition, as well=
 as the dissent around the controversy:=0A=0AI might try Snopes  or  Hoax S=
layer,=0Awhich both determined that the claim is ultimately disputed, as=0A=
originally pointed out in second half of my first post, though the hyperlin=

I'd like to point list members to John Wilkinson's on-the-mark review =20=

of Keston Sutherland's poem "Hot White Andy" in Jacket.  An excerpt:

"The present review seems to be the first of a poem I think the most =20
remarkable poem in English published this century. Having seen the =20
shell-shocked response of two very different audiences I am at a loss =20=

to account for the speechlessness unless we=92ve been outdone in our =20
jabber and feel abashed (I=92m assuming there is some kind of operative =20=

=91we=92 about, I hope so). The poem is doing some work nonetheless. A =20=

passion for new British poetry was admitted to me more than a year =20
after this poem had been detonated in their heads, by some graduate =20
students on a major poetics program in the US. But given the absence =20
of print or internet commentary, I feel compelled to write a fan =20
letter rather than a critique, and to say a possible poetic future =20
starts here =97 and if it doesn=92t, I suppose I can go and grow =20
vegetables."

Amy:

I of course agree with you, but it's not always=20
so straightforward. Most of us kill, at least by=20
proxy, to eat, and some animals are raised for=20
that purpose. I remember a performance piece in=20
New York in which an artist beat a chicken to=20
death against the strings of a piano. Horrible.=20
But I've also been at a religious ceremony in=20
which a chicken's throat was cut so that it bled=20
to death. The ceremony seemed less horrible, and=20
not just because the killing was quicker--it=20
seemed something like more justified, though for=20
me as an outsider the bird's near-panic has stayed with me.

Audubon killed every bird in his Birds of North=20
America and arranged their bodies in positions he=20
had observed them take when they were alive.=20
Thousands of birds. There was no other way to do=20
it. The water colors and the prints he made of=20
them are one of the glories of 19th Century art.=20
Nobody asked the birds what they thought. By the=20
time of Audubon's death one of the birds he=20
depicted was extinct, because of habitat=20
destruction, and he was aware that it was headed=20
in that direction. Another became extinct 60=20
years after his death, slaughtered for food.

The casual but necessary cruelty of the barnyard=20
and the hunt may prepare those who live with them=20
to an aestheticization of death.

Leni Riefenstahl's Triumph of the Will is one of=20
the monuments of film. One needn't go into detail=20
about what it cost. I sat through it once, and=20
left the theater homicidal with grief and rage.=20
Not an experience I plan to repeat. As a Jew, of=20
course, every time I engage with a work of Christian art I'm aware of the=
 cost.

Most of us have attitudes about bullfighting, as=20
outsiders. Otherwise tender-hearted Spaniards and=20
Mexicans are devoted to it, as an art as well as=20
a sport. I used to watch bullfights on=20
television--they were broadcast to NY for several=20
years from the ring in Tijuana. I had a small=20
screen black and white tv and grainy reception,=20
so the expience was considerably distanced. I=20
went to one corrida years later. It was=20
fascinating, and also necessary for my slow=20
immersion in Latin American culture. It was also=20
extremely disturbing. But the bullring produced=20
Goya's Tauromaquia, and also Picasso's.

One could detail the cruelties of all the sports=20
in which animals are used, and also the art=20
produced by devotees. Is it less gratuitous to=20
breed horses for speed and then run them so hard=20
that their legs break? At least injury and death=20
is not an intended part of the spectacle, as in=20
bullfights, dogfights or cockfights, or the=20
pitting of animals of one species against=20
another. All of these have been central to various cultures.

And of course there's boxing.

None of this of course excuses an artist who's=20
making a political point at the expense of=20
another creature. Had Habacuc refrained there=20
would still be enormous numbers of starving feral=20
dogs on the streets of Central America, and there=20
would still be intentionally drowned puppies on=20
the banks of every body of water.

Isn't non-representation the modus of the medium? Spontaneous
musicality and text placement conspire to defy given meaning and
thereby encourage the reader/listener to bewilderment and yet
subconsciously engage to transcend and eventually, consciously
construct their own meaning? Is abstraction "crafted" chaos or does it
more accurately "represent" the contemporary condition of mediated,
sensory overload? Abstract poetry sends me running to the highly
structured haiku, but not for long. The human brain, animal or
otherwise, exists to unravel its own existence. Abstract art
stimulates and feeds this need.

JOSHUA:

yeah, wonderful endorsement of HWA from Wilkinson!

there's also Jennifer Cooke's essay on "Loving Hot White Andy" in Complicities, edited by Robin Purves & Sam Ladkin:

http://litteraria.ff.cuni.cz/books/complicities.html

would like to follow any other comments or criticism around Keston's Andy -- that is, if there's more, let us know.

David Orr's review in the Times of Vendler's new Yeats book.
Something to think about.

Though I wish he hadn't begun with "The critic is the only artist who
depends entirely upon another art form." How about other
interpreters, like translators, musicians, singers, dancers, actors,
directors, choreographers? I probably forgot a few.

I also thought something similar and dismissed it when my students brought
it up. Don't forget the possible gallery behind it all. In any case,
something disgraceful - to be kind.

Amy,

" This is irritating moral territory, one doesn't want to provide artists
and their sponsors publicity for work that's of no artistic value, but if
the exhibitions are ignored there is a tacit acceptance of them."

This is where the load lies. The crux. What are the proper -- most effectiv=
e
-- methods of resistance/boycott to and of work like this without giving th=
e
artist unfair (unfair in that she/he didn't earn it) publicity?

I repost an old post from 1999 and ask does anyone have any news of
Jean-Paul Curtay?
In an issue of Adz, early 1980's there is an interview in English with
Jean-Paul Curtay, a second or third generation Letterist with a book in
french to his credit, Lettrrism. That book is undoubtedly a very
important resource for info on the topic.Donald Wellman

I haven't seen this man's work. I've read all the differing stories on
differing websites. On of the face of it, I agree with most of the
criticisms here. Some conceptual art works for me, most of it leaves me with
a very empty feeling, it too often seems unidirectional to me, one thought
invited in that leads you down a very short road. And I don't approve of
cruelty to animals (or human beings). But this discussion is leaving me with
some discomfort. Maybe this is conditioned by the fact that I was brought up
on a farm, which doesn't necessarily lead to an aestheticisation of death,
as Mark suggests, but does bring you close up to certain realities (eg human
beings eat animals in order to live, or that animals eat each other).

What primarily strikes me about all this is how few people seem to worry
about the dogs that are starving namelessly in the streets outside the
gallery. Nobody seems to be arguing that the artist deliberately starved the
dog into that state - he says he got it off the street as it was. And
whether it actually died or how long it was actually exhibited for, and
whether it was offered food, or escaped or died, seems to be up for grabs.
So he's not like someone slaughtering or torturing an animal for a video;
Murat suggested one example of an animal used in a film, another is when the
peasants slaughter a pig in Tree of Wooden Clogs, very hard to watch, and
there are no doubt scores of others. Even in the worst case scenario
Habucuc's bringing into a gallery something that's already occurring
unnoticed outside. So if the dog died on the steps of the gallery, and
people walked by and didn't look and the corpse was thrown in the garbage,
it would be ok ("natural"?) Would there be any internet petitions then? It's
only awful if the dog starves in the gallery?

The obscenity and upset seems to occur when the fact is framed. A privileged
dog, then. This dog suddenly matters to people who mostly never devoted a
second's thought to all those street dogs. (Except, ironically, perhaps the
artist himself, who noticed the starving dogs.)  Isn't the real obscenity
that this horrible death happens to millions of dogs and nobody notices?
(What about the dogs trussed up alive with broken legs in the marketplaces
of Asia?) Is it just easier to attack the artist than to do something about
the dogs (and people) who live in such awful conditions? Is the artist (even
if he is not a good artist) who notices this and brings it to our shocked
attention necessarily unethical?

All best

Alison

I've rescued innocent artists from animals.

has anyone rescued rescued guilty animals from artists?

It has been rumored that sitting through Balthazar renders the viewer
absolved of all past transgressions.

He doesn't know it, but Damien Hirst's next show will be called
murderedhim.  think cross-section of Hirst.  Saatchi is already counting
the money.

Rumor around the biz is that James Cameron is shooting a remake of
Balthazar.  Playing the role of the ass is Tom Cruise.

Jokes aside, couldn't you say that Arthur Danto's explanation of art as
culturally defined be a sort of art model making an "anything goes"
definition of art possible?  If art works that drive categorical
questionings about art depend on a culture's greater philosophical
questions, then it would follow that a philosophically skeptical society
would have a "anything is art that anyone says is art" definition.
Particularly an individualistic & socially skeptical society.  Sounds a
tiny bit like the US of the 80's and 90's to me.  A little, because I
think the US culture in that time was more socially skeptical than
generally skeptical.

Others might argue that the identification of art as such is emotional,
and the emotional is inscribed not by natural selection but by culture.
  This isn't an anything goes sort of thing, but it does have that ring
to it, namely in the sense that culture can be written quickly.  I think
that's the biz poets are in, no?  we aren't in the business of making
art by our mere gestures?

culturally defined, i'd say art is anything that gets enshrined by large
numbers of people and/or amounts of dollars.  think museums, textbooks,
monuments, television shows.  hirst is an artist because he's been
written as such.  that the story, the gestures.  the rest is, ahem,
history.  of the multitude?  maybe, though a multitude of what is a good
question.  democratic?  not even close.  hegemonic?  yeah probably.  if
you can just get the NYT to write about your nascent work you're making
art at long last.  short of that, even your mother doesn't think you're
an artist.

I'm waiting for Lester to become an artist myself.  In the hegemonic
garden in the shade.

of Another Innocent Animal

Alan, bravo!

Barry, I was thinking exactly along the same lines. In Robert Bresson's *Au
Hazard Balthazar,* in the final scene of the movie a donkey crouches in the
middle of a meadow standing completely still, dying. Since Bresson does not
use actors, and since a donkey (as any animal) is a quintessential non-actor
(only an acter?), one inescapably asks, is the donkey ("the real donkey")
dying before our own very eyes. In another, utterly heart-breaking scene of
the movie, two kids (?) poke a stick into Balthazar's ass, and the donkey
startled brays and takes a few steps to move away. The film starts, before
the credits, with several brays of a donkey *not* visible on the screen.

I wrote a poem about that final scene which is part of my *The Structure of
Escape* poem. The poem may tangentially relate to the issues discussed here,
the relationship between cruelty, suffering, blasphemy ("the cross in
urine"), sainthood and art.

          Au Hazard Balthazar

How can you let a donkey die for your film. in a final gesture, a wandering
lamb from nowhere, sniffing its feet?

Is it because it can not act?

Marcus, can you point to any avant-garde or post-modern manifesto, or work,
where the statement "anything is art that anyone says is art" is made? I
always thought it was a neo-con canard.

Ciao,

Murat

Dearest Peopulace Poetics:

That should read Opera: not Oprah. If you're in Providence, I'll be giving a
recital of an original opera tonight (Sunday night). It's free and in the
McCormack Family Theater at Brown (70 Brown Street, entrance on Fones
Alley). It will begin at 8pm and should last just over one half hour. The
opera is called The Death of Pringle. The songs range from popular folk
ballads played on piano to interactive digital soundscapes. A plot synopsis
follows below. I hope Oprah shows up.

Thanks,
Justin Katko

* *

The Death of Pringle,
in which is related the Discursive Alignment of the Battlefield to Come. Our
Story takes place in the Environs of Southern California's Salton Sea, a
World unto itself, where a Party of Alchemical Topologists and Real
Bureaucrats have Launched an Imperial Scheme for World Domination. With the
Power of a Mysterious 4-Dimensional Dust, an Infinite Research Grant, and a
Fortified Lab Complex, these Imperial Mother Fuckers have acquired a Total
Copy of Washington DC's own Sonny Bono Memorial Park, binding it to the
Interior of a Transparent Virtual  Reality Sphere, and accessing, by means
of this Chamber, a Fundament giving Real Physique to Architectures which
until now have been merely Spectral. The Roll of the Great Plan continues. A
Synthetic Atmosphere of Electro-Magnetized Dust is to be installed over and
around the Sea, hermetically priming this Zone for Discrete
Terraformalization. Upon the Accumulation of Power to the Critical Degree,
it is their Vile Intention to Sublimate the Sphere's Outputs into the
Atmospheric Dust Particles, saturating the newly Truncated Sky with the Pure
Stuff of the Virtual. Thus, the Entire Region takes on the unique
Ontological Function of an Augmented Total Copy of the Sonny Bono Memorial
Park, scaled Two Thousand Four Hundred and Eighty One Times its Actual Size.
The Sea is converted into the Park's Kentucky Bluegrass when the Mother
Fuckers fill it up with Rotting Meat and let it grow its Own. This One
Celestial Seed, bound in its Glowing Atmospherics, will Detach from the
Earth to Propagate the Long Aether. The People, whom the Mother Fuckers have
Tempted into Passive Alignment with Indefinite Free Lunch, must tend for
Eternity the Park's Banal Landscaping. And so goes the Evil Plan, but not
unchallenged. A Pringle vested with the Power of Speech has Freed itself
from the Lab Fortress, being one Pringle who has undergone Purchase and
Storage, Stocked in the Laboratory as an Object of Experiment. Upon Escape,
the Free Pringle brings News of the Imperial Machinations to the People. The
Poets welcome this Talking Commodity and attend to its Speech; but the
People, blinded by the Ease of their Freedom, fail to Listen to this Piece
of their Food. It is thus that the Fate of the Commons and Autonomy itself
is an Imperative Function of the Efficacy of the Poets' Song. Will their
Lyrics be well enough Advanced to Hijack the Technoitopian Scheming of the
Imperial Mother Fuckers? Can a Pringle really DIE?

I wish someone would start a Weldon Kees discussion. I won't cuz the topic won't get attention.  Still, the late Donald Justice, a very good minor poet, discovered and introduced Kees as one of the most important poets of his generation. Without Justice, Kees (his work) would have been forgotten. & that is as sad as the man's apparent suicide.

I've been meaning to add Abraham Lincoln Gillespie, my favorite
abstract writer of the early 50s...  Tho dismissed by many as a Joyce
imitator, his approach to language in the 40s & 50s is really in a
world by itself.  The Syntactic Revolution (Out of London Press, 1970)
is well worth the buy if you find one hiding in a bookstore.

& thanks to Joel L for the Weldon Kees nod.  Led me to a detailed New
Yorker article on his disappearance & life...

a Happy Mother's Day to all the  Mothers here--


and to think  & remember and honor too all the mothers whose husbands,
children, parents, cousins, friends are being killed, attacked, tortured,
are in prisons known and unknown, hidden away in secret, the mothers of the
addicts and the missing, the mothers in prisons from the largest in Gaza to
the smallest ones--the ones inside an abusive home--
homeless mothers--forgotten mothers--mothers denied and excluded----

and Mother Earth--

the discussion about the real or rumored art exhibition with the real or
rumored dog being really or not mistreated--

reminded me yet again for the  countless time something my mother said when
i was a child

i remember it in more detail than if i had only heard it the one time as it
was repeated many times through the years and --just the other day again-

People who get outraged at the treatment of a dog, a horse, and pride
themselves on their humanity and "civilization,"
will not bat an eyelash at the torture and injustice, the killing and hating
of persons they consider inferior--

because to them a dog is better than the people they consider beneath them
or see as  savages, subhumans, look down upon and won't waste a bit of
emotion or money or a scrap of food on, while they lavish a dog at the table
like a king.

So on Mother's Day i think of all the Mothers
who maybe have no one or hardly any one to think and honor them

after all how many such Mothers directly and indirectly are not being
created daily by "humane" and "civilized" peoples "like us" who forget that
the art of prison and torture and exhibition of these is being carried out
every day with tacit and or open  consent--

and I thank my mother who taught me this

David,

That's quite an odd conclusion to reach -- Being outraged (or concerned) about one injustice inherently excludes being outraged by another?

How does one grossly (mis) characterize a discussion about how far the merits and name of art will allow one to go when it comes to the ethical treatment of animals as "lavishing a dog like a king", while at the same time concluding that people who are concerned with a specific issue of ethics are *not* concerned with the treatment of people?

In fact, you imply that by discussing this issue, we would assume other people are "inferior" and worthless.  That's some assumption and a terrible example of either/or thinking.  Either we care about how animals are treated or we care about how people are treated -- but we can't do both?  Wow.

Amy

You're right -- the treatment of animals and for what purposes i=

Mark,=0A=0AYou're right -- the treatment of animals and for what purposes i=
s not so black and white.  I too never assumed so.  In fact, I've struggled=
 with the issue on a personal level, often hypocritically, for years.  I ea=
t seafood as though those living beings don't have feelings.  I've been sic=
k as of late and have turned to chicken soup, something I haven't eaten sin=
ce 1990.  I buy kosher and organic whenever possible.  I cross my fingers a=
nd hope that promise that the animals were given food and treated humanely =
is true.  I don't condemn people who eat animals or wear their by-products;=
 I'd walk around angry all the time, especially at myself.  Eliminating the=
 products of animals from our lives seems next to impossible.  =0A=0ABut wh=
en folks get bogged down or distracted by an "It's art" claim when it comes=
 to issues of accountability (usually to shirk accountability), most especi=
ally by people such as artists who are making a public statement using anim=
als, the territory gets dangerous.  These "artists" try to set the terms an=
d evade the ethical questions, as Vargas has done.   He treated the dog in =
terms he won't acknowledge for "the greater good" of other starving dogs.  =
Great.   He brought attention to those dogs?  There was no other way than t=
o seemingly abuse one of them?  Somehow I don't imagine that all of the oth=
er citizens of Costa Rica sit around idly ignoring what I'm sure is dubbed =
the starving dog problem.  Certainly there are organizations he could produ=
ce a campaign for. He could speak out, contribute time, use his public pers=
ona to recruit attention and volunteers, any number of other efforts I can'=
t imagine at the moment.  Instead, the outrage he produced has
 instead focused on his dubious treatment of one dog, rightfully so, instea=
d of the cause he claims to have exhibited a starving dog for.  How effecti=
ve was his "piece" in its goal?  Could he have been more effective?  =0A=0A=
Those who consider the ethical before the supposed artistic "gains" are dis=
missed with a variety of reasons, mostly ones that implicate they are not s=
ophisticated enough to understand the artist's aesthetics.  We are then sup=
posed to feel less-then-intellectual and quiet down in embarrassment.   Som=
e of these "aesthetics" have managed to erase the ethical and lead to think=
ing like eugenics (Yeats, Eliot) and even the advancement of the Holocaust.=
  Wasn't Hitler, after all, trying to make things better?   Some have calle=
d him an artist.  Didn't he sell that vision?  The art produced under his r=
egime, especially that of Riefenstahl's and her ground-breaking aesthetics,=
 cost many lives and much torture.  =0A=0ANow without the shock value, wher=
e would Vargas be?  Would he be a decent artist?  Would he be noticed?  Are=
n't art and aesthetics about much more than finding the next shock value bo=
undary?  =0A=0AOn another note and for those folks who are interested in th=
e treatment of animals, most especially ourselves, I just started reading w=
hat already seems like a brilliant new book by Barbara Kingsolver, ANIMAL, =
VEGETABLE, MINERAL:  http://www.kingsolver.com/bookshelf/miracle.asp=0A=0AA=

 and live on local or home-grown food for a=0Afull calendar year.=0A=0AThis=
 meant no snack foods, no processed ones, no cucumbers from=0Awarmer parts =
of the world. =E2=80=9CSix eyes, all beloved to me, stared=0Aunblinking as =

=E2=80=9CAnimal, Vegetable, Miracle=E2=80=9D provides a=0Ahelpful shorthand=

A collaboratively written and performed melodrama, Wild West show,

The wars have changed, but the appetite for images in America has not.
The Widow Party comprises a Buffalo Bill dumb show at the end of time, a ro=
otin=E2=80=99 tootin=E2=80=99 aeschatology with sound effects and featuring=
 Pentagon-bankrolled expert commentary by Britney Spears.  With miracle twi=

Alison: I couldn't agree more (including about most conceptual art).

To clarify, by "The casual but necessary cruelty of the barnyard and
the hunt may prepare those who live with them to an aestheticization
of death," I meant that the omnipresence of death in those
circumstances might desensitize some to the extent that there could
be an aesthetic distance from the experience. Note the conditional tense.

Years ago I noticed that even so benign an activity as gardening has
its brutal side. It took a while for me to get used to the
elimination of plants--not just weeds, and not just those that fail
to thrive, but the godlike act of thinning, and the uprooting of
plants that would otherwise absorb nutrients after they've finished
producing food. To feed oneself requires selecting what's to live and
what's to die.

In Habacuc's case, to amplify your point: the social class that goes
to galleries passes not just starving dogs but masses of people near
starvation or threatened by it. In Latin America the moneyed classes
have taught themselves not to notice either. I'd guess that dog was a
standin for its human compatriots.

Dear Amy:

I am simply saying what my mother told me.

She didn't mean the things that you think she does, but something quite
different.

Something which is actually pretty true.

Her family is Quebecois-Ojibway.  The Quebecois until the 1960's had very
few rights in Canada and were called "the white  n***s  of north America."
(The name also used for one of the founding works of Quebec Separatism  and
recognition as a separate culture.)

The Indians were killed in her family with poisoned blankets, the
French-Indians driven off their land and forced to leave the country.
Arrived  here, mixed people in America were on the bottom of the heap.

People with pedigreed dogs telling one you can't come in a store, go to the
regular school, get such and such a kind of job because of being what you
are.

Even today the USA refuses to sign the International Recognition of Rights
of Indigenous Peoples, so Indians remain "less than equal" in a great many
ways.

Extend that to the billions spent on torturing other peoples, detaining
them, spying on citizens, funding the hells from Gaza to Afghanistan- to al
those clandestine prisons around the world--and the mass graveyards that
once were cities here--poverty ridden, internal refugees wandering the land
again like the Depression--

The point she was and is making is that millions of people are tortured
daily, starved, beaten, and it is like a big public art show--the galleries
of Abu Ghraib with the fotos being taken for example--with dogs being used
on humans--

It is not a judgement in the way that you understand it that she is making,
nor an either or, nor judging the discussion about ethics and aesthetics.

What she is saying is what is known as an observation.

There is such a thing in this world as a statement of an observation, of
what one has seen and lived and seen others do also.

I've lived in a great many places and countries and in every one it is the
same--
people make observations.

the observation is enough--
it doesn't imply anything or function in the ways that you are writing of.

It is also one of the world's oldest forms of humor and irony, to make an
observation and say things as they are and not in the way one is supposed to
say them,"to say what everyone knows and sees yet does not dare to say"
which in certain situations is also known as "speaking truth to power," or
"telling it like it is."

In her case, there are no such claims being made; it is simply an
observation.

A lot of times in life, an observation can help one see the absurdity or
humor of a situation that might otherwise be intolerable.

It is not condemning others as you may think it is, but a way of keeping
oneself alive when the odds don't look so good.

To find hope where there is despair, laughter where there is none, or none
allowed.

To be a human being, after all.

 seems next to impossible.=C2=A0 =0A=0ABut when folks get bogged down or di=
stracted by an "It's art" claim when it comes to issues of accountability (=
usually to shirk accountability), most especially by people such as artists=
 who are making a public statement using animals, the territory gets danger=
ous.=C2=A0 These "artists" try to set the terms and evade the ethical quest=

 quiet down in embarrassment.=C2=A0 Some of these "aesthetics" have managed=
 to erase the ethical and lead to thinking like eugenics (Yeats, Eliot) and=
 even the advancement of the Holocaust.=C2=A0 Wasn't Hitler, after all, try=

eading what already seems like a brilliant new book by Barbara Kingsolver, =

th=C2=A0 of Another Innocent Animal=0A=0AAmy:=0A=0AI of course agree with y=
ou, but it's not always =0Aso straightforward. Most of us kill, at least by=
 =0Aproxy, to eat, and some animals are raised for =0Athat purpose. I remem=
ber a performance piece in =0ANew York in which an artist beat a chicken to=
 =0Adeath against the strings of a piano. Horrible. =0ABut I've also been a=
t a religious ceremony in =0Awhich a chicken's throat was cut so that it bl=
ed =0Ato death. The ceremony seemed less horrible, and =0Anot just because =
the killing was quicker--it =0Aseemed something like more justified, though=
 for =0Ame as an outsider the bird's near-panic has stayed with me.=0A=0AAu=
dubon killed every bird in his Birds of North =0AAmerica and arranged their=
 bodies in positions he =0Ahad observed them take when they were alive. =0A=
Thousands of birds. There was no other way to do =0Ait. The water colors an=
d the prints he made of =0Athem are one of the glories of 19th Century art.=
 =0ANobody asked the birds what they thought. By the =0Atime of Audubon's d=
eath one of the birds he =0Adepicted was extinct, because of habitat =0Ades=
truction, and he was aware that it was headed =0Ain that direction. Another=
 became extinct 60 =0Ayears after his death, slaughtered for food.=0A=0AThe=
 casual but necessary cruelty of the barnyard =0Aand the hunt may prepare t=
hose who live with them =0Ato an aestheticization of death.=0A=0ALeni Riefe=
nstahl's Triumph of the Will is one of =0Athe monuments of film. One needn'=
t go into detail =0Aabout what it cost. I sat through it once, and =0Aleft =
the theater homicidal with grief and rage. =0ANot an experience I plan to r=
epeat. As a Jew, of =0Acourse, every time I engage with a work of Christian=
 art I'm aware of the cost.=0A=0AMost of us have attitudes about bullfighti=
ng, as =0Aoutsiders. Otherwise tender-hearted Spaniards and =0AMexicans are=
 devoted to it, as an art as well as =0Aa sport. I used to watch bullfights=
 on =0Atelevision--they were broadcast to NY for several =0Ayears from the =
ring in Tijuana. I had a small =0Ascreen black and white tv and grainy rece=
ption, =0Aso the expience was considerably distanced. I =0Awent to one corr=
ida years later. It was =0Afascinating, and also necessary for my slow =0Ai=
mmersion in Latin American culture. It was also =0Aextremely disturbing. Bu=
t the bullring produced =0AGoya's Tauromaquia, and also Picasso's.=0A=0AOne=
 could detail the cruelties of all the sports =0Ain which animals are used,=
 and also the art =0Aproduced by devotees. Is it less gratuitous to =0Abree=
d horses for speed and then run them so hard =0Athat their legs break? At l=
east injury and death =0Ais not an intended part of the spectacle, as in =
=0Abullfights, dogfights or cockfights, or the =0Apitting of animals of one=
 species against =0Aanother. All of these have been central to various cult=
ures.=0A=0AAnd of course there's boxing.=0A=0ANone of this of course excuse=
s an artist who's =0Amaking a political point at the expense of =0Aanother =
creature. Had Habacuc refrained there =0Awould still be enormous numbers of=
 starving feral =0Adogs on the streets of Central America, and there =0Awou=

Hi Amy

I wasn't saying the artist's actions weren't problematic. Nor was I
questioning those who have been quietly campaigning for better conditions
for those dogs or other animals. I was saying that I find the internet
campaign even more problematic than the artist's actions.

It seems to me on par with the kind of media focus which zeroes in on a
little girl being flown out of Iraq by USUK forces for an operation while
ignoring the thousands of injured children suffering inside the country - in
order to be to able to ignore those children - (or any other of a million
cases of media exceptionalism).  What I find troubling is that this campaign
is driven by the kind of outrage that flares up at the intersection of
CRUELTY TO ANIMALS and ART, brief, bright and full of emotionalism, which
essentially draws on an unconscious social resentment against the whole idea
of art that is here given permission and expression.

There is little room here for anything except condemnation. Many people
refuse even to contemplate the possibility, for instance, that the dog might
have been treated humanely. And anyone who wonders past condemnation is
immediately on the "other side, the "enemy". It's probably worth remembering
why Albert Speer became a Nazi: his decision, he said, was "purely
emotional". Or maybe taking the time out to read some of Musil's
commentaries on early Nazi Germany, where he realised in despair that
rational argument no longer had any purchase in public discourse. I think
public emotionality that erases rational response is worth a little
scepticism.

All best

Alison

I agree re Kees. A good bio, Vanished Act, appeared a few years back. The
short stories and posthumous novel, Fall Quarter, are well worth reading
too.

Still, the late Donald Justice, a very good minor poet, discovered and introduced Kees as one of the most important poets of his generation. Without Justice, Kees (his work) would have been forgotten. & that is as sad as the man's apparent suicide.

Dear Barbara Bush, I've only recently seen footage of the destruction caused
to your home on the beach in Kennebunkport when it was battered and flooded
by the storm of 1991. Much of your husband's memorabilia for his
presidential library was washed away or forever ruined. This is the home
after all where he conducted his famous command post for his famous Gulf
War. All his precious memories of war were gone forever, his giant
presidential footprint suddenly blurred.

The footage I saw though is not just of your damaged home, but of you, and
your husband picking through the wreckage. Do you remember when one of the
reporters asked you and your husband what you intended to DO NEXT? You were
both clearly irritated by the question. Your husband turned to the camera
and snapped, "This is our HOME, it's our family home, we're going to
rebuild!" And you? You added, "We need to pick up the pieces and go on." Do
you remember that? Do you remember being in that home with your husband, and
reporters, and feeling put upon by the idea that it was all over for you at
Kennebunkport?

Do you remember what you said years later in Huston after Hurricane Katrina
hit New Orleans and many of that storm's victims were taking refuge in your
state of Texas? Instead of thinking about your misfortune from years prior,
and how you could lend an empathetic hand to the suffering citizens of your
country who were literally ON THE FLOOR of the sports arena around you, you
chose the most selfish, most wicked thing to say. Let me remind you:

What I'm hearing, which is sort of scary, is they all want to stay in Texas.
Everyone is so overwhelmed by the hospitality. And so many of the people in
the arena here, you know, were underprivileged anyway, so this is working
very well for them.

With this deplorable, dismissive statement you make it very clear how devoid
you are of sympathy, but more important, devoid of empathy. YOU are the wife
and mother of presidents and you choose to lend no one your hand as you walk
among them, their lives in shambles. YOU who could say such a thing gave
birth to, and reared a son who would be nicknamed The Death Penalty
Governor. But that's nothing of course compared to his one million dead in
Iraq. Your son, the man Alexander Cockburn said would be "better if he
claimed he'd been turned out on a mountainside in infancy and suckled by
wolves."

Maybe Cockburn is right about the wolf mother. Your sons have all been
treacherous scoundrels with S&amp;L scams, stealing elections, torturing and
bombing. But really you are no different from many of the other mothers and
wives of American presidents. A country whose brutal murder, theft and
enslavement has been given the revisionist fairy tale of rugged
individualism. The PROUD American making the world safer and whiter and
whiter and brighter.

But just the same, I look forward to your death Barbara Bush, and the deaths
of all your wicked, racist, sexist, homophobic, Jesus Loving men. And I
would tell you to go to Hell, but Hell is what you and your men have already
brought us. So I'm not sure where to tell you to go, but I'd settle for
anything off the planet, and THE SOONER THE BETTER!

Ok, so a close friend of mine has written me to assure me that this is
completely untrue. He happens to be a close friend of Habacuc, and had the
following to say:


1. The "happening" if you want to call it that way, was in the memory of
Natividad Canda, a Nicaraguan attacked to death by two dogs when he was
trying to steal from a service garage in San Jose. Neither the police nor
the fire department were not able to stop the dogs from attacking Mr. Canda=
.
They used pressurized water and were not able to use their guns fearing
they'd shoot the person.
2. The death of Mr. Canda was taped on video by La Extra TV, a well known
tabloid (yellow) newspaper in Costa Rica, and anyone did a single
blog-post-I=B4m against to- thing about Mr. Canda. We are talking about the
actual death of a PERSON vs. the possible death of a dog!!!!
3.Habacuc is an open dog lover. He has several dogs running around his
house, none of them attached to a rope, all of them well fed.
4. The dog actually was fed and escaped after the 1st night of the show.
Please, be so kind to not only read the yellow stuff on the blogs or
newspapers... inform yourself!!!
5. The piece is a critic as well for all of us, that walk down the street,
see a starving dog or the dog tied to a rope at the neighbour=B4s garden an=
d
don=B4t do nothing about it.

My guess is that all of you are doing exactly what Habacuc wanted... showin=
g
so wide open that you are either misinformed about the whole Canda-dog-show
thing, not mentioning the fact that this whole thing came out on the media
almost 6 months after the show in Nicaragua... by La Extra.

Thanks, Alison. I would add that when I first received one of the e-mails o=

demning this artist immediately. Then I thought, wait a minute, I'd better =
look into it a bit first--and when I did, I found two things: There was lit=
tle or no independent confirmation of almost any of the information given i=
n it, and many of the people protesting against the artist were writing the=
 most sickening things, calling for his deathm saying he should be starved =
and tortured, etc. And so I finally decided that in the absence of any veri=
fiable information, I would rather be on the side of someone who calls hims=
elf an artist than on the people who were calling for the artist to be star=
ved and tortured.=0A=0A=0A=0A----- Original Message ----=0AFrom: Alison Cro=

A friend gave me Kees's Selected Poems for my twentieth birthday, which was
a lifetime ago. I was instantly infatuated with "1926", and it remains a
model for me, a perfect poem. "The End of the Library" is also never far
from my thoughts.

I'd like to point out the current issue of the London Review of Books conta=
ins--along with a wild and witty poem by our own Wystan Curnow--an unusuall=
y good essay on Sharkespeare's sonnets, by Barbara Everett (whose writing I=
 had not previously been aware of). Unfortunately it is only available onli=
ne to subscribers but it is worth seeking out the print edition. "These poe=
ms are both anonymous and individual.They are both easy and difficult.... T=
he Sonnets seek to move through and beyond the whole utilitarianism of the =
Tudor ethos, the concept of goodness as use, as profit, which unites the El=
izabethan farmyard to the guild and the court: to find an innate metaphysic=
 in human love itself...Such stability as these poems achieve depends on a =
voice, and the partial animation of an always peripheral fiction: more prec=
isely, on the depth of interior feeling with which that fiction of relation=
ship takes on life, is proved true. But that =E2=80=98truth=E2=80=99 is as =
hard
 to analyse as it is original. Led to read the story as autobiography, we s=
earch in vain for dependable data. Unlike other sonneteers, Shakespeare now=
here names his beloved, except just conceivably in the early and punning 14=
5, which may name Hathaway (=E2=80=98=E2=80=9CI hate=E2=80=9D from hate awa=
y she threw=E2=80=99). Comparably, the poet evokes the passing of time bril=
liantly, and yet gives not a single hint of a date in the whole sequence...=
.The sonnets are beginning to be intense love poems; by =E2=80=98love=E2=80=
=99 they mean the tired horse trudging on and groaning at the goad, actors =
forgetting their lines, death-bells ringing in the churches of the City, st=
one lions and sea waves, poisons and medicines, ruined chapels and winter t=
rees, music being played by a loved and hated woman, obsession and infideli=
ty and tenderness and time always passing. And because the medium and only =
centre is the experiencing self, they relate love also to the hand writing =
and the eye reading."

Yes, exactly, and the reason it's dangerous is the now-common notion that "anything is
art that anyone says is art". Without such an underlying notion, what chance would
there be for any artist to try to shirk accountability for their views? The interesting thing
about Vargas's installation is the challenge it makes to "anything is art that anyone
says is art", not in its utility as a prod to take better care of animals.

It seems to me that far from trying to evade the ethical questions, Vargas's installation
raises them. He doesn't answer them, but is it a necessary requirement of art that the
artist answer all the questions he or she raises?

This is confusing the utility of individual action as social and political work with the idea
of art. You seem to be arguing that art is not an appropriate medium to use to bring
attention to social or political issues, because art is somehow either inapprproprieate
or lacks the same utility that art-less efforts such as advertising or PR or whatever
other art-less efforts at which you are vaguely gesturing. You seem to be arguing that
art ought not be used for such social or political work; that the artist is obliged to pitch
into advertising or PR campaigns instead of using art as a social or political tool.

Is effectiveness toward a political or social goal the measure you use for art, then? Art
is that which has utility in service of a political or social goal of which you approve, and
all actions which bring your opinions into question are ipso facto bad and wrong?

To make the audience feel unintelligent and quiet them down seems to me to be the
goal behind "Art is anything anyone says it is". The notion that the artist has a free
pass to do anything whatever, so long as he or she claims it is art, is a demand that
the audience should simply accept whatever the artist does as art because the artist
has done it. Sometimes this notion is phrased in terms of the audience being
responsible for creating the art itself in response to the presentation, an explicit
attempt to shift the responsibility for the art work from the artist to the audience. I'm as
eager as anyone to require that the audience have enough life experience and art
education to be able to place a piece of art in its appropriate context in order to make
judgments about it, but that's not the goal of "Art is anything anyone says it is", nor the
collateral "The audience makes the art".

This is an interesting set of questions -- you are arguing that decent artists get noticed,
and that they are noticed because they are decent at what they do. It takes only a little
reflection to see that this is simply wrong on the face of it. The ten-thousandth-best
plumber makes a nice living; the thousandth-best violinist starves. In the endeavor of
art there is more supply than there is demand, and it's hard to think of any society in
which that has not been true. There are many many more "decent artists" than are
"noticed"; being a decent artist is no guarantee of notice, and notice is no guarantee of
quality. You're confusing and conflating ideas here with abandon, and your argument
is, as a result, very bad.

I'd be interested to hear what you, as a postmodern artist, think art and aesthetics IS
about, if you don't think it's about finding the next shock value boundary. After all,
modernity and post-modernity in art seem to be, in fact, about finding the next shock
value boundary. That's where the "notice" is; and that's where it is because of the
underlying theory of "Art is anything an artist says it is".

Once again, my view is that art is NOT "anything an artist says it is", and I hold that
tormenting animals (except literary critics -- oh, it's a joke, for god's sake! lighten up!)
is wrong, even if the tormenter claims it's art. My question here strikes at the root of
the modern and postmodern view of the world that holds that anything is art that
anyone says is art. IF that's true, WHY is tormenting animals NOT art, if the tormenter
claims it is? On what aesthetic grounds does the modernist or postmodernist stand
who says that there are some things that are not art, when the platform of modernism
and postmodernism is that anything is art that someone says is art?

Alison,

Your pithy description of the effect of conceptual art on the person is
quite similar to mine, except that the short road extends in "words,"
discussions, like this one.

I also share your ambivalence towards the whole situation. Do some of you
remember some comments after September 11 that the whole Twin Towers
spectacle was a piece of art?

The issue of "cruelty," "heartlessness," "Irresponsibility" arises, not
necessarily unjustly,when the artist or his/her medium encounters actual
events. What about war photography or the footage of New Orleans disaster.
Great art, it seems to me, is always a bringer of news. Consequently,
particularly in visual media, someone is standing by and registering while a
horrible event is taking place. Should that stop? One of the most
unforgettable documentaries I ever saw was about the slaughtering of cows on
English farms, interviewing the farmers, recording the food they eat, etc.
There was also an interview of the person who went from farm to farm to do
the killing (his job a professional name I can't remember at this moment),
how he sized the cows, locating the point in the forehead where the cow
needed to be struck, the animal buckling, later the blood gushing out. This
guy was in his last job before his retirement, which the documentary was
shooting. There was an interview/discussion towards the end how the
abattoirs were taking over the job. It was an amazing film of process, as
Alison says, of "life on the farm."

This does not mean that the idea of a starving dog in a museum does not
disturb me. It has the quality of watching an execution for entertainment.
Of course, are art and games different or the same? The same issue, between
a digital game and some intermedia digitals poems.

Ciao,

Murat

CFP: Companion Book on Charles Bernstein

I'm seeking articles, interviews, and even some creative responses to
the work of the American poet/theorist Charles Bernstein for the
forthcoming book The Salt Companion to Charles Bernstein.  The
articles can deal with any aspect of Bernstein's work, from specific
books of poetry and theory to his poetic influences to his part in the
L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E movement.

Completed articles should range from 6,500-10,000 words, though
exceptions can be made for exceptional articles.

 Please send abstracts (250-500 words) of the articles and queries
about the interviews/creative response pieces by December 1, 2008 to
William Allegrezza at wallegre@iun.edu or wallegrezza@gmail.com.
Include your CV or bio and send your abstract in Word format as a
.pdf.

Dear Barry and Poetics,

I don't think the warding-off of Language poetry is disingenuous at all. I
understand this warding-off not even as a gesture, but a fundamental
distinction. And the distinction is only made ~ i think ~ because we readers
find it all too easy to defer to Language poetry, amplifying its ubiquity,
resting on its tended grounds: especially American readers with little or no
knowledge of the last 50 years of experimental British poetry. Keston is
writing out of a tradition that has very little to do with Language poetry
directly; a tradition that Language poetry parallels; and one that has
publicly articulated its distance from Language poetry on several occasions
over the past 20 years (at least). See for example Jeremy Prynne's letter to
Steve McCaffery in The Gig, issue 9. If you do not have access to this
letter, I can scan it in and put it online. I have read Bruce Andrews with
certain pleasures, but his poetry is not one that I go back to often, as I
do Keston Sutherland's. Hot White Andy, especially, articulates contemporary
thought<->feeling complexes in a way that I could never have imagined
before, much less find in any other poem. What semblance of Andrews you
might find in HWA is perhaps a pattern of isolated surface glints which do
not extend to a prosodical isomorphism or an equivalence re the greater
meanings one might abstract from these works.

Interesting stuff, for sure. But Wilkinson's warding-off gesture toward Lan=

Jim,

For some reason, through a mental glitch, I keep sending you a reply
containing only the word "there." I wonder, does "there" become an image
then, less and less concrete and specific?

I am not sure whether we are agreeing or disagreeing? As far as I can see,
you see that transformation from image to language one directional only,
from concrete to abstract? Is that really so. Saturday, I saw an absolutely
atrocious, ridiculous really!, movie with Al Pacino, *88 Hours,* where for a
stretch of a few minutes the apple logo was everywhere on the screen, on
every computer of students in an amphitheatre clasroom and once covering, a
huge apple logo, covering the whole background. It was grotesque, unless the
film is taken as a science fiction horror movie, which obviously was not. Is
that the concreteness you are talking about?

Or is it the concreteness of "I see what I see"?

Of course, appearances are deceitful; that's what 50% of literature is
about. When writing is placed ambiguously in space, its directional vectors
get blurred; therefore, the specifity of both verbal language (syntax) and
the space it occupies gets blurred -moving towards a kind of silence,
disruption of the tongue, etc., etc.

Ciao,

Murat

Hey everyone -

This deal is just for Poetics and friends of Poetics; I'm not listing it on
the Observable website or broadcasting it in any other way.

I need to sell as many Observable chapbooks as I can before I move to
California, so starting today I'm going to clear them out at 4 for $10.

I noticed that one list member dissed Kees simply on that basis that Dana
Gioia likes him (actually editing his short stories). And I suppose that for
many List Members Donald Justice is also a poetry anti-christ. I think this
is a reason that Kees attracts so little interest in the innovative writing
community. But it is worth remembering that a number of innovative writers
owe some attention from mainstream sources. David Schubert, that proto-NY
School Poet, owes his poetic life to Theodore Weiss, a minor formalist who
was his friend and happened to publish Quarterly Review of Lit., an
important Journal of its era. Celan's first champions in English were George
Steiner (in After Babel) and translator Michael Hamburger.
Curious to speculate what would have happened if Kees decided to hang in
there. By '57, the Black Mountains poets bean settling in san Francisco,
with poets like Creeley and Olson sharing tastes in art, jazz and the kind
of "happenings" that Kees was staging in san Francisco.

I neglected to add before that I use Kees' work as much as possible when I'm
teaching. Some of it is too oblique to turn into an idea to get grade or
middle schoolers writing within a 40 minute class, but the first "Robinson"
poem, for example, has such marvelous detail and inherent mood that it often
provokes quite interesting responses.

Why, you have, Halvard. You quote Duchamp, and you regularly offer quotes and
comments that indicate that you yourself think "anything is art that anyone says is art".
Have you changed your mind?

This weekend marks what I'm pretty sure is Fiona Templeton's Chicago debu=
t.
 She's doing her work in progress Bluebeard, along with Zukofsky's Rudens=
.=20
& (despite rumors to the contrary) May is Chicago's best month--so co=
me out
if you can!

Links Hall
956 Newport St.
Chicago
773.281.0824

PROGRAM THREE
Friday & Saturday, May 16 & 17, 8pm
Sunday, May 18, 7pm
$12 ($10 students)

Fiona Templeton
Louis Zukofsky's Rudens and Fiona Templeton's Bluebeard (excerpt)
Templeton directs two plays: Rudens is a very seldom performed work,
based on The Rope by the Roman comic playwright T. Maccius Plautus. It
combines a number of strategies of textual conversion, and is
translated to English phonetically by using the sound of the original
language.
Bluebeard is about two people imagining how each other think, what
each other fears or desires, and what each fears or desires of the
other. It is a ventriloquial work, in which the onstage action or even
speaker may belie the subject of the speech.

Collaborators:             Joel Craig lives in  Chicago , working as
an art director and deejay. His poems have appeared in several
publications, and he is co-founder and curator for The Danny's Reading
Series. Laura Goldstein is a writer and multi-media and sound artist
who currently teaches at  Loyola University and performs and
collaborates in  Chicago . Her work is widely published and her
chapbook is due out this spring.

That was the composer Hans Werner Henze, if memory serves. It caused quite =
an uproar. What he meant, he explained at the time, was that the destructio=
n of the towers was a piece of drama, and as such was spectacularly effecti=
ve. He was right. He certainly wasn't condoning or admiring it.

The lack of sophistication of Al Qaida was revealed by its failure to follo=
w up, in the most absurd, easiest to organize, and least destructive way. I=
magine in the days and months immediately after a series of cherry bombs go=
ing off at all hours in mail boxes. Imagine the impact on the national psyc=
he. The point was, after all, to demonstrate our vulnerability.

murat,

you "proposed" that "the visual is a space (maybe a meditative one, at the
edge of language) where the syntactical, semantic and other classifications
of language do not enter."

but i think they do "enter". creatures that have eyes also have brains that
'make sense' of what they see according to their own syntax and semantics of
the visual.

Jim,

The purpose of such a visual image is the emptiness it creates; that's what
I mean by the "photographic Image," as opposed to a logo. Partly, this is
due to the multiplicity of vectors, for instance words on a page, not spread
in purely linear forms, may create (and this is not an easy thing to do);
consequently, causing hesitations in the viewer of such a page. Or in a
photograph, because the transmission of an image from an object to a plate *by
light* is not perfect (as it is not in 19th century photographs), many blurs
occur. Also, added to this the fact that the image one sees in a photograph
is constantly changing, because the object is constantly moving away from
the viewer (touched by time), the mind of the viewer opens to speculation,
to a dialogue with the image, entering its space. That is what I mean by the
porousness of the photographic image. I write about it in greater detail in
*The Peripheral Space*.

Ciao, to be continued,

Murat

It's generally accepted that the LANGUAGE movement started in the early 70's
with Bob Grenier's This  magazine and then progressed from there.
In a book I'm currently reading, the author states, and I quote:

"But in art, a school once established normally deteriorates as it goes on.
It achieves perfection in its kind with a startling burst of energy, a
gesture
too quick for the historian's eye to follow. He can never explain such a
movement
or tell us how exactly it happened. But once it is achieved, there is the
melancholy
certainty of a decline."

How does this quote relate to the LANGUAGE school?

Are we still too close in history to look back with objectivity;
especially since most of the LANGUAGE poets are still going strong,
be it LANGUAGE-centered poetry they're producing or not?

And did the movement/school officially have an end?

Ric

It was Stockhausen... fwiw, since it has some pertinency to this discussion=
,
the Wikipaedia entry has the comments:

In a press conference in Hamburg on September 16, 2001, Stockhausen was
asked by a journalist whether the characters in *Licht* were for him "merel=
y
some figures out of a common cultural history" or rather "material
appearances". The composer replied, "I pray daily to Michael, but not to
Lucifer. I have renounced him. But he is very much present, like in New Yor=
k
recently" (Stockhausen 2002, 76). The same journalist then asked how the
recent September 11 terrorist attacks affected him, and how he viewed these
reports in connection with the harmony of humanity represented in Hymnen. H=
e
answered:

Well, what happened there is, of course=97now all of you must adjust your
brains=97the biggest work of art there has ever been. The fact that spirits
achieve with one act something which we in music could never dream of, that
people practise ten years madly, fanatically for a concert. And then die.
[Hesitantly.] And that is the greatest work of art that exists for the whol=
e
Cosmos. Just imagine what happened there. There are people who are so
concentrated on this single performance, and then five thousand people are
driven to Resurrection. In one moment. I couldn't do that. Compared to that=
,
we are nothing, as composers. [...] It is a crime, you know of course,
because the people did not agree to it. They did not come to the "concert".
That is obvious. And nobody had told them: "You could be killed in the
process." (Stockhausen 2002, 76=9677.)

(To see how the excerpt appeared out of its context, and in English
translation, see Tommasini 2001.)

As a result of the reaction to the press report of Stockhausen's comments, =
a
four-day festival of his work in Hamburg was canceled. In addition, his
pianist daughter announced to the press that she would no longer appear
under the name "Stockhausen" (Lentricchia and McAuliffe 2003, 7).

In a subsequent message, he stated that the press had published "false,
defamatory reports" about his comments, and clarified as follows:

At the press conference in Hamburg, I was asked if Michael, Eve and Lucifer
were historical figures of the past and I answered that they exist now, for
example Lucifer in New York. In my work, I have defined Lucifer as the
cosmic spirit of rebellion, of anarchy. He uses his high degree of
intelligence to destroy creation. He does not know love. After further
questions about the events in America, I said that such a plan appeared to
be Lucifer's greatest work of art. Of course I used the designation "work o=
f
art" to mean the work of destruction personified in Lucifer. In the context
of my other comments this was unequivocal. (Stockhausen 2001a)

All best

Jim:

I agree. There are petroglyphs and pictoglyphs, and hieroglyphics, which are
perhaps the oldest linguistic expressions. If anything, we've lost the
ability to think in these terms, but it's still coded in our brains. Of
course people who write in ideographs haven't, or almost haven't, as these
are also evolving away.

Dear Murat and Alison:

for the last two years and more at my blog i've been exploring, documenting
and presenting art works and writings,mine and others,  Visual Poetry and
Mail Art, videos and music, news reports  that are involved with many of the
myriad questions of art/poetry and violence, war, occupation, and the new
architectures of Security and Surveillance--

Torture in relation with art is one of the bases for what for now I call
"The New Extreme Experimental American Poetry"--and arts--

an example of this inquiry may be found in the new issue of Wordforword:

*Waterboarding & Poetry:
Francois Villon & the New Extreme Experimental American Poetry
*http://www.wordforword.info/vol13/dbc.htm


Another subject i have written to this list on and posted at blog and
written about is the uses of disinformation throughout all forms of media,
which in turn are passed on into the daily consciousness of persons who
believe in it and pass it on, creating a network easily and swiftly
constructed for the creation of not only urban myths but also a non-stop
barrage of disinformation and propaganda planted under various guises.  The
MEMRI news network is the most notorious example, as it is the one that the
American media use for their "sources," and now there is a group called
Camera which openly calls for the alteration of Wikkipedia entries which
have anything to do with issues concerning the state of Israel.  The
alterations extend to changing maps on line, disappearing names of refugee
camps and villages, etc.  Similar sorts of "net-terrorism" are practised by
all manner of organizations and private individuals.  It is very easy to
create a faked event, artist, petition and garner immediate sympathies and
signings, passings on--

This means that as one finds things online and in the media, one needs to
continually check for the sources of the information and as well for any
forms of documentations, not only on line, but in libraries, on foot as it
were--"to find out for oneself" as Olson defined Herodotus' "istorin.."

In a sense one is involved in a continually ongoing series of researches
into aspects of sabotage, electronic counter-insurgency, "spy-vs-spy," and
hoaxes, propagandas and as well various "test programs" being tried out by
all manner of individuals and groups.

The virtualization of "battlefields" turns the web into an ever more
"militarized zone," creating what may be regarded as new "avant-gardes" in
terms of military-economic "advancements" and these followed close on the
heels by various forms of "avant-garde" "art projects" and "campaigns,"
petitions, constructions of "groups" and "consensus" around questions of art
itself and as well questions of ethics and ideologies, of silencings and
being forced to speak.

The battlefields of the virtual are ways in which Walls may be created like
the Walls on the ground--this can be done by a great many methods involving
every thing from list censorships to the concerted efforts of groups
organized to create the idea that their particular point of view is the only
"right" or "real" one.  Beyond that, the web's dependence on electricity
makes it easy to create further Walls on the virtual/ ground interface via
the destruction of power grids, the withholding of electricity from whole
communities and also by simply turning more and more people "off" due to the
inability to pay the bill.

Here in  Milwaukee, for example, more and more people simply can't afford
first their web hookup bill, then  their electric bill.  In winter time this
year a huge number of people had to choose between heat and
electricity--Limited to the use of public and school library computers,
which limit the time allowed on line, many have found that the libraries
also and the schools cannot pay the extra bills, and so more people are "cut
off" and out of the web.

By controlling access to electricity events such as the genocide in Rwanda,
the walling off of Burma and the destruction of grids in Iraq and control of
them from outside in Gaza, as well as economic control, it is already being
demonstrated the effectiveness of simply "pulling the plug" and leaving ever
more persons "outside the loop," which itself is being waged war over on
line.

Another use of electricity of course is that of torture--electric shock
being one of the most popular methods for many decades now and widely taught
in training camps, police and military academies and at the "classic
example" of the School for Torturers, the old School of the Americas, now
renamed to at least partially conceal its existence as the Western
Hemisphere Institute for Security Cooperation.

The uses of the web as sources of disinformation in turn confirmed  as
sources of information by the web--were made manifest in the "Curveball"
case which helped create the Power Point demonstrations Secretary and former
Gen Colin Powell used to present the case for the War in Iraq at the UN in
early 2003.  A similar situation has been being steadily created for the
last four years to lead up to attacks in Syria and Iran if something doesn't
change before much longer.

(The interrelationship of Jenny Holzer with the NSA web site is another
example, part of another piece re movies and classes at Guantanamo, the uses
of artist-designed massive corporate favored bean bag chairs at  Holzer's
"Projections," Star Wars, (with its Riefenstahl connections), Powell,
Curveball, the uses of paintings rather than photos and the subsequent high
priced fast selling Holzer paintings, and the eerily repeating language used
in the Holzer reviews and by herself is the subject of another essay,
"Putting Lipstick on a Pig.")

Whether or not anything at all is true in the case of this "artist torturing
dogs"--look what has happened--it has created a great stir and upset a great
many people.  Perhaps every single word written about it is a part of the
art work itself.  This is one of the issues I have been working with the
last few years first as paintings and Visual Poetry, then as essays and soon
after that an ongoing series of stories which grew out of the essays.

Considered together these various works  in several media  begin to
constitute an examination into various questions of Conceptual writing and
art, including performances of Visual pieces as sound poems, and the haptic
(touch) elements of their making which can be found in their textures and
the imprinting of the found objects and letterings used in their making.
They also function as "daily life documents" of a period of "new extreme
experimentalism" as the situation one lives in in this particular society.

What is interesting here is that this is the first time the issue of torture
has really been raised to such an extent on this list, and that it comes
about via a real or not art project involving a real or not artist and dog
and audience.  Interesting because at this time in the USA torture is a
subject openly spoken about in the Senate and Congress, argued about, and at
the same time circumvented by the various attorneys general of the last few
years as well as top ranking members of the Government, elected and
appointed both, from the President and Cabinet on down into various members
of the rank and file who operate as their bullies and messengers.

The US has long supported, funded and trained torturers for other countries
and at the same time pretended that it did not do the same itself.  Now
torture is something openly acknowledged and documented, and is  a sizable
chunk of the Defense and Homeland Security budgets, with prisons known and
uknwon scattered around the world in which murder and torture are a matter
of routine.

The US also has recently become not only the country with the highest
percentage of the population in prison, but first in sheer numbers alone.
With privatization of prisons due to overcrowdings and"poor management" by
the states, there has come a great increase in the violence done to those in
the prison system, not by other inmates, but by the guards and security
forces of privatized organizations which may or not have had any previous
experience at all in dealing with prisons and their issues.

There are a great many more aspects of these questions which I've been
studying, but one of the areas which has very much struck me is the ways in
which electricity itself is involved in new methods of territorialization,
torture, control, propaganda and the new ways in which one may examine the
"avant-garde" in terms of its originating military term and relationship,
which was one finds already in Baudelaire's notes re the telegraph
(electrically transmitted information as a means to control the stock
markets), the uses of modern transport systems as both "opening" and
"closing"--the railroads "opening the West"  being one of the means of
extermination of the American Indians and buffalo both, setting the tone for
transports to come in Europe.  Now it is the "rendition flight" which sends
persons off to their doom, their vanishings.

Every media becomes at once a method of "recording" and "reporting" and a
method of "disappearing," altering, editing, of creating "ghostly after
effects" as well as "phantom figures" who are or are not there, from one
moment to the next.  (Winston's job of daily altering the documents in
Orwell's 1984, so that the Party will always be proved to have been right,
is an example of this.)  The "creation of reality" which Karl Rove spoke of
as the right of the Imperialist project is one which is already at the heart
of the  simultaneously functioning military-virtual linkages since the
inventions of the first war machines that can function at a distance via the
transport of paths and roads and seas and that of the first written
languages.

Not-so-long-after the invention of writing--one finds the birth of the art
of forgery, an art which which it is known permeates the "art world," in
auctions, museums, galleries, private collections and homes, and which also
is continually asserting itself in the realm of currency itself.  Little
wonder then that forgery and disinformation should also permeate the web,
let alone many other aspects of "reality" and "virtuality."

One of the paradoxes of torture is that whether it is done openly or is
concealed, around it there is created a Wall of Silence--it is not to be
spoken of or written of or even hardly thought of, and the very use of it
helps to ensure that that silence is preserved as much as possible by both
the private individual (which via electronic surveillance as one writes
and/or speaks and reads and listens becomes less and less private and less
and less individual),  and the public.
 On the other hand, the goal of torture is to FORCE TO SPEAK.  "Freedom of
speech," is removed by both the Wall of Silence and the "forcing to speak,"
which is not a "free speech" at all.  Living among these "alternatives"
creates an ever more controlled and conforming society, in which it is less
and less allowed to question "reality" and "appearances;" or to question
what the role of language is,  in increasingly being challenged by
situations of remaining in  Silence or being  Forced  to Speak  that are
ever more narrowly limited in what is permissable as "Free Speech."

When the torturer, the bully, the "Bad Cop," the Thought Police ask a
question--it is to force a response, whether true or not does not matter so
much as that the person being questioned is forced to speak, to say
something, anything, because that saying alone is enough to convict on any
or no charges at all.  ( I wondered if this was true or not until
experiencing it myself a couple of times in "political prisons.")

When one considers that forgeries ("the Italian Letter," re the supposed
yellow cake purchased by Saddam from Niger, and the "evidence of rocket
equipment" which was spare parts for out of date Italian machines)--and
known lies ("Curveball") complete with "artist's depictions" rather than
photos  are used to launch wars and the deaths, tortures, detentions,
disappearances, making homeless of millions of people, when the true horrors
of ethnic cleansings, illegal occupations, collective punishments,
genocides, mass hunger, mass robbery of the lifetime savings of millions,
mass imprisonments and destruction of the environment,  can happen in broad
daylight and yet be made "invisible" or "silenced" because of mass
acceptance of the conditions between Silence and torture, one arrives at the
present situation, discussing the mistreatment or not of a real or not dog
by an artist who may or not exist--

as the creation of the situation of the present society.  For it seems a
"logical outcome" of the  processes of the "New Extreme Experimental
American Poetry" and arts as one may undertake to examine them and question
them.

The questions do need to be asked, because without doing so, it is very easy
to have them pass by as in many very similar ways they did in the 1930's in
Germany, the many similarities with which Naomi Wolf has written about in
The End of America  Letter of Warning to a Young Patriot and Naomi Klein
(The Shock Doctrine) and many others have written about in connection with
the effects of American economic, military and torture policies and actions
since the 1950's.

To essay an understanding of the development of a "totalitarian" system, one
needs to examine what may seem disparate, separate elements as being
actually both a part of and apart from each other in ways which play on
elements of punning, in the sense that things via camouflaging and forgings
as well as doublings, mirrorings,  may appear as concealed when they are
actually already revealed ("hidden in plain site/sight/cite") and vice
versa.

This is a method which can seem "as old as the hills," (though the hills, as
Emily Dickinson wrote in a letter, "know but do not tell,") compared to the
"shazzam" aspects of contemporary technologies, yet consider for example the
use of fertilizer in car bombings which kill and main hundreds from "Buda's
Wagon" in 1920 to the present, the use of good old fashioned Sumerian
forgery, the use of blatant lies told in the loudest and most repetitive
voice possible, or sand impeding the advance of the most super moder tanks,
or sugar poured in a gas tank--poison gas released in a subway system or a
plane hi jacked with a box cutter and used in a variation on the Trojan
Horse--or the old poison well trick updated to include municipal water
supplies that can kill millions--or the poison of highly addictive drugs
deliberately let run amok in targeted neighborhoods--consider that ancient
trick--"the nation is in danger"--to start cracking down on the citizens--to
round up "illegal immigrants, aliens," and  one begins to realize it is
still all in many ways at the street level adage of :  "The names may
change, the game remains the same."

I wonder, in the particular historical trajectory which LangPo occupies re:
neoliberalism/the financialization of capital, just how possible it is for
any British and American poetries to have very little to do with each other.

I think Justin makes a very good point. As broad as the world is
today, I think that experimental poetries have become rather
parochial. I certainly have a better understanding of the poetry of
my friends and acquaintances and the people I correspond with through
lists like this, and their immediate forebearers. What that means is
that Language Poetry, and more broadly "The New American Poetry"
figures very strongly in my own understanding of the poetic
landscape. I really have had to go out of my way to try to learn
about British poets other than Raworth, who possibly figures much
larger in my own view of British poetry than he should due to his
strong connections to a number of US poets.

And don't even get me started about how little I know about what's
going on in Canada, let alone Australia, New Zealand, Singapore,
South Africa and elsewhere in the English speaking world.

And honestly, while I definitely qualify this as a description of my
own limited exposure, I don't think I'm THAT unusual in this respect.

No humor, just bad philosophy: pushing the question to "Who is an artist?" and the
answer is (wait for it) "anyone who says he is".

The World at 350 A Last Chance for Civilization
By Bill McKibben
posted May 11, 2008

http://www.tomdispatch.com/post/174930

Even for Americans, constitutionally convinced that
there will always be a second act, and a third, and a
do-over after that, and, if necessary, a little public repentance and
forgiveness and a Brand New Start -- even for us, the world looks a little
Terminal right now.

It's not just the economy. We've gone through swoons
before. It's that gas at $4 a gallon means we're
running out, at least of the cheap stuff that built our sprawling society.
It's that when we try to turn corn into gas, it sends the price of a loaf of
bread shooting upwards and starts food riots on three continents. It's that
everything is so inextricably tied together. It's that, all of a sudden,
those grim Club of Rome types who, way back in the 1970s, went on and on
about the "limits to growth" suddenly seem... how best to put it, right.

All of a sudden it isn't morning in America, it's dusk
on planet Earth.

There's a number -- a new number -- that makes this
point most powerfully. It may now be the most important
number on Earth: 350. As in parts per million (ppm) of
carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.

A few weeks ago, our foremost climatologist, NASA's Jim
Hansen, submitted a paper to Science magazine with
several co-authors. The abstract attached to it argued
-- and I have never read stronger language in a
scientific paper -- "if humanity wishes to preserve a
planet similar to that on which civilization developed
and to which life on earth is adapted, paleoclimate
evidence and ongoing climate change suggest that CO2
will need to be reduced from its current 385 ppm to at
most 350 ppm." Hansen cites six irreversible tipping
points -- massive sea level rise and huge changes in
rainfall patterns, among them -- that we'll pass if we
don't get back down to 350 soon; and the first of them,
judging by last summer's insane melt of Arctic ice, may
already be behind us.

So it's a tough diagnosis. It's like the doctor telling
you that your cholesterol is way too high and, if you
don't bring it down right away, you're going to have a
stroke. So you take the pill, you swear off the cheese,
and, if you're lucky, you get back into the safety zone
before the coronary. It's like watching the tachometer
edge into the red zone and knowing that you need to
take your foot off the gas before you hear that clunk
up front.

In this case, though, it's worse than that because
we're not taking the pill and we are stomping on the
gas -- hard. Instead of slowing down, we're pouring on
the coal, quite literally. Two weeks ago came the news
that atmospheric carbon dioxide had jumped 2.4 parts
per million last year -- two decades ago, it was going
up barely half that fast.

And suddenly, the news arrives that the amount of
methane, another potent greenhouse gas, accumulating in
the atmosphere, has unexpectedly begun to soar as well. Apparently, we've
managed to warm the far north enough to start melting huge patches of
permafrost and massive quantities of methane trapped beneath it have begun
to bubble forth.

And don't forget: China is building more power plants;
India is pioneering the $2,500 car, and Americans are converting to TVs the
size of windshields which suck juice ever faster.

Here's the thing. Hansen didn't just say that, if we
didn't act, there was trouble coming; or, if we didn't
yet know what was best for us, we'd certainly be better
off below 350 ppm of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.
His phrase was: "...if we wish to preserve a planet
similar to that on which civilization developed." A
planet with billions of people living near those oh-so-floodable coastlines.
A planet with ever more vulnerable forests. (A beetle, encouraged by warmer
temperatures, has already managed to kill 10 times more trees than in any
previous infestation across the northern reaches of Canada this year. This
means far more carbon heading for the atmosphere and apparently dooms
Canada's efforts to comply with the Kyoto Protocol, already in doubt because
of its decision to start producing oil for the U.S. from Alberta's tar
sands.)

We're the ones who kicked the warming off; now, the
planet is starting to take over the job. Melt all that
Arctic ice, for instance, and suddenly the nice white
shield that reflected 80% of incoming solar radiation
back into space has turned to blue water that absorbs
80% of the sun's heat. Such feedbacks are beyond
history, though not in the sense that Francis Fukuyama
had in mind.

And we have, at best, a few years to short-circuit them
-- to reverse course. Here's the Indian scientist and
economist Rajendra Pachauri, who accepted the Nobel
Prize on behalf of the Intergovernmental Panel on
Climate Change last year (and, by the way, got his job
when the Bush administration, at the behest of Exxon
Mobil, forced out his predecessor): "If there's no
action before 2012, that's too late. What we do in the
next two to three years will determine our future. This
is the defining moment."

In the next two or three years, the nations of the
world are supposed to be negotiating a successor treaty
to the Kyoto Accord. When December 2009 rolls around,
heads of state are supposed to converge on Copenhagen
to sign a treaty -- a treaty that would go into effect
at the last plausible moment to heed the most basic and
crucial of limits on atmospheric CO2.

If we did everything right, says Hansen, we could see
carbon emissions start to fall fairly rapidly and the
oceans begin to pull some of that CO2 out of the
atmosphere. Before the century was out we might even be
on track back to 350. We might stop just short of some
of those tipping points, like the Road Runner
screeching to a halt at the very edge of the cliff.

More likely, though, we're the Coyote -- because "doing everything right"
means that political systems around the world would have to take enormous
and painful steps right away. It means no more new coal-fired power plants
anywhere, and plans to quickly close the ones already in operation.
(Coal-fired power plants operating the way they're supposed to are, in
global warming terms, as dangerous as nuclear plants melting
down.) It means making car factories turn out efficient
hybrids next year, just the way we made them turn out
tanks in six months at the start of World War II. It
means making trains an absolute priority and planes a
taboo.

It means making every decision wisely because we have
so little time and so little money, at least relative
to the task at hand. And hardest of all, it means the
rich countries of the world sharing resources and
technology freely with the poorest ones, so that they
can develop dignified lives without burning their cheap
coal.

That's possible -- we launched a Marshall Plan once,
and we could do it again, this time in relation to
carbon. But in a month when the President has, once
more, urged us to drill in the Arctic National Wildlife
Refuge, that seems unlikely. In a month when the
alluring phrase "gas tax holiday" has danced into our vocabulary, it's hard
to see (though it was encouraging to see that Clinton's gambit didn't sway
many voters). And if it's hard to imagine sacrifice here, imagine China,
where people produce a quarter as much carbon apiece as we do.

Still, as long as it's not impossible, we've got a duty
to try. In fact, it's about the most obvious duty
humans have ever faced.

A few of us have just launched a new campaign, 350.org.
Its only goal is to spread this number around the world
in the next 18 months, via art and music and ruckuses
of all kinds, in the hope that it will push those
post-Kyoto negotiations in the direction of reality.

After all, those talks are our last chance; you just
can't do this one light bulb at a time. And if this
350.org campaign is a Hail Mary pass, well, sometimes
those passes get caught.

We do have one thing going for us: This new tool, the
Web which, at least, allows you to imagine something
like a grassroots global effort. If the Internet was
built for anything, it was built for sharing this
number, for making people understand that "350" stands
for a kind of safety, a kind of possibility, a kind of
future.

Hansen's words were well-chosen: "a planet similar to
that on which civilization developed." People will
doubtless survive on a non-350 planet, but those who do
will be so preoccupied, coping with the endless
unintended consequences of an overheated planet, that civilization may not.

Civilization is what grows up in the margins of leisure
and security provided by a workable relationship with
the natural world. That margin won't exist, at least
not for long, this side of 350. That's the limit we
face.

College and co-founder of 350.org. His most recent book
is The Bill McKibben Reader.

joel,

if it's any indication that kees work does capture "interest in the
innovative writing community," Unending Design: The Forms of
Postmodern Poetry by joseph conte has a very useful and sympathetic
take on kees in the context of serialism and canonic variation
(creeley, zukofsky, mac low). this was my introduction to kees, for
which i remain quite grateful. (and i enjoy your speculating on your
"what if..." scenario below as well!)

ric,

to me the quotation you offer sounds like a fairly romanticized notion
of how artistic movements work. i mean i suppose in some cases the
originary moment of expression "achieves perfection in its kind with a
startling burst of energy," but let's say with dada, would that be:
the performances at the cabaret voltaire, duchamp's bicycle wheel, or
artaud's ubu roi? for punk rock, would that be the sex pistols, the
stooges or the velvet underground? also this idea that "can never
explain such a movement or tell us how exactly it happened" sounds
like nonsense: of course, we can never know exactly, but that's the
historian's job to construct a compelling narrative from the available
evidence.

what i think is true is that emergent formations are often not seen
for what they are at the time, and that eventually those "startling
bursts" become codified by the time the larger culture catches up (or
enabling it to catch up). and it's often the belated
observer/historian who identifies and names the formation as such,
often based on those codified products rather than the startling
bursts.

with langpo, yes the grenier/watten edited first issue of this
magazine (1971) has come to be written as the originary moment -- if
in large part due to grenier's programmatic essay "on speech" and the
collage-reviews of creeley and stein. the poetry in that issue does
not to my mind present any kind of consistent aesthetic. there were
several important subsequent places where the poetry was collected:
the andrews-wiater issue of toothpick, lisbon and the orcas islands;
the one-off streets and roads edited by kit robinson, "the dwelling
place: 9 poets" feature in alcherringa, and the none of the above
anthology edited by michael lally. all followed by a period of
identification and collective energies (say, mid-1970s to mid-1980s),
a certain amount of attention from the mainstream and academic press
(mid-1980s to mid-1990s), and a present period of dispersal or
dissemination.

so no, i don't think we are too close: we are some 30-35 years from
those originary moments. the narratives continue to be written...

allbests,
tom orange

I'm not sure if this is appropriate for the list, but here goes anyway...an
MA student where I work has recently been busted for plagiarizing three out
of four essays on contemporary American poetry...literally word-for-word
cut-and-paste jobs from not-so-obscure journal articles and books. There is
a fourth essay, however, that I'm positive has also been plagiarized, but I
can't find the source. Below please find a paragraph from the student's
essay - if anyone recognizes where it came from, I'd be greatly indebted.

'Stein, as Eliot, acknowledges the implicit schisms differentiating past
from present, previous from now, and with it, the indicative transmutation
language necessarily must undergo to explain the world before that era's
population. To do anything other, Stein might probably have argued, would be
epistemologially dishonest. After all, she meant her work to mean, but to
mean only those ideas won through her struggle with writing itself. As a
poet, she was committed to exact representation of the object observed; she
sought to avoid the intervention of remembered conventions, of constituted
knowledge, and of Received Thinking, so that the object may exist as a
precise mimetic artifact outside the metaphor and symbolism typical
terminology would lead us to think of'.

Certainly McCarthyism, but not the way you mean it-- in the sense of which
poets get pushed via the establishment. My point was about access, not
quality-- which is to say, my argument was about the system, not the
individual, as it was taken here. There are more than a few excellent minor
poets-- poets less inclined to sonneteering than Kees, say-- who were not
likewise anointed. What is _______ using our voices to say?

I would agree re his brilliance, a point many here seem to either disagree
with, or are tip-toeing around. It was Justice, in his intro to the
collected edition who opined that Kees' work is best read in toto to
properly gauge its cumulative power, and I used to agree. But, given time, I
now feel most of his small body of work can be appreciated in single doses.
Something about his overall tone -- which maybe Justice also called
"apocalyptic" -- was not just ahead of its time, it was, and is palpably
bitter, yet mordantly funny. I'm not sure a lot of "humanity" gets through,
but I don't think Kees was that kind of poet.

He was also well-versed in many other areas: fiction, essays, painting,
photography, music ... That restlessness alone contributes to a very sui
generis individual.

He was light about it all, but he was long-term serious about his work as a
poet. He has been using the PDF very well for years. The books he prints on
his own of his work in PDF are amazing. Well produced and of course written
with the humour, passion and shapeliness that is his own.

His Web site http://thegatesofparadise.com has been important to his work.
His work is situated between print and the net in an unusual way. He was one
of the first deeply print-oriented poets to work out a real modus involving
the net, to work with both in a significantly artistic way. It wasn't simply
a means of distribution and community for him, though it was that as well.
His PDFs are readable on a computer screen. You can't say that with any
justice about most PDF's. His work profits from the zoom, for instance, the
ability to put your nose into the PDF and read it not only line by line but
as a media entity.

His dignity and humanity. And his devotion to creating storyful, poetically
complex work that can be apprehended from multiple perspectives. Its
connectedness.

I am very sorry to see him go.

But I trust his work will be around for a long time.

Does anyone know what is going to happen with his Web site?

A Coney Island of the Mind

- an evergreen book by an evergreen poet is into its 50th year of
publication.

Lawrence Ferlinghetti is 89 while his second book turns 50. For most
experimental poets like me, nearly half-a-century younger than Ferlinghetti,
this is "easy poetry" perhaps, old-fashioned buccaneer lyric perhaps, but a
great book no doubt, an truly evergreen book of poems, the most sold poetry
book in English language in the 20th century by a living poet, still
enthralls with its rusty musings like a landscape with ancient windmills.

Dear Alison and Murat--

Thank you for your comments and questions regarding emotionalism and
conceptual framings of acts of violence and death.

In the film Battle of Chile, there is a sequence shot by a cameraman--who is
hit and killed while filming.  the camera suddenly flies about, with random
images recorded until it comes to a stop in the street. There are also on
line a good deal of footage that is being shot just as the camerman is
killed, filming the very weapon being fired or launched as he is about to
die from the incoming projectile.  Despite the markings on Journalists' cars
and clothing, there are more of them being killed all the time.

To record events in which death is involved may turn into the filming of
one's swiftly approaching end, as the camera registers and continues to,
while the human eyes--have  ceased to.

Earlier this year I was walking down the street from where I live to go two
blocks to get a package of smokes.  I heard the tell tale "pop!! pop!!" of a
gun and turned to see a man falling to the ground about thirty or so feet
away.  Two men with their backs to me were running off.

About five minutes later I was walking back from the store and the body was
just lying there.  The police hadn't been called yet and no one had stopped
to take a look at the corpse, though a few persons were also walking to and
fro to the store or their cars.

Since the likelihood is that it is a drug killing, no one wants to get too
close, to avoid any contact with officers or neighbors until the crime scene
is examined and the body taken away.

Sometimes it is as though people need to wait to have such events brought to
them via at least one of any number of media before registering it as being
something terrible that has happened.  In that interval between registering
the live event--of death--and the later hearing the emotionalized and
sensationalized reporting of it, there is a calm, like the eye of a storm.
It is as though to get emotional about it at the time is to open the doors
through which one may invite death in oneself.  If the doors are shut for a
while, death passes on.  Then one may indulge in some borrowed pre-packaged
emotions--if one so chooses. Or, to "act them out" like a method actor,
dredging up one's memories that bear a relation to the events. Or, if the
dead person is close to one--

Perhaps in the awareness which keeps one alive, there is no room to allow
for the intrusion of emotions.  At least not until one is away from the
scene. And even then, one begins to wonder about oneself--if to many things
have made such events more "factual" than "real" in a sense.  The distancing
that has been created through time--to reframe close-ups as something else,
something to be "frozen" or "captured" and left behind, an old abandoned
photo yellowing and rotting away. To dwell too long on the image of
death--or, not being able to rid oneself of it, what to do with it?

"I cant' seem to shake off this feeling--"

"Nature is a haunted house, and art one that tries to be," Emily Dickinson
wrote.
Perhaps in that trying to be haunted, art sets to work to create those
things which will elicit the effects and after effects of a "haunting," of
"being haunted."

"All the worlds a stage," in Shakespeare's understanding of this--a "play
house" haunted by the effects of art--????

Yet the effects that the "trying to be haunted" works towards in its
creative endeavors---
do they then become "real" when experienced no longer by "actors" but by
"real persons in the audience?"

Does the "false" then create the "real"--as forged letters helped to create
the Iraq War, and as a "real or not" dog, artist and art event--cause "real
emotions" and words to flow--

And in turn those "real emotions and words"--begin to create both "real
after effects" in the world--and in turn as these now "real effects" are
reframed and reused as the materials taken back into the making of a further
art, a further "falseness" with yet new effects to be imparted in order to
cause the sense of things and people and events as  being "haunted" . . .
provoking a "haunting sensation" which turns into a further "reality"--

In Goebbels' Diaries, during the final weeks and days of Hitler's life in
the ever more desperately hallucinatory world of his bunker, Goebbels
records that the Fuhrer spoke of an attack on New York City's skyscrapers as
the ultimate psychological blow to the American psyche.

The first jets with longer range capabilities  were being constructed in
prototypes at the time, and Hitler speculated that a long range jet could
traverse the Atlantic, fly over NYC dropping bombs on the sky scrapers and
the canyon like streets among them, and, its high speeds making it
impossible to shoot down by American planes of the time, head South East to
the Caribbean islands.  There, the jet with its fuel almost spent could be
landed in the waters and the crew picked up by waiting submarines.

Hitler reasoned, according to Goebbels, that the Americans, so efficient in
fire bombing and massive carpet bombings, themselves would have no stomach
or psychological strength of will if bombed themselves.  A single mission
such as the envisioned one could bring the entire country to its knees. To
attack the skyscrapers of New York, literalalized symbols of America's
"towering" over the rest of the world, would be far more crushing than even
the attack on Pearl Harbor.

Murat--do you know the film by Georges Franju Le Sang des Betes--it's a
harrowing and dreamlike documentary of what happens inside an abattoir.
(Franju also made the extraordinary film Les Yeux sans visage--Eyes without
a Face. )

There was at the fringes of Arles, where my family lived then, a huge
abattoir, blank walled and from which ran in gutters along a walk way the
blood that had escaped cleaning up inside. As one approached, there were
sounds of some sorts of machines coming muffled through the aging and ill
repaired walls.   Nearly all the paint of a once bright sign had peeled away
steadily through time in the powerful summer suns and the seasonal Mistral
winds. All that was left were fragments creating the effect of a mosaic
missing a great many tiles. Strips and blotched areas of fading once garish
reds and blues clung to the eroding, pock marked surfaces. The building
itself looked as doomed as the animals within, ready to collapse at any
moment among the blood filled gutters.

These gutters ran with a very thick blood, filled with bits and pieces of
bones and gristle, tiny  chips of raw meat. The overpowering smell of it
filled the air, thickening it to the point of a near strangling coagulation.
In some areas furthest from the abattoir, the mixing of bloods of different
animals created an ever thickening paint bearing a great variety of hues of
red. Towards the very end, the flows had turned into what looked like clays,
having absorbed dust and dirt in their journey down the gutters.  The dark
clay-like areas were dotted with brighter, still relatively viscous ones,
which had ridden on the surfaces of the thicker blood below.  These looked
like paint squeezed from a tube.

Above the flows swarmed very large swollen black flies, and, higher up, the
wheeling of birds who from time to time alighted on the battered concrete
and gravel walk way to peck at the blood.

It turned out that only employees were allowed to enter the abattoir
itself--they and the animals who were led in from the other side, out of
view, through a gang way maze of fences that kept them from prying eyes.

A few years later, I was locked in a cell like a standup coffin in Paris.
At the base of the thick  door was a small gutter to carry away urine and
feces.  There was a small barred window at roughly eye level.

An officer of the paramilitary CRS looked in at me and said--watch the
gutter closely.

Some men I couldn't see and who made barely any sounds themselves, proceeded
to methodically torture and murder the man in the next cell.  A small stream
of blood flowed in the gutter, mixing with the stains of urine and feces.

An abattoir for humans, I remember thinking.  Only here the gutter doesn't
carry the blood outdoors, to be among the flies and birds, the sun, the
wind. One wondered vaguely what happened to it. Was someone else perhaps
forced to drink it?  Or maybe these butchers did . . . And what of the dead
body?  Was it perhaps served up in here as choice steaks?  Ground up to make
sausages for the prisoners or guards?  Or dumped in a hole someplace for the
worms to consume?

     Worms in turn eaten by birds who may be eaten at some point along the
food chain by humans . . .

        The Leaves of Grass that are the tongues of the dead--Leaves of a
book--

I remember with a friend going by bus to a very small arena in I can't
recall what town to see a Corrida.  At the time in Arles, which has the
third largest coliseum built by the Romans, there were held many Corridas
and other, non-violent bull sports dating back to the Greek colonization of
the area.

 The bulls and bullfighters are not allowed to be French; only Spaniards and
Spanish bulls were permitted by law.  It was rumored that sometimes Gypsies
posing as Spaniards would be involved in Corridas such as this one, at which
the officials in charge of keeping the laws had a shady air about them. This
shadiness prompted many of the older Provencal people to  claim they were
Corsicans from Marseilles, not at all locals.

El Cordobes was an immense star at this time.  He looked like a movie star,
had a Romantic life story, and with his long hair had become the first "hip"
toreador, kind of the Elvis of bullfighting.  El Cordobes  had made Corridas
very popular among young people who not long before thought they were just
for the old people, a ritual of nostalgia rather than the present. The crowd
that day was about half teenagers and younger kids, passing cigarettes
around and talking non-stop, hoping to see something truly dramatic, larger
than life, even in this sad dump. After all, El Cordobes had started from
the bottom--

This Corrida, held in a tiny dusty and blood reeking arena that seemed to be
more suitable for a small traveling circus, included at one point a very
young toreador.  One look at this man and the crowd started murmuring--oh
no!  This poor guy was not at all equipped to face a bull, even the smaller
bulls being used that day.  He bore the  aura of deadly misfortune about
him, a ragged shroud obscuring his pitiful cheap toreador's suit.

Very soon into the ritual, the man , very young and tubercular looking, with
a face eerily reminiscent of Lautreamont's, was badly gored and hauled out
on a stretcher.  The bull, meanwhile was hauled off and executed outside the
arena.  Its body along with the badly gored horses of the picadors who had
also been executed--scrawny horses, the bottom of the barrel so to
speak---were loaded into a small van bearing the name of a local butcher.

(Bulls balls were a local speciality, and everyone ate horsemeat a few times
a week.)

My friend and I with a raucous bunch of raggedy kids were leaning over the
low wall at the top of the arena and yelling, as the pale and bloody
toreador's body on the flimsy stretcher was shoved into another small
van----"If he dies, is he for sale also?  How much for 500 gms, eh?  less
than the bull and more than the horses?"

The traditional sausage of Arles is made with donkey meat, so it was a big
deal among the citizens when the French  TV made a special from I think a
Giono story about a donkey and it was filmed nearby. It was around this
time, just a bit later, that the Bresson film Au Hasard Balthazar came to
town.  My sister and I went to see it--we had seen the Bresson Pickpocket
film and also Mouchette  at La Maison des Jeunes, the young people's club
and were big fans.

 This is the  last Bresson film in which the Jansenist Moment of Grace comes
to a character--and this time, it comes to the donkey, as the people have
turned so far from any sense or reach  of Grace. The old Provencal gentleman
sitting next to us said at the end, Ah!  What a film!  This director
understands why we eat the donkey--it is blessed by God. When we eat, Grace
comes into us.

A few years later, in Vermont, my mother had decided to make her own boudin
(Quebecois blood sausage) rather than buying it from the butcher who made
his own at the General Store.

A friend of mine arrived one sunny morning with in his back trunk several
huge plastic containers of pork blood.  He opened one to show my mother that
the blood was fresh--and she begin vomiting, very violently, for some time.

So much for making her own boudin!!  The boudin making  butcher hadn't lost
a customer after all.  She had no idea what to do with al the blood, so my
brother and I took the containers and made the rounds of lawns in the
village of people whom we deemed worthy, and poured great gushing flows out
on their good sized properties.

Not long after, the howls of packs of dogs running from one place to the
next to lick up the blood in a mass frenzy ripped open the quiet day.  And
soon after the telephone started ringing, it being a small village and news,
or suspicions, traveling fast.

What is one "to make of such things?"

One follows the bloody lines of the train of associations through time and
space, mixing with dirt and dust, with gravel and urine, consumed by dogs
and humans alike in the form of "blood sausages" and "blood soaked lawns."
The blood  may "run hot and cold," or "freeze" or "boil" depending on the
emotionalism involved, on the language with which  one may choose to present
these events with,  these events which also transform themselves into clay
and paint, and become suggestive of other ways of putting blood to use.

And blood itself via transfusions that are contaminated, may be the living
bearer of death.

Or for the vampyre, the living flow of the unliving's endless addict-like
cravings--

Life and death haunting one another in the vein's blue flows or the red
spatterings of spilled and flying blood--

Which can be "read' by experts to determine one more piece of evidence in
reconstructing a crime, an accident, an "after effect"haunting a moment of
violence--or not--simply a trying to be haunting as what is the last traces
of an existence which is "read" in "red" and so turned into the writing of
the reports of the "case."

And is that "the end of it, case closed," or simply the creation of an
effect that endures as a "cold case file" until reopened at a later date--to
create a whole new chain of after effects--become again a "hot tip" or
"ongoing investigation"---

An "ongoing investigation," then, into these "haunting questions"--

The 50th anniv. edition --the first time Coney Island has ever been in
hardback I believe--includes a CD of LF reading from the book, including the
"Poetry in the Cellar" readings made in late 50s that has LF backed up by
jazz group. Had the LP as a college student, whose flipside included Kenneth
Rexroth reading "Thou Shall Not Kill" w/ jazz combo -- this poem was long
considered a precurser to Howl, until AG started managing his own critical
apparatus and expunged mention of Rexroth's influence (see the Annotated
Howl).

Go to any open reading or small town reading scene & you hear LF's
influence. He's sort of the part of the pantheon of  "unfashionable" poets
who still have a reading audience -- Edgar Arlington Robinson, cummings,
Patchen and Millay come to mind. Of the latter, I recall an interview w/
Millay's sister, who at the time ran Spindletop --her sister's home in
Columbia Cty, NY -- as a writer's colony that provided space and meals for
no fee. "Does it bother you that no one reads your sister's poems?" the
reporter asked. "Well somebody must be," replied the sister, "because this
operation is paid entirely through her royalty checks."

The book also does bring back memories of Jacques Pr=E9vert...

An excerpt from my 2005 interview of Lawrence Ferlinghetti
(http://www.kaurab.com/english/interviews/ferlinghetti.html)=20

AM: Going back to your formative years, between your Sorbonne days and =
the
time you wrote =93A Coney Island of the Mind=94 (the most widely sold =
book on
contemporary poetry in the United States in the last century), what or =
who
did you derive your early inspiration from?=20


LF: Well, that is difficult to answer...see, I read a lot during those =
early
years. I read Baudelaire when I was 14. A lot of the great European =
poets.=20


AM: While you were in France during your early years, before you wrote A
Coney Island of the Mind, you translated Jacques Pr=E9vert. I have read =
your
preface to that book (Paroles, by Jacques Pr=E9vert , translated into =
english
by Lawrence Ferlinghetti)where you=85..=20


LF: Oh, yes. Pr=E9vert did have an influence on me. A major influence. I =
would
even say that Jacques Pr=E9vert did influence A Coney Island of the Mind =
too.=20

"A Coney Island of the Mind" meant much to my friends and I--poets and
painters alike--when we were beginning, in Brooklyn. It was an original
voice among an amazing movement of original voices. That his work never
reached further doesn't matter. This book alone announced an exceptional
life and bodhisattvic career.

David,

That's quite an odd conclusion to reach -- Being outraged (or concerned)=20=

about one injustice inherently excludes being outraged by another?=20

How does one grossly (mis) characterize a discussion about how far the me=
rits=20

animals as "lavishing a dog like a king", while at the same time concludi=

people who are concerned with a specific issue of ethics are *not* concer=

In fact, you imply that by discussing this issue, we would assume other p=
eople=20
are "inferior" and worthless. That's some assumption and a terrible examp=
le of=20
either/or thinking. Either we care about how animals are treated or we ca=

People who get outraged at the treatment of a dog, a horse, and pride
themselves on their humanity and "civilization,"
will not bat an eyelash at the torture and injustice, the killing and hat=

of persons they consider inferior--

because to them a dog is better than the people they consider beneath the=

David,

Hemingway sentimentalizes bull fighting, as a fight between... whatever! I
only went to a bull fight once in Seville, about twenty years ago. I was
under the misconception -due to Hemingway, no doubt- that the bull was saved
if he beat the toreador. Of course, nothing of the sort occurred. The bull
is a goner anyway. The bull's legs get all stiff after getting killed, and
it gets dragged off the arena by a team of horses, whether "victorious" or
not. To me, the spectacle was absolutely nauseating. Before the fights
start, one can go and "watch the bulls" in their stalls. In retrospect, it
sounds such a weird idea. During the same trip, we also went to visit the
toreador museum. The memorobilia there, posters, hats, shoes, gored
clothings, shoes and, I think, the death mask of some famous matador remind
me of little statues of saints.

Most of us are fish, fowl or meat eaters. Obviously, these animals are being
killed somewhere. Is it then, on our part, a matter of discretion?. You are
describing a period when that discretion is relatively not there, blood
thickened in multiple layers (very much like a painter's palette) flowing in
ditches. Is our violence less (even less inevitable) than a century ago?
Then we try to make rational distinctions, "killings for a reason," to name
a few: war, sport hunting or fishing, food, art....

It is so difficult for us to accept our animal nature, that we are part of a
natural cycle where life is sustained by organic (the basic definition of
life) beings feeding on each other. Vampires act out this process in one's
own, or semi ones own, species. No one survives eating stones.  In my view,
the basic function of art is to tear away the veil of discretion. That's why
I find the documentary of the slaughterer on the English countryside or
Brackage's film of autopsies taking place so resonant, unforgettable,
enormously disturbing, not only "transgressive" in the "innovative poetry"
sort of way. Only then, it seems to me, when this veil is torn, can we be
forced to make distinctions, trying, partially, to rise above the cycle of
mayhem.

David, I did not see Le Sang des Betes. The story you tell about eating the
Grace of God in the donkey is delicious, eating Arles sausages like
participating in a mass. Where was Bresson from, which part of France, do
you know?

Ciao,

Murat

Subject:      An emblem
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII; format=flowed

An emblem


analog--abject (hidden <> flight) flesh silence | {stench, odor}
                  emptiness mind
discrete--pure (visible <> embrace) mind speech | {scent, smell)

Let analog resonate 0, that is substance with no premise, project. Let
discrete resonate 1, that is inscription with project, maintenance. Think
analog resonating nothing, discrete resonating. Then _1_ draws _0_ out.
The Emblem is always discrete, the analog(ic) always approached asymptot-
ically, from the other side. Analog as release of emblem, discrete as
emblematic release.

The abject of the analog is hidden (passively or actively); it harbors
flight, flight-from skittered across substance surface, flight-towards
oozed beneath it. The abject is desired, uninscribed death, defuge. And
that is what there is.

Analogic: of the flesh, stench, silence, noise, parasite, emptiness of
mind.

The visible of the analog is embraced (passively or actively), embrace-
from as inscription, isolation, purification, distanced, the blemish of
the body in-visible, sutured over, cosmeticized, cover-up. And embrace-
towards, arousal within the visible, inscribed and introjected objects-
objectifications. And that is what there is.

Discrete: of speech, discursivity, talk, fecundity of mind.

Among visible and abject, emptiness.
Among analog and discrete, emptiness.
Analog and discrete sutured at the limits--the inscription of analogic,
abjection of discrete. Culture exists, exhausts, exhumes, at the junction;
the junction is driven by impulse, exchange and use values (regimes),
arousal, rite, contract, the letter, annihilation. The letter is always
under erasure, granular, memory.

(_Desire_ of flight and embrace.)

On _the one hand_ dyads are always suspect, problematic, under erasure,
abject; _on the other_ dyads are originary _wherever, whenever there is
origin._ Think of _originary fields,_ not points; areas, not vectors;
temporalities, not time; infinitesimals, not 0. Think of emission and
absorption spectra; particle annihilation and creation: "The world is
_not_ locally realistic." (Nielsen and Chuang, Quantum Computation and
Quantum Information.)

nothing among nothing

Bravo, Steve's Russell and Dalichinsky re: Boom-boom Bloom's labeling.

What should all us "minor" souls, intellects, and B-leaguers call Harry
baby?

"A very good-to-fine major labeler?"

Hey, who's got fun and funny labels for Harry?  Anybody care to play?
Do him some (Donald) justice?

Just funnin...

Very important petition to protect artists' copyrights:








http://www.gopetition.com/petitions/no-to-orphan-works-act.html




 =20


More Info:=20





Under current copyright law, in effect
for the last 30 years, your=20


visual art is copy protected whether or not it is registered or
carries=20


the copyright symbol.=20




This week, the U.S. House of
Representatives is expected to introduce the Orphan Works Act of 2008. If
you care about protecting your work, you're against it. It will have the
effect of wiping out any copyright on visual art now in existence,
throwing your work into the public domain.
If you wish to protect your work
(each and every separate piece) you will have to digitize it and register
it with private sector=20


registries as yet uncreated, for a fee as yet unestablished. I say
registries because this bill places no limit on how many separate
registries there could be.=20




It gets worse. Anyone can submit images,
including your images. They=20


would then be excused from any liability for infringement (also known
as=20


THEFT) unless the legitimate rights owner (you) responds within a



certain period of time to grant or deny permission to use your work.





That means you will also have to look
through every image in every=20


registry all the time to make sure someone is not stealing and=20


registering your art. You could actually end up illegally using your
own=20


artwork or photo if someone else registers it.=20




Please read more in this excerpt from

illustratorspartnership.org
; I=20


know it's long, but it's worth reading. Also, note that while their



site is geared to illustrators, everything they say applies as well
to=20


photographers, musicians, filmakers, painters, writers, etc:=20




Since the last bill died in committee in
2006, the advocates of this=20


legislation have promoted the creation of private commercial
registries.=20


On January 29, 2007, a lead attorney for the Copyright Office warned
us=20


that under their plan any work not registered with a private sector



registry would be a potential orphan from the moment it was created.





This means you would not only have to
register your published work, but=20


also:=20




=97 Every sketch or note on every page of
every sketchbook;=20


=97 Every sketch you send to every client;=20


=97 Every photograph you take anywhere, anytime, including family
photos,=20


home videos, etc.;=20


=97 Every letter, email, etc., professional, personal or private.=20




This Would End Passive Copyright
Protection: Under existing law the=20


total creative output of any 'creator' receives passive copyright



protection from the moment you create it. This covers everything from



the published work of professional artists to the unpublished
diaries,=20


letters and family photos of the average citizen.=20




But under the Orphan Works proposal, none
of this material would be=20


covered unless the creator took active steps to register and maintain



coverage with a commercial registry. Failure to do so would 'signal'
to=20


infringers that you have no interest in protecting the work.=20




The Registration Paradox:=20


By conceding that their proposals would make potential orphans of any



unregistered works, the Copyright Office proposals would lead to a



registration paradox: In order to 'protect' work from exposure to



infringement, creators would have to expose it on a publicly
searchable=20


registry. This would:=20




=97 Expose creative work to plagiarists and
derivative abusers;=20


=97 Expose trade secrets and unused sketches to competitors;=20


=97 Expose unpublished and private correspondence to the public on the



Orwellian premise that you must expose it to 'protect' it.=20




Yet registries will not be able to
monitor infringements nor enforce=20


copyright compliance. Even after you've shelled out 'protection
money'=20


to a commercial registry to register hundreds of thousands of works,
you=20


still won't be protected. A registry would do nothing more than give
you=20


a piece of paper. You would still have to monitor infringements -
which=20


can occur anytime anywhere in the world; then embark on an uncertain



quest to find the infringer, file a case in Federal court, then prove



that the infringer has removed your name or other identifying=20


information from your work. Meanwhile all the infringer will have to
do=20


is say there was no such information on the work when he found it and



assert an orphan works defense.=20




Coerced registration violates the spirit
and letter of international=20


copyright law and copyright-related treaties. And because this bill



would effectively eliminate the passive copyright protection afforded



personal correspondence, family photos, etc. it would tear one more



slender thread of privacy protection from the fabric of fundamental



rights we currently take for granted.=20




We urge Congress to carefully reconsider
the unintended consequences of=20


this radical copyright proposal.=20

fast-tracked for a vote in the House by mid-May. Advocates hope for



swift passage before the summer recess.=20




The decision to introduce such a radical
bill so late in the session is=20


ominous. Because of fall elections, this will be a short

Thank you!

It may take a few days for us to send books out, as I can't go into

If you are about to, books will be sent next week.

Elizabeth Treadwell: WARDOLLY -- it can already be ordered on the web
site.

Also, please note -- a slight glitch has developed in our web site
which will be fixed shortly. This does not effect ordering the new
books, only navigation among the back list of books -- but you can
still find the back list books if you go to the "books" link at the
top of the page.

cheers!

to talk about concerning poetry.  Then at 1:08 we will get started with the
workshop, which will last to about 5pm or so.

Sign-up for ALL 4 SUNDAYS is ONLY $108
or take one or more for $27 a class
The 4 Sundays are July 6, 13, 20, 27

Sign-up DEADLINE is June 22nd, or until there are enough slots filled.
Write to CAConrad at CAConrad13@aol.com with
---dates you will be attending
---your phone number (this is in case it is raining on workshop day and we
need to meet indoors)
PLEASE FEEL FREE TO TELL OTHERS

(Soma)tic Poetry Workshops.  In this frantic, routine-driven world we need
freedom from regimented poetry writing, and a healthy dose of walking the
space between Soma (spirit) and Somatic (body).  Using gemstones, trees, and
the city itself, we will create deliberate, sustained physical manipulations
to generate language to write our poems.  Every thing is new every time we
embark, and opening our minds to having that freedom in our lives everyday
to write poems is what these workshops are about.  CAConrad's book *(Soma)tic
Midge *(FAUX Press) was written after eating and living with a single color
for a day.  Poem samples, as well as a link to his monthly (Soma)tic Poetry
Exercises can be found here:

Poetry is for everyBody, therefore everyBody is welcome!

If anyone is still interested after all that -- some thots on the audio
composition below.

Happy listening,
Danny

---

If written, an essay on my archival selection would necessarily attempt to
articulate the network of differences weaving this familiar set together.
With digital editing available, however, a certain mode of citational audio
essaying seemed a far more effective and technically appropriate means of
recirculating the cuts in this particular operation:

I have neither multi-tracked nor re-mixed -- the MP3 is linear, sequential,
legible -- samples preserve voices on the level of the poetic line. "Uh, I
have not tampered with anything, I have simply removed and reallocated the
parts." There is no glue between passages, nothing proper to collage.
Perhaps the antiquated term "radio play" forms a better apparatus for
transmitting the sort of bricolage at work here. A transcription of the
works was first processed in textpad, then applied as targeted mining to
each of the featured tracks. The details of these citations were
improvisationally arranged to stage a play of voices that excites, I hope,
some choice threads in the differential webbing that renders these diverse
recordings apart.

This may also serve as a dense, automatic model for the kind of activity
immediately available at all points on PennSound.

I used the book in an American Literature class in Muscat, Sultanate of Oma=
n where a student entertained the question of whether a couple of the poems=
 were "blasphemous" in her essay. I also remember one student vehemently in=
sisting how "wrong" the *pure psychic automatism* of Surrealism was.

And I admit I totally ripped him off (or ripped on him) in:
Spectacle of the Prophets of Phallopolis
in Unlikely Stories (November 2007) at
http://www.unlikelystories.org/karavatos1107.shtml

It was one of the many books that seemed to fall into my hands at the used =
book store Tin Can Mailman in Arcata, CA was I was young.

A Poet=E2=80=99s Theater Showcase
Curated by John Beer=20

May 2008 in Chicago, IL
at Links Hall
http://www.linkshall.org/08-pp-may.shtml


**Program Three**
Fiona Templeton
Louis Zukofsky's Rudens and Fiona Templeton=E2=80=99s Bluebeard (excerpt)=
=20
Collaborators:  Joel Craig, Laura Goldstein, and Pam Osbey=20
Friday & Saturday, May 16 & 17, 8pm
Sunday, May 18, 7pm
$12 ($10 students)

Templeton directs two plays: Rudens is a very seldom performed work, based =
on The Rope by the Roman comic playwright T. Maccius Plautus. It combines a=
 number of strategies of textual conversion, and is translated to English p=
honetically by using the sound of the original language. Bluebeard is about=
 two people imagining how each other think, what each other fears or desire=
s, and what each fears or desires of the other. It is a ventriloquial work,=
 in which the onstage action or even speaker may believe the subject of the=
 speech.


**Program Four**
Carla Harryman
Five New Works
Collaborators:  Elana Elyce, Judith Goldman, Julia Klein, Katie McGowan, Je=
nnifer Scappettone, and David Trinidad =20
Friday & Saturday, May 23 & 24, 8pm=20
Sunday, May 25, 7pm=20
$12 ($10 students)=20

This program infuses improvisational electronic sound, choral and sound-bas=
ed performance writing, and Poet=E2=80=99s Theater in five new works: Bad H=
istory by Barrett Watten, Try! Try! by Frank O'Hara, Mirror Play by Carla H=
arryman, Sue by Carla Harryman, and Requiem by Kathy Acker. In the 1980s, C=
arla Harryman co-founded the San Francisco Bay Area Poet=E2=80=99s Theater,=
 which presented performances of experimental plays by poets.=0A=0A=0A     =

It's an important point that there is very little critical scholarship on
Mayer's work, at least as of a couple of years ago, when I did a library
search on this topic.  I was stunned.  Juliana Spahr does have a piece on
Mayer's sonnets in a literary journal; the Gordon piece, also helpful, is on
the web.   My belief is that Mayer's seemingly too earnest use of the "I"
made her unpopular with the experimentals -- the schools to which she justly
belongs.  But Midwinter Day is a very important book.  I happen to be
writing a chapter in my new book on Mayer's "I", in which I reinterpret its
significance.  That is in progress.

If anyone knows of other critical work on Mayer, I'd appreciate knowing
about this, too.  Thanks, Maria and Nick, for writing.

Here's a chance for me to plug a recent scholarly book I loved,

It's by Maggie Nelson and it's called

Women, the New York School and Other True Abstractions.

http://www.uipress.uiowa.edu/books/2007-fall/nelsonwomnew.html


Nelson, a poet herself, is especially lively and provocative when she
writes on Bernadette Mayer's work...  which she does at some length,
here's the TOC:

Part One
1. Abstract Practices: The Art of Joan Mitchell, Barbara Guest, and
Their Others
2. Getting Particular: Gender at Play in the Work of John Ashbery,
Frank O'Hara, and James Schuyler

Part Two
3. What Life Isn't Daily?The Gratuitous Art of Bernadette Mayer
4. Dear Dark Continent: Alice Notley's Disobediences
5. When We're Alone in Public: The Metabolic Work of Eileen Myles

I recommend it to everyone even if you're rolling your eyes thinking,
oh God, not another New York School book, for this one has that
different angle that makes everything (nearly everything) new all
over again.  And it has a blurb by Kim Gordon!

POETIC MEETUP FEATURING:
ROBYN WEINBAUM
Robyn is a Brooklyn girl through and through. in fact, this wanna-be redhead reeks of the outer borough, when she isn't reeking of her usual BS. She has spent most of life racking up, oops, playing with numbers as a statistician and tax accountant, day jobs she admits to onlyunder duress. After her move to florida, she had a near-death experience which left her severly afflicted with hypergraphia. in addition to poetry and flash fiction, most of which can be found on her blog http://wingedunicorn0205.blogspot.com/, Robyn writes a regular column on the arts for a tampa newspaper in the vain hope of bringing an epiphany to that wasteland in the west. Her new novel, Mastermind, a nasty, depraved mystery thriller co-written with Gene Hodes, will be released may 18.

There is an entire chapter (Desire Not A Saint: The Pathography of
Bernadette Mayer) devoted to Mayer in "Leaving Lines of Gender: A
Feminist Genealogy of Language Writing" by Ann Vickery.  Also see
chapter six (Bernadette Mayer and "Language" in the Poetry Project) in
"All Poets Welcome: The Lower East Side Poetry Scene in the 1960's" by
Daniel Kane.  Hope this helps.

Eating Chocolate Ice Cream: Reading Mayakovsky


Since I've decided to revolutionize my life
                          since
                                      "

                          revolutionize
                                                  "
                          life
                                                  "

How early it is! It is eight o'clock in the morning.
Well, the pigeons were up earlier
Did you eat all your eggs?
Now we shall go for a long walk.
Now? There is too much winter.
I am going to admire the snow on your coat.
Time for hot soup, already?
You have worked for three solid hours.
I have written forty-eight, no forty-nine,
no fifty-one poems.
How many states are there?
I cannot remember what is uniting America.
It is then time for your nap.
What a lovely, pleasant dream I just had.
But I like waking up better.
I do admire reality like snow on my coat.
Would you take cream or lemon in your tea?
No sugar?
And no cigarettes.
Daytime is good, but evening is better.
I do like our evening discussions.
Yesterday we talked about Kant.
Today let's think about Hegel.
In another week we shall have reached Marx.
Goody.
Life is a joy if one has industrious hands.
Supper? Stew and well-cooked. Delicious.
Well, perhaps just one more glass of milk.
Nine o'clock! Bath time!
Soap and a clean rough towel.
Bedtime!
The Red Army is marching tonight.
They shall march through my dreams
in their new shiny leather boots,
their freshly laundered shirts.
All those ugly stains of caviar and champagne
and kisses
have been rubbed away.
They are going to the barracks.
They are answering hundreds of pink
and yellow and blue and white telephones.
How happy and contented and well-fed they look
lounging on their fur divans,
chanting "Russia how kind you are to us.
How kind you are to everybody.
We want to live forever."
Before I wake up they will throw away
their pistols, and magically
factories will spring up where once
there was rifle fire, a roulette factory,
where once a body fell from an open window.
Hurry dear dream
I am waiting for you
under the eiderdown.
And tomorrow will be more real, perhaps,
than yesterday.

I've written a bit about dbCinema at
http://vispo.com/dbcinema/kandinsky3/intro .

More series at http://vispo.com/dbcinema/meditations.htm

Like the previous dbCinema series ( http://vispo.com/dbcinema/color2 ),
kandinsky5 uses the brush at
http://vispo.com/dbcinema/kandinsky5/dbcSWF/line26c.html

Unlike the previous series, the brush paints image, not color. The brush in
Kandinsky5 samples Kandinsky paintings.

If you're unfamiliar with Kandinsky's amazing paintings you can see a bunch
by visiting the old version of dbCinema at http://vispo.com/dbcinema and
typing in "Kandinsky" as the concept.

thanks Laura, as always. and to all who responded. it is a curious
lacuna but as you suggest a noteworthy phenomenon in itself, like the
relative lack of substantive scholarship/criticism, until recently, of
ginsberg's work.

Subject:      New Books: McCormick & Waldrep
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

Friends & Readers,

TSky Press is rather stoked to announce its first books of 2008: Paul
McCormick's _The Exotic Moods of Les Baxter_ and G.C. Waldrep's _One Way No
Exit_.

ONE WAY NO EXIT
G.C. Waldrep

Poetry
8.5" x 5.5", 56 pages, side-bolted
150 numbered copies
May, 2008
$10

"There are only two human figures in all of America," G.C. Waldrep declares
in _One Way No Exit_, "and I have already seen them. Everything else is
socks and recognizance, flutter and mood." Waldrep builds on photographer
Peter Rathmann's portraits of the American landscape to create a lyric
inquiry into the nature of patriotism, spirituality, photography,
20th-century American visual art, and what he terms "the surprisingly
unmapped avoidances of America's small towns." Moving quickly between
snapshot takes of the South and West and the works of Mark Rothko, David
Hockney, Joan Mitchell, Cy Twombly, and many others, Waldrep attempts to
make of his poem a bubble-like iridescence, "a skin on which objects rest."
"This is in the nature of the medium," Waldrep concludes, "God visited upon
objects. A photograph, like David Hockney, is a poem that looks good when it
doesn't have to."

About the Author

G.C. Waldrep's collections of poems are Goldbeater's Skin (Colorado Prize,
2003), Disclamor (BOA Editions, 2007), and a chapbook, The Batteries (New
Michigan Press, 2005). He lives in Lewisburg, Pa., and teaches at Bucknell
University.

THE EXOTIC MOODS OF LES BAXTER
Paul McCormick

Poetry
7.5" x 7.5", 40 pages, saddle-sewn
150 numbered copies
May, 2008
$10

"Most places exist only when you think about them," asserts the opening line
of Paul McCormick's new chapbook. It contains three sequences, each of them
thinking a certain place-a certain mood, a certain vantage of the subjective
self-into being. In "Fish Tales," McCormick richly re-imagines the Long
Island of his childhood, divesting nostalgia of sentiment in favor of
something stranger, brief moments when bright fish surface. In "Alternate
Takes," McCormick makes small prose towns out of familiar and unfamiliar
objects: "The Turk," "The President," "The Automobile," "The Shoe." And in
the title sequence, McCormick honors the 20th-century American composer Les
Baxter, fashioning a richly lyrical discourse about the colonized and -izing
self from the eclectic exotica of Baxter's aural imagination. As McCormick
writes in "Mombassa at Midnight," "The crook of one's arm is the crook of
all arms. / You are bitten in your dream but smile for the dance. / The
circle continues til dawn." These are challenging, luminous poems, thought
sublimated into a language and landscape of the deeply-imagined self.  These
poems glow in the dark.

About the Author

Paul McCormick's poems have appeared in American Letters and Commentary, The
Iowa Review, Denver Quarterly, Fence, Verse, Conjunctions, Barrow Street,
Conduit, The Bitter Oleander, Diagram, Tarpaulin Sky, Typo, Octopus and
elsewhere. He lives in Huntington, New York and works as a taxonomy and
assessment specialist for the New York City Department of Education.

Hi, Maria,

Here's a few things:

--in Daniel Kane's essay collection Don't Ever Get Famous: Essays on New Yo=
rk Writing after the New York School, the essays by Linda Russo ("Poetics o=
f Adjacency: 0-9 and the Conceptual Writing of Bernadette Mayer and Hannah =
Weiner") and Lytle Shaw ("Faulting Description: Clark Coolidge, Bernadette =
Mayer, and the Site of Scientific Authority").

--Ann Vickery has a section on Mayer in her Leaving Lines of Gender: A Femi=
nist Genealogy of Language Writing

--Libbie Rifkin, "'My Little World Goes On St. Mark's Place': Anne Waldman,=
 Bernadette Mayer and the Gender of an Avant-Garde Institution," Jacket 7 (=
April 1999).  Juliana Spahr has a short piece on Mayer's Sonnets  in the sa=
me issue.

I'd second Kevin's recommendation of Maggie Nelson's book too.

it's been raining out
and it's been raining out
in this dark night of prayer wheels
churning for mother and cat and long lost friends
dying pulling the curtain down with them among them
the prayer wheel turning all through the rain
small candle driving it every night a different candle
small candle grieving one night and an other

it's raining out and the wind comes swirling in
the poor tiny flame shakes and shudders
great shadows on the ceiling in this unheard of room
and i face down on the bed and open one eye then an other
there are shapes moving on ruined thinned-out retinas
floaters and animals blindspotting dark unfocused worlds
generated from within memories of sight memories of death and dark candles

in this dark night of prayer wheels and worlds
my writing burns like a flame on the verge
it's twisted around the thing and churning
it says nothing it doesn't know how to speak
i don't know how to speak
and anymore in the rain
in the dark rain
and anymore in the dark dark dark dark rain

Surrealist imagery draws it meaning not from interpretation or explanation
but from the immediacy of its illuminative power.
Analysis becomes pertinent only after it has been preceded
by spontaneous delight.
Knowledge and understanding are ancillary.
Says Breton:
 "At the outset, it is only liking, not understanding, that matters.
Gaps in understanding...are not only important,
they are perhaps even welcome, like clearings in the woods,
the better to allow the heart's rays to stream out without obstacle.
The unlit shadows should remain obscure,
which is the very condition of enchantment."

(Jean-Pierre Cauvin, The Poethics of Andre Breton)

Dear friends,
I need to get incontact with a person who could help me in translating some
poetry texts into English for a pubblication. Texts has already been
translated, but to be controlled. Since the text is poetry and rather
experimental, it is very difficult to find a translator in Italy.
Please, contact me: davinio@tin.it

Warm regards

Hello all,

just a quick reminder that the submissions period for Midway
(www.midwayjournal) is about to close on June 1. Generally, we're looking
for the usual--fiction, poetry, non-fiction(see preferences for this),
drama, and multi-genre work that traverses any sort of line, and we are now
accepting submissions for a *Special Theme Issue* on fairs or carnivals or
circuses. Please interpret this loosely, curiously, and subversively!
Theme, form, title, pictures, references to the tv show, homages to Michael
J Anderson, poetry-on-a-stick, etc.--all considered.

From Suicide to Sublimation: Boston Poets 1950-2000

As homes to the publishing industry and world class Universities, Boston and
Cambridge have a long-standing history as being at the center of American
letters. From Emerson to the language poets, perhaps no other American city
can lay the same claims of both upholding the traditions of canonical works
while simultaneously pushing the envelope in terms of the creation of a new
poetics. The purpose of this panel is to address critical issues surrounding
the poets and roles of poetics in Boston from Confessionalism through
Neo-Formalism, Language Poetry and the Dark Room Collective.

Discussions surrounding the academy, identity, gender, race, psychology,
critical re-evaluations, the canon, craft, aesthetics and ideology in terms
of Boston poets including, but not limited to Robert Lowell, Richard Wilbur,
Adrienne Rich, Sylvia Plath, Jonathan Weiners, Robert Pinsky, Jorie Graham,
Thomas Sayers Ellis, Sharan Strange, Natasha Trethewey, and Katia Kapovich
will be considered. Participants are encouraged to address a variety of
poets or poets within the context of one of the schools or movements.

What is the impact of place and academia on the divergent poetics of these
Boston poets? In what way does the development of poetry and poetics in
Boston during this time period echo, prefigure or coincide with larger
aesthetic and critical movements? In what ways is the canon upheld or defied
by these poets? What are the peripheral cultural issues that these poets are
a part of or writing in response to? What types of texts are these poets
reconfiguring in the movement away from Confessionalism?

In 2003 we discussed the idea of starting a special imprint for poetry, and
the prospect of doing some workshops and events in our community. We decide=
d
on Paper Kite Press as the name because the image of a paper kite is used i=
n
a poem as a metaphor for the heart taking flight. It sounds a little maudli=
n
as we explain it here=8Bit was one of those great ideas we had over pie and
coffee! We still love the sound of the name=8Band that it alludes to flight,
and that amazing liftoff feeling you get when you are flying a kite=8Blike
anything is possible.
=20
We started out with the manuscript =B3Part of a Geography=B2 by Jack McGuigan. =
A
couple of years ago we started renting some studio space for community
readings and events. The first studio was in an old mansion in Wilkes-Barre=
,
and now we=B9ve moved into a new storefront space in Kingston, both in
Pennsylvania.
=20
Every third Friday we hold an open mic with a featured poet, and we host
other workshops and events on a regular basis. While the community event
aspect is always part of our goal, it isn=B9t our primary focus. We publish
poetry=8Banthologies and individual manuscripts=8Bso poets can get out in the
world and share their work. We believe it=B9s important for the world to have
more poetry in it=8Band for people to recognize that there IS poetry in the
world.=20

  it's been raining out
  and it's been raining out
  in this dark night of prayer wheels
  churning for mother and cat and long lost friends
  dying pulling the curtain down with them among them
  the prayer wheel turning all through the rain
  small candle driving it every night a different candle
  small candle grieving one night and an other

  it's raining out and the wind comes swirling in
  the poor tiny flame shakes and shudders
  great shadows on the ceiling in this unheard of room
  and i face down on the bed and open one eye then an other
  there are shapes moving on ruined thinned-out retinas
  floaters and animals blindspotting dark unfocused worlds
  generated from within memories of sight memories of death and dark =
candles

  in this dark night of prayer wheels and worlds
  my writing burns like a flame on the verge
  it's twisted around the thing and churning
  it says nothing it doesn't know how to speak
  i don't know how to speak
  and anymore in the rain
  in the dark rain
  and anymore in the dark dark dark dark rain

I just ran across this question in a google search, but thought I might
point out Anne Vickery's article on Mayer in Leaving Lines of Gender: A
Feminist Genealogy of Language Writing. Also the introduction to
Individuals: Post-Movement Art in America has some interesting things to =

Finland) are delighted to announce the release of *THE HAY(NA)KU ANTHOLOGY,
VOL. II,* edited by Mark Young and Jean Vengua.

 More information about the hay(na)ku poetic form is available at
http://haynakupoetry.blogspot.com and
http://www.meritagepress.com/haynaku.htm  The former link identifies the
poet-participants, while the latter shares some poets' thoughts on the
hay(na)ku's attractiveness.  The hay(na)ku has been one of the most popular
new poetic forms in recent times; 39 poets participated in the
soon-to-be-out-of-print first anthology.  In *Vol. II*, 51 poets from aroun=
d
the world (and representing a multiplicity of poetics) participate.

Since *The First Hay(na)ku Anthology*'s release in 2005, the hay(na)ku has
appeared in many literary journals, anthologies and single-author poetry
collections worldwide. Artists have created visual hay(na)ku. The form has
been written in Spanish, English, French, Finnish, Dutch, Tagalog, and
Norwegian. It has been taught in classrooms, and the National Autonomous
University of Mexico/Universidad Nacional Aut=F3noma de M=E9xico (UNAM) fea=
tures
an hay(na)ku webpage in their online journal, *Peri=F3dico de Poes=EDa*. Me=
mbers
of UNAM'S Faculty of Literature and Philosophy/Facultad de Filosofia y
Letras are also preparing a full Spanish translation of *The First Hay(na)k=
u
Anthology *for future release. Reflecting the hay(na)ku's continued
popularity, *THE HAY(NA)KU ANTHOLOGY, VOL. II* is released just three years
after the first hay(na)ku anthology. A third anthology is also in the works=
:
*The Chained Hay(na)ku *which would present hay(na)ku collaborations among
three or more writers. We hope readers enjoy this volume, and are encourage=
d
to try writing their own hay(na)ku!  For this poetic form also was created
as an Invitation to Poetry.

To celebrate its release, Meritage Press is pleased to announce a *RELEASE

Hello everyone,

Well, here's the news on the Blackbox delay.? I experienced a major crash of?my Verizon broadband AOL and lost approximately 60 submissions, plus my saved mail, etc.? Because of serious illness in the family, as well as a ton of professorial work, I have not had the time to work on this.? Now that my system is back up and running, and the spring semester has concluded, I'm asking all of you kind folks who sent submissions to resubmit.? My apologies for this, but it's all been beyond my control.? It's amazing that, considering the extent of family illness, I was able to teach, write reports,?grade exams and essays, and generally?complete?my work for the college semester.

Once again, go to WilliamJamesAustin.com and follow the Blackbox link for guidelines.

Best, Bill (William James Austin)?

 hello all,

 Just wanted to let you know that I'll be performing in the "Home Field
 Advantage" improv. series at the Toyeater's Studio in Jersey City this
 coming Friday night May 23.

 Joining me will be two great friends, Michael Lopez on percussion and
 Gerald Schwartz on voice. This will be the first time that the three of us
 have performed together since 1995.

 Toyeaters is located @ 143 Christopher Columbus Drive in Jersey City, one
 block west of the Grove St. PATH station. Showtime is 8 PM.

 I'm excited to be playing this and once again working with my longstanding
 friends Gerry and Mike Lopez.

 Those of you who listened to my "Headless Dachshund" webcast back in
 November, may remember Gerry's amazing over the phone recitation, it was a
 the highlight of the whole evening, Gerry is a phenomenal scribe in his own
 right and we have a long record of collaboration. we did a legendary
 performance at the Adler Planetarium in Chicago 3 years ago, which
 literally left the audience astounded.

 Mike Lopez is also a good friend who I have a track record with, though it
 has been a long time, since we shared the stage. Mike has worked with
 variety of great musicians including Sabir Mateen, Raphe Malik, and Bruce
 Eisenbel as well as the Faking Trains and Burnt Hills. Mike and I had an
 improv rock group back during the early 90s up in Albany.

 Thanks to everyone who came out to the Ontological last week....that was a
 great nite! Your support is appreciated.

A couple of friends and I are headed from Minnesota to the Conceptual Poetry
event in Tucson and we have a gig in Hays on Tuesday, the 27th.  We're
wondering if anyone out there might live within an hour or so this side of
Hays and might have some extra space for Monday night.

from Remi Kanazi:

Hi Everyone,

I wanted to let the listserv know about an anthology of poetry I've been
working on for the last two years, *Poets For Palestine*.


This is the first anthology to bring together poetry, hip hop, spoken word,
and art to pay tribute to Palestine; included are: Mahmoud Darwish, Amiri
Baraka, Suheir Hammad, Patricia Smith, Naomi Shihab Nye, D. H. Melhem,
Nathalie Handal, Lisa Suhair Majaj, E. Ethelbert Miller, Tahani Salah,
Ragtop from the Philistines, the N.O.M.A.D.S., Fawzia Afzal Khan, Annemarie
Jacir, Ibtisam Barakat, Kathy Engel, Junichi P. Semitsu, Melissa Hotchkiss,
Alicia Ostriker, Marilyn Hacker and many more!



Commemorating the 60th anniversary of the dispossession of the Palestinian
people, this collection presents 48 poems and includes 31 powerful images
created by Palestinian artists. As important, this anthology features a
array of ethnically diverse voices who use their words to elevate the
consciousness of humanity.



All the proceeds from the book will go toward funding future cultural
projects that highlight Arab artistry in the US.
Please visit the website for
excerpts<http://www.poetsforpalestine.com/webs/poets.htm>
, sample art <http://www.poetsforpalestine.com/webs/artists.htm>, and to
pre-order <http://www.poetsforpalestine.com/webs/buy.htm> your copy today at
www.PoetsForPalestine.com <http://www.poetsforpalestine.com/>!

Thanks!

Subject:      Israel Arrests Outspoken Academic Norman Finkelstein & Two
              articles on suppression of criticism in the US
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1
Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable
Content-Disposition: inline

The internationally renowned and outspoken  scholar and author Norman
Finkelstein was denied tenure which had been approved  at DePaul University
last year after extreme pressure and a campaign headed by  Alan Dershowitz
and the visit of  Israeli officials caused an intervention into the academi=
c
process.  Since his forced resignation, Finkelstein has experienced
continual harrassement.
The son of Holocaust survivors, born in Israel, Finkelstein has had a
difficult career in the US since his Ph.D days.
 The  New  Yorker recently ran a long article on the interventions in the
tenure process of  an award wining scholar and Professor at Barnard. This i=
s
part of  a larger pattern of such efforts at many American institutions
during recent years. The articles below discuss the efforts in the US to
suppress critics of Israeli governmental policies.

The War on Terror, like the Cold War in several ways, especially in the
1950's, has been a huge umbrella under cover of which the American
government has allowed the open suppression of a great many freedoms and
persons, while itself promoting
freedom" abroad. The open use of torture and open suppressions of freedom o=
f
speech, suspension of habeus corpus, the blatant media manipulation and
continual propaganda based on fictions, distortions and lies, grows more
ominous all the time.

John Stauber: Pentagon Propaganda Documents Go Online
<david.chirot@gmail.com>http://www.counterpunch.org/stauber05072008.html --=
-


The above link is for the Pentagon Propaganda Documents many of which were
used in a New York Times expose some weeks ago.
The Times, one of the worst offenders in carrying Propaganda for the War in
Iraq and the Israeli government and military polices, was hailed for a few
days for this "public service."

Within days, however, the Times brought back one of its biggest Iraq War
drum beating "reporters" to help with the increasingly disturbing rising in
tone towards a coming shriek of the last years' long buildup to a War in
Iran.

Despite the exposure of the American government's lies for the War in
Iraq--it looks as though they will be able to play the same tricks all over
again to trigger a massive attack on Iran, if not other countries as well.

In Israel, to mosque burnings has recently been added the bon fire burnings
of hundreds of New Testaments distributed by missionaries of a Jewish sect
which believes that Christ was the Messiah.

One wonders how far things will have to go in the US before people realize
what torture and book burnings and increasing suppression of Rights and the
distortions and dismantlings of the Constitution are leading them into?

"Change" is not going to magically just happen by (hopefully) electing a ne=
w
Administration. Look how much "change" has occurred with the "triumphs" of
the last election--

How long will writers and artists of a "free society" turn their eyes and
ears away from the suppression of Rights of speech and writing for others i=
n
the society, as though sooner or later it may not well be affecting them
also? Or--has the silencing already occurred to a far enough extent that
persons are too much in fear to speak out or stand up for their own Rights
as they are steadily being eroded--

Israel Arrests Outspoken Academic Norman Finkelstein

And the American academic Norman Finkelstein has been arrested and ordered
deported from Israel. Finkelstein arrived in Tel Aviv earlier today on his
way to the Occupied Territories. He was immediately detained and told he is
banned from Israel for ten years. He's expected to be deported tomorrow.
Finkelstein is known one of the most prominent academic critics of Israel's
occupation of the West Bank and Gaza.

http://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/25/opinion/25sun1.html?_r=1&th&emc=th&oref=slogin---

Even more disturbing is the Act mentioned in the editorial--
The Violent Radicalization and Homegrown Terrorism Prevention Act,
which passed by a landslide vote--

the Act is very vague in its definitions of what may constitute for example
"Violent Radicalization"--
and just what exactly is "Homegrown Terrorism"?--

will attacks on abortion clinics and doctors be seen as "Homegrown
Terrorism"?--
advocated on line by various individuals and groups--

or the Minutemen?--those self-appointed guardians of the borders with
Mexico--
or the Freemen in Idaho --?

when my oldest son was in high school in New Hampshire (the state with "Live
Free or Die" on  the license plates)--he wrote a paper for history class on
the right of the people of New Hampshire to violently overthrow the
government if it was suppressing or deliberately ignoring and subverting
the will of the people--

a great hue and cry went up and he was on the point of being kicked out,
banned from school--
asked to explain himself, he produced the New Hampshire State Constitution
which proclaims these very rights--
in fact it is damn near a DUTY of the citizens to overthrow a government
they elected which does not govern according to the will of the people--
give them the bum's rush!!

"Live Free or Die"!!!

under this new Act of course one--my son for example-- might end up in a
detention cell for years and years--let alone perhaps being sentenced to
life in prison--or a rendition flight to some unknown destination to be
tortured and held for a term without specification as to its end--and
without anyone knowing where he was--

after all grade school children already have been held and interrogated for
hours for having drawn a "violent" image of the President--suggesting
perhaps assassination if not dismemberment- in the eyes of some "concerned
citizens" or "local authorities" or their teacher---an image to these
fevered minds suggesting  ritual disembowelings perhaps--or the pig
slaughter style hanging of Mussolini upside down from an electricity  line
across a public street--

yes, little Debbie was known after al to have done acts of violence to
dolls--a sure fire sign of her desire to torture the President!--

and her drawing of him with a kind of mutilated looking body--was not at all
an example of child art--nor art brut nor naive art--nor the example of a
child who may simply not draw well in conventional terms--No!!--it was the
detailed planning of future sadistic acts and murder of  epicly ritual
proportions--which must be "nipped in the bud"--

under this Act--how can one easily identify who is one of these "Homegrown
terrorists"--

will it be anyone with an Arabic-sounding name?  A Muslim name?
(Barak Hussein Obama for example--obviously a "suspect" under these
terms--as Fox and email campaigns endlessly are reminding persons in primary
states--and swing states--)

will union organizers within corporations such as Starbucks or Wal Mart for
example be summarily accused of "Violent Radicalization"--
for wanting to form picket lines might persons be accused of "Homegrown
Terrrorism" via the congregating of persons "violently opposed" to the
privatization or selling out of their jobs? will handing out leaflets be
determined as an incitement to "Homegrown Terrorism"--

just about any form of activity can be seen as one of these dire threats
through the "right" lenses--

Senator Lieberman himself as a hard line Hawk, the only Senator to stand
firmly with President Bush and the Iraq War through thick and thin-- and  a
career-long devoted and dedicated representative of the Military-Industrial
Complex's interests-- might he not himself also be a form of "Homegrown
Terrorist" in the eyes of the world?

a "Violent Radical" who advocates "regime change" in other nations? and the
support of those "Homegrown Terrorists" abroad who are "with us" against
"them"?

Cervena Barva Press is pleased to announce the publication of
"A Cure For Suicide" by Larissa Shmailo
In "A Cure for Suicide” by Larissa Shmailo, Shmailo writes (as the founder of Fulcrum Magazine Philip Nikolayev points out in his introduction) as if she is …” constitutionally predestined to sing out her lines…her eyes filled with life and love, pain and death, freedom and coercion, the real of the mind and the imagined of the heart.” In the poem “Dancing with the Devil,” the poet sings about the need to throw caution to the wind and trip the light fantastic with the Devil:
“They say if you flirt with death,
you’re going to get a date;
But I don’t mind—the music’s fine,
And I love dancing with someone who can really lead.”
Shmailo put herself in the deceptive calmness of the eye of a hurricane, asks us to tell her what makes us tic, and takes us on the Harlem River Line, like the “Duke” took us on the “A” train. In a sea of mimics this poet is an original voice.

Hello everyone,

The very late winter gallery is now online.? It was my intention to post both the winter gallery and the spring gallery simultaneously, but since it's still spring, I'll take more time with that one.? Thanks to all who re-submitted.? If you did not make it into the winter gallery, you might still appear in the spring issue.? Hang in there a little while longer.

As always, go to WilliamJamesAustin.com and follow the Blackbox link.? Then take a long stroll (scroll) through the galleries until you arrive at the most recent.

Best, Bill

OK, poets (at least those in NYC)... the event you've waited your whole

Fund for Art Exchange), supported by the New York-based Finnish
Cultural Institute, features members of the public who join as a choir
under  the leadership of professional composer and musicians to put on
performance in  public venues.

Complaints Choirs have performed in more than a dozen  cities around the
world. The first one in the United States was in Chicago in  November
2007 where more than 50 choir members griped about their city and

the NYC choir in an interactive workshop activity.  Admission is free to
registered participants, and complimentary food and  beverages will be
provided.

Tellervo Kalleinen and Oliver  Kochta-Kalleinen, the Finnish artists who
created the Complaints Choir  concept, which became a world-wide
phenomenon, invite everyoone to take part. To participate, individuals

The Serial Killer

Not the shadow that hides
Beneath a laughter,
Carving up girls, sticking up boys
Not the fellow below the touch of religion
Counting his bullets, sharpening his knives
For the next lab work

No, he makes the law, is the law
Will render many jobless, many hopeless
The aged hurried to their graves
Yes, spreads misery from the high horse

The next death was the last birth of promises
To build heaven across hell fires
A cold saint, does he not tell
How to spare the land & spoil the people?

The history books cannot exactly tell
How many lives built the State House
And the many litres of blood used in painting it
For the myth of national pride


                        -- Obododimma

=93Story of Learning=94After
I learned the language, I learned it well. Then went down to the lake.
I said, =93Hey, Pond, you got rabbit-congress, how about witch go
seventeen something something?=94 Pond said, =93Man, the language is not
like that. You better learn.=94 So I learned. I learned and learned. Then
said to Old Man Killer Whale, =93Nice for this mine, your thermos mine,
your brown interval mine, your Viggo Mortenson.=94 Killer Wheel said,
=93Not far enough yet, son. But if you study, your own reward will be
that you studied.=94 Shivering and shaking, I studied and learned. I
learned hand and by hand and hand stealing and victim-focused learning.
Then I met Wall Of Dogs. Wall said, =93You look like another dog for me.=94
I said, =93Yes, cylinder and me talking=97like night fighting=97and yes or
same project makes blame, the astrolabe, wicca, not chancy chancy, all
these marriages end in more desire.=94 Wall Of Dogs spoke, and said,
=93Only that last bit showed some learning.=94 So I made the Walking Wall
my right side master, learned something else on my left and in my front
I wished for a gymnastics container. I said, =93I=92ve learned. This old
language in mine, and easy now. I have it for naming and knowing and
learning.=94 Then Hey Pond, Old Killer Whale Man, and Dog Wall said, =93Ho!
Ho! Pond Consonant Boy, look at you, handclapping for bottles and
vowels and cans!=94

Simone White, a
Cave Canem fellow, is the author of a collaborative chapbook in
conversation with the paintings of Kim Thomas (forthcoming from Q
Avenue Press). Currently a doctoral student in English at CUNY Graduate
Center, she lives in Brooklyn.

=93Poem That Reminds Me of Barack Obama=94
Ice house, not original with me, marooned on an ice plateau,
phantom.  Were I captured, rendered elsewhere pictorially,
some other grey flake of building would be like
an erotics of long-headed men,
                                                              which are, li=
ke suburbs, not independently epic.
Cavalcade of the long-headed man,
                                                              turf one so w=
ants to lie down on,
like a basketball star is an aggregate of longings to fly or be multiple, r=
aceless selves,
like angels, like abstraction itself,
nonetheless like the awesome black cock we always imagined and coveted,
like, =93The tricks I could do with a new eye pencil!=94,=20
like, =93A husband like hers erases neutrality.=94                   =20
                                                             And what about=
 grasses, blades of grass?
Like a fact no one has use for, these have no manner
unlike difficulty, like things I won=92t talk about.
Like a scratched off part of my face.=

I'm interested in starting a CD line for Moria Books.  The CDs would
be basically PODs with 30-60 minutes of individual poets reading their
works.  The CDs would be cheap and always in print.  As usual, I'm
interested in "experimental" work, so being playful with the limits is
appreciated.

If you are interested in joining the project, let me know.  You'll
need to record your own sound.  Once I receive it, I'll clean it up,
if needed, and get a CD cover ready.

Between Cup and Lip, Peter Manson=92s first American book publication, =20=

contains 18 years of previously uncollected work. The book forms the =20

Good of Liars (Barque, 2006) and Adjunct: An Undigest (Edinburgh =20
Review, 2005), demonstrating the continuum between the prosodically=96=20=

dense, endlessly considered poetry of the former and the procedural =20
work of the latter. Manson has taught at Cambridge University and =20
other institutions. He lives in Glasgow, where he edits the small =20

=93=91Ah more eh=85oh oh=92. In the light of Faraday=92s candle =
Coleridge =20
channels Loewenhoek and Whalen (I was thinking) as Peter Manson =20
shakes the frayed carpet of culture and, as a fearless Duprat caddis =20
fly larva, makes jewels from the motes. Even the bits of themselves =20
the poems create make interesting shadows. =91Groups of words which =20
didn=92t describe the image but which were it=92. Yes. Wit, =
intelligence, =20
a dispassionate view of self: plus images that are not words. Nothing =20=

to want for in this excellent book that moved my chitin heart.=94
=97Tom Raworth

=93Peter Manson is the language veterinarian, elbow-deep in the =20
mysterious interior of our discourse, groping intimately to clutch =20
the dark beauty of its palpitating offals, approaching the apparatus =20
of its speech-making from entirely the wrong direction. If every word =20=

was once an animal, then every animal was harmed in the making of =20

Subject:      from Hilton Obenzinger: Meditations in a Time of Delusions and
              Lies 28: Columbia 1968

I send these "Meditations in a Time of Delusions and Lies" to friends with
the essay typically pasted into the message. This essay is too long,
however. I hope you read it by clicking on to the link below. This
reflection is about the conference I recently helped to put on to
commemorate the 40th anniversary of the student occupation and strike at
Columbia University in 1968.

For these past 4 decades, Columbia as an institution has been in denial
about the student rebellion in 1968. Other universities have had an easier
time coming to terms with what took place during those tumultuous times --
but Columbia has remained traumatized.

This was confirmed when several 68ers met with Columbia President Lee
Bollinger in March, 2007 -- and it was one of the reasons why he encouraged
us to organize the conference. It was time, he felt, for the university to
accept this history, even if there remain controversies and even open
wounds. When we pointed out that there were parallels between the past and
today -- Columbia's expansion plans of building a gym in Morningside Park
and the Vietnam War, then, and Columbia expansion plans of building a new
campus in West Harlem and the Iraq War, now -- he felt that Columbia was not
acting as it did back then, that the institution is far more open, that they
work with the community, encourage dissent, and so forth. On our part, we
wanted to return to the campus as an accepted part of the university
community, and it was from that vantage point that we would be able to
understand whatever is happening today -- and to seek out ties with current
students.

Others, particularly those opposing the expansion, would vehemently disagree
with Bollinger's assessment that today's Columbia works with the community.
(To be sure, it would be hard for an administration today to be as arrogant
and autocratic as President Grayson Kirk's in 1968 -- and it was his
thick-headedness that created the perfect storm for the eruption that took
place.) But, still, the university, while not co-sponsoring the conference,
supported our work by giving us access to facilities, and faculty members
and Lee Bollinger spoke at the opening night event and on one of the panels.
This upset some of the critics of Columbia's policies -- but I think it
upset the right-wing more. An article in *The Daily News* labeled the
conference an "all-Bolshevik" affair -- and they castigated Bollinger for
associating himself with us.

So, you are invited to go to the url below and read the wild musings of a
Bolshevik lost in time.

a great voice for Anarchism, Peace & the IWW

    The "Golden Voice of the Great Southwest": Legendary Folk Musician,
Activist Utah Phillips, 1935-2008

   -
   <http://www.democracynow.org/2008/5/27/utah_phillips_1935_2008_legendary_folk>

   Utah Phillips, the legendary folk musician and peace and labor activist,
   has died at the age of seventy-three. Over the span of nearly four decades,
   Utah Phillips worked in what he referred to as "the Trade," performing
   tirelessly throughout the United States, Canada and Europe. The son of labor
   organizers, Phillips was a lifelong member of the Industrial Workers of the
   World, known as the Wobblies. As a teenager, he ran away from home and
   started living as a hobo who rode the rails and wrote songs about his
   experiences. In 1956, he joined the Army and served in the Korean War, an
   experience he would later refer to as the turning point of his life. In
   1968, he ran for the US Senate on the Peace and Freedom Party ticket. For
   the past twenty-one years he lived in Nevada City, where he started a
   nationally syndicated folk music radio show. He also helped found the
   Hospitality House homeless shelter and the Peace and Justice Center. We
   spend the hour with an interview with Phillips from January 2004. [includes
   rush transcript]

Is the monkey creating in proto a new form of "Conceptual Poetry?"

To telekinetically instruct and move  the manipulations of a robotic arm &
hand--

(There is already an ever more sophisticated production of Haptic machines,
which can actually "feel by touch" and discriminate among varying elements
and degrers of the qualities of surfaces.)

For those with cortical damage this is very great medical news-

9 a.m.            =20

Session with Craig Dworkin

The Politics of Conceptual Writing. This seminar will investigate the
politics of conceptual writing. Understanding politics broadly as =
=93relations
of power,=94 we will seek to better understand the way in which those
relations are reconfigured by the various contexts in which conceptual
writing practices might be read: plagiarism and copyright; new media and
government surveillance; psychosis and medical diagnosis; publishing =
fads;
the Situationists=92 principle of detournement. Several case studies =
will be
presented, followed by open participation.     =20

10:15 a.m.      =20

Session with Caroline Bergvall

=20

Forms of Social Engagement. In this workshop, I will be looking at
conceptual methods as they frame and favour socially engaged forms of
writing. I will be using examples from my own work as well as from a few
other writers/poets who work conceptually to set up a discussion around
questions of personal history and poetic process; bilingualisms and =
writing
engagement; language awareness and writing systems. =20

=20

11:30 a.m.      =20

Session with Kenneth Goldsmith

=20

Uncreative Writing Workshop. It's clear that long-cherished notions of
creativity are under attack, eroded by file-sharing, media culture,
widespread sampling, and digital replication. How does writing respond =
to
this new environment? This workshop will rise to that challenge by =
employing
strategies of appropriation, replication, plagiarism, piracy, sampling,
plundering, as compositional methods. Along the way, we?ll look at the =
rich
history of forgery, frauds, hoaxes, avatars, and impersonations spanning =
the
arts, with a particular emphasis on how they employ language. =
Participants
will be penalized for showing any trace of originality, sincerity or
honesty.=20

=20

12:30 p.m.      =20

break for lunch

                       =20

2:15 p.m.        =20

Panel Discussion with featured poets moderated by Tenney Nathanson

=20

4:00 p.m.        =20

Session with Cole Swensen

=20

What to do besides describe it: Ekphrasis that ignores the subject. The
tradition of ekphrasis is based in evoking a work of art, of bringing it
into the heart of the poem, and, traditionally, this is done through
description. And this is all well and good, but is it not a bit =
limiting? In
this hour, we=92ll look beyond subject-matter to the many formal echoes
between the visual arts and poetry:  rhythm, juxtaposition, repetition,
parallelism, and many other principles can help the writer engage a work =
of
art in collaborative ways. Introductory comments supported by visual
examples will be followed by an in-class writing exercise, so do bring
writing materials.

SATURDAY, MAY 31

=20

9 a.m.             =20

Session with Tracie Morris

=20

Black conceptual poetics: examples for crafting. In this workshop, we =
will
look at ways in which identity is explored through the  simultaneous use =
of
conventional form and the freedom from it. How does freedom in and out =
of
form present models of Black thinking and how does this illuminate an
overarching American sense of self? We will analyze specific texts from
African American artists and workshop ways in our understanding of this =
text
helps us in our own writing and editing.=20

   =20

10:15 a.m.      =20

Roundtable Discusson with Marjorie Perloff, Moderator; Jesper Olsson; =
Marie
Smart; Linda Reinfeld; Vanessa Place; Charles Alexander; Brian Reed

                       =20

1:45 p.m.        =20

Session with Christian B=F6k

=20

Two dots over a vowel. Lest we dismiss the tactics of conceptual =
literature
as nothing more than the mere symptoms of a creeping, literary necrosis,
occasioned by the murder of the author at the hands of such postmodern
theorizers as Barthes, for example, or perhaps Foucault let us consider =
that
this novel genre  might strive to accent the disjunction between
"intentionality" (_what we mean to mean_) and "expressiveness" (_what we
seem to mean_). If the lyric voice, for the sake of an authentic =
sincerity,
yearns to repair this breach between what we intend to say and what we
appear to say then conceptual literature, by contrast, accentuates this
discrepancy.

=20

3:00 p.m.        =20

Session with Charles Bernstein

=20

Poetry Rules!: The Concept of Poetry. =93What is poetry?=94 said jesting =
Pilate
and would not stay for an answer. The definitional question haunts and
propels poetry. I will start with some aphoristic remarks on =
philosophical,
aesthetic, and ethical approaches to the issue. Then I will present some
case studies. By session end, we should be able to come up with some =
hard
and fast rules for why there can=92t be hard and fast rules.=20

=20

4:15 p.m.        =20

Roundtable Discussion with Marjorie Perloff, Moderator; Barbara Cole; =
Wystan
Curnow; Jonathan Stalling; Gra=E7a Capinha; Stephen Fredman; Laynie =
Browne

*DAVID-BAPTISTE CHIROT: "Conceptual Poetry and its Others"---Haunting
Questions Found Hidden in Plain Site/Sight/Cite*








http://davidbaptistechirot.blogspot.com/2008/05/conceptual-poetry-and-its-o=
thers.html


Below are the opening paragraphs of this essay--if interested still, as it
goes through many changes and has two appendices as further "evidences"--
go to the blog address above--


Note:I  was invited to send Visual Poetry works to the Symposium on
"Conceptual Poetry and its Others," along with artist's statements regardin=
g
the works.  As a participant, to express my sense of and thankfulness for
this, I decided it would be nice to include also a brief statement re the
"Conceptual Poetics" under discussion.

Once started, so many ideas started flowing,and so many examples came to
mind--travel literature of the 18th century, Shakespeare's Richard the
Third, to name but two--that I had to draw line somewhere and stop. There i=
s
so much more to write however, once started--so these remarks and questions
are but a small indication of the most basic beginnings of the myriad
directions which are out there to be found--and ones already noted to set
down in various forms and actions--

this essay is on display beside my works at the Symposium--persons
interested may ask for a copy--

a few examples of further questions among ever so many more--

Why is "boring, unoriginal, impersonal work" promoted by "colorful
personalities," just like any other product?  Does this not create "a Line"
produced by a Brand Name, the Original Author possessed of an "originality"
in creating this "radical, new form"--to be marketed as "the latest thing,"
for the development of new jobs in English/
creative Writing Programs--the "newest way" to "make an impression" by the
"original" creation of an impersonal boringness?  Is this in itself a "new
way" of mass producing standardized and conforming
"conceptual poets" who "carry on" the work of the Great Originators?
*
*Are monkeys controlling robotic arms with their thoughts on the way to
creating a Conceptual poetry?--*

*What are the interelationships of possiblities of Conceptual Poetry for us=
e
in Propaganda and advertising? For starting wars, altering Wikipedia,
sending out false news items and etc etc--*

*     J'ai trop a ecrire, c'est pourquoi je n'ecrire rien.  --Stendhal,
Journal, 1804


      Thoughts come at random, and go at random.  No device for holding on
to
      them or for having them.
      A thought has escaped:  I was trying to write it down:  instead I
write that it has
       escaped me.
                                       --Pascal, Pensees, #542



To find among typos the unknown writings, the "Helltoy"--
camouflaged clouds, the voice-writings of the ground itself that speaks and
moves in lines
emerging--

*for Petra Backonja*

* *
I find in thinking with what a Conceptual Poetry might be, that I've
begun with a point of view of paradox.  That is, considering the
conceptual to be the absence of a material object, a conceptual poetry
would be the absence of the poem as a "realization" of its "idea."  If
"the poem" as an object is not to be realized, in what ways may it
then be said to "exist"?

   One may also ask=97since language is the material of poetry, if
one is to create a conceptual poetry=97does this mean then that the
absence of language is involved?  That the poetry is not in language,
but found elsewhere?

The predominant view of conceptual works in art and poetry is that it
is written language which becomes fore grounded, most often as the
"realization" and presentation of various directives, with their
various forms of pre-conceived constraints, and sets of instructions.
Yet does not the written language itself, as an object which
"constitutes" the directives and instructions, contradict the
"concept" of the "Conceptual?"

{See Appendix B below for some other "Science Fiction" aspects of Conceptua=
l
Poetry in Relation to the Work Place.)

The directives themselves, expressed in written language, become road
blocks to the Conceptual which is supposed to be "activated" by their
instructions.

   To use written language then to create a conceptual poetry is
not in a strict sense "conceptual" at all, if it produces yet another
object in written language.

    It becomes instead a piling up, a massing, of materials
(language, words) which have "walled out" as it were, the conceptual.
Are the words then simply a gravestone or monument to a now absent
concept?

    And what of the "poet" who is the "author" of "Conceptual Poetry?"

     A builder of roadblocks, a maker of monuments and gravestones--?

    If a "poet" is the conceiver of concepts=97and the realization of
the concept as a poem is no longer a concept=97but an object=97does this
then mean that the poet, in order to be "conceptual," must no longer
be a "poet?"  Or in order to be a "poet," no longer be "conceptual" in
approach?  And yet who but a "conceptual poet" can produce "conceptual
poetry?"

    Perhaps true Conceptual Poetry is the creation of illiterates?
     And, beyond that, persons who may even be very limited in
their "Conceptual capacities?"

      I think often of all the Conceptual Poets and Artists who
have existed and worked through thousands of years, persons due to
their circumstances --gender being the most common among these--who
are not allowed to know how to write, nor instructed in "art," nor permitte=
d
to
be educated, yet all the same--may have produced Conceptually a good
deal of the greatest Poetry and Art of which there does not remain and
never was an "object," even as a "fragment."

  What of these myriads of centuries of Conceptual Works--are they
still existing--?  Are they alive in the Conceptual realm?  The Ether?
 Or have they found ways on their own, independent of their creators,
of camouflaging themselves among those things in the world which are
hidden in plain site/sight/cite?

   In working with the found that is hidden in plain
site/sight/cite, I find often that a Conceptual poetry and art is
there--always already there--which I think I am finding yet may well
be finding me,

     Some aspects of confronting these dilemmas, these "haunting
questions," are found among Conceptual Poets who emphasize an
"impersonation" via performance, camouflages, costumes, the uses of
heteronyms, pseudonyms and anonymity.

    In "The Painter of Modern Life," Baudelaire is the first to
define Modernism and does so as a conjunction of the eternal and the
ephemeral.  To find that element of the eternal in the ephemeral which
Baudelaire saw as embodying modernity, he turns to an emphasis on the
particular form of the living art/art as living of the Dandy.  The
Dandy is the non-separation of art and life in the conceiving of one's
existence as Performance Art.  The Dandy becomes not an expression of
Romantic personality and individuality, but a form of becoming an
animated Other, an impersonator going about performing the actions of a
concept,
rather than producing the objects of a conception.

 This  stylized impersonating, non-producing figure begins to appear
"dramatically"
in the works of Wilde and Jarry and in many ways in the "life and
works" of a Felix Feneon, who "creates at a distance" via anonymous
newspaper faits divers (discovered to be his and republished
posthumously as Novels in Three Lines), pseudonymous articles in
differing registers of language (working class argot, standardized
French) in Anarchist and mainstream journals, unsigned translations, and
the barely noted in their own pages of his editing of journals featuring th=
e
early efforts of  rising stars of French literature.  Quitting his
camouflaged and concealed writing activities, Feneon works the rest of his
life as a seller in an art gallery.

   The actual "works" of Feneon, then, are not written objects per
se, but anonymous actions, ephemeral pseudonymous "appearances in
print," and the works of others which he affects a passage for in his
editorship and translations, in his promoting and selling the art
works of others.  This "accumulation" which one finds "at a distance"
in time as his "complete works," is often unobserved and unknown to his
contemporaries, who know of him primarily via his "way of acting," his
manner
of dressing, his speech mannerisms, and as the public triptych of images of
him existing as a painted portrait by Seurat, a Dandy-pose
photo and a mug shot taken when tried as part of an Anarchist
"conspiracy."  Feneon's "identity as a writer" does not exist as "an
author," but as a series of "performances," "appearances" and
"influences," many of them "unrecognized" and "unattributed."


  Ironically, it his most "clandestine" activity=97his Anarchist
activities=97which
brings him the most in to the public and tabloid spotlight.  As one of "The
Thirty" accused and tried for "conspiracy" in a much publicized trial, it i=
s
Feneon's severe mug shot that for a time presents his "public face."

The severe mug facing the viewer is actually producing a Conceptual Poetry
"at a distance." By not penning a single line, by simply "facing the music"
to which others pen the lyrics, Feneon, in doing nothing more than facing
the camera "capturing" his image,  proceeds to enact a series of dramas
"projected" on to him, a series of "identities," and "revelations" which us=
e
the documentary material to produce a series of mass-published fictions.

 The possible prison term facing the "Felix Feneon" in the inmate-numbered
"anonymous"  mug shot, "presents its face" to the viewer, a face "taken,"
"imprisoned" and "caught" by the image and its publicity.  This publicized
face  facing camera and viewer and possible hard time, is "taken to be" the
photo of the face of a being from whom the mask of the clandestine and
conspiratorial have been torn off, revealing "the cold hard truth" of Felix
Feneon.

 Facing trial, however, all that is learned of this imprisoned face is that
it is "the wrong man, an innocent man."  This fixed image, acquitted of its
"sensational" charges, is revealed not as a truth, but instead as simply a
mask, a mask operating like a screen or blank sheet of paper, onto which ar=
e
projected  the dramas, fictions and "think piece"  writings of others.
Nothing is revealed other than an "identity" which shifts, travels, changes
from one set of captions to another.  It is via these captions written by
others under his image in the papers and placards, that Feneon continues hi=
s
"writing at a distance."  Simply by facing the camera, facing charges,
"facing the music," facing his accusers at trial and facing the verdict and
judgment, Feneon is "writing" a myriad captions, breaking news items,
commentaries, editorials, all of which change with wild speeds as they race
to be as "up-to-minute" as the events themselves are in "unfolding."



 The professionals, these writers, these journalists and reporters of
"reality,"  chase desperately, breathlessly, after the unfolding drama in
which the mug shot is "framed," and in so doing produce texts of
"speculative fiction," a serial Conceptual Poetry with as its "star player"
a writer whose own texts are deliberately written to be unrecognized,
hidden, camouflaged, unknown. And all the while, this writer writing nothin=
g
is producing vast heaps of writing via the work of others, as yet another
form of camouflaged clandestine Conceptual Poetry, "hot off the press."


     Rimbaud writes of a concept of the poetry of the future in
which poetry would precede action=97which in a sense he proceeds to
"perform" himself.  If one reads his letters written after he stopped
writing poetry, one finds Rimbaud living out, or through, one after
another of what now seem to be "the prophecies" of his own poetry.
That is, the poetry is the "conceptual framework" for what becomes his
"silence" as a poet, and is instead his "life of action."

       In these examples, one finds forms of a "conceptual poetry"
in which the poetry is in large part an abandonment of language, of
words, of masses of "personally signed" "poetry objects," "poetry
products."  One finds instead a vanishing, a disappearance of both
language and "poet" and the emergence of that "some one else" Rimbaud
recognized prophetically, preceding the action--in writing=97in the
"Lettre du voyant,"  "the Seer's letter"=97as "I is an other."

         An interesting take on a conceptual poetry in writing is
found in one of Pascal's Pensees, #542:



      "Thoughts come at random, and go at random.  No device for holding on
to
      them or for having them.
      A thought has escaped:  I was trying to write it down:  instead I
write that it has
       escaped me."


        The writing is a notation of the "escaped" concept's
absence, its escape that is a line of flight that is a "flight out of time"
as Hugo Ball entitles his Dada diaries.   Writing not as a method of
remembering, of "capturing
thought," but as the notation of the flight of the concept at the
approach of its notation.

        Writing, then, as an absence=97 an absence of the concept.
 A Conceptual Poetry of writing as "absent-mindedness"!=97A writing which d=
oes
nothing more than elucidate that the escaping of thoughts "which come at
random, and go at random" has occurred.

         This flight of the concept faced with its
notation=97indicates a line of flight among the examples of Rimbaud=97a
"flight into the desert" as it were, of silence as a poet=97and of
Feneon=97the flight into anonymous writing of very small newspaper "faits
divers"
items punningly entitled "Nouvelles en trois lignes" (News/Novels in Three
Lines),  of pseudonymous writings in differing guises at the same time
according to the journals in which they appear, and as translator and
editor as well as "salesperson" in a gallery of "art objects," a
conceptual masquerader among the art-objects embodying "concepts" and
becoming no longer "concepts' but "consumer items."   Feneon's framed  mug
shot on to whose mug is projected a "serial crime novel," written by others
and "starring" the mug in the mug shot, a writer of unknown and unrecognize=
d
texts who now vanishes into a feverish series of captions and headlines.

     Anonymity, pseudonyms, impersonations, poets who write their own comin=
g
silence and "disappearance" as an "I is an other," the deliberately
unrecognized and unrecognizable poet whose mug shot becomes the  mass
published and distributed "crime scene" for police blotters and headlines,
speculative fictions and ideological diatribes, the writing which is a
notation of the flight of the concept, the writing of non-writers who "neve=
r
wrote a word," yet whose concepts may be found camouflaged, doubled,
mirrored, shadowed, anonymously existing hidden in pain
site/sight/cite=97these nomadic elements which appear and disappear compris=
e a
Conceptual Poetry in which the concepts and poets both impersonate Others
and reappear as "Somebody Else," an Other unrecognized and unrecognizable
found hidden in plain site/sight/cite.


     "It is not the elements which are new, but the order of
their arrangement," is another Pascalian "pensee."  One finds
arrangements of the elements of Rimbaud and Feneon into the various
forms of "conceptual poetry" in the works of Pessoa, Spicer and Yasusada.
Pessoa creates many others as poets, heteronyms with their own works
and actions, their own concepts of poetry. Spicer "translates" poetry "afte=
r
Lorca" as well as exchanging letters with the dead poet, lives for a summer
with his ghost, who provides a foreword to Spicer's Book.

My new poetry chapbook, PAID IN GOATS is available for purchase and signing here at Etsy and at Art for the Cash Poor in the Crane Arts Building, Philadelphia, PA on June 14th. The title is taken from my poem, "The Rape of Tamar" which details the current papacy's announcement of seven moral evils, my take on certain Catholic rites, and the Biblical story of Tamar.

PAID IN GOATS contains tales of teaching, art installations, and even old flames. As per usual, the sparest tenses meld with the simplest forms...a sestina, an elegy, tight quatrains. The majority of the pieces contained within were written during April 2008 during which I wrote a poem per day for National Poetry Month.

The poems are punctuated by reproductions of my visual art pieces, some of which were recently installed in the rEVOLUTION show at the University of Michigan, a Feminist Art Project show.

Pieces in PAID IN GOATS were previously published by Parlor Journal and Helix Magazine.  My work has also recently appeared in Black Robert Journal: http://www.black-robert-journal.com/.

For purchase:

Kenning Editions is pleased to announce the publication of THE PINK, a
chapbook of poetry by Kyle Schlesinger. THE PINK offers a sequence of
short poems with a detourned ear and an earnest intelligence. Condensing
the remarkable craft of the long series Schlesinger collected as his
debut volume, 2007's HELLO HELICOPTER, THE PINK reminds us that, as in
language, "There are plenty of rivers in the sea / But you can't step on
the same fish twice." An admired poet, editor, and publisher,
Schlesinger has lectured and published extensively on topics related to
poetics, visual communication, and artists' books. He lives and prints
in New York.

THE PINK: the color of course, or the recurrent carnations among the
gathered leaves of this little bouquet, but also the sheer force of the
form, the shear of a kind of textile cut, jagged and precise—a kind of
coup de grace—not just between lines but also opening the serrated space
between letters to reveal the "hue" in "house" or to separate the "ink"
from the "inkling," the "blue" from the "print." To distinguish, in
other words, the abstract plan from the material written form. In that
linguistic pinking, Kyle Schlesinger cuts both into and against the
weave, an angular slide into the inframince space of "the leading of a
phrase" (both the leading question of rhetoric and the spacing of
letterforms), somewhere "between the chair and the thought of it" (where
chair is the French for "body"), or "the sensation of a concept" and
"the concept of a sensation." Here is the world, of words, in miniature,
through rose-colored magnifying glasses. --Craig Dworkin

Next in Kenning Editions’ series of trade paperbacks: AMBIENT PARKING
LOT, by Pamela Lu. Part fiction, part earnest mockumentary, AMBIENT
PARKING LOT follows a band of musicians as they wander the parking
structures of urban downtown and greater suburbia in quest of the
ultimate ambient noise--one that promises to embody their historical
moment and deliver them up to the heights of their self-important
artistry. Along the way, they make sporadic forays into lyric while
contending with doubts, delusions, miscalculations, mutinies, and minor
triumphs. This saga peers into the wreckage of a post-9/11 landscape and
embraces the comedy and poignancy of failed utopia. Pamela Lu is the
author of Pamela: A Novel. Her work appears in the anthology Biting the
Error and in periodicals such as Harper’s, Chicago Review, call: a
review, 1913, and Fascicle.

Of equal interest: sexoPUROsexoVELOZ, A BILINGUAL EDITIONS OF BOOKS TWO
AND THREE OF DOLORES DORANTES, BY DOLORES DORANTES (translated by Jen
Hofer), a co-publication of Kenning Editions and Counterpath Press. “My
favorite writer in the world, for example, is Dolores Dorantes, whose
book is propped up in a sort of crystal plantation on the desk in the
back room, where I theoretically write but actually revert, given a
tuppence, given anything really -- a bone, cups of tea, delicious Earl
Grey biscuits from a kind graduate student -- to the Portuguese alcove
next to the kitchen. She (d.d., which means sister in Hindi, a sister in
writing) writes about iguanas and dancing, but I don't care what she
writes about because just being near the book is altering. An
hormonal interface.”—Bhanu Kapil. “Dorantes collapses the traditional
separation between author and text; subject and object; writing and
written. She makes of herself a text that is written, fashioned,
constructed. This gesture, which at first seems effusive and almost
Whitmanesque, is actually diffuse and, at times, self-effacing…”—Mark
Tursi. “Being able to read the Spanish pretty well but focusing more on
the English (the two versions of each poem are very nicely presented on
the same page in this book) my sense is that the ‘you’ in Dorantes’
poems is not threatening or threatened except ultimately with the death
that produces the inevitable separateness of one being from the other.
There is in her address to the beloved a passion that doesn’t seem
ironic.”—Laura Moriarty.

Good to see outsider/insider placed together on equal footing as opposed to,
say, insiders emphasized with the outsiders who influenced them present as
footnotes, though of course appearing in a museum show throws the outsider
designation into question.

'The skull-holder was not really so, but was a nirmana form of
Heruka, who said, "In this life you must write the six main
texts and in the _bar-do_ period you will attain the very highest
siddhi." The acarya replied,

  "When pressed beneath your feet, even my lower
  winds vanish.
  By your kind mercy, please withdraw your left
  leg!
  If your nine-fold crest ornaments are kept
  straight, even the Brahma-realm vanishes.
  Please remain with your head moving but a little!
  If your hands are kept straight, the guardians of
  the four quarters become terrified.
  By your kind mercy please withdraw your hands
  a little!
  O noble one, as your body is in a dancing pose
  and is purposefully maintained,
  I bow down before you with faith and an excess
  of reverence!"'
