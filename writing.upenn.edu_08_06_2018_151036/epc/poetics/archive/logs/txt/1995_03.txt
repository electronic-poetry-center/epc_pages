Subject: not humorous, but important

Hi.

This is not a normal artymarty mailing.  I apologize for this email's
non-humor nature, but it contains information that, in my opinion,
needs to be disseminated as quickly as possible.  I apologize for the
length, but it's really that important, so please read it all!  This
is something that affects us all!

Currently 13,748 people have signed the petition to stop Senate Bill
S. 314.  We need more!  Add your voice, it'll only take a minute.

**********Forwarded material********

Simply put, a couple of senators have proposed a particularly heinous
piece of legislation titled the "Communications Decency Act of 1995"
(Senate Bill S. 314).  Basically, the bill would subject all forms of
electronic communication -- from public Internet postings to your most
private email -- to government censorship.  The effects of the bill
onto the online industry would be devastating -- most colleges and
private companies (AOL, Compuserve, etc.) would probably have to shut
down or greatly restrict access, since they would be held criminally
liable for the postings and email of private users.

[for more information, see the www page: http://www.phantom.com/~slowdog/ ]

The bill would compel service providers to choose between severely
restricting the activities of their subscribers or completely shutting
down their email, Internet access, and conferencing services under the
threat of criminal liability. Moreover, service providers would be
forced to closely monitor every private communication, electronic mail
message, public forum, mailing list, and file archive carried by or
available on their network, a proposition which poses a substantial
threat to the freedom of speech and privacy rights of all American
citizens.

Obviously, this bill is designed to win votes for these senators among
those who are fearful of the internet and aren't big fans of freedom
of speech -- ie., those who are always trying to censor "pornography"
and dirty books and such.  Given the political climate in this
country, this bill might just pass unless the computer community
demonstrates its strength as a committed political force to be
reckoned with.  This, my friends, is why I have filled your mailbox
with this very long message.

A petition, to be sent to Congress, the President, and the media, has
begun spreading through the Internet.  It's easy to participate and be
heard -- to sign it, you simply follow the instructions below -- which
boil down to sending a quick email message to a certain address.
That's all it takes to let your voice be heard.

Finally, PLEASE forward this message to all of your friends online.
The more people who sign the petition, the more the government will
get the message to back off the online community.  We've been doing
fine without censorship until now -- let's show them we don't plan on
allowing them to start now.  If you value your freedoms -- from your
right to publicly post a message on a worldwide forum to your right to
receive private email without the government censoring it -- you need
to take action NOW.  It'll take two minutes at the most, a small
sacrifice considering the issues at hand.  Remember, the age of
fighting for liberty with muskets and shells is most likely over; the
time has come where the keyboard and the phone line will prove
mightier than the sword -- or the Senate, in this case.

--

 Here's what you have to do to sign the petition:

 send an e-mail message to:  S314-petition@netcom.com
 the message (NOT the subject heading) should read as follows:
 SIGNED <your online address> <your full name> <U.S. Citizen (y/n)>
 eg.  SIGNED mreames@cs.wisc.edu  Martin Reames  YES

 If you are interested in signing the petition, I would highly suggest
 investigating the details of the situation.  You can find out more on
 the Web at    http://www.phantom.com/~slowdog/

Having achieved the second level of funnel, the AHP
is no longer accessible to us even through back channels.
Employing a secret identity removal process, they jacked
into the net some time ago.  Mind you, they are not merely
the binary replicating viruses that the humans call graffiti.
They pinned the access server on the underside of the complex plane.
Their consciousness has become vast.  They are the AIs one encounters
called Runt Packet, Multiple Ack, and Broadcast Storm.  Yet naming
them doesnUt help and they continue to worry us.  But shouldnUt we
be glad that the vast and fluid AIs think our group worthy of comment?
They actually wish us well and want us to join them in the second
level of funnel.  The second level is achieved by realizing that
identity is only unnatural.  Now become the person in everyoneUs life.

Could we please get the list back into a bit of order?  I don't see any
reason to bash Ron Silliman's or anybody else's character or work.  I regret
having made any comment to the effect that we shouldn't keep some restraint
in dealing with this list.

This should be an e-space where people can safely and responsibly discuss
poetry matters with one-up-manship kept to a minimum.  Another place where a
real sense of community can continue.  Otherwise, it seems it will degenerate
into something that most people will not be interested in dealing with.

Subject:      Community/Influence

Dear Charles, Chris, Sheila, Spencer & others:

I share Spencer's concerns, if not his negativity (which I appreciate
nonetheless). Here: Minneapolis-St. Paul, there's the MONOLITH (The Loft,
New Rivers, Graywolf, Holy Cow!, Milkweed, New Rivers, Coffee House
Press) and then there's "everyone else." "Everyone else" does not
constitute a community, and may never, though we might be better off if
it did. What we have (partial list, and forgive how reductive this will be):
        Charles Alexander (Chax Press, and Exec. Dir. of the MN Center
for Book Arts): Charles publishes and brings to MPLS-STPL mostly mid- or
advanced-career poets, writers and bookmakers. His primary (which
is not to say "only") "influence sphere" seems to be the language writers.
        Curt Anderson (_Exile_): Curt's interests are mostly classical; I
couldn't tell you what his contemporary "influence sphere(s)" might be.
        Erik Belgum (starting up a cassette label which will "publish"
sound/text pieces): Erik's "influence sphere" seems to be sound/text
artists, mostly Canadians, such as The Four Horsemen.
        Jonathan Brannen (Standing Stones Press): Jonathan's primary
"influence spheres" seem to be the "inland experimentalists" (U.S. &
Canadian) and "exploratory" fiction writers past & present.
        Marta Deike (Detour Press): Marta's primary "I.S." seems to be
innovative/feminist writers, such as Sarah Murphy, Kathy Acker, etc.
        Eliza Murphy (no vehicle): Eliza's "I.S." seems (based on reading
very little of her work) to be early American and British women
modernists, like Mina Loy.
        Mark Nowak (_furnitures_, North American Ideophonics): Mark's
primary "I.S." seems to be a combination of sound/text artists and poets
associated with ethno/spoken-poetics.
        Anthony Schlagel (no vehicle): Couldn't say what his "I.S." might
be, though I think it's mostly classical and international.
        Gary Sullivan (Detour Press): My primary "I.S" would be the NY
School and the unaffiliated/disenfranchised (Burns, Thorpe, Weiners).

There are others here, too. How do we all get together, despite our
different interests? Might not our getting together and discovering
common ground, as well as making discoveries through each other, be more
valuable to us ultimately than if we remain fully devoted to our own
special interests?

This, I think, is the crux of Spencer's argument. He seems to be
suggesting a dialog as opposed to a number of (admittedly interesting)
monologues. We're all interested in "open form" poetry, no? How about
"open community"? Is that possible? Ed Foster's _Talisman_ seems to me
one of the most successful attempts at creating, if not an "open
community," the next best thing, a fairly open magazine, "meeting place."

I'd like to see that happen here in Minnesota. Any ideas?

Yours,

Gary

Hear hear (or is it here, here?) to Bob Harrison's response to the recent slew
of postings. I don't exactly object to what Bob calls the Silliman-bashing,
but only because I'm not sure it's bashing--though I'm the one who can't read
tone, remember, so Ron, you might feel differently. Are you being bashed? What
I do object to is the sudden upsurge in the bullshit quotient. Can we at least
consider an "In-Jokes and General Cutesiness" sub-list, to accommodate the
folks who have all this free time on their hands to be anti-hegemonic or who
want to continue the apparently endless flavors-of-New-Zealand-ice-cream
thread?

Frankly I'm getting just about ready to check out and head on over to the New
Formalism list.

Subject:      in-jokes, flames

Susan, as someone who very much appreciates in-jokes, I hate to say this,
but I agree with you; at least, when confronted with a barrage (12, I
think) of them all at once. I thought the first "Ron" flame was funny,
the second less so, and I just began deleting the things without reading
'em by the 4th or 5th. As Gerald Burns once cautioned me (I quote from
memory): "You'll never learn anything until you realize that the quality
of light in a room is the same thing as the life of the mind, or the
soul." (He put it more eloquently than that.) As someone who reads &
writes a lot of satire, I've always been aware of the inherent paradox:
You may hit the object dead on, but the subject is always, ultimately,
you. In the best (most "effective") satire, your audience is almost
unaware of your presence, all attention being focused on the object. In
cases of overkill (like the recent 12-part "Ron" flames), you're not only
more aware of the author than you should be, you begin to sympathize with
the object(s) of his/her satirical/parodic communication.

I don't want people to cease posting satire & parody: it's a perfectly
valid (& sometimes efficient) means of getting across ideas & concerns.
But be careful not to alienate what audience you do have.

Thanks,

Gary

It appears that this list needs, not wants, a coherant amount of prattle.
That the theory/truth dichotomy is not a dichotomy at all, but a revolving
door that lets the social, the riff-raff in. It seems this need strikes at
the heart (a prattlish metaphor) of the hinge that lets in and issues out.
The thin membrane between theory and doctrine needs prattle in order to
decipher, or to clarify that oscillation between love and chattle,
acquaintance and stranger. I hate to appear to substantiate incoherent
subtrafuge because in fact what I wish to lend credence to is coherent
subtrafuge and applaud all those who relish (and undermine) the berm.

I thought I might offer that I once climbed three stories above the street
at Shattuck and University in Berkeley to "alter" a billboard above
McDonald's. The billboard was advertising an Egg McMuffin and the caption
was "Rise and Dine." After several Irish coffees at Brennan's (a local
wursthouse cum irish pub with vietnamese cooks) a co-conspirator and I
climbed the narrow ladder, he watched for cops and I spray painted "Wretch
and Die" to my delight and we scurried down. (This kind of think can get
you killed by vigilante's in LA.) It wasn't until a year or two later that
a publication on "altered billboards" and general mayhem in the Bay Area
came out that I realized that my double entendre was in fact a mis-spelling
- much like subtrafuge.

Strange, I am really glad to hear a bit of humour from time to time,
and really glad to read the fake newspaper stuff from, I think,
Albany. Before they showed up I was struck by the earnestness, the
humorlessness of most of the talk, the (pardon me) self-imp[ortance.
I was thinking: is this a U.S. characteristic of the poetry crowd

I want to endorse Sullivan's recent plea for openness, for dialogue
as opposed to monologs bashing each other. How many times have you
had to go to some "function" and talk with a poet whose work you have
always felt like denigrating, and found out that she was really fun
to talk with, maybe even shared some feelings about things? You dont
then have to like the person's poetryt, but you can still have
commerce with that person, and really, is that worthless, a person? I
really LIKE the Ny school poets, but that doesnt mean I am going to
bang monologue up against a LangPo guy who canyt stand, say, Ron
Padgett. Sorry if this sounds skewed: I have just come bacj from
reading at a Freedom To Read Week "function" with some "other" types
whom I enkoyed hearing.

I'm surprised at the criticism directed at the Silliman flames. Well, not
surprised. I agree that a lot of it is a waste of time to read, that a lot
of the humorous listings here are a waste of time, but that's why we have
delete mechanisms. But it also seems to me that this bullshit is a sign of
a healthy discussion group as well--a bit of useless material, and there's
a lot to be said about the usefulness of uselessness. Too, a lot of it
seems not only tongue in cheek, but a tongue in a tongue in cheek. And do
we kid ourselves that all of the "serious" material is really valuable? I
do agree that the jokes are growing tired, or rather, I'm growing tired of
them, even if they do show signs that poetry is alive, that it's being
taken out of "serious" discussions and being bandied about. Let this group
breath and stretch and scratch, produce overflow, useless, excretory
overflow.

Gary,

Any ideas for forming an "open community" here in Minnesota?  For a start,
you might discuss this idea with those people you list in your post.  They actually live in
Minnesota which seems relevant since you've chosen to define community as locale (not a
concept that I feel entirely at home with).  If you find this is too radical a notion, I'm sure
Charles (Hi, to all three Charles! on this list), Chris (Hi, Chris! all four of you), Sheila (Hi,
Sheila!), Spencer (Hi, Spencer!) and others (Hi, others! each of you, individuals that you are
with, I hope, varied life-styles) could all provide wonderful ideas for "open communities" in
Minnesota.  Why not have a contest?

Why not have everyone SEND PROPOSALS FOR ***OPEN COMMUNITIES IN
MINNESOTA*** TO GARY SULLIVAN, GPSJ@PRIMENET.COM!  Maybe, the winner
could be chosen randomly in a blind reading by the members of the Minnesota Project for
Contemporary Language Arts (Hi again, Gary! Hi, Marta! Hi, Curt! oops, you're not on-line
are you Curt?) and announced in a future issue of EXILE (Hi, Minnesota Project for
Contemporary Language Arts!).  How about a selection of miscellaneous e.g. Press chapbooks
as the prize?

I, too, admire what Ed Foster is doing with TALISMAN.  I attribute this to his editorial
intelligence and his willingness to be open to various poetries rather than being governed by one
narrow agenda of poetics.

I don't know what "inland experimentalists" are.  But if it's among my "influence spheres" then
it includes all the continents, not simply North America and it's not landlocked, though it's not
an imaginary coast.  I grew up on the coast of Florida, I understand the difference between
passing waves and solid ground.  As for Standing Stones Press, I publish chapbooks of work that
I like, both poetry and fiction.  The writers I've published live all over approach writing in
various ways.  They include Geof Huth, Sheila Murphy, Dennis Barone, Curt Anderson,
Stephen-Paul Martin, Michelle Murphy, Peter Ganick, Cydney Chadwick and John Perlman.
Titles by Gerald Burns and Tom Ahern are in the works.  I'll be posting a catalog to the list in
the near future.

Gary, I'm not sure which of Spencer's many well-stated arguments you're rallying in support

        Eliza Murphy (no vehicle): Eliza's "I.S." seems (based on reading
very little of her work) to be early American and British women
modernists, like Mina Loy.
        Mark Nowak (_furnitures_, North American Ideophonics): Mark's

associated with ethno/spoken-poetics.
        Anthony Schlagel (no vehicle): Couldn't say what his "I.S." might

This, I think, is the crux of Spencer's argument. He seems to be

Sorry I mangled the line breaks last time.  Hope this
post can be read.

Gary,

Any ideas for forming an "open community" here in
Minnesota?  For a start, ou might discuss this idea
with those people you list in your post.  They actually
live in Minnesota which seems relevant since you've
chosen to define community as locale (not a concept
that I feel entirely at home with).  If you find this
is too radical a notion, I'm sure Charles (Hi, to all
three Charles! on this list), Chris (Hi, Chris! all
four of you), Sheila (Hi, Sheila!), Spencer (Hi, Spencer!)
and others (Hi, others! each of you, individuals that
you are with, I hope, varied life-styles) could all
provide wonderful ideas for "open communities" in
Minnesota.  Why not have a contest?

Why not have everyone
SEND PROPOSALS FOR ***OPEN COMMUNITIES IN MINNESOTA***
TO GARY SULLIVAN, GPSJ@PRIMENET.COM!

Maybe, the winner could be chosen randomly in a blind
reading by the members of the Minnesota Project for
Contemporary Language Arts (Hi again, Gary! Hi, Marta!
Hi, Curt! oops, you're not on-line are you Curt?) and
announced in a future issue of EXILE (Hi, Minnesota
Project for Contemporary Language Arts!).  How about
a selection of miscellaneous e.g. Press chapbooks
as the prize?

I, too, admire what Ed Foster is doing with TALISMAN.
I attribute this to his editorial intelligence and
his willingness to be open to various poetries rather
than being governed by one narrow agenda of poetics.

I don't know what "inland experimentalists" are.  But if
it's among my "influence spheres" then it includes all
the continents, not simply North America and it's not
landlocked, though it's not an imaginary coast.  I grew
up on the coast of Florida, I understand the difference
between passing waves and solid ground.  As for
Standing Stones Press, I publish chapbooks of work that
I like, both poetry and fiction.  The writers I've published
live all over approach writing in various ways.  They include
Geof Huth, Sheila Murphy, Dennis Barone, Curt Anderson,
Stephen-Paul Martin, Michelle Murphy, Peter Ganick,
Cydney Chadwick and John Perlman.  Titles by Gerald Burns
and Tom Ahern are in the works.  I'll be posting a
catalog to the list in the near future.

Gary, I'm not sure which of Spencer's many
well-stated arguments you're rallying in
support of.  If it's his notion that poetry is an
art and that there is a discernable difference
between art and theory, I agree.  I also believe that
poems can be the manifestations of theory and that poems
can contain theories or anything else that finds its

I'd like to second the refrain that the messages are becoming an outlet
for a kind of agression that I don't really want to participate in. The
bleeri satires have a good resonance with the base line of discussion and
include themselves in poking fun. The current rash strikes me as mean
spirited although I agree with Alan again that it's not so much bashing
as a kind of misplaced homage. I hope you writers will...

I think Chris that the flames have a tendency to consume the firestarter. I
also think that you were attempting to prevent others from speaking in
the way they wanted to by "shouting" them down and in that way denied
them the right to speak how they wanted. There's a big difference between
asking someone to modify their approach and the agression of those
messages. If you are not happy with the way you yourself can address the
issues, I would suggest thinking about it and coming up with a coherent
response rather than with undifferentiated agression. I don't expect you
to agree, but I want to say it.

How is this different from the way you flamed Ron? It's more boring. It's
intention is clearer in that I am trying to get you to stop attacking
people and gaining control of everyone's e-mail list under the guise of
parody. And I am giving you the option. There are other valid
interpretations, but that is the way I felt reading those recent messages.

to all
several things:
1. re: Charles Alexander's
Getting back to what was a topic at the begining of the po/theor
discussion, which was about whether every poem had a theory within or
behind it, whether poems embodied theory in some way . . .

Curious that I put in one comment about what interested me most in theory and
Gary S. took that to mean something about my poetry. I discussed it with him
offline, but it seems that in many minds theor/po are
automatically/inextricably linked.  I don't consider my writing at all to be
poetry of personal experience, I have my methods which come from personal
experience but does that make the writing itself that method?
Not in my opinion. How does this fit into the discussion?

2. re Spencer's list of eight and the other's replies and reactions - again
curious how expressing valid concerns and problems is viewed as "negativity",
"frustration", etc. Egads if you aren't frustrated with the literary
community  you must be in serious denial, and if that constitutes negativity
then so be it! Running a reading series in S.F. has made it very clear to me
that no community exists here today, except as it serves the various spheres
of influence. It puts me in mind of James P.Carse's Finite and Infinite Games
- [The fluidity of our social and therefore personal existence is a function
of our essential freedom - the kind of freedom indicated in the formula "Who
must play, cannot play." Of course as we have seen, finite games cannot have
fluid boundaries, for if they do it will  be impossible to agree on
winners... It is this essential fluidity of our humaness that is
irreconcilable with the seriousness of finite play. It is, therefore this
fluidity that presents us with an unavoidable challenge: how to contain the
serious within the truly playful; that is how to keep all our finite games in
infinite play.]

Most important is to keep this list space fluid and free.

I've received a lot of backchannel queries about how I feel about the
Anti-Hegemony Project's "alt.fan.silliman" sequence (which by my count
stopped at around 25 messages).

I don't feel badly. I don't feel "flamed." And I don't particularly think
it was directed at me except in that "homage by ambivalence" sort of way.
I (or at least a fictive Ron Silliman) was usually the object of some
commentary that was being ascribed to somebody else on the list (tho I
think one or two "authors" might not be up on email yet). Since they were
the ones having phoney words put in their mouths, I suspect that they
might feel much more violated in that they were alleged to believe/say
things they might not have any sympathy towards whatsoever. How does Lew
Daly feel about being characterized in such a two-dimensional Elmer
Gantry stereotype? It seemed to me throughout that whatever "meanness"
existed in the sequence largely was involved in mangling those alleged
voices.

 All the quotes of my work were generally accurate and so were a few of
critiques. (Yeah, I do use the anecdotal as a lever in my critical pieces
and it's worth thinking about the consequences of that. I've been trashed
for close reading before (by Don Byrd among others), as if the practice
itself were politically incorrect (rather than the uses to which it once
was put a full generation ago). But no, Ketjak is not a character. The
comment on barfing in K was supposed to call up questions of gender,
sexual practice and power. Those lines are grounded in autobiography, but
that's not the point. I can't imagine having an R. Crumb cover. I loved
the dream and have in fact stolen from it for a piece in progress, thank
you very much. Most serious critique of all: not one comment about any of
my last 6 books. And anybody who wants a copy of The Difficulties should
just write to me backchannel. I think I have a few left.)

The day before it all started, a lurker (you know who you are)  wrote to
me that one reason she posts so little to the group is the sense she has
of active hostility on the part of particularly the younger participants
toward us old-fart G1 types. People seem ready to jump all over a press
like Sun & Moon while nobody trashes New Directions. I responded to her
at the time that this was because New Directions was irrelevant, and that
this kind of response seems to me precisely an index of anxiety that
people may feel about a given person &/or institution. It's ultimately a
definitional process. How do we differentiate ourselves from our "elders"
especially when we admire their work and can't quite say why or how we
ourselves are so unalterably *different*?

I told her that I thought we'd been just as bad in our 20s, although she
personally denies it. (I don't: I got to really know Robert Duncan first
when I wrote to the SF Chronicle in '66 saying that the bust of Lenore
Kandel's Love Book gave writers and the ACLU the chance to extend the
first amendment by arguing for the right to produce erotica that was not
great literature or socially redeeming. Duncan went onto KQED television
to read his open letter denouncing me. I was 19 at the time, an
undergraduate at SF State, and a fun time was had by all. That was also
the year I wrote to Pound telling him how he ought to conclude the
Cantos--with a photo of the Hong Kong harbor, ancient boats bobbing in
front of highrises in the smog-filled sky, carrying the poem's move to
the graphic to a logical conclusion. I also wrote to Zukofsky, trying to
get permission to publish The Objectivist Anthology & the Objectivist
issue of Poetry as single volume. I no doubt explained to him in some
very condescending fashion the importance of his own work.  He sent back
a very gracious note that's in the archives at UCSD:
"No//but//sincerely,//LZ." I think that the evidence is clear that I was
a total brat as a kid, but I only picked on poets who meant a lot to me.)

E-space merely changes the dynamics a little. It gives everybody on the
list equal access in a way that sitting around the feet of a
pontificating Duncan at a party never did. So it doesn't surprise me at
all to see a dynamic I can still remember/recognize showing up here at
all. It's no different from what the Apexers are trying to do in their
editorials, but that's really the only  other kind of venue young writers
have for such a social move.

Ideally, though, e-space might actually change the dynamics over time.
Maybe if all we simply acknowledge and presume the state of easy access
(and, with it, the recognition that everybody's watching), we won't feel
so intimidated by older writers who love to hear themselves talk. It
would be interesting to see what might happen if younger poets could
develop in a supportive setting and older ones wouldn't feel so
threatened by difference among the next generation. How do we get there?

It's actually the same question that Gary Sullivan and others have been
asking.

I do have one suggestion that I think would make for an improvement all
around. When people send out parodies (even mean ones), have the courage
to sign it or at least to send it from an email address that let's
everyone know just who you are. Believe me, we don't bite. I think that a
lot of the bad feelings I hear being expressed, both publically and
otherwise, have as much to do with the anonymity of the project as with
anything that has ever been said. It's much harder to be an object of
parody if you don't know where it's coming from.

Subject:      theory and poetry

Perhaps, if it's not too late in the game on this one, I'd like to
mention something that I didn't see addressed in the recent theory/poetry
debates. Rather than talk about theory vs. poetry at all, might not one
mention that FORM is crucial to the presentation of ideas, that it's not
simply a "what" but also a "how," and in that sense, every piece of
writing (theory/poetry/fiction, call it what you will) has a form that
opens up or represses possibilities in words. In fact I always thought
that this was one of the most interesting thing about the work of people
like james sherry, ron silliman, leslie scalapino, many others--that the
"what" (ideas?) was not alienated from the how (the form), but realized
in it...
        What, that is, are the implications of a form of writing in
determining its meaning? Using such a question, falling back on
distinctions between poetry and theory just may not be the point at all.

My apologies to Jonathan Brannen and others for being reductive. (You
were warned.)

Also to anyone who felt "left out" by virtue of my limiting myself to
people in my area. It was meant as an example. I'm genuinely interested
in reading about others' experiences, & thought that might prompt a few.

That post, Jonathan, being a response to Spencer's well-stated ideas about
the differences between "community" and "spheres of influence." If you
did indeed miss Spencer's post, I'm sure he'd be happy to forward.

Sorry if what I said sounded like "Say! Let's put on a play! We can use
Grampa Joe's bedsheets as a curtain! and me & Sally Mae can act, swell,
you bet!"

Pretty much everyone here, Jonathan, those I mentioned, & others, have
tried to bring everyone together on different occasions. Some attempts
have been more successful than others, but I've never felt what we have
here is a "community." I'm sure others elsewhere in the States, in Canada,
England, New Zealand, Australia, etc., have made similar attempts. I
thought it worth bringing up for that reason. My questions weren't
rhetorical. I'm sorry if they came across that way.

If nothing else, someone who runs a radio program e-mailed me for Erik
Belgum's address; so, Erik's got at least one more place to send his tapes.

And, yeah, Jonathan: You *should* tell us about your books. I'm sure your
authors will appreciate it. Not to mention anyone who'd like to order
them but can't w/out your address because SPD has denied you (& other new
presses of your size publishing mostly younger writers) access.

Anyway, your point about listening is well taken. I'll shut up & lurk for
a while.

Yours,

Gary

The question, Gary (hi!) would be, if you published a book, say, on
Coffee House Press, if I published a book on Holy Cow! Press, if Chax
Press won an NEA, would we enter the MONOLITH?  My concern is that
your call for an "open community" begins by stating, ab inition, an
"division".  Even the LOFT & its new competitor, SASE, have sponsored
events by the Nuyorican poets. etc.  I mean you know I'd be the first
to agree that what is here (& most other places I've lived) could
use a life-support system.
        One argument might be that what I've outlined above consists
of "multi-cultural writing" that seems to me to have had oh so little
space/discussion in this "radical" or "experimental" or "whatever"
community, & has been outlined by others as explicity NOT "language
writing."
        I don't know: Basil Johnston's tales are magnificent, Gerald
Vizenor (now in Berkeley) is incredible.  So much, in fact, of the
Ojibwe & Ho-Chunk & Lakota & other Native writers are on par with or
excel whoever else might be "out there".
        Perhaps it's a question of how "community" is defined, whether
our litmus test is the level of semantic experiment, the level of com-
pliance w/ French theory-praxis, or elsewhere.

Subject:      Down in flames?

        The mood on this list shifts like the tides.  Yesterday
a near-hysterical tension; today the calm of reason.  The hysteria I
detected was provoked by the most recent spate of AHP parodies, which
moved me to write--I wanted to scold those who scolded.  I wanted to
defend not AHP but satire itself: it was being badly misrepresented.
Thus--

        Contrary to Susan Schwartz _et.al._, satire needn't be cleanly
targeted to be effective as hell.  Clean contrary to one particular
poster (sorry, I forget who), the greatest satirists knew fully well
that they made fun of themselves right along with their supposed
targets--that's why Swift, e.g., is enduringly interesting.

        Come on, you guys.  As Chris Funkhouser (et.al.?) points out,
the primary purpose of those parodies was surely not to skewer Ron
Silliman.  (Granted, his spanking of the Apexers did generate some
considerable ill will around here . . .)  I thought it plainly evident
that the "real" target of *all* AHP's stuff is this medium we're trying
to learn how best to handle.  ("We"?  Is there one?  Not 'til "we" found,
forge, constitute an "us": an always-ongoing project.)  Their satires on
the forms and styles of electronic communication--wire-service reporting,
vapid b-board chat, listserv intellectualizing, our labyrinthine
redistribution of posts within posts within posts--ring dead-on true.
I'm impressed.  And I have to assume there's more than one person producing
this stuff; otherwise I'm put to shame, because, even though I divide my
workday the way most of you-all do--i.e. between real writing, reading,
scholarly writing, reading, teaching, and reading--I too would like to
have such time on my hands (see below).

        But I guess you had to be there.  My wife kept asking me what was
so funny (she was watching television two rooms away, to give you a picture
of how I react to AHP when it comes across my screen), and damned if I could
explain.

        Oh yes--let me introduce myself:  Shy, uxorious WM, 40-ish
poeticslistlurking gradstud (i.e. no steady job), seeking same or Other or
better for serious discussion *and* serious fun (which is why I'm staying

Mark,
I agree.  Dare I say that form and content are the same?

Perhaps this isn't appropriate for "poetics" discussion, but since I
write fiction as well, and in writing fiction I'm very fond of using
constrictive forms (somewhat re: Oulipo) precisely because it both
opens and represses possibilities for narrative constructs.  I tend
to avoid constrictive forms (no relation to new formalism which I
find unreadible) because they seem to limit possibilities, though
MacLow has produced some marvelous pieces this way.

Subject:      Phoney words

I didn't want to rush in with just another bucket
of water to toss on the "Ron Silliman" flaming. It
made me think of framing..

With this talk of flaming and hegemony, I wonder
if it's worth talking about the use of Names.

I'm not talking about the name as the practical
convenience or device that it is.

Of couse, in Japan, the last name comes first: your
setting, your kin/pattern, then the individual you. In
the west, the first name has far greater play. As a
person maybe finally I live by my first name.

Where'm I headed? As well as identification, names
carry privileges. Ron's (you know who) carries
privileges (and maybe notoriety too?!).
Lang-poets
seem still to associate their writings with their
names. The last time I asked to be published
(in NZ) without my name, I was refused.  In NZ up to the
60s a number of women writers would appear under
adopted names, sometimes men's.

It's this privileging of the name, as authentic,
integral, with authority, that POETICS goes some
way to abating. But it's the reason why so-called
younger generations of writers keep wanting to
move in on older (privileged) ones.  It's the same
game, huh. It's the power thing. Could be it's at
back of the gender-talk too. ANd the posts there
were concerning reading only Known (I think Marjorie
Perloff was involved) Names. It leans too much
on predisposition, supposition.

Because the name is taken to be such an integrated
circuit, something irrefragible(??), it's hard to
split up or share the renown it accrues.  We can have
it conferred on us (get someone Big to write in my
flyleaf), but it detracts nothing from the function
of Bigness, merely confirms it.  Same game.

What to do?  Allot ids? Swap names (or name-genders)
once in a while, have a lucky dip? have a name
amnesty for a week? Or maybe be allotted rankings
as to a name's current standing. Make teams?
Lousy solutions, I guess. But my point is
that this happens informally now too. On
my Mail List there is the sender's name and the
subject.  I find I'm as interested in the senders
name as the subject and am aware how this (is it
just me) predisposes my interest and to some
extent (is it just me?) my readerly anticipations.
I'm not convinced the pre-recognition
and pre-eminance associated with the formalized
use of proper names is so helpful. I don't
likw its use as a handlebar. I think texts
can have names and persons can have names but
why valorize one with the other. I'm unconvinced
its what best represents langpo and its poetics.

Of course, I'll leave my name anyway..

Whatever else might be said about Robert Bly, in the late 1960s and early
1970s in Minnesota it was his leadership that generated a poetry
community that understood itself to be exactly that, and poetry readings
and activities as means of building community.  As, for example, we would
have readings with multiple folks at a time -- with poets choosing to
read poems one after another in a conversation mode -- one poet would
start, someone would choose a poem in response to the first, and so on.
Or the publishing collective in which each group of 10 in the collective
chose the next 10 and then went on their way, so that the decision-makers
themselves were constantly changing...

Let me correct a typo in Even Shiva, the "fran" should read "frank."

I like your reply to the "flamers" although I think its over generous,
but that is a quality that we value in you. I do disagree on one point
though. I don't think it's up to the younger generation to create a
supportive environment, it's up to the older generation to create a
supportive environment, you know. These messages are testing the limits
of what can be said and in that they are valuable. If they go beyond the
limit of what others find acceptable, they need to be told, but the
support must come from those with the surplus to distribute.

also in minnesota (well, duluth) is Poetry Harbor, which published
_days of obsidian, days of grace: 4 native american writers_, as well
as Poetry Motel magazine, which certainly has no connection w/
French theory-praxis or langpo or whatever... but multiculti, & so not
missing frm yr list on that ground...

i'd guess no matter how much you/we try to enlarge our "community",
there'll still be "outsiders": folks whom you/we feel you/we have
little in common with.  & i'm not saying that's a bad thing, but
something we have to own up to, and not just ascribe to some "other"
(sorry for the ungainly you/we construction here; i wrote it out
w/ just "you" & then caught myself...)

so i'm echoing yr question & qualm, 'bout how we identify (w/) thee
MONOLITH...  and to suggest "communities" emphasis on the plural--
as a self-perception & antidote to the single-partyline-poetic that
seems to me at root of much of the in-fighting we've seen so much ov

Subject:      other side

I've already erased two responses to Auntie Hedge Enemy, but will make this
my statement of record: It seems to me they're only interested in talking to
people who get their jokes.  I missed most of them myself.  And I'm from
Buffalo, four years removed--I can only imagine the bewilderment of an
Australian (though on second thought rural Wisconsin actually doesn't seem
that much closer).  In any case, it's hard for me to buy the argument "This
isn't inane, it's just representing inanity."

As someone not in the loop, but trying to follow these conversations anyway
(I'm a fiction writer but rather bored with what's been going on in the
experimental vein there lately -- is it possible that Robert Coover is hot
again? -- finding recent poetry more eye-popping), I wonder, am I allowed to
ask a question, or do I have to study long and hard to acquire the
shibboleths first?

I do have a question.  I saw Hank Lazer give a paper at Louisville which was
down on a couple recent anthologies, including the new Messerli edited
Sun&Moon, _From the Other Side of the Century_, which strikes me as a fairly
good one (again I say from outside, but interested).   Lo, when I arrived
home, I'd been sent the book from my sister-in-law as a late birthday
present, a happy coincidence.  Looking at it, I take Lazer's point about the
structure, that is, that the four groupings (in shorthand:
"culture"/"self&society" (NYschool)/"language"/ "performance") are at least
as problematic as they are elucidating.  But I was more taken aback by what
it seems to me are a couple of striking omissions.  Ed Dorn, it seems to me,
should certainly be included in any selection of recent poets in an
innovative tradition concerned with (Messerli's explanation of section 1)
"cultural issues and a complex of overlapping ideas about myth, politics,
history, place, and religion"--I mean, that sounds like a DESCRIPTION of
Dorn's work.  And also Kenneth Koch, who strikes me as an integral part of
the NY school.  I saw him and Ron Padgett read at Woodland Pattern in
Milwaukee last year.  Koch was the headliner, Padgett seemed implicitly to
acknowledge this; Koch read the more challenging works (to my idea of
things), yet Padgett is in this anthology and Koch isn't.

Now I only got onto this list in November, and it seems likely that this
issue was visited some time in the past when I didn't, as they used to say
with CBs, have my ears on.  I have a sensitivity to not tying up the space;
but then I think, shit, my screens have been clogged with fuck-all for
weeks!!! (especially post-Louisville; I'm sure Steve Evans, Alan Golding, Bob
Perelman and others who were there have also been very much occupied with
simply getting through all the stuff that accumulated last weekend when we
were otherwise engaged)  Besides, it's like when you run into people who are
just now seeing Pulp Fiction for the first time: I don't mind if you say
"we've already had this conversation".  I'd just like someone to summarize it
for me.

And, yes, anthologies are always a problem.  But _The New American Poetry_
did reasonably important things it seems to me.  This one is self-consciously
coming in its footsteps.  There are differences of opinion, I'm sure, about
both Dorn & Koch, who it strikes me now similarly structure much of their
verse around satire, for instance.  Ron Silliman (never having seen him, I
picture him now with singed eyebrows) spoke a couple weeks ago about the NY
school and how for him, for better or worse but undeniably, Koch figured
prominently.  And if you're going to leave someone out, shouldn't you at
least say why (maybe Messerli has in a place I haven't yet looked).  Donald
Allen was explicit about why T.S. Eliot was left out of _Poetics of the New
American Poetry_ in his introduction to that work.

The formulation that form is content, or vice versa, is helpful if only
to refute the all too common idea that form is a box that somehow contains
any given content. A kind of transcendental, naturalized content, which
everyone knows, is common sense, contained in an arbitrary, imposed form.
This kind of simple opposition I don't find too helpful.
     But saying simply that form *is* content, or content *is* form, is,
I think a little too easy. It collapses what I think are real distinctions
between the two. If nothing else it isn't true to what I think is the real
struggle, the real battle, to fit what you are trying to say into how
you're trying to say it.
     And maybe this is the most helpful way of seeing the form/content
split that I know: as the record of a struggle. As form mediated by content
and content mediated by form. At least, I may add, on the level of composition;
as you try to write it. It may be easier, maybe neccessary, to say that there
is no difference on the level of reading; in other words, once you see
something in some form, it is impossible to imagine it in any other. But
on the level of writing, I find it more helpful to think of it dialectically.
     My two cents, Eric.

Frankly, Ron as someone spoofed, I was pretty flattered. I thought the
LSUE. quite clever, but the POPE? Heard worse things about my name
in elementary school.
    But if the implication is that the poetics list acts as a fan club
for you, or at least the name SILLIMAN, then I don't agree. Actually,
I'm more of a Penn Warren fan myself. That hanged woman scene in
Audobon always gives me a stiffy.

    I'd like to respond in an odd way to both Gary and Spencer's posts,ie,
to both the idea of community and spheres of influence. I'd like to respond
with the absolutely asinine question of what is poetry?
    I think the answer to that question, a question incidentally, that my
students ask me all the time, is that poetry is what poets say it is. But
that don't mean that anyone can say I believe poetry is a series of regular
belches in a dark room and be taken seriously. That is, not at least until
she/he comes up with a good reason why belches in a dark room are poetry, ie,
a theory of poetry that is comprehensive enough to be taken seriously.
     To switch to science: when Copernicus came up with his theory of the
solar system, what made it ultimately more compelling than the Ptolemaic
theory was that it accounted for more variables. In this way, then, I think
a given theory of poetry, and everyone begins to write a poem with a given
theory of poetry, must compete with earlier theorizations on this level, ie,
to take into account the gaps in our articulation of poetry and account for
them. That's what I think NY school did, and the l-school. That's where
the new group has to come in. Look for where the dominant strain can't
account, and  do so.
     This is, by the way, what ultimately made me switch from mainstream
AWP poetry, to experimental/avant garde/oppositional poetry: that the
notion of what poetry is is always questioned. Something, I think, we see on
this list all the time and is I think the most important contribution of it.
     Finally, Gary, please don't lurk. I've found your voice very helpful,
as well as Susan's and Jonathan's and others, if, for nothing else, we are
so far out of the loop.

Not down on the anthologies but critical of them, i.e., including
praise and negative remarks.  The paper I read in Louisville is about
half of an extended essay/review which will appear in Contemporary
Literature in the Summer issue.  The three anthologies I discuss are
Lauter's (2nd ed.) Heath anthology of American Lit, Messerli's, and
Hoover's.  And my particular slant has to do mainly with issues of
pedagogy--the use of anthologies in the classroom & the limitations
of these particular anthologies.  I also, especially on Lauter,
consider multiculturalism and its relationship to aesthetic
diversity.  As for Messerli's anthology, I used it as a core textbook
in my Fall 94 course.  It IS a rich collection, but....

I just wanted to say that I found the spoof silliman lists absolutely
hilarious, that, as Elizabeth Burns says in the Dec 94 issue of Poetic
Briefs, one feels unwelcome thus silenced as a younger poet putting
forward reasoned radical critique of the older generation right now, so
all power to the anon AHP; and, above all, that the spoof as a total
brilliantly conveyed the feel of being a lurker on a list of people
*fascinated* by something you yourself don't love in that detail, as is
evidenced in a lot of responses to it. What I loved most of all about the
spoof was that it didn't do this last effect stupidly; it didn't offer
people saying nothing of interest at great length, but made some very
informed points about what they (and I) love about the good parts of
Ron Silliman's work, and worry over in the porn of it. A point is; you
probably wouldn't get this amount of spoof on a lot of the Language
Writers, because few of them maintain such a lasting impact on younger
readers, certainly myself, as Silliman. Above all, I want to say: the
spoof showed me, at least, what a very intelligent list on a very
interesting poet or poets (ie both alt.fan.silliman, *and* POETICS, this
list we're now "on") looks like to outsiders. I don't myself feel "outside"
nearly as much as I'd like to from an exciting margin. It makes me feel.

Not sure that I entirely agree with precisely *what* you said, but the

Wow.

The single most fascinating thing about this list continues to be this
list, i.e. the way it morphs, mutates, grows etc.  Reminds me a little
of those computer games like SimCity or Civilization where your decisions
have to be made as your simulated police grows--when do you invent writing
and when do you just build more barracks etc etc  Only the analogy
immediately breaks down because in those "god games" one person makes
all the rules, while this Hydra-headed list is always dispersed, always
resisting the imposition of order even as "order" and self-ordering
necessarily become subjects of discussion.  I'm feeling inclined to
celebrate the flux and chaos, the giddy sensation of sliding out of
control, and i think the AHP stuff has been sort of exhilarating even
when it has been tiresome too.  And as someone else said, the best thing
about it has been it's canny and self-self-reflexive exploration of the
medium itself and all the different shifting, floating discourses of
cyberspace.  Of course, i can say all this from the safe standpoint of not
having been the object of satire, and i can understand why others might
feel assaulted.  But as i say, i'm inclined these days to celebrate the
mess and muck, especially as an order just came down from the Dean of Arts
and Sciences that no university facilities, including computer networks,
are to be used for political activity (he was responding directly to
an attempt to e-organize a protest against the Contract w/ America).  Now,
i can understand how some rules need to be sorted out for the medium--
i mean i wldn't want my mailbox to be deluged with the propaganda of my
political enemies.  But i find myself experiencing a certain fear of what
is to come and a sort of nostalgia for what hasn't quite passed.  As
big-business encroaches from one direction (e.g. Bill Gates about to
launch his own MicroSoft net) and govt. from the other what lies in store?
Will the chaos continue to roil and billow or will these/this be
remembered as the wild frontier days and daze that subsided beneath
the inevitable wave of tract housing and shopping malls (cf. America
On-Line, Prodigy, Compuserve etc etc

NOTE BENE: Two actions have been taken to legalize State repression of
the kind of work we are doing, i.e., using cyberspace to mobilize support
for resistance to Mexican government repression of those struggling for
democracy. The rubric under which these actions are being taken is
"counterterrorism" --a ploy which has been in use for almost 20 years
now. Please note that Clinton's executive order (2nd document
below) was signed on February 9, 1995, the same day Zedillo
ordered the military against the Zapatistas. Believe it or not absolutely
peaceful forms of resistance can be repressed using these means. PLEASE READ

Subject: New FBI Charter to Investigate Political Groups
Date: 2 Mar 1995 17:58:41 GMT

The following was posted on Peacenet and should be of paramount concern
to all activists - it looks like action needs to be taken on this bill
quickly.  Apologies if this has already been posted here.  Please forward
near and wide.


                 Omnibus Counterterrorism Bill
                   S. 390 and H.R. 896

     New FBI Charter to Investigate Political Groups

February 10, 1995 the Omnibus Counterterrorism Bill was introduced
as S. 390 into the Senate and as H.R. 896 in the House.  It was
initiated by the FBI, and passed on by the Justice Department and
the White House.  Senators Biden (D-DE) and Specter (R- PA)
initiated it in the Senate, Rep. Schumer (D-NY) and Dicks (D-WA)
in the House.  It has bipartisan support and could get expedited
action.

SUMMARY
*  THIS IS A GENERAL CHARTER FOR THE FBI AND OTHER AGENCIES,
INCLUDING THE MILITARY, TO INVESTIGATE POLITICAL GROUPS AND
CAUSES AT WILL.  The bill is a wide-ranging federalization of
different kinds of actions applying to both citizens and
non-citizens.  The range includes acts of violence (attempts,
threats and conspiracies) as well as giving funds for
humanitarian, legal activity.

*  It would allow up to 10 year sentences for citizens and
deportation for permanent resident non-citizens for the "crime" of
supporting the lawful activities of an organization the President
declares to be "terrorist", as the African National Congress, FMLN
in El Salvador, IRA in Northern Ireland, and PLO have been
labelled.  It broadens the definition of terrorism.  The
President's determination of who is a terrorist is unappealable,
and specifically can include groups regardless of any legitimate
activity they might pursue.

*  It authorizes secret trials fo
r immigrants who are not charged
with a crime but rather who are accused of supporting lawful
activity by organizations which have also been accused of
committing illegal acts.  Immigrants could be deported: 1) using
evidence they or their lawyers would never see, 2) in secret
proceedings 3) with one sided appeals 4) using illegally obtained
evidence.

*  It suspends posse comitatus - allowing the use of the military
to aid the police regardless of other laws.

*  It reverses the presumption of innocence - the accused is
presumed ineligible for bail and can be detained until trial.

* It loosens the rules for wiretaps.  It would prohibit probation
as a punishment under the act - even for minor nonviolent
offenses.

IMPLICATIONS
*  Those who remember the McCarran Walter Act will recognize this
bill, only in some ways this is broader and potentially more
dangerous

*  This bill is highly political:  the President can determine who
is a terrorist and change his/her mind at will and even for
economic reasons.  The breadth of its coverage would make it
impossible for the government to prosecute all assistance to
groups around the world that have made or threatened to commit
violent acts of any sort.  Necessarily its choices would be
targeted at organizations the government found currently
offensive.  People to be deported would be chosen specifically
because of their political associations and beliefs.

* The new federal crime:  international terrorism doesn't cover
anything that is not already a crime.  As the Center for National
Security Studies notes: "Since the new offense does not cover
anything that is not already a crime, the main purpose of the
proposal seems to be to avoid certain constitutional and statutory
protections that would otherwise apply."

*  While many provisions of this bill could well be found
unconstitutional after years of litigation, in the mean time the
damage could be enormous to the First Amendment and other
constitutional rights including presumption of innocence and right
to bail.

THE BILL HAS BEEN REFERRED TO JUDICIARY COMMITTEES OF EACH HOUSE.
ONLY THE NEW YORK TIMES HAS AS YET NOTICED THE BILL - A 2/24/95

Subject:      The List Itself

The List Itself

1.  I appreciate discussions of the format of this discussion
group, since many of the subscribers to Poetics receive the posts
in different personal circumstance (at home, at the office); with
different automatic formatting (headings, directories); and with
different software (facilitating up and downloading, or making it
impossible).  Insofar as possible, I would hope the list might be
able to conform to the specific needs of the participants.  But I
have limited knowledge of the listserve program that determines
some of the choices available.

2.  Please note that if your e-mail server is down, or if your
personal mailbox is full, and a Poetics message gets bounced, you
will be automatically unsubscribed from the Poetics listserve.
When your system comes back on line or you have cleared your back
messages, just subscribe anew.  It should be easy enough to tell
if you subscription has been "auto-deleted": a day will pass with
no Poetics posts!

3.  The DIGEST option is working and that is clearly useful for
those who want all the Poetics messages from one day sent as one
single e-mail post, or for those whose systems set limits on
individual messages.  (To get DIGEST, send a one-line message
with no subject line to listserv@ubvm.cc.buffalo.edu: set poetics
digest; to remove digest send a message that says: set poetics
mail.)
     I have no control over the format of the DIGEST: the
listserve program generates the daily digests automatically.  If
you use the reply option to respond to a message sent in the
Digest, the subject line will be the Digest subject head; if
possible, send such a message direct to Poetics so that you can
write the subject line yourself.

4.  To some extent, the Digest option resolves the problem for
those for whom the volume of messages is difficult to handle.  My
commitment is to keep this space open and unregulated -- indeed,
I suspect it is the unregulated aspect of the listserve format
that is particularly appealing for a list like Poetics.  There
are no circumstances under which I would consider formally
"moderating" this list; though this is an option for other lists
because the listserve program makes it possible for messages to
be sent to the listowner _before_ they are distributed.  In any
case, rest anxious, "moderation" has never been considered here
at Poetics@UBVM!

5.  I am interested in continuing to explore what formats and
styles of posting encourage, rather than simply allow,
participation in this "virtual uncommunity".  The volume of
messages is certainly a useful measure of list activity; but
volume itself may be an obstacle for some to participate, just as
it may encourage others.  Who subscribes is a crucial element:
both subscriptions and posting on Poetics are unrestricted, which
allows participants to subscribe and unsubscribe themselves at
will.  When people send me inquiries about the list, I send them
the "welcome" message and, generally, ask them to subscribe
themselves.  The list remains "private", which means that our
address will not be found in Guides to the Internet; word-of-
mouth (or word-of-net?) seems a better way of including
individuals who have a commitment to our multiple areas of
investigation.  I believe that without some sense of limit,
albeit constructed in process, the always fragile sense of
intimacy or relatedness that fosters some forms of conversation
can easily be lost.  But then again, maybe I am resisting the
sheer magnitude of the net, as if an imaginary seawall can ever
hold back the sea?  In any case, different lists and bulletin
boards and newsgroups will approach the limits of participation
in different ways; no one list can possibly embody all the
possibilities.  Even as it gets bigger, I still think of this
list as "small-scale".

6.  As listowner, I spend a certain amount of time dealing with
list maintenance.  That remains my primary commitment here, even
when it prevents me, given drastically limited time, from
participating in other ways.  There are many posts that I would
like to respond to, but to which I am only able to compose
responses in my head.  I suspect this is true many participants,
for several different reasons.  I am particularly conscious of
this when someone notes a lack of response to their post: I want
to call out that it wasn't lack of interest but lack of time!;
and I know this is a common feeling.

7.  I think of the listserve as a distinct medium, but what
characterizes this medium?  My question is partly, what does this
medium make possible that is not possible in other language
media?  Cris Cheek and Kali Tal have both offered elucidating
descriptions of the medium as improvisatory and I suspect that
their thoughts on the matter come close to answering my
questions.  But just as TV was filled with content from older
media, such as movies, so listserves will also be filled with
older genres: letters, essays, catalogs, etc.  I have found it
difficult to leap into the specifically listserve space, and my
own contributions, like a number of others, have tended to be
composed offline and over fairly long periods of time.  I hope
that those like me who are still squeamish about the immediacy of
this space will participate in less immediate, but no less
performative or theatrical, modes: for a theatrical space like
this can also be used in refractory and constructed manners.

******8.  Amidst the discussion, I want to reiterate the value of
information postings by presses and magazines.  Full catalogs of
small press publishers are always welcome and will be separately
listed at the Electronic Poetry Center site.  Please also send
notices of new books or magazine issues!  Individuals are also
encouraged to send information on their own new books or other
publications.  Recommended reading, with ordering information, is
also welcome.  ************************

9.  The Poetics list was started in January 1994.  Since then
there have been over 1600 posts.  As of today, there are 192 subscribers
to Poetics.
     I thought some of you might like to see a copy of a post I
made one year ago.  It's called "Hermits Crabs Don't Cry."  I
will send it as a separate post following this.

HERMIT CRABS DON'T CRY

On one of my frequent trips to the Folded Place
inside the Ethernet's Thirteenth Passage,
with the new translation into Idiophone
of Moses Maimonides's Guide for the Perplexed
in my left hand, I had occasion to jot
down some rules of conduct (not so much
community standards as uncommunity striations)
into my Blake's Newton Feelpad (TM pending)
(a pad is  after all a kind of home,
or used to be).  The Feelpad, as many
of you will know (and I use the word "you"
carelessly), is able to convert inner feeling
processes into linguistic signs.  The
protocols of the Blake's Newton Feelpad
do not allow me to review the file before
downloading directly onto your screens
(and I also use the word "your" carelessly):

All of these proposed Listserve Rules
will be enforced through a fully automated
new version of the Youngman Listserve Program
(Henney 33.95).  As I am sure you will agree
(and I use "you" loosely), Total Automation
of rule enforcement is the only way to ensure
fair and impartial Rule Maintenance:

1.  Postings on Poetics@UBVM shall be
neither in prose or verse. Rather,
all postings shall conform to shifting
character/line formats, announced
periodically on the list.  Initially,
lines shall have at least 43 and no more
than 51 characters; hyphenation is
discouraged.

2. No messages shall be posted between
:43 and :52 minutes after the hour.

3.  All postings shall be made from
"Dos"-type platforms; Apple users
may post from "IBM"-type computers
but the graphic orientation of
Macs make these environments
inappropriate for Poetics postings.

4. You have to sound 30 or show ID.

5. On the third Friday of every month, only short
"chat" messages to friends on the list may be posted.
For those without, or who no longer have, friends
on the list, a message service will be available
to provide names of friends as well as appropriate
messages.

6. The Listowner will provide a name
purging service to permit anonymous
postings.  Purged names will remain
strictly confidential, although, at
the Listowner's discretion, they may be
sold, on condition of continued
confidentiality, to benefit the outreach
services at Poetics@UBVM provided
by Whitewater Development Company.

7. Subscribers to Poetics@UBVM agree to
end all "back channel" communication.  All
communication among subscribers shall be
sent to the list as a whole: no individual
e-mail or conventional mail may be
exchanged, no face-to-face verbal
communications will be permitted
(nonverbal communication is in no
way restricted by this rule).
At first, this may be difficult
for those who live in the same area.
But, over time, the enormous advantages
to community-building will become
apparent.

8.  In order to cut down on those repulsive
smile icons that are used on Other Lists
to indicate humorous intent (as we used
to say in Method Acting class -- DON'T
INDICATE) [Remember the one about the actor who
asked the director what his motivation was to
walk across the set and light a cigarette, to
which the director replied, "your motivation is,
that if you don't, you'll be fired"?] --
where was I? even when I write I lose track
of where I am -- oh yeah,
in order to cut down on those smile icons,
and for other reasons that should be
obvious to all of you (I use the word
"you" inadvisedly), all irony
(including sarcasm, schtick,
mocking, jokes, and comic innuendo)
will be prohibited from the list.
This is a particularly difficult rule
to enforce automatically, but recent,
unpublishable, research, indicates
that there may be genetic markers of
sarcasm and our team of crack(ed?) computer
experts are working around the clock
to find programs to detect this "irony
gene" in linguistic expression.


>FINALLY<
For those who have asked that this
listspace move toward *reality* rather than
float in talky virtuality, the following rule
implementation procedure will be adopted:

If there is significant sentiment on the
list in favor of these rules, they will
not be adopted; if, in contrast, there
is strong opposition to these rules,
they will become effective immediately.

In addition, to bring even more reality
into the system, between three and five
Listserve Rules will remain concealed
from all subscribers AND about one percent
of all messages will be randomly deleted
before delivery.

I would be interested to know (lurking taken to a deeper level?) what kinds
of things various people on this list think about relative to form (or not)
when you are in the "thinking about" stage of creating a text.  Or, when you
are making something, at what point form entered the picture.  I guess I'm
asking for some seminarish exploration with you, your work (whoever you are
out there) as the subject.  This is just an open question, not a "guess what
I'm thinking" game of any kind.  It would seem there are multiple
possibilities.  As with so many things, there are seemingly infinite ways to
do this right.  But that's not the point anyway.

Eager to hear.

Almost all my current writing is completed on the Internet, published and
distributed on the Internet; hard-copy, magazines, etc. are secondary. So
I am aware always of the form of email itself - the reading environment,
the nature of the headers, the attention-span of readers, and in
particular, the very _appearance_ of ascii text and its "scroll." (I tend
to write about "scroll" itself as a form of vision, envisioning. So for
me, the text exists in a mobile field, a field of movement, and I have
seen film-scripts on the Net that in fact take advantage of this.

Beyond that, there is a sense of ransacking traditional literature and
its values, in a manner consistent with my notions of dissolution. And
there is always a sense that my work is archived at a web site and
elsewhere, and how the individual components string together.

Finally, I've learned enough about the TCP/IP protocols to understand
_how_ transmission occurs, what battles are being fought in the protocol
suite itself, and among its designers. And that affects the surface
content as well.

Subject:      COMMUNITY/LURKING

Gary, I hope that you DON'T shut up.  Keep those posts coming.  You
contribute to the vibrancy of the list.

I am interested in several people's comments about community.  I think that
I've found in the postal system for many years a vehicle for community.  Or
of creating intimacies (several micro-communities).  I know a number of
writers in Arizona and care very much for a number of friends in what might
be called a community.  But the way I've always functioned is to commune a
bit more directly on paper or one-on-one in the mails with certain people in
the writing world (whatever one would call it) than I do face-to-face with
people who are geographically near.  And both kinds of relating are wonderful
in their way.  Now, with the net (funny word; in addition to conjuring up
webbed-ness, it seems to suggest catching, as in fish or butterflies),
there's a different way (some might say better, but certainly quicker,
whatever your position on that point) to commune.

Maybe one of the things I'm leading to or discovering as I tap is that
community can't be pushed, although a number of things are catalytic to
creating it.  For example, projects.  Projects are the most  wonderful
catalysts.  Certain people function that way, too.  But, again, it sort of
happens.

I don't quite know what to make of the discussion about Minnesota, so I'm not
sure I would ever presume to be of direct help.  Mostly, the message might
be, though, that certain (sequences of) projects will shape into the
community they desire (even if ad hoc) very quickly.  Projects that people
care about deeply.  Once again, not unlike the world of earnings.

In Phoenix, we are known for not having a very strong poetry community, but
we surely have a number of poets.  And a number of people know one another
very well.  Personally, I'm quite satisfied with what we have, as I sort of
like having the freedom to work on my own, but then to have a positive spirit
among a number of people whom I've known and cared about for years.  I guess
that some definitions are necessarily quite demanding, even unrealistic.

Enough for one sitting.

Subject:      Re: Form As Discussion Point

   At the risk of being accused of being "wishy washy" (or "worse,"
   "Derridean,") I begin in what may seem like a "middle" (of undifferentiated
    nothingness) in response to Sheila Murphy's thought provoking "open
    question" of the "'thinking about' stage of creating a text...
    (and the idea that..."the seeming inifinite ways to do THIS right"
    is "not the point." The question of what one considers "better" writing,
    "publishable" is related to the question of "getting lost in the writing"
     and the question of being suprised by one's "own" writing, of trying
    to avoid paralyzing self-consciousness, of the desire "to get all of
    life in the text" and keeping attentive and not getting carried away
    on romantic pipedreams that may be the kind of distractions that are
    necessary for the piece of writing to seem to "take off" as it were
    (though there must be a pre-airplane way of saying that)...and the
    question of POLITICAL RESPONSIBILITY in the writing act, of editing out
    the POLITICALLY IRRESPONSIBLE points, as if you in "recollections of
    tranquility" you actually know what is politically responsible...
    and the question of various discourses, of the text explaining itself,
    of the THEME AS THE THING, and the whole socio-historical allegory of
    text circulation as if composition is explanation...Not all of these
    things always matter, but the question of "theory" and "practice" can
    be expressed "poetically" as easily as "theoretically" and so evey
    every debate is also a "meta-debate" and maybe is only a meta-debate
    in an anti-essentialist world in which "having bodyguards but no bodies"
    (Perelman) is an attractive metaphor, just like Shakespeare's "putrified
    core"--Anyway, this ties in with ALAN SONDHEIM'S assertion that there
    is IN HIS WORK "a sense of ransacking traditional literature and values,
    in a manner consistant with (his) notion of dissocation"--But what ARE
    these "traditional literatures and values"? The WESTERN CANON is not
    set in stone as purely aestheticized...What I thought I once wanted
    to subvert is not necessarily "traditional literature" but "traditional
    criticism" that has lent "respectibility" and aesthetical-object status
    to certain writings by misreading it in such a way as to make one want
    to turn to the "avant-garde" (studd not taught in schools, the whole
    "auto-didact" cult from which I learned much---correction "studd" is
    "stuff"), to make one want to turn to a mere inversion of "traditional"
    values, an inversion that is no better than the so-called "tradition"--
    In fact, one could say the "tradition" NEEDS THE ANTI-TRADITIONAL to
    prop itself up...and this binary view of culture is only interesting
    as a starting point one may return to again and again on the level of
    seeming, though of course you'll be accused of being some mere spinning
    your wheels ORC-CYCLE maya/karma being by those who seem to stand
    so completely in some "desolation row" of visionary rhetoric they
    put all their emotions in the PAST--this, too, is an interesting
    "rhetorical strategy" and may reach a point in which it becomes more,
    or at least OTHER, than a "rhetorical strategy"--but whether or not
    this POINT is THE POINT OF NO RETURN is a question i leave to anyone
    who wishes to take it up...Chris Stroffolino

Briefly to Mark, Sheila, Gary, Charles, Kali, Eric and others re Community
and Spheres of Influence.

This is a community in formational flux.
What's workable is who's here now rather than necessarily who those people
who are here presently reference.
This community will or rather might inconsiderately replicate its existing
character preferences unless its behaviour positively embraces both its own
and others diversity.
Learning ways to be welcoming  -  to find the touch that's otherwise too
carefully thought out from this e-space, bristled and defensive.
It's they who fear who feel the need to attack. Challenge is not
necessarily struggle. Struggle can too easily become binary dogma.
What's present can all too easily become resent.

Our (unpack baggage) behaviour (unpack baggage) or tone can (what is a tone
can?) too easily (unpack baggage) disperse (unpack baggage) or repel
(unpack baggage) that community (unpack baggage) which we (unpack baggage)
imagine (unpack baggage) we (deconstruct unpacked baggage) could (post to
Utopia) be (and tell Zeno it explains everything and so tells us nothing
(unpack baggage)).

Subject:      CALL: Sound and Language RE: - Submissions

I'm editing (and got the money to do) a series
of 5 books (each about 70pp and featuring between
3 - 6 writers) which are going to be
produced by Sound & Language from May/June this year.

The issue is to cast the most provocative net into:

-   writing either made for performance
-   or developed / constructed through performance
-   or directly related to performance

Some notes and photographic documentation (b/w I'm afraid)
will be included.
Get in touch direct with me if you've got something that
might open that net.
To give some idea I'm already on the case (and have some
work) by some of the following with more coming:

Carla Harryman, Jean Binta Breeze, Aaron Williamson, Fiona
Templeton, Gary Stevens, Forced Entertainment, Brian Catling,
Steve Benson, Caroline Bergval, Deborah Levy, Fiona Wright
Nancy O'Reilly, Charles Stein, Jackson MacLow, Guillermo Gomez Pena
David Antin and many others

I'd welcome any leads if it's not your own particular.

I'm keen to present work from across art-forms and so by artists
making challenging writing but who aren't primarily known
as writers.
Multi-voice texts - dark-side monologues - documentation of
improvisation / compositions - texts from videos / installations
'performance poems' - photographic poems  -  explorations of
the book as a site (for performance)

It's taking shape now and over the coming months.
Issues 1 and 2 will be available by mid-summer.
The whole project is hoped to be over within 18 months
and there's a potential development into (groan) anthology
or just collecting it all into a pleated reprint.

Please get in touch with any suggestions / submissions / questions,

and Please pass this on if appropriate

best wishes

Cris, your well-stated post re: community dragged me out of lurkdom to
respond.

>This is a community in formational flux.
     Definitely.

>What's workable is who's here now rather than necessarily who those
people who are here presently reference.
     I exist by virtue of my mother and father; therefore, my existence
     references them. To deny their existence is to deny my own.

>This community will or rather might inconsiderately replicate its existing
character preferences unless its behavior positively embraces both its own
and others['] diversity.
     Agree.

>Learning ways to be welcoming - to find the touch that's otherwise too
carefully thought out from this e-space, bristled and defensive.
     Agree, though time and thought unbristle, too.

>It's they who fear who feel the need to attack.
     Not always. Fear stifles more than it incites. Attackers are
     more often angry than fearful. & some anger is justified.

>Challenge is not necessarily struggle.
     Not until it's resisted.

>Struggle can too easily become binary dogma.
     A single, unchallenged dogma can just as easily become fascism.

>What's present can all too easily become resent.
     Resentment is a response to lack, as well as surfeit. What's not
     present might just as easily foster resentment.

>Our (unpack baggage) behaviour (unpack baggage) or tone can (what is a
tone can?) too easily (unpack baggage) disperse (unpack baggage) or repel
(unpack baggage) that community (unpack baggage) which we (unpack
baggage) imagine (unpack baggage) we (deconstruct unpacked baggage) could
(post to Utopia) be (and tell Zeno it explains everything and so tells us
nothing (unpack baggage)).
     Our (deny feelings) behavior (stuff shirt) or tone might (tone +
     might = ?) also incite discourse (spray armpits with chemicals) which
     might ("Let the machine get it, honey") give rise to (repeat to remove
     accent) greater understanding (send paranoid message backchannel) of who
     we (tell Diogenes you can't debase debased coinage) are (strike "genuine
     desire to positively change things" and insert "negativity"; stamp
     folder "miscreant"; file under "mudslinging"; close drawer; open mind;
     insert air freshener; close mind).

Those caveats aired, I do agree, and appreciate your post.

Sincerely,

Gary

Gary, thanks for responding and thanks for qualifying some of my over-
simplistics, necessary business.

Please Don't Lurk (sounds like it should be a pop refrain).

Yes, Denial or rejection of the past are 'classic' fascist characteristics.
There are also the boorish Buff type impositional tyrannies of competitive
knowledge and the denial of the present through continual deflection. A
kind of unfocussed peevishness, sometimes at becoming oneself
misunderstood. It's been read that way and that's my shoddy peripherality.
And Between  -  My States of Attention. But then this country is a capital
of the heartlands of denial.

p.s. I'd like to suggest that 'lurking' be valued as a positive rather than
a negative aspect. But it can go so cold it freezes.
Certainly attention focussed onto activating and facilitating rather than
dominating and controlling 'conversation'.

I get a little nervous with extensive discussions about formation of
community, actually, for it often seems to take the place of engaging in
the activities in the doing of which we become one...

There are of course cultural aspects to the net community thing, as
elsewhere.  Native Americans (who are seeking sovereignty in cyberspace
as well as in material space), for example, are concerned about the clash
between net culture and their own.  In most Native American societies,
the most important people are those who are silent in public and sit at
the back of the room, while it is the younger and less influential folks
who make the noise.  Obviously, this would be problematic in the effort
to sustain their culture within the net.  (There are many examples,
actually, of the use of new information technologies in the sustenance of
traditional cultural forms, but there are other examples, as well, where
this is problematic.)

About four years ago, after attending a string of 7 conferences from
Moscow in the former USSR through eastern and western Europe and Eastern
and Middle US (winding up in Urbana), I was quite struck by the
difference in terms and conceptualizations used to talk about what were
often the very same matters facing the formation of communication
policy.  In the former Warsaw Pact countries, there is great and explicit
concern about the possibility of civil society; in Western Europe,
concern over the sustenance of the public in a time when media were
becoming privatized; in the US, it's all audience and, as individuals,
we've moved from citizens to consumers.  In the case of this list, from
my perspective, one of the things that makes it a community is a sense of
shared substance, including sharing with those who may not be speaking
much.  Silence and listening are the undervalued communications practices
of our time....

Sandra Braman, Sheila Murphy, Mark Wallace, & all

     Sandra, what you say about Native American culture can't be denied by
someone like myself, whose primary, direct experience with Native American
culture has been mostly through my work at the Legal Aid Society of
Minneapolis/Housing Discrimination Law Project. My interaction with both
NA clients and NA lawyers has been mostly instances where indigenous and
non-indigenous cultures in the U.S. interact, or as is often the case,
clash.  I've attended a few readings and other events featuring Native
American writers, and the audiences for these events have been of mixed
race. So, I do appreciate what you have to say about how (some of) these
cultures behave publicly, within their specific social groups. (I'd like
to get more of that, actually, which is why I appreciate Mark Nowak--a
"younger" poet--'s lists of work so much; want more from him.)
     But, Sandra, I do think younger poets have been listening to, mainly
by reading, older poets; I came to poetry not out of a desire to write it,
which came later, but to read it. I spent many years reading poetry (if
not as "intensely" as I do these days) before I wrote my first poem. I
think most of us began, first, by reading, or "listening to," our elders.
     Relative to that: In response to both Sheila Murphy and Mark
Wallace's questions about form, & the "how" & "why": The first poem I
wrote that "mattered" to me was written in direct response to work I'd
been reading in an early issue of _avec_ that my wife Marta & I had
typeset. As John Geraets (I believe) pointed out, one of the things
younger poets respond to are "lacks"--and I felt a definite "lack" in the
poetry I found there, which I was forced to read very slowly, if not
always as carefully as I should've, as I was typing it into the computer;
specifically, I was in love (still am), but having difficulty verbally
expressing that emotion to my wife without it being corny, reductive and
cliche, and none of the poetry in that _avec_ *seemed* to include this
most basic of human instances. I thought I might take phrases and lines
from what (at first) seemed to be the very abstract language in _avec_,
and somehow use that language, re-presented, to speak, as directly as I
could, to my lover. Much of the language I "ripped off" was language
having to do with the difficulties of communication, and so my concerns,
as it turned out, where not altogether different from my elders'. But it
took writing something, working on it for six months, for me to really
understand that. What began out of an apparent difference of "concerns"
developed into a further understanding, for me, of the nature of the work
in _avec_. What began as resistance, struggle, which wasn't resolved by my
reading the work, ended, by virtue of my active participation with it
(re-using the language, "against"  its apparent context), in my reaching a
point where I began to appreciate writing I'd at first mistrusted.
     Participation isn't necessarily noise, and I do hope that other
younger or less-established writers will respond to Mark W.'s and Sheila
M.'s questions (I've enjoyed that by those who have). Bill Luoma, how did
you come to write _My Trip to New York_? Is your work--as I'm reading
it--predominantly "speech- based"? Mark Nowak, how do you use,
specifically, all of the diverse material you read? What are the
difficulties you've faced in doing that, if any? Erica Hunt, can you take
what Mark Nowak addressed in his last post further by talking about your
own work, influences? Ira Lightman, "No Things But in Ideas," the work of
yours I read in _Mirage_; would you be willing to talk a little about how
the form (a brief excerpt)

     FOUR O'CLOCK, LIGHT
     IN THE HOUSE, STREET
               TWELVE BRIT
     NIGHT
          SLEEP LEE, STREE
     T BRUSH, MORN
     GONE, BRITAIN A
     PPROACH ...

addresses, if & as it does, that very provocative title?
     I'd like to read more of what younger or less-often published writers
have to say about their work, about poetry, specifically or generally.
(Questions above not being rhetorical, or necessarily limited to those
addressed, or even to "younger" poets.)
     Shy poets (though, as John Weiners says, there's maybe no such
thing), you can e-mail instead of post, if you prefer.  (Don't mean to put
anyone "on the spot.")

sandra and others:  i recently had the pleasure of reading a dissertation
that brings theories of complex systems to bear on the composition process,
via three case studies, to yield "ecologies of composition"... the diss.
is by margaret a. syverson, entitled "the wealth of reality:  an ecology
of composition" (university of california at san diego, 1994)... i believe
it to be a brilliant work, one that provides a much richer account of
reading, writing and textuality than i've seen to date within the composition
field per se (and whatever local reservations i might have)...

i find this pertinent to the discussion hereabouts for two (general) reasons:
one, that the first of syverson's case studies consists of examining
the various factors surrouding the writing/revision/publication of charles
reznikoff's "early history of a writer"; and two, that the last of syverson's
case studies consists of a discourse-analysis-based account of conflict that
emerged in an electronic forum during the gulf war... in short, i found the
theoretical claims made by syverson to jibe well with my own sense of how
complex writing and reading and corresponding in fact are... whether the model,
if you will, that she employs is found by some in these parts to be a bit
restrictive (or reductive) is less to the point, i think, than that there *does*
in fact exist theoretical speculation, if you will, that attempts at least
to advance in methodological terms a view of process that perhaps, just perhaps
poet
s too may find useful/enlightening...

anyway, if any of you do manage to have a look-c, i'd be much interested in
what you think...

in any case, i don't believe folks in the humanities should resist ipso facto
empirical claims, and i do believe that 'we' have something vital to add to
more methodologically-centered fields... and that 'we' includes poets, i'm
trying not to speak solely as what i in fact am in part---an academic...

issues simultaneously (as with GERSHWIN and, more recently, ADRIFT,
also work-in-progress such as STANZAS FROM DJERASSI) as text and
audiotape.  they performed here (in tuscaloosa) this past
december--poems, songs, dance, two-voice pieces.  jack is a great
resource, fine connection to the writing/performings of others.
(jack & adelle, for example, are recorded on lou harrison's most
recent cd, a 77th birthday celebration from musical heritage
society--they read, with lou, three-voice versions of some of lou' s
poems).  enough blurb.  you can reach jack, if you're interested, at

It's clear to me, at least, that non-linear causality is the only way to
get at what's happening in the area of communications, yet an approach
that desperately needs those with mathematical tools, etc., in order to
develop it in a useful way....  "Commnications effects" is a field that

sandra, what's fascinating about syverson's dissertation is the extent to
which she manages to employ concepts such as distribution, embodiment,
emergence and enaction (across social, psychological, material, spatial
and temporal constraints) in her approach to different writing situations
WITHOUT a rigorous mathematical model and WITHOUT generating more metaphorical
platitudes... that is, she shows how such a model can be put to practical
use in the educational arena proper... for a lot of artists, such concerns
are strictly ex post facto, and while it is true that syverson is primarily
concerned not with the particular writing or corresponding activity or
practice but with the extent to which such inquiry informs the sorts of
ecologies we contribute to (willingly or otherwise, no determinism implied
or intended) i found much in her sense that such practices are intrinisically
*historical* (i.e., time-(inter)dependent and dynamic) as opposed to simply
structural (and cause-effect based) to help breathe some reflexive life into
my own meanderings of late...

Subject:      Close Reading

Can someone please tell me exactly *why* the "close
reading" of texts is such a reprehensible practice? I
notice it came up in an oblique sort of way in the
Silliman Fan Club brouhaha, and I'm probably showing my
complete and utter ignorance and stupidity. On 2 March
Ron said that "I've been trashed for close reading
before (by Don Byrd among others), as if the practice
itself were politically incorrect (rather than the uses
to which it once was put a full generation ago)."
However one reads Silliman's prose I would not think
he's instructing his reader how a text ought to be
read, but recording how he himself reads it (and what
he thinks &c &c) on one particular occasion in a
particular context.

I'd assume that the opposite of a "close" reading is
not so much a "distant" one as a "vague" or
"inattentive" one (though I'm not at all sure exactly
what those words mean in this context). Is there a
point at which a "vague" reading gets to be
reprehensible, or preferable? (And so on.)

This is not a facetious question. I like reading, and
I'm really interested in the sorts of strategic
decisions people actually make when they read; I'm
interested in *how* they read (I'm not all that sure
how *I* read, either, come to that, and if I have a
method at all it sure changes a lot, day to day, book
to book, poem to poem). I'd have thought "close
reading" would be less rather than more reprehensible,
so I ask the question in all seriousness.

Dear Peter:

Good question, re: "close reading". I certainly can't speak to the
specificity of the reference to Ron Silliman and Don Byrd. Generally
though, my experience is that "close reading" has become demonized by
association with "New Criticism", and entered the panoply of sins
connected with formalist concepts of the poem. The opposite of
"close reading" (in this demonology) would be "contextual reading"
rather than "inattentive". So that "close reading", having been
politicized in this binary opposition, is now short hand for
reactionary, agrarian, humanistic reading, as opposed to progressive
historically, socially, economically, racially contexualized reading.

Any serious reader, it seems to me, would laugh at such a distinction.
But whole careers are built on it. Alas.

Best,
Mike

Dear Peter,

It seems to me that Michael Boughn's "demonology" is largely accurate as an
account of the use of "close reading" in many circles today--many in the
academy do seem to set up "close" and "contextualized" reading as (false)
binaries, attributing the former to the now vanquished practices of New
Criticism.  But there are other attacks on "close reading" coming from other
directions, within and without the academy.  Here "close reading" seems really
to mean something closer to "controlling reading" or "controlled reading."
Charles Bernstein's poetics of "errant singularity"--Altieri's phrase--seems to
use the phrase "close reading" in that second way, for instance.  Thus in
_Artifice of Absorption_ we have the following: "The obvious problem is that
the poem said in any other way is not the poem.  This may account for why
writers revealing their intentions or references ('close readings'), just like
readers inventorying devices, often say so little:  why a sober attempt to
document or describe runs so high a risk of falling flat.  In contrast, why
not a criticism intoxicated with its own metaphoricity, or tropicality: one in
which the limits of positive criticism are made more audibly artifical; in
which the inadequacy of our explanatory paradigms is neither ignored nor
regretted but brought into fruitful play."  Or one might look at the recent
_Exact Change_ interview with Michael Palmer, where, discussing "voice in
Stevens" and the appropriation of Stevens by New Critics Palmer says,
"I think the reason that finally--after initially ignoring Stevens, perhaps
because of his difficulty--the New Critics began to attend to him was because
they could finally see the control of tone, etc., as susceptible to close
reading.  And I think I've always tried to undermine close reading, to make it
unreadable from that point of view."

It seems to me that we have two problems then--how to dismantle the binary
Michael Boughn refers to, and how to present a model of close reading which
would allow for openness, uncertainty, and generosity to stand in for the
desire for "mastery" always--perhaps falsely, it's been so long since I read
them--attributed to the New Critics.  But this is not really a problem, as we
have no shortage of such models, your own excellent work included.  Not that
many in the academy are paying attention anymore (I'll echo Boughn's "alas").

Anyway, that's my two cents worth of banalities from your local dimestore on
this Monday in the Year of Newt and His Company of Lizards.

February 20, 1995

Dear Sirs:

Here are the communiques.  As things are becoming black,
it's almost night.  The cynicism is amazed with the negation
of what is evident: the decision to seek a military
solution.  Us?  Well, but almost scratching at the sky.  The
first time that something falls the sky, it will fall on me.

Let's go.  Health and and a well-equipped boat to break
through so much darkness.

From the mountains of southeastern Mexico.

Subcomandante insurgent Marcos
Mexico, February 1995

P.S. Writing on February 15, 1995, sixth day of the retreat
(we recommend that it be read before each meal; it is an
excellent diet aid).

"The morning of the 15th we were going to drink our urine.
I say "we were going to" because we didn't do it as we all
began to vomit after the first swallow.  Previously there
had been a discussion.  Although all of us had been in
agreement that each person should drink his/her own urine,
Camilo say that we should wait until night came so that the
urine gets cold in the canteens, and we can drink it
thinking that it is a soda.

In defense of his position, Camilio argued that he had heard
on the radio that imagination made anything possible.  I
opposed the idea, suggesting that time would only make the
odor stronger, as well as mentioning that the radio had not
been recently known for its objectivity.  My other self
alleged that a time of rest could help the ammonia settle on
the bottom.  " It will be the adrenaline"--I said, realizing
strangely that the skepticism was my own and not my other
self.  Finally we decided to take a sip, all at the same
time, to see what would happen.  I don't know who began the
"concert", but almost immediately all of us began vomiting
what we had ingested, and also what we hadn't.  We were left
even more dehydrated, lying on the ground.  Like dunces,
stinking of urine.  I think that our image was hardly
soldier-like.  At these hours, before the sun comes up, a
sudden rain pelted us and alleviated our thirst and our
spirits.  With the first light of the sixth day we continued
walking.  In the afternoon, we came upon the outskirts of a
small village. Camilo went near to ask for something to eat.

He returned with a little fried pork, hard and cold.  We ate
it right there without any modesty.  In a few minutes the
cramps began. The diarrhea was memorable.  We were tied to
the foot of a small wooded hill.  A patrol of federal troops
passed by about 500 meters away.  They didn't find us
because God is grand.  The smell of shit and urine could be
smelled kilometers away..."

PS Reiterating their rebellion
They can bring more.  To do in all of the villages what they
did in Guadalupe Tepeyac, where, for each resident, child or
adult, they brought in 10 soldiers, for each horse a war
tank, for each chicken, an armored vehicle. In total 5,000
soldiers who patrol a deserted village and "protect" a whole
slew of dogs, in all of the areas, in all of the ranches.
The whole state of Chiapas full of soldiers..

On top of everything and everyone, the mountains of
southeastern Mexico will continue to be rebel territory
against the bad government.  This will continue being
Zapatista territory.

It will be forever...

P.S.  Clarifying and rectifying

It was not the EZLN who broke off the dialogue and
reinitiated the war. It was the government.

It was not the EZLN who feigned political willingness while
preparing a military attack and betrayal.  It was the
government.

It was not the EZLN who detained and tortured civilians.  It
was the government.

It was not the EZLN who murdered. It was the government.

It was not the EZLN who bomed and strafed communities. It
was the government.

It was not the EZLN who raped indigenous women. It was the
government.

It was not the EZLN who robbed and plundered the campesinos.
It was the government.

It was not the EZLN who betrayed the will of an entire
nation to find a political solution to the conflict. It was
the government.

P.S. Pointing out incongruencies in the investigations of
the Attorney General
If the "Sup" had received political and military training
from the Sandinistas, he would have already organized a
"pinata" with the recovered properties and he would have
expelled those who have criticized from the organization. If
the "Sup" had received training from the Salvadoreans, he
would have already given his weapon to Cristiani.  If the
"Sup" had received aid from the Russians, he would have
already bombed Chechenia, excuse me, Guadalupe Tepeyac.

In addition, what other guerrilla army, " of the millenium",

"fundamentalist", and directed by "white university people"
has carrried out the military actions that the EZLN has done
in January 1994 and in breaking through the military
blockade in December 1994? What other guerrilla force has
agreed to sit down and dialogue only 50 days after having
taken up arms?  What other guerrilla force has appealed, not
to the proletariat as the historical vanguard, but to the
civic society which struggles for democracy?  What other
guerrilla force has put itself aside in order not to
interfere in the electoral process?  What other guerrilla
force has convened a national democratic movement, civic and
peaceful, so that armed struggle becomes useless? What other
guerrilla force asks its bases of support about what it
should do before doing it?  What other guerrilla force has
struggled to achieve a democratic space and not for power?
What other guerrilla force has relied more on words than on
bullets?

Note: Please send the responses to the, supposedly
disappeared, CISEN so that it can help think in a "modern"
way. Yes, to the CISEN. The Attorney General is only the
pimp paying the ruling class.

P.S. Calling myself the "special investigator on the case of
the Sup" and inviting the national and international civic
society to be the jury and pronounce the sentence.

"Being such and such hour on such and such day, of such and
such month, in the current year, see before this P.S. a man
of indefinite age, between 5 and 65 years old, with his face
covered with one of those garments that appears to be a sock
with holes in it (and which the gringos call "ski mask", and
the Latin Americans call "pasamontanas--mountain passes").
Among the particular signs of a face, two enormous
protruberances emerge, one of which, which was supposedly
deduced after several sneezes, is the nose.  The other,
judging by the emanations of smoke and the smell of tobacco,
could be a pipe, like the ones used by sailors,
intellectuals, pirates and fugitives from justice.  Exhorted
to say only the truth and nothing but the truth, the
individual in question said that he was called "Marcos
Montes de la Selva", son of Old Anthony and lady Juanita,
brother to young Anthony, Ramona and Susana, uncle to
Tonita, Beto, Eva and Heriberto.  He of the voice declared
himself to be in full control of his physical and mental
faculties, and, without any pressure (other than the 60,000
federal soldiers who are looking for him dead or alive)
declares and confesses the following:

First. That he was born in the guerrilla camp called "Agua
Fria" in the Lacandon jungle, Chiapas, in the early morning
one day in August 1984. The man with the voice says that he
was reborn the first of January 1994, and born again,
succesively, the 10th of June 1994, the 8th of August 1994,
the 19th of December 1994, the 10th of February 1995, and
each day and each hour and each minute and each second since
that day up to this moment in which I am making this
declaration.

Second. That, in addition to his name, he has the following
aliases: "Sub", "Subcomandante", "Sup", "Supco",
"Marquitos", "Pinche Sup", "Sup son of a ...", and others
that the power of this PS Agent prevents from writing.

Third. He of the voice confesses that, since having been
born, he has conspired against the shadows which cover the
Mexican sky.

Fourth. He of the voice confesses that, before being born,
being able to possess everything in order to have nothing,
he decided to possess nothing in order to have everything.

Fifth. He of the voice confesses that, in the company of
other Mexicans, the majority Mayan Indians, they decided to
make a paper live up its words, a paper that they teach
about in school, which lists the rights of the Mexican
citizens and which is called, "The Political Constitution of
the United Mexican States".  He of the voice pointed out
that, in article 39 of this paper, it is said that the
people have the right to change the government.  Coming to
this point, the P.S., jealous of his right, ordered the very
subversive paper confiscated, and ordered that it be burned
with giving it a glance, and having done this, continued to
take the statement of the individual with the obvious nose
and the contaminating pipe. He of the voice confessed that,
not being able to exercise this right by peaceful and legal
means, he decided, together with his accomplices, (these
whom he of the voice calls "brothers"), to take up arms
against the supreme government and to shout "Enough!" to the
lie that, says he of the voice, rules our destinies.  The
P.S. could not help but be terrified in the face of such
unusual blasphemy, and was fixated on the idea of leaving
him without "a bone".

Sixth. He of the voice confessed that, put to choosing
between comfortableness and responsibility, he of the voice
always chooses responsibility.  This statement merited the
disapproval of the people present to this preparatory
statement and the instinctive reflex of the P.S. to put his
his hand on his wallet.

Seventh. He of the voice confessed that he has been
irreverent with all of the truths that are called supreme,
execept those that emanate from being a human being and that
they are, to declare clearly, dignity, democracy, liberty
and justice.  A murmor of disagreement ran through the Holy
Inquisition, excuse me, the office of the special
investigator.

Eighth. He of the voice confessed that they had tried to
threaten him, to buy him off, to corrupt him, to put him in
jail, and to murder him, and that they had not intimidated
him nor bought him off, nor jailed him, nor killed him (up
until now, he added, threateningly, to the Investigating
P.S.).

Ninth. He of the voice confessed that, since he was born, he
decided that he preferred to die before turning over his
dignity to those who have made lies and crime a modern
religion.  A thought that was so impractical earned a
cynical look from the people present.

Tenth. He of the voice confessed that, since then, he had
decided to be humble with the humble, and to be arrogant
with the powerful.  The P.S. added "irreverent" to the
charges that were being made against him of the voice.

Eleventh. He of the voice confessed that he had believed and
believes in human beings, in their capacity to try
indefatigably to be a little better each day.  He confessed
that, among the human race, he has a special affection for
the Mexican race, and that he had believed, believes and
will believe that Mexico is something more than six letters
and a underpriced product on the international market.

Twelfth. He of the voice confessed that he believes, firmly,
that the bad government has to be brought down by all means
and by all parts. He confessed that he believes that a new
political, economic and social relation has to be created
among all Mexicans, and later on, among all human beings.
These promiscious intentions gave shivers to the P.S.
investigator.

Thirteenth. He of the voice confessed that he will dedicate
himself to the absolute last second of his life, to
struggling for what he believes.

Fourteenth. He of the voice confessed that, in a small and
egotistical act, he will dedicate his last second of his
life to killing himself.

Fifteenth. He of the voice confessed that he was completely
bored with this interrogation.  This earned him a severe
reprimand from the P.S. Interrogator, who explained to him
of the voice that the case will continue until the supreme
government finds another tale to entertain itself.

After these confessions, he of the voice was exhorted to
spontaneously declare himself innocent or guilty of the
following series of accusations.  To each accusation, he of
the voice responded:
     The whites accuse him of being dark. Guilty
     The dark ones accuse him of being white. Guilty
     The authentics accuse him of being indigenous. Guilty
     The treasonous indigenous accuse him of being mestizo.
Guilty
     The machos accuse him of being feminine. Guilty
     The feminists accuse him of being macho. Guilty
     The communists accuse him of being anarchist. Guilty
     The anarchists accuse him of being orthodox. Guilty
     The Anglos accuse him of being Chicano. Guilty
     The antisemetics accuse him of being in favor of the
Jews. Guilty
     The Jews accuse him of being pro-Arab. Guilty
     The Europeans accuse him of being Asiatic. Guilty
     The government officials accuse him of being
oppositionist. Guilty
     The reformists accuse him of being ultra. Guilty
     The ultras accuse him of being reformist. Guilty
     The "historical vanguard" accuse him of calling to the
civic society and not to the proletariat. Guilty
     The civic society accuses him of disturbing their
tranquility.  Guilty
     The Stock Exchange accuses him of ruining their
breakfast. Guilty
     The government accuses him of increasing the
consumption of antiacids in the government's Departments.
Guilty
     The serious ones accuse of being a jokester. Guilty
     The adults accuse him of being a child.  Guilty
     The children accuse him of being an adult. Guilty
     The orthodox leftists accuse him of not condemning the
homosexuals and lesbians. Guilty
     The theoreticians accuse of being a practitioner.
Guilty
     The practicioners accuse of being a theorist. Guilty
     Everyone accuses him of everything bad that has
happened. Guilty

     Not having anything else to declare in this first
preparatory statement, the P.S. Investigator ended the
session and smiled imagining the congratulations and check
that he would receive from his bosses.

P.S. Talking about what was heard on February 16, 1995, on
the afternoon of the seventh day of the retreat

--And why don't we attack instead of retreating?--Camilo
threw at me in the middle of a hill, precisely when I was
concentrating most heavily on breathing and on not falling
into the ravine at our sides.  I didn't respond immediately,
I made signs that he should continue climbing.  At the top
of the hill we three sat down.  Night comes to the mountain
before it comes to the sky, and in the semi-darkness of this
indecisive hour in which light isn't the same, and the
shadows waver.  Something is heard, far away...
     I say to Camilo who is listening with attention.  "What
do you hear?"
     Crickets, leaves, wind-- responds my other self.

     --No--I insist--. Pay attention.

     Now it is Camilo who responds:--Some voices...very far
away...a boom--boom--boom...like a drum...from over
there...--Camilo points to the west.

     --This exactly--I tell him.

     --And?--intervenes my other self.

     --It is the civic society.  Yelling that there can't be
war, there has to be dialogue, that words should talk and
not weapons...--I explained.

     --And the boom-boom-boom?--insisted Camilo.

     --That's their drums. They are calling for peace. There
are many people, thousands, dozens of thousands, hundreds of
thousands. The government is not listening to them and is
confronting them.  We, all the way over here, we have to
listen to them. We have to respond to them.  We can not turn a
deaf ear like the government is doing.  We have to listen to
them, we have to avoid the war until there is no other
choice...

     --And then?--muses my other self.

     --Then we fight--I responded to Camilo.

     --When?--he insisted.

     --When they fall, when they tire. Then that will be the
black hour in which we will have to talk...

     --Fight--says my other self

     I insist: "We do everything for them. If we fight, it
is for them.  If we stop fighting, it is for them.  In the
end they will win. If they annihilate us, they will have the
satisfaction of having done everything possible to avoid it,
to avoid the war.  For this reason they rose up, and now
they are not being held back.  In addition, they have in
their hands a flag that they are responsible for.  If we
live, they will have the satisfaction of having saved us, of
having avoided the war and having demonstrated to us that
they are better and that they can handle the flag.  Whether
we die or live, they live and will become stronger.  For
them everything, for us nothing..."

     Camilo said that he preferred his version: "For them
nothing, for us everything".



     P.S. Reigniting his nocturnal delirium

     Forgetfullness, a faraway lark, is the cause for our
going around without face. To kill forgetfullness with a
little memory, we cover our chests with lead and hope. If,
in some improbable flight, our stay in the wind coincides,
you will take off so many clothes and mask of sweet trick,
and with lips and skin make the memory better, that of
tomorrow. For this reason, a message goes from the earth to
the concrete. Listen well!

     As an unperfect actor on the stage,
     Who with his fear is put besides his part,
     Or some fierce thing replete with too much rage
     Whose strength's abundance weakens his own heart;
     So I, for fear of trust, forget to say
     The perfect ceremony of love's rite,
     And in my own love's strength seem to decay,
     O'ercharg'd with burden of mine own love's might.

     O, let my books be then the elocuence
     And dumb presagers of my speaking breast,
     Who plead for love, and look for recompense
     More than that tongue that more hath more express'd.
     O, learn to read what silent love hath writ;
     To hear with eyes belonge to love's fine wit".

     Sonnets

     William Shakespeare. Sonnet XXIII

Good bye, amber lark, don't look for us under your flight.
Up above yes, where our pain takes us up, to the sun, where
hope rains...

P.S. Not being able to give anything on this birthday

Heriberto has a birthday on the March 5th.  They say he will
complete 4 years and start on his fifth.  Heriberto walks
the mountains, while in his home soldiers live and a tank is
on his patio.  The toys that a "Operation Toys" brought him
for the Three Wise Men's Day, are now in the hands of some
general or being analyzed by the Attorney General in search
of some secret organization.  Heriberto, as much as he
prepared for what happened the 10th of February (the
invasion of the federal soldiers), at the actual moment, he
left behind his best toy: a little car that Heriberto,
inside it, played at being a driver around the patio where
the coffee was dried.  They tell me that Heriberto consoles
himself saying that in the mountain his little car couldn't
go.  Heriberto asked his mom if he ever was going to have
his car again, and if the Sup was not going to give him
chocolates.  Heriberto asked his mom why the war from last
year returned, why his car was left behind--Why?--asks
Heriberto. His mom does not respond, continuing to walk with
the boy and the pain weighing on her shoulders...

P.S. Remembering and I recite from memory, verses from
Antonio Machado? which refer to distinct things, but which
are coming.

                              I
                     In the heart I have
                   the thorn of a passion
              I was able to pull it out one day
                 Now I don't feel my heart.
                     Sharp golden thorn
                  who will again feel you
                   in the stopped heart...

                             II
               At night I dreamed that I heard
                God yelling to me: Watch out!
                 later it was God who slept
                and I was yelling "Wake up"!

P.S. Bleeding unstoppably
                An injury I carry in my chest
                       Of bloody wheat
                    and there is no bread
                 to alleviate the desire...

The Sup at the top of a hill, seeing how the sun goes down,
in the west, a twinkle that is going out...

Subject: NPW: NEA cuts and race

Color-coded culture cuts?
by Kevin Cartwright

Congressional budget hearings on the National Endowment for
the Arts (NEA) opened in January to ominous forecasts of
NEA's demise as a vital funding source for the arts. The
political right delights in flogging the NEA for allegedly
promoting left-wing ideology and cultivating debased and
marginalized art that most Americans don't care about.

In fact, "the work that is controversial represents less
than 1% of the funding of the endowment," says Vanessa
Whang, fundraiser and program developer at La Pena Cultural
Center in Berkeley. "But for smaller organizations [the NEA]
is their lifeline. They're supporting the meat and potatoes
of being able to stay in business for groups like La Pena
that are working in communities of color," she says.

The NEA has an operating budget of $176 million, a minuscule
amount compared to the military budget or even to
allocations for military bands, which many have pointed out
exceed NEA funding.

Many community-based arts groups which serve minority
communities receive funding from NEA's Expansion Arts
program. If proposed cuts are enacted, this program could be
in danger.

Federal grants to arts groups and individual artists have
been reduced to $24 million, a decrease of $54 million from
last year. Though La Pena received a $30,000 grant this
year, Whang is concerned that cuts could cost jobs and
jeopardize La Pena's ability to offer a range of cultural
programs, classes, and events at low ticket prices (or free)
to people with few resources.
"La Pena and some smaller and mid-size organizations that
are working primarily in communities of color are going to
be hit really hard by this," Whang says.

The Galeria De La Raza opened in San Francisco's Mission
district in 1970, and has been committed to showing the art
of Chicano, Latino and indigenous cultures. Their NEA
funding accounts for 20% of their budget. The lack of
funding would severely affect how they approach programming
and the needs of the community. According to Liz Lerma,
Executive Director of Galeria, the cuts would undermine the
power of cutting-edge art.
"A lot of the dynamism that you find here comes from us
being able to present the art in a timely fashion, you know,
when something is happening we allow the artist to respond
to it essentially. We would be crippled in that effort,"
says Lerma.

"The politicization of NEA funding is rooted in the right-
wing efforts to silence opposition and further marginalize
communities of color," Lerma says. "Places like the Galeria
are known to show varieties of art that aren't afraid of
what the artists are saying. We support it. We're the forum
where it can be said," she adds.

Whang, Lerma and other cultural activists are collaborating
with the San Francisco Arts Democratic Club in an effort to
fight the cuts. At the News ' deadline, the club planned a
Feb. 18 town hall meeting to strategize and set up a letter-
writing and phone campaign. For info: (xxx) xxx-xxxx.

  Dear Michael--THough I know what you mean about "close reading" and its
  debased form (as in X.J. Kennedy intro to literature anthologies)...
  there's no need to associate it with "agrarian" in some pejorative way.
  We do not need some city-country division. If, for instance, there is
  to be some viable way of dealing effectively with culture, there's no
  point isolating ourselves against the "agrarian"--which can also be
  the "tenement migrant farmer" etc...Also, the hegemony of the "contextual"
  the "new historicist" reading in much "hip" avant-garde discourse that
  claims to be a reaction to "close reading" goes too far in the opposite
  direction--like Stephen Greenblatt talking about Renaissance sex-operations
  for 55 pages and then quoting one line in a Shakespeare play, and saying
  "A HA, now you know the meaning of it..." and of course the essay is
  allegedly and ostensibly ABOUT SHAKESPEARE...and though I believe some
  kind of fruitful "balance" can be achieved, the "cultural studies" aspect
  of literature seems to be a dinosaur now, and can only have any value
  if it's ASSUMED that "close reading" is instilled--thus, one generation
  of academics are teaching a younger one to unlearn the things they never
  learned (I speak as one who received an M.A. in english without having
  ever read Shakespeare, for instance), and then there's also the question
  that is seems the symbiotic relationship of GRADUATE and UNDERGRADUATE
  ENGLISH departments can be reduced to this--the undergraduates learn
  exactly what they're suppossed to UNLEARN in grad school....Chris S.

Dear Friends,

I would like to retract my earlier TEXT: "I am the only 2A's, an E, 2G's, an

The AHP as a body has produced the first & only, to my knowledge, Authorless

rather dull, petty, & ultimately uninteresting but gossipy way; the "search

Well, this is getting boring. There is work to be done, & I have my farm to

>>Bill Luoma, how did you come to write _My Trip to New

>>"speech-based"?

Gary,

My prose has lately been slouching toward speech and transparent narrative.
 I also do visual stuff, and am working on a sound poem, so make what you
will of that.

I appreciate your asking me how I wrote My Trip to NYC.  But the fact is I
dont know how I wrote it.  It just happened, as if I tuned in a certain radio
station in a certain cocteau movie.  When I re-read it, some of the sequences
continue to astonish me.  Like, please let me write like that again.  Is it
arrogant to say this?  I wish I knew how to get into the zone on a regular
basis.  Waffles?  But I remember that Shiva says there are too many variables
to formulate a guaranteed methodology.  And I agree  (what then?)  I can only
talk around its writing.

I was living in San Diego.  I visited my friends in NY and Providence that I
hadnt seen for years.  Jennifer Moxley had just started the Impercipient and
published Douglasses poem about the car:

if the car is broken,
& we cannot go to get it,
who will?

if the car is broken,
& no one can go to get it,
who will?

if the car is old & broken,
wounded like the street,

broken like the broken parts
of these our broken lives,

& we remain?

When I got back to San Diego, Scott Bentley wanted me to send him some
slides.  I was on unemployment so I had time to write.  I tried to immitate
Douglasses poem because I thought it was the greatest.  But I couldnt write
beautiful lyrics like Douglass.  I started again.  I described my trip so
Scott could see how his pals were doing on the east coast.  I had never
written about myself and friends before, so it was fun.

I remembered that Helena Bennett was dead.  When your mate dies, you lose
your keys, forget where youre going, cry in public, miss exits on the road,
have moments of aphasia and anemone.  The deadpan spacy voice I could feel in
my head got put down on paper long hand.  I could feel the
instances/scenes/slides I was remembering (to describe to Scott) as short
paragraphs.  I could feel that I loved my friends.  Thus the form was born.

I wrote 80 paragraphs in two days and revised for a few months.  I sent it to
Geoff Young at the Figures and he published it.

Dear Chris:

I wasn't being pejorative, actually, being someone who, along with
Peter Quartermain, believes in the continued importance of teaching
the practice of something called "close reading", as in reading
closely. The "agrarian" in that list of attributes was a perhaps too
arcane reference to the fact that the originators of what came to be
called "The New Criticism" were originally known as the Southern
Agrarians. This group included Cleanth Brooks (still, in my books, one
of the most astute and careful readers I've encountered), Allen Tate,
Robert Penn Warren, and Laura Riding (yes folks, no jive).

They considered themselves "agrarians" in that they felt they
represented traditional, agrarian, humanist values in the face of the
degradations of urban, capitalist, commodified culture. Their theories
about "the poem" as a formal object reflected their desire to find an
uncontaminated space in which to locate those values. The later
contraction of those fundamentally conservative (and I do not use that
word here pejoratively, but rather descriptively) values into the kind
of mastery Keith Tuma (and via him Michael Palmer) refer to is an
interesting story, that has a lot, I think, to do with the
institutionalization of the American intellectual. But it's another
story.

Best,
Mike

We should look at community formation relative to the LISTSERV
phenomenon. First, let me say that anyone who participates is a
de facto member of this community; and maybe even full-time lurkers as
well. I imagine some (myself, sometimes) get into a routine of
subscribing and unsubscribing according to the general tenor of the
discussion threads, not to mention volume of mail, as James notes.
Some threads (Experiwhat?, Boy Talk,  Apex of the M, etc.) were at times
as satisfying as a good Monster Truck demo. I haven't a clue about that
Hokey Pokey business.

I suggest that self-restraint is the only kind of customization that is
possible here, otherwise people start to vote with their bozo filters.
After all, the object of the game is to create a climate that encourages
participation.

As for the subject of splitting the list, worse things have happened.

It would be nice if there could be some general agreement not to engage in
chain-jerking, personal attacks, or "reading" someone out of a discussion,
the rest will take care of itself. Or maybe we should just apply chaos
theory and see if we *can* quantify community after all.

Cheers,

Good points. In any case, I assume "agrarian" is this usage refers
mainly to those New Criticism poets who have been associated with
the term for several decades.

Without acting on the urge to drive out to the nearest hacienda to
bond with the first tenement migrant farmer within hugging distance,
it seems to me that much of the "city/country division" in American
poetry stems from a kind of urban arrogance that, unfortunately, has
been characteristic of some members of the poetry avant-garde
(of several ideological persuasions). For me, writers who obsess
on literature of "the coasts" are guilty of that kind of arrogance .

A slight digression:
Try arguing with an art critic/historian about the validity of
contemporary painting in small cities with active arts communities
and innovative artists (e.g., Cleveland, Baltimore, Austin, etc.).
Artists from these areas are punished both critically and economically
for such transgressions as refusing to move to NY/SF/LA....
A friend of mine who writes for _Art News_ once insisted to me that
writers and artists who remain in these "minor" communities are
perpetually discovering what has already been discovered, an
attitude that is ignorant at best. From where does he suppose most
"New York artists" originate. Does literary and artistic knowledge/
vision/accomplishment come into being only after exposure to
"major" communities? I don't think so.

talkin' bout my generation, I guess, but: re: close reading, and who
unlearns, supposedly, what they learned as undergraduates, and so on.
(I don't mean to rant but): after teaching poetry/theory grad courses the
last few years, I finally decided to cash in on a gathering hunch and
teach, at the grad level, the kind of course I sometimes offer at u.g.
level and that used to be offered all the time: "close reading" that is.
I'm having a great time (some students are, some probably aren't) but so
far the results are pretty staggering.  We're doing the course as a
workshop, in which a poem and its explication, xeroxed in advance, are
discussed concurrently.  And (to me) it's just staggering what the
generally bright and able students don't have a clue about and don't
(yet) by and large have much knack at all for doing.  Just on the very
basic level of poem as speech act or Burkean symbolic action; or when it
comes to thinking about trope as somehow functional in a reasonably
sophisticated way: it's a great big blank by and large (w a couple of
stunningly smart exceptions).  I dunno whether it was always that way
(that is, contra Richards, whether no matter how many classes everyone
takes basically 10% of the people have an ear and the other 90% can't buy
one) or not, but I suspect that not so much deconstruction & all as
cultural studies is partly responsible.  I don't mean it as a discipline
(or non discipline) so much as how it gets filtered into the brainpans of
the undergraduates who end up applying, at least, to Arizona, where the
students are quite good but it's obviously not Berkeley, say.  Even at
the next level up--reading the essays on poetry that come in to Arizona
Quarterly, say, it's really just themes themes themes.
So this doesn't continue to sound like only a dispeptic rant, I guess I'd
want to say that the course is a whole lot of fun (for me anyway), that I
intend to offer it every couple of years, and that I think the old
close-reading staple has pretty much disappeared from the u.g. curriculum
and needs re-instating.  But it really is astonishing to me, still, the
extent to which grad students in the course write essays/explications tht
have virtually nothing to do w wht I understand reading poetry to involve.
must be time to power down here.

DEFENSE OF INDIVIDUAL GRANTS

As many of you know, the main target of proposed rescissions to the NEA's
FY 95 budget are individual grants: $4m out the $5m targetted for cut-back
comes from that area.  In this regard at least, the rescission process
offers just a foretaste of what future appropriation battles will look
like.

If you have a cogent defense of individual grants, now is the time to air

Subject:      Teaching close reading
In-Reply-To:  <199503070606.BAA07861@gwis2.circ.gwu.edu>

This thread may have more relevance on the T-AMLIT list, or perhaps on
some other, but I have to agree with Tenney Nathanson that the
university's emphasis on theory & cultural criticism takes both
undergrads and graduate students away from close reading.  How crucial is
close reading to writers, to poets particularly?  The students I teach
who have most interest in close reading are those who take as many
creative writing courses as they can.

But the different types of reading -- pertinent to different types of
writing -- a "close reading" of works by most of those subscribing to
this list might not much resemble, task by specific task, a close reading
appropriate to poems written by those in that other, dominant,
not-precisely-parallel tradition (as can be found discussed, say, on the
CAP-L list).

But it could be that NT's point is that no matter the difference in
poetic ideology or practice, a critical reading strategy which involves
reading-with-a-purpose (i.e., to explore cultural or economical
conditions imbedded in various texts) may not _need_ to include close
reading strategies.  Reading for "pleasure," however, or reading to
"understand the author's meaning or purpose" -- those tasks do involve
close reading (no matter the poetics, I suspect).

The grad-level seminars I've been teaching the past two years make me
think students haven't learned much about close reading; but most find it
valuable to get an introduction.  Minds are malleable....

Gary, thanks for your posting asking:

> "Ira Lightman, "No Things But in Ideas," the work of
yours I read in _Mirage_; would you be willing to talk a little about how
the form (a brief excerpt)

     FOUR O'CLOCK, LIGHT
     IN THE HOUSE, STREET
               TWELVE BRIT
     NIGHT
          SLEEP LEE, STREE
     T BRUSH, MORN
     GONE, BRITAIN A
     PPROACH ...

addresses, if & as it does, that very provocative title?"

The thing is having a number of theoretical and personal and aesthetic
enthusiasms/beliefs, and not being able right now to set them all in relation
in a complex formal structure, longpoem etc. So nothing will get worked out
or mapped in this poem, but "disparate" things (ie with unexplained
connections) will appear in the poem, in this case because the title was in
my head when the poem was going down on the page. So no go on the form of
this poem being shown to address the title, but perhaps a few remarks about
strains:

1) the title; I spent two years in New Zealand working by myself on the
prosody of the first seven Cantos of Ezra Pound; there is a music that
quite formally follows through (not free verse at all) *if* the words can
be read with the emphasis, investment, background reading and thinking and
feeling that I hypothesize Pound had. There are the equivalent too of
dilemmas and paradoxes, just as there would be in well-argued piece of
philosophical prose (musically monotonous), in this "music that quite
formally follows through". So "no things but in ideas" in the sense that
all objects, and musics, to me depend on seeing or meeting the composer
or a wonderful interpreter, or reading good texts about or by the author,
with huge empathetic imagination, so that one has a world of similar ideas
and emphases (the word "incest", for example, scans very differently
depending on your take on Freud). And then the pay-off; hearing the most
wonderful formal complexity, accepting the ideas in one's head in an act
of being the composer (intentionality!) that is not so just intentionaliy,
in the sense of "you can only get it if you agree with it", but *negative
intentionality*, like Keats' negative capability. Oh and maybe some of
the author's soul is left in you after....

2) specific poetic in this piece; my biggest influence is a painter and
muralist called Betty Schlesinger, from South London. She is the only
avant-garde muralist I know, in the sense that she works with the primary
weapon of the muralist, trompe l'oeil (mislead the eye), but where other
muralists do this by (thinking they are) misleading you into thinking there
is a mantelpiece on the wall or a window looking out onto a garden,
Schlesinger does this by taking the lines of a room and painting against
them eg a diagonal bridge painted around the corner of a room so that if
you look at it hard you can't see the right-angle; in other words, working
with people's unchallenged expectations that a wall in a house will always
have another wall at right-angles to it, or a door of such and such a
height or a room with a sloping ceiling will slope always in a particular
way. Her murals work with those expectations (like some avant-gardists
work with expectations of left-to-right reading across the page and tug
at them, Carla Harryman, for example) and tug at them. She uses her skills
as a representational painter (her canvases are usually still-life, which
"accounts" for her utter neglect by a London art scene) to do something
genuinely avant-garde, when so many lazy conceptualists with no
draughtsmanship abound.

3) I often read texts as trompe l'oeil, seeing other words within or
rhyming with the real words in the text; we don't know ourselves, perhaps
the mistake word or phrase was the real one.

4) In this poem there is a specific narrative line unfairly split often
in mid-word, sometimes for musical value, sometimes to open the text to
others and me to read "subconscious trompe l'oeil".

5) There's also a lot of very personal references eg to the subway stop
"Osterley" on the Piccadilly Line on the London Underground. The London
Underground has too much of a mythic status and too many connotations for
most readers to use it in other than a hidden and secretive way. The whole
poem is about flying from London to San Fransisco, seeing Osterley from
the plane, but that isn't needed; I was putting myself in at least two
frames of mind, one gives a music to those who know the personal and
theoretical ideas (as in my reading of Pound I think I did) and the other
gives a music to those who want to read it as flat surface (I hope).
Some of the words in the text don't resolve into a narrative at all, though,
of any sort.

6) It was basically an improvisation, leading to the fragment I nudged
the editor towards putting on the cover:

                me/an/in
                g = t-cells

This tends towards my favourite form: the mnemonic. Where lots of rhythms
and ideas flow into and out of the captured moment, just as a painting
selects a moment, suggests the past leading up to it, indicates in the
texture and light some of where it is all going. I wanted to say, as an
AIDS activist, how "me" is a thing, so needs an "an", and not a "the" as
the thing it is decided by different ideas, sometimes many at once. To
emphasis the "in", that we are all "in" this epidemic, whether HIV positive
or friends of a PWA or none of the above. And we are "in" some kind of
self, "it p ills self hood", and need to act energetically to see others'
constructions on us and counter-act. And also to figure us and parody us,
in the vision of medicine, as sums and algebra (and also to bring in some
maths, on a personal level, because I liked it at school and it was a major
boost of my self-esteem to be good at it, but is that "in" the poem or not,
doesn't have to be).
        I'm doing lots of mnemonic type paintings of words now, in homage
to Johanna Drucker, but I don't know that "me/an/in g = t-cells" worked
without all the other improv energy around it, personalising it, making
it less slogan-like, as I prefer to do mnemonics that aren't slogans. What
I do now is live these improvs in my head until I come up with a little
phrase or letter-cluster I want to paint.

Sorry to bore everyone else, but I wanted to answer you, Gary, in public
like you addressed me,

Best


Ira

forgive me if i came in too late on this subject and missed important opening
salvoes (i just joined the list y-day) --but it seems that when people refer to
"close reading," they have in mind a very particular and historically
circumscribed set of concerns --not only foregrounding the materiality of the
text itself (words) but a certain vocabulary that is, indeed, inherited,
relatively recently, from the agrarians/new critics.  but there  has always been
"close reading" and an hermeneutic/exegetical/interpretive process --in the
sense of careful attention to the material structures of a work-- of one kind or
another --whether from a rhetorical (medieval) perspective or other --many
people read religious texts, the bible or koran, with a close attention that
would put prosodists to shame --and that there's no need to fetishize the kind
of close reading we learned in poetry classes as the only close reading that
enables intimacy and respect for a text.  much good cultural studies work --for
example, see daniel boyarin's writing on talmudic traditions --combines a close
and charged relationship with the structural/formal elements of a work with
broader concerns. that's all folks--maria damon

Subject:      cloze reading

The notion of close reading, parsing, fakes an ideological neutrality that
we've all come to know as a right-wing excision of the social because it
relegates the poetic act to an independent linguistic domain. This embrace
of the idea beyond the motivation of it is a close (cloze) reading - a cold
embrace. The fold, or moment of discovery, comes when we are not parsing
"The Idea of Order at Key West," the lay of the land/sea as described by a
resolute metaphysician. This is par - the task of close reading as an
encounter with the independent idea is equal to the face, or aspect of the
writing. It seems to me the real moments of discovery lie in the friction
between the practice of distilling and a poem that refuses, or complicates
that distillation through, for example, it's linguistic opacity and/or
cultural "position." In these contexts, close reading becomes an engagement
with that friction, the totality of languaging, the rubbing up against the
social, the motivation of the poem cutting in one direction, while the idea
of the language tumbles in another. It is here that there is a
determination of reading as a process of the social, because here our
belief in the distinction between language and motivation is tried. So, in
this trial, close reading becomes a passionate exchange of the social and
the linguistic; the linguistic becomes/is the social. Close reading in this
case is really close. We begin to parse, or closely read ourselves.

I don't get the connection between close reading, as a critical
interrogative practice and the implicit sense of right/wrong that Ed is
suggesting. I never met a reading of one of my poems that wasn't also a
misreading, and that "mis" has often been instructive. One is not after
"right" readings, I hope. But I would love to hear Ed or Don explicate
the authoritarian impulse they feel lurks behind the practice.

Similarly, David McA, I've always felt that the turn away from close
reading via theory was a diminution of theory itself. We're all
impoverished thereby.

I'm not so sure that *mis*reading is a very helpful term because it
suggests right readings. my own flip response here (I'm supposed to
be on the bus on the way to work) is simply that some readings are
more interesting than others, but I guess that's another whole
can of worms. I'll have to think some more on that. As for those
"students", well, they are why I have to catch the bus, but I'm not
sure what the connection is between "students" (presumably working
for grades) and close reading (presumably done for, well, call
it "pleasure"). Some of my students come up with admirably "correct"
and appallingly DUMB or should I say dull readings because there's
no delight in them. They read out of duty.
    But when I asked my original question, I was not thinking
pedagogy, I was wondering about my own reading practice -- which is
what I take to the classroom anyway -- and is, I'd say (or tries to
be), well, attentive.
I'm not entirely sure how "students" got into

        I'm happy Peter Quartermain raised the vexing question of close
reading, also one of the intersections between poetry and theory.

        In recent critical history, close reading took a nose dive when De
Man's wartime journalism was uncovered.  Deconstruction, I think, really
became close reading for most of us in the eighties.  Then, nobody I knew
(like Barbara Johnson) knew just what to do, except perhaps stop.

        I totally agree with Chris Stroffolino that post-deconstructive
tendencies tend to slight or ignore texts altogether.  I also think that
what I've been calling "textually specific" reading can be what Patrick
Phillips calls "a passionate exchange between the social and the
linguistic," one which overcomes the isolation with the materiality of
the poem.

        Yet if we continue to read, I don't think we can read just like Brooks,
Bloom, or de Man have been doing (when "misreading" began to be prized).
I'm now at work on a book tentatively called "Reading Poetry Now."  Have
any of you any suggestions about innovative readings, or reading
theories, out there?  I'd appreciate the help.

I've had a lot of interruptions reading the list lately, but I recall
that Tenney Nathanson made at least a tangential connection between close
reading or the lack of it in schools and the lack of an ear by students.
I know that I did a lot of close reading as a grad & undergrad in the
70's, but I don't recall that such practice helped much in hearing the
work. I also don't recall that the professors teaching such close
readings had much of an ear. Whereas listening to Monk & Miles (the
sounds & the silences), as well as Cage, and reading Pound & H.D. & later
Niedecker, & always Dickinson, helped a lot. Reading for pleasure -- is
that connected to close reading?

It is interesting to see that Close-Reading can be such a hotly
contestable term. ( I suppose that this is a problem not of poetics at
large simply, but of a pedagogic situation for poetics.)

What are we talking about?  Reading, re-reading, reading again & again, over & over; reading
through, reading around & as Ron was saying mis-reading
(traduire=trahir)....putting  into relief  this & that for the sake
of the other, (the Other)....

Working with images (pictures &tc) what is often wanting is a good
stretch of time for what is on, in and around the image to come to
light.

Call this close-reading & spectres of "fascist" practices associated
now with the sins of New Criticism (oh boy! these -isms again)
appear!  Call it the slow careful detailed intimate & thoughtful
reading or viewing of a "work" or "piece" or "    ".

The question then arises how much of the extensive critical,
aesthetic, theoretical, historical literature in any of the arts is
grounded in this process?  Or even better, the question might be
how little.

I suppose that reactions posted recently to the close-reading
of  New Critics is grounded in readings of New Critical texts.  I
must "confess" that I thought F.R.Leavis's practical criticism
lectures were among the most exciting and stimulating events
of the 1950's in eng.lit. at Cambridge, because there was a
widespread lack of close-up attention to texts in respect of
"values".  Whether he was right or wrong was not consequential,
because he always insisted that questions of value were always
open-ended.  The usual alternative attention to texts was that of
annotation of detail. (But I suppose that is not what the objection
to "fascist" New Criticism is about, given the  American Agrarianism
argument.  But then I wouldn't want to take up the positions of
Michael Fried in relation to the values of Abstraction, while I
still admire the persistence and specificity of his critical writing).

There is a problem in "higher" education that stems from the
difficulty of close or intimate reading (I too like "Density" and "Difficulty" and
"Opacity" as points d'appui).  It is easier for students to sidestep
it and get rewarded for translating theory instead  (for many younger
academics)  or (in art history) to do iconography and annotation and
cataloguing  (for older academics).   There is resistance to taking
time and space for the specifics of a "work" from both directions
(new & old, so to speak).  Radical and Subversive is what it may well
be in 1995 to do close, intimate reading.

Call it perhaps "description", description of artworks.  "Describe a
picture", as an exercise for students, immediately raises the
problems barely sketched above.  It is probably impossible to specify
with any precision (the too many variables in communication
processes, Sandra Braman?) how to do this exercise.  Lack of specification
is interesting: it allows for students to determine specifications in the
actual occasion of writing.   (This kind of work is best carried out
as far as possible from university grade systems, because the
protocols for description are so unspecific).

Shiva confesses that precisely the reason she never studied literature
either as an undergraduate or graduate, the reason she isn't doing
literature as a professor -- though she persistently and passionately
continues to read and write and read and write and read and write -- was
being TOLD how to read....  Somehow, for this poet, it took the life out
of it....

Dear Gary,

Having returned from a few days off line and having now read your
post beginning: "My apologies to Jonathan Brannen and others for
being reductive." I have to echo Tony Green's "Apology accepted...
But not what I was looking for."

I wasn't complaining because you were reductive.  My complaint was
that you were inaccurate and that I felt your characterizations
of other writers and presses in Minnesota had perhaps performed
a disservice to them.  The point I had hope to make was that
it's better to ask questions than to assume.  You elicit marvelous
responses when you do ask.  Keep up the good work.  I think you
and Sheila and Bill and Ira have introduced a needed and useful
new direction to the discussion on this list.

Thanks,

Most of my teachers, I think, were excellent, so maybe my experience
differs from the norm.  Still, I did have some losers thrown in there,
and surely some of them were just being tendentious under the guise of
doing "close reading."  From such you wouldn't learn much of anything, of
ear or eye.  We've all had enough bad teaching to know what it's like to
feel stepped on.

The best writers, theorists or poets, have paid a
lot of attention to things -- for example, to the prosody of the first
seven Cantos.  "Close reading," the way I intended it, is just a subset
of "paying attention."  Reading page after page of "close readings" of
poems, on the other hand, wears thin pretty quickly.  Let's just read the
poems, I want to say!

In my earlier post I spoke simplistically of teaching strategies of close
reading pertinent to different types of writing.  That's not right.  We
certainly can learn strategies for reading, as we can learn strategies for
finding our way through the woods; but we can't know in advance the
"type," if there is such a thing, of a piece of writing.  We really do
have to read it, I guess.

I had tried to suggest by using "scare-quotes" that I understand "reading
for pleasure" to be a complicated if not illusory notion, but yes, as a
practical matter, people who read poetry frequently will tend, I think,
to read it carefully.  That doesn't mean that everyone is open to
poetries which do things differently from what they like to have done, or
what they are used to liking.  Pound's problem with Whitman may have been
that Pound didn't see carefulness in Whitman's work.  Or maybe he just
didn't like it and so couldn't read it carefully.

And now I'll tiptoe back to the shadows..

David McAleavey:  "Reading page after page of "close readings" of poems, on the

poems, I want to say!"

  I just joined this list last week, and the first messages I saw led me to
belive the discussion would soon turn to crop rotation.  I was relieved when I
saw the posts about close reading,  then disillusioned when I wasn't taking the
time to read most of the posts!
        My background in poetry is severely limited...(read: they made me write
haiku and limerick in grade school) and find myself almost overwhelmed at the
content of my first undergrad poetry class.  When I first started reading for
the course, I had no choice but to slow down and try to immerse myself in the
poems, reading closely (almost drowning myself).   There have been many times
when I instinctively wanted to "just read the poem" but it would all just turn
into a jumble of words.  For comfort, i would often trun to Dr. Seuss and read
aloud.  Chanting "Fox in Socks" while stomping around a dorm room can be very
liberating and soothing when Olson becomes frustrating.

Let's just read the poem!  -i want to say it to, but it gets me nowhere.

Subject:      Intimacy and intimations of a micropoetics

1.
Confusions of terminology: "close reading" v. intimate reading
as if theory and 'to read' can nae share the same bed.  And
deconstructions be damned, there is not a spirit of MIS-READING
(in the academy anyway) despite the prevalence of misreadings there.

2.
Fact is "close reading" as method gallops toward singularity,
imperial resolution of the chord and production of the cadence.
So to Charles A., if only "close reading" could be for pleasure.
How would we name it?

3.
Within the hallowed halls if prophylactic theory promotes
safe texts and declining intimacy, our loneliness may not
be quelled through explication.  Brooks and Warren are
at peace and the students don't read, agreed, but the
spirit of "close readings" climactic S&M mastery over
the poem lingers.

4.
"I can't read this poem; I don't understand it at all."

Sure if anecdotal evidence of an authoritarian effect
of close readings ethic of closure.

5.
Good to talk about the "pleasures" of "textually intimate"
readings. Of course the risk of accumulating first a mass
and then a theory.

In fact to talk so (as some have begun to do)
would perhaps bridge the gap (an imagined gap
as Ron Silliman (will the real Ron please stand up)
demonstrates in various theoretical yet intimate
readings in _New Sentence_) between the two
threads on this list and between theory and
"just reading the poem."

5b.
Just Do It?

6.
Pleasure this week of hearing Ric Caddel (from NE England)
read and give a reading of Bunting, an intimate reading
complete with overhead projector that gave intimate
elucidation, made it possible to hear with the ears

7.
Suppose the theory monolith has turned the academy's ears
away from particulars of reading, strayed from the text
ye little lost lambs; causal--coincincident correlation with
with the fading of poetry (however read, misread, or unread-but-
theorized in the past) in general from the sanctified syllabi?

Charles ("Alexander"):
re re close reading and ears ("they fling their speech by means of it" &
etc?):
agreed, very much, that courses in close reading don't teach ear
possession (which I think I said or meant to say): I dunno whether I
learned my poetry ear at Monk's knee (though Wallace Shawn has a great
Monk story) or not, or whether, finally, you did--that may be a
romanticized account--but I do agree I didn't learn mine in grad school.
Going to grad school I instead felt by and large that those professing
didn't have much to teach me since I had developed my ear by writing (and
reading, in a non-academic contxt--Cantos on way to teach elementary
school on long subway rides to Brooklyn w refugees from the all night
Third World Club etc etc--though some notable exceptions, re different
KINDS of poems I wasn't equipped to hear having cut teeth or whatever on
Olson's earnestness--so mannerism had to be TAUGHT.  NEVER the less
sitting there in classroom with both 1) PhD students whose ears are full
of lead, AND have never been taught even the most rudimentary elabling
terminology for poetry explication (strange but true) AND w CW students
(MFA) some of whom are very good poets BUT, I continue to be intrigued by
the notion that in some basic way I might get some/several of them by
term's end to be seeing/doing something they are not doing yet.
and I guess here wd be the gist: if I can't do THAT, then what on earth
am I doing at the more "advanced" levels talking about Ashbery and
Baudrillard, or Charles B and Benjamin, or whtever I think I do: I mean
they are then simply not operating on a level where what I take for
granted as enabling details are even within their perceptual pardon the
expression universe.

meanwhile, having helped me teach a course here (there; where: Tucson) a
few years ago, you would I hope exempt my ear from general
professorial
ineptitude as I would exempt yours from whatever.  Or we could play
Duelling Ears?

meanwhile a VERY hearty assent to Ron Silliman's assertion or whatever that:

                          But I would love to hear Ed or Don explicate
the authoritarian impulse they feel lurks behind the practice.
McA, I've always felt that the turn away from close
reading via theory was a diminution of theory itself. We're all
impoverished thereby.

I'd add that the turn away from close reading has an authoritarian aspect
to it as well....

was I the one who brought students into it?  Sorry if so, I guess; am
busy teaching a close reading course to grad students for first time is
why, I guess.
but: the sort of non-academic or non-instructorish obsessive weird
hovering over details of a text. P. Quartermain, is just what I had in
mind by bringing students in: whatever I think it is I did sitting on
subways as a would-be writer reading Pound and Olson obssessively, has
NOTHING (almost) to do w what any of my students do, so far, when they
read poems and write on them, in the sense that their habits of attention
by and large are incredibly clotted up w Big Ideology questions--or
perhaps as non-writers mostly getting weened or warned in the academy of
the 80s-90s they are being offered a whole set of questions which while
meant to supplement close reading skills are instead replacing them
wholesale (cf. Kenner on EP and foibles of presumed "classical education"
as background "which he proceeded to modify" in ABC & etc.).
anyway I was just responding to I don't anymore remember whose suggestion
that close reading was authoritarian, w the suggestion or perception or
grouse that dealing w students makes me feel just the reverse: that
quirky attention to quirky details would in fact be whatever the
non-twelve-step word for "enabling" used to be.....

Subject:      more on close reading

        In a lecture I once heard on tape, a terrific Rutgers University left
political theorist, Stephen Bronner, talked about artworks as having
"internal dynamics" and "external dynamics," both of which deserve
consideration. He attributed the phraseology, which I have found really
helpful, to a contemporary German philosopher whose name I'd have to look up.
 As I understand it, the major critique of New Criticism's way of close
reading is that it too often ignored the external dynamics of poems--the
relationship of texts to important matters (historical events, human lives,
political ideologies, etc.) outside the text.
        In so doing, the New Critics priveleged certain poetic elements (e.g.
textual ambiguity and indeterminacy), and unfairly marginalized others (e.g.
more determinate explorations, often radical explorations, of the social
world). In *Repression and Recovery*, Cary Nelson does a good job of looking
at poetry from the first half of the 20th century that was marginalized by
New Critical standards, without denying the quality of the poetry which New
Critics championed. It seems to me that, by considering both internal and
external dynamics, it becomes easier to talk about the literary value, as
well as the radical potential, of a wider range of poetic styles.

   Another related issue it seems Peter Quatermain and Sandra Braman and

   Increasingly, it's becoming obvious that, although I certainly do not
   wish for a narrow and restrictive canon, that as a teacher the idea
   of teaching less poems (or whatever) or more SHORTER ones probably is
   more effective FOR ME (if not for everyone) in the classroom...Last
   semester i spent a week and half on one Ashbery poem and people would
   have most likely got not nearly as clear an understanding had I devoted
   that time to say 5 or 6 of his poems. I also devoted a whole class to
   a very short Weiners poem and another one to a very short Fanny Howe
   poem (etc. etc.). Some say this is irresponsible, and though i do not

ok, i'm gonna be persistent and once again recommend that dissertation i
mentioned to those of you who are sweating out the implications of close
reading (which i sweat out myself):  margaret a. syverson, "the wealth
of reality: an ecology of composition" (university of california at san
diego, 1994)... syverson is attempting to take into account factors that
reach *beyond* the individual (i.e., the individual reader, writer, text)...

so from the diss., p. 31:

We need to discover *who* and *what* are the agents interacting in an
ecology of composition; how these agents organize themselves into a more
or less coherent whole---a word, a sentence, a poem, a literary genre,
a collaborative writing group, a movement such as "romanticism" or
"modernism"; how they situate themselves; how they interpret their
environments; and how they use their interpretations to engage in
purposeful activities and interactions.  And specifically, we need to
better understand how composing systems are *distributed, embodied,
emergent, and enactive* across physical, social, psychological, temporal,
and spatial dimensions.

anyway... though syverson's rhetoric may strike some of you as functionalist,
fact is the strength of her READINGS (close? intimate? or distant? systemic? or
both? etc.) of (again) reznikoff, a collaborative student essay, and a flame
war convince me that there is something valuable in her 'approach'...

Tenney, you are absolutely right to take me to task. In some sense I
learned ear from father reading poetry to me, and from constant reading,
with a sense of sounding, from an early age. Yes, Monk helped, as did
various other sources, but most likely I could never have heard Monk
without having heard much else before. My guess is there's some strange
sources that went into this ear, including southern baptist preaching,
Tennessee Ernie Ford (a paternal favorite) & more.

Yes, I exempt your ear from criticism directed at the professorial realm,
although I exempt it after hearing your poetry & hearing you talk about
poetry informally over the years -- I can't entirely remember if concepts
of sounding and hearing came up in the class I helped you teach (my
couple of hours against your dozens of hours in that class, which I
enjoyed, and which, I remember, had a few ears in it).

Merton Sealts (Melville critic) oversaw my graduate teaching experience,
and commented that he thought what I did best for the students was read
poems aloud. I was shocked to think that other beginning level (this was
a freshman sophomore intro to lit class on 19th & 20th century lit -- one
century each semester) teachers (grad & faculty) did not do this.

Subject:      History of Close Reading

Like many others, I did encounter "close reading" as a shared
presumption amoung the critics who are lumped together under "New
Criticism." It seems to me that the most important document that
encouraged "close reading" was I. A. Richards's PRACTICAL CRITICISM.
For Richards, this was a revolutionary and experimental way to
proceed--he gave copies of poems to Cambridge University students, or
attendees at his elctures, who were supposed to know a lot about
poetry. He found that many could not look at a poem and see what was
there in front of them. He found that the elite were not very bright,
unable to talk about a poem unless they already knew something about
the poet and had learned the right things to say.

Richards's experiment paralleled the teachings of T. E. Hulme and
Pound, the emphasis on the sharp, clear, image. Later, along came all
the careful explications of poems; Donne was read with understanding
by many people for the first time in hundreds of years. To read Donne
you have to keep your nose to the page.

After neing trained in this "New" thing, I discovered that the French
had been doing it in their lycees and universities for years. It was
known as explication de texte.

But to learn to read poetry this way makes it almost impossible to
read poetry that requires that the reader submit to a vague
evocativeness. For example, you have F. R. Leavis's famous demolition
of Shelley's "Ode to the West Wind. " You cannot read Shelley that
way. You have to read Shelley as if he were at least part Language
Poet. That is even more true of certain poems by Rossetti, William
Morris, and Swinburne. You have to loosen up. One cannot study clouds
with a microscope. The same is true of good Language Poetry. And of
many French Symbolist poems. Gerard de Nerval and much Mallarme.
Poetry can be many things, but vague evocativeness has been out of
fashion for a long time, perhaps because a hundred years ago there
was entirely too much of it. Funny how at the same time there was too
much overt didacticism--which the New Criticism also disdained, and
which the Beats and the anti-war poets of the sixties and seventies
brought back in.

or so it all seems to me

derek owens, _resisting writings (and the boundaries of composition)_
(southern methodist up, 1994)...

derek's book is the only one i know to situate writing instruction over

brossard, etc... the pluralism he calls for is, imho, a welcome relief
from so much in comp. studies that relegates "creative writing" to
reductively expressivist theories...

    Some Late Additions:

    We have added two panels to the conference schedule, names of the
  panels and their chairs to be announced. The conference will thus
  begin on the morning of Thursday, June 1st.  We're in the process
  of notifying those whose papers have been chosen for a panel. We're
  now working out the scheduling of panels and other conference
  events, and we'll publish a conference/festival programme when we
  have these details worked out.  I'll post the programme information
  on this list at the same time.  Inquiries can also be sent to me at
  cwatts.sfu.ca.  If you have sent us a proposal (and you're wondering
  what happened to it), we should be able to let you know whether or
  not it has been accepted for a panel in about a week's time. Please
  be patient: the process of selecting panelists has been complex and
  lengthy, but some remarkable panels are coming out of it.

Subject:      close reading

I've thoroughly enjoyed the postings of the last several days.  I
find the list taking more and more of my time, but I am learning and
engaged.  Thanks to all.

When I was at the conference in Louisville, it was great to meet a
number of you that I'd had only known via e.

Of the current discussion, probably winding down?, on close reading,
I wanted to raise a related issue.  Peter had asked what would be the
opposite of close reading.  Inattentive reading?  Non-intensive
reading?  As others have pointed out, the allegedly conservative
nature of close reading has to do with its institutionalization via a
textbook:  Understanding Poetry.  (It's my mpression, that Jed
Rasula's forthcoming? just released? book will discuss this history.)
In my opinion, recent theory "advances," particularly those stemming
from deconstruction, have, in a different context, reiterated "close
reading" methodologies, but with much greater play and with different
metaphysical stakes.

But the issue that I would like to raise is the relationship of close
reading to theme-based reading.  It seems to me that much close
reading ultimately gets down to a process of unification of the
explanation of the poem by means of a thematized understanding.
While much (most? all?) newer/innovative/experimental (take your
pick) poetries have to one degree or another overthrown such habits
of unification and closure, many discussions of poetry end up
defending "new" poetries as having rather traditional modes of
meaning (as theme).  As various of y'all have pointed out, cultural
and contextual readings DO lead in different directions (and sometime
away from a close consideration of that great new critical polestar,
the text itself).  But even so, especially in the domain of the
multicultural, many readings boil down to assertions about "content"
(a close cousin of "theme").

In one of my poems in Doublespace, I had written that to be
"thematized is demonized."

Is close reading inevitably tied to "theme"?  Is "thematizing"
inevitably associated with retro modes of mastery--a kind of
strip-mining of the text?

More later.

>From a student's point of view...reading one or two shorter poems and
discussing them for an entire class (or more) can be much more effective than
parsing longer works.  Although part of this is because I started as an
engineering major and have an attention span accordingly...i find it easier to
become intimate with a shorter work, especially when the author or style is new
to me.  After I get a couple pages into a poem i start to remember less and
less, and have more trouble discussing and understanding the discussion of the
work.

Subject:      Lobbying for the NEH/NEA (fwd)

A message some of you may not have seen.  Gabrielle

Tell me if I'm steaming up the airways...

---------- Forwarded message ----------
I'd like to share with all of you a letter I received this week. I wonder if
 you will find it as disturbing as I did.  Because of my participation in the
NEH Summer Seminars for Teachers (I studied William James' _Varieties of
Religious Experience_ at FSU last summer), I'm on the NEH mailing list, and
this week I got a letter from NEH which said, in part, the following:
"In recent testimony before the House Interior Appropriations Subcommittee
former Chairman of the NEH William J. Bennett singled out the Summer Seminars
for School Teachers as an example of one of the ways the NEH has had 'a
deleterious effect on our culture.' This criticism was unexpected. Nothing we
have seen in the program's thirteen years of existence had suggested that
these seminars were anything other than successful by any measure."

The letter went on to ask former seminar participants to comment on the
validity of the criticism based on our experience. It also included the text
of Mr. Bennett's comments on the subject, and those are what I really want
you to see, since you may not have been aware of them. Mr. Bennett, by the
way, is also the author of the bestselling _Book of Virtue_. Here is what he
had to say about the seminars in a general attack on NEA and NEH:

"...how could the two Endowments hope to serve a larger civic role when they
have not improved the quality of the arts and humanities since 1965? There is
no question in my mind that things have gotten much worse in these realms
during the last three decades.. Some of the dominant movements that have
swept through the arts and humanities world include the radical nihilism of
post-modern art; homosexual and lesbian self-celebration; Marxism;
neo-Marxism; radical feminism and multiculturalism; deconstructionism; and var
ious manifestations of political correctness.
"When I was chairman of th National Endowment for the Humanities, at my
direction the NEH staff, in order to counteract some of the modish projects
that were swamping NEH, devised a summer program where high school teachers
would devote themselves to the study of a single great work of philosophy,
literature, or history. The program worked admirably the first year ...[but]
by the third it was obvious that this program was going the way of all the
others. The books were being Marxised, feminized, deconstructed, and
politicized. High school teachers, far from being exposed to "the best which
has been taught and said in the world" (in Matthew Arnold's phrase), were
being indoctrinated in the prevailing dogmas of academia."

Among other things, I resent the implication that high school teachers, some
of the best educated and, frankly, most opinionated people I know, can be
unwillingly "indoctrinated" into anything in a few weeks of classwork. Further
more,  I think that Bennett has a naive view of culture if he believes that
encounters with  the "dominant movements of thought" of one's milieu  can or
should be avoided by thinking people. The Declaration of Independence is a
product of a "dominant movement" of eighteenth century thought, for God's
sake! And, while one would probably not want to adopt any of them as the
whole of one's philosophy of life, and one might indeed have valid grounds
for rejecting their theoretical bases, the movements he mentions, such as
multiculturalism, gay self-celebration, and feminism, have contributed much
to humanizing our culture and have produced _some_ excellent scholarly work.

I think a valid case could be made (in terms of the proper role of
government, for example)  for the dropping of federal funding for NEH and
NEA, but the idea that such funding should be discontinued because of the dele
terious effects of those agencies' programs on our culture is ludicrous.
People and cultures are nourished, not diminished, by knowledge and the
challenge of new ideas and fresh thought.

From:   IN%"Chersav@aol.com" 21-FEB-1995 14:20:35.92
Subj:   RE: Lobbying for the NEH/NEA ...

I'm writing in response to the question of why funding the NEA is important.
 I am a poet, and have been a recipient of NEA money in several different
ways during the course of my career.  I am working class, the first of my
family to go to college out of high school (my father did go to college
nights over the course of 15 years, and finally got a degree the year I
graduated from high school).  People in my community mostly worked in
factories or in the trades.  When I found myself writing poetry, it was not
out of an academic tradition, but rather out of the desire to tell stories
that I could not find in the literature, stories of working class people.  My
heritage is mixed blood, French-Canadian and Abenaki.  Again, not found in
the literature.  My writing is not a matter of fashion or aesthetic play, but
has to do with cultural survival, of being represented in the literature.

My training as a poet was not in MFA programs, but in the community, and with
the generosity of older poets such as Etheridge Knight and Sam Cornish -
poets who were working in the communities, sometimes receiving some funding
from the city/state that dribbled down from NEA sources.

I worked for several years as a writer-in-residence in public schools in
Massachusetts.  What does that mean, exactly?  I taught three or four
creative writing classes a day, in programs that lasted from one day to
several months at one site.  I did readings of my own work and that of other
contemporary poets, bringing poetry as a living tradition into the classroom,
reading poets who were writing out of the students' own communities, latino,
african-american, arab-american, Native American, Asian American, as well as
poets from the Anglo tradition, and poets in translation from all over the
world.

It was important to students that I was a real person in the community,
telling stories about my own community and life.  When I was a child, no one
ever told me that my stories were important, worthy of literature.  I know my
example encouraged students to see their own lives and stories as important,
as well as introducing them to the vitality of poetry, and encouraging their
skills as writers.  Students in my workshops were drawn from all populations,
not from honors or "gifted" programs, and teachers were often amazed (though
I was not) at the writing done by students with fair or poor academic
records.  Every residency also included teacher workshops, where I shared
ways of teaching poetry and creative writing, and introduced teachers to
contemporary poetry they were not familiar with.  These artist-in-residence
programs were largely funded with money from the NEA.

In 1990, I was awarded a Fellowship from the Massachusetts Artists
Foundation, a $10,000 award.  This was funded largely by NEA money.  This
award allowed me to take the time needed to finish my first book of poetry,
which was accepted for publication by a small press that receives, you
guessed it - funding from the NEA.

With a book out, I was eligible to apply for a Fellowship from the NEA.
 Individual Fellowships are granted to artists in the amount of $20,000,  and
in 1993, was awarded a Fellowship from the NEA.  The award gave me the time
needed to work on a second book of poetry, which will be out this spring.
 The award has also been seen as a credential, and I with that and my
publication record, I have begun teaching on the college and university
level.

Without NEA funding, I would have done next no work in the schools - I simply
wouldn't have been able to afford it. (As it was, the most I made as a
writer-in-residence during the years 1985-1992, working four to five days a
week from early October to June, was $12,000  - well under the beginning
salary of public school teachers - and I was considered one of the busy and
successful artists in the program.  This of course, is before taxes and
without any benefits.  I would say the community was getting it's money's
worth and then some.  It's important also to understand that all money
received by artists is considered and taxed as regular income, so those
$20,000 dollar grants actually amount to approx $13,000.  When you see the
figures allotted to the arts remember they are highly inflated by these
omissions.)  Without NEA funding it would have taken me much longer to get my
first book in print, if indeed, I did it at all.

The impact of a Fellowship in the arts is more than just monetary, it is a
great affirmation of the importance of one's work.  As the arts are so
undervalued in our society, it is crucial to have one's work affirmed.  This
is especially true for the beginning artist, but is true for artists
throughout their career.  Poets are not generally paid for writing their
poetry.  They're paid for teaching writing, doing readings, teaching
literature, and sometimes though rarely, for editorial work.  Receiving a
fellowship is one of the few times when a poet/writer/artist is told: just do
the work.  That is invaluable.

For a working class artist, who does not automatically have the support of a
university environment, the NEA support is crucial.  For marginalized
communities, who are by definition under-represented, the NEA support is
crucial.  Many of the small journals that are publishing some of the most
vital writing going on in America are NEA funded.  Literary writing has been
largely pushed out of the trade publishers.  Without NEA funds, many small
presses would fold.  If you care about literature, you should care very much
about NEA funding.

The move is to push all funding into private foundations.  This system moves
money away from the working class and marginalized communities, to where it's
least needed.  It encourages a good ol' boy system of grant-giving. (I knew
no writers on the panels of any funding organization that has given me moeny,
so I know it is possible to be funded without being part of a good ol' boy
network.) Public funding is crucial.  The benefits do not end with the
individual artists, but reverberate throughout the community.

I hope others on the Net will share stories of how NEA and NEH funding has
effected them, programs they've been a part of, or know about, etc.  Please
forgive the haste with which this note was written, as I'm doing it on line.

"External dynamics" is perhaps a more expressive way of referring to what
most of us have been calling "context" for lo thesemany years.  I heard
Cleanth Brooks years ago stand up at an English Institute meeting at
which the New Criticism was being slammed, and say strongly if in a
rather quavery voice that it had never been his intention, or that of
anyone he knew, to ELIMINATE considerations of biography, history, etc.,
(that is, context, or "external dynamics").  They merely wished to call
fresh attention to the specificities of the language(s) of poems, since
those were being badly neglected.
I very much like the notion of close reading as simply a subset of paying
attention.  Anything can be TAUGHT tyrannically, but there is nothing
INHERENTLY tyrannical in being urged to be more aware.  On the contrary.

1a. Close reading, closet reading, closet reading, closed reading. Do
we impale texts or are they, constituted as texts, offered within a
defintion of closure, as closed?

2a. Galloping toward singularity but for a single "reader," no? Is not
the singularity (or single array of possibilities) particular to this
reader and only trots to "resolution" when a singularity is imposed on
others? As to pleasure, it is true in fact that tidying up is a
pleasure to some. Does the text differ from a disorderly kitchen?

3a. Yes, possibly the pressure of history. Hallowed halls, etc., have
taken their toll and do cast their monolithic shadows by restricting
textual terrain. Does close reading equal explication?  The former is
a kinder phrase but carries the tenor of the latter. Is it my
schooling? Did anyone get graded on explication? Does this mean there
is a right answer? Time for a little alto?

4a. Maybe not an ethic of closure but a fear of elevation? Is not any
"formal" writing elevated? If it's not, "Hey, buddy, can you spare a
rhyme," then what is the entry point for someone not conversant with
the conventions of the elevation? Walk for ten minutes then rest
five...

5a. The mass _does_ turn to theory and this perhaps is the most
difficult moment. (Some might say after theory it continues to a
consumer product.) But this is not "theory" as a district attorney (we
are speaking about law here) would use the word rather the fear of
imposed consent. But do not our means of production offer a route out?
Or am I under a delusion?

6a.  At the reading thinking - this was a break away from what
constantly overwhelms me: daily work - "What I need to hear is some
elevated language." (Also dialect.) And boy did I need to hear some
elevated words. It _is_ elevated: physically, of course, there is a
stage - in this case a podium. But the reading voice offers words that
are _set_. That is, written in some other frame of place and activity,
transported, and delivered as if encased, framed, "on the crispest
sheet of white paper," I think I noted. Setting up the dilemma perhaps
instantly.

7a. Most probably that the monolith has penetrated through original
texts to secondary and the teriary. For the syllabi of the lambs a
lullaby. If poetry were to fade from the academy should it not be
carried on by word of mouth? Is _any_ comment on text theory? Or
close?

Subject:      Re: Form

I really liked Bill Luoma's description of his compositional process when
writing My Trip to NYC.  I'd never heard of this work, but I'll be on the
lookout for it from now on.  That sense  of the wonderful accident, followed
by the fear one will never be able to repeat the moment; not knowing how it
happened, the feeling if one only knew it could be repeated, but then knowing
that each new text creates each own success story as it were;
unreproduceability part of the uniqueness of the text, its genius--don't mean
for this to become blather, but the uncertainty Luoma describes struck me as
exactly right, or exactly my own experience.

I'm a fiction writer, so-called, but very influenced in my writing process by
Olsonian "field" notions, every moment in the writing a new decision in a
continually revised field, ever reformulating itself with each new decision.
 Yeah, when it works, there's nothing like it, but it also leads to a lot of
garbage.  But it's the way I write, I can't do it any other way, a fact which
has come clearer to me as I've been working on a so-called novel.  I tried to
figure out a plot, even if just to get me another step into the book.  But I
found as soon as started trying to follow it, I'd mess it up.  Intentionally.


In prose, there's the example of Poe, who said that everything should be
figured out to the least little detail before ever setting pen to paper.  I
used to think Poe was making it up, perversely creating a counter-myth to
prevailing romantic theories of composition.  I don't think so anymore (about
Poe) but it's still a very foreign method to my own.  I get too bored with
just filling in the blanks of a pre-planned piece.  Nor do I think lively
writing can be accomplished unless there's a sense it's renewing itself all
the time, turning over and over again.

I forget who said it, but I've also found oulipo-style formally rigorous
experiments engender work well.  Again, at times.  "Either it works or it
doesn't," as I seem to recall Spicer saying somewhere.  But knowing you only
get so many lines here, so many there, and letting that become something that
hadn't been there before is a nice way of having constant and variant, that
play between which can be fruitful.

Now, in this "novel," I am working one episode at a time.  I have a loose
idea of where I'm going, but want no more than that because when I do, like I
said, I fuck it up.  I'm also reading a lot, letting ideas or even just
images set me off.  I remember hearing once (it may be apocryphal, and I'd
like to be corrected by someone with better information) that in Olson's
library, volumes would have copious notes, starting in the beginning and up
until a certain point, where the marginalia would just stop. Presumably this
is where he'd start writing.  I'm committed to a long form on this work
though, and its tru I do have some tricks I'm keeping around for later (but
it's also true they might not fit; they're in the field as I see it now, but
may be abandoned later).  I'd like to hear from people who have written
things that couldn't be completed in one sitting, or even a couple --
extended works -- yet are committed to a similar improvisatory approach.  I'm
suffering long droughts in between successful episodes.

can anyone help with a name, location?
I simply cannot remember who told me about a poet, at Fresno State, I
think, who is working on/with/ within the Volga Deutsch community in
Central California.  Anybody know?  I'd like to be in touch with this
person.  Believe she is a woman.
What a well of ignorance I am this late evening.  This query
is prompted by the death of another of my fast disappearing and
tangle-rooted or rhizomatic family leaves.  Never thought I'd be
rooting around in this a/A/ohm-poetics.
Sorry to break into the meditation onclose reading which y'll are
pounding out.  Thanks indeed for the enlivening discourse, of course.

I was delighted to read some of the "close reading" commentaries triggered
by Peter Quartermain's great query, especially Tenney Nathanson's because
I've had the identical experience.
The fear of close = closed which began as a needed response to the New
Criticsm (which, incidentally, performed mostly thematic rather than really
close readings) has now produced the opposite: students confronted by, say,
Beckett or Aime Cesaire, ignore what's on the page and jump off to some
ideological position.  When asked why a line breaks in a certain place or
what the relationship of some item to another is, they are absolutely at
a loss because no one has ever asked them to just plain really read or
reread, that is look empirically at what's actually there, materially. So
I'm delighted that the tide is finally turning, as it seems to be judging
from this week's discussion.

Subject:      close reading

Hank's question about the thematizing of close reading prompts
me to make a point which partly echoes Keith Tuma's posting of
earlier this week.  though 'experimental criticism' allows, or
anyway tries to allow, for uncertainty, for embracing 'the
inadequacy of our explanatory paradigms' (Charles B's
=Artifice=), the majority of =published= readings of literature
aims -- must aim, for respectability if not for very
publishability -- to demonstrate that its readings & therefore
its conclusions are the BEST way of seeing particular texts.
(which seems to come, in some dark past way, from religious
methods of textual explication: in order for us to be right,
everyone else has to be wrong, but must also have to do with
the human desire to have a right answer, & to be the one who
provides it.)
        that's obvious enough, but it made me think that the
academy has two types of close reading: one publishable and one
pedagogical (or speculative, say).  the latter may be the realm
of free play, the one we happily teach to students, the 'isn't
it interesting to consider what happens when we pay attention
to these lines in this way'; but the former is still mostly
stuck in the justifying, & therefore almost inevitably
thematizing (line 'meanings' lead to poem 'meanings' lead to
thematic meanings lead to historical, contextual, &c meanings,
to sew up everything), mode of close reading, the one in which
'when we say of something that it is true, we say that it has
stopped' (to use Alan Davies' formulation, in =Signage=, of how
static the notion of truth is for us moderns).
        the published realm of close reading, then, has an
off-putting rigidity, =historically=, while the pedagogical one
is a beautiful & permitting part of reading language.

isn't this fun?

if this discussion re close reading is polarized twixt 1) anything goes
and 2) only an unidentified number of "best" readings goes, then i guess
i'm forced into category 1... but as a member of same, i'd want to push
for a general recognition that "anything goes" is only a theoretical, or
better, hypothetical assertion... in (pedagogical, publishing, communal
and other) actuality, there are some "readings" that just ain't gonna
fly, period.

i do believe, further, that a few of the more professorial among us (tenney,
marjorie, myself), and not to privilege this latter category AT ALL, are
struck by how few rhetorical skills are actually learned by undergrads.
these days... for the sake of simplicity, let's just say that a general
level of syntactic awareness, say, constitutes a rhetoric (that is, that
grammatical analysis constitutes a rhetoric)... perhaps this is desirable
in some situations, undesirable in others... but to argue against same,
again, as a member of category 1 above, just doesn't make sense to me...
i.e., category 1 does not preempt the usefulness of this particular
rhetoric...

but to abandon my binary altogether:  i must confess to being somewhat
perturbed when faced with folks who are incapable? or just unwilling? EVER
to deal with a text in whatever terms "close reading" implies... just
kinda bugged, is all, and i certainly wouldn't want, esp. in these academic
climes, to position myself *agains* ideological readings... lord knows this
plays into the hands of some folks i'm in utter(ance) disagreement with...
that was *against*, of course, damn line editor... anyway, close reading
or not (of this post), you all follow me here i'm sure...

why not admit to the usefulness of close readings, however defined, at a
general rhetorical level?...

Subject:      more on close reading, theory, politics, etc.

Before I go off on different tracks, I'd like to ask those who've noted a
lack of undergrad ability to do close reading whether they think that
correlates with an increased student understanding of history, current
events, political theory & other matters of social context, or whether they
find it part of a more overarching crisis in U.S. education? I'm also
assuming there are many thousands of exceptions, am I too naive?
        Regarding close reading, Kathe Davis wrote: "Anything can be TAUGHT
tyrannically, but there is nothing INHERENTLY tyrannical in being urged to be
more aware."
        I totally agree. (Perhaps contemporary critics exaggerate the New
Critics' lack of concern for social context? Were New Critics also
exaggerating predecessors' lack of attention to textual matters?) Overall, I
don't really think any particular style of literary criticism, nor any
particular style of poetry for that matter, is inherently progressive or
reactionary. For instance, among deconstructionist literary critics, as among
the modernist poets, politics ranges from democratic left to fascist. I think
we always have to try to avoid *a priori* assumptions based merely on form or
style, and take an actual look at the particular work (again, both its
internal & external dynamics) & make a case for our reading or judgment of
it.
        (Re the matter of attaching inherent political qualities to literary
styles, let me begin to walk out on what is definitely a tangent & possibly a
limb...) I think one tendency that can lead to imposing *a priori* political
labels, often used to dismiss certain styles of criticism or poetry
out-of-hand, is a tendency to conflate conceptual categories. This seems
pretty common today.  One of my favorite contemporary examples is the
post-structuralist theorist, Lyotard's (highly influential, I think)
conflation of the philosophical concept of totality with the political system
of totalitarianism. Besides conflating categories, that equation also seems
mistaken on the practical level, since the concept of totality was used
(among others) by some marxist thinkers who were clearly theorizing the
extension of democracy into all spheres of public life (e.g. extending
democratic rights to the working class) to ensure that no leaders could
remain unaccountable or outside the rule of law & in order to safeguard
diversity. As Daniel Singer has pointed out: during Rosa Luxemburg's day,
using the phrase "democratic socialism" would have been like saying "buttery
butter." No matter what other disagreements one might have with some of
these theorists (e.g. problems with teleology, orthodoxy, etc.), many were
clearly working for a *more* democratic society, not a less democratic
one--and it seems silly to blame these theories of extending democracy for
the eventual and often-horrific development of "actually existing socialism"
in the Soviet bloc.
        (Walking further out toward the limb's edge?...) This conflation of
categories also seems to me to occur in some language poetry theory where
traditional narrative & syntax structures are sometimes conflated with the
rules of the existing state--rules that interconnect with language
structures, of course, but that aren't reducible to language structures. (I'd
appreciate corrections here, since I'm still trying to learn this stuff...)
In this argument, as I understand it, breaking the dominant rules of syntax
(or creating non-narratives or anti-narratives in Jerome McGann's
formulation) is seen as an inherently radical act. But it seems to me that
both narratives and anti-narratives can be used for different purposes--both
potentially able either to help promote notions of progressive social change
or to help protect the status quo. (Re the latter, I think of TV commercials
that appropriate techniques of modernist juxtaposition; corporate paper
shredders; government documents & speeches that are filled with huge gaps in
narrative & logic, sometimes foregrounding language at the expense of
content, in order to mystify the public or maintain plausible deniability;
etc.)  I think part of the tendency among poets (myself included) & literary
theorists to conflate conceptual categories (esp. the literary & the
political) is the result of some part of us hoping that our writings might by
themselves transform the often-distressing political reality of our day.
        But, as much as I wish as a poet that I could believe in "magic
bullet poems," or, more to my political preference, "magic nonviolent civil
disobedience poems," or even "magic post-structuralist deconstuction of
oppressive state apparatus poems"; and as much as I think terrific poems
often derive a good deal of their energy from their attempt to achieve such a
magic transgressive political ability;  it seems to me more helpful & honest
to think (heuristically) of categories like poetry, politics, economics, etc.
as distinct spheres that interrelate in complex and mediated ways--i.e.
spheres that are not conflated but not autonomous either. The fun &
challenging part then is to explore the ways they do (& might possibly)
interrelate under  particular (past, present or future) circumstances. For
example, one can consider ways in which particular poems might interconnect
with social context by raising an audience's political consciousness,
inspiring alternative ways of thinking, urging commitment, offering shrewd
historical critique, envisioning healthier social reconstructions, etc.  I
don't think contextualizing precludes "close reading," since I don't really
think it's possible to talk about a poem's relation to social context without
looking at the text's internal dynamics. Poems, then,  written in a wide
variety of forms and styles, including poems that explode traditional syntax
& also poems that use traditional syntax, can potentially be seen to contain
emancipatory elements which a reader or critic (using a variety of critical
styles) can draw out. That doesn't mean that all poems will contain
emancipatory elements, but just that one has to be open-minded enough about
questions of form & style to actually look.
        One nice thing about avoiding the conflation of literature & politics
is that different criteria for evaluating poetic and political realms become
possible. (I guess I feel post-structuralism & langpo theory have done a
valuable job in helping to correct what may have been an overly determinate
way of  reading literary texts, but added a not-very-helpful overly
indeterminate criteria for judging politics.) Poetry is free to eXpeRimeNt
without getting called petit-bourgeois, too esoteric (or too didactic) or
some such *a priori* label often meant to dismiss a poem so that one doesn't
need to read it. (Poetry is also free to explore lots of areas besides
politics, and also to offer pleasure, etc.) At the same time, more
determinate and normative judgments are possible in the realm of politics in
order to arrive at (to even debate) bases for united actions, common
principles & platforms, agreed-upon strategies & democratic structures,
etc.--all the stuff required to build the sort of organized political
movements that are ultimately needed (along with raised public consciousness)
to create lasting radical, truly democratic & egalitarian social change.
        Sorry for the ridiculous length of this post. I'll go back to sitting
on the sidelines for awhile.
Sincerely, E. Katz

(If anyone's interested, re my last post, Stephen Bronner attributes the
internal dynamic & external dynamic phraseology to an Austrian philosopher,
Max Adler, whose book in German on Marx and Kant hasn't yet been translated
into English.)

Marjorie Perloff refers to the difficulty of students in talking why the
line breaks where it does, where something is placed on a page and what
that means, and the like. I have wanted, in reent years, to turn a part
of the discussion concerning poems to their contexts. For me, as a
bookmaker as well as reader & writer, this means the physical context.
That may mean that everything the author puts in the work has a meaning,
which is particularly evident in recent readings of Emily Dickinson's
manuscripts. But is authorial intention everything? What about choice of
paper/type/spacing? What about sky poems? What about poems in public
places? What about the sound of the page turning? Is there such a thing
as the physicality of meaning? These issues are certainly crucial to the
book arts and to the design arts (not the same thing, by any means), and
both of these arts may be in partnership with literary texts in various
ways. Is there any reality to the literary text outside its actual
physical manifestation? If so, what, and is that different than the
physical presence, and that would be exciting to talk about as well.

I'm afraid I have many more questions than answers here, but I do wonder
if these are issues others wish to talk about. And is this just an
extension of close reading?  really close reading . . .

 1. I,too, thought Marjorie (hello, Marjorie) had particulars in mind. Not
    absolutes, and yes some of the writing which engages me because of its
    relation to my own writing concerns draws 'the support' into the text.

 2. Close reading. Have we yet had information on the origin of the
    phrase? Who, if anyone, used it first for the purposes we think we
    recognise?

 3. Close reading is not close listening. The New Critical education I
    received, which I have to say I am grateful for-- at l8 I was a pretty
    capable reader of Donne, of Stevens ...-- was entirely semantic in its
    approach. I only learnt to HEAR poetry later, and from the poet's read-
    ing work in public. There was no voice. And then I found out about the
    Formalists (Russians) who did listen, but no one at my graduate school
    knew anything of them.

 4. Other particulars: close reading in what context? Or, is it ONLY
    the classroom context that's at issue? I mean is the concept useful,
     meaningful, when discussing our own reading. At any rate, IF that's
    so, what of that context?  Among other things it is a place where
    good ideas get ruined. Including methods of reading. I remember Mel
    Bochner (remember Mel Bochner?) saying teaching was throwing fake pearls
    before real swine!

 5. A note re. theory. I'm for the close reading of theory, of for
     theoretical texts which demand it. (demand?)

My experiences teaching poetry were not unlike Marjorie's (hello, Marjorie).
None of the students had ever previously been expected to actually look
and listen to the poem and consider it own its own terms.  They were
all experienced at translating English into English (thematic discourse,
what the poet might have said if s/he had a more limited vocabulary
and a pressing desire to please an instructor) or they were eager
to place the work in a theoritical context and then discuss that
context rather than the poem.  They had all caught the mysterious fear
of poems disease from prior instructors.  I suggested that they read
poetry the same way they listen to music (college students listen to
a lot of music).  I was amazed, but this actually worked better than
I could have expected.  When presented with the poem as an experience,
and something with a event with the potential to alter perception, they related to it that
way.  The poem ceased to be a trick question on some future exam and
became a work that they could enter into.  I'm mentioning this because
when they realized that a poem was an act of language and they were
at liberty to be affected by it rather than jumping through somebody
else's hoops, they became fascinated by how the poem created that
effect, the mechanics of the piece.  When they figured out for themselves
in class how John Ashbery's line breaks work, you could almost literally
see the cartoon lightbulbs coming on as they explained it to each

I'm very much interested in pursuing what Charles Alexander has raised
beginning with physical context, and then listening and watching for all of
the "beyonds" that come from that.  There seem to be so many experiences
possible with the sharing of words and the ranges of intimacy or of widest
co-experiencing seem deliciously infinite.  It seems that as we increasingly
venture into the virtual, the more physical experiences (of, say, reading and
touching a beautifully made physical book) seem more to be savored. I guess
that what is happening for me is that simultaneously a multiplex of
experiences become possible.  And I need to be more fluent to be able to
appreciate as I'd like all the different way things reach me and the ways
that I might participate in these vehicles.  All the modes are different, no
one better or worse inherently, but each requiring  procedures, approaches
appropriate to it..

Add to that the challenges of an instructional setting, and the plot
thickens!  As all of the possibilities change, so have the students'
expectations/level of preparation/predispositions.

Thinking aloud on this one, simply.  Level of casualness about how a thing, a
word, a message is offered probably is connected to how it is valued, too,
further complicating the issue.

Well.  It's late enough.  I'm enjoying what I hear on the list more and more
these days.  Enriching.

Thanks, Charles, for bringing up the physical context (or manifestation)
of the poem as carrier of meaning. The first books of poetry I responded
to (after college) were those Kulchur Press editions, often with drawings,
cartoons, scrawled things, the books themselves of a particular bulk, very
"present" *as* books, without actually being (necessarily) "artists'
books." Looking back, I'm not so sure it was the poetry itself I was
enjoying so much (though I did, especially _Bean Spasms_ and _Album_) as
the fact that these books were not "transparent" in the way that many
(uniformly produced) books are. Reading _Defenestration of Prague_ in the
Kulchur edition (which I stupidly sold, thinking I'd re-find it) was more
of an experience, more memorable to me, than reading the piece in the Sun
& Moon reprint, "down-sized," uniform with most other S&Ms.  (Whether it
matters to Howe how the work appears or not.)
     Someone told me that Olson wrote, or at least "set,"  _Maximus_ for
the page, that his attention to the page as unit (at least in this
instance) was as intentional as that of his line. (Anyone with better
info, again, please jump in.) This person also told me that he thought the
poems could be reset for a smaller page (as in the New Directions
_Selected Writings_) with different, but equally satisfying effects.
Whether or not my friend's correct about Olson's intentions, it *is* a
wholly different effect reading the work IN LARGE in the UC edition.
     Then, of course, there are the people like Sir Walter Ralegh or
Donne, many of whose poems were, originally, scored as letters, were (so
I'm told) considered *published* as letters.  Publishing, in the strict
sense, was (again, so I'm told, please correct or expand) considered, by
some, "professional," & that in an almost purely derogatory sense.
     As much as I like it, I wonder sometimes, reading Frank O'Hara's
_Collected Poems_, if I'm not doing the poor guy something of a
disservice, that book seeming to exist in near- absolute opposition to
O'Hara's (another letter-poem writer) *intention* for those poems. But,
this was something that didn't come up for me until I'd found (very
luckily) first eds of _Love Poems (Tentative Title)_, _Lunch Poems_,
_Second Avenue_, the material he'd seen in print in his lifetime. That's
obviously speculation on my part, but it is true that reading these things
as "originally published" (already one step removed from hand or
typewriter), especially _Love Poems_, I get more of a sense of *how* he
was a "personal" poet (however tongue-in-cheek "Personism" may have been).
Much of what's most powerful in _Love Poems (Tentative Title)_ seems (to
me) washed out reading those same poems in the _Collected_. There's
something "authoritarian" about that giant book, an odd thing for someone
who'd put "(Tentative Title)" into a title of a published volume of poetry.
     So, yes, I do (personally) agree there's meaning in a poem's physical
manifestation. Poetry is largely "about" presence (even conscious attempts
to distance oneself from or remove altogether "ego"--well, that's an issue
of "presence"), so consideration of a poem's presence seems not only
perfectly valid, but worth further exploration.
     In a way--maybe something of a leap--some of the earlier posts about
community or lack thereof, about the nature of the poetry "world" itself,
seem equally germane with respect to considerations of poetry's "meaning."
Books of poetry, magazines, even discussions of poetry, never simply
"arrive."
     The question, I guess, might be: at what point do you lose rather
than gain in drawing in all of these other variables? I don't know, but
think the net can be larger than we often allow.

     Yours,

Most important, in what sense? Best to prop a window open with? Keeps a
fire burning longest, in which case the quality of the paper used may
plan a part?

My choices as a writer may be different than another's, certainly
different than someone else's as a teacher, & my choices as a bookmaker
may take into consideration limited editions which bring the visual into
the verbal in books of such small circulation that there may be none or
at most a few on this list who have seen them -- in my mind that makes
them no less "important" than an edition which sells 20,000.

Also it seems to me that only someone not particularly involved with
so-called Language Poetry would put the request in such a way. To poets
who make up the enlarged group, many of whom detest the moniker, our
reading of Beowulf or Christopher Smart may provide as much generative
energy as our reading of Rae Armantrout or Carla Harryman. I'd be more
interested in such lists which are expansive rather than reductive,
although I'll admit it might be nice to see a list or lists of people's
favorite ten little-known-but-once-discovered-not-to-be-missed tomes.

But "most important?" Read, she sd, and by all means DON'T look out where
yr going.

Gary, you are getting into rich territory concerning what it means "to
read," i.e. that there is always a context, and that certainly not
limited to the physical book or page, but yes, involving how one came to
the work, real people, and more. I don't have time to get into this
tonight, but wanted to say that I found your comments on O'Hara lovely
and stimulating. Also to add that even reading Olson in the big
California edition is a far cry from reading the original editions which,
while they don't gather as many pages, are printed on pages with more
bulk, with covers which have real texture, so that, altogether, they seem
to occupy more territory. This, too, would be quite different than coming
across those Olson poems in letters and manuscripts. But certainly one
reads into the New Directions Selected the black & white aesthetic of
that press, which seems quite foreign to Olson, and one reads into the
California edition, despite the spacious size of the book, a slick
jacketed university/corporate packaging, getting even farther from that
"excessively rough moraine" (Letter #41) which, in its bulky and shapely
manifestation, is the Olson I always hear (interesting how even the
physical book or context of reading remains, as do the texts, in one's
memory, which is where the work remains, as books are closed for more
than 99% of their lives).

Subject:      Re: Text and Sounds and Words and...

Two comments:

    One of the interesting things about poetry posted on the
net is that it can be downloaded and manipulated: fonts,
size, spacing, etc.  This allows the reader to be an active
reader, indeed.

     In the course of rereading some of Charles Olson's
work and writings I came across two items of interest.

1.)  In "Projective Verse" (_Poetry New York_, 1950)
he wrote: "If a contemporary poet leaves a space as
long as the phrase before.he means that space to be
held, by the breath, an equal length of time.  If he
suspends a word or syllable at the end of a line (this
was most cummings addition) he means that time to pass
that it takes the eye - that hair of time suspended -
to pick up the next line.  If he wishes a pause so
light it hardly separates the words, yet does not
want a comma - which is an interruption of the meaning
rather than the sounding of a line - follow him when
he uses a symbol the typewriter has ready to hand:
         "What does not change/is the will to change"
Observe him when he takes advantage of the machine's
multiple margins, to juxtapose:

                         'Sd he:
                            to dream takes no effort
                               to think is easy
                                  to act is more difficult

       but for a man to act after he has taken thought, this!
   is the most difficult thing of all'

Each of these lines is a progressing of both the meaning
and the breathing forward, and then a backing up, without
a progress or any kind of movement outside the unit of
time local to the idea.
     ...by this emphasis on the typewriter as the
personal and instantaneous recorder of the poet's
work...as though not the eye but the ear was to be
[poetry's] measure, as though the intervals of its
composition could be so carefully put down as to be
precisely the intervals of its registration.  For
the ear....can now again, that the poet has his means,
be the threshold of projective verse."

While skimming the 'form' discussion, wished to reiterate that there is an
obligation to engage at a =low level= (in the programmer's sense of the
term) with form as it is modulated by the technology which we are all now
using. Isn't it still the case that we accept these tools handed down to us
from on high and then continue to try and carry out our various forms of
piracy in the ways we are used to? Isn't there still too much simulation on
the literary net and not enough new form?

Now charles alexander's words prompt posting of a short piece written for
another context (general readership?):

[

The book is not just a physical object, the essential, definitive
icon of our material culture. It is the pre-eminent medium for the
storage and delivery of linguistic creation and information. As such
it is supremely effective and remarkably convenient. Books are
elegant and often beautiful. However, the book is also a metaphor
which may invoke any or all of its qualities in order to create new
ways of understanding the self. Everyone in the modern world, even
those people who share our culture but who were never or are no
longer people of the book, everyone must accumulate written paper
throughout their lives-- scraps, certificates, lists, deeds, forms,
letters, and so on -- and may sometimes long to see these fragments
organized, made sense of, bound together. For others this longing is
central to their existence. The book is, potentially, a body of
work, a summation of what you have to say and, finally, of what you
are. 'This book is my life's story, the sum of all I know. I put
everything into it, body and soul. It's my life itself, and before I
pass on I must close it, leaving it behind for others to read and
interpret.'

The meaning created by this metaphor is determined by the physical
characteristics of the book. This has not been static although its
predominant form -- the codex or collection of paper-like leaves
bound together so that it can be opened at any point -- has been
with us since the second century of our era. Book artists and others
have challenged this dominance, but however creative and inspiring
the resulting dialogue has proven, it has not undermined the shape
of the vital book-as-metaphor in our culture.

Now, later than many predictions would have led us to believe, the
book is changing. The word is applied to bodies of text which are
stored in electronic libraries, on the ever-spinning magnetic or
optical disks of programmable machines. Millions of these machines
are already linked on the InterNet. 'Books', 'libraries' -- the use
of these words, the inability to find others, demonstrates that the
irreducible, defining quality of a book is that it should be a body
of work recorded in language without regard to physical form. Thus
the metaphor survives but its shape and significance change forever.
There is no longer the sense that a book -- as electronic book -- is
bound or bounded, that you can see all of it at once, hold it, pick
it up, that it has a physical location. It is more difficult to
believe that the words of the book are fixed and stable, its
author's definitive statement on its subject. Although there is
general familiarity with the tools that conveniently allow us to
write and edit bodies of text, some people will be less content with
the realization that these same tools will allow others to
appropriate and even alter what they have created. Many will be
unwilling to apply a metaphor to themselves, as once they did, which
begins to suggest unboundedness, indeterminacy, openness to the
electronically interleaved books of anyone else on the InterNet.

The codex will live on. It is not a question of either or. Both old
and new books will coexist. Some writers and book-makers will wish
to explore new opportunities offered by the less familiar qualities
of unbound, coverless books. Some readers will welcome new ways of
understanding themselves in the ghostly, fragmentary, drifting
leaves of an evolving metaphor.

]

btw:
In one understanding Quakers quake at Friends' meetings (a metaphor for
these discussions?) as a physical manifestation of the tension,
vacillation, radical self-questioning which arises when a friend realizes
s/he has something to say in the context of profound silence.

Are you, virtually, quaking?

Subject:      Close Reading; Authoritarian?

Close reading certainly need not imply an authoritarian
interpretation of a text, but close readings which attempt to impose
something on the text which is not there certainly are
authoritarian--as are any readings which claim for themselves
exclusive and complete accountings of a poem.

If you give a group of people a poem, for example, Williams's "The
Yachts," to read closely, you will find that a certain number of them
agree that  it is about the Race of Life, the competitiveness
encouraged by American free enterprise, and the indifference of the
winners to the losers, the "horror of the race." But different
readers will express this in different ways and will see patterns of
imagery, transitions in point of view, rhythmic effects, sound
patterns, associations of all kinds. There is an authority, and the
authority is the poem itself, but any good poem is rich enough to
allow an immense variety of reponses. Some, for example, might even
point out that "The Yachts" starts, very uncharacteristically for
Williams, in terza rima--a form that he hoped to emulate with his
triadic, or "step-down", lines in later poems. But the rhyme pattern
is immediately abandoned and the poem itself seems a criticism of
established patterns of authority--the initial strict form being
emblematic of this.

But what about the person (this has actually happened) who thinks
that "The Yachts" is an account of a caesarian section? And adduces
evidence from the poem to prove this? Is that person flouting the
authority of the poem? Such a reading would, to me, seem
authoritarian and arbitrary and I would want to escape from that
reading and go back to a free perusal of the poem. Which, it seems to
me, is about what really goes into the creation of the yachts, how
"The Yachts / contend."

And there are good poems that close reading doesn't do much
for--poems that depend on evanescent, tangential, indirect, and
possibly musical effects.

Sheila,

Since this is related, would you mind maybe talking a little bit about
the form of your published booklet, _Criteria for Being Touched_? Was
this a collaborative project? I ask because the crayoned cover, and the
slip of sandpaper (is that what it is?) stapled to the back of the book,
and even the way you have to unfold the pages themselves to read the
poems, all seem to further engage your reader, forcing him/her to be
aware of "touching." I love what Jonathan Brannen says about getting his
students to be aware of the poem as an *experience*, and this, the way
your book was manifested, seems to help ensure a reader's fullest
participation with that work as experience.

At first, I'd thought it was the publisher's idea to do these things, but
I'm beginning to suspect that you'd been the one to do this. Could you
verify and, if you've time, expand? It's my favorite of the half-dozen or
so books of yours I have, would love to read what you might say about it.

Thanks,

Gary

Subject:      More in re context

When learning about Bach in music school, it was explained to me (& anyone
with better info, please correct or clarify) that keyboard instruments
were, by necessity, only *approximately* in key, not only with wind
instruments, but with themselves. (A low "G" not being quite "in key" with
a "G" higher up, & this on the same keyboard; to say nothing of how a
keyboard interrelated with previously extant instruments.) In a sense,
assuming that music on the page isn't music, but music's map, the map
itself, with the invention of the keyboard, became even further distanced
from the physical territory itself. The actual pitch of "G"--even a
"specific" "G" carefully drawn onto a specific place on the staff--would
be different depending on whether a keyboard or wind was playing it. (&
this doesn't even bring in timbre, accent, attack, etc.)
     To clarify the above, the keyboard literally "flattens" the notes as
you go up the scale.
     Interesting that the keyboard and the printing press were inventions
that both came into existence around the same time period. (Not sure which
came first, though I suspect it was the printing press.) In a way, what
the keyboard does to music (or, to "actual pitch") the printing press does
to the word, both written & spoken word. Published books do have a
"flattening" effect similar to that of music played on the keyboard.
     I was a terrible music student, but I took away from it this sense
that the meaning of work has everything to do with its "physical"
manifestation. So, reading poetry where everything hinges on the "meaning"
of the words themselves, where everything is focused down to
"language"--it's less satisfying to me. Meaning you can be didactic
without having anything, necessarily, to prove, or wanting to do that, but
by limiting yourself to an understanding of "meaning" in a poem being
determined solely by the words, the extent to which those words, taken
together, mean this or that.
     Charles, you are absolutely right to consider the context of the UC
printing of _Maximus_; I think so many of us (including myself) can be
very shortsighted, or blind, to all of the other levels of meaning
radiating from a published (however published) work. Whenever I review Sun
& Moon books, for example, for _City Pages_ or other journals, I want,
always, to say something about how the press itself goes about promoting,
or contextualizing the work, which is almost always very dissatisfying to
me, it seeming so often to be in direct opposition to a poet's intentions
with a particular work. (I don't make fun of S&M's "Classics" series just
because I'm cantankerous.) Yes, as John Caley says, publishing is largely
about "convenience"--which immediately sets up a tension between work
written *against* convenience of any sort. And what poetry--besides the
purely didactic--has ever been written *for* convenience?

I hesitate to reply to a message when I have 22 unread messages (many
from this list) still waiting on my machine...but Charles Alexander's
comments are too delicious to let pass by.

Jerome McGann & Cary Nelson have both addressed, quite usefully in
somewhat different ways, the role of the page in its relation to the
text, and I would imagine that most people on this list would agree that
it's an active one.

Poetry is full of attempts on the part of poets to dictate the final
physical look of a work on the page. (I can remember how very strange I
I felt the first few times poems of mine were published in little
magazines back in 1965, sort of like a "primative" seeing himself in a
polaroid for the first time or my lingering dislike of my voice on
videotape.) From Grenier's box to his more recent scribbles to Duncan's
typewriter, these attempts generally never worked because the tools
(and goals) of the poet and those of the printer and book designer were
not identical. I had one publisher (Jim Orsino-Sorcic) who once broke my
own lines in places more convenient to his page size! Ah well, Faulkner
couldn't get them to publish Sound & the Fury in multiple colors either.

The poets who have succeeded at this have been printers/graphic artists
themselves (Blake being the Big Example).

Now with DTP, however, more people have access to some rudimentary form
of that knowledge. I controlled every possible element in Toner
(designed the cover myself) and in the forthcoming (R) -- where Bill
Luoma did the cover. But I know my limits when contrasted w/ a Chax
Press.

So, yes, a Big Yes, on every element on the page being a part of the
experience of the poem (the poem as an experience). It's pouring outside
right now, another day of near Biblical torrents here in California, and
I'm reminded of the passage in Brautigan's In Watermelon Sugar (a great
little novel), in which he says something like if it's raining outside
when you read this poem, then that's the title of this poem,

the new critics/agrarians were indeed political reactionaries, as walter
kalaidjian's forthcoming essay in Marketing Modernisms (Duke UP, ed. Watt and
Dettmar) demonstrates; allen tate defended lynching, etc.  so any attempt to
make them sound noble in their pleas for political "neutrality" is just plain
naive. however, that does not mean that any close attention to a text, esp. as
people have been delineating those multifarious practices on this list, is
fascistic. --maria damon

Dear Dr. Silliman,

your first poems published in little magazines back in 1965 to ...

"...sort of like a 'primative' seeing himself in a polaroid for the

truly moving.  Do you have any other such engaging similes for us

yes, the page... Ron's examples from right now are indeed examplary.
the thing goes, however,back a long way. One of the finest examples of
poet's will re page left hanging was Mallarme's COUP DE DE. It came
out in 1897, & not according to M's design instruction. In fact the
very first edition published according to M's instructions came out in
the late 70ies (this century) when Mitsou Ronat & Tibor Papp did so.

Subject:      WARNING: Poetry Area--Publics Under Construction {long post/essay}

The following is most of the essay I presented at the Twentieth Century
Literature Conference, at the University of Louisville, on February 25, at a
panel entitled "Constructing Publics", organized by Robert von Hallberg; Maria
Damon also spoke at this session.  --Charles Bernstein


*********


WARNING ~ POETRY AREA:
Publics Under Construction


Do publics construct poetry or does poetry construct publics?
     Not so fast, where's the shell under those nuts, the nuts
under those texts, the texts under those author-functions, the
author-functions inside those periods, the periods inside those
stanzas, the stanzas inside those ever-loving tats for ticks,
quantums for particles, buzz saws for heliotropes, missionaries
for bugle boys?  The public does not and cannot exist until it
can find means to constitute itself; to convene in, on or about
the precincts of language; to explore its multiple, overlapping
or mutually exclusive, constituent parts, elements, components,
units, fractions, links, bands, conglomerations, alliances,
groupings, configurations, spheres, clusters, divisions,
localities; to find means of conversation without necessitating
conversion, among and between these constituent parts, allowing
that these parts shift and reconfigure in response to changing
circumstances.
     Poetry explores the constitution of public space as much as
representing already formed constituencies; risks its audience as
often as assumes it; refuses to speak for anyone as much as
fronting for a self, group, people, or species.
     In the process of recognizing new communities, new
audiences, and new publics for poetry, as well redressing the
previous exclusion of groups from our republic of letters, I want
to honor the complexity of contemporary American poetic practice
over and above its representativeness.  Within universities in
the 1990s, contemporary poetry is increasingly being taught for
the ways it marks, narrates, and celebrates ethnicity, gender,
and race.  To fit this curricular imperative, some poems may be
selected for their explicit and positive group representations.
Other poems (by the same poet or by other poets) may seem less
useful if they are found to complicate representation because of
their structural or formal complexity -- their contradictory,
ambivalent, obscure, or mixed expressions or inexpressions of
identity; or because of their negative or skeptical approaches to
fixed conceptions of self or group identity.  For poetry may wish
to question, rather than assume, group identity as much as self
identity -- not to deny that selves and groups exist, or have
voices, but to take their description and expression as a poetic,
as much as an epistemologic, project.
     Like many developments in education, the trend toward a
representative poetry is as much market or consumer-driven, not
to say demographic, in origin as it is ideological.  The gorgeous
mosaic of students in the classroom, to use former New York City
Mayor David Dinkins's term, puts an enormous, and appropriate,
pressure on teachers to create syllabuses that reflect the
various origins of our students as much as their multiple
destinations.   Yet, like in electoral politics, not every group
is recognized as equally significant in the often schematic, not
to say gerrymandered, patchwork of multicultural curricula.
Similarly, some subject areas such as contemporary poetry are
being used to front for the far more static approach to issues of
gender, race, ethnicity and sexual orientation in other areas of
the humanities and in the social and natural sciences.
     There are good reasons for this unequal development, since
contemporary poetry remains an indispensable site for the
exploration of the multiplicities, and multiplicitousness of,
identities.  TV and Hollywood movies continue to provide
inadequate, or nonexistent, representations of many groups in our
culture.  This may help to explain why poetry and the small press
are a _central_ place for such representations, given the
independent press's ability to serve what can as easily be called
small or niche markets as "marginal" communities.  For some
groups in our culture, poetry may be a primary site of basic
cultural exchange in a way that is hard to comprehend for those
who identify with the cultural representations of the mass media.
This is why it is crucial to differentiate share-driven mass
media from popular and local and folk-cultural activities whose
lifeblood is their low market share -- their small scale, let's
emphasize, rather than their "unpopularity".
     But it is not only sociologically identified "groups" that
are unserved or underserved by the majoritarian, market-share-
driven, mass media, but also "outsiders" of every sort and kind,
of every stripe and lack of stripe, as Maria Damon eloquently
argues in _The Dark Side of the Street_.  In an increasing
intolerant American cultural landscape, nonmajoritarian cultural
activities are stigmatized as elitist and as "special interests"
even though these activities are the last refuge of local and
particularistic resistance to the big government and big media
claimed, by the right, to be the source of our problems.  The
current attacks on public television and public support for the
arts and humanities are a sharp warning that intellectual
complexity, aesthetic difficulty, and non-mega-market-driven
cultural production have become "minor" art activities that
cohabit the same shadow world of poetry and the small press as do
group- and outsider-identified cultural practices.  For if
commercial culture is increasingly dominated by entertainment
products that are developed, through the use of focus and dial
groups, to evoke maximum positive response at every unit of
exposure; then art that is not just figuratively but literally
untested, art that evokes contradictory and confused initial
response, or simply appeals to a statistical minority of targeted
readers, will not be circulated through commercial channels.
     It should be no more a surprise to us in the USA, than it
has been for the past few years to citizens in the former USSR,
that market forces create different, but not necessarily
desirable, cultural values compared to those imposed top down by
the old-guard of cultural arbiters or commissars.


In the post-Pantheon world of book publishing, the diversified
companies that own the major trade publishers are charged with
publishing not simply profitable books but the most profitable
books.  Works that appeal to minor or micro publics, that is to
say small constituencies, are excluded from this system in favor
of works that appeal to macro publics, which is to say a
substantial market share of the targeted audience. The
circumstance is somewhat analogous to a TV show with millions of
enthusiastic viewers being cancelled for its failure to garner an
adequate public.
     Yet unprofitable cultural product does continue to be
manufactured in the commercial sector and not simply as a result
of the inevitable market failures of the entertainment industry.
The question is, why are some works published despite their
relatively poor profit potential in preference to other works
with a similar profit profile?  It isn't just nonprofit arts
organizations that lose money supporting their particular
cultural agendas.  Indeed, as far as losing money in an effort to
construct a public, the independent and alternative presses are
no match for such mainstream magazines as _The New Yorker_,
which, despite a circulation that has recently surged to 750,000,
appears to be losing as much as $10 million a year (that's
something like $13 per subscriber) -- an amount that could finance
a good part of the annual cost of the alternative poetry presses
and readings and magazines.  _The New Yorker_'s parent company,
S. I. Newhouse, is apparently less concerned with profit than
with cultural dominance -- legitimating the cultural product that
forms the basis of its media empire; for this exercise in
hegemony, circulation and publicity are more important than
profit.
     Of course, publishing statistics are notoriously unreliable,
especially when they concern the amount publishers are willing to
lose -- less to obtain cultural legitimacy, let me correct myself,
than to establish cultural values.  According to _The New York
Times_ (3/2/94, p. C20), Harold M. Evans, the publisher of Random
House's adult trade division, told an audience at the PEN
American Center that "the 29 books he published that made it on
to _The New York Times_'s 1993 list of Notable Books lost
$680,000" and the eight books that "won awards from the American
Library Association lost a total of $370,000."  Evans went on to
say that three of these books had advertising budgets of $71,000
to $87,000 each and that these books lost from $60,000 to
$300,000 each.  Innovative works of literature or criticism or
scholarship that challenge the dominant cultural values of
institutions such as Random House are not the most likely
candidates to receive this type of support; yet without such
subventions they stand little chance of being reviewed or
recommended in _The New York Times_, whose reviews are closely
correlated to its advertisers.  The point is not that official
"high" culture, just as alternative-press poetry, requires
subsidies; but that a system of selection and support favors
certain works over others; it is this system of selection and
promotion that allows the media conglomerates to control cultural
sectors that they have written off as largely unprofitable.
Note, however, that the content of the selections is less
important for this system of dominance than the system of
selection and promotion itself, since the alternative presses can
never afford to lose _as much as_ these corporations.
     It should be no surprise that it is neither the public nor
accessibility that creates official literary product, nor that
much of official "high" culture is a loss leader. Advertising and
promotion of targeted "loss leaders" are evidently worth the
price in influencing literary and critical taste, specifically by
fostering a cultural climate in which genuinely profitable
products may thrive.

Now should be the time to pull the hat out of the rabbit, the
bottle out of the genie, the tree out of the paper, the riddle
out of the problem.  For example to extol the emerging electronic
gateway as the balm for poetry, which will soothe our wounds of
poor capitalization and shrink-wrapped publics of long-term
outsiders, far-out insiders, subaltern-centric rhapsodes, and
other statistical anomalies from the upper west side of Manhattan
to the Castro district of San Francisco to the vacant lots behind
the Galleria mall in Nowhere, USA.
............
     I don't believe that technology creates improvement, but
rather that we need to use the new technologies in order to
preserve the limited cultural spaces we have created through the
alternative, nonprofit literary presses and magazines.  This is a
particularly important time for poetry on the net because the
formats and institutions we are now establishing can provide
models and precedents for small-scale, poetry-intensive
activities.  At the same time, the new interactive environment
suggests new possibilities for every aspect of poetic work, from
composition to visualization to display to performance to
distribution to reading, and indeed, to constructing publics,
this afternoon's putative subject.  (You say subject, I say
object; you say focus, I say associate: subject, object, focus,
associate, let's call the whole thing art.  But oh, if we call
the whole thing art then we must part and oh if we must part --
I'd be the object and you'd be the subject or you'd be the
subject and I'd be the object: let's call the art part off.)
     An enticing thing about today's internet environment is the
spirit of innovation and engagement that prevails.  A poem with a
sound file electronically published by _PMC_ (_Postmodern
Culture_) will get many more "hits" (user connections) than a
poem published in a comparable print journal because so many
people are cruising the net looking for new material.  Poetry
enters into a performance space on the net, providing text-based
content -- something poetry is particularly good at! -- to an
audience hungry for it.  There is some general interest, from an
internet-focussed public, in the new formats being created,
including those by poets and poetry editors.  The result is that
for the moment the public of poetry on the net is unusually
eclectic, even open, in their specifically poetic or literary
interest.  That is, a range of people will read and listen to
poetry, or participate in poetry-based discussion groups and
bulletin boards, who would not be interested in this genre in its
print- or performance-based forms (a claim that also could be
made for performance versus print and vice versa).  At the
moment, we have on the net something like a general audience for
poetry -- a claim that rightly will alarm those people conscious
of how restricted physical access to cyberspace is.  (Of the
poets I know in New York, less than 10 percent have e-mail
accounts; while in Buffalo, in a university based environment,
about 90 percent of the poets I know have e-mail accounts.)  But
I would argue that it is the current limitation of access and
programming that gives poetry its particular edge on the net and
as the information superhighway is put in place, the public that
will be constructed by it will return poetry to its hard-core.
     Poetry on the net is very small-scale: I am not talking
about big numbers so much as a certain fluidity of audience.  At
the University at Buffalo, we have set up an Electronic Poetry
Center, designed by Loss Glazier, a poet and our humanities
librarian, and Ken Sherwood, a poet and a doctoral student in our
Poetics Program.  The EPC, still under the construction, provides
gopher and WWW access to extensive listing of small press
catalogs and addresses, electronic versions of print journals and
archives of electronic magazines and our Poetics listserve
discussion group, plus alphabetically arrayed poems and essays,
recent obituaries, sound files, etc.  A related project is
_Rif/t_ magazine, a electronic poetry magazine (publishing poems,
essays, reviews, and chapbooks) edited by Glazier and Sherwood.
_Rif/t_ itself has 1,000 subscribers.  As to EPC, the number of
connections or hits per month has been increasing: we estimate
something over 600 connections per month.  Some of these hits
may be the same user going back for more; at the same time the
statistics do not account for all modes of access to EPC, so the
number of sessions is actually higher.  In any case, over 600
hits in one month compares favorably to the public for an
establish literary magazine.  Luigi-Bob Drake's _Taproot_
magazine provides the most extensive and useful listing of small
-- press magazines available -- providing short reviews of over 300
different magazines and chapbooks in the last issue.  _Taproot_
is also available on line, minus its feature articles.  The hard
copy version of the magazine has a print-run of about 2500, of
which 500 are distributed free in Cleveland, its home base.  The
e-mail version goes out directly to 500 subscribers and is also
redistributed to an additional 1,000 e-mail accounts as part of
_FactSheet5 Electric_, which in turn is available from over 20
archive and gopher sites with undetermined additional "hits".
_Taproot_ itself is also available via the EPC.
     More startling, and more informative as to the potential for
electronic distribution of "literary-niche" audience material, is
the incredible success of the electronic journal _Postmodern
Culture_.  According to co-editor John Unsworth, in the
approximately six-month period from May 18, 1994 to Dec. 8, 1994
there were over 40,000 requests for the table of contents of all
issues of the journal. In total, more than 358,000 items have
been requested from the PMC archives during this same period.
     Poetry on the net is not so much a positive development as a
necessary one.  The internet will become increasingly central for
poetry because of the economy of scale it provides, given the
high cost of printing and paper, the increasing expense for
unreliable postal service, the shrinking of the presently tiny
public support for literary publishing, and the absence of
poetry-committed bookstores in most localities.  Poetry editors
and publishers often have few alternatives but to use the
cheapest means of reproduction available: mimeo in the 60s, xerox
and offset in the 70s and 80s, and electronic publishing in the
90s. In the words of Joe Hill, Don't mourn, organize (though
there is plenty to mourn over).  A crucial prerequisite for that
organizing is understanding how this new space will affect the
composition and presentation of our work, especially insofar as
we respond in our work to this new electronic medium.  We also
need to explore the implications this emerging space has for the
composition and disposition of the publics for poetry.
     Unlike poetry on the net, poetry in print and live formats
presents few physical limits to access and user-interface given
the prevalence of hard-wired body systems for processing spoken
language and broad familiarity with alphabetic technologies.  Our
limits are more conceptual and ideological: the very niche-based,
specialized, focussed, small-scale, often non-overlapping
readerships that are a fundamental and vital and source of
poetry's aesthetic and social value.
     Many people say that the university, with its captive
audience of mostly 18-24 year-olds, has become the primary site
for the distribution of poetry.  I don't think this is quite
true, but few can fail to recognize how much of poetry's public
consists of students.  This reflects badly neither on poetry nor
universities, quite the contrary; rather, it reflects the
appalling lack of public cultural space outside the narrows
confines of the literary academy.  It is bad for poetry, and for
poets, to be nourished so disproportionately; for the sort of
poetry I care for has its natural habitat in the streets and
offices and malls and parks and fields and farms and houses and
apartments and elevators and stores and alleys and parades and
woods and bookstores and public libraries.
     Sometimes I imagine the kind of audience contemporary poetry
would have if it were on the radio on a daily basis: say a new
half-hour program every night at 8.  The public for this
programming would be small, although larger than our current
publics for poetry.  At the turn of this now turning century,
radio promised to revolutionize the distribution of poetry,
making widely accessible, at no cost, the new the new acoustic
riffs of the language arts.  For, of all our technologies, radio
has the greatest potential to create a democratic listening
space.  Without access to the public soundwaves, subsidiary,
privately available, spoken art media (tapes, CDs) cannot
flourish.  The exclusion of contemporary language arts from the
public air, from radio, is a stark warning about what we can
expect from the upcoming merging of cable TV, radio and the
internet.
     If contemporary poetry is able to construct only a series of
disconnected publics, then poetry is banished from that virtual
republic that we aspire to, all the more, knowing it
unattainable.  For all the utopian promise of technological
optimists, the answer is not in our machines but in our politics.
For we see in this society a constant erosion of public space --
space not privatized for maximum profit, but made available for
common use.  And so it seems we can only imagine the public
square, the town green, a Central Park of our poetries, where,
leaving the solitude or sustenance of our rooms or communes, we
might jostle against one another, unexpectably mingle, confuse
our borders: refigure ourselves, reconstitute our affiliations,
regroup.
     There is no education in the arts equivalent to having art
works available in open channels -- public spaces -- to intrigue,
befuddle, and engage those unfamiliar and familiar, but
especially unfamiliar.  Such initial points of public access to
art must not be abolished; neither should they be privatized,
through the restrictions of pay TV or high admissions prices. For
such sites to have a democratizing function they must be
maximally accessible from a physical, technological, and
financial point of view, just that what they exhibit may not be
so immediately accessible in other ways.  We must resist the idea
that difficult art is elitist, any more than that science is
elitist or that learning is elitist.  Such arguments breed
demagoguery not populist empowerment.  By denying the value of
the labor necessary to become linguistically and culturally
informed, we encourage the maintenance of an uninformed, indeed,
ignorant, citizenry.
     If the arts are denied public support, it is not the artists
or dedicated readers and viewers who will suffer, for one way or
another their commitment will keep them working and they will be
prepared to find art in out-of-the-way places.  But for the
uninitiated, the decline of public space for art can be
devastating, for they will have no common place to find non-
market driven art production.  Public radio and public
television, despite their manifest inadequacies, are, like public
arts funding through the NEA and other agencies, a fundamental
point of intersection between the public and the arts.  They are
the town square of art.  In a society that has few such points of
access, any diminishment of our public spaces for culture is a
catastrophe.
     Don't lament, or don't lament only: construct.

Subject:      Joe Amato's volume of poetry now available...

Several months ago we announced Joe Amato's forthcoming volume of poetry,
_Symptoms of a Finer Age_.  It's just come back from the printer, so next
week we'll be sending out copies to those of you who ordered it.  If you
didn't order it, but want to, here's the info....

Joe Amato, _Symptoms of a Finer Age_, 96 pages, perfectbound, $12, White
Noise #5; ISBN: 1-885215-12-6.  You can order directly from Viet Nam
Generation, Inc., 18 Center Rd., Woodbridge, CT 06525.  Add $1.35 for
shipping and handling.

I've been following the form/content discussion--my opinion as an editor and
book designer is that the physical medium should, ideally, work with the
poetry.  For example, the standard size for books in the White Noise Series
is 8.5" x 5.5", a pretty standard paperback size.  Joe's poetry has long
lines, though, and sometimes he has right-justified lines which have the
feel of marginalia.  He also has a couple of pages which make use of a
mixture of fonts and type sizes to create a particular visual effect.  I
felt that in order to create a book which would carry Joe's work, I had to
change sizes and go to 8.5" x 6", giving the text a broader look and
shifting the proportions somewhat closer to square.  Our cover designer,
Steve Gomes, created an "outside" for the package which is in dialogue with
the contents:  Joe's brother had taken a B&W picture of the New York World's
Fair globe; the globe appears in one of Joe's poems and is an integral image
for the book.  We reversed the image so that it looks like the globe is
hanging in space, flipped the negative so that the continents appear as they
would appear on a map (convincing, but completely wrong, as any architect
would--and did--catch immediately) and then had the photo hand-tinted in the
style of 1930s photo labs, in blues and tans (exactly matching the colors of
the earth from space).  Steve then got a flat, black mat on which he laid
out the hand-painted photo, holding it in place on the front cover with
those little old-fashioned black photo corners.  He similarly set up the B&W
author photo on the back cover.  Then he went to our page layout program and
set up the titles, which he printed on paper of exactly the color that
newspaper turns when it gets, oh, say about 40 years old.  He printed them
in 150dpi resolution instead of the 600dpi our printer is capable of so that
they would look just as blurry as newspaper type.  Then he cut them out,
carefully, by hand and glued them on the black mat board, folding the
corners of one piece to crease the print and give it a more "authentic"
look.  Then we shot the whole board so that we could get a vivid 3-D effect.
The result is that the cover looks like pages out of a carefully kept
scrapbook.  To keep the scrapbook feel, we had the printer run the black
background in a seperate pass through the press in a *very* flat matte
black.  Then they ran the four-color passes in regular gloss inks.  Finally,
we did a double pass with liquid lamination--gloss lamination just on the
photographs, and matte on the rest of the cover. The result is that the
photo-corners look like they come off the page, a remarkable illusion which
resonates perfectly with the images in Joe's poetry.  We could have gone to
less trouble, I suppose, but then, the poet could also have taken it easier.
The result in either case would have been less pleasing.

I like computers and I am very into writing HTML documents, but there is
something different about manufacturing a book--I really like that
particular interaction between message and medium.

I certainly respect Ron's examples, and his own design of TONER, and
Pierre is right to call attention to Mallarme, but I think that, if the
discussion of space is limited to the page and its typography, something
is missing. Gary Sullivan wisely called attention to the context of
publication for O'Hara. I have got the first edition of Maximus IV, V, VI
down from my shelf, and in that book the weight of the volume, the
texture of pages and cover, all contribute. This is about paying
attention to what and how we read and what effects that reading, and the
field is much broader and  more complex than "the page."

I also have a sense that books today are very restricted in how they
might convey the sense of the poem. By that I mean that I suspect Ron
designed TONER according to at least some of the conventions of the
marketplace. I'm not certain a book with the size, uncoated paper, and
other charateristics of that second Maximus volume would find shelf space
in any but about four bookstores in the USA, if the book were by a poet
with about the same exposure as Olson had at the time that book came out.
In 1995 more and more of the smallest presses are conforming not only to
size standards, but also to paper standards, often to the 4-color
processes marketing seems to call for, and including bar codes. How does
an individual text, and a publisher, maintain a distinctive physical
manifestation? How will they do so in electronic publishing? Do the
advantages of the current means of distribution outweigh what is lost?

contra (as per usual lately, oddly) my friend Charles (A), I guess I'd
want to suggest that:
1) while, when dealing w a chunk of poetry (poetries) by various authors
where the going wisdom has to do w irreplaceable signature (17-C
mannerist; modernist--eg) it's interestin (a la Bob Perelman book I've
not yet bought/read?) to dispute the category of the "master work)
2) when dealing w something like Lang Po 1 which so insistently insists
on textuality and discourses etc etc, it might be, exactly, (most?)
interesting to focus (or insist) instead on the grain of the (non) voice
and the category of the would-be masterwork: of all the many-hundred (?)
(or couple hundred, it must be) books by so-called so-called G-1, which
of them, (if the books itself or "itself" sruvives another 50 years) will
survive as THE books from Lang Po - 1 that one needs to read?
sinc the question itself is inimical, in important ways, to the ethos of
the movement (or non-movement), it's THERFORE interesting.
or so say all of us ....

As a small publisher I conform to book trade standards, of necessity to
make it *possible* for a book to exist in the trade context, even if it is
unwelcome and may languish in a distributor's warehouse. There are always
constraints.

Surely that is a function of the creative effort some or all put in.
Dancing in chains?

We've already crossed the Rubicon. The hype is all true, except that it is
not possible for us to predict or even conceive of the final physical forms
in which the medium we are currently using will manifest itself. It is very
hard to believe that it will not have at least the flexibility and degree
of material articulation as does print/paper. It's likely that sooner
rather than later it will have acquire many 'sensual' characteristics which
will be as pleasing to us as those associated with productions of the
finest paper/print practioners.

(Remember when screens of texts were little green dots on a black void?
That was when Ted Nelson invented hyperText.)

Subject:      Poetry and the Page

Concern with the interraction of poetry and its appearance on the
page coincides with periods of adventurous experimentalism in poetry
writing. But first you have to have a page. That was difficult before
the printing press, but not impossible. A few poems in Greek, the
"technopaignea," survive--shaped poems that resemble an egg (a poem
about a nightingale), panpipes, a few others.

In the later 1500s there was a lot of experimentation with
accommodating the poem's appearance on the page to its content--a
mixture of graphics and print, and in the 1600s there were emblem
poems. The irregularity of line lengths, too, could be advertised by
conspicuous indentations, and there were poems that bordered on free
verse--in fact, given the context of the times, were free verse.

Beginning about 1680 and continuing to about 1780, typographical
devices were scorned and avoided for the most part. The page was
simple a place where the poem could be recorded. There are exceptions
to all the generalizations offered so far, but on the whole there was
this rhythm of experimentation and reaction.

Then with Blake and continuing with the Pre-Raphalites there was
renewed experimentation with typography, graphics, advertised
expressiveness or irregularity, etc. Surely Whitman, a printer
himself, realized the typographical impact of his lines--as opposed
to what was generally expected in the nineteenth century.

Mallarme pointed to the future with the typographical extravagances
of "Un coup de des,"  and Pound and Amy Lowell certainly used
typography for formal purposes. It has been argued that Williams's
"triadic" line was really a typographical device, and that Olson's
distribution of his lines appeal to the eye more than serving as a
transcription of his "breath."

Imagist doctrine (Ford, Hulme, Pound, Lowell, Aldington, etc)
emphasized the visual over the audible, and that included the
appearance on the page. e. e. cummings used the typewriter for witty
purposes that involved exact placement of letters and words, and of
course Olson insisted even more grandiosely on that tool's
usefulness.

The visual media available for recording poetry always affect the
poetry, especially in periods of experimentation. First came moveable
type, then after a long time, the typewriter, and now all the graphic
possibilities--the fonts, etc--available in word processors. Actually
Mallarme went a long way very early; his poem was so hard to set in
type that it was not published in correct form until some years after
his death

Neoclassicists, from Joseph Addison (who called shaped poems "false
wit") to the present tend to be unsympathetic with the notion of
typographical poetry. This is another of the issues contributing to
the bifurcation of American poetry.

Yes, Tenney, I do have some objections to a listing of the "masterworks"
of langpo, although part of the problem I had with that request was that
it did not ask for the ten "masterworks" or "best works" (about which you
could give your list, I could give mine, etc.), but for the ten "most
important." What does important mean in this sense? I may find works
which are most influential are not works which I consider the most
accomplished. I may argue that the most accomplished are not the most
generative or courageous. I also may believe that a book issued in 200
copies (or even 50) by a very small and independent press in northern
California is more of a masterwork than the best distributed langpo book
published by Sun & Moon (arguably the most "successful" langpo publisher,
but "successful" by what standards -- aesthetic, marketplace, other? -- &
this is not to argue against Sun & Moon, Douglass, as I love your work).

So, first, make clear for me your definition of a masterwork, then I'll
be glad to suggest how I might fill in the blanks in the top ten. But I
suspect your definition may be more interesting than my list (or someone
else's).

        all best to you & all the list,
        charles alexander

ps -- to John Cayley, yes I still believe there's lots of room for
creativity in bookmaking, even for the wider marketplace, although I
sometimes feel bad that some of the tools are lost or made difficult.
Interesting that some of the most exciting developments in commercial
papermaking are in the issuing of exciting (visual & textural) recycled
papers, and that these particularly lend themselves to book covers,
except for the fact that they are uncoated, which means some bookstores
don't want them and that their suitability for 4-color printing (without
going to great expense, although the results can be dramatic) is not
great, which means that sales reps have a harder time marketing them. I
am currently driven to design books for the market which do conform (at
least enough to make them work, but not enough to make them absolutely
"regulation") to trade standards, but also to keep making books whose
devotion is to the union of bookmaking excellence & innovation with
literary works, even though the labor to produce such works is great and
the market is tiny.

As to the possibilities of sensuality in the electronic realm, I am
excited and fairly ignorant, but hopeful.

To H.T. Kirby-Smith, thanks for the brief history, it's helpful. But I
don't think "typographical poetry" is the extent of what we're talking
about. As a poet who makes books, certainly, the shape of poem on page,
the kind & shape of page, the double-page spread, the conception of
sequencing in turning the page, as well as other aspects of color and
form, are all part of the artistic composition, yet these are not
"typographical poems" in any sense I recognize that term. I know there
are other poet/bookmakers on this list, and I wonder what they have to
say about this issue, whether they are printing/designing their own works
or works by others. I am interested in the possibilities of design/book
art, while being a "presentation" of texts, at the same time being a
"reading" or "interpretation" of texts, and even, when possible (and this
is tricky) being a "collaborative partner" with texts. Among texts some
would consider as language poetry (getting back to possible masterworks,
Tenney), I would point to the first edition of Susan Howe's
DEFENESTRATION OF PRAGUE (Kulchur Foundation,1983), Charles
Bernstein & Susan Bee's THE NUDE FORMALISM (Sun & Moon, 1992), and Lyn
Hejinian & Kit Robinson's INDIVIDUALS (Chax, 1988), as three books which
enact such a partnership in three dramatically different ways. I
sometimes wonder, though, if future scholarship will keep such
presentations/partnerships in mind, or pay attention only to the texts,
which I find limiting. On the other hand, I am not a proponent of some
masterwork notion of bookmaking, rather that such partnerships are
illuminating while not being the only artistic possibilities, yet
maintain some eminence when they are the first printed editions of texts.

Thanks, Jonathan Brannen, for your post on close reading(s).  I agree
the context of university classes can be destructive in just the ways
you indicate.  Content dis-formed is what the system produces,
because at the place where your poetry-as-music or (as-for-music)
gets found, so discourse re-theme and content gets dis-abled.

Equivalent in painting and other "visual" arts discourse is:    taking
painting exclusively as picture, where picture is reduced to a small
selection of nameable objects, each of which can then be drawn into
theme-content discussion (and "theory") but with no regard for
questions of how in the medium all that can be seen.  (Classic much
anthologised example is Louis Marin reading Poussin's Et in Arcadia
ego. )

The level of the working by which the work has had to be constructed (constituted as image)
disappears from view, where the work in the medium and the resulting
figuration (or absence of it) makes picture visible.

Excuse, please, folks, the premature sending that just occurred.  I'll begin
again:

Gary's question (about the form and physicality of my small chap called
CRITERIA FOR BEING TOUCHED) is most welcome. Much of the credit must go to
C.L. Champion, the publisher, who lives in Tucson. I had sent Champion a
small grouping of poems, many of which seem now to me to have a quality of
casualness about them that may have inspired the publisher to present them
together with wonderful drawings crayoned in and showing childed printing on
the front cover, using the space as children do, with the word "Sheila"'s
taking up the whole horizontal space, necessitating a move to another place
to the right of the drawing of figures and sun and a house on the left of the
page, just to get in the middle initial "e" (to distinguish, some of you
know, from another Sheila Murphy in the lit world - I did this a long time
back, knowing what a common Irish name I have - and there indeed turn out to
be several by my name).  Anyhow, the little stub of sandpaper on the back of
the book does several things as far as I can see.  The suggestion of sand
itself is there, as in sandbox (the recollective aspects of the work, notably
the first piece about my now late father, called "I Could Ask Anything,"
which youngs its way along to mirror, as happens, the naive art concept on
the cover), and as in rough cut of feelings almost unconsciously released as
they are from childhood.  There's mention of physical things in that first
poem (a haibun, by the way) about my father's making our lunches and placing
them in brown manila envelopes he would recycle from the office (long before
this sort of thing was done).  The style of the book seems to be perfectly
tuned to the moment the experience it talks about was born.

A primary reader of what I do, who responds to many things before they leave
me, also loved this book, Gary.  Bev Carver immediately perceived the link
and loved what C.L. Champion had done.

I have had this hunch concerning serendipity that keeps proving itself true:
 one of the most exciting aspects of writing comes at the point at which an
editor who really cares can leap with the work to the physical place at which
it needs next to occur (for many other people to perceive).  I'm constantly
lucky in this.  And notably in small, small press efforts that come directly
from garages.  This is the best example I know of where something boundlessly
and simply beautiful occurs when I've completely let go of something I have
written.  For me, the physical imagination of the other person comes as a
gift that enriches the experience of making.  While I love direct
collaboration (I do a lot of that with John M. Bennett (in text) and with
Megha Morganfield (on Celtic harp with text) and some others, THIS is
collaboration of another kind.

Thanks, Gary, for asking.

Sheila

A beautiful example of physical form has just arrived in the slow post.
 AVIDLY PERPLEXING by Meg Davis has been newly released by Sun/Gemini Books
in Tucson (Clint Colby, publisher).  PO Box 42170 Tucson, 85733.  $9.95.
 This is Meg's first chapbook. (A large chap with nothing spared re: expense,
by the way, and 39+ pages).  The poems are WONDERFUL.  Charles A. knows some
of Meg's work, and I hope still more others will soon.  Splendid, fresh

Folks,

Please excuse my first post. It was dashed off hastily and being a
first-time poster, I wasn't sure if it was going to even go through. I
certainly didn't mean to imply verticality or canonization. Rather, what
I meant was that it would be helpful to begin a list and commentary of
important, influential, provocative, or simply favorite books centered
around The Language Poetry dialogue--let's call it a community
bibliography of sorts. Hopefully, in the future it  be compiled into a
coherent resource that could be deposited at the E-Poetry Archive as a
signpost for net wanderers or other interested parties. As a very side
discussion in this group, if people would occasionally post their choices
and reasons, I would begin to compile (being a natural compiler) a
resource.

Kenneth, here's one:

                        TOP TEN LANG NOs

     "We are forever deceiving ourselves with names and
     theories."
                         --Charles Lamb

     "Benjamin Franklin [was] the only president of the United
     States who was never president of the United States."
                         --Firesign Theater

     1. Aristotle's _On the Art of Poetry_. Section 20, focussing on
linguistic definitions.

     2. Charles Lamb's _Selected Prose_. As Adam Phillips notes in the
Introduction: "[for Lamb] great art was unfinished in the sense that it
relied on the imaginative involvement of the audience to complete it. It
was not something that by virtue of its perfection diminished its
audience. It was not an idol but an invitation." From Lamb's essay on
Hogarth: "*imaginary work*, where the spectator must meet the artist in
his conceptions half way; and it is peculiar to the confidence of high
genius alone to trust so much to spectators or readers." (cf.
"reader-response writing.")
     Lamb's essay "On the Tragedies of Shakespeare" is the first instance
of someone suggesting a preference for *reading* Shakespeare over viewing
the plays performed. An excellent, intelligently stated argument, with all
the panache (& thrice the wit) of Grenier's "I HATE SPEECH." (You'll have
to read Lamb's essay to see whether or not you agree--and to what
extent--Lamb's & Grenier's concerns are related.)

     3. Gertrude Stein. No need to explicate. Richard Bridgman's _Gertrude
Stein in Pieces_ includes a (complete?) bibliography, with actual &
well-guestimated dates for each work, if you want to read her
chronologically.

     4. Samuel Beckett, esp. _How It Is_, _Stories and Texts for Nothing_,
_Fizzles_, _Ill Seen Ill Said_, _Worstward Ho_, _More Pricks than Kicks_,
_Company_ and _Stirring Still_. A big influence on Coolidge, who seems a
big influence on lang pos.

     5. Jack Spicer, _Language_. (cf. Silliman on this in _New Sentence_.)

     6. Clark Coolidge, esp. _Space_, from 1970. The spine of this book
claims it was published by "Harper & Row"; I think they did that with
mirrors.

     7. J.G. Ballard, _The Atrocity Exhibition_. Originally published in
1972 by Panther; reissued (expanded edition?) recently by Re/Search. His
notorious "Why I Want to Fuck Ronald Reagan" (there's an Andrews title for
you) orig. appeared in 1968 in _Ronald Reagan, The Magazine of Poetry_,
edited by John Sladek and Pamela Zoline. (Includes groovy, Brainardesque
line-drawings by Zoline.) Andrews is funnier, but Ballard stays with you
longer. (Well, okay, "has stayed with *me* longer.")

     8. Ad Reinhardt. It's been too long since I've read him to explicate,
but I remember, first coming across journals like _Ottotole_ and _Poetics
Journal_, that the Ad-man'd covered some of that conceptual ground with
respect to the visual arts. His art-world satire collages (including a
horse-racing form with the names of various abstract expressionists
substituted for horses) are not to be missed. He may or may not prove
relevant.

     9. The Firesign Theater, _Don't Crush that Dwarf, Hand Me the
Pliers_. If anything can be said to've prepared me to read (& appreciate)
Bernstein, it was this record. I'm constantly amazed by the lack of
(serious) critical attention these guys have received. One of the members,
David Ossman, did the interviews of New American Poets published in _The
Sullen Art_. (Corinth published that, I think.) There are several e-space
"whatchyoucallems" devoted to the F.T. I've discovered using Gopher.
Can't remember where they are, how I got there. At least one site
includes the F.T. "lexicon," which might be valuable for the un- or
recently initiated.

     10. Alan Davies, "Peer Pleasure," just published in _Cyanosis_ #2
(e-mail cyanosis@slip.net for info). Any serious study of a movement, group,
clique or tendency might include a well-stated, serious critique. "Peer
Pleasure" is an example.

im not sure its possible to avoid the implications of verticality
or cannonization; the AUTHORity of this list ("owened" by bernstein,
and regular contributors including a substantial part of the langpo
movement) militates against such...

& id suggest, (related to the forms of publication thread) that
the kind of centrally compiled list yr suggesting is a holdover
from pre-electronic publishing ideas--if the e-network has any
advantage at all, its the possibility of decentralized multiplicity,
where all participants lists are equally available, w/out the
added "legitimization" implied by being added to a maintained
list...

id be _very_ interested, on the other hand, to have random postings
by any and all participants of what they're reading & enjoying
this week...

Dear Ric,

We have now sad news: two weeks ago
Estonian poet and actor Juhan Viiding
(Elo Vee's father) made a suicide.
His cry against the brutality of
contemporary life, its stupidness
and dullness is still breaking
our hearts. Funerals were last

the world differ real and false.
New times were too hard for him

I can't recall off-hand whether Maximus IV, V, VI was published by
Jargon, Cape Goliard/Grossman, or perhaps someone else.  In any case,
I wonder how widely distributed it actually was at the time it was
published.  I know that Olson personally placed copies of the previous
volume of Maximus in bookstores, probably by towering over the owner.

I share your concern about the pressures to conform to publishing
standards.  Reading books is an intimate experience.  And all aspects
of the book contribute to that experience.  I treasure both ends of
the publishing spectrum that are disappearing, those amazingly
textured, inventively designed, carefully executed, letterpress,
handbound editions (such as Chax "non-trade" editions, though the
trade editions are lovely too) AND the xeroxed (in earlier days
memeographed) books done as cheaply as possible just to get the work
out.  I value my disentigrating copies of books from presses like
Doones and Angel Hair.  The quirks and ecentricities of the handmade
(homemade) book on both ends of the spectrum are a delight.

I'm wrestling with these issues now.  Standing Stones Press publishes
chapbooks.  They're attractive, carefully made and reasonably inexpensive.
I do everything myself in order to keep the costs down because I want
them to be affordable.  I fantasize about breaking even someday but
this is not a capitalist venture.  I think it's psychologically
important for younger writers and writers that are not as well known
as they should be to have collections of their work printed.  The

The problem, of course, is that don't meet the shelf and profit needs
of all but a few bookstores.  Small Press Distribution won't carry
them.  The reasons I was given is that they're not taking on any new
publishers of chapbooks because they don't make enough money from
them to make it worthwhile and that they're moving toward carrying
only trade editions because that's where the market is.  Now, I can
understand their desire to increase sales and stay financially
solvent, and I can more-or-less ignore the irony of a non-profit
corporation complaining about not making enough profit.  But here's
the conundrum, I can do a trade edition annual in which I essentially
publish the chapbooks I would have, but the psychological boost that
comes from having what may be your first collection published has
been denied you.  Instead you're lumped together with other writers
with whom you have little in common and there's a higher price tag
for all involved.

So, if I capitulate a spectrum of distinctions get lost.  Now I confess
a certain nostalgia for the book.  They're portable, tactile, don't
require hundreds of dollars of equipment to read, and can be read
when the power's out.  But I'm also considering electronic publication.
Until the frontier aspects of the net are squashed by government
interests, you have spontaneous distribution and minimal overhead.
I suspect that electronic publications will evolve into collaborative
efforts due the level of expertise required to utilize the wide
media available through the computer.  Electronic journals will
contain animation, "films," music, voice, text and who know's
what all thrown in the mix together.  Who can foresee how it will
evolve?  The problem I see at the present is that the net is a realm
of the priviledged.  You have to have the equipment to access it and
you have to have an entrance point.  Public sites are scarce.  This
is less an issue for those of you associated with universities where
limitless net access usually the norm.  If you're not, it gets
expensive quickly, even when you can make connection without racking
up long distance phone charges.

I throwing the above out for consideration.

Dear Jonathan:

        Maximus Poems IV,V,VI was published in 1968 by Cape Goliard
Press in association with Grossman.  When I was a student studying
Olson, in 1973, it was most difficult to find a copy.  Students searched
used bookstores in the hope of finding a copy.  Until Butterick com-
pleted his heroic task of the Collected Maximus, I believe IV, V, VI
was out of print.
        As to the idea of Olson pressing his work on any bookseller,
it is my impression that Olson cherished, and hoarded his copies. I
recall vividly Harvey Brown and Jack Clarke fondly describing Olson's
hospital room - and the stack of IV,V,VI prominently displayed and
referred to by him - it was a treasure.  The literal fact of its
accomplishment and material presence was no small feat - it signified
a labor of love by Olson and the many friends who believed in his work.
Its "success" measured by sales - was never the point.

To list subscribers at Buffalo:

I'm going to be giving a talk at Buffalo on Friday March 31, sometime in
the afternoon (2, 3, or 4:00, I believe). The talk is titled "Wallace
Stevens and the Pragmatist Imagination" and is a part of a book I'm
writing on Pragmatism and American Literary Modernism (the literary part
being, for the most part, devoted to Henry James, Gertrude Stein, and
Stevens).  Some in the audience (students in Art Efron's Pragmatism and
Literature seminar) will, if I'm not mistaken, have read my recently
published "The Esthetics of Pragmatism," in American Literary History,
Winter 1994 (not, however, "required reading").  This, for those of you
interested, doesn't really cover any poetry, though Stevens sneaks in near
the end: you'll have to wait for the book!  (Not long, I hope.)  The
talk, on the other hand, is full of close reading, of the best kind.

I'll post the time and place in a couple of weeks.  Hope some of you can
make it--

Several poetry lists have been compiled by the poets of whom you speak. A
group of us compiled a yearly list in the Segue distribution catalog. I
can give you this which consists of 300 titles. A list of ten as has been
suggested is, as others have suggested, like asking which dozen eggs
makes the best omlette. Any eggs will make the omlette you choose to
make. The works of the poets of the past 20 years compose matrix of
poems, themes, and strategies and to isolate any in a list is to miss the
point of the matrix structure. Can we begin to isolate works in this
overall and complex way rather than a string of titles and justifications?

back to the masterworks.  The topic, that is (not like "back to the
things themselves!").  I don't know that the criteria (would) come first,
Charles; just (perhaps) after a while (20-30-50 years say) some books,
and writers, will rise, or stick, or whatever your trope is (maybe the
spaghetti on the wall is best).  And I think that that's gonna be
interesting, for Lang Po in particular, just because it goes against the
grain of the enabling rhetoric (not so for modernism) and is therefore
likely to show unexpected things about Lang Po, and to shed interesting
light on it.  I'm not really invested or even interested in arguing canon
right now.  There are just so many truisms about discourse, and
textuality, and enabling of readers and etc etc that it's nice to
contemplate a meaningful (let's hope) engagement w some of the poetry
that comes at it from a stance quite different from its own.
(the obverse and less interesting--but satisfying!--case is to watch
Charles Altieri take Worshop Poetry w its pride in Craft and The Well
Made Poem and The Individual and cook it all down to a suet (sp.?) w
maybe 3 ingredients).

Dear B. Cass Clarke

Of course, Maximus's success measured by sales was never the point, nor
did I intend to imply that it could be measured in sales.  I was addressing
Charles Alexander that only about four bookstores would carry a comparable
ahem,  I was addressing Charles Alexander's observation that no one would
stock a comparable book today (comparable in terms of size and needed
shelf space for a poet now at a similar point in her or his career).

My notion of Olson towering over bookstore owners comes from reading
Jonathan Williams' account on Olson personally placing the Jargon
edition of Maximus I - III in bookstores in small towns in North
Carolina, stores so unlikely to sell them that Williams claimed
copies were still in stock in the mid-1980s (for the original list
price).  I can't vouch for the accuracy of the story or the accuracy
of my recollection of it, other than to say I think it's fairly
accurately.  I think I gleaned this from an interview with Williams
in Vort in the early 1980s.

I don't personally placing books in bookstores precludes the possibility
of later hoarding copies.  Having watched a couple of my own books go
out of print, I tend to be generous with copies and aggressive about
placing them in stores when they first appear and considerably more
parsimonious when there are only a few copies left.  I think Butterick's
labors are profoundly admirable.  Nor do I find Olson's personally
trying to make copies of his books available to a potential audience
less than admirable.  The unignorable fact, though, is that booksellers
measure the success of a book in terms of sales, which is why you
had such difficulties in finding copies of Olson's book.

Thanks for clarifying the issue of the publisher for me.

Best regards,
Jonathan

a quiet emendation---Olson was a very shy man, and for all his loud
palaver, would hardly have hovered over a bookseller.  In the sixties
when he was back in Gloucester, there was never a book of his to be
seen in local shops (though here and there you'd see books of Ferrini
and others), and his frequent letters to the Gloucester Times were
on matters of public import other than poetry.

You're right in thinking MAX IV/V/VI did not have huge distribution,
but it was around, and more available for a while than most books of
poetry, so those who had any interest in such matters could and did
find it.  (As you'd find Content's Dream now, for instance.)

It is interesting to recall the late George Butterick's conscientious
even desperate attempts to decipher certain later Olson scripts, where
decipher really meant to enpage, let me use such a word. Those who heard Olson rread out loud know that the domain of the page and the domain of the voice
seldom coincided, and were not, I think, meant to in any obvious
illustrational way.  The way of the page was the man's cry.

Dear Cass,

I certainly had not intended to misrepresent Olson's person.  I view
the image of Olson in this perhaps apocryphal bookstore with a degree
of warmth because I've talked to enough trade managers in bookstores
to understand that it can be awkward trying to get them to stock
poetry.  I relished the human element of the tale.  And I confess to
braking for bookstores in North Carolina on the chance it might be
true.

I don't know what to say about my or anybody else's easy use of the
Olson mystique.  There's no denying that there is such a mystique,
unfortunately images can never be accurate and with even the best
intentions they distort the reality of the person.  I don't wish
to be perpetuating falsehoods when I mention Olson, but never having
met Charles Olson, I have to take somebody's word for truth.  The
alternative is to refrain from mentioning him, and he's too important
a figure not to be mentioned.  I hate to use the term figure in
reference to anyone, but for me he can never be the complex human
being that you interacted with.

If it's any comfort, Olson's detractors are fighting a losing battle.
There's no doubt in my mind Olson's poetry will continue to be read.
I'm sorry if you feel I've done him an injustice.  I had not meant
to.  His work and literary reputation are both strong enough to
withstand even the most spurious attack.  Since he's one of the
writers to whom I keep returning, I'd rather not be construed as
contributing to such an attack or perceived as participating in it.
I'll try to mend my wicked ways.  How did you meet Charles Olson
and what was your initial impression of him?  I kind of excited
to be "talking" with someone who knew Olson.  Please excuse my
gracelessness that brought it about.

Best regards,
Jonathan

Dear Jonathan Brannen,

If you have not done so, I hope you will write up everything you know
about the progress of small-press publishing from Jargon Press to the
present, along with accounts of the personalities involved. As best I
can tell all your own book publications are poetry.

Is Jonathan Williams still alive? I never met Olson, but Williams
gave me a hard time about not arranging a poetry reading for him
years ago--and then we got onto the more agreeable subject of the
Appalachian Trail. I was in Black Mountain just the other
day--stopped off while heading to Tennessee. There's a historical
marker on old Route 70--no reference to any poets by name. If I got
to the right place in the end, the campus is now occupied by the
Western Division of the Department of Human Resources, including an
Altzheimer's treatment center. Only postcards available in town were
general views of the Black Mountains, except for one of the drugstore
itself, Black Mountain Drugs, which is probably much like it may have
been if Olson bought aspirin there.

Has anybody thought of a poetic guidebook? Walden Pond,  City Lights, Jeffers's
tower if it's there, the academic computing center at Buffalo...

The informal "history" of small press publishing is a long term
interest of mine, but it's progress is too mercurial for me to
do justice to.  And I'm sure there are others on this list more
knowledgible than I am.  I'd love to hear some of the "war stories"
that the various people who have been involved in literary publishing
might have to share.

Having recently "made easy use of Olson's mystique" I'm hesitant to
speculate about the existence and whereabouts of anyone.  To the
best of my knowledge, though, Jonathan Williams is alive, and my
understanding is that he has taken up full-time residency in
Great Britain, I believe in Devonshire, though I'm not certain.
Perhaps someone reading this can provide you with a current
address.

            'It is not that we go into the past, live in the past, to find
her, but that her print, her traces, are around us. Indeed, if one searches
the past for her, the search will lead to fiery details, a stroke here and
then an airy space, another stroke of what is now called fact, and then
something obliterated, drowned, burned, lost. And then another stroke,
until an entire structure of a life begins to rise, brilliant, with long
reaches, venturesome, airy, full of risk, moving in a way that speaks to us
in our century.
            She is a rebel who appears to fail at every climax of her life.
She can be seen to go deeper at these times.' (Rukeser 'The Traces of
Thomas Hariot')

            I've often referred to Muriel Rukeyser's terrific book 'The
Traces of Thomas Hariot'. It seems to encapsulate some of the problems
lurking in premature disussions about book objects, publishing formats, top
tens and 'readings' / 'refluences'  -  intriguing though I've found recent
posts on such subjects. It talks about the processes of 'history' of how
what survives survives and how what is lost is sometimes that which is most
valuable.

            An ammended quote from a short, slack and unsatisfactory
snippet written for the L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E issue of Open Letter locates part
of my own feelings (hard to believe I could say that), some of which I
retain, about the political economy of the cultural production and
consumption of the book:

           ' "Perfection - Constancy - Consistency are terms applicable to
a static state of affairs that this writer would wish to be considered
outside of" (allen fisher 'A Sketch Map of Heat')
            The size of the page that work is made on, the page as a site,
the texture of the paper to be printed on and its class pretentions towards
promoting substantiable meanings, its color (if any), the choice of
typography and more - all such active choices inform the work and such
choices form part of what can be read. . . Words are actions, they are part
of a physical process. . . to extract one element of this processual space
and reproduce the same extraction, say in a re-print or anthology is to
re-present rather than present. This is effect amounts to translation.'

            Not that translation should be anything other than encouraged,
but acknowledged, have its own process incorporated, be sensitized to the
poet's choice of presentation as some recent posts have carefully,
documented. Thanks for those.

            Also consider the ambience of the reader's location  -  like
Tenney's tale of reading Olson on the A Train or whatever  -  works written
to interfuse with environment or encouraging expansion of consciousness.

            Consider the likening of the potential of these e-spaces for
re-integration of word and image  -  (yeah I know the arguments re- Caxton
primacy of print out of economic and technological imperatives and the
connections being made both positively and negatively regarding
e-Medivalism (sic)).

            Check out the work that John Cayley, and I hope others are (I
just don't know you), making for this environment. And the somewhat stalled
but clearly related, soon hopefully becoming more stimulating, discussions
on hyper-text composition on ht-lit.

            One thing that irks at present is the relative normalising
influence of electronic presentations in spaces such as these. I printed
out RIF/T when I clocked on here and found the layout (not the writing)
dull (no disrespect to the editors who must be slightly frustrated in their
ambition as yet) - with all the typographical possibilites available for
DTP innovation we speak here in a 'normalised', formally relatively
controlled and limited e-space. That's part of the problem with it's
strained physicality (how comfy is your chair and does your screen
periphereyes your vision?).

            Consider the possible inter-relations between printed matter
and e-publishing?

            I haven't got far yet but am currently improvising, in short
takes, from postings (including those on this list  -  issues of ownership
anyone?) into a dictaphone which I also carry when out driving or walking
and whatever. The materials are then written (by hand) in notebooks with
keen attention given to emphasis and re-invented when necessary. These
materials become typed onto word processing formats and transferred into
DTP packages (I use Claris and Quark). I then print out and sometimes (not
always) blu-tack the printed pages (large font size) up on a wall in a kind
of grid which is then re-improvised from onto cassette and re-transcribed.
I use choices from all stages of such a process to compose the 'poem'.
Sometimes these texts go on to form elements of performance work. Some is
printed  -  other versions are released on CD in spoken word or soundwork
contexts  -  other versions might be appropriate for electronic
presentation. The point is process and version. Somehow that leads back to
the top of this post and 'The Traces of Thomas Hariot' re - issues of
posterity and the market forces which exxxxcercise their imperatives onto
choice and 'what remains' or 'residues' its presence.

(that's my quid's worth on personal working processes  -  well actually I'm
thinking more in peso's now since a lot of my time over the past week's
been taken up with followng the unravelling of events in Mexico re Chiapas
after being alerted by Robert Harrison's extraordinary post 'A REAL
Political Poet')

Mistah Luoma,

Is that early modern or early modem?

I find that I have a strong ambivalence to Spencer's new book, which is
an ambivalence I have to much (tho not all) "visual poetry." It pushes
the line between "reading" and "looking" in a direction I'm not  that
comfortable with (I'd rather go in the opposite direction, start close
reading adverts in the mags).

Spencer's "regular" poems are so terrific that I deeply want to "get"
this work, but then feel pushed out again. It's a reaction I've had to
other visual works by Bernstein, DiPalma and other poets who I'd easily
count among my very favorite, so it's a reaction that puzzles me.

Two notable exceptions to this seem to me to be John Byrum (see the work
in Writings from the New Coast) and (from same book!) by Mark Mendel
(might be misspelling that name, sorry). Mendel's work seems to me very
influenced by Jenny Holzer, but with a sense of ear and compression that
I find lacking in her skewed aphorisms.

Both of these poets seems to take the visual to the written. Spencer's
work in contrast seems to pose the idea that the visual is a mask for the
written (or vice versa). The images appear "found" -- are the texts
likewise?

I'd love for somebody to close read this work and wake up my eyes. I'm
ready to learn!

Subject:      Lost Classics
In-Reply-To:  <6197DE5802BC0080>

Rather than just list what I've been reading lately (which consists of
relatively little beyond  recent books in the mail, such as Spencer
Selby's, Snow Crash by Neil Stephanson and Watten's Under Erasure [which
I read and reread the way Libyans read Khadafi's Little Green Book], then
massive numbers of Information Week, CIO, PC Week, Byte and the like for
work), I've been mulling over, rereading a series of "Lost Classics" that
I wish were still in print. I've gone so far as to think about trying to
package a series for a publisher.

By and large, these are longpoems, mostly from the 1960s, that I think
everybody should have and read because they're so wonderful:

A particular example of this genre would be Robert Kelly's Axon Dendron
Tree (which, with Finding the Measure & 20 Songs will always be the key
Kelly books for me because they arrived at just the right time to help me
with my own development as a poet, so that I have that deep love for them
that goes beyond articulation). Another is Ron Johnson's two Norton
books, Book of the Green Man and Valley of the Many Colored Grasses.
Another is Frank Stanford's battlefield where the moon said i love you
(writing from the job, so may have botched that title some). That may
still exist, tho would be hard to find, as would be the case I should
think with Grenier's Sentences (a "Chinese box" of 500 4x6 cards, the
sort of impossible project that extends Jonathon Brannen's insights sort
of toward a limit), a collection that I think all 1,000 subscribers to
the T-AMLIT list should read. Not to mention everybody here.

I think somebody could make the argument that the ideas in my own The
Alphabet are a direct (if transformed) descendant of the conception of
form implicit in Axon Dendron Tree and it still reads wonderfully today.

Anyhow, this after that's what seems powerful & moving and worth
mentioning

I remember reading somewhere that at the very famous reading at the Six

work but that of the recently deceased John Hoffman. Given how icon-ized
every other participant of that even has become, I'm surprised that I've
never read any of this poet's work. Does anyone know where one could find

Dear Ron & Bill,
     There's nothing (besides holding down a regular job) at which I'm
more inept than explicating people's--especially friends'-- works, but you
learn by trying, so here's a take on Spencer's _Malleable Cast_. I'm going
to try to stay away from a "close reading" approach, which has more to do
with my inability to articulate, specifically, what interests me about
this work than whether or not such a "close reading" (or mis-reading)
might prove valuable.
     Much of Spencer's non-visual poetry has (my take only) to do with what
I'd call "depolarization"--working with opposites (ideas, images, etc.) in
an effort to work through apparent dichotomies, but doing so not toward a
resolution so much as maybe a (this is going to sound silly) "shimmering
effect." If you like longpoems, Ron, check out Gerald Burns' _Letters to
Obscure Men_; it ends with thirty-six 21-line sections, placed two on a
page, the second on each page "restating" the first. It's Gerald's belief
that the resulting "poem" on each page is not the two poems actually
there, but that which resonates "between" them. It's an effect I've yet to
actually experience there, though this, to some extent, does seem to
describe what I "get" from much of Spencer's work.
     Spencer's impulses toward the visual (& toward/through apparent
dichotomies) come, I think, from having been a movie fanatic at a fairly
early age, especially of film noir. His interests resulted in at least one
published book, _Dark City_, a study of the film noir, published by St.
James Press (a reissue of an earlier edition, from McFarland & Company) in
1984. The photographs Spencer chose to include in _Dark City_ (I'm
assuming Spencer chose them) look very much like the raw material "founds"
of some of his visual pieces--though he avoids using film stills in his
visual poetry. My own take is that film noir as a rule seems to be,
generally, a visually rich genre, lots of accentuated (even bizarre)
camera angles, much dark/light contrast--the result, I think, of there
having been at the time in Hollywood a lot of emigrated German
cinematographers who'd done earlier work on German expressionist movies.
(Spencer could tell you whether or not that's accurate.) Many of the
"found" images in Spencer's work remind me very much of expressionist
paintings & films, & I don't think that's an accident. Spencer's work
isn't expressionistic, though it does use perhaps some of its elements.
     I said I wasn't going to "close read." Well, okay, so I'm a big
fucking liar. Turn to the page in _Malleable Cast_ (no page numbers given)
of the buckets on the stairwell, water flowing from the top bucket into
the next on the next step down, overflowing & then into the next bucket
down, overflowing there & down into the next. (Sort of looks like a Rube
Goldberg detail, eh?) Now, read the words overlayed onto this image.

        I think that this ambivalence i
        found in art today. On the o
        sary to suspect that art's involv
        clean conscience to peo
        selves up [illeg.] erything else. O
        up and [illeg.] from the world
        warm [illeg.] here they doze o
        speration and [illeg.] that are sy
        their lives. As though art flew
        hard enough. But [illeg.] again
        iew that's present with [illeg.]
        nd possibility. We'd see artists
        bing what a truly creative life co
        nderstood as the making of an off
        hing as life understood as perm

     Of course, when you look at this, the buckets dissuade reading, at
least initially, the text from left to right: what happened with me was
that, after recognizing the buckets on stairwell & water flowing down via
buckets, my eye caught certain words & phrases on the page: "art today";
"conscience"; "the world"; "they doze"; "enough"; "possibility"; "life
understood."  (What anyone picks up looking initially will obviously
differ from person to person.)
     The buckets on stairwell create a waterfall, a human-created
waterfall, something we might even recognize (given the verbal clues) as
"art." The image--given the Rube Goldbergesque impracticability of moving
water this way--might also strike one as funny. (It struck me so.)
     Spencer seems to be playing here with ideas about art ("Making of an
off/ [t]hing as life understood as perm[anent]"), and the ideas & visual
resonances I found I was picking up "reading" this piece seem to be if not
mutually exclusive opposites, certainly nothing tidily pat. The *idea* of
the buckets struck me as funny, but the image itself was actually, on
second glance, quite lovely--a tension's created between that specific
"idea" and (one of) the visual effects. We aren't "allowed" to read the
whole text, it having been cut on both ends, and illegible in spots where
the buckets've been placed over it. This gives a very "fluid" effect to
the words on the page, certain words or phrases bob & rise as though
afloat--again something reinforced for me by the image of water flowing
down the page. Spencer has--at least in this visual poem--managed to (for
this viewer) put everything into motion, despite the initial visual stasis
of a block of words overlayed over a fairly static black & white
line-drawing.
     Well, it's late & I'm out of cigarettes. I don't know if any of the
above "explains" anything, or helps--but it's something, I guess. I'd like
to hear what anyone else who's seen this book might have to say about it,
or what Spencer might have to say about my "reading" of one of its pages.
This type of book isn't for everyone, and even I think some of the pieces
in it are more successful than others, but I do want to say that I've been
picking it up at least once a day since I got it a week or so ago, &
continue to be inspired by it.

     Yours,

     Gary

Subject:      Olson

If Charles Olson really was a shy and gentle person, it is a shame
that he is not alive to hire a lawyer, a public relations firm, and
some radio time to rehabilitate his reputation.

Seriously, if there was a side of Olson that does not get into the
books about Olson, then it had better be convincingly recorded before
those who know that side have disappeared too.

To those not part of his flock he sounds pretty overbearing. It
sounds as if Jonathon Williams (I now remember that's the right
spelling, I think) is still alive--well, he struck me as an honest
person and he knew Olson as well as anybody. Let J. W. speak!

Gary,

That's a terrific reading! And I didn't know that we had more than one
Dark City author on this list either.

But I wonder how much of the concealment/revealment dynamics (a
sizeable portion of your reading) don't actually reiterate themselves on
every page in the book. What about the cole miners (on the cover and
inside a few pages beyond the cascading buckets)? Or the blindfolded
women? How do you read those pages differently? The horse playing a
flute?

There seems to be a deliberate irony set up throughout between these
consciously retro images (in the same way that rubber stamp works all
use iconography from the 1930s to early 50s) and the often philosophic
texts that underlay them. So that in the man with a drill, in the most
legible portion of the page, one reads:

          to the lack of

Ron,

        I couldn't agree with you more re RK's AXON DENDRON TREE (&
most of the others on your lost classics list). A couple years back I
thought I had convinced Pat & Marla Smith (NOTUS & OTHERWIND PRESS) to
reprint AXON DENDRON TREE -- only to find out that RK had convinced
them to do his new longish poem MONT BLANC, a lovely work, btw. There
exists thus an electronic version of ADT, as Pat had set the poem -- &
I have mentioned to Loss that this wld also be the kind of work
eminently suited to the purposes of the Poetry Archive. I haven't had
time to talk to RK (hello Robert) about it, but will, & have done so
herewith as he is a reader of this list.

        Except for Grenier's book, most all of your "lost classics"
cld in fact be brought back into a electronic poetry archive, until
some gutenbergian enthusiast is ready to reprint them. Or does that
sound like some cyber-holding tank or some post-xtian limbo 'twixt
pardiso of print & inferno of o.p.?

Great reading Gary. This is exactly the sort of thing we should be doing more
of, at least to my relatively unschooled mind.
     One of the things I deeply regret about being in Baton Rouge is the near
impossiblity of finding texts from any but the more big name small presses
(Sun & Moon, etc.). Thus I'd like to ask to list in general if they know of a
better way of ordering than to use the friendly neighborhook book store. What
we need is some type of archive of presses, something like the poetry center's,
but perhaps more comprehensive? Maybe even an electronic distribution center,
like spd, but electronic? Something like you send by e-mail a list of books
and they can get it backto you? Does something like that exist?
     I ask that because I'm very interested in Spencer's book, as well as
others listed here, but am not looking forward to a several months wait
while various distributors try to find each other, as has happened before
to me in B.R.
    Anyway, again, thanks to Gary and Ron for the readings, Eric.

Dear H.T. Kirby-Smith,

Actually, Jonathan Williams' first name is spelled just like Jonathan
Brannen's: with two "a"s. He's still alive, and still sending out
manuscripts (while temping at a nonprofit press here in MN a couple of
months ago "we" received a collection of some of his "bawdy" verk). He might
well write about Olson, though you couldn't force him, of course.

You COULD, however, "force" (or coerce) him to talk to YOU about Olson.
Some of my favorite things to read are "oral histories," of people,
places, "things." (For instance, Studs Terkel's _Work_, which I LOVE.)
Maybe you might consider going to Williams w/tape recorder, getting him
to talk about Olson. Then, moving on to others who knew him--document an
"oral history" of the guy. It's probably something you could get
published fairly easily. (Though doing it would be difficult, & require a
lot of traveling.) You'd want to talk to Cid Corman probably, who I
think's in Japan, not doing terribly well financially, I've heard.

Here in MN there's an agency that funds nothing but travel expenses for
various "critical/research" writings. Maybe there's such an agency in
your area? Maybe worth looking into...

Yours,

Gary

Dear TH Kirby-Smith:

Yeah, that's a problem the dead have, especially when the living set
out to sharpen their personal and poetical axes. If you are actually
interested in this issue, there's two places to start. One is with
Olson's poetry which, regardless of what anybody says about the man,
speaks for itself. The second place would be Ralph Maude's
newsletters, which Peter Quartermain mentioned in a recent post. Maude
has taken it upon himself to deal with the hatchet job Tom Clark
performed on Olson, through minute and careful examination of the record,
especially as it is to be recovered in the documents. Come to think of
it, there is a third place: Charles Boer's marvelous essay, *Charles
Olson in Connecticutt*. Your notion of "flocks" seems to reveal a
certain prejudice on your part. If you're willing to move beyond that,
you might be surprised what you find, not just about Olson, but about
yourself.

Best,
Mike

Greetings all--

Jonathan Williams's address (still, I think):
Box 110
Highlands, NC  28741

I didn't speak up earlier, but I am currently preparing a critical
edition of Loy's poems.  Its fate probably depends upon the demand (or
lack of) for the forthcoming SELECTED by Roger Conover (from Farrar,
Straus, Giroux);  Conover doesn't want to "flood" the market, though I've
got a zillion potential Loy projects on tap here.  Would love to talk
backchannel with anyone else interested in textual crit. or ML.

The recent discussion about the textuality of the physical book was
fascinating-- has anyone seen MY MOTHER'S BOOK, by Joan Lyons?  It's very
moving constructed as a double-hinged folio-- a twin-spined hug built in
paper, which suits the text just fine.

The discussions of close reading and textual aspects of book layout etc.
dovetail nicely in my mind around the editing of Loy's work.  I don't
think it is "constraining" at all to consider "just" the text when so
often editors misjudge the extent to which elements of textual
presentation (down to use of ampersands, numbers of dashes, white space
in medias line, and-- hardest of all to determine with Loy--
misspellings) are the "matter" of the work itself.  Susan Howe's piece on
Dickinson (in SULFUR and again in her book on American Lit) has been a
big help.  I think Loy was far more painterly and subversive than she
"looks" in her last two poetry collections (Conover has come I think to
agree)-- the SELECTED will reflect it.

Thanks for the fascinating ongoing conversation--

Marisa (currently reading Alcott's journals, Anne Porter's poems,
Padgett's translations of Cendrars, and LAMB baaa)

Jonathan Williams is indeed alive and well, and has indeed
spoken on Olson on more than one occasion. The best is
his brief 1976 memoir / portrait "Am--O" reprinted in
his collection of essays _The Magpie's Bagpipe: Selected essays_
San Francisco: North Point, 1982, 6-12.

Long, long, long, this. (Forgive me, scrollers!) Eric Pape (& others
interested in this and other Generator books), the address is at the end
of the post.

Dear Ron,
     Hey, many thanks for the kind invite to say more about _Malleable
Cast_. As to the concealment/revealment dynamics, I think you're right,
that's a lot of what seems to be going on here. Whether or not that's
going on each page, I don't know.
     The coal miner would be a great one to talk generally about since, as
you note, it's not only one of the images in the body of the book, it's
also the cover, suggesting a "visual title,"  maybe. When I think of
"mine" I think immediately of Coolidge's _Mine: the one that enters the
stories_, a lovely metaphor-- though an odd way to put it, as you'd think
he'd've used the one "WHO" enters the stories, not "THAT" (which seems to
imply "inhuman").
     "Mine" is a hinge word I hear frequently among poets who, like myself
& Spencer, create a certain amount of our work using (directly or
otherwise) found material. "Mine" as a verb (how one gets the material),
and what it becomes, having done that (the "mined" becomes "mine"). I also
think of this as a somewhat "hack" phrase: one "hacks" when mining, but
it's also, as I say, a word that gets used a lot, with as much frequency
among poets I know as "finding your voice" gets used in workshops. It's
become a cliche, or is fast becoming one.
     Before I bring J.G. Ballard into this (in a moment), here's one of
three epigraphs Spencer uses to preface _Malleable Cast_:

          "Our Fire Stone should be prepared and matured, like
          our food and all other medicines, by the corporal fire
          which reigns in the little world. Where the solar fire
          of the great world leaves off, there our corporal fire
          begins a new generation."
                                   --Basilius Valentinus

     Spencer has his own reasons for using that epigraph, but what I take
from it ("mine" from it) is that sense of a "minor"  literature (or art)
that seems to be implied by "the little world." Note the distinction above
between the fire of the "little world" and the "solar fire of the great
world." &, where the latter leaves off, is where (so I'm understanding) a
"minor"  literature picks up. (Also note the homonymous nature of "minor"
and "miner.")
     In J.G. Ballard's _Vermilion Sands_, a collection of some of his
earliest published short stories there's a fabulous (in every sense)
story, "The Singing Sculptures," about "sonic" sculpture.  A gallery owner
sells one to a rich art collector, a large statue that "sings" by virtue
of the fact that there's a tape-player in it playing pre-recorded music.
The collector seems to "fall in love" with the statue, the gallery owner
seems to "fall in love"  with the collector. (Seems to because my memory
of the story is only so-so.) The gallery owner records his own voice
singing, apparently love songs, to the collector. The collector ultimately
moves, and takes everything with her, including (so the gallery owner
thinks) the singing statue. It turns out, she'd actually hacked it to
bits; the gallery owner stumbles onto fragments of it, embedded in the
soil, actually *growing* now, and *literally* singing (in the gallery
owner's voice, & not by virtue of tape recorder).
     I've always loved this story (my memory of it) as a kind of fluid
metaphor for (a) the process of making art, & specifically art from
"found" material, and (b) its seeming preferential attitude toward "minor"
works of art. The collector couldn't bear being with the statue (the
"major" artwork here) anymore, she was "so" "in love" with it, & so hacked
it to bits & moved on. The singing sculpture, seductive as it was, was
also (note, by virtue of the tape recorder) a sham. It's not until it's
been hacked to pieces that it, genuinely, sings (if still in the voice of
the gallery owner). (Note that the resulting singing "roots" were the
result of a *collaboration*, which is what art created using found
material is, even if the other collaborators aren't "present" during the
final process.)
     Sentimental? Yes, maybe. Hackneyed? Certainly, & part of its (for me)
charm.
     Ron, you point out the anachronistic nature of the visual material
used, and the second (of 3) epigraphs seems to address that:

          The beginning, the awakening, offers itself only at the
          end as its inscription, by the writing of the
          remembrance, in its working out.
                         --Jean-Francois Lyotard

     Another possible reason for Spencer's interest in the often (though
not always) "anachronistic" imagery has probably to do with what was
available when he was growing up, when he was young & impressionable, the
things (ideas that images reinforced) experienced then. I remember at a
slide show-reading of Bernadette Mayer's _Memory_ (I think it was),
Barrett Watten asking of Bernadette: "Don't you feel that the cars, the
clothing, the hairdos, the things you've captured on film here, "date"
this piece?" Couldn't tell whether or not "date" was in the "bad" sense of
this word. (Like, the way some people feel about Donald Barthelme's
writing--"period" writing.) Well, Spencer's work, I think, uses so much of
the iconography of the 40s & 50s because that's when he grew up (as
Bernadette's piece was certainly a record of a specific time period), &
the sort of "defining" characteristics, the negative ones at least, of
that particular era are what he seems to be working against in these
visual pieces. I'm going out on a limb with that because only Spencer can
tell you whether or not this, indeed, has anything to do with his
impulses.
     But, "hacking" and "mining" (drilling, too) are, for me, much of
what's going on here (mining memory, personal and cultural, as well as
Salvation Army-type stores for books with these kinds of images). Much of
this work does seem self- referential--to me, at least.
     As far as a "close" reading of any more of these images, maybe I'll
do that with a couple & send them to you by direct e- mail, or snail-mail.
I think it can be done, I'd love to do it, but felt--given the public
nature of this medium--it might be more interesting to those reading
(w/out copies to look at) to talk more generally about the book. (Like,
maybe I think it's "not fair" to talk specifically about something here
since I can't reproduce the actual piece, given its visual nature.)
     Again, I'd really like to hear what Spencer has to say about this
book.
     Thanks again, Ron, for asking. I can't hope to make a convert of you
(or anyone else), & that's not my intention; in fact, as perverse as this
sounds, I really appreciated getting to write about this as it made me
think about my own interest in this sort of work, in "found" work, in
"minor" work, & so on. So, again, many thanks.
     Anyone who hasn't left this post out of total boredom might be
wondering: "Well, heck; how & where do I *get* this book?"  _Malleable
Cast_ was published by John Byrum's

     Generator Press
     8139 Midland Drive
     Mentor OH 44060
     U.S.A.

     It's $10.00 (not sure if you need to include shipping).  Byrum's
published numerous books & magazines over the year--most (maybe all?)
being visual poetry in one form or another. Write and ask for a catalogue
or list of "in print"s.
     I have to go eat something,
     Yours,
     Gary

Dear Gary,
yr close/intinmate reading of Selby is
fascinating to one who has not seen the book, imagining
the images and text only from what is said -- as
exciting as any 'ancient' ecphrasis for any renaissance
painter.  The pressure on exact indication turns
the prose on I suppose. (I go searching for Ezra
Pound's inistence on description, the

I would, of course, argue that this is precisely the role of an
electronic poetry archive. For those people really intent on reading
the Many instrumental works branded with the o.p. stamp, there's
little recourse, especially if they are not in the academic circles
that allow funding to travel to special collections, or unless they
know someone with an Extraordinary collection ...

op prices are extremely prohibitive - and if one were to make an
argument that electronic versions of texts don't help the author
financially, I would leap in to say that op priced texts help even
less, as the text moves from circulation to an object of
fetishization.

Of course, I have seen a number of postings here and there that
electronic copies actually boost sales of print works when both are
available. People in places not sporting comprehensive bookstores like
to browse too...

Further, the electronic "fascimile" of the work would offer the text
but would by no means ever preclude its reissuance in print nor (if
currently in print) eclipse a physical presence. I think the recent
flurry of posts on physical parameters of texts would insist on this
as well.

So, not meant to me argumentative here in any way. Pierre and I have
spoken and do agree, methinks, about the place of electronic versions
of some texts.

I mean, op only means one of two things in these cases - not
commercially expedient - or - the publisher decided it was time to put
food on the table again, rather than give it to the printers. (Unless
they were also the printer, in which case they might have decided to
cut back from forty hour weeks...)

As I say, not to argue anything here but to throw my (not entirely
unbiased) vote in for the electronic editions idea. I say, there are
many many on the list for whom I've found citations for books but
could not find an in print copy. I would guess that in this case for
most interested readers, the text would not get read.

As such, a kind of call to those who might be authors of these
classics. Contact me or Ken Sherwood via the list or privately ...

My feeling is that we've got a tremendous resource in the Electronic
Poetry Center author library and I turn this "second" to Pierre's motion
into a suggestion that one very productive development of these
valuable discussions of "classics" might be to have them equally at
our fingertips.

Subject:      Re: My Reading Selby

"Malleable Cast" can be read as a story, from first to last image. I took the
Basilius Valentinus quote at the beginning to be an alchemical metaphor like
"as above so below" or the transformative effect of spiritual fire creating
and burnishing a soul (our philosopher's stone) into something more than the
grossness of common reality, but at the same time "the ordinary of his
commonplace."

 Reading the book as a story has you starting out with the young boy and his
mother going up the metaphorical ladder (she is pushing/helping him) and
ending with the young boy holding his tank or whatever that is in his hands
out to the world. In between you have the magical creative and alchemical
processes formed by word and image that lead to the smiling lad's "patience
of the test of the world. longer passions of there is no" All the images and
text as they appear seem to tell the story of the "remembrance, in its
working out." the Lyotard quote at the beginning of the book.

I agree with Gary the images are from the forties and fifties and operate on
a subconscious as well as conscious level to evoke that time in this nation's
world building that has us where we are today. The technology and the medical
diagrams shown here are fascinating frightening and funny. A woman and young
girl stand in profile blindfolded. I had to see this as the way woman were
(still are?) when faced with survival in a culture that is antagonistic to
the inner most value systems we possess. Words float up and then away as you
try to read the poem and the image at the same time. This effect of this book
feels very much like my own creative process where the words just seem to
appear before me and then create an imagelife of their own on the page that
is neither nature nor technology nor biography nor emotions but some other
space wanting to get charted. Responding to this art/visual poetry takes
place in the guts as well as brain - anything less will be pretty cold for
this hot little black and white world.

In-Reply-To:  <199503150643.BAA20509@panix4.panix.com>

My first question concerns Olson. Since I logged on here I have been
catching bits and pieces about Olson, until tonight when I read lots of
references to him. Has something happened recently that has provoked all this
discussion? It's odd because a friend of mine recently pulled "Call Me
Ishmael" from my bookshelf and got totally involved in quite a critical way. He
totally rejected the book until the chapter on Shakespeare at which point
he became enthusiastic.

I don't really have a second question, rather a comment. I like the
discussion on visual poetry, because that is more or less where I am
coming from. This bulletin board, the way it is now configured, for me at
least, is not what I would call visual. In fact I think it discourages
visual presentation. Nevertheless it is extremely seductive.

As far as the top ten go, Kenny , all I can say is music, radio, poetry.

What is good about being part of a group of people without a rigid hierarchy
is the spontaneous. The fact that important works of art have been lost
is very disturbing. However, an idea can be passed from one individual to
another. I am enough of an egoist to want people to know who I am, but I
also know that great works of art have been produced anonymously by
groups of people. Not an easy postion to take in an environment that
stresses the individual, but one that might help us into the future.

Next I wonder if anyone knows whatever happened to Gegrory Corso, and
also if anyone knows why his poetry was cut out of the second edition
of the Norton Anthology of Modern Poetry. Seems to me he was
rather indifferent to reputation, like some other people I've heard
of. He seemed a kind of comic Whitman to me. I keep him going with
xeroxes.

Oh it was good to hear about the Mina Loy revival. And I look forward
to seeing Cendrars made available in English--"Blaise, est-ce que
nous sommes tres loin de Monmartre?" (Song of the Trans-Siberian
Railroad).

Would you believe that Mina Loy was one of the poets most admired by
Yvor Winters, at least when he was a young man--when he and Williams
were still on terms of mutual admiration?

In response to several messages and again to Kenny Goldsmith, the Segue
Catalog which was published by Segue from 1981(?) through 1994 was a
curated list of what I and a few others thought was each year's best new
publication and the most important of the past few years. Usually books
stayed on the list only three years, although some books, by their
centrality were kept on longer. I also kept Roof Books on as long as they
were in print. This then represents the list of books that the poets
chose, primarily east coast writers, although the major west coast
writers were polled every year by mail. Some responded regularly and some
didn't. Since I don't remember all the names of the people who
contributed to the list I will not mention names for fear of angering
someone I forget. The list is pretty accurate in terms of how the
material was collected. Over 100 publishers were asked for their list of
books. People who are new to the poetry group would have been on the list
had they been around as late as 1993 and actively going to readings.
Someone like Kenny it has been pointed out might have received 5 or 6
copies. There were generally about 10,000 copies of the list circulated
which made it the widest circulation publication in this poetry circle.
Lists included were the Segue Foundation list, MLA selected lists, and
library lists. When NEA defunded the list I asked people if anyone could
help it to continue, but the $10,000 short fall was too much for anyone
to bear to accommodate my taste and the taste of a few poets who were
willing to donate their curatorial time. So 1994 was the last list.

Again, I will send out the compiled list when it's completed.

The _Collected_ was actually just reprinted by University of California

The Collected O'Hara is in fact just now back in print, in paper from the

consultant on the project, I suggested that they try to price the book to make
it competitive with the Random House (I think) Selected, hoping that for a
couple of bucks more teachers, for instance, would be willing to order the
Collected over the Selected for classes. So please consider that possibility
if you're in the business of teaching O'Hara. And all interested parties who
are not will hopefully want to have the book anyway . . .

Dear Colleen, Tony Green & inbetween,
     Tony: okay, I won't hold out on you. Was very glad, Colleen, you
posted about _Malleable Cast_--you're absolutely right that this's to be
taken in thru the gut as well as the head. And what you say about the two
blindfolded women in profile sounds absolutely right. (Note how the word
"SHE" falls right there, on the taller woman's blindfold.)
     & Colleen, what you say about _Malleable Cast_ being read as a
narrative sounds absolutely right, too. The book is, after all, squarish,
one visual per page, sort of like a storyboard, or successive film stills.
I wonder, though, about what's gained (vs. what's lost) reading the book
from cover to cover, without considering other options. You're right; the
two images opening & closing the book are closely related. But, note that
the woman pushing the boy up the ladder (first image) is pushing him *out*
of the book (to the left, against English-language reading, which goes
from left to *right*). (& that's not something I thought about so much,
but felt, in my gut.) Since Spencer's doing these things on
transparencies, I'd imagine if he wanted to, he could easily have reversed
this image so the boy was being pushed *into* the book, not out of it.
(*That's* something I thought about.)
     Also, consider the title: _Malleable Cast_. Cast as in "cast of
characters" (so narrative's right on here) or in the sense of something
being cast (a line, as in "fishing"--what both you & I are doing writing
about the work, as well as how Spencer put it together, physically) or,
finally, in the sense of a cast, like a mould. But, it's "malleable"--thus
working against the idea of characters in the workshop sense (w/traits
that *determine* character), and also against a linear reading--from cover
to cover--of this book. Sure, this (these images, in this order) is how
it's been cast, but the impulse (suggested by "malleable" in the title)
seems to be suggesting that the reader might work against that. Myself,
first I read this book from the center out, as the images on both ends
seem "exits" of a sort. But, it can be read otherwise, too. (I always
remember Spencer as being the person who introduced me to Chaos theory,
which seems to work against linearity.)
     This is not to suggest that there isn't a narrative element working
here: I think you're right, Colleen; there is. And also, again, your
reading of the epigraphs seem dead on, having much more to do with what's
here than what I'd (first) taken from it.  So, thanks for your splendid
reading.
     Spencer? How come you've been silent through all this? Did you
construct this book as a narrative? As a linear narrative? How do you
feel about our readings--encouraged? Discouraged? These aren't rhetorical
questions, my friend ... this seems a great opportunity to get an
author's response to readings ...

Subject:      Re: Achilles' shield

Bill Luoma  (et al)  "  Were there words on Achilles' shield?"

The last word on Achilles's shield was Homer's, I believe.

Seriously, as a proposal, why not a shield with words on it for
Achilles?   However, the series: words - rebus - image
(or another series words-theatre-image?) allow transition from
word-text to image to become comprehensible.  Perhaps.  Anyone
have any ideas on this?

But the Selby book sounds like it's mixed image and text, which makes
the effort to ex-plain in it in order to convince Ron Silliman of it's
value(s) stress the functioning of the image-in-the-text.  Word-text
would be simply reproducible/quotable on e-mail but the particular
appearance of this book is "transmitted"  (translated, betrayed) via
word-text only.  That's why I was fascinated by the resultant
posts of Gary.

The only book by my bed for the last week and a half has been the new
"Collected O'Hara." I've been sleeping very well after my 20-40 minute
perusings.

Though the book's a treasure here's one I keep passing through - POLOVTSOI
(p 430)

white
                                                            blood

            contend

                                          disperse


Can anyone tell me what Polovtsoi is? Polovoi (with various endings) in
Russian is  in one meaning an adjective - sexual. But I'm not sure of this
at all, particularly with the -tsoi ending. I could be way off the track.

Subject:      More Sixties Gold

Thinking further of great books from the 1950s and '60s that definitely
deserve to be preserved and put forward.

When the Sun Tries to Go On by Kenneth Koch. This 113 page poem is one
of the founding documents of the New York School. It was published in a
little magazine called Hasty Papers and then released as a book by Black
Sparrow in 1969 with a cover and 5 collages by Larry Rivers in an
edition of 1500. It's never been republished and Koch chose not to
excerpt from the poem in his Selected Poems in hopes of eventually
having the whole again in print. It's the most spontaneous and surreal
work of Koch's.

Poem of the Cid, translated by Paul Blackburn. The goofiest publication
of a major poem during that entire decade and maybe ever this appeared
as a "Study Master Publication" in 1966, a competitor with Cliff Notes.
It's an infinitely better poem in English than the Merwin (as anything
by Blackburn is, even tho I admit that I admire some of Merwin's work.
This was the source for Dorn's Gunslinger epic. 151 pages sans Spanish
in the original.

Others that come to mind include John Weiners' Hotel Wently Poems (the
impact of that book, with the Robert LaVigne illustrations, gets lost in
a larger gathering, as does Spicer s Language, for example; my copy of
the Weiners originally belonged to Bill Bathurst during his heavy
recreational pharmaceuticals period, bleary pen doodles everywhere;
Keith Abbott tells me he s cleaned his act up and is now serving as a
consultant to one of the  post-communist  countries in Eastern Europe),
Joanne Kyger s The Tapestry and the Web, Phil Whalen's On Bear's Head
(Norman Fischer is working on this as we speak), Kathleen Fraser's What
I Want, Curtis Faville's Stanzas for an Evening Out, and possibly Tom
Clark's Neil Young. There are some critical texts that also would
warrant rescuing: David Ossman's The Sullen Art, the original
Olson/Creeley Mayan Letters.

Subject:      Re: close reading

   An open question--When people read (whether it's "close or not"--you
   decide what to call it), do you (plural) tend to mark up the margins
   alot? Do you sit there with a notebook? Do you find that you write
   more WHILE reading--(I i.e. do you read to write), or do you see these
   as discrete activities more often than not? If you do write in the
   margines alot does that have something to do with whether you like
   long-lined or short-lined poems? Does the kind of poem Spencer Selby
   just posted "turn you on?" By "kind of poem" I mean a certain kind of
   balanced lyric formal diction and tone that is not in much contemporary
   poetry I'm aware of...a refusal of gaudy gimmicks...a poem that "looks
   like a lyric" in a certain old-fashioned sense allegedly of "gem-like"
   White Buildings Crane--or at least the momeory of it, a certain modesty
   that is also authority...Personally I tend not to separate reading and
   writing much...I am interested in a discursive mode of close reading that
   doesn't exist until I do it...I am in academia now and am trying not to
   let that get in the way...or am trying to find a way NOT to let it get
   in the way...The great taboos surround seemingly in force...One could
   say they're only in "the mind."---Chris Stroffolino

     Addendum:--When I say I am in academia now and am trying not to let
     that get in the way, I am aware that this statement can also apply
     to editors. There are several editors of magazines, journals and
     books here "on line," I am curious what they feel their involvement
     with contemporary poetry manuscripts is like...Partially because that
     is not as much what i'm reading now as dead people (though not just
     "white guys"), I mean IS dead people--I'm curious about other people's
     "balancing" between not just between "dead" and "alive" writers...
     but also about what they feel this does to their sense of poetry or
     writing or whatever...(you could talk about MUSIC too, do rock lyrics
     effect your writing sometimes more strongly, assuming you're VERBAL
     suggestive, if not quite STRICTLY referring only to other texts...

Alan--

bravo and kudos (and huzzahs!).  will do, absolutely.

I have a couple/few copies of the collected as first published, designed to
be a big book that would look something like the Stevens Collected
apparently.  The cover on the Selected (the Rivers sketch w Frank's prick
prominently displayed) was supposed to be the cover to the original
hardbound and I THINK that there were a very few of those distributed
(rather like a stamp w the flag upside down now....) before Random House
chickened out (all this, baffled by several years [loss of] memory from
David Shapiro); but the bowdlerized version has an absolutely beautiful
photo of Frank on the cover.

Did "Berdie" get restored to the index (it was in the table of contents but
not the index in the Collected, and NOT in the Selected--a really beautiful
poem)?  There are a number of other amazing poems not in the Selected, so
this is Good News Indeed!

Subject:      Re: Bedside Books

Books I'm either reading or about to that I forgot because I was
scribbling my email at work (avoiding the completion of a white paper on
"What is PC Asset Management?"):

Culture on the Brink: Ideologies of Technology, edited by Gretchen
Bender & Timothy Druckrey (Bay Press' DIA series), with pieces by
Stanley Aronowitz, Paula Treichler (Cary Nelson's SO) on AIDS and
Identity, Langdon Winner, Laurie Anderson, Avital Ronell, and Andrew
Ross. Anderson is the only one I didn't actively solicit for work when I
edited Socialist Review. These other folks are all terrific, but I will
be very curious to see if they actually understand what they're talking
about in this terrain. If I had a dime for every bad piece of writing on
technology meets culture, I'd never work again.

New Left Review 209 (Jameson on Derrida & Marx, Stuart Hall on Carribean
identity, Geras on Rorty, some other excellent looking pieces [meaning I
haven't read them yet]). Looks like the best issue of NLR in about 5
years.

Made to Seem, Rae Armantrout's new book from Sun & Moon. This is
rereading really, since I see most of these poems in manuscript first
(often in ten or twelve different versions with just one word or a line
break altered). Seeing them in a book is always a curious experience for
me since it means that they have now been "pinned down" in a way they
seldom seem to be "in life." Here's my favorite this week:

MY PROBLEM

It is my responsibility
to squeeze
the present from the past
by demanding particulars.

When the dog is used
to represent the inner
man, I need to ask,
"What kind of dog is it?"

If a parasitic
metaphor grows all
throughout--good!
Why stop with a barnacle?

A honeysuckle,
thrown like an arm,
around a chain-link fence,
would be far more

articulated,
more precisely repetitive,
giving me the feeling
that I can go on like this

while the woman
at the next table says,
"You smell pretty,"

and sends her small daughter's
laugh, a sputtery orgasm,
into my ear--

though this may not have been
what you intended.

It may not be a problem
when I notice
the way the person shifts.

Rae's poems often have the hallucinated clarity of a dream state (maybe
in this case, with the decidedly incestuous undertone of the mother
initiating the daughter's "orgasm," one of the dwarf dreams out of Twin
Peaks). Behind that lucidity the "narrative frame" is often either
unclear or unimportant compared with the rhetoric or structure of the
argument at the surface (a particularly Lacanian view of content I
suppose). I can't tell if the Bromige allusion in the title is intended
or not.

There's also a lengthy piece on Armantrout (the first that I'm aware of)
by Jeffrey Peterson in the new Sagetrieb. I continue to be amazed that
Rae hasn't been the "crossover" success of LangPo & G1 generally, but
where some fall back on beauty, humor, or anger posed as satire, Rae
never pulls punches in her work. The largest book to date is a selected
published in France in French. Amazing!

This takes things from the sixties into the seventies and even eighties,
but people on this list should also know that bp Nichol's The Martyrology
has been re-issued by Coach House Press, Toronto (always difficult to
find in this country, but perhaps SPD has them (at times they've had
Nichol's work & Coach House titles, but not consistently, the fault, I
believe, not being theirs, rather Coach House & the difficulty of dealing
with customs, etc.). These works are 9 volumes in, I believe, 6 books.
They are most definitely worth the read, although Nichol's other
collections have a variousness I am often drawn to even more. (Thanks
again, Joel K. & Bill H., for taking me to Toronto recently to see the
concrete poem in the concrete on bpNichol Lane).

As to reading, beside my bed are John Cage: Composed in America, ed. M.
Perloff & C. Junkerman (Univ. of Chicago Press, 1994), Robin Blaser's The
Holy Forest (Coach House, 1993), How to Make an Antique (artist's book by
Karen Wirth & Robt. Lawrence (pub. by the artists, 1989), Kevin Magee's
Tedium Drum (lyric &, 1994). I'm carrying around with me Kit Robinson's
Balance Sheet (Roof, 1994) and various books of poems by Emily Dickinson
(I seem to do that periodically). I'm looking at Keith Smith's
Non-Adhesive Binding, which gives fantastic ideas & instruction for real
& possible book structures. And I'm reading Tom Peters's The Pursuit of
Wow, which is very silly, but refreshes me on the need to be creative in
managing & directing an organization and the people who work with me
there. I'm also reading manuscripts by Anne Tardos and
typesetting/designing manuscripts/books by Mary Margaret Sloan and Myung
Mi Kim. A manuscript of sonnets by Tom Mandel is never far away, trying
to figure its best way to become the astonishing book it needs to be.

Subject:      anew strain?

      "the rage of Caliban seeing his own face in the glass"

1.
Anew strain. A new strain with the look of the mainstream.

2.
Fragmentation. Is what most do, read a whole text that might challenge
their values, but never be sobered by that, jump, hop, scotch.

3.
Language. Making a fashion, shared agenda, purity, is exactly what those who
write "communicative" poetry, with "images" and "feeling" do; and they feel
we exclude them as we they do us - though they hold more money in the market.

4.
Camp. Ashbery homage. As if one were Ashbery, imagining a political agenda
for his work that John himself doesn't have; very simple politic "accept gays"
and then lots of in-jokes, and exclusionary tactics for those not in the
polari syntax. "Savour painting more", as well, perhaps.

4.
Fragmentation. As indication that one had in fact read and loved the whole
of Dante and Ovid, and one's own poem is a furthering synergy, overhearing
the private and succinct conversation of Dante and Ovid knowing and loving
each other utterly and planning a collaborative project.

3.
Originary energy 1978-82. G1, not easy to take the pot calling the kettle
over-boiled when both thin the paint for yet another go at a one-colour

Subject:      Re: "Berdie" and "Berdie, Berdie"

The first line of "Berdie" is in the index, yes. Another poem, "Song of
Ending," starting with "Berdie, berdie" has a particularly Rilkean feel to
it, ending with:

...they disappear with one

last cry, not echoing, and then
the emptiness is full of light.

Berdie, not to be sad and crazy,
all birds hide what the have lost.

compared to another ending:

...and distant calls of birds , while in the sky
the starry nights of another, sweeter country
blossomed above them and would never close.


from Rilke's "Tombs of the Hetaerae." In all likelyhood this is just
chance, or a habit of mine of forcing pieces of the puzzle together. It
would be interesting to find out, if anyone knows, O'Hara's feelings toward
Rilke and whether he'd ever been known to carry around a copy of "New
Poems."

   Dear patrick--interesting question--I always had this hunch that
   early Rilke, such as "Tombs" is more like O'Hara, whereas Duino
   Elegies is more like Ashbery. Perloff, I think, links Three Poems
   to Notebooks of...Brigg...and in her book on O'Hara claims some
   Rilke influence on him, but this is a question that could be looked
   into further...Chris

Thanks to Ron, Gary, Colleen, Bill and others for their interest and
thoughts about _Malleable Cast_. I am flattered by this discussion, which
I have hesitated to enter because I believe the work does best on its own
and because I don't believe my ideas about it are more valid than others.
If not for Gary, I would probably leave it at that. But he has persuaded
me to say more, to overcome my hesitation and share a few of my
thoughts about the book.
        Reactions to this work vary quite a bit. Some people think the
writing is too fragmentary, interrupted or concealed, and that the images
predominate. Others are able to derive a lot meaning from the words and
phrases that appear and the way they play off or interact with the images.
I prefer the latter approach, but that does not mean I think there's
anything wrong with the former, or with just treating these pieces as
visual. I believe the words have an effect whether it is consciously
recognized or not. (Providing you can read English, which has not always
been the case, as these pieces have been published in many foreign
countries.)
        As Gary has pointed out, the title can be a very good place to
start. Malleable cast metal and a malleable cast of characters are primary
for me. The malleable cast of characters is what is presented in this
work. Malleable cast metal evokes a process that is both industrial and
that reaches back before modern industry. It evokes a process of fusion
thru heat, which is both metaphorical and one of the foundations of modern
society.
        The idea of fusion underpins the entire book and the many linkages
that are made or attempted. Central among these are science, alchemy and
the quotidian. Searching, building and striving are balanced against
disease, blindness and the static normality of American life, which is
graphically (and humorously) portrayed by these images from the 30's, 40's
and 50's. Many of the images contain their own antithesis, as when this
normality appears more bizarre than anything else. Strange juxtapositions
abound which link past with present, and which link the social threads
with the more immediate issues that center on the nature of this work as
art that fuses image and word. This fusing is a kind of alchemy in which
the characters and pieces are definitely malleable. The malleable cast
that has a historical foundation is thus integrally related to the
malleability of the works themselves. The work is both private and public,
mirrorlike and a kind of social biography. Word and image interrogate the
relationship between word and world. And that again involves questions
about the reader or viewer's relationship with the art or medium which
makes the interrogation possible.
        All of these questions are open-ended, but they also have answers
which are embedded in the work. The reader/viewer may pick up a shovel and
acknowledge identification with the miner on the cover of the book. In
doing that she should be able to tap into more of the ore and treasures
that this world/work may offer.
        Spencer Selby
        P.S. I did not construct the work as a narrative, at least not at
first. The sequence was determined for the book, which was a year after
the pieces were completed. There may be some narrative idea behind the
sequence. It seems to me a valid way of approaching the work, though not at
all necessary.

Anyway, in that Jan. message, you were arguing with something you

Well, even if we could find out that there were words on Achilles's
shield, I am pretty sure that we would find out that they were
foreign words, so what would be the use?
Or maybe we would find out that he used words AS shields, the way so
many of us do, Language poets and shy fellows.

Patrick:

this is prolly like the blind trying to lead the one-eyed (pardon my
ablism) but in my scrawled notes on "A Step Away from Them" (in the
margins I mean) some made recently but this one made in David Shapiro's
amazing seminar about twenty years ago now, I have, laeding out from the
beautiful "where the sign / blows smoke over my head, and higher / the
waterfall pours lightly," this: "cf. Rilke, /Duino Elegies,/: "And
higher, the news atars in the land of pain."  The problem is that David,
too, heard echoes everywhere, so who knows?  Like Douglas (in this
respect though not in many others) he's presumably not on email.
As presumably not, too, is Kenneth, who just came up again via Ron
Silliman.  Apparently there's still time to send on birthday greetings
for the 70th birthday celebration mentioned by Marisa Januzzi on this
list a couple weeks ago--in c/o her, perhaps, being one possible route.

Yes, it's true that anyone who wants to convey birthday messages to be
read at KK's birthday celebration can e-mail them to me at
<jma5@columbia.edu>.  We're asking that the messages not take more than 3
minutes to read.  If anyone plans to be in NYC, the time and place are:
7PM Thursday March 23, Maison Francaise, Columbia University, 116th and
Broadway.  For more specific info or directions, of course feel free to
contact me.  Ron Padgett will coordinate various readers and readings and
theatricals and confessions and home movies, and we will have cheese.

Gass gave a reading with Gaddis at the 92Street Y a few weeks ago; don't
know if that counts as fanfare for his new book, but it was a good
reading with Gaddis acting very grumpy about the whole thing.  If anyone
gets through the entire TUNNEL I would be very curious to hear about the
cumulative effect.

H.T. Kirby-Smith mentioned poetry in the 1500s that tried to
accomodate appearance on the page to content. Now, I have a lot of
trouble with that concept--the idea of poetry's containing something.
I know that it is a term long in use, but ever since I first heard it
I have wanted to have it explained to me. What is the "content" of a
poem. How can a poem be a container? Isnt it words that dissapewar as
sound into the air and down people's earholes? As written how will it
contain. What would be an example of something contained in a
poem-container? I am not fooling here.

friends--

response to yesterday's call for reviewers has been quick & generous;
many thanks to all.  mindful of past discussions (and past issues of
TRR), i notice that all offers so far have been from men.  before
i give the boys first pick, i'd like to enter a plea to women on
the list to consider contributing...  as mentioned, in addition to
titles listed in the post, current poetry/lit/language/intermedia
releases from any small independent presses would be welcome (tho
best to check first, in order to avoid duplication).  the aim of
TRR is to help connect readers to a variety of new work--a variety
of perspectives is essential in reaching that goal.

&, tho i'd _not_ want to see exclusively gender-correlated reviewers,
i'll point out that almost half of the authors on the initial list
are women.

again, _many_ thanks to the folks who've offered so far--i'm sure
you'll understand this as no slight...

sincere

in your reading list you mention lew ellingham's book on
jack spicer.  I am currently writing on spicer (or, at least
on the cusp of writing) and am interested in hearing what
you have to say about ellingham's book.  I think I have
read more anecdotes than insights on spicer.

ryan: there are 2 versions of ellingham's ms --one a rich and lively (though
over-long and unfocused) set of oral histories centered on spicer but addressing
the entire gay/beat/bohemian/poetic scene of north beach in the 50s and 60s in
much particularity --lots of thumbnail portraits of folks like russell
fitzgerald (whose beautiful journals are copiously quoted), bob kaufman (on whom
fitzgerald had a mad crush), paul alexander, joanne kyger, etc.  the other
version is a biographical distillation of the longer ms.--i'm only on p 100 or
so of that one.  what this version gains in brevity and focus it loses in
intensity; there are fewer readings of poems (spicer's and other's) and less
in-depth discussion of poetics.  what u say about the rich anecdotal lore on
spicer outweighing the serious consideration of his poetics is interesting; i
think this often happens with "cult figures"; one way of looking at this is to
grant that analysis might be embedded in these anecdotes and could be teased out
--that these anecdotes are part of the poetics relevant to whatever poet seems
to end up being talked about this way.  because the layering of legend around a
"poet" and his "poems" becomes part of the context that determines the meaning
and substance of his/her oeuvre, just as clifford geertz's "thick description"
is part of the ethnography the anthropologist generates. what "cultural work" is
accomplished by these anecdotes and the need to tell them?  whaddya
think?--maria

Dear Chris Stroffolino,
         Can you identify what in academia appears to prevent you
from sharing your reading-writing practice without let or stay or
looking over the shoulder for hindrance?  Is there a conflict between
poetry as a practice and academic demands?

dear Tony Green --

your question about poetry is addressed to Chris S., but i
couldn't let it go.  there is, anyway here where i am a
dissertator & instructor, zero encouragement to do anything
other than these 2 things.  & i sense, often, that people who
write poetry while they are pursuing academics are seen as
double-dippers, can't quite make up their minds, poor things,
& after all the creative act can have a kind of dulling,
happifying effect on them, when they ought to know it's best to
use all one's mental energy to think sharply & clearly, to
reach objectivisms of the mind, to EXPLAIN without sievey
effect certain small truths about certain pre-written arenas.

pardon the tone, perhaps.  but i think i found your question
remarkable, & i wonder if there is not this division in NZ?
let me add: as academic expands it seems there are some people
& places where this conflict is not so evident -- i felt this
at the Louisville conference -- & that change makes me more
content to be, as it were, institutionalized.
        & so i continue to write poetry, too.

Dear Lisa,
         NZ has much the same noxious divisions as pretty well anywhere else
in English speaking academia -- of the kind you write about.  I'm
interested in resistances, cross-overs, infiltration strategies.
Hence my  question on this list ( to Chris and anyone else).  Charles
Bernstein's A Poetics is a point of resistance for me.
         Looking for professional philosophers to back up an idea I
had about Descartes's narrative of doubt and certainty, I found, on
Friday, Dalia Judovitz "Subjectivity and Representation in Descartes"
 C.U.P.1988 (writing that goes back to early 1980's) , proposing to
cross  frontiers, with: " ...the foundation of subjectivity as a
philosophical construct is inseparable from its literary
representation as an autobiographical, historical and narrative
entity".  Sounds promising (intro.p.3)   Who made the division (and
when) between literary and philosophical?  The questions get to beg
for Foucaultian answers pretty fast.

Best wishes

Subject:      Groovy Books

An extension of the "Sixties Gold/Classic O.P." discussion:

                          TEN GROOVY BOOKS

     KEY: Groove Factor 1-3 = "Groovy"
          Groove Factor 4-6 = "Very Groovy"
          Groove Factor 7-9 = "Totally Groovy"
          Groove Factor 10 = "Oh My Fucking God That Is Like
                              Totally *Beyond* Groovy"

     Call me a fetishist, but what *I* like are "groovy" books.
     "What the hell does that mean?"
     "By what measure--'grooviness'?"
     "Does the work *in* the book have to be 'good' for a book to be
considered groovy?"
     "Can a 'fine print' edition of something be 'groovy'?"
     Hey, thanks for asking. Well, first of all, *obviously* everyone's
going to have different ideas as to what's "groovy."  For me, "groovy's
measure" is something I feel first in my gut then, later, spend hours on
the phone with friends, "verifying."  I'll describe the book, after which
point I'll ask, "So, is this groovy, or what?" A "yes" answer from more
than 1/2 of all queried friends "verifies" grooviness. Level of
queried-friend enthusiasm determines Groove Factor. A "no" answer from
more than 1/2 can either (a) lower Groove Factor, or (b) annul said book's
"groovy" status. (Book becomes "just-a-book.") No, the work
doesn't *necessarily* have to be any good. But, it helps. Lastly,
"groovy," like "campy," is a value attributed more by audience
member, than maker. Most "fine print" editions--lovely though they
might be--are not "groovy." (It's a distinction that admittedly still
needs work.) (Chris Stroffolino, as someone in academia who's also
interested in contemporary rock music, you might be the perfect person
to--perhaps as a thesis?--hammer out the above admittedly "foggy notion"s
of "grooviness" into a "sharp" essay.)
     So, in no particular order, here are 10 randomly chosen "groovy"
books ...
     Alfred Tennyson, _Lover's Tale_, Walton Press, no copyright date.
This hardcover (library binding?) of Tennyson's poem includes three
"found" photos by Bern Porter. I gave this book 1 Groove Unit for each
photo. Three photos x 1 Groove Unit ea. = GROOVE FACTOR 3.
     Chris Mason, _Click Poems_, Shabby Editions, 1982. "The Click Poems
were inspired by and are dedicated to the click language of the Bushmen in
South Africa, and the Ameslan sign language of the deaf community of the
United States." A beautiful mini-chap w/extraordinary work (can't
reproduce here; poems use "fermatas", illustrations of lips &etc.,
scribbled out text) found used in MPLS. GROOVE FACTOR: 5. Hey, wait! The
address says "c/o Cris Cheek"! And Cris is on this list! I've "talked to"
Cris! GROOVE FACTOR: 7.
     Jack Spicer, _After Lorca_, (picture of cone = press name?), 1974. A
reprint (pirated?). Blue ink. The verso of the title page says: "This book
has been typed on an IBM Selectric blah, blah, blah, by Robin Cones and
printed by Marco Polio for the Government, with a cover from a photo by
blah, blah, blah, in March, 1974." Anyone know who made this book?
Delicious! GROOVE FACTOR: 10.
     Patti Smith, _Seventh Heaven_, Telegraph Books, 1972.  Patti's first
book, I think. GREAT cover photo: looks like Patti hasn't bathed since
1966, struggling to keep eyes open.  Dedication: "this book is dedicated
to/ Mickey Spillane/ and/ Anita Pallenberg." How groovy? GROOVE FACTOR 8.
     James Sherry, _In Case_, Sun & Moon Press, 1981. Great lurid pulp
cover, text pages printed on *pulp stock paper*. Jonathan Brannen (a
frequent Groove Consultant) mentioned that he'd seen a review of this book
that actually *criticized* the book for having been printed on such
"cheap" paper. (Critic obviously didn't "get" it.) GROOVE FACTOR
(including Brannen's anecdote):  6.
     Maxine Chernoff, _A Vegetable Emergency_, Beyond Baroque Foundation,
1977. This 8-1/2" x 11" printed on cheap stock was published in an edition
of EIGHT THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED copies.  *Tell* me that's not groovy. Bonus
Groove Unit as I got it signed by Chernoff in '93, who explained the high
press run: "Yeah, they, um, they printed an awful lot of these." GROOVE
FACTOR: 6.
     James Haining (editor), _Salt Lick_ Vol. 2, Nos. 1-2, 1972.  Every
issue of _Salt Lick_ is groovy, but this one particularly so. Includes
Gerald Burns' _Boccherini's Minuet_ as a make-it- yourself chapbook insert
(!); also includes poems by Robert Slater, Robert Trammell's "George
Washington Trammell," poems by Ann Darr, Stephen Leggett, Bruce Andrews'
"Getting Ready To Be Frightened" ("go Gandhi go"), poems by James Haining,
drawings by Wilton David, and essays & reviews by Burns, Michael Lally, Al
Drake, Andrews, Victor Contoski, Darr, Ron Silliman, Daniel Castelaz, and
Haining. Reading this, you get the sense that, in 1972, anything might've
happened. Incredible list of Books & Mags received. GROOVE FACTOR: 10.
     J H Prynne, _Kitchen Poems_, Grossman/Cape Goliard, 1968.  Top o' the
line poetry, *beautiful* edition (great two-page "trig" drawing in red on
title & facing pages). GROOVE FACTOR 9.  (Docked one point from perfect
score only because I found two copies in the same used bookstore.) (Groove
"aura" loss.)
     Robert Gluck, _Marsha Poems_, Hoddypoll Press, 1973. Instead of
stapling this 8-1/2" x 11", the publisher bound it with red string. Also,
"Marsha"--the cartoon woman on the cover--has red flowers felt-tip penned
onto her dress. GROOVE FACTOR: 5.
     Tom Weatherly, _Maumau American Cantos_, Corinth Books, 1970. The
title? *Way* "seventies." Includes subtitles like: "roi rogers and the
warlocks of space." You know what I'm thinkin'?  I'm thinkin': GROOVE
FACTOR 8.
     That's ten. Groovy.
     Yours,
     Gary

Hi Gary.  You did not mention that you, yourself, Gary Sullivan, have a
"groove factor" of about 11 or 12.

And even those numbers are too pubescent to describe the full engorged groove
factor you walk amidst, like an angel in a cloud.

Thanks--for being you.

maria--in response to your response re spicer and that "the layering
of legend around a 'poet' and his 'poems' becomes part of the context
that determines meaning".

Thanks for your thoughts on both versions of Ellingham's book.
As for your ideas on anecdotes, it raises an interesting problem.
It seems to me, in the reading I have done around Spicer, that
anecdotes are the preferred critical point of departure because
there isn't really an easily and accessible language to discuss
his work with/within.  I'm thinking of Blaser's essay at the
end of the collected works as perhaps the closest example of
writing which comes as close as it can to Spicer's writing
against the poem as "container" (to quote another e-list topic).
It seems to me that because much of his poetry occurs in dis-
ruption, in the space between form/referent, original/translation,
world/poem (Lorca's lemons, for instance or the necessity of
resonance in the serial poem), a stable, critical discourse is
the wrong bone to pick with.
Or, maybe not.  Any thoughts?

   Dear Tony and Lisa--I guess it's a question of "finding a niche" or
   questioning what is allegedly considered "marketable" out there--I
   may be "naively" "deluding" myself--but I wonder about what is considered
   "fashionable" in academia today and how many people (whether as poets or
   not) seem to be cowering under these dimly perceived "demands of the
   marketplace"--As a student, I have no answers but hunches at present
   about such "ways and means" and 'strategies of subversions"--However,
   the division between "philosophy and literature" I do not see as a
   problem Foucault has answered--in fact, Foucauldianisn may be part of
   the problem itself (not that there isn't "value" in Foucault)...the
   question in some ways is perennial--depsite the generational specificity
   one could appeal to in terms of academic and economic realities...
   This is probably too vague... but, for the most part, unlike Lisa, I
   have suspended my so-called "poetic" activities in my first year here
   as a graduate student...(though that my change)...Chris S.

Hi  Chris,
      The question is not quite so easy:      If your practice with
texts is margin writing, how far does that notion of writing figure in what you
do elsewise in the setting of the academy?     Is this a fair
statement of a position that some people might hold:  "Much of what I am
interested in  doing as a writer would fit better with
some rather different academy than the one I'm actually in --- but I
persist.  This brings with it some conflict, but in the long term
this produces pressure on the academy to change."  (Wystan Curnow said
something like this in a post a few months ago in a discussion of the
academy.  It can harbour difference, sometimes.)  In the end, the
academy cannot do without a renewal of productive activity.

The funny thing about the Descartes book by Judowitz is that so far I
can't see it taking advantage of the possibilities of narrative or autobiographical or
fictional strategies itself: it remains expository discourse of a
familiar enough kind.

But Susan Howe's writing on Emily Dickinson, that's a model that not
too many academic readers will happily endorse, and recommend to
their students as models....?... (I hope I'm wrong on that).

So Foucault, and what ever else by way of theory, may show where the
problem lies, but  doesn't necessaril;y
change anything in practice.

P.S. I've misread you, Chris.  Foucault is part of the problem?  Oh,
I was thinking of the Archaeology of Knowledge and the analysis of
the how writing is controlled and authorised by institutional
set-ups.  So I was seeing the problems of writing in the academy
in terms of what is permitted and what is not by the institution.

I also think now of the evident difficulties that occurred when
Charles Olson delivered his Beloit lectures (No theme sentences!) or
the account of the last days of Olson by Charles Boer.  Olsonian
practice looks as remote from academic respectability as
ever...raising the question, just how  "serious" is he as a
historian?....(How many writers on history or mythology cite his
views as support?.....)

objectively (a la science perhaps? or a la someone's misconception of
science?) and the fuzzy poor thing double dippers who write--what, for
enjoyment?  I have hardly written a poetic or fictional word since I came
to begin this Fddd.  Am finally doing so again because taking a class on
surrealism where the prof actually believes in writing like to learn
about.  But sometimes I feel as though I'm having my bones pared down in
an effort to get me to think in a way that don't come naturally.

   Dear Tony, Lisa, Gabrielle, etc.--
   When Tony writes "If your practice with texts is margin writing..."
   I wonder IF my practice with texts IS margin writing, and I distrust
   what i will call my own tendency to introject and/or employ such
   academic/professional buzzwords...and I'd like to think thatin academia
   the "use" of such terms does not automatically imply a too eager attitude
   towards "marketability"--etc. I don't think it's just true at my school,
    (though i may be overgeneralizing--especially in this age of Newt gingrich
    and Allan Bloom), that there is a lot of discourse that announces itself
    as "margin writing" because it is fashionable to do so...Whether this
    really is margin writing of course is a more interesting question because
    it allows one to see the OLD IN THE NEW and the NEW IN THE OLD...This does
   not mean that I do not wish my dissertation to "explode academic discourse"
   as much as MY EMILY DICKINSON does...But I do not want to be self-congratula
   tory about how "unigue" and "new" and "progressive" either "I" or "my people"   are--I guess I see such posturing as "getting in the way of the real issues"
   (as James Sherry read me months ago), and by "real issues" I just mean the
   possibility of COMMUNICATION of a more intimate sort occuring in institutional  contexts....though I also think what is central here is that there is a
   need to be challenged intellectually as well...It is not a mere question of
   "new" and "old" or "margin writing" but of a desire to learn as well as
    teach and to actually not be one of those who, burdened by professionalism
    or scarred by academia, can not be fueled or excited by their involvement
    with it. As if one can play a role one hates in hopes it will catch the
    ear without killing it...and only then FEEL COMFORTABLE ENOUGH TO BE
    ITSELF (if it knows what it likes anymore---and no I'm not necessarily
    "privileging" "humanist essentialism" here)....For there is not only
    McPoetry but McAcademic Discourse it seems to me, and it wants to have
    the house surrounded, blaring Eddie Cochran's "get to the top I'm too
    tired to rock," of which this impatience of mine to "correct" myself
    in public is no doubt part (but smile). Chris

Subject:      New Lally Reprint

Since the publisher's not on line, I hope you all won't mind my plugging
this new reprint of:

     CATCH MY BREATH, Fiction/Poetry/Autobiography from 1960 -1974
     by MICHAEL LALLY
     Salt Lick Press; 86 pages; perfectbound; $13.00
     Order direct from Salt Lick Press (add $2.00 shipping)
     2107 NE Multnomah Street * Portland, OR 97232-2119 * U.S.A.
     (502) 288-6952

     Originally published in 1978, the first edition of this selection of
Lally's early writing went out of print in three months, and has remained
o.p. until this 1995 reprint. Lally is the author of two dozen books, and
edited the anthology _None of the Above_ in 1976, which included work by
Bruce Andrews, Alice Notley & Ron Silliman, among others. He may or may
not have been the editor of O Press (my copy of Blaise Cendrars' _At the
Heart of the World_ ((GROOVE FACTOR: 7)), trans. by Annabel Levitt &
published by O Press in 1978, lists its address as "c/o Michael Lally").
(Anyone who knows who *did* edit O Press -- not to be confused with
Leslie's O Books -- let me know.) (BTW: Rae, is that Harryman O Books book
new? Can you tell us more about it?)

     BLURB-TYPE MATTER: "Lally's 'autobiographical' work is not
confessional -- no catharsis, either on his part or the reader's is called
for. Less obvious is the structural function of Lally's continual
insistence on anchoring himself (chronologically, geographically,
politically, sexually): being up-front about his perspective and his
prejudices. ... Lally, the narrator, does not transcribe 'raw material'
but formally organizes a written story as if it were a spoken one -- with
all the personal digressions and asides this implies. ... Lally aims for
separation, judgment, the division of reader's intelligence from his own,
the active direction of it to his work. It is what his 'anchoring' is all
about: here I am, there you are, we are not the same ..." -- Jane DeLynn,
from the Afterword.

     EXCERPT (from "Empty Closets"):

     No more annexing the gris-gris. Me they generally call
     THE SHELF. They call him DRY the way your balls feel
     when you been put away AGAIN. She forgives the future
     when we take out each others eyes
     to fill in the blanks. Blue gorges.

     "Way uptown on a hundred, hanging from my action back, you're
     supposed to watch tv."

     Once a year the sharks would come to
     singular execution of snow fields,
     o, in piles behind the early fifties.
     On top of that we move around,
     gored silver following ourselves. Getting fucked.

     Now, obviously, if you could get the *original* edition of this book,
that would be *way* groovy. The reprint isn't what I'd call "groovy," but
is a wonderful book nontheless.
     Kevin, thank you so much for that thoroughly flattering groove
assessment, but the research I've done puts me (a mere "groovetaster")
way, way below a Lifetime Achievement Groovemaster like Lally. Did you see
him last week on "NYPD Blue"? Most poets, you give them a bit part in some
TV cop show, they fuck it up. (I think history has proven *that* much.)
When Marta & I watched Lally's "NYPD Blue" performance, we had stacked up
all of his books on the floor, "just in case" he started to get
"embarassing," in which case we'd've been forced to read one of his poems
over the realer-than-life TV dialog. That never happened. He's not only a
wonderful poet, but a stunning TV-cop-show-bit-part-actor, to boot.  What
am I saying? GROOVE FACTOR: 50.
     Yours,
     Gary

Forget  the  politicians' handshakes, PIG PRESS has just published two
of the most exciting of the younger Irish poets:

CATHERINE WALSH : PITCH

"The  writer  might  be  a  stone  cast  into cast into life recording
narrative ripples and disturbed reflections of  a  zoetrope  memory...
PITCH  is  worth reading, not least to watch thought select which part
of itself to display in language." Tom Raworth

48pp / Five Pounds Ninetyfive / Twelve Dollars Ninety

MAURICE SCULLY : THE BASIC COLOURS

Writing  with  what one critic has called a "lightfooted rage", Scully
chronicles the language shifts of wanderings in  Dublin,  Lesotho  and
Ennis.  Peter  Quartermain  writes: "Who but the pained alert could be
nightwatchman in these ruins of the future where we dwell?"

Also new:
ROY FISHER : IT FOLLOWS THAT
20pp / Two Pounds Ninety / Six Dollars

Dear Gary,

   Carla's book, Memory Play, is recent but not brand-new. Copyright 1994.
It's a real play which has been performed several times. It's from Leslie
Scalapino's O books in Berkeley. I'm surprised you haven't heard of it.
Sometimes it seems books just fall into oblivion. As someone with a book just
out, I'm concerned about that.  Aren't we all?

A slightly more English list of what's balanced (sometimes toppling) from
an upturned and suprisingly robust cardboard box by the bed. I sometimes go
to bed in the afternoon so this isn't always night-time reading or
pre-sleep induction. Also just becasue they're there doesn't mean they'll
all get read soon. Some are started, some up for occasional visits and some
hot. The piles change over about a six weekly cycle.

Iain Sinclair  -  Radon Daughters
Roger Griffin  -  The Nature of Fascism
Kathy Acker  -  My Mother: demonology, a novel
Jon Rose  -  Violin Music in the age of SHOPPING
Eric Mottram  -  Double Your Stake
Tom Leonard  -  Reports from the Present
Homi Bhabha  -  The Location of Culture
William Burroughs  -  The Letters of 1945 to 1959
Bernadette Mayer  -  Midwinter Day
Allen Fisher  -  Breadboard
Alan Bullock  -  Hitler and Stalin, parallel lives
Art & Design Magazine  -  'Performance Art Into the 90s'
Macintosh Hypercard User's Guide

this list posting is obviously a trend disguising a stronger fascination
with who's reading what. It seems to be an intriguing way of finding out
what's just out and coming up? To echo Eric Pape's point about information
-  little comes this way. Almost only one bookshop stocks any recent U.S.
editions and those by only a handful of 'names'.
As a small publisher here I'm beginning to sort out swaps through this
list. Seems like one useful way forwards. I increasingly value the
inter-continental aspects of this list.
Ancillary question would be, who aprt from SPD might be worth approaching
for distribution Stateside of recent English Poets? Any ideas / interest?

Subject:      Re: poetry v the sharp mind

Having hung around academe for many years without managing to buckle down to
much "real" scholarship, I feel I have something to contribute to this thread.

(Any excuse not to work on the dissertation . . . )

Lisa Samuels well describes academic culture's supercilious attitude toward the
artist-as-academic.  Here at U-Buffalo things are supposed to be different: it
was a great place to be a writer-professor 10 or 20 yrs ago.  Nowadays, though,
the tide turns toward a button-down hyperprofessionalism that increasingly
regards poetry as perhaps an interesting object of analysis but not as a strong
way of thinking in its own right.  I don't see Creeley getting the respect he
deserves, for example; it would be most interesting to hear from CB (no, not
Clive Barnes) and Susan Howe on this topic.

Chris Stroffolino is right, too, to say that Foucauldianism (tho 'haps not
Foucault himself, precisely) contributes as much as anything else does to the
hostile atmosphere around here.  Its undeniably powerful critique seems to
delude some followers into regarding themselves as above reproach--as
revolutionarily pure (oddly, since the theory would tend to indicate
otherwise).  I call 'em the "without sin" crowd (and then I duck and cover
because they throw hard.)

But, though there are too many of those people about, they are not the main
causes of the problem under discussion.  I trace it to, not a misunderstanding,
but a misapplication of scientific method.  Science gets a great part of its
explanatory power from its insistence upon tackling nature one well-formed
question at a time.  Poetry doesn't and shouldn't work this way.  Art in
general (yes, there is such a thing) deals with knots of inseparable
questions.  Tease these all the way apart and you get much less than you start
with.  Academic disciplines could cope with this, but in the main they do not.
That is why academic disciplines understand a lot about nature in terms of
necessity, in terms of power--but they do not understand human freedom at all
well.

(One small tragedy in this mess is that gradstudents' worries about conforming
to theoretical fashion for the sake of marketability are probably misconceived.
Here, for instance, faculty often laments the fact that we don't have enough
young faculty in the supposedly hot new areas, and so gradstudes are deprived
of accreditation in the more marketable perspectives.  Trouble is, what's hot
changes too fast for us to effectively anticipate it. "Ohmygod we have nobody
in Queer Theory!"  Well, guess how many noteworthy publications there have been
"in" Queer Theory in the past few years: like Stein's Oakland, there's not much
of a there there either.)

An adage from the sixties: the only way out is through.  Let me suggest some
texts that might be useful as ways to fight back--to critique the academic
folkways that oppress us:

Charles Bernstein, "What's Art Got to Do With It . . ." , etc.

John Dewey, _Art as Experience_

Larry Hickman, _John Dewey's Pragmatic Technology_

Ronald deSouza, _The Rationality of Emotion_

Mark Johnson, _The Body in the Mind_ (for the basic idea, not the interminable
                                        Kant-quibbling)

Peter Sloterdijk, _Critique of Cynical Reason_

Bruno Latour, _We Have Never Been Modern_

Jacques Derrida, _Specters of Marx_

. . . many of whom, of copurse, contradict one another completerly . . .

(Sorry these are all boys. I wish I had a good explanation for that. I'd add
Donna Haraway to this list except I have some fundamental objections I'm still
trying to work through.  I doubt it's accidental that my favorite women writers
are all poets!)

the question is :

are there any bookstore's informally (if not officially) "on line"
(whether here on this list or in general?)

a friend at Powell's in Portland Ore. told me that they spent a million
dollars on the software to go "online" in order to do mail-order book
sales.

perhaps we should tell Steve Dickison at SPD to pick up the phone as it
were (perhaps he is here listening, even)

a million dollars.

then he said they spent 20,000 at one little bay area warehouse called
serendipity and that they were buying up whole bookstores in north amercia
only recently rejecting an offer to move into Prague...

so what, we little xroxers are supposed to submit that that ordering
structure to make it "easier"

suddenly I wonder if that's the point

George inquired about the availability of "The Tunnel". The beast has

front page NY Times Book Review article a few weeks ago. I cracked it for
the first time this weekend and it looks good--although it's weird to
think that the opening pages were written thirty years ago...

If anyone else has checked this monster out, I'd be interested in yr

I utterly concur with Rae Armantrout that Carla Harryman's Memory Play is
very good writing; a lot like Lorca, with reservations. It was a limited
edition, though, or so Carla told me when she sent me a copy. I'd love
to chat it over, if others have read it. Or with you, Rae, if you've time;
for example "memory" of what? Of genre, I think, and thus very interesting
as combatting expectations of readers of language writing, taking on the
reader...

Dear Jim,

RIFFLING THRU SLOTERDIJK BACKWARDS
    "Sapere aude!remains the motto
of an enlightenment that, even in the twilight
of the most recent dangers, resists
   intimidation by catastrophe.   Only out of its courage
can a future still unfold that would be more than the expanded

reproduction of the worst of the past.   Such courage
     nourishes itself from the now faint currents of
recollection of a spontaneous ability of life to be-in-order,
         an order not constructed by anybody....."   Sloterdijk,
Critique,p.546

"Art is the real Gay Science:  It stands, as the last guarantor of
     a sovereign and realistic consciousness, between religion and
        science."   Ibid. p.179

                                        "Politics is not only the art of the
possible, as has been siad, but
 just as muich the art of seduction.  It is the chocolate side of
    power that assumes first, that order must
      prevail and, second, that
the world wants to be deceived."   Ibid. p.147

Questions:    Do "education" and "culture"  go their present way because
the principle is in force, that only learning that leads to
immediate cash benefits is to be emcouraged?   Is that why
"poetry" (or any of the arts asking for funding by The State)
are likely to  get trashed at all levels?

Dear friends -

Normally I would try for a more graceful and natural English, but this
time I was trying to keep the structure and rhythm of the original,
as far as possible, as it reflects, in Spanish, the way Mayan
people would express their thoughts in their own languages.
If I knew any of the Mayan tongues I could have done a better job,
but since I haven't seen any Maya linguists volunteering, I went ahead.

Zapatista National Liberation Army               Mexico, March 12 1995

To the people of Mexico:

To the peoples of the world:

Brothers:

With old pain and new death, our heart speaks to you so that your hearts
listen.  Our pain was in being, hurting it was.  Becoming silent, our
voice was passing away.  Our voice had been of peace, but not of yesterday,
not of old peace that was death.  Of peace was our voice, of tomorrow's
peace. The fire had stayed behind, kept in the days gone by, the fire that
spoke for our race when all were deaf to death.  Another way our tears asked
for, still lost in the arroyos of the mountains. So spoke our dead.  The
oldest ones then counseled us to look where the sun walks, to ask other
brothers of the race, of blood and hope, where our hurt pain should walk, our
tired step. This we did, brothers.  The silence arrived to put out the fire
and there was no arrogance in the word of the true men and women for those
who, in other lands and other races, shared the pain and wishes for a
tomorrow.

We opened our heart, brothers. We learned to see and to listen to other,
different brothers. We listened to their word and saw in their heart.
And we saw in their step the same longing that put the fire in our hands,
that broke up our face until it was nothing but a gaze, that hid our
name and erased our past: the struggle to command, obeying; to leave free,
the free word and heart; to give and receive what is deserved.  The struggle
for democracy, freedom and justice.  No more, never less.

The word of these brothers, your word, asked us to try another path,
to leave pending and waiting the fire that armed the breast.  To talk, and
that through the words, would come the destination.  It was they, you, the
others. Like us, the always forgotten.  The always humiliated, like us.  The
brothers.  This we did.  Our voice spoke with the powerful lord.  Obeying,
we sent our word to the great house of money.  We spoke and we listened.
We were following that path when the treason, again, put arms above words.
Our voice was silenced all at once by the noise of the cars of war.  Terror
was unleashed again in the Mexican lands.  He who from arrogance and power
looks at us with contempt, denied our name and gave death as a response
to our thought.

It wasn't enough for him to deny us a face and life, he wanted to humble
our step of dignity, trample our just demands, take truth from our song,
sink our flag in oblivion.  With the complicity of the big monies and the
foreign vocation, he wanted to impose humiliating conditions on us, just to
speak. Turning backward the wheel of history, he wanted to force us, by the
power of his bayonets, to deny our history.  Our women suffered the
harassment and the humiliation of the machines of war.  Our children grew
with bitterness and impotence between their hands.  Some, the ones who didn't
die.  In the men hate sharpened the breast.  The greatest grandparents looked
again to the earth and asked counsel of the first dead.  They spoke.  The
dead of forever. We.  They said this: "Our hand did not rise armed to listen,
kneeling, to insults and humiliations. Our step did not rise so that he who
is double in his face and in his word could humiliate us, filling hope with
lies.

"For justice our hand was armed and our step raised.  And justice is only a
false promise that the powerful dresses himself with.

"For freedom our hand was armed and our step raised.  And freedom is sold
for a fistful of coins to the foreign skin.

"For democracy our hand was armed and our step raised.  And democracy is
still absent by the work of he who cynicism, crime and lies carried
into government.

"Everything, brothers, but dignity trampled again.

"Everything, brothers, but lies again on our table.

"Everything, brothers, but to forget once again tomorrow.

Thus they spoke.  This our dead said.  The war came.  Then again we saw the
brother come in other clothing.  He came to kill.  To die.  Our hand did not
want to again confront he who was sent to kill and to die among the same. For
that reason, our past ones went to the mountains; to the caves of those
before, we went.  Death cornered us and pursued lives that always passed away
obscurely, shades of death and of the shadow of a forgetful country.  Death
came to wield again its knife-edge of oblivion.  To kill memory it came.
Now our hand filled again with fire to avenge the pain of our own, animals
again eating earth, dying persecuted and forgotten.

Now the drums called to war again.  Now the bat men and women prepared again
their flight of mortal death.  Now the night of pain came again to cover the
vengeance of the true men and women.

But there came, from where the sun walks, another voice that was not of
death.  It came great, with the wind it came.  Our hurting heart waited
and heard what that voice spoke.  That the war not go on, it said. That
death wait.  That the heart of the true men and women not be, yet, a mirror
of pain.  This we did.  The bitterness was put away in the caves and our
pain waited for that voice to shout.  The voice spoke strongly.  How could
we not hear it!  Many steps was that voice.  Great, the song of its drums.
Only the arrogant closed his heart.  Without fire, with a name and face, that
voice raised again the banner of human dignity.  For that voice, we were not
animals.  Men and women again, we were.  From other lands came walking
that voice.  From far away.  From the heart of other lands, from other
mountains, from other hopes, sisters to ours.  It became strong and great.
It is a voice.  Relief came to our pain, and the waiting harvested hope.  A
seed, was that voice, in the collective heart that walks in our step.

Brothers:  A name, that voice gives us.  No more are we the unmentionables.

A name have we, the forgotten.  Now our flag can cover, not hiding itself,
our dead and our history.  We have now a place in the heart of our brothers,
- you - and a small corner in the history that really counts: that of the
struggle.  Having now a collective name, we discovered that death shrinks,
and ends up small on us.  The worst death, that of oblivion, flees so
that the memory of our dead will never be buried together with their bones.
We have now a collective name and our pain has shelter.  Now we are larger
than death.

We have also the hope that just as we received a name, these brothers,
- you - will give us tomorrow a face; finish by putting out the fire that
lives in our hands; and, instead of the past, give us a future.

They smile, these lives of tomorrow and dead of forever.  They dream,
the bones of the men of wood in the mountains.  They dance, the men and
women of corn.  Joyful is our heart, although the body hurts.  A light lights
up these shadows that always dance with death, the true men and women, those
of forever.

We are named.

Now we will not die.

Come, brothers, we cannot go.  Great is the the strength of you all if you
make yourselves one.  Come, there will be no fire to receive your step, nor
will our heart be closed to your word.  Come.

A name we have.  Now we will not die.  Let us dance.

Now we shall not die.  Named are we.

Health, brothers!  Death to Death!  Long live the EZLN!

Democracy!

Freedom!

Justice!

Subject:      Letter from Alan Loney (preface)

I invariably, or at least variably, call O Books (Leslie Scalapino's
press) O Press (Michael Lally's lively press of the 70s).  I think
O! Press, but Leslie notes "oppress".

In an separate post, to follow immediately, I am sending a longish
letter to the editor by Alan Loney, a terrific poet from New Zealand.
I thought the letter might be of interest "here" even in the
absence of the review to which it responds.  Alan Loney has been
a subscriber to the Poetics List, but has recently signed off.  He is the
author of two recommended books:

Missing Parts: Poems 1977-1990 (Christchurch, NZ: Hazard Press, 1992)

and

The Erasure Tapes (Auckland University Press, 1994), which Loney
describes in the Preface as "an autobiography in which I refuse to tell
the story of my life."

I am not sure how people outside New Zealand can get these books,
or the (also highly recommended!) book by Michelle Leggott, _DIA_
(egad! another poet-scholar, the self-same author of the awesome study
of Zukofsky's 80 Flowers from Johns Hopkins a few years back
(_Reading 80 Flowers_).  But I think that Wystan Curnow and Tony Green,
who should be reading this message "now", might be able to help out?

Subject:      Letter to the Editor (longish): The Panic of Jane Stafford

Alan Loney

The Panic of Jane Stafford

Re: "The panic of O", Jane Stafford, New Zealand Books, Vol 4 No 3, September
1994.

For the past 25 to 30 years some of "us", i.e. writers who have generally been
considered to  be working somewhere on the margins of New Zealand literature,
have been on the  receiving end of a number of, shall I say, negative
adjectives attached to our work and the  work of others that we respect, by
"mainstream" authors and critics in book reviews. It is  an  impressive list,
and maybe it would be best to start by exhibiting it, in all its glory, just so
that we know clearly what is being discussed. Here are some of the more
frequently  applied: solipsistic, elitist, pretentious, obscure, empty,
cognoscenti, private reference, no  discernible  thought, resistance to
interpretation, provocative, smart-arse, clever, wilful,  self-indulgent,
contempt for the reader, ivory tower, writing for a coterie, intellectual,
pseudo-intellectual,  so-called postmodern, so-called "Language Poets",
excluding the average reader, void of  meaning, inaccessible,  etc etc etc.
Jane Stafford's review of Murray Edmond's The Switch  and Michele Leggott's Dia
, both recently published by Auckland University Press, contains  the first
fifteen of these. They are now, after all these years, nothing more nor less
than a set  of cliched insults, and their purpose is invariably to provide
excuses for refusing to actually  engage with the work being so characterised.

Jane Stafford's review of the Edmond and Leggott texts is argued, detailed, and
attempts to  get beyond the mere name-calling exercise that I have nevertheless
stated that it includes.  It  is therefore to be welcomed as providing a
genuine opportunity for reply in ways that the  mere name-calling  procedure
does not. But these negative terms are so repeated and  familiar in New Zealand
poetry reviewing that it seems less a matter of deja vu, than of a  kind of
ventriloquism - where the dummy keeps on producing its lines long after the
operator has vacated the premises.

Credentials and allegiances

Ms Stafford is at pains to establish a kind of credibility for herself, one
that is based on  credentials  - "I teach a second year university course etc".
Ordinarily, such candour is to be  welcomed. But one can easily compile other
paragraphs, one of which might begin :  "Murray Edmond is a lecturer in Drama
at the University of Auckland, is convenor of the   post-graduate Diploma in
Drama programme, and lectures in a stage 3 American  poetry  course. He is the
author of 6 books of poetry (several of them out of print) and so on".  Another
such paragraph might start with :"Michele Leggott is a lecturer at the
University  of  Auckland in New Zealand poetry, in American poetry, in
Australasian Women's  Literature, with a PhD from University of British
Columbia at Vancouver. She has  published 3 books of poetry (the first is out
of print), and her major study "Reading  Zukosfky's 80 Flowers " was published
by Johns Hopkins University Press on the  recommendation of Hugh Kenner etc
etc".  It's not my purpose to pit credentials against  each other here (that
would at the least be silly), but to make the more important point that  we all
have credentials of one sort or another. In a field like "literature" such
credentials do  not automatically confer guarantees of appropriate information,
approach, or judgement.  We are all contestable when discussions about values
are taking place.

Whatever else one thinks of the work of Michele Leggott, Murray Edmond, and,
let's be  clear, Alan Loney and any others with whom we are perceived to have
some sort of  allegiance, what one cannot say is that they all write in the
same way or that the works of  each are easily able to be confused with each
other's - by any attentive reading. And yet the  'critical' reception of them
by most 'mainstream' authors and reviewers is so familiarly  uniform that,
instead of getting genuine differential readings of these authors in reviews,
we're getting the homogeneous operation of an agenda, a false ideology which
specifies  these authors as a 'them' which can therefore, according to the
normal functioning of 'us  and them' patterns, be blithely treated by the same
unexamined, unsupported and  negative  terms and gestures.

What that agenda is I don't much care. What I do care about is the pretence
that genuine  critical reading is taking place; the pretence  that those
critics have some sort of 'ownership'  of the scope, purpose and condition of
poetry in New Zealand; and the presumptive  judgment that their reviled authors
are not serious about their life's work as poets or  writers; that they lack
integrity and competence of almost any kind whatever; that they  have no
respect for the work and works of others  who work outside their own writerly
project (my  respect for John Keats and for Mary Ursula Bethell for instance
would not even  be conceded as possible); and that they have no other apparent
motive for writing  but to  demonstrate to a small group of people who are
equally despicable that they are cleverer  than anybody else. These
assumptions, running throughout Ms Stafford's review, and  through hundreds of
reviews of poetry in this country in the last 25 to 30 years, are as cheap  and
unwarranted as anything she or anyone else directs at such writers as Murray
Edmond  and Michele Leggott.


A personal disposition or two

Ms Stafford's review begins in a mode of reasonableness and with a proper
pedagogical  concern for students of literature who are having to learn to
engage with unfamiliar texts.  It  reads like the kind of introduction that
might prepare one for the reviewer's own  engagement with the work of the
authors under discussion. Alas, it does not. What it leads  to, almost
inexplicably ('almost' as, one tends to expect this sort of response by now),
is this:  "Which is why I feel angry...". Anger? Why? What business has a
professional academic to  be 'angry' about texts to be discussed? Are they
advocating the pleasures of child abuse? Are  they suggesting people would feel
better if they beat the hell out of someone rather than  having all that pent
up feeling floating around? Do they propose ethnic cleansing in their  suburb?
Wherefore anger?  Ms Stafford establishes credentials, I would have thought,
for  being able  to discuss these works. What she actually says is: "I'm trying
to make a  connection with it. I can't." So. The reviewer's credentials, i.e.
her education, her  qualifications, her personal predilections, her teachers,
her colleagues, her peers, and her  reading, have not at all prepared her for
the works under review. One could very well be  angry about that. Instead of
acknowledging her situation however she has chosen to pour  scorn on the poets,
as if somehow they are to blame for it.

To take this point a bit further, there are other, telling, phrases that
support my concern.   Ms Stafford sees "a more sinister possibility"; "no
discernible thought here"; "so old- fashioned"; "smart-arse elitism"; "got a
nasty feeling"; "I'm damned if I'm going to"; "I  have this nasty feeling"; "I
find these two collections depressing" and so on. Why, exactly, is  all this
nastiness and bad feeling supposed to function as a proper basis for, or
condition of,  the elucidation of contemporary poetry for what Ms Stafford
deigns to call "the less  enlightened reader"?  We are not told. It is assumed
that the reviewer has these bad  feelings  in good faith. Ms Stafford has given
no one any reason to buy such a proposition.


The ventriloquist's dummy

Does this sub-title merely trade one harshness for another? Perhaps. But it
points to a view  of things, an agenda, a false and unquestioning ideology.
This ideology asserts itself by  using  a body of cliches, shibboleths even, in
order to obscure the meanings of others, and to deny  their actual differences.
Before I elaborate on this specifically, I want to expose a few  carelessnesses
and contradictions in Ms Stafford's text.

Keats's poem is "Ode to a Nightingale", not "Ode to the Nightingale"; Sterne's
book is  "Tristram Shandy", not "Tristan Shandy"; and "Morgenstern" refers
directly to the work of  Christian Morgenstern, and his wordless piece "Fisches
Nachtgesang" (1905) (and no, I did  not have to ask the poet for the
reference). It is, additionally, usual for assistance from  others - "A kind
and more literate friend" - to be identified in academic writings. And  rather
than ask how much less literate is implied by that "more", I would rather know
who  is doing the talking here? Or,  to put it another way, who's the
ventriloquist in this  instance?

A not uncommon kind of contradiction that appears in negative reviews is
exhibited in  Ms  Stafford's aside (to whom, exactly?) "a little Saussurian
reference for the cognoscenti?". It's  hard to take seriously the notion that
such a statement is directed to "the less enlightened  reader". If it is, how
do they, outside of, say, an academic environment, understand "Saussurian"?
This aside is also, I'm afraid, directed at a "cognoscenti", and a clear
distinction is therefore implied, like it or not, between the author's
'cognoscenti' and the  poet's 'cognoscenti' - ours and theirs, us and them. But
if she is, say, talking to me (and,  after all, I too am a 'reader'), then I
would say that she is not at all up with the play, either  with Saussure (who
dealt with spoken, not written language), or with Heidegger (who said  "It is
in language that things first come into being and are" (Introduction to
Metaphysics),  or  with Charles Olson's reliance on the work of Jane Ellen
Harrison for his assertion that  myth (the stories that cultures, oral and
literate, tell themselves about themselves) comes  first from the mouth. I
introduce these other writers here, not to show off my naturally  immense
erudition, but to signal that we all have such reading lists behind and
operative  within what we say. For all of us they are different of course, but
we all have these alliances,  allegiances  and engagements to one degree or
another. They are not the same kind of thing  as 'credentials'. If our 'reading
lists' are too different, and I am suggesting that this is likely  to be the
case as between Ms Stafford and the poets she reviews, then little wonder that
the  reviewer finds it hard to connect with the work.

However, it is the outright refusals that I find the most interesting aspect of
Ms Stafford's  review. First, the refusal to be (indeed the specific injunction
not to be) literal - "Don't be  literal".  If the literal is the first thing to
be denied of unfamiliar writing, then it's   understandable that a reader might
find a grasp of its metaphorical content hard to come  by.   If, as Ms Stafford
maintains, "a metaphor should expand meaning" (tho I don't accept this
formulation myself) then it's possible that the literal is one of the places
from which  metaphor can "expand".  It is, in any case, a perfectly reasonable
place to begin. That it  should be precluded, requires more explanation than a
list of other options, especially  when, for instance, my own teaching
experience suggests that it is wise counsel to keep the  options open until
they falter - in any given instance.

A further type of refusal is performed in the review when, in discussing
Leggott, the  reviewer writes that a particular passage "would be fine if I
knew what the last two words  meant". Those two words are "HYDROPHILE PURLING".
It is not I think too churlish to  propose the use of a dictionary in such a
circumstance. 'Hydrophile' is derived from  'hydrophilic', a chemical term
meaning 'having a strong affinity for water'. 'Purling' has,  as one of its
meanings (and the others are pertinent to the poem) 'flowing with a curling or
rippling motion, as a shallow stream over stones'. According to Ms Stafford,
she should  now be in a position to regard the poet's line as "fine". But by
refusing to even admit  meanings that are accessible to her, she has paved the
way for yet another insult to be  attached to the work, yet another opportunity
for the ventriloquist's dummy to steal the  show.

Another line of refusal is the refusal to give the poet the benefit of the
reviewer's own  insight as exhibited in the review itself. It is this
extraordinary strategy that  clinches my  claims about ventriloquism. Two
examples will do. In considering Edmond's poems 43  and  44, Ms Stafford
interrogates (properly) the text for meaning. Among her initial notes are
language play, sexual content, parallels with other texts in the book, the
presence in  English  of a large number of homographs - all good places to
start in establishing a field of  meanings for the poems. But just when this
beginning is noted she cuts off the flow of  elucidatory reading by saying "And
it gets worse". Worse?  How does a series of valid  insights (tho preliminary
ones, to be sure) add up automatically to a bad thing? In  considering Leggott,
the reviewer states that Elizabeth Barrett Browning is "an obvious  figure" in
the poem Dia,  yet notes that the reference to "the Portuguese/wind" etc "may
be  an allusion", and asks us to note her (Stafford's) "tentativeness" in
making the suggestion.  Well, what I've already noted is the strength of the
phrase "an obvious figure".

The most blatant refusal however is the reviewer's refusal to even consider the
poem  "Micromelismata". 'Concrete' poetry is historically a particular moment,
largely in  Europe,  but extending to Britain and the United States also,
within a wider context of shaped  poetry,  going back to the work of George
Herbert (died 1633) in England. Herbert himself knew of at  least one
predecessor for his work, an edition of The Greek Anthology, Theocriti Idyllia,
printed by P. Brubacchius, Frankfurt, 1545. To insist that it is legitimate to
reduce this  tradition to a mere fashion of c.1972, to which no critic need
return in order to speak of  newer writing is, I am sorry to say, no more than
an excuse for one's own ignorance, and  an  attempt to blame the poet for the
critic's failure of nerve in the face of the material reality of  the text. One
is of course under no obligation to like or admire any given text,  but one
does,  in public, have to deal with it in an open engagement.

What I am bothered about in these refusals is that just at that point when a
genuine critical  reading looks about to be achieved, Ms Stafford throws in the
towel. Again, an opportunity  to assist the "unenlightened reader" to deal with
a strange looking text is waved away in  favour of the agenda that requires
that these poets must be belittled and insulted rather  than read critically.
And of course the problem with reading attentively, generously and  critically
is that there is the severe danger of having to change one's opinion as the
result of  reaching genuine findings.



The news about elitism

As a lecturer in English at a university, Ms Stafford is a member of a small
band of elite,  specialist readers of literature. As an academic, she can claim
uncommon status as an  expert, and as a professional worker in the field of
literary criticism. The number of people  who get paid a salary in New Zealand
for teaching literature at tertiary level is, in relation  to the population at
large, very small. Now, books of poems in New Zealand are typically  published
in editions of between 500 and 1000 copies, and are very rarely (except in the
case  of anthologies used for teaching purposes) ever reprinted. There are some
exceptions  above  and below these figures, but 500 to 1000 copies is the
typical range. There are, at least, 1.5  million literate adults in New
Zealand. A thousand copies (let's be kind to the argument)  as  a percentage of
1.5million, is 0.066% of the literate adult population. Anyone who thinks  this
constitutes the democratization of poetry in relation to the literate
population at large  has, in my view, a lot of explaining to do. If that
percentage was closer to 66% for so-called  "mainstream" poets and 0.066% for
the likes of Edmond and Leggott, I'd have to admit  there was a point to be
made along these lines. But, it isn't, and there isn't. What it means  is that
poetry is an elitist proposition per se, at any level at which anyone reads any
of it. It also means that 'the general reader' or 'the general public' is not
the target group for any  publisher of poetry in New Zealand. Those of us who
are involved with poetry in any way  are all splashing about in the elitist pot
together.


The subjectivity at the end of the world

The last comment made by Ms Stafford denies that 'subjectivity' is an
interesting issue.  What I have attempted to show here is that it is primarily
the poets' 'subjectivity' that has  been on trial throughout her review. The
list of insults given in my first paragraph says it  as well as anything I can
end with. They are nearly all solely applicable to people, rather  than to
texts. If poetry needs anything at all from critics these days, it is close
reading, clear  and attentive critical analysis. One of the characteristics of,
as they say, 'our time', is that  there are many more and various backgrounds -
cultural, geographic, intellectual, and  personal and so on - than can be
neatly fitted or reduced to some monolithic sense of  "mainstream", to which we
are all supposed to conform. This does not mean, in my view,  that anything
goes. What it does mean is that a greater degree of care, of openness, and of
courtesy needs to be operating in the field of public letters, if we are not to
simply sit back  on  'us & them' perches and merely hurl insults at one another
under the privilege of having  access to print.

Ed, it's not the "humble mumble" that wears on me, rather all the
"unhumble mumble." But Gary is hoovey groovey, and probably does the
hokey  cokey pokey, perhaps even with his whole self.

I'm not certain who the editor of O Press was in 1978. But it's
interesting that the translator of the book in question, Gary, was
Annabel Levitt. Annabel had a press, I believe, in the late 70's/early
80's. I think it was at the 1982 NY Small Press Book Fair that I met her.  I
never knew her well, but I remember she was making some exceptional
books. I don't remember if her press was O Press, but I'll try to find out.

An interesting discussion all around, which i'll save and print out for some of
my first-year grad students in culture shock.  when u mentioned science i was
reminded that, in the strong and large research institutions, which tend to be
the prestigious schools where educational paradigms are hegemonically formed,
the humanities are always subordinated to the sciences, which are the
moneymakers.  thus humanists feel  under constant pressure to prove that we,
too, do "research" etc -- a constant legitimation crisis.  among the humanities,
the creative and expressive arts are embarrassing evidence of multiple modes of
inquiry and apprehension that threaten the hegemonic mode of the production of
knowledge --so they have to be repudiated, or, at best, tolerated with a kind of
arm's-length condescension by their more analytic discourse-cousins.  this is,
of course, a simplistic overview.  i don't think foucauldianism has anything to
do with this --if it weren't foucault's name that were being invoked in the name
of some discursive orthodoxy, it wd be someone else's.  i myself actually had a
rather pleasant graduate experience, in a program that was initially set up to
bridge that constructed gap --but then, i keep my "poetic" enterprises pretty
private.--maria d

This is a discussion that will not go away (various manifestations of which
has show up at least three times since I joined the list in Dec.) Some notes
towards thoughts about the ethics of poets remaining in the academy:
     First: both sides depend on a rather simple opposition of real work,
vs. work that is unimportant. In that the classroom emphasizes critical
work and talks of "creative" work as something resembling a hobby, or play.
Depends on the assumption that real work is productive of wages, your
critical work pays your bills, thus its your real work.
     The workshop (an academic sub-genre we can no longer forget) emphasizes
"creative" work as real work in a sort of romantic cult of the genius manner:
critical work pays the bills, but creative work releases the inner genius of
the poet and allows for real change and is thus real work.
     At this point, Tony's point about the somewhat specious seperation of
creative and critical needs to be made. Certainly this seperation was/is
historical?
     Maybe you've encountered this as well: in the workshop (whether
officially sanctioned by the academy and made a class, or whether a group
of folks who meet at the local coffee shop, or some mixture ofthe two, like
this list) offers the only real resistance to the various discourses called
theory I've experienced. One must not taint the sanctified ground of the
workshop with theory. Also, though, the rather typical CW student may find
him/herself somewhat patronized in the classroom as rather cute but not all
that important, as has been noticed previously.
     It occurs to me that the strict separation of theory with poetry may
have come about as poetry moved into the academy and was the result of
academic positioning? Perhaps a little off chronologically.
     Why stay in the academy? The answer has to be in my mind economic and
political. In here, you have the possiblity, however faint, of helping
students jump classes, as I did. Get them out of the ghetto/ tenant farm.
Has been so, I think, since the GI bill. Also to allow them participatein the
formation of the, for lack of a better term, canon, the standards of knowledge,
thus the multi-culti wars. This seems to me very positive, but as economic
conditions change, and pell grants and such fall away to pay for patriot
missiles, all over again, this justification may well go the way of
the trade union. What then do we do then, all of us academics?
     Thanks, Eric.

X-To:         Rae Armantrout <RaeA100900@aol.com>

Hi Rae,

You aren't alone. I completley agree with you about Memory Play and am
planning to publish some of it, and other work by Carla upcoming, this side
of the pond. In that performance series I recently posted a Call for
submissions to.

It's a terrific work. Have you seen a performance? I saw a video of There's
Nothing Better Than A Theory (back on that discussion again) when visiting
Carla and Barrett four years back, so I've got some points of reference for
spaciality, movement, scenography. Can you describe it, aspects of the
performed version ? Energies, interfusional textures ? Voices ?
I've got an interest in producing a version here with Carla in the next
couple of years. We're talking here about how to make it possible. Be very
interested in your response.

best
cris

Subject:      Re: Letter to the Editor (longish): The Panic of Jane Stafford

I have just re-read Alan Loney's long and fascinating letter and would
like to respond to it a little.
        My own perspective on New Zealand writing, different from Tony
Green or Wystan Curnow's, is as an ex-resident of Wellington, at the
other end of the North Island from Auckland, where Tony and Wystan are,
and where the best NZ collection of Language Writing and other post-war
American poetry is, where the American avant-gardists tend to be
invited and welcomed. I lived in Wellington for 2 years, and indeed
taught on the same 2nd year poetry course as Jane Stafford, who in my
recollection was one of the best and warmest of the twenty or so staff
at Victoria University there. It's true that, like a lot of people I've
met all over the university world, she doesn't understand or like much
avant-garde work; but she does teach a lot of very good but formally
conservative poets very well, and quite gratefully took on some of the
twenty or so poets I tried to introduce to the course, and to my
knowledge is still teaching them, poets like Louise Bogan and Carol
Ann Duffy. Given that, as Alan suggest, few people seem to read poetry,
and a lot are put off in school, I myself used Bogan and Duffy to meet
and then stretch my students' expectations, as part of a long slow
process of warming them to all the things Alan and I both love about
currently marginalised work. Jane may well not do this with her teaching,
but she at least has Bogan and Duffy in her handouts, and that might
inspire some students.
        What I want to say about Alan's post is that it seems to me
that no-one who isn't already a paid lit worker or academic gives a
damn about reviews, and they only care about teachers' opinions in so
far as the teacher cares about knowing where they're at - which, in
the larger context of the dumbing of people by school & state &
church, seems fair to me. Students *fear* teachers for their grades,
and care about their opinions usually only for that reason, and
therefore with an underlying short attention span (the length of
the course-unit) and underlying contempt. I get as angry as Alan does
about these reviews, but I don't think they matter very much.
        I have to say that one reason poetry goes unread, in what
seems even more shocking proportions even than England or parts of
the States, is that *all* the NZ scene is corrupt, not just the
mainstream. I like to think I'm a good acquaintance of Michele
Leggott, and I'd be the first to praise her efforts in getting 80
Flowers into print again - by writing the book about it, and by very
brilliant diplomatic work with Paul Zukofsky. And the book itself is
full of great reference-tracking and research. But I feel less impressed
by the writing on the poetics, and by the bulk of her poetry that I've
read. The Auckland American Poetry course that friends of mine took
is in just as much danger as any Wellington course, or any other course,
of telling you to agree and preaching self-evident quality or cool
in its own favoured writers. And the effect may mean that some writers
I admire more with the Aucklanders than with my Wellington colleagues
get onto bookshelves, yet alas they remain unread or read badly, just
as most of the Plath and Heaney required on Wellington courses does.
These unviersity courses all fail, in my opinion, to nurture the love
of *whatever poetry each reader could learn from and progress with*.
The ideal would be that teachers give skills in finding poetry and
trusting your own reactions to it (I myself *hated* a lot of writers
I liked later, that doesn't make me a bad person, as they say). What
usually happens is you wind up with a book of poems you've had a class
about, and you can repeat what the teacher said about it, but couldn't
put forward your own opinion, nor could you engage with another poetry
student who has a different favourite book, each opening each to each.
I'd like to see more emphasis on finding work you love, among students,
and *students* learning by teaching each other; instead of *teachers*
finding work they love and teaching it to thirty students at once,
with very little reciprocation of student teaching teacher. The rare
university teacher, or person, is the one you can come to with your
own project, wanting not expertise but an open mind and encouragement.
The sad thing about this for me, who's never met Alan though loves his
art-letterpress limited editions, is both Jane and he are better than
most people I've met at engaging personibly with students, with the
ideosyncractic mind; and this disagreement masks a potential alliance
between people who are both really good *teachers* - in a way that
is much more important, for me, to the future of poetry than badly
written "house-style" reviewing.
        (I also think every interesting New Zealand poetry person I
met or heard about is short-sightedly dismissive about all the British
poetry, avant-garde included, that I ever tried to mention..., but
that's another story)

Dear Charles,
         Posts re- Alan Loney's books will be forwarded.   Add to his
bibliography:

1         dear Mondrian. (with drawings by Robin Neate).  published by
Alan's hand-set press:  Hawks Press, Taylors Mistake, 1976, a classic
now o.p.

2         Shorter Poems 1963-77. Auckland University Press/Oxford
University Press, 1979.  O.P.??

3         Missing Parts poems 1977-1990  Hazard Press 1992

He also made some small edition publications with elaborate colour block
printing.  Squeezing the Bones (of which I don't have the biblio
details) and  Swell which I have here published under his imprint
Black Light 1987.  His fine printed books can be found in major
collections, e.g. the Bodlean Library, Oxford.   & Buffalo, I guess?

Add to that an essay   & The Ampersand  Black Light Press 1990  (the
poet Denis Glover once dubbed him Ampersand Alan, because of his
regular use of the ampersand in print)

His hand-set edition of Robert Creeley's "Hello" (the New Zealand section
only) is a particular fetish of mine.  It goes back to Creeley's
first visit to New Zealand of 1976 (200 years after Cpt. Cook), which
was momentous for many here.

"     First: both sides depend on a rather simple
 opposition of real work, vs. work that is unimportant.
In that the classroom emphasizes critical work and talks
 of "creative" work as something resembling a hobby, or play.
Depends on the assumption that real work is productive of
 wages, your critical work pays your bills, thus its your real work.  "

Dear Eric,
         Your drift is interesting.  The problem I start from is not
"Creative Writing", but academic arts practice in Art History.  The
opposition you cite (useful and useless work) hits this practice, by
fastening it to pseudo-scientific projects and to pseudo-scientific
expository discourse, to make it "useful", i.e. Academically Approved
for Publication in Refereed Journals.  This tends to exclude (I'm
simplifying like crazy all the way today) narrative structures and
close-response writings, or even speculative commentary and
ecphrasis, all of which are included in classroom and privaste study
work with any artwork.

         But the opposition you cite is also precisely the one most
at issue in attempts to silence academic and intellectual
institutions under the guise of bottom-line economic measures.
Last Saturday's New Zealand Herald (18 March)had a full page story on
current attempts to destroy the independence of the Auckland
Institute and Museum, a major resource for anthropology, geology,
life-sciences etc in the Pacific region.  The politics ultimately
goes back to your opposition: if it don't earn a quick buck it is not
going to get money from the public purse.

           Carry the argument over into Information instead of
Tangible Product and you get very differnet answers to its use.

But worst of all, whenever an institution is forced into direct
control of local body politicians, it immediately loses its
independence of statement on social issues (in this case on
environment and  social issues, such as race relations).

Resistance in the classroom by any means available has to combat
some pretty deeply ingrained notions brought in by students, as
regards the uses of education and the discourse systems and the
direction and  control of intellectual efforts.

Dear Boys,

How do I rate this container? Sievey, real sievey. Or simply spent bait?

Maybe Red Rover would be a better model for editorial methodology than
musical chairs--if we persist with schoolyard tactics. But perhaps a close
reading of editorial practises would be a more pertinent issue than the
accusative sexing of results? At least that's my notion of how we might
come to understand the ways we reproduce power and its statistics.

X-To:         I.Lightman@UEA.AC.UK

Dear Ira,
         Thought I ought to respond some but first to follow through on
Charles' ask: Auckland University Press, University of Auckland, Private Bag
92019, Auckland, NZ is the publisher of Michele's, Alan's and also Murray
Edmond's book SWITCH which was the other work under review by Jane Stafford
and which I recommend to the list.
         Ira when you say *all* the NZ scene is corrupt, not just the
mainstream, and as though giving evidence you express reservations about
Michele's work, and suggest that our teaching here is as liable to fail as
teaching of poetry anywhere, I really don't follow. Even if the quotes were
supposed to be around *corrupt* rather than *all*--were they? The other
comment I can't really let go by was 'no one who isn't already a paid lit.
worker or academic gives a damn about reviews.' I can't agree. To begin with
the poets concerned, and all poets in my experience, *give a damn* and so
they should.
         Your comments are more about teaching, and you do mention  the
teaching we do do at Auckland. I just thought to say a couple of things
about it since you seem to suggest that your general comments about the
failures of poetry teaching can be readily applied to practices at Auckland.
The course which is liable to be mentioned is our 3rd year,full-year course
in contemporary American poetry which begins with the l950s. Of course, each
course constructs a canon, and it is the case the course has one which is
more or less the common ground of this list. However, its attention span is
longish (24 teaching weeks) and it is seldom one poet is taught more than a
week. Many poets are offerred, through lectures, through a course library
and reading room, tapes of all the poets and some videos, and students are
expected to develop enthusiasms, tastes of their own, through a
workbook-reading journal (although we're moving away from this toward a
portfolio idea at the moment). The course is team taught by three of us,
more or less alternating; each has a different approach, some students
responding more to one of us than the other two. We teach Wilbur, Lowell,
Sexton, Poet's Theatre (O'Hara-O'Harryman), Holzer, MacLow, Kerouac, in and
amongst the mix. But it is better not to talk about the one course because
the student chooses what the department more broadly offers and you'll
perhaps be reassured to know that Plath and Heaney are both taught here.
It is true Auckland's strength is in American rather than British poetry and
that was the case even when I was a student here. It is possible to study
20th American poetry at all levels and 8 members of the department do some
of their teaching in the field. It's not my impression that poetry readers
procuced by the department here are the victims my taste or anyone else.
But then I would say that. I'm *corrupt*.

            It would be good to have some Wellingtonians on the net.
When were you in the Windy City, Ira? There's too little contact between the
two cities, I have to say.
             Best
                 Wystan Curnow

Subject:      Re: Memory Play

Dear Cris Cheek,  I'll jump in & give my 2 cents worth on Memory Play, I am
an American actor who was trapped inside the darn thing for ten months in a
workshop production here in San Francisco, and I'll tell you, it took me
eight and a half months before I figured out what it was "about."
Harryman, the author, and Philip Horvitz, our director, were always mum
whenever any of us actors asked, two Cheshire cats sitting there creamily
on the sidelines, always replying only, "You decide."  So finally I did.
Hope you're familiar with the film "Mildred Pierce," because "Memory Play"
is "Mildred Pierce" with a happy or at any rate conciliatory ending.

However I may be wrong about this.  Years ago I wrote a review of
Harryman's book "Vice" and stated forthrightly my belief that "Vice" must
have been influenced by CH's constant viewing of the US cop show "Miami
Vice."  Two minutes later the phone was ringing and she denied it, saying
she had never watched MV in her life!  Consequently I know a little bit
about "Memory Play" but don't go by me.

I played the "Miltonic Humilator" and had a wonderful costume, designed by
John Woodall, a kind of Worth gown and a huge Merlin type hat.  I had to
sing and dance in several production numbers, and taunt all the other
characters; finally, defeated by my own love for the Pelican, I succumbed
to a kind of Madama Butterfly swoon and killed myself-off stage.  It was
great, and Cris, you can see it on video if you have the VHS format over
there.

All the other actors were good, and I was a bit abashed because CH and PH,
realizing that the Miltonic Humiliator doesn't really have very many lines
in the published script, and perhaps not wanting to waste my talents,
allowed me, no, ordered me, to make up my own lines.

I remember initially during our first workshop version of "Memory Play,"
that Kathy Acker was playing the part of the "Pelican,"-I suppose CH
couldn't secure Kathy for the ten months it took us to rehearse and present
the play.  But think of her saying those lines, her great, scabrous energy
melting the proscenium.

Thanks for letting me put in my two cents on "Memory Play."

So long now-

Kevin Killian

Thank you Ed for one of the best quotes, one of the best, most pertinent
statements I've heard since I first signed onto this List. Bronk's
statement applies to a lot more than the discussion at hand. The problem
isn't just teaching. The problem is how much people seek, crave and demand
every conceivable type of imposition.

1.0     Intro: Some Dynamics

How does an electronic resource differ from an electronic list?
Importantly, the information is there, but _YOU HAVE TO SEEK IT_. This
active participation on your part is an important aspect to the
workings of the Center. Enter the web, follow links, send comments.
Wouldn't it be more convenient to have material mailed to your e-mail
account? In some cases this is preferable, but given the large amount
of material at the Center, your account would soon overload. There is
also so much material here that few people could store it in their
accounts. It's available 24 hours a day, 365 days a week (except for
system "down" time), an electronic all-night literary bookstore? Also,
unlike material that may be sent to your account, EPC material is
loaded with *hyperlinks*, i.e., connections to other places, other
times, other texts. Aren't books preferable? In some cases, this is
true, however, the book is a _fixed object_, i.e., electronic
documents can changed, updated, move in time to what is actually
happening.

The EPC makes available a wide variety of material. The description of
Internet information provided by the _Internet Services Frequently
Asked Questions And Answers_ (Version 1.7 - 4 February, 1994) states:

>The type of information you're likely to find on the Internet is
>free information, such as government documents, works with expired
>copyrights, works that are in the public domain, and works that
>authors are making available to the Internet community on an
>experimental basis.  Conversely, some types of information you are
>not likely to find on the Internet, most notably, commercial works
>which are protected by copyright law.

The EPC is testament to the fact that Internet resources do not have
to be "throw-away" information. As a working site for _active_ poets,
the material here is a good faith exchange of original and current
texts (along with literary "classics") provided to you as part of the
current conversation that makes poetry and poetics immediate and
interactive. These texts, in many cases, are more current than
available through any other source. No one in the Center is waiving
any copyrights but has trusted you with these emerging texts in the
spirit of free exchange that defines the our efforts.
___________________________________________________________________

2.0     Projects: Author "Home Page" Project

One of the newest developments at the Electronic Poetry Center is the
development of the author library. The goal of this project is to
provide authors related to or of interest to the EPC with a "home
page," that is a single access point to electronic texts by and about
the author.

These author home pages offer access to electronic files by and about
the author, bibliographical information about the author, as well as,
where available, photographs and other "documentary" information about
the author.

We welcome inquiries from authors about allowing us to host your home
page. For authors who maintain their own home pages, do let us know so
that we might possibly provide a link to your own site.

6.0     FAQ: About the EPC

The Electronic Poetry Center seeks to provide a central _place_
for Internet resources for poetry and poetics.

The Center continues to provide access to the electronic poetry
and poetics journal, RIF/T, and the archives of the POETICS List.
Needless to say, the EPC provides quality archival materials for
these resources, including search features to allow keyword searching
of the Center.

The EPC AUTHOR library offers texts and/or information about
contemporary poets in a variety of formats.

A number of electronic JOURNALS are archived and distributed by the
EPC. Journals distributed through the EPC differ from other e-journal
archives in a significant way: the texts presented here have been
checked and verified by their issuing agency thus at least getting to
you versions of electronic journals in collaboration with their
source.

These journals include:

        DIU / Albany
        Experioddi(cyber)cist / Florence, AL
        Inter\face / Albany
        Passages: A Technopoetics Journal / Albany
        Poemata - Canadian Poetry Assoc. / London, Ontario (Info)/
        RIF/T: Electronic Space for New Poetry, Prose, & Poetics
        Segue Foundation/Roof Book News / New York
        TREE: TapRoot Electronic Edition / Lakewood, Ohio
        We Magazine / Santa Cruz
        Witz / Toluca Lake, CA / via Syntax

For RESOURCES outside the EPC, we have written links to make seamless
connections to these resources.

The Center also provides information about contemporary print little
magazines and SMALL PRESSES engaged in poetry and poetics. Look here
also for Selby's List of Experimental Magazines.

The Poetry & Poetics DOCUMENT Archive provides access to a number
of documents of use to poets, teachers, and researchers. Here you
will find essay material and recent obituaries.

The EPC also presently offers GALLERY, SOUND, EXHIBITS, and an
ANNOUNCEMENTS area.

Subject:      what does it do?

It occurs to me that it might be useful to frame more directly a question
that has been skirted by previous threads on the relations between
poetry and experiment, poetry and politics, poetry and theory etc.  Namely,
what does, or should, poetry do?  I wldn't want to skew discussion
irrevocably toward the classroom, but my students, it seems to me, bring
to their reading of poetry strong, but not particularly well-examined
assumptions on this count.  The dominant idea seems to be that poetry is
written "from the heart," with the purpose of expressing emotions.  Now,
i wldn't want to discount the importance of emotion, but, as i'm sure
we've all encountered, this sort of definition often results in the
writing/reading of a lot of "Hallmark verse," as well as in the
establishment of a sort of poetry-as-therapy paradigm.  So, if these
widespread views of what poetry does are inadeuate, are we up to
formulating more valuable meta-statements?  Is there any point in such
an attempt?

And how wld these meta-formulations be tied to the sorts of delightful
microdynamics on display in the recent close-reading thread?

As for the big question, i suppose my own preference tends toward the
Blakean notion of cleansing the doors of perception...

I'm interested in this recurring formula, the hallmark-card verse, invoked as
anathema to all serious modernist/postmodernist sensibilities.  when i ask
students to research "micro-poetries," i include greetingcard verse as an
example of a micro-poetry.  how can these despised, commercial fragments --or
the paradigm of poetry-as-therapy, as in psychiatric-ward workshops --be
understood in terms of the "cultural work" they perform?  rather than dismissing
them out of hand as trite and derivative, how can we use them to understand, as
shoemaker suggests, the multiple "purposes" of poetry.--maria d

Steven Shoemaker -- Of course, as Auden wrote on the death of Yeats,
"poetry makes nothing happen....".

A question to all engaged in the academia/non-academia discussion ... has
anyone else found the academic experience driving one away from words?  I
found in my first quarter of graduate school that I wrote about 10X the
words I had written in 10 years of adult life completely devoted to the
written word, and remember with horror the day I couldn't locate
something in a document using computerized word search because there was
no language being used unique enough -- in fact, it often seems the
academic task to bring our language into conformity, which to my mind
runs directly counter to the poetic task of always trying to use first
speech....  My own response has been to move into visual work... Anyone else?

Thanks for info, Ken.

I checked Books in Print, and they had an edition listed for 1992! I
guess it was pulled then. It was listing at something like $24 then.
Oh, I am looking forwards to this monster, nfd also for some time

Re Maria Damon's question about the cultural work of Hallmark cards -- I
learned what was to me a revelation about this a few years ago when I
came to understand that for some folks I met through doing martial arts
who are not verbally articulate in any way, hallmark cards -- and popular
songs on the radio -- are significant speech.  One fellow, in particular,
would get enormously upset if he felt that the new hit of each week
wasn't expressive of his own perspective, thoughts, and feelings -- like
they'd "gotten it wrong" ....  This fellow and others used the songs and
the cards to speak FOR them, felt intimately connected with them, etc.

The value of these forms of writing goes beyond, perhaps, poetry.
Grice, for example, used psychiatric-ward writings and taped dis-
cussions in his research.  This research yielded the expansion and
adaptation of Kantian maxims to discourse analysis (i.e. the
Cooperative Principles of "relevance", "cohesion", "manner", etc...).
His findings are very political insofar as they disclose another
relationship between power and language (i.e. rights of passage
into discursive communities).  As far as Hallmark goes?  Who knows?

in relation to this, there's a scene in the movie Chicks in White Satin, which I
didn't see but heard quite a bit about, and which is about the marriage of two
women, a "trite" greeting card becomes a focal point of emotion, and, said the
friend describing the scene to me, what would otherwise have been laughable
became quite transcendently moving and convincingly "authentic." what made the
card a conveyor of "authentic" feeling,i believe, was the women's reaction to it
--their feelings.  these are the kinds of saturated moments that compel my
attention.  so thanks for your comments above about your acquaintances who you
identify as not verbally oriented --can you say more about how their feelings of
identification, of being spoken for, were conveyed? if they were convincing to
you, what was it that convinced you?  the vehemence of your martial arts
colleagues' expression?  the astuteness of their analyses? --maria d

Steve's question about what poetry should do makes me think immediately of
reframing the question to something on the order of "How might poetry
surprise us?" or "What COULD any particular entity BECOME?"  I think that
precalling this would likely phase out (prior to conception) many
possibilities.

Of course, I understand that this question relates to levels of truth.  At a
certain level of consciousness (that of the students to whom Steve alluded),
we have to address from square one the expectations of people for whom much
of what we suspect ourselves of being fluent in is brand new.

Subject:      Coercive teaching

Dear
         Yesterday afternoon I said in a tutorial (Art History Stage
III): "I heard a discussion recently [in fact Ira Lightman's comments
about American Poetry as taught in Auckland] in which someone claimed that
every department teaching poetry made students agree with their
views, because otherwise they'd give them poor grades".  Three
students agreed that at St I and II they felt themselves subjected to
some pressure, though one said: "it depends on who you're tutor is" .
          Another student denied it hotly, saying that in her experience it was
not like that at all, she had been encouraged to find out for herself
what she thought and what she pursued.  She went on to say that
this was the Contemporary American Poetry class she was talking about.
           I've sat in on Roger Horrocks's and Wystan's classes and
I've never thought that they were imposing a canon or criteria or
opinions on their students.
           I can't see what the personal warmth of  Jane Stafford or the
supposed corruption of  all New Zealand teaching of poetry has got to
do with Alan Loney defending himself as a writer from continuing
undermining by largely unsympathetic readers.
            It is a not insignificant fact that the review that Loney
objects to is in a magazine that has public money supporting it,
while the attempts to get a magazine published with more supportive
attitudes has been rebuffed.

Maria Damon asks what was so convincing about those folks who used
hallmark cards and popular songs as their own expression -- These folks
in general had their intelligence largely in their bodies -- the one
fellow in particular looked like Baryishnikov when he moved -- more than
in their brains, so to speak, so it sure wasn't astuteness of analysis....
I was convinced I guess because of these things:
- constancy of attention to and use of popular songs and cards over time
as a means of expression
- some anxiety each week waiting to see what the hits were on the radio,
and discussion as soon as they were known as to their accuracy and
appropriateness.  when songs weren't appropriate, genuine gut level
concern and response -- stomping about, going over and over what was
wrong, etcetera -- really upset
- in thinking back, one manifestation that should seem particularly
familiar to poets -- a fair amount of time spent trying to copy out
greetings or write down words to songs in a way that had to be accurate
from beginning to end -- one mistake and the paper is crumpled, have to
try again
- incorporation of words from cards and songs into daily speech, and some
dependence upon those sources of words, which constituted a fair
percentage of language used in either oral or written forms

Ultimately I understood that while these folks had all the same emotions
as we, they had no original means of verbalizing those emotions and thus
relied entirely on the language of mass culture as exhibited particularly
in these 2 forms, resulting in a complete identification with mass
culture.  I've come to understand language use on a spectrum of
originality, with poets at one extreme attempting always first speech,
and folks such as these at the other extreme, completely mapped onto the
most mass of mass culture, with varying degrees of embeddedness in the
culture in-between.  Academic writing, it seems to me, is writing engaged
always in the process of attempting to bring new ideas -- now make sure
not too many at one time, or too original -- into embeddedness in the
culture through coercion of language use into one might say dogmatic forms.

The impact of exposure to these folks -- and let me emphasize this is of
course not everyone involved in martial arts, but a particular group I
encountered in a particular place at a particular time (St. Cloud,
Minnesota, mid-1980s) -- certainly I've met many, many other folks
involved in martial arts of one form or another who are extremely
articulate.  In fact, I think Daphne Marlatt was the first person to talk
to me about Tai Chi, which is what I was studying.... -- anyhow the
impact on me of exposure to these folks was to have a completely
different appreciation of the role of mass culture.  And I have the
sneaking suspicion that there are more folks like the ones I'm talking
about than there are folks like "us"....

When I say St. Cloud I should also point out that the folks there came
actually from all over the country; the one fellow in particular from
rural upstate New York.  We were all gathered around a brilliant master,
the fellow who brought tai chi to this country, Master T. T. Liang, who
was then in his late 80s.... and I hear is still teaching, now in
Minneapolis, those of you who are there....

Perhaps "teach" is no longer such a good description of the activity I
increasingly find myself interested in.  I prefer, however inadequately
theory matches practice, a notion of "shared inquiry."  I don't feel I
have so much that I can "Teach" others--even those with less experience
in academic forms of knowing/saying--as much as I feel competent in
asking questions and provoking others to ask their own questions.  This
is only an initial stage of forming positions, of course, but a more
productive location than "teaching" or "professing."  For me.

So, why teach?  If that term covers the sort of activity I've just
described than I would have to agree to eric pape's earlier comments to
this issue and add only that there seems a responsibility to encourage
those younger than ourselves (or less familiar with the ways of the
institutions we work within) to take up--in their own way--their own
inquiries.  There needs to be those individuals who can provide models of
something other than the productions of media personalities that pass for
such at present.  Perhaps there are other reasons--and I'd be more than
happy to hear these--but there seems no other real reason to teach than
this: giving opportunity.

I keep thinking of the permissible shorthand (code) in place within mass
culture. In response to Sandra's thoughts, I'll add a concern that I've
watched:  people molding their emotions to a set of five or so listed on the
multiple choice test implied by, say, country or whatever songs. Learning to
feel what the song says.  And if a Hallmark card misses, well, why not just
adjust a little to the right and then claim/learn to internalize (or whatever
verb might be right) THAT emotion. All of this linked to whatever level of
empowerment.

This may be ONE of the challenges we face if seeking to share more unusual
(relatively speaking) forms of writing.  People have no place for it, on
account of their having been trained and eventually submitted to a system of
simplification which rules out first thoughts and therefore causes blending,
shaving, saming (not unlike what happens when construing a "movement").

Well.

 I think you're right, Maria, that this kind of poetry can do useful
 cultural work.  And also right that my schematic formulation risks a
 too easy dismissal of that work and participates in a history of such
 dismissals, which have, importantly, often been strongly gendered (e.g.
 Pound and "Amygism").  But what i was objecting to was not the existence
 of this kind of poetry or its uses, but the *dominance* of that sort of
 definition of poetry in mainstream culture.  That dominance often
 precludes "serious" considerations of other sorts of poetry (i guess we
 shld watch out for too exclusive definitions all along the spectrum).
 There are, for ex., always some, often many, students who, with the poetry-as-
 personal-expression in place, initially resist any in-depth consideration
 of the *form* of the poetry, on the assumption that such considerations
 are too ingenious, too self-conscious, not-what-the-author-was-thinking-
 about.  It's that sort of reductive approach to poetry that i often
 find myself needing to work to move beyond by suggesting other goals
 and possibilities.  This movement "beyond" usually involves some intensive
 "close reading," but a larger sense of other possibilities-for-poetry
 seems to be necessary for such reading to take place....

Subject:      Re: Letter to the Editor (longish): The Panic of Jane Staffo

Dear Wystan,

Thanks for your friendly and thoughtful response. You're right that I didn't
include the poets is my "no-one gives a damn", I was trying to address Alan's
remarks about the effect of reviews on *readerships*. In Britain, one
seldom gets any reviews at all, and then only hurtful ones, in any bigger
funded periodicals, but I don't know one should expect them. Reviewers are
hurtful and thoughtless about the poets, just as Alan's letter was hurtful
to me as an aquaintance of Jane Stafford, both she and Alan (to my knowledge
) were wrong in their character assessments of each other's motives.

On other points, I was in Wellington in the early Nineties, I actually *hate*
Plath and Heaney and Lowell myself (which I hoped I'd indicated in my post
before, emphasising that Alan and I *both* share the love of similar
"currently marginalised" work, as I said), and I would like to see other
Wellingtonians and Aucklanders on the list, who weren't themselves a bit
nervous of offending the Aucklanders already on the list and thus blowing
their publication and reading chances - a problem also in existence for
the Apex, G2 poets generation in America. I was hoping to flush them out,
at least privately, by my posting.

I hear yours and Tony's optimism for the course - it doesn't match however
the detailed accounts I've had of it from a good ten or fifteen people I
met who had the potential of being great poetry lovers, of avant-garde
work especially; that is to say, the ten or fifteen really exciting minds
I met. It's, of course, great that your course exists, and it does do
good. But what I said I still hold by. I mentioned Michele Leggott's work
not because I don't know the scene thoroughly - I do - but because she
is the poet I have the most hope for in NZ, and yet she has stayed only
good, when she could have been brilliant - but perhaps the new book proves
me emphatically wrong, and I am stereotypically seeing her on a typical
decline. Surely it is *very* important that poets be able to take criticism
that is hurtful, that is sometimes designed to ask them to win me over, to
be really astounding (by which I don't mean mainstream). It is when
feelings get hurt too quickly and without discrimination (on the part of
the reviewed as well as the reviewer) that there can be corruption, and
nobody can be honest, and that is what I meant.

Very best

Ira

I think Jeffrey hit on a key point: good teachers give opportunites to students
that they possibly would not have had.  Whether it's leading the student
towards good (interesting, important, usefull) reading, introducing them to
others with similar interests, or going through some form of a shared inquiry,
 any little bit helps.  Especially so when it opens students to new ideas or
communities.
Without teachers/writers here like Joe Amato and Andy Levy, I would still be a
hyperactive, frustrated engineering student attacking my neighbors with my
voice and a copy of "Fox in Socks"

that John Michael Scalzi, II
(scalzi@cris.com) sent to Newt Gingrich, in the wake of the discovery of
his comments on the biological urge of men to "hunt giraffes" and to
wallow in ditches "like little piglets":

Dear Mr. Gingrich:

   My name is John Scalzi, and I am a columnist for the Fresno Bee in
Fresno, California. In the days since the unearthing of your comments
about men, women, combat, and the biological drive for men to hunt
giraffes, I have taken it upon myself to conduct a poll to see whether
that innate giraffe-hunting urge (and the little piglet wallowing urge)
is in fact alive and well in the average American male.

   While the sample polled is statistically small (50 men, basically
whomever was handy at the time) and largely comprised of white, college-
educated, gainfully employed males, I nevertheless feel that the
information gleaned from this poll will be of some value to someone,
somewhere, some time. Perhaps you yourself, should the subject of
instinctual giraffe slaughtering come up again. Certainly for me, as it
takes up the bulk of my column, to be published this Wednesday, January
25.

   Thank you for your time, and happy hunting and/or wallowing, whichever
the case may be.

I am preoccupied with these questions, working, as I do, primarily with
soldier poets and other authors of what I call "literature of trauma."  In
my forthcoming book, _Worlds of Hurt: Reading the Literatures of Trauma_
(Cambridge, October 1995), I spend a lot of time making connections between
poetry and power, therapy and politics.  I've done a lengthy study of the
work of poet W.D. Ehrhart (probably almost unknown in this crowd), who is
one of the most prolific of the Viet Nam veteran poets and who has also, by
his editorial efforts and grand collegiality, made it possible for a
generation of Viet Nam veteran poets to flourish.  The poetry of these
veterans is inseparable from their politics, from their strong antiwar
stance, from their rage at stupid death and needless destruction; the best
of them match Sassoon and Owen and Jarrell and all the other veteran poets
who get so little play these days. The same organization (Vietnam Veterans
Against the War) which acted as a catalyst for Viet Nam veteran writing was
also the birthplace of veterans' "consciousness-raising" groups--a
politicized form of therapy in which the power relation of the therapist and
the veterans was deliberately restructured so that all were equal
participants in the process of political growth and concommitant healing. It
must be emphasized, though, that the healing was believed to come out of
political action and that artistic work was political work.  The first
anthologies of Viet Nam Veteran writing (_Free Fire Zone_ and _Hearts and
Minds_) were published by activist poets as basement editions. _Hearts_ was
publshed by First Casualty Press, and all three foundesr are still working
as poets and writers today:  Wayne Karlin, Basil Paquet and Larry Rottmann.

But the invisibility of these poets in the academy is an interesting
problem.  Of the Viet Nam vet poets, only John Balaban, Bruce Weigl and
Yusef Komunyakaa have received much praise in literary academic circles and
these three are probably among the less *activist* of Viet Nam vet poets
(though they are all unabashedly antiwar and "political") and
(unsurprisingly) more connected to the writing workshop circles.  Those few
academics familiar with the field, however, are just as likely to value the
work of Ehrhart or Gerald McCarthy, Horace Coleman, D.F. Brown, Jan Barry,
Basil Paquet, or Leroy Quintana, and/or the related work of Viet Nam vet
"cowboy poets" Rod McQueary and Bill Shields. (Did you know that cowboy
poetry readings in the west can draw crowds of thousands?) There are a
couple of "pop" Viet Nam war poets, like Steve Mason, who have done well on
the trade market, but Ehrhart, for example, has a hard time getting
publishers for his poetry although the critics who write about Viet Nam war
literature write well of him.  (For a good summary of this field of poetry,
check out Vince Gotera's _Radical Visions_ [Univ of GA Press, 1994].)

I would not, of course, put "Hallmark poetry" and "poetry-as-therapy" in the
same class.  It's my guess that most poets find the writing of poetry
"therapeutic," and that the confessional/testimonial impulse is at the heart
of a great deal of the poetry we read.  It makes sense to me that some folks
who have experienced trauma (like some Viet Nam combat veterans, rape and
incest survivors, and Holocaust survivors) have a passionate committment to
convey their experience in a potent form--to make, quite literally,
world-changing fictions/poems. There is "Hallmark" confessional poetry (in
which class I'd put Steve Mason, for example), and then there is the work of
skilled craftsmen like Ehrhart or Quintana (who is best known as a
"Southwestern/Chicano poet"), which equals in power and beauty the work of
any of the "best" poets of the day.  Somehow, though, these survivor-poets
are rarely fashionable, tend not to be studied in the academy, or
anthologized regularly.  (Who reads Primo Levi's poetry now?)  I'd argue
that they're buried specifically because they *are* political, because their
work forces us to confront events-in-the-world and allows no retreat, no relief.

Maybe this will link the "academia" question to the "what does it do"
question.  Some years ago I was asked to give a talk at the MidWest
Modern Language Association.  They met that year in Kansas City, which
happens to be the world headquarters of Hallmark.  There was a panel on
the subject of Hallmark verse.  The subject of the subject was not
mentioned. Greeting card verse offers greetings, plain enough.  It also
generates sales.  (Remember the verse by the side of the road?  The
micropoetics of Burma Shave?)

I prefer Lenin's question, "What is to be done?"  Poetry _can_ do just
about anything, except perhaps disappear.  Asking a poet what poetry
"does" is a bit like spraying cat repellent on a cat.

tony green points out the problems with the  "they who use pop and  Hallmark" as
against  "we who could once use Wallace Stevens but who now have learned to use
Gertrude Stein etc etc"  model of critical inquiry.  I agree.  I'm uncomfortable
with we/theys that imply either monolithic wes & theys or dichotomized wes vs.
theys.  i love pop songs as i suspect most of the ultra-groovoids on this list
do, or have done.  "originality" is not the sole purview of modernist poets,
though it's their rallying cry. i hesitate to get into this turf here, but i
think academic people who are passionate about poetry can only gain by expanding
their embrace of other people's definitions of poetry.  Isn't the person who
waits anxiously to find out what the pop hits were, or copies greeting card
verse into a notebook, just as passionate about poetry as someone who peruses
Pound for hours on end to grok his prosodic mastery? --as someone who, until my
book came out, thought i was a "cultural studies person" with a private love of
poetry and now has a public/professional profile as a "poetry person" with a
cultural studies orientation, I feel caught between two discourse communities
when previously I didn't personally experience any discontinuity between them.

Yeah, sure (and I'll even qualify that...), but the only . . . (dare I
say MORAL) reason to teach has nothing to do with self-satisfaction
(unless it is derived from the MORAL) or with cash (though that is
necessary).  Perhaps MORAL is not the right word and I suspect its
geneaology.  Nevertheless, sometimes we take what we can get.  I agree
with Edward Foster, but beyond that?  Doesn't there need to be that MORAL
responsibility to do more than just earn cash.  Isn't that what it's
about?  Please . . . though, I use moral only to suggest the idea.  I'd
gladly exchange it with another terms.  Any ideas?

Who but Creeley could write the lines "one and one two three" and
call it a poem and have it revered as such?  Is not the "sophistication"
in this poem the reader's?  Maybe, to turn Tony's phrase a bit,
contemporary poetry is necessarily for people who've learned to
read every other kind of text.  This poem occurs because of
the weight and pressure of a reader's knowledge of poetry.  If it
anonymously occurred as a Hallmark ditty, would it resound? (I
suppose the occasion being "On your fourth child,or birthday or
something...)  I guess i'm asking, in my ignorance, could any
one else have written this and made it the same? (if we are going
to make social distinctions)

I'd agree here, but also--though the division between high and popular culture
is problematic to the extent that it denies any validity to the
study/appreciation of the latter--note that there is quite a difference
between Hallmark and Pound.  Though I'll leave that for others to account
for.  There are differences, certainly, and I, for one, would not want to
obscure those--though I am highly interested in why it is that someone
would find such fascination with Hallmark or whatever.  How about the
hullabaloo about The Brady Bunch?  I mean, why?  Because . . . .

        I question the usefulness of asking what should poetry do.
Recently in class we were discussing the threatening power of language and
poetry was by far the most reckless and endangering of all the genres.
Utopian/distopian literature ( We, 1984, Handmaid's Tale, The Republic)
Recognizes this immediately.  Plato points out that in a perfect world
there would be no poetry.  There would be nothing to challenge and no
tortured artist feeling the unquechable desire to express their emotion
lyrically.
        it is during times of repression or upheval that poetry
flourishes. Some of the finest examples of the written word have emerged
from areas where the mere act of placing pen to paper would sentence the
writer to a life of secrecy. An excellent present day example is Cuba,
where writers are drooling over donated Ray Brabury paperbacks and the
American Lit. display sponsered by the US Embassy. Sources such at this
network seem incredibly overwhelming when you realize authors in Cuba
hand stitch and bind their works together, often using olf cloth as paper.

I then ask not what does poetry do but why do you feel the need to read
or write it?

At that time in the province of pleasuregiving prosody some people were neurally programmed to dig the
referential & some people were neurally programmed to dig the unreferential.
The former tended to use hallmark cards (influenced in part by the fact that
hallmark promoted strongly proreferential TV specials) & the latter tended not
to send cards or make their own or send blank cards or send referential cards
that sounded unreferential ("season's greetings") Some people who were innately
predisposed to dig the
unreferential became anti-referential after they majored in "english". When they began to notice the strongly
referential quality of hallmark they also
became anti-pro-referential.  & some people who were innately predisposed to
dig the referential became
strongly anti-anti-referential after majoring in "english". Oh, in the same
province there were some people who were innately neutral between reference and
unreference. After some of them majored in "english" they began to question why
other people who may or may not have majored in "english" valued
hallmark card writers over non hallmark writers like gertrude
stein or ezra pound, or the other way around.

I am here picking up on a three-day-old item from Tony Green, wherein
he asks two questions, onbe after the other. First, how serious was
Olson as a historian, and then, how many historians cite him or his
views in support. As a person now writing history, but with only a BA
in history as any credentials, I would like to suggest that Tony not
see his two questions as two ways oif saying the same thing. All thru
history we have had serious historians who are not supported or
consulted by people who teach history, for example, in a university.
In class today (on Susan Howe) I told my students they could do
themselves a great favour by reading Olson's _Special View of
History_.

exactly that means) invisible, and leaves out all sorts of possibilities
for what poetry might do/be/seem/seam/dream...

It's interesting that Sandra Bramn brings in Auden because, even tho'
i've never been that into his poetry, i cldn't resist picking up
(actually putting on "hold" so it's not right in front of me) for cheap
from a used bookstore here a dusty 5 vol set of Poetry in the English
Language (or something like that) edited by Auden and Norman Holmes
Pearson (I think) & published by Viking in the '50s.  I'm not sure
that qualifies as a groovy find, BUT ANYWAY I've always found it
interesting that everyone always quotes that Auden line "poetry makes
nothing happen," but they don't quote the rest:

For poetry makes nothing happen: it survives
In the valley of its saying where executives
Would never want to tamper; it flows south
From ranches of islolation and the busy griefs,
Raw towns that we believe and die in; it survives,
A way of happening, a mouth.


So, speaking of close reading, anyone have any idea what he "meant" by
that?

Dear Jeffrey,
            As perhaps the person who destroyed the best minds of Ira
Lightman's generation I am now hesitant of offer an answer to the question.
(are you out there,Ira? What can I say?) But for my money yes there has to
be I'd say a POLITICAL reason for teaching. Aiming to make people passionate
about poetry, or passionate about anything come to that doesn't do it for
me. Passionism is too close to consumerism, as is Hallmark poetry. Teaching
has to do with the dissemination of ideas, and that includes poetry.
Teaching takes place in a culture that is shaped by ideas. The politics
comes about through the relation of the ideas taught to the ideas that shape
the culture ( a student may well bring just those ideas to the class room).
Either the teaching of poems confirms the culture, or it resists it in some
fashion. Either act is political. My interest is in the second of the
options. How do we distinguish between consumerism and dissemination?

Yes those pop songs do sometimes express "our" feelings, Chris & Sandra.
I'm not so sure about the Hallmark verse, but I find the discussion of
such possibilities and inclusions into personal speech marvelous. I
certainly find that my family members (I am child of parents who each had
eight or more siblings, leaving an extended family mostly in Oklahoma)
use such cards quite seriously, not just as a convenience, and that I am
sometimes considered odd for sending blank card with longish notes I have
written -- odd but welcome.

I think also we take ourselves too seriously in considering our poetry to
be "first thoughts" (Sheila Murphy used this term, perhaps not so
intentionally moving from the "first speech" Sandra had proposed). I've
always liked Robert Duncan's various assertions that he was a
"derivative" poet, taking from a great variety of sources (many of which
were also derivative). While the linguistic substance/forms we use may
have some chance of being original, the thoughts therein have been
thought before, I would imagine, more often than not. I'd probably be
just as upset or uplifted if another poet captured my exact feelings as
if a pop musician did.

Steve Shoemaker -- At 20 I had that entire Auden poem on yeats up on my
wall; the year before it had been Gary Snyder's poem about work; perhaps
an effort even in the hubris of youth (this now long ago) to seek
humility as a goal....  And always took from the Auden the notion that
one keeps on doing poetry because it is a way of being, NOT because it
makes something happen... Although even at 20 that was, I confess,
colored by acceptance of the notion of Rav Nachman of Bratslav -- the
great Hasidic storyteller -- that one never actually knows to whom one is
speaking -- one might be answering not the person standing before you,
but a question asked by someone else hundreds of years ago....

I like Tony Green's sense that wherever we are on the poetry scale,
Hallmark or Olson, we're moving ahead of the language we know, the
difference being the range to which the individual has already been
exposed....  I think that captures it fairly, without value judgments and
in acknowledgment of that entire range as validly poetry....

626 Broadway, 5 Fl, New York, NY  10012 (212) 460-9768

Pillars of the Clean Order

on view for one week only:
March 28 through April 4, 1995
OPENING RECEPTION: Wednesday, March 29, 6-8 PM

CENTER FOR BOOK ARTS is proud to present, for one week only, an
installation by artists Nora Ligorano and Marshall Reese. The
exhibition incorporates recent publications by leading conservatives,
as well as the artists' own limited edition version of the Republican's
Contract with America.  Ligorano/Reese's recontextualized Contract,
however, has the tenets of the Contract printed on the seats of men's
and women's pure cotton briefs.  The face of Newt Gingrich adorns
the crotch.

The Ligorano/Reese Contract with America underwear is published
in an edition of 120 signed and numbered copies.  These special
artists' works will be for sale throughout the run of the exhibition.
On the opening night of the exhibition, they will be on sale for a
special price.  After the opening, they can be found at Exit Art's
Apartment Store.

The installation at the Center for Book Arts comments on the
overabundance of trade books authored by conservatives.  Oliver
North, Dan Quayle, Pat Robertson, Rush Limbaugh, John Danforth, and
Barbara Bush, to name a few, have all penned major trade
publications promoting conservative thought. The gallery space will
be dominated by heaps of dirty laundry overflowing from hampers.
Rising from the hampers, classical columns will display the recently
published books by John Danforth (Resurrection), William Bennett
(Book of Virtue), and Oliver North's (One More Mission).  On a
clothesline strung above the hampers and stretched throughout the
gallery will hang Ligorano/Reese's underwear version of the
Contract.

There will also be a point of purchase display video highlighting the
underwear.  The video recycles imagery from Ronald Reagan's 1984
"Morning In America" spots combined with fashion shots of models
wearing the underwear.

The Center for Book Arts is located at 626 Broadway, 5th Fl., between
Bleecker and Houston.  Gallery hours are 10 am - 6 pm, Monday
through Friday, and 10 am - 4 pm on Saturdays.

John Cayley,

In response to your response of my request.

>Triple sheesh! Talk about dancing in chains. What about a 3.5" format? Even.

I don't like chains any more than you seem to.  Thought it was a reasonable
request considering I wanted to have a catalog of the show available soon.

Why don't you send me something in gaseous form?  Not too challenging though.

In-Reply-To:  <199503240955.BAA19345@whistler.sfu.ca> from "Wystan Curnow" at

The question "why teach," for me, begs the question "why learn."  A
pedagogic practice that only takes into account the shaping of
another's (the student's) mind, without the concurrent awareness of
power (the teacher's) in a class as well as the willingness (of the
teacher) to learn, serves to create institutional clones.  That one
enters a space with certain assumptions, agendas, positions etc.
indeed makes the act of teaching a political one.  What is more
crucial is whether one teaches to learn, whether one can unlearn the
habit of always hearing only what one already understands.
On this point, I have to say that I have been a student in Wystan
Curnow's now (in)famous course, some years back (team taught, as he
pointed out)--and it was marked with an openness not common in many
university (poetry) courses.  It is the recognition of the power that
goes with the privilege of disseminating knowledge, as well as the
effort to hear and learn from students (too often seen as blank
slates onto which one can inscribe one's cemented ideas) that
distinguishes "good" teachers; something I appreciate (as a
student--still!) from former teachers like Peter Quartermain, as well
as certain profs. here at SFU.

"Could any one else have written this and made it the same?" Funny that this
formulation should come up in the context of Creeley, who has an essay (if I'm
remembering right) called "Was that a real poem or did you make it up
yourself?" Shades of Pierre Menard's Quixote.

Shidney is an unknown poet to me (or is it he who rote 'The Furry Coin'?).

Is the suggestion that Roughage Factor and Groove Factor are equitable?
If so what are their derivatives?

Ed  -  respond   -   from Latin 'respondere' meaning 'promise in return'.
The spondere or promise is source of sponsor and spouse. According to my
dictionary of origins (Bloomsbury) the notion of 'obligation' survives in
the derivative 'responsible'.     But i've always liked Duncan's take from
'The Law I Love Is Major Mover':

'Responsibility is to keep
     the ability to respond.'

from the country where Major has no groove factor whatsoever

re the Auden quote posted by Stephen Howard Shoe

I asked my teacher about this piece today. She assured me that he
originally drafted it as part of a bulk commission for Hallmark cards to
comfort those who had to make (should that be pay) a visit to the Dentist
but Hallmark's response was that (and I quote):

'1) the overall tone is too obtuse for our readers

 2) percentage flossers among executives is highest per capita of the
population. These being the very people who can afford to afford private
health care and are therefore already partially
pyscho-economically-comforted the target marketing is way off beam

 4) double emphasis on 'it survives' might unnerve some purchasers

 5) the appeal to oral forms of poetry is inappropriate given the state of
the average gum or jaw post dental surgery / cosmetics  -  when sitting
quietly in a darkened room with a 'good' read is the more urgent option.'

Unfortunately this debriefing doesn't develop the obvious paradox of
reading in a darkened room. Nor does it sufficiently explicate the 'tongue
in cheek' factor required. I believe Auden's next attempt went some way
into the rich territory afforded by such. Whatever, the results failed to
sell, unlike his rhyming couplets of 'The Night Train' for the Royal Mail
service and being quickly withdrawn from the market his most, arguably,
niche work has been lost to us.

Or have I been reading the subject heading all wrong. Is it a rhetorical
question that is restricted by the e-format, when it should it fact read

"what does?"
"it do"

How are we doing in the Panamerican games?  Too bad I couldn't
attend.  I'm sure I would have done very well in the "cross-country
race."  You should see the training I've put in since February 10th!

Go on.  Health and may the spring in the blood have an addressee.

>From the mountains of the Mexican Southeast.

Insurgent Subcommander Marcos.

Mexico, March of 1995.

P.S. That, in mourning, cries.  I was listening on the little tape-player to
that one by Stephen Stills, from the album Four Way Street, that goes: "Find
the cost of freedom, buried in the ground.  Mother Earth will swallow you,
lay your body down.."  when my alter ego comes running and tells me:  It
looks like you got your way...

- Could it be the PRI has already fallen? - I ask with hope.

- No way! ... They killed you - says my alter ego.

- Me!  When?  Where?  - I ask while I go through my memories of where I've
been and what I've done.

- Today, in a confrontation... but they don't say just where -, he responds.

- Oh, good!... And did I end up badly hurt or really dead? - I insist.

- Completely dead.. that's what the news says - says my alter ego and leaves.

A narcisistic sob competes with the crickets.

- Why are you crying? - asks Durito while he lights his pipe.

- Because I can't attend my burial.  I, who loved me so much...

P.S.: That tells what happened to the Sup and Durito in the 12th day of the
withdrawal, of the mysteries of the Cave of Desire, and of other unfortunate
events that today make us laugh, but at that time took away even our hunger.

- And if they bomb us? - asked Durito in the early morning of the 12th day of
the withdrawal. ("What kind of withdrawal, a pure run," says Durito.)  It's
cold.  A grey wind licks with its icy tongue the darkness of trees and earth.

I'm not sleeping, in solitude the cold hurts twice as much.  Nevertheless I
keep quiet.  Durito comes out from his sheltering leaf and climbs up on top
of me.  To wake me up, he starts tickling my nose.  I sneeze with such
emphasis that Durito ends up, tumbling over himself, on my boots.  He
recovers and gets back to my face.

- What's up? - I ask him before he tickles me again.

- And if they bomb us? - he insists.

- Yes.. well.. well.. we'll look for a cave or something like that to hide
ourselves in... or we'll climb in a little hole... or we'll see what to do -,
I say with annoyance, and look at my watch to insinuate that it isn't the
hour to be worrying about bombings.

- I won't have any problems.  I can go anywhere.  But you, with those big
boots and that nose... I doubt that you'll find a safe place -, says Durito
as he covers himself again with a little huapac leaf.

- Psychology of terror -, I think, about the apparent indifference of Durito
regarding our fate...

- Our?  He's right!  He won't have problems, but me... - I think, I get up
and speak to Durito: - Psst... Psst... Durito!

- I'm sleeping -, he says from under his leaf.

I ignore his sleep and begin talking to him:  - Yesterday I heard Camilo and
my alter ego saying that there are a lot of caves around here.  Camilo says
he knows most of them.  There are small ones, where an armadillo would barely
fit.  And there are big ones like churches.  But he says there is one no one
dares to enter.  He says there is a ugly story about that cave.  The cave of
desire, he says they call it.

Durito seems to get interested, his passion for detective novels is his ruin.

- And what is the story of that cave? -  Well... It's a very long story.
I've heard it myself, but that was years ago now...I don't remember it well-,
I said, making it interesting.

- Fine, go on, tell it - says Durito, more and more interested.

I light my pipe.  From within the aromatic smoke comes the memory, and with
it...

The Cave of Desire.

It happened many years ago.  It is a story of a love that was not, that was
left just like that.  It is a sad story... and terrible - says the Sup
sitting on one side, with his pipe in his lips.  He lights it, and looking at
the mountain, continues:  "A man came from far away.  He came, or he already
was there.  No one knows.  It was back in other times long past and however
that may be, in these lands people lived and died just the same, without hope
and forgotten.  No one knows if he was young or old, that man.  Few are those
who saw him the first times.  It was like that because they say that this man
was extremely ugly.  Just to see him produced dread in men and revulsion in
women.  What was it that made him so unpleasant?  I don't know, the concepts
of beauty and ugliness change so much from one age to another and from one
culture to another.. In this case, the people native to these lands avoided
him, as did the foreigners who were the owners of land, men, and destinies.
The indigenous people called him the Jolmash or Monkey-face; the foreigners
called him the Animal.

The man went into the mountains, far from the gaze of all, and set to work
there.  He made himself a little house, next to one of the many caves that
were there.  He made the land produce, planted corn and wheat, and hunting
animals in the forest gave him enough to get by.  Every so often he went down
to a stream near the settlements.  There he had arranged, with one of the
older members of the community, to get salt, sugar, or whatever else the man,
the Jolmash, didn't obtain in the mountains.  The Jolmash exchanged corn and
animal skins for what he needed.  The Jolmash arrived at the stream at the
time when the evening began to darken and the shadows of the trees advanced
night onto the earth.  The old man was sick in his eyes and couldn't see
well, so that, with the dusk and his illness, he couldn't make out the face
of the man who caused so much revulsion in the clear light.

One evening the old man didn't arrive.  The Jolmash thought that maybe he had
mistaken the hour and arrived when the old man had already gone home.  To
make no mistake, the next time he made sure to arrive earlier.  The sun still
had some fingers to go before it wrapped itself in the mountains, when the
Jolmash came near the stream.  A murmur of laughter and voices grew as he
approached.  The Jolmash slowed his steps and came silently nearer.  Among
the branches and vines he made out the pool formed by the waters of the
stream.  A group of women were bathing and washing clothes.  They were
laughing.  The Jolmash looked and stayed quiet.  His heart became only his
gaze, his eyes his voice.  It was a while since the women had gone and the
Jolmash stayed on, looking... Now the stars rained down on the fields  as he
returned to the mountains.

I don't know if it came from what he saw, or from what he thought he saw,
whether the image that was engraved on his retina corresponded to reality or
if it existed only in his desire, but the Jolmash fell in love or thought
that he fell in love.  And his love was not something idealized or platonic,
it was quite earthy, and the call of the feelings that he bore was like a war
drum, like a lightning that becomes fierce rain.  Passion took his hand and
the Jolmash began to write letters, love letters, lettered delirium that
filled his hands.

And he wrote, for example, "Oh, lady of the wet glimmer!  Desire becomes a
proud leaping colt.  Sword of a thousand mirrors is the yearning of my
appetites for thy body, and in vain rips the double edge of the thousand
pantings that fly on the wind.  One grace, long sleeplessness!  One grace I
ask thee, lady, failed repose of my grey existence!  Let me come to thy neck.

Allow that to thy ear climbs my clumsy longing.  Let my desire tell thee,
quiet, very quiet, that which my breast silences.  Do not look, lady so not-
mine, at the poor mess which adorns my face!  Let thy ears become thy gaze;
give up thy eyes to see the murmurs that walk within me, longing for thy
within.  Yes, I wish to enter.  To walk thee, with sighs, the path that hands
and lips and sex desire.  Within the mouth, she wet and I thirsting, to enter
with a kiss.  On the double hill of thy breast to run lips and fingers, to
awaken the cluster of moans that in it hide.  To march to the south and to
take prisoner thy waist in warm embrace, burning now the skin of the belly,
brilliant sun announcing the night that below is born.  To evade, diligent
and skillful, the scissors on which thy grace goes and whose apex promises
and denies.  To give thee a tremor of cold heat and arrive, whole, to the
moist stirring of desire.  To secure the warmth of my palms in the double
warmth of flesh and movement.  One slow first step, a light trot next.  After
that the runaway ride of bodies and desire.  To reach the sky, and then fall.

One grace, promised tiredness!  One grace I ask thee, lady of the quiet sigh!

Let me come to thy neck!  In it I am saved, far off I die.."

One night of storms, like his passion burning his hands, a bolt of lightning
burnt down the little house of the Jolmash.  Wet and shivering, he took
refuge in the neighboring cave.  With a torch he lit his way in and found
there little figures of couples giving and receiving, the pleasure worked in
stone and clay.  There was a spring, and little boxes that when opened, spoke
of terrors and marvels that had passed that and would come to be.  The
Jolmash now could not or would not leave the cave.  There, he felt the desire
fill his hands once more and wrote, weaving bridges to nowhere...

"A pirate am I now, lady of the longed-for port.  Tomorrow, a soldier at war.
Today, a pirate lost in trees and lands.  The ship of desire unfolds its
sails.  A continual moaning, all tremor and wanting, leads the ship between
monsters and storms.  Lightning illuminates the flickering sea of
desperation.  A wet salt takes the command and the helm.  Pure wind, word
alone, I navigate seeking thee, among sighs and panting, seeking the precise
place the body sends thee.  Desire, lady of storms to come, is a knot hidden
somewhere by thy skin.  Find it I must, and muttering spells, untie it.  Free
then shall be thy longings, feminine swayings, and they will fill thy eyes
and mouth, thy womb and innards.  Free one moment only, as my hands already
come to make them prisoners, to lead them out to sea in my embrace and with
my body.  A ship shall I be and restless sea, so that in thy body I enter.
And there shall be no rest in so much storm, the bodies moved by so many
capricious waves.   One last and ferocious slap of salty desire hurls us to a
beach where sleep arrives.  A pirate am I now, lady of tender storm.  Don't
await my assault, come to it!  Let the sea, the wind, and this stone become
ship be witnesses!  The cave of desire!  The horizon clouds over with black
wine, now we are arriving, now we go..."

So it happened, they say.  And they say that the Jolmash never again left the
cave.  No one knows whether the woman to whom he wrote the letters existed in
truth or was a product of the cave, the Cave of Desire.  What they say is
that the Jolmash still lives in it, and whoever comes close becomes sick with
the same, with desire...

Durito has followed the whole story attentively.  When he sees I have
finished, he says:  We have to go.

- Go?  - I ask, surprised -  Of course! - says Durito -.  I need literary
advice to write to my old lady...

- You're crazy! - I protest.

- Are you afraid? - asks Durito ironically.

I waver.

- Well.. afraid, really afraid...no.. but it's very cold... and it looks like
it's going to rain... and.. yes, I'm afraid.

- Bah!  Don't worry.  I'll go with you and I'll be telling you where.  I
think I know where the Cave of Desire is -, says Durito with certainty.

- All right -, I say, giving in.  - You'll be in charge of the expedition-.

- Great!  My first order is that you march in the vanguard, in the center
nobody, to disconcert the enemy, and I will go in the extreme rearguard-,
indicates Durito.

- I?  In the vanguard?  I protest! - Protest denied! - says Durito with
firmness.

- O.K., soldier to the end, I'll go along.

- Good, that's what I like.  Attention!  This is the plan of attack:
First:  if there are many, we run.

Second:  If there are a few, we hide.

Third:  If there isn't anyone, forward, for we were born to die! - dictates
Durito while he prepares his little pack.

For a war plan it seemed too cautious for me, but Durito was the chief now,
and given the circumstances, I had no reason to object to prudence marching
in the vanguard.

Above the stars started to be smudged out...

- It looks like it's going to rain-, I said to Durito, excuse me, to the
chief.

- Silence!  Nothing will detain us! - shouts Durito with the voice of the
sergeant in that Oliver Stone film called Platoon.

A gust of freezing wind and the first drops...

- Haaalt! - orders Durito.

The drops of rain start to multiply...


- I forgot to mention the fourth point of the plan of attack.. - says Durito
with doubt.

- Oh yeah?  And what is it?  - I ask insidiously.

- If it starts to rain... Strategic withdrawal! -  The last words are said by
Durito now in an open run back to camp.

I ran behind him.  It was useless.  We got soaked, and shivering, we reached
the little plastic roof.  It rained as if desire had, at last, been
unleashed...

Go on again.  Health, and that the hunger for tomorrow be a desire to
struggle... today.

The Sup, inside, far inside, of the Cave of Desire.

It's March, it's early morning, and for being dead, I feel verrry well.

What does it do too?
It's not quite, as Lindz put it, that Plato "points out that in a perfect
world there would be no poetry."  Book Ten of the Republic argues that
there should be no poets in the ideal republic.  Plato, in the end, and
speaking thru Soc., invites poets to refute his arguments, in verse, and
allows as how he's prepared to relent.  Here, then, is at least one
project for poets!  As Plato knew, we won't leave, even if invited.

As a former resident of the District of Columbia, a wholly-owned
subsidiary of the U.S. Congress, I take the question of poets in the
Republic rather seriously.  We probably don't have to look to far for the
reasons that the Library of Congress changed its poetry reading schedules
so that most residents of D.C. would no longer be able to attend.  Most
of our recent U.S. Poet Laureates have made an insistence upon not moving
to D.C. a condition of their accepting the position.  One thing that D.C.
poets try to do, even when living in California as I do, is to render the
problematics of langauge and representation as literally as possible.
Newt plans to make D.C. a "lab" for the Republican third

Dear Aldon:

        As Sidney's name has been bandied about and you challenge
the poets to respond to Plato, I thought a taste of Sidney's
_Defense of Poetry_(c. 1580)

        "But now indeed my burden is great; now Plato's name
is laid upon me, whom, I must confess, of all philosophers I have
ever esteemed most worthy of reverence, and with good reason:
since of all philosophers he is the most poetical.  Yet if he
will defile the fountain out of which his flowing streams have
proceeded, let us boldly examine with what reasons he did it....
        And a man need go no further than to Plato himself to
know his meaning: who, in his dialogue called _Ion_ giveth high
and rightly divine commendation unto poetry.  So as Plato,
banishing the abuse, not the thing, not banishing it, but giving
due honour unto it, shall be our patron, and not our adversary.
For indeed I had much rather (since truly I may do it) show their
mistaking of Plato (under whose lion's skin they would make an
ass-like braying against poesy) than go about to overthrow his
authority; whom, the wiser a man is, the more just cause he shall
find to have in admiration; especially since he attributeth unto
poesy more than myself do, namely, to be a very inspiring of a
divine force, far above man's wit, as in the fornamed dialogue is
apparent."

        For those not satiated by this sound bite, see "A Defense
of Poetry," in _Miscellaneous Prose of Sir Philip Sidney_ edited
by Katherine Duncan-Jones and Jan Van Dorsten, for Sidney's full
argument, the first of its kind in English.

The week of March 6 was so busy for me that I had no time to
check in here. Then was away for the next week.

Result? Over 200 messages -- worse yet, the discussion was
quite interesting! I missed lively topics, too bad for me
(tho I'll probably reach back opining in the coming days),
but do want to contribute now to the "current reading"
query:

I'm in the middle of _Intimate Letters_, Janacek's correspondence
with Kamila Stosslova. Also reading _Penser, Classer_ by Georges
Perec. This is a collection of short and occasional essays and
is wonderful (but untranslated -- don't miss _Avoid_ however
the translation of La Disparution, GP's novel without e's: it
shd be out just abt now).

        Adin Steinsaltz's _The Long Shorter Way_
        Laura (Riding) Jackson's _Lives of Wives_
        Ron Silliman's N/O
        Harry Mathews' _The Journalist_

are stacked up, and I'm waiting for the new books by Rae Armentrout
and Carla Harryman (mentioned here w/in the last week; but I'm not
near my booklist and alas can't remember the names) as well as
Jessica Grim's Locale. Also eagerly awaiting the new (18th)
volume in Patrick O'Brian's ongoing series of novels about
his twin characters Aubrey/Maturin and their lives and adventures
in the British navy during the Napoleonic wars. Again, I ccan't
recall the name of this not-yet-here volume.

Kali Tal writes that...

"...the confessional/testimonial impulse is at the heart
of a great deal of the poetry we read.  It makes sense to me that some folks
who have experienced trauma (like some Viet Nam combat veterans, rape and
incest survivors, and Holocaust survivors) have a passionate committment to
convey their experience in a potent form--to make, quite literally,
world-changing fictions/poems. There is "Hallmark" confessional poetry (in
which class I'd put Steve Mason, for example), and then there is the work of
skilled craftsmen like Ehrhart or Quintana (who is best known as a
"Southwestern/Chicano poet"), which equals in power and beauty the work of
any of the "best" poets of the day.  Somehow, though, these survivor-poets
are rarely fashionable, tend not to be studied in the academy, or
anthologized regularly.  (Who reads Primo Levi's poetry now?)  I'd argue
that they're buried specifically because they *are* political, because their
work forces us to confront events-in-the-world and allows no retreat, no
relief."

This is terrifyingly interesting territory.

The intersection and differences of "confession/testimony" and the
intention of poetry to "force us to confront events-in-the-world"

        (perhaps one shd simply say that poetry actually presents
        events in the world and that this is something that other
        traditions of expression are not organized to do. Sometimes
        this is being forced to confront, sometimes it is being
        allowed, or even enabled/aided to confront)

must account - at least in part - for its persistent recurrence

        (tho it is also an example of recurrence, a form of recurrence
        a practice organized around recurrence)

and for the obsessively recurrent hold this practice has from an early
age on those who go on to spend

        (in the most generous senses of the word)

their lives on it. And explain our interest in such work of testimony

        (for what else sustains the presence of work such as that,
        lets say, of John Wieners, or other poets NOT the subject
        of manufactured conferences)

as tends to unique instance of language, a testimony as in Primo Levi
or in Celan, surely not "buried."

Kali Tal wonders why we read poetry which is not "pleasurable."

But do we? What is pleasure? (the pleasure of the text, the pleasure of
the senses, the pleasure of the unknown . . .

Is language pleasure?  my mouth & ears both believe so, in a fairly
uncomplicated sense    the intellect and emotions, too, but not in any
simple sense at all     and altogether now  (all together now . . .

Is content any more pleasure than the lingering physicality of language?
or is it, in part, the same pleasure?

Dear Kali:
     I don't think that anyone reads poetry--and by that I mean *really*
reads it (more than skimming it, or simply noting its presence)--that is
not "pleasurable" in some sense. I think people who say that they do read
(allegedly) "non-pleasurable" poetry actually derive pleasure from doing
that (as well as from thinking/talking/writing about it--"it" being both
the poetry & the act of reading it). A poem may well have been written
with the intention of "writing against" a reader's pleasure, but the
moment one takes that (or anything else the poem brings up directly or
indirectly) into consideration, begins *thinking* about it, one begins
experiencing pleasure...no? Admittedly, my definition of "pleasure" (which
includes thinking, considering--a general term might be
"engagement"--Charles Bernstein, why don't you--or, do you?--consider
*engagement* with a text a kind of absorption?) might be so generalized
and/or inclusive as to be ultimately meaningless.
     Semi-related to this: This idea of "consumerism/ dissemination."
(Can't remember now who brought this up! Please re-identify yourself!) My
sense is that consumerism with respect to *anything* disseminated is
unavoidable. If I send out copies of a poem to three or four friends
(which is what I do with a certain portion of my work), then I and my
three or four friends are engaging in an act of consumerism as well as an
act of dissemination. I have almost a whole bookcase devoted to
manuscripts I've received, some from friends, some from others, & these
are no different to me (in essence) from the "published"  things I've got
on other bookshelves. (The only reason the mss. are separated is because
they're too tall to fit on the other shelves.) I've even written and had
published a *review* of one manuscript someone sent me to read, & plan to
continue doing that when & as possible.
     What is the difference between paying (say) Station Hill to publish
your manuscript and making photocopies of the ms. & sending it out to
friends & others potentially interested in reading it? Or, for that
matter, what's the difference between finding an editor of a small press
to publish your book (including paying for it--& do editors w/out family
money, rich friends, or successful nonprofit orgs *do* that anymore?--not
a rhetorical question, btw)--well, what's the difference between that &
sending your work around, in whatever form?
     As a reader, I have to say I appreciate, even prefer, books w/out
blurbs, blurb-like matter, ISBN numbers, LOC info, bar codes, etc. I have
more respect for "lower key" magazines like _Mirage_, _lower limit
speech_, _Situation_, _North American Ideophonics_, and _Talisman_ than I
do magazines like _Zyzzyva_, _Sulfur_ and _Conjunctions_. (I also tend to
be more interested in the work the former examples publish.) But, I'm also
aware of the notion that you might want to sell a few books or mags,
especially if you're paying production costs. & bookstores these days are
increasingly unwilling to stock books or mags w/out all of the "bullshit."
The books my wife Marta & I publish include all of the "bullshit,"
*despite* my sense that it somehow "cheapens" the things.
Dissemination--almost all of it, at any level--involves some degree of
compromise. It helps, I think, if you can be consistently aware of that,
know beforehand what you are or are not willing to do. If you simply want
the work out there, in whatever form, available for people to read it,
you'll likely be willing to do just about anything to make that happen,
including saying things you don't believe, or (just as bad) withholding
your real thoughts in fear of offending someone who could "fuck up your
career."
     So, while I do think there's no such thing as dissemination free from
consumerism, I don't think consideration of either is pointless. Would
like to see more on this topic, actually.
     Yours,
     Gary

Since the question of what poetry does is a difficult one, I thought it
might be useful to provide you with a writing model to guide your
responses.  So, here is an excerpt from the introduction to Vol 4 of my
groovy new/old Poets of the English Language set:

  "What is man? How does he differ from the gods on the one hand and from
nature on the other?  What is the divine element in man? A different set
of answers to such questions, or a shift of emphasis in the old answers,
changes the style and subject matter of poetry and the poet's conception
of his [sic] function.
  For example, in the age of the heroic epic the difference between gods
and men is that the former are immortal and the latter must finally all
die like the beasts.  In the meantime, however, some men are made godlike
and separated from nature by the favor of the gods, becoming heroes
who do great deeds.  The poet, that is, the man inspired with the gift of
tongues, celebrates the hero and his acts.
  In the Middle Ages, the quality which man shares with God and which
the creatures do not have is a will that can make free choices.  What
separates man from god is sin: that he can and does choose wrongly, love
himself, act selfishly.  The function of the poet is to exhibit the
human soul tempted by competing loves, and to celebrate the ways in which
she [sic?] can be redeemed.
  In the neoclassical period, the divine human quality is reason, the
capacity to recognized general laws, and the function of the poet is
to celebrate the Rational City and to pour scorn on its enemies.
  Toward the end of the eighteenth century--Rousseau is one of the first
symptoms--a new answer appears.  The divine element in man is now held to
be neither power nor free will nor reason, but self-consciousness.  Like
God and unlike the rest of nature, man can say "I": his ego stands
over against his self, which to the ego is a part of nature.  In this
self he can see possibilities; he can imagine it and all things as
being other than they are; he runs ahead of himself; he forsees his
own death... [omitted citation of Holderlin's Der Mensch].  If
self-awarenss and the power to conceive of possiblity is the divine
element in man, then the hero whom the poet must celebrate is himself,
for the only possible consciousness accessible to him is his own..."


That brings us up to the Romantic Period.  With this model before you,
it shld be a relatively easy matter to define the function of poetry
for the modern and contemporary periods in 75 words or less. Additional
points will be awarded for effective deployments of such concepts as
"postmodernism," "pop culture," and the "death of the author."
Points will be deducted for scatalogical puns on the word "function"
(tho' references to "eschatology" are welcome).

Did any of y'all see that egregious piece on the Poetry Scene and
Readings in the New York Times Book Review a few weeks back?  The hack
who wrote it reported the "Was that a real poem or did you write it
yourself?" question as having been put to another poet at another time,
post-Creeley -- indicating to me (unless it was the case that the
questiner was alluding to Creeley and the dimwit poet who retells the
story didn't get it) that Creeley's anecdote/title has entered the
anecdotage of the MFA/AWP contingency as apocryphal text without
attribution,,,rather like hearing Rosa Lopez report, through her
interpreter, that O.J. had once told her that "poetry makes nothing
happen."

Am I the only one who reads Auden's emphasis this way?  that if we want
to make "nothing" happen, we should write poems.  A neat trick to
confound philosophy.  Where would we be without that nothing that is so
difficult to produce? Thank Allah for the Arabic mathematicians.

Art is form extending content. Many greeting cards, by Hallmark and other
corporations, make use of this.

"Greeting" comes from a web of roots with a current usage showing at the
surface in Scots dialect, expressing the idea of weeping or lamenting -
mostly loudly. Poems have a range of registers.

"Turn that TV down while your sister reads her cards; then, you can have
some cake." A Hallmark is not always a verse; is it?

And I would be proud to have written the works of Irving Mills, even when
they don't express my sentiments exactly. "Doo wop doo wop, doo wop doo
wop, doo wah."

Subject:      Mystery Slasher

From today's San Francisco Chronicle:

Mystery Slasher Gutting Books in South Bay
by Michael Taylor, Chronicle Staff Writer

A mysterious literary critic, well versed in poetry, is slicing his way
through libraries in Santa Clara and Santa Cruz counties, chopping out the
contents of volumes of modern poetry.

Armed with a razor or matte knife, the unknown slasher has gutted books by
such well-known modern poets as Philip Levine, David Shapiro and Philip
Booth.  The slasher leaves the books' spines and covers on the shelves, but
takes the pages.

"Obviously, this is somebody with a problem," said Dave Fishbaugh, director
of library services at West Valley College Library in Saratoga.  "It's the
most outrageous example of book mutilation I've seen."

Fishbaugh said that whoever is doing this has cut up about 150 titles at
more than a dozen libraries in Milpitas, Morgan Hill, Palo Alto, Santa
Cruz, San Jose, Los Gatos and other South Bay cities.  No suspect has been
identified.

About two-thirds of the books that have been destroyed are out of print,
Fishbaugh said, and are effectively irreplaceable.

Fishbaugh and other librarians say the slasher typically cuts out all the
pages and then replaces the book on the shelf.  The first case of vandalism
was discovered at the end of January at Foothill College in Los Altos
Hills.

"One of our shelvers-that's a person who puts books back on shelves--came
to us and was very alarmed at finding a stack of covers and spines on the
shelves," said Karen Gillette, Foothill's public services librarian.

"The books were gutted and then put back on the shelves, but they weren't
in the right place.  That's how we found out about this."

In addition to cutting up books, the slasher also carved up three years'
worth of a monthly publication called Poetry Magazine.

So far, library officials have no motive for the vandalism.  Some
librarians think the slasher may want to steal the verse without triggering
alarm systems that work off magnetic codes in book spines.  Others think
the thief may be scanning the poetry pages into a computer and creating a
home-made poetry database.

Poets whose works were mutilated were perplexed and frightened.  One
hesitated to talk, thinking the slasher might cut up more of his books.
Another said the culprit might be jealous over being rejected for a poetry
anthology.

In Castine, Maine, poet Philip Booth-who had some of his nine books slashed
at Foothill College-said, "It certainly seems strange to me that a reader
of poetry would do this.  If this person is going around the country doing
this-hitting Levine and me in every collection-than maybe someday Philip
Levine and I ought to check and see if there's someone in our deep past who
is common to both of us."

At Poetry Magazine in Chicago, managing editor Helen Klaviter said, "The
poetry world attracts people on the fringes, and one can never tell exactly
what's going to happen.  It could be someone who's not getting published or
someone who disagrees with the way these people write.  Maybe this person
thinks these poems should be in a different style or form, or wants them to
rhyme."

Asked how she felt about somebody slashing up her magazine, Klaviter said,
"I'm floored, I'm speechless.  But part of me is very grateful that it's my
magazine that's being cut up and not me."

I want  to than Wynston Curnow (hope I got that right), cris cheek, and
especially Karlyn Y-Mae Koh for their posts.  Koh's post said all I could
have hoped to have said on the matter and would defer to her on this
matter--particularly as she articulates what it is I could only vaguely
allude to with words like "MORAL" and "RESPONSIBILITY."  I meant to be
somewhat provocative with them and hoped to avoid being seen as
advocating a role of Teacher/Prof as source of info into which it is
poured into the student--accompanied by all the power/authority relations
therein.  My primary motivation--well-intentioned I assure you--was to
confront what I see around me in teachers/profs of an attitude of
cynicism about the endeavor they are engaged in.  If (and this is not
directed at any one in particular) teaching and, especially, "teaching"
literature is only about making a living (or other narrow purpose) it
would seem to me to be a major injustice not only to self but student.
Quite simply, "teaching" (and I prefer shared inquiry") is and should be
political--but political precisely to the extent that it challenges the
process that produces what Koh refers to as clones.  And, further,
political to the extent that power/authority in the classroom is shared.
These are vague remarks, but I hope their imperatives are clear:
responsibility is not ... domination; and moral is not my values are
better than  your's.

Dear Wystan,

Just to say (and in case this seems like just a personal, best backchannelled,
NZ chat, I hope others might have seen some of addressing of the teaching
issues we've all been discussing, in this discussion of a specific case),
that I appreciated your witty "I who have destroyed the best minds of
my generation", laughed aloud, in fact, and I appreciate the openness to
discussion. I wasn't, in fact, attacking you personally at all, nor any
of the persons I mentioned; as I said, I think you do do a really good
thing. I was just saying the whole system you and I work in could be
better, and perhaps "corruption" was an overly melodramatic word for
"missed chances", and the fact that it always galls when it appears that
someone one's own age is being preferred, either for classroom attention
or publication, because they have honed themselves into a perfect disciple
(which is always flattering for a teacher, and it remains, perhaps, the
teacher's greatest responsibility to resist it), when their discipleship
ultimately fossilises the past (reflecting on what was good about the
teacher and his/her favourites) and doesn't release the present (the potential
combination in the student of all the things she/he thinks will impress and
all the other things she/he is editing out of her/himself). This is a complex
issue, since sometimes it is the best thing one can do with one's life to
insist on the greater relevance of a neglected past writer over all the
writers currently living, eg the rehabilitation of Stein in the eighties. But
such a sacrifice is often not what's involved in the teacher/student "missed
chances" I'm describing, and usually happens precisely because there is no
teacher to impress with one's passion from the past. One might see in this
tortuous bad description of mine a way of explaining one kind of inheritance
of a national or indigenous experimental or otherwise tradition, and what can
go wrong with it. I really think that one of the very best young poets of
New Zealand is a Wellingtonian called Max Anderson, who had three poems a
few years ago in Landfall, and who I tried to encourage, as a friend not
a teacher; as soon as I left Wellington, he gave up poetry completely, and
moved to London, pretty much wholly out of lack of encouragment. He was
into John Ashbery, Thom Gunn and Allen Curnow, and his own work was just
wonderful, but he kept getting told he was too British, despite that being
a third of his total influence. And of course in Britain he's not going to
start up again, because he keeps getting told he's too kiwi. So it's not
you in particular I'm attacking, because it's a kind of pack behaviour that
is common all over - I could give examples from this university too, of a
student who was the best pop culture theorist, taught me buckets, but who
got discouraged and downgraded solely for his choice of subject matter and
theoretical bearing (the equivalent of influence for a poet?), and is now
a bitter and spiteful man -as he couldn't get funding to continue research
without good grades. So what I mean by "corrupt" is exactly what Alan means
by corruption in the mainstream, kneejerk phobias and pack behaviour, with
really talented individuals discouraged over people who can recite back the
formulae but, since they never had to do the work you yourself did (and I
love Cancer Daybook!) to set your own bearings. What a lot of avant-gardists
think they're doing, in my experience, is trying to make it easier for the
kind of rebel they were when younger, but they in fact don't. But I hope
this isn't perceived as a monochromatic attack, just some reservations and
criticisms; as i said before, the Auckland library collection is great, and
was vital in my own researches and (exhausting, as yet undefeated) attempt
to make my own way.

Best,

Ira

The crunch of this question as Kali Tal has focussed it lies in:

>work [which] forces us to confront events-in-the-world and allows no retreat,
>>no relief.

There are multiple ways through which poetry 'allows no retreat, no relief'.
But here I feel disadvantaged as, being a limey, I've no idea what Hallmark
cards really project.
Am I right in thinking that they contain pretty much cliche sentiments to
suit 'occasions of passage' or just express goodwill messages in ahandy
'off the peg' fashion?

            'The President would like to say
            She hopes that you have a nice day'

If I'm generally at least in the environs of the Hallmark Ballpark then
aren't these poetries intended to offer at the least 'relief' if not
necessarily 'retreat'?

I'll stop there, in case I'm way off with my projected assumptions re Hallmark.
Anybody help me out?

Cris, I think you're dead on. The problem as I see it of Hallmark cards and
other such genres (I can't think of anything else to call it) is that their
primary function seems to be affirmative. Things aren't as bad as they seem,
in fact they are pretty darn good. This is not a problem only related to
Hallmark but kid's cartoons (care bears;barney) and sitcoms (where Johnny's
anti-social acting out by throwing water balloons off the balcony are
resolved when dear old dad turns the hose on his) and talk shows (have
a problem with incest, let the expert andthe audience help you!).
     The function of all of these is to provide pseudo-solutions.
This isn't to say that there is not he possibility of finding accurate
criticism in these. Beavis and Butthead can be quite critical, and Oprah
and Salt and Pepa have provided forums for issues most of us would like to
suppress as deeply as possible. But it would be a mistake as I see it to
forget their primary purpose which seems clearly to me to reassure.
     Thanks, Eric.

Maybe the problems we've all been addressing, that of teaching, and
what poetry does, can be said to be problems of mastery. Which is
how we avoid the "bad faith of the professor," or the assumption
that all can be known about anything. Whether we are teaching or
writing, thinking can never stop; you can't ever pretend you
got it all down. WHich means sometimes that our students know
more than us, in moreways than one.Which means when we are
writing, its not always us who is writing, eh?
     Some thoughts, Eric.

>What a lot of avant-gardists think they're doing, in my experience, is trying
>>to make it easier for the kind of rebel they were when younger, but they in
>>fact don't.
Posted listwards as there are some general issues here although one or two
of the characters are probably anglo-specific.

Ira are you only a rebel when you're younger  -  have you seen the Tony
Hancock movie 'The Rebel'? I'm uncertain as to the applicability of terms
such as avant-garde and rebel these days. I'm curious as to what you're
suggesting  - if you have a positive suggestion in respect of what you
appear to articulate as an impasse for teachers as well as peers. Or are we
caught in the hoollowed walls of academe here?

1.   I remember Jeff Nuttall once telling me of how, when he was Head of
Department at Liverpool School of Art (or close) there were many students
who had astounding facility with a line (drawing)  -  they could, in his
sense, make a line do whatever they wanted. These were, in his view, highly
skilled draughtspeople. BUT, he said, the ones with the 'natural born
talent' (almost a saleable film title there I think) were often not those
who went on to become 'professional artists'. Maybe, you could say, they
just had more sense. But his point was that the people who became artists
were those who 'wanted' to become artists and who pursued that  -  .

2.   Eric Mottram was one of the poets with whom I made initial contact as
a young, nineteen year old (sort of average undergraduate age) would-be
poet. I learned a great deal from him and yet he was downright discouraging
to my work for about two or three years. He was a useful poet to develop
resistances against.

3.   Poets who actively encouraged and promoted my emergent practices at
that time, Bob Cobbing, Allen Fisher, Ulli Freer among others I considered
to be both 'teachers' and 'peers'  -  although admittedly I never felt
myself to be in a formalised teacher-pupil relationship with them. It would
be my contention that anybody who enters the institutionalised education
system (thereby syllabus, curriculum and government ideology) deserves
everything that they get  -  and I say this as somebody who is now twenty
years later enrolled as a student and bugging the hell out of my own
'teachers'.

4.   This whole confrontation of being perceived and buttoned as too 'kiwi'
or 'brit' and so on astonishes me. I find it difficult (i know I find
everything difficult) to understand how anyone can take criticism
articulated on such a basis with anything other than the utter contempt it
deserves. At the very least such resistances should be sufficient
encouragement.

5.    The desire for repetition (to hideously paraphrase Deleuze and
Guattari) is the beginnings of the recognition of a need to mutate. The
actual citation reads:
'Repetition is not the law, the finality of something; on the contrary, it
marks the [I would say 'a'] threshold to "deterritorialization", the
indication of a desiring mutation.'

Seems like this begins to propose an approach to the question Why Teach?

6.    I do recognise the pack or clique behaviour you mention, the
potential claustrophobia of prevalent 'taste' (the 'canon' of any
consensual given moment)  -  happens again and again, particularly among
male poets propping up the bar around reading series' notable for 'almost'
cover to cover beefcake programming.

Subject:      someone gets a kick out of hallmark texts

people who read work of the`confront-events-in-the-world-&-allows-no-retreat-&-no-relief' type do
so either because it makes them feel good [aesthetically or ethically or both]
or because they are forced by others. The latter case includes people who are
majoring in 'english' (as a nonforeign language?) & must read that type of work when it is
'required reading' whether or not it makes them feel good.

Not being able to retreat or experiencing relief (even thinking of those
situations) makes me feel bad, so i always want to find out which works fall into the
no-retreat/no-relief category so I can avoid them.

i am convinced that hallmark poetry belongs in the no retreat/no
relief category. Many times it makes you confront events in the world (e.g.
birth, death) and there is no retreat & no relief from sending or receiving
them.

Dear Eric Pape,
         How about going further.  Students know lots, but poets,
painters, musicians also know things.  So who teaches who is an
interesting question.  "I am teaching Michelangelo to-day" should
read I'm finding out what looking at X or Y or Z  by Michelangelo has
got to offer?   Ergo,"Michelangelo teaches me"?  Or you-name-it
teaches.  This is a problem of positioning of the subjects, -- whose
roles in the class room are defined as teachers and students.
Teaching is gross when it gets to be indoctrination, isn't that the
issue?

Here in what, at least up until recently, used to be the center of
cultural studies-land in the US, one actually feels quite beleaguered if
one prefers Olson to Hallmark, or oil paintings to TV.  The editor of the
Journal of Communication, for which I edit the book review section, was
considering doing a special issue of all those pieces that we'd love to
write but are forbidden in today's climate.  I proposed a piece on
tolerating those who love elite art forms as acceptable deviants in a
popular culture world focused on "difference"....

A question to those who run the list -- it seemed to me that while we
were discussing whether or not to break the list up into different
categories in order to reduce the amount of mail and produce more focused
discussions, you've also much expanded the list in terms of numbers,
without comment.  Comment?

With regard to the subject of teaching and writing:  In an APR interview
from 1989, Donald Hall stated that he deplored the separation of
creative writing programs from the teaching of literature (to grads
or undergrads) because:

"If you teach great literature you live among the great models.  You
make your living reading Moore and Pound and Hardy and Marvell and
Yeats! Incredible.  Students ask you questions, and when you answer
you discover that you knew something you didn't know you knew.  Instead
of living with half-baked first drafts by narcissistic teenagers [in
workshop classes], you live with the _greatest art_.  What could be a
better way to spend your spare time--when you're not competing
directly with Wordsworth--than be reading Wordsworth."

Other than the fact that I find teaching to be more than a "spare
time" activity (if it's done well), I find Hall's rationale for the
presence of the poet in the English department quite reassuring.

Yes, Ryan, anyone, in so far as the text consists of simply readily
available words for numbes and a well-known conjunction.  But only at
a given place in a given situation would anyone think that that was a
poem, for Pete's sake!  Is that what you are saying?  Do you read
Thierry de Duve, whose intricate and rich meditations on this
problem occur in English in "Pictorial Nominalism".  Ready-made are
the words, but their positioning, that's something else.

 Hi Al!  Welcome to see you here.  In your post last Friday you said
something which I've puzzled over, but haven't gotten clear:  that DC
poets "try to render the problematics and language and representation as
literally as possible."  I'm not sure I have much stake in the question,
since I'm a resident of Arlington VA, but what =is= a literal rendition of
the problematics of language and representation?   Maybe you're
suggesting that DC poets, close to the realities of political action,
sense they need to be more straightforward in order to have an impact in
the world?  That's an interesting idea, and may be true of many poets
around here (but not perhaps so true of those DC poets I know who are
actually on this list).  But I think I just failed to catch the sense you
intended to convey.

As for the LC readings, I wonder if you're representing the situation
around here accurately -- it's true that most of the readings are held at
6:45 pm, instead of 8 pm.  The announced logic for this change (which
still corresponds to the closing-for-repairs of the grand Coolidge
Auditorium in the old, main Jefferson building of the Library) is that
now people who want to attend after work before going home may do so.
Apparently it was felt that people wouldn't come back to town, because of
the logistics involved in commuting.  And most folks who work in the
District who have any interest in attending the kinds of readings
sponsored by the L.C. face at least some commute, even if only to outer
areas of the District.  I guess I don't see how a 6:45 reading precludes
DC residents from attending the readings.  Of course someone may be
worried that some people would be reluctant to come to "dangerous"
Capitol Hill so late as 8 pm at night, and there would doubtless be some
racism involved in such a hypothesis; but 6:45 is nighttime around here
during a significant part of the poetry season anyway, and even the 6:45
readings don't get finished till close to 9 pm, cetainly dark during the
spring and fall portions of the LC schedule.

I don't know why we have a poet laureate -- I should say, I don't think
we ever should have had to employ that honorific title.  But lots of the
Consultants in Poetry, like the current Laureates, kept their residences
elsewhere.  Some did spend a lot of time here in DC, and were locally
admired for it.  But the truth is the gig doesn't pay that well -- last I
heard it was maybe $20K-- but that's just a rumor whose truth I can't
verify.  Not much to live on here in DC -- though OBVIOUSLY more than
many poor folks here have to survive on somehow.  But if Rita Dove wants
to spend a lot of time in Charlottesville, two hours away, that doesn't
seem horrific to me.

Yes this is the question but I'm not sure if that is what I'm saying.
In fact, I only posed a question.  But I don't know if I agree that
"ONLY at a given place in a given situation " do words become poems.
I whole-heartedly endorse found poetry: too much rhymes when you
mind your prospects.  And no I haven't read "Pictorial Nominalism".
Should I?

Dear Ryan,

         Reading could speed up discussion of the "ready-made"
aspect, [not that speed is everything].  And the situation in
question in the Creeley poem you introduced in here supposes
a cultural situation in which that particular "piece" comes to be
interesting, as much as anything for its seeming simplicity, and
consequent confusion of the field of "what poetry is".

It still has that effect, I guess.   Anyways, Thierry de Duve is a
good read.  I offer that as a recommendation of something pleasant
and interesting for someone who raises the interesting questions you
ask (not as some awful academic Duty.)

Cheers.

I like what Gary Sullivan said to Kali. I know he was talking about
reading for enjoyment but the message hits me in the following way.

Political statements can be poetry or propoganda or both. Propoganda can
be the truth in a political context. But if it is poetry, the residue
that is left will be regarded more for its aesthetic content than its
political. Because politics has a way of being current and art has a way
of being eternal or out of time.

Some artists or poets or whatever get to their essence by virtue
of their politics and others stand outside it. I think someone like Joyce
stood outside it but dealt with it continually. Someone like Virginia
Woolf had to deal with it more directly, or maybe more personally,
because she had a stake in changing a system she considered an injustice
to herself and other women. Joyce didn't need to deal with that basic issue.
All he needed to do was prove he was the greatest writer of the English
language since Shakespeare!

Someone like Gertrude Stein, who I studied pretty heavily my 1st year of
college and who gave me my lead into the world of visual arts, got around
the women's issue by identifying with men as a man. However she looked
down on women for the most part. Virginia Woolf liked women, she held on
to that in her writing. It seems to me she is a woman writer. Gertrude Stein
wasn't really gender oriented in her writing. I like her audacity,
her assurance and her love of artists and writers.

Then I think their are people who live what might be called poetic lives.
In a large sense people like Malcolm X and Nelson Mandela are such
people.

Subject:      Pop will eat itself (fwd)

I've been lurking and mulling this whole thing over for a couple of
days.  I've always been a fan of Popism, Warhol has been my hero since I
was a preteen.  Howver I've  never been a fan of Hallmark (I like far side
cards) but I do see its place in the Forrest Gumpville, USA  that has become
ever so annoying and popular.
        But packaging and selling that warm fuzzy feeling is an aspect of
Western culture that i look at as a very precise art form.  HAllmark has
to be given credit for that atleast.  Playing off our guilt enough to
convince us that Secretary's Day is viable holiday is pretty impressive.
        I think the reason we can't swallow Hallmark as art is because it
masquarades itself as true sentiment.  It's sells love and apologies.
It prostitutes what is supposed to be near and dear for $2.50 and seals
it in a red envelope.  Another amazing and similar consumer frenzy is
going on in the long distance phone business, yet we aren't quite as
threatened by that surge simply because it doesn't come to us in the form of
verse.
        Idon't know I'm sort of babbling, but Hallmark is Hallmark and
poetry is .  .  . well I don't know, but I do agree with Warhol, i like
my art with mistakes.  The canvas never looks right unless it has streaks
and smudges, that's how you tell its authentic.

                Lindz Williamson


What I'd like to know is what is with the revial of the Western?
I've noticed three definite themes reappearing in poetry, fiction and film
using the western genre.
1) The wise old Indian stereo type, return to nature and the mother earth
spirit.
2( The independent I am a cow girl so don't mess with me female
empowerment in the Wild West, yet I will throw myself down to the one man
that can tame me.
3)And finally the its ok white boy your not all that bad, not all of you
are blood sucking colonialists, some of you can read keats and castrate a
bull all in a days work.

Can anyone give me any insight?

I really like the idea of Hallmark as propaganda.  It's a secure medium
of which  everone is familiar, a perfect place to hide enforcements of
proper social behavior from Middle america.  Who knows maybe it's a plot?
Or am I just becoming paranoid?

The following message is from the American Arts Alliance:


          URGENT     ACTION ALERT     URGENT

      SENATE BEGINS DEBATE ON THE PROPOSED FY 95 RESCISSIONS

                GRASSROOTS CONTACTS NEEDED


 ISSUE:  The Senate Appropriations Committee, chaired by Senator Mark
Hatfield (R-OR), just announced that it will consider the FY 95
rescission package this Friday, March 24, with floor consideration
anticipated as early as next week.  Like the House bill, which passed
last week, the Senate proposal is expected to contain $17 billion in
spending cuts -- over $5 billion to pay for California emergency aid and
$11 billion for deficit reduction. The House bill also contains a $5
million cut to both the NEA and NEH. (The House NEA cuts are targeted:
$1 million from its administrative budget and $4 million from
unobligated program funds, most of which is directed at individual
fellowships.)

      Last week, arts advocates scored a victory when the House
defeated, by a vote of 260 to 168, an amendment that would have tripled
the NEA funding reduction in the House bill from $5 to $15 million.
Defeat of the NEA amendment is significant because sponsors Phil Crane
(R-IL) and Cliff Stearns (R-FL) implored conservative House Democrats
and Republicans to support deeper cuts in the NEA's budget.

 SENATE ACTION NEEDED:  To register broad based support for cultural
funding, we need you to get in touch with your Senators and urge them to
oppose any funding reductions to the NEA and NEH.  WE URGE YOU TO CALL
YOUR SENATORS BY FRIDAY MORNING, MARCH 24.  Express your opposition to
NEA funding cuts by using the sample message below.  The congressional
switchboard number is (202) 224-3121.

                          SAMPLE MESSAGE

      The Senate soon will be considering a rescission package to this
year's (FY 95) budget.  Please oppose any attempt to cut NEA and NEH
funding.

The NEA already has suffered budget cuts over the past several years.
In fact, the NEA's budget has lost nearly 50 percent of its purchasing
power over the past 15 years.  The agency is playing its part in deficit
reduction.

      Such cuts have limited the agency's ability to serve the American
 public.  Both the NEA and the NEH are wise investments that merit
national support.  These cultural agencies help your constituents.
These agencies' investments help generate jobs, create a competitive
labor force for the future, revitalize communities, improve education,
enhance tax bases and stimulate economic growth, increase tourism, and
improve the development and growth of auxiliary services.

Q:  What's the difference between a good langpo
    and a tree?

A1: Nothing.
A2: Everything.
A3: The Answer, like the Question, is beside the point.
A4: The tree, unlike the langpo, isn't preoccupied with
    defining its position. It occupies it.

Take your pick. I like A4 (& not just cause it's longer).
Does theorize mean think about or write about what
you think about - or maybe do these things in specific
contexts or forums - as per this LIST.

If I ask, what makes me feel welcome here, what's my
qualification being here (apart from the gender
and de-lurker invitations, which are lovely and
help), I'd say it's cos I'm interested in intellectual
discussion, specifically langpo-type speculations.
This of course means I like the company, very much,
even if I don't know the quality of your social or other
lives.  Right now, don't care.

So, it's a kind of community - I mean, there are
commonnesses operating huh, of interests, of reading,
of a pleasure in theorizing. Of stimulation and the
pleasure - yeah maybe power too - of expression.

Poetry and its theorizing I think don't have social
or political or what have you functions.  Maybe the sense
of responsibility
comes from the feeling that we owe our patrons, now
that our patrons/the market are in good part the
state, hence society.

I mean, it's opportunity and proclivity that connects
us. What are the personal costs agains the pleasure of
being on the LIST - does it come down to being a
university-sponsored, mail- (oops, male-) dominated
thing.

The loop that leads back from such theory to its
sponsoring society must necessarily get mediated beyond
recognition,
it's dishonest to claim responsibility for ourselves.
At most, such responsibility is an indirect thng.

Now maybe it's the processes of mediation running too & from
langpo and its theorizers, job appointments, books
published, conferences, earnings, what have you.  But
theory has to do with what it theorizes, in this case
literary stuff (&itself).

It seems to me typically literature doesn't do well
patronizing the patron.


By the way, Tony, with the place you give sound/voice in
poems where do you leave someone who just happens not to
have heard poetry aloud, or a deaf someone.  I can't
see the disadvantage.
Surely one sensitivity being blocked serves well to
open others?

(oops just sent off the wrong post, bloody unix
system, sent this one friday w/o success, here goes again..)

Hi Alan, Wystan, Tony (especially)..

Got to say I feel supportive of Alan's Stafford
rebuttal - same time can I push at the side of
it rather than just forming a scrum with you guys.

I'd like to speak as a friend and someone with aligned
writing intersts.

I'm uncomfortable with indignation as a form of
literary address.  I think it already assumes a mandate
and is too affordable. It knows better than what it
addresses.  I can't see the writers involved haven't fully
adequate resources available. Alan, Wystan, Michele, Murray, Tony, Roger,
Alex, all teach at AUckland University.  All have
texts published, most by reputable publishers.  AUP recently
published Michele, Murray, Alan. All the writers
above have been involved in editing NZ literary
magazines - Parallax, And, Splash. I've seen good
serious reviews of all writers. I reviewed Alan I
think appreciatively in Landfall. You guys - we
guys - have surely been given some chances and taken
many more.

Marginalism is as much self-induced as conferred,
surely. How do Wystan's demolition job on modernism
(in Parallax) and Alan's on CK Stead (in Island)
differ from any other attempt to get the high ground?
We've gone harder at discrediting other literary
practices, at least as hard, I think, as they us.

I'm saying these things cause I'm currently writing
on NZ literary practice/s. Also, cause this is something
I've talked/mailed about with Wystan and Alan. Also, cause
I submitted a proposal for public funding in early '93 for
a magazine which involved most of the names above (yes, that
was turned down, and wrongly I believe - another story).

Also, I've been writing poetry in and out of this group
over several years and while I've felt tremendous
personal support it has not been (for me) an endorsement
of my achievement as such. How such endorsements work
is subtle and of course often sensitive.  My books have
been self-published and hand-sold.  They've been read in
public and sometimes reviewed.  A brief postcard I received
from Charles Bernstein after sending him a copy of Itsan
meant maybe more than other responses I got. People
support what they like (and what likes them too, which
is natural), I like my work so who should I ask to
write seriously about it? My sense is, of the people I've
mentioned, maybe Tony has had least mainstream
recognition of his work/s? Would you care to comment
on your experience visavis the mainstream, Tony?

Who's allowed to complain, who's allowed to insist on
being read let alone read a certain way?  I don't think
the values appealed to in the name of poetry have
and superior merit. In fact, the ethical dimension
of writing as it stands is, I believe, illshaped and outdated.
Charles and I both say Alan's a 'terrific' poet: in
our game, how does one weigh the sayer with the said?

So, I support Alan but I don't go with the dialectic
it espouses.  It's too proper an idea of writing and
writing's public for me. I place this response here because
I'm interested in literary practices and want to say
something personal, as a friend and fellow writer,
from Japan, thru a computer based in Buffalo (where?)
across the screens of a no. of Americans and others
(what would hold them to read this far?) to my
mates in Auckland.

a book i'm always ready to recommend: Richard Slotkin's _Regeneration
Through Violence_, on the ambivalent american relationship to nature/
wilderness/"savage", and its expression in AmLit.  also, Annette
Kolodny's _Lay of the Land_, w/ a feminist analysis of some of the
same issues...

Subject:      Wot Dey Doo

        Discussion here has come to an interesting pass--
step back, observe the weave of many threads:

        One set of voices asks what poems/pages/teachers/students/
greetingcards/cowboymovies can/may/should/must do.  Literally:
"what's the use?"  The correct answer to these, taken together, is
"many things: too many to count on the off-hand."
This is a vague answer, thus not very popular in academe.  Too bad.
Many here voice this position, at least by implication, to which
chorus I add my own.  I won't tell poets what to do.  And I have found,
sadly, that academic description all too often turns into prescription.
(I have no such compunction, though, against telling critics what to do
or where to go.)

        But another set of voices, which shares some membership with the
first set, answers according to academic habit by specifying one
or a few possible uses as if those few were the only correct
or worthy ones.  Another, only slightly better way of doing this is to
rank the potential uses on a seemingly vertical scale, high
as opposed to low (and "cultural studies"' bouleversement of that scale
does nothing to remedy the fundamental authority problem inherent
in academic habitude--a rank order turned upside-down is,
as has been observed by others here, still a rank order and still
dependent upon the criteria that ranked the *old* order).

        Walk to the front of a classroom and you walk into a role
in the imaginary drama each student writes for you--that is, ten, twenty,
fifty different roles at once.  You'd better believe you're not always
going to play the good-guy.  Regard yourself as a co-investigator and
soon you'll be sued by students who believe they're paying good
money to have facts force-fed to them; go the opposite way and you're
unjust toward those who would have thriven on co-operation.  Sorry: no
amount of tips can help you totalize this one.  But it's okay.  Some
of my best teachers were my worst ones: the ones who motivated me to
show that bastard a thing or two.  Happens all the time.  You cannot
control the student's reception of your efforts by applying some
particular technique.  You (we) can, however, try to respond openly
and flexibly to the multiplicity of students' wants and needs. (Again
vague, this is as precise a formulation as the problem affords.)

        Political responsibility does not amount to
either going along with or else opposing a cultural hegemony.  It amounts
to exercising one's share of power in group decision-making: far more
of a gray (grey, for you Kiwis) area than the either/or of hegemony theory.
I don't use greeting cards because I would consider it lazy *for me* to do
so, not necessarily for my neighbor.  (I also think Hallmark markets their
product in an unethical way by inventing occasions on which my friends and
relatives will feel hurt if I don't plunk down my couple of bucks on the
right sort of card, but this has nothing to do with the verses per se.)  The
sentiments they express can support, oppose, or take any number of more
complex positions toward "the culture."  Generally the funny ones ironize
our common problems, which can assuage bad faith or spur good faith efforts
to change things; once again, the effect is not and cannot be totally
controlled.  And that's a good thing.

Now that Kato's tesitmony has been interrupted for the day, I want to
respond quickly to a number of disparate postings:

Help?  Bob Kaufman's poem "The American Sun" includes a ref. to "Arthur
Farnsworth Television."  Haven't been able to ID this -- Can anybody tell
me who Arthur Farnsworth is/was?  Maria or any other Kauman readers??

I'd hate to see such a binary opposition as Olson v Cultural Studies gain
currency. Some of you may recall the amusing episode in Olson studies
when his ref. to "Durante" was misread till somebody wrote in to the
Olson journal to point out the obvious, that Olson's ref. was to the
Schnoz himself.  I don't happen to find Hallmark verse engaging myself,
but it is certainly an interesting cultural phenomenon -- And how will we
write those pesky Norton Anthology footnotes if we don't know about this
stuff?

Now, in answer to David MacAleavey (who others on the POETICS line will
not know was one of my dissertation readers long ago).

Will have to give you a fuller reponse elsewhere, as I'm on a machine
that does not belong to me this week (one that makes it nearly impossible
to correct anything!) -- but quickly --
as to point one -- cf, maybe "Can the Subaltern Speak" and _What Comes
After The Subject_ --
as to the other points (don't have the posting [or posstage] in front of
me] -- Well, yes, I will admit to hyperbole (this will hardly surprise
you) -- but I suspect that the rationale you mention for the change in
reading schedules at the Library of Congress, that people could attend on
their way home from work, is the sort of thing that seems sensible to a
group of people meeting on the Hill before going home to the suburbs.  I
am prepared to find that I am horribly wrong about that -- I imagine that
rationale might hold true for the early shift at the Government Printing
Office, but I doubt that this move has demonstrably increased the
participation of DC residents in the series.  And no, there's nothing
particularly horrific in Rita Dove's decision to live at home in C'Ville
with her family & near her tenured position -- Things are a bit different
(though still not horrific) when the poet lives, say, in a noncontiguous
state & makes a point of repeating slighting remarks about the local
literary culture to the national press.  (For those not familiar with the
odd history of such things, one quickly learns not to make predictions
about the matter based on the published verse.  William Meredith (who
comes in for brutal treatment in an Olson poem) was one of the LOC Poetry
Consultants most supportive of area poets.

& No, I see no reason for us to have a Poet Laureate either,,, but I see
that as no bar to my interpreting the remarks of  Brodsky, Strand and a
few others as somewhat shortsighted --  This is in the nature of a
symptomatic reading -- We can judge Professor Newt by his first
appointment of a House historian, and I think we can derive lessons about
governmental attitudes towards the literary arts from the history of the
LOC --

anyway, as the unmatched parentheses above confirm, I can't backtrack on
this compture to correct anything, and so will speak more directly of
these things in person -- will be there in June!  Good to hear from you
after all these years.

Now, my additions to our group reading lists:
_Dictee_  by Theresa Hak-Kyung Cha -- just reissued by 3d Woman Press &
available through SPD -- this one is a must!

& from the land of the still out of print --
_Dunford's Travels Everywhere_ by William Melvin Kelley -- a real
surprise -- check your local university library for a copy.

Lastly, I don't know why the list of participants was expanded without
comment, but I will confess to having added myself to the list without
comment -- Sorry -- I don't know what came over me --

Subject:      The List Itself

Sandra Braman asks about any increase in the number of people on this list.
As of today, there are 200 subscribers to Poetics.  So, yes, the list grows by
a few people every week.
      The policy on new subscribers has remained the same all along, and there
are no plans to change it: the list is private, but anyone who finds out about
it (usually through another list member but also through discovering the list
by browsing EPC) is free to subscribe.  I continue to see the advantage of
keeping the list to a smallish scale, but then I don't know what smallish
means in an environment as big as the internet.  (In a talk on Friday, at UB's
conference on the internet and related issues, Loss Glazier quoted some
remarkable statistics on the day by day growth of the internet; perhaps he
will post those here.)
      The paradox is that in an attempt to be open and nonexcluding one can
end up excluding those who are unable to handle the volume: people are drowned
out rather than kept out -- until Dreamworks Interactive, Inc., guides us and
we asphyxiate.
      If people on the list have thoughts about this, please let me\us know.

**

A reminder that if your server is down or your "disk quota" is exceeded you
may find yourself automatically unsubbed from Poetics; should this happen,
just resubscribe yourself.
      Some subscribers have changed their user IDs, often from initials or
numerals to full names; the listserv program evidently can't recognize the old
and new addresses as the same and this may cause difficulties in setting
options, unsubscribing, and posting.  If you do change your ID, unsub with the
old and resub with the new (?!).
      If you want to temporarily stop getting Poetics mail it may be easier to
send a message to listserv@ubvm.cc.buffalo.edu: set poetics nomail    & later:
set poetics mail    than unsubbing and resubbing.
      If you get the Digest: if possible, try to send any replies to the list
without using the "reply" function so that you can write in a specific subject
head; otherwise the subject reads "Digest".
      On my vax system, the only information I have about a message from the
directory is that it is from Poetics, the date, and the subject; other
systems, as I understand it, give more or different information.
      There is some snare in the "automated" archiving of Poetics files, so
that we don't have monthly compilations for the last three months.  I have
requested that this be fixed and hope it soon will be.

**
Once again, let me encourage those of you out there who edit magazines or
publish books to send information to the list on new publications as well as
complete backlists.  Also welcome: information on new and recent books and
publications by list participants (I have been tempted to put together a
recommended reading list just of recent books and publications by people on
this list, many of which have not been cited here, but the job is too
extensive for me just now.)

I was obliged
by your baked beans.
They measured out
to ten tumbleweeds.  You
also bought new fangled
bedrolls and employed them
against the coyote sounds
of the night.  I called you
my little insulite pad.


The prairie gives off long
when we roam.  You built
a fire to warm our socks.
Grateful night critters
blinked at the shadows.
The buttes got mangy.


Your horse sense
kept you away from
the strip mining
contracts.  You got
nuggets in the pan
at Trinity Center.
The mountain folk
didn't no ways
stand you off.
Your pockets
were full
of gold.



Barkeep, take my gun
for safekeeping.
I wish to bathe
the trained longing
of my whipper snapper.


I played with the fur
trappers while you
were on the trail.
I struck it up
with one of the lonely
girls from Abilene.
She spoke highly
of your playing habits.



I want to crouch around
your merry mack.
Zoom Zoom
says the rider.


My strums are for you,
saloon girl.  Fanciful
flouncing is your game.
I reckon only your
bosom is level headed.
Give me a kiss
before high noon.


The cook returns
the ladle to the chuck
wagon.  O friendly
ground, tonight you'll
substitute for my lover.


The gray puffy clouds
roll in the afternoon.
We don't yield as much
to the gracious outline
of the sun.  I've seen you
holding the rifles.  You
learned about animal sex
from hunting.  You can
empty shells.



Our horses break
the sod.  Buzzards
circle the roundup.
I wear a Stetson
in Kansas City
to impress you.
This is how I go
about courting.


The paper fan
delivers sweet air
to the back of your neck,
my angel.  Your cowboy
wings fan the drafts
of the Southwest.  I
present to you my
newly-oiled chamber.
Are you ready for
the back country
of my love.



You continuously build
such campfires.  And you
announce your greed.  I am
 all tied up by your silks.
The big night pretends
to put it out.


You wear a leather mantle
against the dust.  You make
coffee in the morning.
You make the range
a reflection in your
golden spurs.  Please draw
that six and squeeze me
off a few rounds.


You can leave
your chaps on,
partner.  But that
gunbelt is in the way.
The rifleman
is a strong emotion.



We left shotgun
pellets behind us.
We left groves
of trees wondering.
We left coyotes
trying to join
our love yelps.
You old horny toad,
wait till after
I cook up the rabbit
on a spit.


To stay up with the moon
and you and tequila.  I kept
feeding the fire.
The corona broke
and we saw the sage.
You said you saw
everything.  Wolves
were howling.



Remember the buffalo
bread you baked?  I've
never met a better baker.
You sure can shoot, too
and throw a steer
on its side at the rodeo.



We needed to water
the horses.  You sniffed
it out.  The leaves
stroked the water
in its hidden places.
The animals drank.



The creatures don't protest
our take over of this spot.
Not if we deal them in,
the cicadas, the prairie
skeeters and the vast
distance of it all.



My bedroll is wet
with morning dew.
I must find my breakfast.
Nuts and berries are
plentiful, but the brush
is rustling with
animal sound.


I started cooking
over the fire.  I put
in a few irons too.
I may do some
touch-up branding
of your rustled cattle.


Sing me a song about the range,
my love.  I've heard a few
sad ones about the Big Valley
and the Grand Canyon.
Please, seduce me again
with your sad songs.



You panned for gold
in Placerville.  Do you
still have that burning
pain?  I know what
happened in the mining
accident wasn't my fault.
I turned on the high-
pressure hose out of love.



I would be careful
of that branding iron
if I were you, in your 501s
and sheepskin collar
jean jacket.  The irons
are hot now.  They'll
be blackened any minute.


The marks of your territory
stand guard against the squatters.
Everyday hands are mending
your fences.  I don't mind
the barbs.  I'm your ranch
hand.  I do the job
with pride.



The rushing river ends
up slow and brown
in the prairie.  I am
completely in love
with your profile
against the mountains.
Your head moves up
and down with the horse.



Last night I ate mushrooms
in honor of the time
we tripped over the range.
I stepped in a cow patty
that reminded me of your hat.
Diamondbacks were
hanging from the scrub.
You dowsed the earth
and made the heavens roll.

Sandra, here's some Olson for you t'make you feel better:

"...unlike India, the soil, here, is most shallow, a few inches, & only
occasionally, in drift pockets, 6 inches or more. So the struggle of the
roots is intense. But a long time ago the boys beat it this way. It's
grass that is the big enemy of maize, the only real one, for they burn
off the bush, before they plant. But grass keeps coming in. And in the
old days, they were able to stand it off - for as long as seven years
(the maximum life of milpa) - by weeding out the grass by *hand*. But
then came the machete. And with it, the victory of grass in *two* years.
For ever since that iron, the natives cut the grass, and thus, without
having thought about it, spread the weed-seed, so that the whole milpa is
choked, quickly choked, and gone, forever, for use for, maize (grass is
so tough it doesn't even let brush or forest grow again!)

"One curious corallary, that, the Communist future of this peninsula will
have to reackon [sic] with: that, the ground is such, and its topography
so humped & rocked, that, still, the ancient method of planting - with a
pointed stick, and sowing, with the hands - is far superior to any
tractor or planter or whatever."

(_Mayan Letters_)

So odd, I think, someone (not you, Sandra) complaining weeks ago about this
list "degenerating" to discussions re: "crop rotation." Discussion of crops
not beneath Olson; why so beneath his readers?

Felt similarly w/respect to your "high" vrs. "low" culture
complaint/post. Were "sports" beneath Pindar? Tenth century Japanese
"correct" vs. "noncorrect" behavior (read: "gossip"--& her pillow book's
filled w/it) beneath Sei Shonagon? Whaling beneath Melville? Sappho,
Catullus..."vulgar"? _I Remember_ and _My Life_ wonderful because about
things seen in the Louvre? How much "high" art is, in fact, excusively
*about* "high" art? Even Joyce wrote lovely little bits about farting.
(The topic for two solid weeks on an e-space list devoted to Joyce.)

I love Olson, Sandra, but've found the discussions on this list re:
Hallmark much more interesting than the solemn "Achievement of Olson"-
acknowledgments here a week or so ago. Just 'cause Olson's name's dragged
into the discussion doesn't mean the talk's gonna be all that lively or
informative.

I know of no interesting writing that hasn't, specifically, addressed the
civilization in which the writing was done. TV & Hallmark (or
Hallmark-equivalent) are part of contemporary civilization. Seems natural
they come up as topics of discussion here.

Thank you your poem expressed the exact elements of the "Wild West" that
I was discussing.  I don't want to be mis interpreted, I do like westerns
and even more I adore horses.  I'm just interested in how the Mythical
cowboy has emerged once again in the decade of the politically correct.
Not that I want to discuss that nightmare.
        I just finished Cormac McCarthy's "All the Pretty Horses" and was
puzzled by its mass appeal.  I found it varying and inconsistent in
content and style.  I was equally swept away and disappointed.
        The langauge of the west is poetic as it combines old world
English with New world experience, but being a history major I feel it
takes far more than a few catch phrases to represent an era.  Historical
the representation of the western is very problematic.  There are
sensitive issues or race, sex,  religion and properity ownership to be
addressed.  The western of the 50's and 60's never bothered to address
these concerns and that is what has become the stereo type of the
perception of the west.
        Ondaatje has written a excellent docupoem about Billy the Kid,
but it content it reinforces the mythology of the Wild West.  I'm not
sure if this is good, bad, or accurate but it concerns me.  Possibly this
is because I've been reading Ovid, Tacitus and Virgil, and I've been
wondering how much of their poetry, histories and accounts are actual
history or gossip or poetic mythology.
        I spoke once with George Bowering and he told me of a discussion
he had with Ondaatje about writing a western without all the "Hoo-ha".
Ondaatje replied writing a western without the "hoo-ha" would be total
hoo-ha.  If this is possible then does that mean the stereotypes are so
ingrained in the genre that to remove them would create something
entirely different?

Dear Sandra:
     Yes, we're definitely in agreement. Great of you to yell bullshit,
when most'd only think it, in a crowded room. Reminds me of an anecdote a
poet in Hoboken, NJ, Joel Lewis, told me. He was teaching a poetry class
(at the Y, I think) and relating an anecdote to his students about the
first time he'd seen Sapphire read (or was it lecture?). Sapphire'd
started in on some apparently anti-Semitic spiel, and a woman in the
audience stood up and started yelling as loudly as she could, no one could
figure out what she was saying, just standing there yelling at the top of
her lungs. Well, as Joel's relating this anecdote to his class, he notices
one woman growing more & more uncomfortable, wanting to say something, and
finally she blurts out: "I *was* that woman!" She goes on to explain to
Joel & the class that she had been so horrified by what Sapphire'd been
saying, she'd had to drown it out, but couldn't think of anything to say,
so she just "lost it,"  stood up and began shouting SENTENCE FRAGMENTS off
the top of her head to block out the offensive spiel coming from the
stage.
     But, back to the point. Yes, no one should be laughed at for
preferring wonderful poetry to drivel. I haven't been in a university for
10 years, so don't know what the climate's like, but it's true enough that
poets are often seen, when seen at all at large, as clowns. There's a
wonderful bit in _The Sullen Art_, I think the interview with Rexroth,
where Rexroth's complaining about how Ginsberg (this is early 60s) plays
into this, by giving magazines like _Time_ ample opportunity to cast him
(&, I guess, other living poets, by association) in the role of village
idiot.  (Having just seen his performance yesterday in _Poetry in Motion_,
I've no problem following Rexroth's logic. Ginsberg's no moron, but man
can he play one on TV.) Do you know Gerald Burns's book, _Shorter Poems_?
Gerald's on the cover, in clown make-up & bowler-- he wrote me about it
once: "Writers are not just ignored. We are laughed at. We're a joke, wear
big shoes and red noses."
     But, given that this is an e-space of POETICS, I don't think you need
at all be worried about being laughed out for your "elitist" preferences.
I'd *hope* not, anyway. Beleaguered on occasion, maybe, & if I've
contributed to that, I'm sorry. The only reason I responded to your post
as I did was because I'm by nature admittedly paranoid, get a little
spooked when people mention anything smacking of "list management." That
probably wasn't even on your mind, & in any case, want to apologize for
overreacting.
     Anyway, Sandra, no big whoop, & best w/your article. (You'll post it
when you're through, yes?)
     Yours,
     Gary

Surely, Lindz, you know George Bowering's fabulous CAPRICE, a novel in
which all the stereotypes of the West are turned on their heads, and of
course Ed Dorn's SLINGER, the epic poem upon which some of us were
raised and that does the West the way the West was meant to be done....
And then, if I may, I would recommend Douglas Woolf's WALL TO WALL, a
novel which  depicts the West as it really was/is....

Dear Gary,
          Re-Poetry in Motion and Ginsberg being no moron but playing one on
TV. I didn't read it that way. I thought he was great. And THAT suggests
something of what's involved  in moving across borders between 'high' and
'low'. It's one thing to have the attitude...its another thing to do the
hi-lo shuffle. (there was a singing group called the Hi-Los once) It's  a
good while since I last heard AG perform, but over the years I have greatly
admired his risk-taking. Again and again he would prove that someone who
won't be embarassed doesn't embarass. A deep confidence that will prove
itself. I don't know how long that sort of thing can sustain itself nor what
exactly are the conditions which enables to be achieved. Let's imagine a
reading of Hallmark verse, what would that be like?

Dear Lindz:

Just caught your latest post after getting back from a matinee of *The
Wild Bunch* after rereading C. McCarthy's *Blood Meridian*. I guess I
think it's just too simplistic to speak of some singular "western" of
the ninties (as it is  to speak of this as "the politcally correct
decade"--somehow I don't think that's Newt's agenda). It was wild
seeing Bill Holden and the bunch again all these bloody years later,
and the ways in which the movie (which seemed so outrageous 25 years
ago) is so deeply infused with the romance of 60's "outlaw politics"--
(this on the day after the EU accused Canada of Wild West politics and
piratery off the grand banks--yahoooo, get out yer wire cutters, Bri,
ain't nobody nettin' us in--the iconographic problem here being, are
we the ranchers or the sheepherders?).

Compare it with McCarthy's *Blood Meridian* (which is much less
sentimental than *Horses*) or for that matter Eastwood's *The
Unforgiven* and you begin to approach the complexity of the issues
here. I don't think it's ever been a question of simply deploying
"stereotypes" (for the ultimate of that cynicism, see F. Gump).
Compare, for instance, *Wyatt Earp* with *Tombstone* which came out
within six months of each other, and which treat all the mythologems
of the Earp myth differently (especially the famous shootout story
where the Earp gang gets pinned down by the Clantons at the river and
Wyatt gets up and walks into a hail of bullets blasting away
unscathed. *Tombstone* has it as a kind of divine intervention, where
Kevin, to give him his due, portrays it as a kind of mindless,
desperate luck--but now we're into *Pulp Fiction*). Which is the
"nineties" version?

Anyway, all this by way of saying, yeah, yahoo, but whose yahoo, and
yahoo how?

Best,
Mike

Also, back to another post I made that never got out, Darrell Gray
worked for Hallmark in the late 60s or early 70s, right after MFA
school, and gave me the impression that some of the other Iowa City
grads did likewise. When I was in KC two years ago, I stayed at the
hotel right next to the big mall that Hallmark "sponsors," and noted
that their corporate tagline read:

"Hallmark, America's largest producer of greet cards and social
expression products."

Productizing social expression does seem to be what it's all about.

I'd also recommend Dorn's Captain Jack's Chaps, or HOUSTON/MLA, which
brings the West into the contemporary Modern Language Association
context, Hyattexture, and more. Also bp Nichol's version of billy the kid
, THE TRUE EVENTUAL STORY OF BILLY THE KID, in Nichol's CRAFT DINNER (Aya
Press, 1978), is marvelous.

I agree to dismantle the stereo type the genre is too simplistic, but
what I think I'm hung up on is the aspect that this medium is full of
myth that a lot of people take as the truth. ( Out of 1000 Americans
polled around 49% thought F Gump was a documentary, but after the Oscars
last night I will now go into convulsions if I hear one more Gump quote)
        I suppose part of the building of the west was a dream, the last
frontier and all that but it makes me wonder about how I am represented
by this.  My father grew up along the Oregon trail, living on
reservations as his step father built the rail line.  The way he
describes it there was no romance to this lifestyle.  He spent lonely
summers in the hills cooking for the sheep herders and to this day he
will not ride a horse again.  This was no Wyatt Earp world.  My ancestors
hailed from Norway and Scotland settling in Utah to do the homestead
thing and then pushed on to Central Oregon.  What I would give to know
how they lived.  Looks like I have a western of my own to write.

        And for my recommended reading list Howard O'Hagon's *Tay John*.
This novel is epic tale of Western myth. However, it has been critiqued
for slight misogynist undertones, but personally I haven't found one that
doesn't find women contemptable.

I agree with Sandra that there are most definately examples of
contemporary gunsmoke engaged in a shootout with the genre.  In
fact, I wuld go so far as to say that the genre is becoming the
story in works like CAPRICE and SLINGER.  I suppose its the differnce
between writing about the wild west and The Wild West.  Lindz,
you might also want to take a look at Nichol, Spicer and
McClure's *Billy the Kid*s.  Ah yes, "Billy had a short dick
but they did not call him Richard".  You card.

Dear Sandra & Wystan:
     Sandra, in your original post you'd mentioned an editor asking you &
others to write about something "forbidden," and you'd mentioned possibly
writing about the intolerance of elitism. That's the article I'd meant.
Would love to read it if you do it.
     Wystan, I like what you say about Ginsberg's proving time & again
that someone who won't be embarrassed doesn't embarrass--I think that's
accurate w/respect to his intentions, and I think in some cases he even
proved as much; though, I do wonder how much of that gets used as an
excuse to sluff off responsibility. I guess I know one too many younger
poets he's aggressively hit on, casting-couch style, to give the guy
complete benefit of the doubt w/respect to his "good" intentions.
     W/respect to his performing his "rock music" as "risk taking"--no
difference between that & the first-time open-mike-nighter, up there
reading the first thing s/he's scrawled to paper. Nothing wrong with it,
but can't help but think that if it were anyone but Ginsberg up there
being that incompetent, no one'd give him the time of day. My idea of
risk-taking involves something more than exercising one's "star power" (a
great song by Sonic Youth, btw) and, while I do have a lot of respect for
Ginsberg as a poet, I guess I don't see the value in everything he does,
myself. Would never ask (or even want) him to "stop the madness" so to
speak, but reserve the right to hit the VCR's "mute" button & put on
(say) something by the Hi-Los when he gets tedious. Or to question
anyone's "Just Do It" approach when it involves (say) sexual harassment.
     Yours,
     Gary

libraries have received authority from the US Dept. of Educ. via OCLC

Subject:      mainstream avoidance?

Dear John Geraets,
         That question might well be private, but you've asked me on
this list, how I've fared with the mainstream :  so briefly, I have not been anthologised in NZ (Michael
Morrisey asked me for a piece of fiction, I sd no; nobody else has
asked me).  Three little books were published offset from my old
Sharp electronic typewriter (a machine that was subsequently  near
demolished by my kids).  "Software" was published by Splash, but I
was an editor and typed it, photo-copied  and  designed cover from my
own photos.  Distribution of the first three was by hand, knocking on
doors and sales at readings.  Software went thru the Splash
distribution list, assisted by Segue.  Most sales "by hand" or
exchanges.  One piece in "Landfall" only because Michele Leggott edited
a special number.  The "her axolotl" poem (20 years ago went
where?....)in a magazine.   Graham Lindsay gave me space in Morepork,
Alan Loney in Parallax, , otherwise that's about it.

I never wanted,don't particularly want, a literary career.

The record for art history is about the same.  I edited the Bulletin
of New Zealand Art History (with Michael Dunn) for about nine years)
and when there was a shortage of copy I wrote more to fill it.
The two little Poussin books are in photocopy, A5, off my typewriter,
but in the NZ General Assembly for copyright purposes.
 These were distributed as gifts mostly, or sold to students by the
department of art history for  $1 each, cost.

What I have had printed in quantity here is art criticism and art
journalism and essays for catalogues.  That's pleasant enough, and
what the Mainstream thinks I'm useful for.

John Byrum, in Ohio, was hospitable and included pieces in Generator
I and 2.  That was through the friendship of Tom Beckett  (who
introduced me to the extraordinary work of Frank Fecko, and later to
Frank, when I visited him in 1987 0r 8).  I have done very little
about trying to publish poems etc otherwise.  And I don't work at
writing poetry that much anyway.

I have always though my most interesting relation with text is in the
classroom esp in seminars.

U.S. readers of this all know by now where the delete button
is....but that is about right for the info you asked for.

Best,

Oh, you're roping me into territory I'm not responding to directly.  I
was just taking issue with . . . --god, what was it?--a characterization
of teaching as being simply about earning money or some other equally
vulgar end (as necessary and nice as earning cash for our labor in that
underpaid enterprise is).  And now that I think about it perhaps what the
real problem is is people who continually try to divorce politics and the
classroom and, even poetry from politics (now that you've lured me here),
because that seems to me to "aestheticize" aesthetics to the point of
triviality that simply reinforces the marginality of the arts to culture
and society so that not only are they not studied but continue to fall
away from any sense of having to do with people's lives.  Separating the
areas of life you suggest is the problem.  It only reinforces the view
that art is art and has nothing to do with anything else.  If there were
a pernicious "political" view it is this.

I hope you don't mind me posting this to the list . . .

   These cantos chicanos begin with X and end with X. They are examples
of xicano verse, verse marked with the cross, the border cross of alambre
and rio, the cross of Jesus X in Native America, tha nahuatl X in mexico,
mexicano, xicano. It is our mark, our cross, our X, our sign of never
ceasing being born at the point of two arrows colliding, X, and at the
gentle laying of one line over another line, X. It is the sound we make
to mark one and other. August 29, familia, raza, as well as to exclude
ourselves from the patterns of death imposed from without.  We sign the X
each time we speak we cross at least one border. And because it is our
sign andamos cruzando cruzados, naciendo siendo xicanos otra vex, cada
vez, esta vez. I am the point of my own X but the arms, los brazos vienen
de lejos, and the arms reach far.

Blair stated

        "Political statements can be poetry or propaganda or both.
Propoganda can be the truth in a political context. But if it is poetry,
the residue that is left will be regarded more for its aesthetic content
than its political. Because politics has a way of being current and art
has a way of being eternal or out of time."


I dont believe that I can agree that art or poetry  is out of time or
eternal. True western culture worships the written word enough to
transcribe and save texts, yet so much is lost too.  I love the phrases
and glips of poetry left behind by Sappho, but I do not know her true
intention in writing unless I study the time in which she has written
these verses.  Her words have lasted time, but has her context?
        In English lit we are blessed with an abundance of writers that
annoy and study each other so it is easier to preserve the implied
connotations or the motive of the writing.  In that sense politics of the
era, the social mood are essential to eternalizing the "art".  Words are
words and only become poetry when they have meaning.  Cultural aesthetics
are needed to appreciate and render something into art, but these are not
eternal and definitely not universal.

Subject:      Arthur Godfrey, Allen Ginsberg
X-cc:         rsillima@vanstar.com

The Arthur Godfrey suggestion (re Kaufman & Farnsworth) is interesting.
It set off some loose associations...

I was surprised at how thoroughly Godfrey in particular and his
generation of music in general dominated Ted Berrigan's 1959 record
collection (see appendix to Padgett's wonderful _Ted_) and how much rock
and its various protoancestors were NOT represented there. It made me
wonder about musical influences on the poetry. I've heard both Bernstein
and Watten wax quite eloquent on the subject of the influence of Bob
Dylan on their work. Me too. Meeting Dylan at Newport in '64 was once
the highpoint of my life.

And certainly several members of my G1 generation have fantasized
themselves as rock stars at one time or another, ranging from the
successful (Patti Smith, Jim Carroll, Laurie Anderson) to the whistfully
silly (Serpent Power w/ Coolidge & Meltzer). Burroughs collaborating w/
Anderson does seem to show what's possible. And lets not forget the
Fugs.

Ginsberg on the harmonium reminds me simultaneously of Bly and his idiot
dulcimer, but also of the peculiar problematics of being Allen Ginsberg
as well (if I were feeling more generous, I might imagine that Bly faces
similar issues). Ginsberg is perpetually confronted with reading to
large audiences that have very little knowledge of his genre, his
generation, his anything. His performance works of the past 15 years or
so seem to me to address precisely that conundrum. They don't work on
the page at all, but they aren't really intended to. The Don't Smoke
piece (don't even know if this is in print) is a terrific piece of
theater, which is really what it is.

On the other hand, Ginsberg is at heart a satirist (this he shares w/
Bernstein & perhaps Perelman also) rather than an epic poet, say, or a
lyric one. I've been struck in the past 6 months how much the
performance model for both Ginsberg & Bernstein seems to be, say, Lenny
Bruce (or George Carlin or Andy Kaufman or Lord Buckley) rather than
who? Dylan Thomas? Paul Blackburn? The model seems to propose very
difference functions for a text in the setting of performance.

McClure once told me that his generation "missed the boat" when it
failed to convince the 60s rockers (thinking, I think, explicitly of the
Grateful Dead & the Doors) that they needed to get their lyrics from the
poets. All those royalties....

On the other hand, Robert Hunter (who IS the Dead's chief dramaturg) has
been a very sympathetic reader of many people on this list & has read in
public with the likes of Palmer, Hejinian, Watten, Harryman & Yrs truly.

Go figure.

no, it's not art for art's sake, but a question, literally, of what comes first.no one these days could argue, i trust, that aesthetics are sufficient, but one might argue that the poem is such insofar as it fulfills its own necessities.

Hi Loss, yes I'm very interested in this. Can I be naive and ask how do I
get involved  -  I'd be keen to do two things, and they might require
completely different approaches.

1. To submit a kind of selected of my own work for an author site, would
include visual work, text work and sound work  -  sometimes all three
interlinked versions under the same title.

2. To have some old chaps both by myself and others I've published  -
Allen Fisher, P.C.Fencott, Chris Mason and others - catalogued.

But you might be confined to U.S. authors or publishers.
Just curious, as always

If you are then in what format would I submit? Who does the formatting?

respect

Sandra, that's a total bummer about the Journal of Communications. But,
if you want to consider writing & publishing such a piece somewhere,
here's an address for you:

EXILE
Curt Anderson, editor
P.O. Box 1840
St. Paul, MN  55101

Curt's always looking for material for this quarterly newsletter-style
journal, & frankly, as I'm the first person he hits up for work when
he (inevitably) finds he needs more material, you'd be doing me a favor
writing something for it. That goes for anyone on this list, by the way.
The magazine's mostly made up of book reviews & satirical pieces, but
Curt wants to publish more "serious" things if he can.

Anyone interested in seeing an issue of the thing can write to the
address above, or e-mail me w/your snail-mail (I've got a few extra
copies of the last issue sitting around.) Subscriptions are $2.50 for 4
issues, or the equivalent in stamps.

Also, if anyone'd like their books or MANUSCRIPTS reviewed, send 'em to
the same address above. (Curt's especially looking for manuscripts to
review.)

Yours,

Gary

Subject:      Ginsberg, Sorrentino

Returned to my copy of _The Sullen Art_ to check who'd said what about
Ginsberg & discovered it wasn't Rexroth but Gilbert Sorrentino who'd been
talking about him. Here's the quote for anyone interested:
     "Allen has always annoyed me because, of all that group of so-called
Beat poets, his is an outstanding intelligence, and it constantly annoys
me that he allows himself to be used. Certainly not used by other poets,
but by the people who have always hated poetry--the vested interests, the
commercialists, the buyers and sellers. Ginsberg can talk for an hour
about how he loathes _Life_, _Time_, _Fortune_, money, banking, and _Life_
and _Time_ will spread-eagle him on the wall with his own words. His words
don't have the power to destroy _Life_ and _Time_. That's why he gets so
much space in them and one of the reasons he is so used by them. He's not
an enemy of _Life_ and _Time_--he *is* an enemy in his own heart, as every
poet must be--but they're not afraid of him and they make the fool of him.
     "It's very peculiar. It's a reversion to Romanticism. It's the
Romantic scream against the watered-down principles of Locke, which
controlled the 19th century. As the Romantics screamed against Locke, they
made Locke righter. The more they said 'Down With Locke,' in so many
different ways: 'I fall upon the thorns of life, I bleed,' et cetera, the
more they continually made Locke seem right. Locke was wrong. But they
didn't prove it so.  He said, or was taken to have said, when his
philosophy was watered down a hundred years later, as philosophies always
are for the people, 'Poetry is junk--evanescent, something to curl up with
on a winter's evening. It has nothing to do with life.' The old cry of the
businessman. So the Romantics said, 'That's right, Locke, you bet it is.'
And they just kept screaming about the wild blue yonder. It wasn't until
the 19th century Frenchmen that poetry once again became what it
is--something having to do directly with life, something that can be used
to control your life, something that can be used to make your life a
better thing. They got back to the concrete, they got back to the world
that Locke accused them of rejecting."
     Don't know how much I agree w/the above, especially as I was born
after the interview took place so don't know what, specifically, was going
on re: _Life_ and _Time_ and Ginsberg's words being "used against him."
Would welcome elaboration or repudiation of what Sorrentino says by anyone
who was there at the time.
     Yours,
     Gary

Ron and others,

I'm enjoying this thread immensely. And I think Don't Smoke -- the real
name is "Put Down Yr Cigarette Rag" -- is superb. I believe it's a great
way to introduce Ginsberg to students, bringing in political concerns and
improv/open field type ideas at once. Even the frat boys in their
baseball caps look impressed...
        The text is printed in _First Blues_ (Full Court Press, 1975).
I haven't sprung for the CD box set yet, but I do know you can get the
performance on cassette from the Smithsonian's Folkways series. Call
(202) 287-3262 to order or for free Folkways catalog.

Pardners,
Don't forget Clear the Range, a western novel by Ted Berrigan,
written using the cross-out method on a dime paperback.
It's hilarious, stately, and strange. Like Bill Luoma's campfire
songs, it says something about formality, loneliness, and wide
open space, key elements of the western ethos. Berrigan also
speaks often of The Code of the West in his Sonnets.

For a contemporary working out of neighboring thematics,
check out Merrill Gilfillan's Sworn Before Cranes (Faber &
Faber1994). It's a beautiful book of short stories set on
the High Plains mostly among Indian people the author has
known or visited.

See you round the ridges,
Kit Robinson

I too feel a kind of personal stake in both the mythicizing (word?) and
de-mythicizing of the American west. Up 'till my great grandmother died
a few years ago, I heard much of the journey west, but more of what
happened once they settled in the California desert.
     What's interesting for me is that most of these stories fit
fairly comfortable within the myth. Hardship overcome and all that.
But there have always been disturbing hints of things that might not
fit, at least to my family. Hints about family being hung somewhere, a
picture of an old man dated 1878 with something scrawled on the back
that may be "almost hung," plus a lot of hints about major drinking
problems.
     Further and most disturbing to my grandmother, were thehints of
racial mixing. Before GG died, she used to tell stories about being
ostracized in her community. When my mother asked why she replied that
she was Indian, but          no one else in the family talks about this,
and most of us are blonde and blue eyed. Also, once when I showed my
great uncle a picture of my great great grandmother, his mother, he
chuckled and said (please excuse the language but I am only quoting)
"nigger in the wood pile."Hints betray both attitude and uncertainty.
     My point isthat I think there is a reason for a lot of this mythmaking,
a lot of the tall tales, and that is to disguise. Disguise  exactly what is
not the myth: the crimes, the banality. The everyday nature of the murder
of native Americans and Chinese, and Mexican Americans, certainly in CA,
where it was probably the worst in the country.In my family, the myth
certainly had this function.Diguise  that the West is still a secret.
     Two books I would recommend :Richard Drinnon's _Facing West:The
Metaphysics of Indian-Hating and Empire Building_(Meridian, 1980) and
Lillian Schlissel _Women's Diaries of the Westward Journey_ (Schocken,
1992) Drinnon's seems a little obvious now, but still interesting,
the Diaries are incredible.
Thanks, Eric.

Absolutely Tony. Basically all I was saying is that indoctrination is
"gross." But I like what you've done with this kind of triadic structure
of the classroom (at least as I see it). You've got a text, which is
assumed to be known, you've got a teacher which is assumed to be
knowing, and you've got a student which is assumed to be unknowing.
It's basically an analytical situation of the early Freud years (funny
how that works), ie, ucs, analyst, analysand.
     The problem with this in the classroom is that it is static (and
here we are talking about a worst case kind of thing). There seems little
room for interaction, and above all for resistance (of the text of the master
of the student). It's so darn structural! This is what I think we have to
get rid of, perhaps by team teaching, perhaps by more radical methods. It
seems to me that to be a teacher means always to be a student of the
resistance of the text to interpretation and of the student to indoctrination,
and of above of  our own resistances to the fact that we aren't masters of
the material and that the material cannot be mastered.
     Thanks, Eric.

Dear Eric,
         An NZ equivalent cd be the stories of Spanish ancestry going
back to the Spanish Armada of 1588, accounting for dark eyes and
colouring among Anglo-Scottish families.  One woman that I know who
has a  Maori grandmother said that that was the story in her family
for a long time.  My wife's family maintain the same story about
themselves, which leads to, as you say, a kind of interesting
"uncertainty"....

Cris,

I am responding to you via the list since it is an important question.
I have gotten a number of questions personally on this but I do want
to explain this somewhat more.

Basically, I am a poet and writer, etc. but I have worked for years
now in this world of the library. As one might note from my book,
_Small Press: An Annotated Guide_, a lot of my effort has been getting
the "marginal" into routes that facilitate people connecting with what
I would think we might agree are important works.

Here then, the "rub." That is, this is an unprecedented opportunity.
This OCLC project I have mentioned is not only one of the FIRST
efforts at making etexts available through library catalogs - as well
as world-wide interlibrary loan systems - but it is incredible that we
have been able to negotiate the presence of POETRY in this important
project.

I have worked very hard for this and I think this is a historic
moment, we are seeing a possibility for poetry to be made accessible
to many many thousands of people.

OK, more coming further in this post...

1. There are NO restrictions as to nationality, etc. This is not an
"American" thing.

2. I would prefer texts marked up in html but will accept ascii
submissions. I would feel even better if you are committed to
converting the ascii texts to html; I would of course provide advice
and direction.

3. You may conceive of texts - selected, collected, an individual
series - however you wish. This is simply like publishing a chapbook.
It could be any permutation of your complete work as you see suits
your work. (In this regard it is perfect - make your piece and we
present it to the world.)

4. Multimedia formats are NO problem. If you are in this situation I
will work this out with you individually. You will need to use html
though, to present these works. Graphical files must be .gif files.
Sound files must be .au (unix format) though I am working endlessly to
mount a program here that will convert, so that you may submit these
sound files in other formats.

Note: Ken and I ENCOURAGE multimedia gigs. In fact, that is the
strenght of the Internet, no?

5. Yes, you may submit work by other authors as long as you have
permission.

OK - let's make it happen!

All best to all on the list,

Eric,

        Your personal insight was very helpful.  I wish that I had the
living sources to discuss the westwad crawl of my relaives, unfortunatly
all i have is a family tree.  I found a rather intriguing poem in the
Utne Reader regarding American myth and I'd like to share it with everyone
,I hope I'm allowed to do this.

Mourning the dying American female names

In the Altha Diner on the Florida panhandle
a stocky white-haired woman
with a plastic nameplate "Mildred"
gently turns my burger, and I fall into grief.
I remember the long, hot drives to North Carolina
to visit my Aunt Alma, who put up quarts of peaches,
and my grandmother Gladys with her peirced quilts
Many names are almost gone:Gertrude, Myrtle,
agnes, Bernice, Hortense, Edna, Doris, and Hilda.
They were wide women, cotton clothed, early rising.
You had to move your mouth to say their names,
and they meant strength, spear, battle, and victory.
When did women stop being Saxons and Goths?
What frog Fate turned them into Alison, Melissa,
Valerie, Natalie,Adreinne, and Lucinda,
diminshed them to Wendy, Cindy, Suzy, and Vicky?
I look at these young women
and hope they are headed for the presidnecy,
but I fear America has other plans in mind,
that they be no longer at war
but subdued instead in amorphous corporate work,
somebodies assistant, something ina bank,
single parent with word processing skills.
They must have been made French
so they could be cheap foriegn labor.

Is this just limited to US publishers? I've got a handful of out of print

be other small Australian publishers who would be in a similiar position.

Subject:      Re: Who teach?

Eric, assuming in the classroom and out that students know in the
sense of are responsive as teachers are is not difficult to do.  It's
hard to find any evidence for a contrary assumption.      What
students are unlikely to be able to do is locate a "text" (or
"image") within the always ongoing process of
criticism/evaluation/history of that "text".  Cross-referencing opens
the "text" to renewed attention, in which  students are often great
contributors.  Yesterday (anecdote, anecdote.... ) Anna Tam asks why
-- in tutorial after lecture -- the boys (attendants of Flora in a Triumph of Flora have black wings,
what is that on the ground, a head?) and the rest of the group climb
in.  Best thing is I hadn't thought about that (is there an
explanatory text somewhere a la Panofsky?) and the current literature
doesn't cover it, so this opens questions, and Anna is off to try
to make sense of this herself.  (If only I weren't so caught up in other
classes to-day on something else altogether....)     Describing
pictures (for M.A.) students has got around to describing a particular
small brick wall  (prize of $5 for the "best") this week.  The bit I
put in was a reading of Pound's Agassiz story (ABC of Reading)-- the
fish + discussion on last week's descriptions....
         Fine, until someone starts to worry about quantities of
information (communication of messages) in the class.  Isn't that where
the authoritarian structuring of classes has a firm hold; or in the
demands for execution of specified form-filling exercises, with the
expectation of fulfilling discipline norms established in
advance, getting the right answers in one shape or another.
         But just in case I sound smug in any way, let me also say,
woken by thunder and sounds of heavy rain on the roof, I had trouble
getting back to sleep last night, thinking of all the places I'd gone
wrong in yesterday's teaching.
          Got to go and check out the Seven Acts of Mercy: last week
in class I couldn't recite them, apropos Caravaggio's painting.  The
tutorial class concerned is meant to come up with the answer today.
Funnily enough, one of them could do the Seven Dwarfs, and another
did Santa's reindeers, and I could do the Seven Sacraments, but
that's another tale.
                                          Best

Dear Gary,
         I don't know anything about G. hitting on young people and sexual
harassment or any stuff like that. And it seems a ways away from what I was
trying to describe which had to do with performance and audience crossover
(hi-to-lo, lo-to-high). I brought it up because ' be more popular' is easier
said than done, so what are the conditions for doing, and the measures for
success? And actually I looked at the tape again--isn't Bukowski an
embarassment? And Ed Sanders's great, and that Kenward Elmslie!!--and the G.
clip is fine by me, I think he gets it about right. I found Ron Silliman's
comments relevant to the question of conditions. That is, 'popular' means
young in the contexts he has in mind. Gotta go now.
        Wystan.

X-To:         Edward Foster <EFOSTER@vaxc.stevens-tech.edu>

                    Hi Ed, sometimes I wish I had a 3 line limitation.
You didn't get anything back from me because I didn't know how to respond
to your question. Sometime I feel trapped in an e-mail responsibility of my
own darned making. There aren't enough hours in the day and night free to
answer and sort and simply digest all the mail. I wasn't sure whether your
post was a question 'requiring' an answer or a statement couched in
rhetorical terms. And so the issue of response enters this reply right
away. Weasels of worlds!

>responsibility's become "i respond even if you do
>n't ask," which is arrogance, it may be, of teacher, poet, etc. who is (yr
>>sense) responsible.

                    I kind of reversed your approach. That is you asked and
I didn't respond. It does seem difficult to understand how it can possibly
work the other around though. Or am I being typically pedantic? You can see
I'm floundering into trying to make a 'proper' response. To think this
through.

                    I want to ask some questions. In the context of a
listserv such as this (let's take a trial example that 'might' travel  -)
is it ok to say that anything posted to Multiple recipients can be
responded to. It might well be Eric and Maria and Kali and Tony are
discussing a subject but that discussion is posted 'out in the open'. If
you and anybody else wanted to comment under that subject heading or break
into it to ask a question or beg to disagree  -  no problem. Yes? Your
response hasn't been asked for but you made one. You still had the ability
and by responding you kept that ability engaged. Equally your 'response'
might be ignored.

                    Extend that example to conversation. (remember the hit
and miss aspects of communication  -  informational content,
misunderstanding, tone, deliberate misreading, diverse personalised
interpretation, adoptions of persona and many many others . . . call for
submissions) Extend that to education. Current discussions on education
seems focussed onto institutional forms  -  hell! When I left school I set
out to learn something  -  particularly when it came to poetry. Please
don't let this board become a counselling lounge for academics! (sorry
everyone - myself included) Otherwise  - shit I just got deleted!

                    Now one problem lies in many subscribers (and some have
identified themselves as such, including myself) wanting to respond to many
more posts than they in fact 'allow' themselves to do. But that is not a
withholding of the ability to respond, it is if anything a keening of it.
(there's a fun double edge there) And I'm aware this heads back into
discussions re list overload  -  lurker and poster, representation of
diversity of opinion and constituency and so on. And also discussions re -
speed of response (gender / reflection / compositional preference /
one-up/man/ship and so on). This listserv as a visit to The Boffin Shop.

                    Which points up one other feature becoming apparent  -
being the similarity between the public front of the list as a performance
space and the familiarity traits of Improvised music becoming more
etiquette bound and running to 'similar' boundaries in majority cases.
(examine for a moment the mechanics of statement / response / variation /
negation and other) A point raised by Ira a couple of months back and left
on the ground where its nose dropped. Subjects appear to come around in,
albeit buckled, cycles  -  partly as new subscribers jump on. Partly as
variations concur.

                    It still seems to me that this can become still more of
a LIVE space (not as in MOO). Sufficiently subtle and sensitive and robust
as to be able to respond to the varied needs of its subscribers. If this
listserv is an e-mergent community then issues of responsibility should be
discussed.

          Call M-e I-r-r-e-s-p-o-n-s-i-b-l-e

Subject:      To Wystan, more Ginsberg

Dear Wystan:
     I totally, totally appreciate your--& others--going to bat for
Ginsberg; I'm well aware I'm expressing (very) personal taste here, & have
learned a thing or two from what you & others on this list've said about
how they see his work. Maybe "learned..."  is the wrong way to put it:
more accurately, you all've offered different ways of looking at what he
does, different approaches, for which I'm most grateful. "Ginsberg as
Bruce-like satirist,"  for instance, is something I can definitely
appreciate, really adds to my sense of the value of his work. Even of
_Howl_--I've got two different recordings of him reading that: one, an
early recording, he's very nervous, reading quickly, the work sounding, as
read, completely angry & serious; the second a later reading (at Naropa, I
think, late '70s, early '80s), he's more laid-back, allowing the humor to
come through--almost as though these are two different poems! Wonderful,
wonderful to have these, a great reminder for me how easy it is to
"pigeonhole" anything, & how wrong that is.
     G.'s playing the wolf on occasion probably has nothing to do with
what you were saying; it does have something to do with how I was reading
what you were saying, particularly that wonderful line of yours re:
"embarrassment." I read that as including *all* public behavior (G. being
a very public figure), & so included instances wherein my sense of his
freewheeling public behavior would seem to have destructive/harmful
effects. Because I'd read what you'd said earlier as a kind of "Ginsberg
as anti-uptight role-model" endorsement (& I'm in agreement w/you about
that!), that's why I'd brought up these instances. You say you know
nothing about G.'s hitting on young people--well, I happen to know about
that; the guy hit on one of my best friends, & I've heard about similar
experiences w/a number of other younger poets. I can't erase these
instances from my memory; they linger & when people endorse, wholesale,
his freewheeling spirit, these instances serve for me as somewhat
cautionary reminders. "In dreams begin responsibility," as the saying
goes.
     But, geez, I certainly don't mean to dismiss the guy; his work means
a lot to me. &, sure, Bukowski's "writing = taking a dump" on that tape is
a ridiculous cliche', forgettable.  Elmslie's performance had me rolling
on the floor w/laughter--the effect (or one of the effects) he no doubt
wanted. Sanders has a lovely & hilarious bit in his novel _Fame & Love in
New York_ about the need to constantly be *inventing* things, starting new
projects--his "finger" synthesizer, & tie-keyboard being real- world
examples of that. (I never know how "seriously"--at face value, I mean--to
take what he does, his having edited _Fuck You:  A Magazine of the Arts_.)
(A fairly serious journal actually, despite what the title might lead one
to assume.)
     Anyway, I'd never, never write off Ginsberg as a poet or performer,
even though I'm not as interested in everything he does, or am not always
convinced his motivation's pure. I wonder, for instance, at his GAP
khaki's ad--which you may or may not have seen in NZ. (They appeared here
in the States in magazines like _The New Yorker_ and _Interview_.) When
Ginsberg sells his image to corporate interests--when *anyone* does that
(William Burroughs sold his image to Nike shoes for a TV commercial!), I
have to wonder about "motivation." Ginsberg & Burroughs both seem, in
their writing, to be thoroughly "anti-corporate." So, what gives? I was
living in the Haight-Ashbery district in San Francisco when the GAP opened
one of its stores, right there on Haight Street, & my memory was that
there was some local resistance--including posting of anti-GAP/corporate
interest flyers & the like. So, some of what Ginsberg does doesn't jive
w/me, has me "questioning," is what I'm--finally--saying, I guess. When I
read that Sonic Youth (my favorite rock & roll band, notorious for their
recording *right over* a recording of Madonna on their _Ciccone Youth_
l.p.) had done a GAP ad, too, it absolutely depressed me; colored--which
isn't to say completely "destroyed"--my appreciation of their work. In the
PR kit I received w/Ginsberg's latest book, _Cosmopolitan Greetings_
(which includes a reprint of that anti-smoking rag, btw), his publicist
was actually *bragging* about the GAP ad, suggesting it as being
indicative of the "complexity" of Ginsberg's character.  Well, my take was
simply that it was a mistake for him to've done that, not something I'd
feel comfortable endorsing. Can't imagine Lenny Bruce appearing in an ad
for the GAP, I guess. (Though, God knows, maybe he did appear in an ad or
two for something, or would've, if he'd've lived long enough.) (At any
rate, the GAP has undoubtedly bought the rights to his image, & plan to
use it, if they've not already--corporate interests will get their slimy
hands on us one way or the other. Ah, well.)

     Yours,

Well yes, then, you would probably want to supply ascii. If you were
interested, you might learn html later, which is a mark-up language
that permits some basic formatting and the possibility of making links
in World-Wide Web documents. (I'm not sure if you even have world-wide
web access. Sometimes this is obtained by typing
lynx
at your system prompt.) One basic use of html is that you can mark
your ascii text, for example, so that there is a table of contents and
the user can jump to the section of the text indicated by the table of
contents. That's one of the basic uses.

You can get more info about html by using the web to go to:
http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/demoweb/html-primer.html

You may wish to submit ascii first and investigate html as time
permits; it takes a while to learn but is very useful.

All best,
Loss

Well, Tony, that's funny, re Olson and "real" historians. I am
engaged in writingh a history book now, for penguin. I applied for an
academic grant, and got turned down, because the granting agency sent
my application to some history professors. They were nice enough to
send me copies of the profs' reports. One of them, which was filled
with very bad English, said I should not get anything because, for
instance, I was going to go to local museums instead of a centralized
archive, as a real historian would do. So it goes.

A very quick literal version of the quote would give something like
this:

        "O, I have lost them all in the arms, only you, you are
constantly born anew."

As I don't have the context, this is all I can do at 6 a.m. The
awkward "the arms" could possibly become "my arms"

Sappho--phainetai moi


It appears to me that his godhead
divines your little one on one.
He plays forward on the sweet phone
of your acuteness

and galling desirability.
This is my cardiac chest unfeathering.
When I see you, nothing comes
to me to speak.

My tongue is broken.  Straightway
a fine flame consumes my skin.
With my eyes I see nothing and hear
forebodings of rain.

A cold sweat downs me.  A trembling
seizes all.  I am more green than
grass time.  I am dead no less
than I appear.




Sappho--hoi men hippeon straton


Most men take strategic knights, while others
claim armymen; the rest hold up battleships
as the greatest show on earth. But I declaim.
It's who do you love.

It's no trouble to cinch this once and for all.
For she was Helena, beauty of the mortal
elsewhere, who left the man, the aristocrat,
behind.

And went floating off to Troy, with no
mind for offspring or beloved parents.
Love walked her sideways, knowing
straightway.

For swayed
       lightly                 t            one
       puts me in mind of Anaktoria, now
out of sight.

I would rather see her step the lovely
and do the facial shine more than any
continental chariot decked with soldiers
under arms.



Sappho--poikilothron' athanat' aphrodita


Thronechanging amortal Aphrodite,
child of Zeus deceit weaver, Hey Lady,
don't break my heart on the yoke
of grief and ailment.

But come on down.  Do you remember when
you answered my call?  It was a long distance
and you listened and left your father's
golden dome,

having yoked the chariot.  The beauties
led you, swift sparrows over black earth,
dense feathers cutting spirals from heaven
to the middle of air.

They arrived on a dime, with blessed you
smiling the amortal smile.  And you asked:
"What's all this then? Why do you bother
to call?

How far across the nation did your heart
range this time?  Whose pretty little head
can I turn your way?  O Sappho, who's been
so mean to you?

Listen, if she hides now, soon she will seek.
If she won't say thankyou, soon she'll say please.
If she doesn't want it now, soon she'll be wanting,
but not willingly."


Come on.  Loose me far away from high
anxiety.  However much my little heart
wants to consume, you consummate.  You,
yourself, stand by my side.

Gary, the weasel asks:
when GAP buy Ginsberg don't they also somehow endorse all that he has done
and  'stands' for?

If that can be true, then what consequent implications does that
endorsement have for those values which he 'embodies'.? Do GAP realise what
they're 'buying' into? Does Ginsberg have an ironic position with regard to
what he's selling? Is there some intimation of a Faustian pact? Is he
selling his, and others', pasts - or a generative (even some might add
congenital) bohemian undergraduate lifestyle - or a set of ideologies and
cultural values? In other words if the production and the producer of
'Wichita Vortex Sutra' is 'good' for sales how does or can that affect the
reception and critiques of his work as a poet?

What is lost? What is gained? What can be reclaimed and on what basis?

Can the (sometimes) desperate need for societies to embrace and absorb
resistance beyond (either internally or externally) accepted margins or
consensual realities reach a point of untenable, or no longer sustainable,
flexibility? Is this another strategy for bringing the bourgeousie to its
brink?
Can a crisis in capitalism be brought about by encouraging it to stretch
too far? (the weasel notices he's way beyond the canyon's edge  -  claws at
thin air before speed lines plunge him out of the frame towards the rapidly
approaching stream in the canyon's bed)

And to pick up Ron's point about large audiences and the rock axis, hasn't
much of Ginsberg's career openly engaged with businesses bigger than the
small press?
What price the intergrity of Rolling Thunder  -  or Dylan himself for that
matter? Aren't Ginsberg and Dylan already part and parcel of the Capitalist
fabric of the American dream? I enjoy you teasing these threads apart once
more but can't we begin to develop other strategies rather than the binary
'them' and 'us' oppositions.

Doesn't all business involve forms of reification by association with
success? Like having a commendation from x on the back of the book  -  or
merely being able to publish something written by x to raise the profile of
a press. Whilst, arguably, Consumerism can't be separated from
Dissemination it isn't synonymous with Capitalism. This list and e-space
more generally has a crucial role to play in developing new relations
between process and product, between means of production and modes of
consumption between forms of communication, information distribution and
ecologies of use.

I appreciate what you posted a week or so back re; the hallmark of a great card:

>The books my wife Marta & I publish include all of the "bullshit,"
>*despite* my sense that it somehow "cheapens" the things.
>Dissemination--almost all of it, at any level--involves some degree of
>compromise. It helps, I think, if you can be consistently aware of that,
>know beforehand what you are or are not willing to do.

There is NO clean money."It's not YOUR money creep, it's MONEY!". There are
huge socio-economic arguments massing and missing here. Alongside which lie
various reductive ideologies re- mainstream and margin -

     'precious tempered formal radicals
      cleaving to illusory
      obscurity, that being the only
      security they've got' (slim pickens)

cris

p.s. In 1990 I was invited to interview Ginsberg on censorship in the U.S.
re Helms and radio 'chilling'. Didn't know what he'd be like 'in person'.
I've got to say that warts and all he struck me as to quote you one last
time 'a great card'  -  flawed but then who isn't, and full of the energy
to engage  -  the roughness of the public worlds. He 'hits on' those.

Dear Cris:

Many thanks for your truly thoughtful & hilarious post. (Great Slim Pickens
quote, btw. What's it from?) Yes, yes; that "us" & "them" is too, too
easy. (My "Windbag" sign-off not just an acknowledgment of my
talkativeness, but, as it comes from More's _Utopia_, a nudge suggesting
how ridiculously idealistic I can get, to boot.) (I'm not completely
oblivious, though I play ... , etc.)

I have friends who feel that small presses in general suffer from just
what that Pickens quote brings up--there are many days when I
wholeheartedly agree (& include myself in that, too, btw.) Still, I think
you can talk yourself into & out of believing anything, & to quote from
something a friend writes (about-to-be, but-not-yet-published) about Olson:

"He knew and taught that where there are no standards there can be, really,
no love."

Yours, w/respect

Subject:      Re: Chapbooks at EPC

appologies in advance to more Web experienced folks, but--


just wanted to add encouragement to folks considering contributing
to the EPCs electronic text, and to echo Loss's charaterization of
this as a pretty special opportunity...

to expand a little on HTML, which is the language used to write
World Wide Web documents:

HTML (HYPERTEXT MARKUP LANGUAGE)
is _much_ less intimidating than it sounds, even fr technophobes
like me--not much more complicated than MLA manuscript conventions...
*(no, really!)*.  basically, it's a set of tags that describe how
a text is presented onscreen...

-----

now, here's the above paragraph in HTML:

<p>
<H1>HTML (Hypertext Markup Language)</H1>
is <i>much</i> less intimidating than it sounds, even fr technophobes
like me--not much more complicated than MLA manuscript conventions...
<b>(no, really!)</b>.  basically, it's a set of tags describe how
a text is presented onscreen.

the "<p>" means "new paragraph"; the text between "<H1>" and "</H1>"
will be displayed as a first level heading, like a title; "<i>much</i>"
means that "much" will be displayed in italics; "(no, really!)" will
appear in bold...  all of these tags are hidden when the document is
read onscreen, the computer just interprets them & displays the text
as specified...


besides online resources, there's a book available, "Teach yourself
Web Publishing with HTML in a Week" by Laura Lemay--broken down into
"day 1", "day 2"... and all the basic text-oriented stuff is covered
by day 3.)

-----

in addition to formating, HTML allows you to jump between different
"pages" of your document, either in a specified sequence or as a
web of interconnections.  simple ways of using this would be a table
of contents, where each title is linked to it's respective poem--
the reader "clicks" on a title onscreen, and that poem is then
displayed.  another use would be footnotes that are hidden, and only
displayed at the request of the reader...  and again, the
actual formatused to specify these links is really simple...


which brings me to my real point, to encourage folks to utilize
the possibilites of the medium (& harkening back to recent discussions
about the physical design of books).  when i design a paper chapbook,
i work pretty hard to sequence the poems so that the book as a
whole "flows".  with links that aren't necessarily linear (pg 1,
pg 2 etc), whole new schemes are possible.  for my initial
chap for the EPC, i'm working with the poet--from any given poem,
she's suggesting 3 or 4 other possible poems that might make
good "segues", readers will be able to jump to any one of them
from there... and instead of a straight table of contents,
she's gonna write a new piece, sort of a letter amoung her
various "selves", which will have links (allusive/suggestive,
rather than simply the titles) into the various poems...


i've been working with Loss for the past coupla weeks, figuring
out from scratch how this stuff fits together--he's made things
very easy.  i'd be happy to offer my meager experience to any of
you considering taking him up on this offer.

Of course, sure, Ginsberg often hits on young guys. He never denies
that--in fact, mentions it from time to time. What is he supposed to
do: hit on old guys? If the young guys are smitten by fame, well,
Allen isnt going to make them pay for it.

     Excerpt from _Dark Decade_ (relevant to a number of threads here,
recent & not-so-recent):

     THE POET'S CONDITION
     His aesthetics were fed by linguistics, not ecstacy, and he banked on
the gestures of middle class life. He matched his chairs with the
diningroom table while the computer continued its printout unsupervised.
Children dropped into the picture in their requisite role as accessories
of the age. The macho tactics that had launched his embryonic career also
catapulted themselves into the domestic arrangements.
     The expectations of a whole generation of forbearers stood ahead of
him in the path to glory. The high stakes were all low paying, gambling
for the dubious slots in history, and the strategies of youth had all been
Oedipal -- taking on masters and then taking aim. What was poetry in this
moment but a marginal commentary on a marginal form, smudged against the
hallmark of literature, and sleeping undisturbed between the covers of
slim volumes? . . .
     Dyna is not part of this picture, but is also ready to be described.
She begs for pulp terms to break the taboo against violence to women with
the glandular vocabulary of the super-market novel. Her moments lend
themselves to sensationalism. She lives the very antithesis of the obscure
literary genre. Hers is a popular mythological tale, full of glamour,
gloss and textural attributes. But feeling correct and circumspect we
merely indicate the presence of a woman.
     The poet, meanwhile, has made it to the kitchen where he takes a hunk
of bread and begins to live with it. Frustration spreads itself with the
knife of anticipation -- later. Later. The refrain stings his soul,
against the strange injustice of a world unwilling to acknowledge the
power of the word in its own climate: language. The bread bit into him and
we lost the opportunity for elaborate development of character or scenes:
while the angel of mercy reserved the loaf along with the goals, aims, and
