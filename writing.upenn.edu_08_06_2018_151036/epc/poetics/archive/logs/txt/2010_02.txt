Somapoetics is the name of a book by George Quasha. The soma in
question is a hallucinogen mentioned in Hindu religious texts and
often identified with peyote or magic mushrooms. Somatopoetics would
avoid the confusion and also I think be more linguistically correct.

Best,

Yeah=2C I'd forgotten about Micah's book . . . it's very good.  Well=2C it'=
s actually not about John=2C it's more about Micah's idea of negative capab=
ility in poetry citing John occasionally to proof his concepts.  Micah's co=
ncepts=2C not John's.  Did John have concepts?  Possibly.  Robert von Hallb=
erg's interview questions made it seem so in 1973.  But John's conversation=
al epics with Charles Shively in that year and in 1977 constitute intersect=
ing frames of reference=2C rather than concepts.  Or=2C do intersecting fra=
mes of reference constitute "a concept"?  God=2C I hope not.  I want "sex" =
to be spelled with just three letters=2C as always=2C like "god".  Leave th=
e four-letter words to contemporary bean eaters.  Or steamers of rice.  My =
partner and I will be ozzing behind a peach-colored curtain draped from a t=
in awning.  The heat here is terrible.  Call me when it's done.

It'll be interesting to see how iPad & other tablets make a stab at
replacing books in a few important ways.  I have to say if a student
can carry all of his textbooks for the year on one large handheld
device that hopefully is optimized for reading, I'm interested.  But
it's sure taken a long time for tablets-devices to be ready for the
masses.

I had a similar experience. When i saw him in the hall outside the room
in which the Boston Poetry Marathon was taking place, at which he was
scheduled to read, I approached him and asked if he was John Wieners.
"Yes I am," he said. I said, "It's an honor to meet you." He said, "Same
here," and we shook hands. So sweet and kind.

I'm interested in places online that might have more images / texts of these
visual poems.

Were the Meyer texts published separately, ever?  I know she wrote several
books.

Robert--

As you probably know this is a daunting task if you wish to be =
comprehensive
in terms of secondary bibliographical material. There are items on =
Creeley
and Duncan I see in my _Robert Creeley, Edward Dorn, and Robert Duncan: =
A
Reference Guide_ (G.K. Hall, 1989) which mention Wieners. Most of the =
items
that at least initially reviewed or discussed Wieners and his poetry are =
in
un-indexed little magazines which are incredibly difficult to find =
without
perusing piles, say, of _Fag Rag Magazine_ (out of Boston) at =
collections
like those at Madison and Buffalo. (These two, in fact, try to be
comprehensive collections of little mags in English during the 20th =
cent.
Madison is best 1900-1976, Buffalo from 1976 to the present.)

I hope you're not doing this for a thesis or dissertation.

Good luck,

Skip Fox
(as Willard Fox on bibliography)

i have written many poems to pain tings
my latest chapbook consists of 17 poems written after the insomnia
drawings of louise bourgeois in fact
the word which i never spell wright applies only to poems written for or
related to painting
more precisely visual art so sculpture can be included tho more
specifically painting

In its original definition, ekphrastic can be ascribed to writing about any
visual art form - dance, theater, movies, mime. It is only in the past
couple of centuries that it has been constricted to writing about painting.

I've been working on a new Javascript app to display images on the net. If
you've seen any of the previous dbCinema slideshows, you may recall they
didn't have fade in/out of the images. I was finally motivated to make that
sort of app. The motivation was not for the dbCinema images, but for some
others which aren't up yet, which I'll show you when that project is
finished.

However, I have developed the app with the dbCinema images. All of the
dbCinema slideshows at http://vispo.com/dbcinema now have that feature. Fade
in/out enhances the experience of these images because there is often
continuity between the images, and the fading in of one over another reveals
the nature of the continuity in a way that both shows how the thing is
growing/changing and contributes to the 'cinema' of dbCinema.

It also provides 'action' while the app is busy downloading the next image,
which is a consideration in streaming net art. Usually the images are
1280x1024 in size and vary from around 75kb to about 400kb in file size, so
the downloading of the images is usually not instantaneous.

There are lots of slideshow apps on the net. Why not use one of those? Well,
the ones I saw were usually suitable for smaller images. I wanted this to
take up the entire screen for a particular art experience, not a general
showing of photos. I also wanted to have categories of links that usually
weren't available with the ones on the net. And I wanted the interface
simple and integrated into the viewing area, rather than having one area for
the graphics and one for the controls, so the full screen could be used to
show the graphics. But, also, I've been kind of interested in the
architecture of a slideshow app. More on that a bit later.

The app has two 'pages' or screens. The first displays thumbails of some or
all of the images. Some of the series have hundreds of images; in that case,
the thumbnails show every second or third image. This page or screen also
usually contains a link to information about the series. And links to the
previous and next series via the '<<' and '>>' buttons.

When you either click a thumbnail image or the '[...]' button, you enter the
second page or screen which displays the slideshow. You can adjust the
amount of time images are displayed and the amount of time images fade by
clicking the 'Options' button. The numbers are in milliseconds. 1000
milliseconds is 1 second. You can also choose whether images fade in/out or
just fade in. When the images fade in/out, there's a dimming and
brightening. When they just fade in, that dimming/brightening is not
present. Sometimes the dimming/brightening is nice, such as in the Silvia
Saint series. It gives it a sort of breath in and out.

But, all that said, the main thing I've learned in making this app is how to
make a better one that I haven't made yet. And therein lies an interesting
lesson for me.

The architecture of the current app involves two images. One image fades in
while the other fades out. Or one fades in while the other, which is already
faded in, stays static in the background and disappears once the other is
faded in.

A more general architecture would be as follows. It would involve going OOP
(object oriented programming) with the app. The idea would be to program an
image object. When it's time to display a particular image, an image object
would be dynamically created. The data of this object would include the
image itself, it's name and so forth. The methods or behaviors would include
the mouse event functions, the fade in/out functions, the destructor
function, and so on. When the object is no longer required, it's deleted.

The advantage of this dynamic creation/destruction of image objects is that
rather than being limited to two images, you can have several images
onscreen at once. So, for instance, when the user quickly presses the '>'
button repeatedly, the response could be more as one would like.

But, more importantly, it would free up formal possibilities. For instance,
one could program keyboard functionality so that when a particular key is
pressed, a particular image could fade in/out or do that and grow/shrink.

Getting away from the notion of a slideshow into a more general form.

And that is of artistic interest. Programming should suggest and open up
formal possibilities. Going OOP, properly understood, does that. So next up
for me when I approach another Javascript project will be getting a handle
on OOP in Javascript. There's an interesting article on the subject at
http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/cc163419.aspx

Part of the idea of dbCinema is to explore the possibilities of cinema
between the still, the slideshow, and the sort of dbCinema at
http://vispo.com/dbcinema/londonhypotrochoid which is further yet from
slideshow but is, nonetheless, based on 100 pictures downloaded from the net
via a Google image search of "London". This latter piece does not use the
new slideshow app but dbCinema itself.

Depends what you mean by original.  Wasn't the first to do it Paul the Usher
(Paulus Silentarius), in poems which survived to the Greek Anthology, about
the friezes on the Parthenon (or somewhere)?  So my sense of the very
absolutely original meaning of the term would be whatever Paul did.

(They are pretty dreadful, scan boring, poems compared with his other work,
which itself isn't exactly to-die-for material).

It appears to me that Stephen Ellis's speculation about Weiners not "having=
 concepts" is a distinction, not a denigration, but to emphasize that I'd a=
sk us to imagine an Elizabethan person interviewing Wm. Shakespeare--perhap=
s W.S. would not elaborate anything that sounded like a major, original con=
cept. Yet his words are there to be elaborated upon until the end of everyt=
hing.

One thing I'd point to in Weiners: the simple phrase "small fires" as it oc=
curs in "A Poem for Cocksuckers" seems bottomless. I love how Silliman has =
pointed out that imagistically it might mean "cigarettes". What it means mo=
st for me is that Weiners is working to steal the elegance and potency of H=
igh Art for the use of despised minorities, as Prometheus stole fire from t=
he gods for the minor race we call human.  =20

I'm sorry. I don't get your point here.
At first I did not understand why you would think that JW had done
something.
And now I still don't get it--that is, what do you find wrong with
the word "criticism"?
As to what it means, etymologically--well, we should all know that it
comes from
the Gk. for sifting.
What's wrong with that?

Earlier, much earlier. Homer:
"& first Hephaestus makes a great & massive shield / blazoning well-wrought
emblems all across its surface..."
writing about the shield of Achilles in the Iliad.

Perhaps I should have said purest, rather than original. As an example: Anny
Ballardini's recent book "Ghost Dance in 33 Movements", a series of poems
about films & videos found on UbuWeb, is pure ekphrasis.

But, I agree,these days it's primarily used to describe poems about
paintings. My own contribution to the field can be found at

I thought this may be of interest--& inspiration-- to not only the admirers
of Hikmet as great Poet/Activist in poetry/life--
but also of interest to al those who've been inspired by the great work of
Turkish/American Poet Murat Nemet-Nejat in translating, editing,  and
writing profoundly on it in introducing the Concept of Eda in his Anthology
of Contemporary Turkish Poetry,  a work which is inspiring and horizon
opening and whose effects are already being felt reverberating in
contemporary American Poetry--
as ver--greatest thanks Murat and to Hikmet! for their ongoing inspiration
and examples-

Tickets: 0207 5964 000

A Foundation is the London focus of a touring exhibition to Istanbul, Londo=
n
and Berlin 2009/10. Inspired by the celebrated Turkish writer and political
figure Nazim Hikmet's book of poems Journeys With No Return, this project
explores reflections of Turkish migration on contemporary art.

Twelve artists from Germany, Great Britain and Turkey uncover themes around
Turkish migration over the last 50 years in works that are new to UK
audiences =96 six of which are unveiled for the first time. The artists
balance the local with the global, their subjective sense of identity with
cultural dissemination that potentially knows no borders. Using popular
music, rap, cinematic conventions, anthropology and documentary they exploi=
t
archive images, cultural stereotypes and information systems. The artworks
stretch from video, film, photography, drawing to installation and reach ou=
t
with methods of communication that echo mainstream and popular cultural
forms.

*Zineb Sedira* finds resonances of transportation in forgotten railway
sidings, while *Clemens von Wedemeyer* has created a cinematic work that is
as much a tribute to his modernist masters - Mayakovsky, Tarkovsky - as it
is a film about crossing a border. *Melanie Manchot* takes a traditional
European painting genre, the double portrait, and restores connections
between people separated by migration. *Adam Chodzko* has created a surreal
documentary about Romanian migrant strawberry pickers editing a historical
archive of London hop pickers, subverting readings of power relations,
identity, time and place. *Nasan Tur's* demonstration backpacks consist of =
a
range of unusual objects and reference both mobility and rebellion. *Asli
Sungu* uncovers historical layers that unexpectedly explode with poetic
equivalences that only an outsider could create.

*The conference* is organised with the International Curators Forum and
addresses the themes of the exhibition, how culture is transformed through
migration and the influence of Turkish migration on contemporary
practitioners. It is chaired by *Edgar Schmitz* (Goldsmith College, London)
and *Lisa Le Feuvre* (Writer and Curator) and includes speakers *Irit Rogof=
f
*, Professor of Visual Culture at Goldsmiths College, a theorist, curator
and organiser, Artist Adam Chodzko and *Dr. Mark Nash*, Head of Department
for Curating Contemporary Art, Royal College of Art.

Journeys With No Return opened alongside the 11th Istanbul Biennial at the
Akbank Cultural Centre, Istanbul in September 2009 and will be presented in
Berlin in June 2010.

and compelling selection of more than 1,300 books, pamphlets, =
manuscripts, correspondence and related materials from the library of =
preeminent American poet Robert Creeley (1926-2005). Robert Creeley made =

Thanks, everyone, for the many thoughtful leads.  One wonderful text no
one's mentioned yet, that I just thought I would throw in here, is the
tiny chapbook LOSS by Ben Friedlander (Pressed Wafer 2003).  A model in
"criticism," as far as I'm concerned (formulated as it is as a candid
reflection on an oddly intense, affecting encounter Friedlander had w/ a
poem), & one of my favorite things on Wieners.

Jacket magazine: An Announcement from John Tranter and Al Filreis


Dear friends:

We are writing with news of a transition we both deem very exciting.

By the end of 2010, John Tranter and Pam Brown will have put out 40
issues of Jacket (jacketmagazine.com). It began in what John recalls
as "a rash moment" in 1997 - an early all-online magazine, one of the
earliest in the world of poetry and poetics, and quite rare for its
consistency over the years. "The design is beautiful, the contents
awesomely voluminous, the slant international modernist and
experimental." (So said _The Guardian_.)

After issue 40, John will retire from thirteen years of intense every-
single-day involvement with Jacket, and the entire archive of
thousands of web pages will move intact to servers at the University
of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, where it will of course be available
on the internet to everyone, for free, as always. But the magazine is
not ceasing publication: quite the opposite.

Starting with the first issue in 2011, Jacket will have a new home,
extra staff and a vigorous future as Jacket2. Jacket and its
continuation, Jacket2, will be hosted by the Kelly Writers House and
PennSound at the University of Pennsylvania.

The connection with PennSound, a vast and growing archive of audio
recordings of poetry performance, discussion and criticism, is seen as
a valuable additional facet of the new magazine, as is the
relationship with busy Kelly Writers House, a lively venue for day-to-
day poetic interchange of all kinds. The synergy in this three-way
relationship has great potential.

Al will become Publisher and Jessica Lowenthal, Director of the
Writers House, will be Associate Publisher. The new Editor will be
Michael S. Hennessey (currently Managing Editor of PennSound) and the
new Managing Editor will be Julia Bloch. John will be available as
Founding Editor, and Pam will continue as Associate Editor.

More news about Jacket2 in the weeks and months to come. Meantime, the
Jacket2 folks extend gratitude -- as many in the world of poetics do
-- to John and to Pam Brown for the extraordinary work they've done.
And John, for his part, is mightily pleased that Jacket will be
preserved and will continue and grow in a somewhat new mode but with a
continuous mission and approach.

I blog about a liberal newspaper which criticizes Yale University Press
for censoring one of its own books. Punch line: the liberal newspaper
itself practices the same kind of censorship, and then refuses to admit
that that's what it's doing.

Martha Deed, Millie's Niss's mother, has put together 111 photos of Millie
from birth till shortly before her death on November 29. I've put those
photos and Martha's notes about the photos on vispo.com, along with a piece
of writing I did about Millie.

http://vispo.com/millie
http://vispo.com/millie/s.htm

Many thanks to Martha for allowing me and you access to these photos which
are dear to her. I found them very moving and learned much about my friend's
life that I did not know, previously. Thanks also to Martha for her generous
correspondence with me, in a difficult time for her, throughout the process
of our doing this project. I quote one of Martha's emails in its entirety in
the writing I did; it is very illuminating concerning several issues
relevant to the photos and provides us with some knowledge of the health
problems Millie experienced throughout her life.

'For Millie Niss' also contains many links to Millie's work, writings about
her, and to Martha's work. They worked together as a creative team sometimes
known as M & M. Martha is continuing her own work and is also working on
various projects involving Millie's writings and web art. Martha is
continuing in her creativity, which one can't help but know Millie would
have wished for her very much. She is continuing the Sporkworld blog she and
Millie did together, for instance, at http://sporkworld.tumblr.com .

A seductive exploration of the individual=97Mary Kasimor=92s new book is
innovative and energy packed, crafted and aurally interesting, with poems
ranging from classical myth to Freud to Rimbaud to butterflies.  These poem=

delve insightfully into the person and the process of writing and definitel=

reward reading and rereading. =97*William Allegrezza*



'There are always butterflies around death' and around the vivid poems of *=
&
cruel red* language leaps with multi-layered pleasures. Diverse spaces,
where 'tractors tow a fleece of sky', 'secrets circulate', where grass grow=
s
a spine, and it can rain moss. As the very first poem suggests 'you are
tangled up', and indeed we are as we are lead to the threshold between chao=
s
and order, pain and relief, burden and symphony.  Deconstruction/
reproduction=97Mary Kasimor navigates what lies between. All 'safety rolls
away', bones are reshaped, the poems look for surprised freedoms and find
them.  =97*Diana Adams*



A curious and open mind, in love with the writing of and experimenting with
language, is awake within the pages of Mary Kasimor=92s new book, *& cruel =

everyday reflect the presence of a poet whose subjects exist in all that
life might offer.  =97*Bobbi Lurie*

new Heretical Texts Series:

Factory School is pleased to announce the publication of Heretical
Texts, Volume 5:

1. TOWN, by Kate Schapira (70 pages): How we live differently in the
same world, who we mean when we say we, what we mean when we say here.

2. Green-Wood, by Allison Cobb (166 pages): Wanders Brooklyn=92s famous
nineteenth century Green-Wood Cemetery and discovers that its 500
acres--hills and ponds, trees and graves--mirror the American
landscape: a place marked by greed, war, and death, but still pulsing
with life.

3. Underground National, by Sueyeun Juliette Lee (108 pages): Go
underground and enter into a subterranean consideration of how History
collides with human memory to generate new, unseen currents for being.

death, power, Poetry and blackness---each is implicated in a general
failure of perfection and subjected to furious lyric re-thinking.

5. The City Real & Imagined, by CAConrad & Frank Sherlock (100 pages):
Visit landmarks that remain standing, revisit citizens that live on in
memory, and participate in the future mappings of your city yet to be

---> We are welcoming the Brooklyn-based poet & musician to town and celebrating the release of her her art-pop song cycle about Biblical women, Girls in Trouble.  She is  the violinist in klezmer-rock band Golem, and her album Girls in Trouble was released on Jdub Records in November 2009.  Her poems have appeared in Boston Review, 6 x 6, Poems of Brooklyn (NYU Press) and Horse Poems (Everyman's Library).

Of her appearance at The New Tentacle she says,
"My performance will definitely involve live violin looping, singing about obscure Biblical women, and perhaps reading from an ongoing series of surreal instruction manuals."

Subject: Millie Niss

Martha Deed, Millie's Niss's mother, has put together 111 photos of Millie
from birth till shortly before her death on November 29. I've put those
photos and Martha's notes about the photos on vispo.com, along with a piece
of writing I did about Millie.

http://vispo.com/millie
http://vispo.com/millie/s.htm

Many thanks to Martha for allowing me and you access to these photos which
are dear to her. I found them very moving and learned much about my friend's
life that I did not know, previously. Thanks also to Martha for her generous
correspondence with me, in a difficult time for her, throughout the process
of our doing this project. I quote one of Martha's emails in its entirety in
the writing I did; it is very illuminating concerning several issues
relevant to the photos and provides us with some knowledge of the health
problems Millie experienced throughout her life.

'For Millie Niss' also contains many links to Millie's work, writings about
her, and to Martha's work. They worked together as a creative team sometimes
known as M & M. Martha is continuing her own work and is also working on
various projects involving Millie's writings and web art. Martha is
continuing in her creativity, which one can't help but know Millie would
have wished for her very much. She is continuing the Sporkworld blog she and

I am sorry to hear about Millie's death. We used to be in correspondence and
had spent one afternoon together. At that time she was doing translations of
Rimbaud's poetry. I thought they were the best Rimbaud translations into
English I had read and told her so.

Her continuous onrush of physical misfortunes had, to me, a phantasmagorical
air about them, not that they were not real; but an amazement that one could
have so many of them, and so remorselessly. At that time, I think, she still
assumed she was bi-polar or suffering from some other such mental disease.
My reaction to her diseases was colored by that information.

She was one of the most brilliant people I knew, following her own music. I
was an avid follower of her blogs. I even participated in one of her
projects,

My best wishes to her mother.

Murat

Announcing the publication of Jonathan Skinner's chapbook With Naked Foot,
which will be featured in the upcoming Poets House Showcase of new poetry
books this April. Jonathan will be conducting two seminars and a workshop at
Poets House entitled "Ecopoetics After Copenhagen" **in May of this year.
For more information about this seminar, please visit the "eco" page at Poets
House <http://poetshouse.org/progwkshp.htm#eco>.

In the February/March 2010 issue of The Poetry Project
Newsletter<http://poetryproject.org/publications/newsletter>,
Edmund Berrigan describes Jonathan Skinner as a poet's poet who "has an
elegant way across a poem, and offers an updated set of movements on a
valuable resource: the nature poem."

Here is some additional praise for his poetry:

Jonathan Skinner has from the very beginning been the knight errant of
eco-poetics. He stands in company with Jack Collom and Merrill Gilfillan,
stalking "with naked foot" poetically and democratically (like St. George),
the enormous carbon footprints of a no longer jolly, green GIANT. --Michael
Gizzi

Hoa Nguyen describes With Naked Foot as:
a compact field guide to a life deeply lived. Not afraid to name birds,
bodies in time and space, how the heart is, how animals. Lush sound
fields--at once Keatsian and Olsonic in its mind moves. "do not eat me let
me/ bloom and fuck let live/ this exhortation in me / against use." A
fantastic group of poems from this Earth inhabitant.

little scratch pad press will happily and promptly mail you a copy of this
book for $7 postage paid in the US, $10 to Canada & Mexico, $15 overseas).
Orders can be requested by email, or by writing

My seventeenth poetry collection, wild horses, is now available from the

Kroetsch + Alice Major) in Edmonton and Calgary, with other launches in
Toronto and Ottawa, at least, coming soon. Either order directly from the

wild horses
rob mclennan


Cast during his year in the U of A's writer in residency, wild horses is
Ottawan rob mclennan's deep lyrical engagement with Edmonton, Alberta. He
sees the new terrain through his peculiar, sympathising
lens--characterised by impassioned tones that range from brusque to
tender. There is something of the magpie in him: nothing escapes his
subtle gaze, his flighty wit, his voracious gleaning of experience. His
supple lines meander and flit over scapes of love, home, family, and
literature, rewarding the magpie-minded with a lucid estrangement to
things both unfamiliar and familiar.

**The Chris Stroffolino Pop Snob Sideshow
http://www.myspace.com/chrisstroffolino

Chris Stroffolino writes: "I dedicate this bio note to the late Vic =20
Chesnutt, who died on boxing days eve 2009, as a direct result of =20
American health insurance business. A quadriplegic since 1983, =20
Chesnutt's 'pre-existing condition' prevented him from receiving =20
adequate treatment. He could have received SSI Disability because of =20
his condition, but his accident also awakened his songwriting ability, =20=

and he heroically battled his condition for 25 years--releasing many =20
albums (the most recent one produced by Jonathan Richman)--and, though =20=

he never made enough money to pay for the exorbitant costs of his =20
health treatement, he made TOO MUCH to be eligible for Social Security =20=

disability support. It's a sad cruelty of America that had he had not =20=

tried to make something of himself after his accident, and achieved =20
success as a songwriter (at his best, he reminds me of what I love =20
about Townes Van Zandt), he would have received more economic support =20=

for his 'health issues.'

"Of course, the basic obituaries will just say, 'he died of an =20
overdose of pain killers,' but read his statements about his health =20
care, and you tell me if this beautiful heroic survivor's death was =20
'suicide.' I am absolutely sure that Vic would not mind being used as =20=

a rallying cry in his death. He's so much more--but another reason to =20=

step up the fight for Single Payer."

Oh, as for Chris Stroffolino--he likes to think you can trust him, and =20=

says you might even like his new solo album, available at the above url.

Reading
Charles Bernstein

Location: Swift 106 (NOT the Ren, as went out in the original email)
Admission: free
Sponsored by the Reniaissance Society

Highly esteemed poet, professor, and literary scholar Charles Bernstein wil=
l
do a reading dedicated to his daughter Emma. The reading coincides with the
release of All the Whiskey in Heaven, a thirty-year anthology. In addition,
the reading will celebrate the recent release of Radical Poetics and Secula=
r
Jewish Culture, a collection of essays in which poets and critics,
Bernsteinamong them, address the question of what constitutes radical
poetry written
by Jews defined as =91secular=92, and whether or not there is a Jewish comp=
onent
or dimension to radical and modernist poetic practice in general. The
reading will be followed by a discussion and reception.

Charles Bernstein is Donald T. Regan Professor of English and Comparative
Literature at the University of Pennsylvania.

Very sad to hear of Millie Niss' death.  I subscribed to her blog  feed.  I
am glad that she made it to &Now last year.  I almost  went, partly just to
meet her, also to see Cris Cheek in a kilt.  I decided  to wait.

A reminder: there is no blood test for schizophrenia, manic-depression, or
depression.  Genetic tests are in development but not, I think, in use in
diagnosis.  Medications serve as trial prognosis; rival medical conditions,
treatments, and specializations complicate it.

Subject:      Choi's "the terrorists"
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1

Openly gay Lieutenant Dan Choi continues his endless stream of
appearances at college campuses, and in newspaper, magazine and radio
interviews for the push for repealing "Don't Ask, Don't Tell."  I tune
in deliberately when I know he'll be on in order to listen to the way
he handles himself, and better yet, the way he manages to continue
using outdated pro-war propaganda.

For instance today on NPR the usual interview with poor, abused Dan
Choi who only wants to defend the mighty but somehow also defenseless
Americans.  At one point he's talking about an earlier assignment in
Iraq when he was still closeted and allowed to point his gun at
Iraqis.  He was talking about patrolling The Triangle of Death region
looking for "the terrorists, the insurgents."  There was literally a
comma separating in his speaking, just like this, "the terrorists, the
insurgents."

Haven't we COMPLETELY dealt with the lies of Bush, Cheney, Rice in
this matter?  The terrorists of 911 were not Iraqi.  Choi gets away
with it though, no one dares correct him conflating issues, especially
not the liberal media who are in the middle of interviewing him
because HE'S been made into the victim.  Poor Dan Choi who can't go
looking for "terrorists" (his word choice) in Iraq because he's gay.
Dan Choi needs a remedial course in recent US history apparently.

This is the perfect time for Dan Choi to make his case though, perfect
for everyone who is pro-war.  Pro-war lesbian and gay soldiers will
finally get the support of pro-war American elected officials who are
either secretly or openly for war because the gay shield is in use.
The state can make all of their arguments now as to WHY "DADT" should
be repealed, and in doing so have indirect support for war by getting
poster boy's like Choi to go around the country using the outdated
propaganda glossary from the last administration.

It's a win-win for all who want war.  The hyper-masculine model gets
its way, all the way.  And it's so subtle, so weirdly politically
correct that it's nearly impossible to challenge in the end.  Choi is
masterful at sounding like a strong and powerful victim.  He's the
protector kept from doing his sacred job.  It's amazing to me that he
gets away with it.  But he does get away with it, over and over again.
 And HE gets to set himself up as an activist, as someone seeking
civil rights, while the rights of the Iraqi's are never in question.

I'm an openly queer man who is against war, especially the American
occupations of Iraq and Afghanistan, and I believe very strongly that
Dan Choi and other LGBT soldiers are being used to continue fanning
the flames of war in a way which is completely new to us.  Repealing
"Don't Ask, Don't Tell" is genius to do right now at a time when
support for our wars is waning.

Please consider reading and signing my online petition opposing the
war Dan Choi is so proud of serving in.  I direct you FIRST to a blog
I wrote so that you can in fact see that the petition (which is linked
on the blog) was written by me.  I say this, and do this because many
people have actually accused me of being a Republican uncover, looking
for ways to trick the unsuspecting liberal into opposing a civil
liberty.

There's nothing civil about war, especially these present American
wars.  Here is the blog which has a link to the online petition:

Carlita shows me photos,
sonograms of her baby,

a smile, feel sad. At least she's
talking with me about it.

Lucille Clifton's work: a very big mirror in which it is always possible to
find your poetry + poetics.
I had the great honor of being her squire when she made her first visit to
the University of Mississippi in February 2002.  At that time she said of
her historic reading--hundreds of people packed in, students were literally
wedged in the door frame, all the way up--
"I usually don't do anything in February, but I decided, why not?"
Miss Clifton Mrs Clifton Ms Clifton why did you go do that in February, now
why did you go do that?

Reading for The Whole Island:
Six Decades of Cuban Writing

Join us as we celebrate this landmark volume of Cuban poetry edited by Mark
Weiss, The Whole Island (University of California Press, 2009). It makes
available the astonishing achievement of a wide range of Cuban poets over
the past 60 years. The translations, almost all of them new, convey the
intensity and beauty of the accompanying Spanish originals and constitute a=
n
essential source for understanding the literature and culture of Cuba, its
diaspora, and the Caribbean at large. With poet Lourdes Gil and translators
Chris Brandt, M=F3nica de la Torre, Jason Weiss and Mark Weiss.

Lourdes Gil came to the United States from Cuba in 1961. Her poetry

poetry and Peace and Justice at Fordham University. His poems and essays
have been widely published. His translations of Cuban fiction have appeared

poetry were published by the Instituto de Cultura PuertorriqueZa. Seven
Stories published his translation of Clara Nieto=B9s Masters of War, a histor=
y
of U.S. interventions in Latin America. =A0

,

multilingual anthology Reversible Monuments: Contemporary Mexican Poetry
(Copper Canyon Press). She is a 2009 NYFA fellow in poetry and senior edito=
r

* Please mark your calendars for this coming Wednesday, February 18th @ 2:00
pm for Ronan Crowley's talk, "Dead and Gone": John Montague's Patriotic
Suite (1966) and the Yeats Centenary.

 This talk will be held in The Poetry Collection, 420 Capen @ SUNY Buffalo.
This event is free and open to the public.


Small Press in the Archive Lecture Series dedicates itself to the
study of poetry outside the traditional literary historical plot. The
lectures in this series draw on materials in The Poetry Collection, at
SUNY Buffalo in order to explore community/discourse formations, the
status of ephemera and the making of genre, the conditions of literary
production, transatlantic cross-pollinations in and between specific
magazines, the careers of poets, the role of book art, and how the
little magazine functions in the making of the avant-garde.

http://splab.org/?p=3D355=0AAfter 35 years in Port Townsend, Sam Hamill is =
closing a chapter in his life and beginning another. The home, studio and l=
ibrary, he created in the woods near Port Townsend, Washington in the late =
1970=E2=80=99s is being made available for sale and our vision is to create=
 a retreat for poets, scholars and painters to build on the remarkable lega=
cy that has been created here in that time by the poet/ scholar/editor and =
his wife, painter, Gray Foster.=0A=0AWe envision purchasing the property fr=
om Hamill and Foster, with additional funding to ensure ten years of admini=
stration to facilitate retreats by individual artists and couples ranging f=
rom one week to three months. These would be made possible through a compet=
itive application process and through partner organizations. The retreat wo=
uld be made available for rental for writing retreats, but there would be t=
ime built into the yearly calendar allowing need-based writers to stay free=
 as Kage-an Fellows. Sam Hamill, and his estate in the event of his death, =
would be involved in the process of deciding what artists use the facility,=
 thereby continuing the focus of his legacy.=0A=0AThe current value of the =
property is $350,000 and we propose a budget of $500,000, with $400,000 goi=
ng to Hamill and Foster, with the remaining $100,000 earmarked for ten year=
s of administration.=0A=0AWe envision writers and painters with a focus sim=
ilar to Hamill=E2=80=99s and Foster=E2=80=99s legacy, including, but not li=
mited to Engaged Buddhism, Chinese and Japanese poetry, the work of Kenneth=
 Rexroth and other west coast poets and contemporary painters in the Northw=
est tradition, including those inspired by Morris Graves, Mark Tobey and ot=
hers. Although writers with the focus outlined here would have primary cons=
ideration, we would ensure it becomes a place welcoming to writers and pain=
ters of varied backgrounds and scholarship and would welcome partnerships w=
ith organizations interested in helping facilitate the experience of Kage-a=
n for serious artists.=0A=0ASam adds: "One of the major points about leavin=
g Kage-an is my heart condition and my Drs being nearly 90 minutes away. In=
 Anacortes they'll be five or ten minutes away.And if we manage to pull thi=

Turning on Rights: Politics, Performance, and the Text, April 16-17, 2010
SUNY Albany, Keynotes: Rachel Zolf, Joseph Slaughter

=93The other is the neighbour, who is not necessarily kin, but who can be. =
And
in that sense, if you're for the other, you're for the neighbour. But if
your neighbour attacks another neighbour or treats him unjustly, what can
you do? Then alterity takes on another character, in alterity we can find a=
n
enemy, or at least we are faced with the problem of knowing who is right an=
d
who is wrong, who is just and who is unjust.=94 (Emmanuel L=E9vinas, quoted=
 in
Rachel Zolf's Neighbour Procedure)

How do "rights" intervene in and compose our notions and notations of just
and unjust, right and wrong? In wide ranging disciplines, rights of the
subject and to the objective world are both historically grounded and
contemporarily debated. If discourses of all varieties are also textual
sites, then the places where rights are manifested (technology, culture, ar=
t
and literature, science, law, and ontology) must be read and ultimately
performed.

This conference features work that explores definitions, constructions, and
performative notions of rights. How do texts challenge predominant
conceptual narratives of rights? In what ways does literature explore
notions of rights inside and outside of the juridical realm?

As the focus of our 8th annual Graduate Student Conference, the English
Graduate Student Organization at the University at Albany seeks both
critical and creative projects that further this discussion. Rachel Zolf is
our keynote poet for the Friday evening performance. Zolf is the author of
Neighbour Procedure (2010) and Human Resources (2007), winner of the
Trillium Book Award for Poetry. Saturday's keynote will be Joseph Slaughter=
,
Associate Professor of English and Comparative Literature at Columbia and
author of Human Rights, Inc.: The World Novel, Narrative Form, and
International Law (2007).

We solicit creative submissions for inclusion in the evening performance as
well as panels and papers for Saturday. We encourage submissions from
graduate students working in any field, historical period, or scholarly
discipline. Critical abstracts should be limited to 250-300 words; creative
abstracts should include a 300 word or less description and a 3-page sample=
.
Submit abstracts to: egsoalbany@yahoo.com by March 12, 2010.

Possible areas of inquiry may include, but are not limited to:

=95 Witnessing vs. Performing Rights
=95 Authorship, Readership, Agency
=95 Animal and Other Alterities
=95 Violence, Trauma, and Testimony
=95 Sovereignty, Exemplarity, and Exception
=95 Environmental, Agricultural, and Terrestrial Rights
=95 Global vs. National Rights
=95 Unwritten, Inalienable Rights
=95 Definitions of Freedom
=95 Sexual and Reproductive Rights
=95 Corporate and Commercial Rights
=95 Information, Technology, and Copyright
=95 Rights and the Demarcations of the Body

Subject:      free long poem by Douglas Manson

i've posted a long poem to my blog:

http://dougfinmanson.blogspot.com/2010/02/long-poem.html

Douglas Manson is a freelance academic, writer and micropublisher.  In 2004
he took a Ph.D. from U.Buffalo, and soon after started *little scratch pad
press* and *Celery Flute: The Kenneth Patchen Newsletter.*  He adjuncts whe=
n
his rice supply is getting low, and otherwise likes to make raucous music,
fly kites and argue about the contemporary definition of *good love* with
his friends in Brooklyn.



I'm also giving a Blake lecture in Greenpoint, Brooklyn on February 28:


Blake Lecture 2:  Published Works

            delivered by Douglas Manson

            with some performance/dramatizations of his works

Sunday, February 28.  4:00 p.m.

99 Sutton Street, Greenpoint (Brooklyn)

            in the Cork Building, please ring the Kevorkian bell for entry


Blake is cool because he=92s a workshop for the mind of his readers, whethe=
r
they be thinkers, poets or painters.   His many works in text and design
provide a generous supply of ideas for re-thinking artistic practice and
performance.  He came to full maturity in the midst of multiple revolutions=
,
the results of which many would claim created our present social ideal of
harmony as an enlightenment inheritance.  Blake=92s work questions these
assumptions at the level of art and poetry.  The present lecture will focus
on his art: the style, techniques and themes of engravings and books in
which he intertwined language and visual design.  I will be using two
American examples as a way of comparing the kinds of attention viewers and
readers have given him in recent decades: the poetry of Gertrude Stein, and
the stories and graphic work found in science fiction and fantasy titles
published by Marvel Comics from the early 1970s to the early 1980s.

George,

These Pacific Coast Poetry Rules seem violent. Is that why Levertov and Duncan ended their friendship?

Somehow reassuring to know George Bowering & Herb Levy are still policing
the listserv for grammatical obscurities, but I can't quite say how.

>
> This conference features work that explores definitions,

Sure. The people I work with (and I think any good digital printer)
will cut to whatever size you want within the limitations of the
paper. And as far as I know they'll all do matt. I use Sterling
Pierce. Contact, Bill Burke. bburke@sterlingpierce.com. (516)
593-1170. Use my name. I've turned several other presses on to them.
Lovely people to work with. They correct any mistakes (every printer
makes the occasional mistake) cheerfully.

Best,

Mark Weiss

"Not since the 1982 publication of Paul Auster's Random House Book of
Twentieth Century French Poetry has a bilingual anthology so
effectively broadened the sense of poetic terrain outside the United
States and also created a superb collection of foreign poems in
English. There is nothing else like it."   John Palattella in The

Hello, all. On 10 March, the anthology I've edited for Shearsman,* Infinite
Difference: Other Poetries by UK Women Poets*, will be launched in London at
Swedenborg Hall. Between now and then I'll be posting on my blog samples of
the work therein, and I began with Anna Reckin's poem, "Lone Thorn":
http://carrieetter.blogspot.com.

I also want to say I'm going to be in NYC at the beginning of April, giving
a reading the afternoon of the third, and would be glad to talk about the
anthology, read from it, whatever, if there's an opportunity.

Cheers,
Carrie

The feeling I get from reading thru the replies on your blog is that
for many the word innovative is synonymous with word unique.

 =20
At the Department of English at City University of Hong Kong, they are =
looking for the top creative writers who want to =91write Asia.=92  This =
summer, the University is starting a ground-breaking MFA in Creative =
Writing specialising in Asian writing in English, the first programme of =
its kind in the world.  Based in the Department of English, the =
innovative 45-credit, two-year programme will accept a limited number of =
students in creative non-fiction, fiction & poetry.  The degree is =
benchmarked to international standards for the MFA.  The Hong Kong-born =
author Xu Xi has assisted in the design of the programme and is joining =
the Department as their first writer-in-residence on March 1.
=20
=93We anticipate the majority of applicants to be from Asia,=94 Xu says, =
=93but many writers in the West, both of Asian and non-Asian ethnicity, =
are increasingly drawn to Asia, especially China. They=92re not always =
best served by MFA programmes in the West where there=92s little focus =
on either a contemporary or historical Asian perspective or Asian =
literature.=94 The faculty comprises writers who =91know Asia, live =
Asia, read Asia, write Asia=92 as the launch advertisement says. The top =
criteria for admittance will be the quality of creative work.
This initiative is part of an overall strategy to develop the creative =
curriculum at the university. Professor Kingsley Bolton, Head of English =
at City University says, =93Our English Department is a very young one, =
but probably one of the most dynamic and innovative departments of its =
kind in Asia. In the next few years, we are aiming to make the English =
Department here a leading centre for creative writing, drama, and =
cultural studies, not only for Hong Kong but also for the whole of the =
Asian region.=94 The MFA is generally considered a professional degree, =
qualifying students to work in professions where good writing skills are =
required, as well as providing the groundwork for an international =
writing and publishing career.
=20
The low-residency graduate degree model is relatively new in Asia. A =
long-established pedagogical model in the U.S., such programmes are =
especially suited for the creative arts. In particular, this programme =
is ideal for working professionals who cannot afford to spend two years =
as full-time graduate students in a traditional writing programme. =
Structured for individualised learning, students work via distance =
learning with writing mentors on a one-on-one basis during the =
semesters, and attend brief =91residencies=92 at the university two to =
three times a year. The low faculty-to-student ratio allows for =
intensive feedback on the student=92s work and approximates the =
professional editor-writer relationship.
=20
The first residency is scheduled for summer 2010. The =
internationally-renowned novelist Timothy Mo will be visiting writer and =
the faculty writers for the 2010 class features an international cast =
from Hong Kong, India, the U.K, Canada and the U.S., with connections =
and roots in China, Japan, the Philippines, Malaysia, Indonesia and =
elsewhere. The writers include Tina Chang, Marilyn Chin, Luis Francia, =
Robin Hemley, Justin Hill, Sharmistha Mohanty, James Scudamore, Ravi =
Shankar, Jess Row and Madeleine Thien. For applications, please visit =
http://www.english.cityu.edu.hk/MFA and email mfawriting@cityu.edu.hk or =
call Xu Xi at ++ 852.9175.2839 for further information.

Robert Lowell was a creature, a casuality of his time. The self-portrait artist will always be with us. Lowell eventually became a confessional poet in the Plath, Berryman, Sexton mode. His "Imitations" was a welcomed exercise to anyone interested in comparitative lit.

Another look: While I'm in awe of the wierd, wild curves in the architecture of Frank Gehry, I'm also hip to the suburban house of Frank L Wright. Robert Venturi showed everyone how to concepualize: Look at the venacular ... build a mobile home ...

Does celebrating the innovative require us to shun a master?
The Chinese have been doing vispo for centuries.

Geez, no computers during Lowell era either.

Thanks for the lead, Mark (and everyone else who has sent leads). Most digi=
tal printers will do custom trim sizes on traditional print runs, but not o=

,
featuring work from Audrey Chen, Rodrigo Toscano, Cecil Touchon, Randy
Thurman, James Sanders, Chris Martin, Mannlicher Caracano, Richard
Kostelanetz & Joel Chadabe, and David Flood.

From Whitney Pow's editorial note:

"There is a sort of transmutable quality to these pieces as they slip from
one form to another, re-defining themselves throughout their
several-minute-plus courses, seeking to create a well of uncertainty in the
listener=92s mind. Questions of form are brought up, burned and then revive=
d
again =97 is Audrey Chen=92s =93Glacial=94 a practice in dissonant 20th-cen=
tury
cello music or is it examining the instrumental wails of the voice, as
haunting and chocolate-rich as a bow pulled over strings?

Is Richard Kostelanetz and Joel Chadabe=92s piece =93Microfictions=94 a ren=
ouncing
of ambiguous buzz-words like =93freedom=94 and =93dieting=94 and how their =
meanings
have faded into incomprehensible pools of sound from over-use? Or is it
instead a discussion of what it means to turn a human voice into something
mechanized, a voice loop on repeat broken down into oddly growling, guttura=
l
sounds?"

Submissions for textsound are currently closed. You can check the

Is anyone interested in interviewing academic Libbie Rifkin for The Argotist Online? Libbie wrote the book 'Career Moves' critiquing certain avant-garde poets for being just as careerist as those in the mainstream. See the following for some info on it
http://uwpress.wisc.edu/books/3260.htm
This will make a good interview topic. Anyone interested?

... or say I agree with Sillman. I'll at least consider Lowell a minor talent rather than a gifted, though priveleged (pity the ruling class) casuality of his dopey era.

But compared to Beckett, who is this Sillman?  Better still, consider the quaint notion of free will ... type ... type ...

Compared to Beckett, Sillman, at best, is minor. Compared to the writings of Samuel Beckett, most, if not all so-called innovation ( mid 20th century lit ... present) seems a hopeless search for novelty. Still, as we're
hurried to say in D.C., why not throw in a little spin? There is a
tunnel at the end of the light ... the quest continues ... why not?
Vispo ... Christo wraps the Washington Monument in kleenex (HA) ... Jasper John's flag is mistaken for a dart board in a local D.C. pub (Jasper Johns, currently at the National Gallery) ...

Sunday March 14th 5- 7pm Tribes is proud to welcome acclaimed pianist,
Mathew Shipp.

"Shipp's playing is like some kind of inverted, dark-matter version of
whatever you think a jazz pianist is going to sound like. - Mark D Fefer,
Seattle Weekly

$15.00 at the door.
All proceeds benefit A Gathering of the Tribes nonprofit.

Mr Shipp has reached the holy grail of jazz in that he possesses a unique
style on his instrument that is all of his own- and he’s one of the few
in jazz that can say so. Mr. Shipp has recorded a lot of albums with many
labels but his 2 most enduring relationships have been with two labels.
In the 1990s he recorded a number of chamber jazz cds with Hatology, a
group of cds that charted a new course for jazz that, to this day, the
jazz world has not realized. In the 2000s Mr Shipp has been curator and
director of the label Thirsty Ear’s “Blue Series” and has also recorded
for them. In this collection of recordings he has generated a whole body
of work that is visionary, far reaching and many faceted . Matthew Shipp
is truly one of the leading lights of a new generation of jazz giants.

Finally! After trials, tribulations, panic attacks, potential coronaries,
all brought about by what Ron Silliman aptly described as the print process
deciding to collaborate on the content of the book, Paul Siegell's *wild
life rifle fire* is out, later than its intended binary date of 01.11.10,
earlier than its cautious rescheduling of 02.28.10. But it's passed its 2nd=
& 3
rd re-proofings with flying colors black & whites, so let's crack a
be-ribboned bottle of champagne upon its spine & launch it now.

Paul Siegell=92s *wild life rifle fire* proves, if proof were needed, that =
the
electrifying art and legacy of Concrete Poetry is not dead!



Siegell=92s book-length *carmen figuratum* not only flashes the reader back=
 to
the heady first days of the Noigrandes Group in S=E3o Paulo and Eugen
Gomringer=92s adventures in VisPo, but even further back to Medieval anagra=
ms,
Greek bucolic poems and Sumerian figure poems. Here we find DaDa dynamite
and typographical talismans freshened by a poet whose native gifts imbue
this exciting work with a whole new sense of "poetic object."



Siegell=92s *haptic heroism* compels the reader to re-examine the basic
elements of a language that we too often take for granted, in the process
creating an energetic and always surprising work of both visual art and
poetry. Not to be missed! =97*Vladimir Slender-Hedge*

Look at the poem "Sunset Debris" by Ron Silliman. That thing drove me crazy=
 (not literal) so I wrote a duplicate poem (just for myself) called "Ron Si=

ever, for you bandwagonners, I also wrote a poem called "Ron Silliman is my=

just for the benefit of the usamericans on the list, i thought i'd sketch
some of the controversy that has gone on up here since the usamerican men's
hockey team beat the canadian team at the vancouver olympics.

we were all surprised by sidney crosby's post game comments. he said

"well, i know it sucks to lose at hockey to our neighbours to the south.
since we lose to them at so many other things and they beat us like their
very own boy at others. but let's get one thing straight, canada. a nation's
pride should have much more to do with how we treat one another in this
society than with the outcome of a hockey game. the idea that winning at
hockey is all that really counts at these olympics is kind of weirding us
out. let's snap out of it, ok? what's important here is not winning but that
canada is a good host to the people of the world and that the people of the
world enjoy these games as something that brings us together in friendship,
peace, and fair and fun competition. canadian national pride should not key
on the outcome of a hockey game so much as on how we realize our best ideals
in canada and show the way for others to do this in their own countries and
internationally, also. so chins up, canada, and let's enjoy the rest of the
games with pride and some perspective on what is really important on this
stage."

ron mclean's jaw dropped to the ground. don cherry called for sidney
crosby's execution, though we don't execute people here even for murder.
cherry was forced to apologize and reduced the sentence to a tour of duty
for crosby to afghanistan. then he showed another dead soldier and cried
again. crosby responded by changing cherry's nickname from 'grapes' to
'drapes' in honour of cherry's 'sartorial splendour', and crosby went on to
say

"let me add that we're all a bit disturbed by the tenor of much of the
patriotism that has blossomed at these games. the olympics should not be a
guise for political propaganda and fundamentalist nationalism hot for
winning at all costs. the low point of canadian hockey was when bobby clarke
chopped valeri kharlamov's ankle almost in two, breaking his ankle and
ruining the russian's best player's illustrious career, in 1972, on route to
canada narrowly winning the first canada-russia matchup of ours and their
best players. from that time, we were seen on the international stage as
barely civilized when it comes to hockey and national pride. we need to
realize this and move on, evolve beyond the mindless savage. i love hockey
and this country as much as the next person, but it's more important to
conduct yourself with a sense of justice and fair play than it is to win at
all costs. canada, can we talk?"

that's about where it's at, at this stage. we're not sure what has gotten
into sidney, really. we're not sure if he's grown up all of a sudden or
fallen victim to foreign propaganda. we are a nation perplexed and on the
verge of elimination from the men's hockey tournament.

wish us luck, as i'm sure you will.

The Editors of KRUPSKAYA Books are very pleased to announce the
publication of two new poetry books for 2010:


Wildfire: a verse essay on obscurity and illumination

by Andrea Brady

WILDFIRE is a verse essay. It is trying to persuade us, to recognize that
certain catastrophes and felicities are not inevitable. It concerns the
history of incendiary devices, of the evolution of Greek fire from a
divine secret which could sustain or destroy empires, into white
phosphorus and napalm; the elliptical fires of the pre-Socratics,
Aristotle's service to Alexander in the fashioning of pyrotechnics, the
burning/blooming/mating bodies of G. H. Schubert and the self-feeding
crowds of Elias Canetti; mechanisms to project fire, to make it burn on
water and stick to wood and skin, to keep it off the walls of the besieged
towns, and what those mechanisms (projection and defense) have done to
geometry; the courts of fire, the legal chamber and the hortus conclusus,
and the margins of ambiguity where it is lobbed with impunity; embedded
nuggets and embedded reporters, the discovery of the chemical element,
industrial tragedy, the resistance of the matchgirls at Bryant & May, the
corruption of Quaker capitalists, washing powder and toothpaste. It is an
etiology of metaphors, "shake-n-bake" and whisky pete and phantom fury. It
is also an argument about obscurity and illumination: WILDFIRE does both,
smokes the bright air and singes the night with trajectories.  And so an
interrogation of writing practices which fume as much as they enlighten.

The Redcoats

by Ryan Murphy

"In one of the most striking lines in THE REDCOATS, Ryan Murphy says, 'I
have cannibalized other moments to invent this one.'  We all do
that, of course, but, as Murphy shows us, the present is still tenuous,
porous.  In these poems you will find the ghosts of what are called
American heroes, Paul Revere, Neil Armstrong, Thomas Paine, washed up
along with other detritus, in a 'Yardsale: one broken promise/after
another.'  'A lawnchair festooned with balloons.'  This is Oppen's 'light
of shipwreck,' an insomniac’s waking dream.  There is a restless sweep to
this book, or, as the speaker tells us, 'I can't stop thinking of the
nothing I want.'"

Screw Hockey Nationalism! I put my vote in for Canada's Coach House Press. =
No Olympian pretensions, just a great list with a more than 40 year history=
 of great hits. As far as I know no USA poet=A0 has been slammed across the=
 shins, de-tongued, or hand broken by anyone from Canada. Maybe drunk under=
 the table. Many of us can regret the loss of George Stanley and Robin Blas=
er to British Columbia, the work of both became better for the move. Tho 'w=
e' have recently greatly benefited from have Rachel Zolf and Lisa Robertson=
 in our eastern and western midst.=20

What is 'national' anymore anyway. Poetry - maybe at its best - is a 'trans=
-territory'. More vocabularies, more choices.=20

... since I lack the proper credentials to enter into the vanguard
chambers of Ron Sillman's mind, and since I'm working on a borrowed
computer, my blog time is nearly nil ...

perhaps Sillman's post was simply about the workings of American poetry.
had nothing to do with Beckett.
still, dramatic monologues are sort of ...
i mean, Seasons in Hell is more or less...

... of course, as chief curator at the bureau of ill-advised verbs, I
could have said that since Beckett, all contemporary writings SEEM
little more than a hopeless quest ... having neglected to say Seems,
having said what i said, it seems that I'm 1st in line for a promotion
due to the very thing I did say.

... or a dramatic monologue on video or film. That Beckett thing with a mouth. That singular grotesque thing that's mouthing words on film. What's the problem with dramatic monologues? If I knew the rationale ... Sillman's point of view, but it seems little more than ... o.k. ... it's his aesthetic ... but if the guy has a problem with dramatic monologues he's giving the finger to Beckett and that's as close to blasphemy as one can get in my stern book of principles.

... or say I agree with Sillman. I'll at least consider Lowell a minor talent rather than a gifted, though priveleged (pity the ruling class) casuality of his dopey era.

But compared to Beckett, who is this Sillman?  Better still, consider the quaint notion of free will ... type ... type ...

Compared to Beckett, Sillman, at best, is minor. Compared to the writings of Samuel Beckett, most, if not all so-called innovation ( mid 20th century lit ... present) seems a hopeless search for novelty. Still, as we're
hurried to say in D.C., why not throw in a little spin? There is a

MERITAGE PRESS ANNOUNCEMENT

Open Palm Press (an imprint of Meritage Press), is pleased to announce the =
series:

Hay(na)ku for Haiti

-- a fundraiser for Haiti, edited by Eileen R. Tabios and blessed by suppor=
t from chapbookpublishing.com.

Poets who write in the hay(na)ku form (about which more information is avai=
lable at http://haynakupoetry.blogspot.com<http://haynakupoetry.blogspot.co=
m/>) have consented to create hay(na)ku for helping Haiti's recovery effort=
s.  The results are to be released as "pocket poem booklets" by Open Palm P=
ress.  Each will be sold for $3.00, reflecting the hay(na)ku's three lines,=
 with all proceeds to be donated for Haiti relief.

The first five of the series are:

#1:     PARTICLE AND WAVE and FROM THE CHAIR, two hay(na)ku sequences by Je=
an Vengua
#2:     On A Pyre: An Ars Poetica by Eileen R. Tabios
#3:     Hay(na)ku for Haiti by Tom Beckett
#4:     when the earth moves by Lars Palm
#5:     After Ren=E9 Depestre's  "My Definition of  Poetry", as translated =
by Edwidge Danticat, with lines at the end by Lafcadio  Hearn by John Bloom=
berg-Rissman

Over time, more releases will occur as it is anticipated that Haiti's relie=
f requirements will be prolonged and deep.  Poets interested in exploring t=
he hay(na)ku through this fundraising effort may contact the series editor =
at MeritagePress@aol.com<mailto:MeritagePress@aol.com>

"H for H" booklets are lovingly produced by chapbookpublishing.com (http://=
chapbookpublisher.com/) on lilac-colored paper to fit, at 2.75" x 4.5 X 2",=
 on an open palm -- ideal for giving engagements.

To order some or all of the series, please send checks made out to "Meritag=
e Press" for $3 per booklet and send to

hey, i've read Sillman.
admittedly, i'm not an authority on Sillman.
that Sillman.
those certain Sillman's that seem to haunt ...

i said
using a simple rhetorical device
WHO
is Ron Sillman???

comparing Ron Sillman
to Samuel Beckett

(since Sillman thrashed Lowell
 it seemed wisest to thrash Sillman
 using Beckett
 since it's impossible to thrash Beckett
 & who could stand such thrashings
 by being so compared?)

... or, as i said earlier --
to further clarify aforementioned sayings
as well as previous postings ...

Robert Lowell
(is worth reading)
i remember Lowell
(i remember reading Lowell)

i've forgotten most of what i've read
i remember mostly
the stuff Lowell imitated
in "Imitatiions."

i rarely think about Sillman
i've forgotten most Lowellisms

i'm presently thinking about myself
& my next cigarette

Look at the poem "Sunset Debris" by Ron Silliman. That thing drove me crazy (not literal) so I wrote a duplicate poem (just for myself) called "Ron Silliman Writes Poetry Like a Four Year Old Child" (never submitted!).  However, for you bandwagonners, I also wrote a poem called "Ron Silliman is my Father" inspired by "The Chinese Notebook" also Ron Silliman.  As for Beckett, "Waiting For Godot" need I say more. Maybe "Endgame."
Each of us has a say.  S. Black

... or a dramatic monologue on video or film. That Beckett thing with a mouth. That singular grotesque thing that's mouthing words on film. What's the problem with dramatic monologues? If I knew the rationale ... Sillman's point of view, but it seems little more than ... o.k. ... it's his aesthetic ... but if the guy has a problem with dramatic monologues he's giving the finger to Beckett and that's as close to blasphemy as one can get in my stern book of principles.

... or say I agree with Sillman. I'll at least consider Lowell a minor talent rather than a gifted, though priveleged (pity the ruling class) casuality of his dopey era.

But compared to Beckett, who is this Sillman?  Better still, consider the quaint notion of free will ... type ... type ...

Compared to Beckett, Sillman, at best, is minor. Compared to the writings of Samuel Beckett, most, if not all so-called innovation ( mid 20th century lit ... present) seems a hopeless search for novelty. Still, as we're
hurried to say in D.C., why not throw in a little spin? There is a
tunnel at the end of the light ... the quest continues ... why not?

Hi - I'll be reading some of my poems Thursday, March 18, 2010 at 8:00 p.m.

Argonaut Series # 55, Poets CornerStudio 353=C2=A0=20
353 West 48th Street - 2nd Floor
(bet. 8th & 9th Aves.)
Closest subway: C train at 50th St.
For reservations, call 212-691-6105
Admission: $10=C2=A0 - includes refreshments and discussion with the poets:

Sarah Barab, Seymour Barab, Rosalie Calabrese, Shari Cornutt, Rebecca Dobso=
n,=20
Ilsa Gilbert, Michael Howley, Anje Katcher,=20
Lucy Sorlucco, Mira J. Spektor, Barry Wallenstein


Publications news: I seem to have jumped the gun on announcing the publicat=
ion of the anthology that will include my poem Rap Flap.=0AIt was due out i=
n '09 but is still on hold, although I'm assured that=0Ait will appear this=
 year. Meanwhile, Marymark Press has put the poem on=0Aa "Give-Out" Sheet, =
along with a poem by Mark Sonnenfeld (the=0Apublisher), and I've had great =
fun handing it out to people, sort of=0Alike a calling card. I'll have copi=
es with me at the March 18th reading.

For those of you who are new to this list and can't attend my readings, her=
e's the poem in question:

=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 RAP FLAP

Me jealous, you jealous,=20
Everybody=E2=80=99s hot for what the other guy has got,
But try to take it, wake it, shake it, fake it, make it any way you can,
Someone=E2=80=99s sure to say you=E2=80=99re overzealous,
Slap you down, snap the lock,
Put you in a jail cell block.
What a life, all this strife just to come out on the short end of the stick
Makes me sick, cuts my heart right to the quick,
But still we do the dance, take a chance on big romance.
Spin the wheel, no big deal
Unless the numbers come up wrong and noone wants to hear your song=20
No matter how loud you sing it. So go on, just wing it.

Skip the rules, let=E2=80=99s not be fools,
All you need to succeed is lots of luck=0A and=0A spunk=20
Plus enough imagination to start a conflagration =E2=80=93=20
Fire in the soul, not the hell hole you came out of.
Have no doubt, keep on shouting all about it
To anyone who=E2=80=99ll pay attention,=20
Give you intervention to ease the tension,
An invention that won=E2=80=99t win a prize but might revise
The way you play the game of gaining fame and fortune,
Get a bigger portion of the pie until you=E2=80=99re high
On life or some other narcotic that=E2=80=99s maybe more exotic.

Yeah, my man, that=E2=80=99s the plan=20
Ever since the world began.
There=E2=80=99s no war or revolution gonna give us a solution
How to speed up evolution
Long as we are hot for what the other guy has got.
So while you wait around for things to change,
Keep an eye on the prize and take it, wake it, shake it, fake it,
Make it any way you can, and all the rest of it be damned!
Next reading date: June 4. Look for info in=0A May.

All best ~ R

Dear All,
Please come to the reading/event for Tuli. Should be lots of fun,
interesting, joyous, kind of like Tuli, right. We have a full roster of
people reading/performing so you should plan to be on stage for
approximately ten minutes. The work you present should either be
something created by Tuli, or inspired by/related to him.


The event is at The Bowery  Poetry Club ( 308 Bowery) on Saturday, March
6th, from 8 PM until 11 PM. Admission is $10, which will go to Tuli to
assist with his medical expenses. As there are other bookings both prior
to and following, we need to run a tight ship.
There is a facebook page publicizing the event, along with flyers around
town. In addition, I've contacted The Voice, The Villager, Time Out, The
NY Post, The NY Times, and several other media outlets. The club will be
filled, we want to put on a good show, one which will honor Tuli.

i can't find any links to the controversy on the google machine, and
since i don't really give a rats ass about sports I haven't been
following the olympics at all and I don't know Sidney Crosby from any
other hockey player other than that I know he was some kind of
wunderkind.
but as a usamerican, I have to say that if you aren't pulling my leg
on this one Jim, that I think Sidney Crosby may have just rocketed
into being my sports hero.

All the Whiskey in Heaven:
Selected Poems of Charles Bernstein
Farrar, Straus and Giroux
(on sale March 2) (300 pp.)
http://epc.buffalo.edu/authors/bernstein/books/all-the-whiskey/

All the Whiskey in Heaven brings together some of Charles Bernstein’s
best work from the past thirty years, an astonishing assortment of
different types of poems. Yet, despite the distinctive differences from
poem to poem, Bernstein’s characteristic explorations of how language
both limits and liberates thought are present throughout. Modulating the
comic and the dark, structural invention with buoyant sound play, these
challenging works give way to poems of lyric excess and striking
emotional range. This is poetry for poetry’s sake, as formally radical
as it is socially engaged, providing equal measures of aesthetic
pleasure, hilarity, and philosophical reflection. Long considered one of
America’s most inventive and influential contemporary poets, Bernstein
reveals himself to be both trickster and charmer.

“Charles Bernstein’s poems resemble each other only in being unexpected.
Simultaneously mad, tragic and hilarious, they seem written to
illustrate the truth of his lines: ‘things are / solid; we stumble,
unglue, recombine.’ All the Whiskey in Heaven is a vast department store
of the imagination.”
—John Ashbery

“Charles Bernstein uses words as a surgeon uses a scalpel. He strips
away the skin and cuts to the bone to reveal reality and—ultimately—to
heal. This essential collection from 30 years of cutting edge work will
confirm Bernstein as our true poet laureate—the voice of a new generation.”
—John Zorn

“For more than thirty years Charles Bernstein has been America’s most
ardent literary provocateur. This long-needed selection of his poetry
gives us a new perspective on his work, for it shows us that the many
forms he has worked in over the years are in fact a single form, the
Bernstein form, and it is unique, the product of an imagination unlike
that of any other contemporary writer. His poems challenge you to think
in unaccustomed ways. They address public matters, private matters,
poetic matters—in other words, all that matters most. And, good Lord,
can they ever make you laugh”
—Paul Auster

“Charles Bernstein is our ultimate connoisseur of chaos, the chronicler,
in poems of devastating satire, chilling and complex irony, exuberant
wit, and, above all, profound passion, of the contradictions and
absurdities of everyday life in urban America at the turn of the
twenty-first century. From such early underground classics as “The
Klupzy Girl,” to the mordant verbal play of “The Lives of the Toll
Takers,” to the great meditation on 9/11 called “Report from Liberty
Street” and the deeply personal ballads and elegies of recent years,
Bernstein’s much awaited Selected Poems displays a formal range,
performative urgency, and verbal dexterity unmatched by other poets of
his generation.”
—Marjorie Perloff

“A perfect introduction to the adventure that is Charles Bernstein’s
work. But even for those of us who have known his irrepressible
inventiveness and engaged humor from the individual books it is a boon
to see here the full range of his exuberant ingenuity in battling
sclerosis of word, mind—and poetry.”
—Rosmarie Waldrop

“This wonderful book confirms Charles Bernstein’s position as the
pre-eminent American poet of mental activity—delineating not simply the
mind as it registers stimuli, but the more radical commitment to mind as
a machine that constantly invents totally new moves and strategies in
the daily battles of perception. All the Whiskey in Heaven captures 30
years of ground breaking and revelatory work.”
—Richard Foreman

Previews

Bookforum
Feb./March 2010
"... a rousing selection from thirty years of work ... Bernstein deftly
shifts moods and tones, but a sense of urgency and a hard-won clarity
are in eveidnce throught this volume."
--David O'Neill

Publisher's Weekly
2/20/10 starred review
This gathering of 30 years worth of work by the prominent
L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E poet and essayist offers a rigorous critique of the art
of poetry itself, which means, among other things, a thorough
investigation of language and the mind. Varied voices and genres are at
play, from a colloquial letter of complaint to the manager of a
Manhattan subway station to a fragmentary meditation on the forces that
underlie the formation of knowledge. Bernstein's attention to the
uncertainty surrounding the self as it purports to exist in poetry—“its
virtual (or ventriloquized)/ anonymity—opens fresh pathways toward
thinking through Rimbaud's dictum that “I is another.” In addition to
philosophical depth—which somehow even lurks beneath statements like
“There is nothing/ in this poem/ that is in any/ way difficult/ to
understand”—a razor-sharp wit ties the book together: “You can't/ watch
ice sports with the lights on!” These exhilarating, challenging poems
raise countless essential questions about the form and function of
poetry. (Mar.)
