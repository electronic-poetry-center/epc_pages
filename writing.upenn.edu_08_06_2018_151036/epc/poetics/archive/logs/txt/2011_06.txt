 there, such as Oakland's Patricia Ikeda (Mushim) and the late Al Robles, w=

Dear friends,

When you have a moment: HIGHLIGHTS of a LIFE WRITING POETRY:

I'm always interested in poets' trajectories. How they progressed. What
events meant something. So, with that, I recently realized I should proba=
bly
take a look at myself for a second, see what's what.=20

How am I doing while doing this thing that I'd never want to stop doing?

landscape, this time from the vantage of the idea of the painter. Each line
is drawn from a singularity in text to its possible extent in the world, as
Sam has culled it from one biographer looking at an other. That other being
the painter C=E9zanne, from the eye and mouth of his friend Joachim Gasquet=

CALL FOR PAPERS FOR A SYMPOSIUM ON WILLIAM BRONK

Papers are being sought for a symposium on the life and work of William Bro=
nk (1918-1999).

The symposium will be held in New York City in spring 2012, to coincide wit=
h the appearance of Bursts of Light: The Collected Later Poems of William B=
ronk.

Papers from the conference will be the basis for a collection of essays to =
be published by Talisman House.

The talks and readings making up the symposium will be recorded and then st=
reamed on the Internet from a dedicated website.


While it is expected that established poets and scholars will take part in =
this symposium, younger poets, critics and scholars are very strongly encou=
raged to make presentations. How William Bronk can be read in our current t=
ime is a concern of this event.


ABSTRACTS OF 1-2 PAGES SHOULD BE SENT TO:
Edward Foster, TalismanEd@aol.com
and
Burt Kimmelman, Kimmelman@njit.edu.

William Bronk was one of the foremost poets of the twentieth century. His w=
ork has been praised widely. The attention is remarkable given that he spen=
t most of his life secluded in Hudson Falls, New York and abjuring literary=
 politics, often turning down requests for readings and the like. Neverthel=
ess, he did receive the American Book Award (the year before it became the =
National Book Award) and the Lannan Prize; and he did read an occasional po=
em at Governor Mario Cuomo's first inauguration. The Governor's invitation =
came not merely because the Borough of the Bronx was named after Bronk's an=
cestor who farmed a good deal of that land.

In the 1970s and 1980s two prominent scholarly journals devoted entire issu=
es to discussions of Bronk's poetry and essays. In 1998 the first critical =
book on Bronk appeared, which was then followed by another two years later,=
 and more since then, all by prominent scholars of American poetry. Major e=
ssays on Bronk continue to appear regularly in journals.

William Bronk's work is known for its evocations of the New York landscape,=
 as well as for its meditations on the ancient Incan and Mayan cultures, wh=
ich were prompted by his travels through Latin America. Yet Bronk is most k=
nown, and admired, for his inquiries into the nature of reality and knowing=
. Paul Auster once wrote of his work (in the Saturday Review, once Bronk ha=
d begun to attract a lot of attention): "Bronk's poetry stands as an eloque=
nt and often beautiful attack on all our assumptions, a provocation, a monu=
ment to the questioning mind."

The value of Bronk's work is still well known among older poets and scholar=
s, yet there is a profound need for a younger readership. Early on, Bronk's=
 poems appeared in the now famous Black Mountain Review and Origin magazine=
s, and he was an important part of the midcentury avant-garde that was memo=
rialized in the 1960 anthology The New American Poetry. Yet, as David Clipp=
inger's book on Bronk documents, he was removed from the anthology at the e=
leventh hour because its editor, Donald Allen, couldn't fit his work into a=
ny of the "schools" of poetry he had concocted for the publication. Neverth=
eless, Bronk is, arguably, key to our understanding of American letters, an=
d particularly the post-World War II new poetry and thought. Cid Corman, a =
prolific poet and the editor of Origin, acknowledged Bronk as being " the t=
hread that binds all the issues together" (quoted from The Gist of Origin).=
  The fact that Bronk was the final poet cut from Donald Allen's anthology,=
 and that Bronk does not appear in the Norton or other widely used antholog=
ies today, compels this symposium as a way to put Bronk back before the eye=
s of a broader readership, and a conference on his work and life, at this t=
ime, might ultimately address a reassessment of the twentieth-century liter=
ary canon.

Praise for the work of William Bronk:

"A work that demands to be read." -Saturday Review * "A brilliant poetry." =
-George Oppen (winner of the Pulitzer Prize) * "One of our finest . . . poe=
ts." -The New York Times Book Review * "A poet of great distinction." -Smal=
l Press Review * "Bronk is an acquired taste. I recommend you acquire it." =
-Library Journal * "He is brilliant." -Southwest Review *

Jesse,

I have never been to Asia, but I have spent all of my adult life
reading and studying Vedic Sanskrit, Buddhist Sanskrit, and Pali.  I
teach the literature of these languages at an art school, where I also
teach things like poetry and poetics, aesthetics, etc.   I think I
understand what you are saying about "American Buddhists," but I think
that this "look at me" syndrome that you pinpoint may not be so much a
matter of American-ness or Buddhist-ness, but rather of poet-ness.

Isn't there a lot of "look at me" going on in poetry in general,
anywhere?  I say this as a person who no longer writes poetry. Now I
only translate it.  I do not call myself a poet.  I call myself a
Sanskritist and a translator.  There are no [or at least no direct]
"look at me" moments when you are a translator, right?

Well, anyway, as for me, when I translate, it is not about me.  It is
about the text.  Isn't that attitude kind of Buddhist?  A translator
is or aims to be a kind of zero, like Buddhist shunyata.

Just a thought.

George Thompson

Actually, there are, though I don't know if they would consider
themselves poets [devotees, maybe, more modest than poets].  I have a
copy somewhere , which I cannot find, of a Hindu poem called "The Shri
Khrist Gita."   The author's name is of course not mentioned [well, in
any case, I don't know it].  In any case, this translates as "The Song
of the Lord Christ." It is modelled on the Bhagavad Gita, of course,
which means "The Song of the Lord (Krishna)."

"Jesus loves me.  This I know, because the Bible tells me so."

"Krishna loves me.  This I know because the Gita tells me so."

So, there it is.

No Press is proud to announce the publication of

COPYS
By Craig Dworkin

'My idea for these poems is that they be like cigarettes.  On the one hand,
briefly intense and repaying as much focused  contemplation as you want to
give them -- each is in fact composed  according to a rigorous and elided
formal logic -- but then also,  at the very same time, merely discardable
amusements: quickly  read and easily forgotten, thrown away without a second
thought  as soon as they are finished.' -- Craig Dworkin

Originally published in the UK by Matchbox in May 2007, No press is proud to
return this rarely-seen edition to print.

Published in a limited edition of 50 copies (25 of which are for sale) each
copy consists of 34 loose cards in a hand-typed envelope.

Copies are available for $8.00 each (including postage).

To order, please contact derek beaulieu at derek@housepress.ca

There's also, of course, a rich and robust tradition of virtuosic "freestyling" in the hip-hop scene. It may arguably be even more influential and important than the work of Steve Benson (whose work is, yes, astonishing). ("important", that is, only if you care about black people)

If you can stand the horror, there's Shohei Ooka's novel _Fires on the
Plain_. Kon Ichikawa's film omits the Christian theme, but it's there in
the book. More recently, Theresa Hak Kung Cha's _Dictée_ is an
explicitly Catholic reading of its author's life and life history as a
Korean. One of the illustrations in the book, for instance, is a picture
of the nationalist martyr Yu Guan Soon (1903-1920), known in Korea as
"the Joan of Arc of Korea." Another is a photograph of St. Thérèse of
Lisieux costumed as St. Joan, and a third is a photograph of a group of
Koreans being executed by a traditional Japanese method: crucifixion.
One consequence of that imagery and the memories accompanying it is that
in South Korea today, thousand-year-old Buddhist temples are being
destroyed by fires of unknown origin and almost every village lies in
the shadow of a great big church.

Lots of Asian poets write and have written about the West and what it mig=
ht
mean, but you're probably not going to find a mirror-image reciprocality =
in
East and West turning each other into receptacles of mystic wisdom.
Christianity is so well ensconced in Korea, Taiwan, Hongkong, the
Philippines, and so on that it's not going to have much "mystic" cachet t=
o
it (that said, a lot of mainland Chinese seem to look to Christianity as =
a
way to put themselves in line with the "advanced" and / or democratic Wes=
t;
I don't know of any poetry written from this angle, though).

Back-channel me if you're interested in seeing a translation (not mine) o=
f a
poem by HK poet Wong Leung Wo about Santa Claus, which will be published =
in
a pocket-size chap for the Hong Kong International Poetry Nights this Nov=
ember.

First Annual Writers=E2=80=99 Conference. Hunter College.

By Doug Holder

As you would expect whenever I am in New York City I do a lot of walking.=
 As
it happens I was invited to be on a small press panel at the First Annual=

Writer=E2=80=99s Conference at Hunter College in NYC, founded by Lewis Bu=
rke
Frumkes. It was a picture perfect day in June, so I walked from my brothe=
r=E2=80=99s
apartment on 20th Street in the Chelsea section of the city, to 68th and
Lexington=E2=80=94the home of Hunter College. I stopped at my favorite di=
ner on the
way=E2=80=94the =E2=80=9CMalibu Diner=E2=80=99=E2=80=94an unlikely name f=
or an eatery in the middle of a
gritty thoroughfare. I ordered my lox and bagel and listened to the
well-honed staccato chatter of a counterman from central casting with a r=
egular:


=E2=80=9CWhat=E2=80=99s it gonnna be sonny-boy?=E2=80=9D
=E2=80=9C Sunnyside up- don=E2=80=99t make =E2=80=98em weep.=E2=80=9D
=E2=80=9C Gotcha. What=E2=80=99s your pick tonight?=E2=80=9D
=E2=80=9CYankees.=E2=80=9D
=E2=80=9C Not a china man=E2=80=99s chance.=E2=80=9D

But I digress. Since my own panel was not until 2PM, I had a veritable
literary buffet of speakers and panels to sample from. On the Memoir Pane=
l
listing I noticed Malachy McCourt author of: =E2=80=9CSinging Him My Song=
=E2=80=9D and other
authors were participating. We had McCourt at the Somerville News Writers=

Festival last year=E2=80=94so I wanted to drop by. Also on the panel were=
 Sidney
Offit=E2=80=94curator emeritus of the George Polk Journalism Awards, Patr=
icia Volk
author of the memoir =E2=80=9C Stuffed,=E2=80=9D Sir Gilbert Levine =E2=80=
=9CThe Pope=E2=80=99s Maestro,=E2=80=9D
and Lucette Lagnado, =E2=80=9CThe Man in the White Sharkskin Suit.=E2=80=9D=


As always I found McCourt to be a genuine and inspirational speaker. McCo=
urt
offered his advice to memoir writers in the audience. He feels the memoir=
ist
should write about what he or she is truly =E2=80=9Cashamed of.=E2=80=9D =
All of the
panelists agreed on the importance of documentation=E2=80=94the inclusion=
 of
dialogue to make a more compelling memoir. McCourt, a fine dramatist in h=
is
own right, emphasized that the memoir provides freedom to dramatize; it i=
s
all about impressions; it does not have to be strictly factually accurate=
.

Lunch was held in the faculty dining room that had a panoramic view of th=
e
city. The speaker was Nelson DeMille, a popular mystery-action writer, wh=
o
penned such novels as =E2=80=9CThe Charm School,=E2=80=9D =E2=80=9CThe Go=
ld Coast,=E2=80=9D and many others.
In his conversation with the audience he recounted his years as a major
player on the literary landscape.

He was asked by an audience member if he ever was involved with
screenwriting in Hollywood. He said, =E2=80=9CWriters get more respect in=
 New York.
Hollywood eats you up. In Hollywood you are simply a writer for hire. You=

have very little control of your work." When he worked with Dino de
Laurentis on a script, he found that after 6 months and all the various
interventions by other writers, etc=E2=80=A6 he didn=E2=80=99t know what =
he was writing
about. He recalled: "When I got back to New York I felt dirty. I felt I
needed to take a bath.=E2=80=9D

DeMille reads a lot of non-fiction to research his books, but he rarely
reads other novels=E2=80=94especially when he is working. =E2=80=9CHe sai=
d, =E2=80=9CReading novels
can skew you=E2=80=94really mess up your own work.=E2=80=9D The author fe=
els it is best to
control his own voice and style when he is writing.

The small press panel was well-attended and presided over by the well-kno=
wn,
New York writer and co-author of =E2=80=9CWhat May Have Been=E2=80=9D (Ce=
rvena Barva Press)
Susan Tepper. On the panel were yours truly, Steve Glines of the ISCS Pre=
ss
and Wilderness House Press, Jim Schuette of the Marion St. Press, and Roa=

Lynn, author of "Farewell Rio.=E2=80=9D We all discussed the opportunitie=
s small
presses and little magazines offer the author outside of the mainstream
publishing industry. There were also frank discussions of self-publishing=
,
and a review some the new publishing technologies.

Finally Susan Tepper and I went to the =E2=80=9CBirth of a Book Panel=E2=80=
=9D that was
presided over by Jerry Gross, the author of =E2=80=9CEditors on Editing.=E2=
=80=9D Also on
the panel were Stephanie Abou agent, Foundry Literary & Media, Hilma
Wolitzer author of =E2=80=9CSummer Reading=E2=80=9D, Pamela Dorman, edito=
r of Pamela Dorman
Books, and Doug Jones, Senior V.P. of Sales at Harper Collins.

Jerry Gross, the consummate book doctor talked about how editing is more
than marking up the page but involves what =E2=80=9Ccould=E2=80=9D be on =
the page. He
emphasized the creativity of a good editor.

Abou, the agent, talked about the importance of the query letter=E2=80=94=
it should
be short and sweet and to the point. And make sure you proof it as well a=
s
you would your beloved manuscript. A poorly written query letter will sto=
p
an agent in his or her tracks.

Jones, the Sales V.P. at Harper Collins talked about the importance of in=
die
bookstores to create a buzz. The book sales they create are secondary=E2=80=
=94but if
the independent likes the book, and gets excited about it=E2=80=94then sa=
les in
general will often gain momentum.

Hilma Wolitzer had an interesting anecdote about her start as a writer ma=
ny
years ago. It seems she gave a short story to a friend of hers who slippe=
d
into her jacket pocket. The friend was wearing that same jacket at a
cocktail party where she was chatting with the agent of John Steinbeck. S=
he
handed the agent Wolitzer=E2=80=99s short story=E2=80=94the agent read it=
-loved it=E2=80=94 and
eventually she got her first book published.

After the event I had dinner at an Italian joint in the =E2=80=98hood wit=
h family
and friends. Later I saw the sun set amidst a canyon of skyscrapers; I sa=
w a
fat guy with a fat cigar argue with a skinny cabdriver sporting a flowing=

book competition.

We will publish two books of innovative writing, one each of fiction and
poetry.

Submissions for the 2012 book contest open June 1, 2011. Deadline is Monday,
August 15, 2011.

Subito Press is a nonprofit literary publisher based in the Creative Writing
Department at the University of Colorado at Boulder. We look for innovative
fiction and poetry that at once reflects and informs the contemporary human
condition, and we promote new literary voices as well as work from
previously published writers. Subito Press encourages and supports work that
challenges already-accepted literary modes and devices.

Submit manuscripts of up to 70 pages of poetry or up to 100 pages of (double
spaced) fiction along with a $20 reading fee (make checks payable to Subito
Press) and an SASE for notification of results. Manuscripts should include
two cover sheets: one with title only, the other with title, author's name,
address, e-mail, and phone number. All submissions will be judged
anonymously by the creative writing faculty at the University of Colorado;
friends, relatives, and former students of University of Colorado creative
writing faculty are not eligible. Simultaneous submissions are ok; please
notify Subito immediately if your ms. is accepted elsewhere.

I genuinely wish I could be there, and will be in spirit, thought,

Thanks Adam, for the reference to freestyling. And yes,  I do think it's ex=
tremely important and amazing, and I will certainly talk about it as I part=
icularly want to address the richness of culturally diverse improvising tra=
ditions, and also any ways in  which the experimental improvisation scene m=
ight have been excluding with regard to gender and race. The editors asked =
me  to historicise improvising with regard to  the text-sound movement whic=
h they knew I had written about before. Which connects with what you were s=
aying, because I do think text-sound, and the way it was conceptualised in =
the 60s-80s,  was rather blind  with regard to issues to do with gender and=
 ethnicity,  and that critique will be central to  my discussion of it. I a=
m  sure, too, that there will  be other contributors to the book who are ex=
perts in hip hop , and who will talk about freestyling in detail, especiall=
y since one of the editors is African American.

Also oral improvisation will only be one of the areas I will be addressing,=
 the other will be computerised text generation which I see as one of the c=
ontemporary evolution of improvised performance. The main  text generators/=
improvisor  I hope to talk about in detail is African American D Fox Harrel=
l, whose work is brilliant  in the way it uses new technologies to explore =
different ways of thinking about ethnicity, the effects of globalisation, a=
nd many other cultural issues.

The Evanston Art Center and Borderbend Arts Collective present =93Trees
Speaking to the Wind,=94 a nature-themed performance event at the =
Evanston Art
Center on Monday, June 20, 2011, with poetry readings by Allan Johnston =

Tim Hunt, as well as phonography performed by an ensemble. This event =
also
commemorates the 38th World Environment Day. This event is supported by
funding from Poets & Writers, and it is free and open to the public, all
ages.=20

TIM HUNT
A fourth generation native of Northern California, Tim Hunt was born in
Calistoga and raised primarily in Sebastopol, two small towns north of =
San
Francisco.  As a boy he also identified strongly with the Lake County =
region
of his father=92s family, where his aunt taught him =93I Can Tell You =
Are a
Logger =91Cause You Stir Your Coffee with Your Thumb,=94 while a =
rockabilly
cousin offered =93Heartbreak Hotel.=94  Before heading east to school, =
he also
discovered such wonders as =93Section 43=94 by Country Joe and the Fish. =
 In his
teen years he dreamed of playing guitar like Carl Perkins and being able =
to
sing like Fred Neil.

Educated at Cornell University, He has taught American literature at =
several
schools, including Washington State University and Deep Springs College. =
=A0He
is currently Professor of English at Illinois State University, in =
Normal,
Illinois.=A0 He and his wife Susan, a respiratory therapist, have two
children: John, a visual artist, and Jessica, a musician and =
composer.=A0 Hunt
once claimed to have been the rhythm guitarist in the band Derridean =
Debris,
though to the best of his knowledge such a band never existed.=A0 He is,
though, fortunate enough to own a fine 12-string that he promises =
himself he
will eventually learn to play as well as it deserves.

Hunt=92s poetry has been widely published in magazines, and he has =
published
the chapbook Lake County Diamond. He has also been awarded the Chester =
H.
Jones Prize for the poem =93Lake County Elegy.=94=A0 Fault Lines is his =
first
full-length collection.=A0 His scholarly publications include =
Kerouac=92s
Crooked Road: Development of a Fiction and the five-volume edition The
Collected Poetry of Robinson Jeffers. http://www.tahunt.com=20

ALLAN JOHNSTON
Allan Johnston=92s poems have been published in Poetry, Poetry East, =
Rhino,
and over sixty other journals.  He is the author of Tasks of Survival =
and
Northport, a collection of poems about his life in the Pacific Northwest =
in
the 1970s, and a recipient of an Illinois Arts Council Fellowship, a
Pushcart Prize nomination (2009), and First Prize in the 2010 Outrider =
Press
Literary Anthology Poetry Contest.  He has also received honorable =
mentions
or placed as a finalist in contests featured by New Letters, The Academy =
of
American Poets, Salute to the Arts, and the Roberts Writing Foundation.  =


Originally from California, he earned his M.A. in Creative Writing and =
his
Ph.D. in English from the University of California, Davis, and now =
teaches
writing and literature at Columbia College and DePaul University in
Chicago.=A0 He currently serves as a reader for the Illinois Emerging =
Poets
competition and for Word River, and is editor of the Journal for the
Philosophical Study of Education.=A0 In the past he has worked as a
sheepherder, shake splitter, roofer, forest fire fighter, Indian cook, =
and
photographer, among other occupations.=20

I am doing an article on documentary poetry, and I'm looking for recent exa=
mples of critics who reject docu-po per se - for whatever reason. Maybe you=
 have read such an article (blog post, FB post, etc.)? Or maybe you are one=
 of those critics? If so, I'd like to hear from you.

Any leads greatly appreciated!

long run his own lauded independent small press and literary magazine
"Ibbetson Street" from his home in Somerville, Mass. Holder has long admi=
red
the great small press collections at the University of Buffalo and Brown
University, and has always wanted to bring books of poetry, novels,
etc..from the vast and eclectic sea of independent presses from this coun=
try

  The New Inquiry is delighted to announce the digital debut of
  REANIMAITON LIBRARY
  www.reanimationlibrary.org



The Reanimation Library is a small, independent Presence Library open to
the public at 143 Union St. in Brooklyn, NY. It is a collection of books
that have fallen out of routine circulation and been acquired for their
visual content. Outdated and discarded, they have been culled from
thrift stores, stoop sales, and throw-away piles, and given new life as
a resource for artists, writers, cultural archeologists, and other
interested parties.

For nearly a year, The Reanimation Library has been a destination and
resource to the editors of TNI (as seen in our occasional series, "/Lost
& Found
<http://thenewinquiry.us1.list-manage.com/track/click?u=96f3ded25381277c8637b0c9b&id=c1946e3134&e=7e15f71216>"/),

Hi,

In a little over six weeks, to mark our 20th anniversary, we'll be
putting on our fifth annual Welcome to Boog City poetry and music
festival, featuring poets, musicians, and playwrights performing at
four venues, in two boroughs, over five days, from Fri. Aug. 5-Tues.
Aug. 9. Among the over 50 performers taking part are poets Cara
Benson, Charles Borkhuis, Lee Ann Brown, Bruce Covey, Alan Gilbert,
Brenda Iijima, Ish Klein, Mark Lamoureux, Tanya Larkin, Douglas
Piccininni, Kimberly Ann Southwick, Mary Austin Speaker, and Jill
Stengel.

Ten days before the event, we'll be putting out the festival issue of
Boog City. This issue will feature pieces on some of the performers
and a full schedule, illustrated with images of each of the performers.

Advertising in the festival issue of Boog City means you will reach
more than 3,000 readers, poetry lovers, and small press aficionados
throughout the East Village, other targeted areas of lower Manhattan;
Williamsburg and Greenpoint, Brooklyn; as well as bonus distribution
at Boog City events. That's an increase of 33.3% over our regular
issues for no additional cost. And, since this issue is also a program
for the festival, readers will give it a closer read as they check to
see who's up later on that day and throughout the festival.

Boog City continues to offer our special Small Press Ad Rates. That
means when you advertise with us you will save 50% off of our regular
display ad rates.

      * Full Page        $250
      * Half-Page       $130
      * Quarter-Page   $70
      * Eighth-Page     $40

Here is a link to our full rate card:

http://boogcity.com/ad-rates.pdf

As I mentioned in previous emails to you, Boog City focuses on getting
the word out about lesser-known artists, be they poets, prose writers,
musicians, painters, photographers, or cartoonists. Each month we
publish poetry from the likes of Anselm Berrigan, Renee Gladman, Lisa
Jarnot, Eileen Myles, Kristin Prevallet, and Edwin Torres, alongside
our Urban Folk music section, small press book reviews, political
commentary, art, comics, and photographs.

We look forward to working with you to bring your message to the local
arts community to increase awareness and sales of your publications in
the New York area.

as ever,
David

In the spring of 1962, poet Charles Olson descended upon an experimental
college in rural Vermont to read from=A0The Maximus Poems=A0and=A0The Distances,

enthralling and indispensable annotated transcript that celebrates the
intersection of Olson's poetics and a hopeful moment in American education.

thoroughly it dispels any incense or stale reverence in the

Color me old-fashioned, but I remember when Libraries, especially University
Libraries, used to buy books from small presses in order to support them. It
was a win-win outcome for both. Guaranteed sales to even a small number of
University Libraries was often sufficient to subsidize, & thus allow, the
publication of a book; & those small purchases eventually created the "great
small press collections" that the Libraries now hold & continue, by further
purchases, to make even greater.

Jane Joritz-Nakagawa=92s n*otational* furthers an Identity Positioning Syst=
em
that resembles in elegance and efficacy the memory theaters of the ancients=
.
Each page finds the margin where transition is meaning and each sensational
flutter awaits its name. Intensity is all: =93Power lines on the range.=94 =
She
never lets the words down, nor fails to put them accurately where most
needed. =97 *Bill Berkson*





In her sixth book of poems, Jane Joritz-Nakagawa breaks fresh ground,
finding new ways to see and restructure her world. In fragments of
observations teetering precariously and falling into the unexpected, Jane
sees into the backside of social and cultural relations, while at the same
time undermining them. This is the =93border between identity and
non-identity=94. Here, we wake up =93in an unfamiliar language=94, and find=
 that
it is our own. =97 *Eric Selland*





Jane Joritz-Nakagawa=92s *notational* puts consciousness through an egg sli=
cer
and allows the slices to slip away and initiate poetic investigations withi=
n
the environments that have come to define the fractured backdrop of the
everyday: empty buses, the repletions of consumer overload, bamboo groves,
eyes that gaze at each other (untranslatable), the horrible vivisection of
animals, selves that melt and bend through a social stage in which the locu=
s
of identity is always the center of multiple controls.  This poetry is
timely, intelligent and beautiful =97 and though the investigations involve=
d
often move through deeply unsettling territory, the ingenuity of the poetry
itself displays the imaginative *promesse de bonheur* that keeps the
loophole opened:  =93grim tasks of survival do not bring happiness / yet th=
e
wind=94. =97 *Trane DeVore*

Dear Doug and everyone.  I don't know how many offers to donate copies
of ahadada books come my way--either in the form of people who wish to
be sent review copies that later show up in their on-line
stores--usually sans review--or in this manner.  To everyone out
there--First please consider BUYING copies of so-called small press
books for your library, your writers conference, your etc. and etc..
That would sorely help the future of new literature and alternative
publishing, and help us from going broke pissing postage money into the
wind.  Or, perhaps you could at least cover postage?

Thanks a lot.

Jess

In 1936 and '37, Gottfried Benn came under heavy attack in the Nazi
media for writing verse unworthy of a Nazi, and at

http://theartpart.jonathanmorse.net/?p=389

I blog about the book where the heaviest attack appears. I don't say
anything directly about Benn, but the post may interest readers in
departments where people believe the purpose of literature is to provide
role models.

Poet Linda Lerner: =E2=80=9CTakes Guts and Years Sometimes=E2=80=9D

Interview by Doug Holder

Recently New York City poet Linda Lerner visited the Boston area and
revisited my Somerville Community Access TV show =E2=80=9CPoet to Poet: W=
riter to
Writer.=E2=80=9D Linda has taught English in the City College of New York=
 system for
many years, and has lived the life of poet. Her first priority is her
writing and has lived her life to accommodate this, often at the expense =
of
financial security. She has been published widely, and has just released =
an
accomplished collection of poetry titled =E2=80=9CTakes Guts and Years So=
metimes.=E2=80=9D
(NYQ Books).

Doug Holder: You lived near the World Trade Center when it was bombed in
2001. How did this tragic event affect your writing?

Linda Lerner: Oh, it definitely did. I had no experience of war like most=

people in New York. And it felt like I was in a war zone. And for the fir=
st
time I had an idea what people must go through to see everything destroye=
d:
homes destroyed=E2=80=94people crying in the street. I think it gave me a=
 much
broader perspective. My father was born in Russia and escaped at one poin=
t
because of the Pogroms against the Jews. He often spoke of what it was li=
ke
to be driven out of his home. Now I knew what it felt like.

DH: After 9/11 you were part of that tragic diaspora. You lived in the
Chelsea Hotel for a while, right?

LL: Yeah. The day it happened I was teaching a class at the New York City=

College of Technology and in the middle of the class the sirens went off.=

They always go off in Manhattan=E2=80=94you don=E2=80=99t think anything =
of them=E2=80=94it is part
of the norm. And then a student came in late and said a plane hit the Wor=
ld
Trade Center. This was a student who was always late, so I figured it was=
 a
great story=E2=80=94excuse. But the siren didn=E2=80=99t stop and then so=
meone rushed in to
tell us what happened. They made us leave the building. I couldn=E2=80=99=
t go back
home to Brooklyn because the bridges were closed. So a bunch of us spent =
the
night at a colleague=E2=80=99s apartment=E2=80=94sleeping on the floor. W=
e called hotels,
but they wouldn=E2=80=99t take us. The Chelsea had a room, and I was ther=
e for a
couple of weeks. It is a wonderful place=E2=80=94with such a rich literar=
y and
artistic history. I have a long poem about my experience.

DH: You have been long associated with the New York Quarterly which
published your new collection =E2=80=9CTakes Guts and Years Sometime.=E2=80=
=9D The Quarterly
is now run by Raymond Hammond. Can you tell us a bit about the magazine, =
and
your history with it?

LL: Yes. NYQ started their imprint in 2009. This was the late William
Packard=E2=80=99s idea. He was the longtime editor before Hammond but he =
got sick.
He couldn=E2=80=99t put out the magazine anymore. Hammond has done a wond=
erful job
with the Quarterly=E2=80=94he made it his personal project.

When I got out of college in the 70=E2=80=99s, my background in literatur=
e stopped
around 1950. I knew I had to do something=E2=80=94someone suggested a poe=
try class
with William Packard at The New School. So I took two classes with him. O=
ne
was a poetry class, one was literature. I never submitted a poem before. =
I
was new at this, but I gave him a poem. He didn=E2=80=99t think it was a =
masterpiece
(Laugh). I couldn=E2=80=99t take criticism at the time and I never submit=
ted
another. But I stayed in the class and learned a lot about poetry. And th=
en
I started helping out with the magazine. When I started contributing a fe=
w
years later he started to take my work. I interviewed Hayden Carruth for =
one
issue. Carruth was a fascinating man. Absolutely brilliant. He smoked
non-stop, popped sleeping pills, drank a lot. I was really nervous about =
the
interview because at one point when I started it he said, =E2=80=9CThat=E2=
=80=99s a stupid
question.=E2=80=9D But as the interview went on it worked out very well.
I love the magazine especially its emphasis on craft and craft interviews=
.

DH: I read somewhere that you said you never compromised for a paycheck. =
Can
you explain?

LL: I never let a job take over my entire life. I always had time to writ=
e.
I wound up with a series of college teaching jobs that left me with time =
to
write. In the end I may pay for it when I get really old. I never got
involved in the politics of a job. I try to do a good job, but I always h=
ave
to have time to write. It=E2=80=99s hard out there meeting NYC rents, etc=
=E2=80=A6

DH: As a daughter of immigrants (Your father was from Russia) did this gi=
ve
you outsider status or a different view of contemporary American society?=


LL: In all honesty it wasn=E2=80=99t until father died in 1985, did I sta=
rt to
identify more with him. As a child I was embarrassed by him, by his accen=
t,
his lack of education, by his old fashioned ways. I guess after he died I=

drew closer to him because he was not around to argue with. It was very h=
ard
for a bohemian artist child like me to deal with an old world father.

DH: What steered you to this sort of boho/arist/poet lifestyle?

LL; I don=E2=80=99t know to be quite honest. When I grew up I was the odd=

person=E2=80=94different. I was always getting in trouble=E2=80=94the bla=
ck sheep so to
speak. I really wasn=E2=80=99t aware of what I was until I got older. The=

rebelliousness was always there.


DH: Some of your works deal with gentrification in the city. Do you think=

Jane Jacobs=E2=80=99 vision of the city as urban village, with unique com=
munities=E2=80=94is
long past?

LL: I don=E2=80=99t like what has been happening to the cities. First of =
all the
rents are so high the middle class is moving out. They aren=E2=80=99t abl=
e to afford
it. I remember a couple of years ago I went down to Little Italy and it
didn=E2=80=99t seem like the Little Italy I knew. Where I live in Carol G=
ardens in
Brooklyn it still retains some of the old world charm, but it is rapidly
changing. Gentrification is taking away from the charm and sense of commu=
nity.

DH: It used to be easier to live the artist=E2=80=99s life.

LL; Back in the 70=E2=80=99s for an artist to live. My first apartment wa=
s in
Greenwich Village. It is very hard now. The economy is bad. When I got ou=
t
of college there were many jobs you could get. I took a civil service job=
 as
a social worker. Right now many of my friends are rooming together in sma=
ll
apartments to make a go of it. It=E2=80=99s not like the old days. Young =
people are
moving home with their parents. A lot of the small bookstores have closed=
=E2=80=94we
have the big chains and even they are closing.

DH: Is the poetry scene still thriving in NYC?

LL: Oh yeah. On any given night there are 7 or 8 venues. The scene change=
s
all the time. Even more so now with all the online venues.

DH: Do you think online magazines are as good as print? Does it mean the
same thing to be published in both?

LL: People say so but I prefer print. But there are some good online
magazines. Everything seems to be moving to the virtual world.

DH: It=E2=80=99s a brave new world.

LL: Yes it is.

June 2011

The Italian experimental poets Luca Artioli, Andrea Garbin, Fabio
Barcellandi and their translator Dave Lordan will be reading in venues
across Ireland as part of a national tour to promote the book
"Poethree : New Italian Voices," published by Edizioni Thauma in 2011.

Thursday, 23 June 2011,
at 8:00 p.m.,
Village Hall,
Knightsbridge Retirement Village,
in Trim, Ireland.

Friday 24 June 2011,
at 8:00 p.m., in the
Summer Writers' Extravaganza of
the kitchen@the museum,
Galway, Ireland.

Saturday, 25 June 2011,
at 9:00 p.m.,
at Castle Bar in
Derry, Northern Ireland.

Monday, 27 June 2011, at the
=D3 Bh=E9al Reading Series in
Long Valley Pub,
Cork, Ireland.

1.)  Luca Artioli was born in Mantova in 1976, where he still lives.
He was the creator and co-founder of the Confraternita dell' "Uva," a
group of 25 writers from Mantova, Modena, and Como.  He=92s currently a
member of the "Movement from the Underground," a literary group for
the union of the arts, based in Montichiari (BS).

His official website is http://www.lucaartioli.it/

His books are "Fragili Apparenze" (Apparent fragilities), published by
TCM Editions, Mantova in 2005; and "Suture" (Sutures), published by
Edizioni Fara in 2011.

2.)  Fabio Barcellandi was born in Brescia in 1968.  He is part of the
group of poets and artists that "quickens" the literary meetings at
the coffee bar Galeter in Montichiari, where he has performed on
numerous occasions, from his tentative beginnings to the latest
missives.  He is from under the earth.  What they say of him is that
he walks hand in hand with death, whistling.

He has published two collections of poems :

"Parole alate" (Winged words), published by Cicorivolta editions 2007;
and "Nero, l'inchiostro" (Black Ink), published by Montag editions in
2008.

3.)  Andrea Garbin lives and works in the province of Mantova.  He has
published his poetry as "Il senso della musa" (The sense of the Muse),
Aletti 2007; and "Latex," published by Fara in 2009.  His
short-stories are included in the anthologies "Per natale non esco"
(For Christmas I don=92t go out), published by TranseuropaLibri 2008)
and "Il rumore degli occhi" (The noise of the eyes), published by
Edizioni Creativa in 2009.

4.)  Dave Lordan's latest collection is "Invitation to a Sacrifice"
(Salmon Poetry 2010) which was called by THE IRISH TIMES "an act of
cultural resistance, as brilliant on the page as it must surely be in
performance."  Eigse Riada theatre company produced his first play,
"Jo Bangles," at the Mill Theatre, Dundrum in 2010.  Forthcoming are
"Assassin for Higher" from Wurm Press in November 2011 and his first
collection of short stories "Out of My Head" due out from Salmon
Publishing in Summer 2012.

I've been trying to get my library to purchase small print lit mags, w/litt=
le headway. The problem is that, under state purchasing rules, the "unit" (=
library, in this case) must invoice the "vendor." As we know, w/little mags=
, you send a check for 15 bucks to John Doe editor who puts out the periodi=
cal from his apartment, and he sends you a copy. With the Institution, it h=
as to be the other way around. =0A=

Some little mags now distribute via Ingram's, etc., and those are the ones =
the library will buy.=0A=

I thought I answered this, but it must have been backchannel. Buffalo, Brown and Yale buy almost all small press poetry books. I believe they have standing orders at SPD. They're all very near Endicott--the books are available in your area. As I suggested backchannel, I would think more useful, and a unique collection, would be putting together a really thorough collection of books published by North Shore presses, and it could probably be done at a modest price.

You probably know how fierce the economics of publishing are. Here's the breakdown as I experience it. A 180 page book costs me $3.50 a copy. most copies sell through third parties. Publisher's cut is 25-35%. So, if I price the book at $21 my cut is $5.25 to $7.35. I do manage to sell some at full price, some at various discounts, let's say I average $9.00. That means I've netted after printing costs $5.50. The port gets $2.10 of that--10% of cover price. That leaves $3.40, which has to cover shipping and storage, copies returned damaged, postage, and a great many free copies, for promotion and review. I can continue publishing, but only if I sell a significant portion of my print run. And if I donate work space and all of my labor, including design and typesetting.

Some presses survive on grants. Presses that only do a couple of books a year really can't--they're eligible for only tiny grants, too small to justify the considerable labor involved in applying.

This is why I get hot under the collar when folks expect freebees for reviews they won't write or that will appear in invisible places, or review outlets that demand payment for running a review. And for special collections that have no earthly reason to exist. Though if you can make a case for Endicott's collection I bet you could get a small grant and buy the books. I bet most of us would give you a discount if you committed to buying the the entire catalogue.

When Martin Duberman was collecting materials for his groundbreaking
book on Black Mountain College in the late 1960s, he asked Robert
Creeley to provide him with an interview. Creeley, then teaching at
SUNY Buffalo, sat down with a tape recorder and did just that. For
years, the tape remained in the vaults of the NC Division of Archives
and History, which now houses Duberman's Black Mountain materials.
While going through other material from the college last summer, I
came across the collection's inventory, and decided to see whether the
recording might, after all these years, be rescued from obscure
storage. Penelope Creeley kindly wrote the folks at the Archives
giving her blessing, and in reasonably short order they provided a
digital transcription of the full interview. It was great to hear.

And now you can hear it, too. It's featured on Wordplay this week, and
you can stream it from the Wordplay Show page at AshevilleFM.org:
http://www.ashevillefm.org/wordplay

It'll remain on the server for several more weeks, though another show
will replace it in the stream next Monday. I'll get back with a link
to the mp3 file then.

Enjoy,

Nominate the Next American Haiku Archives Honorary  Curator

The advisory board for the American Haiku Archives (AHA) at the California
State Library in Sacramento, California, wants your help in nominating an
honorary curator for 2011-2012. The North American person you nominate
*must*  meet the guidelines listed at
_http://www.americanhaikuarchives.org/curators/honorarycuratorscriteria.html_
(http://www.americanhaikuarchives.org/curators/honorarycuratorscriteria.html) .  Please send your nomination(s),
including the person's name and one or two  sentences saying why you think he or
she deserves this honor, to _PhotoGarry@aol.com_
(mailto:PhotoGarry@aol.com) . Deadline for  nominations is June 30, 2011. If you have questions,
please  contact Michael Dylan Welch at _WelchM@aol.com_ (mailto:WelchM@aol.com) .

Every July, in commemoration of the founding of the American Haiku
Archives, the AHA advisory board appoints a prominent North American haiku poet,
scholar, or translator to serve as honorary curator for one year. Our current
 curator is Gary Snyder, and past curators have included a who's who of
haiku  poets and translators -- see the list at
_http://www.americanhaikuarchives.org/curators/honorarycurators.html_
(http://www.americanhaikuarchives.org/curators/honorarycurators.html) .  Please send us your nominations. A final
decision will be made by the AHA  advisory board and announced in July 2011.

The American Haiku Archives is the official archive of the Haiku Society of
 America, and also welcomes haiku-related material from any other
individual or  organization, primarily in English. The archives is the world's
largest haiku  archives outside Japan.

It's a question of scale. Small presses have a hard time selling directly because of personnel limitations at libraries. It's must more cost effective for the librarian to go through an SPD catalogue and check off what he wants--one-stop shopping.

Old fashioned?  Have you checked the news lately, or does your maid do
that for you since you're apparently a rich man who does not live in a
world with a faltering economy.  I've also noted that we've helped you
become "widely published" and you can't cough up money to help us
help you?  Your school has a limited budget?  I'd say most alternative
publishers would say the same thing  with a greater purchase on the word
"truth".  As Ben Franklin says "Fools give feasts and wise men eat
them."  I can't afford to be a fool and as for your being a wise man,
I would suggest that you wise up and help the alternative press. Jess

Hi Joseph.  First, bless you.  I've dealt with universities in just a
such a sitation as you describe and there's been no problem with
paperwork, or purchasing.  In addition, SPD does a great job of vending
to universities.  Please check out Ahadada Books there, Joseph, and
consider adding our fine books and wonderful authors to your
university's collection.  Jess

The problem is that, under state purchasing rules, the "unit" (library, in this case) must invoice the "vendor." As we know, w/little mags, you send a check for 15 bucks to John Doe editor who puts out the periodical from his apartment, and he sends you a copy. With the Institution, it has to be the other way around.

Subject:      Negative review of  "Cyclones in High Northern Latitudes" in
              Jacket2

There is a negative review of =E2=80=9CCyclones in High Northern Latitudes"=
 (a long poem by Jake Berry and myself) in Jacket2. I don=E2=80=99t mind th=
e review, as I am fairly detached from the poetry I write. The only quibble=
 I have with it is that a very unflattering photo of me has been used to go=
 with it. My hope is that this photo is replaced at some stage with a bette=
r one. Here is the review:
=20
=E2=80=98Taking the Concept of Meaning-Making by Storm: A Review of =E2=80=
=9CCyclones in High Northern Latitudes"=E2=80=99 by Jacquilyn Weeks.
=20
http://jacket2.org/reviews/taking-concept-meaning-making-storm
=20
Bill Lavender, who published the book, has allowed me to quote his response=
 to the review. He writes:
=20
"There is a lot to argue with in this review. It's weird how it approaches =
the real weaknesses of the poem and even analyzes individual points quite s=
uccinctly and yet, in the end, embraces the very banality it accuses the po=
em of. In a review that counts the number of personal pronouns in the text,=
 the final judgement boils down to 'I didn't like Cyclones.'
=20
What pertains here, finally, is a very naive attitude toward poetic discour=
se and the sources of poetic texts. Jacquilyn Weeks accurately counts the p=
ronouns in the poem, but fails to count them in the review. Which is to say=
 she holds an ostensible (and quite distant) ego responsible in the first t=
ext while she absolves the very real (and close) ego in the second. But the=
 problem is that the pronouns of the poem are discursive (meaning, they ari=
se from the insistence of language itself, from the text as discourse) whil=
e the pronouns of the review are forced, egocentric, paranoid--exactly what=
 she is (quite mistakenly) criticizing about the poem.
=20
I'll illustrate this with a very simple point, the review's inaccuracy at i=
ts crucial point of judgement:
=20
=E2=80=98The value of any texts' aesthetic to an individual reader is in wh=
at the reader chooses (and is able) to connect with in any given moment. Wh=
ich is to say that I'm glad I read it, but I didn't like Cyclones. Chris Ma=
nsel, Matt Hill, and Bill Lavender loved it.=E2=80=99
=20
The footnote refers us only to Jake Berry's blog, where, we are assured, th=
ere are "quotes available." Please, (you) reader, go to Berry's blog and fi=
nd the quote that says Bill Lavender loved it.=20
=20
For I never said I loved this poem. When I was a teenager, I loved Keats, a=
nd I loved the bartender at the corner bar. But I never loved this poem. In=
 fact, I hated it, and still do. I hate it because it proves, quite decisiv=
ely, that neither readers nor writers make meaning; meaning is made in the =
language, by the anonymous force that puts pronouns in our mouths as the pr=
iest lays a wafer on the tongue. By the oracular accumulation of a thousand=
 generations, the discourse that both suffocates and engenders meaning.=20
=20
I still love Keats, just like I love James Wright's cute little ponies. And=
 I hate Cyclones because it has absolutely nothing to do with that neo-roma=

Evental Aesthetics Vol 1. No. 1 . Hegelian Topics in Aesthetics

http://eventalaesthetics.net

In an essay on Hegel's aesthetics, Paul De Man quips, .Whether we know it,
or like it, or not, most of us are Hegelians and quite orthodox ones at
that.. But what does it mean today to be a Hegelian within an environment
in which criticism has already deconstructed the institutions and values
that make the concept of art possible, and in which new art forms cast
into doubt the very ontology of art?

The inaugural issue of Evental Aesthetics begins with the premise that
Hegelian aesthetics are not only relevant but indispensable for making
sense of today.s art and art criticism. We therefore welcome essays that
attend both to Hegel's writings and to recent writers (for example, but
not limited to, Badiou, Malabou, and Vattimo) who have blazed new trails
within Hegelian discourse. We seek not hagiography but incisive,
thoughtful reflections - critical or favorable - on Hegel's legacy.



For Articles, suggested angles of approach include:

Hegel's thoughts on a specific form of art (music, architecture, painting,
poetry, etc.)
Hegel and abstract art
the 'end' of art
natural beauty as opposed to that of art
the aesthetics of and in Hegel's logic and phenomenology
the relationship between art, religion, and philosophy
relationships between Hegel's aesthetic theory and earlier or more recent
theories
the pertinence of Hegel's thought to particular artworks.
Other ideas concerning Hegel's relationship with aesthetics are also
welcome.

Authors of Articles should first submit an abstract, no longer than 500
words, outlining the aims and critical methodologies for the article. The
editorial board will review abstracts and extend invitations to selected
authors to submit full-length articles (4,000-10,000 words). Invitation to
submit is not a guarantee of publication.

Collisions for this issue may consist of:

Book reviews, addressing new translations of Hegel or new, original
monographs on Hegel and/or aesthetics
Reactions to artworks that may suggest Hegelian themes.
These brief responses may be between 1,000 and 2,000 words. Abstracts for
Collisions are not required.

Commentaries should address the articles published in this issue. We will
begin calling for commentaries after the articles have been selected.

review procedures. Note that there are separate requirements for each type
of submission. Essays that do not meet these requirements will not be
considered.

We welcome either American or British spelling provided the submission
remains consistent throughout. Save your submission as a Word .doc file .

Woodland Pattern Book Center was founded as a non-profit organization in Mi=
lwaukee, Wisconsin's Riverwest neighborhood by Anne Kingsbury and Karl Gart=
ung in 1979. The center houses a bookstore with over 25,000 small press tit=
les, in addition to an art gallery where they present exhibitions, artist t=
alks, readings, experimental films, concerts, and writing workshops.

http://www.woodlandpattern.org

Due to the state budget cuts in Wisconsin, Woodland Pattern needs to raise =
an additional $48,500 in less than seven months. This means that NOW is an =
excellent time to visit, shop, and make a donation.=20

Tired of seeing arts funding getting cut in your state? Here are some talki=
ng points for your legislators:

***The arts are central to healthy communities.***
=E2=80=A2 Stimulate economic and community development.
=E2=80=A2 Educate our children to succeed in school and beyond.
=E2=80=A2 Beautify our neighborhoods.
=E2=80=A2 Attract tourists and out-of-town visitors.
=E2=80=A2 Make our cities and towns attractive and vibrant
places to live and work.
=E2=80=A2 Provide important social and creative outlets for all residents,
including seniors, those with disabilities, children and adults.
=E2=80=A2 Bring people of diverse backgrounds together in productive
and cooperative ways.
=E2=80=A2 People who are involved in the arts are also more civically engag=
ed, they volunteer and they vote.

***The arts build and sustain prosperity.***
=E2=80=A2 Cities thrive, grow, attract and retain businesses when
the arts are supported.=20
=E2=80=A2 Arts and creativity education is proven to keep students in schoo=
l,
increase high school graduation rates and prepare students for
college and for the careers of the 21st century.
=E2=80=A2 The new economy (insert your economic system here) requires a wor=
kforce that will be highly disciplined, collaborative, innovative, imaginat=
ive, creative and focused. These are the traits the arts teach.
