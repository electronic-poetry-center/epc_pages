Dear Chris:

Please show me how my ruminations are reductive or irrelevant and I shall
be delighted to think about that. If I thought they were boring, believe me
I would not have raised the issue. You may well have insights which hsve
escaped me. But we are here, I am sure you agree, to deal with the issues
which concern us. And these issues concern me. "What man if his child ask
him for bread will give him a stone?"

While I agree with Dick up to a point I think it is also important to
remember that a large number of writers are not yet connected to the net
and many may not be for some time. I remember having a conversation about 6
months ago with the director of the NSW Writers' Centre. She claimed that a
recent survey of NSWWC members suggested that only a little over 50% owned
a computer - of those many had old machines ataris or 286 which ran old
word processing programs and little else. Given the economic circumstances
of writers (esp young or new writers) in Australia - updating computer
equipment is not a high priority (many of the writers I know who are on the
net are using machines that are three and four years old).

While I don't think that the fact that many writers can't afford to be on
the net should prevent others from fully exploring the possibilities I do
think it is important that we acknowledge the potential for a gap to open
up between writers with access to new technologies and those without.

It still comes back to the *editor.* If you have been browsing for a while
then you know that it's just like a big library. Eventually you find certain
'zines that have a high probability of tickling your fancy. These you down-
load without browsing. For instance, if I see a Robert Kelly chapbook as a
supplement to RIF/T, I snag that page, no questions asked!

While it's true that the browsers can have an effect on the shape of the
text (just as much as book size can,) the browsers usually offer a variety
of page layouts for people who print out the pages. The limitations of
fonts and font sizes have an effect, as well as the difficulties many people
have with indents. Some of these will be overcome with improvements in
the HTML spec.

IRC has a greater impact on the shapes of poems than web pages. The programs
generally wrap lines that are long, wipe out stanza breaks (unless you put
in a period), and don't show more than 20 or so lines at a time. Newer
programs allow people to scroll back or turn on logs to record the poems,
but generally poetry on IRC is written in sand. The interaction with other
poets is fun, however, especially if you like open readings. On the other
hand, I haven't found many poets who share my views, or who know about my
favorite poets.

Well, English has taken another step towards becoming the world language.
I agree that it is cultural imperialism, but there's little that can be done
now to stop it, aside from pulling the plug on the whole thing. There will
be a massive preservation project similar to the Gutenberg Project for
all cultures. I have a friend in Italy who writes in English exclusively.
I think Dante would have made the same decision. Is this a good or a bad
thing? When the Italians abandoned Latin, it was a good thing, IMO.

BTW, I rejoice at the demise of any kind of nationalism.

And I think this all means that we can exchange ideas faster. That's all.
How that affects us is a whole different subject (that I could talk about
well into the night.)

>Leaving aside for now the related questions of how to pay and support the
>publisher and writer,

We don't have to leave this aside. I think it's a very important question.
Publishing as we know it is coming to an end. Hooray! It's too expensive
and too hierarchical and too full of scratch-me-back ethics. In the fiction
genres, many writers are actually being paid and living off their books, but
in poetry, most writers have to teach, lecture, and give readings to support
themselves. And that's the successful ones! So for us (this is a poetics
list, right?) it's no big loss. Our poets have the opportunity for wider
exposure with little change in their means of support.

And poetry publishers operate in the red anyway. Maybe this will be a relief.

I downloaded an entire novel that is due to be printed and circulated soon.
Frankly, it would cost me more to print it out than to buy the paperback.
I don't like reading fiction at my computer. I'd rather sit back in an easy
chair or curl up with the book in bed. I think my feeling is shared by most
readers, so electronic files won't change the nature of fiction publishing
until the computer interface changes.

I found a few magazines that are using the web to advertise themselves. They
provide samples. I haven't been inclined to subscribe to any, but that's
just a reaction based on my taste.

SUMMATION:
We're not going to lose any money by using the web.
The editor's taste will still be important.
More people will see our poetry.
The "Nation of Nothing But Poetry" is on the horizon.
(Do I have stars in my eyes or what?!)

Dick, you have been inspired by Blake's *methods* for longer than most people
I know. Come back at me on the money issue. Do you foresee loss? As far as
publishers and editors go, is it an exageration to say that you threw them
all out years ago? Isn't the web already becoming the Anarchist's Encyclo-
pedia? Is our greatest concern the FCC and AT&T and major providers like
AOL that censor or limit access to the internet?

I don't have much comment on the language arts departments, except to say that
they're usually about 40 or 50 years behind the times. It appears they are
beginning to teach the beats, so I guess we now know who won the Anthology
War. FWIW, if I were studying with poets whose work I like I wouldn't want them
to tell me how to write. I'd want to read and discuss their favorite writers.

I suppose I don't really know what "poetics" means, but it seems to me the term
doesn't cover Dick Higgins' recent postings either. Personally, I don't care if
the chat here ranges far and wide: announcements of new books, discussion of the
economics of publishing, jokes, arguments about information technology, even
college departmental talk (though I am one of the minority here who has no
connection with academia). Although the hardcore stuff - philosophical discourse
about the practice of poetry itself - is often interesting, it would be
unbearable if that was all there was.

On the subject of the Web, my view is: yes, it's overhyped, no, it's not about
to replace publishing, yes, it's the precursor for major changes in the way
information will be disseminated in the next century. Wendy Mulford and I have
been having discussions here in the UK with John Cayley about putting up a Web
site for Reality Street Editions, and I hope that will happen over the next
year. But the fact remains that the vast majority of the current regular readers
of the press's output still have no Web access. Admittedly, this is based on
anecdotal evidence, and I would like to test it out with a survey of the two or
three hundred UK-based individuals on our mailing list. My suspicion is that the
results of the NSW Writers Centre survey reported by Mark Roberts would be
replicated: ie up to 50% without even a computer of any kind, etc.

Using the net to communicate has advantages; but currently it is also expensive,
difficult and inconvenient. (Which, incidentally, may be one reason this list is
so academia-heavy - it's much easier if an institution is providing the
wherewithal.) It will only become really significant when the technology is as
cheap and transparent as the telephone itself - which will be the case one day.
Meanwhile ... the problem is netheads are so gung-ho about it all ... I've just
had a message from a friend who has been creating graphics on a PC without a
printer. He asked me if I could try printing them out via my Mac and laser
printer. Lo and behold, I get four binary files from him this morning via e-mail
which my software tells me will take nearly three hours in total to download -
with a message saying he thought this would be the "easiest" way to get them to
me. Well, I'm always willing to do a favour for a friend, but no way. I've asked
him to put a disk in the post to me. Thank god for snail mail.

Dear Chris-

Techno-salvation? Yikes!  Well, I know what you mean. The mystique of
computers is indeed repulsive. And how much of our time is wasted looking
for this piece of shareware (needed for some specific project), etc.
However, I'm sure you will agree on this part, computers DO exist, the web
is available to increasing numbers of people at a time when our economy has
been in a decline since the oil embargo (1973), monopolistic factors have
made it harder and harder for independent stores to function or take
chances (art galleries too, to cite a parallel problem), so that we who
crave good reading are increasingly forced to the web (or, if we are lucky,
to readings). If we as poets or writers or other kinds of participants in
serious literature are to be confronted with web literature, does it not
behoove us to ask ourselves what kind of literature works best on the web?
And why?

That isn't so much because one believes in the web as our salvation but
because it is likely to be the most available medium for poetry and other
non-commercial writing for the next period of time.

Near me there is a small liberal arts college; student homelessness has
begun to be a problem. Tuitions have become outrageously high, and there is
talk of letting even tenured faculty go. I am an outsider, not teaching nor
particularly wanting to teach (at least in cultural subjects). I hear this
talk from my teaching neighbors. I see it on the web on this POETICS list.
Naturally I wonder if some form of reorganization could help the situation.
Yet most of what I hear on the web is the trivia (at least it seems such to
me) of who meets whom at the MLA-date-making-or how to save the job of a
good essayist who had written concerning the LANGUAGE people but was denied
tenure. That's all business as usual in a time when 40% unemployment seems
the logical outcome of Gingerich and the Ginkies' policies (higher among
academics, as the number of schools contracts due to the loss of a "market"
for graduate students). Of course I feel sorry for our essayist, but I
cannot wonder if his jobn is saved if it will solve the problem in the long
term.  THIS is why I asked about WEB POETRY and RESTRUCTURING together-both
are responses to a crisis which I see, not to one which delights me for
some sadistic reason.

Do not think, please, that the POETICS list is the only one where my
questions are being raised. They are also being raised on the AVANT-GARDE
bulletin board at SPOON,

To me POETICS is the aesthetics of the arts, the policies which govern its
making and its reception.
The conditions under which the arts are made or experienced are part of the
process, but the trivia of who meets who or how to save whose job (unless
the entire field be challenged) are best left aside from this particular
discussion.

Who overhypes the web? Surely not the workers in the field or those who
have been on line long enough to get used to it! Most of the discussions of
it which I see deal with the nuts and bolts issues of how to get access to
it; they are neutral azbout whether it is or is not a good thing. Frankly,
I dislike the web-but I must live with it. As for access, it will be even
more accessible as web machines become more common-Sun is the only one
making and selling one now, but every manufacturer has one "in the tube"
(literally). Those will cost ca. US$550-an amount comparable to a video
player here and presumably the same, comparably, in the UK.

I would suggest to your friend that he stop and think. Furthermore, the UK
has plenty of laser porinters on hand with which he could experiment,
albeit for a slight fee. If he does not experiment and have some kind of
dialogue with his own production, then what he produces is bound to be
lousy and boring to anyone besides himself. You are doing him no favor, I
believe, if you encourage him along these lines.

Subject:      MLA Doings?

As someone who's (1) been pretty much out of academia for over 20 years and (2)
never been to MLA I'd like to say (speaking only for myself) that I *do*
consider discussion of MLA doings of relevance to this list, would very much
appreciate it if someone can post a summary, and if certain people don't like
it they can just skip those messages.

I happen to be one of those who did bypass most of the renga, but would not
dream of trying to censor other people from posting theirs; I resent the
recent attempts to censor this list of MLA discussions: If you don't like it,
don't read the messages.

Like it or not, there are *many* members of this list attending MLA, & I find
it pretty hard to believe there was nothing that happened there of general
interest here.

If you look through the poetics list archives, you'll find some discussion of
electronic writing, writing futures, etc.  (You *ought* to look through the
archives, Dick; you'd find we're a very diverse bunch, with a lot of topic

Much more interesting is the question of what writing done specifically for
this medium will be like.  The ht_lit mailing list [absurdly quiet of late]
is one place where a lot of discussion on this topic has taken place; and
of course there's a *huge* literature on hypertext, quite a bit of it
speculating on future "e-literatures".

I've had similar thoughts myself for a long time, but was not thinking of
university level departments so much as junior high and high school.  One of
the reasons the schools do such a good job of turning out people who don't
like poetry is that the same pedagogical methods are applied to the survival
skill aspects of "English" as to the teaching of literature, which it seems
to me call for completely different methods altogether.

What *stops me cold* from openly proposing this on a serious basis is a
hard cold rational analysis of what will happen in this age of budget cuts
if we separate "literature" from the survival skill aspects of "English".
Guess what's going to get cut?

One reflection re: Higgins' modest proposal for literature departments.  Split-
ting/merging current literature depts. into one History & one Skills dept. is
an admirable idea in many respects, but involves one danger: that administra-
tions will continue their current inclinations & keep the Skills component
while eliminating the History, or simply letting it wither away.  Currently it
is the skills component in literature depts. that allows them to argue for keep
ing literature in the curriculum at all; separate the skills from the lit.,
& the bottom-liners of universtiy administrations will scour the lit. out of
there in no time.  While there may be people on this list who would view the
loss of literature-teaching from universities as no loss at all, I for one wd.
regret it.  Literature's past barely exists for our culture as it is (hell, HIS
TORY period barely exists for us...); knock it completely out of the university
curriculum, & before long who will even remember that there WAS a past litera-
ture?

A couple of thoughts re Dick Higgin's proposed separation of skills and
history/appreciation in restructuring English departments.

the ability to analyze texts is an important skill for which our society
pays highly, albeit the texts tend to be legal documents, etc.  but these
skills are generally dealt with in the course of reading past literature.

dick proposes the art history model, but in fact it is art history that
is the more practical side; it teaches you how to recognize fakes and
provenance, and has to do with assessing value.  that is not quite what
literature courses in college do or teach you to do,

except insofar as there is prestige related to knowledge of literature.
is there still any prestige involved with culture?  I would think there
is, but earning a living based on involvement with culture is not the
same thing as having that prestige.

Pierre Bourdieu's DISTINCTION (trans by Richard Nice and published by
Harvard) includes very interesting examination of these problems.

        The university's function--as Ginsberg says somewhere-- is to take
care of the archive, and it is about the only thing it does well. I would
say (after 25 years in academia) that the only significant address to
matters of contemporary importance is a result of subversion.

        And I would insist that tending the archive is a serious and
important matter.  To be overwhelmed by the archive, however, is a kind of
decadence, and the poetry in the university *tends* to get overwhelmed.
It was overwhelmed in the 50's the authority of the canon and produced
the old academic poetry, and it was overwhelmed in the 70's by
continental philosophy and produced the new academic poetry.

        As a result, poets tend to turn anti-archive and try to do
something in ignorance, which of course is always a sad and futile
undertaking.

        I do think the archive is badly in need of reorganization, but
the last thing that needs to happen, it seems to me, is to isolate
literature even more than it is now.  I would rather  see English
combined with physics or almost any thing else than with the language
departments (which in my experience tend to be among the most backward
looking in the university).  And rather than isolating it from rhetoric
and composition, it is much more to the point to think of rhetoric and
composition not as remedial skills but as concerns of organization that
demand the most sophisticated attention (as we do in our graduate program
at SUNY-Albany). As such rhetoric stands with poetics as disciplines in
the archive.

        The point is, however, that the organization of the achive will
never be appropriate to poets who live on the contemporary earth (rather
than in the archives).  Our approach as poets to the archive must always
be that there is necessary stuff to find there, but that it is *our*
job to find it and organize it in useful ways.

        By and large, the institution will not be sympathetic (I have
scars to prove it), but night raids on the archive are necessary to the art.

Dick et al,

There is much to comment on in this proposal, but I'll focus on one thing,
since it strikes me as very mistaken--the division of "literature and the
history of literature" from the "meat and potatoes" language skills.
There are practical and intellectual reasons for resisting this kind of
division.  Practically, this makes it much harder to argue for the
viability of the literature department.  The language skills will
necessarily flourish, because a badly prepared student population will
require them.  Literature departments, by contrast, will have no "service"
to offer the university, short of the introductory survey (unless a
literature seminar is required, as is the case at many small schools).  I
do believe these are a genuine service, but many administrators will not.
But the real issue here is the relationship between literature and
rhetoric.  It seems to me that these are integrally related, and that to
separate them institutionally is only to perpetuate bad ideas about
literature and worse ideas about rhetoric.  Now I'll be the first to admit
that the de facto relationship they have in the current
structure--separate offices at opposite ends of the same hallway--is also
absurd: English departments are more likely to staff composition courses
with graduate students, assign one full-time faculty member to administer
the program, and get on with the business of teaching "literature" than
they are to actually contemplate the relationship between rhetorical
practice--the contexts of speech and writing, the techniques and
determinants of successful argument- - and literary representation and
expression.  This is a shame.  But it's a problem that won't be served by
separating them as if they were two disciplines.  Rhetoric has already
become a sort of neglected step-child of literary studies: this only
serves rotten thinking about rhetoric and literature.

jAnd poetics?  Well, that's one of the things we do too in English
departments.  Perhaps our thinking about figurative language will benefit
from an understanding of how figurative language works in a variety of
rhetrorical contexts.  We all know what the naked encounter with metaphor
can lead to.  I don't think we'll teach poetry or poetics better if we
managed to get this other business off our backs, and threw the "dead
wood" into the pile we just cared less about.  For me, my business is
language.  And I think we need to foster thinking about language that
breaks down the old divisions between "ordinary langauge" and "literary
language."  If we don't recognize that this should take place when we
teach "literature" and  "basic language skills" alike, then, to my mind
at least, we're missing the boat.

Well sure, and as you know these are the issues which John Henry Cardinal
Newman addresses in THE IDEA OF A UNIVERSITY when he addresses the

The Web, fundamentally, is quite boring.  Not at all unlike television, not
at  all unlike the majority of Hollywood film.  But what is exciting are
those occasional moments of brilliance in its midst.  But while the
prospect of finding some (brilliant) art in the form of poetry on the
Internet is the kind of thing that Dick Higgins is talking about, the
Web-as-replacement-for-paperback is not a good model.  The "electronic
book" must be more (or different) than the paper version or else my
PowerMac is a $3000 bookmark.

The big question, then, is what do we do.  Sadly, this post will not hold
all the answers, although I will reply to Mark Roberts and say that while
his point of the low level of "connectedness" of writers (and indeed of
humans in the country and on the planet) is well taken, the Internet, for
all its potential to be so, is not yet the provider of poetic democracy.
Which is to say, let's not intercept our chance to dream with worries that
we will not be including everyone.  Just as electronic mail certainly does
not preclude the handwritten postcard or the penned letter, so will poetry
on the Net not replace by any means a book, a reading, or a sonnet on a
napkin.  What it offers is a bonus arena, not a wholly new medium since
what is at stake is still language, but a different avenue, a different
take on it all.

Most interesting to me in all this is the visual-hook factor as brought up
by DIck.  We are not, as a populous of paper-readers all that comfortable
reading on screen yet.  I am not sure we ever will be as comfortable.  The
CRT is simply not as cosy as a book in a bathtub or a bar.  But while that
may lead to poems without such a hook being bypassed for others, the
benefit of the Internet is its potential to provide a larger number of
pomes to be perused at low cost to the peruser.  Now that's democracy.

The buzzword for all this seems to be "interactivity," and I think that
that is where poetry will benefit on the Net.  There is a chance for poems
to be both performed (posted) and discussed, an interplay of  artistic and
critical voices that already exists between the poem and the essay, the
journal and its letter page, but here might reach a level closer to
simultaneity.

That is what is most interesting to me re: the Internet: conversation,
dialog, whether it be a conversation of poems, or a conversation about
poems.

This book sounds interesting but expensive. I shall seek but will I find.
Perhaps it is discussed on the web somewhere?

In the nineteen fifties, before there was serious public funding in this
country and before art gave way to grantsmanship to the extent that it has,
there was a high level of connoisseurship among the general public. It was
lost. What happened?

Perhaps you are right that in Art History one gets a certain practical
instruction from which we could learn. I think that is what Joel
Oppenheimer meant when he told me he was not allowed to teach Wordsworth. I
would rather study Wordsworth with him than with someone who only knew the
secondary sources, the history of the critical approaches to Wordsworth,
etc. But anything like this would lie outside the college approach by
period ("Wordsworth's THE EXCURSION and the English Romantics"-which avoids
the tremendous debt of Wordsworth and Coleridge to the Jena group of German
Romantics which is thus left to the Comp Lit people who have their own
problems), and it lies outside the thematic ones ("The Gallows and Capital
Punishment in Engtish Poetry," from the Elizabethans through Wordsworth's
THE EXCURSION to the twentieth century), quite diverting but somehow
incomplete. You see, my argument is that all this kind of textual analysis
is valuable but it is hard to get to because of the scattered and
compartmentalized approach to the consideration of language, the familiar
phenomenon of our knowing "more and more about less and less," which
inevitably leads to an inability to see the connection among things. One
thinks of Thomas Love Peacock's satire on Coleridge with his flashes in his
eyes and his speaking with such a myriad of digressions that everything
loses its meaning.

Indeed this is a danger; and it is happening anyway, through misprision
(SHAKESPEARE WITHOUT CYMBELLINE or TIMON OF ATHENS or THE WINTER'S TALE or
other difficult-to-teach items, or POETRY WITHOUT VISUAL POETRY etc.). So
why pretend it isn't? My intention is not Swiftian-I am not using A MODEST
PROPOSAL as my model, and I am trying to be literal,  not satirical in my
suggestion. I have addressed some of the questions in other replies on this
network and you have surely heard quite a few of my points from others.
However though your caveats are serious, I would like to see what you
suggest would be better improvement of the methods of teaching LIterature
and Language than what I have suggested. Could you please oblige?

It sounds to me like you don't think Literature has the same value as other
arts, that it must borrow its function from applied language courses, that
it must somehow be snuck unto a curriculum under the noses of some
scissors-carrying dean. To this I must object; in DICHTUNG UND WAHRHEIT
Goethe (whom Emerson took as the archetypal writer) tells why he gave up
medicine-literature, Goethe says, comprehends all the arts and experience
even more than medicine comprehends the body. That is indeed my raison
d'=EAtre for Literature. It is the master subject of 'em all, without which
the others can barely be discussed. If your dean cannot see this, then
trash him, go over his head, bypass him or whatever-we are now required to
fight a cultural civil war which we as thinking people did not choose. In
any war one must expect casualties. But we will win, because in the long
run we, not the budget kings and queens, are the indispensible ones without
which life is one long inchoate agony. Or do you disagree?

Interesting to me are both this construction of "we" and the entitlement
that's claimed for "us". Who says "we" have anything even remotely
interesting to say to anyone not on this list (or even _on_ this list)?
That goes double for me. Or rather, can it be that the appropriate
responses to exaggerated claims for work/authors/times are exaggerated
insults to said work/authors/times..

I also think, Jonathan, and please tell me if I'm wrong, that you were
saying something closer to "the study of literature is the study of
language" not for purposes of subterfuge but for statement of principle?
That to dehistoricize the study of "language arts" is to abandon the dream
of an educated general public, to turn over composition wholesale to the
"writing process" and other charlatan plans?

presently orchestrated for more than 5 years worth of 12-hour postings, I
will undoubtedly be tempted to tweak the ongoing publication with
additional new interjected imagery. Each 12-hour posting is like the
turning of a page; providing ample time for reflection, interruption,
and assimilation.

Michael Palmer on Myung Mi Kim's _The Bounty_:
The fragment becomes entire as it re-searches memory, recovers texts,
episodes, sounds and landscapes. The Bounty interrogates the radical and
violent instability of our moment, asking where is the location of culture,
where the site of self, selves, among others. Its gaps or silences speak as
determinedly, and urgently, as its singular music.

Kathleen Fraser on Mary Margaret Sloan's _The Said Lands, Islands, and
Premises_:
Sloan's passion for words - their lipstick traces and lingering inflections
(as grammar would have it) - makes for a poetry of extraordinary pleasure
and difficulty. The mind and ear are redirected from inherited sequence to
intentional mutation.

Established in 1984 in Tucson, Chax Press is one of the nation's premier
independent small presses. Chax Press, a non-profit organization, has
published more than 25 books of innovative poetry in both trade and
hand-printed, hand-bound fine art book editions-excursions into the
relationship among visual, verbal, and structural elements. In 1993 Chax
moved to Minneapolis, where its most recent books have been by Norman
Fischer, Kathleen Fraser, Mary Margaret Sloan, and Myung Mi Kim. In 1996 a
return to Tucson is anticipated. Chax Press founder and director Charles
Alexander writes, "We believe that our editorial and design sensibilities
help us to stand out as one of a handful of publishers with which the
present and future of an imaginative literature not constrained by the
market forces of a capitalist economy is linked. Audiences are small but
crucial. The work is among the most important tasks I can imagine."

Subject:      The English Dept. of the Soul and the New World Order

Does anyone else find it amusing that Dick Higgins is now embroiled
in a discussion on how to save the English Department? Is that our
job, Dick? And on the Poetics List, at that.

In the last exchange on this question, someone suggested that budget
cuts limited our response. This is a pernicious misrepresentation of
the situation, and it demonstrates how thoroughly right wing ideology
has shaped the entire discussion of these issues. The dismantling of
the university as we have known it (which may or may not be a bad
thing) is part of a right wing political program masked behind the
rhetoric of economics. Accepting it as a budegetary problem is to
capitulate to the political agenda of those who are re-engineering the
institution to play a new role in the new, international economy.

It's probably not salvagable. The private institutions will go on
serving big money, and the public institutions, drastically reduced in
scope and size, will increasingly fullfill a job training role.

It may or may not be a bad thing because the University (including the
English Department of the Soul) has always served a disciplinary
function that the knee-jerk-neo-cons underestimate, and by dismantling
it, they are unleashing forces of resistance that otherwise were
harnassed to yet another Foucaultian reading of race-gender-cold-war
-ideology-blah-blah-blah in Betty Crocker cookbooks. Who knows how
that will fall out? But the last thing on my mind is worrying about
how to reorganize the English Dept.

Hey, onward, as Creeley says.

Jordan, of course I like to have principle invoked in my name, though I
don't even know what you mean by subterfuge!  Can I have 'em both at once?
Yes, I do think a principle is at stake, but that principle is
indistinguishable, for me, from what I think will work best in educating
students into the mysteries and pleasures and blind curves of language.  I
think English and Comp Lit departments could be more effective in teaching
literature and basic skills if we recognized and nurtured their
affinities.  When our graduate student-TAs have a grip on Ted Taylor's
logic and rhetoric model at Columbia, they do extraordinary things with
it--but most students are not trained to see the relationship between
logic and rhetoric and the kind of literary studies we practice on the
other end of the hall.  Perhaps Marisa Januzzi, whom I once observed
teaching L & R, will chime in...?

I agree, Dick, about "connections," though I suspect everyone teaching,
including everyone teaching courses like Wordsworth and the British
Romantics or Coleridge and the Penal Colony (I can't remember the 2nd
example you gave) would also agree: they'd just claim that their
connections were the more "vital" or "deeper" ones.  Or perhaps, like
myself, they'd only say they were different connections, differently
meaningful.  It's of course telling that you turn to Goethe (and I
appreciate the Emerson link, since Emerson is at the center of my current
book project, and I adore him, porcupine impossibility and all).  On a
certain level, and especially for someone like Goethe, connection at some
point always implies a connection with Everything.  Why should literature
departments reproduce the dream of an infinite grasp?  Many people have
written and are writing on the historical horizon of the concept of
Literature, but, as my phrasing suggests, I find myself thinking most here
of Gadamer, in Truth and Method. The conception of literature, especially
as it is juxtaposed with the narrow science of medicine, doesn't satisfy
me:  it reproduces divisions between art and science that, as I said about
literature and rhetoric in my previous post, make for bad thinking about
art (and, I'm convinced, though as a non-sceintist, about science).  I
don't, I hasten to add, think that literature is a secondary activity at
the service of technology, science, busniness skills, etc.  But the way to
critique the blind adherence to the cult of skills is not to place
Literature across its path and seek converts.  We need, instead, to read
literature with a sharpened understanding of how language works, how it is
always already (oh, how I hate that phrase--but it didn't catch on for
nothing) at work in us, and how our best writers reawaken the language for
us (and that "us,"  Jordan, is distinctly up for grabs, since it remains
to awaken).

Dear JOrdan-

I think you miss my point. What are you going to do when unemployment hits 40%?

Where did I say that I wanted to save English Departments as such. But I am
interested in the language arts (among others) and this necessarily
includes teaching them and scholarship in them. I want to think about what
we will do when unemployment reaches 40% and not simply wait until it does.

However I must say that most English profs are a lost cause, don't you
agree? They can barely read for content and cannot think as clearly as
their colleagues in other departments. It would be no great loss if most of
them became plumbers, though, perhaps with the right training, some could
be reeducated appropriately. It isn't their fault usually, as they often
start out well enough, but between required courses, excessive paperwork
and meetings (often in the name of democracy) and committees and
understandably indifferentr students, they are usually ground down to
mediocracy by the time they get their tenured status. I certainly don't
trust them to notice the best writing around them, do you?

Dick Higgins:

Why 40% unemployment? Where does this number come from? At your first mention
of it, I figured you were employing hyperbole or sarcasm.  Responding to M.
Boughn's post, however, 40% crops up again, and in a disturbing context, i.e.,
you say it as if you believe it.  Silly as the figure itself is, there's a kind
of logic inferred that "when it happens" the unemployed masses will register at
universities on an unimaginable scale to become (what else?) "english majors,"
and thus learn from professors the skills that may saved them in the first
place, but will certainly rescue them now.

40% !!!!!!!

On a somewhat related topic, has anyone heard from the Wobblies (I.W.W.) in
their area?  They have a Web page which posts a new Preamble and Constitution

Dear Jonathan Levin:

Please send me your e-mail address-iot seems I do not have it and I would
like to remain in contact with you after I leave the POETICS BB, probably
temporarily (I am going to a conference on visual poetry in Mexico and
after that will have to do dumb stuff to survive for a bit. It will be
close to Valentine's before I can log onto this one again.

By the way, my grandfather (who was born in 1874) heard Emerson speak on
his last tour of New England, circa 1885(?) and remembered surprisingly
much of the experience. Maybe it isn't so surprising, since Emerson was a
family model. In fact my grandmother, who came from Missouri, when she
first visited the family before marrying my grandad, cazme down to her
first breakfast and found the family sitting around a big table, eating
fish chowder and arguing passionately about RWE. She burst into tears,
feeling she had wandered into a madhouse, and ran back upstairs. It took
her some time to get used to our now-vanished Yankee ways. Anyway, it makes
RWE seem not so very long ago (and in another sense he really isn't, is
he).

Fluxily yours-

Dear Daniel Bouchard:

The 40% figure is one I have heard several times as a projection. Maybe the
editors of CHALLENGE, the Economics magazine from Rutgers (which is pretty
much cutting edge). It is usually cited as a result of the anti-liberal (I
shudder to call them conservative) dismissal of Lord Keynes's insights as
"liberal theory." They are theory in the sense of being underlying
principles, like the theory of gravity, not in the colloquial sense of "I
have a theory about sao-and-so." And they are not particularly liberal
either. THe main one which is scary here is the notion underlying
"trickle-down" wealth politics that if the rich prosper, they will pull
along the rest of us, so their taxes can and should be lowered. The problem
is, in microcosm, that while the rich can indeed buy food and necessities
and can also buy luxuries the making of which create jobs, when they
prosper they do not eat more food and consume more basics while at the same
time there is a ceiling on the number of yachts which they can buy. The
result is that ordinary people, who proportionately must pay more of the
tax load, certainly are not about to buy yachts and must eventually be left
without food and necessities, which creates a terrible downward spiral in
the economy as a whole, a "crisis of production," as they say, in other
words a depression. Our problem is that our social net is being removed and
there is insufficient support for stiffening Clinton's wobbly resistance to
removing it. Further, the Republicans steamroller tactics and vast wealth
and their focus on ballancing the budget, as if we were talking about a
home economics situation. Daddies and mommies or other forms of family
don't usually think of their children or partners as their market, and so
the oft-cited parallel between a home budget and a national one simply does
not apply., because of these things and the Republicans believing their own
propoganda, we are not likely to be able to install a new set of safety
nets as rapidly as we did in 1932, so our unemployment will probably
approach 40%, as it did in the 1870's, rather than only 27% as it did in
our so-called "Great Depression."

Well, when that happens people will learn what art is for (I believe though
I cannot prove that). But that  will be small consolation. Besides I will
probably be among the next to be homeless, being 58 and perenially
"overqualified" for every job I apply for.

Sincerely

I know it is a kind of prejudice, but I don't think anyone who uses
CompuServe with a slow modem can be considered an authority on the cost
of using the internet. Please do not misread this as a flame. I feel an

Hello all,

Good times at MLA: it was nice to meet Charles, and Marjorie, and
Aldon, and Doug Messerli, and Albert Mobilio, and others there.  (Sorry I
missed you maria d.).

I was sick part of the time, and unable to see many good-sounding talks.
I was also interviewing and particularly lousy times.  Anyway. . . .

Several good papers/panels: one of the best was not "read" but rather
talked in the manner of a scientific paper, summarized due to a lack of
time, making a virtue of necessity, by Ming-Quin Ma at Stanford.  Is he on
this list?  If not, why not?  The paper in question was "'Not quite that':
Smithson, Scalapino, and the Poetics of Aeolotropy."  I would love a copy.

Another good panel: the Rothenberg/Joris discussion almost at the end of
the conference, with good comments also by Jed Rasula, on POEMS FOR THE
MILLENIUM.  Very informative.

Outside the conference there was a wonderful reading by Douglas Messerli
and Charles Bernstein at the City Gallery of Contemporary Art.

I can't rightly evaluate my own panel, but I remain inordinately fond of
my talk (on Bourdieu and poetic value).  It was disheveled but fun to
give, shocking certain folks in the audience.  The other paper (on Paul
Monette) was so different it was almost comic, yet it actually made for
good discussion.

I will send a disk version to the EPC if an archive is really being
prepared.  Anybody who wants a hard copy can email me with snail-mail
address -- I've copies aplenty.  (Those who have already asked for it
will receive soon).

Cheers,
David

Subject:      Re: The English Dept. of the Soul and the New World Order

well i feel a bit caught in this recent exchange, for several reasons...

first, i'm not interested really in saving anguish depts. anymore than i am
in saving souls... don byrd's ostensibly utopian urging is right on
target---let's mix the anguish folks, like moi, with, say, falafelsers, er,
i mean, let's see if we can talk to one another (doesn't the network
suggest such linkages?)... as to separating anguish lit. from comp., this
point has been covered/resisted well, but i could offer a bit more about my
situation here at iit----

gnaw...

anyway, i figger that since i'm connected to the anguish profession i have
an obligation to make it better... however complex this latter may be in
actuality i'll say it again---i just wanna make it better--teaching,
publishing whatever... b/c i figger what i do has *some* blasted thing to
do with making things better in general, even if i have to give something
of mself... not to say that i don't wish to make my own life better
somehow... and of course i don't believe that the singular motive for one's
contributions should be making things better... it's just one motive, one
that operates once in a while...

that sd, i may as well say right upfront that i'm interested to a point in
marxist style-class-based-market-economy institutional analysis--TO A
POINT... past a certain, usually vulgar point i prefer to eat a peach, and
wear my trousers unrolled... to be explicit just for a sec:  i don't like
it when folks tell me they aspire to NO class consciousness... i feel like
simultaneously laughing and throwing up... and me, i like my bananas nice
and yellow... it's the same with dis/agreement---seems to me there's a
binary here worth getting through...

yeah, sure, there are more important things than changing the anguish
profession... but changing the anguish profession, or making more room for
art (yknow---art? that pain in the ass), or cleaning the fridge may be
damned important things... depends on where one is...

and yeah sure, what of it that lots of folks in these parts are anguish
profs?... i mean, that's part of *this* scene, *this* situation... one
might expect it to work its way into the discussion, much as one might
expect talk of emedia to proliferate around here from time to time...

just a few noninklings, as per...

best,
bset,

pierre and jerry a bit (by the end of the conference was referring to ben and

walter lew's anthology Premonitions and mark nowak's North American
Ideophonics, and give Ben and Jerry's some detailed (if somewhat critical
though mostly enthusiastic) airtime. rasula's more inspired invective drew
most of the audience and respondent response, which is as it should be.  got

coffee house press dropped my essay from the forthcoming Bob Kaufman

me.  told my beloved editor at UMN press, who responded, well, it hasn't
translated into sales, i can tell you that.

right now radio playing dylan don't think twice it's all right, nearly split

Thanks, joe amato, for a good-sense statement about how you feel about all
this english/anguish. I'm not in it, but I'm all for one who wants to make
it better some or any of the time. All the time would probably be too much,
aspiring to that NO class consciousness that makes you want to laugh & throw
up (me, too, although sometimes I admire a "no class" consciousness, and I
think very highly of the "no mind" Zen state).

But even though I agree with you there, I have to say that I like my bananas
still just a touch firm, just before they begin to soften. And I like banana
popsicles, always have.

Believe there are large parts of the globe where it has.
NAFTA, GATT, etc. are simply extensions of this to "developed"
countries. Though many of those jobs being scrambled for are  10 cents an

Seems we are at a point technologically where unemployment could be a goal

Over half of the world's population lives more than two hours travel

Thanks, Dick, for telling us what we should be discussing and the
meaning of poetics. However, as to your prediction,

"Frankly, I dislike the web-but I must live with it. As for access, it
will be even more accessible as web machines become more common-Sun is
the only one making and selling one now, but every manufacturer has one
"in the tube" (literally). Those will cost ca. US$550-an amount
comparable to a video player here and presumably the same, comparably,
in the UK."

You heard it here first. That's an idea that will be as popular as the
Edsel. Like re-inventing the monograph record. Also, that's about 3
times the cost of a decent video player. I wonder just how many stupid
consumers there are out there and my guess is not that many. Remember,
all the new developments get adopted in the home first. One year ago,
the Pentium was a chip sold 95% of the time to home users. Windows 95
is a home OS right now. It will begin to reach critical mass in the
corporate environment maybe a year from now.

But then Sun was the company that invented the program Java originally
to allow for remote control of coffee pots (10 years ago, in fact).
Talk about the law of unintended consequences....

Now that's poetics,

Ron

Actually I have a 14,400-thingy modem which was pretty much state of the art
when I bought it but I suppose is rubbish now. In fact, I'm fairly happy with
CompuServe, using it mostly for e-mail, and I don't consider the $10 monthly
minimum charge (which I rarely exceed) too bad. It has a nice easy Macintosh
interface which suits technological dimbos like me. But the point I was making
was: anyone wanting to get on the internet from scratch has to invest in a
decent computer, software, modem, printer and subscription to some kind of
online service provider. That's thousands of pounds/dollars worth of investment
- and it's not that easy to decide what to get and how to set it up when you get
it. In my case, I already had the computer and printer, because I need them for
my work - but I have plenty of friends who don't even have a computer. (Others,
including many on this list, use the facilities at their place of work, eg
college.) As for my parents and their generation... forget it, the whole thing's
a foreign country to them.

I'm neither an "authority" on the internet nor a technophobe - just living in

Well, when I began moderating I was using an XT two years ago, running at
4.33 mhz with 1 megabyte ram and a 20 megabyte hard-drive; the modem was
9600. The point is that if you use Unix shell or other text-based inter-
faces, it costs very little (the XT was $100 and the on-line cost was $15
or so a month). This is an important point because for example I'm
working with conferencing people at this point - and the Web _is_
basically expensive, awkward, non-interactive in spite of Java, and
requires high-speed hookup, etc. Which separates people even more. The
reasonable temporarly solution is lowest common denominator, unless we're
restricting ourselves to the upper middle classes - look at Prodigy or
Web demographics and you'll see what I mean. Don't forget that even on
the Web, Lynx is the second most popular browser next to Netscape.

There are areas in which hookup, if possible at all, is at 300 baud
during certain (somewhat flickering, random) hours of the day.

Thanks Joe! I can't stand it when people just say "Talk about something
different" but don't suggest a topic.

I found I disagreed with Don Byrd (unusual) because to me it's the readers
that determine the canon. College teachers can only get people to take courses
that they want to take, and libraries sell off books that aren't read. OTOH,
I would take just about any course Byrd offered. Ever since I read his
book on Olson and heard his "Dimestore" he's been one of my faves. I have
him batting cleanup in my starting lineup, but I put him at third base. (He
has the scars to prove it I'm sure.)

Sorry to talk about you in the third person, Don.

I'm also interested only in making "it" better, which, coincidentally, includes
all of humanity reading poetry I like (and my poetry too, ((to be honest.)))

        Good lord! what did I say, or seem to say?

        It must have been my comments about keeping the archive that were
misunderstood.  I did not mean to imply a restrictive archive.  University
libraries should try to archive every thing, every zine, every tape of
every poetry reading, and university faculties should mostly try to figure
out how to organize the stuff in the archive for maximus use.(Teaching is
the generally the wrong concept; they should lead their students on trips
into the archive.)

         I don't necessarily mean stuffy librarianship. My _Dimestore_ which
Pete kindly mentions is an essay in how to access the archive.

        It's amazing how much yatter English departments occasion on the
list. Here and there one finds interesting people in them, but generally
speaking English departments are dinosaurs, and most of the attempts to
discover some contemporary relevancy in them have lacked all conceptual
depth and, for the most part, they have lacked adequate information as
well...

        It seem likely to me, at this point, if there is something to be
found in the archive or some new combination of things that might relieve
the extremity of our condition, the last place your likely to hear about
it will be in an English department. (Of course, I do not include those of
us on this list who are in English departments in this blatant
generalization. But it is almost certain that to the extent that someone
knows something, English departments will try to prevent them from
teaching it, and if they publish something that is not a rehash of the
discourse of the day, English departments are likely not to recognize its
value....)

        When Jack Spicer talked about the English department of the soul,
he surely meant that one corner of the soul that is beyond salvation.

        And I say all of this without sour grapes. I mean, I have no personal
grouch.   The university has been generally good to me.

A story with a little relevance to the current discussion.

When I was an undergraduate at Sydney Uni (years and years ago) there was
an active poetry society which ran regular readings on campus. More the
most part these readings were lively events which blew a breath of
contemporary fresh air into the ivy covered stone walls. On a few
occasions, however, poets where prevented from entering the campus by the
security guards on the gates for various reasons (the proper procedure for
bringing a car onto campus had not been followed -ie the academic who had
signed the form was not of a high enough level . Interestingly, business
people driving expensive modern cars who where going to Economics of the
Business school did not seem to face the same problem as poets driving
twenty year old rust buckets). On one particular occasion a fight broke out
between a poet and the guard. Instead of reading to eager undergraduates
the poet ended up at the local police station.

"Aeolotropy"? The tendency of poets to gravitate to America Online?

Well, I haven't gotten off my posterior and done it. I should look at
doing so (since I suggested it) if no one else is going to take up da
gauntlet.

Anyone know the range of dates/digests in which the renga flourished

Business? Which business? Academics? The construction of books?
Theory? Poetry performance? Grocery stores?

And I can think of little that can be send about anything that would
not have any chance of offending somebody.

Subject:      Poetry & that horrid Web

I've just a few comments in response to some of the more sceptical posts
regarding the Web, including Alan Sondheim's:

>the Web _is_
>basically expensive, awkward, non-interactive in spite of Java, and
>requires high-speed hookup, etc. Which separates people even more. The
>reasonable temporarly solution is lowest common denominator, unless we're

I'd suggest that, first of all, once one is talking about people with
computers, let alone Net or Web access, one is already dealing with those
either in a high-income bracket or with institutional resources. On the other
hand, most of those institutions (such as public libraries) offering free
public access to the net have been encouraged by the ease with which the
technically-challenged can use the Web. Not many people without a specialist
education would be interested in hacking away with Unix commands on a public
terminal, but the Web's graphical appeal has opened up the Internet to a wider
range of people, especially in the arts.

I'd concede that the Web has poor interactivity in the context of conferencing,
but it is already more interactive than television or print media. Methods such
as Usenet or IRC are more interactive than the Web, but only if you are dealing
with plain text. People with interests in visual or audio information must
resort to other methods, and it's interesting that the new forms of multimedia
activity (such as RealAudio & VRML) are all using the Web as a starting point.
Web browsers already bring together the older Net technologies (Gopher, FTP,
Telnet et al), and HTML has become such a useful and popular way of visualising
the Internet that I think the Web will be at the core of any new developments.

Someone else said that the Web was boring, it was just like TV. Well, I'd admit
that most of what's on the Web these days is rubbish, but then, as someone
whose name escapes me at the moment said, "90% of everything is crap". And one
way that the Web has it all over TV is that you can choose what you want to
browse, when you want to. With one's bookmarks or homepage one can essentially
weave one's own little "sub-web": the Web for me essentially consists of
poetry, criticism, wine reviews, my favourite bands, art galleries, great
utilities to download, hypertext fiction and philosphy. The multitude of crass
adverts, dull personal pages and Doom FAQs might as well not exist, unless I
have a reason to go searching for them.

The most exciting thing about the Web, I think, is global hypertext. When I
write a piece of criticism for a journal, then put it on my Web pages, I do
Lycos or Inktomi searches on some of the key names and phrases in the article
and add hyperlinks to the best resources that I find. For example, in a review
of books by the Wellington poets Dinah Hawken and James Brown, I was able to
place links to information on Sappho, Ghalib, Bukowski, Laurie Anderson, Ron
Silliman & Roland Barthes among others. For readers of pages that have been
thoughtfully and generously hyperlinked, there _is_ a kind of interactivity:
the paths that one cuts through cyberspace can be seen as creative acts.

It will take a long, long time for the majority of people to have net access,
and some areas, in particular those such as literature that have been
traditionally technophobic, will take longer than others. That's why there's a
need for interfaces between the Web and local arts communities (for example,
journals that publish print and electronic versions in parallel). There are
exciting international electronic communities of artists developing, but it's
dangerous to insulate oneself from more traditional communities.


        Cheers,
                Tom Beard.


(P.S. The Web browser that I use most often is Lynx: we are a branch office,
and connect to the Internet via a sloooww link to Wellington, so Mosaic etc are
out of the question. The Web journal that I'm designing is being optimised
for Netscape - 65% of web users use Netscape, and most others use browsers that
support tables etc. For the 5% or so of us (that's the latest statistic that
I've come across) using Lynx, I'm still making sure that everything is legible,
even if it's not pretty. There's nothing I hate more than following a promising
link to a page that is blank apart from [ISMAP] in the top left corner.

In-Reply-To:  <96010501063830@met.co.nz>

In response I just want to point out there are a _lot_ of people with
286s or 386s out there with slow modems; these computers also seep down
the economic scale - and they're really not particularly Web capable. I
think the Web, VRML, etc., is divisive at the moment. A lot of areas in
the world, as I pointed out, don't have high-speed modem capability, and
they're completely excluded. And we can either accept de facto that the
Web is for the privileged or we can try and work with Unix _and_ the Web
and in fact become involved politically with the issue in a whole lot of
ways.

As far as interactivity goes, yes, Netscape's great at calling up any-
thing. But telnet isn't part of the Web of course; either are ftp and
gopher - they're called up in Netscape through conforming URLs. And the
interesting interactive clients - say MIRC, Global Chat, CuSeeMe,
ThePalace, all are off-Web; they may use the Web for addressig (as Powwow
does) but they basically run their own software through the TCP/IP stack.
Finally, there's also the psychological effect of constant engorgement of
audio/video/clients (I've been writing a lot about this) which then ties
arts and literatures into issues of _development,_ and I find that
problematic; don't forget that even hypertext is mediated by corporate
development - this medium is overdetermined by capital whether we like it
or not.

After some of the points other have made, maybe I'm wrong. Maybe a regular user
is the best person to ask about this. It's possible that users of the major
services with slower modems are more in touch with the "real" world. I spend
many evening hours chatting poetry on IRC. I enjoy having an open reading going
on in my kitchen. Compuserve would cost *me* too much. I shouldn't have ass-
umed so much about you.

I still think that the web is the tool I've wanted to circumnavigate the big
publishers, and

look at this listserv! I am starstruck by these poets whose work I've enjoyed
for years with whom I can converse and spar a little. It inspires me to write
more. (Thanks, Charles.)

I'm glad you saw yourself in that mirror. Being new, I'm unsure of the
protocol regarding posting poems to the list. I'm sure though, that it's
ok to post when asked, and I think I was just asked so:

The best recommendations I've gotten for reading material were not from
English teachers. I ask the poets I like who they like. My English teachers
were good at teaching survey courses or Shakespeare, but they all thought
poetry ended sometime in the twenties.

Two questions about word origins and meaning....

(1) Who first used Bests as a salutation, specifically with that "s" at
the end. I've been seeing it since the mid-60s when I associated it (if
those brain cells haven't been miswired) with Berkson et al, the
so-called 2nd generation NY school. How far back does it go?

(2) How has the word "renga" changed in your conception of it over the
past year as a result of this list?

Subject:      "Direct" book/box and catalog

A pamphlet/catalog as well as a limited edition book/box is presently available
from the "Direct" one-week "Nomad" performance-installation-show that was held
at the Galerie Forde and the Cinema Spoutnik in October in Geneva, Switzerland.


The event was organized by Guenther Ruch.  The "Nomads" for this venue included
Guenther Ruch (Germany/Switzerland), Juergen Olbrich (Germany), Jean-Noel Laszlo
(France), Dougal (Scotland) and me, Ward Tietz (USA).  The Nomads project was
begun in 1986 by Juergen Olbrich and others as an invitational and
location-specific format for artists to meet and work on projects for a limited
time. Other venues have included Kassel, Germany (1986), Calgary, Canada
(1988)...

These projects have primarily been an extension of the mail-art network that
developed in the 1970s and 80's.  While these projects have certainly not been
literary in any direct sense, there has been considerable overlap into what we
could call "quasi-literary" forms, most notably visual poetry, as mail art
investigated a modality of language and paper-based communication that was to a
large extent anti-discursive.  My own interest in projects such as this have
been along these lines.  The often contradictory and perhaps ironic potential of
the anti-discursive vis-a-vis literature is that it cannot be staged or directly
formed "in" literature.  It must be projected and staged outside of literature
and then be reimported, but often only as a series of fragments.

The book/box (33cmx26cmx5cm) is a signed, limited edition of 49 boxes.  It
includes found, treated and other texts that relate to the week's activities as
well as objects (eg. treated x-rays etc.).  The price is 80 Swiss francs (about
$70).  The pamphlet, which includes descriptions of the week's activities, also
functions as a catalog for the mail-art show (103 artists participated) that was
part of the week's events.  The pamphlet/catalog is available for 8 Swiss francs
(about $7).  Those interested can contact me directly.

The following is an except from one of the pages of the book/box:

"October 7, 1995

Description of two actions:

Today, October 7, 1995, we did two actions outside near the river.  The first
involved the use of five different letters that were cut out from old x-rays.
Ten-meter lengths of film were stapled to the letters and used to dangle the
letters into the river from a bridge near the gallery.  Guenther had made a
capital "H", I had made an "O" and Juergen and Dougal used "A"'s that Dougal had
already made.  I set up the camera and Colette took most of the photographs.  I
took a few as well...."

Can't answer number one. As to two, as a result of this list renga still
remains primarily the Japanese form it's been for a long time, and something
else entirely on this list, making me wish what the list takes it for had a
different name entirely. But words do migrate, so . . .

As someone who affects this affectation, I can only say I got "Bests" from
a friend in high school in the late 60s.  She was not one of the "so-called
2nd generation" of anything, as far as I know.

It's difficult (but not impossible) to imagine this particular person
reading, say, Berkson et al, back then (or now for that matter, though we
aren't in touch), so there's probably an Ur-source from outside the poetry
world.

Subject:      towards a new poetics

        I found Serge Gavronsky's introduction to his collection "Towards A New
Poetics: Contemporary Writing in France" to be very instructive and
insightful. He comments that cutting edge writers there are, while still
coming out of a context of self-awareness about ecricture (that writing
preceeds speech, that language determines conditions of meaning), moving
away from the hard-edged ideology of Tel Quel towards refiguring a
variety of possibilities disavowed by the Tel Quel writers (lyricism,
mainly, but also a focus on the "everyday"). I found this similar to some
arguments I've been making about the formal multiplicity of
"post-language writers"--that, without abandoning the theoretical
insights of language poetry, a number of writers are moving towards
incorporating a wider variety of elements into those insights. I'm
wondering, though, if there's anybody on this list with awareness about
contemporary writing in France who disagrees with Gavronsky's descripton
of the situation there. Can anybody help me out?

Thanks.

I'm not an expert on contemporary French writing, but I can offer a couple of
observations based on recent experience.  My impression is that the situation in
French poetry is perhaps a little more complex than you describe.  I went to a
presentation and discussion in Geneva a few months ago put on by editions POL (a
fairly well-known French press) to inaugurate their new book-format magazine and
I got the impression that they were pursuing a fairly eclectic agenda,
publishing old and new work together, that is looking to history to validate
their new projects.  In a way this is probably consistent with Gavronsky's
description, but as a method it wasn't very convincing.

Interestingly my Genevois friends (Geneva is French-speaking) find the French
literary magazines rather conservative, conservative in the sense that French
writing goes it's own course often unaware of developments in say the English
speaking or German speaking world.  This can be a strength or a handicap
depending on the context and milieu and at present they seem to feel it's a
handicap.

In 1992 Le Refuge in Marseilles, which functions as a poetry archive, reading
and research space, put out a special pamphlet entitled Etats Generaux de la
Poesie.  This overview outlines a rather different state of affairs, with an
emphasis on the extended dimensions of literature, including sound and visual
production.  This is in part because of Julien Blaine's influence, but to some
extent Le Refuge does function as a refuge for this type of work, as well as the
more traditional radical strains.  They put out a pamphlet every few months or
so, which generally covers recent readings, presentations and exhibitions.  You
can get onto their mailing list by writing to them at:

Re the use of "bests" and a connection with Bill Berkson, I wonder if you
don't connect the word with him because of his one-shot magazine "BEST &
COMPANY" (which was named for a long-defunct department store). In my
youth I corresponded with a fair number of 2nd generation New York school
poets and I don't recall "bests" being used, though of course "best" or
"all best" with the "wishes" or "regards" understood was/is common,
without being restricted to 2nd gen NY school.  since dropping the
wishes, regards, etc, also leaves out the plural, it would make sense to
pluralize the now nominalized adjective, dui bu dui?

Well, I've started work on compiling the POETICS renga hypertext.
Looks like the programming part should be fairly sraightforward.
I'm going to have some structural questions along the way, though --
things got a little wonky when someone put a new line above the first
(so what do the lines that follow that follow?) and, if I recall,
somewhere along the line someone changed an existing line.
More as I get to it... BTW,FWIW, the starting date was

Brad,

Mimeos still exist. Gestetner still exists. Xerox has become
more common throughout the world. Viz the following:

"Internet Use Growing In China

               (Boston Globe:  Jan. 4, p. 52)


With less than 1% of China's 1.2 billion population owning PCs, the
market here is expected to grow 36% a year for at least the next
five years.  One of the biggest reasons for the high demand is the
popularity of the Internet among the Chinese who do own computers.
There are now 2.5 million PCs in use.  The Chinese government is
concerned about the access that dissidents might have to the
Internet and it remains to be seen how much freedom PC users are
allowed to have and whether small entrepreneurial companies inside
China are permitted to create Internet products."

The problem with the internet is not so much the cost of production
(although those Sun webservers don't come cheap) as it is the cost of
consumption. PCs will arrive in about 1 percent of the homes in China
sometime around the millenium (i.e. 5 years from now). Most of the
African sites I know of are basically western academic research
facilities camped on African soil. In fact, most of the poets in the US
are not connected yet. I'm not discounting the web's potential, just
trying to give it a sense of context.

DF Brown (who may be lurking on this list -- Hi David) tells a story of
how he got introduced to poetry. He was in Nam during the war and came
back to base camp one night after the local "book drop" had been
distributed. All the popular books (Louis Lamour novels, etc) had been
grabbed, but still in the bottom of the box was a copy of Creeley's
Pieces.

Books have an ability to travel to places the internet will never
reach...

                                I like the thought that these are Web
"presses". That apporach helps put Web circulation ona plane parallel
to print and helps to dispel the romantic notion that if it's printed
on paper someone will read it. (Per the comment that - what was it
half the world lives some distance from the nearest phone line? - If a
person were thus remote it doesn't mean the first thing they would
pack in would be a book.) And anyone who has published via a small
press (everyone here?)  just because it's published doesn't mean
someone will read it. Per luigi, nor buy it. So, like a press, it's a
mechanism for _putting it out there_. There are some people reading
the web who aren't reading books. It's also a way to circulate
writings without the labor/consumption of materials involved in print
(of course it also becomes more ephemeral--somewhat like publishing
your book on newsprint) and without the TIME lag inherent (though not
technologically binding) of the publisher/printing/process.

                                Curiously it may be a 'control' isssue
ie that people feel that if it's in a book it's more under control
that if it's in electrons. Control is simply tough in any format. When
Michael Jackson can own Beatles songs and sell them for commercials, I
think there isn't any control in any form. Control is tough. Best
control is the desk drawer, I suppose.

                                So what gives? Per luigi's thought, is
it a matter of selling it? I guess it depends what you write
_for_. Circulation, fame, the creation of a marketable commodity. If
it's circulation, the web will NOT immediately (NOR EVER--don't forget
that CD-ROMs (physical, sellable, packaged 'information' products) may
be the closer parallel to BOOKS than the Web--the Web is more similar
to old radio programs with poets) replace the book. But perhapst here
are certain texts more appropriate to the Web--out of print chapbooks,
a writing about Chiapas, an essay just delivered at the MLA to which
you'd like to receive some feedback, a specific chapbook of your
wrting that you'd like to circulate--may all either satisfy their own
purpose by being read--or produce a later sale of your work since
people have a sense of what it's about.

Books are expensive; the Net's not. It's as simple as that. I can't
afford poetry books and for the cost of two of them can read on-line day
in and day out for a month. My own work is totally available on the Net,
even the recent articles. Very few people would ever print it in any
case, and this way people can see for themselves. The Net's democratizing
and flattens power. You want to read it, you read it. You want to delete,
you delete...

As far as the initial costs go, for the first year (as I think I've
pointed out) I used an old IBM XT I purchased for $100, or around $8.50 a
month.

Subject:      rhythm

I chanced on _Telling Rhythm_ recently and was intrigued
by the conception of poetic rhythm as a route to and
from the "prison of language".   There is, of couse, space
here to only include brief quotes, but I am interested in
responses from members of the list..

Tom Bell -

     "Poems are allegories  of the sublime power of their
rhythm.  Their images and themes represent the power of rhythm,
while the very words that convey to us these images and themes
physically manifest that rhythm.  Yet at the same time, the
power of rhythm is not a meaning effect; it does not
participate in the process of signification.  It is a power
without rational meaning - a sublime force.  The images and
themes of poetry are ways of telling rhythm and thus of
representing the unrepresentable, and these elements of
content also represent their _inability_ to fulfill
their mission.  Yet the specific manner in which the
language of a poem attempts and fails to represent
the sublime power of its rhythm and in which it
acknowledges the fact that rhythm is beyond its
reach - _how_ the poems language tells this
story - an be meaningfully situated in history and
culture.  Poetry is a moment of encounter between
the specifically, historically engaged and the sublime,
between the socially constructed body and the rhythmic
body at free play among constructs.  As such, poetry
challenges socially prevailing concepts, dislodging them
momentarily so that they can change as part of historical
processes."  Aviram, Amittai, _Telling Rhythm: Body and
Meaning in Poetry_, Ann Arbor, MI, University of Michigan
Press, 1994, p. 223.

p. 131.  Sublimity in Nietzshe is to be found not in the next
world but in this; it is not ordinarily visible, not because
it is essentially not physical, but precisely because we are
constructed as metaphysical subjects and therefore blind to
it.  Poetry at least leads us in the direction of undoing that
metaphysical subjectivity and opening the way to the sublimity
of the physical world."

p. 24.  in this case the figures of speech indicate something
that cannot be brought into speech diretly - the physical
experience of the sublime power of sound and rhythm.

Tom Bell posted, quoting Aviram Amittai, "Poems are allegories of the sublime
power of their rhythm.  Their images and themes represent the power of rhythm,
while the very words that convey to us these images and themes physically
manifest that rhythm.... The images and themes of poetry are ways of telling

This is a stirring argument, one that quite openly ventures to restore a
transcendent quality to poetry.  To be possible , at least on my reading of this
excerpt, this seems to depend on a change of emphasis, form "representation" to
"enactment," on the level of production and reception.  This I find a very
timely and provocative idea, since it gets to the very base of mediation.

Enactment probably should  begin to replace representation in certain contexts,
but how can this be implemented?  This is in part a semiotic argument.  As far
as I can tell from this excerpt Amittai is arguing for rhythm, because he
believes it can evade, and therefore by extension, transcend signification.
This is probably not true.  Ray Birdwhistell's work in kinesics ("Kinesics and
Context," U of Pennsylvania P, 1970) proved that at least for some bodily
movements there are isolatable "kinemes," signifying units of movement and
motion.  In his experiments he was able to isolate some twenty-odd kinemes of
the face and head.  A more thorough investigation of rhythm would probably find
it no less mysterious.

Discounting the transcendent quality of Amittai's argument, I would tend to
agree that more kinesthetic or kinemic approaches to literature would be useful.
The distinction between a linguistic (language by itself) and a paralinguistic
(meaningful activity coincident with language) analysis should probably not be
maintained.  The difficulty of this approach is that it demands an almost
complete reevaluation of temporal and spatial models.  At issue is finding a
means of "enacting" enactment.  To that extent I agree completely.

Alan,

I tend not to think of poets as luxuries.

When the Tienamen Square massacre occurred, among the people picked up
and arrested were the members of the ComputerLand franchise there. As I
recall, C'Land lost $9 million worth of PCs in all of that.

Maybe Simon Schuchat or the fellow who's at SUNY from China could speak
to this. My own sense is simply extrapolated from a knowledge of how
things were handled in the old USSR, back when (1) it had all of 33
international phone lines and (2) you need permission from on high to
have the key to the photocopy room. Beyond which is the cost factor,
etc, the applicability of the technology in the local environment.
People who've spent time in Myanmar tell me that there are more
cellular phones per capita there than anywhere. That's one way to avoid
hardwiring the country, but PCs are still 5 years from comfortably
reaching that stage here. Hell, every time I move here, I find myself
dropping new phone lines so that the modem won't tie up the voice line.

Agree with the comments re cost of consumption of Web pages being prohibitive,
but these are early, early days for the Web. I keep seeing articles on video
artists doing "pieces" via ISDN: isn't this much more "elitist" than the Web,
considering the cost of an ISDN connection (at least in this little corner of
the Pacific - several hundred a month if you're lucky enough to be near an
existing cable)? The point is, we can experiment _now_ with the possibilities
of new technology: I don't see any ethical advantage with waiting for the
technology to be as cheap as a VCR.

With minority interest fields such as poetry, the Web can offer wider
distribution than print media. How many of the forementioned 3rd-worlders x
number of km from the nearest phone are likely to be reading a chapbook with a
print-run of 200, anyhow? The Web makes a concept such as "print run" nearly
obsolete. One also gets around the narrow focus of book importers and
retailers: I'd wager that there is more contemporary US & UK poetry (at least
"contemporary" as list-ers here would recognise) on the Web than on all NZ book
shelves combined.

And although yer average Nethead isn't likely to be looking for Langpo on the
Web, it's surprising what one can stumble across when surfing (and I prefer the
verb "stumble" to "surf" - it has a whiff of the almost drunken sensuality that
I feel when groping through the cyberspatial dark at the fag end of a night
shift). I keep being astonished by the delicious obscurity of some of the
subjects I come across, and delighted by the eclectic nature of people's home
pages. It's nice to know that one person can have links to pages on opera,
molecular biology, coffee, The Simpsons, Andy Warhol and Sappho.

As a matter of fact, the first time the potential of the Web really struck
me (a hitherto technoskeptic) was in fall of '93 when I bumped into a
translation by Lyn Hejinian at the IATH site.

It's easier to find Langpo while browsing the Web than while browsing the
shelves of an impoverished rural library or an occasional shopping mall
Waldenbooks, such as the ones I was restricted to in high school. A book
_can_ go places a Web site can't, but chances are that any single book
_will not_ be printed in as many copies as there are readers with access to
that Web site.

Though the initial outlay for one PC is higher than the initial outlay for
one book, the Web offers much wider distribution of a much wider variety of
material than most readers could afford to buy and most publishers could
afford to print. If you publish for any reason other than profit, I don't
see why you wouldn't want to publish on the Web.

since you ask,

I don't think poets are a luxury either.

The role of the poet/writer/public intellectual is somewhat different in
china than in the US, there is a lot of historical baggage tied up with
that.  Liu Binyan's autobiography "A Higher Kind of Loyalty" (I think
Knopf or Pantheon) is very good for understanding that.  A review of Bei
Dao's poetry by Stephen Owen, published in the New Republic probably four
years ago, is also very useful for understanding some of the situation of
the poet in China today.

Interconnectivity seems to be growing in the PRC.  There
are commercial internet providers in the PRC now.  There is also a
growing computer market (I just read that Microsoft and Compaq are
sponsoring a 26 episode sitcom on Beijing TV about a typical urban
Chinese family and their new computer!) although I seem to recall an
estimate of 3 million PCs in all of China.  As long as the focus
is on making money, the authorities will do everything in their power to
encourage it, since they want to be in charge of a rich and powerful
country.  They seem to recognize that only 33 international phone lines
and locking up the xerox machine played a major part in making the Soviet
Union an impoverished, hollow mess.  But they are also afraid of losing
control and recent history suggests they will do whatever they believe is
necessary.

Cell phones are an Asian ubiquity.

Dear All,

First off, hello and happy new year.  I've just this very minute subscribed to this
listserv and look forward to receiving your postings.  As I've only
fairly limited access to e-mail (no on-line terminal at home, and so
dependent on the vagaries of Edinburgh University Library, god bless
'em) my replies and so on might not be a prompt as I'd like.  That
said, a brief announcement . . .

I am currently editing the fifth issue of IBID magazine, a new
writing pamphlet coming out of Edinburgh University.  Previous issues
have included poetry and prose by writers such as Edwin Morgan, Don
Paterson, Jackie Kaye, Ian Crichton Smith, W.N. Herbert, Andrew Greig
etc.  As this list suggests, a Scottish bias is in evidence, although
the editors are anxious to see more work from outwith Scotland and
the U.K. -- a process begun in IBID 3, featuring new work by Bob
Perelman and younger American writers.  Prose, prose-poetry and
experimental work are also strongly encouraged.

Should anyone require more information please e-mail

Alternatively, queries or MSS may be sent to the following address:

I hope that's current, as it's been a long time since I've emailed him. But
I believe the February event is on, that it's February 10, and that it's a
small press book fair, particularly for presses in this area. But you should
ask Mark about the details.

I myself have mixed feelings about the following passage, but thought it
might spark some interest: from Gayatri Spivak, "Scattered Speculations on
the Question of Value" in <In Other Worlds>:

"The literary academy emphasizes when necessary that the American tradition
at its best is one of individual Adamism and the lossening of frontiers. In
terms of political activism within the academy, this free spirit exercises
itself at its best by analyzing and calculating predictable strategic
effects of specific measures of resistance: boycotting consumer items,
demonstrating against investments in countries with racist domestic
politics, uniting against genocidal foreign policy. Considering the role of
telecommunication in entrenching the international division of labor and
the oppression of women, this free spirit should subject its unbridled
passion to the same conscientious scrutiny. The 'freeing' of the subject as
superadequation in labor-power entails an absence of extra-economic
coercion as exploitation is hidden from sight in 'the rest of the world.'

"These sentiments expressed at a public forum drew from a prominent U.S.
leftist the derisive remark: 'She will deny the workers their capuccino!' I
am not in fact suggesting that literary critics should be denied
word-processors. My point is that the question of Value in its
'materialist' articulation must be asked as the capuccino-drinking worker
and the word-processing critic actively forget the actual
price-in-exploitation of the machine producing coffee and words." p. 167.

How is this related to the charge that Language Poetry is elitist?

   Dear george hartley---it seems one must make several steps in order to
   "apply" spivack's statement to the question of whether language poetry
   is elitist. First, she's dealing with "critics" and "academic" workers
   primarily, and the picture she paints of her antagonistic interlocutor
   seems purposely absurd: "she will deny our cappicino!" Spivack is of
   (delete "of") is echoing Marx's definition of what property is, as if to
   reassure one that they will be allowed to keep their trinkets, etc.
   and that the current ideology of "middle classes" is an ideological
   ruse and that almost all of us are PROPERTYLESS and workers and thus
   working against our own interests when we engage in acts, or further
   ideologies, that appeal to the bourgeoisie. Now--as to whether this
   can be related to "language poetry," the question can go several ways.
   On one level, it seems the question must be taken out of the academy.
   But not only does the poetry circulate in the academy, some of the
   poets do. And the question of how the "poetry" relates to the "poet"
   or the "person" becomes something that might need to be taken up more
   and more, and if there is the same kind of "false consciousness" at work
   in such situations that spivack satirizes in the figure of the cappucino
   colleague. And one may long for a world that DOES NOT FORGET that labour
   power involved, and sees a solidarity with "Juan Valdez", in a classic
   Marxist fashion. Yet it seems (at least in the passage you quoted, but
   even in what I've read of Spivack's larger project) that the force of
   critique stops there, and since SHE TOO is implicated in "the teaching
   machine" that, on one level, the proletarian interests she may claim to
   speak for becomes equally textualized---and just as a friend of mine once
   caught robert bly, an avowed vegetarian, red handed with red-meat, one
   may question how her ideological war against INDIVIDUALIST atoms may
   mystify a very particular investment she has in individualism. Just
   maybe! Insofar as certain poetries (whether lang or no) call attention
   to the realpolitik of the academic workplace and its relationships to
   global capitalism, they may be seen as allied to Spivack's project
   (though not insofar as she's "against literature" and even "literature
    against literature" as such). And that much of it does call attention
   to the possibility that CAPPUCINO and WORD PROCESSORS are not necessarily
   indicative of "progress" or "privilege" or the other images propogated
   by media hype of the benefits of increasingly alienated labour, but in
   fact as alienating as the migrant fruit workers, the $1 a day home-labour
   subaltern: The YUPPIE-FLU "service economy" technocrat is as unhappy in
   his or her "privilege" as the overworked coffee picker. WAKE UP AND SMELL
   THE COFFEE means that the top-heavy consumer and the bottomheavy producer
   can be united and some kind of cultural revolution should occur that
   allows the lower classes the privilege of labouring in the mind and
   at the same time stops over-comodifying INTELLECTUAL LABOUR-POWER in the
   academy ("publish or perish") and gives up on the idea of the autonomous
   "work" of the intellect that likes to delude itself it's FULFILLED by
   labouring in the mind every day and every night, the mind and only the
   mind AND HAS TO PAY TO GO TO A GYM TO WORK-OUT because those needs are
   not being met by its profession. Therefore, of course, it's elitist.
   But then we are all implicated---even the "easy to understand" poets.
   I left a lot of holes, but I guess I kinda made my point.

Chris: can't completely agree here. It's true -- truer than many would
acknowledge -- that the position of intellectual (better, I think,
*teaching*) laborer is an alienated one. But I can't make the leap from
the alienation (in the technical Marxian sense) of that worker to the
hard-core class and North/South exploitation (and homeland destruction)
of the coffee pickers. Among other things, this seems to erase a great
deal of history.

2) While it's true that Spivak's personal life seems not altogether to
comport with her theoretical positions, as you suggest, you could also
look at it in terms of her *professional* life, wherein she has, often
singlehandedly, created or defended positions that have turned out, in
retrospect, to have a great deal of value in contradistinction to the
more orthodox views of the time. I think in the passage from "Scattered
Speculations," for example, she is point to some of the self-satisfaction
expressed by early 80s campus activists and the implication of same in
the systems they were apparently contesting. In retrospect this
phenomenon seems real. There are much better examples, though, like her
defense of deconstruction, and her continued support/defense of Marx, and
her insistence on reading the figure of "woman" in Derrida, and so on.

3) How to relate this to langpo? Howabout this: to ask the question, what is
the degree to which -- or maybe where is the dividing line -- between
persons who engage in langpo-type writing because of their commitment to a
(whatever) perceived subversive/liberatory potential, and those who,
especially through the academy, do so because it's the thing to do of
the moment -- and might be the Blys or Kinnells (Jrs) of another day.
Thus subverting, in their adherence, exactly what the first-named
practitioners had in mind, and doing what to "the project"? And in
the Spivakian spirit, not directly to answer this question, but only
to open it? And if one feels like it, about cultural studies as well?

Sanity drools! over its own excess. - Is this perhaps the press

How might the Chargex card be used in the econonmy of a theory

     Too easily, too easily, dear indebted friends. Awake on the

noon, in Mexico City, the smog stirs. Up the
price-in-exploitation of the machine, violins.
     Hey grinders - sprayed from Hartley's good blade - wouldn't
you say, indubitably, elitism is a class concept: yet is it used
as such by those who (who) "charge it" against - and ex: out of -

Q.E.D.
     The charge of elitism, yawn. An Ionescosaurus charge, _ok_,

     "In this regard, then, the professoriat [who be dat] may
take up the challenge of reconceptualizing classes - workers'
relations to what they produce - only to discover greater
solidarity than they had expected with the political and economic
situations of workers in more demonstrably material jobs." Like
Chris S says. Jameson wouldn't like this homologizing of course,
which is too sixties French for him (Clint, do you grike?). "We
[wee-wees] can
learn from . . . novelists [about] . . . how to use socially
powerful [ ] genres to cut across the grain [Is the bean a
grain], to transvalue [more typically, transvest] the conventions
for reception for which there is already tacit acceptance
[indeed, taciturnly so]. In our electronically mediated
postmodernity, film and television and computer technologies
ought to be the sites for what was once [,huh,] considered the
subversions of the literary avant-garde. And as 'residual' forms,
literary modes of production might find new purposes in
contesting the rhetorical and technological powers (and thus
class divisions) of our new socioeconomic configurations." (Both
quotes, John Carlos Rowe, "The Writing Class," _Politics, Theory,
and Contemporary Culture_, ed. Mark Poster.) But I thought that,
you know, that, like.... Anyway what happens to the configuration
"Spivak" if her project or a bit of it is used to relate
avantgarde writing to "elitism" for the purpose of critiquing
such relations? Like Chris says. Did anyone ever locate her

poetry?

yes, I'm planning as part of a yearly series of readings/talks I
program through the College of St. Catherine-Minneapolis, to host
a regional MICRO:'zine/press showcase & forum on Saturday, Feb 10th.

About 15 parties (or more) have been invited, including Chax Press,
Detour Press, Standing Stones Press, Lightning & Ash, Disturbed
Guillotine, Oracular Editions, Rain Taxi, Wire Mother, Thin Coyote,
etc. etc. etc.  Books & 'zines will be for sale, editors will be
giving a brief (oh... Poetic Briefs, too!)... a brief talk about
their journal, etc.

Also scheduled for this spring are readings by George Kalamaras
and Diane Glancy (the later at the Minneapolis American Indian
Center), a talk by Jack Zipes, etc.

I'll be at this e-mail address today & tomorrow (Tues) if you have
further questions.  Then, I'll be in Maine until the 16th & Buffalo
until the 21st.  Back after that, for the winter haul...

Until...

      David, to make a "leap" between two kinds of exploitation is to make
      a "link." And though this may "erase a great deal of history", if there
      is to be any sense of solidarity between the two, it seems it must
      be made...especially in an America in which many were duped by
      the promise that somehow white-collar work was somehow less exploit-
      ative than blue collar, and that even those in say a $35,ooo a year
      job who are able to buy VCR's etc need to rethink the oppression they
      are subject to and not just in the workplace. Sure, issues such as
      "homeland destruction" are not as acutely felt in the "first world"
      as in other places. But the destruction of inner cities, the displaced
      nomadism, the indentured servant status that is increasingly a reality
      for most academic workers, etc., etc., does wreak havoc too, and
      seems to discourage not only unionization, collective engagement,
      even "community" but its effects can be seen even even on the more
      "basic human"
or "domestic" levels of "love" and the possibility of
      "family". It's not as much of a problem if one is "economically
      secure" but as tenure track job security seems to be going the way
      of the dinosaurs, this myth of individual security that has compensa-
      ted for the breakdown and destruction of our american homelands---
      ie. what used to be called the american dream (not the homelands,
      but the anti-community myth; the "I got mine, don't worry about his")
      seems to call for something more than Spivack's rather specialized
      form of professional "critique"--- Chris

would seem to be a connection here with a good deal of recent poetic
experiments (Clark Coolidge, for instance), where the cognitive context
demanded is one of immediate experience first -- of the material aspects
of language (sound, rhythm, voice, breath) -- and only secondarily (if
at all) semantic reference...

A distinction between presentation and re-presentation might be in order
as well (i.e. to "represent the unrepresentable" might also be read as a
_presentation_ of the unrecognized or unrecognizable, what Brathwaite
has in mind when he writes at the end of _The Arrivants_:

now waking
making

making
with their

rhythms some-
thing torn

and new

that the 'creative' in poetry is precisely its ability to skirt this tear --
to trace the jagged, cutting edge of old and new, known and unknown, real and
unreal, represented and unrepresented. It's certainly worthy of note also that
such terms have a pronounced socio-political significance in Brathwaite's work
and a particular cultural meaning to the conditon which Brathwaite addresses.
The unrepresentable, that is, in our inherited discourse is not so esoteric is
it might sometimes seem...

Some of you on this list had asked about an electronic version of my article
"Writing for the New Millennium," which appeared in the Nov/Dec issue of Poets &
Writers Magazine. I'm pleased to say the article is now available on my new
homepage at:

http://ourworld.compuserve.com/homepages/rkendall

Right now, it doesn't include any of the illustrations, though I hope to add
these later as time permits.

Also on the page you'll find other articles I've written, samples of my poetry,
and the course guide and syllabus for "Hypertext Poetry and Fiction," the class
I teach on-line for the New School for Social Research, which starts Jan. 29.

Thus subverting, in their adherence, exactly what the first-named

the Spivakian spirit, not directly to answer this question, but only
to open it? And if one feels like it, about cultural studies as well?


So, then, what would a subversion of that primal impulse look like? An
academicism? Were Bly and Kinnell academic poets, subverting some radical
impulse (e.g. Snyder's and.. whose?), or were they uninteresting in some
totally new direction? And what exactly is problematic with an academicized
or bandwagon language poetry. It sounds like fun of the most awful and
tedious kind. (The rock and roll stations in new york have dropped the
classic rock format and now only play "modern rock"--commercial
alternative.) That kind of fun, if repeated way past ad nauseam, might
actually get us somewhere.

(Or, the only thing that keeps the class distinction going is the prolonged

of M*A*S*H, Cheers and Miami Vice under my hat)) that film and television
are the _new poetries_ as Rowe suggests in Cabri's post--anybody grok Wm
Gibson's _Difference Engine_ in which Keats gives up med school for
computer graphics? ((I thought "difference engine" meant Gibson was

boosterish, I think the time for keen analysis of the decay of our
situation is (ahem, always-already?) past.

Thank you for Jordan, for wading in where some of us have hesitated. The
question, "Where is the dividing line -- between persons who engage in
langpo-type writing because of their commitment to a (whatever) perceived
subversive/liberatory potential, and those who, especially through the
academy, do so because it's the thing to do of the moment -- and might be
the Blys or Kinnells (Jrs) of another day." [remember this began with "The
question..."] implies that some poetries are more real than others, and
that it requires the right intention for the work to matter. It also
suggests that non-confessional poetry is BIG at the moment in such ways
that I don't quite perceive. Almost a decade ago, I suggested to Charles
Bernstein that Langugae Poetry had "won" -- had earned its place within
the larger poetic context (and along with say "Burning Deck" poetry, was
primary to many of us who had finally found poetry that made us _care_
about poetry). But, as Marjorie Perloff suggested only a few months ago,
(and this is a paraphrase) it ain't that rosy for the language-oriented
poet. Who wins the prizes? Who gets the NEA fellowships, state arts
fellowships? Whose books are big? Occasionally it is someone whose work
delights me. Often, that is far from the case. So let's start a civil war
among those who are doing curious work? Let's throw out those who don't
_seem_ to be true believers? I'm sorry to say, we don't have Andre Breton to
serve as judge and jury... Or rather, I'm happy to say so.

Now, I'm getting off my high horse.

Cheers, Gale

      ZURICH, Switzerland (Reuter) - Albert Hofmann, the Swiss chemist who
invented LSD in 1943, celebrates his 90th birthday Thursday still convinced
his discovery would have medical uses if research had not been blocked by a
worldwide ban.

    Hofmann accidently created ``acid'' while researching a migraine cure at
Swiss chemical company Sandoz in Basle and became the world's first tripper
by testing it on himself, resulting in a hallucinogenic bicycle ride home.

    LSD became the trademark of the 1960s hippie generation, resulting in a
complete ban under narcotics laws that ended research on its potential in
medicinal and psychological treatment.

    ``They tossed out the baby with the bathwater,'' Hofmann told Reuters
from his home near Basle. ``I regret that LSD was banned because it was done
due to abuse by the drug culture, not due to its medical properties.''

    Hofmann said he believes the drug should be made available to the medical
profession, like heroin or morphine, and that psychiatrists should be able to
test it in treating disorders.

    Hofmann received numerous rewards in his career for less controversial
discoveries, including substances for treating old age illnesses, post-birth
bleeding and circulatory problems.

    ``I've been celebrating all week. Last weekend it was colleagues from
around Europe, tomorrow I will have a small private party and at the weekend
there's big family party,'' he said.

right on aldon (courtesy of clr james).  i'm getting to where i can tell yr
posts by the titles alone.  james's monition to not assume in advance the
alienation of any particular type of discourse from the masses reminds me of
one of my favorite anecdotes that i always tell my activist-oriented students
when they complain about the elitist "difficulty" of much theory and poetry
that is ideologically "on the right side."  cesaire was asked about the
"elitism" of writing in a french, and with surrealistic techniques so
sophisticated, erudite and inventive that the simple illiterate martiniquan
peasant had no chance of understanding his verse.  au contraire, he said,
they have less difficulty than anyone in understanding it.  reminds me also
of susan schultz's piece in Chain, where she writes that the local Hawai'ian
poets had no trouble w/ C Bernstein and enjoyed his visit there tremendously,
though the well-meaning lit. faculty of U Hawai'i expressed concern about his
inaccessibility to specifically those poets.

Dear Chris Stroffolino---some brief impulsive responses (now 2 days late)
to your response:
>   1. one must make several steps in order to "apply" spivack's statement to
>the question of whether language poetry is elitist.<

        YES, but I'm interested in what these STEPS might be, how often we
take these steps, what's at stake in these steps, and who or what steps
along with us or against us or doesn't step at all (and who this "us" is or
isn't).

>   2. echoing Marx's definition of what property is<

Property, yes, but also technologies: one of the steps I'm thinking of is
the sense of poetry "(whether lang or no)" as a type of technology or,
perhaps more to the point, as often characterized as being dependent on
types of technologies--educations, literacies, means of access. In other
words (In Other Worlds), to what extent is the academy a privileged
technology that makes poetry-technology accessible to us, even if we
ourselves are not associated with and are not educated by such
edu-technologies? Is this the same question as Ideological State
Apparatuses? And what mechanisms for redirecting those "teaching machines"
might there be? In the belly of the beast? Both poetry and education as
means of productions? Re-appropriation?

or just:

>   3. "critics" and "academic" workers<
>   not only does the poetry circulate in the academy, some of the poets do.<
>   SHE TOO is implicated in "the teaching machine"<
>   On one level, it seems the question must be taken out of the academy.<

But can you take the academy out of the question? The way the charge is
often posed: Doesn't poetry, especially "difficult" poetry, depend on a
level of education that is somehow beyond the average worker? what worker?
SO: is this type of charge related to the charge that the production of the
machinery of communications technology depends on exploitation? And what
are the various relationships/reductions/steps involved in this kind of
argumentation?

two different questions: access, exploitation?

Subject:      Bly, the academy et al

I've noted of late a few reference to Bly and Kinnell as academic
poets. While both are very different poets to speak, it seems to me a
fundamental mistake to characterize Bly as an academic. While he began
very much as a conventional poet (you can find some rhymed stuff even
if you look in old issues of Poetry from the very early 50s or maybe
late 40s), he took a decisive step away from all that well before his
first Wesleyan book came out way back when. I forget who his teachers
were but the word Macleish runs around in the few remaining braincells
I have in that vector left. In any event, to read the Fifties and later
the Sixties, Bly was roundly attacking all things academic as well as
all things New-American-Poetic. He was precisely the alternative to the
New Am tradition available to young writers who felt outside or opposed
to the academy. There is in fact a group from that period, including
him, John Haines (an Alaskan farmer whose emerged as an active neocon I
believe in the pages of the New Criterion) and Wendell Berry (a poet
whom I like quite a bit) who all fall quite outside any taxonomy that
would just divide the world into New American vs. academic. T'ain't so
simple. Whatever one may think of Bly's work (and I think it's been
drivel for decades), his forging an audience out of the New Age scene
has been a very conscious strategy for creating a life of poetry that
did not exist quite like that before.

Kinnell on the other hand has never been far from school. He, like
Robert Hass, started his career very much as a protege of the late John
Logan, a poet who seems quite non-canonized among the literary
conservatives even as his students seem to have had just the opposite
fate. There are poems in Logan's books worth reading (as almost all of
Hass is worth reading) and I'm curious about the critical silence that
seems to have fallen over that work. There's a pretty good collection
of materials in the library in Buffalo, since he taught there for
several years after departing SF State when he "came out."

   Dear George--
   Since I find Spivack "hostile to poetry" I would still say "textualize"
   rather than "poeticize". As for whether poetry exploits, even if it's
   not "made available by" academia, I shall have to appeal to personal
   experience. If we consider our "EDUCATION" to be that which distinguishes
   us, we are either arguing strictly from "pedigree" or we place a faith
   in the powers of formal education and value what used to be called
   "intellect" over wildness. And that may have ELITIST ramifications.
   Of course, the attack on "romanticism" or Jordan's "vitalism" that in
   some parts is levied, would point to the "always already" cultural
   privilege that is "mystified" by the terms "intuition" or "wildness."
   Either, these terms REALLY MEAN "HArvard" beneath it all, or they
   exclude others. Though the second is a chicken-egg question. Who
   excludes who? And who really cares?
   The question of elitism is often figured as a question of "audience
   development" and vice versa. To the extent one is indifferent to
   these questions or engages in them as much "in game" as "in earnest",
   one may feel "outside the teaching machine" or "culture industry."
   ---assuming the second is wider than the first. There is a myth
   that I don't always mind NOT being immune to, a memory of a desire
   for some kind of wild blue yonder or personal intimacy that either
   leaps over or is found in the nooks and crannies in the culture
   industry, and this may only be learned at school BY DEFAULT.
   If I had a stake in trying to prevent people from going to college
   (like the "system" increasingly seems to have), certainly to say
   "the best thing you can learn in school is that you can't learn
    anything in school" would be in my interests. But what if I wanted
    to assert that as a DEFENSE of our "noble profession" (though I am
    still a student, I mean "in the way the world speaks")? Perhaps
    this is the ABSURDITY--like people flocking to hear Dylan sing
    "you shouldn't let other people get your kicks for you."
   But what of those who can't afford school, and thus may be deluded
   into thinking (coz of TV, perhaps? An ISA Althusser downplayed too
   much) that they CAN learn something real and substantial from school
   besides a fashionable or marketable vocabulary, just as a virgin may
   be apt to believe that sex can solve his (if not her?) problems.
   And I could appeal to my own circumstances, "story" here. The father
   who wanted me tro join him in the factory. The mother who, in defiance,
   worked herself quite literarly to death to pay for an "education" she
   never had, and for which I am still in debt (even economically) for.
   Not to claim a BOOTSTRAP mentality here, but to say the TIME she
   bought me was what gave me access to "elite" poetry more than school.
   School, even for students, is more of a job. The fact that poetry
   doesn't pay for most can be seen as liberating, though I like Brecht's
   "Song of the cut=priced poet" too. Chris

Maria,

Your post (below) reminds me of something Kit Robinson says about how
the only people who ever have any "difficulty" with his poems are
certain kinds of grad students and Eng. Dept. faculty who appear to be
reading impaired (Kit, if I'm misstating that or misplacing emphasis,
please correct me). One more instance of grad school as a learning
disorder.

I had a great experience once reading at the Maximum Security library
in Folsom and working at Hospitality House in the Tenderloin of SF for
years convinced me that this great divide between "difficult" poetry
and "nonacademic" readers was mostly imposed by the markets of what
gets distributed culturally in our society.

This does, however, bring up the one difficulty with the James quote
Aldon used. The masses in that quote, as so often, seems to stand for a
concept of people devoid of their ideological attachments, free
radicals so to speak. But to be free of that is to be free of history,
is it not? The masses in this sense is a remarkably unMarxian concept,
yet it is one that Marxists of all stripes have appealed to for
decades.

Ron

right on aldon (courtesy of clr james).  i'm getting to where i can
tell yr posts by the titles alone.  james's monition to not assume in
advance the alienation of any particular type of discourse from the
masses reminds me of one of my favorite anecdotes that i always tell my
activist-oriented students when they complain about the elitist
"difficulty" of much theory and poetry that is ideologically "on the
right side."  cesaire was asked about the "elitism" of writing in a
french, and with surrealistic techniques so sophisticated, erudite and
inventive that the simple illiterate martiniquan peasant had no chance
of understanding his verse.  au contraire, he said, they have less
difficulty than anyone in understanding it.  reminds me also
of susan schultz's piece in Chain, where she writes that the local
Hawai'ian poets had no trouble w/ C Bernstein and enjoyed his visit
there tremendously, though the well-meaning lit. faculty of U Hawai'i
expressed concern about his inaccessibility to specifically those
poets.

I haven't seen the Chain piece, but I wonder if Susan Schultz would comment.
 Especially in light of the mag she publishes, Tinfish, which contains some
work that could be spoken about in similar terms as Cesaire's, epecially the
piece by the woman whose name is too long to be conveniently typed out.

Subject:      Re: Bly, the academy et al

Ron Silliman writes that it is a mistake to characterize Robert Bly as an
academic poet, and that it is important to recognize that Bly is the
fundamental figure in forging an audience for poetry out of the New Age scene.

The truth of Ron's observations is very obvious here in Minnesota, where Bly
is the grand old poet, but where he is actually roundly criticized and
dismissed in both academic and experimental or avant-garde (or post-New
American Poetry?) circles. Still, he has the largest audience of anyone, and
while it's an audience that, unlike the others, is not primarily made up of
other poets, it's also one which has been quite activist -- in teaching, in
starting presses, and in maintaining a poetic involvement with environmental
and social causes and issues. Like Ron, I think most of what Bly has written
for a long time is just dreck, but there are things I admire about his
presence in the community, and I admire the activism and commitment of
people I might characterize as his followers, particularly Thomas R. Smith
and Paul Ferroes, although I have difficulty reading/hearing their poetry,
too. And, while I'm not at all certain where Bly stands on what I might call
more innovative lang & post-lang poetries, I have found that some of the
strongest of his followers are a lot more willing to listen to arguments for
such work than are the local academic poets.

  A massive collection of compact, entitled and engaging imagery. Long
poetic lists.

  Various small square images are identified by their 5,457 titles, a
short sample is listed below. The imagery depicts embedded cultural
(sexual-facial) expressions and is printed using a fine uniform halftone
beneath an error-diffusion bitmap.

  Each image and title is individually laser-printed on very light-weight,
letter-size, imported (Chinese straw and hemp) archival papers. These
elegant prints are very inexpensively available from the artist
<bbrace@netcom.com>; please specify which titles you'd prefer.

  Eventually these images and captions will also be incorporated into a
web-based, random-sequence, slide-show. The entire list of titles can be

why so hard and fast with these distinctions?

poetics talk/nonpoetics talk
academic/experimental, avant-garde, . . .
real language poets/wanna-bees ?

aren't the boundaries a little more fluid? Isn't that part of what's up here?

And lest I be seen as promoting some kind of trickle-down poetics (re:
educational technologies, etc.), let me say that the presuppositons of my
initial posting (Spivak's capuccino) must have been more opaque than I had
imagined, so: I presupposed that the "elitism" question had already been
settled (for many of the reasons that have since been posted) and was
wondering if the drift of the discussion on the econopolitics of the Web
Presses discussion might also be getting caught up in similar deadends?

Like all technologies and practices, I believe, we are all implicated in a
host of relations which might be "against our own interests," sedimented
with various surplus-values, and such, but still carry potential for a
variety of uses. Looking both ways at once, I guess. Which means, how do we
make sense of and use of this in-between (as I suggest above regarding the
various policings of boundaries)?

But maybe the homology carries a lot more than I had hoped for.

doesn't elitism usually mean "I don't like that, or understand that & don't

& along the lines of Maria's & Ron's recent posts, Henry Threadgill once told
me years ago that in the early days of the AACM, some of their best audiences
weren't from the established ranks of jazz lovers, but people who wandered
into concerts off the streets with no preconditioned notion of what should be

Yes, Bill, I found several. The one that I linked into my article is:
http://www.uky.edu/ArtsSciences/Classics/biblio/sappho.html, but there were
others.

This one, entitled "Diotima's Bibliography", contains quite a few scholarly
links, but I didn't find any links to poems (there may be some of Sappho's
poems in some of the Classical archives scattered about the net). When I did a
Web search on "Sappho", most of the hits were on archives from various Lesbian
mailing lists with "Sappho" in the title, but there were a number of links
relating to the poet herself.

Cheers,

        Tom.

to poetry.  To be possible , at least on my reading of this
excerpt, this seems to depend on a change of emphasis, form
"representation" to "enactment," on the level of production
and reception.  This I find a very timely and provocative idea,
since it gets to  the very base of mediation. Enactment probably
should  begin to replace representation in certain contexts,
but how can this be implemented? <

I agree wholeheartedly here.  I think this is probably what
Amittai intended as his focus is on the body.  I did have an
article on this issue in _The Journal of Poetry Therapy_
several years ago.

But you go on to say:

> This is in part a semiotic argument.  As far as I can tell
from this excerpt Amittai is arguing for rhythm, because he
believes it can evade, and therefore by extension, transcend
signification. This is probably not true.  Ray Birdwhistell's
work in kinesics ("Kinesics and Context," U of Pennsylvania
P, 1970) proved that at least for some bodily movements
there are isolatable "kinemes," signifying units of movement
and motion.  In his experiments he was able to isolate some
twenty-odd kinemes of the face and head.  A more thorough
investigation of rhythm would probably find it no less
mysterious<

I don't follow the relevance of lack of mystery.  If I
recall correctly Birdwhistle also did similar work on bird's
songs and there is a lot of research on components of facial
expressions of emotion in humans.  Both song and emotional
expression are sublime to my way of thinking.  And both of
these are also enactments of the unconscious, the spiritual,
or the body (there is, by the way, an extensive body of
theroretical and research literature on kinesthetic
psychology - _not_ psychoanalytically based).

On another issue you raise above:  On my reading, Amittai
is saying that rhythm attempts to "evade and...transcend
signification" even though that attempt is doomed to
failure.

Subject:      rhythm, again

Considering Tom Bell's recent remarks, let me elaborate a little on my posting
of January 8th on rhythm.

One of the things I said was, "Discounting the transcendent quality of Amittai's
argument, I would tend to agree that more kinesthetic or kinemic approaches to
literature would be useful.  The distinction between a linguistic (language by
itself) and a paralinguistic (meaningful activity coincident with language)
analysis should probably not be maintained.  The difficulty of this approach is
that it demands an almost complete reevaluation of spatial and temporal
models...."

I offered the Birdwhistell material to illustrate what I think is a common
misperception in some discussions of movement and rhythm, namely, that movement
is somehow unmediated or uncoded and is expressed and perceived more directly
than language.  This I understand to be a result of splitting language off from
other paralinguistic phenomena (things like rhythm, gesture, intonation etc.)
coincident to it.  As I mentioned before I think we do this to our detriment.

I said "A more thorough investigation of rhythm would find it no less
mysterious," because the work of Birdwhistell and others in paralinguistics was
in large part able to demystify quite a lot of territory that was previously
mysterious.

One of the classic examples in Zoosemiotics, the branch of animal semiotics that
Thomas Sebeok pioneered, explained how the horse Clever Hans could add and
subtract numbers given to him by his trainer.  What Sebeok found was that Clever
Hans was clever, but not in the way some people had thought; he was responding
to various signs given unconsciously by the trainer and since the trainer knew
the answer to what was asked Clever Hans was only reading the gestural "answer"
code of the trainer that he had been trained to read.  Up until that point
Clever Hans' mathematical ability was a mystery.

We may need to retain transcendence and mystery somewhere for that which we
can't explain, but as I said before, I think this mystery as it exists for
rhythm and poetry is a result of splitting language off from a much larger and
richer expressive sphere in the first place.

60 Cops, 150 Students Clash in Leimert Park

In a troubling incident last Thursday, police clashed with students who
were attending a weekly urban poetry workshop.  Over 60 policement in
riot gear converged on a crowd of about 150 workshop participants and
closed it down.  According to several eyewitnesses, when the crowd was
slow to disperse and began to verbally protest, the officers reponded by
prodding the crowd with batons.  Professor Ben Caldwell, who teaches a
class called Urban Art and Music at prestigious California Arts Institute
said, "The workshop is an extension of my Cal Arts class."


_____
How did ch. 2 News headline this story?
"Illegal Nightclub Closed by Police"

What did we not learn from the television coverage?
That it was a poetry workshop; that Prof. Caldwell convened it; That one
student was sent to the hospital after a police club opened a gash in her
head.

What did the television reporters make sure we larned?
The young people were black.

Now, I don't know if they drew a bigger crowd than Ezra Pound, but Sun Ra

Dear poets and critics:

My name is Akitoshi Nagahata.  I'm teaching English as a second language

member of this list for about a year, but this is my first post and it's an
inquiry.  A friend of mine who is translating Paul Auster's interview into
Japanese (who also translated John Ashbery's poems) asked me about a poet
Mark Irwin, who, according to the friend, published a book called _Against
Meanwhile_.  It seems he is mentioned in the interview by Auster or the
interviewer.  I have no idea who he is and so decided to send an inquiry to
this list.  Any information about him is welcome.

I think what Ward Tietz was arguing was specifically not to make this
separation, that "affect" is full of "information," and "information" is
full of "affect," and that we get in trouble if we separate them so. At
least I think that was what he was saying, and I agree.

And just to complicate things a little further, how much affect is really
communicated and how much is actually _created_ at the site of the work's
reception (reader/audience)?  And is the "information" that's communicated
left unchanged by its journey to that site?

Aldon:

I appreciate your point here. But my question was serious. Elite is
one of those words that gets deployed so easily, but constantly seems
to mean something else. Here you're using it in a context where it's
got something to do with access to political power. In the previous
usage it seemed to refer to the kinds of audience specific forms of
artistic work were addressed to. Which then raises all kinds of
troubling questions--for me anyway.

I don't think I've ever had a stronger sense of elitism at work than
sitting in one of those rooms at the MLA. Which wasn't a problem for
me. If someone wants to spend 50 grand learning to write in ways and
about issues that interest 15 (or 50) other people on the continent, I
say, go for it. Think about Cary Nelson lovingly collecting 90 year
old scrap books of dead labour organizers for the aura that lingers
about them. Not exactly a populist past time, but it clearly gives him
such exquisite pleasures, who's going to tell him to stop because it's
elitist?

I hope this isn't a dead thread on this list.

I just bought _Postmodern American Poetry: the Norton Anthology_. edited by
Paul Hoover. I noted with pleasure that some of the present company were
included as well as mentioned in the Acknowledgements. Unfortunately, the
book is also very disturbing.

Why is Ashbery given this place at the lead of language poetry? *Self-
portrait* is a fine book, but it's just one of many. He happened to be
published by Penguin and that meant exposure.

What about *A-22 & 23* by Louis Zukofsky? Why isn't he even in there? What
about Grossinger and Charles Stein and the whole North Atlantic thing? What
about the Jargon Society?

The Montemora people are there and the Sulphur crowd.

What about the Canadians and the Brits? Is this to be a separate anthology?
I mean Christopher Dewdney and Jed Rasula and Thomas A. Clark and Tom Raworth
just to name a few whose work belongs in this book except by geography.

What about John Taggart? My lord! This could be one of the most glaring
ommissions. The way he plays with sound is so fascinating.

Many more of my favorites were not in there, like Don Byrd, Nathaniel Tarn,
Theodore Enslin, James Sherry ... I've barely begun.

I think it was too soon for this. I'm glad many new people will be exposed to
the people who *are* in there. (Many of you are here, Rae, Ron, Charles, etc.)
But when it comes time to do a proper anthology, I nominate Clayton Eshelman
to edit it.

i don't think one can constructively interrogate the term "elitist" w/o a
corresponding interrogation of context and relationship... and i do mean to
say *interrogate*...

"elitist" generally suggests a power differential, yes?... there's a
certain irony in suggesting that nelson's 'working class' orientation is
elitist (you meant it this way, right mike?)... if elitist is taken to mean
something like promoting a powerful minority (as in majority-minority)
position *to the exclusion of other positions* i'd say there are problems
with it... that is, elitists are presumably those with power, vis-a-vis the
folks who designate the opposition as such... as a pejorative the word
suggests a small group in a hierarchical relation with a larger group as a
result of insidious practices...

whereas the capacity for advocating that a given minority view may be
superior to other such views is a desirable feature of public discourse...

but generally elitism is, uh, deployed by those who decry it as an
accusation, to denote a certain arrogance, not to say inequitable power
relation... i mean, just because a group or person is eccentric, or because
a group or person occupies a minority position as such, is rarely occasion
for such an accusation...

i hasten to add that power is a function of context, which is why elitist
as a tag is so, well, fraught... i mean, i once heard a lit. theorist argue
to the effect that there's nothing wrong with being elitist, because in
fact all this means is that lit. theory is arcane... and more populist
abuses of the term are probably easy to demonstrate...

still, arcana and elitism are not the same words, and don't as i see it
turn on the same public axes...

for me the question is whether elitism is a useful term these days, given
what we know of the political climate of reception... in aesthetic terms,
and in the midst of a conservative backlash of sorts, one might expect to
be accused of elitism becasuse one is "inaccessible"... on the other hand,
belief in a "power elite" (i'm not talking typewriters) is a frequent
construction of certain left political discourse per se...

i think we have in this country a system which promotes an establishment
power elite... and i think that a certain level of aesthetic
inaccessibility is desirable...

hence i guess i am and i am not an elitist, depending on who you are... but
i don't aspire to elitist status, uh-uh...

Peter,

Doing an anthology is simply an impossible task. I speak from
experience. Whenever I read one, such as Jerry & Pierre's of late, I
spend so much of my time thinking about the texts they should have
included, the way I would have organized it better, etc., etc., etc.

In some sense, that may be one of the real pleasures of READING an
anthology, but it is an EXCRUCIATING aspect of editing one.

The Hoover anthology (which Golding in his essay on anthologies in From
Outlaw to Classic -- a brilliant book everyone should read --, notes is
the only Norton to use the indefinite article "A Norton Anthology")
certainly has its weaknesses and blind spots, even for the poets it
includes. Getting the title of Zukofsky's long poem wrong is sort of
typical. Including 28 NY School poets but not Ted Greenwald is another.
I could go on (and your suggestions are all good ones). But I have no
doubts about Paul's intentions and good will that went into the
project.

What about the case of someone like Ted Pearson, whom I left out of In
the American Tree from a sense that (like Scalapino or Dahlen, say) I
felt his work was more a conscious critical take on the scene than
implicated within it. He's not in the Ganick/Barone, nor either the
Hoover or Messerli, nor even the New Coast. Yet he's clearly one of the
significant poets of his (my) generation.

Just as the Paris Leary/Robert Kelly anthology, A Controversy of Poets,
first exposed me many moons ago to the likes of Rochelle Owens, Jackson
Mac Low, Gerrit Lansing and Kelly himself (none of whom were in the
Allen), the Hoover will no doubt have an eye-opening impact for some
folks. And that's what it's all about, no?

All best,

By the way, elitism is not an accident of censorship or poor distribution:
that few might have read certain of Langston Hughes' revolutionary poems,
for instance, doesn't mean that he was being an elitist.  Elitism is
an ethos and an affiliation, not a matter of failure to get or stimulate
literal or literary "action."  This does not address questions of whether
one is doing effective political work (in this day and age???) by recalling
texts that speak to positive (in this day and age???) social change.

The problem I have here, Maria, is you seem to assume a dynamics of
power based on it all being one place, and not elsewhere, which
ignores everything Foucault taught us about the circulation of power
through social orders. You may not feel you have power over others,
but perhaps you're in denial, as they say. What about in the class
room? What about within various professional organizations? Personal
relationships? You may use your power responsibly, but that doesn't
mean you don't have it.

Time for a blurb.

The information/rhythm problematic is well explored in a book I've
recently read and would recommend:

TELLING RHYTHM: BODY AND MEANING IN POETRY, by Amittai Aviram
(U of Michigan P, 1994).

It has some weaknesses: For example, in the few comments it makes about
language poetry, I think it drastically misunderstands the work.  But as a
recovery of a somatic understanding of poetry descending from Nietzsche, I
think it does a remarkably clear and interesting job.

Cheers,
David

Along these lines, I like Pierre Bourdieu's formulation of the "class
fraction," in particular his characterization of the cultural/artistic
community as "the dominated fraction of the dominant class."

Subject:      elitism

I've noticed that for accusations of elitism to be levelled against a poet,
there are two prerequisites:

1) that the poetry is seen to be inaccessible; and

2) that the poet is seen to have easy or subsidised access to the means of
publication.

So, 'obscure' or 'experimental' poets are not seen as 'elitist' by these
accusers if they self-publish via photocopier and are rarely given pride of
place in mainstream literary mags: they are merely harmless eccentrics. But if
the same writer receives grants of public money, is published by university
presses and dominates the journals, then he or she is deemed 'elitist'.

It is interesting to note that the accusers usually fulfill neither of the
above criteria: they write accessible poetry that no-one wants to publish.


        Tom Beard.

Maria:

Well, I don't know. It seems to rely on the same dynamic in that it
defines power as something other than what we (each of us, even those
without privilege) experience in our lives (from both sides) by making
it solely the provenance of "them". Admittedly, "they" may have more
of it on a more regular basis, but who's so innocent as not to know
its taste?

(I've now forgotten how this relates to writing and elitism. O well.)

This may or may not be of interest re "privilege."  It's from a manuscript
essay a friend, Charles Spinosa, put me onto some time ago.  The author is
Naomi Scheman, a Stanley Cavell student I think:

Privilege and marginality are central concepts in recent feminist and other
liberatory theorizing, in which they are generally taken to be opposed to each
other:  privilege resides at the center of whatever system is being analyzed,
and marginality is the condition of being removed from that center, having an
identity peripheral to the structures of privilege, being "different."  But
there are certain social locations that are at once privileged and marginal,
complex amalgams that are of particular relevance for an understanding of the
nature of philosophy and of theorizing.
     In particular, in societies such as ours, the position of the academic,
and of the philosopher within the academy, are positions of privileged
marginality.... The privilege and the marginality are not just two features
of this social location; they are inextricably bound together. . . .
     Privileged marginality is a location from which the felt need for the
generic standpoint is peculiarly both poignant and problematic, a combination
present throughout Wittgenstein's writings and enacted especially in the
interchanges with the interlocuter in the _Investigations_ and other later
work. . . .
      It is, however, only the explicit politicizing of that location, along
with the explicit politicizing of epistemology generally, that can take us
beyond the diagnosis of the pull toward the generic--the pull, that is, away
from diversity--to a clearer sense of how more responsibly to live in the
forms of life we--variously--inhabit.  Such a perspective provides a gloss
on Wittgenstein's remark that "Not empiricism and yet realism in philosophy,
that is the hardest thing."  (RFM, VI, 23)  Empiricism is an epistemology of
parsimony:  the problem for knowledge is taken to be the problem of
partiality in the sense of bias:  what we need is to strip away the influence
of everything that might lead to doxastic idiosyncrasy.  The hallmark of
reality, however, is that it looks different to those differntly placed in
it; consequently realism requires an epistemology of largesse:  the problem
for knowledge isthe problem of partiality not in the sense of bias but in the
sense of incompleteness.

Hope that gives all of you pondering elites, power and privilege something to
chew on.  Seems pretty straightforward, my big cuts and all.  But I'm no
philosopher.

Naomi Scheman's essays (many of them at any rate) are collected in her
ENGENDERINGS: CONSTRUCTIONS OF KNOWLEDGE, PRIVILEGE AND AUTHORITY (I may
not have got this perfectly right), out in the Thinking Gender series
from Routledge c.93/94. I believe the quoted passage is included there.

Naomi has been attracting some attention lately as an important "Full
Professor"-generation feminist theorist (of which there are all too few),
and having worked with her essays (and her personally, to a lesser
extent) in the past, she strikes me as one of the most important voices
in philosophy today.

Regarding Wittgenstein, I believe a volume edited by Naomi Scheman is
forthcoming in the Penn State UP series, to be called FEMINIST
INTERPRETATIONS OF WITTGENSTEIN. At this point I suspect its pub. date is
more likely 1997 than 1996. I have high expectations for it.

Well, I was thinking of when I worked in a metal stamping plant near
Aldon in Santa Clara. On the production floor it was mostly me and a dozen
chicano guys running 10 high speed punch presses. (Talk about
"silenced". My ears are still ringing 15 years later). I don't quite
see how "marginal" decribes their position (or mine then). Marginal to
what? Maybe we weren't marginal. Maybe we were. Interestingly,
although we all were aligned in varying degrees against the power of
the front office, the power relations between those guys (they
basically came from three families) and within their families were
every bit as intense and structured as those between us and
management. Negotiating that was a trip.

They did read my poems from time to time, and though they didn't
"understand" them (I think they were elitist poems), they thought it
was wild somebody would write stuff like that. I don't think, however,
at that point I'd yet crafted a poem as astonishing and smooth-running
as Carlos' '52 Chev lowrider. Ever since, I've been trying to figure
out how to get hydraulics into a poem.

Subject:      Re: Subject line that will disappoint Maria

been chewing over this power/privilege couple that maria intro'd, with
subsequent glosses by mike, keith, tom, david, et. al... i think the
distinction has proved itself useful by calling attention to a hybrid
subject position that some of us evidently feel we sometimes-often occupy
(me too)... i mean, such a position is, as maria puts it, "delicious" to
the extent that one *can* understand this conjunction as operating at
certain thresholds... of habit taste motivation etc... herewith a bit of
speculation:

what i'm having trouble with is the way i tend ordinarily to think and
speak of privilege... i mean, privileges are earned from one pov and
accorded from another... and as a well-heeled anguish prof., perhaps i'd be
remiss not to point to the word's etymology (from latin, approx. 'belonging
to the individual,' 'solitary,' as opposed to 'belonging to the
collective,' or state) and ask whether in fact it's a privilege to be so
privileged as to be working with etymologies in the first place?... i mean,
how did i come to *know* things this way, why am i entitled so, so
entitled?...

to argue that, for politics (and as i (sorta) understand scheman), the
problem of knowledge should be less its partiality than its impartial
incompleteness---realism as preferable to radical empiricism, i guess---is
to say, really, that politics should be predicated on knowing how to make
space for other ways of knowing (largesse) and not merely a matter of
cogitating over the limitations of each way... but this is to formulate
things in terms of  *knowledge*... that is, politics in this formulation
seems to me to be subordinated to epistemology...

but speaking more as a poet (and isn't this hat-game convenient?), what
often concerns me is less the inadequacy of a given epistemology than the
inadequacy of epistemology, period... i don't mean to say that epistemology
isn't pertinent, but i do mean to say that it isn't always the best account
of what i'm doing, the best category for theorizing my activity...

it seems to me that it's precisely when i stop obsessing over how i know
what i know---which obsession represents an elision of the corresponding
*entitlement* (to know etc.)---that privilege becomes a matter of

that my material means, i mean, become legible---less as 'forms of life' (i

un-knowing mind, more as independently existing entities... people
too---what's often important is not how i "know" them, necessarily, not
even the "know-how" it takes to treat others with due respect for their
knowledges... what's often important is understanding what it is we each
*feel* entitled to, and why, how we developed that sense of entitlement or
privilege independently of knowledge as such---as a function of social
experience, or anthropological habit, or emotional trauma... one can reduce
all of this to 'ways of knowing' or some such, but for me this does in fact
constitute a reduction...

to whatever extent i may be empowered, if what i feel privileged/entitled
to know (etc.) is always a matter of relation (with others), how i come to
understand, or mebbe respond to, what i feel i deserve or don't is not

got as much to do with the completeness of that which i don't know... that
is, i am at once apprehensive and intact in my lack of knowledge...

i hope my residual murkiness is not too murky... but i just don't always

I like very much joe's "murky" mini-essay, but I see too that in excerpting
the scheman essay ("Forms of Life:  Mapping the Rough Ground") for use in the
exchanges on power/privilege I have left it vulnerable to mis-reading.  What
she is precisely NOT about is "subordinating politics to epistemology." She
is trying to get Wittgenstein out from under a reading by one J. C. Nyiri.
Two more excerpts:

One important thing Wittgenstein can seem to be denying us is, precisely,
ground to stand on, if among our concerns is the possibility of casting a
critical eye on the world we inhabit.  When he writes that "what has to be
accepted, the given is--so one could say--_forms of life_"(PI p226), what--so
one could ask--is the force of this "has to"?  If, as Wittgenstein wants to
lead us to see, it is only against a background of shared practices and shared
judgments that doubt can be intelligible, (how) can we register, let alone
argue for, disapprobation of a form of life, whether it be one in which we
are enmeshed (making our attempted critique self-refuting) or one to which
we are alien (making our critique, referentially, off the mark)?

It has been argued, most pointedly by J. C. Nyiri, that Wittgenstein provides
a way of responding to these puzzles, not by providing such critical ground,
but by persuading us to do without it.  On this reading Witgenstein is at
once theoretically pluralist and practically conservative.

Against Nyiri (and on behalf of W) Scheman introduces her discussion of
diasporic identity--really the subject of her essay.  I don't want to get into
that as it's late and i'm already too far astray from the ongoing question, but
perhaps one more excerpt will do more justice to scheman's position:

But there's no no need to take Wittgenstein in this way [as nyiri and others
take him]--it could just as well be that what stops, what is given peace, is,
 specifically, philosophizing, not because quiet takes its place, but because
what has seemed a philosophical problem becomes something else.  [That is, a
political problem.]

And so on and so on.  Probably scheman would have no problem with joe's
"ordinary" use of "privilege" (and the reubens at Morry's on 55th--they're
still mediocre, joe?)  I introduced the earlier quote to break up the power-
privilege monad.  And, as long as we're mucking about in philosophy, and
pondering poetry and "elites," there's this from Cavell in an interview:

But what's an American writer?  An American writer is somebody who either can
make a living at writing--an important fact--or who is a poet.  For poets, a
community exists.  They write for one another and they know it. [He's envious?]

Is it disturbing that "community" is here in the singular?  Should it be?
Would it still make sense to speak of "elites" if cavell is right, or if it
were somehow worthwhile making him right by speaking of a need to forge
community within a real acknowledgement of (scheman's) incompleteness and
already existing multiple practices and povs?  Just asking. . . .

Anyway, hope this clarifies the scheman essay a little.

Subject:      poetry, publishers & promotion

It is my understanding that Angus & Robertson (A&R where a major publisher
of Australian poetry and literature for many years but have been taken over
by Harper Collins) are getting poets to sign a contract which includes a
clause in which A&R states that it intends to undertake no publicity or
promotion of the completed poetry title. This seems to me to be a little
self defeating and contradictory. A&R's argument may well be that poetry
publishing has a very limited audience and that the only people who buy the
book will probably know the author anyway and that advertising will not
result in any significant increased sales. On the other hand by not
advertising or promoting the book they are probably loosing what small
readership they already have. (I understand that A&R's lack of promotion
extends to not organising launches - and from my experience launching a
poetry book is probably the best way to sell lots of copies fast!).

I was wondering if any one else knows of any other publishers who adopt a
similiar attitude to their poets.

Yes, I think that many of my favorite writers are better off *with* that
anthology than without it. Many new readers will find the kinship that I
found when I went to a lecture by Don Byrd on Louis Zukofsky some years
ago. There is more good than bad, in my mind, about the whole thing. I
hope it didn't sound like I thought there was any malice in the editor.

However, the heat of the kitchen is also necessary. There will be revisions.
And I'll repeat Taggart's name over and over if it will help get him in.
And I have to question the national boundary. Those boundaries don't really
pertain to poetry after the 70's.

If I put an anthology together (I don't really know enough to do so), I expect
some people would have similar reactions. For instance, I would have left out
the Beats. I think a lot of people would take exception to that.

BTW, long live Kelly! I'm reading *a STRANGE market* this week. <g>

Subject:      Susan Schultz, Charles Bernstein, and Hawaii

Ron Silliman mentions Susan Schultz' excellent piece on the reception
that Charles Bernstein received in Hawaii. Charles seems to have gotten
along
quite well in some ways with the local poets there, who understood how
his concept of the ideolect related to their interest in the dialect. The
resistance to Bernstein was all from the English department, who (of
course) had no interest in local writers but were determined to tell
Bernstein that he was "elitist" and couldn't possibly have anything to do
with local poets, thus proving what being "local" means in an administrative
frame-- a determination to keep "outside agitators" (as southern
sheriffs used to say in the sixties) from giving any ideas to the people
we oppress.

Susan's piece explains this much more thoroughly than I can. One note,
though--the essay appeared in A Poetics of Criticism, a collection of
essays, which is completely different than the excellent mixed-genre
magazine Chain.

With all the talk about privilege under this subject heading, it may seem
hard to imagine that the original post had to do with the Los Angeles Police
Department taking an overactive interest in a poetry gathering, and how the
local media sensationalized the story. I'm always up for a little irony...

Subject:      Re: Subject line that will disappoint Maria

This is a little bit at tangents with the recent discussion, especially since
Gale Nelson reminded us of what started it all, but one of the things I've found
interesting about the postings on elitism / epistemology etc. has been the
patterning of descriptors that have been used in the discussion.  The pattern by
itself seems to me to suggest a somewhat different problem.  I wonder if
concerns about epistemology and the conflicting or multiple aspects of privilege
and marginality shouldn't perhaps be directed at the apparatus of description,
since it seems to me the problem is more a matter of how an epistemology or idea
occurs or renders itself usable than of any inherent limitation of the
epistemology or idea itself.  This is, of course, an almost untestable idea;
description can't be avoided or overhauled completely, but I wonder if it could
be developed.

I remember a very useful piece by Walter Ong, actually a chapter in "Interfaces
of the Word," on how description and knowledge interact, and according to him
and others, both unavoidably depend on tropes; description can only frame out an
epistemology by way of certain tropes that appeal to a sensory base and their
multivalences in language.  This is not a very new or unique idea, but his
illustration is useful.  What he found specifically was that the various
sub-tropes of vision: clarity, brilliance, dullness, transparency, opacity,
depth, distance, reflection, point of view etc., enforce a very strict regime,
almost to the point of defining intellection.  A lot of recent writing in
philosophy, of course, has been wrestling with this problem, as I think
Scheman's is, and has worked against some of these points directly.  Deleuze and
Guattari also come to mind, but even somewhat more traditional philosophers like
Donald Davidson have tried to rework ideas of multiple points of view into
descriptions of action.

But the problems of description continue, it seems to me, not least because this
base of intellection and reflection enforces itself on other structures as well.
One of the reasons we often resort to a center / periphery scheme to describe
social phenomena, as Scheman describes, is that it renders static that which is
dynamic, or so we believe, but description probably sets up these distinctions
in the first place.  Description seems to demand this transformation since
without it the world couldn't conform to the descriptive apparatus we already
have.  Scheman's argument almost overcomes this; she tries to activate her
description, but it still seems obliged to resolve contradicting and multiple
"placements" by placing them in a different way.

Dynamic things are difficult to describe, but why?; is it only because
description has us believe that they are?  As Joe Amato said in his posting,
"it's often got as much to do with the completeness of that which I don't know."
Description will always refuse to speak the language of dynamism and it will
always demand a translation.  Ironically to "reflect" on such a thing only props
it all back up again.

But what can we do?  Description gives us a richness of meaning and process we
believe we need.  Giving up description for demonstration is one way out, but we
are not very developed in our understanding of what is required.  If we could
make progress with demonstration maybe doing without a described "position"
would become tolerable.

Mark--thanks for picking up where I stumbled!  My only addition to what
you've written is to say that the local poets didn't have anything to say
about the idiolect/pidgin question that aroused so much hostility from
the non-local poets.  I think there is a real question here: pidgin is
mainly a "lower class" (I hate this term) language, while idiolects do
tend to be invented by elites.  That is not to say that the comparison
isn't wonderfully provocative and in some ways apt.  The other question
that was raised (with raised voices) had to do with "intelligibility";
should writers clearly communicate (if there is such a thing) or should
they refuse to buy into prefab linguistic constructions?  Again, a
question well worth discussing.  The problem was the out of breathness of
the argument more than its terms.

While I'm here, a couple of reading recommendations: the new Kaya
Production anthology of Asian-American literature provides a fine
antidote to the Garrett Hongo anthology, to say nothing of the Heath and
the Norton (not Hoover) folks.  Wonderful experimental writing and good
contributions from Hawai'i, including work by Barry Masuda, R. Zamorra
(Zack) Linmark, and Lois-Ann Yamanaka, whose new novel from FS&G is just
out (I'm upset to see her book of poetry referred to in her bio blurb as
"an award winning collection of short stories," for some reason).
Linmark also has a new (and experimental) novel out from Kaya Production,
which I recommend.

Subject:      elitism

I think there is another way see the charges of elitism as not
necessarily reactionary or ignorant or paranoid (tho perhaps the majority
of accusations are).  That is thru the dichotomy of elitism vs.
utilitarianism as a socialist modernist bug.  A work or school is elite
when it defines itself by whom it excludes as well as valorizing its own
ability to remain powerful while self-nominated as marginal.  Elitism
is an index of access ability, and I think many of the language poets
have consistently and strongly addressed their work within the public
sphere, incorporating the audience and/as reader into the dialogue.
(Watten addresses many of these issues in the Ariel 8 issue: "We question
a question in order to fill in its form.")

 It's the lack of dialogue, or willful neglect of certain audiences.
It is best to address all critics whether
underinformed (the "average reader" or worker who needs a immediately
useful, practical item) or overinformed (say Jameson).  Also one must
keep up with the "speed" of today's reader who glances only at the
morning paper or book per month before business, as well as keep up with
the "speed" of other reading habits (reading on a bus is different than
reading in a library).  Anyways, for the utilitarian poetry perhaps does
"sell" something: a difficult and hopefully pleasureable ride thru a sort
of self-enriching alienation (not teleologically determined) indicative
of a multidirectional will.  If elitism purposefully restricts its public
by a conscious neglect, then in turn the public will neglect them.  In
that sense, elitism is always an anachronism.

Subject:      Int'l Workshop in Literature/Perf Arts-- Venice

Greetings.  By a thread of circumstances too lengthy to recount here, I am
helping to organize an international workshop on literature and performance
art at a urban architecture institute in Venice.  Date:  May 1 through June
4, 1996.  The faculty at this point include:  Charles Bernstein, Fiona
Templeton, Tom Raworth, Julie Patton, Lee Anne Brown and myself.  This is the
first year for such a workshop, and we (Julie, Lee Anne and me) hope to turn
into an annual gathering, perhaps connecting it next year to the Biennale.
 For the first year, however, we need at least 15 workshop participants.  The
fee is $2,300.  This pays for participant lodging in Venice in very nice
apartments, and a month long studio intensive in performance with Fiona, as
well as  week long workshops with above named poets.

If you, or someone you know is interested please get in touch by e-mail to my
address:  Ericalin @ aol.com.  I would like to get a read of how many people
might consider attending.  I 'd be happy to supply more information.
 Materials regarding the workshop itself are in production.  Thank you.

Susan--

        While I understand what you're saying about "pidgin," I think I'm
going to have to question your statement that "ideolect is invented by
elites." Elites in what sense? Educationally maybe, but certainly not
financially--so I think it's too easy to use the word "elites". I know
quite a few people who use ideolects who work as secretaries, in book
stores, in lower level meaningless office jobs, as underpaid part-time
community college teachers. The idea that such people are "elites" seems
about as clear as the idea that Barry Switzer (uneducated coach of the
Dallas Cowboys, author of the autobiography Bootlegger's Son) is part of
the underclass because he never went to college. So I think, in this
instance, the division between "elites" and the culturally oppressed is
much more complicated than you're making clear.

        Maria: Sorry to have mistaken you for Ron Silliman. With the huge
mass of e-mail info, I have to admit that I don't read every post as
carefully as I might. Ron's post was the first one I saw that mentioned
Susan's essay.

Mark--I only meant to distinguish between pidgin, which was developed as
a language to be used between plantation workers from Japan, China, the
Philippines, and elsewhere and their bosses, relatively well-to-do
whites, in their business dealings with one another.  As a result of this
economic hierarchy, pidgin tends to get marked as a "lower class"
language opposed to the "high class" standard English still used in
business and education.  Lots of class resentments get played out in
discussion of the new Hawai'i literature in pidgin (of the last 15-20
years, that is), and in that literature.  I could be wrong, but it
doesn't seem to me that the writers of ideolects use them in quite the
way pidgin is in Hawai'i--but the use of the word "elite" is perhaps
unfair, at least if "elite" is used in a pejorative manner.  Perhaps it
would be best to talk a bit about what the purposes behind the
development of ideolects.  What are the points of contact between them
and pidgins, whether in Hawai'i, the Caribbean, or anywhere else they're
spoken?

When I was visiting my American friend in his Paris sublet in 19 what 78, I
happened on an old French one-volume poorman's Britannica--a lil
encyclopedia.  There  was one of those lovely 10-20 page sections, in
multi-color plates, with repeated maps of the world carved up in various
ways (like Elizabeth Bishop liked): nations of the world, empires of the
world, currencies of the world, & so on.  And languages of the world: a
little English on the map here, French German there; and then spread across
90% of the surface area, just one word, repeated as graphics dictated: "pidgin."

another thing that struck me and I sure won't try all four languages since I
can't even spell in English, but: on the SNFC, there's a quadrilingual sign
in all the cars--French, English, German, Italian (they don't even bother w
Spanish).  The first three say, each in its own lingua franca, "it's
forbidden to stick your head out of the window while the train is moving."
The Italian version, instead, says it's "dangerous" to do it.

Subject:      Boontling

The pidgin-ideolect-language discussion reminds me of the Northern
California lingo (I think that's the proper term) called Boontling. It
was created in the 1890s in the Anderson valley towns of Booneville,
Anderson and Philo (not far from where Lydia Davis' half-brother
Alexander Cockburn lives) by teenagers who basically wanted a "safe"
means of talking dirty in the presence of their elders. But since they
all grew up together and, except for those who ended up going off to
WWI, stayed pretty much insular in that valley as adults, they let the
lingo become the dominant language for their generation. Some of the
very youngest ones to pick it up still show up at folk festivals in
California, just telling (or as they would say "harping") stories.
Radio and TV finally killed it off, their kids were more worldly and
embarrassed at calling a pay phone a bucky walter, but if you go
through Booneville (and there's an excellent rare bookstore there that
specializes in 20th C. poetry), you will see that the pay phone is
indeed labeled Bucky Walter. There's at least one book (a PhD
dissertation) in print on it, by Charles Adams.

NEW THIS VERY DAY FROM TALISMAN: PRIMARY TROUBLE: AN ANTHOLOGY OF
CONTEMPORARY AMERICAN POETRY, ed. Leonard Schwartz, Joseph Donahue,
and Edward Foster. The most ambitious effort of its sort to day,
Primary Trouble anthologizes the work of more than sixty poets
representing those who have had a crucial impact in the last thirty or
forty years. The work included here represents not only well
acknowledged groups and practices such as the New York School,
language writing, and multicultural traditions but also gnostic
and hermetic work that is increasingly identified among the most
interesting being published today. There was a publication reading
for the book in Miami last week and a huge gathering at Intersection
for the Arts in San Francisco this past Tuesday. There will be a
publication reading at Biblio's in New York on February 25th, and
similar readings will follow in other cities in the coming months.
The book is available in fine bookstores and maybe ordered through
SPD and Login Publishers Consortium/InBook (Visa/MasterCard). The
book, with 478 + xx pages, is $24.95, and the ISBN is 1-883689-29-5.

And then there was Spicer's Martian dialect.

A quote from John Ryan:

Jack Spicer and I were both fluent in Martian.  I was North Martian, and he
was South Martian, but we understood what we said perfectly well.  We were
going down into the Valley one year, before Christmas, on a train, and Jack
had to go take a leak.  Jack and I had been conversing in Martian, being
quite full of Red Cap Ale, and a guy from another table came over and asked
me when Jack went to the head, "Are you fellows Australian?"  Jack returned
and greeted the man, "Sit ka vassisi von ka, sta'chi que v'ay qray."
("Salut!".)  That's Southern Martian.  "Eiss!  Sa schlein!  Ja da lond, nar
la loff."  (That's "thank you," in Northern Martian.)"

(from KK's Spicer bio--I am devouring the manuscript with great pleasure)

about it, the _L.A. Times_ ran a story on the impending death of this
lingo, along with interviews with colorful oldsters who still speak it

Ron,

I have spent the morning bugging Kevin about what he sees as the difference
between Martians and ghosts.  KK seems to think that they are, in fact,
metaphors for the same phenomenon--which particular term Spicer chose often
depending on who he was talking to.  KK said that Martians seemed to drop
away after a while, and ghosts took over as the predominant image.  KK
doesn't see much connection between the Martian dialect and this, seeing
speaking Martian simply as a game that lovers play.

Have you ever made up a language with another, Ron?  I have.

And, yes, I do feel lucky reading this book.  But I also feel lucky about
my long-term, totally passive exposure to Spicer's work and world, which
began long before KK started the Spicer bio.  Early on in my writing career
Bruce Boone would read me Spicer and discuss his poetry and Bruce's vision
of community.  I remember Bruce having a party where a large group of us
sat around his Noe Valley apartment and listened to a tape of Spicer
reading _The Holy Grail_.  And then there was the Spicer conference at New
College.  And John Granger's striking talk on Spicer at Small Press
Traffic.

And I've been particularly lucky in having met many of the people discussed
in the Spicer bio.  There's something very gratifying about having myself
developed as a writer in San Francisco, and being emersed in this
historical community which still has traces in the present.  Recently KK,
Peter Gizzi, and I went to the memorial service of the painter Tom Field,
who was part of the Spicer circle.  As I was leaving, Joanne Kyger and a
number of other survivors of that era took what remained of the wine and
headed up to Tom's room to drink because they could feel Tom there.
Ghosts.

like kevin via dodie, i'm not sure how much is gained by looking for
differences btw ghosts and martians in spicer.  in my spicer chapter i treat
them as slightly different inflections of spicer's felt affinity for
otherworldliness(es) in his life: as a poet, as a gay man, etc.  I'd say that
there is in ghosts a resonance w/ keats's negative capability and eliot's
anti-personality aesthetics ("what i am is by degrees a ghost"--letter to
lorca in After Lorca), and in martians there's a sense (through appeal to
cavalcantian appeals to mars as the "real" god of love as opposed to venus)
of bellicose agonism, which certainly characterizes spicer's relationship to
"the world" --and also, given the space-race fifties and sixties, to the
concept of a fantasy/utopian projection where things could come true and
whence "different" people came (somewhere over the rainbow, burroughs's
"language is a virus from outer space," sun ra, etc, "my favorite martian" as
a mass cultural model for alternate masculinity). etc.  i had some ideas
about 8 years ago of writing something about the iconography of the
space-race and the emergent gay male community of the 50s and 60s, but like
so many other ideas i never did it, nor could i persuade any of my grad
students to pursue it.  auden has a poem abt the space race, doesn't he?

Yes, Spacey would be ideal for the "Frank O'Hara" story.  But don't get me
started.  In half an hour I had the entire movie cast: I see Chris
O'Donnell as Joe LeSueur, and Bill Pullman as the young John Ashbery.  For
Jane, who else but Jennifer Jason Leigh!  Or maybe she would be better as V
R ("Bunny") Lang, and Winona Ryder could play Jane.  Stephen Dorff could
play the seductive heartless Bill Berkson that Gooch has imagined into
being.  If "they" could teach Brad Pitt to dance, he would be great as
Vincent Warren.  The frame story would have Brad in the present running
around interviewing all these people in old makeup, and Brad could be
Leonardo Di Caprio, except they'd have to dye his hair.  Dodie suggests a
heterosexual love interest for Brad-a rival researcher, perhaps-Julia
Roberts, snappy reporter, with glasses, which she could take off at
opportune moments.

Now for the other characters: the young James Schuyler: Crispin Glover.
Helen Frankenthaler: Judy Davis.  Larry Rivers: David Schwimmer (from TV's
"Friends").

Leonardo di Caprio as James Dean, Angela Bassett (who else?) as Billie
Holiday, Sharon Stone as Lana Turner.

So don't get me started, okay?

In-Reply-To:  <Pine.SV4.3.91.960118133528.7017C-100000@uhunix>

Susan:

        My understanding of the conventional distinction between dialect
and idiolect would go something like this--dialect is (supposedly!) a
cultural or regional outgrowth of difference in a particular
language, or between particular languages, based in use by a shared group of
people in a particular environment, or who consider themselves to have
similar group characteristics, whether national, racial, or ethic.
Dialect tends to posit a certain level of "naturalness"--that is, it
tends not to be considered a self-aware creation of difference in a
particular language, but simply an outgrowth of people's actual
interactions. Dialect is supposedly unconscious, to a certain extent.

Idiolect, on the other hand, is conventionally thought of (if it's
conventionally thought of at all) as being an intellectually CREATED
difference within a particular language or between languages, designed
usually with a certain level of conscious resistance to the normative
language from which it emerges, or, if not resistance, at least with an
awareness that new terminology needs to be created for a certain set of
users.

In practice, of course, these distinctions are not as clear. I'm thinking
for instance of Hugh McDiarmid, whose use of Scottish "dialect" in
poetry is a completely intellectually conscious decision to disrupt
normative English by reinstituting Scots (a language, that for all
official and most unofficial purposes, was pretty much dead in Scotland
at the time, disliked even by many very nationalist Scots). McDiarmid's
use of dialect is therefore in some sense idiolect. I wonder if this is
true of many of the Hawaiian writers in which you're interested...it's
one thing to speak Haole (is that the word?) to a shared group that
understands that language, it's another to assert your right to do so to
people in a literay context outside the group in question...

Does idiolect have elements of dialect, sometimes? I tend to think yes.
Computer languages, for instance, while certainly having a base in
idiolect (they use terms particularly invented by consciously
"intellectual" practitioners), tend more and more to have elements of
"dialect" as they become more unconsciously used "simply as part of the
language" of a cultural subset of, say, English speakers.

Looking forward to your response,

Maria,

I was reminded of the poem even before  I came to the last sentence of your
post.  Especially the opening lines,

"It's natural the Boys should whoop it up for/ So huge a phallic triumph, an
adventure/ it would not have occured to women/ to think worthwhile, made
possible only/ because we like huddling in gangs and knowing/ the exact time:
yes, our sex may in fairness/ Hurrah the deed, although the motives/ That
primed it were somewhat less than menschilch"

I think that's right.

Subject:      elitism

The charge of elitism in poetry rarely, I think, stems from its exclusion of
others.  We can see this by comparing poetry folks to other groups with
specialized interests.  For instance, a zine that focusses on Bobby Brady may
seem weird to most people, but I doubt if it would seem elitist. However, a
zine that presents "difficult" poetry may seems both weird and elitist.  Why?
Because poetry still connotes culture (i.e. social status.) Knowing about
Bobby Brady is not associated in many people's minds with high culture, poetry
is.

When people who think of themselves as "cultured" read "difficult" poetry and
find it incomprehensible, they must protect their status by diffusing the
cultural value of the "difficult" poetry. Hence, they dismiss it as elitist.
(Isn't the charge of "elitism" an attempt at dismissal?)

I believe that many poets working within the experimental (avant-garde,
modernist, etc.) tradition have attempted to sever the ties between poetry and
"high culture." But such severing does not work for those who don't read us,
and when they do they often bring the association with them.  So they dismiss
our work on the basis of a conception of poetry that the work itself is
dismantling.

In the end, the charge of elitism seems hollow to me. I know a lot of poets;
we are not as snobby or arrogant as many people I know who have a lot of
money. In our culture, money is elitist, not poetry.

If someone does charge us of being elitist, perhaps we could offer to show
them some of the language games frequently used by "difficult" poets, and more
will be either clear or obfuscated in a useful way.

Best, Jeff

Shell wrote back.  Any of you interested in seeing what they have to say in

PRIMARY TROUBLE: to answer questions, requests:
the anthology does not (from my point-of-view) seek heroes. it's beside
the point at this date to say here is the best. what nonsense. that's
a game for the academy. primary trouble is edited by and for poets and
tries to document what's been going on. to suggest what the full arc
(ark?) is like. you can't do everything or you'll have a doorstop. so:
the three editors are radically different (RADICALLY different) from
each other in their poetry/poetics. and that's the point. with such
different perspectives, agreement would be something of an achievement.
one couldn't say simply this is what i like, but rather this is
somehow representative. so the contents of the book was the result
of enormous work and argument, and the really amazing thing is that
we are still talking to each other, indeed are still friends. and i
think that although we are still as much in disagreement in matters
of poetics as before, we do feel that the book represents well the
range of work done in the past thirty or so years outside academic and
conservative traditions. No one/nothing is priviliged here, so don't
expect a program or agenda, but the range is here.
the book is the work of poets, not critics, and so the editors include
their own work for anyone who wants to see where their arguments begin.

the point is the community, not heroes. there is also work here by William
Bronk, H.D., Gerrit Lansing, and Emerson (!), and the title is from Duncan.
We hope that these will held "place" the community. But, of course, there
are others--Spicer, Pound, Stevens, etc.--who are essential. The introduction
is leonard's and the is a very extensive poetics section with commentary
by will alexander, clark coolidge, fanny howe, robert kelly, leslie
scalapino, gustaf sobin, anne waldman, and myself. none of these pieces
fall strictly within the dimensions of coventional critical commentary,
for if the anthology as a whole says one thing clearly, it is that poetry
does not exist there, at all.
the book's isbn is 1-883689-28-7 and costs $24.95 (which is a lot but given
printing, shipping, distribution, etc., may very well not be enough to cover
the bills). if it isn't on the shelves in good bookstores already (or
within a few days at most), SHAME on them. the best thing is to ask any
such store to order and stock NOW, but you can also get copies using
Visa/MasterCard by calling 1-800-243-0138. Or through Small Press Distribution
or directly through Login Publishers Consortium/InBook, 1436 West Randolph
Street, Chicago, IL 60607. You have to add $3 postage/shipping for the first
book and $1 for each addition. Talisman doesn't (actually can't) do orders
directly, but we have a new catalog, and if you want copies, please write
to Talisman at P.O.Box 3157, Jersey City, NJ 07303-3157.

On Spicer's martians &/or ghosts: In the first wave of UFO narratives in late-
'40s/early-'50s there was a strange confluence of spiritualism & sci-fi that
was gradually marginalized in ufologists discourse in subsequent decades (but
maybe has leached back into it lately?) -- anyway, possibly Spicer's Martians
come out of that nexus, & so have "ghostly" associations built in?  All this is
documented by Curtis Peebles in a highly recommended book, Watch the Skies! A
Chronicle of the Flying Saucer Myth, Smithsonian,  1994.

Yeah! Anybody see the Saturday New York Times? An article on poetry in
Japan, the tv shows there about poetry, the front-page newspaper columns
about poetry? "Millions of Japanese regularly write poetry--by various
counts 5 million to more than 10 million, out of a population of 125
million--and untold millions more savor the poetry of others." Maybe our
ambition needs to be revised.

Anybody on the list from/in Japan who can speak to this figure of four to
eight percent of the population writing poetry? And then, on the relative
elitisms in poetry there--that is, do "serious" poets--whatever those
are--watch poetry shows? Read the poetry columns? Or is the distinction
between "serious" and "other" configured as something more like
"accomplished" and "novice"?

Another invitation to all POETICS subscribers (& interested friends):

ASSEMBLING ALTERNATIVES: AN INTERNATIONAL POETRY CONFERENCE/FESTIVAL is
scheduled for 29 August - 2 September, 1996 at the New England Center,
University of New Hampshire, U.S.A.  These three and one-half days of
discussions and four nights of readings/performances open to the
community wil focus on relationships & differences between "experimental"
(for lack of a better word) poetries in the U.S., U.K., Canada and
Ireland.  Poets and readers from other countries are also invited to join
us to talk about new directions in these poetries and ways/problems of
reading across cultures.  More than forty poets from the four named
nations will read and perform for the conference gathering and community;
they range from the most well-known (such as Charles Bernstein, Nicole
Brossard, Tom Raworth, Denise Riley, Steve McCaffery, Rae Armantrout,
Maggie O'Sullivan, Allen Fisher, Karen MacCormack, Maurice Scully, Joan
Retallack, Paul Muldoon, Sean O'Luigin, Jeff Derksen, Marjorie Welish, Ken
Edwards, cris cheek, Wendy Mulford, Lyn Hejinian and many others whose
plans are still coming to form) to the most new-on-the-scene(s). Readers
as celebrated and helpful as Marjorie Perloff, Peter Quartermain, Clair
Wills, Peter Middleton, Charles Altieri and a host --too many to name --
of others will be giving papers and leading discussions, as will many of
the poets as well.  Paper-deliverers at this point are coming from as far
away as Taiwan and Tasmania; much is still in flux and spaces are still
open for talks, so do please contact me if you would like more current
information (full schedules of plenary sessions and readings will be
ready in the spring).  Deadline for abstracts have been extended to March
1996.

that so nearly vanishes at a certain point into its contemporaneous
edge that a special effort must be made to illuminate what has happened,
as it is happening. When we speak of _Primary Trouble: An Anthology of
Contemporary American Poetry_, it is to construct, from a fresh perspective,
a formulation of poetic process as it has been explored by several
generations of contemporary American poets. . . . _Primary Trouble_
proposes to provide an alternate focus, a necessary rethinking, of how
our poetry works."

I just received the advance copy of a book I edited, AMERICA'S MODERNISMS:
REVALUING THE CANON (Essays in Honor of Joseph N. Riddel), Louisiana State
University Press, 1996.  ISBN 0-8071-2018-9  It is quite expensive, so get
your local or university library to order it.  My introduction marks what
I see as perhaps my last effort in the high deconstructive mode of
hard-boiled puns and philosophical gestures.
Essays on 19th and 20th century literature and philosophy as well as
a memorial minute by Jacques Derrida and Joe Riddel's last essay might
interest you all; but this is not strictly poetic or poetics.
Essays by Charles Altieri, Mark Bauerlein, Michael Beehler, Paul Bove,
Edgar Dryden, John Johnston, Margot Norris, John Carlos Rowe, and Henry
Sussman and an Afterword by co-editor Joseph Kronick make up the contents.
It is an attractive book, and, while I now am circling back to wilder things,
I suggest you take a look.  Your library needs this one, and my next feels
easier with the encouragement of seeing this FINALLY.  Fuck academic presses:
I finished all the work on this book nearly three years ago.

By the way, it might give you all pleasure--or at least a bit of a
smile?--to know that THE NORTON ANTHOLOGY OF AFRICAN AMERICAN LITERATURE
will include, among its necessarily selected selections, something
of Bob Kaufman and Ted Joans.  Since their work has recently, however
variously and differently, made me re-read things in a new way, I am happy
to know this.  Who knows when this anthology will come out.  I am sure it will
bug some folks BIG TIME for reasons we will know in the fullness of time
and the emptiness of anthologizing futures.

Subject:      ideolect

In "The Poetics of the Americas" I use the word 'ideolect' to suggest a
constructed, ideological self-conscious poetic language practice.  That essay,
which A.L. Neilsen is including in "An Area of Act": Race and Readings in
American Poetry (forthcoming, University of Illinois Press) (I _should_ be
doing the revisions on that now rather than _this_!, any day, A.L.!) discusses
formal and social affinities between dialect and ideolect poetry.  I
particularly emphasize the shared resistance to standard English among dialect
and ideolect poets.  One way or another I have been working on this theme
since the late 1980s and have given several graduate seminars at UB on the
issues (as you can see if you check out my course syllabussssssssssssssses @
writing.upenn.edu/epc).  The titles for those seminars have involved plays on
dialect/dialogue/ideology/ideolect/idiolect/dialogic/dialectic ...
      I use ideolect in order to socialize the idiolectical and indeed the
idiosyncratic but also because the poetry I am writing about is not an
idiolect.  The root contrasts, ideo/idea vs idio/I-own, are the sort of
mutually cancelling, not to say paradoxical, distinctions that are at the
heart the essay (self/nation, individual/group, word/phrase).  In this
context, I read dialect as constructed fully as much as ideolect.
      Susan Schultz refers to a version of my "argument" in her essay in _A
Poetics of Criticism_.
      So, Maria, my use of the term _ideolect_ is not idiosyncratic, though
possibly neologistic; surely ideological.

**

Here's a brief excerpt from "Poetics of the Americas":

In the poetry of the past two decades, I think we have moved away from the
choice of subjective, objective, or even constructive and toward a synthesizing
or juxtaposing these approaches.  Here the influence of the dialect poetries of
the modernist period gives way to a dialectical poetry that refuses allegiance
to Standard English without necessarily basing its claim on an affiliation with
a definable group's speaking practice.  The norm enforces a conduct of
representation that precludes poetry as an active agent to further thought,
unbound to the restrictions of rationalized ordering systems.  Poetry can be a
process of thinking rather than a report of things already settled; an
investigation of figuration rather than a picture of something figured out.
Such ideologically informed nonstandard language practice I call
_ideolectical_. ...
        The invention of an ideolectical English language poetry, as a poetry
of the Americas, involves the replacement of the national and geographically
centered category of English (or Spanish) poetry not with the equally
essentialist category of American poetry but with a field of potentialities, a
virtual America that we approach but never possess.  English languages, set
adrift from the sight/sound sensorium of the concrete experiences of the
English people, are at their hearts uprooted and translated: nomadic in origin,
absolutely particular in practice.  Invention in this context is not a matter
of choice: it is as necessary as the ground we walk on. The impossible poetics
of the Americas of which I speak has, in the U.S., a history of breaks from the
received literary language of England.  The vernacular was a crucial factor in
many of those breaks, particularly as explored by such African-Americans poets
as Paul Laurence Dunbar, Langston Hughes, Sterling Brown, J. W. Johnson, and
Melvin Tolson.  At the same time, the American language was being transformed
by the "bad" or "broken" English of the European immigrants from the 1880s
through the early years of the new century: "new" syntaxes, new expressions
came along with the new world.  Here it is significant that Williams, Gertrude
Stein, Louis Zukofsky and other makers of a new American poetry were themselves
second-language speakers of English, while others were children of
second-language speakers, as Peter Quartermain notes in Disjunctive Poetics.
So for these children of immigrants, English became less transparent, more a
medium subject to reforming.  Correlatively, on the other side of the Atlantic,
the explorations of dialect traditions by Basil Bunting and Hugh MacDiarmid and
in the Caribbean by Claude McKay and more recently by Linton Kwesi Johnson,
Louise Bennett, Michael Smith, or Kamau Brathwaite (who rejects the term
dialect, preferring "nation language"), become a source of shared language
resources among English language poetries.
        I realize that my emphasis on nonstandard language practices makes
for unexpected affiliations.  Tony Crowley, in _Standard English and the
Politics of Language_, points to two senses of "standard".  A standard is
a rallying point for the forward movement of an ideology or group, by
means of which a unity is invoked, as for example a flag in battle.  But a
standard is also an objective unit of measure and regulator of uniformity,
and as such a product of normalization and averaging.  Standard American
English involves both these senses: it is a sociohistorical construction,
embedding class, ethnic, and racial preferences, that serves to build
national unity; and it is also a regulator of language practices, serving
to curb deviance.  Under the aegis of standardization, problems of social
coherence are displaced onto questions of linguistic correctness.
 ......
        As our literary history is usually told, the nonstandard language
practices of the radical modernists, and their descendants, are not linked to
the dialect and vernacular practices of African-American poets.  But the
construction of a vernacular poetry was a major project for many poets, black
and white, during the modernist period, and the fact that these developments
often took place without reference to each other -- the fact of the color line
-- should not now obscure their intimate formal and sociohistorical connection.
Stein's breakthrough into the ideolectical practice of Tender Buttons, for
example, was prepared by her problematic improvisations on African-American
vernacular in "Melanctha".  A generation later, both Melvin Tolson and Louis
Zukofsky used complex literary framing devices as a means of working with, and
against ~ I'd say torquing ~ vernacular linguistic materials.  By linking
dialect and ideolect I wish to emphasize the common ground of linguistic
exploration, the invention of new syntaxes as akin to the invention of new
Americas, or possibilities for America.  In Brathwaite's account, however,
dialect is better called "nation language" and if that is the case it would
seem to run counter to ideolect, whose nations may be described, in Robin
Blaser's phrase, as image nations, imaginary, ideological; dialectical in that
other sense.  I don't wish to relieve this tension so much as to try to locate
it as pivotal to our literary history and contemporary poetics.  I am
convinced, however, that nonstandard writing practices share a technical
commonality that overrides the necessary differences in interpretation and
motivation, and this commonality may be the vortical prosodic force that gives
us footing with one another. .........

Wilder things=a sort of recourse to the old reading list I knew and grew with

Sartre, Camus, watching "Battle of Algiers," thinking through filmic and
essayistic "Black Orpheus," etc. the 60's were more expansively global than
I remember.  I was really too young to be anything but a very precious

This is scattered, but what I mean is that certain resistance movements
in Eastern Europe and, for my money, in Africa and South East Asia were
more alive in the intellectual life of the 60's than one remembers--especially
in the Caribbean and France (including African American ex-pats) continuous
from at least the 40's.  There's wild stuff, along the lines that Charles
was just suggesting, when one reads say exilic (rather than immigrant)
Americans in such a way as to include hard Left and African Americans.

What I would say is that the Martians are what we SEE in the mirror. The
ghosts are what pass through. As to say: the Wall of Truth has only one side
(not this one). So that in Spicer (and recalling the parallel Ed Foster felt
existed with Mallarme) poetry is in fact a function with a lower limit of
writeability and upper limit, death. I don't necessarily think that, but it
strikes me that for Spicer it was true.

Recent refs to the Spicer-in-da-woiks have made me wonder: are there any
really good bios of potes out there now?  I haven't had much luck finding
them myself.  Just started the new Rilke "life" & can't seem to put much
confidence in its assessments so far.  Pretty early on a fairly normal
letter from
8-year-old Rene to his dad gets tagged in bio-talk as sounding "a falsetto
of repressed hysteria."  And there are some really bizarre and slippery
tonalities throughout the little bit i've read.

Has anyone read Lou Andreas-Salome's book on R.?

While I think there are plenty of reasons to "fuck academic presses," I know
that the only presses who do much better than this, time-wise, are the BIG
commercial presses, and the smallest micro/desktop-publish presses. And
while I bless the latter, I have a variety of problems with the former.
Still, Kathryne, it's good to hear about your book, and I look forward to
seeing it.

OK, following the Auden poem on the space race i can't resist bringing
this in.  I've always been in intrigued by a strange, little moment in
Oppen's notebook-writing where, w/ some embarassment, he confesses to
himself the following:

among the things I don't want to say    --out of old friendship--
is this:  if we did NOT undertake the "Space Program" we would cease to be
anything we have meant by "human"   ((all the women I can remember speaking of
of the space program have been opposed to it--Secretly, at these moments,
I regard these women as sub human------I do, I do....


Any comments?

Mebbe i shld follow up on my previous message by quoting the message
that directly preceded/instigated it:


"It's natural the Boys should whoop it up for/ So huge a phallic triumph, an
adventure/ it would not have occured to women/ to think worthwhile, made
possible only/ because we like huddling in gangs and knowing/ the exact time:
yes, our sex may in fairness/ Hurrah the deed, although the motives/ That
primed it were somewhat less than menschilch"

I think that's right.

Dodie/Kevin: when will the Spicer bio be available to the public?

I guess what i was struck by is that even tho' Auden is poking fun at
the Boys he & Oppen both seem to take it for granted that the space is
race is a boy thing ("it would not have occured to women")

The one thing our questionable outside reader never questioned was

By the way, Kathryn also has an essay in this forthcoming book which may

long as the Norton Afro-American collection, which I first heard was
almost ready almost 11 years ago --

It's good to see you extending this discussion of ghosts and Martians
beyond cultural sources, Larry.  While those kinds of tracings are
certainly interesting, I think when you're dealing with someone like Spicer
who speaks of dictation--or anyone who's poetry is really Alive--things get
much messier, can't be broken down into "ghost equals blah blah."  I would
imagine that when Spicer spoke of "ghosts" in terms of explaining his
poetry they were far different "ghosts" than those who actually manifested
themselves in his poetry.

Mark--I have no quarrel with your positioning of idi(e)olect and dialect;
I agree that "lects" are often used strategically rather than
"naturally."  I once asked Lois-Ann Yamanaka, who had delivered a talk in
Michigan about the use of pidgin in her work, why she hadn't given the
talk in pidgin.  She said she would have done so only if she were angry.
Thus, in her use of language, pidgin and standard English are both
markers of "place"; you're an insider or an outsider depending on what
language you speak (or confront).  Other pidgin writers are less angry,
but their sense of community is founded on language.  These writers are
often criticized for writing almost exclusively about their childhoods.
Yet campaigns against the use of pidgin, particularly in school and in
business, have meant that pidgin is the language of childhood; the writer
doesn't choose  the language so much as have it chosen for him or her by
various institutions.  (I think this is changing, in large part because
of literature written in pidgin over the last 20 years or so.)

The origins of pidgin aren't any more "natural" than those of an
idiolect, but I wonder if there are any creole speakers of idiolects?  Do
they get handed down and hence "naturalized"?

Thanks Charles for your post.

It occurs to me that this is an issue better decided by
association than etymology.

For me, idio leads to idiothetic
(as opposed to nomothetic - as a psychologist I associate
here the distinction between individual - and less
"scientific"? - and group tests, data, etc.).
idiopathic
idiosyncratic
idiotic

ideo leads to
ideology
ideal
idea

Then does idiolect refer to individual or one person or
group and ideolect refer to lofty or elevated
content-oriented discourse?

This is my impression on seeing them here.

Subject:      ideolects shaking hands with dialects

On the subject of where ideolects meet with dialects, I'm noting recently
a number of poets who are consciously COMBINING the two possibilities in
interesting ways. Writers like Edwin Torres, Barry Masuda (who Susan
Schultz can say more about) Rodrigo Toscano, Bob
Harrison are both writing out of a position of cultural difference with
greater or lesser interventions of dialect, while at the same time
working in a post-language, disruptive syntax. Precursors seem to be to
me writers like Stephen Jonas, Melvin Tolson and perhaps Lorenzo Thomas.
Actually, I think there's probably more of this kind of poetic activity
going on than I'm currently aware of--I just received a letter from a
writer I don't know by the name of Hung T. Qu (who gives Vietnam and
Southern
California as two of a number of places of residence) who hints at some
of these same issues. I'd be interested if there's anyone out there who
could point me in the direction of more writers working at this extremely
interesting interstice.

Subject:      Boys in space

Hi, it's Kevin Killian.  Let me give me 2 cents about the differences I see
between Oppen and Spicer and their use of space travel in their work.  In
December I gave a lecture at SF State about Oppen, which turned on GO's use
of an epigraph from Heinlein in one of his books.  The Oppens I guess were
very taken by Heinlein-partly, I suppose, since s/f books were among the
few unproscribed by the Party during their Mexican exile in the 50s, they
were books which could be read with impunity, if we can believe Mary
Oppen's memoir, "Meaning a Life."  Spicer's s/f interests were very
different, colored by his own personal terror of "outer space."  He was as
opposed to the space race as the women of Oppen's acquaintance: "I can't
stand to see them shimmering in the impossible music of the Star Spangled
Banner [....] The poetry/ Of the absurd comes through San Francisco
television.  Directly connected with moon rockets./  If this is dictation,
it is driving/ Me wild."  Whether this poem (Ten Poems for Downbeat #5,
"for Huntz") refers to the space program or to the concurrent WNET/Richard
Moore series on American poets, there's an ambivalence here that I believe
stems back from Spicer's early paranormal experience.  When he was very
young JS had a vision of a "murder in space."  Apparently in a dream (but
perhaps actually in what we would now call an experience of, yes, alien
abduction[???] where is that Harvard guy who gives credence to these
accounts!) Spicer saw someone killed before his eyes by strange Martian
space creatures in deep space, hence (?) his later preference for s/f on
the darker side of Heinlein (tho' he did like "The Green Hills of
Earth")-like his erstwhile roommate Philip K. Dick.

PS, in my Oppen talk I cited the "red globes" of his "Discrete Series" and
called attention to the cult of Heinlein among spanking enthusiasts
(Heinlein's novels startle with their hundreds of references to spanking:
an obsessive, awkward, almost Bettie Page, frankness).  This caused a bit
of a stir.

Dear Pierre and all, I have mixed feelings about both the Tom Clark and
Brad Gooch books.  I read a very good biography of Sarah Orne Jewett a few
weeks ago.  Also, expect great things of Carolyn Burke's forthcoming life
of Mina Loy which she has been working on for, gee, I can't remember how
long.  Ten or twelve years?

I agree with you. There are ghosts and then there are ghosts. And as you
note, the explanatory ghosts have more to do with the HISTORY of the work
than with its afterlife. But then let me indulge in a cultural parallel: last
a week a small pharmaceutical company (mainly a producer of generics) lost a
court case brought against a larger one, the patent holder of AZT. Despite
the argument of manifest public good, the patent was upheld (along with the
price), so that we will not soon see a generic (and less expensive) AZT.

Kurt -- Clark's book is nasty, belittling, invidious -- besides
containing a number of errors. The best way to get a sense of that is to
read the reviews by Gerrit Lansing and Don Byrd which were published in
SULFUR 29 (Fall 1991). There is also, I believe, an issue of the "Minutes
of the Charles Olson Society" (edited by ralph Maud from Vancouver) --
though i can't for the life of me lay my hands on that specific issue
right now. -- Pierre

You-all might be interested in reading the "Minutes of the Charles Olson
Society" (here's the address-1104 Maple Street, Vancouver, BC   V6J 3R6,
Canada)-which gives through its many issues a page by page listing of every
time Tom Clark got something wrong-a fascinating exercise.  Clark's account
of Olson's visits to Ezra Pound at St. Elizabeth's, for example, make CO
seem like a middle-aged man on the make, sucking up to an insane yet
influential power broker.  Obviously it's a relationship with great
reverberations for poetic history, yet Clark makes it a late forties
version of the awful Shakespeare plot in "My Own Private Idaho."  I think
Clark's revelations about Frances Boldereff are truly striking-whatever
part she played in CO's thought-his secrecy, almost duplicity, about her,
is very strange, and these revelations color the rest of the book.  In
general I think Clark isn't bad when writing about Olson's early
career-there's a LOT of new information in the book.  It's the later life
that he stumbles on, but who doesn't?  But then again the tone of the book
is like Joe McGinnis' in "Fatal Vision," as though Clark started out by
liking and admiring Olson, but the book reveals a gradual and complete
hatred of his subject, and in every instance Olson is placed in an
unflattering light, sometimes "unfairly."  So it's not the the squeamish.

Jordan,

I thought the Gooch bio quite bad, just flip through and read only his
citations of the poetry-- he made O'Hara into a boring poet. Another book to
be missed is _The Roaring Silence_, bio of Cage by Revill. Neither book gives
the context &/of the work together in any useful way.

Dierdre Bair's Beckett & Beauvoir books are both excellent.
& Ray Monk's Wittgenstein, excellent. & Jack Chamber's Miles, best music bio
I know. Still waiting for someone to write the book on Coltrane, or Duchamp,
or. . .

reflection on the physical.  so that, for example, the reality of death in
childbirth for many women until relatively recently is not only a physical
problem, but also a psychological one that raises questions about, for
example, the value of one's own life, what risks are "normal" to take, etc.,
the human dilemmas of "choice," freedom, and so on.

--------------------------

Imagine if you will... the leader of the fifth alien invader force
speaking to the alien commander in chief...

"They're made out of meat."

"Meat?"

"Meat. They're made out of meat."

"Meat?"

"There's no doubt about it. We picked several from different parts of the
planet, took them aboard our recon vessels, probed them all the way
through. They're completely meat."

"That's impossible. What about the radio signals? The messages to the
stars."

"They use the radio waves to talk, but the signals don't come from them.
The signals come from machines."

"So who made the machines? That's who we want to contact."

"They made the machines. That's what I'm trying to tell you. Meat made
the machines."

"That's ridiculous. How can meat make a machine? You're asking me to
believe in sentient meat."

"I'm not asking you, I'm telling you. These creatures are the only
sentient race in the sector and they're made out of meat."

"Maybe they're like the Orfolei. You know, a carbon-based intelligence
that goes through a meat stage."

"Nope. They're born meat and they die meat. We studied them for several
of their life spans, which didn't take too long. Do you have any idea the
life span of meat?"

"Spare me. Okay, maybe they're only part meat. You know, like the
Weddilei. A meat head with an electron plasma brain inside."

"Nope. We thought of that, since they do have meat heads like the
Weddilei. But I told you, we probed them. They're meat all the way
through."

"No brain?"

"Oh, there is a brain all right. It's just that the brain is made out of
meat!"

"So... what does the thinking?"

"You're not understanding, are you? The brain does the thinking. The
meat."

"Thinking meat! You're asking me to believe in thinking meat!"

"Yes, thinking meat! Conscious meat! Loving meat. Dreaming meat. The meat
is the whole deal! Are you getting the picture?"

"Omigod. You're serious then. They're made out of meat."

"Finally, Yes. They are indeed made out meat. And they've been trying to
get in touch with us for almost a hundred of their years."

"So what does the meat have in mind?"

"First it wants to talk to us. Then I imagine it wants to explore the
universe, contact other sentients, swap ideas and information. The
usual."

"We're supposed to talk to meat?"

"That's the idea. That's the message they're sending out by radio.
'Hello. Anyone out there? Anyone home?' That sort of thing."

"They actually do talk, then. They use words, ideas, concepts?"

"Oh, yes. Except they do it with meat."

"I thought you just told me they used radio."

"They do, but what do you think is on the radio? Meat sounds. You know
how when you slap or flap meat it makes a noise? They talk by flapping their
meat at each other. They can even sing by squirting air through their
meat."

"Omigod. Singing meat. This is altogether too much. So what do you
advise?"

"Officially or unofficially?"

"Both."

"Officially, we are required to contact, welcome, and log in any and all
sentient races or multibeings in the quadrant, without prejudice, fear,
or favor. Unofficially, I advise that we erase the records and forget the
whole thing."

"I was hoping you would say that."

"It seems harsh, but there is a limit. Do we really want to make contact
with meat?"

"I agree one hundred percent. What's there to say?" `Hello, meat. How's
it going?' But will this work? How many planets are we dealing with here?"

"Just one. They can travel to other planets in special meat containers,
but they can't live on them. And being meat, they only travel through C
space. Which limits them to the speed of light and makes the possibility
of their ever making contact pretty slim. Infinitesimal, in fact."

"So we just pretend there's no one home in the universe."

"That's it."

"Cruel. But you said it yourself, who wants to meet meat? And the ones
who have been aboard our vessels, the ones you have probed? You're sure they
won't remember?"

"They'll be considered crackpots if they do. We went into their heads and
smoothed out their meat so that we're just a dream to them."

"A dream to meat! How strangely appropriate, that we should be meat's
dream."

"And we can mark this sector unoccupied."

"Good. Agreed, officially and unofficially. Case closed. Any others?
Anyone interesting on that side of the galaxy?"

"Yes, a rather shy but sweet hydrogen core cluster intelligence in a
class nine star in G445 zone. Was in contact two galactic rotation ago, wants
to be friendly again."

"They always come around."

"And why not? Imagine how unbearably, how unutterably cold the universe
would be if one were all alone."

I don't know why everyone is putting City Poet down. I loved it. I
especially liked learning that "cup of joe" means coffee. Also, I think
superficial stories about poets become more interesting after they've been
repeated verbatim 3 or 4 times in the same book.

Seriously this time: recently I read the Ernst Pawel biography of Kafka
("The Nightmare of Reason") & loved it. Lots of historical
contextualization -- a move away from the psychologizing portrait towards
an understanding of Kafka's situation in German Jewish society.

I haven't read Wagner-Martin's _Favored Stangers_ yet although I have it beside
my desk. The one from a few years ago, Souhami's _Gertrude and Alice_ does
weird things like reads Stein's autobiographies without irony and too
literally. I
would not recommend it.

The one that seems the most accurate is still James Mellow's _Charmed Circle_
It is also very dull.

Although I don't have a copy at hand, I believe that this is "They're Made
Out of Meat," a story by Terry Bisson originally published in _Omni_.
Bisson is a nice guy, but he would probably not be amused at having his
work passed around without his name or permission. I'd suggest buying his
recent short-story collection instead.

Ray,

Thanks for the information.  Someone else also let me know after the post that
it is Bisson's story.  It arrived by e-mail without an author listed and in no
way do I mean to piss Terry off.  However, I am going to try and use the
expression "flapping their meat" as often as possible in daily chit-chat, and I
will probably not cite Mr. Bisson.  Thanks too for the shopping tip.

This was my impression of Clark too; it seems clear that Clark considers
Olson to have pretty much wrecked himself later in life.  This assessment
is worth considering, but Clark's growing distaste for Olson becomes
overwhelming at least by Black Mountain and sours his readings of the
later poems.

The amazing thing is that Robert Creeley wrote a blurb for the thing.  My
feeling is that he was snowed by the idea of the "allegory" as an
examination of multiple levels of identity, multiple biographies.  That at
least was what he was stressed in conversation at a North Carolina reading
in 1990.

Cheers,

My (recently acquired, unread, & now it might stay that way) copy of
Clark's Olson bio also has a blurb by Dana Gioia, which I find incongruous
to say the least. I have to assume he's the same as Mr. New Formalist. Was
he a) striking out into new (projective) fields, or b) writing *before*

Answers:

a) not hardly.

b) before his self-identification as the William Bennett of poetry, Gioia
worked in business, for Proctor & Gamble I believe (identified on the
national news tonight as *both* the makers of Olestra (tm) nonfat fat and
the #1 advertiser on daytime talk shows).

I have heard conflicting rumors about whether Gioia was in mergers &
acquisitions or marketing.  In one story, he's a classic Reagan-era
corporate raider, while in the other version he's behind that really cool
Hawaiian punch ad where the punch-bowl breaks through the wall.

Why shouldn't a "new formalist" like the Clark bio of Olson?

I didn't think it was that terrible, though I found the tone kind of
incongruous, as though he was trying to keep a straight face.

It's too bad that Ed Sanders wasn't the one to write what might be the
only Olson bio this millenium.

Dear John:

I'm not sure about that, not being an expert on the Japanese poetry.  But I
would imagine a good proportion of the Japanese who write poetry write
traditional formal poetry--tanka, haiku and others--not lineated verse
which is called here "gendai-shi" or "modern poetry."  Because of its
brevity and formal simplicity, tanka or haiku looks to be easier to make
than free verse, and hence its popularity, I  guess.  There are programs on
the education channel for those who compose tanka or haiku poems ("t.v.
shows about Japanese poetry"?);  the viewers send their poems to the
instructors who pick out some and revise them--something like a creative
writing course on T.V.  There are daily columns about poetry on the front
page of newspapers, normally short commentary on one tanka or haiku poem.
And in the Sunday edition a whole page is devoted to a bit longer columns
about poetry as well as sections for contributions from the readers. The
columns are written by the "accomplished" poets who write as chief members
of the coterie magazines and teach "novices."  I doubt that they watch the
T.V. tanka/haiku programs but they would probably read the newspaper
columns about poetry because they are in newspapers and short.  As far as I
know, there are no T.V. classes for so-called "modern poetry."

It's difficult to decide whether or not the accomplished tanka/haiku poets
are elite.  They can be medical doctors, university professors, company
executives, etc., but there are also shop clerks, farmers and housewives
whose poems get published and reviewed.  So one can't generalize them as
social elite.  There are a number of schools of haiku and tanka, and some
of them are very conventional and some aren't.  Tanka, especially, has a
really long history, and although there are a few radical tanka poets, it's
often associated with the emperor system--you can read examples in the Web
version of _Ogura Hyakunin Isshu_ in the "Japanese Text Initiative" at
University of Virginia and University of Pittsburgh (URL:
http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/japanese/index.html)--and many people still
consider it to be the national poetic form.  The postwar "modern
poets"--especially the "Waste Land" School--made great efforts to deny all
kinds of poetry that can be associated with tanka for this reason.  It
should be pointed out too that there was a certain period of time in the
past (during the medeival times) when some aristocrats tried to keep away
from the populace what they thought of as the secret of composition.

Tanka or haiku, which is fairly easy to make and is thus open to a wide
variety of population, can of course attain a high level of sophistication
and/or difficulty, and if the poems get difficult, the poet who composes
them might be subject to a charge of estrangement of the populace. Whether
or not the practitioner is social elite (or intellectual elite), and
irrespective of the intention of the poet, it seems to me that
sophisticated or difficult poetry tends to be regarded here as elite
literature and sometimes elitist, probably because of the relative
imperviousness to the untrained readers.

Personally, though, I think sophistication is quite an important element in
poetry writing.

Best.

Subject:      Re: topo gigio ('Salright?)

I think every biographer runs the risk that whatever narrative frame
they put over their subject will feel violative to any who actually
knew the subject (consider, for example, tho it's a bio of a place more
than a person, the carping that went on at the time about Martin
Duberman's Black Mountain). I haven't read the Gooch yet (just picked
it up remaindered) but plan to give it a fair hearing later this year.

An old acquaintance, Ilene Philipson, wrote a biography of Ethel
Rosenberg a few years back in which (1) she admitted that the evidence
suggested that Julius was clearly up to something, whether or not it
qualified as being central to the atom spy plot and (2) speculated
about why a mother would "abandon" her children by going to her
execution when she could have saved herself by speaking up about point
#1. Nowhere in the book was there any suggestion that point (1) above
justified being murdered by the state. I know that Ilene thought of her
book as a sympathetic portrait and I don't think she was at all
prepared for the backlash that flew out of the still pretty close-knit
veterans of the Rosenberg Defense and the Rosenberg's sons, Michael and
Robby. Biography of those about whom others can still testify seems to
me an impossible task.

In Clark's case, the great sin is its total disinterestedness in the
poetry of Olson, even though presumably it was the occasion for writing
the bio in the first place. There's an awful lot of psychological
projection here as well (Clark seems to identify with the "poet as
monster" theme both here and in his work on Celine). The fundamental
gimmick of the book is Clark's discovery of Olson's affair in the early
1950s: he then accounts for everything Olson wrote during that fertile
period by relating it to this one detail. The theme of allegory (much
overstated in its importance to Olson at least for my reading) isn't
carried forward very well. As an idea it comes and goes, invoked once
in awhile and then just dropped for the next twenty pages. Sort of like
lumps in your oatmeal. Some of the book is so poorly stitched together
that I wonder seriously if Clark himself wrote all of it. At one point
the UC Press was supposed to issue this, so its appearance from Norton
suggests some sort of turbulent history.

The sad thing is that it's unlikely that we will have another attempt
at a bio any time soon. A book like this really blocks others. As it
is, several of the sources Clark used have passed away in recent years.

For more positive examples of biography as genre, what about Barbara
Guest's work on HD?

Further to Nagahata-san's comments on widespread poetry writing in Japan,
and its relationship to elitism (and also to the original post which came
off of a New York Times piece on poetry in Japan), there is a long
Japanese tradition of accumulating cultural capital through skill at
various cultural pursuits, with teachers, schools, and intensely social
practice.  I think it ceased to be exclusively "elite" practice (in the
sense of courtly activity) and became generally middle-class by the 17th
century.

the NY Times article referred to a best-selling book of tanka from
several years ago, unnanmed, which was probably the "Sarada kinenbi"
(Salad Anniversary) which was controversial for using western loan words
and other very contempory vocabulary in the tanka (34 syllable) form,
which was serious genre mixing and sort of violated the proprieties.  it
was also interesting for bringing a certain voice into Japanese poetry
that had not existed before, something like the Anne Waldman voice in
Giant Night or Baby Breakdown, and it was controversial because of that
sensibility as well.  the voice of the Office Lady.

        (i.e. don't pay for!) Amy Clampitt's _The Kingfisher_ which, yes, has
        a couple of epigraphs from _Call Me Ishmael_ as I remember.

    Thanks for the info. on JAPAN....
    Curious about more of these "Wasteland" poets...
    Takahashi I guess is one.
    But does anybody on this list (whether Japanese or other) know
    anything about TOSHIRO YAMAZAKI (hopefully spelled right)---
    There was a poem of his in an old CALIBAN (pre #10) called something
    like "I'm Sending Lautreamont To America" which was really interesting
    I thought--but I was never able to find more by him (and the ed. of
    Caliban never answered my letter and gave me the address of the poet--

****************************************
IS NATURE DEAD?
IT DEPENDS ON WHAT YOU READ.
****************************************

Celebrate the Launching of
TERRA NOVA: NATURE & CULTURE
The Literary Magazine of the New Environmentalism

at The Learning Alliance
324 Lafayette Street, NYC
January 26th and 27th, 1996

Today, there is a need to understand the human relationship to
nature in a bold and different way. Terra Nova is the journal of
this new culture. It is not one-sided, but diverse and exploratory.
It is not sentimental or starry-eyed, but accepts nature in all its
confusion and complexity. It does not spurn technology, but
looks for creative visions of the future.

Terra Nova digs into the mix between the urbane and the wild
with contributions from philosophy, literature, history,
anthropology, science, environmental studies, politics, activism
and the arts. A wide-ranging mix of essays, reportage, interviews,
fiction, poetry, photography, and all forms of cultural reflection
on the human relationship to nature. By dissolving the borders
between the academic and the literary, Terra Nova will show
that serious discussion of environmental issues can be found in
the most surprising places.

Terra Nova is for anyone interested in the relationship between
nature and culture.  Is that you?  We hope to see you there.
--David Rothenberg, editor.

RToo many people labor under the misconception that our
environmental crisis is a problem of techonology. The material
in Terra Nova reminds us that itUs a problem of the human
spirit, and that its solutions will have as much to do with the
power of the soul as with solar power.S
Bill McKibben

RTerra Nova promises to make an important contribution to the
most critical descisions facing humanity today.S
Peter Matthiessen


Friday January 26th, 8 pm-10pm
Readings from our first issues.  Party to Follow!

Editor David Rothenberg introduces the whole project.  Charles
Bowden  rhapsodizes the rise and fall of the American desert.
Michael Fox on respect for the Earth and communal good.
David Abram reading from The Spell of the Sensuous.  Poetry by
Ben Lieberman, Arthur Solway.  Claire Pentecost playing animal
charades.  Amanda Means photogramming the inside of flowers.
Melissa Nelson on Native American views of nature.  John P.
OUGrady on the disappearance of D.B. Cooper.  Music with David
Rothenberg, Glen Moore, and Glen Velez.  David Appelbaum
reading from Everyday Spirits.  Georgia Marsh on painting
beyond nature.


Saturday, January 27th, 10am-4pm
Workshops and panel discussions around the following themes:


ART
Adam David Clayman (photographer), Claire Pentecost (artist,
writer), Arthur Solway (poet, art critic), Tim Druckrey (photo critic,
curator)


How can art comment on the relationship between humanity
and nature without becoming propoganda?  How can we judge
the quality of art whose subject is our relationship with nature?
What natural images have we seen too much of, and what have
we seen too little of?


PUBLISHING
Emerson Blake (Orion Magazine), Steve Chase (South End
Press), Jim Motovalli (E Magazine), Charles Bowden (writer),
Sabine Hrechdakian (Terra Nova), David Applebaum (Parabola)

Who is publishing environmental thought these days?  Do they
realize it?  Does it sell?  Should it?  How should nature/culture
writing be better marketed?  Does the public care?


EDUCATION
Mitch Thomashow (Antioch New England), Melissa Nelson (UC
Davis), John Clark, (Loyola New Orleans), Wendy Brawer
(designer, creator of NYC GreenMap), Amy Knisley (Terra Nova)

Should environmental ideas seep into the entire curriculum?
What do you do with these degrees once you're done?  Where
should you go to get one?


MUSIC AND MAGIC
David Rothenberg (clarinet), Michael Fox (didjeridu), Glen
Moore (bass), David Abram (magic)

Music seems less representational than other arts, so it is often
left out of the environmentalist fray, or relegated to flute and
birdsong atmospherics.  Is there more that music can do?


Admission is sliding scale, pay what you can based on income:
Friday: $5-$15, Saturday: $25-$45

Maria D, is there a way I could get a look at your piece on angels? is it going
to appear somewhere?  I've been working on angels & aliens too, but kind of
relegated the whole thing to the backburner when popular angelology reached cri
tical mass & overwhelmed by efforts to stay abreast of it.  I liked very much
your material on angels & Duncan/Spicer nexus in "Dark End of the Street," &
am curious where you have gone with it since then.

Subject:      Japanese poetry and elitism (follow-up)

Here's a follow-up on the issue of elitism and Japanese poetry from my
colleague, Takashi Wakui, who wrote a dissertation on the history of
"gendai shi" or "modern poetry" in Japan.  Please send comments directly to
him.  He seems to be too busy to subscribe to the Poetics list.  By the
way, he has recently put John Geraet's reading on his w.w.w. homepage.  The
URL is http://lang.nagoya-u.ac.jp/~wakui/.  (Click "Video.")

Hi.  I'm a colleague of Akitoshi's.  He is my linked verse (renga) mate.
He studies modern and post modern American poetry but writes well crafted
renga verses replete with classical diction and allusions to traditional
Japanese literature.  I'm usually the one who shakes up the learned
classical tone and brings the course of narrative to our world of the late
20th century.  But that doesn't mean I'm at war with the tradition.  As
Akitoshi himself says, a certain amount of sophistication is essential for
poetry, be it "gendaishi" or traditional verse such as tanka, renga, or
haiku.  I agree with him completely on that point.  There is pop music and
serious music.  Similarly there is pop poetry (lyrics to pop music) and
serious poetry.  The word "elitist" is a non neutral and usually derogatory
term used by those who are faction conscious.  The best tactic to deal with
such name calling is to simply ignore.  However, if you have anxiety about
the diminished readership of the kind of poetry you write and feel
defensive about it, you might end up overreacting to the attack and mutter
something like, "but it's money that's elitist".  What does that  mean?
Everybody knows that money is unfairly shared, there is no money in poetry
unless you are a Bob Dylan or a Paul Simon (if you want money write like
Paul Simon!!), etc.  Wouldn't you think, by the same token, that your
ability to express yourself thru your type of poetry (be it language
poetry, new formalist, renga, etc) is also unevenly shared by the general
public thus resulting in a small readership?  Yes.  You are degrading
yourself if you counter the charge of eliticism by invoking the evils of
capitalism, because you are thus betraying your defensiveness and anxiety
about your existance as a poet.  Let's recall John Cage and Milton Babitt.
The former said something to the effect: sure, you can do the same thing;
why don't you do it?  The latter's reply was: I wouldn't give a damn if
nobody listened.  These people are/ were at peace with themselves.  They
know/ knew that they were limited by their genes and history so that they
could only create in a certain number of ways.
        Akitoshi's account of the "popularity of poetry" in Japan is
accurate.  As far as I know there exist no tv programs on "gendai shi",
although some universities and other schools offer creative writing courses
that teach you to write such a type of non traditional (neither tanka,
renga, haiku, etc.) poetry.  The short traditional forms are "popular"
precisely because they are relatively easy to compose due to their brevity
and well established codes and conventions.  Even a not so smart emperor
can compose a tanka poem in the classical mode, becasue all he has to do is
to fill in the blanks of a preestablished form.  But this doesn't mean all
contemporary tanka and haiku are popular and easy to read.  There are a
certain number of haiku and tanka poets who write for the "elite" readers.
My personal view is that even such poetry is easier to write than the
longer form, precisely because it's short.  I sometimes wonder why such
poets wouldn't try their hands at the longer form.  I suspect that they
might be like Japanese professional baseball players who are content with
playing in Japan.  Not many are like Nomo who risked failure to play in a
more challenging world.

Subject:      Paul Mariah

Poet, editor and publisher of Manroot books, Paul Mariah died of
pneumonia on January 12. He was 58.

The name Mariah was chosen by Paul when he moved to San Francisco after
having served a term in prison somewhere in the midwest for homosexual
activity (!). By the mid 1960s, he was a one-man campaign for the idea
of a poetics out of the closet. When Judy Grahn and Pat Parker began
actively promoting a lesbian aesthetic, Paul's work had already created
a context for thinking and writing in similar terms. After Spicer's
death in '65 and the move of Blaser, Stanley and Persky up to British
Columbia, Mariah actively promoted the Spicer Circle and the SF
Renaissance, always foregrounding the issue of gender orientation.

In publishing Spicer's _15 False Propositions About God_ and the
Manroot issue celebrating Spicer (#10), Mariah was one of the few
people to make Spicer's work available in the period between that
poet's death and the arrival of the Collected Books in 1975. He also
published books by Cocteau, Stephen Jonas (again, _Two for Jack
Spicer_), Lynn Lonidier, Robert Ingersoll and others.

His own books of poetry included _The Spoon Ring_, _Persona Non Grata_,
_Diana_ and _Six Imaginary Letters of Young Caesar on the Bythenian
Tour, 81 B.C._.

Paul was one of the first poets to support my own work and it was
through his reading series held at the old Albany Public Library on
Solano Avenue in 1968 (the same room, by chance, where six years
earlier I'd discovered Williams _The Desert Music_ and realized that I
was going to be a poet) that I first met both David Bromige and David
Melnick. Melnick used to kid me that I'd lifted my public reading style
directly from Paul.

Paul moved up to the Russian River later on and gradually became less
visible on the scene. The last time I saw him was at the Eigner
celebration at the University Art Museum in Berkeley a couple of years
ago. He was surprisingly frail, with a long beard, full of humor and
playing the Ancient Fairye role to the hilt.

Here's a sample of his work. I believe that it's a portrait of the
Irish lawyer/poet James Liddy. Around '67, Liddy was at SF State and,
when drunk (any day after 5 pm), would take on the persona of Spicer.


SOCRATES, MISGNOMED
                   for Victor Turks

O I could never call _him_,
Socrates.  He is too

Irish-Catholic, bourgeois
Middle-class white collar

Lawyer and liberal, the
Worst kind, smug.

His liberalness:
Boys and booze.

His only suffering
That he himself knows.

O what's a little
Suffering, more or less.

"Jack Spicer is alive
And well in Ireland." No,

He is sleeping
In too few libraries

With his boots on
And nothing else

But "the radio."

Subject:      Charles Madge 1912-1996

I thought I'd just record here sadly the death of Charles Madge, on 17 January
(obituary spotted in The Guardian, London, yesterday).

He was the founder of Mass Observation, the social reportage movement of the
1930s and 40s, which had its roots in socialism and surrealism but became a
precursor of the opinion polling and market research industries. He was also a
poet, initially associated with Auden, Spender and Day-Lewis (and once married
to Kathleen Raine). He was taken up by T S Eliot, who published two collections
under the Faber imprint -- The Disappearing Castle (1937) and The Father Found
(1941). They were republished by Anvil Press in 1994, together with uncollected
poems, under the title Of Love, Time and Places: Selected Poems.

Robert Hampson and I reprinted "Bourgeois News", a collage prose poem from the
first (1937) collection in an early issue of Alembic in the 1970s. It
anticipates the "new sentence" by some years! Here's the opening paragraph:

"Floods are frequent because the rivers of Britain have been neglected for a
century. Positive movements of transgression carry the sea and its deposits over
the lands, drowning them and their features under tens or hundreds of fathoms of
water. Efforts to advance the prosperity of the country should be directed
towards building on the foundations already laid by the native himself, rather
than to hazardous introductions or innovations. Commercial possibilities are not
clearly and courageously visualised, and the new ventures are often the product
and concern of individuals facing the traditional difficulties of lonely
pioneers. The indoor staff remains comparatively small. The vigour of mountain
building, of volcanoes, and of other manifestations of unrest, has shown no sign
of senility or lack of energy. An operator received concussion and a wound on
the head from a cast-iron cover blown off a 60A switch-fuse box."

Much of his output is more conventional (after all, there wasn't the context for
this kind of stuff in Britain in the 30s) but to my mind Madge was a
consistently more interesting poet than, say, Spender or Graves.

Thanks Ken for posting on Charles Madge. An aye-aye to his considerably
rangey influence. Also, for those who know nothing as yet of such matters,
cross over at least to the films of Humphrey Jennings.

I'd go as far as to say that somehow, and there's a useful paper lurking
here, an understanding of the work of Mass Observation would be a strong
grounding for reading English poetry out of the loosely affiliated London
core in the 1970-1990 period. Mass Observation's work, taken at its
broadest trajectories intercedes Robert Smithson's writings (in particular
the unbelievably highly recommended, in my opinion, 'Frederick Law Olmsted
and the Dialectical Landscape', 'The Spiral Jetty', 'Incidents of
Mirror-Travel in the Yucatan' and 'A Tour of the Monuments of Passaic, New
Jersey'  -  most of which Barrett Watten cites in his essay 'Total
Syntax'); even the Situationist International 'derive'.

love and love

More on Charles Madge.

In _Parataxis 4_, there's the following little note from a short letter
devoted to "lost precursors":

"Charles Madge.  _The Disappearing Castle_, Faber 1937, is probably all.  But
enough for anyone, I mean long lifetimes of assiduous modern-poeting haven't
touched the penetrative delicacy of this one book."

Signed by one "Reginald."  I'm guessing that's Peter Riley.  Anybody know for
sure?

For any of you Poetics List people who live in the Bay Area:

Small Press Traffic Literary Art Center is seeking (non-paid) interns to
help with its transition from a small press bookstore to a resouce center.

Interns would be involved in the following activities/projects:  processing
our stock as part of our transition from a bookstore to a resource center
(includes sorting books, writing letters, returning books), grant writing
assistance, bulk mailings, newsletter production, developing and
maintaining a WorldWideWeb site, advertising and promotion, membership
drive, assistance at events (readings, receptions, fundraisers), moving to
and helping set up our new office space, setting up writing workshops for
under-served populations, and various other administrative tasks.

While our intern position involves some grunge work, there will also be
opportunities for interns to work within the Bay Area writing community, to
meet writers from around the country, to go to parties, and, hopefully, to
have fun.

Prospective interns can leave a message at the Small Press Traffic
voicemail:  415/281-9338.

Thank you,
Dodie Bellamy

I am new to this list as well, so I hope I'm not covering old ground with
my post.

I'm interested in poems that have been set to music, music inspired by
poets, music made by poets, etc.

For example: Some poetic/musical admixtures (25-cent word) I have
discovered in the last year or so:
Georgi Sviridov- Esenin's poems
Shostakovich- poems by Rilke, Tsvetaeva, Mallarme, et al.
Van Morrison- "Before the World Was Made" - Yeats
Peter Laughner- "Sylvia Plath"

There is also apparently a Russian composer who has put some Pasternak
poems to music - I'd love to know who it is.

If you know of any similar examples I would be very grateful for an email.

I've never heard of Toshio Yamazaki.  His name, though, is in the directory
of _Gendaishi Techo_, nationwide commercial magazine of gendai-shi (modern
poetry).  And our librarian spotted a book by Yamazaki called _Joeichu_
(_On the Air_) in a database.  The datum shows he was born in 1947 and the
book was published in 1966.  I'll request it next week.  His first name, by
the way, literally means "ten deaths and lives."

Subject:      Arechi poets

Chris -- in vol 2 of MILLENNIUM we'll have a section on the "Wasteland"
poets -- though we call them by their Japanese name, i.e. the "Arechi"
poets. We include Tamura Ryuichi,Tanikawa Shuntaro,Ooka Makoto &
Shiraishi Kazuko. But then that book won't be out til late next year...


As far as I know, Tanikawa, Ooka and Shiraishi aren't called "Arechi" poets
here.  Here is a quote from _Kodansha Encyclopedia of Japan_.

Arechi (Waste Land).  Influential post-World War II poetry magazine;
originally founded before the war [wwII] by a small group of Waseda
University students led by Ayukawa Nobuo and Morikawa Yoshinobu (1918-42),
it became an important yearly review of modern poetry starting in 1951.
The first series of Arechi, which took its name from T.S. Eliot's poem,
"The Waste Land," appeared briefly between 1939-40.  Revived after the war,
the second series (1947-48) was published by a group of young poets who
best represent the developement of modern poetry in the first postwar
decade.  Collectively known as the Arechi poets (though not a coterie per
se), the group's central figures were Ayukawa Nobuo and Tamura Ryuichi (b
1923).  Adherents included Kitamura Taro (b 1922), Kuroda Saburo (b 1919),
Miyoshi Toyoichiro (b 1920), Nakagiri Masao (b 1919), and, later, Yoshimoto
Takaaki.  Viewing Japan as a "wasteland" in the immediate postwar years and
drawing on their wartime experiences, they sought to reestablish the
reliability of the language and to reconstruct modern poetry in the postwar
era.   --Theodore W. Goossen


Tanikawa and Ooka, who were in the so-called postwar second generation,
were chief members of another poetry magazine, _Kai_ (founded 1953).  Often
in comparison with _Arechi_, _Kai_ is usually characterized by its
internalization of the social and political stances (stress on the personal
voice), as opposed to Arechi's collective and more overt social/political
voices.

Phil,

Don't forget the setting of one of Charles Olson's Maximus Poems
recorded by The Fugs in the 1960s, the Hugo Ball sound poem recorded by
the Talking Heads in the mid-70s or the dreadfully awful version of The
Desert Music done by Steve Reich (completely at odds with the spirit of
the poem). Charles Shere is has done settings for some of Gertrude
Stein's work and is currently doing the same for Carl Rakosi. (His
email address is Charles_Shere@bmug.org)

Celia Zukofsky's setting of Louis' work in "A" 24 may be the most
famous instance of a poem "set to music" in our time.

I once heard Lew Welch do a Motown version of The Waste Land (and I'll
wager, since this was at SF State, that it's somewhere in the vast
audio archives there that Laura Moriarty oversees), but Eliot's estate
would not permit him to record it. It was tremendous and hysterically
funny all at once.

I'm sure there must be oodles more.

When this showed up on The Sixties list yesterday, I read it as a
contribution to the discussion of creoles, pidgins and ideo(idio)lects.
So I'll repost it here.

[Since I work at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, the NASA site that
flies Voyager, and not Los Alamos (GRRRR!), I had lunch one day with
Peterson Zha, then President of the Navajo Nation. He told us the story
and to make sure it's told properly I'll tell it again as it was told.]


  About 1966 or so, a NASA team doing work for the Apollo moon mission
took the astronauts near Tuba City where the terrain of the Navajo
Reservation looks very much like the Lunar surface.  With all the
trucks and large vehicles were two large figures that were dressed in
full Lunar spacesuits.

  Nearby, a Navajo sheep herder and his son were watching the strange
creatures walk about, occasionally being tended by personnel.  The two
Navajo people were noticed and approached by the NASA personnel.  Since
the man did not know English, his son asked for him what the strange
creatures were and the NASA people told them that they are just men
that are getting ready to go to the moon.  The man became very excited
and asked if he could send a message to the moon with the astronauts.

  The NASA personnel thought this was a great idea so they rustled up a
tape recorder.  After the man gave them his message they asked his son
to translate.  His son would not.

  Later, they tried a few more people on the reservation to translate
and every person they asked would chuckle and then refuse to translate.
 Finally, with cash in hand someone translated the message, "Watch out
for these guys, they come to take your land."

for Akitoshi Nagahata & Others:

Pierre [Joris] spoke a little too quickly & too ellipitcally about the titling
of the Japanese section in Volume 2 of Poems for the Millennium.  The full
designation is POSTWAR JAPANESE POETRY, the subtitle (kind of) THE ARECHI &
AFTER.  Some of the distinctions mentioned in your letter are made clear, I
think, in intro to that section, altho ( maybe) too much focus on that
grouping even so.  Seven poets appear in this section and three others (I
think three others) elsewhere in the volume -- more possibly than any national
grouping except U.S. (altho page counts are not the most reliable measure of
what we're after).

Anyway if anyone wants more info, etc. the back channel remains open.

As I was reading the mail on poetry&music, I was listening to a double-cd
release of Wilhelm Killmayer's settings of Holderlin poems. Also, there's
at least half a dozen contemporary composers who have set Paul Celan
poems to music -- don't have the info handy, but if you check the on-line
worldcat, you'll find the references.

& then of course, there's John Cage & his use of words-in-music.

ps. Glad Jerry came in on the Arechi section -- . Our presentation of
Japanese poetry is indeed wider than my post suggested -- the section in
question being called "The Arechi _and after_"

Hi--I'm new to this list.  This music discussion makes me wonder
about translation.  Does de-contextualizing a linguistic text by
setting it to music translate that text?  Jakobson has written
about "intersemiotic translation"--the interpretation of signs
from one semiotic system by another--for example, language "translated"
into pictures or music.  Setting a poem to music is
an interprative act, a translation which foregrounds loss,
expenditure...

On Michael Nyman's "Songbook," Ute Lemper sings poems by Celan,
Shakespeare, Rimbaud, Mozart.  The english translation of Mozart (taken
from a letter) is not at all typical of 18th century writing--more like a
prose-lyric attempt to depict a "natural" speaking voice.  The Rimbaud
translations make me want to dance the can-can

that's "I Zimbra" from FEAR OF MUSIC...back when they were still odd & good.

another curiousity is Syd Barrett's "Golden Hair" (on one of the two
canonical solo albums, BARRETT I think but maybe THE MADCAP LAUGHS), a
setting of one of James Joyce's poems...strangely compelling.

And for trivia lovers, the ending of ABBEY ROAD by you-know-who features
Paul M.'s attempt to set an Elizabethan lyric ("Golden slumbers," etc.). It
did at least produce a small gasp when I ran across the poem in a
collection some years back.

    Yes, David G., Syd Barrett!
    And Ron S., for Motown.
    Ever hear or see that Motownesque version of Yeats'
    "Turning and turning in a whirling gyre"
    Imagine the four tops, but with Eddie Kendricks rather than Levi Stubbs
    on lead vocals. I forget who did it.
    But, taking in (?????---the guy from London, Ontario)'s remarks
    to account, about translation--
    I'm curious Ron S. WHY in your opinion Reich would be alien to the
    spirit of the WCW poem????
    Implied question: WHAT kind of music would be in the proper spirit of
    the poem?
    I saw a version of !2th Night's Feste Song (the one with "jounrey end
    with lover's meeting) done a la Tom Waits once, it didn't seem exceedingly
    NOT in the spirit....
    then of course there's Alan Golding's forthcoming album--
    "Emily Dickinson poems to the tune of "Heartbreak Hotel"--
    Irene Alebi (sic?)
    My own version of Brecht's "Orge's Song" from BAAL
    and, in reverse, Sebastion Cabot ACTOR does DRAMATIC READING of
    BOB DYLAN (poet)......
    I'm sure there's more
    (though not by the gang of four--
    though there's that great version of THE COMMUNIST MANIFESTO on the
    National Lampoon Lemnings album....
    (Papa was a running lackey of the bourgeois---by THE MOTOWN MANIFESTOES)..

Hi Charles.  A) I think actually it was Eryque Gleason who was talking
about having liberated Pat Reed's book from the cardboard box at IIT.  So
you might ask him.  B) Pat Reed has a new book out that just appeared
yesterday, called "We Want to See your Tears Falling Down" (San Francisco:
Literatura de Cordel, 1996).  You will certainly enjoy it if you're a Reed
fan.  You might also check out the most recent issue of BLOO (Chicago),
which features a large number of her new poems.

"Literatura de Cordel" is I think Eileen Corder's new bookmaking project,
chapbooks of innovative writing by women, very handsome books, I've seen
one other, called "Not of this World" by Bettina Rotenberg.  Go Eileen!

Charles, 'twas i that posted about _tangle blue_.  it's not particularly

the bottom of the last page
"-Trinity Alps, Fall '93"  i dunno if Trinity Alps is a publisher or where
it was written or what, mebbe someone else out there knows?

this is a beautiful little chapbook, 9x5 or something like that, obviously
handmade. the cover is green construction paper with read thread for the
binding.  i have no idea where to get a copy as i stole mine.

the most recent thing that i know of hers is a prose piece (an excerpt i
believe) published in _bloo3_ last spring entitled "We Want to see Your
Tears Falling Down."  Someone did enquire about copyrights as they wanted
to republish the piece, but i don't know who.  it may be possible for me to
figure that out in the near future, however.  If you'd like a copy of
_bloo3_ lemme know, I stole some copies of that before i left chicago too.
i'd be more than happy to trade.

gosh... there's SO much!!!  where to begin?

poets doing their own stuff include Joy Harjo & her band, Jackson MacLow's

Music-New Poetry," & once again let me mention Nathaniel Mackey's excellent
cd, "Strick."  Or any of Linton Kwesi Johnson's recordings.

Steve Lacy has a number of things out: "Momentum" w/ Irene Aebi sets a Brion
Gysin poem & Melville's "Art."  Steve Swallow's "Home" has Sheila Jordan
doing Creeley.  I've always had a fondness for Marion Brown's "Sweet Earth
Flying" which works out of Jean Toomer.

An old Nonesuch recording, "Spectrum: New American Music Vol 4" has George
Rochberg setting Blake, &  Jeff Jones setting Samuel Beckett.  A recent
release from New Albion by Ensemble Pan has some interesting things by Robert
Kyr using texts by Jean Joubert, Rimbaud, Borges, Apollinaire & Rumi among
others.  EP has a number of excellent recordings of medieval texts set to
music.  That field is enormous.  Lots of troubadour recordings & other
medieval poems sre readily available.  Lots of renaissance material: Campion
for example, or Robert Johnson's settings of Shakespeare, Beaumont &
Fletcher, & Ben Johnson.  Schubert's many settings of German poems, including
Goethe, who disliked what he thought were the excessive results.  Burns' work
with the border ballads & the whole survival of traditional ballads in the
contemporary folk scene--Jean Redpath!  Lou Harrison did some Whitman,
accompanied by a gamelan emsemble.  Richard Strauss set some Hesse poems.

and on & on...

pleasant hunting/listening!

In fact the _best_ Creeley settings to music is Steve Lacy's song-cycle
(20 Creeley poems) called _FUTURITIES_ (hat hut cd 6031). Lacy has in
fact set a number of poems by a great variety of poets to music -- rumor
credits him with close to a thousand compositions.

Donovan did a whole album of poems set to music.  I can't remember the name
of the album and it's long out of print and hasn't been reissued on CD, but
it includes Poe's "Eldorado" and poems by Yeats and Lorca.  You could check
out the discography at the Donovan WWW site if you're in need of a title.
Donovan also does a tune called "Under The Greenwood Tree" with lyrics by
Shakespeare on the _Gift From a Flower to a Garden_ Lp.

A group called The Story set two E.E. Cummings poems to music, "damn
everything but the circus" and "love is more thicker than forget" on their
album _Grace and Gravity_

How about The Velvet Underground's "Delmore Schwartz" from the _...and Nico_
album?

Iron Maiden did a hatchet job on Coleridge's "Kublai Kahn."

The Fugs' first album contains versions of works written by William Blake
and A.C. Swinburne.

Ginsburg's been known to accompany himself at readings, and there's a
compilation album put out by _The Birth of Tragedy_ magazine called _Fear,
Power, God_ that has a couple of cuts by Allen with instrumentation, as well
as a sermon by Anton Lavey (of the Church of Satan) where the music swells
in the background as the sermon climaxes (Satanism doesn't get any more
amusing than this, lemme tell ya).

Michael McClure has been collaborating for some years with Ray Manzarek of
The Doors on piano.  Don't know if there's any recordings about by them, but
you'd think there would be.

David Meltzer and Clark Coolidge had a band in the 60's called The Serpent
Power that released at least two albums that I'm aware of.  They recently
toured again as MIX, but that project is on hold due to the death last
summer of MIX's third member, David's wife Tina.

Then there's all kinds of name-dropping we could discuss (Dickinson and
Frost in Simon & Garfunkel's "The Dangling Conversation," or Keats and Yeats
in The Smiths' "Cemetary Gates".)

Patti Smith?  Jim Carroll?  Bob Dylan?  Jim Morrison?  Joni Mitchell?  John
Lennon?  Lou Reed?  Dylan?  Nick Drake?  Michael Stipe?  The Last Poets (or
Gil-Scott Heron or any of their descendants in the hip-hop nation like
Michael Franti, currently of Spearhead)?  Ends up depending on where you
want to draw the line (IF you do) between a poet and a lyricist.  And it
might be pointed out that they didn't use to.

In Australia Robyn Archer released a album in the 70's called THE WILD GIRL
IN THE HEART in which she put to music poems by contemporary Australian
poets. The album was banned by a number of recored shops as it contained a
poem by Rae Desmond Jones called 'The deadshits'. As a result the album
gained some free publicity and sold many more copies trhan it would have
otherwise.

Robyn Archer is now, I believe, the director of the Adelaide Festival.

A little context for Tuba City: when a sandstorm ate the solenoid out
of my $50 Fiat back in the '70's, I ended up stranded there  &
slept in the back while a Chicago-born jd infomed me endlessly
through the vent that he hadn't seen a white chick in years.
Three of the four corners there were truckstops.  The fourth was the
Navajo Tribal Council. I was a poet/astronomy student then, and despite
the fact that I was an anglo (well, celt) female, I spent the 2 days
it took to get a solenoid from Flagstaff happily ensconced among Navajo
elders who watched the sky.  They were well informed about observations
at Kitt Peak, and I expect they're keeping abreast of the Hubble data.
If you lived under that sky, you would,
too.

Subject:      Poetry in Japan

I'm emerging from my long lurk to say thanks to the people who've been
addressing the issues of elistism and tradition in Japanese poetry.  These are
matters of particular interest to me and my translating partner, Toshi Ishihara
-- we've just produced a non-traditional edition and translation of the _Ogura
Hyakunin Issue_ , a card game of 100 poems.  It was a lark for us, since we
were both working out of our academic fields of expertise (mine in langpo,
Toshi's in Asian-American lit), and a rather Japanese thing to do, I suppose,
in that we assumed poetry is a game anyone can play. And play in any language.

The poems in this anthology are not "elite" now since everybody learns them in
high school and half the country plays the game at new year (well, more than
half the people I know).  It's my understanding that, from a literary point of
view, many of the poems are not particularly good or interesting, even in the
original Japanese.  Plenty of "stupid emperors" here.  However, the way
the poems have been used, and the way they've lasted, is -- IMHO -- very
interesting indeed.

Rampant amateurism.  In any case--

Not everybody likes the liberties we took with the tanka.  First of all, we
threw out the traditional 5 line form and used free verse couplets instead.
That's because when the poems are read aloud, for the purposes of the card game
, they're read with a big caesura about halfway through.  Then we printed the
poems on cards with only one line of the poem on each card.  You can match them
if you're a traitionalist, or you can combine them as you like for your own
amusement if you don't mind messing with the traditional forms.  Toshi tells me
some of her friends in Kobe and Osaka are having a good time with it, making up
poems of their own.  On the other hand,  my Japanese teacher here in the States
wants me to stick those poems together properly, and moreover, she wants them
presented side by side with the originals to compare...  No messing around with
the forms for her!

To further play with the form a bit, we backed each poem with a black and white
photograph (we are not photographers), many of them done with a close-up lens,
and none of Asian stuff.  All ordinary stuff from around here.  My favorite is
of peeling paint from our garage door.  It backs the last poem of the set:

Memory, almost more than I can bear:
Ferns drooping from the eaves, the palace stands.

Written by retired Emperor Juntoku.  Stupid or not, I don't know.

So far, reactions to the photos are mixed.  Some people hate their having been
cut in half.  Some hate that they're "abstract."  Our experimental artist
friends seem to like the photos, but many of my Japanese friends, like my
American friends, are puzzled by the pics, since they are not representing
stuff from the poems and "hard to understand."  We think they are appropriately
eccentric. They think we are.

I just checked out the E-text library and indeed, there's a really neat site
for Hyakunin Isshu.  That's http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/japanese/index.html

-- many many thanks for the reference. Tradional translations, non-traditional
medium.

It's interesting to see how for a poet like Toshi, the distinction between
traditional and experimental breaks down.  On the other hand, you need a
certain degree of sophistication to be able to play around with this kind of
material and not come out looking like a fool.

Best, Linda Reinfeld

PS

I'm sorry this posting is so long.   I'll put up our announcement of the HI
translation separately and later a note about the fate of our Berstein,
Silliman, Hejinian, and Howe translations into Japanese.

REALLY non-traditional stuff is not so welcomed by established contemporary
poetry magazine editors in Japan, so far as I can tell.

About 15 years ago Paige Mitchell played me tapes taken from NASA
'recordings' (I too enjoyed the Capricorn One scenario), of one of the
manned moon missions. What I remember most vividly is the level-headed,
specialist, observation of one of the crew as they approached the surface
site for module landing. The comments (his), ran along the lines of "Oh
man, just look at that rock down there!" to which NASA interjected the
useful commentary "that's the professional geologist talking".

not that it really matters, but I think it was actually "Rhyme of the Ancient
Mariner" that Iron Maiden "hatchets."  I'm not a fan of Iron Maiden or the
song, but I'm uncomfortable with these opinions of musicians getting the
"wrong" music for the poetry.  Aren't you assuming that the musician wants
the same thing you want (I'm not just talking about Iron Maiden any more, but
in that case at least a lot of people in black t-shirts listened to a poem
that their teachers couldn't make them read).  Aside from the paranthetical
though, setting music to poetry can have a lot of different reasons and has
its own genres to which the poetry is being transformed.

sorry, should have said this in the first post, but it just hit me.

The comment that a poem hadn't been set to music in the "spirit of the work"
(sorry I don't have a fancy-type e-mail reader, so I just have to call things
up from memory).

This idea of the spirit of the work bothers me.  What would good music in the
spirit of the work be?  I guess that is when you treat the music as a type of
semiotic translation as someone suggested, but that seems to be only one way
of doing things, and in my opinion an equivalent to a vanilla movie sound
track.  Music that doesn't follow the spirit of the work is more interesting
to me, as it is more likely to set the work of two _different_ artists into a
dialogue (but I'm into that collaborative/dialogue thing).  In such a case,
both artists can be appreciated as individuals equally if you open up your
ears to hearing the music next to the poem rather than behind it.

And you know, it bothers me when people don't like the movie version of the
book because it didn't follow the original.  "The Scarlet Letter" may have
been a bad movie (I actually don't know, haven't seen it), but I think the
charge that it is bad because it messed around with the plot, however much is
missing something.  Esp. in that movie where a disclaimer says that it
"liberally" interpreted the book or something like that.

You're right James, it was "Rime of the Ancient Mariner", not "Kublai Kahn".
And I think you might have read a little too much into my use of the word
"hatchet".  It was meant ironically, sorta "in the spirit of" the name of
the band, and with no intended value judgment.  I'm not a big fan of band or
song either, but not for any of the reasons you seem to be associating me
with.  I too believe that when you translate a work across media, you
effectively create something else and are not bound by any need to mimic the
"original" work, which you're really responding to rather than simply
"adapting" (though of course there's no reason you can't, in responding,
*pretend* that you're simply moving the work wholesale into another medium
with perfect correspondence between the two versions.)

I also forgot to mention Chris Funkhauser's wonderful _we magazine_ in my
previous post, several issues of which have been released on cassette and
CD, which does a great job of blending music and poetry in nearly every
conceivable way they can be blended.

And then there's also Ginsburg's appearance on The Clash's "Ghetto
Defendant", Steve Benson's work with Splatter Trio, blah, blah, blah...

The Mercury Rev/Creeley recording is called 'So There' and
was released on a disc called 'The Hum is Coming From Her'
(BBQ 5CD)...

Also: another Lacy recording of note is 'The Condor' (Soul
Note-1986) which features settings of poems by Kaufman,
Akhmatova, Beltrametti, and Balestrini. George Lewis' disc
'Changing With The Times' includes accomplished collaborations
with Jerome Rothenberg and Quincy Troupe (among others).
Actually, Troupe shows up on a Hamiet Bluiett recording
called Nali Kola (Soul Note-1989). Jayne Cortez and her
group The Firespitters have put out at least two recordings
I know of 'Unsubmissive Blues' (Bola Press-1980) and
'Poetry and Music' (Radio Bremen-1992). Fred Houn used a
Sonia Sanchez poem as part of his 'Tomorrow is Now' (Soul
Note-1985). Max Roach's 'It's Christmas Again' (Soul Note-
1994) is an extraordinary piece based on Bruce Wright's
work... And: Marilyn Crispell and The Splatter Trio have
both done 'interpretations' of Mackey's work...

There's countless others in this vein who've incorporated

knut hamsun?  he's terrific, esp. HUNGER, which i can't believe no one
(myself included, or excluded, depending on how one includes oneself in "no

hunger.  actually, HUNGER is the only hamsun i've ever read, and that was in
high school, but i adored it.  esp there's a scene when the narrator's in
jail, and he invents a word, and really trips out on it...i think (look, it's
been 25 years just about)...

YES, I HAVEN'T YET READ HUNGER, BUT I'VE HEARD THAT IT IS VERY SIMILAR TO
THE HOUSE OF THE DEAD BY DOSTOEVSKI. HOWEVER, I DON'T THINK I'LL MAKE IT
TO THE HOUSE OF THE DEAD, BECAUSE THE DOUBLE IS HIGHER ON MY LIST OF
PRIORITIES. RIGHT NOW I'M READING THE TOWN AND THE CITY, WHICH WAS OF
COURSE KEROUAC'S FIRST NOVEL, AND IT SHOULD BE DISCUSSED MORE, EVEN
THOUGH IT ISN'T AS CAPTIVATING AS SAY, MAGGIE CASSIDY OR DR. SAX, AND IT
SOUNDS LIKE IT'S TRYING TO SOUND LIKE THOMAS WOLFE, IT IS NONETHELESS A

POOR PEOPLE, WHICH WAS A WAILING FAILURE. HOWEVER, SURELY HIS ONLY FAILURE.
THANKS FOR THE INFO. ON THE JOURNAL, ALDON? IS THAT CORRECT?

James Perez,

In theory you're right of course. Two very different people could do a
lot by bringing different sensibilities to such a project. But Reich's
version of WCW is closer to a butchered translation. It's not akin to
the project of Charles Shere working with Carl Rakosi on that work.
Williams sensibility is much closer to the work, say, of a Satie or
even a Copland than the overwrought baroque feel that Reich has gotten
into in his post-minimalism phase. If ever there was a poem that did
NOT feel like a doilie, it's Desert Music. It's an act of appropriation
at its worst or, if you want to be charitable, Reich's a terribly
sloppy reader.

Actually, nobody's mentioned either Charles Bernstein's operas nor the
work that Virgin Thompson did with G. Stein. Do operas count?

Paul Mariah was indeed a powerful reader of his own poems. And he
did something in between the poems that I very much appreciated,
25 years ago: he talked (sometimes with apparent pain) about his
struggle to publish them in U.S. magazines. Since they were
admirable poems, and he had persisted to publication, he became a
model of useful stubbornness.

A brave and lovely guy. I found this in the SF Chronicle (Ron's
was much better):


                 The San Francisco Chronicle, JANUARY 25, 1996

HEADLINE:  Paul Mariah

BYLINE: Stephen Schwartz

 BODY:
    A memorial will be held next month for  Paul Mariah,  a pioneer of the gay
literary scene in San Francisco during the 1960s and 1970s.  Mr. Mariah died of
pneumonia January 12. He was 58.

   Mr. Mariah was born in Whittington, Ill. but long resided in the Bay Area.
He
had served time in prison before coming to San Francisco. In a 1977 newspaper
article, his prison experiences were cited as crucial to his personal and
literary development.

   He started Manroot Books and a literary magazine with the same title in 1969.
A dozen issues of the magazine appeared, along with 30 monographs. His
enterprise published many leading writers of the time, including notable
editions of such major poets as Jack Spicer, James Broughton, Robert Peters,
and Thom Gunn.

   Mr. Mariah also issued bilingual editions of Jean Cocteau and Jean Genet,
and revived interest in the work of Robert Ingersoll, the 19th century prison

reformer and social critic.

   His own poetry appeared in two collections, ''Personae Non Gratae'' in 1971
and ''This Light Will Spread'' in 1978.

   Mr. Mariah was also prominent in the movement for prisoners' rights.

   He is survived by his mother, Ada Jones; a brother, George W.  Jones; and a
sister, Mary Alice Sims, all of Benton, Ill.

   A memorial will be held at 3 p.m. February 11 at the Sonoma Community Center,
276 East Napa, Sonoma. Memorial contributions are requested for the San
Francisco Public Library.

The Steve Reich version of THE DESERT MUSIC doesn't, admittedly, sound
much the surface of the Williams poem, but there seems to me a way in
which it taps into some nervous energy within the poem.  That's the one
with the striptease in the bar, that ends with Williams' shouting "I am a poet!"

Williams mentions a breathtaking Casals performance, obviously
that is not the same music as Reich's, but equally, is it  Eric
Satie ambient  music?  Isn't there a little more tension in Williams
overall?  More like Ornette Coleman?

Stephen Cope's right, we (Spoken Engine) have just released our second CD,
Nathaniel Tarn's _I Think This May Be Eden_, with music composed by Billy Panda.
The selections cover most of Tarn's career -- from _The Beautiful
Contradictions_, _Lyrics For The Bride Of God_ (including a stunning rendition
of "Section: America (2): Seen As A Bird"), _Seeing America First_,and four
sections of _Architextures_.

This CD, as well as Nathaniel Mackey's _Strick_, is available for $14
(postage paid) from _Spoken Engine_, P.O. Box 771739, Memphis, TN 38177-1739 or
through Small Press Distribution.

And we are working on a CD with Maxine Hong Kingston. We've been trying to get
her to change her name to Nathaniel Hong Kingston for continuity's sake, but
she seems resistant for some reason.

Luigi or Stephen,

What's th' Mercury Rev album? an early work? God they're good.

Virgin Thompson (as he would have no doubt smiled to be called) also set a
number of poems by Kenneth Koch. Ned Rorem has set oodles of poems by John
Ashbery and Kenneth Koch. There was an evening at Alice Tully Hall a year
or so ago of eighteen composer's settings of a single John Ashbery poem.

On another tack, are they any good settings of music into petry we should
no about? (Sticky Fingers, Shelter from the Storm come to mind).

for what it may not be worth, reynold's book is good of its sort. it does
help recapture words sacred to whitman that have shifted their "meanings"
if not their sounds over time. but like such efforts generally, the book
sees poems as products of culture, time, personality, what-have-you. alas

One apparently major anomaly that ends up working great is The Fugs' "Dover
Beach" on their comeback double album from the late 70s/early 80s (don't
remember the title, but I have it at home if anyone wants). They also have a
wonderful song on that album that features Dickinson and Keats
free-wheel(chair)ing through the Golden Bards Retirement Home, with some
lovely renderings of snippets of ED ("Were I with thee / Wild nights would be
. . ." and others).

Subject:      Madge and Pandaemonium / beside reading

David Kellogg was asking about Pandaemonium. In fact it was written or
should I say compiled by Humphrey Jennings who I mentioned in Madge's wake.
Jennings together with Madge and Tom Harrison founded Mass Observation
together in 1937. Madge contributes an introduction to 'Pandaemonium'
(subtitled - the Coming of the Machine as seen by Contemporary Observers)
and himself worked on the manuscript, while the edition I have is edited by
Humphrey's daughter Mary-Lou (Macmillan, 1995).

It's an anthology edited from twelve books. Of the selection Jennings said
'The presence of Imagination is apprehended by the Imagination: therefore
the reasons for choice are not reasonable'. Materials are grouped under the
dates and titles:

1660 - 1729 : Observations and Reports
1730-1790: Exploitation
1791-1850: Revolution
1851-1886: Confusion

the Revolution section by far the fattest. It's worth seeking out.
Jennings worked on the manuscript between '37 and 1950 when he himself died.

It's hovering somewhere on a table which holds the back-burners for the
edge of my current bedside batch, along with  -

Blaise Cendrars 'Complete Poems' translated by Ron Padgett (University of
California, 1992)  -  terrific work and terrific translations

Keston Sutherland and Andrea Brady '20 Poems' (Barque, 1995)  -  two young
poets here who interest me

'o(rphan) d(rift)' (Cabinet Editions, 1995) -  over 400 pages of writings
from the eponymous collective (very interesting) 'orphan drift is
spreading, signal with no memory' , 'this is flatline country'   /  same
sort of territory as Collapse magazine

Allen Fisher 'Fish Jet' (Torque, 1995)  -  part of his current hot
deliveries from the ongoing 'gravity as a consequence of shape' as is the
smaller but no less notable ''Now's the Time' (from Books, 1995)

Walter Benjamin 'One Way Street and other writings' (Verso, 1985)  -  a
current fave crit theory dip along with

Bakhtin's soaring 'Rabelais and His World' (Midland, 1984)

Peter Burke's 'Popular Culture in Early Modern Europe' (Scolar, 1994)  -
an energising tandem with the Bakhtin

Charles Alexander's 'Hopeful Buildings' (Chax, 1990)  -  which I'm
reviewing and very much enjoying

a special issue of Parataxis given over to 'Original: Chinese
Language-Poetry Group (Parataxis, 1995)  -  Zhou Yaping has particularly
caught my eye

and Robert Smithson 'Le Paysage Entropique'  (an excellent and extensive
312 page catalogue from a retrospective at the Museum of Marseilles 1995)
-  I'm in a Smithson phase right now, somewhat later than many I know but
hit in deep at last, whereas an interest has been lurkng for years

well, that's what's by the bed. Can't imagine how I ever get the time to
sleep. But i still do yet

love and love

He was a sight to behold at that reading.  I remember how he had helpers
hand out ribbons to everyone in the audience, which we were to wave around
at the appropriate cue from Paul.  Everyone in the audience, from the
neo-beats to the experimental poets to the little kids, waved right on cue
with no embarrassment.  I'd never seen him before, so I didn't have any way
of comparing, but I did think he looked pretty frail.  But I'll never forget
his performance that day.

I am said bloke, and yes, the various contributions have been a great
help.  I'm particularly interested in hunting down the recordings by Lacy
and Jarman.  CD's on Black Saint/hat Art/etc., however, seem pretty hard to
come by...

Another example I've remembered is The Dog Faced Hermans' song "Love is the
Heart of Everything" (Mayakovsky) on their live CD.  WHich reminds me:
I'm writing a thesis on Vladimir Mayakovsky and would love to hear from
any devotees of his work (directly to my email address so as not to
clutter the already busy discussion list).  I'm particularly interested
in comparing his poems written in Russia with those written in Paris and
America.

This is Ted Berrigan speaking, to Kevin Killian I think, from his review
of LUNCH POEMS in KULCHUR (spring 65)(season I first made the infancy
scene).  Berrigan speculates what would happen if he could lean into a TV
camera and "say intensely, 'If you people really want to know what it's
all about, read Frank O'Hara, that's right, FRANK O'HARA.'" Among other
immediate responses would be "Joe Levine's new movie 'LIFE ON EARTH,' the
biography of Frank OHara:
        ...starring James Cagney as Frank (an interesting technical
        problem to be solved here), and Gig Young as John Ashbery,
        Rod Steiger as James Schuyler, Fred MacMurray as Kenneth Koch,
        with Eve Arden as Jane Freilicher. What excitement!"
-------------

I suppose "life on earth" (as Seasons on Earth) implies life elsewhere...
hence segue to Kerouac's deployment of the 'space-race' trope (in "The
First Word: JK Takes a Fresh Look at JK"):

        "...spontaneous, or ad lib, artistic writing imitates as best it
can the flow of the mind as it moves in its space-time continuum, in this
sense it may really be called Space Age Prose someday because when
astronauts are flowing through space and time they too have no chance to
stop and reconsider and go back.  It may be they won't be reading
anything else but spontaneous writing when they do get out there, the
science of the language to fit their science of movement."
-----------

Thanks Maria re: Hamsun:  just to square the circle, I read about
Hamsun's HUNGER book in these essays by Kerouac.

So now y'all know what I'm reading, except add:
1) POLITICS & POETIC FORM
2) all the PARIS REVIEW interviews from the 50's and 60's in a stupid
underbed xerox heap
3) COLLECTED WILLIAMS (teaching parts of it Thursday) and
4) The SCUM Manifesto by Valerie Solanas-- 'cause the documentary on her
at Sundance ("I Shot Andy Warhol") was so great...  Lili Taylor is
miraculous.  Donovan plays the part of Gerard Malanga, which is amusing.
5) the TALISMAN interviews (interesting paired w/1&2)
6) Julien Levy's SURREALISM (reprinted:  Loy was Paris representative for
her son-in-law's gallery &thus brought Surrealism overseas in a material way)
and finally
7) a new Fluxus book (Thames/Hudson). Dumb book, but great pics of Dick
Higgins, one of which I happily put up in my office at the English Dept.
(hardly knew you, DH!)

All the best/s everyone--

Marisa,

I'm so jealous of you for having seen this movie!  A couple of years ago in
Seattle KK and I went out for a drink with the writer/director, Mary
Harron--when she was still researching Solanas' life.  Needless to say, she
kept us captivated with tales.

Here's (lots) more music & poetry:

Some of Pauline Oliveros's early works were settings of Charles Olson
pieces and Janice Giteck set several of Louis Zukofsky poems early on.  (&
don't forget Celia Zukofsky's own settings of LZ in "Autobiography.")

Joan La Barbara's great collaboration with Kenny Goldsmith, 73 Poems.

Many Amiri Baraka (& a few Leroi Jones) performances & recordings with
musicians like David Murray, Arthur Blythe, Archie Shepp & John Tchicai.

Alvin Curran's ongoing collaborations (since high school) with Clark Coolidge.

Morton Feldman's gorgeous hour-long piece, 3 Voices, based on two and a
half lines by Frank O'Hara, & Feldman's opera Neither based on a page-long
text written specifically for the project by Samuel Beckett.

Lee Hyla's setting of Howl for the Kronos Quartet & Ginsberg (I'm not sure
if this has premiered yet).

And don't forget Robert Ashley's operas which are all great with very good
funny texts by the composer.

& Peter Kotik's settings of texts by Gertrude Stein and Buckminster Fuller.

Paul Epstein's set of songs on Toby Olson poems.

The very different versions of Tom Phillips Irma (drawn from his Humument)
by Gavin Bryars & the group AMM.

Eliane Radigue's settings of poems by Milarepa.

As long as people are digging back for esoteric rock settings of poetry,
Insect Trust did a song with words from Thomas Pynchon's V (Eyes of a New
York Woman).

& one of the CDs I'm producing for fall 96 release documents songs for
voice & piano commissioned from eleven American composers.  Each composer
picked their own source & the texts vary widely including: Susan Stenger
(flutist who often worked with Cage, Kotik, Mac Low, & Niblock, now better
known, perhaps, as the bassist of Band of Susans) setting Mac Low's
Traitorous Heart; Maggi Payne's first non-electronic works in years,
settings of two Gary Snyder poems; John Luther Adams set a couple of Inuit
texts; Thomas Peterson set Cannon Beach by Nelson Bentley; Peter Garland
wrote music for a Chinese drinking song translated by Arthur Sze, etc.  I
guess I don't have the whole list with me, besides it's too early for the
hard sell.  For now, just note that this (the book of scores that will
eventually be published) is likely to be the only collection to contain
both Jackson Mac Low & Nelson Bentley.

To close on a more self-deprecatory revelation, the last band-like
aggregation I was in was going to be called Roast Potatoes 4.  I'm happy to
say that I am saved from considerable embarrassment 'cause the rehearsal
process killed the band before we ever played out.

A few more that come to mind:

Carla Bley's setting of Paul Haines's "Escalator Over the Hill".
THere was also a double-disc recently (a Kip Hanrahan project?) of
lots of other Haines settings.

Terry Riley set some Kerouac for chorus.

Dominic Muldowney (I think) did a version of Brecht's "Baal" that
David Bowie recorded.

On another note: Like others here, I strongly disliked Reich's "The
Desert Music". I dislike most choral music anyway -- it seems to me
that if one is setting a text because one likes either the sound or
the meaning or the sound of the words, the words should be
intelligible. Most choirs turn text into mud, and the composer has to
deal with this. This happened with "The Desert Music", and was
frustrating. OTOH, this has happened with most of the Reich that I've
heard performed by conventional ensembles (orchestras, string
quartets, etc).

But I *love* the recording of his "The Cave" that just came out,
perhaps because it didn't sound like the music was battling the
words.

I don't know if this is what you've heard about, but I've seen (& not
heard) a recent CD by Henri Chopin at Wall of Sound here in Seattle.

I can find out more about it if someone's interested.

I don't know whether the Jarman recording referred to is still
available, but Black Saint (and sister label Soul Note) are both
available via Sphere in NYC. The address:

   Sphere Marketing and Distribution
   JFK Airport Building 80-Room 2A
   Jamaica, New York 11430
   Ph: (718) 656-6220  Fax: (718) 244-1804

The catalog is immense and they still carry a number of titles
on vinyl (both those already released on cd and those not yet
or never to be released on cd) for $4.00 each (last time I
checked). Hat Art stuff can be ordered through either Tower
or Cadence...

Incidently, Jarman has recorded his own poem "Non-Cognitive
Aspects of the City," which can be found on 'Song For' (Delmark-
1991, CD). Not the best cut on the disc but certainly worth
a listen...

a little bit of interesting trivia I heard somewhere sometime (and I don't

"A small step for man, ..."
was actually said

"A small step for _a_ man, ..."
but radio transmission wasn't so clean back in the day and the "a" was lost
(voice activated mikes, and speaker phones for that matter, tend to lose
short words),  very different in spirit, and at least a little interesting.

Chris Strof--I beg to differ re: Sanders' 80s revival of Fugs--far from
disappointing, the 80s Sanders has been, for me, like a breath of fresh heaven.
I recommend very much The Fugs "No More Slavery" album.

Hey, in general, not enough women mentioned in all this musical extravaganza--

Like Julie Kabat's musical renditions of H.D.  Kabat is a wonderful
performance artist who plays glass harmonica, sings, and collaborates with
computer sounds--Hear her "Child and the Moon-Tree" on CDCM Computer Music
Series, V. 7 put out by Centaur records.

Or how about the sweet sounds of Lee Ann Brown and Nancy Dunlop singing Emily
Dickinson and William Blake respectively on the Little Mag CD-ROM.

Or for sheer evocation if not verbiage--Marilyn Crispell

Anne Waldman's perf-pieces, i.e., "Uh-Oh Plutonium"

Katie Yates' "Is it Happening"

H.D.'s poetry has been set to music by composers Thomas Eastwood and Jonathan
Elkus--the scores are available, but I don't know about any recordings.

Langston Hughes' "The Weary Blues" reissued on cd by Verve, and the other is
Kenneth Rexroth's "A Sword in a Cloud of Light" available from Watershed

Brown where he is accompanied by music on at least one poem.
Very nice listening.

dear poetics,
   as always, digging discussion and referencing of sound and word
combinations (recombinations).  (since i began formally playing music the
same year as writing my first poem -- a 4th grade (1975) spoof on "God Bless
America" called "God Damned America" -- the 2 have always been closely
linked in my mind and fingers).  They are!
   didn't we have some talk on a similar topic last year? maybe we can put
up an FAQ, or EPC site related to the subject?
   Firstly, I wanted to recommend the new AUTONOMEDIA title, _Sounding Off!
Music as Subversion/Resistance/Revolution_, edited by R. Sakolsky & Fred Wei-
Han Ho.  It's a great collection, complete w/compact disc.  Essays by Hakim
Bey, Liz Was, Chris Cutler, Negativland, and many others.  Lyrical writing by
a powerful poet named Kalamu ya Salaam; also, Benjamin Zephanian, Jean
Binta Breeze, Darryl Cherney, and Tuli Kupferberg. Well worth the 15 bucks...
   A disorganized mess of names/projects I've been jotting down the
past day or so, & hopefully without repeating too much, here goes a listing of
a few sound/work projects I remember tuning into over the past few years:

        -Francisco Alarcon & the Santa Cruz Rhythmagics:  work may be found
on We Magazine Issue 14 cd, as well as this interesting cassette release
AMERICA FEARS THE DRUM/Rebel Poets II, which also features poets
Boadiba, Kalamu Ya Salaam, Gina Pacaldo, Genny Lim, q.r. hand, Daniel
Higgins, Elizabeth McKim, Devorah Major & Opal Palmer Adisa, Alfonso
Texidor, Etheridge Knight, Vernon Edgar, Jorge Argueta, Benjamin Zephanian,
Nilak Butler, Tede Matthews, peter plate, Jack Hirschman & the Crack Emcee
(mostly accompanied by music of one form or another). I understand
Alarcon's group is going to release its 1st solo album soon.
        -Lee Ann Brown's settings of Emily Dickinson's poetry (available on
bootleg tapes, The Little Magazine cd-rom, & We Magazine XV (cassette).
        -Michael Franti's work with the Beatnigs & Disposable Heroes of
Hiphoprisy.  (Where is the cultural studies essay comparing Vachel Lindsay
& Franti?)
        -Jerome Rothenberg's collaborations with Bertram Turetsky. (Jerry:
are these available anywhere?)
        -Sun Ra was one of the most prodigious poet/musicians of the century,
with several hundred poems (many collected in the evolving collection THE
IMMEASURABLE EQUATION), as well as some 250 recordings with & without
the Arkestra.  I have a wicked tape of the Arkestra accompanying LeRoi
Jones' dramatic work A BLACK MASS.  Also, recording of David Henderson
accompanied the Arkestra with his poem "Love In Outerspace" (see
HAMBONE 12).
        -Langston Hughes recorded parts of WEARY BLUES w/Mingus. It's out
on cd now. I believe Hirschman performed with Mingus as well.
        -Has anyone mentioned John Cage's ROARATORIO by name? Wow. I
also seem to remember reading about Creeley/Cage collaborations in Henry
Sayre's informative book THE OBJECT OF PERFORMANCE.
        -Captain Beefheart's TROUT MASK REPLICA (proto language poetry?)
        -recordings in the 70s & 80s by Chuck Stein & George Quasha, Bob
Cobbing, Coaccidents, Four Horsemen.
        -Michael Smith, Jamaican dub poet, brutally murdered, had an album
out on Island records MI CYANN BELIEVE IT (also, with the group Light of
Saba a record called WORD SOUND released in the caribbean).
        -William S. Burroughs / Kurt Cobain
        -Theresa Clark & Carletta Wilson, IN HERE BY TURNS, Thunderhoney
Productions, late '80s.
        -Poetry In Motion video/cd-rom
        -Ginsberg's records HYDROGEN JUKEBOX (with Phillip Glass, has a
beautiful tuning of Wichita Vortex Sutra), THE LION FOR REAL (made with
many of NYC's hippest hipsters), & a record he did a ways back, tuning Blake,
SONGS OF INNOCENCE & EXPERIENCE, with Don Cherry, Peter Orlovsky, David
Amran, Steven Taylor),  & FIRST BLUES. The Rhino 4 cd-set HOLY SOUL
JELLY ROLL chronicles collaborations w/Elvin Jones, Dylan, e t c .
        -Ira Cohen has a cd out on SubRosa, mixing samples from Don Cherry
& other sound sources as sonic backdrop.  At SFSU you could find a tape of
Don Cherry improvisationally accompanying Nate Mackey as well.
        -I've always thought of Bob Marley's work to be amongst the most
successful poetry of the 20th century in that he was able to engage
lyric/language, pulse/rhythm, spirit, life, all of it, in a way which
brought vastly disparate groups of people together in various settings
around the globe.  His transcription of a Haile Sellasie speech into the song
"War" is an effective example of how it can be done, directly & with political
agenda (if only someone could do the same for, say, "The Artifice of
Absorption" we might be on our way to the dawning of a new era!).
        -Aren't Charles Bernstein's collaborations with Ben Yarmolinsky
technically considered Librettos? Charles? Yarmolinksky's setting of a Ray
DiPalma poem appears on the little magazine cd-rom.
        -Victor Hernandez Cruz has recorded at least one, or two, hot
albums with the percussionist Ray Baretto.
        -South African horn player Johnny Dyani often works in language and
chanting into his work with potent effect.  Check out WITCHDOCTOR'S SON.
        -Archie Shepp, Cecil Taylor (especially DOUBLE HOLY HOUSE and
CHINAMPAS; Cecil discusses his relationship with poetry in an interview in
HAMBONE 12), as well as Don Cherry, Coltrane, Art Ensemble of Chicago are
amongst the jazz crowd of poet/musicians.
        -Ann Magnuson, The Tinklers, Jim Carroll.  The a capella thrash
quintet Bloodtest I believe has a piece titled "Mina Loy".
        -Anne Waldman with dozens of accompanists on various tapes and
cds.  In general, the poetics spirit at Naropa Institute promotes
interdisciplinary collaborations.  Singing.
        -Jimi Hendrix BLUES album, where he covers Muddy Waters, Booker T.
Jones, others.
        -Joanne Kyger/Arthur Okamura collaboration can be heard on We
Magazine Issue 10 (cassette).
        -Ed Sanders has tuned quite a bit, if not all, of MAXIMUS.
        -A tape of Garcia Lorca playing piano for the spanish vocalist La
Argentinita (from COLLECTION DE CANTARES POPULARES ESPANOLAS).
        -Katie Yates' work with thelemonade.  thelemonade also set writing by
Yeats, H.D. Moe, Eric Curkendall, Francisco Alarcon, Andy Clausen, Richard
Loranger, and Tory Miller to music.
        -the Monks of Doom composed a mini-rock opera around Edward
Gorey's "The Insect God" (C/Z records).

Don't forget or miss Reynaldo Hahn's settings of, particularly, Verlaine.
They make Verlaine appear to be a greater poet than we may have thought
he was. Compare, for ex, Faure and Hahn's settings of the same poem,
"L'heure Exquise." Hahn is alive to the text. He's knows how to listen to
the words - which ability to listen shouldn't be a surprise, since he was
Proust's boyfriend!

Are you referring to an LP I've never seen or heard of by that name, or the

Steve,

Sobin is reading at UC Berkeley's Maude Fife Room tonight, Tuesday 1/30 at 8

to make the trip.

He gave a great reading at Stanford last Thursday.  Read for a good hour from
both _Breath's Burials_ & _Voyaging Portraits_.

It's a shame someone of his stature can come to the Bay Area & not have more
readings thru the established channels outside of academia... & that, as you
mentioned, the ones he DOES have aren't even publicized.

The 5-part TV series I produced for PBS begins broadcasts on Feb 1 on Channel

Other cities: LA daily Feb 12-15 @ 10pm, then all 5 on Feb 17, 9pm. (2 1/2
hrs straight poetry, as if po could ever be!)

Philly & SF will also "stack" (all five shows in a row) on Leap Year Day.

Buffalo: WNEQ shows an hour on Feb 14 at 9, then begins weekly on Feb, 28 at
9:30.

It was I. I wrote that Charles Shere was composing a setting for it, an

Subject:      "America, I'm sentimental about the Wobblies"

In a post a few weeks back after I asked Dick Higgins why he believed
unemployment would soon approach the incredible number of 40% I ended by asking
all Poetics list members if the Wobblies (nickname of the Industrial Workers of
the World, or the I.W.W.) had been active or heard from in their area. A few
people sent separate e-mails giving information or asking what Wobblies were.
I'm not sentimental about the Wobblies, but I am excited about them. This post
is a follow up to my question.

The I.W.W. was an industrial union founded in 1905 with the goal of abolishing
the wage system.  Bill Haywood, Mother Jones, and Eugene Debs were among the
founders. One of the union's premises was (and is) that the "working class and
the employing class have nothing in common."

The I.W.W. thrived for a period and won great strikes- the Lawrence Strike of
1912, Paterson in 1913 and various battles for free speech across the country.
They also promoted the equality of race and gender within the union. But, as
Elizabeth Gurley Flynn remarked in her memoirs, the Wobblies were not as adept
at leaving stable union structures behind in the wake of their agitating and
organizing.

The I.W.W. was loudly opposed to World War I. Haywood said in his
autobiography, "The press and politicians were telling people that it was a
'war to make the world safe for democracy'. . . It was a 'war to end war,' but
the Wall Street birds of prey had hatched out a big flock of war millionaires,
who are preparing for another war."

(It's amazing how well that reads some 70 years later. It's amazing how
pertinent the majority of insights about the structure of American society made
by Wobbly leaders still read at the end of the century. If you ever come across
in a used bookstore Haywood's AUTOBIO. or Gurley Flynn's I SPEAK MY OWN PIECE,
grab it!)

The suspension of civil rights that accompanied the war, the "red scare," and
the magnanimous open-mindedness for which small-town America is renowned left
no small amount of Wobbly leadership and membership dead, incarcerated or in
exile in the years following 'the Great War.'

Now I hear that the Wobblies are not only active and growing but that they've
never completely gone away. Twice during a single day I heard that Judy Bari
and the Earth First organization in California are I.W.W. (and that someone
tried to blow them up!) One source was Poetics' own Gab in Hawaii, and the
other a Spoken Word recording made by Jello Biafra.  The I.W.W. has a Web page
(http://iww.org) where I downloaded their preamble and constitution and a
hypertext pamphlet called "Tactics and Vision for a New Worker Movement." An
address on their newspaper lists headquarters in Ypsilanti, MI (next to the
Sulfur offices?)

I live in Boston and recently discovered that Wobblies meet once a month at the
Lucy Parsons Center in Cambridge. I picked up their paper there (INDUSTRIAL
WORKER [online edition: http://iww.org/~iw/]) and found it informative on
international labor issues, engaging, optimistic  and strikingly free of
militant jargon and propaganda.

I'm excited about the Wobblies because of the gross irony that exists in light
of their original intentions. Instead of an international force of people
striving together to live, work and eat decently, an international corporate
force strives (and largely succeeds) to prevent that from happening. Because
they're malevolent and mean? Maybe. But mostly because it cuts their profits.

Philadelphia's CITY PAPER ran an article on Wobbly activity in North Philly.
It's online but I don't have the address.

So what has anyone heard?

Gerrit Lansing told me this was by far the best book on Whitman so I
scurried out to get it, but I have to disagree with GL (on this one point).
I agree with Ed Foster (again, on just this one point) and, I think it was
Geoffrey O'Brien in the NY Review of Books that Reynolds' book is
fascinating and rich with cultural studies type pop ephemera but doesn't
answer the question about how it came about that everyone who saw the same
operas, perused the same body-building and evangelical tracts, went to the
same bars, etc., etc., as Whitman didn't write Leaves of Grass.

Whitman also taught school in Smithtown (the tar and feathering I think
happened in Southold), and in Smithtown his little one room school house is
still preserved, right on Route 25A, thanks to the town fathers of the
1940s (actually a group of heroic minded town mothers).  I'm from Smithtown
and it is our biggest claim to fame, except that Leo G. Carroll ("Topper")
lived there.  And also it is the setting for the novel, "A Nest of
Ninnies," by Ashbery and Schuyler, who passed through it once on a train.
(In memory of this occasion, the poets who distributed Schuyler's ashes
threw some of them out of the train as it passed through Smithtown several
years ago.)  Anyhow when I was young a boy from school-Brian Mulhern-and I
broke into Whitman's school house and committed sodomy there in his honor.
Kind of eerie but way fun.  I'm sure others have similar anecdotes.

Dear Nicole Hoelle:

How new? For Fanny Howe there's been two new poetry books since Sun & Moon
Press's novel, SAVING HISTORY. O'CLOCK (from Reality Street editions in
England) was published this past year; and the QUIETEST was published in
1992 by O Books. SAVING HISTORY was published by Sun & Moon in 1993. Later
this year we plan to publish three revised novels-- which Fanny sees as a
trilogy--BRONTE WILDE, FIRST MARRIAGE, and FAMOUS QUESTIONS as in one
volume to be called RADICAL LOVE.

For more information you can contact me at djmess@cinenet.net or take a

I'll be announcing on Poetics List.

For anyone in the Bay Area who would like to attend &/or use it as an
occasion for getting together, I'll be doing a reading & book signing
for POEMS FOR THE MILLENNIUM at Black Oak Books in Berkeley: Monday
February 5 at 7:30.  I'll do some of my own but mostly get into a
performance of fabled others -- including a new performance version of
the presto section of Schwitters' Ur Sonata -- as those turn up in
the book co-edited with Pierre Joris.

There will also be an interview on KQED that morning at 9:30 and a
Jack Foley interview on KPFA sometime later along.

    Dear Steven Howard Shoemaker--here's an EVEN WORSE "poem"---

    that Maria's BILL BIXBY reference reminded me of:

    "Both my curiosity and fear about the "real you"
    have pricked up their ears. They ARE ears.
    The ambassadors between them, moving faster
    than waves between Uncle Martin's antennae,
    are hungry for more footage. They know
    they must recede back into the scalp,
    stick their heads in the sand, for you and I
    to meet again. But together they know
    at least one of them will be rewarded
    and so give up fighting to unite against
    "some other guy" for you.

Kerouac reading his Haikus accompanied by Zoot Sims.

Also Anne Sexton's poem "The Funeral" (?) was put to music, though I

Part of "Song of Myself" was set to music though I wouldn't reccomend it.

Then, there's Salome, by Oscar Wilde which was operaized by Strauss.

        Walter's the editor of Kaya Press. He's just published an anthology
of Asian-American writing called (I think) _Transformations_. Maria will
probably be talking about Gertrude Stein, Allen Ginsberg & Lenny Bruce (not
to lock you into anything, Maria!), but if she wants to be post-literate
too, that's fine with me.. you should check out the lines she's been adding
to the rengas lately, Chris.
        Simon Pettet's _Selected Poems_ just came out from Talisman House,
Publishers. He's British, he lives in New York, he reads each of his poems
_twice_. Simon Perchik (I think that's the spelling) is someone else.
        As for phalloi etc, you're on your own, baby..

Dear poetic;

In an effort to assist the events coordinator of the new Barnes & Noble
(where are they NOT these days) at Union Square in New York City, I've been
requested to supply as many facts, names, and ideas from the poetry writen'
world as possible. I'm asking any and all small presses, poets, publishers
(chapbooks too!) to get in contact with me and let me know when and if you
will be in the New York area and if you are interested in reading at B & N,
possibly with whom, with any ideas you may have, time schedules, release
dates into the next year, other organizations you could band with to do
group readings, etc. In short, I need to know what resources you would be
able to bring to your book signing/reading/party event so that the B & N
events coordinator can slot the best possible dates and situations for all
concerned.

Also, this will enable you to have your book (a special chapbook section is
being considered at this time in this 4 storey store) enter into the barnes
and noble ordering system (even if it's been ordered by it already, it's a
good way to keep it in stock).

If any one has any questions, please don't hesitate to get in touch. Pass
the word, etc.

Maria,

I'm intrigued by the last part of your recent posting, "cd be utterly
transformative, what I like to call a 'post-literary poetry.'"  Could you
elaborate a little?  This idea comes up from time to time in various contexts,
mostly in application to electronic media, but it seems to me to have wider
implications, that is the potential to breach or dissolve category.
"Post-literary" also would seem to provoke a sense of hybrid form; at limit it
might suggest a poetry that would not be recognizable as poetry, one that would
be pulled at by other disciplines to the point of dissolving or breaking up, but
I don't know if this sort of scenario would apply to what you're talking about.

I also wrote a libretto for Dean Drummond, _Cafe Buffe_, and Dean is at work
on what will be a microtonal setting to be played by Newband on some of the
Harry Partch instruments of which is Dean is caretaker, among other
instruments.

But settings of poems is another matter altogether ...  Here is a list of

This is Dodie Bellamy speaking.

I just received a great book in the mail today from Goddesses We Ain't, a
San Francisco literary organization for which Small Press Traffic is the
fiscal sponsor.  Goddesses We Ain't focuses on teaching and promoting
writing of low-income, minority, and disabled women.  But their latest book
is an incredible piece of writing for its own sake.  It's Marsha Campbell's
_Reply of Our Lady Teresa to the Poet Crashaw on the Occasion of His
Having Written a Hymn for Her Sake a Few Years After Her Death_.  In her
surreal epic prose poem, Marsha really has the religion and eros thing
down--a brutal and beautiful book.  It deserves a wider, more sophisticated
audience than this packaging is likely to bring it.

I did get to see him.  He was wonderful--and there was hardly anyone there!
This could partially be chalked up to the lousy weather, of course, but
Sobin readings are so rare that there could have been far more people in
that audience had they only heard about it.  Michael McClure and Michael
Palmer (who intro'd Sobin) are two of his oldest friends and THEY were
seeing him read for the first time.

No--and I can't BELIEVE it slipped my mind.  This is my favorite Kerouac
material.  That's not only Zoot, but also Al Cohn (they alternate riffs
between haikus).  An excellent hybrid.

Yes, and I can't believe I forgot that Al Cohn is on there--and we
mustn't forget good old Steve Allen on the "Last Word" and "Steve Allen"
tapes. I'm hitting the titles a little roughly, but my favorite of course
is the one that ends: "the moon is a piece of tea, beneath the sky,
verterbrate zoology," and of course "The History of Bop," "San Francisco
Blues," "The Moon,"...."an imaginary orange ball manifesting many
gentlemanly remarks/She kicks a star/Clouds foregather/in scimitar
shape...." and description upon explosive description, finally coming to
the wonderful conclusion: "....in any case the moon." I once owned the
written, printed version, in "Pomes All Sizes," but it was stolen, as
many of my books seem to have been over the years.....NICOLE HOELLE
