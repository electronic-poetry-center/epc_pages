I must say he's provided this and other poetry for an anthology of

published in book form and interactively on the World Wide Web, he ain't

May I start controversy?
I'm bored because I work for a living.
Yes, in medieval Christian Europe
painters were more in touch with their bodies
and with the physical nature of the universe
than we are in this fallen
fly-by-night mechanical reality.
They were able to achieve this state
at least partly because of their
secure position within feudal society,
which admired care
more than we do now.
Perhaps a return
to a rural paradise of the sort
posited by Johnathan Swift, A. Pope,
and more recently Allan Tate
and Robert Penn Warren
is called for.
We could slow down, we could really take care
with our materials again.
We could even have the plague again!--
talk about pure physicality.
Sometimes I wonder, though
whether our own current social state
emerges from the contradictions
of European history, even pre-machines,
rather than being a fall from it.
Maybe physicality was always a problem
and not a given.
Maybe objects don't completely last
anymore than they utterly disappear.
Maybe the middle ages was hell
for almost everybody.
But here I am, being interrupted again--
time to go back to work.
I wanted to make my satire jovial,
hope it will be taken in that spirit
however the machinery failed me.

Ted Joans has now come and gone, to fact of modest audience,
a quiet midweek night in Buffalo at the end of the school
year, etc.  He's such an old time kind of poet, with a few
books of his own to sell, satchel of personal belongings, ar-
riving by bus from NYC at 7:25 AM, looking around very particu-
larly.  He proves a bridge over many troubled waters indeed,
with stories of being recently in South Africa and countries
there adjacent--moving as one can when there is no high exposure
to deal with, sticking to the local and being handed on.  He's
moved as a poet reading and talking in Africa more than any other,
of any circumstance--can tell you the particulars of language in
various places, the lore of their locating habits, imaginations.
And so on.

After his reading we were still sitting there, comfortably, talking,
with the chicken wings etc etc--I was saying to Ken Sherwood
how persuasively attractive this curious place (right here/the
so-called net (well named)) had been these past few days.  As if
I'd been waiting like kid at edge of water to jump, and finally
had--and found it terrific!  An exfoliating "self" of weird kind
that literally "echoed" back and back and back in apparent "object-
ivity" that nonetheless was just plain Bob/or words to that effect.

In the early 40s when still in college I had job as copy boy on the
Boston Globe, and recall hysteria of trying to keep up with the
sheets of paper rolling off the bank of teletype machines: "late
breaking" bulletins with endless revisions, cancellations, etc etc.
Now I got chance to play "sender".

But, as Ken said, it's a funny "place" and activity,  as if one could
really get lost "out there," be so "distributed" the focus, or locating
response, were only endless reverberations of one's own initiating act.
That is, it's instantly hard to hear anyone but one's self--and the
moves, as in a poker game or checkers, become too simply (for me at
least) redeterminations of my "position" (hardly "intellectual") as I
want to keep "playing"--and why not.

Seamus Cooney was saying some time back, think of what it would have been
like had you and Olson had email.  Help...  Yet it would have saved all
those drab hours waiting for the mail--as I did at times, crouched back
of brush some thirty feet from where the mail truck would pull up.  In
some obvious ways, writing letters back then was even more of a singular
act, a proposal of self simply, than what I am doing here right now--
but on reflection it seems the same.

Carla Billitteri in last discussion of Olson seminar etc used sense of
the "solipsistic fury" of his late work: "Wholly absorbed..."; "I live
underneath the light of day..."  Etc.  I think of Wittgenstein's essay/
lecture on ethics, wherein he speaks of will to make just one word that
can be autonomous--self creating.  It seems the same "fury"--familiar to
all who read, write, or think no doubt.  "Was that a real poem or did
you just make it up yourself..."  Quien sabe, amigos.

P.S.  Irony indeed that the one "food" Ted is deeply allergic to--like
even a spoon dipped in soup would do it--is chicken.

Re: Olson's "fury" & Bob Creeley's humanizing of it as a generic condition of
readers & writers grasping for an autonomous word.
                                                   I think of other senses,
archaic, mythopoeic, in which Olson would have *worked* the material, pressed
out its ulterior sense. "Fury" is not merely an emotional state, but the name
for the Erinyes, spirits avenging family violence. Their inception is curious,
as they arise from the ground in the drops of blood spattered by the castration
 of Uranus in that primal scene of patricide. Colloquially the furies were appe
aled to in cursing, and are thought of as even the personifications of curse.
And Jean-Pierre Vernant has something interesting to add: "The Erinyes can
claim the two extremes: What is 'pure' and 'natural' is also what is raw. They
do not drink wine but they do eat men."

But what, Bob, would you have done without precisely those shrubs and that ritual. What about the poems and (as here) stories that moment still proposes. Probably you'll just find (as I have in recent moments of messages "purloined" somehow in the net (a sleeping gatekeeper?)) some new kind of bush.

The big difference for me is who's on the other end, or who I think there. The "self" proposed in the O letters, who's working there, includes its companion and goad. In other words the conversation, the very one Emerson proposes to replace religion. Who, here, am I writing to? I'm thinking of you but even in the process know this is different in its diffusion to others I'll never know. Not that one is less composed. Or less uneasy. Still, an overheard conversation.

In Hyampom CA, (drive to Mt Shasta, turn left and take the logging road a hundred miles west) the whole town was (20 years ago, and may still be)  on a single party line--perhaps the morphic antecedent to this moment. They say people, knowing someone was sick, say, would wait for the signal--two longs and a short, or whatever the code for the particular house--then everyone would pick up the phone to find out how the sick person was. That way distrubance was minimized, but everybody knew what was happening. Talk about community. Still, no sweet nothings under those conditions. Thus your exfoliating self moves towards what attractor?

Carla's note of Olson's "solipsistic fury" gets misplaced here necessarily,
just that I took it out of context, didn't mark its company in her thinking
("stone," "double"), nor in any respect suggest what the preoccupations in
her discussion were.  At some point I hope one can read what she's done for
onself--as I'm sure she hopes likewise.  One's trying to get to the place
(what I'd call the context) where Olson finds himself--as in the early note
to Elaine Feinstein: "Orientate me."  ("The light is in the east," etc etc.)

Anyhow, thinking of Jed Rasula's useful addition of the Furies (the English
of the Latin of the Greek)--I like the fact that "fury" locates in "rage,"
and that certainly echoes: "rages, tears..."   "And the thought of its
thought is the rage/ of Ocean   : _apophanesthai_..."

--Egocentrically it recalls my own (humanistic) "possession": "I rage./
I rage, I rage."  The downside, like they say, of a state that is not
simply (only) an emotion (as Jed usefully emphasizes)-- but is a place
one's come into, as "Come into the world."

                        This one,
                        that one,
                        the other one--

I keep thinking of "seizure," a sense I get insistently in Olson --that
one acts in/from such state.  Paradoxically it's the Greco/Roman that seems
to have the problem with such "place," it's so "irrational"--thinking, in
contrast, of the dervishes still very active in Turkey (if often reduced
to a kind of "entertainment" (or so attached) akin to pueblo ritual dances
in the southwestern U.S.).

But here it all goes again--that endless digression!  "Get on board, etc
etc."  I wish there were some damn way to get out/get in "here" so as to
find the literal company one knows is "there".  Somehow the note in the
bottle--charming though that be--is, for me, still the parallel.  Which
means at best I'm in there too.  Show me the way to go home!  I'm TIRED
and I WANT TO GO TO BED...  (P.S.  Just in Baltimore and they sure eat well
--and no chicken wings in sight...  Maryland Institute of Art (Joe Cardar-
elli) seems where it's at.  Anyhow "my Baltimore" is same plus memories of
Andrei Codrescu, David Franks, and impeccable Anselm Hollo.  "Scrapple" on
the menu.  All the trees had leaves!  Barry Alpert in good spirits.  Julie
Kalendak's going to Alaska.  Onward!)

Yes, Mike, that was very much my thinking about this space.  It's great to
have some sense of potential community, but it seems to remain forever
potential.  Perhaps, Bob, if I'd been at the CPG Wednesday night to talk in
person about it  I'd have a sense of more active possibility here, but,
Charles, though I perched 'fore the screen all Wednesday night, nary a whiff
did I catch o' them virtual victuals--though we're perhaps better off not to
have that particular odiferous technology.  (But FREE wings?  When did they
become FREE?)
              So who are my interlocutor?  Jed Rasula re the furies?  which
called to mind Francis Bacon's use of the Erinyes in a few of his paintings,
so clearly connected to the fury of his paint in all those figures--very much
the solipsistic fury that you mentioned, Bob, though I think there's not only
the fury of striving for that word, but a fury at striving for it, at finding
oneself in that situation--all that's involved in "odi et amo."
              But I'm getting off topic.  Thanks, Peter, for the summer
reading suggestions, it's rare to hear anything of CanLit here.  Lately I've
been relaxin' (and cookin') with oldies like Henry Green and Robert Walser,
whom I'm sure you already know.   By the way, Bob, what do you think of
Francis Bacon?  I've been experimenting, putting poets and painters together
in my classes, and you and he seemed to hit it off pretty well....
      My point is, all of these lines seem at once to move out of group and
into individual  conversations.  What is a group discussion in espace?
Do we stick to general queries:  i.e., does anyone recall just where Pound
talks about the air in Italy making one (I think he says a man) more vibrant,
more alive, etc.?    Or could we have some collective impact as a poetics
"consortium"--for instance, organizing protests and recommendations about
mainstream anthology exclusions (the case of W.W. Norton and the Objectivists
comes to mind).  These seem useful functions, though hardly what one dreams of.
    I don't think, in any case, that "we" are going to create the contemporary
equivalent of the Olson-Creeley letters here--the "we" feels too uncertain
(who else is listening?  the IRS?  your  colleagues?  tenure committees?
how pervasive can paranoia become in electronic space? (how many people are
on this list, Charles?)).  But perhaps it can become a starting point for
individual conversations, which could then proceed without the self-regulation
this mode necessarily involves.  And of course  it can also help to alleviate
some of that solipsistic fury--when you want to alleviate it.  But who
knows? Maybe someone'll actually bring back that word--this time.

P.S.  The query, above, is real.  (Everything else, of course, is virtual,
just like those wings Charles promised.)

Since you say seizure, I'm boldened to mark our Bruno's (Jordan Brown's)
sense of the furore poetico, the spasm of saying, the sheer out/burst
from which the art so 'furiously' arises -- not fury (anger) but furioso,

taking fury as furore from my memory of Olson's anabolic clarity out loud.
I had mentioned this to Rasula, to spread wider those Erinyes/Eumenides
(not just the well-intentioned, let alone the Nice Minded ones of Vic-

that furore is of mind, and anything else is rage.  Which is always going

In response to Bruce's "real" query about this e-consortium and the uses to
which it might be put, I have a practical request. I've been asked to review
the new *Columbia History [which it's not!] of American Poetry* edited by Jay
Parini, and wonder if anybody has anything to say about it here. I'll reserve
comment pending yours...

                        As for the omission of the Objectivists in the Norton,
the spanking new 4th edition glossily proclaims its inclusion of Oppen as
groundbreaking. It's not hard to figure out how Oppen finally made it: check
the MLA bibliography on CD-rom and you'll find that if you key in name searches
Oppen (this was last June, actually) gives 108, Zukofsky 85, Reznikoff 50
--contrasting which, to show where the interest really lies, Hollander nets 9,
Hecht 12, Snodgrass 9. Or garnering a bit more attention--but still decidedly
less than the Objectivists--Merwin 47, J.Wright 59, Ammons 60, Kinnell 35, and
even Merrill 46. The myth of Objectivist exclusion may be about to change. (But
one thing this kind of search doesn't indicate, of course, is who makes it into
the anthologies--and Oppen, Rez, & Zuk remain largely *persona non grata*).

Jed & others--

Regarding the anthology business.  The 4th edition of the Norton also
include Niedecker.  I've just been reviewing Am Lit anthologies (for
a textbook committe here at U of Alabama).  Norton is honestly the
most adventurous (re. Objectivists & others) of the major
anthologies.  The much touted Heath anthology--leader in matters
multicultural--exhibits little aesthetic tolerance or range.  I've
been interested for some time in the relationship between
multicultural inclusions vs. aesthetic/formal range.  As Charles B. &
others have pointed out, often multicultural "adventurousness" occurs
as part of a formally rather homogeneous manner of (personal, clear)
expression, and thus more innovative multicultural poetries do not
get included.  Or, as in the new 2nd edition of the Heath, the
version of postmodernism that gets advanced really has very little
postmodern poetry in it.  When the "contemporary" gets represented,
the innovative is hardly ever included (even in token fashion) in the
"major" AM LIT anthologies.

Now, of course, via Hoover's editorship, Norton has a new anthology
of POSTMODERN AMERICAN POETRY, which I'm just reading through now.
It has a fine introduction & quite a few very good selections, giving
readers a good sense of the variety of poetries of the last 45 years.

As for Creeley's chicken wing musings, down here we got ribs.  Best
place is Dreamland in Jerusalem Heights.  They serve nothing but
ribs, and white bread (the spongy, airy variety).  A few years ago,
the IRS raided the place & asked the owner to show them his books.
John Jr., the owner, said what books?  He'd done a cash only business
for years.  Got fined $150,000, and was ordered to serve a community
meal once a year to the occupants of our local state hospital for the
retarded.  Football alums, who also love Dreamland, went to the
courthouse and paid the fine.  The once a year meal has been a
disaster.  Dreamland's ribs/sauce are hot.  The patients, many of
whom are elderly & don't have their own teeth, had been eating bland
foods & couldn't handle the ribs & sauce.  John Jr. apparently now
pays taxes and has books?

Any thoughts on anthologies & the representation (or non-) of
experimental poetries would be appreciated.  Or thoughts on ribs.

Another side to the "multicultural adventurousness", of course, is corporate
competition. I happened to be working as an editorial assistant at Norton
at the time when the Hoover anthology was still being considered. I
remember that the anthology editors were actually going to conferences
and having closed-door meetings about the possibilities of new directions
in canonizing. Essentially it was a matter of them either getting
on the multi-cultural / innovative etc. bandwagon or falling off--the
Norton anthologies, that is, essentially run the business.

And to illustrate what the "formally rather homogenous manner of personal/
clear expression" means when it comes to judging whether a poet is publishable
or not, here is a letter I received from one of the editors
when I tried to get him to consider a Mackey manuscript: "Mr Mackey
works in a poetic vein that I am vaguely aware of, but which I can't
quite grasp. Many beautiful lines, but overall terribly ... elusive.
And I don't have to tell you that the very long line forms at the right
for Norton poets. We will have to decline this serious poet's work in the
politest way possible."

To Hank and others

Just now I received a post from Yunte Huang (thanks), whom you (Hank) know
as, among other things, a poet, translator of Chinese and soon to be
reveller in chicken wings, who is now finished with his work at Alabama.
The note regarded work of Chinese poets he is helping me compile for an
anthology I am editing - "still waiting for a reply from China." With the
appearance of the Norton and the  appeared to be a moment where I could,
for various reasons, announce the project to the list. I have been querying
international poets and editors for five months now and the process now
turns in earnest to the North American "front."

The anthology is a sound, text and image compilation of comtemporary
international experimental poetry. I will publish this gratis on the
internet via something called Mosaic - Mosaic allows the
viewing/reading/listening of images, movies, sound and text. One book
publishers has expressed some "interest" in the project as an electronic
(CD) effort. Publication late '95?...

After my recent posting of Ferdinand Schmatz's "Sud an (kaffee)" (I must
thank Charles for directing me to Schmatz and others) I was asked by Nick
Lawrence to say a little more about the "focus, etc..." of the anthology.
The premise is that the form of this more-than-one-medium anthology, either
in static disk form, or dynamic "internet form," whatever that is, may
disrupt  the kind of notions which often motivate discussions around
anthologies - notions like "the canonical," occidental/oriental splits,
schematic organization of literary development, the shear inanity of
anthologies to begin with, etc.. Of course editorial sympathies remain. But
I am sympathetic to the disruption of established historical and
categorical paradigms to the point that *I* go in and out of focus. I can
say that my focal plane is located somewhere near the idea, to borrow a
phrase from Karatani Kojin, a Japanese literary critic, that "literature is
not natural;" not to rehash the anti-naturalist, anti-positivist debate,
but to establish a picture of a "landscape" of international textual
discourse which unveils its economic manufacture. Or, in our more culinary
scape, how much Buffalo Wings are in Dreamland.

Thus far, as mentioned in my reference to Yunte, queries have been made to
Chinese as well as Japanese, Italian, Austrian, Finnish, French, Spanish,
Indian, British, Russian, Tanzanian and Canadian poets for their texts
(recorded in language of origin). Startling similarities arise; subtle yet
variances in use and expression abound.

Cards and letters to North Americans should go out within the next month or
so. I invite you all to diner - and welcome any suggestions, comments or
questions.

I've not seen the Columbia History etc though it's become a "topic" etc.
There was a curious note by David Perkins, the previous purveyor of
orthodoxy with respect to the "Modern canon," in the HARVARD REVIEW,
pp. 225-227.  He laments what he calls "a lack of personality," coherence,
a point of view, etc., etc.  (He's reviewing both volumes, i.e., American
and British).  More personally, friends begin to be irritated--I think
legitimately--by the snideness with which they are noted, if they are.
That is, that factor of "personality" is certainly present.  Anyhow,
whatever Perkins' own criteria or understanding, one might well ask--like
they say--what's the premise of these judgements?  For example, the 2nd
edition of the Norton dropped Zukofsky, and then, as I recall, another
involved with American "literature" included Niedecker that same year.
Ted Berrigan was also dropped.  I have seen none of the recent antholo-
gies to date--with the sole exception of VOICES FROM THE NUYORICAN
CAFE, which seems of a "place and time" at least sans question.  Anyhow
talking to Allen G/ in NYC recently (after the celebration for Paul Hoover's
antho/ at St Marks), he seemed much impressed--and he is an inveterate
anthology-maker (for use in his own teaching).  Jed, Charles tells me of
your active rehearsal of the canon of my own immediate elders, i.e., the
group as Lowell, Jarrell, Roethke, and of how they were kept "in place."
So all the above must be quite familiar.  "Nobody here but us chickens..."

Furthering the discussion of anthologies and canonization, has anyone
perused the new _Oxford Companion to Twentieth-Century Poetry_?  Ed.
Ian Hamilton, which ought to tell us something.  It has the virtue
of multinational inclusion, "from America and Britain to Trinidad
and Zimbabwe."  All the principal Objectivists are included, plus
an entry on the movement itself.  But whereas C. Coolidge is mentioned
in passing in the entry on New York School, The, and C. Bernstein in

Hudgins (friendly acquaintances all) merit (?) their own entries.

I LOOK THROUGH YOUR EYES


Begin, I say, begin.

I have disappeared from my life. At one point, I had fashioned an
artwork or sculpture, a wire envelope indicating the farthest reaches
of my arms and legs, the inner space of the body. Wire formed the
surface between flesh and the outer world, and wire was the metaphor
for transverse or transgressive logics carrying the weight of gesture
across the body itself.

It is this beyond, thrust against gesture, to which gesture cannot
penetrate, that I dedicate this short essay in the elegiac mode.
Romanticism, always illusory, bases itself upon such, and I find
myself within its portals, about to make an entrance accompanied by
numerous shades and indeterminate genders.

I speak of the envelope of wires, of telephones and computer networks,
of communications focused upon the parabolic mirror of the heart. For
here, I have received one ghost only to discard another; I have been
discarded by a third, and enveloped by a fourth who murmurs,
everything has limitations and your body has written me.

And years ago, I believed in just this: that I have written myself
simultaneously in and out of existence, that writing was the hinge
turned against the sheer inertia of the world. But now I reach out and
find the current of the wires dangerous and sparking; ozone fills the
air which I remember to breath, and haunted pools of liquid threaten
annihilation if I overstep the keyboard and its memories. Here I have
learned from Weber: The Call is always a translation, mercurial at
best, and the Call is literate.

I bend deeper into the keys themselves, jetsam on an indeterminate
sea. My back strains with the weight of moderated thought. Beyond the
window is another window. Beyond another window is a window, darkness
outside illuminated by the circular resonance of yellowed lamps
disappearing in a forced perspective, Dean Street drowned by so many
others. London would not have suffered in the comparison; London is a
word of magic, illuminated by the street of the kindly Dean, Swift to
the occasion:

          "Suppose me dead; and then suppose
           A club assembled at the Rose;
           Where, from Discourse of this or that,
           I grow the Subject of their Chat."

The petals stem themselves from a breast or fountain animate, close to
the invention of steam for rail or water transportation. Steam
breathes the extension of language in the future Railway Panic or
speculation arranged from capital and fear of the compression of flesh
itself. No longer etiquette holds against the centrifugal thrust
repeatedly towards empire returning gold to Portugal and Spain.
Violence occurs whenever discourse is downed, the table replaced by
emptied telephony, packets and nodes choked with useless information
rewriting, on a continuous basis, the history of the electrical world
itself. So my eyes are closed; dead, I continue.


To continue to conjure or reproduce those which I love and those whom
I have loved, or merely, in relation to an indifference: I would find
you beyond the hindrance of address. To do so is to remember, the
password leads only to a null file; every word passes and every word
returns writing/culture degree zero. Suppose it dead, you dead,
myself: This uncanny harboring continues, nightly, tall ships with
masts catching electron wind between one and another star, sailing
mournfully down Dean Street itself, passing in calmed or still waters
and nowhere moving or returning.

It is the stillness which shapes the thing. The thing occurs only in
the shaping of silence. Letters project their third dimension; it is
necessary as well that I am here, producing the occurrence of their
text, that is to say, their dominion. More than the dominion of
letters I am not, and more I would be.

I have been discarded, effaced; no longer existing, existence
disappears after one more address, one more presence. You do not make
it real; emission pools beyond you, a doubled annular eclipse
shadowing in the form of stuttered outline. Beyond the street is
another street.

          "The fools, my juniors by a year,
           Are tortur'd with suspense and fear;
           Who wisely thought my age a screen,
           When death approach'd, to stand between:
           The screen remov'd, their hearts are trembling;
           They mourn for me without dissembling."

Dean Swift, Alan Sondheim, 432 Dean Street, and Brooklyn, NY, and

"If childhood doesn't exist for Andrews, claims
precedence as neither word nor concept, it's because
the child is an ideological construct, a role that society
foists, not only upon the young, but on _all_ subjects;
childhood for Andrews, if anything, is a meaningless
word, a concept without rigor, a social practice
determined by adult orders whose rejection, never-
theless, childhood alone is reserved for."

  **Bruce Andrews

"since they all have cotton wads in their ears, I _must_ be
the syrene who is singing on their rock."
  **Robert Duncan

". . . and might not this poetics of the outburst--cruelly,
unintentionally--have given Duncan over to a power of
poetry terrible to behold, violent even in its erudition, a
territorial pissing, a childish statecraft, a poetics closer
to that of Bruce Andrews . . ."

improved junk."

Subject:      Alberta on My Mind

I've been travelling

to Vancouver, where I read at the Kootenay
School of Writing & tried to get the
collective authorities there to sell me a
Ph.D. for less than the $50 (Canadian)
they have been asking, only that I
enjoy discounts and special pricing,
I mean I don't question the value,
so we're in a Vietnamese restaurant
& Colin Smith pulls out a letter
he happens to have in his bag
from some official government agency
telling KSW that they must cease and
desist from offering unlicensed
postsecondary instruction to which Colin
suggests that the best solution may
be to send the person who wrote
the admonition an honorary degree from
KSW -- hm, Canadians really are
different than us Statesiders, they
seem to know how to get along

so, Bruce, speaking of Canadian poets --
Idaho, Canada that is --
got word of a celebration in Vancouver
next spring of Robin Blaser's
70th birthday, now in the planning;
and just missed Peter Quartermain's
60th birthday; & realized I had failed
(old story) to mention, in my hyperbolic
notices for (KSWers) Kevin Davies's
& Deanna Ferguson's new books in
the new Sulfur, Catrinna Strang's
Low Fancy, which I got only after I
turned that notice in

& on to Edmonton, where I got lost in
the Fantasyland Mall on the way to
one of the demikeynotes at the
International Association for Philosophy
and Literature "Thinking Between Poetry
& Philosophy" convention & so missed
most of the lecture on the "The Ineluctable
Split of Poetry's Unsayable Name: Reading
Derrida through Nietzsche's Unknowable
Answer to Celan's Joyce (A Response to
Benjamin)."  Many of the conventioneers
noted that the "Bourbon Street" food
mall was a perfect example of "simulation" --
a view I have trouble understanding
(again not unusual for me)
since the patrons of food court
seem to enjoy the fact that
"Bourbon Street" is ineluctably in
the West Edmonton Mall & the designers
of the street seemed to go
out of their way to emphasize this fact,
making it look like a plastercaste
sketch of a picture of a New Orleans street
& not like the "real thing" at
all; the only ones fooled were
we conventioneers having our
dinner as we chatted about the
breakdown of reality and simulacra
(or simusoy for the lactose
intolerant).  & talk about authentically
local as you might, the Buffalo
wings on Bourbon Street
in  the West Edomonton Mall
never tasted so real
(or would have; I had the trout)

so somewhat late to
respond to the various & sundry
recent posts

but, speaking of simulacra,
Jed Rasula's book, which I recently
read in manuscript, is called
_The American Poetry Wax Museum:
Reality Effects 1940-1990_.  I hope it
comes out soon: it's not-to-be-missed.
Jed has a way of making the story of
what he calls New Criticism, Inc.,
absolutely rivetting, so much so that
I could understand, as if for the first time,
what made the American poetry canon of the
1950s possible.  Jed's work is essential
in its elucidating the cultural logic
of the countermodernist turn.
I also just got word that Alan Golding's
_From Outlaw to Classic: Canon in
American Poetry_ will be out this fall
from the University of Wisconsin.

Meanwhile, Douglas Messerli's 1135-page
epic _From the Other Side of the
Century: A New American Poetry 1960-1990_
(Sun & Moon Press) is now out and
beginning to make its way into the world.
I just got an advance copy today.

A Note on this List

As new people join Poetics@UBVM I ask them not to mention the
list on any public internet space (BBS, listserve, etc) in order
to keep this particular group to a relatively small scale.  This
is not to discourage people from recommending the list to others
but to keep the list to people who have a direct involvement with
its current constituency (however undefined that may be).

INFORMATION (at Charles Bernstein's request)


For anyone interested in recapturing the 'immediacy' of past
postings, dredging up the traces of ALL POETICS traffic since
March 1994, there is an archive.

To receive a file containing all posts since that date with nasty
header material excised, send the following command, as the one and
only line in a mail message to listserv@ubvm.cc.buffalo.edu

GET POETICS NOTEBOOK

For those whose accounts do not typically 'interact' well with the
poetics list, you might try ammending this command to:

GET POETICS NOTEBOOK F=mail

(This should result in the VERY LONG file being sent as a normal
mail message.  NO promises!)

Subject:      wings, ribs, and books

After reading Hank's wonderful story of the Dreamland BBQ ribs, I, as a
restaurant owner in the same town, would like to share with ya'll my
imaginative experience with IRS. I have so far very carefully kept my books
in Chinese. Anything that is even faintly comprehensible to the English
readers will be eliminated from the books. Therefore, you can't find any
Arabian numbers in them, nor Roman numerials (as a swain sang: business is
a secret, and risky path off the cultures). The only things you can find are
hieroglyphic characters and some I-chingish, yin-yang stuff. So if IRS raids
us, I will give them a seemingly cunning oriental, or Wenzhouish (Hank and
James) smile, and    gladly present them the books. In addition, I wil  also
show them the book I have translated, _Selected Language poems_ (by Charles,
Hank, and James), suggesting that since I can translate that kind of difficult
poetry stuff, I can sure do a "faithful" translation of these books, if they
really need my service.

P.S. If there are any secret agents here on this list, mind you, this is
poetics discussion, and my piece above shows, hopefully, the complexity of
cultural communication as the functional languages are concerned. "Nothing
here but wings, ribs, and leftovers..."

PEOPLE OF THE WORLD: RELAX!

Beware of boys in tight pants
They are perverts
Beware of tight pants
They chap the fanny and irritate the leg muscles
Your friends will laugh
And your mother will know
Do not feel guilty if showers turn you on
There is nothing wrong with masturbating in the shower
I masturbate in the shower
And there is nothing wrong with that
Everyone does it
If you do not do it, try it
Everyone does it

People of the world: RELAX!

If you want to be a movie star go to Hollywood
If you want to be a dancer dance right now
Or it will be too late
And you will be unhappy
Be a dancer if you want to be a dancer
Do not be afraid
Some of the best people I know are dancers

People of the world: RELAX!

Take it easy and smoke a lot
Make all the noise you want to on the toilet
Other people will hear you but it does not matter

People of the world: RELAX!

Put on a clean white shirt and RELAX
Do not be afraid
Some of the best people I know are afraid
Do not be afraid of death
It will not hurt you

People of the World: RELAX!

This is a good life
Go of-of-doors a lot
Smell flowers
Sit down in the grass
It will not hurt you
Look at the tree
The sky is blue
Climb every mountain
Air is the only hope
Do not kill any ants
They are your best friends

PEOPLE OF THE WORLD: RELAX!

The world is yours
Here, take it

I remember when polio was the worst thing in the world.

I remember that little jerk you give just before you fall asleep.  Like

and when I went to shake his hand I just pulled his whole arm off.
