  This is why the left fails in the USA even when the dems are in =
control

  1) In 1964 America was moving towards a  Social Democratic consensus.
  2) Conservatives realized that the only way that they could survive =
this
  consensus  was to create a shadow establishment because in 1964 most
  institutions, colleges, think tanks and groups were left leaning and =
the
  left was growing.
  3) Conservatives also realized that two communities that in 1964 were =
'left
  leaning' Urban Catholics and Southern Whites did not like the disorder =
of
  the later 60's and also that they were economically liberal but =
socially
  conservative.
  4) Conservatives built from this a shadow establishment that created =
ideas-
  and mailing lists to make money for their movement. They also created =
wedge
  issues.
  5) Liberals/Social Democrats on the other hand abandoned organizing as =
a
  mass movement later in the 60's as Civil Rights Movement spawned Black
  Power,and the other splinter groups and the left broke into the many
  "pressure groups" that the left is made of today, Feminists, Gays,
  Environmentalists splintering a whole progressive agenda.
  6) The Democrats rather than building a Social Democratic consensus as =
was
  formed in Europe where the welfare state had benefits for ALL of =
society,
  build a series of programs to "LIFT UP" certain groups hence =
resentment was
  created within the taxpayers that the Right exploited. If the Dems had =
built
  a structure like in Europe that the Middle Class bought into there =
would be
  no conservative movement today. But the left chose to splinter and =
chase
  small gains rather than the big idea as was won in Europe.
  7) The right however remained intact and with simple organization and =
its
  shadow establishment was able to weather Watergate while the left =
could not
  recover from McGovern and the loss of Carter in 1980.

  The key for the left in the USA is move away from "special interest"
  politics rather than being a list of "groups seeking justice" the Left =
ought
  to try to create a consensus for a certain social compact.

  Imagine if someone here in the USA could articulate a Social =
Democratic
  vision-- cogently--- that said look you are going to pay more taxes =
but
  university will be free, health care will be universal, and we are not =
going
  to let our cities fall apart, you will have mass transit et cetera.

  If a left politician could articulate this-- versus the right's =
harping on
  'autonomy''freedom'and 'free markets' the left can win but if the left
  remains the 'special interest' party the right can use that as a way =
to
  separate people and win every election. But instead we spend our =
resources
  on corporate welfare, and wasteful social spending that does not =
address
  real issues. Until the left has a cogent vision and an articulate =
spokes
  person for these values they will not win.

 Friendships and Free Publications: a critical exploration of the rhizomic
nature of, and the gift economy known as, Canadian Small/Micropress
Publishing

 Dear colleagues, friends, writers,

 Amidst the collapse of small press distribution, the gradual extinction of
independent bookstores, a seemingly apathetic public, and really cold
winters throughout most of the country, it seems somehow important to
examine the persistent existence of the small/micropress in Canada. Many
writers find their first publications of a substantial length with small or
micropresses, which can be an incredible asset along the way to theorizing a
larger project, or conceptualizing what it could be that turns a random
sequence of poems into a bound whole. Small and micropresses have proven to
be an active and enduring location for the erasure of the anxieties which
can accompany a widely distributed and marketed 'book', in this sense it
could be considered the non-site of Canadian publishing; an extremely active
space formerly believed to be void, Canada's very own evocative dark matter.

 With this issue of 'Open Letter' we invite papers on all aspects of
small/micropress publishing in Canada with a specific interest in
contmporary (i.e. post-1980) presses, although we will be flexible on a
project by project basis. Possible topics include but are by no means
limited to: the economics of small/micropress publishing vs. larger press
publishing however that can be figured, interviews pertaining to
small/micropress publishing in Canada, the politics of small/micropress
publishing, a critical engagement with a specific press or presses or with a
specific period of time with a focus on small/micropress publishing. We
would like to stay away from memoirs, bibliographic studies of presses and
papers written by affiliates of the presses upon which an author is writing.

 We ask for papers submitted to be double spaced, 12 pt times new roman or
equivalent, under 2500 words and saved as one of the following filetypes if
emailed or mailed on disk: .rtf, .txt, or .doc. Hard copies can be mailed to
either of the below addresses. The deadline for submissions is March 1st,
2004. We eagerly await your submissions.

 With thanks,

Hi
My question is regarding publishing.  I had a poem published in an anthology
through poetry.com.  I since have received a request from Noble HOuse in
England to submit a poem for an anthology.  Can anyone tell me how
legitimate these publishers are and if the poem is really considered
published if a poem is published in one of these anthologies?  Or are they
just money making schemes by the publishers since they are trying to get the
poet to purchase the anthology?

Thanks for any feedback.

Isn't it disappointing, as Kirby Olson suggested yesterday, that the
United States is not more like Finland--98.7% white--or that the rest
of us "others" have not yet been driven out by the harsh climate or
repeated beatings.

And it's also convenient that the American left is able to continue
to blame its failings (as it has since the end of the 1960s) on those
"separatist" groups--Kirby Olson's and Haas Bianchi's catalog
includes African-Americans, feminists, gays and lesbians--that have
worked to open up American politics to a full range of voices.  (It's
ironic, in this respect, that Bianchi would follow up his take on the
left's "splintering" with a post bemoaning the all-Nordic good guys
of Lord of the Rings.)

I don't pretend to have a solution for the challenges to the left
that Bianchi, Olson, and others have usefully put forward.  But I
certainly don't think that the left is going to succeed by seeking to
turn back the clock to a moment of imagined unity, or by casting out
its one of its most vital constituencies: those groups that have
historically been disenfranchised by racism and sexism.  I'm not sure
there's much place for me in a left that looks like Finland--that's a
left that sure isn't going to produce a "new Lincoln."

I may have misread, but I think the point was that a platform promoting,
say, a government health care system and federal funding of education might
be both more appealing to the majority and more useful in creating
something like social class equity than underwriting some of the costs of
medicine for the poor and the elderly or supplementing school funds in
low-tax revenue communities.

Recently, Kirby Olson posted a message to another list stating the
following:

     " 2 goof-ups in American poetics:

       1. Only things -- WCW

       2. Only language -- Bernstein etc. "

I thought to myself, well now - William Carlos Williams and Charles
Bernstein might not really be opposite ends of a spectrum, but if there are
alleged excesses - towards categories of "things" or "language" - maybe this
is something that should be addressed.

Yes - something that should be addressed.

There being no other volunteers (cowards!) - I took this task upon myself.

Making use of our modern tools, I took a sampling of Will Bill and a
sampling of Bernstein, and thus created the perfect poem, melding both the
"thing" and "language" aspects of their unique styles.

Sincerely,
Brent Bechtel

Failing to gnaw on the plastic straw.


The barfly
butters his foyer
with a fat girl
from an odd January,
dyed in Villon's time.

Snow, this full,
fragile head,
slips sidewise,
full of dressing.

The open street-door
lets in the tongue,
thundering slantwise
and cold on the steady car -
heckling at you
and your aesthetic values.

You will read
these flowers from New York,
and lose your second husband
to a spilled cream soda.

Orange, always orange.

In 2003, in his Wesleyan University Press book, ~The
Constructivist Moment: From Material Text To Cultural
Poetics,~ Barrett Watten spends a sub-chapter
discussing this very SUNY Buffalo Poetics Listserv.

And pp. 97-101 he devotes to List posts of one
"Jeffrey Jullich", ---in specific the post entitled
"D=E=E=N", about Lyn Hejinian's poetry.

What did the "D=E=E=N" post actually say in its
entirety?  And what was Watten leaving out (and
~why?!~) when he called it "too long to be fully
accounted for here"?

http://selectedpoeticsposts.tripod.com/

Who was this "Jeffrey Jullich"?

A fictional amalgam of Alan Sondheim's "Jennifer" and
"Julu" characters, fused and come to life?

for an e-anthology of ~over seventy~ yes ~seventy
(70)~ SELECTED POETICS LISTSERV POSTS, including the
controversial "D=E=E=N".


Watten speaks of Jullich's "theory of new meaning",
and calls 'him' "inspired":

"Jullich is inspired because . . . he has discovered a
secret that has eluded many . . . : a way to solve the
uninterpretability of the material text"

[~Constructivist Moment,~ p. 100].

Watten ranks the name "Jullich, Jeffrey" immediately
after that of "Joyce, James" [p. 421]!


{Any List interlocutors who would like their names or
texts removed from THE SELECTED POETICS LISTSERV POSTS
of Jeffrey Jullich, please e-mail 'us' at

Not exactly a blog, but a proto-blog out of the 1990s:

(Any bloggers blog-roll-hyperlinking to THE SELECTED
are kindly asked to omit the obsolete name "Jeffrey
Jullich" and to use only "Jeffre  Jullic ".  Thank
you, come often, and have a happy 2=0=0=4.)

process my work not as you would read a book like harry potter or one by stephen king or a poem by
walt whitman or even a book like finnegan's wake - please SCAN my writing - view it as you would
view any visual object - because this is the purpose for which "Formal Spam" was created - Formal
Spam is a genre that the reader treats as a visual object - ian and i have called this genre Formal
Spam because like all popular media and other infiltrating material that permeates contemporary
culture we have created our own surface material to saturate the reader's attention - by formalizing
spam we have introduced into our visually centered text a multiplicity of subsurface meaning, neural
messaging and other waveforms of communication transmitted from boundary conditions,
interpenetrating logospheres and realtime juxta-portals

In a real anthology they pay you. Same thing with, say, construction

here is the point-- when programs and movements benefit the whole of society
they are popular and they get democratic support but when programs are
focused on small groups they become the focus of attacks and as we saw with
welfare reform these programs can be gutted.  But gutting Social Security is
not a problem because everyone gets it-- the goal on the left should be
extending rights to everyone.

hey,

while you're all outta sync and disoriented, having partied on
consecutive wednesdays and skipped out of work on consecutive fridays,
we'd like to inform you of an opportunity to complete the cycle by
spending your sunday night at Ben & Mo's, 1225 Connecticut Ave NW for
H.E.R., Hip hop in its Essence for Real.

the performers:  J-Live/OddiSee/Kaimbr/Prochi

need more info?  of course you do, and abby & laura shall provide it
NOW:  (easy, POEM-CEES)

"Hey everyone,

J-LIVE is headlining this Sunday at the DC's best live
hiphop show, H.E.R.!!!(my unbiased opinion of course).
Thats right, you will get to enjoy a full live set
from the livest performer anywhere, in an intinate
setting, for the bargain price of just $10!!! No one
who has All of the Above, the Best Part or the new EP,
Always Will Be, will want to miss it. Personally, I'm
hoping to hear the song "Wax Paper."

Along with J-Live, OddiSEE and Kaimbr, from the Low
Budget Crew are also performing. You may have caught
OddiSEE at our Beat Society show in November where he
killed it, or on this year's Seven Heads compilation,
which also features J-Live and our friends Asheru and
Blue-Black of Unspoken Heard.

You may not have caught KAIMBR anywhere yet, although
he does do the Soundbridge shows at Mangos, but he's
just dope. Definately one of the few best MC's in DC
right now.

ORBIT 122 is deejaying all night. As all the hardcore
Reuinion-heads know, Orbit is an all around great DJ,
and it will be great to actually see him scratching
and mixing right on the H.E.R. stage.

So come out to H.E.R. this Sunday. The battle is
happening, as usual, headed by PROCHI, who is the
funniest host ever. The bar will be manageable, i
PROMISE.

J-LIVE THIS SUNDAY AT BEN N MO'S. How many ways can I
say it??? And that's THIS SUNDAY. The one coming up.
January 4th. Doors at 9pm, show at 10pm. Don't be
square, be there at...

H.E.R.
Hiphop in its Essence for Real
Every Sunday at Ben n' Mo's
1225 Connecticut Ave NW
doors at 9, show at about 10pm
All Ages, must show ID to drink."

The space within the cohering frame, within the convention which makes
the representation possible, as long as the convention itself does not
remain invisible.

How do I expose the conventions if they are operating through the
material, as if there were the choice not to have the meanings that
inhere in the exposures made political?

Who can account for the conflict of codes brought to the act of
reading? If the reading commits to wanting the writing to try to write
and not _be_ writing and not _be_ poetry.

Reading and writing (reading to write) are positioned in ways next to
impossible to identify--there is no free or autonomous or independent
view--and experiments with extreme angles get at this, get after this,
without surrendering to the fascination of the extreme, as that would
be to surrender to annihilation.

"It's against barbarism, but not the conditions which produce it!"
(Brecht). But to inhabit the conditions that produce the victim, that
would provoke a collision with those who 'simply identify with the
persecuted, an unthought, undistanciated, unreflexive identification.'

And/Or?: "_Anything_ can be written about by anyone (with _power_. And
the powerless and powerless not to imitate this.)"

So:
"The cameraman is the deserted fragment of humanity, absent from the
representation but forcefully present as imaginary referent, quite
clearly _there_ as well."

To separate this sentence from its surrounding remarks about late
1940s Belgian surrealist shock aesthetics in a brief critique of
Tsuena Nakai's "Alchemy" cited as first appearing in "Studio
International," March 1975, would be to separate the sentence from a
surrounding irony nowhere inflected in the single sentence.

"Words and images are a public trust and for this reason I will
continue with my work regardless of the hardships, even if it costs me
my life."

 From a statement by Mazen Dana made on the occasion of a 2001
International Press Freedom acceptance speech as quoted in the August
18 Guardian report of his death the day before.

"Suddenly, the camera seems to vault from the car, in a long take
composed of violent, short pans back and forth as the cameraman runs
toward the action, finding people taking cover. The result is shaky,
blurry, Brakhage-like footage of earth and background buildings that
sometimes holds briefly on human figures."

This from another essay where attention is given to the excision from
Mark Oberhaus' 1988 documentary of "excessive, perhaps unreadable"
'technological surplus' from the first live footage aired from the
scene of November 22, 1963.

One problem here is counterposing "a classically traumatic event in
recent U.S. cultural and political history" with the problem of an
on-going regime of the image from within the further problem of
what might be called a shock aesthetic of the machined stare.

"The machine is a critique of humanism, the cinematic apparatus is
durable, in duration, machined, endless _and_ unendurable, in
duration, machined, endless. It is the ineffable stare, machined by
the projection of film. The stare as machined via the
durable/unendurable continuum is produced by the anti-humanistic
debodied, desexed, screened image, forcing the productive viewer from
impossible consumption. The relation to an anti-humanistic stare, as
opposed to some metaphor for the human, is crucial to this concept."

Except that Gidal's remarks elsewhere on the splice would appear to
apply to the author's own certainty in the machined stare's
'impossibility of consumption':

"Lenin warned that often mechanistic materialism is the greater
danger, idealism the lesser, because the latter can still be
dialectical and one has to educate away the idealisms, whilst the
former is a mechanistic and undialectical basis for whatever
formulations are made, theories constructed, politics avowed. Such
mechanization is then harder to dialecticize, as it becomes the base
for an entire method and practice, whatever the method."

PLEASE SUPPORT Benefit concert Sunday 7:30pm at Ashkenaz in Berkeley!!
=======================================================

(The following is Part 2 of Fire and Rain: an interview with Ayodele
Nzinga at www.sfbayview.com now!)

by Ra'shida Askey

Ayodele Nzinga, aka WordSlanger, is a spoken word artist from Oakland
who can't be fully appreciated until you hear her perform yourself.

I had actually been following some of her work for almost a year until
universal law fell into place and I was able to get an interview with
her. Beyond a spoken word artist, WordSlanger is definitely a teacher of

the people and a professor of the poor, as she brings truth to the
socio-economic and political circumstances we face as a people in her
poetry, in her performance and in just mere conversation.

The best talent from our best warriors will not be heard on mainstream
television and radio, because these media outlets do not want to support

people who create art for people to liberate themselves. Luckily, this
warrior woman does not allow the marginalizing mainstream media to keep
her work silent while she creates other avenues to feed the community
with her talent.

On Sunday, Jan. 4, Fire & Rain, a benefit for the son of WordSlanger who

suffered severe burns over 22 percent of his body, will be held at
Ashkenaz in Berkeley to give us all a spoken word and musical experience

that will be food for thought and liberation. Let's take a moment to see

what food WordSlanger is slangin' to us for dinner this week.

Ra'Shida: Being that you are not motivated by Hollywood, who do you
produce product for?

WordSlanger: Who am I writing to? Everybody is performing for somebody.
When I write, I am not performing for White or mainstream Amerikkka. I
am not excluding them, but I am not writing for them. My target is North

American Africans and oppressed, marginalized people everywhere.

I am interested in fostering and continuing a dialogue about what led to

the present, how it is we find ourselves right here, what's important
about now, what's real, what is relevant to our struggle, and about the
future and how it is we see ourselves in it.

When I talk about a revolution these days, it is about a revolution of
thought. Some people think that we won the revolution - that we have
civil rights and it's all good. I think they trippin'. In some ways, we
are worse off as a people than during Reconstruction.

I want us to understand the time that we live in is significant. The
Black on Black crime rate, the youth murdering each other, the high
incarceration rates, the high dropout rate, all of these things are
significant and crucial to our ability to survive as a self-authoring
people. And I think a lot of time we feel helpless. We are only 11
percent of the population, and that is a reality.

But we are also part of a larger group of people that is in actuality a
majority on the planet. This group is composed of the oppressed,
marginalized, exploited people excluded from the dialogue that runs the
world. When we adopt the latter status, it moves us beyond simple
divisive issues of race, where we can see the reality of global
corporate capitalism as it divides and devours the world.

If human beings don't take care of business, Black people won't have to
worry about their problems, because society - as we know it - will cease

to exist. If we allow ourselves to remain in our current position, would

it make it any different if the world was reformed if we remain in our
current position?

African Amerikkkans have a dual challenge, we have business in the world

as human beings and we have business as North American Africans. As
human beings, we are at a flashpoint; we have to decide whether or not
we want the future to be dominated by a Western European point of view.
North American Africans are further challenged by an unfinished
conversation surrounding the misappropriation and the resultant
traumatic existence composed of marginalization, and exclusion, here in
North Amerikkka.

In my opinion, the window to complete that conversation is closing on
North Amerikkkan Africans. How can we participate in the larger dialogue

without finishing our own conversation first? Frankly I don't see how we

can join in the conversation that the world is having if we have not
taken care of our own unfinished business.

People have a dream about leaving the ghetto, chasing the Amerikkkan
dream like you can buy it from a catalog and get it shipped to you like
Readers Digest. I am looking for the North Star in the hood; I want to
change the blocks and spots into neighborhoods. Neighborhoods we have
pride in, feel safe in, are invested in, feel motivated to protect and
nurture.

I believe in building community, and I will never be bigger than my
home. I feel like I am going to school for the community because I don't

plan to go leave. I'm building an arsenal. I am acquainting myself with
how prevailing culture makes meaning.

I plan to stay right there in the Lower Bottoms and build. I am pursuing

a Ph.D. to be able to better help us formulate whatever theory it is we
need to formulate in order to be effective in spite of, around or
through the systemic causes of our oppression. So in the vernacular of
the streets, I'm hood for life.

Ra'Shida: As a mother, what is the greatest threat to our Black
community?

WordSlanger: Simple statistics are enough to terrify you. One in six go
to jail, one in five die before the age of 21. More are bound for the
penitentiary than college. As Marvin X likes to say, the dope man
remains the number one employer of our youth.

Just trying to beat the statistics and the odds is a full time job. I
have five sons, and it remains difficult in this society to raise men.
The system itself conspires against it.

One of the most crucial issues we need to address as a community is a
concept of family. It is imperative that we focus and concentrate on
building strong Black families and acknowledge the accomplishment as a
revolutionary act.

Ra'Shida: Why is it revolutionary to raise Black families?

WordSlanger: It's another way of creating food for the table. Soldiers
raise soldiers. We are good at division. We have been taught to divide.
We have had lessons in division every since the ship and the Middle
Passage. We don't multiply or add as well as we divide. We are slow to
pull resources, to act decisively, to have concern about someone outside

of ourselves. We lack the skills to build.

How are we going to build a community if we cannot raise a family? It is

our families that compose our communities. If you raise sons who don't
go to jail, who don't deal dope, who respect themselves and other Black
people, who honor the concept of family, then they will - in turn -
build strong Black families.

Ra'Shida: Describe the event Jan.4, 2004.

WordSlanger: The event is called Fire & Rain, and it is a benefit for my

son. He was burned over 22 percent of his body; he has had eight
surgeries so far and will have to have more. He has had skin graphs, all

the fingers on his right hand were amputated, and he is looking at a
couple of years of extensive physical therapy. He has to wear special
garments. He was in the hospital for two months. His total recovery is
anticipated to take a couple of years.

And the community came together, and most of the performers performing
are friends of mine or friends of friends who care enough to come in an
effort to make sure Koran gets what he needs and enable me to continue
to do what I do.

I do not think that there is anything worse than when you see yourself
as a protector of your community and your family and something bad
reaches inside of that circle and touches one of yours. It wounds you in

a way that nothing else does - especially when it is mother and child.

I'm a solider. Not just a soldier, a general. I have overcome immense
personal adversity in my own life. I have been through a lot of things
that have wrecked people. I am still standing, still serving food for
the table.

But when my child got hurt, it's like the whole world stopped. I say
from the bottom of my heart, it was the community reaching up and
putting its hands on me, holding me and my family, praying for us,
calling, going back and forth to Sacramento to see my son in the
hospital, dropping food off at my house, sharing limited resources,
giving me cash that enabled me to soldier through it. Community came and

they tried as hard as they could to create a space where I could
navigate through the emotional upheaval and support my son and to enable

me to do what it is I do.

A lot of the times, artists and activists work in a vacuum. You are
centered around an event, an issue, a project, and you do not really
know the type of effect you are having on the community. You don't know
whether or not they are feeling you. I felt love from the community.

And if I sound kind of surprised, I am, because you never really know
whether or not someone is listening or if they have been touched. It
gives me strength to continue doing what I do, because I know there is
an army out their traveling off the food I keep putting on the table.

There are always lessons to be learned in life. Every experience in life

can leave you with some knowledge. I know that I work for community and
that community for me is a real entity, and not a euphemism.

I try to walk what I talk. It is an important part of the whole thing to

be real about what I talk. It's from the heart. A lot of times I feel
alone in a vacuum. One of the things that is helping us get through what

happen to my son is the outpouring of concern from our community.

'Fire & Rain'

Everybody needs to come out to the Fire & Rain event on Sunday, Jan. 4.
It will be at Ashkenaz, 1317 San Pablo Ave. in Berkeley, from 7:30 p.m.
until - and it is $10-$20 sliding scale. It is important that we as a
community support our own artists from our communities, because they are

the ones who create art for our better livelihood.

For all the food that WordSlanger has put on our community table, it is
time to show our support for her struggle and come to the benefit. Bring

your friends and family out to see the work of this warrior woman griot
as well as all the other performers like JT the Bigga Figga, Rudi
Mwongozi, Paradise, Gabriella, the Congo Square 2 Drum Circle and more.
This is the right way to start off 2004 as a community of soldiers.

This is very sad news. A friend of mine emailed me -- "Mike was not only one

Aaron,

I remain interested in the series you are developing & have not forgotten my
invitation to visit Poetry Beat. Unfortunately, Poetry Beat is in trouble,
having been unexpectedly cancelled by the KDHX Programming Committee after a
fourteen year run. There have been numerous expression of outrage by members
of the diverse poetry commmunities & just plain old loyal listeners & the
decision will be appealed by myself & anyone else who wishes to attend the
next programming committe open meeting at 4:30, January 14th, 625 South
Euclid, Suite 100. If you wish to express your support you can attend or
email
the station director, Bev Hacker, at bhacker@kdhx.org & ask her to forward
your message to the members of the programming committee. Poetry Beat is one
of the few Poetry radio programs in the country and probably the longest
running.

In any event, good luck with your projects... the beat goes on.

Double-sonnet:   Methane

I.
It's hard to know where to begin. Kenny started growing his own
methane out behind the house when he was in his early forties and has
continued to this very day. The little methane bushes he ultimately moves
to rows in the garden, but in this climate they need to be started off

in a greenhouse or at least a solarium. During the winter these would
need to have some form of heat, no? So, my job is to tear down the knotty
pine siding and burn enough of it every day to keep the solarium warm on
those frequent days at these latitudes that we don't get any sun. He plants

his little methane bushes in between the rows of lemon trees out back, the ones
we keep alive over the long winters here by firing up the smudge pots. Once
Kenny's recovered from the animals and the pool and the narcotic analgesics
he's had to take every four hours, he'll be on his feet again, out in back, tending

his little bushes. Much of what Kenny says is complex and interesting, but around
here we have lots of those little old half  wine barrels you find sometimes at home

II.
and garden stores, so knowing where to plant him when he's not up to snuff
is never a problem. I wish I could see your house. It probably has some of those
pipes and ducts and things running all around from the water-heater to keep things
warm, and one of those slatty wooden things in the corner of the kitchen that make

the room so cozy. Now, it's come to my attention that a rumor (sort of) has been
associated with my name and the end of my fifty-year marriage to Kenny. It seems
that some of you are under the impression that I had affairs behind Kenny's back,
not once, not twice, but many, many times over the years. Even that I cheated with

Betty. But I want you to know that Kenny and I never had affairs without the other's
knowing and approving and sometimes even participating. So, there it is—the idea that
I went behind Kenny's back is absolute fucking false. I hope this clears up the confusion
in anyone's mind. I did not cheat . . . not ever, not even after Kenny died and all his little

methane bushes had long since been plowed under. Not even after Kenny died and all
his little methane trees had long since been plowed under. End of story. Really.

Dear Friends:

2004 is the 100th anniversary of the birth of Pablo
Neruda. Neruda represents the spirit of our "Dialogue
through Poetry" programs and the vision of the United
Nations. So, we are dedicating March 2004 to the end
of July 2004 to celebrate his legacy and the ideals of
being a "global citizen." We are asking publishers,
reading coordinators, and poets to setup poetry
readings, conferences, and presentations around this
theme. To list your event, please visit our site at:

http://www.dialoguepoetry.org/neruda.htm

Also, we have received encouragement from the Neruda
Foundation. A letter can be found at:

http://www.dialoguepoetry.org/neruda/neruda_letter.pdf

Lastly, we are working with Mark Eisner on promoting a
new collection / translations of his poems titled,
"The Essential Neruda: Selected Poems" (City Lights),
which will be released in April 2004. You can
pre-order the book on our site.

If you have any questions, please email Larry Jaffe at
jaffe@dialoguepoetry.org

Sincerely,
Ram Devineni and Larry Jaffe


=====
Please send future emails to
devineni@rattapallax.com for press
devineni@dialoguepoetry.org for UN program

"Mark Knoller of CBS News, scrupulous keeper of records of presidential
activity, reports that this visit is Bush's 29th to his Texas ranch as
president, so he has stopped at the ranch on all but three of his 32
presidential trips to Texas. Knoller reports that Bush has spent all or part
of 214 days at his ranch. Since New Year's Day was Day 1,077 of the Bush
presidency, he has been in Crawford for one-fifth of the days in his term.
He is scheduled to return to Washington on Saturday."

yeah, to most 12 yr olds i imagine a story about friendship, integrity &
courage during inner & world upheaval would be boring.

i find the notion a little absurd that a story/film rooted in a particular
mythology is obligated to represent other cultures/races in appearance --
and that this 'failure' should invalidate its various & relevant
representations shared in the spectrum of human experience.  it would be
fine to see such a film with any or all races, colors, genders, sexual
preferences, religions, IQs, sizes, etc. but how 'bout encouraging the
creation/production of such rather than attacking a fine production because
of your image requirements...

I've been watching this discussion about LOTR with interest, I have some
multiple takes on it. For a start, I'd say that LOTR is an overblown epic of
bad writing which is slightly reprieved by its appendices, which have
elements of wit. The twitching stereotypicality of its characterisation is
reflected the films, the best features of which are the vistas panoramica
and some special effects. There are elements in the whole Tolkien thingy I
have a particular take on: I, like him, spent most of my childhood in
Birmingham. Although of a later generation than Tolkien I can realise that
parts of the book are about the encroachment of industrial Birmingham on
places like Sarehole Mill, which he loved, in Hall Green, the epitome of
Hobbit-land, where happy beer-drinking small-sized males only (to deminish
the notion of possible aggression, you see) congregated together in
innocence only to be engulfed by the Dark Lands, or Moseley Bog, where most
of the trees were. These were Tolkien's mental landscapes, overlaid by a
study of mediaeval and old english literature. Whether the books are racist,
I am not sure, maybe maybe not, I suspect that from the level of the
literary unsophistication of the narrative portion of the texts he wouldn't
have realised if they were, when I was a kid one of my favourite jokes (by
me) about the book was that it read like 'the Bible rewritten by Enid
Blyton'. Its Brummieness, its parts of my local habitation and etc of
growing up, I do like, I know which trees he liked, I like still the attempt
to repopulate the desiccated mental landscapes of contemporary
liter-realities with them hobbits, dwarves, elves, etc.

So, where are we? It is a great bad book that has produced an even less
curious film about human action than the novel that is also impressive for
its effects. Aii yeah yaa - what does one say!!???!!

Lots of programs that wd benefit large numbers of Americans have been
gutted or stymied over the years and lots of programs that only
benefit "small groups" are routinely extended/expanded. It's not a
matter of headcounts (i.e. those that are tallied w/o regard to class
and political belief), but (predictably) of the movements of Kapital,
although, of c, Kapital spends hard to bluff as many people as
possible into going along with its owners, one of the "small groups"
that Haas refers to.

That one wd prioritize certain "larger" concerns over others is not
surprising, since that's a tactical issue. (An example wd be Ariana
Huffington saying this afternoon that the main issue in the upcoming
election has to be how to make sure that Bush gets kicked out, no
matter whether it's Gephart or Dean or, etc. that does it, altho she
didn't have a reply to someone's comment that Lieberman might be just
as bad.) That any one wd be considered inherently more important,
however, is controvertible. So much of what is considered small
groups' interests, such as relate directly to inmates, the elderly
(small?), children (small?), or undocumented workers, are only a
matter of exercising basic civil rights and obtaining the wherewithal
to SURVIVE.

here is the point-- when programs and movements benefit the whole of society
they are popular and they get democratic support but when programs are
focused on small groups they become the focus of attacks and as we saw with
welfare reform these programs can be gutted.  But gutting Social Security is
not a problem because everyone gets it-- the goal on the left should be
extending rights to everyone.

In a real anthology they pay you. Same thing with, say, construction

Subject:      civil unions YES, gay marriage NO, and my argument WHY
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="US-ASCII"
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

i'm bringing this up because the gay marriage poll has popped up here.

and i've been FLOODED with e-mails about this from friends and family and
some boyfriends whose last names i've long forgotten.

but to be honest with you, no way.  there's no way in hell i'd ever support
gay marriage.  civil unions are of course fine.  civil unions give queers all
we'd need to feel confident that when a lover dies, the homophobic parents
can't clear out the bank account and take all the photographs etc., and kick us to
the street.

but marriage?  the church?  and the hundreds of years with the hundreds of
thousands tortured and put to death?

i met an Italian man involved with a queer task force in Rome.  he says that
EVERY TIME the pope makes one of his ridiculous speeches denouncing gay
marriage or gay adoption, that gay bashing goes through the roof over there!

i've heard the argument over and over about changing it from within.  but
why?  by the time you'd get finished changing it it wouldn't exist anymore anyway!

my experience has been that when queers get in touch with their loving Jesus
that all kinds of nasty things pimple out of them.  sexism in particular, for
instance.  there are so many books written about queers coming "back" to the
church, as though they had ever been allowed in.  and one of the BEST examples
of the WORST kind of behavior i'm talking about happened when i was working at
a queer bookstore and had to introduce authors.  this one guy had written a
book about spiritual warriors, or something.  it's a dark story about his born
again family LITERALLY telling him that even if he killed himself there'd be
no possible hope of them shedding a tear.  that's actually a letter in the
book, from his mother.

the room was filled with about 50 white guys just like the author.  over and
over there were tears shed, these guys saying that they've accepted Jesus as
their savior but the church won't let them!  huh?  anyway, the whole thing just
made me insane.  and at Q&A, one of these born-again-wannabees wiped his
cheeks of tears and asked our brave author if "we need to be worried about the
Promise Keepers."  the author said, literally, "No, they're only interested in
hurting women's rights."  what?!!!  no one even FLINCHED when he said that.  so
i raised my hand, and said, "yeah but, aren't LESBIANS women!?  and aren't
THEY part of the gay and LESBIAN community?  and furthermore, don't we all
realize that there would have NEVER been a gay and LESBIAN movement without the
women's movement?"  because, hey, there were a LOT of lesbians in the women's
movement, and THEY were the ones busting their asses politically later for gay
rights.  some men also, but not at first and never as tenaciously, at least not
until AIDS and ACT UP, or until a gay porn shop or movie house was being
threatened by a city councilman looking for reelection.  of course, it's mostly
wealthier white gay men who are suddenly in charge of everything in the queer
community now (who are shedding just as many tears about not being loved by the
Republican Party, but that's another story for another time).  (in many ways,
similar ways, it always boils down to privilege, and who would have it IF ONLY
they were straight.)

anyway, i know that that's just one example.  and i know there are PLENTY of
wonderful people who are christians and jews and all that.  i'm really not
being a jerk saying that all people who go to church are evil.  i just can't
STAND the idea of standing on all those graves in the name of assimilation.  our
bodies and desires have been controlled and mutated and destroyed for too many
years to let them give the blessing, ever.  fuck their blessing and fuck gay
marriage!

i just don't want the church to be allowed to look THAT good, ever.

let's not forget that gay men were first called faggots during the
Inquisition because so many of them were burned at the stake under the feet of women
(there was a belief that a witch could not burn by sticks "faggots" alone) that
these men became synonymous with the burning sticks.  Joan of Arc had several
gay men working with her (who were also put to death, although i believe they
were hanged), as did many wise women of the age who were caught, and burned
alive.  poet Judy Grahn has a good book about it called ANOTHER MOTHER TONGUE.

so think about this when taking the poll.  there's a box for civil union, not
as popular as the gay marriage box it seems.

it's funny: because it most of the film (most of every
film i guess) was a white white world i hadn't thought
of the absence of anyone who looked like me (as
opposed to say Star Wars where the evil fu manchu guys
were attacking that girl who so clearly stole her hair
and make-up concepts from kurosawa)

(then of course those evil indian guys on the
elephants showed up--that was like indiana jones and
the temple of doom)

what i did notice about lord of the rings is the
beauty vs ugliness thing. i mean there are no
un-stunning elves. the dwarf is the only un-stunning
hero and he's well he's supposed to be crusty and
surly. don't make arguments about the ghosts at the
end being ugly--that's not what i mean. but you knew
that steward was going to be up to no good as soon as
he started eating those cherry tomatoes just like you
knew Faramir would turn out okay at the end because he
was cutie.

the evil on the other hand is always twisted and
misshapen. except i guess Saruman.

even the hobbit actors are getting stud treatment on
the cover of whatever that magazine was.

but in that sense it's not unlike any fairy tale in
which the exterior is used to represent the interior.
evil witch and all that.

of course on the plus side as i keep telling the
homophobic people in my family "God, Gandalf kicks
ASS. And you know what? He's GAY!"

I was surprised to see that no one noticed something very particular about
the "evil characters," and that is that they tend to have either 1) Dreads
or african garb and or 2) Arab and eastern characteristics. Elephants,
drums, and the "evil humans" conspicously dressed with head wraps.

Then, in the rallying speach, Aragon cries out,"Men of the west!" I asked a
friend if this was in the book, and he believed so.

Haas:

Most people who get into national politics are like wood under pressure:
they bend until they can't stand up straight, until the realism we see is
above their horizon, and all they can see is Ground Zero. Most who try to
resist this, like Clinton during his first months in office, quickly become
warped. Sad that the moral, insightful, politician is a rare being. As we
are who we become, the nature of politics itself is the problem, that's
where reform must begin.
Makes me wonder whether Bush really believed he was a "compassionate
conservative," before his brains got twisted into a pretzel. I guess we'll
never know.

True enough, all the foregoing about the orientalism of LOTR. (And I'm glad
to find that others feel the discussion worth continuing.) Scratch the
heroic quest narrative and LOTR is nothing but European race-fantasy from
end to end. A lot like Europe, in other words. If you look at a map of
Middle Earth you'll notice that all the action takes place at the
northeastern corner of what is presumably a much larger mass of land, where
the southerners are very clearly said (by Gollum in T2T) to have "dark
faces." In this connection may be useful to recall that the earliest years
of Tolkien's life were spent in South Africa.

I had an opportunity to watch the extended DVD of T2T over the holidays,
and can report on some material which did not make it into the theatrical
version. After the first engagement between Gondor and the elephant-troops
of Far Harad, Faramir gives a moving speech on the plight of the
southerners as the camera plays over the unveiled face of a VERY handsome
dead elephant-warrior. Also fleshed out is the predicament of the
hill-tribes who give their allegiance to Saruman: they've been pushed out
by the empires of Gondor and Rohan, basically, and have perfectly
understandable grounds for resentment. But these are just palliatives at
best. Peter Jackson is our Wagner, and he knows it. The timing of Gulf War
II (unsubtly exploited by the film's advertisers) only makes it more
dreadfully obvious. If you're looking for a "villain" here I would name
Tolkien himself --him and the millions of devoted readers whose appetite
for primordial race-fantasy he so winningly answered. Number me among them,
but with an asterisk please LRSN

Yes, Yes, but, as I have asked Haas, what makes use of that kind of =
imagery racist as opposed to it's being merely representative of the =
traditional symbols for good versus evil?=20

And don't simply tell me it's racist because it's used...tell me what =
makes using the images in the films racist?  =20

I can only see this symbolism as racist in the context of black versus =
white America; I have no frame of reference nor first hand experience to =
say whether this black versus white conflict exists in other parts of =
the world, so I can't comment on that. =20

For me, efforts from the "Black is Beautiful" theme to shift those =
traditional symbols failed, in part because blacks are not black, they =
are brown...what was wrong with "Brown is Beautiful?"...but mostly the =
efforts failed to shift the meaning of the symbols because the =
traditional symbols e.g. Good is white, Bad is black exist in cultures =
other than those often depicted by Hollywood in Western Europe and =

In practice I of course agree, and I've put my money where my mouth is. In
a better world I'd prefer that all civil marriages (of whoever) were civil
unions and that the term marriage were restricted to religious ceremonies.
That would at least remove some of the confusion around this issue, and
gladden an old atheist's heart.

It may be a bit much to expect most of the US voting public to understand
that a word can have two meanings.

The server's been down at this tiny rural college since Wednesday so I didn't have
a chance to add my two cents on the big issue of race that has come up in two
threads.

This is for Timothy Yu -- the point about Finland is not that it's racist, but
that even in almost perfect societies there are flaws.  I have black hair, and was
thought to be from India.  At night, I often had to outrun drunks who would chase
me and say, Go home, India!  But they do have many of the things that it seems
that the left in this country wants.  However, interestingly, they didn't get them
through the left.  They got them through Lutheranism -- the country is over 90%
Lutheran.  It's the state church, and through its advocacy programs things have
gotten better for women and children (the meek).  Women for instance get ONE YEAR
off to nurse their child at full pay.  They then get THREE YEARS off at 75% pay if
they want to raise their child themselves instead of throwing them into a daycare
program so that they can sit in a corner and cry and become crazy -- which seems
to be the case in this country for so many children..

That just gives you an inkling.  I can't say how the entire society is different.
They have a female president who was head of her gay & lesbian society at U. of
Helsinki.  But that isn't to say that everybody should try to move there.  Because
you'll get your head kicked in, and anyway, the country works on a parallel logic
that is very difficult to grasp.

The point is to try to make something like that happen here.

Now here's something for the Lords of the Ring conversation:  the orcs, who I
believe are evil people, speak a language that is said by linguists to be based on
Finnish.  Finns are the lightest people on earth.  They look like albinos.  The
color of skin is a simple genetic deal:  without sunlight (Finland is totally dark
for twenty-four hours a day in the northern parts, and for 18 hours or so in the
southernmost regions for several months of the year) and so in order to activate
vitamin D, you had to have very light skin if you wanted to survive.  All the
darker skin people tended to die off because they couldn't get vitamin D.

"Race" is a simple Darwinian algorhythm.

If you had dark skin in the north, you died.  Interestingly, there is almost no
genetic basis to race.  Scientists have yet to determine exactly what it is.  It
doesn't appear to be a real genetic marker that determines it.  It's something
like a hundredth of one percent of the genetic make-up of an individual, but even
what it is hasn't been isolated.  They had an article on this in last month's
Scientific American.  This is why we are all considered to be the same species and
can intermarry and yet produce children.

So much has been said since Wednesday on this topic of race, etc., that it is hard
to respond in full, but to go on any longer risks being difficult for the eyes in
cyberspace.  I just wanted to reorient the two conversations -- and throw in the
problem of the orcs speaking Finnish in the original.  Finnish people are the
lightest people on earth, and yet their language is that of the orcs, who as I
recall (I read the book when I was 12) are bad, or else they are sort of bad.
Right?  They are mesmerized by Golum (?), or something, into being bad.  I'm not
going to see the movie.  I only like documentaries.

Maria, this is a very interesting distinction that you've drawn.  I didn't
understand it to be honest, but I wanted to.  How would you say that words are
different from language?  Is Creeley then like an evolutionary half-step toward
the more enlightened Bernstein, with WCW as the mud creature stepping up on dry
land, or was no progression implied?

I confess that I don't know Creeley's work very well.  I hadn't read him except
for a few poems that just seemed so small, or something.  Then when I was working
on my new book on Codrescu, Codrescu kept insisting that Creeley is very
important to him.  He was furious with me for not having read him.  I got the
same thing from Anselm Hollo.  Both insisted that he was CRUCIAL to them.  So
I've been trying to catch up on Creeley, but so far what I most appreciate are
the autobiographical essays.  He wrote one on his year in Finland, for instance.
He mentions that his daughter was killed in a mudslide, or swallowed up in dirt,
in New Mexico.  It was terrifying, and the prose had a very light feeling in it
-- kind of like the cushion of air that supports an air hockey game.  But I still
haven't gotten a handle on the poetry.  I wonder if what you are saying about
words would somehow help me to do this.  I can't separate the term "words" from
the term "language."  Does Creeley do this somewhere?

If anybody can help me, please do.  Is there a book of criticism or something
that would help me to enter into Creeley's poetry?

Check out this little poem, and explain what about it should send my socks
flying.  It is on p. 150 of Selected Poems:

NAMES

Harry has written
all he knows.
Miriam tells
her thought, Peter
says again
his mind.  Robert and John,
William, Tom,
and Helen, Ethel,
that woman whose name
he can't remember
or she even him
says to tell
all they know.

??????  help, anyone?  I've written to Creeley, and he's super-nice.  He told me
some fun facts about Gregory Corso, and has said that at age 78 (!) he was
recently hired at Brown, and they put him through weeks of orientation, which was
unpleasant.  Maybe they gave him a sexual harassment workshop, or something.

I sense this same problem in George Bowering.  Are the two connected?  I'm kind
of outside the loop here.  I do really like Charles Olson.  And one of Creeley's
early poems, about seeing a bird on the lawn, really struck me full force as
great, but I don't even understand his signature poem, "Kore."  Never did.  It's
just too simple or something.  What are the coordinates?

Backchannel is fine to anybody who wants to send a gloss.

Mime-Version: 1.0

the following is an excerpt from a conversation between Paul Murray, an
openly gay Catholic priest and professor at Bard College, and Robert Kelly;
the entire conversation will be published in issue #2 of FO A RM Magazine
later this month.

prehaps something of relevance can be found here.

~

RK: The issue of the gay priest seems, on the surface, to be a question
about homosexuality vs. heterosexuality, where patriarchal heterosexual
tradition abhors and tries to exclude homosexual practice. Isn’t it also,
though, another issue and that is: promiscuity vs. monogamy * because the
typical homosexual relationship in our society, from what I read, is more
sexually active and more socially sexually active than the hetero- one. A
promiscuous priest in any tradition is thought of poorly. Isn’t that partly
the issue: that the gay man is perceived not simply as someone who has a
“male wife,” but as someone who has lots of male “girlfriends,” and who
leads a life built around the quest, not of the one (the Holy), but of the
many?



PM: Yes, that’s a question that’s not really resolved in my mind because
marriage is an institution that clearly is connected to procreation and
rearing of children. And it’s not even been, in many societies, the assumed
locus of erotic fulfillment. So, as it has become a standard form of
relationship that we understand to be moral, many gay people have accepted
this model. Many others have rejected it as irrelevant to their sexuality. I
think that my own personal inclination is to follow the direction of
commitment to a single individual, of love that is without limits, the “no
matter what” love for another person. I can’t imagine – it would be
exhausting to include too many people in that kind of experience of love. I
certainly haven’t thought this through in the way that I think this is the
standard that I want to preach for others. The late John Boswell, great
medievalist of Yale University, pointed out that in so many societies the
same-sex-oriented person was often thought to have a special talent for
religion, and that this has been no exception for Christianity. Convents for
women and monasteries for men have attracted, throughout their histories,
large numbers of same-sex-oriented peoples, and I would say that there are
disproportionate numbers to the general population of gay men in the
ministry, not only in the Roman Catholic Church but in the Anglican
Communion and probably in other churches as well. That’s a question that
I’ve been puzzling over for some time: what is that connection? Is there
some way in which the structure and experience of life of a
same-sex-oriented person tends towards spiritual reflection or spiritual
service that is different form others?



RK: Well, I would say so from my experience, not of being a
same-sex-involved person but in being a sex-involved person. It seemed when
I first came to know homosexual men, (I didn’t know many when I was young,)
what struck me about them, while it wasn’t interesting to me that they liked
one another’s bodies, it was interesting to me that they liked sex. They
were willing to allow their sexual inclinations to define their attitudes
towards life in general. They were willing to be homosexuals in a way that
most heterosexuals could not be heterosexuals. I think it bears on what you
are saying * it seems to me that it’s a matter of the imagination – it’s a
matter of the generosity of spirit and imagination that, if they can
conceive of loving, or just screwing 500 people a year, just having the
imagination to do that, to leap from him to him to him to him, that in
itself represents (though a low level of it) a kind of triumphal imagination
that might reach on to thinking of God after God. So, in that sense, I think
your perception of the innate connection between the homosexual and the
religious is exactly right, and I think that their link is the imagination.
Gay people are notoriously drift into the “imaginative” fields, the arts,
notoriously so.



To come back to the polygamy/monogamy thing, I’ve often thought that gay
people today * well, your Archbishop of Boston came out today strongly
against gay marriage. And there’s a sense in which I wish I too could come
out against gay marriage, too, not because I think gay marriage weakens
marriage in the world (in fact I think it strengthens it, the whole social
institution), I would urge the gay community to set itself against marriage,
not for it – not trying to have this thing. The quest for gay marriage seems
to be almost insane. It’s a quest to limit gay love to ways by which others
have been socially and legally limited.



PM: Well, that’s why I prefer the term “same-sex unions” and that the term
Boswell, in fact, used in his final monogram, “Same-Sex Unions in Pre-Modern
Europe.” He was accused, very superficially and very homohphobically, of
saying, “Well there’s been gay marriage for 1600 years.” That’s not what he
said – he was very careful. And actually, as he points out, marriage itself
in the Western World has taken many forms. Right into the Middle Ages, there
were different forms of marriage. So the idea of duplicating heterosexual
marriage as the appropriate form of relationship for gay and lesbian people
– I’ve officiated at many same-sex unions and the interesting thing about
these ceremonies (at least with the couples that I’ve worked with) is that I
tell them, “Now, there are now rules here. The Vatican has not provided
guidelines. Someday they may have extensive tomes of regulations and
tribunals and so on, but right now they don’t.” So we can do whatever we
want and call it whatever we want and yet 99% of the time the couples choose
the language and the symbolic forms of heterosexual marriage, right down to
the cutting of the cake and placing a piece of cake in each other’s mouths.
It’s clearly quite striking that given this kind of “the sky is the limit,”
they fall back on the traditional. I guess it’s looking for a sort of
legitimacy.



RK: The forms that presumable they either saw their own parents manifest or
wish they had seen manifested. We have all grown up actually with two sets
of parents: the ones we actually have and the ones we imagine we ought to
have because of what we get from media images of the ideal family. In the
tension between the ideal parents and the real parents is where we find
ourselves creating that triangular world that we want to live in.
Interesting * how many same-sex unions do you think you might have
performed?



PM: Somewhere between twelve and fifteen. And I’ve also conducted retreats
for couples. And, I must say that one of those retreats stands out in my
mind as a moment when the experience of the Spirit’s presence was so intense
that I was almost beside myself. It was for both men and women, and I could
say that I’ve probably conducted more same-sex ceremonies for men than
women. Lesbian relationships seem to be of a longer duration. Men have a
hard time staying together. I remember one male couple that, on the top of
their cake, they had a cowboy couple, and it was at a country & western bar
where they had the reception. It was very precious. [Both laugh.] I love
these experiences. I would love to share them with my bishop, with my fellow
priests, to get them to see and to taste some of the world that I have
known, because the Spirit is there so vividly. It is something so wonderful
happening, but they’re not able to see it at this time.



RK: Do you think there are any bishops who might, like the old Polish
National situation or the Old Catholic situation in the 19th century, any
bishops who might one day, either because of their own closeted sexuality or
because of their intelligence, might come out and make some real ecclesial
arrangements at such communions or congregations?



PM: Perhaps, I don’t know. All I see right now is tremendous fear. I know of
people who are quite high up in the church who are gay, though I don’t
necessarily want to use that term – they are homosexually inclined. There
has been conduct along those lines and I think that they are just
overwhelmed by fear and it’s very sad.

This discussion here re: The Lord of the Rings - it's interesting, because
it's kind of an extreme view to try to find race issues in everything (I
realize race issues exist hidden under layers, or maybe not so hidden, in
some works.)

It reminds me of fundamentalist Christians in organizations like Focus on
the Family trying to find little snippets of sex in Disney films - in some
wisp of smoke or something - hey, there's sex.

There's probably some sociologic function involved, since I see it as a
common behavior in both the left and Christian fundamentalism (maybe
oriented around the things they hate or fear) - with the far left looking
for marginalization under every speck of dust; fundamentalists looking for
sex with the DVD on frame-by-frame watching "Snow White."

You can take these things too far, I say, too far.

it seems like the entire question is being missed... this in reality  a
push by the religious right to have bush's constitutional amendment
banning "homosexual marriage" pass... and while I agree the marriage is
a outmode institution, I do not want to see those who would choose have
their rights taken away, by anyone!!. ... I do not care how who votes
for what on this silly christian right survey as long as their point is
subverted... as a matter fact i think it would be funny if a majority
of folks voted for "homosexual marriage".. or more so than those who
voted against it.....

Kirby: This is beyond silly. The French, who certainly didn't get their
social policies from Lutheranism, have similar, if less extensive programs,
as do many other countries. In particular, while they offer generous leaves
to new parents, they also have a superlative government-run day care
system, in which very few children go crazy.

In our own benighted country, where there are few controls, we sent Carlos
to a very carefully chosen day care. He adored it.

I take Brent's point about the futility of looking for racism in everything.

But i do think that evil in LOTR is most often associated with 'foreignness'
and what used to be called 'savagery'. The evil 'hordes' most often resemble
people/creatures from Africa and Asia.  The Indian elephant riders are one
example of this, and i find their appearance in the movie to be very
disturbing.  Hey, some of the bad guys are wearing TURBANS!  And the walls
of Orthanc are black, while the city of Minas Tirith is dove-white.  But
Tolkien was a conservative British author who wrote during the throes of the
British Empire, so I think this is to be expected in his novels, and in
order to do justice to them on the big screen, it might be necessary to
leave all that stuff in.  Other Western authors, such as Forster and Conrad,
were doing the same thing a couple of decades earlier; if you think about
it, even "Apocalypse Now" plays on these stereotypes, portraying the rural
Viet Nam as a place of deep evil, with human heads everywhere.

However, in Tolkien's defense I must point out that Gollum, the Steward of
Gondor, and Sauron are all caucasian. And the Black Riders are unkillable
ghosts of white kings.  So evil is not just 'us and them,' but has the power
to warp any person or creature to its desires.   Tolkien also deserves
credit for being a huge environmentalist. He portrays the cruel
industrialist wizard Sauron overwhelmed by an army of trees.   I think, on
balance, the dark hordes in LOTR are almost forgivable in light of the
glorious Ents.

After watching the movie, I wrote a poem about it --
http://meaningless.com/home.asp?poem=hordes -- a little fictionalized by me
and my own imagination, but at least it shows my sympathy for the poor
elephants.

Sorry, I meant Saruman, not Sauron.  However, Sauron was originally a white
guy, the same fictional race as Gandalf and Saruman, before he became a
Lidless Eye hovering over a tower.

Also, I just remembered Wormtongue, an evil man of Rohan.  I thought Brad
Dourif did a great job with this role.

"Generously catholic in their enthusiasms, Bill Berkson=B9s seamless essays
make every word count. All too many contemporary critics like to lecture.
Berkson, affectionate and critical, is a gifted storyteller who wants to
engage his readers. Putting his prose at the service of art he loves, he is
a great unclich=E9d art writer. The essay on Piero alone is worth the price o=
f
admission." --  David Carrier.


"Bill Berkson's Sweet Singer of Modernism is an indispensable text for
anyone interested in late-twentieth-century culture. As a poet and critic o=
f
these times, as witness and intimate participant, Berkson writes out of his
own taste and experience, but never about it. His devotion to the
seriousness and importance of his subjects is the very essence of modesty
and felicity. As a consequence, his most casual opinion bears the weight of
thoughtful moral authority. This is a wonderful book." -- Dave Hickey.

A friend passed this on to me. I have no other details:



Dear Friends of Cid Corman/Friends,

Last night in Kyoto's Katsura Hospital, Cid underwent a 13 hour
operation to repair heart damage and remedy other problems . . . I don't
know all of the details, but from Shizumi know that his doctors have
given him only a 30% chance of recovery. . . Shizumi asked me to pass on
this simple wish to you all:
"Please pray for Cid."  She's home resting after a second night at the
hospital, very much at her wit's end, as can be imagined, and quite
exhausted, yet also heartened by how much love there is for them both.

I will be in Kyoto the next days and will be in touch with news as there
is news to share. In the meantime, if your situation permits, please, if
possible, set aside some amount, however small, to help with the
enormous costs the Cormans are now facing. Though I'm sure many of you
will want to do this privately, I am working with Bob Arnold and Cynthia
Archer to set up a website from which it will be easy to make a
contribution. We expect to have that set up sometime early next week and
will be in touch with that information as it is available.

In love and hope, Chuck Sandy

why not accord the same rights to all people? Homosexuality is  genetically
predetermined like race and eye color,
Homosexuals should receive every right secular law gives to married
couples-- if churches want to bless only hetersexual unions that is their
right, period

On David Larsen's points, I have this to ask:

But is this racist, David? =20

Your argument supports the issue of explanation for the cause of war =
between the two factions, e.g. the elephant-warrior had just cause for =
taking up the fight, but again, is that racism or is that justice at =
play...those feeling they have been wronged taking up their swords =
against those whom they feel are guilty of wronging them? =20

When, Turkish troops launched their attacks on the kit and kin of =
William Saroyan, basically, two white tribes involved in an ancient =
tribal war, was that an act of racism?  Or, when the Rwandan, Juvenal =
Kajelijeli tried to eradicate the Tutsis in his homeland, two African =
tribes (black on black if you insist) who have fought each other for =
countless generations, was that racism? =20

I could go on with other examples, Albania/Kosovo, Germany in WWII, etc. =
, but I think I've made my point.    Black versus white has no substance =
in symbolism as a "racial" issue. =20

Symbolically, white is light; white is the sun; white is the presence of =
information...we can see it so we know what it is, so we can love and =
respect it.  White is the presence of knowledge and that equates to no =
fear; nothing to fear equates to goodness.=20

And symbolically, black, on the other hand is darkness.  Black is the =
color of the sky at night, the absence of light; black is the unknown =
and the unknown is that which people fear.  And that which people fear =
is an enemy of the people.  Black is evil!

In actuality, the origins of the Good is White, the Bad (evil) is Black, =
symbolism has nothing to do with race or with skin color or with =
culture...all ancient societies feared the unknown and built enormous =
explanations/myths attempting to explain their fears.  The issue that =
black versus white is a "racist" issue is an invention of our modern, =
American and  Western European cultures (and let's not argue "Deservedly =
so" at this point).  =20

Tell me that you are bored with reading or viewing films depicting the =
traditional symbols, and I'll jump into the fray by your side and join =
you in fighting for change.  Tell me those symbols are racist, and I =
think I'll accuse you of failure to do your homework; worse, I may =
accuse you of having been duped by the media into the race versus race =
fray.    =20

  True enough, all the foregoing about the orientalism of LOTR. (And I'm =
glad
  to find that others feel the discussion worth continuing.) Scratch the
  heroic quest narrative and LOTR is nothing but European race-fantasy =
from
  end to end. A lot like Europe, in other words. If you look at a map of
  Middle Earth you'll notice that all the action takes place at the
  northeastern corner of what is presumably a much larger mass of land, =
where
  the southerners are very clearly said (by Gollum in T2T) to have "dark
  faces." In this connection may be useful to recall that the earliest =
years
  of Tolkien's life were spent in South Africa.

  I had an opportunity to watch the extended DVD of T2T over the =
holidays,
  and can report on some material which did not make it into the =
theatrical
  version. After the first engagement between Gondor and the =
elephant-troops
  of Far Harad, Faramir gives a moving speech on the plight of the
  southerners as the camera plays over the unveiled face of a VERY =
handsome
  dead elephant-warrior. Also fleshed out is the predicament of the
  hill-tribes who give their allegiance to Saruman: they've been pushed =
out
  by the empires of Gondor and Rohan, basically, and have perfectly
  understandable grounds for resentment. But these are just palliatives =
at
  best. Peter Jackson is our Wagner, and he knows it. The timing of Gulf =
War
  II (unsubtly exploited by the film's advertisers) only makes it more
  dreadfully obvious. If you're looking for a "villain" here I would =
name
  Tolkien himself --him and the millions of devoted readers whose =
appetite
  for primordial race-fantasy he so winningly answered. Number me among =
them,
  but with an asterisk please LRSN

Notice that I said "race-fantasy" and not "racist." Call it what you will,
LOTR is mainly about race. In its broadest sweep, it's the story of how the
race of men rose to pre-eminence over the elves, dwarves and other vanished
races. Each race is given its mythical origin, language, physiognomy etc.
setting it apart from the others. Some races are clearly subaltern, hobbits
for one. The orcs appear bound to a life of perpetual military servitude;
dwarves (as in the real world) are doomed to serve as comic relief. Is
LOTR's mobilization of these categories racist? For that we'd need a more
precise definition of "racist," and that sounds like a lot of work right
now so I'm going to leave your question hanging.

No, I'm quite fascinated by the symbols, traditional and otherwise. But
let's fight side by side anyway LRSN

Some sad news this morning, from Cynthia Archer (widow of Will Petersen).
She says, "On the sad front, did you know that Cid Corman is in the hospital
after a major heart attack and had surgery yesterday.  He has slim chances,
so we are hoping his stubborn constitution wins out.  If you know of anyone
that would like to know that news, please send it on."

Dear All:

Graham Foust could hardly take more care in his first volume: "As in Every=20

"[F]or the first time in American history the forms, roles, and
functions of 'literature,' of 'American' 'culture,' of 'documentary
expression,' of 'modernism,' of the institutions of 'Art' were
_fundamentally questioned, contested, and redefined in the public
culture at large as well as in critical thought._ During the decade
the most radical and wide-ranging works of (white) American modernism
in literature appeared which, at the same time, laid bare its
aesthetic and ideological presuppositions and inherent dialectic. The
boundaries and approaches of the traditional disciplines in the
humanities and the social sciences and their relationship to public
discourse were challenged and revised. The crisis was answered by new
experimental, often 'interdiscplinary' or strikingly 'impure' modes of
writing and criticism and a new openness to alternative cultural
expressive forms of ethnic or regional groups or of minorities."

This paragraph is from a paper given at a 1988 Berlin Conference of
the European Association of American Studies, published in _Looking
Inward/Looking Outward: From the 1930s through the 1940s_, a title
bearing the copyright of the Amerika Instituut, Amsterdam, 1990. If
the authors of the works given as paradigms for the 'radical
imagination,' Kenneth Burke, F.O. Matthiessen, Caroline Ware, Richard
Wright, Zora Neale Hurston, Walker Evans and James Agee (one line
quoted by the latter: "the cruel radiance of what is"), are
surprising, at least from the perspective of what one reader might
apply to a more recent past, or what another reader might apply to a
future possibility that is only beginning to be imaginable, not to
mention the perspective of another reader for whom the claim of a
'radical imagination' cannot be made for this period and its
journalists, critics, novelists and poets, these and other possible
responses to the disjunction between the discourse and its object
provide a reminder that the view from outside may differ remarkably
from received and accepted definitions within the culture being
viewed, and even depart from a view that can be considered
recognizable. It's the thought of the view not aligning at all with
the conventional perspective, pressing the wish that the 'public
mural' period (all those vast canvases from poets writing then) had a
utopian ('some metaphor for the human') and expressive energy and
drive which might still be salvageable, at least in translation.
Though Gidal notes the "dangers of anti-modernist ultra-Leftism," he
formulates his opposition with these words: "expressionism, neo-or
otherwise, inculcates the imaginary self-identifications that
materialism radically struggles against through its (historical)
dialectic, the latter in terms of both the spectator's sexual and
economic objectivity and, not always separable, individual
subjectivities." (36).

This definition arrives towards the end of a chapter which remembers
Mike Dunford's 'autocritiques': "It was a product of my colonized
consciousness and continues the process of colonization. I hope that
nowadays you will criticize the film and ask the question 'whom does
it serve and how?' I no longer make such films" (Arte Inglese Oggi
1960-1976, Milan, November 1975). (34).

The shadow of the aspect of the 'show trial' dimension to disavowals
is one matter (Gidal mentions that Dunford stopped making films for
seven years), another is the reference in the 'Notes' to the potential
for a militant, or ruthless (depending on the point of view)
avant-garde made by quoting from a 1931 statement:

"If the cinema is to survive it will only be through a few groups
refusing to visit commerical kinos and working out their ideas, as
Kuleshov did, on paper. They will have to be more avant-garde than the
French in 1927, more cut off from equipment than the Russians after
the revolution. They will have to attack the formula and not tolerate
it; they must learn to walk out from pictures that however technically
perfect are based upon false ideas. They will have to make scraps of
film that every commercial producer would refuse and project them on
kitchen walls before small groups determined to tear them to pieces."
Bryher (Winnifred Ellerman), "The Hollywood code II", _Close Up_,
December, 1931, London and Territet. Gidal concludes his chapter on
Andy Warhol's _Kitchen_ (1965) by quoting from his own notes written
for the London Filmmakers Co-op catalogue (1972) on 'Warhol's Couch
(1964, silent)': "The most important of Warhol's early works. A nude
woman on a couch tries to get a man's attention. The woman, Kate
Heliczer, sucks Rufus' nipples. Gerard Malanga sucks Kate's cunt and
asshole. Softcore love, sex avec le couch, et cetera. Later there's
much banana eating, and lovemaking attemps man with man, and vice
versa (?). Other men sit around, walk around, in and out of frame. The
camera is stationary, framing the couch. The girl with enormous tits
tries (vainly) to seduce a motorbike polisher, sweet-sweet nothing boy.
People just sit around. Looking at one another. Looking at the camera,
at Andy, at nowhere et cetera. Stillness. Movement as habit, as
recurrence. No goals. Just there. (Et cetera). With Gerard Malanga,
Piero Heliczer, Naomi Levine, Gregory Corso, Allen Ginsberg, John
Palmer, Baby Jane Holzer, Ondine, Kerouac, and others, some dead, some
alive." (60).

In "the stare of Warhol" does the shock aesthetic of the machined
stare arrive? "That is the place from which the stare is sited, no
humanized self finally left." (61). It might also be remarked that
neither is there any language left.

The catalogue notice might itself invite questions about the extreme
angles that once happened and how popular cultural history remembers
them now, not to mention Gidal's willingness to include casual
descriptions among his more formal theoretical prose.

Exerpts from a recent forward from Roberta Levitow -



Dear Members of the Arts Community,



As some of you know, my son, Adam Davidson is assigned to Baghdad as a
journalist for the Public Radio program, Marketplace. In that capacity,
he recently met Nizar A. Rawi, a graphic designer, art critic, and
president of Baghdad's Contemporary Visual Arts Society (CVAS)-a loose
association of over 250 visual and performing artists.

I was very moved by Nizar and Ali's sense of isolation from the global
art world (their knowledge of American theatre ends with Arthur Miller
and Tennessee Williams). Both men fervently believe in the power of art
to develop a "new vision of peace and unity for Iraq."

During our conversation, Nizar and Ali listed simple ways in which
individual artists and people connected to the arts can help CVAS as
well as more comprehensive ways in which arts organizations can join
together to help Iraqi artists on a larger scale.

WHAT THEY ARE ASKING FOR

Nizar's overriding request from the United States arts community is
communication, information, education, and opportunities for cultural
exchange. His wish list includes requests that can be filled both on an
individual and an organizational level:

Individuals

1. Books, periodicals, CDs, and tapes (PAL, DVD, or VCD format only) of
and about contemporary art of all genres. (See shipping address under
Contact Information below.)

2. Correspondence with individual artists and people connected to the
arts in all genres.

3. Money. Nizar didn't request money. My son did. He wrote me, "CVAS
could use it to set up internet access, develop their library, pay for
their ongoing in-school training, buy arts materials, help fund the
play they're producing next month, etc. Their need is so comprehensive
that one paintbrush would be great."

Organizations

If you or your organization is interested in initiating or
participating in any of the following initiatives, please contact me. I
will serve as point person so that I can coordinate the many responses.

1. An exhibition in the United States of CVAS artists' work after the
war.

2. A joint exhibition

3. Scholarships for CVAS members to study art in the United States.

4. Visiting delegation of Iraqi artists who would come to the United
States to immerse themselves in the contemporary art world by meeting
artists individually and as a group, attending exhibitions,
performances, and rehearsals, visiting studios, etc.

NAMES

Harry has written
all he knows.
Miriam tells
her thought, Peter
says again
his mind.  Robert and John,
William, Tom,
and Helen, Ethel,
that woman whose name
he can't remember
or she even him
says to tell
all they know.


In a way what sends one's socks off are just that creeley's poems can be so
simple, and so confounding, and yet so meaningful, too.Take him literally
here, and as unfolding. So here are the names. The first statement is
simple, yet so altogether impossible and final, that it's rather amazing.
It also sets up a subject-verb pattern, following "Harry has written" with
"Miriam tells" and there you have writing and speech, one final, one
unfolding as it happens. Then there's the way what she tells is "her
thought" and you have that distance between conception and utterance, but
you also have that name, "Peter" that seems to function as the definition
of "her thought" but then, in the process of the poem this is denied, and
Peter is another name or human who is embarking on an action, here like
"tells" but it's "says" and it is happening "again" bringing in the notion
that we always repeat who we are, repeat our minds as "Peter / says again /
his mind." Then a whole string of names, ending in a unit who doesn't even
have a name, so that these very specific names get lost in "woman" or get
lost as part of what one might call the human, because after that we have a
"he" who can't be defined, also a "she," a "him" and a "they." So that, in
the acts of language, identity, which seems to be specific, becomes
communal, in those amazing final four lines where the "again" can't be
remembered, and the "him" may be what "she" says, or it may be to whom she
says it, and in a way the "they" becomes all of us. So there seems to be a
  social and psychological statement or statements going on, all through
these names and simple acts. Maybe this isn't much to you, but to me it is
a poem that knocks my socks off. It's also one I can keep coming back to
and seeing different objects of verbs and objects of prepositions, and
reading in different ways, so it stays alive.

Anselm and Andre are right.

I hope this helps!

sounds like a bad minnesota anecdote.  too much homogeneity isn't too
good; it breeds complacency.  one could have said the same about
denmark some years ago; they thought they were the most tolerant,
wonderful, peaceable, non-racist people in the world, based on their
dramatic mass-organized rescue of "their" Jews in WWII, which was in
fact a thrilling and wonderful thing.  when the euphemistically named
dark-skinned and often muslim "guest-workers" arrived in the early
1970s --to do work no one else particularly wanted to do --danes had
to confront the limits of their complacency and deal with difference.
they didn't turn into violent monsters, but i did hear my sweet
little country-folks aunts and uncles say xenophobic things i never
would have expected, and that in the US would definitely have the
familiar flavor of liberal racism. as for lutheranism as a uplifting
uniting element, the third reich was at least nominally lutheran.  as
for lord of the rings' racialism, what did you (not you, kirby, the
rhetorical you) expect?  most of these ersatz mythic tomes have a
racialist orientation (so to speak); i remember reading the first few
paragraphs of the much-touted Clan of the Cave Bear some decades ago
and recognizing instantly the blond, blue-eyed,
obviously-born-to-lead-the-rest paradigm.  so much for that bit of
treacle.  star wars, same thing.  lord of the flies might be a good
text to read against lord of the rings. or the nat'l lampoon's bored
of the rings, featuring dildo baggins et al.

There was actually a great op-ed piece in the Boston Globe on Saturday
by the executive director of the Log Cabin Republicans, a gay advocacy
group, that explained the issue very clearly.  We need more public
education around this issue and I have to say this is one area where
conservative gay groups can probably step up and do a lot of good.

In practice I of course agree, and I've put my money where my mouth is.
In
a better world I'd prefer that all civil marriages (of whoever) were
civil
unions and that the term marriage were restricted to religious
ceremonies.
That would at least remove some of the confusion around this issue, and
gladden an old atheist's heart.

It may be a bit much to expect most of the US voting public to
understand
that a word can have two meanings.

Here is an open letter i sent to "The Believer" re: Michael Atkinson's
recent article on the Yasusada affair.

Cheers,
Aaron


+ + + + + + +

Dear Michael Atkinson,

I generally agree with everything you say about the direction of our
literary culture in your recent article, "Hyperauthor! Hyperauthor!" It
seems to me important to know who wrote a given essay, play, novel, or poem.
Like you, I don't buy into the deconstructed author or the abstracted text,
at least not in the total form that it has been presented by the likes of
Barthes and Foucault. When I'm reading a Roald Dahl book to my kids at
bedtime, "The Death of the Author" strikes me as a lot of theoretical
gamesmanship.

However, the way you lay into Kent Johnson, calling him a "gold-bricker" and
a purveyor of "pure cock-and-bull," seems a little naive. The trust you
accuse Johnson of betraying didn't really exist in 1996, at least not in as
pristine a form as you imply, and it doesn't really exist today. There's a
good chance it didn't even exist in Shakespeare's time.

Who wrote the footnotes and dedicatory epistle to Spenser's "Shepheardes
Calender"? One doesn't have to swear by Foucault to recognize that "E.K."
was certainly Spenser himself, though he never declared the fiction. And how
does one read Chaucer's notorious "retraction"?  That short bit of writing
would seem to throw his whole canon in jeopardy. Chaucer, in a final
brilliant stroke, proves himself even more radically artful than the tales
themselves reveal. Or does he? As preoccupied with "entent" as he is,
Chaucer engenders multiple interpretive possibilities.

In contemporary literature other examples abound. Philip Levine, by his own
private confession, dressed his autobiographical _Bread of Time_ in
untruths--or emotional truths that are not completely factual. And yet the
book gives the impression of being a non-fictional account of the poet's
personal history. David Eggers made up portions of _Heartbreaking Work of
Staggering Genius_, yet never provides a caveat. How is the reader to
discriminate between fact and exaggeration in contemporary non-fiction?  Is
ascribing one's own real identity to a false work any less unethical than
ascribing a false identity to a real work?

At the very least, Kent Johnson's art should be taken seriously, not written
off as a MacGuffin. What he has done with Yasusada is play according to
rules handed down to him by some of the most revered critics of the 20th
century. You are entitled to disagree with their conclusions just as you are
entitled to disdain Johnson's cubic zirconia text. But I believe he embodies
postmodern authorship in all earnestness, not as the cackling narcissist you
portray.

In the end, isn't all art essentially trompe l'oeil. We struggle to teach a
reality-TV jaded generation that fiction is not a lie; it is, in its own
sense, true. The Yasusada poetry, no matter how many editors felt duped or
expressed outrage, represents a true answer to questions not only raised by
Barthes and Foucault, but implied by media culture. Furthermore, it is not
theoretical -- it really is beautiful art.

That's interesting, David, and chimes much with what I'm trying to work out
myself about whether LOTR is 'racist'. My current thinking is that it is
unconsciously so, even innocently, unlike the clearly racist film of Gone
with the Wind. Tolkien, although a
Brummie, spent the first two years of his life in South Africa, as his dad
was on secondment over there. I imagine that he never took in the realities
of racial subordination at such an early age, Birmingham, where he came back
to, for all its ugliness, is not a place where racism thrives, it is in fact
a city built by immigrants, much on the US mode, that's why we can produce
characters like Benjamin Zephaniah, a good Brummie, even though he lives in
London now, I just don't go no further than Leicester now.

I was listening the other day with fascination to a radio interview with
Francois Pieenar the former captain of the Springboks who won the World Cup
in 1995. He was a marvel to listen to - he knew nothing about the realities
of apartheid despite coming from a middle-class background, there was a
black maidservant but, as he said, he didn't realise she was there, until he
went to university and he was opened to questions other than those of sport,
the result was that he became and remains a passionate supporter of
anti-racism and a devotee of 'madeeba'. It's good to hear such voices.

Anyhow, if Tolkien implies the servants, massa, maybe he hadn't realised
they were there!

Best

Notice that I said "race-fantasy" and not "racist." Call it what you will,
LOTR is mainly about race. In its broadest sweep, it's the story of how the
race of men rose to pre-eminence over the elves, dwarves and other vanished
races. Each race is given its mythical origin, language, physiognomy etc.
setting it apart from the others. Some races are clearly subaltern, hobbits
for one. The orcs appear bound to a life of perpetual military servitude;
dwarves (as in the real world) are doomed to serve as comic relief. Is
LOTR's mobilization of these categories racist? For that we'd need a more
precise definition of "racist," and that sounds like a lot of work right
now so I'm going to leave your question hanging.

No, I'm quite fascinated by the symbols, traditional and otherwise. But
let's fight side by side anyway LRSN

If I may intrude so late in the discussion...

I saw ROTK recently and rewatched TFOTR.

I think Tolkien writes obviously of a time when there wasn't a question at
all of there being races per se, as we know it today, or at least he was
trying to write that way in my opinion. In fact, perhaps, for Tolkien, men,
dwarves, elves, etc. were totally different species, am I right? "You,"
whether "you" were a dwarf, elf or Orc thought "you" were the only species,
or at least, in terms of many "primitive" cultures, "you" thought that "you"
were "THE People." Consequently, "they," the others, were not people. Sounds
racist? (That depends on what you mean by race.)

In other words, similar to what a previous post said with respect to that
South African who wasn't aware of the black maid, Orcs, dwarves, hobbits,
etc. were only aware of each other in terms of fear and ignorance.

(We no longer have the "luxury" to think in those terms.)

Wasn't it a better world in a way? when the world was much smaller as in the
shire being surrounded by vast unknown spaces and it was a fantastic feat to
travel (and this is emphasized more by Tolkien when he has a lowly hobbit as
a great traveller).

In fact, it's a cliche almost that the world is smaller nowadays. It's both
small and big, just like it was for Frodo and Bilbo.

However, the danger lies in the person who sits in front of the TV and reads
the local newspaper and doesn't travel and thus his world is no longer
illimitable but bounded.

Frodo and Bilbo had the advantage of having no TV and newspapers, and for
that matter they wrote their own books!

If we could only be humble in our ignorance of others if indeed that's
possible in this world of signs and symbols.

It's almost an impossibility I think.

For example, Who can tell me if the average person does initially conceive
of Africa as a land of lions and giraffes and elephants on the plains? If
the answer is yes, then is that ignorance?

If only the glowing boob tube was just as indicative of danger nearby as
Bilbo's Sting when an Orc approached.

Writes, Punctuation Book and Finds It's a Best Seller

January 5, 2004
  By SARAH LYALL


LONDON, Jan. 4 - Lynne Truss was on her way to deliver a
lecture at the British Library recently when she was
reminded yet again that a tremendous gap exists between her
natural obsessions and those of other people.

"Punctuation," Ms. Truss replied, when her taxi driver
asked what she planned to talk about. But the word didn't
compute; he heard something less weird in his head. "Ooh,
in that case," he replied, "I better get you there on
time!"

So it has been a shock to the rarefied system of Ms. Truss,
48, that her book "Eats, Shoots & Leaves: The Zero
Tolerance Approach to Punctuation," has become this year's
surprise No. 1 best seller here. Among the legions of the
surprised are the executives at her publishing house,
Profile Books, who ordered a modest initial printing of
15,000 books, but now have 510,000 in print; and Ms.
Truss's friends and family.

"When I was writing it, everybody thought it was commercial
suicide to spend any time at all - even just four or five
months - on it because obviously it wouldn't sell," Ms.
Truss said in an interview. "My mother said, `You have to
get a sticker printed on the front that says, "For the
select few." ' "

There are many possible reasons for the tremendous success
of "Eats, Shoots & Leaves," a spritely volume that leads
the reader through the valley of the shadow of comma
splice; refers to the apostrophe as "our long-suffering
little friend"; makes a rousing case for the semicolon's
usefulness in, among other things, "calling a bunch of
brawling commas to attention"; and describes Woodrow
Wilson's inexplicable visceral hatred of the hyphen, which
he called - spectacularly undermining his own argument -
"the most un-American thing in the world."

It could be that the book is this year's intellectual
stocking-stuffer, the perfect novelty gift for the
chronically hard-to-amuse, akin to last year's "Schott's
Miscellany" or, from 1996, "Longitude."

It could be that bookstore browsers have been drawn in by
the book's cheerful yellow cover, with its droll
illustration of a panda earnestly painting over the comma
in the title, a visual reference to a panda-based joke
about punctuation mishaps.

Or maybe Ms. Truss has indeed touched a nerve of latent
pedantry in a world in which, as she writes, increasing
numbers of people "don't know their apostrophe from their
elbow."

"It's as though one's pointed out that the sky's turned a
different color and everyone thinks, `Yes, I've noticed
that,' " Ms. Truss said, seeking to explain the book's
success. "It's triggered a lot of people's imaginations,
really. I hope they're not going to go around interfering
with other people's punctuation in a horrible way. But
they've become aware that punctuation is quite a good
system for making yourself clear, and that it's been
completely neglected by so many people."

It has been a heady time, Ms. Truss said, speaking by
telephone from her house in Brighton. She has been
interviewed across the British news media, and what she
thought would be a slight, Christmas-y volume has been
scrutinized up and down by reviewers, who have been mostly
delighted, and occasionally jealous.

"Eats, Shoots & Leaves" has been sold with great fanfare to
the United States, where it will be published by Gotham
Books in April. Suddenly, people who once treated Ms. Truss
like a nitpicking fussbudget are taking her seriously.

Ms. Truss has always been a whisperer, not a shouter. Much
as she is aggrieved to the point of physical distress when
she sees a sign advertising "carrot's" for sale, she is not
one to cause a scene. "I think most of the people who care
about these things are not confrontational people," she
said.

But she has had her moments. Writing an article about
apostrophe abuse for The Daily Telegraph last spring, for
instance, Ms. Truss held aloft a six-inch apostrophe on a
stick in Leicester Square, strategically placing it so that
the offensively titled Hugh Grant film "Two Weeks Notice"
became, for a short, giddy interval, "Two Weeks' Notice."
But what was most striking was how few people took her
point.

"Most everyone walking past sort of shrugged and gave the
usual `get a life' kind of response, which I find so
tedious," Ms. Truss said. "It's very belittling. It's
obvious that one doesn't only care about apostrophes."

Pedants may be born, or they may be made, but Ms. Truss -
who prefers "stickler," if pressed - has been one for a
long time. After graduating with an English degree from
University College London, which for reasons of its own has
no comma in its name, she began work as a copy editor at
Radio Times magazine. A series of editing jobs followed at
a variety of arts magazines. Ms. Truss then became a
television reviewer for The Times of London; covered sports
from the point of view of "someone who could take a very
uninformed view," she said; and finally became a
freelancer.

She has published three comic novels, all of which have
sold, Ms. Truss says, "nothing." (Translation: maybe
several thousand copies apiece.) She has also written a
number of plays, some of them set in ancient Rome, for
Radio 4, the BBC radio's highbrow arts channel. "Eats,
Shoots & Leaves," which in the spectrum of such books is
more playful than "The Elements of Style" and less
prescriptive than The New York Times Manual of Style and
Usage, came out of a series Ms. Truss did on punctuation
for Radio 4 some months ago.

The book is dedicated to "the memory of the striking
Bolshevik printers of St. Petersburg," who, Ms. Truss
writes, "in 1905 demanded to be paid the same rate for
punctuation marks as for letters, and thereby directly
precipitated the first Russian Revolution." As for its
title, it comes from a joke that begins, "A panda walks
into a cafe."

The panda orders a sandwich, eats it and then fires a gun
into the air. On his way out, he tosses a badly punctuated
wildlife manual at the confused bartender and directs him
to the entry marked "Panda."

Whereupon the bartender reads: "Panda. Large
black-and-white bearlike mammal, native to China. Eats,
shoots and leaves."

One Train May Be Passing Another

In the next to last car, the countertenor,
trying to pass a variable from one page to another,
sang of his life at sea. I don't know what I'm

doing. Any help will be warmly embraced.
When someone clicks on a link, almost anything
can happen. I'm kind of lost and stuck

at the same time. "Welcome to our abode,"
came to mind, a really good example, found
somewhere there in the first four chapters.

I've tried it like that and it still doesn't work. I don't
know what I'm doing wrong. Can anyone help?
Somehow the countertenor's voice has a built-in

echo, and echo is just echo, print print. The book
doesn't work, and I'd like to know why,
although some of its pages work fine.

Not where I want to be . . . yet! I had this same
problem a year or so ago, but it was on
another line. Let me clarify. Industry-wide

use must count for something, but parse errors
still pile up. Not a big deal, as long as
we're talking about personal use, although

ever since day one the smell of a feed store
has brought tears to my eyes. This was back in
the days when there were so many gas

stations in town that they were almost having to
sell gas to each other. And every moo was
attached to some working farm near a siding.

oh well at least it saved people from multiple-backchanneling them;
thanks Rae. (and thanks for organizing a great reading.)

It turns out that the  Robertson e-dress at wannadoo.fr has those
fatal errors that are going around.  So if anyone has a more current
one for Lisa Robertson, PLEASE send that along.

Thanks

While I think calling Tolkien "fascist" is overdrawn, and don't impute any
conscience racism in the chromatics of different peoples in LOTR, it's
also true that sci-fi and fantasy do work to allegorize colonialism and
race relations.  This is an argument that Walter Benn Michaels has been
made, though when I saw it, he made it about Octavia Butle's "Lilith's
Brood," which is pretty conscious about figuring race through aliens.  In
part, she does it because much golden age sci-fi is unconsciously racist,
since technology is inextricably tied to the West, but also it is a nod to
the originary text of sci-fi, Frankenstein, in which the creature's
difference is both a sign of race as well as class.

For me, the portrait of the hobbits is always Tolkien's saving grace.
They seem little, but not Little Englanders.  And they seem to have man's
propensity to being curious, without the arrogance that comes with
discovery.

yes, Creeley's work is amazing, and anyone interested in contemporary
poetry--the writing of or the reading of--who doesn't know his work
deserves to be rebuked, though that is not in the spirit of Creeley, who
is the soul of generosity as well.

in this example, what I am taken with is how the name lift off, such that
while you momentarily believe the mean Harry, etc, they become "Harry";
the particular becomes abstract, while remaining particular.  nevertheless
I am also charmed that my own name and my brother's name are in the poem.
I have a feeling Robert and William are simply traditional British names
(their conjunction made possible through the transition from Robert the
Bruce to William Wallace), but still...

finally, is it true that Creeley does not revise?  this is rather hard to
believe, but i have heard it said.

I just chanced on a Forum (Micahel Krasney) show this morning with a good
discussion with the author of a new book on Post-World War II Oakland (title
something like, "Babylon: Race etc in Oakland"  (I butchered it!).
Interesting in and of itself (The Berkeley flatlands, North and West
Oakland) were the Center of the Left in America from the sixties into the
seventies (Black Panthers, RCP, etc., etc.)  and, also, a central provider
of right wing reactionaries for the Reagan regime - Casper Weinberger, Edwin
Meese - think Iran Contra and the 90% of Contrelpo's (Sp?) spy and org
disruption programs.

Anyway, folks interested in what's emerging in Oakland both as a center of
new poetry and a place to live, can hear the show repeated tonight at 10 and
catch some good history. I suspect the book is good, too.

Speaking of these times, met an unemployed person yesterday who had recently
applied for a job with Haliburton in Afghanistan as a cook for the Army. 7
day weeks, 12 hours a day for four months straight before getting a week
off, etc. 74,000 dollars (tax free) for a one year assignment.  His job
application review will be complete when they finish his fingerprint
analysis.

A Union job??

Maria, I had no idea that you were Danish or had Danish relatives.  Denmark
and Sweden have a lot more foreign influx than Finland does, and
consequently more problems.  We tend not to hear about those problems here,
but a good dozen foreigners are killed every year in those countries.  Of
course the foreigners also kill the locals, or what I guess could be called
indigenous people.  It goes both ways, and the numbers are about even, I
think, in terms of death rates. Finland has very few foreigners outside of
Helsinki.  A black woman immigrant from Africa was Miss Finland about a
decade ago, and was second in the Miss World contest, and people in Finland
generally like her because she speaks Finnish, and has been faithful to her
husband.  She's one of Finland's biggest stars.  There are 6000 Jews in
Finland, and they didn't give a single one to Hitler, although he asked for
them to be sent to his camps.  They're still there, and they are very
well-represented in the government, and there are several important writers
who are Jewish (Reuben Stiller is the only one I remember).

Personally I suffered there because I like conversations.  I like it when
people think differently from me or else I would go crazy with boredom, so
my closest friends in Finland were French people, who were willing to argue
with me.  I liked the Finns, but they didn't really enjoy arguments it
seems, or had a funny idea of some kind that they were threatening when in
fact they are mostly amusing.

As for Hitler being nominally Lutheran -- he was raised as a Catholic.  Most
of his hierarchy, such as Goebbels, were Roman Catholic.  I don't know if
any of the top leadership were Lutheran.  Probably someone was.  The
Lutheran church held out for a long time in Germany against Hitler.
Bonhoeffer, a leading Lutheran pastor, went back to Germany to deal with the
mess, while his liberal counterpart Paul Tillich rode out the war in the
US.  Bonhoeffer tried to kill Hitler, and was hanged for his effort.

In fact, the Nazis had so much trouble with the Lutheran church that the
Stalinists, in order to thank the Lutherans, left the Lutheran church intact
in East Germany throughout their reign.  An interesting historical study of
this is Robert Goeckel's The Lutheran Church and The East German State:
Political Conflict & Change Under Ulbricht & Honecker.  The Lutheran church
also held out against the Stalinists, and it was the Lutheran church in 1989
that began the shock waves that ultimately brought down the Stalinists
there, according to Goeckel (he is a prof at SUNY-Geneseo's History
Department).

This is not to say that there weren't enormous numbers of Lutherans in the
war effort.  It is ghastly.  They wrote hundreds of books about what God was
asking of them in the battle at Stalingrad, etc.  Who knows.  Although
raised a Catholic, Hitler certainly wasn't Christian.  It would be more
appropriate to characterize him as a vegan.  He loved nature, and didn't eat
meat.  Maybe we could just call him a nut.

But there remains a larger problem in terms of community which Matt Keenan
and Brent Bechtel and others have brought up.  This is the question of what
is a community and what are they founded upon?  Bataille & others said they
were founded upon disgust.  This is to say that precisely what disgusts a
community is what keeps it together.  So the Nazis were held together by
Jews, the feminists are held together by pornography, southern white
communities in the late 1950s were held together by their hatred for blacks,
the Christian right is held together by its distaste for homosexuals, and
probably much of the gay community is held together by its hatred in return,
and so on.  The College of Sociology posited in fact that there was no OTHER
community than a community founded upon disgust.

Finns were largely held together by their hatred of the Soviet Union and the
Swedish, and I wouldn't say that they are more racist than any other
country.  Probably much less.  The people who beat folks into the ground in
Helsinki and the other large cities are losers in those cities.  They are
threatened by the foreigners.  Often poor in school, and unable to compete
for better jobs, they are the ones who stand to lose the most with incoming
people.  The ones that I was chased by were obviously neo-Nazis -- they had
Swastikas on their black jackets, and were clearly as dumb as dirt.  They
didn't even know that Hitler also planned to erase the the Slavs after he
was done with the Jews, and he counted the Finns as Slavs.  So in a sense I
pitied them for wearing the Swastika.  Hitler was also wrong, because the
Finns appear to have come from a Mongoloid race in Siberia, so far as
language tests have been able to determine anything much about immigration
patterns.  The only language that is much like theirs are tiny Siberian
tribes, and Hungarian.  But at the same time, I think this problem of race,
as Matt Keenan points out, has gotten worse as more people can live together
in close proximity.

Perhaps the inculcation of a greater sense of humor would be a benefit.  If
all communities are based on hatred for an Other, then we are in for a
pretty hellish time of it.  I posit that in academia and in left circles
they are held together in fact by naming other people as racist or sexist or
classist or whatever.  The tensions that everyone feels are therefore
projected on to another group or person (George Bush is probably more
multicultural than most so-called multiculturals in that he can speak at
least one other language and yet he and his clique are a lightning rod, but
I think they are probably better integrated than most academic departments
at least in terms of race and gender).

But hatred for Bush keeps whole groups together, and perhaps hatred is all
that we really have to work with, if Bataille and the College of Sociology
were right.

(i've been away with no internet access since my original post)

if i'm wrong, then please educate me, but from what i've read, civil unions
would
allow the same legal, binding rights to couples as would marriage.

am i wrong about this?  if i am, let me know, i'll then think further on the
issue.

i understand that plenty of couples (straight) get "married" at city hall
(for instance)
which of course has nothing to do with BEING in a church.  on the other hand
it
is clear that "marriage" is very much affirmed by the church body as an
institution
which upholds standards and beliefs put forth by scripture.

this is why i prefer civil unions.  i also hear what kari is saying, and i
agree with
the framework of the idea that it's good to oppose the Right, especially when
it's
dealing with very basic human needs like protection, insurance, taxes,
adoption,
i understand all this.  but to me it just leaves a bad taste in my mouth
because
of the fact that the church is very much involved in the idea of what
marriage is.
to me it's like asking a Jew to read Mein Kampf and LIKE IT!

of course i don't know what many other religions have to say about same-
sex unions.  but in America, it's pretty clear that the ruling tongue speaks
of Christ, the God on our money is NOT meaning Shiva or Shango.

yes, i see the idea of opposition by making them give us marriage licenses.
but in the end, this form of assimilation is horrific --to me-- because it
asserts
that their ideas of "abomination" must also be swallowed.  but maybe
it's just me who thinks this.  call me crazy, i'm used to it already.

thanks for sharing your many thoughts (and that RK interview),

Charles, thanks for this.  Really, I liked your effort.  My socks have not
budged yet, but I got a lot from your post.  Most of the backchannel efforts
told me that they loved that Creeley's words were surrounded by an
incommunicable spirit, or something.  I could understand this coming from
Murat, but not from some others, who I didn't think believed in spirit, so it
confused me.  Dale Smith wrote a long piece, and suggested some outside
reading, and this might help.  I don't know why, but many people such as Robert
Corbett say the work is "amazing," but fail to put any effort into exactly
why.  In fact, this is what Anselm and Andrei did to me.  If you don't get it,
you should have your head taken off with a shovel.  But now watch your socks
carefully, and then tell me if they actually do move after reading this --

ECHO

Back in time
for supper
when the lights

(Selected Poems, p. 297)

Now that's a whole poem.  Compare Ode to the West Wind.  Is this a great
canonical poem that will help young people get a sense of the best that's been
written, and figure out how to deploy rhetorical skills within their own
lifetimes for fun and profit?  Does it compare to a Shakespeare play?  What
would Aristotle think it?  It has no plot, no characters, no theme (?), no
sense of spectacle, it isn't necessarily musical, and um, it's not clear what
he's saying.  Hit me with a shovel, but enlighten me, please!  Why is this one
of the best poems of the 20th century??

How would it compare to say Amiri Baraka's Who Blew Up America?  Does anyone
rank poems any more?  Is Baraka's poem more worthy of being kept, or this one
by Creeley?  Keep in mind that very few poets can be kept in print due to the
tiny volume of buyers, and after these guys are gone, there will have to be a
rationale of worth.  I WANT TO LIKE CREELEY!

Right at this point I think Baraka's poem is more likely to be kept around.
It's a litany of the black left's historical grievances.  I even figured out
the  Jeffrey Dahmer line last night.  He's saying that Dahmer is completely
insane, and anybody who couldn't see that, isn't, so in a sense he's indicting
the entire judicial system from the judges on down to the locksmith.  You can
agree or disagree with Baraka's poem, and you can work with it from a
historical viewpoint in a class.  Introducing this poem to a class, what on
earth would you say to a group of sophomores who know nothing about poetry to
introduce them to this poem?  the best thing I've read is Charles' idea that
"identity becomes communal" after all the names are listed.  I really liked
that idea, and it helped open the poem to me some.  A crack.  But these poems
are tough pistachio nuts to crack indeed, and I don't think any of my
sophomores would survive them.  The dropout rate would be 99%.

Famous in their own minds. "The" center might be pushing it a mile or two
over the edge. How about SNCC, the Weather Underground, MLK, SWP, need I go
on? But of course "a" significant center, since Wobbly times.

This doesn't apply directly to Creeley, but the nature of the discussion
here made me think about careers and prominence - so if it's a tangent, it's
a tangent - (it's something that's been on my mind anyway.) The aspect of
having to learn why the work is important (not self-evident) comes to mind;
I realize that education into the facets of an author's life and work
sometimes make all the difference.

Here goes:

I wonder at the value of timeliness, posturing and associations with other
writers -

If by chance a writer's works aren't really good or profound, what could
cause the works to be regarded as such?

Maybe if an author can manage to be timely, and knows the right people to
promote their work and review it glowingly, they can get away with writing
opaque, simplistic, otherwise marginally-valuable poetry and send everyone
scrambling to analyze it for its inherent extra-deep meaning.

An author's work could also be the embodiment of certain artistic and
philosophical ideals (timeliness involved) too, and that might raise its
value over the actual quality of the writing.

After a while there might be a tendency to not question the inherent value
of the work, and out of fear of not being "in the know", there's pressure to
feign understanding.

You probably wouldn't gain preeminence as a patron saint of poetry this way,
but who knows?

From David Bircumshaw:  "...My current thinking is that it is
unconsciously so, even innocently, unlike the clearly racist film of =
Gone
with the Wind...."

Fascinating points here, David...at least to me. =20

On one level, I read what you wrote to mean that racism can be present =
in text and come from the conscious level as well as from the =
unconscious level of the intellect of the writer, perhaps by virtue of =
the writer's associative and unconsciously adopted elements from his or =
her environmental experiences.  Interesting...does that mean I am more a =
product of my life experiences than of my genetic code?  I am what I =
eat...fish or fowl, or foul? =20

And on a second level, I read what you wrote to mean that: it is racism =
whether it was intended by the writer as such or not, so long as the =
reader says it is.  In effect, you transfer meaning to the reader rather =
than to any intent on the part of the writer. =20

I think I can readily concede the point that meaning rests ultimately =
with the reader, and that if enough readers agree there is a point, e.g. =
racism, in a given text, it is present whether or not the author =
intended it, but I don't know if I can accept that means the writer is =
therefore guilty as charged of being a racist.  The conclusion requires =
me to make a rather giant leap; I don't feel comfortable making that =
leap, yet.=20

  That's interesting, David, and chimes much with what I'm trying to =
work out
  myself about whether LOTR is 'racist'. Brummie, spent the first two =
years of his life in South Africa, as his dad
  was on secondment over there. I imagine that he never took in the =
realities
  of racial subordination at such an early age, Birmingham, where he =
came back
  to, for all its ugliness, is not a place where racism thrives, it is =
in fact
  a city built by immigrants, much on the US mode, that's why we can =
produce
  characters like Benjamin Zephaniah, a good Brummie, even though he =
lives in
  London now, I just don't go no further than Leicester now.

  I was listening the other day with fascination to a radio interview =
with
  Francois Pieenar the former captain of the Springboks who won the =
World Cup
  in 1995. He was a marvel to listen to - he knew nothing about the =
realities
  of apartheid despite coming from a middle-class background, there was =
a
  black maidservant but, as he said, he didn't realise she was there, =
until he
  went to university and he was opened to questions other than those of =
sport,
  the result was that he became and remains a passionate supporter of
  anti-racism and a devotee of 'madeeba'. It's good to hear such voices.

  Anyhow, if Tolkien implies the servants, massa, maybe he hadn't =
realised
  they were there!

  Notice that I said "race-fantasy" and not "racist." Call it what you =
will,
  LOTR is mainly about race. In its broadest sweep, it's the story of =
how the
  race of men rose to pre-eminence over the elves, dwarves and other =
vanished
  races. Each race is given its mythical origin, language, physiognomy =
etc.
  setting it apart from the others. Some races are clearly subaltern, =
hobbits
  for one. The orcs appear bound to a life of perpetual military =
servitude;
  dwarves (as in the real world) are doomed to serve as comic relief. Is
  LOTR's mobilization of these categories racist? For that we'd need a =
more
  precise definition of "racist," and that sounds like a lot of work =
right
  now so I'm going to leave your question hanging.

  No, I'm quite fascinated by the symbols, traditional and otherwise. =

The "center" depiction came from the author of the volume and I don't think
it was met in any chauvinistic sense (the author teaches at Wisconsin - I
think - and Madison is much in the 60's Rev Center lit/movies right now).

That said, this particular Berkeley-Oakland Geography tied together an
interesting configuration of local Elder CP and Union activists from the
Thirties, progressive academics, UC and Laney Community College Civil Rights
and Anti-War Activists, the Black Panther Party, KPFA Radio and the Berkeley
Barb  and a cast of emergent middle class African-American graduates
entering Oakland and Berkeley City Politics, Model Cities, the Law
profession, etc. etc.  A lively cauldron-multi-log that had ripple effects
all across the country ("Beserkeley" became B's nom-de-right wing plume).

In fact part of the argument of the volume is that though on one hand
African-Americans took power in Oakland, it was a "hollow prize."
California's Prop 13 essentially and drastically reduced property tax money
so that the Cities such as Oakland could no longer finance the services
which served white folks before they migrated to "garden suburbs" - where
funding was various with the wealth of class into those suburbs (say wealthy
Lafayette versus Milpitas). Or Marin County's great Library system versus
San Francisco's, for another sad example.

Now "poor" Uncle Arnold is going to have to figure out away to make up for
Bush's tax cuts for the rich etc. - or else further cut services to the
Cities and the poor.

Mars might be pretty but its empty landscape might serve as metaphor for the
current state of financing for the well being of the country, including this
Administration's well known love for the arts (e.g., try being an
international artist trying to cross "our" borders).

Oh well, the more a country looks like a desert- complete with fasting - the
more privy and access, legend has it, to religious visions of a particular,
flaming sort.

My relationship with James Lowell spans a quarter of a century.  He was an
urbane, droll and thoroughly enjoyable person.  After he moved out of his store
in Cleveland, following the D.A. Levy legal debacle, he sold his W.C. Williams
collection to Kent State University in order to put a substantial payment
down on a beautiful country property.  He ran his book business on the ground
level of the house.  The upper level was given over to living quarters and his
wife's beauty parlor.  Visiting the bookstore on a Saturday cars would be
continually juggled to accomodate Tessa's clients and the one or two of us talking
books and literary gossip with James.

Tony Green--if you're out there--you might remember visiting him with me many
years ago.

The last time I saw James was at the Creeley reading at Kent State a year or
so ago.  We hadn't seen each other for quite a while and he was politely
pissed about me not visiting (it's an 80 mile round trip so we'd kind of drifted
off).  Yeah, I feel guilty.

But many great conversations and visits with him over the years. I'll miss
him very goddamn much.

Tom Beckett
Some sad news to report.

James Lowell, the proprietor of the Asphodel Bookshop, died at his home
outside
of Cleveland yesterday morning at the age of 71. Lowell may best known for
being arrested with his friend d.a. levy, whose books Lowell distributed, in
1967 for distributing obscene materials. The Asphodel has continued as a
Bookshop and mail order catalog to this day.

I'm still wrangling with myself about these issues, Alex. The background to
it all is Birmingham, the real and shoddy birthplace of the First Industrial
Revolution, the one which made the global economy possible. I grew up there,
and speak in its dulcet tones, as possibly did the Elizabethans, of a kind.
Imagine that Shakespeare would have sounded somewhat like the Osbournes,
it's quite probable. Tolkien's book is an epic about the growth of
Birmingham, it is 'Mordor'. An epic full of stereotypes. I've met his
grandson, as twitchingly a bundle of stereotyped middle-class reflexes as
one could imagine, while his great-nephews are charms, as loveably
hobbit-like persons as could exist. So, paradoxes.

I'm still pondering it all with myself.

From David Bircumshaw:  "...My current thinking is that it is
unconsciously so, even innocently, unlike the clearly racist film of Gone
with the Wind...."

Fascinating points here, David...at least to me.

On one level, I read what you wrote to mean that racism can be present in
text and come from the conscious level as well as from the unconscious level
of the intellect of the writer, perhaps by virtue of the writer's
associative and unconsciously adopted elements from his or her environmental
experiences.  Interesting...does that mean I am more a product of my life
experiences than of my genetic code?  I am what I eat...fish or fowl, or
foul?

And on a second level, I read what you wrote to mean that: it is racism
whether it was intended by the writer as such or not, so long as the reader
says it is.  In effect, you transfer meaning to the reader rather than to
any intent on the part of the writer.

I think I can readily concede the point that meaning rests ultimately with
the reader, and that if enough readers agree there is a point, e.g. racism,
in a given text, it is present whether or not the author intended it, but I
don't know if I can accept that means the writer is therefore guilty as
charged of being a racist.  The conclusion requires me to make a rather
giant leap; I don't feel comfortable making that leap, yet.

  That's interesting, David, and chimes much with what I'm trying to work
out
  myself about whether LOTR is 'racist'. Brummie, spent the first two years
of his life in South Africa, as his dad
  was on secondment over there. I imagine that he never took in the
realities
  of racial subordination at such an early age, Birmingham, where he came
back
  to, for all its ugliness, is not a place where racism thrives, it is in
fact
  a city built by immigrants, much on the US mode, that's why we can produce
  characters like Benjamin Zephaniah, a good Brummie, even though he lives
in
  London now, I just don't go no further than Leicester now.

  I was listening the other day with fascination to a radio interview with
  Francois Pieenar the former captain of the Springboks who won the World
Cup
  in 1995. He was a marvel to listen to - he knew nothing about the
realities
  of apartheid despite coming from a middle-class background, there was a
  black maidservant but, as he said, he didn't realise she was there, until
he
  went to university and he was opened to questions other than those of
sport,
  the result was that he became and remains a passionate supporter of
  anti-racism and a devotee of 'madeeba'. It's good to hear such voices.

  Anyhow, if Tolkien implies the servants, massa, maybe he hadn't realised
  they were there!

  Notice that I said "race-fantasy" and not "racist." Call it what you will,
  LOTR is mainly about race. In its broadest sweep, it's the story of how
the
  race of men rose to pre-eminence over the elves, dwarves and other
vanished
  races. Each race is given its mythical origin, language, physiognomy etc.
  setting it apart from the others. Some races are clearly subaltern,
hobbits
  for one. The orcs appear bound to a life of perpetual military servitude;
  dwarves (as in the real world) are doomed to serve as comic relief. Is
  LOTR's mobilization of these categories racist? For that we'd need a more
  precise definition of "racist," and that sounds like a lot of work right
  now so I'm going to leave your question hanging.

  No, I'm quite fascinated by the symbols, traditional and otherwise. But

_____THE DISCRETE SERIES @ 3030______

presents William Fuller ::  Michael Bernstein


[William Fuller grew up in Barrington, Illinois. He received his Ph.D. from
the University of Virginia in 1983. For the last twenty years he has worked
at The Northern Trust Company in Chicago. He is the author of Byt, Aether
and Sugar Borders among others.

Drawing equally on Buddhist sutras and country blues, William Fuller's
Sadly, Flood Editions, 2003, derives compassion from its ironic vision.
Quick and sometimes elusive, these poems observe fluctuations in the
weather, economic markets, and human consciousness. In the Chicago Tribune,
Maureen McLane has written of Fuller=B9s "dense, elliptical meditations,"
finding "luminous images that consistently marry the cerebral and the
sensual."]

[Michael Bernstein is a Chicagoland native presently living in Boulder, CO
where he'll complete an MFA in Poetry at Naropa later this year. His poetry
has appeared in the journals New American Writing, Columbia Poetry Review
and Conundrum.]

Too much Ashley MacIsaac this evening - it's his first cd, and hard to
discern his future direction - in any case, it's crystal, a bit cold -
next day now and going to the doctor shortly. finished Saikaku, reading
parts of Dylan Thomas' Quite Early One Morning. As usual not feeling well.
Did a piece from spam - it did go through. The more spam avoids filtering,
the greater the degree of language experiments. And literal experiments -
trying to avoid the filters. This is the new Finnegan's Wake of late
capitalism, driven by the marketplace, but internally playful.

So a literature is created out of necessity.

Of course for it to be literature, it must be read as such (reception
theory). This is bleary, exhausted, and goes through all the usual theory
channels.

And I'm bleary. Spent last night also reconfiguring the Zaurus. It works
better than ever. Last night Azure and I married Britney Spears.
I originally wrote 'maried' ha - ha.
So I'm supposed to review Shaviro, but I don't have the original letter
and nothing accompanied the arrival of the book. Still reading Mike
Davis' Dead Cities. Everyone seems fascinated by the turn spam has taken -
why?

For one thing it's a process of natural selection - did I already say
that? What produces returns, returns. It's a question of identity, not
equivalence, the same must return to the same, in which case the mutation
is successful. Otherwise the language stretches farther out on a limb,
there's always new testing going on. There you are.

Here I am.

Hi - I just received a copy of shaviro's _connected_ to review - but I've
lost the review information! If I'm reviewing it for you, please write me
back-channel. Consider this either Alzheimer's or holiday depression, and
thanks and apologies - Alan

The fusion of non-believers.


Bloated e-mail attachments talk talk talk progress
but do not receive or decide or anticipate

Here there are only legislatures pockmarked by compromise;
forced to establish nothingness on your screen

Where you will be left for three decades questioning
the published reality

This is simply a way to define the costs --
an outcome in a world
that ate dinner with the toolbar.

Sad news on the Brit-Po list that Jeff Nuttall has died. In addition to
his poetry, he taught in some fine arts programs and was a working
character actor. Here is a link to his Selected Poems, available from
Salt:

http://www.saltpublishing.com/books/smp/1844710130.htm

His page on the Internet Movie Data Base:

http://us.imdb.com/name/nm0638346/

I went through the four anthologies I have of British poetry (the Tuma,
Floating Capitol, Other and the 1971 special issue of TriQuarterly) this
morning and was surprised to discover that he seems not to have been
included in any of these.

My response a few days ago to posts by Kirby Olson and others on
divisions or "separatism" within the left was not meant to suggest
that Kirby or anyone else was actively advocating the expulsion of
all minorities from the U.S.  But it was meant to suggest that much
of this discussion seems grounded in a nostalgia for a culture free
of conflict and difference--a nostalgia that is being expressed
largely, here as elsewhere, through an anxiety about the "foreign."

So while I appreciate Kirby's efforts to clarify his position in
response to what I said, I'm still disturbed by statements like
Kirby's from yesterday ("Denmark and Sweden have a lot more foreign
influx than Finland does, and consequently more problems"); or, in
the parallel Lord of the Rings discussion, something like Matt
Keenan's suggestion that Tolkien writes "of a time when there wasn't
a question at all of there being races per se...Wasn't it a better
world in a way?"

I guess I am "misreading" Kirby's, Haas Bianchi's, and others' posts,
in the sense that they are motivated by the ostensibly larger goal of
articulating a unifying strategy for the American left; but what I
can't help continuing to see is the ways in which such discussions of
disunity tend to regard racial, gender, and sexual difference as
somehow responsible for the left's divisions.  Kirby's
position--that, say, a lesbian and a Black Muslim could not even
speak to each other--strikes me as far more pessimistic and
essentializing than anything an activist of either group might
believe, if only because members of such groups don't enjoy the
luxury of leading entire lives untouched by those who are not like
them.

In short, the logic that blames minority or feminist groups for the
left's disunity is perverse: ethnic and feminist activism arises
precisely because such groups have previously been considered outside
political discourse, and "identity politics," however maligned it may
be now, has to be understood as a response to a political system that
first constructs racial, gender, and sexual categories and then fails
to extend citizenship equally to all of them.

What we've seen over the past three decades is not some kind of
splintering but an emergence of new groups and sources of energy on
the left, along with the sometimes difficult process of understanding
how, if at all, such new organizations can work with more hidebound
ones like the Democratic Party.  It's often claimed that contemporary
college students are politically apathetic and inert, but I think it
would be more accurate to say that students are much more likely
today to become active around specific issues--the environment,
university labor relations, affirmative action--and the left has to
embrace this new landscape and form coalitions across it rather than
bemoaning it and waiting for the emergence of a new political
messiah.  The Dean campaign, driven in part by opposition to the Iraq
war but now sprouting tables and buttons on campuses everywhere, is a
great example.

Finally, I'm glad Kirby brought up Charles Olson.  What's most
interesting to me in Olson is not those moments where he's trying to
hold it all together (in Poundian, authoritarian fashion) but those
more diffuse moments where the poetic landscape turns into a kind of
map you can wander around in without being told where to go.  It's
less the epic and assimilative than the local and personal--thinking
through, rather than somehow beyond, identities--that appeals to me
in Olson's work--the sense of working in a very particular (even
marginal) place and situation, and that you can't write a Republic
without sitting in a little gloom on Watch-House Point.

LOTR uses the term "race" to denote species, not race in the sense that
nervous white American university types in dashikis hold it.  Orcs,
hobbits, elves, trolls, etc., are never passed off as human in LOTR.=20

"Race": as in the race of men, the human race, a race that knows no
different between different walks of man. =20

If you misunderstand that, it's your own race-nervousness that you're
reading, not Tolkien's.  His story, your interpretation. =20

Humans, just as the other species in LOTR, are described as fatally
flawed.  Remember the struggle of LOTR: man's worst enemy is himself, in
particular, his own lust for power.  White black yellow brown red orange
green purple pink and gray, it's the same struggle, isn't it?  I think
warning against power-lust is a good lesson, and definitely has
ANTI-racist implications.  More importantly it has anti-selfist
implications. =20

If the LOTR is racist, then who do the hobbits represent, the Irish?
Short, happy, cute, friendly, living in a lush green boggy place, love
to drink?  I'm really a Hobbit, metaphorically speaking?  So Tolkien
"the racist" thinks that the Irish, the inhuman Irish, saved the world?
Hmmm.

Oh, so Tolkien's "unconsciously" racist?  And bringing up this very
topic is NOT "unconsciously" racist?

In literature, the West is typically the land of death, the land of the
setting sun.  As I understand it, and correct me if I am wrong, the sun
sets in the west for all races of men, not just the English.

Now what drives me batty about the LOTR is that it has this na=EFve =
sense
of us vs. them, an unambiguous sense of good and evil.  In our world,
with the sole exception of the unambiguously evil Bush Administration,
good and evil are largely perspectival, relative, convenient, ambiguous.
But then, I guess it's reasonable, or at least a decidedly beneficial
convenience, to consider anything that threatens the human race "evil."
Like the Bush Administration.  So I can't even criticise Tolkien on that
dimension.

It IS clear, not merely metaphorically clear, that the LOTR is
anti-industrialist and anti-slavery.

But, c'mon, let's face it, the very discussion lacks the barest thread
of credibility.

I never met James Lowell, but during the 60s and 70s I bought most of

Come on, Patrick, the very symbolism suggests a certain bad faith about
race.  And the fact that Tolkien was born in South Africa is even
more suggestive.

As far shifting race into "species," this is exactly how one makes the
question unnerveracking.  Race, not being biological, but actually
sociological, is nervous making category because it is by definition
unstable.  To make it the biological category of species then renders it
stable.  To say that Tolkien wasn't messing with these ideas during the
period of the Nazis and eugenics is naive.  He almost couldn't help
himself. The fact that the Hobbits may be irish doesn't exempt Tolkien
either.  The concept of labor aristocrats works for race as well.   And
its rather bigoted to say that because one likes one other, therefore you
like them all ... when the logic actually is in reverse.

Where I get off the bus on this question is the fact that Tolkien works in
racialist imagery doesn't mean he shouldn't be read.  Nor that there is
exactly a clear message about race, nor that it is the most interesting
aspect to the book.  For me, it is the simplicity of the struggle, it's
either/or ness, as well as its implicit resort to authoritarianism that
bother.  Tolkien was not a fascist, but he wasn't a Taoist either.

I don't have time for the books anymore. Proust, among others, calls.  But
the film is a great achievement, which cannot be wished away regardless of
politics and the transgression of translation.

Kirby, as I think I told you backchannel, Creeley has increasingly since
Pieces written in sequences. The piece you quote is the 23rd and last of
the first of four cumulative sequences in Memory Garden, which as a whole
is through-composed. I suggest that you read it in that way--all of its
resonances will ring out loud and clear. To read it alone is like plucking
a random three lines out of any sequence.

Hopefully Creeley will be with us for some time yet, but it's hard to
imagine his work becoming obsolete--he's in formed too many of us too
profoundly.

But on this rock of limited duration that's a strange criterion to apply.

Thanks for putting this up, Timothy. K O's 'colorless' point of view
continues to strike me as a blind sink hole, which, at its best (on this
list), works as a counterfoil to ignite refreshing, multi-centric
evaluations - such as the one  you present here.

Just as codicil, irrespective of Tolkien's intentions, Peter Jackson's =
rendition makes it clear that it's the "humans" versus the bestial =
forces of "evil" - the sludge-birth of the orcs is testament enough - =
and so when the final battle for Middle Earth transpires and other =
humans in Middle Eastern and African garb appear, chucking spears and =
spurring on elephants, hellbent on doing the Eye's vile will to oppose =
the principals of goodness the fellowship represents, it's redolent of =
some pretty overt racism. I think Jackson's version also betrays the =
moral center of Tolkien's tale as I remember it - wasn't it the hobbits' =
ability to forgive Golem, a murderer and debased, covetous creature, his =
tresspasses the reason for the eventual redemption of Middle Earth and =
humanity? Must have missed that in the movie.=20

Basically I agree with Mark, although I find that diving into Creeley's
individual parts of poems, slippages if you will, is also a fine thing to
do. To have a poet who specifically does not have the criteria of
Aristotle, Keats, and Shakespeare (is that really what you want for the
present, Kirby? -- not implying at all that I don't love to read Keats and
Shakespeare, and to consider Aristotelian thought now and then, although I
don't want it to rule me or my notions of what matters in literature) can
be valuable, too.

But back to this particular part of a Creeley poem -- it's very carefully
done, so that ECHO functions as a title (even if a title of a part of a
poem) and the word immediately following it is "back," so there's a little
language trick. Where Keats and Shakespeare might do a lot with imagery and
metaphor, Creeley does a lot with line endings and syntax, even here where
the syntactically equivalent "Back in time" and "when the lights" sandwich
(sorry for the bad pun) the "for supper" in the middle. You also get a lot
of movement among kinds of thoughts, with the abstraction of the first
line, the down-to-earth nature of the second, and the third could point
back (echo) to the abstract, although that depends on how you read "lights"
-- what kind of lights, etc., and the fact that Creeley leaves it hanging
means it's rather open to all kinds of possibilities -- this strikes me as
something more than ambiguity. Positioning is generally crucial in
Creeley's work, too, and I'm not surprised that in this 8-word piece, three
words are prepositions, and a fourth ("Back") is also a word that has to do
with positioning. And while the poem doesn't seem very formal, it is in
some ways entirely regular, with three syllables per line, a vowel end
rhyme in lines 1 and 3, and a kind of muffled sound "the "r"s in "for" and
"supper" in line two between the brighter, more resounding sounds, around
it. All of this, and probably more, yet still seeming so off-handed,
casual. So while everything in the poem supports a reading of it as a
description of a simple coming home to dinner when the lights are getting
low, its specific care both calls our attention to the constructedness of
such a routine, as well as to its openness, and to its vulnerability.

I have absolutely no inclination to compare something like this to "Ode to
the West Wind" or to a Shakespeare play? Why do you think we should? I'd
suggest, as you are developing your own thinking about what matters in
poetry (and hopefully you're not just canon-building), leave a place for
the sudden, the open, the work seemingly without opening or closure. And
refer to Aristotle all you want, but don't think his standards are absolute
in any way, or perhaps even all that appropriate for a post-nuclear literature.

 This reminds me of the age old joke about the 'kiwi' male (both bird and
 human) who 'eats, roots and leaves'. Probably lost on puzzled Americans who
 think of a kiwi as a small greenish brown fruit - known here as a 'Chinese
 gooseberry' - or 'kiwifruit'.

Timothy, you make a very good point here, but still, if I might -- I am
complaining about different kinds of separatism -- the separatism of
Farrakhan, for instance, and the separatism of someone like Andrea
Dworkin (I'm not sure what Dworkin is -- she has a boyfriend named John
Stoltenberg, who claims he is not a man -- what does that make them??
They are both against sex, and believe that hugging is where it's at.).
So yes, I am with you when you say that there has to be tensions, and
even stiffness, but can the tensions sustain separatism?  In the early
Republic, there is the Bill of Rights that allows the establishment of
different religious faiths, and permits everyone to speak -- and there is
states' rights -- but it doesn't permit secession.  And I see many groups
on the left attempting a sort of secession from the polity, with a
concomittant attempt to silence other groups, or to reduce their
standing, as a kind of reversal of the identity politics practised
against them earlier on.  This kind of thing is what has driven white men
out of the democratic party.  Once they are gone, who's going to be the
next impurity that needs to be driven out?  There is a logic of
scapegoating here (it is also going on in the Tolkien thread, I think)
but it is going on in left culture generally.  It has been going on since
I have been an adult.  I went to Evergreen State College in the 70s and
already there were women-only concerts (although the funding was paid for
by state taxes).  This logic of scapegoating has troubled me for a very
long time.  It is an ad hominem attack -- you cannot speak, or even be
present -- because of your gender.  There were many liberals in South
Africa, and I don't know Tolkien's precise position -- but to push him
out of the possibility of being heard, or to simplify his art, on the
basis of being from South Africa is terrifying to me.  That it can be
done almost without thought at this point is what's scary to me.  Still,
I take your point, but not its application.

You make a very good point, too, about the problems when I discuss Sweden
and Denmark versus Finland.  Sweden has let in as many as 8000 political
dissidents from African countries in a single year.  Finland allows an
annual number of about 35 from around the globe (that was the number when
I was there).  The real problem is that with such a huge influx as in
Sweden there are a tremendous number of knifings.  It's actuarial.  There
are just simply more crimes going in both directions when you have
diffeent groups living together.  In Finland where you have very few
people who are clearly from elsewhere you have nevertheless another kind
of problem.  If you are a foreigner you are very clearly visible, and
tend to take the heat of aggression from an amazing number of people.  I
was clearly not a Finn -- I have somewhat darker skin (I don't know why,
I am Norwegian American -- perhaps some throwback to an ancestor who was
abducted in the 9th century from a peaceful Mediterranean beach or
something by a Viking berserker) and my father has jet black hair.  I was
constantly harassed by nut-cases, and challenged to fights.  99% of Finns
were actually really nice to me and perhaps BECAUSE of my genetic
difference, women were more interested in me there.  But the nut-case men
made it very difficult to go into bars.  Almost every time I went in I
was harassed and challenged to a fight.

My question is can we have a society that is not based on scapegoating,
or calling someone absolutely and perversely evil?  Bataille and the
College of Sociology theorists said, no, we cannot.  I think we have to
find a way to do it -- not through scapegoating, but somehow through
humor, and appreciation, but we also have to realize that everybody in
this process is nervous and paranoid, as the likelihood given human
history is that we are on our way toward endless scapegoating, with one
group after another thrown into the ovens. I am fascinated by the case of
New York City.  Almost all of my students are from there.  There are
Guatemalans, Haitians, Puerto Ricans, and everything else imaginable.  In
talking of this they have said that they have their own neighborhoods,
and they don't mix.  Even inside of Spanish neighborhoods, the
Guatemalans and the Dominicans will have nothing to do with one another.
They just shrug over this.  Maybe I should, too.

Does anybody have time to watch the very good Lincoln documentary on PBS
just now?  It's six hours, and the first 2 were last night.  He was
roused out of his lethargy by the attempt to annex Kansas and Nebraska
into the slave territory.  He had debates with a man who's famous but
whose name I forget, and the man was arguing that each state should
decide for itself, and said in fact that might makes right.  That if you
have the votes for slavery, then the majority should decide.  Lincoln
made a brilliant move, and said, "Right makes might."

This was a brilliant almost martial arts move I felt.  But to make this
move he could count on Christianity as being a uniting force.  He could
count on the idea that everybody felt that there was a universal spirit,
and that each of us were immortal, and not to be treated as a mere means,
but rather as an end in ourselves.

But WHAT COMMON thing do we still have that would allow for this?  In
what way can we assert universal human rights in these times?  I think we
have mostly decided that whatever anybody wants is right in this age of
relativism.  Is it possible to have any kind of a standard?  Some of my
friends now even think it's ok to have sex with children.  I say no way,
and they say, why not?  What standard would say that you can't do that? I
think if we could come up with a universal sense of standards we can live
together.  If we can't even agree that children are sacrosanct, then I
don't know what to do.  I think Lincoln would know how to put all this
into better words.

-- Only so many books can survive.  Those which do have to have a relevance to the
nation, or have to be argued for as such.  Usually they will survive as text
books.  We can't save everything.  We also can't make books if only five people are
interested in them.  To survive, a book has to be of interest to a great number of
people.  Criticism is canonization.

I will keep reading Creeley.  I like Hollo and Codrescu enormously.  I like Creeley
a lot as a person though I've had limited contact, and I have loved two poems and
one essay.

It is just a work that has a very different spirit from my own I think.  So I will
have to work at it, but the amount of love others have had for the work is
encouraging.  I will keep at it, and I guess I will even shut up on the topic until
I read a few hundred pages, and some more criticism.

I hope others will keep talking about him.  I am getting some footholds from the
conversation.

Kirby relax and enjoy him while we can. Creeley will survive whether you, or
I, find him relevant or not :-) I do, and find him to be a wonderful breeze
on a brisk winter day.

Anyone have info on contacting Jim Hartz who
ran the San Francisco State poetry center a long

Please backchannel his email address or phone

If you think real hard you can probably come up with relatively homogenious
countries where there's been a fair amount of slaughter--hey, ever read the
Icelandic Sagas?--and even some modern ones.

Finland's modern history is a bit less rosy than you paint it. Finland's
fascist government lost its war, and 2/5 of its territory, to the Soviet
Union. At the earliest opportunity thereafter it allied itself with
Germany: Finnish troops fought alongside German troops for the next
severalk years. They didn't off their own Jews, but they didn't much care
what their allies did to Russian and Polish Jews.

But Finland's problems have never been ours, since we've never been
particularly homogenious. In 1665, when New Amsterdam became New York, 18
languages were spoken on Manhattan, Delaware spoke Swedish and Pennsylvania
German, and the major conflicts among European settlers were between
Englishmen in Nedw England.

I'd suggest that the exclusivity and violence you ascribe to heterogeneity
has more to do with poverty. Guatemalan and Dominican immigrants who make
it into the middle class get along just fine.

As to the theory of community origins you cite, I'd suggest that familial
or small clan bonds of affection combined with the survival advantage of
cooperation might have been more important than exclusivity.

And by the way, polyglot New York has one of the lowest violent crime rates
in the country.

Threats to the very fabric of the universe, obviously. Nice use of

And the Gubernator of California is in favor of sex and believes that
groping is where it's at. I'd frankly rather be stuck in an elevator with
Dworkin and Stoltenberg.

they utterly terrorize the massage.

Napkins, plates - some figurines

Make some simple, natural sounds -

Museums? - Now they'll see you more -

They'll make small problems; to solve them,
oh, it will take generations to wiggle and move.

Presents just slide the supper to collateral,

Right now I have no details, but sadly, I report the death, two or three
days ago in San Francisco, of the great visionary painter and paste-up
artist Jess, for forty years companion to Robert Duncan. Robin Blaser spoke
of Jess and Duncan, of "their world of IMAGINATION, which had no walls."
Jess's dying ends something, his and Duncan's world so much a part of mine;
that world is now, if not gone, at the very least shifted, but the
potentiality and potence of the actual life, that which I think constiututes
the paradisal, the continuous opening of possibility, is in this instance
and kind gone. We all, of course, have to find our own paradise, and there
are many; Duncan and Jess both and together are guides, for their promise
always stays.

Meredith and I have taken Jess's _Translations_ and the catalogue _Jess: A
Grand Collage_, down from the shelves, that they can the pair of them dwell
with us and grace us this oddly snowy day in Vancouver. And feel blessed.

I was here but I disappear. Anti-colonialist

There are never too many warnings, there are
always too many. I speak from the fragility of
the heart of empire, Kilroy of the future

For one thing it's a process of natural selection - did I already say
that? What produces returns, returns. It's a question of identity, not
equivalence, the same must return to the same, in which case the
mutation is successful. Otherwise the language stretches farther out on a
limb, there's always new testing going on. There you are.

Just sent out a version of this on the lists. There's room here...
placing it online somewhere... ...

I've been taking thyroid pills for the past two days - they seem to work,
and my energy is better than it has been. Meanwhile I've done two images
relating to Kilroy was here - and I'm interested in that phrase, which I
think was common in WWII - related to I was here but I disappear in The
Harder they Come. There's a whole phenomenology of signing and
distribution here - and signing in urban environments connects class with
fuzzy boundaries; styles are picked up and transformed, local content
remains fixed. Years ago I worked on contenting in the form of classical
inscription which the intersection of a set and its negation formed a
null set relativized by the content of the set. A terrific mathesis of the
daily world results from this - a phenomenology (in the scientific sense)
of inscription, maintenance, and so forth. You can look for classical
and/or fuzzy boundaries anywhere, and the anonymous Kilroy was here
spread everywhere carried, I think, by GIs -

And working on some small new images on the Zaurus dealing with the
'leaking' of inscription, a byproduct of the sketch program I'm using.

Between Adaptation and Woody Allen's Anything Else, I locate myself as a
writer. Or between Celan and Jabes. These fields are related.

Still on page two, after the news.

Symbolism is for the symbol-minded. =20

George Carlin said that.

I was born in the United States.  Does that prove I have a racist mind?

I was joking about the Irish interpretation of the Hobbits.  My feet are
of a relatively normal size and are not particularly hairy.  While I am
vertically challenged, I am well above five feet tall.

Come on, Patrick, the very symbolism suggests a certain bad faith about
race.  And the fact that Tolkien was born in South Africa is even more
suggestive.

As far shifting race into "species," this is exactly how one makes the
question unnerveracking.  Race, not being biological, but actually
sociological, is nervous making category because it is by definition
unstable.  To make it the biological category of species then renders it
stable.  To say that Tolkien wasn't messing with these ideas during the
period of the Nazis and eugenics is naive.  He almost couldn't help
himself. The fact that the Hobbits may be irish doesn't exempt Tolkien
either.  The concept of labor aristocrats works for race as well.   And
its rather bigoted to say that because one likes one other, therefore
you like them all ... when the logic actually is in reverse.

Where I get off the bus on this question is the fact that Tolkien works
in racialist imagery doesn't mean he shouldn't be read.  Nor that there
is exactly a clear message about race, nor that it is the most
interesting aspect to the book.  For me, it is the simplicity of the
struggle, it's either/or ness, as well as its implicit resort to
authoritarianism that bother.  Tolkien was not a fascist, but he wasn't
a Taoist either.

I don't have time for the books anymore. Proust, among others, calls.
But the film is a great achievement, which cannot be wished away
regardless of politics and the transgression of translation.

Hey, I know Tolkien as a medievalist--never read the fictions. But "Golem?"
Covetous? Needs to be saved so earth can be redeemed? Are you kidding? Why
didn't he just call the character "kike?"

actually, when i read 2.5 of those weighty tomes in my childhood, the
only character i could relate to was gollum, or whatever his name is.
now i know why.

I'm not saying that I agree with that representation of Gollum or that I =
believe that he needs to be redeemed (I'm with you on this Maria), but =
it's clear enough to me that, irrespective of the profoundly imaginative =
conception of its cosmology or its apparent derivation from Nordic or =
Celtic mythology, Tolkien intended for us to read TLOTRs allegorically, =
as a kind of Christian passion-play. Tolkein himself has written that, =
"the Lord of the Rings is a fundamentally religious and Catholic work," =
and some of the parallels seem pretty evident - the carrying of the ring =
as emblem of sin is an allusion to the carrying of the cross and the =
fact that the climactic attempt to destroy the ring in the fires of Mt. =
Doom happened on "the twenty-fifth of March" is quite deliberate, as =
that is the supposed date in the Anglo-Saxon tradition of both the =
Cruxifixion and the Feast of the Annunciation to celebrate the =
incarnation of god as man. There's no question that all of these choices =
were made consciously by Tolkien, a devout Roman Catholic, and so =
perhaps any discussion of the racism inherent in TLOTR could be shunted =
off for a discussion of the racism inherent in Catholicism. Regardless, =
as regards Gollum, Tolkien has also written "I should say,"that within =
the mode of the story [the final act] exemplifies (an aspect of) the =
familiar words: 'Forgive us our trespasses as we forgive them that =
trespass against us. Lead us not into temptation but deliver us from =
evil.'"  =0D

A Sunday afternoon poetry reading presented by The Gig:


            Karen Mac Cormack and Jesse Huisken

            January 18th, 3 p.m.

            New Works Studio
            319 Spadina Avenue, second floor


In 2003 the first volume of Karen Mac Cormack's _Implexures_ was jointly
published by Chax Press and West House Books--a project that works a
continually unfolding transformation of the shifting materials of
autobiography and family history, of prose and poetry, of letters, diaries
and travel writing, of anecdote and philosophical reflection. This will be
her first extensive public reading from the project in Toronto. She will be
joined by Jesse Huisken, the Toronto writer and artist whose recent
publications include _Increase_ and _The First Confessional Poems of the
Toronto Poetry and Painting Guild_.

I've just published a Bibliography of the Published Work of Douglas Blazek
1961-2001, with Glass Eye Books, Northampton.  It's 200 pages of Blazek's
prolific publishing life -- his own poems in books, magazines, anthologies;
his magazines Ole and Open Skull, the books he edited and published with
Open Skull Press, reviews, etc.

I also did a short bio/introduction.  You can order from me: $15.95 plus

Blazek was a moving force in the Mimeo Revolution, concurrent with the
Beats to some extent, first in Chicago, then San Francisco, then
Sacramento, involving as well D. r. Wagner, d. a. levy, that whole
Cleveland gang, Bukowski for a while: Meat Poets  they sometimes called
themselves. . . .

Poets, scholars, booksellers, libraries . . . useful to all.

symbolism is like politics:  even if you don't care, they'll get you.  cf.
Derrida, il n'y a pas dead metaphors.

i do have hairy feet, am relatively short for my family, and have wavy
hair ... so i always wondered if we were the offspring of hobbits and men.
i also always thought that the hobbits were English villagers, probably
from the north.  question: if the fall of middle earth means no wizards,
no elves, no dwarves, does it also mean no hobbits?

maria,

i too recall reading LOTR as being a chore. i am glad i did it, since it
enabled me to have conversations with my geeky friends (since I didn't
play D&D), but i remember that it took an entire summer and that i would
never do it again.  but i adored "The Hobbit," and Bilbo Baggins:  read
that at least three times, which puts it slightly below PK Dick, Ursual Le
Guin and Marge Piercy in my history of repeated readings of novels.

as an antidote to this LOTR, discussion, consider reading "His Dark
Materials."  it is a fantasy book for children and adults, as well as
being knowing about the religious origins of said genre.  and it has
epigraphs from Ashbery and Milton.

Robert

Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; format=flowed

I am going to play naive young poet for a moment & ask a series of questions
regarding Reich.

1) Would Reich not count as a political prisoner, and thus be of the stature
of people such Emma Goldman, Sacco & Vanzetti, etc.?

2) Has anyone EVER made an attempt to refute the research of Wilhem Reich?
Starting with sex-economy moving into Orgone Biophysics?

3) If Wilhem Reich's research is valid, then why is it generally ignored
that a theory and treatment of cancer, which Reich described as Biopathical,
had been developed as early as the 1930's?

That question was misleading. His research was not ignored, the United
States Government decided that it should be stopped, and that his research
should be burned. I am not going to even bother asking why.

4) Has the government been successfull in eliminating Reich from the general
intellectuall life?

This last question is of particular importance because a relatively ignored
discourse has developed along side Reich, and that is the discourse of what
some call "Democratic Education." For example, I believe the founder of
Summerhill was a friend of Reich's and the founder of the Albany Free
School, Mary Leau, developed Reichian techniques for working with
traumatized children.

Well, generally speaking, civil union is a status that has specified
privileges associated with it, is available only to residents of a given
state, and is enforceable only within that state.  And of course, only
Vermont has civil union at this time.

Marriage per se is a status conferred by the state in which the marriage
takes place but recognized by all US states and by other countries with
whom the US has appropriate treaties.  The entire body of matrimonial
law--for better and worse--applies to married couples.  Civil unions are
not necessarily covered by that extensive body of law.

As I wrote in a recent letter to the New York Times, civil marriage for
same-sex couples is not a moral issue or a religious issue; it is an
issue of equal protection under the Constitution of the United States.
It does not require anyone to believe anything.  It only requires
same-sex couples to be accorded the same rights (and responsibilities)
as other married couples in the United States.

(i've been away with no internet access since my original post)

if i'm wrong, then please educate me, but from what i've read, civil
unions
would
allow the same legal, binding rights to couples as would marriage.

am i wrong about this?  if i am, let me know, i'll then think further on
the
issue.

i understand that plenty of couples (straight) get "married" at city
hall
(for instance)
which of course has nothing to do with BEING in a church.  on the other
hand
it
is clear that "marriage" is very much affirmed by the church body as an
institution
which upholds standards and beliefs put forth by scripture.

this is why i prefer civil unions.  i also hear what kari is saying, and
i
agree with
the framework of the idea that it's good to oppose the Right, especially
when
it's
dealing with very basic human needs like protection, insurance, taxes,
adoption,
i understand all this.  but to me it just leaves a bad taste in my mouth
because
of the fact that the church is very much involved in the idea of what
marriage is.
to me it's like asking a Jew to read Mein Kampf and LIKE IT!

of course i don't know what many other religions have to say about same-
sex unions.  but in America, it's pretty clear that the ruling tongue
speaks
of Christ, the God on our money is NOT meaning Shiva or Shango.

yes, i see the idea of opposition by making them give us marriage
licenses.
but in the end, this form of assimilation is horrific --to me-- because
it
asserts
that their ideas of "abomination" must also be swallowed.  but maybe
it's just me who thinks this.  call me crazy, i'm used to it already.

thanks for sharing your many thoughts (and that RK interview),

I'm reminded by this conversation of what the Marxist critic Leslie Fiedler said in an interview when already quite old (he may have been seventy or even eighty).  In the thirties when he was backing writers like Dos Passos and many others whose names have been lost, he hated Gone with the Wind because of its implicit support for a racist regime.  Some fifty years later, however, he said -- the aesthetic wonders of Gone with the Wind made it such that it continued to haunt him, while he never thought again about Dos Passos or the pc junk that he had so violently supported.

Whatever else you can say about Lord of the Rings it has haunted the imaginations of millions.  And so, on an aesthetic basis, it towers above everybody's work on this entire list.  Compared to it and the immense lifespan it has had and will continue to have, this entire list is just a blip.  What is the source of its powerful appeal?  I read it myself when I was fifteen and don't think I'll ever forget it, though I really don't want to read it again.  I don't think I need to: it's still there.

Aesthetic appeal isn't necessarily a sign of depth, only of popularity.
I also like LOTR, but I like my own aesthetics better, and my own
aesthetics have more relevance today than LOTR.

By 'relevance' I'm referencing engagement with critical issues of
contemporary society, technology, phenomenology, politics.

At the risk of being severely misconstrued, and also at the risk of making an easy
response, I feel it's necessary to ask what the meaning or purpose of a discussion
of the racist implications of Tolkien's book might be. Is the purpose to diminish
the book's sizable reputation among, and value to, "intellectuals" and
"non-intellectuals" alike? Is the purpose to expose Tolkien as himself a racist,
sneaking insidious messages into a story packed with unpronounceable names and
mythological allusions? Suppose that, by exposing what it is about the book that
might, should we place the racism-exposure transparency over these volumes and turn
on the overhead projector of High Culture, match the accepted guidelines for racism
in literary works, we do make a proof of some sort that is essentially irrefutable.
What then? There's a line in Mamet that goes something like: There are some numbers
so huge, so inconceivably huge, that division by two makes absolutely no difference.
I'm probably omitting an expletive there, but you get the idea.

On Jan 5, the New York Times reported on the approval of a new
constitution for Afghanistan, saying that the chairman of the grand
council, Sebaghatullah Mojadeddi, recited a poem that included the line,
"There is rain coming and flowers are growing from my body."



It's great that there are national leaders in the world who recite
poetry at important occasions of state.  I wish the Times had indicated
the poet and poem from which the line is quoted.



Does anybody know?

This is becoming severely tedious (leave aside the times when some of the
participants to this thread don't seem to be able to distinguish between
LOTR The Book and LOTR The Film).

Whatever racism (or not) exists in Tolkien, it's a ghost -- it's difficult
to imagine JRRT as a *conscious* racist.  It wasn't, for better or worse, in
his orbit as an Oxbridge academic at the time.  He simply didn't *encounter*
Others.

{Might have been better if it +were+ a factor.}

Certainly, admittedly (and leaving aside the utter red herring of the South
African Connection) Tolkien was presumably as much or as little racist as
anyone of his class and background in England at the time.

What (as David Bircumshaw has pointed out) LOTR {the book} (allegorically)
deals with is a stunning set of *class* cliches.

(I'm not sure if dave would use the term "class cliche", but I would.)

And <sigh> as Mark Weiss will no doubt be happy to explain, Tolkien managed
to get whipsawed not just over the academic/fiction divide (the story of
sketching the beginnings of The Hobbit on the borders of a student's exam
paper) but the fact that as a medievalist, he was marginal, and managed to
gain the equivalent of pop-academic status boxing outside his weight with
"Beowulf: The Monster and the Critics".  (A brilliant article, way before
its time, but Tolkien wasn't centrally an Anglo-Saxon scholar.)

Nobody (not even Mark) has yet mentioned that he *translated*
(brilliantly -- or is it that there simply isn't much competition?) GGK, as
well as writing the glosses to the (Tolkien and) Gordon edition (his sole
published claim-to-fame as a medievalist).

... and howabout how no one yet has mentioned Tolkien's link to The
Inklings? -- C.S.Lewis, Charles Williams, who the hell was the fourth?

This is beyond angels weep territory with (from my perspective) nobody other
than Mark (on Tolkien's medieval background) or David (on the Birmingham
connection) contributing anything other than hot air and blah.

And no, this *isn't* simply a digression from the "central" topic of <Racism
in the Lord of the Rings>, it matters.

JRRT was a complex figure in all kinds of ways, and to snip-out and judge
him on the DVD of The Two Towers is simply ... peurile.

Dear Michael Broder,
thanks for your post responding to my questions.
i've focused on comparing rights without looking at the
wider implications of the civil union outside Vermont
and how much it doesn't mean outside Vermont.

it's funny how, of all the conversations i've had about
this subject (including conversations with a lesbian
lawyer i met at a party) that it has never been explained
the way you put it.

thanks again.  i'm going to read further into it,

before Christmas i ran into an old boyfriend who is a Tolkien
fanatic, and i told him about this conversation.  he says that
the same conversation has been going on in the SciFi community
ever since the first of the three films came out.

anyway, he claims --as do his nerdy friends-- that Tolkien
based much of his understanding of ceremonial magic, etc.,
on Druidic culture and magic.  and if that's the case, the
questions should stick with the films and not the books,
as others have already said in this thread.  the Druids are
not likely to have encountered people of color from the
southern hemispheres.

but furthermore, if this is the case, that we're talking about
Druidic culture and belief, then sexism is what we could be
focusing on.  sexism has always tended to back a back seat.
but in the case of the Druids, it was their priests who removed
women from their seats of power as spiritual leaders and healers
in the Celtic regions (especially England) long before any
Christian stepped foot in the territory to begin their own form
of sexism.  of course the Christians became murderers of women
of power, while the Druids were more interested in removal of
women and of reconsecrating wells, etc.  the Romans also did
this, for instance taking the wells of Brid (or Brigid), and
renaming them for Diana.

the Green Man myths were originally destroyed by the Druids,
and if it's true that Tolkien was focused on the Druids, then
it's sexism, not racism to focus on.  but i don't know for sure
what his focus was.  i admit i haven't read the books.  and it's
fiction anyway, not myth or any kind of oral history, so even
if he did use Druidic tools, maybe it's irrelevant.

just wanted to add that i disagree with those who have said
that this thread is tedious, or becoming so.  it's important
to discuss these things.

I hate to say this, it being ever so long since I was really deep in the
Ghetto, but anyone who uses the term SciFi ain't one of them fen.

I remember when Leslie Fiedler gave a lecture at San Francisco State in
1964. Both the campus and the City were shaking from demonstrations -
primarily led by CORE - against the Hotels, Supermarkets and Car Dealerships
that refused to hire African-Americans. Campus Demonstrations were
frequently in support of SNCC & CORE actions in Georgia, Alabama and
Mississippi.

It was also the time of the emergence of the Black Student Union, the
intellectual leadership of which was not persuaded by the instant "Black &
White Together" impetus of Dr. Martin Luther King & Core & James Baldwin
(particularly represented in the great essay, The Fire Next Time)  but there
was a turning inward to define and declare was unique, worthy and powerful
about being Black (aesthetically, spiritually, politically, etc.)
It was the seeds of what would be eventually emulated by inward looking
feminists, gay, Latino, and Asian groups.

In any case, into this mix steps Leslie Fiedler with his noontime lecture on
what he saw as the homoerotic character of the relationship between Huck and
N Jim. It was very well received by black students, a number of whom took up
speaking with Fiedler when the lecture broke up. The gist of the interest
was trying to interpret - and perhaps fend off - the involvement of many
white men in what was perceived as a Black struggle for not only Civil
Rights, but a post Ghetto or post-Colonial cultural and political identity.
Fiedler's lecture, if I am interpreting my memory correctly, enabled a view
of white men, many young, as having a commitment to the struggle of Black
liberation to be seen as interfused with homoerotic desires for black men.
In fact, homoerotic or not, relations with black men as friends was the
"safer" relationship for white men; dating Black women, at that time, was,
with few exceptions, still very much  perceived as a dangerous, more risk
filled public act - from both sides of racial coin - no matter the
compatibility of individual partners.

So there Fiedler was, throwing a very hot potato in the air, enabling, as it
were, a literary device, built - it now seems - on homophobia that could
further enable Black Power advocates to separate from white, perhaps
compromising entanglements - at least ones that made it hard to further
explore and create a powerful and new identity.

Without knowing anything of Fiedler's personal history, who knows, he might
have been dealing with his own, let alone collective, 'white' attraction to
and phobia for black men, and thereby enabling a way of distancing himself
from what SNCC and CORE initially definitely saw as a collaborative project.

Indeed there may be or were two Leslie Fiedlers.

Stephen Vincent

I'm reminded by this conversation of what the Marxist
critic Leslie
Fiedler said in an interview when already quite old
(he may have been
seventy or even eighty).  In the thirties when he was
backing writers like
Dos Passos and many others whose names have been lost,
he hated Gone
with the Wind because of its implicit support for a
racist regime.  Some
fifty years later, however, he said -- the aesthetic
wonders of Gone
with the Wind made it such that it continued to haunt
him, while he never
thought again about Dos Passos or the pc junk that he
had so violently
supported.

Whatever else you can say about Lord of the Rings it
has haunted the
imaginations of millions.  And so, on an aesthetic
basis, it towers above
everybody's work on this entire list.  Compared to it
and the immense
lifespan it has had and will continue to have, this
entire list is just
a blip.  What is the source of its powerful appeal?  I
read it myself
when I was fifteen and don't think I'll ever forget
it, though I really
don't want to read it again.  I don't think I need to:
it's still
there.

Yeah, sure, Kirby, but what about the mechanism by
which this appeal has happened?


pop culture's great, and i'm not so high-brow as to
not grant it its due, but would LOTR have survived had
it NOT been written in the style of a linear
nineteenth century novel?

what is the source of its appeal--?--read joe
campbell---same thing that makes harry potter so
appealing---they're not horribly complex works (LOTR,
by the way, has less of the Middle Earth cosmology
than, say, The Silmarillion----has anyone in this
exhaustive discussion even brought up that book?), and
in their simplicity they leave lots and lots of ideas
unexamined---

ye olde hero mythe: little fellow saves the
world....you're bound to win if you start with someone
who seems small and soft and make he or she your
hero/ine...because in the end we all feel weak and
soft and small...it's universal___as someone once said
of smashing pumpkins (a band i happen to like,
actually): yeah, selling songs about depression to
teen-agers...like shooting fish in a barrell____


(and this leaves untouched the "mechanism" of
canonization, which any good marxist would bring into
question_____why do high school kids have to read
robert frost as opposed to stein?

<?php

and this is coming from someone who read the trilogy
(and the silmarillion) at least ten times as a kid...

the issue isn't whether or not JRRT is a "conscious racist" or not.
This is the author fallacy rearing its defensive head. People react
to the word "racist" as if it's this exotic, unspeakable evil, not to
be brought up in polite society, and certainly not something complex,
multiform and mutable. But it is.  It's a systemic, ubiquitous
condition of society that changes all the time. It would be hard
*not* to be racist if one is a member of a racist society. i think
the issue is that both book(s) and film appear to underwrite the
great myths of western, and particularly northern/european,
civilization, especially the myth of white supremacy.  But "racism"
doesn't just mean "anti-people of color" --it can also mean
anti-Semitism, Orientalism, xenophobia tout court.  This should not
be surprising, and it certainly shouldn't make folks so defensive as
to forestall critical discussion of the cultural artifacts.  as for
the question of why we like to discuss such things, or what value the
discussion has, it's an intellectual pleasure and an ethical
imperative to analyze cultural artifacts according to these analytic
paradigms. like, why discuss anything? cuz we feel like it.

I would second all that Maria has to say below, with one reservation.   I don't
think it's hard "not to be a racist if one is a member of a racist society,"
though it certainly is a struggle once you begin to act upon your anti-racism
-- I've always been a bit suspicious of the argument (and I hasten to add that
Maria is not making this argument) that everybody is racist, as it sucks the
specificity and gravity right out of discussions of what remains America's
central problem --

I don't know enough about Tolkien or the movie to pronounce -- but I do know
that the Bush family has a long history of opposing any and all civil rights
legislation --

CALL FOR PAPERS


Conference: AFRO-GEEKS: FROM TECHPHOBIA TO TECHNOPHILIA


MAY 7-8, 2004 â€¢ UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SANTA BARBARA


Proposal DEADLINE:  MARCH 1, 2004


The Center for Black Studies at the University of California, Santa

Barbara, invites submissions of papers for an upcoming conference,

AfroGEEKS, that examines the rapidly-shifting relationship between

issues of Blackness and technology. In recent years, African

Americans, especially, have been portrayed as poster children for

the digital divide discourse. Though rarely represented as full

participants in the information technology revolution, Black people

are among the earliest adopters and comprise some of the most ardent

and innovative users of IT (information technology). African

diasporic people's many successes within new media and information

technologies are too often overshadowed by the significant

inequalities in technology access, which ultimately

produces the racial digital divide.


But there is more to this important and timely topic. We are

interested in proposals that consider the following topics:


Â· Structural barriers to IT access that specifically impact Black

communities

Â· Effective models of innovative IT use and adoption in Black

communities

Â· The influence of traditional science education on Black youths

Â· Technophobes and Luddites in the Black community

Â· Computer gaming in the Black community

Â· Black popular music culture, such as sampling and turntablism,

within the IT economy

Â· The place of Blacks in the IT industry

Â· How categories of hi-tech and low-tech mastery get determined and

circulated

Â· Black IT leaders

Â· Recent legislation regarding the telecommunications industry and

universal access to IT

Â· The responsibility of the government and IT businesses to minority

communities

Â· IT issues on the African continent and for African diasporas

outside of the U.S.

Â· Events of September 11 relative to Blacks' position in the IT

economy

Â· The Geek identity problematic

Â· From IT Consumers to IT Producers

Â· Black virtual communities

Â· Black blogs

Â· Blacks and military-based IT training

Â· Becoming AfroGeeks

Â· Proposals addressing related topics welcome


The conference will be held May 7-8, 2004, at the University of

California, Santa Barbara.


Proposals should be limited to two pages and should include an

abstract of not more than 350 words, and audio/visual needs

specified. Proposals should be submitted to:


Dr. Anna Everett

Oh, I don't know about the term "ethical imperative." I'm not even sure you could
say it was an intellectual imperative. (We're talking about elves, dwarves, and
hobbits, here.) But the discussion as constructed seems too narrow. Why not think of
the book in terms of historical positioning? with respect to changes taking place in
poetry around that time, give or take a few years? in film? even in popular music?
in visual art? Even as T. published a book that encapsulated so many "paradigms" of
legend/myth/folklore, a work almost designed to spawn imitators by virtue of the
fact that comparison would be so difficult for its successors to avoid, artists in
virtually every other medium were beginning to reject everything that had come
before, or at least to use those elements towards (at that time) exhilarating, new,
ends. Yes, racism is complex, but it's simple when considered in relation to this
book, or to its implications.

Moonbeam Mistaken for News

"I have nothing to say," Sara says, in a broadly
contextual and admirably objective manner.
In her spare time, Sara is also busy fleecing
magazines and newspapers and volunteering

as a Big Sister to visiting headhunters. "Head-
hunting is terrible, but so," she devoutly believes,
"is the disappearance of headhunting arts." Sara
deplores the parochial treatment of the arts.

Increasingly radical, Sara bridges conceptual gulfs
in order to point out and share the experience
of others. "Paradox," she says, "has been a friend
and teacher on my journey over the last years."

Sara's at home (or appears to be) on several
continents, both major and minor. Steering
clear of conceptual potholes, she puts her trust
in shunyata and prajna--in openness and

brilliance. Part of her impact is that of a good
example, one we all hold dear to us. She, in that
Mexican village where she's been having her
dark night of the soul for nine years now,

reminds us (with Avicenna) that (despite the pre-
conditions of the heart) the healing power of prayer,
presence, ritual, and passionate love
"penetrates all existence."

Dear Robin Hamilton,
but since i was the one who used "SciFi" it's okay?
since i'm not part of the SciFi (excuse me, the
SF--whatever) community?

i don't like SF (well, i don't DISlike it, i'm just not
interested in it), i just like guys who like SF.
guess i have a real sweet-tooth for them, so
of course i find myself spinning my web at
their gatherings, where all their talk of
comparing/contrasting which books are
"Hard SF" and "Soft SF" goes in one
ear and out the other.

but i did want to clarify that Nate,
my ex, is a bonafide SF fanatic.
it's me who says "SciFi."

in my studies of SF nerd men --at least
the queer ones-- i've come to the conclusion
that they're the same, all over the world.
their pace, their glasses...  especially when
i attended the World SF convention in
Philadelphia, it was amazing to see how
the nerds from Japan and France had the
same intense pace, in particular it's the pace
i find interesting.  sometimes i think that
it's their chronic computer use, like they
are matching the computer's pace.  but
maybe i need to conduct a few more
studies, just to be certain.  it may take
the rest of my life, but it's an important
study for future generations.

CAConrad
p.s. my favorite time at the World con (after
the Gaylaxian beer drinking contest with the
dykes from Amsterdam and London) was
the Weird Al Yinkovich (spelling?) sing-a-long.
they were singing with the videos on a huge
tv screen, there were no subtitles, and i was
the only one in the room of about 70 who
didn't know the words.

MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii; format=flowed

Announcing the latest volume in the series Modern and Contemporary
Poetics, edited by Charles Bernstein and Hank Lazer


The Obligation toward the Difficult Whole

Postmodernist Long Poems

Brian McHale


This book is a smart, eclectic analysis of nine long poems written by
postmodernist poets who are at once familiar and unfamiliar, canonical
and marginalized. Addressing subjects as wide-ranging as angelology, the
court masque, pop art, caricature, the cult of the ruin, hip-hop,
Spenser's Irish policy, and the aesthetics of silence, Brian McHale
pulls varied threads together to identify a repertoire of postmodernist
elements characteristic of the long poems he examines.

McHale shows how elements from these long poems overlap, interfere, pull
in different directions, jar against, and even contradict each other;
and he demonstrates how they also echo, amplify, and reinforce each
other. They do not slot smoothly together like pieces in a jigsaw
puzzle, but they do form (what else?) a difficult whole.


"McHale is wonderfully resourceful in changing the subject from chapter
to chapter to fit the poems discussed, and while his approach adheres to
the conventions of textual exegesis, the chapters really shine as
orchestrations of issues. For instance, James Merrill's The Changing
Light at Sandover works unexpectedly well in raising the subject of
found poetry and procedural composition; Melvin Tolson's Harlem Gallery
and Edward Dorn's Gunslinger are effectively paired to demonstrate the
period flavor of pastiche; Geoffrey Hill's Mercian Hymns and Armand
Schwerner's The Tablets explode the modernist fixation with depth; John
Ashbery's work is given a nuanced reading as proto-theory; Letter to an
Imaginary Friend by Thomas McGrath provides a lucid backdrop to raise
the question of political efficacy in approaching language poet Bruce
Andrews; and Susan Howe's The Europe of Trusts is explored for its
intertextual tapestry."

We also use "shoots" as a euphemism for "shits," and the latter
lends itself to a bit of interesting wordplay also.

It's certainly virtuous to discuss racism.  But the funny thing about
virtue is that it always hides vice.  So when people try to use the cover
story of virtuousness when discussing racism, it covers the fact that
what they really want to be is vicious.  As vicious as possible.  That's
what we really like about this discussion: it offers so many
possibilities to be vicious while seeming virtuous.  We can become
downright murderous, and call it a good cause.

I'd agree -- and I wouldn't want to discount either unconscious or
instititional racism in the books, let alone the film(s) -- but the *really*
uncomfortable edge here around LOTR (The Book) isn't race but class -- race
may be in the background, but class is *well* to the foreground.

Not that this makes the book any the less powerful.

I simply think JRRT is more complex as a writer than much of this discussion
makes him out to be.

{And yes, there are stunning problems about his clunky boilerplate prose
style.}

I mean, even before we get to the point of linking Tolkien-the-fabulist with
Tolkien-the-academic, anyone other than me mentioned The Hobbit?

Bloody hell, he *did* write that before he wrote LOTR.

Poetology.com LLC is an organization dedicated to the practice and
appreciation of the spoken word. The organization was founded by Atif
Saleem and fellow
Penn State alumni Alansan Sesay who realized there is a growing cultural
movement in our country surrounding the art of spoken word expression
and for this
movement to survive it must be well supported and spread to the masses.
Poetic
spoken expression is an art form practiced and appreciated by all, which
transcends racial and stratifying boundaries. Poetology is an
organization
composed of men and women from various backgrounds that practice and/or
appreciate
and support this growing art form. The mission of Poetology is to create
a
greater community consisting of communities that currently exist, by
pooling talent
and support to share thoughts, feelings, ideas and opinions through the
spoken word. Our current initiative is to create a base of support in
the
Baltimore/Washington Metropolitan area from which we can constantly
share and grow. We
are currently hosting poetry venues in downtown Baltimore and College
Park,
MD. Since its inaguration Poetology has hosted many of the "who's who"
in spoken
word including International and National Slam Champion Gayle Danley,
International Slam Champion Taalam Acey, Philly Def Jam Champion Lamar
Hill, Reggie
Gibson, inspiration and writer of the poetry for the movie Love Jones,
Saul
Williams of slam and movie fame and many, many, many more talented
individuals.
More importantly, we have the support of many local and first time poets
who
just come to the mic and share and that's what this movement is all
about.

The members of Poetology enjoy bringing poetic expression to the public,
as
well as supporting other local venues, but this does not however
encompass our
overall aim. Short term goals entail bringing together local venues to
insure
that time and opportunity for expression are shared and distributed
logistically whenever possible, giving all venues the chance to succeed
with out
opposition. Since poetology can be practiced and enjoyed by all from the
cradle to
the grave, we want to be able to provide avenues whereas all can
indulge. Long
term, we have plans to initiate an after school program in Baltimore
that will
examine poetic expression, from haiku's to Hip-Hop. We intend to work
with
today's youth to put their thoughts, concerns, and feelings in artistic
form for
public consumption. On the collegiate level we intend to provide
showcases of
talent from the area's perspective colleges alongside "seasoned" spoken
word
artist and to also bring together talent from a variety of area schools
for
friendly competition and appreciation. Poetology is also dedicated to
the
continued support of all local venues. We have a calendar on our web
site
(http://www.poetology.com ) which is constantly updated to reflect a
gamut of poetologic
events in the area. Poetology believes in the necessity of local venues,
each
has it's own flavor and culture that appeals to its own particular
patrons. In
short, Poetology aims to be the vehicle to bring this greater community
together, through all artistic and intellectual exchange of thoughts and
ideas
affiliated with the art of poetry and the spoken word.

POG and CHAX PRESS present:
a poetry reading and book launch

Elizabeth Treadwell

Tuesday January 13 2004
7pm at Biblio bookstore
222 E. Congress Street Tucson, Arizona
Admission: $5/$3 students
for information call Chax Press at 620-1626

Elizabeth Treadwell lives with her family in Oakland, California. Her other
books include Populace (Avec, 1999) and LILYFOIL + 3 (O Books, 2004). She
directs Small Press Traffic in San
Francisco.

Chax Press announces a new book:
CHANTRY, by Elizabeth Treadwell
published in 2004, and available for the first time at this event.

Chantry is song. Chantry is song that exceeds song structure in all
dimensions to become invocation and enchantment. From “the vessel without a
cover” to “late silhouette in / blue” it refuses to be contained, as a book
wants to live outside its covers.

TO POETRY: A DEDICATION WORKSHOP =AD BRENDAN LORBER
FRIDAYS AT 7 PM: 10 SESSIONS BEGIN FEBRUARY 20TH
Lorber writes, =B3When you dedicate a poem you convert it to a gift, conscrip=

the poem into the service of something beyond yourself. This workshop will
explore techniques and implications of writing for, to, about, after, with,
even as other people; examine and experiment with such connective forms as
the ode, love poem, eulogy, elegy, epithalamion, encomium, canso, the
dozens, poetry portrait, collaboration and non-poetry forms such as
advertising, threatening letters, fan mail, and subpoenas. This is NOT a
workshop in the poetry of sentimentality. To shove us in more interesting
directions, we=B9ll draw from traditions including 7th century Arab and
Persian poetics, European courtly love, Beat, NY School, Language and some
contemporary poets you might run into on the subway.=B2 Brendan Lorber is the

He was, once, one afternoon, at Iowa, the International Writing
Program--fall, it would have to have been, 1981. He was, there was a
panel, Paul Engle, Donald Justice, Larry Levis and Corman, he was at
the far end on the one end of the panel with a stack of books (nobody
else had any books except their own) and Engle getting the panel
started said to him, "Are you going to read _all_ those books Cid?"

He read from one of them, Olson's, like they mattered, the language
the books were written in, and he used his breath a lot - sharp,
sudden stops - breathing in - bringing the air in his chest down on a
word or - what was it? - there's no visualization, now, or then, there
couldn't have been, except maybe he was using one hand to mark the
timing, it's too long ago, maybe they got it on tape, 1982, he was
just reading, voicing, the words in the air - breathed -

-I think here is the issue; Catholic intellectuals-- JRR Tolkien, Hillare
Belloc, Jacques Maritian, GK Chesterton and even Americans like Thomas
Merton and Dorothy Day have a nostalgia for the middle ages. -- and part of
the creation of European Christian identity is based in being against the
other and this arose in the Middle Ages because of the trauma of the
Barbarian invasions.

The crusades for example is the best manifestation of this but the
Reconquista in Spain, Conquest of the Americas, Colonialism and many more
movememnts. The fact is that this is the way that the Christian world came
out of the dark ages, by thinking of themselves as 'chosen'.  This mentality
comes partly from Judaism but also from the unique christian idea of the
incarnation.

This kind of thinking sits right below the surface of Tolkien's work. IT
does not make it less well written et cetera but the fact is that the entire
history of the west is based on this and Tolkien's work is filled with this
kind of reasoning. Having said this other cultures also possess this sense
of being chosen. Islam for example conquered huge areas because they were
filled with a sense of "mission" remember Turkey, Egypt, Syria and Palestine
were Christian once, Iran was Zoroastrian and Pakistan was Hindu/Buddhist.
The problem is that the West is still in control and Islam is not.

I have never been one for Political Correctness, but the fact is that
Tolkien's work, and other western fantasy work is based in teh concept of
there being 'others' less 'chosen'.

I do have to take Kirby Olson to task for claiming that "the Finns appear to
have come from a Mongoloid race in Siberia."  This is a racist statement based
on Germano-Russian pseudoscience of the late nineteenth century.  Recent
genetic studies show that 90 per cent of the Finnish genome is Germanic: this
seems to indicate a very gradual migration, in prehistoric times, of tribes from
the south and east (present-day Central Europe and Sweden) whose members
adopted the language of the "Finn" residents who may have arrived not from Siberia,
but regions around the Ural mountains.  As Kirby notes, linguistic tracings
don't determine "anything much about immigration patterns."  But then he follows
this up with "The only language that is much like theirs are tiny Siberian
tribes, and Hungarian" -- oops again: Estonian, spoken just across the Gulf of
Finland, and Karelian, spoken in the western parts of Russia, are closely
related.  The literatures of Estonia, Finland, and Hungary are voluminous and
fascinating, and held in high regard in Europe (where people learn many languages,
and like to read literature in translation).  As for Kirby's bad experiences
in Finnish drinking establishments, they sound to me as apocryphal as his
knowledge of Finland's linguistic and historical heritage -- or if not apocryphal,
self-provoked by being in the wrong place at the wrong time more than once !

second

at the Metropolitan today, looking at Oribe and Mino ware. Momoyama
period. then rereading my Antarctic writings from Hobart (Tasmania), 1982.
'Who controls discourse controls the law.' listen: 'the body an inductive
body, the play of logics extending everywhere, collapse and extensions of
spectrums, running-on, probabilistic wave-function, union extends and
intersection blurs, the former altering distributivity. the editorializing
body operating within a limited bandwidth, a situation of sampling through
the elocution of the gesture, the sway, field phenomena melding, crossing
the skin, adjacent holes.' doesn't this - two + decades later - become the
network society - as if it never existed in the first place, a priori?
something I was aware of back in 71, with my analysis of the tangled
holarchies of immersive and definable structures - how one looks at things
through time, how things may remain outside of time, outside of
temporality, how humans bring time to things. and here from 82 is the net:
'body-centered, it is the body which extends, consciousness as a wake
following, recuperating the extensions through language. images play
across the surface; these are ingested, failing distributivity. the images
as phenomenological appetition, a process of accretion.' 'the body of
thought as in a body of water.' look for the packet-sniffers, on an
average day I receive 500 emails, of which only perhaps 360 are spam. how
can one remember the distinctions among Oribe and Mino, the Chinese 17th-
century Nanking painters, the enormous collection of Japanese work in the
Bridge of Dreams show we saw years ago? images pour through the world,
falling into adjacencies. I can't keep distinctions, separations; my work
is cultural flux, not the exigencies of boundary-formations, not even the
margins - the world folds in on itself. and reading in this regard
Shaviro, who I think gets networks 'wrong' - begin with the thing and the
arrow, the protocol and the carrying-capacity; extend through looping and
filtration - one might find networks are precisely dead, hillside skeins,
whose content is otherwise-driven, and never to encounter itself - no more
than one phonecall can understand another. enough notes, and I wish I
could sign this Jennifer. [third]

Silence licks a metonymy, without those localizing
articles you saw and ordered from Ghaza. Rhododendrons
unruffle among shifts of iceberg pause, almost
lactating with barbs. I listed each in its own table,
and then queried what was softer than I. The bytecode
docking in premature thickness. The awkward hallow of
introspection. Insecticide tickling over my fingers
like a bald spray of lisping baby's breath, this
thread that splits ends nowhere near where you snore,
or else I would come to get you. To kiss you. Seems
almost lucid when the pendulous daylights slip across
me.

A coal morning of slow participles needs cigarette
food in silence unlocking unquiet cat's feet upon my
bloodied boots. Today I'm covered by the film of loss,
flickering gauze just fit to my skin, won't wash off.
You kissed my dreams raw until they stung and I got
up, robot water and coffee flung agravated from my
eyes. I keep asking you if it's true there are things
softer than myself. "This room is the exact same color
as old wine." You failed to mention my confidence,
which omits any and all such cacophony of intimacies.
I pry daisies from your shadow, worn like a tan into
my complexion.

This skin (which is mine, nourished in your heart)
kills everything wintered by a long frantic walk.

The adjectives cluster. A novel evolves at the mention
of igniting spider tines. "Stuck. You don't want to
pin me to living with you like a fucked-up child.
Sucking another raw sunrise, you see the difference."
I must have left the equations in my other coat.
Aspiring to a matte finish, Christine who loves the
cocaine loves an afternoon's obelisk, even when my
head's erad by silicon. "Who wouldn't find that
bleeding edge erotic?" Christine's ended, too,
buttocks spread like a Cobra's hood. Brad reached
into, pulling toward him the tray shivered with these
vvials of serum. "Fuck me harder. Fuck me like you
fuck your dad*" It's quiet now. The word for the day
is autodidact. Ducts ramble in a quagmire as acid; as
acid is access to voluptuousness uprooted or re-routed
somewhat; at access is issue, of consequence, hereto.
I lay my hand to Brad. Last night a cop on my block
tried to get off. Christine tells us: cells,
lepidoptics, staining glass until it trembles with
your veins. At least you end your login session with a
kiss. I'm stuck here with Brad, an absolute other;
he's autistic, a system pistil of amorous withdrawal,
but then Christine's insides are a butter of silk.

"Would you like to see my collection? Everyone who has
ever loved me has given me a lousy t-shirt. On days
like this, when the gravity's so low we can't seem to
stay together, I take my bowl of grapenuts out onto
the back deck to watch the sun rise. " Snow moans, so
chilling they swaddle my throat mid-gulp. Brad notes
that Christine mentioned once that I claim to be
responsive with a cube of ice, stroking it as if
drawing the moisture across your chapped labia. In the
dessert, sand is whipped to the consistency of topaz;
articles seperate luxuriously from their objects,
leaving me strung out behind the dunes and not sure
and not if I'm single or plural, reciprocity of the
feminine or heart-gnawed recitation of the shelves of
a knifed sky expiring. "Yeah, she's like that
sometimes* "

I know you are, but what am I?

Brad, where did the outside go? "Straining light to
separate articles from their objects, there is no
designation giddy with ideals. The pure form of you is
a myth I bite with grappling eyes." The Upanishads
mention a delicate androgyny of hydrogen as this
mother, as this father: behind my cock, waves that
solve, threading in a pant of mouths. Cover yourself
for God's sake Christine! "Hydrageas subtly echo
across your chest. "

Not that you are unengaged. No money no hope. Not. I
have boundless enthusiasm for every undertaking I
took.

ANTHANY DAWSON FACT SHEET - Rose Henry August 2002


It was at this point that several witnesses report seeing what appeared
to be excessive physical violence done to Anthany by police officer(s):
“When I saw him being punched it made me feel sick.” It is alleged an
officer said, “When I tell you to roll over, you fuckin roll over.”
Witnesses also say police appeared to be joking and laughing as they
stood behind the ambulance once Anthany had been put inside.

ANTHANY DAWSON FACT SHEET -
by
Rose Henry

August 2002

August 7, 1999
      Ceremony at Police Station with Totem pole raising to enhance and
reinforce a better working relationship between Aboriginal people and
law enforcement personnel.

August 11, 1999
      Mid afternoon: Anthany got into his car and headed for home to
meet his mother. He was fit, in good health and with no injuries to his
body. Near Victoria High School Anthany seems to have pulled his car
over and at approximately 4:30 phoned and left a message for his mom
saying he was on his way.
     We do not know what happened from the time he called his mother
until the time the first 911 call was placed.
     At Stadacona Park Anthany was seen   clutching his head as he
walked. He was moaning and groaning and seemed to be in great pain. He
appeared to be extremely hot and started to remove his clothing and run
in and out of rush hour traffic. He fell to his knees and toppled over
several times finally collapsing at Davie Street and Oak Bay Avenue in
front of a number of businesses.

      It was at this point that several witnesses report seeing what
appeared to be excessive physical violence done to Anthany by police
officer(s):  “When I saw him being punched it made me feel sick.” It is
alleged an officer said, “When I tell you to roll over, you fuckin roll
over.” Witnesses also say police appeared to be joking and laughing as
they stood behind the ambulance once Anthany had been put inside.


      It is at this point where Anthany’s medical distress became
secondary to the possible view it was just another drunken Indian being
beaten up by police.


      It is at this point we have to ask ourselves whether the actions
taken by the professional medical and law enforcement officials were at
their best?


      We need to question whether Anthany received adequate medical
attention. Did his ‘racial’ identity and gender play a part in decision
making? Would it have been different if this had been a white middle
class woman?  These are the types of questions that have arisen through
the persistence of Anthany’s family to find out the reasons why Anthany
had to endure this brutal death.


      He remained in a coma after being placed on life support August
11th.  Forty-eight hours after his first interactions with the medical
team and police, Anthany James Dawson’s life support was turned off at
4:21pm, August 13th, 1999.


      This should never have happened to him, it should never happen to
any family. The coroner’s jury found that he died of anoxic
encephalopathy with tonsillar herniation due to restraint-associated
cardiac arrest, agitated delirium and hyperthermia die to episodic
metabolic crisis and positional asphyxia. In English, he was choked to
death during a seizure. Contrary to media reports, Anthany was not drunk
or stoned. He did not die of an overdose or a simple heart attack. A
toxicology report found very minute amounts of marijuana in his system
that was five days old.


      Nancy Dawson has continued to push for justice for everyone
experiencing discrimination of all kinds. She is seeking a public
inquest into Anthany’s death. Her family is still in need of support to
find out what happened so they can begin their healing journey and
eventually to have closure. Would we as parents have done anything
different if this had happened to our child?


      If you have experienced any kind of discrimination don’t be afraid
to exercise your human rights and seek help from your local MLA,
anti-racism centre, the human rights coalition or your family church.

Juncture: 25 Very Good Stories and 12 Excellent Drawings is an anthology of
writers who have skipped a generation and embraced literary experimentation=
:
absurdism, stream-of-consciousness, science fiction, prose based in rhythm
with the influence of poetry. This collection reflects not only the jagged
beats of contemporary American writing but also of American life itself,
with all its hyphenations, its immigrants, and its migrants.

The inclusion of original art and drawings inspired by the stories reflects
the kinds of cultural hybridization that has driven many of these artists i=
n
the first place. More ironic, more rebellious, and much sexier than the
quiet epiphanies we=B9ve come to expect, the stories in Juncture are by the
Barthelmes, Pynchons, Ellisons, Coovers, Gaddises, and Ackers of today.

This truly boggles the mind -- I suppose there's an elastic clause in the
supposition that someone who tries to discuss racism without the cover story of
virtuousness might get off the hook --

BUT -- this seems a peculiarly illogical charge by which to stop all discussion
cold and, presumably, leave the field to those who don't care much about virtue
-- surely we can discuss what most historians would argue is a central problem
in American history and culture without exposing ourselves to charges that we
are the ones being vicious -- I'll side with all those "vicious"antiracists,
thankyou --

I just wanted to add that in the Russian federation there are several
regions, called 'autonomous republics', lying west of the Urals and
stretching like a chain from the Far North to southern parts of Russia, with
hundreds of thousands of people speaking Finno-Ugric languages, such as
Komi, Mordva and Mari, to say nothing of numerous smaller groups scattered
over the European part of Russia, like Veps, Ingermanlandian Finns, Izhora,
all speaking languages related to  Finnish.



< "The only language that is much like theirs are tiny Siberian
tribes, and Hungarian" -- oops again: Estonian, spoken just across the Gulf
of
Finland, and Karelian, spoken in the western parts of Russia, are closely
related.

Depending on the time in history, different groups have been the subject of
viciousness; sometimes warranted and sometimes not.

Christianity was seen as a Big Evil by Rome in its early days; Irish and
Italian immigrants were seen as the cause of societal problems at points in
American history; mid-twentieth century America was also mostly against
homosexuality (and still in many fundamentalist circles this is the case)
and each of these groups (there being many others) have received the brunt
of viciousness from others.

Maybe it's a tendency in all humans to be vicious (some less and some
more) - I don't think it's something that needs to be emptied out of humans,
it's part of being human - directing viciousness towards legitimate targets,
such as racists and others of that category (those who are vicious and
oppressive themselves) is a good outlet for this. Maybe racism itself is
even a sort of misdirected energy, that could be put to better use fighting
real problems, rather than perceived ones clustered around xenophobia, etc.

If someone accuses you of being vicious against racists, this is really
something of a compliment, I'd think -

I think this is a really, really interesting topic -- Viciousness.
Last evening, I obsessed about the need to create more kindness, care, =
patience, tolerance, and generosity in the world, especially KINDNESS, =
though.  Or at least that's the quality that interests me.  Seems to me =
that everybody, including poets and artists, reveres talent, =
intelligence, genius, but we neglect to value kindness adequately.  I'd =
like to talk more about this at another time. =20
For now I want (also) to say a thing (or two) about Viciousness.  I =
agree with Brent.  I believe that both viciousness and hatred are =
"okay," if not desirable.  I am, myself, extremely vicious towards the =
neocons.  I don't know if there is any rational or real way to =
rationalize my visciousness towards them.  I work "underground" to =
slander them and undermine them.  (This is, or may be, obviously, an =
incredible contradiction to my affirmation of KINDNESS, above, although =
perhaps all of this is selective, and "giving kindness" towards one =
subset of global friends may necessitate putting one's own life, and =
artistic aspirations for reputation, at risk in the exercise of =
"viciousness" towards other subsets of global co-inhabitants.)
I suppose that if my life were adequately hunky-dory and I were very =
little effected by the kinds of suffering engendered by the last three =
years of crazy political events, I would not "care so much," and I know =
darn well that certain extremes of "caring" are often merely =
manifestations of personality problems.  Yes, often the only really sane =
resolution to certain suffering is to "take care of oneself," "get one's =
own, deeper psychosocial issues taken care of."  No, that isn't the same =
as being well-provided for by acquiescence to the power inequalities =
that cause others to suffer and insulate "the average bourgeois" from =
concern for others.=20
Anyway, these are both related and not necessarily related, issues, =
"kindness" and "viciousness."  I don't have a lot of answers, but I =
think they are topics worth writing about.
I'm glad Brent broached the subject(s).

Being vicious toward racists is not ok.  I think it is something else, though,
in play.  First, in any given academic group no one wants to be seen as racist.
And so the tendency is to project this on to another -- a teacher who may be a
little more conservative than the rest, etc.  And this is to create a bond
within an inner group that wants to be seen as virtuous.  No one ever talks
about their own racism.  But it is very easy to lay all problems at the foot of
another person so that we can feel virtuous.  This trick is called
scapegoating.  It's an insidious trick inside all left-wing circles that I've
known.  I would welcome a critic who was willing to read a text from the
viewpoint of outing their own racism.  It is only too easy to out someone
else's, though, and I think it is vicious to ever imply that we are perfect and
somebody else should have their head kicked in, or their work should be burned,
or their name should be forgotten, or permanently marred.  There is a bigger
picture in each person, and we ought to try to grasp that.

I think one way to combat it is to be compassionate toward all parties and
remember the saying, "Let the one who is without sin cast the first stone."

But that would take all the fun out of it.

To be vicious is always wrong.

We were not meant to be perfect, and in pretending to be, we become vicious, and
we lend credibility to that viciousness through our mistakenly believing that in
certain instances (oh, if we could only find them!) it is virtuous to be
vicious.

But it is never virtuous to be vicious.  Never ever.

Even in war we are not permitted to be vicious.  We can defend a neighbor, but
we can't go so far as to allow ourselves to become maniacs unable to distinguish
right from wrong, or simply to tell any falsehood in order to gain something, or
to wipe out an entire society.  We can do our best to right a completely sick
society -- such as Hitler's -- but then we are beholden to that same country to
help them on their feet once more.  That's it. If we allow ourselves to become
vicious in the process of righting others, then we have committed an equal
crime, or perhaps even a greater crime.

As for the Finnish stuff -- I read this stuff about the Mongolian connection in
the back of the Tampere University journal.  I don't see why it would be more
racist to be connected to Mongolia than to Germany.  That in itself seems racist
-- implying that it's ok to be a German, but not a Mongolian.  I wasn't
knowingly telling any falsehoods about my existence in Finland, as Anselm Hollo
implies that I was.  I am almost never attacked here in America, but in Finland
was quite often threatened.  As for language.  Of course, Anselm is Finnish,
with deep roots there, and probably does have more knowledge of Finnish
linguistic roots since he grew up there, and translates from the language.  How
could he not know more?  I welcome the correction, but not the implication that
I was knowingly telling a lie.  And I wasn't saying that Finland was worse than
any other place.  I was saying that in spite of it being about as perfect as a
human society could get, it nevertheless has problems which are apparent to
anyone who doesn't look Finnish.  It does, however, have one of the highest
standards of living in the world, and it bears more attention as a model for our
society in terms of its ability to create a rather even economic structure in
which there is a greater concern for the disadvantaged --.

Anselm, if you are still there -- could you tell the story of the Finnish
revolution, and answer the question as to whether or not it was ever a "fascist"
society, as someone on this list has claimed it was (ever since the First World
War, I think he was implying, and certainly during the years with the pact
against Stalin).  I didn't know whether that designation could really be used
for Finland.  I wanted to argue not, but I have little credibility here.  Yours
is no doubt sterling.  I would like your take, and I'm sure many others would,
too.

Kirby, you're probably right, although this has been a "logical" =
prescription for heaven knows how long.  In addition, what's the context =
of the so-called "viciousness?"
Public writing, poetry, political propaganda, newspaper or television =
journalism?  Or guerilla "warfare," internet "propaganda?"
"To be vicious is always wrong."  You're probably right, but this is an =
absolute.  How can it be "always" the case?
"Even in war we are not permitted to be vicious."  Yeah, maybe so, but =
what if a nicely timed act of "viciousness" somehow stopped a series of =
steps that otherwise lead to violence and war?

I know my ramblings are goofy here, but I wonder what Hamlet would have =
thought of "viciousness."=20

P.S. Kirby, by the way, I owe you an email backchannel about a post that =
I missed while on vacation this summer.  Will send ya a note soon.  :)

Ah.

I was thinking of viciousness more as a sense of exceedingly strong or
fierce opposition - this differs from the correct definition of "vicious"
which does carry a meaning different from what I had in mind. What can I
ascribe this too - maybe a less-literal idea of viciousness.

So this is true - I certainly don't support the use of injurious means
against anyone. I do think that it's good to voice strong opposition against
human rights crimes, racism, and so on - not because it makes me feel
virtuous per se, but because it _is_ right to oppose what is fundamentally
wrong.

Opposition should be undertaken in a sober manner, recognizant of, as you
say, the bigger picture. Compassion should reign over reproof - this is
really more what I had in mind with viciousness - mind that the word
"violence" can also be rendered not to mean a physical act of destruction,
but also as fervency.

So I suppose that one can discuss racism while being vicious (vice-ious) and
not virtuous - it though it can be otherwise. I suppose this goes back to my
post suggesting that the search for racism is often taken too far.

Ah, ah, did I flip flop? I'm not sure. Maybe I just went entirely off-topic.
I still think it's right to put full effort for fighting for a just cause,
and opposing unjust causes.

I think I'll go scurry to the kitchen and make coffee.

Steve - glad you liked my post - liked yours, too. Maybe I'll backchannel a
reply once I do this, since I'm up to my limit now, aha.

kirby, i wrote "ethical" not "virtuous."  i share your gut
squeamishness abt showy piety, but surely one might be permitted to
care about and discuss stuff beyond form.  somehow this charge, of
irrelevance and/or hypocrisy, seems to crop up to halt discussions of
race on poetix.  why? why isn't this as valid a topic for discussion
as anything else?

depends on the company you keep. there are lots of things people talk
about but not in public. i bet in confessionals, anti-racism
workshops, twelve-step groups, co-counseling sessions, etc, people do
talk about this in self-critical or exploratory ways, along with
discussions of their homophobia, sexism, classism, and other
"character defects".  why is discussion of *race* such a lightning
rod?  you paint in very broad strokes, kirby, not attending to the
nuances of academic life and selling a lot of folks very short.

Kirby,

Your dictum strikes me as rather manichaean or even circular.  When
someone speaks of virtue, they are merely covering vice...in which case
why talk about virtue at all?  In any case "virtue" in philosophical
discussions is code for Alasdair McIntyre and others attempts to
narrativize ethics and sometimes bring in religious discourse.  This all
and good, but there are many of us who believe that religion and ethics
are not one and the same thing.

Robert

This gets stranger with each exchange -- why "any given academic group"?
wouldn't it follow that somebody who isn't a racist wouldn't want to be seen as
racist?  what's this about "projecting" onto another, in the course of which we
seem to see a disturbing slippage between racism and conservatism -- which no
"academic" I have ever heard anywhere would ever confuse -- the assertion
appears to be that some conservative somewhere, clearly not racist, has been
accused of racism simply for being conservative -- George Schuyler was a
conservative who wasn't a racist -- John Ashcroft is a conservative who likes
to hang out with the Conservatice Citizens Council, which had previously been
incorporated as the White Citizens Council -- think we can't tell the
difference?  Strom Thurmond had no trouble talking about his own racism; he
just had trouble talking about the fact of his black offspring --

The editors and editorial board of the JCRT are pleased to announce the
release of the December 2003 issue of The Journal for Cultural and
Religious Theory. This marks our fifth year of publication as an free and
peer-reviewed academic journal.

http://www.jcrt.org/current.html

This issue features an article by Tobin Siebers examining representations
of violence in contemorary art, which Siebers interprets through the
religious rubric of "ritual." John Meeks offers a retrospective on the
significance of the life and work of the late Edward Said for the study of
religion. Three articles center on the notion of "writing": David Hale on
writing and transgression, Lars Iyer on testimony, Judaism and the infinite=
,
and Darlene M. Juschka on writing and ethnography in the work of Michael
Taussig. Avron Kulak contributes a piece on the methodological affinities
between Kierkegaard and Derrida, and C. Jason Lee proposes a new
understanding of historicizing by way of the work of Andy Warhol.

Also included in this issue are four reviews of recent books by J=FCrgen
Habermas, Gabriel Vahanian, Graham Ward, and Gerald Bruns. The issue is
introduced by Senior Editor Carl Raschke, who argues for a proper valuation
of the work of Georges Bataille not only within the Western philosophical
tradition, but as progenitor of what has come to be called the
"post-modern,"
a movement Raschke understands as operating according to an inherently
religious logic.

The JCRT invites submissions which should be sent to Clayton Crockett,

Robbins, Review Editor at <reviews@jcrt.org>.

Reconstruction of a Lost Poem
(dream version)


There was something about countervailing,
travels of the eye.  The split skull, star seesaw.
Children planted on the ground
like artificial weeds.

A forgetting of scales.
A sense of balancing left
with whatever we're left with.

And Fishes held to a gun,
old traditions of waking.


- Jill Chan

Shapes


There’s something strangely
unrelenting about the concept
of birth, the kind you
struggle against after
the first, after knowing better

In squares, the last:
the whitewashed frame
now only a part of the window
in all the houses

Love carries you
nowhere
yet smells like loaded summer,
the given air
you breathe as your own

foo.ipk.gz


in order to use an infrared keyboard with the zaurus linux pda, i had to
download an ipk driver file. i tried to install with ipkg and kept getting
error messages. call the file foo.ipk. so i gzipped foo.ipk producing
foo.ipk.gz. i then changed the name to foo.ipk. then i installed with ipkg
without the error. ipkg was foo-led with the hidden .gz. ipkg didn't
realize that the file in the first place didn't need zipping and
unzipping. ipkg would bow out because it couldn't unzip. it couldn't unzip
because foo.ipk in the first place wasn't zipped. after it was zipped,
ipkg could then unzip. once unzipped ipkg could then continue the
installation.

there is a message here about the phenomenology of protocols. i prefer to
look at it as a trick i learned to do. i learned to foo-l ipkg. i swelled
with pride at my accomplishment.

Mime-Version: 1.0

I've recently started reading Steve Shaviro's Connected or What it
Means to Live in the Network Society and think it would be of
interest to many folks on this list. (For one minor thing, what other
book about science fiction and the internet starts out with an array
of quotes that include lines by John Ashbery & Jack Spicer?)

The blurb by Samuel R Delany has some bearing on the recent
discussion on the list about how to refer to science fiction. FWIW,
Delany, who I think is unquestionably located within the science
fiction community, uses the term "sci-fi" rather than "SF". The full
quote is: "These intelligent, entertaining, and intricate readings of
our cultural superstructure - the sci-fi of Jeter, Dick, and Gibson,
the heyday of Napster, and the early years of all-but-total Web
freedom - now and again cast a harsh slantlight on the infrastructure
that holds so much contemporary misery in place. This is a book to
keep the mind agile and the spirit lively."

 << As for the Finnish stuff -- I read this stuff about the Mongolian
connection in

the back of the Tampere University journal. >>

This must have been some sort of Dada-Fascistoid joke.

<< I don't see why it would be more racist to be connected to Mongolia than
to Germany. >>

Because it was, as I said before, a late 19th / early 20th century theory
favored by Hitler's precursors, including some right-wing Finland Swedes.

<< That in itself seems racist -- implying that it's ok to be a German, but
not a Mongolian. >>

The geneticists cited do not claim Finns *are* Germans, but that they are
genetically predominantly *Germanic* -- as are the Swedes, Norwegians (Olson,
yes?), Danes, and to a considerable degree, the so-called "Anglo-Saxons."


<< Anselm, if you are still there -- could you tell the story of the Finnish

revolution, and answer the question as to whether or not it was ever a
"fascist"

society, as someone on this list has claimed it was (ever since the First
World

War, I think he was implying, and certainly during the years with the pact

against Stalin).  I didn't know whether that designation could really be used

for Finland.  I wanted to argue not, but I have little credibility here.  ...
  I would like your take, and I'm sure many others would, too. >>

No, Finland was never a "fascist society."  The Finnish Civil War, which
coincided with the Russian revolution and World War One, was fought between the
Haves (so-called Whites) and the Have Nots (so-called Reds), with all the
viciousness typical of such conflicts.  Had the Reds won, Finland would have become
a colony of the Soviet Union, as did Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, its neighbors
in the Baltic region.  Considerable numbers of studies about this conflict
have been published in recent years.  Can't say that I've perused all of them,
but my general sense is that classic atrocities (e.g. mass executions of
prisoners) were committed by both sides.  The Whites' victory ensured Finland's
hard-won independence until the country was attacked by the Soviet Union in 1939.
Outnumbered fifty to one, the Finns managed to fight the Soviets to a
standstill / armistice in 1940/41.  When Hitler abrogated his pact with Stalin and
invaded Russian soil, Finland was coerced into acting as a base of operations
and provider of military manpower.  When it became obvious that the Germans
would not conquer Russia, the Finns made a separate peace with the Soviets and
engaged in a brief war against the German troops stationed in Finland as they
withdrew via Lapland into Norway (which they were still occupying).  Numerous
Northern Finnish towns and villages were burnt down by the Germans as they
retreated.

As must be obvious from the story of my life (for which, if interested, see:
Caws and Causeries: Around Poetry and Poets, La Alameda / University of New
Mexico Press, 1999), I found existence in that small country too restrictive
half a century ago and left for Austria, the UK, and the U.S., which has become
my homeland for better and for worse.  I am, however, quite proud of its
history as a severely oppressed country and people -- a *colony* of Sweden for SIX
HUNDRED years, a colony of Russia for TWO HUNDRED! -- that despite this
circumstance managed to forge a distinctive literature, music, and art, all of which
are kept in high regard by the rest of Europe.

Should anyone here be interested in the work of one of Finland's most
remarkable poets, Pentti Saarikoski (1937-83), I recommend TRILOGY, La Alameda / U of
NM Press, 2003, translated by and with a foreword by yours truly.

Protesting Somalis Face Indefinite Incarceration
by Lloyd Nicholas
Special to the NNPA from The Insight News Group

Minneapolis (NNPA) - Some 20 persons of Somali origin who were detained
by the Department of Homeland Security (INS) over the last few years
remain incarcerated for an indefinite period says Omar Jamal, executive
director, Somali Justice Advocacy Center.

ìWe spoke to Homeland Security on Monday, Dec. 15, and the situation
looks grim. The authorities said the detainees will not be released, but

if they request to be returned to Somalia, some arrangement could be
worked out,î reported Jamal in an interview.

The Somali Justice Advocacy Center here had expressed concern about the
conditions of the Somali immigrant detainees, some of whom were
transferred to Oak Park Heights prison in Stillwater, Minn., after a
protest riot broke out at the Rush City Detention Center in late
November.

The detainees had refused to return to their cells and demanded a
resolution of their immigration status after a protracted period of
incarceration.

The Somali Human Rights Association, in investigating the prison
disturbance, warned that some of the the 20 refugees detained, ìhave
been in legal limbo for years now, lingering in indefinite detention.î

The problem, explained Jamal, ìis the reality that Somalia does not
exist as a country and is under the control of armed elements who are
likely to place the lives of returning refugees at risk and under U.S.
law, refugees cannot be returned to a place that is not recognized as a
country. And since these groups of detainees are not allowed legal
status, they are detained indefinitely, this is not much different from
a life sentence,î said Jamal.

Meanwhile, a Somali news report stated recently that proposed peace
talks among Somali political groups were abandoned. The talks,
originally scheduled for December 9, then postponed to December 18 have
been put off again, said the IRIN News Agency.

Ugandan President, Yoweri Museveni, a facilitator of the peace
initiative, is trying to arrange a meeting of Somali leaders in Kampala.

The purpose of the original 10-day talks, due to be held in Mombasa, was

ìto give the leaders a chance to iron out outstanding issues and engage
in personal reconciliationî, IRIN reported.

Talks have been underway since October 2002 and have been dogged by
wrangles over issues such as an interim charter, the number of
participants and the selection of future parliamentarians

STARCHERONE TO BE DISTRIBUTED BY SPD

SMALL PRESS DISTRIBUTION (SPD) has informed STARCHERONE BOOKS that the =
non-profit fiction publisher will be added to SPD's list of publishers =
in 2004. Founded in 1969, SPD is the leading distributor of books by =
small and independent literary publishers, and this decision not only =
means effective national distribution for Starcherone Books but =
recognition of the importance and necessity of the Starcherone mission =
-- to publish innovative fiction by new writers and reprints of classic =
avant-garde texts. Starcherone would like to thank its supporters -- =
which include established writers, bookstore owners, editors, and =
friends who have done us countless favors, small and large. 2004 looks =
to be Starcherone's best year yet, beginning with publication of Woman =
with Dark Horses by Aimee Parkison, the winner of our 2003 manuscript =
contest, in June (advance copies will be available at AWP in late =
March), and continuing with the announcement of our 2nd contest winner =
in August and the publication of a yet-untitled collection by Kenneth =
Bernard by the end of the year. If you are receiving this announcement, =
you have our thanks. We hope to repay your enthusiasm for Starcherone =
Books by continuing to counter the profit-driven fiction industry, =
bringing out interesting new work of artistic integrity for years to =
come.

'first-person film-making'
we think we know we are

Less the equivalence between the representation and its impulse than
the recognition of the necessity of this division for the turbulence
it produced when disturbances of the conventions were no longer
enough, and this gives the writing its anxiety, its self-conscious
ambition and the overload on the circuits, the codes, could this have
happened only in an expressive mode?

"We ought to know well enough by this date the dangers of certain
kinds of sympathetic identifications with the racially, sexually, or
gendered other as being ways of appropriating another's power....
It is thus easy to forget how identification across social divisions
like race, gender, sexuality, and class can have two very different
consequences: first, the author can subvert false divisions by
establishing a communality with the imagined other; second, the author
can submerge the difference of the other by claiming it as the
author's own." (Literary Culture and U.S. Imperialism, 148).

Rowe's problem disappears once any effort at identification is
disavowed by purging the representation of its pretense to sympathetic
affect, as though the writing had the power to make the other's
persecution its own, especially if and when subversions tend to
collapse back into the dominant code. Ernie Gehr's 1970 institutional
hallway situates the viewer in an electric grid where the architectural
severity of those pulsating frames' double location, the boxcar, all
historical memory of which has been effaced by space and light, has
been transmuted into the pure appearance of luminous immunity.

Senghor once wrote how he was writing like a machine gun, after the
automatic writing of the French surrealists, then taken prisoner by
the Germans, he started reading Goethe. It was the prestige of
military power that turned the colonial subject, that fabled subaltern
of so many theoretical fictions, from one space of writing to another,
and such an example might remind anyone writing in English of the
threat of the possibility that they are writing on the back of a tank
qualitatively different than Tiennamen Square.

"It was at the end of the year 1941. I was in Poitiers in a camp for
prisoners of war from the colonies. There had been, between 1930 and
1939, the intoxicating years of the New Black in France. Armed with
the miraculous weapons of automatic writing, faster than machine guns.
After the defeat of France and the West in 1940, with the lucidity of
sunrise, Goethe appeared before my eyes in all the colors of the
rainbow's balance of beauty born of polytechnical culture more than
from encyclopedic instruction. But what is Culture?" (Editions de
Seuil, 1964).

The immense prestige that accompanies military conquest. There has to
be a resolution to this problem, the memory of the mass grave as the
future the writing will inhabit, without having to hate the language
one is writing in for having to write into it the guilt or
condemnation of the privileged and privileging 'Western' voice and its
capacity for assimilative inclusions.

Senghor answers his own question this way: "The problem is how to
transform the false opposition assimilation-association, and to give
to Culture its dialectical movement by constructing a productive
dialogue between two civilizations towards an equilibrium."

That would be a culture of translation. Perhaps the reverse process is
the historical moment being undergone now, accelerating conflicts to
forestall the dialectic (the Western unvoicing?), and accepting vast
thresholds of destruction to preserve false oppositions, and the
paradox is this: the overcoming of those oppositions can't happen on
an idealized smooth global surface free of the ideological honing of
divisions across national, racial, sexual, gendered and class
subjectivities?

Finally, Anselm -- could you clarify one more thing.  I had reckoned
that the Lutheran background of the Nordic countries had something to do
with their liberal nature.  You were raised as a Lutheran -- as were
almost all Finns, and almost all the Nordic people.  Would you say that
the reason that Finland is a socialist democracy (a true one, rather
than in name only) has something to do with that Lutheran background?
If so, could you put your finger on it?  Or would you say rather that it
was something else that contributed to the general sense of equality
between the classes in those countries (comparatively speaking to
America, for instance).  I'm not sure you're going to think that's so,
but if so, how would you account for it?  I've been arguing that it's
the Lutheranism, and this has of course infuriated some.  What led to
the amazing social programs in the Nordic countries?  Was it the church,
or was it Marxists, or some kind of combo?  I honestly don't know the
history of this, and thought you might.  While you're on the line, I
might as well ask in order to clarify this.  I would love to know.

Maria, your response deserves a response, but it's a long history that I
will have to cut short.  My distaste for chasing racists as an academic
parlor game is that it is too easy, principally.  A group of people
decide that someone is racist, and then it's too often in my experience
like a bunch of hounds chasing a fox.  I feel sorry for the fox.  Too
often this is what I experience as the discussion of racism.

But let's trace this discussion of race, and gender (almost nobody cares
to talk about class any more because almost everybody who has the luxury
to have a conversation like this is at least in the middle class even if
they didn't start there).  I think it can be traced back to two principle
sources -- Tel quel in the Seventies (Kristeva, Barthes, Derrida,
Foucault, to name principle members) and to Simone de Beauvoir and her
circle in the fifties.  The Cultural Revolution that these two groups set
out to launch was based on Maoism.  As Simone de Beauvoir put it in
Sartre's journal, the attempt to "stigmatize those who use sexist images"
was what they were setting out to do.  Historically, this is fairly easy
to verify as an outcome of Maoism.  Simone de Beauvoir wrote a book on
Maoism, and she and Sartre were still handing out Maoist pamphlets in
Paris in the 1970s.  This is common knowledge if you were ever a member
of any anarchist circle, which I was.  The other group (Tel quel) was
also very powerfully connected to Maoism.  Kristeva also wrote a very
important book on Mao (Chinese Women) and Tel Quel's Manifesto (1971)
praised Maoism and ended with the phrase, Vive Mao!

Take Maoism, and add it to the Revolutionary rhetoric of France -- and
you've got a bloody mess with heads flying in every direction.

The rhetoric of St. Just, Marat, Robespierre, Danton, and that whole
gang, has completely infected French thought.  It's disgusting to read
the way those people went after one another in the name of Virtue.  The
surrealists under Breton did the same thing to one another.  It's
completely disgusting the way that Philippe Soupault was thrown out of
the group for smoking English cigarettes.  It's the way a lynch mob
works, and it's called scapegoating.

Everybody shits, and shit stinks.  To say that someone else is a shitter
-- yes, you are the one that shits -- and therefore you should be called
and your name should be erased, doesn't make any sense, right?  In the
same way you yourself said it was impossible not to be a racist in a
racist society, if I recall correctly.  Therefore, if you want to talk
about your own racism -- I would welcome that.  I would totally welcome
it.  But to talk about someone else's without implicating yourself, and
especially if the discussion gets vicious, I feel is not only unfair, but
sets up a contagion of Sadistic bloodlust that people seem only too
willing to jump into, and doesn't seem to be have a historical basis in
American discourse in which giving the other guy a right to speak is a
given.

I don't know if I should have said anything.  I would never do it in
person.  I'm too timid.  I just get up and go, generally.  I think it's a
disgusting act to scapegoat others and I've seen it happen too often.
Scapegoating is a terrible process.  I've seen it happen so often that at
this point when I even smell it in the air I get sick to my stomach.

Aldon Nielsen and others may have more to say on this than I do.  Maybe
their attacks on racism are more nuanced than the ones I'm used to in
which there is no regard for truth.  I really should read his books.  I
intended to do that over the break but ended up reading John Updike for a
class I have to teach (I hadn't previously read Updike).  I think that if
we make such charges against anyone living or dead we'd better be careful
about it, and not get too enthusiastic, and also remember that this very
swiftly turns into scapegoating (I'm not sure if anybody's read Girard in
this group, but I'm using his theories).  So I say talk about your own
racism all you want, and implicate yourself.  If you talk about someone
else's, it seems to me that there is a presumption of your own purity
(you don't shit, or that your shit doesn't stink), and this sets up the
terrible process of finding that unlucky bastard's who does and lynching
them.

I actually have never broached this topic before.  I usually stay away
from it.  But part of the reason for wanting to be on this board was that
I had hoped to discuss poetry.  It seems that nobody much does this.  I
read mostly politics.  I'm extremely interested in contemporary poetry,
but the only conversations that appear to take place on this topic of
poetry are ones that I've started.

Meanwhile, it seems to me, at least, that the entire academic world is
talking about race and gender.  If you go through the MLA listings that's
all it is, and it is all or almost all conducted with a holier than thou
sensibility in which some poor writer is given a kind of Inquisition
treatment with the implication being that Hemingway, or Tolkein, or
whomever, should be permanently silenced and he was such a prick and I'm
so perfect.  It seems to me that this stems from the French revolution's
rhetoric that has made its way through surrealism and various French
schools, and has been magnified by the Maoist Cultural Revolution --
witht he implication that anybody who's not with us should be sent to
Manchuria.

I also hate the rightist discourse in this country.  But there seems to
be only two options, and the right for the most isn't interested in
poetry at all.  I think I might know one Republican poet who has read
Frank O'hara.  If there's a third way -- where people will talk about
poetry, implicate themselves if they make a charge, please point me there
and I will go.  Meanwhile, I guess my job is to point out what I see as
vicious behavior, and try to create a discourse community.  I don't have
one otherwise, and am grateful for what I do get from this board and the
chance to interact with others.  I'd go elsewhere if there's another
place where people are talking about poetry more than politics, and
somebody could point me there, and then you guys would be free to talk
all you wish about the racial crimes of Tolkein without my pointing out
how unfair it all is.  Right now you're all I've got as I'm in an
extremely rural area.  I do have one other board, but there are only
about five posters on that board.  I love that there are so many on this
board and I keep getting to know new people.  I have emailed Ron
Silliman, and Mairead Byrne, and Murat, and Kazim Ali, and lots of other
people who've intrigued me.  And Maria, I remember you too as a friend
and am surprised to come across you again.  Just try not to upset me too
much, or try to send me elsewhere, or try to get me thrown me off the
board.  As long as I'm here, I will say what I think, and feel that
everybody else should, too.

Anselm,

Your history (and attitude towards Finland) is remarkably similar to my=20
attitude towards Turkey and its literature, though I can not say that Turkis=
h=20
history during the Ottoman Empire was quite a history of victimization. On t=
he=20
other hand, during the time of the Turkish Republic and World War II, Turkey=
, the=20

nd=20
allies which maybe what Finland wished it could have done.

Turkish territorial push and shove with the Russians also goes for several=20
hundred years. The Bosphorus, the doorway to the Meditteranean, was the grea=

prize the Russians always coveted. Interestingly, Istanbul/Constantinople -w=

Istanbul plays a central part.

I sensed a subtext in the exchanges between Kirby and you during the last=20
week. I was struck particularly since Kirby had told me that he had written=20=

you. Is the relationship of the Finns with the fascists and communists durin=

This is a question to Kirby Olson: Why would you be hated in Finland?

Hi- I've been reading the same book and am having difficulty, especially
since I'm somewhat resistant to Baudrillard/Virilio etc. - a style which
encompassses a considerable degree of rhetoric.

For example, Shaviro states that the network is shaped like a fractal,
self-similar across all scales. But if you look at, for example, the
actual construction of Networks from Petrie nets through the Internet
itself - and if you look at the protocols, processes, ad objects, across
these networks or subtending them - this isn't true at all. I find myself
trying to give into the poetics of the writing and at the same time - I
find myself increasingly critical. Statements which are almost true or
rhetorically moving, can build up, one after another, until a very
problematic state occurs.

I'd say more here but have the feeling my thinking is blurred; I'm working
on a PDA that I'm also programming and everything's a bit iffy at the
moment, including my spelling.

Alan

My late father in law was born in Finland, and he spent a lot of his
life theorizing on the relationship between the Finns and just about
everyone. They were a lost tribe, they discovered mezzo-america, etc.

Call for Submissions:
We are looking for a diverse, international cross-section of women
writers for a global anthology on the politics of water. Confluence: A
Global Anthology of Women's Voices on the Politics of Water will combine
poetry, short fiction, testimonial accounts, and essays on how water
crosses various political boundaries be they national, racial, ethnic,
class, or gender. This anthology is a response to the growing concern
over the role of water in our increasingly fragile environment, a
concern that is sure to become more anxiety prone in the 21st Century as
debates over modernization and development become more acrid. It will
incorporate a range of issues such as droughts and floods, waste
management, dams and irrigation, water pollution, water as a national or
racial barrier, and water as a feminine space over which the masculine
process of industrialization claims agency. The work will address water
as myth, metaphor, and material reality. Guidelines for creative
writing: Poetry submissions should not exceed 5 pages. Flash fiction
should be between100-500 words and short fiction and memoirs between
2000-3000 words. Submit to: Paola Corso, 133 8th Avenue #4E, Brooklyn,
NY 11215 paola_corso@hotmail.com Guidelines for essays: Essays should
not exceed 5,000 words.

Coeditors:
Paola Corso is a 2003 New York Foundation for the Arts poetry fellow.
Her poetry and fiction are set in her native Pittsburgh river town and
explore the environmental impact of industrialization from a
working-class perspective. She and Dr. Anna Kay France co-edited the
book, International Women Playwrights. She currently teaches a prose
workshop at Fordham University. Nandita Ghosh is an assistant professor
at Farleigh Dickinson University where she teaches courses on
literature, culture, and the environment. She was involved in mobilizing
active support in the US against the construction of the Maheshwar dam
on the River Narmada and has networked with members of the Narmada
Bachao Andolan (a grassroots movement in India protesting the
environmental damage and human displacement caused by damming the River
Narmada), as well as various human rights and environmental groups based
in the US.

I seem to be sending this poem to the wrong address.  Perhaps it will finally

(oh dear, I continue it here, I hope)

glistening, wet, cool.
It is primeval, this feel.
I smile, lift my hand
and throw the stone back into the river.
Now it rests calmly, shiny, wet with river.
I smile again.
What a joining --
stone, river, hand--
microd-universe:
earth's craving, earth's fulfillment.

Imagine a scary world.


We will not be safe from Iraq
until their population exists
in trailer park conditions.

Post-tornado.

And the aftermath?

We will not insult
a $1.52 bag of pork rinds.

We will not ask
what that would cost in Euros.

We will enjoy watching Westerns,
with the millions disappointed
in the U.S. economy
removed to junk-food prisons.

Sounds like Bush's reasons for going to war. My theory is that the
proportion of Americans bought the administration's story is [in]verse to
those who read Sci-fi.

I will be reading from my new book:  iduna, O Books, Poetry, 102 pages, =20=

ISBN # 1-882022-49-1, $12.00, 2003.

Distributed by SPD: 1341 Seventh Street, Berkeley CA 94710. =20
http://www.spdbooks.org/


Leslie Scalapino says iduna is experiment in which the text (like a =20
personality) is as if 'set' to proceed by accident and mistakes of =20
machine - but then, as such, in the workings of its 'accidents' (as if =20=

she is margins of pages and words from ads and 'theory' which are =20
composing and revealing her: as if personality which is a machine/and =20=

thus the text is akin to the memory of a Replicant in Blade Runner) the =20=

effect is seeing passionate/ 'personal'/'emotional' (un)programmed =20
memory and responses.



Steve McCaffery says about iduna "If benign linearity marks the last =20
vestige of Cartesian consciousness, Vitruvian space and Spinozan =20
ethics, then iduna signalizes its catalectic adieu. For there is no =20
return after this. Kari Edwards has written and conceived a bold, =20
complex text that pushes lyricism to the brink of an interstice, =20
between the Dictionary and its scream. Auto-translative, =20
self-contaminatory, iduna never renounces its splendid linguistic =20
excess, fabricating a textural world of legibility and illegibility, =20
gravitation and non-gravitation, that powers its dweller (for one must =20=

dwell in iduna) gesturally around and among its morphs and torques. If =20=

Deleuze and Guattari are correct when they aver that writing 'has =20
nothing to do with signifying. It has to do with surveying, mapping, =20
even realms that are yet to come' then iduna provides a special map to =20=

a certain dream of Coleridge's: the frontiers of a post-cognitive."



Johanna Drucker says about iduna "Paratexts and processing suggestions =20=

stream through Kari Edwards's iduna... The constant drive to make use =20=

of formal possibilities at the level of page and opening brings graphic =20=

format into substantive play...A machinic drive echoes in this work as =20=

a human, subjective voice struggles to come through the registers of =20
current language events, noise, news, records, communications. The =20
shape of a human outcry presses through the mass of mediated material. =20=

Form embodies possibilities enabled by the instructions of forced =20
justification, font shifts, hard returns, tabs, chunked blocks, and =20
other basic elements of text processing...Before we can ask what =20
something means when we read it, we must ask what it means to read - =20
and Edwards poses that as a high-stakes question providing the point of =20=

departure for current poetic production."



Chris Tysh says about iduna "Having evacuated the endemic patriarchal =20=

script, Edwards writes hir own rules of the game in the wee hours when =20=

the sky turns green and binary logic decamps posthaste. Under the ruins =20=

of gender, iduna is a wild garden where 'sexuality begets language.' =20
The anarchic profusion of voices, discourses, idiolects, fonts and =20
typographies that seem to rain down upon the page becomes the new =20
'formlessness' which is the political signature of this resistant and =20=

I'll refrain from comment on the subject line, I'll just note that many
Russians could be described thus (as long as one isn't too worried about political
correctness).  Then again, as we all know, Russia was "started" by (albino?
no, redhead -- RUS, hence Russia) Vikings (Novgorod, etc.) ...  !  And many
Finns are dark-haired, brown-eyed, and tan well, especially ones from the Eastern
regions.

<< Would you say that the reason that Finland is a socialist democracy (a
true one, rather than in name only) has something to do with that Lutheran
background?

If so, could you put your finger on it?  Or would you say rather that it was
something else that contributed to the general sense of equality between the
classes in those countries (comparatively speaking to America, for instance). >>

I'd say church religion has much less to do with anything there than it has
in this country.  "Lutheran," in Scandinavia, basically just means "Reformed,"
not "Catholic" (either Roman or Orthodox).  U.S. American fractiousness,
divisiveness, cliquishness in church matters seems to me a British heritage --
sectarianism, originally (as with The Society of Friends,  the Shakers, the
Unitarians) a lovely rebellious idea -- but increasingly, in the last couple of
centuries, mainly a *class marker* in this country, especially in the South
(Presbyterians above Methodists Methodists above Baptists Baptists above Catholics
-- Episcopalians out in left field, too progressive and socially engaged to
quite fit into the hierarchy, except for being better educated and thus at least
upper middle class).

<< What led to the amazing social programs in the Nordic countries? >>

Probably a genuine, shared belief in community, "the rights of man (and
woman)."  Generically "Christian" as well as Socialist (or Social-Democratic) ideas
of the worth of each and every human being.  Also the sense of being united
in resistance to oppression for some eight hundred years, in Finland.  I'm sure
that what I tend to think of as U.S. American Neo-Feudalism is making inroads
on the social fabric there as well as everywhere else in the world.
Dog-eat-dog Social Darwinism was considered disgustingly old hat when I was growing up

Bookseller Lowell brought poetry, passion to his work=20
01/11/04
Karen Sandstrom=20
Plain Dealer Book Editor

High technology might have helped rare book dealer Jim Lowell sell a few mor=
e=20
volumes, but he wanted none of it. When poet Kent Taylor accompanied Lowell=20
to the library last year, Taylor intended to show Lowell the World Wide Web.=
=20
Lowell's eyes glazed over.=20
For 40 years, Lowell sold books through his store, Asphodel, which he starte=
d=20
in Cleveland and eventually moved to Auburn Township. He ran his business an=
d=20
his life in his own fashion. He was a man unequivocally himself, yet willing=
=20
to share what he knew.=20
He had been battling multiple illnesses recently and died last Sunday at 71.=
=20
His wife, Tessa, lost her partner of 39 years. The world of books and cultur=
e=20
lost a quiet warrior.=20
Those who knew him longed to introduce him to those who didn't. A difficult=20
task, after someone has died, but with Lowell it was a challenge even in lif=
e.=20
"He hated to be interviewed," recalls friend Jake Marx.=20
Educated at Western Reserve University, Lowell built his business out of his=
=20
passion for books. Asphodel opened in a small space in the Old Arcade,=20
stocking first editions and other rarities, including the small-press releas=
es by=20
those toiling in the vibrant Cleveland poetry scene of the day.=20
Kent Taylor was one of those poets. So was d.a. levy, a famous (and famously=
=20
tragic) counterculture writer and publisher in Cleveland. For some, the 1963=
=20
opening of Asphodel marked the beginning of an era of heightened political a=
nd=20
intellectual energy in the city, while levy's suicide death in 1968 signifie=
d=20
its end.=20
Writers and poets were thrilled to find Asphodel, where the stock was so=20
different from what was sold at mainstream stores. Lowell had wide-ranging y=
et=20
specific tastes.=20
He loved the work of William Carlos Williams and Charles Olson, and was a fa=
n=20
of some of the Beats, though he always discriminated. A friend once came int=
o=20
Lowell's shop looking for something by Lawrence Ferlinghetti and was abruptl=
y=20
told, "You don't want that stuff," though Lowell didn't say "stuff."=20
But Lowell liked Allen Ginsberg, who came to his aid in 1966, after Clevelan=
d=20
police stormed Asphodel in a raid. They were looking for drugs and found non=
e=20
- Lowell didn't use or sell drugs - but they carted away boxes of books that=
=20
never were returned.=20
A grand jury charged him with selling obscene material (some of the=20
counterculture work was pretty vulgar), but the case was dropped.=20
In the meantime, Ginsberg and a host of friends from Cleveland and beyond=20
organized a fund-raiser for his defense. They collected $11,000 and publishe=
d a=20
typewritten book called "A Tribute to Jim Lowell," featuring essays, poems a=
nd=20
letters.=20
A Plain Dealer article about Lowell published in 1992 recounted writer=20
Jonathan Williams' take on Lowell: "He has all the desirable Midwestern virt=
ues: a=20
good family background (Anglo-Saxon), modesty, sobriety, industriousness, a=20
wife, a Buick, a taste for double- breasted suits, Scotch, Jamaica (not Cuba=
n)=20
cigars and gold. His only Midwestern vice is an inexhaustible affection for=20
literature."=20
Others will say that Jim Lowell did not suffer fools gladly. "That means tha=
t=20
if you weren't on his wavelength, he gave you very short shrift," Taylor=20
explains. "A lot of people thought he was irascible, but I thought he was a=20
delight."=20
At the same time, he was "gentleman Jim" - generally polite, self-effacing,=20
intelligent. His reputation as a fair and honest book dealer was unimpeachab=
le.=20
Today, Lowell's work can be enjoyed even by those who didn't know him, thank=
s=20
to the help he gave Kent State University in building its library=20
collections. Dean Keller, retired special collections curator, says Lowell w=
as a prime=20
source while the university amassed its holdings of modern literature.=20
The school now has a sizable collection by William Carlos Williams. Keller=20
suspects Lowell had amassed it for his own enjoyment.=20
As Taylor says, Lowell "just wouldn't advertise himself. Thank God he made=20
enough of an impression on other people so we can do it for him."=20

If you think Tolkien is a racist *solely* on the basis of your personal
interpretation of his words as an allegory for an essentially racist
mythology, then the only thing we may be sure of is that the racist is
inside of you.  You'd better confront it.  You'll be angry at me the
messenger, but fuck if I care.  How naked and embarrassing your cloying
overcompensatory gestures are.

I recommend that you shed your own racism, prejudices, and nervous hand
wringing race-guilt before you start another lame witch hunt, before you
continue to commit grave injustices, throwing around accusations for
which you have zero evidence.  I however do have evidence supporting my
hypothesis: your posts, your words.  Racism is not trivial, and it
starts with you.  The only way you can shed it is to first confront the
racist inside of you.

Several people also bought my "Irish theory," as if I were being
serious.  Sorry, I was fucking with those of you who lack a sufficient
degree of self-awareness about your own prejudices.  If you took my joke
theory seriously, the only thing it told me was that you take Irish
stereotypes seriously, as if Irish foks really *were* hairy footed short
drunks.  In other words, it was a litmust test of your own prejudice.

First confront the racist inside of you.

Frankly, I couldn't give two poops about Tolkien or his work.  I do,
however, care about people being dumb and unjust.

Anselm, thanks again for these comments.  I just wanted to toss in one note about your
denominations.  Apparently the slave-holders in the south during the time of the civil war
were almost entirely Episcopalians.  It is for this reason that they are now so totally
progressive.  They are trying to make up for what they did, then.  Baptists, for instance,
never held slaves and were strenuously against it so far as I understand this situation
(somebody correct me or corroborate this if possible), and that's why African Americans
were so attracted by that denomination.  Lincoln was raised as a Baptist.  Thanks again
for your note on Finnish church issues.  I suppose there are many different viewpoints on
this matter.  My Finnish pastor held different views than your own, but I suppose there
are as many views on this as there are Finns. He's very very excited about American
Mennonites, and likes me to send them stuff about them.  -- Kirby

It strikes me that those most keen to declare the question of race
irrelevant to the work of JRR Tolkien have throughout this discussion been
curiously lukewarm in its defense! So I thought I would share this hastily
drawn-up list of My Favorite Things About the Work of JRR Tolkien. For I do
not blog, you see.

1. LOTR as addiction narrative, perhaps the greatest ever written. An
attentive young poet might find in it today what Baudelaire found in the
work of Edgar Allan Poe.
2. The occasional brilliance of Tolkien's dialogue. Bilbo's lines in the
opening of FOTR stand out in this respect, as do the lines of Grima
Wormtongue and occasionally Gollum.
3. His eye for civic and social space, esp. as it touches on the character
of Gollum who -- like Cain or Oedipus -- is expelled from the polis and
must wander Middle Earth as a permanently liminal figure (and a minatory
example to Frodo the novice ring-bearer/addict). Note that Gollum won't
even eat cooked food!
4. "The Scouring Of The Shire," which is like a miniature "Ivanhoe" inset
at the end of ROTK. In a burst of gloriously patent wish-fulfillment,
Tolkien takes his final revenge on both the Industrial Revolution and the
Norman Conquest. Senselessly chopped from the film version!
5. Tolkien's tripped-out cosmology. My copy of the Silmarillion is
currently in storage; as I recollect, however, there's no originary "fall"
for which we're being punished, but a sort of amoral entropy, and that it
somehow involves harmony and dissonance. And that Middle Earth's mosaic of
races is intimately bound up with it.
6. Etc., etc., but above all Tolkien's anodyne properties. Whether you're
suffering from a long illness or taking care of someone else who is, you
can count on The Hobbit and LOTR for hours upon hours of needed
distraction. I even know someone who used them to quit smoking (which is
amazing if you remember how much smoking they do in the books). Basically,
any time real life is too revolting for the mind, Tolkien is there for you.
This explains much of his appeal to the socially ungifted.

In my wildest, naughtiest moments, I itch to declare JRR Tolkien a superior
artist to Ezra Pound. But then I'd have a real fight on my hands, and
heaven knows I don't want one of those in 2004! Happy new year to all LRSN

Episcopalians were slave holders because they were no doubt the
landholders.  It's likely that if a Baptist made it into this class, that
they would become an Episcopalian.  Also, being "Episcopal" meant you
respected the English Anglican Church.

Episcopalians now are not much more liberal than Lutherans, Presbyterians,
Unitarians, Society of Friends, etc.  The phenomenon of conservative and
fundamentalist congregations, at least for protestant denominations, is
more about groups that split from these congregations as early as the 30s.
And the Southern Baptist Convention was long ago hijacked by their more
conservative congregations.  Binkley Baptist in Chapel Hill consecrates
gay marriages, while Wake Forest is not under the authority of the
conservative are not the same thing, despite what the media and Pat
Robertson would have you believe.

Hi,

Can anyone fill me in on the poetry scene in Ithaca, NY? Or any kind of scene?
My partner is applying for a position there and neither of us know anything
about it other than a) it's beautiful and b) it's at least 4 hours from

Dear Aaron,

I'm very fond of Ithaca, having lived there 3 years.  Jane Sprague, who =
organizes the brilliant West End poetry series in Ithaca will probably =
respond to you in more detail. She know the scene very well.  I taught at =
Ithaca College when I was there, and had a small fellowship at Cornell, so =
knew about poetry events at both these institutions.  There was more at =
Cornell than I.C., but not a huge amount at either. =20
There are also great and interesting MFA poetry students at Cornell.  =
Jasper Bernes, who now teaches at Hobart and William Smith Colleges, may =
also be a good contact for you.  I did a reading once at SUNY Binghamton =
nearby, but I think Chad Davidson is no longer there.  Still, Syracuse and =
Binghamton are
possibilities for further poetry sourcing! Best of luck to your partner!  =
The challenge may be for *you* to find gainful employment, if you guys =
move to Ithaca.  But it can be done.

Short description of Perspectives on Evil and Human
Wickedness (PEHW) and information on the upcoming
issue:
ISSN: 1471-5597
Volume 4. : Winter 2004  (themed issue:
Reconciliation and Forgiveness)
Submissions (along with a biographical blurb) are due
on January 30, 2004

Perspectives on Evil and Human Wickedness publishes
scholarly work, personal reflections and
practitioners' accounts relating to classifying,
defining, and probing different aspects of evil. It
aims to shed light on the genesis and manifestations
of evil as well as on the diverse angles from which
humans can understand, tackle, surmount, or come to
terms with it. Perspectives on Evil and Human
Wickedness does not espouse any ideological viewpoint
or favor any specific theoretical framework, but
interrogates a plurality of perspectives aimed at
advancing research on this topic.

Perspectives on Evil and Human Wickedness  (PEHW) is
accessible at
http://www.wickedness.net/ej.htm

Issues can be viewed at
http://www.wickedness.net/ejvols.htm

Information on submissions and style sheet is
available at the website.

Issue 4.  Winter 2004:
Submissions are sought for the Winter volume to be
devoted entirely to the theme of Reconciliation and
Forgiveness. The volume hopes to present a panoply of
possible angles from which to engage this topic.  A
wide array of relevant theoretical, critical and
professional perspectives is, therefore, encouraged.
Of most interest will be contributions that add to,
alter and/or deepen, our current understanding of this
theme.

Submissions on how reconciliation and forgiveness are
viewed by law, ethics, philosophy, psychology,
literature and other relevant disciplines and
professions are of special interest.  How do
individuals, groups and societies in our globalized
world attempt to surmount trauma and initiate the
intricate process(es) of forgiveness and
reconciliation? What hampers or aids such processes?
How does art foreground issues related to
reconciliation and forgiveness? Below is a list of
suggested topics:

--The forgivable and the unforgivable
  The misrecognitions
  The incommensurate
  The irreconcilable

--Narrativizing forgiveness

--Trauma, physical and psychological
  Memorializing traumatic past
  How subjecthood is conceived vis-a-vis trauma
  Gendered approaches to trauma
  Levinas, Michel de Certeau, Derrida (and others) on
forgiveness & body trauma
  Approaches to healing

(Shakespeare's Romances,  postcolonial texts, women's
literature, etc.)

--Case Studies (on any aspect of the above)

Contributions are solicited in the form of articles
(under 6000 words), dialogues, creative pieces, book
and media reviews and personal reflections. Feedback
and responses on material published by the journal
are also sought. Submissions in Word, WordPerfect, PD.

LOTR, Kalevala, epic, language, joikking

I don't know a thing about Finland, but I've been following the LOTR and
Finland threads with interest-even if only intermittently.  Now, I don't
remember how this all got started exactly, but I assume that we got
talking about Finland because of the discussion of race in LOTR, and
because of the extent to which Tolkien's story is beholden to northern
mythologies.  But I can't remember if anyone has gotten specific about the
connections here.  Has it been mentioned that Tolkien was an admirer of
the Kalevala, and that he apparently modeled the Elvish language on
Finnish?  I think there's some stuff about this in the Silmarillion, which
I've never read-and in fact, I haven't read LOTR since I was 11 or 12 and
I haven't seen the latest film either.  But today I happened to catch an
episode of the show Sound and Spirit on the radio, the second installment
of a two-parter, on the Kalevala that touched on many things of interest
to the list of late.  For anyone who's interested the Sound and Spirit web
page has links to a lot of material:

http://www.wgbh.org/wgbh/pages/pri/spirit/listen.html

Including a link an extensive Virtual Finland webpage that covers a lot of
historical and cultural ground.  Here's the particular link to the stuff
on the Kalevala:

http://virtual.finland.fi/finfo/english/kaleva.html

The radio show itself featured some music from the Sami people in northern
Finland in a style of singing called joikking,  which I guess can be seen
not only as singing per se but as a practice with shamanistic roots.  And
indeed, it can sound a good bit like certain Native American chants.
This kind of singing is associated with the Sami people of the north, who
have had a reputation as an odd and magical northern race.  I guess they
are the reindeer herding Laplanders of schoolbooks of old, but that term
is now considered derogatory.

The historical materials on the website talk more about "national
consciousness" than about race, but the Kalevala as a kind of
epic-after-the-fact, compiled by Elias Lonnrot in the 19thC from thousands
of folk songs going back thousands of years, is certainly interesting in
this regard.  When it first appeared it was well-respected, but not much
read in Finland, since most educated Finns of that period could not read
Finnish!  Swedish was the language of government and business, and it
wasn't  until the later rise of Finnish nationalism, fueled in part by the
sense of cultural identity engendered by the Kalevala and other art works,
that Finnish was reintroduced into the schools and eventually elevated to
the status of national language (something the Russian overlords of the
day encouraged as part of a break with Swedish influence).

Kirby will no doubt be interested to know that after the Reformation the
Lutheran Church banned all the traditional songs, on which the Kalevala
was eventually based, declaring the whole tradition "pagan."

But for Kirby's sake I am also trying to get this steered toward poetry
and poetics as much as I can, so let's note that what came to called the
Kalevala meter is based on a trochaic tetrameter norm, and that Longfellow
got hold of a mangled version of it for his Hiawatha.  And before I run
out of steam here's a poem from the Kanteletar, a collection of lyrics and
ballads that is the less well-known companion piece to the Kalevala.  This
one was translated into German by Goethe:

Should my treasure come
my darling step by
I'd know him by his coming
recognise him by his step
though he were still a mile off
or two miles away.
As mist I'd go out
as smoke I would reach the yard
as sparks I woud speed
as flame I would fly;
I'd bowl along beside him
pout before his face.
I would touch his hand
though a snake were in his palm
I would kiss his mouth
though doom stared him in the face
I'd climb on his neck
though death were on his neck bones
I'd stretch beside him
though his side were all bloody.
(2:43)

Again, I don't know nuthin' about any of this myself (except that the
lyric above is pretty great), but I thought I'd
pass  along some of what I came across tonight...

it's no secret how much class is responsible for racism and sexism, but
you claim--Kirby--that no one on this list wants to participate in such
a discussion because almost everybody on the list is middle class.
first, there're a lot of us on this list who are not, and have never been
middle class.  but do you even want to discuss this?  i'm not sure,
and so i'm asking.

does this mean you or others who are middle class should feel guilty?
that's for you to decide.  i'm not interested in this personal crisis,
accept how it affects the way in which class might be ignored for a
look at it's symptoms, such as racism and sexism.  and the trailer park
is the softest target, as though anyone in a trailer park has the authority
and the power to hire or fire based on race or gender or whatever else.
it's always been those with the money, especially those with the
controlling amount of money, who will divide us into ever smaller
"special interests" which even rich man Howard Dean will complain about.

(oh yeah, Dean.  if he wins the primary, i'll make my special Howard Dean
dumplings and sell them at the polls.  inside every dumpling is a diamond,
which is only glass, in other words, lawsuit dumplings, in other words, not
what is claimed, and that which will bleed you when bitten with faith.)

but back to who we are and how we want to not talk about it.
am i supposed to be ashamed that my father is the janitor at
my old high school?  (who's asking this?  well i am you goof!)
does it make you uncomfortable?  well, it doesn't make me
uncomfortable.  and maybe you have ideas in your head when
reading that my father's a janitor that he must not have too much
going on upstairs?  but he'd lace your thoughts for you, long before
you realized what conversation he'd led you into.  his mop is his
meditation for the world.

whatever.  this is one of those times where someone will write
me and say, "Are we supposed to compete over which of us is
more white trash now?"  i've been through this before.  guilt darts.

or lectures about how when we're little bitty children on
the playground, class means nothing.  okay, yes.  okay.  but
how about we slip inside something a little bigger than a mere
conversation about how class operates?  something like,
what the hell are we going to do about the injustice?

hating the poor, bashing the poor, is the feel-good secret pleasure in
America.
and never has it been more-so than among the poor.  it continues to be
the case where i grew up, that no one is ever allowed to feel okay with just
paying their bills, taking care of and loving their kids.  the pressure and
the stress to hate yourself for NOT being at least middle class is almost
ferocious among the poor.  you're just a dirty lazy bum if you don't want
to have lots and lots of shiny toys to drive or install in your living room.

dumplings anyone?

Hey Joel,

Not all "sci-fi" readers are lefties.  My evidenc:  Norman
Spinrad, and for that matter the whole Star Trek series.  Question:  why
does the future always wear a uniform, accordingly to Hollywood.

Responding to Craig Allen Conrad's last post:

I, too, think it has a lot more to do with class, in the sense of $$$ =
(i.e., intellectually, I am far and away the most upper middle class =
person at the factory here where I work, as I'm far better educated, =
more deeply informed etc., blah).  However, I'm a peon here, and I make =
a fraction of what long time engineers and managers and others make, =
most of later of which have little formal education at all, much less =
extensive reading in Lit/Humanities etc.  I have essentially NO power =
(except to quit, of course).

When I was an Adjunct Junior College "professor," I had a good deal more =
education than almost all my students, if not all, and a lot of my =
colleagues, but as an adjunct I drove junk cars and could not own a =
house (in California), and again I had very little real "power."  In =
fact, I had none whatsoever if a right-wing Christian department head =
from Texas given tenure after just 3 years wanted to "lay me off" for =
maintaining higher standards or teaching essays debunking creationism, =
pro-life, and pro-death penalty arguments, or for otherwise just being =
different at a conservative cow college in rural California. =20


Last night, the "special interest" RACE piled up on Dean.  If they want =
Bush really badly, the Dem "special interests" RACE, GENDER, SEXUAL =
ORIENTATION, LABOR, and a few others can keep piling up on Dean, but =
nothing is going to stop Colin Powell from selling war for Halliburton =
and Bechtel and the schitt company I work for; stop Neil Bush from =
screwing prostitutes in Asia (underage? sex slaves in sex trade over =
there?); Kobe Bryant from engaging in sex which is more a "game among =
macho male pro athletes whereby females are just orifices"; stop Hillary =
Clinton from aiding and abetting corporations that rip off  middle class =
and working class investors.

I woke up from a dream the other night that was completely and =
thoroughly devoid of "viciousness," as are most of my dreams  It was =
full of tenderness and very "non-commercial" sex and love and "lust."  =
(It revealed the usual, what is completely missing in my own life.)  =
There was a woman and we kissed.  Not, as I say, "commercially sexual," =
but definitely tender, ummm, lust or whatever.

I still "want to" create "vicious" stuff that voices and affects =
propaganda against various politicians in the world.  I believe in the =
idea of "art" transcending its bourgeois purpose, fattening resumes for =
careers, and I believe in art that doesn't aspire to traditional art =
aims at all, rather, works towards political ends.  I believe in regular =
art (or regular bourgeois art aims), too, of course, and I look forward =
to a day when my head is free again enough to more frequently pursue =
same.

the power to hire or fire based on race or gender or whatever else. it's =
always been those with the money, especially those with the controlling =
amount of money, who will divide us into ever smaller "special =
interests" which even rich man Howard Dean will complain about.=20
(oh yeah, Dean. if he wins the primary, i'll make my special Howard Dean =
dumplings and sell them at the polls. inside every dumpling is a =
diamond, which is only glass, in other words, lawsuit dumplings, in =
other words, not what is claimed, and that which will bleed you when =
bitten with faith.)=20
but back to who we are and how we want to not talk about it. am i =
supposed to be ashamed that my father is the janitor at my old high =
school? (who's asking this? well i am you goof!) does it make you =
uncomfortable? well, it doesn't make me uncomfortable. and maybe you =
have ideas in your head when reading that my father's a janitor that he =
must not have too much going on upstairs? but he'd lace your thoughts =
for you, long before you realized what conversation he'd led you into. =
his mop is his meditation for the world.=20
whatever. this is one of those times where someone will write me and =
say, "Are we supposed to compete over which of us is more white trash =
now?" i've been through this before. guilt darts.=20
or lectures about how when we're little bitty children on the =
playground, class means nothing. okay, yes. okay. but how about we slip =
inside something a little bigger than a mere conversation about how =
class operates? something like, what the hell are we going to do about =
the injustice?=20
hating the poor, bashing the poor, is the feel-good secret pleasure in =
America. and never has it been more-so than among the poor. it continues =
to be the case where i grew up, that no one is ever allowed to feel okay =
with just paying their bills, taking care of and loving their kids. the =
pressure and the stress to hate yourself for NOT being at least middle =
class is almost ferocious among the poor. you're just a dirty lazy bum =
if you don't want to have lots and lots of shiny toys to drive or =
install in your living room.=20

thanks for that response.  there's much to say, to reflect....

the thing i wanted to talk about the most though is the idea
of art.  one thing i will never forget (and am grateful for) that
an ex-boyfriend who grew up in Bali told me, is that
in his homeland, there is no word "artist."  it was a real,
serious, beautiful breakthrough for me.

he was sorry he told me, i think, because i became obsessed
with this notion of a vocabulary which lacked the signifying,
or qualifying tag of "artist."  and what i was able to learn from
Andy when pressing him to tell me about "art" in Bali, is that
his culture assumes THAT EVERYONE IS CREATIVE.  and
they need no separation from that, to place a halo over the
annointed, the gifted.  and everyone, and he says everyone,
is always making whatever they do beautiful.

what the elite in the "art world" would call "folk art."
just as "folk art" in America is "craft" etc.
although the Outsider Art exhibitions which have been
on tour are helping to change that.  and people like
Jonathan Williams, who has never liked to make the
distinction which of course is more about class
than art, that distinction between--i don't know,
between Warhol and Darger, for instance.
bad example, but it's not about their art, it's about
their placement in art i'm talking about.

from there i started to investigate how our English has evolved
(or is it devolved?) with our language around "art."  it was
the word Talent that really threw me.  correct me if i'm wrong,
anybody out there, but the original meaning of the word, from
what i've read, means weights and measures, for gold.  from
there it transformed into a word connected to craftsmen, and
the idea was that it was a skill you worked very hard at.  and
now we've come to the American Oxford, (i think it's this one
in particular) where the word is associated with those who
are "gifted."

it's a smelly trail if you ask me, ending at this rather elitist
and separate place.  "gifted."  "special."  i prefer the older
definition on hard work at your skill.

there're so many people who have been cut off for so very long
from their creative centers.  and of course we all have such a
center in us.  every child loves to draw and dream.  and sing
and play with colors and shapes.

and every time i encounter a poet, or a painter who gets their
competitive dander up, and gets bitchy, i think about, well,
first how it seems like there are so many who REALLY
believe that someone else's gain is their loss.  and i try to
imagine what it must have been like before mass publishing.
because it's very very competitive now, and there are
thousands of new books of poetry every year, and thousands
of art galleries and millions and millions of artists.

and i think about the millions of art students.  and all the
people getting degrees in poetry.  and it's SO EXCITING when
you think about it!  it's very much like we're coming home to
ourselves and to one another in a very big, amazing way.
and of course there's NO WAY that the "art market" or the
"poetry market" can bear the weight of all these people.
and it's WONDERFUL because it's the opportunity to take
all that creative energy and transform this country.  and we
are doing it, and it's endless the possibilities for what we
are going to do next and how we're going to shape this
broke-ass world!  it takes creativity to make REAL CHANGE
and it's very clear RIGHT NOW that we have all of that
powder in the cannon to shoot holes in the strange dream
we're asked to plug into.

class is very important in art.  i've met a lot of upper middle
class, and even upper class kids who are art students, or
in MFA programs, and they are very aware of class and
race and gender, and asking one another questions, and
taking it on their own to be responsible for their lives and
to reject the ideas they've been expected to follow.  and
of course we have the 60s to thank.  and all those marvelous
poets of the 50s who broke down a lot of class barriers to
make room for those of us who can't afford higher education.

Although I cannot help you with the poetry scene, I would recommend taking a
trip over to Seneca Lake. I am from Dundee, and have always enjoyed the Glen
at Watkins Glen & the area has many wineries (a little over-priced, but the
wine trail is fun). Furthermore, my Grandma runs a B & B right on Seneca
Lake called Willow Cove. That area is incredible. The farms always have
little stands set up by the road where you take what you need (normally
potatoes, pumpkins, apples, etc.) & leave the money in the small wooden box.

I always imagine the sound of the Glenora waterfall which is right down the
street from the winery. In all of my travels, I still consider it the most
beautiful part of the world (altough I am highly biased).

Craig, I brought it up because I think that class is much more of a determinant
than race and gender in terms of who can create what.  Virginia Woolf says as
much in her long essay A Room of One's Own.  She said the right to vote for
women didn't mean nearly as much to her as getting money so that she didn't have
to work.  She became the most powerful critical voice, the most powerful
publisher, and the most important writer of the London of her day.  This was
because she got enough money to be able to do this. Probably many have the
talent.  Very few have the cash.

Most of my life I've made less than ten grand a year.  Finally at age 47 I have
a paying gig (it doesn't pay much, and I am raising three children, but it still
functions, and finally I am able to write, even if I do so only very slowly).

When you look at Haitian literature, for instance, it was all or almost all
written by the upper class.  Proust had the ability to rent rooms underneath him
and above him in order to guarantee silence, and this was in the best hotels in
France.  Result?  Or if you think about another monumental writer in France --
the Marquis de Sade.

Having access to money is crucially important, and I was asking this in a
sarcastic way (but hopefully I was not being too vicious).  My Finnish father in
law works as a janitor in a small town in Finland.  He's one of the smartest men
around, but he has no time for anything, and arrives at home every night
completely exhausted.  He can still beat me at crossword puzzles in English,
which is sort of hard to believe.  he had aspirations to be a writer as a young
man.  He was raised in a tiny farmhouse in the middle of nowhere, and never got
an education, but he educated himself.  His English was learned out of a library
carousel, and it is quite excellent, if eccentric.

There are very very few poor writers who have been able to make it in the
literary world.  Those who do, like Gregory Corso, had to be extremely gutsy
about getting money.  If you read Corso's recently published letters -- almost
every letter is a request for money, or has such a request in it.  He married
women only for the money, etc., but he was too unstable, and never lasted in the
marriages.

Yes, I think that class is critical.  This is why I said in one of my posts
yesterday that there is hardly any Lutheran literature in this country.
Everybody was working 18 hour days on dirt farms until late in the 20th
century.  We now have John Updike.  When I talk to my parents about their lives
-- they were lucky to get a single piece of fruit once a year -- on Christmas,
when they were children.

So I am often a little crazy when I hear the daughter of a corporate CEO from
Hong Kong talk about her lack of privilege as she drives up in a red convertible
to graduate school.

Race and gender do have an impact, and they are in some ways intertwined with
class, but it is class that determines how much freedom somebody has to write.
Virginia Woolf's and Proust's cases are evidence of this, I think.  But very few
people want to talk about class I think because money is not an issue for them,
so they tend to try to create diversionary tactics in order to hold themselves
up as victims.  But the extreme poor are the real victims in this society across
the board.

So let's check out the lives of writers -- the poor ones die young, and are very
unhealthy, and it doesn't matter how gifted they are.  The rich ones generally
die late, and in comfortable circumstances with the best doctors in attendance.
Of course, there are also rich writers like Virginia Woolf who have it all, and
then go and commit suicide.  And there are people like Bukowski who cheerfully
survive every kind of poverty and write fifty books and die with a grin.

Thanks.  You know -- one of the interesting things when you go into an art
gallery is to look at the prices.  It would be equally interesting to look
through the tax records of writers.  Of course, I don't want to kill the rich or
anything.  I don't think Marxism really works.  People just have to generate
money if they want to get the time to write.  After I cite you, I will continue
on for a bit, as I am warming up to this topic.

-- I was trying -- in my usual backhanded manner -- to create such a discussion,
yes, and so yes I am willing to discuss it.  I am fascinated by the money that
writers have both in terms of contemporary writers and also in terms of
historically how much did each surrealist have, and what were the results?  I am
also fascinated by the permeability of class -- for instance an important
basketball player who rises from the ghetto to become super-rich (some have done
this!), or whoever it was who started Pizza Hut, or a Korean grocer who starts
with nothing and puts up a tiny vegetable stand in the Bronx and starts to rise
economically (I read a good novel on this called The Fruit N Food by Leonard
Chang).  How do the aspirations rise with the income?  For instance, Robert
Corbett said that a Baptist who could rise to become a plantation owner would
probably switch into the Episcopalian church.  In New Orleans some free blacks
rose to incredible heights of wealth and would have their own pews in the front
of Episcopal church and became slave-owners themselves.

Class is a mysterious thing because you retain some of the viewpoint of another
class as you rise (or fall -- many millionaires end up as paupers).  I don't
think the super-rich should be ashamed of their holdings, or offed.  I think
it's laudable when a family creates a financial base that can allow for a child
to attend a good college and perhaps go on to have some freedom.  Marcel Duchamp
never had to work.  His dad saved for him.  Breton's dad was a postal worker who
nevertheless guaranteed that Andre Breton never had to work.  He scrimped so
that his son would have money.  This turns out to be the case for a great great
number of writers.  And isn't it laudable?  Thank heavens for such thoughtful
parents!  And the poor in this country are often one parent families.  Families
that stay together generally rise into the middle classes.  This is what all the
research is saying.

Class does seem to effect who can write, and especially in the realm of poetry,
in which there is almost NO CHANCE of remuneration for the vast labors involved,
it seems to me that only the super-rich last very long, or the incredibly
cagey.  Now we have some who get teaching positions, and that helps.  This is
part of the reason that I was so fascinated by Corso.  Can you think of another
orphan poet who came from the very lowest underclass, had a sixth grade
education, and yet became one of the most important poets of his time?  This is
so rare that I don't know of another case.

John Clare comes to mind.  As does Thomas Chatterton.  There is a little
one working-class women poet of the 18th century who found a sponsor.  In
the end, Kirby is quite right that a little money and a little time go a
long toward helping a writer get to publication.  I would demur, however,
in saying that class determines whether one can "create."  There are many
Miltons amongst us, though the world considers them "mute" and
"inglorious."

Question to Kirby:  Was your father-in-law a big reader?  My own
grandfather read the Encyclopedia and most every other book in the North
Augusta libary, harbored dreams of being a writer, but had to forgo
college in order to support his mother during the depression.  He didn't
survive being a medic in WWII, but no doubt he would have kept on reading,
whether he wrote or not.

I'd be careful about comparing class /gender situations in different
cultures, as class is a more culturally-determined construct than gender

esp. in Italy before the rise of futurism,

when considering folks like Magritte together with the surrealists,

and when you create a straw corporate heiress.

admittedly, I am interested in lives and art of upper middle class
women, especially as proponents of a "middle class" label the education
and devotion to art, literature, and politics of these women
transgressive

while pushing a more conservative woman's role, such as one with a
little money and a room, that shapes creative writing into, in effect, a
congenial part time (35 hrs a week or less) day job such as those upper
middle class women traditionally hold in antique stores, museums,
auction houses, art galleries, and small needlepoint shops or some such

these roles are both like the "angel of the house" Woolf identified and
Woolf's "room"

For an hour the past didn't seem to end.


How exhilarating it was
to be in the world
at a time
when streets and girls
caught the afternoon.

Existentialists were made
to carry the struggle,
hungry for the beach
and the moment

Forgetting backwards
because of flowers
or overarching,
crushed sympathy

To make a place
downstairs
over the night sky --

"Solid" meant "distant" --
something to count the horse
or in virtuous language,
to impart a sign.

I was thankful for both.

Robert:

The anomaly I find interesting in sci-fi is that hundreds of years into the
future they are still using the same language, with a few technical
words--warp drive, etc.--thrown in. As if languages themselves won't change!
Of course we wouldn't understand a language of the future. So I suggest
having the TV and films in subtitles, with the characters not speaking
anything we can hear, because we wouldn't know what they are saying. Books
are another problem. Any ideas?

I suggest the idea reverse etymology is worth some serious thought.

There's some new stuff on my blogger tonight. For about the past year,
I've been composing poetry directly onto the blog without really
planning or editing. Somehow it makes me feel free. A little less
pressure to be legitimate. A little more human.

I'd appreciate your feedback if you have any.

Peace,

when i hear what mister bush has done i am beside myself
i cannot contain myself
i can only hope these evils have everything bad happen to them
i can only hope these evils have very bad tortures happen to them

we will laugh with our children and our husbands and our wives

REMINDER

POG and CHAX PRESS present:
a poetry reading and book launch

Elizabeth Treadwell

Tuesday January 13 2004
7pm at Biblio bookstore
222 E. Congress Street Tucson, Arizona
Admission: $5/$3 students
for information call Chax Press at 620-1626

Elizabeth Treadwell lives with her family in Oakland, California. Her other
books include Populace (Avec, 1999) and LILYFOIL + 3 (O Books, 2004). She
directs Small Press Traffic in San
Francisco.

Chax Press announces a new book:
CHANTRY, by Elizabeth Treadwell
published in 2004, and available for the first time at this event.

Chantry is song. Chantry is song that exceeds song structure in all
dimensions to become invocation and enchantment. From “the vessel without a
cover” to “late silhouette in / blue” it refuses to be contained, as a book
wants to live outside its covers.

                                                        or
                                                the devotions

                                                                        for my sisters, Margaret & Carol

in a well-sought dream remember think of something plain like Grammy’s
tears; think of something plain like the color and curvature of gingerale
nightgown & bend & kink of patio, how the 3rd vowel of her name was
scratched in.

Novels written in English that are set in foreign countries often
have all of their dialogue in the English spoken by the author. This
is what makes them English language novels.

With the exception of books about biblical stories in which the
dialog is often in the English of the King James version of the
bible, most historical novels in English are usually written in the
language contemporary to the author's time rather than the time of
the story. The same is usually true for movies produced in English as
well.

Why should science fiction be any different? This may not be
"realistic," but most "realism" isn't, anyway.

I think of words like rubber-banded lobsters in a supermarket
aquarium, slowly nudging over one another, bubbles rising from their
stony heads - or like breeding sea monkeys, froth and pink and many.
Then there are the images of coral reefs - explorers and mini-
submarines boiling to the surface with caches of artifacts and living
sponges. Sometimes I climb into my unruly bed - and the manta rays
cover my face and take all of my vowels away.

Actor Spalding Gray Is Missing
By SABRINA TAVERNISE

Published: January 13, 2004


Spalding Gray, the monologist, actor and raconteur of "Swimming to Cambodia"
fame, was reported missing by his wife Sunday night, police officials said
yesterday.

The disappearance of Mr. Gray was of particular concern to the authorities.
Mr. Gray, 62, had a history of depression, was taking medication, the police
said,  and had attempted suicide in 2002.

His wife, Kathleen Russo, declined to talk when reached at their New York
City apartment last night. She said simply that she had been waiting for
information  about Mr. Gray.

Mr. Gray's older brother, Rockwell Gray, an English professor at Washington
University in St. Louis, said he had learned of the disappearance yesterday
morning from Ms. Russo. He said that he had last seen his brother around
Christmas, and that he had seemed down at the time.

"I wouldn't say he was in a happy state," Rockwell Gray said by telephone
from Missouri. But, "it wasn't unusual. He's been in a fairly depressed
condition for some time."

As for previous disappearances, Mr. Gray's brother said that they were "to
the best of my knowledge, not something quite like this."

Detectives were canvassing hospitals last night, providing Mr. Gray's
description and checking unidentified people. Mr. Gray lives in North Haven,
Long Island, but also has an apartment at 22 Wooster Street in New York
City.

One block south of the apartment building is the Wooster Group, the
experimental theater Mr. Gray helped found in 1977 with Elizabeth LaCompte.

Scott Shepherd, 35, an actor at the theater, said he had last seen Mr. Gray
in December during one of the group's performances.

"He's been in bad shape for a while since that car accident," Mr. Shepherd
said, referring to an accident in Ireland in 2001.

In North Haven, a young boy in pajamas was seen lighting candles in three
windows of Mr. Gray's two-story, paneled wood house last night.

Sci-fi films and TV shows are usually not narrated. Foreign films are
usually subtitled or dubbed. Shakespeare is in Elizabethan English. Books
can be read in their original language. "Why should science fiction be any
different?" is a joke, right?

Yes, sci-fi obeys the formal convention that all historical and
set-in-places-where-they-don't-speak-English novels in that the
significant dialogue is in English.  What is surprising or defamiliarizing
is when it is not (thus, "Prague" a mildly amusing recent Americans abroad
novel, has characters mangle Hungarian as well as speak in English, as
though in tribute to novelistic monoglotism).

There have been ambitious attempts to forgo this convention.  I think of
"Clockwork Orange" and "Riddley Walker," but also the entirety of Ursula
K. LeGuin's work (but especially "Always Coming Home") and Frank Herbert
in the Dune series. Even the evolution of "Klingon" is some recognition
of the absurdity of "English spoken here."  Douglas Adams, as always, had
the ideal solution with the Babel Fish, the animal that ate words and
excreted translations.

Joel,

>"Why should science fiction be any different?" is a joke, right?

is a joke, right?

In Shakespeare's plays the characters do indeed speak Elizabethan
English, regardless of whether they live in Elizabethan England,
Venice, Verona, ancient Greece, Rome or Egypt or anywhere else
Shakespeare set his plays. If somehow, Shakespeare had written a play
about American Beatniks it's very difficult to believe that he would
have gotten the slang right or that he would have chosen to present
the play with speaking "because [he] wouldn't know what they were
saying." He would use the language that he and his audience
understood.

In, for example, a Polish film or book like Saragossa Manuscript,
which takes place in Spain, the characters all speak Polish, the
language of the author and film makers and the original audience for
the book and the movie.

For the most part, that's what writers, playwrights and film makers
do and always have done.

It is possible to do something other than this. Robert Corbett,
mIEKAL aND, & Shannan Compton note some exceptions to this convention
and there are others (one could include works like Finnegans Wake in
this category), but as an accountant might say, it's "generally
accepted practice" to write in a language you know and that your
expected audience knows.

Would the kind of science fiction film without audible dialog that
you suggested earlier necessarily be a better solution to our not
knowing what characters in the future would be saying?

I ask again, why should science fiction be any different?

Bests,

Herb

Dear Catherine,

my feeling is that, yes, class is constructed in different
ways in different cultures, but so are all forms of relationships
between people in different cultures.  having worked for many
years in retail in super-rich neighborhoods in Philadelphia,
i've heard constant wide-eyed amazements, "Ooh, but in
Barcelona the women..."  "In Italy, they have more..."
and what i heard most in the comparing/contrasting was
how much better it was being done elsewhere, usually
in Europe.  maybe they're right, i don't know. (and of course
the thing that always made me want to scream is when
they'd talk about the "common people" and how kind they
were and what good cooks they were, in other words, why
do we have such pigs over here in our ghettos?  but that's
another discussion, for another time)

but while i understand class may be constructed in
different ways in different cultures, there are still some
pretty basic things going on, no matter where you are.
such as, the poor do all the fucking work, and those
with money and/or property get the poor to do it as
close to free as they can manage.

India for instance has it built right into the religion.
the caste system is a rich man's paradise.  that's
their system.  in America religion of course also
has its way of making the poor feel like Jesus is
on their side.  i have relatives in Iowa who are so
poor that hunting season isn't a sport, it's a way
to save on the grocery bill, but they STILL vote for
Bush anyway, because he says Jesus all the
fucking time whenever he can fit the name in.
and this, regardless of how many tax cuts he'll
make for the rich.  let's face it, Jesus didn't say
that we should unionize and redistribute wealth,
he said the poor are there, and will always be
there, and the meek shall inherit.  shall inherit
when they die, of course.  faith is an upper class
boon if you ask me.

but one of the things i always find important when
i go to documentary footage, of, let's say the Chavez
film for instance, and what's going on in Venezuela,
is that it's always the workers, or the poor people
who are talking who seem to have the same kinds
of needs to be met, and the same kinds of complaints
about how and why those needs are not being met.
when i say same, i mean, it's the same all over the
world, these needs:  water, food, jobs, health care.

in the film THE BIG ONE (one of the only post-NAFTA
documentaries that i know of), the factory workers
in the parking lots of their now closed factories are
saying many of the same things, talking about basic
needs and how they are going to vanish unless they
find some way of scrambling for more work.  there's
even interviews with Borders Bookstore employees
with college degrees who are talking about the very
same things.

and our corporate owned media does a pretty spiffy
job at pretending that slavery is a
thing of the past.  in nearly every country in the world
you can find slaves.  in America we are actually,
according to National Geographic of all sources,
leading the "western world" in slavery.  we have
the largest numbers of sweatshops in our own
country, and we have an enormous number of
women in the sex industry against their will (the
largest number of which are Russian these days).
the cruelty of our time brought on by economics,
in one way or another, probably can get worse.

but while the corporations are teaming up to
build their global alliances, so are the workers,
all over the world, right now.

one such group that is bringing the world's women
together in this struggle is The Global Women's Strike.
i'm helping organize an event/benefit for their activities
on International Women's Day (March 8) with my
friend Mary Kalyna at the Bowery Poetry Club on
Feb. 22nd from 3 to 6pm.  for more information on
The Global Women's Strike:  http://www.globalwomenstrike.net

When US and English films venture outside their language sphere (not a
winner at the box-office, I might add), I don't think the English pressed
on the Actors is actually English. Some actually try to mimic the target
language in that funny-sounding voice and syntax in some cases. Take "The
Odessa File", for example. Jon Voight has that little mittel-european,
somewhere east of the Rhine accent which really gets on my nerves. I don't
think he really needed it. OTOH, Sean Connery always plays a scotsman, even
when manning a russkie sub. In other words, it matters to some but I can't
understand the motivation.

In the polish film you mention, do the spanish characters speak with some
sort of polish idea of a spanish accent/syntax?

How relevant is "workers of the world unite"?  And how different that is
from "women of the world unite"!  Are there some pretty basic things
going on?  I'm not convinced; I'm also not convinced "workers" are the
only ones working.  Not just workers need food and health care.
Clothing seems more of an option in some of the more temperate climates
where most of the clothing that American workers purchase is sewn by
indentured servants and essentially slave laborers, but hey.

I am privileged by my economic status to not have to purchase cheap
tshirts at Wal Mart. This is reinforced by my social class -- I don't
have occasion to shop at wal mart and I don't have occasion to purchase
and wear many tshirts.

It isn't as though no Brahmins work.  Lots of Brahmins run restaurants,
which, in my experience, offer a wide range of pretty cruddy jobs.  In
India, where I lived for not very long, and in Indian companies (worked
for one of those for a brief period too), there were plenty of poor
Brahmins, they were just the top of the caste system.  While Brahmins
don't generally clean out latrines, frankly, I don't either.

Class considerations around social ceremonies -- and elections are
those, certainly, just as state-sanctioned marriages are, for example --
effect people differently in different places and times.  To carry
understandings of the operations of class derived from present-day US
Protestantism back to the society in which the Catholic church is
centered (say, the area around Rome) in the early 20th Century, or even
back to Protestant Switzerland and Germany in the same time period,
seems like entering a hall of mirrors to me.

I read _A Room of One's Own_ again last night after the previous posts
(tho I teach it and had to reread anyway).  I was particularly
distressed by the passages wishing some old battle axe had worked to
achieve a great fortune  which could endow scholarships and fellowships
for Woolf.

All best,
Catherine Daly

It is interesting to read these notes as i discovered on the news one night,
in a survey of various claasses in the USA and also survey of the various
classes in relation to the current economy--it was said that left out of the
survey where the people of the underclass, a sort of dark area left to
themselves and not a part of "society".

A "non-" or "no"-class--

The "worthless" so to speak--

In the past few years this is the shadow world have lived in.  The world of
people on SSI, SSD, on the streets, or in free housing, transitional living,
various shleters--the free meals, the pantries, the chruch, the free
clothing places, the aid societies, public detox, shelters, various medical
aid forms and bureaucracies.  One doesn't have a real identity in one way
and on the other hand an identity constructed of the various programs and
places one has been in--the prison system, the welfare system, the treatment
system, the couselling/psychiatric system, the system for recovery users,
the sytem for battered women, the one for anger management, the parenting
sytems, the courts, an endless series of sytems that in each has a set of
documents that make you that which in there dwells, in other's words . . .
The Federal. State and County systems--case workers, payees, Homestead Act--
The papers one signs--the phamplets, the posters--
Medical checkups--
Tests--
Ward of the County for those who would die otherwise--

Have made a study of the art found in all these buildings . . .
Also the signs:

Healthcare & Shelter for the Homeless:  (free room and board, mice ridden
rooms, sharing a building with the elderly, the insane, crack haeds, drunks
on the sly--)
WHAT IS NOT IN WRITING NEVER HAPPENED
working with literacy programs, helping people with endless documents . . .
at the probation parole office--with the bullet proof glass to sign in
through--the metal detetctors to walk through
and on the wall for the sullen waiting figures:

AS A COURTESY TO TO  OTHERS
PLEASE REMOVE ALL HEAD GEAR

Central City streets . . .where the buildings are for the recovering dope
fiends and drunks, for the elderly, the insane--walking out the door into
insanity--the walking dead, the dope man, the sidewalk preacher, the hos on
the move--

Small wonder no on walks along to take a survey--
a world left to itself--

only hooked into society via bureaucracy--

and continual cutbacks--

in this world one can work--painting, visual poetry, mail art, poetry,
essays--

using cheapest materials and working in alleys, streets or tiny room--

no care for isms or definitions--

all one has to do is produce ID cards, medical and food cards, letter from
the so-and so in charge . . proof of address--
living in a different country within the country--

just take the bus and you will see--

anythying can be used to make a poem (Wcw)--

"Refuse/Refuse"--ref-use/RE-fuse--

Dear friend of Bush in 30 Seconds,
The winning ads in our Bush in 30 Seconds ad contest will be announced
tonight, live from the awards show at the Hammerstein Ballroom in New York
City. The awards show is going to be hosted by Jeanine Garofalo and will
feature performances and presentations by Margaret Cho, Chuck D, Al Franken,
Moby, Michael Moore, John Sayles, Julia Stiles, and Rufus Wainwright. It
should be a really fun night -- music, comedy, and lots of incredible
30-second ads.

If you'd like to tune in, the event will be webcast live, beginning at 8p
EST/5p PST. We'll be announcing the winners around 10:45pm EST. To tune in
to the webcast and view the winning ads after they're announced, just go to:
http://www.bushin30seconds.org/

Already, the Bush in 30 Seconds contest has brought tens of thousands of new
people into MoveOn, generated millions of dollars' worth of free publicity,
and put us in touch with some tremendously talented people. Please join us
for the grand finale tonight on the Bush in 30 Seconds website.

Sincerely,
--Adam, Carrie, Eli, James, Joan, Noah, Peter, Wes, and Zack
  The MoveOn.org Team
  January 12th, 2003

P.S. In case you'd like to tune in, ABC's Good Morning America will also be
doing a live interview with the winner and me, Eli Pariser, tomorrow morning
between 7am and 9am.

P.P.S. Here are excerpts from two great articles on the contest -- one from
the L.A. Times and one from the Associated Press -- that were published in
the last few days:

TV AD CONTEST TARGETS PRESIDENT
By John M. Glionna, Times Staff Writer
http://www.moveon.org/r?478

"Fourteen in all, the TV spots aim to depict the anger and frustration many
Democrats harbor toward the Bush administration. But they're not the work of
any slick political ad firms - they're finalists in a nationwide contest
sponsored by MoveOn.org, a popular Internet-based political action group. .
.

The MoveOn.org contest spotlights the aggressive and uncharted role special
interest groups not linked to either party are expected to play in the 2004
presidential campaign. Some say it also shows how such Internet-based groups
could contribute to the spread of unfiltered messages in American politics."

(It's MoveOn.org Voter Fund, not MoveOn.org, by the way, which sponsored the
contest -- we've asked the Times for a correction.)

MOVEON.ORG BECOMES ANTI-BUSH ONLINE POWERHOUSE
by Beth Fouhy, Associated Press
http://www.moveon.org/r?479

"Chances are, Democratic Party consultants won't take credit for the
hardest-hitting anti-Bush ad to air on network TV this month. That honor
will likely go MoveOn.org, an online group that has become too potent for
establishment politicians to ignore.

Years before Howard Dean's use of the Internet dazzled analysts and
propelled him to the front of the 2004 Democratic presidential field, MoveOn
paved the way, evolving in six short years from something of a cybergeek
forum to arguably the largest and most forceful voice in digital-era
politics.

MoveOn's latest campaign, which invited people to create their own anti-Bush
ads, generated more than 1,500 entries. Hundreds of thousands of wired
MoveOn members voted on the most effective, and the 15 most popular will be
judged Monday night at a gala event in New York City by celebrities
including Michael Moore, Janeane Garofalo and the rap group Public Enemy,
and the winner will air the same week President Bush gives his State of the
Union address."

Catherine Daly, some of your references were lost to me.  I wasn't even sure
if you were responding to me or to someone else.

I suppose my suspicion of the left categories (both description and
prescription) began in 1974 when I started taking LSD with a bunch of
friends after one night Allen Ginsberg appeared on a talk show with a witty
guy -- not David Frost -- he has a pointy face -- and said that if you took
LSD you could talk to God.  We pooled our money and took a bunch of it.
After a month or so three of my five friends had gone nuts, and one wanted
to go into the CIA.  I myself felt loony for about two years.  During that
time more and more of my friends died of heroin overdoses and so on.  So
that was my first sense that the left could have a bad prescription for a
problem that they perceived.  I think Ginsberg thought people were too
rational in America.  So they needed to go crazy.  there was this idea that
if you took drugs you would become permanently cool.

At any rate, Ginsberg killed the best minds in my high school.  Those guys
never recovered.

I did, but I am still a little out there.

As for feminism, and Simone de Beauvoir.  You've read it I'm sure.  Her
chapter on Breton?  She attacks Breton for giving Nadja the role of Love,
and no other profession.  It's worse than this. Breton loved her because she
was nuts.  At the end of the book he goes on and on about how the medical
establishment is responsible.  In fact, she's nuts, and she has no
resources.  Her family barely knows where she is, and she's left her child
alone in a hotel room while she goes out hooking.  (It's a somewhat occluded
fact in the story that she is a hooker, and that Breton is paying her for
her time, and that he is also sleeping with her.)

All my friends in high school who died came from flakey families.  My mom
and dad bailed me out, and set me straight, as they did for the one other
guy in my gang who survived our drug escapades.  The women in our gang also
went nuts.  Some turned into prostitutes, some od'd, and some are now still
alive, but alcoholic, and unable to function for the most part.  The only
ones who survived had strong families.

I think this is what women need, and certainly what children need -- a
family that they can count on.  What else is there?  The ultra-poor often
don't have this safety net.  I'm not sure about the homeless.  Nadja is more
or less in that category.  She ended up in an asylum until she died in
1946.  Her records remain sealed, so there is no way to know her side of the
story as of yet.

What worries me about feminism is that it has driven a wedge between men and
women such that it is much easier to divorce.  Has this been good for
women?  Maybe not.  Many of the poorest women are single-mothers.  It's a
terrible situation.  I'm interested in somehow figuring out how to create
durable families.

I think the left keeps offering up bizarre ideas -- now it's Deleuze saying
that everybody should go crazy, or Foucault saying that people in mental
institutions should all be let out.  I am not sure if Thorazine has allowed
people to become stable, but Nadja -- ultra-poor, and without any family at
all, and out hooking to make ends meet, and also involved in the drug
trade.  It wasn't her gender so much that wiped her out, it was her poverty
and lack of stable social connections.  She may have also had some kind of
chemical imbalance.  But if you think of John Clare, mentioned yesterday --
he was pretty stable in the beginning but overwork destroyed his mind,
apparently.  The ultra-poor, epsecially if they are talented, go nuts.  So I
don't think that gender or race are impediments to writing.  We have great
and important women writers -- Jane Austen -- the best novelist of the 19th
century, Marianne Moore -- the most interesting of the modernist poets, and
we have many upper-class writers of color -- for example the marvelous
Marcellin brothers of Haiti who wrote such wonderful novels.  But it's very
rare for a person of the extreme lower classes to write.  Class is a real
impediment, and almost insuperable.

Race, gender, class.  These are some variables, of which I htink the last is
the most important and the least discussed.  Another variable is -- Do you
have a mother and father that you can count on?  People with alcoholic
partners, or alcoholic parents.  These people are in for a very hard life.

I often feel that race and gender are red herrings.  It's family, and
sobriety, and a sense that life has meaning that needs to be rebuilt.  If we
choose the wrong issues to focus on, or get the wrong prescription (as
Ginsberg did with LSD), a lot of people die.  The sexual revolution has
killed hundreds of thousands.  I think that the sixties gave us all kinds of
answers.  None of those answers have paid out for my generation.  The only
thing I still accept from the sixties is lava lamps.  They are a marvelous
waste of a few minutes, or a nice thing to have if you are an insomniac,
like me.  But what we need to do to somehow cure the state of the ultra-poor
is to try and make it possible for families to stay together.  Maybe I'm
wrong, but that's been my understanding, and most of our radical politics
have driven a wedge into families.  The sexual revolution, the use of drugs
as a means of life enhancement, the rise of divorce as a way to settle a
dispute, the sense that men and women are somehow natural enemies instead of
natural friends, etc.

Kirby - I don't know, but I suspect I am not alone on this list with the
concern that you ought - if you did not already do so years ago (it's hard
to tell from your posts) that you stop reading poetry immediately. I cannot
tell you what a vice and danger poetry could still represent to the
protection of your moral character. Many have us have already fallen to its
addiction. Lovers, wives and husbands are strewn in the wake of our love of
verse, let alone otherwise once promising and handsome careers in politics,
law, medicine, etc., etc., and, needless to say, upstanding participation in
the Scouts, Sunday School Services, and hours on our children's soccer
fields, etc., etc. I even suspect participation in this list - even with its
minimum attention to actual poems - could possibly drive you crazy and
render your familial and community associations more unstable than you once
experienced in what appears - except for the grace of parental intervention
- to have been a childhood surrounded by tragedy and sadness.
Believe it or not, heroin and LSD are cheap substitutes for proximity to the
Muse. No offense, but, Toby, I humbly suggest, for your own safety, get a
way from poetry as far and as quickly as you can.

[Kirby says,

At any rate, Ginsberg killed the best minds in my high school.  Those guys
never recovered.]


I heard that Ginsberg was the sole reason why the Colombinme kids went into
a rage. These were nice boys bowling before school, then after listening to
Ginsberg's "Ballad of the Skeleton's" on NPR went on a shooting rampage
killing 17.

Why doesn't some one stop these poets???

Herb:

It usually risks itself scenically more than fictionally. Star Trek gets
around this with its "universal translator," so that everyone can
speak...20th Century English. But back to the future of my original point:
we have no way of knowing what language will be in the future. To consider
the future of languages--we're so used to studying the past--doesn't have to
do with what they will be--thus the silence. But that they will be very
different from anything we can imagine opens imaginative space.

The Brahmin example can just as easily be discussed as a race issue, because
it too is culturally determined- & gender as well. This list has recently
been an exchange of both these attempts at determination.

I would say that "workers of the world unite" may not be relevant in a Cold
War Soviet sense, but as global capitalism has moved to every nook on the
planet- so too has resistance to its injustices & exploits. In this sense,
Cleveland teamsters & farmers in India have never been more closely linked.

Of course, the rich work. But they're being paid (at least) fairly. Others
are not. That's the sticking point.

Hi David,

Tom's in the process of moving house in Cambridge at present, so he's
been necessarily out of touch, and will be until he gets his new
place set up. I gather he's got an army of willing hands (something
wrong there!) at his disposal, though, so everything's under control.

Best,

Trevor

Hi David,

what you write is true . . . up to a point. The point being that Tom is in
transit, between housing. Enough said. The situation should be improved, if
anything, by new arrangements.

I'm sure that some sort of panic reaction and the more anxious machinations
of the rumour mill would be the last wish on Tom's mind. Right now the
family has good friends and a supportive network.

love and love
cris

Dear Catherine,

i'm glad you're responding, and honest about who
you are, where you're from, what you stand for.

you say that it's so different saying Workers Unite
and Women Unite.  possibly it's because of your
class that you haven't bothered to inform yourself
about just how privileged you are.  the fact is that
women own less than 1% of the owned property
in the world.  but of course, as we learned in 1st or
2nd grade, there are more women than men.

it's also true that--all over the world--women do,
without a doubt, more work than men.  and not
only that, but much of that work that women do is
not work which is paid work.  even when they are
doing work that they get paid for, they almost
always have to go back home and do more work.
this is NOT to say that men do nothing unless
they get paid for it, but it is true that women do
far more work than men do which is work which
is not paid work.  so yes, it is VERY appropriate
to connect workers and women, since it's women
who do most of the work.  and this, by the way,
is true in almost every culture you can name.

is it true that many of the women who are involved
with such groups as The Global Women's Strike are
middle class are upper middle class?  it's possible,
but it's also true that many of the women who have
fought against slavery, or fought for the right to vote
tended to be of a more comfortable class.  they were
women --like Eleanor Roosevelt for instance-- who
understood injustice, and were willing to work against
that injustice however they could.

Gloria Steinem was interviewed once where she
talked about having to attend a school reunion at
Smith, where she had graduated on scholarship,
and then a month later attend a reunion at her old
high school in working class Toledo  she talked
about the Smith reunion first, how the women
seemed a little scattered, lost, and seemed more
identified through their husbands than their
own accomplishments.  when she spoke of
the Toledo reunion she said how clear it was to
her that these were women who were very much
aware of the uneven exchange of the sexes, of
having to work in the factory, come home and
cook and wash the kids and wash the dishes
and wash the clothes.  she said it was an important
revelation for her, to SEE the working class world
she thought she had escaped with her scholarship,
really SEEING it and all that she had failed to see
when she was younger.  and of course it was her
working class roots as a woman that made her
strive and set out to make Smith work for her as
much as she could possibly make it work for her.
she didn't have the privilege of wealthy parents,
and it made her opportunity to go to such a well-
respected school seem much more important than
it did to many of her peers.

the other thing is, you mentioned that it's not just
workers who need health care.  okay, fine, but it's
pretty clear that what i mean is that the working class
--more and more--are out here making sacrifices
to make health care possible.  obviously, those who
can afford health care generally have health care.

workers are not the only ones working?  well, if
you're working, then you are a worker?  right?
huh?  what is this?  look, doctors are unionizing,
because they are being taken advantage of
by hospitals, by insurance companies, etc.

when the Bush team last year made it possible
for employers to not have to pay overtime pay for
overtime work, no one said much at first, because
it was affecting blue collar workers.  but a month
later (or was it two months later?) when a similar
pitch was made for white collar workers, all of a
sudden the newspapers acted like it was simply
the worst news they'd ever had to report!

my mother and i were talking about this, and she
feels it's due mainly that working class people are
so overworked these days that they may not even
be aware of these changes in the labor laws.

Catherine, i appreciate your openness, but at the
same time, would hope you think about the needs
of the larger (very large) portion of the humans on
this planet who are not getting their needs met.
there's nothing about suffering that should be
taken lightly.  people sweating their asses off
to make shoes and sweaters needs to be thought
of by all of us, considering that we're 6% (some
argue only 5%) of the world's population, here
in America, consuming 60% of the resources.
it can't last, this consumption.  and maybe the
only real hope is for wealthier people to have to
fall and fall hard.  as my grandmother used to
say, "you didn't see poor people jumping out
of windows during the Depression, and you
know why?  because we had each other.  the
rich only have one another as long as they
continue to be rich.  once their money's gone
jumping out a window is as good as they'll get."
my grandmother was a wise and amazing,
but very tired worker who didn't seem too
unhappy about dying when she died.

Some more random thoughts about Class and Writing/Reading:

Class precludes many able-minded good souls and spirits from engaging in =

the quasi-privileged act of writing and producing poetry and art as =
freely
as they might like, but what's also interesting is the effect class has =
on=20
potential readers.  Almost the reverse: In terms of "material =
well-being,"
those unencumbered by class-determined limitations ("time to write,=20
time to read/study writing," "access to advanced studies and better
schools," "social mixing, schmoozing, with publishers, promoters,"
"grooming and prestige of name-universities and organizations," etc)
are LEAST LIKELY to read, appreciate, value, seek, and "consume"
poetry and art.  Again, this is "class" in terms of "material =
well-being";
"class" in terms of intellectual growth or the capacity to savor =
aesthetic
pleasure is severely low for the average wealthy person, who can in =
those=20
terms be describe as belonging to a lower class of societal members=20
(rednecks, philistines, republicans, chauvinists, etc).

One cure, in my opinion, and part of my future aims with my first =
"portal"=20
therepublicofcalifornia is to BRING "poetry" TO THE READER, i.e.,
turn all kinds of things from the ordinary world
into "poetry," most especially "fake web sites" and "real
ones," too.  For anybody younger, more ambitious and focused than this
dreamer, I encourage creating dozens of Yahoos, Googles, MSNBCs,=20
Microsoft.coms, IBMs, Halliburtons, U.S. Governments,
and every "brand" of anything public and commercial.  No, publishing
one's "poetry" in these free and everyday and habituated venues
will not, of course, get one into Lit History and the grand old =
Immortality
we're all desiring a lot of the time, but it would still be poetry, even =
if=20
it functions a bit differently.=20

Who is it, Guy Debord, http://www.bopsecrets.org/SI/detourn.htm,=20
or one of the "detournement" school poets/artists,
who recognizes that one of the "places" to look for poetry's next=20
new space, is out there in the world NOT EVEN TRYING TO BE POETRY,=20
or something like that (Brian Stefans interviewed by Giselle , =
"Hacktivism?=20
I didn't know the term existed before I did it,"
 http://www.uiowa.edu/~iareview/tirweb/feature/stefans/index.html#,=20
also talks about this)? =20

And not to be a giant phony, yeah, sure, I aspire to write poems,
or "better," in the top journals, "poetries,"=20
and see them in "Perfect Bound Heaven," so my idealism
is not pure.  But I am genuinely keen on the idea of=20
turning a lot of "the upper classes' common, everyday
visual and verbal representations" into subtle, "other"
new representations, "a low-class art including graffiti,"=20
as it were, and thus "bringing 'poetry' to them" instead
of waiting for them to put it into an acceptable, traditional=20
form, like a book, which "they" would not likely read, anyhow.

Blah blah, light thoughts from a really middlin classer.

it's being said everyday that it's BAD for the
Democrats to be firing away at one another
they way they are.  just yesterday i was in
Radio Shack, and a C-SPAN or CNN talk show
was on, and the commentator said, "This type
of behavior of sniping at one another is AWFUL
for the Democrats and the democratic process!"

really?  well i don't know about everybody else,
but i feel the absolute opposite is true.  it's very
important in these bleak times for passionate
voices and dialog, no matter how nasty it gets.
why do we want to complain about harsh words
when the war machine is shooting and killing?

any debate is healthy.  and "healthy debate"
is redundant, i think.

and furthermore, i'm NOT interested in having
Kucinich EVER agreeing with Lieberman by
the way!  i may not have much support in this,
but if truth could kill, Kucinich might well be
one the few left standing at these debates.

as a poet, i feel that one of my jobs is to make
the fear of language an obsolete fear.

As a poet, I would be very disappointed to see that happen. The fear
of language replaced the fear of God, as recommended by my church
when I was a kid in a church. To see language robbed of its power and
the respect due it would be very sad indeed.

geez, kirby, it's hard to know even where to start w/ this; it's so
full of half-truths, metalepses, etc, that ...well, i'll just stick
to one observation.  the "left" , or some watered down version of it,
although it relied a lot on racial exclusions to achieve these
benefits, gave us the New Deal, which bush is trying to dismantle.
the new deal gave us social welfare programs such as welfare,
medicare, afdc, etc.  these safety nets enabled women to leave
abusive marriages that were threatening to their lives and those of
their children.  the de-stigmatization of divorce has helped also, as
has the decriminalization of many forms of birth control.  many lives
have been saved by the decriminalization of abortion, and many
potential lives of abuse and poverty have been prevented by the
availability of birth control.  now, it is true that much of this
came about not thru the efforts of feminists but thru the
machinations of drug companies.  and availability is still to some
degree limited to the middle and upper classes. the families whose
intactness you assume to be a virtue are often hotbeds of abuse,
violence, destruction.  as for the charge that the left is
responsible for widespread drug use, i believe it is an open secret
that the cia rather than the left has been involved in the selective
proliferation of hard drug use in certain poor neighborhoods. most of
the world's poor are women and children.  in my view, feminism means
trying to do something about that, not "driving families apart." i
admire your honest search for what makes people happy, and for good
values you can pass on to your kids, but this strange need to blame
the "left" (many leftists actually frowned on drug use of the
ginsberg ilk as an index of apolitical self-involvement) really
doesn't make too much sense. ps that must have been Dick cavett.
perhaps the real problem is that you are or were, as a teen, too
suggestible, looking for easy answers (i.e. all it takes to have a
spiritual life is to take acid).  i probably watched that show too
but it would never have occurred to me to go out and take acid just
because someone famous said so on tv.

as a poet, or not a poet, i think it a bad idea to fear language.
understand language, yes, approach it critically in all instances (not
divorced from casualness in any manner necessarily), yes, but not fear it.
revelatory terms all abound:  absolute, fear, job, poet, language...
obsolete fear for whom?  absolute fear for whom?  there are better things to
fear, things that don't necessarily inform a rebellious stance or attitude
toward some (self)oprressive vehicle.  guns don't kill people.  eh?

returning to writing, Craig mentioned backchannel Mina Loy & her

medicine, as she became a Christian Scientist) and work

the book I read about her time in the Village also includes Djuna Barnes
-- Mary Butts, though in England, comes to mind, too, if yr looking for
key modernist writers from "good families" who were also drug addicts
(but then, the whole Crowley thing is tied together with religion,

comments about Butts, however, seem to indicate a marked dislike..."

http://www.findarticles.com/cf_dls/m0403/2_45/57589967/p1/article.jhtml

the list of leftist or anarchist women writers who were writing "art
poetry" at the last turn of the century includes Belgian of upper middle
class origin Adon Lacroix (what a name! even better b/w Man Ray's "Donna
LeCoeur"), who wrote very interesting prose poetry (anybody got access
to a Xerox-able copy of her fine press book??? published in Ridgefield?)
in addition to collaborative poems she wrote w/ (working class) Man Ray
before he started beating her. But, she believed in open marriage, and
Man Ray only said he did.

most of these women have unfortunate first marriages, many forced by the
family or undertaken to get out of the family (again, mostly marriage is
the woman leaving her family, except in the US); the stigma of divorce
seems to have provided the most courageous of them some escape

How's the recent word from our president for cynical endorsement of the
family in order to justify cuts in spending for social services?
"Administration officials say they are planning an extensive
election-year initiative to promote marriage, especially among
low-income couples..."  The AOL article goes onto mention that part of
the initiative is aimed at single mothers as they are giving birth.
Seems to me I went to catholic high school with a bunch of girls whose
families forced them to marry the baggers at the IGA who knocked them up
and *drop out of school* (why would this be necessary?)

The repression from fundamentalist religious institutions around the world
is mainly directed at language, as their power comes from controlling it.
"First there was the Word" is their first misreading.

Those of you interested in Maurice Blanchot's work, may want to read, or
re-read, Gerald L. Bruns's essay. "Language and Power." (Chicago Review,
Spring 1984. pp.24-43.)

I saw a Ginsberg  interview with William F. Buckley Jr. as well,
at my father's knee (but that was 1968). After Ginsberg
read poetry he said he had written while "under the influence",
I turned to my Dad and said in disgust,
"I'll never do drugs - that's not poetry! If he thinks it made him
more creative, I think it made him stupid!" I have learned more
about poetry since. I wonder what I'd think now?

Later, of course, I joined the YTC (Youth Temperance Council),
taking courses in drug and alcohol addiction. After reading the
pamphlet on the discovery of LSD-25 by a chemist who, on
taking it, thought he was a horse and then tried to fly out a
window, I changed my mind, and said, "this I have to try".

Temperance was my undoing.

Maria, you made a big mistake not listening to Ginsberg.  Taking LSD was the
greatest thing that ever happened to me.  When Rimbaud talks about colors of
vowels, it's no sweat, I was there, and know just what he was talking about.  And
I did talk to God.  It's just that it also killed half my friends.  Ginsberg's
ideas were meant for tough and or lucky people.  I went nuts for about two years,
but it was all kind of fun from this end, and showed me all kinds of things that
I wouldn't have otherwise known.  For some reason, however, it permanently
destabilized many of my friends, and a lot of them either killed themselves or
ended in asylums.  They're English muffins.  What can you say?  It worked for
Ginsberg, and it worked for me, but it probably killed a hundred thousand
people.  He wasn't just a poet -- he was a political leader with enormous
persuasive ability who had access to the mainstream media.  And yes, it was Dick
Cavett who interviewed him!!!!  The only clue I gave was pointy nose, and you
bagged it from that.  Very good sleuthing, I'd say.

I think one of our problems is a huge discrepancy concerning where Marxism and
"leftism" and where, say, the New Deal (Roosevelt) fits.  Roosevelt was not a
Marxist by any stretch!  Olson, who worked with Roosevelt, was also not a
communist.  But the democratic party (and poetry!) is slipping into the clutches
of Marxism.

Race, gender, class all come out of the class-bound ideas of Marx.  Simone de B.
says so about her gender ideas in The 2nd Sex.  And McKinnon and Dworkin and most
feminists use this filter.  As do most race theorists.  And it's gotten to be a
terrific mess.  It's hard for me to understand how such a blunt instrument can
help us understand anything about anything.  (I'm in favor of Kantian feminists!
and liberal feminists, but I'm not in favor of very much regarding Marxism.)

Just examine class thought.  If you say -- this person is a middle-class white
male, for instance, it could be Ralph Nader or it could be Ted Bundy.  The
specifics of who a person is are not even vaguely captured by these very broad
terms.  They mean almost nothing, and yet nobody seems to examine this.  They are
huge tools wielded by almost everybody now in academia, but the tools are just
delusions.

If I say African-American female from the middle class it could be a woman who's
gone nuts and is in Bellevue and was found shitting on the street in front of the
Chase Manhattan Bank or it could be Nobel Prize winner Toni Morrison.

The specifics of a person require tremendous research -- there are literally
thousands of bits of data that we need in order to understand even the slightest
thing about another person.  Those three bits of data won't get it.  They were
used in the Soviet Union to kill people.  Now they're being used in academia to
wipe people out, but only through kangaroo courts such as your attempt to frame
Tolkein.  Even the slightest defense and the kangaroo court disappears and is
ashamed of itself.

But these three units are used either to put people in good boxes or bad boxes by
almost the entire "left" these days as if they are something like an adequate
tool.  They are just garbage.

The big problem I see with the "left" is that it no longer has natural
predators.  So the ideas go on getting dumber and dumber.

PArt of the reason I'm attacking these ideas on this board is because I have to
start a clean sweep in order to create some competition for the dumber ideas of
the left.  When dumb ideas even get into the world of poetry, there is nowhere
left to go.  The left is soft, and I worry that with this softening, the right
will take over the country.  I want gridlock for as long as possible so that we
don't get either a Marxist or a Calvinist take-over (Bush and his gang belong to
a church called United Methodist which is a Calvinist-inspired church).

I'm attacking rather clumsily, and am getting wiped out here and there, but I
don't care.  I think the ideas of the left -- including that unwanted children
should be put to death by science -- are completely nuts.  Peter Singer at
Princeton is now arguing that children UP TO AGE THREE should be able to be
"aborted".

I think the ghosts of dead children hang around the necks of those who have
murdered them just like the dead children in Shakespeare hang around the necks of
those who slaughtered them in order to rise.  (In many of the history plays a
child is killed in order to clear the way to the throne.  When this is done, the
children literally haunt the killer -- as they do most notably to Richard III.
He finally collapses under the guilt and stress of this.)  It just isn't ok to
slaughter our children or other people's for any reason.  Children should be
sacrosanct because they are completely defenseless.  I think it should be legal
to have an abortion, and in the case of a rape I would not know what to say, but
the people I know who have done it (abortion) become depressed for years and
never completely recover.  It haunts them.   There is a reason for this.  It's
wrong, and so fundamentally wrong that the people who do it can never shake that
feeling free.  Do it if you can live with it.  I would never kill my children for
any reason, but I would try to have mercy to those who have taken this
extraordinary course.  It does, however, make me shudder that people could be so
merciless as to think that there are not tremendous psychological problems
attacked to this supposedly simple operation for absolutely anybody with a soul.
(Killing abortion doctors is not the answer, either.  It's just a lot more
complicated than either side sees it.)

I am sure that the DLC will agree with you about the Democratic party, but
the claim is ridiculous on its face.  The Democratic party you are
speaking of helped "end welfare as we know it," bombed selectively and
probably politically several countries in Africa, and created the
environment to allow Clear Channel to become a virtual monopoly in radio
and music production, to name only a few actual policies.  In general,
political wonks and activists do not read marx, although they may know
some the catch-phrases.

Kirby, you are simply repeating the idiocies promulgated by O'Reilly,
Coulter and others.  If you really respect FDR democracy, you would think
at least once before venting these jibes.  Clintonian democracy was
different, I grant you, but not in being further left.  And the fact that
Lieberman and Kucinich can be on the same stage under suggests that there
is a big tent in American politics.

This is a general question I'm throwing out --

There's a chunk in the beginning of Olson's Max poems -- really early on, when he
discusses Unitarianism.  He's talking about a Unitarian church in Gloucester that
stands on a street, and seems I think I remember -- to cast an ambiguous shadow.  I
have a copy of a photograph of that church, but I've never been to Gloucester and so
haven't felt the street widths, and so on, that would make the poem come alive.

But here's where a knowledge of denominations comes to the front in terms of
understanding American poetry.  Olson was a Catholic (or at least his mother was, and
he was raised thus).  This accounts to some extent for his love for the Catholic
church with its female saint that he discusses in terms of the Catholic church
there.  Meanwhile, he almost seems to demonize the Unitarian church.

This I think goes back to his days at Harvard (Harvard was originally a Unitarian
church-founded institution and discriminated against Catholics).  In the Clark
biography he points to this to some degree.  Olson says in this chunk of the poem
that the church had something to do with the importation of slaves into the
Massachusetts colonies.  (I'm not sure when slavery was outlawed in Massachusetts --
it is outlawed in 1808 in New York State, but there was a grandfather clause such
that existing slaves could be kept, and one historian has claimed that some of these
existing slaves continued on as slaves until AFTER the Civil War.)

This is just an example of how a knowledge of denominations can help us uncover the
nuances of poetry.  Unfortunately, I know next to nothing about Unitarians.

I do know that Coleridge's father was a Unitarian minister.  I think he maintained a
link to Unitarianism.  This might have meant that slavery would have been possible in
his Pan-Socratic society somewhere near Binghamton (I've emailed three Coleridge
experts but nobody knows the precise whereabouts of this place that failed to
materialize).

At first I thought Olson was making a hit at Coleridge.  But he's actually making a
hit at Harvard University -- as he does throughout the first whole movement of the
poem.  And in some ways he is contrasting Catholicism with Unitarianism.

Catholics took a beating all over this country throughout the 20th century but
particularly in the first half.  There is a book just out called Urban Renewal as
Ethnic Cleansing, from St. Augustine Press -- the author argues that urban renewal
projects were often slammed through Irish and Catholic neighborhoods (he documents
this in Detroit, Philadelphia, and Boston -- spending 100 pages or more on each) in
order for WASP voters to continue to have hegemony over Catholics in those cities.
He argues that in doing so those communities were destroyed, and the result was a
total collapse of those communities.  I've only read 50 pages but that's the gist so
far.

In some way, I think Olson's poem reflects this.  There must have been a movement to
get rid of ethnic Catholics in Gloucester, too, or to reduce their political clout --
Olson keeps referring to this throughout the first 100 pages.  Has anybody written
about Christian denominations in Charles Olson and what he's doing with this?

I should do more research on Unitarianism -- but does anybody have a good thumbnail
sketch based on having lived within it for some time?

When we think about the "content of character" by which ML King urged us to look at
people -- rather than looking at the color of their skin -- I think religious belief
or not tells us quite a bit about a person.  Olson's viewpoint is shaped by it, it
seems to me, as is his lack of favor regarding Unitarianism.

"But the democratic party (and poetry!) is slipping into the clutches of
Marxism."

Kirby, these words could have come from Martin Dies (chairman of the HUAAC)
in 1938. His conclusion- there were aprroximately 3,000 communists working
for the government under...you guessed it, FDR!

And let us not forget Henry Wallace, FDR Cabinet member & Vice President. He
ran against Truman in 1948 because he opposed his Cold War policies. He was
disgraced as a communist & banished from mainstream political life, feeding
anti-New Deal bonfires for decades.

The Democrat/Commie connection's been Bircher rhetoric for 70 years. When
are these Marxists going to clutch already?

Hey folks,

I wanted to announce the Death of Poetry blog, www.deathofpoetry.blogspot.com.
This is a blog written by my freshman composition course this semester.
Members of the class have all committed to a team blog as part of the course.

The course is a workshop in written prose argument using the theme of the title
as its unifying idea.  As for their formal assignments (not on the blog), we
have four units: (1) they're starting off the class reading the death of poetry
debate in the late eighties/early nineties; (2) they're looking at some of the
politics of neoformalist movements; (3) they're doing a research project on
poetry in the new media (possibly including this list, and certainly including
other poetry blogs); and finally (4) they're doing a close reading of a film
(of their choosing) representing poetry.  Some of the best of these may get
posted as documents on the blog later on.

Their first blog posts are informal responses to Joseph Epstein's 1988
_Commentary_ article "Who Killed Poetry?" bemoaning the state of the world.

We're just starting, and remember, these are first-year college students in a
composition class, not a poetry class as such.  But I thought Poetics list
people could contribute to the comment function in a useful way.  I think the
students would love to know that someone is interested in the issues they're
exploring at the beginning of their college career. I know I'd appreciate it.

Best,
David

Just to reiterate: I'm teaching a class here, and taking a slight pedagogical
risk by inviting the (mostly) wonderful POETICS listserv community to
contribute.  Please make comments recognizing that these are 18 year olds who
come to the class knowing NOTHING about poetry; and if you do comment, try to
keep your comments (sorry Kirby) secular, OK?

I made a chapbook out of 25 poems, and made a PDF from the page
layout. I'll probably make saddle-stapled versions of it in the
coming days. But anyway, here it is if anyone is interested:

http://www.brentbechtel.com/series/akeymemberoftheage.pdf

Today is also my birthday - turning 25, so one poem for each year
it seems, like candles.

I heard that program! Buckley didn't take Ginsberg seriously until he read.
It was "Wales Visitation," and it was astounding. Buckley was almost
speechless after it, and you could hear the new respect in his voice. At
least that's how I remember it, but maybe because I'm older than you, and
the San Francisco Beats were my teachers and friends at the time. We do know
that Buckley changed his views on psychedelic drugs, maybe because of
Allen's genius.

I know that it is often difficult to pick up sarcasm on the web sometimes.

But.

Well, I know that a lot of USAmericans think that their Democratic

"But the democratic party (and poetry!) is slipping into the clutches of
Marxism." (Kirby Olson)

I look at this and other such statements by you Kirby, and think two things.

One, how did such *reactionary* perspectives end up on this list.  And two,
how could I not think that certain sectors of the intellectual right, given
this climate, would not end up as resident rightest gadflies on this list. You
can say you're not "right" but almost every position you take glides alonside
some kind of rightest perspective.

I'm looking hard, by the way, for that water "slide" into marxist poetry (add
history)...on the way down, I hope to run bump WEB Dubois, George Oppen,
Langston Hughes, Pablo Neruda, Louis Aragon, Rene Otto Castillo, Bertold Brecht,
Jeff Derkson, and lot's of great poets on this list, actually.

Does this sound commisorial to you? Am I a commisar?  Is my snow-stiff
overcoat long enough weather a windstorm of posts following this? Will I oppress
your poetry? Will I oppress you criticism?  Will I mislead your students?  Will
the lambkins take their clothes off and polar bear it down the slide? Will
there be first, second, third, fourth, and fifth wave feminists waiting at the
bottom...let's hope so...I'm commin down, boys, girls...

Would of any us here *joyfully* be your "own" <depeche mode tune>
"personal"..."commisar"..."someone to"...mhmmm...

Do your daily rations of the-opposition-is-the-problems make us non-"post"
feminists--shy.
Do your daily rations of the-opposition-is-the-problems make us non-"post"
feminists--shy
Do your daily rations of the-opposition-is-the-problems make us non-"post"
feminists--shy
Non- "post" marxist"
Non-"post "class <struggle>"
Non- "post" race critiquest...abolitionism...
Non- "post"


and two, how does it feel to be the resident reactionary of this list...do
you get kick backs from somewhere...non-contractual that is.

Words will sizzle as poets read at Sizl


By Susan Broili : The Herald-Sun
sbroili@heraldsun.com
Jan 12, 2004 : 7:07 pm ET

CARRBORO -- Words will soon sizzle along with visual art displays at
Sizl Gallery, when Ken Rumble, a poet who lives in Pittsboro, brings the
Desert City Poetry Series to the Carr boro gallery.

Begun in Winston-Salem in 2002, the series offers a venue to
established, younger poets whose work pushes the boundaries of
contemporary poetry.

The series debuts locally at 8 p.m. on Jan. 22, and will feature
Carrboro Poet Laureate Patrick Herron as well as nationally known Duke
University professor Joseph Donahue. The reading is free and open to the
public. The gallery is at 405 E. Main St.

Sizl owner Karen Shelton said the series fits the gallery's mission.

"I tend to bring in contemporary emerging artists. It's just really
exciting young energy," Shelton said.

While all the artists aren't necessarily young, most are, Shelton said.

The focus on youth has been successful for the gallery, which has
featured work by artists in their early 20s.

A case in point is artist Anna Podris, whose work Sizl started carrying
when the artist was just 21.

"I've sold over 40 paintings of her work," Shelton said. "Her work is
figurative and dreamlike and pushes the boundaries a little bit."

The gallery owner said she's also made a point of offering diverse arts
such as music and dancing.

"I'm just trying to be as community-oriented as possible ? rather than
just a business," she said. "I think people who run galleries have a
desire for it to be more than a business and want to educate the public
about all the arts."

Rumble said he was looking for a local art gallery to host the series
and Sizl seemed just the place.

Aside from admiring the selection Shelton features, Rumble was looking
for a different kind of venue for the event.

"For the most part, poetry is in a coffeehouse where you have to fight
over the noise of the espresso maker, or in a university ... where
people are already interested in poetry," Rumble said. "I'm interested
in creating a venue for poetry outside of universities and colleges."

He said he hopes such a series will also encourage a local poetry
community to build and develop.

Rumble tries to choose poets who have published a book-length collection
of poetry. Beyond that, it's a matter of personal taste as well as
opportunity, he said.

He will continue the mix of local and national poets he featured when
the series was based in Winston-Salem. One local and one national poet
will read each month at Sizl.

Rumble said he sees the series as part of his job. A published poet
himself, with an MFA in poetry from Penn State, Rumble teaches poetry at
UNC Greensboro and writes reviews of poetry books.

At present, his poetry series is dependent on the "good graces" of the
participating poets, but he said he plans to seek grants that would
enable the poets to receive an honorarium.

Rumble described Donahue's poetry as "mystical" and "like following a
looping and twisting but fascinating trail."

Donahue is the author of several poetry collections including "World
Well Broken," "Terra Lucida" and "Incidental Eclipse." A long time New
Yorker who received his doctorate from Columbia, Donahue comes to North
Carolina most recently from Seattle. His poems have appeared in "New
Directions," "St. Marks Newsletter," "Talisman," "The Village Voice
Literary Supplement" and "The World."

In addition to serving as Carrboro's poet laureate, Herron is a research
assistant with ibilio.org in Chapel Hill. He is the author of several
poetry manuscripts including "Hyperlustrous Purse" and "Be Somebody."

Herron's poems have appeared in "Jacket," "Canary River," "VeRT" and
"Fulcrum." Two of his poems appeared as part of Project Hope at the
Tokyo Metropolitan Art Museum in 2002.

"I think he's an excellent poet," Rumble said of Herron. "His poetry is
a full-frontal assault on all the things there should be a full-frontal
assault on. On the other hand, he can be remarkably tender and eloquent
on a lot of feelings people share."

I think we need a new Popular Front...

Seriously though, while I disagree with much of what Kirby says, I think he
makes two good points:

1) the left has a kind of machinery that takes over and often tends to make
its own ideas obsolete before progress has actually been made

2) there are indeed Marxist underpinnings for a lot of contemporary leftist
rhetoric. Now I tend to have a certain fondness for Marxism, but I do
wonder how useful it is as a tool for looking at class in America... we're
not living in Europe or the nineteenth century anymore, and a lot of the
signifiers we associate with class are different now, especially since the
invention and proliferation on a large scale of demography, marketing, and
PR. Class in America has an elusive, mass, popular component to it that
those in power attempt to measure and control by means of these tools. I
think we need to take another, more nuanced (perhaps non-binary?) look at
how class works in this country, because knee-jerk Marxism, despite my
innate fondness for it, isn't terribly helpful at this point.

I know that it is often difficult to pick up sarcasm on the web sometimes.

But.

Well, I know that a lot of USAmericans think that their Democratic
Party is "the left," but I havent heard this "communist" stuff since
satires on the McCarthy hearings.

Didn't I show that race, gender, class are communist designations arising
from
within Marxism?  Can you refute this?  I gave a very specific example.  Can
you
refute it?

I can't respond to the board today because I have used my two responses.

-- Kirby


Well Kirby, first things first. The very specific example you gave is
ill-informed. The communist accusations/associations were never more
attached to an administration than it was to your very specific example-
FDR. The next three Democrat presidents sent Americans to Asia to kill
communists. Jimmy Carter's a good Christian & Clinton...well, enough said.
If he's your idea of a Marxist sympathizer, you need to give talk radio a
rest. It's important to talk about this, because you're using "slipping into
the clutches" as a present issue- as if it's happening now. Truth is, as
I've stated before- this is House of Un-American Activities (30's) &
McCarthy/John Birch Society (50's) & Barry Goldwater (60's) & Ronald Reagan
(80's) & Rush Limbaugh (90's) rhetoric. They've all been warning us about
the Democrats "slipping into the clutches of Marxism."

The forementioned champions of unabashed capitalism vigorously defended a
system that reinforced the denial of the human rights of women, minorities &
working people. This is a fact, not communist propaganda. The guardians of
"Americanism" called ANYONE who worked on behalf of feminism, racial equity
or labor "communists." This is a pointed smear in most cases, intended to
marginalize the very real struggles of civil rights, feminism &
unionization.

Your terminology argument is irrelevant. That was not the point you were
making. Marx did not invent melanin or the XX chromosone. These are real
people who have, & continue to engage in struggles for liberation. They are
not theoretical inventions. Marx is indeed used- by rightists as a tactical
scare to continue expoitation of said groups. Your claim about Democrats in
"the clutches of Marxism" continues a dangerous & poisonous tradition that
attempts to undermine the work for social justice.

George,

Unfortunately, everything old is new again, at least in regard to slurring
liberals in this fashion.  it never really went away and David Horowitz
has made a career out of calling universities Marxist (tho' at least
having worked for Ramparts, he knows more about what is to be Marxist then
your typical conservative).  i think of it as the tourette's of the right,
but some days it just feel like tic.

Rodrigo,

Thanks for this poetic rejoinder. I really liked hearing it & think it,
well, long overdue.  Not because it targets one person, but because it
responds directly to some of the wandering assumptions behind strange
claims about what is in fact a fictional U.S. American (so-called) centrist
normalcy, a reluctance to take a stand where such claims are being made here
and elsewhere from that *normalizing* position, about all sorts of unlikely
things.

Thanks for clearing the air.  In my opinion.  For what it's worth.

Chris Murray

  that Muslims use the Lunar Calendar to count from... a difference of
                    approximately 11 days a year...

Last night in Milwaukee there opened the exhibtion and learning/organizing
Project Dossier.
It is an active project to educate people to protest the Patriot Act and all
connected actions by the Bush Administration.
The Lead speakers were from the ACLU and as well Bob Barr, one of the most
hostile and aggresive Congressional leaders in the fight to impeach
President Clinton.
Both "left" and far right fighting against the intrusion and stripping away
of Fourth Amendment Rights.

to George and the others who agree,
so you see value in a fear of language?

okay, maybe you are seeing something
that i haven't seen, so please delve deeper
into why you believe this.  i for one would
appreciate reading why you believe this.

but meanwhile, here's how i see it:
the fear of language is an extension of
the other constructs of our culture which
are based on fear.
not having enough money
not being beautiful
not being loved
the list is endless, but fear of language
has always seemed to me (depending
on which words of course and/or the
topic of conversation, or poem) to plug
into any number of other fears of how
one should act or what one feels of
one's worth.

and fear--as we know--is very much part
of creating respect in our culture, and
keeps the engine full of gas, because,
once fear is instilled, it's difficult to shut
it down because courage is called for,
and courage is always in short supply
when you've been taught to respond and
react to the world from fear.

fear has been used to motivate nations
for a very long time and the result is a
world with bigger & BIGGER bombs which
lead to bigger & BIGGER fears.

when i say that it is my job as a poet to
make fear of language an obsolete fear, i am
saying that language is a door into what controls
those larger fears in our world, and to create
room for everyone to set aside their fears of
language is key to helping put an end to the
madness of war and consumerism and blatant
environmental destruction and abuse of animals
--and of course the abuse of one another.

so i do not see the value in continuing the
maintenance of fear of language.  as a poet i want
to be fearless with words, and by example show
others that it's okay, that your hair really won't
burst into flames, or that God doesn't strike
you down.

if respecting language in your terms means
to keep the power (the fear) maintained, than
i will not respect language in the same way,
and it's as simple as that.  my idea is that
the world is too beautiful to continue allowing
the abuse.  language (as corny as this may
wind up sounding) can free us.  it does not
have to pound us into submission.

Waiting for me in the arms of a guilty
city, you grow cold and vague
with snow. At a certain point
in dialogue with the sycophant
I require no more input, and no input
requires me. You'll be able to
swim now, head just above the un-
comfortable line that dragged your mother
past your dad, himself glazed and frosted,
buffed like a mirror but rippled to
distort. He avoids the city; nothing
grows there, or flies, or swims.

But your mother's just fine, with
her house a conversation piece at
last. When I talk now clauses buckle
over each other, pile up in subcutaneous
knots, and no-one can respond to that.
My gelded town sucks its own
reflection from the nightly news:
this "hardened steel town" is reeling.
A teacher drunk in a hotel room drunk
with a student. The lessons come
frozen

Again, simply saying that an idea has been advanced by the right, and therefore
is no good is an example of an ad hominem attack.  The right can also have good
ideas.

Simply to want to wipe out the entire right is wrong.  Again, this is an example
of what has happened to the left.  Only certain viewpoints could possibly have
any intelligence, and therefore we will only listen to ourselves.  For thirty
years the left hasn't had a single new idea, and I'm bored brainless listening
to them.

I don't listen to talk radio or to O'Reilly and haven't read Anne Coulter.  I
read Lutheran and Catholic mainstream journals and you get many of these same
ideas.  It's just that the mainstream media is almost completely secularized at
this point.  O'Reilly is saying what millions of Catholics are thinking.
They've been driven out of the mainstream discourse, and have for a very long
time.

In a list like this, nobody is even aware of the prevalence of other opinions.
So much for diversity.

Even if many Democratic presidents did work against official communism, at this
point the Democratic party doesn't have any other source of ideas.  When Carol
Moseley Brown turned her votes over to Howard the Duck this afternoon she said
"race and gender" in her speech at least a dozen times.  Not once was class
mentioned.  I find it amusing that this variable is so often held in abeyance.

It's one of the only interesting things that I see happening on the left.  I've
always been on the left, but now just find myself bored and annoyed by the
incredible shrinkage.  Two static variables, neither of which indicates moral
choice, but which are givens.  I think they tell you nothing about anything.  If
I knew what a person's relationship to the religion in which they grew up was --
this would tell me more because it would indicate a moral choice.  As Aristotle
put it in the Poetics -- we can only understand a person's character through
their moral choices.  Race and gender are not moral choices.  They're just
static variables and in and of themselves are unintelligible.  Neither one is
predictive of much of anything.  What does Paris Hilton have to do with Tammy
Fae?  What does Tim Duncan (basketball player) have to do with Dennis Rodman.
Think about the arc that a person makes in time through moral choices.  These
are active, not static.  Really, let's try to function, please.

Here's the lines I wanted to discuss in Olson's poem.  They are on p. 9 of the
Maximus Poems, or section I.5:

1

the light, there, at the corner (because of the big elm
and the reflecting houses) winter or summer stays
as it was when they lived there, in the house the street cuts off
as though it was a fault,
the side's so sheer
they hid, or tried to hide, the fact the cargo their ships brought back
was black (the Library, too, possibly so founded).  The point is
the light does go one way toward the post office,
and quite another way down to Main Street.  Nor is that all:
coming from the sea, up Middle, it is more white, very white
as it passes the grey of the Unitarian church.  But at Pleasant St.
it is abruptly
black
(hidden
city

Ok, now here's the factual part which I looked up since nobody responded.  In 1805
Henry War was appointed Unitarian professor of divinity at Harvard.  This led to
tremendous splits in congregations all over the Northeast.  Harvard remains largely
Unitarian for a great long while after this.  And this is the very center of
Olson's poem.  Olson was discriminated against and so he has a burr in his flesh.
And throughout the poem he's making hits at Unitarian, and against Universalism (a
branch of Unitarianism).  Unitarians, unlike most Christians, do not believe that
Christ was God, but only a man.  On p. 381, Olson says, "God is fully physical."
And on page 442, a poem in its entirety:

"I believe in religion not magic or science I believe in society
as religious both man & society as religious"

And finally on p. 379 -- "I hate universalization."

There are many many more bits of data, but I cite three that seem to indicate a
hint in that direction.  I think the thematic center of the poem is his discussion
of various denominations, of which Unitarian is probably the key.  I hadn't thought
of this until Anselm Hollo brought up the idea that denominations shouldn't matter,
but they do in some kind of useless way in American history.  So I thought about
this line, and then this poem seemed to partially open.

Unitarians are probably the most liberal congregation of the Christian rainbow.
There is almost nothing that you have to believe in to be a Unitarian.  And somehow
(pronoun antecedents are difficult to grasp often in Olson's poem) he's saying that
the Unitarian church is responsible for the slavery in the first lines of the poem,
or somehow connected to it.  There is also the Massachusetts Bay Colony (mucho
slavery in its heyday, as the Butterick notes comment).

Thanks to back channel contributions, especially Dale Smith's.  The front channel
just seems to all be bad argument -- straw man arguments -- which is to take the
weakest part of my argument, or to summarize it badly (I didn't bring up FDR).
What you are supposed to do in an argument is to take on the best part of my post.
You take on the best points, and either engulf and devour, or else you expand on
them, and contribute something.  You don't get sidetracked about commissars and
personal things.  I'm not interested in anybody on this list.  I'm only interested
in ideas. I haven't seen many, and would like to stir some up by scraping together
whatever sticks I can to start a fire.  Personally, I'm embarrassed at the state of
American poetic discussion, and find this list to be simply representative of a
general degradation into a sort of Alzheimers in which people rant and rave about
race and gender as if they mean something.  Only Tim Peterson contributed by
looking at the race, class, gender issue as an outgrowth of Marxist category of
class.  And Maria had the beginning of Harvard.  But there's still so much more to
the story, here.  Try to stay on track.  We're having a discussion here, and if you
want to contribute, do so fairly.  Reread your freshman composition book if you
need to, ok?  Try to remember the main faults -- ad hominem means you can't dismiss
an idea because of its affiliations, straw man means you should summarize an
argument fairly.  Well, that's enough of a lesson for today.

There is another interesting bit of data -- THE FIRST UNITARIAN church in America
is precisely THIS ONE in Gloucester.  It was at 86 Middle St., but when Butterick
wrote his notes it was already Temple Ahavoth Achim.  Is it still that?

Was this branch of Unitarianism pro-slavery, or did it look the other way?
Generally, the Unitarians are thought to be abolitionists, but I think Olson is
saying that they were not  -- that the slave pens found in the basement were
actually their own?  In the pronoun "their" in the line that ends "their ships" --
whose ships were they?  If they were the Massachusetts Bay Colony's, then how is
the Unitarian church implicated in it?

I'm sorry to talk about poetry, but I thought that this is what this list was
originally about.  Backchannel contributions  from people who don't want to bother
with the  others on the board remain welcome.  Maybe I could start a discussion
again about the poem if some wanted to actually talk about it, and not get
sidetracked.  Anybody who actually wants to do this could backchannel me, and maybe
we could start a separate discussion by private email?

-- Lutherans have a long history of rather dumb arguments with Catholics.  They can
dish it back, believe me.  They like to get into Luther as a sexual beast who left
the church in order to get it on with his later wife, etc.  OR they talk about how
Luther had emotional problems.  Anything but dealing with the financial abuses of
their church at that time.  But it's just for fun, mostly, now.  We are actually
very very close to Catholics.  We are probably closer to them than any other
Protestant denomination.  We have signed a pact of mutual understanding.
Personally, I really like Catholics, but I enjoy teasing them sometimes, and being
teased by them.  But all that's a side issue.

When does Unitarianism start?  My understanding was that it came out of the
Socinian heresy whch started in the 1500s.  The Cavalier poet John Suckling wrote a
treatise in defense of the Socinians in the 1630s, so it would have been important
at precisely the time that Harvard was being founded.  That's another issue -- not
only who did found Harvard, but what did they later become?  Obviously, like almost
all American universities at the time, they were originally set up to create
ministers.  What faith were Harvard's ministers?  I could look this up, but I am
happy to delegate!

Yes, something like supreme value.

The language is much larger, much older and much stronger than I will
ever be. That is a reason for profound respect. If it lets me talk
about a recipe for beef stew, I am thankful. If it lets me venture
into the kind of experience that poetry is for, my eyes are wide open
like those of a kid who has just seen a ghost. In fact, when you
consider where Yeats, Shelley, Blake, Rilke, Duncan and Blaser say
that their poetry comes from, one would be a fool not to be scared.

That is not fear. That is anxiety or resentment or sorrow. If a
bill-collector comes to see me I will be fretful and anxious. If a
poetry angel or ghost offering or demanding poetry, a chill goes up
or probably down my spine.

It seems to me that you are talking about little private personal
individual problems here. That is a long way from the serious way in
which a poet takes language.

Poetry is a reminder that those things will happen.

Any poet who thinks that HE/SHE has that power is a dope.

I am suspicious of claims that we will be freed. Irving Layton wrote
that poetry is freedom. I am afraid (heh heh) that I disagree. As a
poet I think (and here is where I, too, may be corny) I serve.

Yo hablo, yo soy. ?Y que!:
New Perspectives from Latinas/os on their Dynamic Language Experiences

Latinas/os are often presented in media, academic, and popular discourse
in a traditional immigrant model that measures assimilation solely
through language usage. We find this model to be lacking in terms of the
complexities of language experiences that we ourselves have lived. To
illustrate how Latina/o self-identification is inflected through a
variety of language experiences, we are seeking submissions in a variety
of genres for an anthology that focuses on the subject of "Latina/o
Language Experiences." Such experiences may run the gamut from childhood
stories, interactions between lovers, workplace relations or between
family members, educational or religious experiences, interactions among
Latinas/os, or with other cultural groups. We believe that the diversity
of perspectives and voices offered will provide insight into the fluid
dynamic of social, class, cultural, communal, and national identity
formation and provide insight into how identity is formed, lost, maintai
 ned, or otherwise negotiated through language usage.

This collection challenges the notion that there is a one-to-one
correspondence between language practice and ethnic identity. Our
observations tell us that people's relationships with language is
dynamic, fluid, and circumstantial.

*How, for instance, does language usage reflect cultural allegiance,
ethnic "authenticity", community identification, and the politics of
cultural inclusion and exclusion?
*What are the political, economic (class), emotional, and spiritual
dimensions of language?
*How do we use language as a tool for community building and political solidarity?
*How has language been used as a basis for division or exclusion?
*How has language shaped and been shaped our attitudes and experiences
about gender, sexuality or sexual identity?
*How do our language choices, limitations, and capacities affirm as well
as frustrate our relationships with others?
*Has the "Latinoization" of the U.S. affected the mainstream's
perception of linguistic practices and the homgenization of U.S. Latinas/os?
*How are language experiences distinct among generations of Latinas/os?

Submissions may include, but need not be limited to, topics as
linguistic chauvinism, linguistic pride, linguistic deficiency or shame,
and advantages of bi- or multi-lingualism. Historical perspectives might
consider how our language practices functioned to enable or facilitate
community survival and resistance. Submissions can be in any fiction or
non-fiction style such as poetry or prose, short interview, short oral
history written in essay format, or personal memoir. What we are looking
to compile is a portrayal of the wide range of experiences that reflects
the complexity of Latina/o language experiences and which, taken
collectively, asserts meaning about the significance of language as a
means of self-fashioning and self-identification.

Submissions are due: January 15, 2004

Blackmedina Seeks Submissions
Ý
MISSION
It is the mission of Blackmedina to host the images and expressions of
highly talented writers and artists that are often denied a voice in
mainstream commercial media. In persuit of this mission, Blackmedina
will gather compelling literature, provoking graphic art and photography
to feed the soul of our audience and reflect the faith, spirit and power
of humanity.

It is evident that as our condition evolves so do our expressions and
perceived self-images. This is the manner in which we communicate our
individual and collective state of being. This is the manner in which we
create our identity.

In sight of this, Blackmedina proves to be the first of a new breed. Our
focus is to lend a sense of consciousness to our readers. In our
success, we will create a union between artist and audience. A sacred
space where honest expressions of the human condition are shared,
encouraged and appreciated.

Gee Kirby, is a lie advanced from the right used to cripple the cause of a
decent wage, or the right to vote- is that one of those good ideas? That's
what we're talking about. Or do you believe that Martin Luther King Jr. was
a Kremlin agent? We are not talking about ideas. We are talking about lies.
Let me say it again. Lies. I don't call them good ideas.

I've seen/heard O'Reilly many times, & I'm aware of the arguments. The
problem with yours is that it's factually incorrect. And check your own
diversity, friend. There are millions of Catholics in this country (Mexican,
Central American, Carribean) who aren't in tune with O'Reilly. (e.g.- his
anti-immigrant rants.) Or don't they count? I'm sure you wouldn't willingly
exclude them. You probably just never considered them in the first place,
right?

Which is why race & gender NEED to be addressed in the political arena. It's
a shame you've gotten bored before the message got through. You're
admittedly "bored brainless." Who's active? Who's static?

Bush Plans $1.5 Billion Drive for Promotion of Poetry=20
By ROBERT ST. JOHN and DAVID LOWELL

WASHINGTON, Jan. 13 =E2=80=94 Administration officials say they are planning=
 an=20
extensive election-year initiative to promote poetry, especially among low-i=
ncome=20
poets, and they are weighing whether President Bush should promote the plan=20
next week in his State of the Union address.=20

For months, administration officials have worked with conservative groups on=
=20
the proposal, which would provide at least $1.5 billion for training to help=
=20
people develop interpersonal writing skills that sustain "healthy poetry."=20

The officials said they believed that the measure was especially timely=20
because they were facing pressure from conservatives eager to see the federa=
l=20
government defend traditional poetry, after a decision by the highest court=20=
in=20
Massachusetts. The court ruled in November that language poetry is legitimat=
e=20
under the state's Constitution.=20

"This is a way for the president to address the concerns of conservatives an=
d=20
to solidify his conservative base," a presidential adviser said.=20

Several conservative Christian advocacy groups are pressing Mr. Bush to go=20
further and use the State of the Union address to champion a constitutional=20
amendment prohibiting language poetry. Leaders of these groups said they wer=
e=20
confused by what they saw as the administration's hedging and hesitation=20
concerning an amendment.=20

Administration officials said they did not know if Mr. Bush would mention th=
e=20
amendment, but they expressed confidence that his poetry promotion plan woul=
d=20
please conservatives.=20

Ronald T. Haskins, a Republican who has previously worked on Capitol Hill an=
d=20
at the White House under Mr. Bush, said, "A lot of conservatives are very=20
pleased with the healthy poetry initiative. We need the world to make sense.=
"=20

The proposal is the type of relatively inexpensive but politically potent=20
initiative that appeals to White House officials at a time when they are squ=
eezed=20
by growing federal budget deficits.=20

It also plays to Mr. Bush's desire to be viewed as a "compassionate=20
conservative," an image he sought to cultivate in his 2000 campaign. This ye=
ar,=20
administration officials said, Mr. Bush will probably visit programs trying=20=
to raise=20
poetry awareness in poor neighborhoods.=20

"The president loves to do that sort of thing in the inner city with black=20
churches, and he's very good at it," a White House aide said.=20

In the last few years, some liberals have also expressed interest in=20
poetry-education programs. They say a growing body of statistical evidence s=
uggests=20
that children fare best, financially and emotionally when exposed to poetry=20
early, in a two-poet family.=20

The president's proposal may not be enough, though, for some conservative=20
groups that are pushing for a more emphatic statement from him opposing lang=
uage=20
poetry.=20

"We have a hard time understanding why the reserve," said Glenn T. Stanton,=20=
a=20
policy analyst at Focus on the Family, a conservative Christian organization=
.=20
"You see him inching in the right direction. But the question for us is, why=
=20
this inching? Why not just get there? Rhyme is healthy!"=20

The Rev. Louis P. Sheldon, chairman of a national group called the=20
Traditional Poesy Coalition, has started an e-mail campaign urging Mr. Bush=20=
to push for=20
an amendment opposing the legal recognition of language poetry. "The stuff=20
doesn't make any sense," Sheldon says, "and we have to get it out of our hom=
es."

Other groups, like the Southern Baptist Convention and Focus on the Family,=20
are pushing more quietly for the same thing, through contacts with White Hou=
se=20
officials, especially Karl Rove, the president's chief political aide, who h=
as=20
taken a personal interest in maintaining contacts with evangelical groups.=20

In an interview with ABC News last month, Mr. Bush was asked if he would=20
support a constitutional amendment against language poetry.=20

"If necessary," he said, "I will support a constitutional amendment which=20
would honor poetry as something that should rhyme and make sense, codify tha=
t,=20
and will =E2=80=94 the position of this administration is that whatever poet=
ry people=20
want to write, they're allowed to write, so long as it's traditional and=20
embraced by the state."=20

Asked to cite the circumstances in which a constitutional amendment might be=
=20
needed, Trent Duffy, a White House spokesman, said on Tuesday, "That is a=20
decision the president has to make in due time."=20

The House of Representatives has approved a proposal to promote poetry as=20
part of a bill to reauthorize the 1996 communications law, but the bill is b=
ogged=20
down in the Senate.=20

Without waiting for Congress to act, the administration has retained=20
consultants to help state and local government agencies, community organizat=
ions and=20
religious groups develop poetry-promotion programs.=20

Wade F. Horn, the assistant secretary of health and human services, said:=20
"Poetry programs do work. On average, children raised by two poets hearing=20
healthy, stable traditional forms enjoy better physical and mental health an=
d are=20
less likely to be poor."=20

Prof. Linda J. Waite, a demographer and sociologist at the University of=20
Chicago, compiled an abundance of evidence to support such assertions in the=
 book=20
"The Case for Poetry" (Tripleday, 2000). Ms. Waite, a former president of th=
e=20
Population Poetry Association of America, said she was a liberal Democrat, b=
ut=20
not active in politics.=20

Some women's groups like the NOW Legal Defense and Education Fund oppose=20
government programs that promote traditional poetry. "Such programs intrude=20=
on=20
personal privacy, and may coerce women to write in ways they don't want to=20
write," said Timothy J. Casey, a lawyer at the fund.=20

Administration officials said their goal was "healthy poetry," not poetry fo=
r=20
its own sake.=20

"We know this is a sensitive area," Dr. Horn said. "We don't want to come in=
=20
with a heavy hand. All services will be voluntary. We want to help poets,=20
especially low-income poets, manage their writing in healthy ways. We know h=
ow to=20
teach problem-solving, negotiation and listening skills. This initiative wil=
l=20
not force anyone to write in any particular way. The last thing we'd want is=
=20
to increase the rate of writer's block."=20

Under the president's proposal, federal money could be used for specific=20
activities like advertising campaigns to publicize the value of poetry,=20
instruction in poetry skills and mentoring programs that use traditional poe=
ts role=20
models.=20

Federal officials said they favored education programs that focus on high=20
school students; young adults interested in poetry; and poets who marry when=
=20
writers are thought to have the greatest commitment to their art.=20

Alan M. Hershey, a senior fellow at Mathematica Policy Research in Princeton=
,=20
N.J., said his company had a $19.8 million federal contract to measure the=20
effectiveness of such programs. Already, Mr. Hershey said, he is providing=20
technical assistance to poetry-education projects in Alabama, Florida, Georg=
ia,=20
Indiana, Louisiana, New Mexico and Texas.=20

A major purpose, he said, is to help people "communicate about all the issue=
s=20
you see in poems: money, sex, child-raising and other difficult issues that=20
come up."=20

Dr. Horn said that federal money for poetry promotion would be available onl=
y=20
to traditional writers. As a federal official, he said, he is bound by a 199=
6=20
statute, the Defense of Poetry Act, which defined poetry for any program=20
established by Congress. The law states, "The word `poetry' means only a poe=
m=20
which rhymes and makes sense."=20

But Dr. Horn said: "I don't have any problem with the government providing=20
support services to other kinds of poetry. If someone wants to write languag=
e=20
poetry, okay, that's their choice."=20

Sheri E. Steisel, a policy analyst at the National Conference of State=20
Legislatures, said, "The Bush administration has raised this issue to the na=
tional=20
level, but state legislators of both parties are interested in offering poet=
ry=20
education to low-income poets."=20

First of all, what hell is "healthy poetry" exactly?  Is it something that
compels emotions from both the author and reader or is it something that
would be printed on a coffee mug or calendar?  Having read Bush's poetry,
I'm inclined to think the latter.
Any poet who reads this article ought to be outraged.  The chilling effect
these measures could have on our art is staggering.  What would this
amendment allow or, for that matter, take away?  Will federal funds be taken
away from writing programs that don't fit the mold?  Will schools lose
funding if they don't teach a certain lesson plan?
The only thing you can hope for if this measure passes is that the backlash
creates a more subversive poetry culture.

I've been trying to follow this discussion with my customary bewilderment:
if I get this right it is being said by some that concepts like class, race
and gender are Marxian inventions? Now, for a start, my recollection is that
he doesn't have much more than the attitudes of a typical Victorian on
matters of race or gender, on class though he can be corrosively accurate.
But with class, take a text like The Merry Wives of Windsor. Now whatever
the elusive Shakespeare thought privately the message of the play is very
clear: that prosperous middle-class members should be glad to see their
daughters (and money) married to indigent aristocrats as this would enhance
their status, just as the rude mechanicals in A Midsummer Night's Dream are
portrayed as figures of fun in their artistic efforts because of what they
socially are. One could throw off examples like this from British literature
scatter-gun: Donne's concern that his 'man' i.e servant could enjoy as much
from physical love as he could, Milton's comparison of Satan to being like a
thief breaking into the home of 'some rich burger' etc etc. Now unless Marx
had access to a time machine and secretly wrote Shakespeare, Milton, Donne,
Old English literature, that of 5th century Athens, Classical Rome, ancient
China etc it would be safe to presume that the concept of class predates
Marx and is clearly operative in the literary inheritance, just as it
remains in our societies, unless there has been something I don't know about
and the houses of the Hamptons are now available on social security to the
underclass or the homeless of Leicester are given rooms reserved for the
dons in Cambridge. I don't think that has happened somehow. The questions
that have been bubbling along about the relationships between 'freedom of
speech' and leisure i.e. social status are interesting and in what way that
relates to poetry.

Keri, I'd invite you to address the question head on by sending me something
for my new column 'Write for the Health of It' coming in MAG
http://www.muse-apprentice-guild.com/.  It's ironic that this should be
coming out at the same time I'm starting the column - I see myself as an
anti-Hallmark poet.

Better yet, maybe I should sue as they've stolen my copyrighted (I think
since I have used "Write for the Health of It (c)"  Any thoughts on how I
can sue welcomed.

Analysis of Carson, Analysis of Lacan Tomato, with Original Texts


Analysis of Carson


This is an exciting tale of the Malay Peninsula and the Seven Seas. I have
used the tale as a way of deconstructing Empire in the guise of Language.
I have also played with History as you see, with Dylan Thomas for example,
and Conrad / Carson for another. Carson has an 's' and Conrad a 'd' thus
'sd' or 'said' reflecting on the telling of this tale which is also a Tale
of Origin. Am I not the pale White? Am I not lost, as my words are lost,
in the Fires of the World? This is about the Fires of the World, and the
sounds or Music, which is that of the cycles of Creation and Destruction.


Analysis of Lacan Tomato


One would not associate 'Lacan' and 'Tomato' but a forced enclosure will
necessarily generate narrative. Due to the prevalence of the Net and
distributed intelligence, the narrative may easily be constructed through
the use of a search engine and minor subsequent modifications of the
results. Without head or tail, the residue of the investigation does
indicate, as all, even false, investigations do, a relationship between
these terms and any others. Given that, the presence of protocol
sentences, or even 'true' and 'false' data, is submerged within the
maelstrom of information.


Relation


Thus the relation between the Fires of the World and the maelstrom of
information, the disappearance of statement and the Empire of language,
becomes clear. Every text presupposes every other in my work, every text
is transformed by every other. The result is resonance, not entity. And
every text is fundamental, operative within the same sememe, producing the
same peripheral results. This work is the dance of theory.


Real-Life


The coffee-pot just broke. We just returned from an excellent reading in
zero-degree weather. Currently reading Ko Won, Buddhist Elements in Dada.
The air purifier is working. The medication for hypothyroid is working.
Our music tonight (trumpet, guitar) was tired and meandering. Can you
photograph a slide with flash? A cathedral? The nighttime sky? The sun?
- Yes to all of these.


Carson


She's exhausted; the cold cuts through her. The mast is covered in ice.
The boat is going under.


Lacan Tomato


The imaginary splits. The Real splits. The linguistic shifted shifts
uncomfortably. Anamorphic readings bend truth, don't get rid of it. The
slant truth meets the slanted mass. Ten below zero. The dance of theory.


Carson

betrayal, another drink for the old man, penny for the old guy. his Lord
Jim's the meandering of a soul with division inherent among the races,
ratings, and that pain of his, a coward against those of Islam who tend
beneath steel-grey skies - who tend, I say to my old friend, as if there's
yet another mindless sea-captain, fat or thin or tall, who can tell?
-:aye, the natives and their fearsome beliefs:aye, the voices breathing
down our necks:
aye, the voices chanting in the distance

Haha, nice. I see you've been tinkering with the recent New York Times =
article, "Bush Plans $1.5 Billion Drive for Promotion of Marriage." =
(with strategic replacement of words, ahhh nice.)

George, thanks for your answers, but your respect
for language is based on fear?  i understand you
have a deep respect for language.

but respect doesn't have to be based on fear.

what i have been trying to get at is that the fear
of language is constricting.  of course it's clear
to me that you would NOT agree with me that
language can free one if you follow the idea that
fear is not something to remove.

you say the way i feel about the world is how
you feel about language.  but you're wrong,
in that i do not separate the world from language.
and not because i want to see them this way,
but because i believe they are inseparable.

there's an amazing documentary i saw last
year on cellular research.  what scientists have
discovered is that cells communicate all the
time with one another.  and when a cell is
not getting communication, when it's ignored,
it kills itself.  the researchers actually used
the word suicide, it's not me reading into what
they were saying, they said it just like that.

communication/language is the world and all
we have to understand ourselves.  whether that
language be music, words, touch.  without it
we're dead.  we are the macrocell structure.

Tenderness and Beauty are what we'd want,
i'm sure of it, if we had that and only that, and
then were asked later to choose that, or fear.

well we can choose something beyond fearing
the words that we use with one another, and
yes, respect those words, but respect them
without the battleground which has been
ripping us to shreds for thousands of years.

The frightening thing is that I believe this is something he could have
said...Didn't Barbara cancel her poetry to-do because "they" were afraid
there would be poetry of protest?

I don't think I'm alone in feeling/thinking, etc., that the US is fast
becoming a fascist project.  The election can't get here soon enough--if
it's not too late...I know, I know...hasty generalization; however...

nah. I wasn't making reference to marxism. I was commenting on the use of
the terms 'right' 'left' and 'center' and how they are a hindrance to [
    ] discussion

They seem to fall so easily from political mouths, becoming meaningless [
      ]

I'm not quite seeing here how such "archaic" categorizations contribute to
understanding [           ], or have any use in foregrounding [           ]
acts.

Kirby,
I hope to get back to this thread later, but too many essays to grade at the
moment. What follows might, however, help with the bit quoted below:
>There is another interesting bit of data -- THE FIRST UNITARIAN church in
>America
>is precisely THIS ONE in Gloucester.  It was at 86 Middle St., but when
>Butterick
>wrote his notes it was already Temple Ahavoth Achim.  Is it still that?

The church in question began as the first ***Universalist*** (not Unitarian)
church in USAmerica (& perhaps the Americas but I am not certain). The
church is still there, though it is now officially an "Independent Christian
Church" but one clearly in the Unitarian-Universalist tradition. (I have
attended services there on a few occasions. I have also given a reading and
have seen a few of my students' punk bands perform in the church basement.)
{The Temple is a few doors down as one heads toward Pleasant St. [see
Olson's poem quoted below].}

this from Judith Sargent Murray Society founder Bonnie Hurd Smith:

"In 1774, one of [Universalist James] Relly's protegés, John Murray, who was
then preaching in the New York and New Jersey areas, was invited by Winthrop
Sargent to Gloucester. There, he discovered, "to my great astonishment,
there were a few persons...in that remote place, upon whom the light of the
gospel had more than dawned. The writings of Mr Relly were not only in their
hands but in their hearts."2 And, in Gloucester, John Murray met Judith
Stevens with whom he began a long and spiritual friendship.

John Murray decided to make Gloucester his home, and the small group of
"adherents" to the new faith met regularly in private homes. Judith was an
active member. Eventually, they decided to build their own place of worship,
and on Christmas Day of 1780 the first Universalist meeting house in America
was dedicated in Gloucester. Judith Sargent Stevens [later Murray] signed
the founding documents." {A look at Judith Sargent (Stevens) Murray might
shed light on the feminism-as-Marxism discussion in another thread. But I am
no expert.}

Also, the first Universalist Church/Independent Christian Church described
by Olson as grey had been painted white some time before I moved to
Gloucester. Within the last few years the church has been renovated and
repainted grey.

Again, I would love to discuss the poem & hope to write more later
(tonight?) (this weekend?) but for now this is all I can add.

all the best,
James

I'm looking for information on the poet/painter Kay Johnson, also known as
"Kaja." If anyone has biographical information, photos, or has any idea of
her current whereabouts, I'd be most appreciative.

I've begun a webpage about Kay at http://emptymirrorbooks.com/kaja.html &
will add more to it as I get more material.

Also interested in an address or other contact information for Perdido Press
in New Orleans. While doing a Worldcat search I found that they published,
in 1998, something entitled "Kaja" by Kay Johnson, but I haven't been able
to locate a copy or to find any additional information about it. Can anyone
help me out?

Thanks!

cheers & gracias ~

"there's not time to cook the cake..." and
I'm a little worried Jeff, 'cause you see me as a dragon,
it's one of my traumas, always the same story...
I don't know why people think I'm a dragon, I'm not!
but always people treat me like a dragon, why?
yes Jeff, so many arrows over me, always...
I don't bite Jeff, so why?
it's incredible but it's like this: I say,
for instance,
"Gandhi day gone D-Day"
and far from the reply
"appear a peer up here"
or even "a rose is arrows"
is that face of "I hate you, dragon..."
and this dragon is far from searching for war...
far, Jeff! and I know people are waiting
for me to pay with the same coin,
but I hate this...
I can kill, you know, if I want to,
but it's not my style...
so I prefer to query:
"don't 1000 secret moral surfaces
double between your echoes...?"
it's useless... let's spend time in this:
change of theme ( but what I wrote is true)
I'm sad 'cause you see me as a dragon...
change of theme, else
then begins the same battle...
poor of me, dragon...
I'm a good pet after all, but... but?... yes,
tons of "but watch out! I have fire..."

The Chicago Poetry Project Presents:

Ron Silliman
&
Stacy Szymaszek

Saturday, January 24th at 1pm
Harold Washington Library
400 S. State St.
Chicago Authors Room, 7th floor

 =D6

Impact of gravity on light causing linebreaks, sheep
graze on a hillside, ignorant of their despair.

- Ron Silliman, "Manifest"

Two early works define Ron Silliman=EDs approach as a
poet and theorist: Ketjak and The New Sentence. Both
works also laid out the structure of his process and
project over the last 25 years.

Silliman's notorious essay, =ECThe New Sentence,=EE is an
analysis of the prose poetry that some key Bay Area
LANGUAGE writers, such as Watten, Harryman, and
Grenier, were working on in the mid-70=EDs. Locating
their work within 20th century ideas in linguistics
and linguistically-oriented criticism, he argues that
none of the available theories of language, literary
or otherwise, can adequately capture what these
writers were doing. Essentially, they had taken the
reifying effects of poetry=F3its ability to make
language tangible=F3into prose. In poetry, this is
usually accomplished via line breaks, meter, and sonic
devices. The new sentence, however, does this by
abandoning reference and by employing a kind of
negative discourse strategy that builds paragraphs out
of tangentially related sentences.

Silliman put this idea to work himself in Ketjak, a
book that has spawned almost everything he has done
since. He's drawn a large diagram for himself that
outlines and connects everything he=EDs done (and plans
to do). The diagram takes the form of a tree with
Ketjak at its root. Probably the most important branch
in the tree is The Alphabet, a work in progress with,
as expected, 26 sections. The quotes above are from
Manifest, the M. Not all of The Alphabet is written in
prose but throughout Silliman employs the disjunctive
strategies he identifies in The New Sentence.

These days, Silliman is probably best known as author
of "Silliman's Blog," a colossal undertaking of poetry
journalism to write about experimental & "post-avant"
(his favored term) poetry every day of the week,
including weekends. As with his other creative
projects, his aim in the Blog is ambitious & generous:
to include the world of poetry as much as he can, & to
describe it in the manner he best understands it.

Silliman comes to Chicago, Poor Chicago, from the
Philadelphia area, where he works in the computer &
technology industry.

-Stacy Szymaszek, from "Some Mariners."

One of the younger writers Ron Silliman has celebrated
on his Blog on more than one occasion is Stacy
Szymaszek. But the Chicago Poetry Project feels like
it was down with Stacy even before she was cool on the
Blog scene. Her work might be characterized as
Objectivist interiority, but it just as easily could
be understood as a lyrically interfering mythography.
Reminiscent at times of the work of Niedecker, Fanny
Howe, and even Olson, Stacy's work is marked primarily
in its engagement with location, locale, and locus as
they configure means of understanding life in the
Upper Midwest.

Author of several chapbooks and broadsides, including
"Three Poems," "Survival," "Emptied of All Ships," and
"Some Mariners," which is forthcoming from EtherDome,
Stacy is also the editor of the journal "traverse,"
with Drew Kunz, and "gam," a journal devoted to
writing from the Great Lakes region. She lives in
Milwaukee, where she is the Literary Program Manager
at Woodland Pattern Book Center -
http://www.woodlandpattern.org/ - one of the greatest
book stores, with the most admirable devotion to
poetry, in the United States.

I'd love to say I was being ironic with my post about the 1.5 billion, but I
admit I thought it was real.  I guess I wouldn't put anything past this
administration at this point and could see something like this occuring.
I'm going to my corner now to feel shame and cry.

This is a riot--, though I do feel the satire it is a bit weakened by=20
the joining at the hip of "rhyme" with "making sense," which reflects=20
more on the writer than it illuminates the sensibility being=20
satirized (dana gioia's new post notwithstanding).

That automatic association of rhyme with the traditional sounds like=20
a carryover from the days of deep image school or something.  In=20
fact, contemporary philistines are probably more likely to prefer=20
their pablum in unrhymed free verse.

Rhyme can as easily be seen as the perfect companion of not making=20
sense. These unexamined assumptions need to be shaken out & tried on=20
once in a while to see if they still fit.

No need, Keri: Pres. HeGrewBogus

try to neutralize the bozo publicity
Laura engendered in her hands-off
recension of the White House po-fest

upstaged by the $100mil bequeathed

Billy Collins cud, or he might want to
discover less demeaning rhymes for his

I, too, dream on.

Good point, Annie, as the poet say to the painter
in Timon of Athens (when the painter asks the poet to be art-critic):

I will say of it,
It tutors nature; artificial strife
Lives in these touches, livelier than life

I'll Be Voting For Wesley Clark / Good-Bye Mr. Bush =E2=80=94 by Michael Moo=
re




=C2=A0


January 14, 2004


=C2=A0


Many of you have written to me in the past months asking, "Who are you going=
=20
to vote for this year?"


=C2=A0


I have decided to cast my vote in the primary for Wesley Clark. That's right=
,=20
a peacenik is voting for a general. What a country!


=C2=A0


I believe that Wesley Clark will end this war. He will make the rich pay=20
their fair share of taxes. He will stand up for the rights of women, African=
=20
Americans, and the working people of this country.


=C2=A0


And he will cream George W. Bush.


=C2=A0


I have met Clark and spoken to him on a number of occasions, feeling him out=
=20
on the issues but, more importantly, getting a sense of him as a human being=
.=20
And I have to tell you I have found him to be the real deal, someone whom I'=
m=20
convinced all of you would like, both as a person and as the individual=20
leading this country. He is an honest, decent, honorable man who would be a=20=
breath=20
of fresh air in the White House. He is clearly not a professional politician=
.=20
He is clearly not from Park Avenue. And he is clearly the absolute best hope=
 we=20
have of defeating George W. Bush.


=C2=A0


This is not to say the other candidates won't be able to beat Bush, and I=20
will work enthusiastically for any of the non-Lieberman 8 who might get the=20
nomination. But I must tell you, after completing my recent 43-city tour of=20=
this=20
country, I came to the conclusion that Clark has the best chance of beating=20
Bush. He is going to inspire the independents and the undecided to come our=20=
way.=20
The hard core (like us) already have their minds made up. It's the fence=20
sitters who will decide this election.


=C2=A0


The decision in November is going to come down to 15 states and just a few=20
percentage points. So, I had to ask myself -- and I want you to honestly ask=
=20
yourselves -- who has the BEST chance of winning Florida, West Virginia, Ari=
zona,=20
Nevada, Missouri, Ohio? Because THAT is the only thing that is going to=20
matter in the end. You know the answer -- and it ain't you or me or our good=
=20
internet doctor.


=C2=A0


This is not about voting for who is more anti-war or who was anti-war first=20
or who the media has already anointed. It is about backing a candidate that=20
shares our values AND can communicate them to Middle America. I am convinced=
 that=20
the surest slam dunk to remove Bush is with a=20
four-star-general-top-of-his-class-at-West-Point-Rhodes-Scholar-Medal-of-Fre=
edom-winning-gun-owner-from-the-So
uth -- who also, by chance, happens to be pro-choice, pro environment, and=20
anti-war. You don't get handed a gift like this very often. I hope the=20
liberal/left is wise enough to accept it. It's hard, when you're so used to=20=
losing, to=20
think that this time you can actually win. It is Clark who stands the best=20
chance -- maybe the only chance -- to win those Southern and Midwestern stat=
es=20
that we MUST win in order to accomplish Bush Removal. And if what I have jus=
t=20
said is true, then we have no choice but to get behind the one who can make=20=
this=20
happen.


=C2=A0


There are times to vote to make a statement, there are times to vote for the=
=20
underdog and there are times to vote to save the country from catastrophe.=20
This time we can and must do all three. I still believe that each one of us=20=
must=20
vote his or her heart and conscience. If we fail to do that, we will continu=
e=20
to be stuck with spineless politicians who stand for nothing and no one=20
(except those who write them the biggest checks).


=C2=A0


My vote for Clark is one of conscience. I feel so strongly about this that=20
I'm going to devote the next few weeks of my life to do everything I can to=20=
help=20
Wesley Clark win. I would love it if you would join me on this mission.




=C2=A0


Here are just a few of the reasons why I feel this way about Wes Clark:


=C2=A0


1. Clark has committed to ensuring that every family of four who makes under=
=20
$50,000 a year pays NO federal income tax. None. Zip. This is the most=20
incredible helping hand offered by a major party presidential candidate to t=
he=20
working class and the working poor in my lifetime. He will make up the diffe=
rence by=20
socking it to the rich with a 5% tax increase on anything they make over a=20
million bucks. He will make sure corporations pay ALL of the taxes they shou=
ld=20
be paying. Clark has fired a broadside at greed. When the New York Times las=
t=20
week wrote that Wes Clark has been =E2=80=9Cpositioning himself slightly to=20=
Dean=E2=80=99s=20
left," this is what they meant, and it sure sounded good to me.


=C2=A0


2. He is 100% opposed to the draft. If you are 18-25 years old and reading=20
this right now, I have news for you -- if Bush wins, he's going to bring bac=
k=20
the draft. He will be forced to. Because, thanks to his crazy war, recruitme=
nt=20
is going to be at an all-time low. And many of the troops stuck over there a=
re=20
NOT going to re-enlist. The only way Bush is going to be able to staff the=20
military is to draft you and your friends. Parents, make no mistake about it=
 --=20
Bush's second term will see your sons taken from you and sent to fight wars=20=
for=20
the oily rich. Only an ex-general who knows first-hand that a draft is a=20
sure-fire way to wreck an army will be able to avert the inevitable.


=C2=A0


3. He is anti-war. Have you heard his latest attacks on Bush over the Iraq=20
War? They are stunning and brilliant. I want to see him on that stage in a=20
debate with Bush -- the General vs. the Deserter! General Clark told me that=
 it's=20
people like him who are truly anti-war because it's people like him who have=
 to=20
die if there is a war. "War must be the absolute last resort," he told me.=20
"Once you've seen young people die, you never want to see that again, and yo=
u=20
want to avoid it whenever and wherever possible." I believe him. And my ex-A=
rmy=20
relatives believe him, too. It's their votes we need.


=C2=A0


4. He walks the walk. On issues like racism, he just doesn't mouth liberal=20
platitudes -- he does something about it. On his own volition, he joined in=20=
and=20
filed an amicus brief with the Supreme Court in support of the University of=
=20
Michigan's case in favor of affirmative action. He spoke about his own=20
insistence on affirmative action in the Army and how giving a hand to those=20=
who have=20
traditionally been shut out has made our society a better place. He didn't h=
ave=20
to get involved in that struggle. He's a middle-aged white guy -- affirmativ=
e=20
action personally does him no good. But that is not the way he thinks. He=20
grew up in Little Rock, one of the birthplaces of the civil rights movement,=
 and=20
he knows that African Americans still occupy the lowest rungs of the ladder=20=
in=20
a country where everyone is supposed to have "a chance." That is why he has=20
been endorsed by one of the founding members of the Congressional Black Cauc=
us,=20
Charlie Rangel, and former Atlanta Mayor and aide to Martin Luther King, Jr.=
,=20
Andrew Young.


=C2=A0


5. On the issue of gun control, this hunter and gun owner will close the gun=
=20
show loophole (which would have helped prevent the massacre at Columbine) an=
d=20
he will sign into law a bill to create a federal ballistics fingerprinting=20
database for every gun in America (the DC sniper, who bought his rifle in hi=
s own=20
name, would have been identified after the FIRST day of his killing spree).=20
He is not afraid, as many Democrats are, of the NRA. His message to them: "Y=
ou=20
like to fire assault weapons? I have a place for you. It's not in the homes=20
and streets of America. It's called the Army, and you can join any time!"


=C2=A0


6. He will gut and overhaul the Patriot Act and restore our constitutional=20
rights to privacy and free speech. He will demand stronger environmental law=
s.=20
He will insist that trade agreements do not cost Americans their jobs and do=
=20
not exploit the workers or environment of third world countries. He will exp=
and=20
the Family Leave Act. He will guarantee universal pre-school throughout=20
America. He opposes all discrimination against gays and lesbians (and he opp=
oses the=20
constitutional amendment outlawing gay marriage). All of this is why Time=20
magazine this week referred to Clark as "Dean 2.0" -- an improvement over th=
e=20
original (1.0, Dean himself), a better version of a good thing: stronger, fa=
ster,=20
and easier for the mainstream to understand and use.




=C2=A0


7. He will cut the Pentagon budget, use the money thus saved for education=20
and health care, and he will STILL make us safer than we are now. Only the=20
former commander of NATO could get away with such a statement. Dean says he=20=
will=20
not cut a dime out of the Pentagon. Clark knows where the waste and the=20
boondoggles are and he knows that nutty ideas like Star Wars must be put to=20=
pasture.=20
His health plan will cover at least 30 million people who now have no covera=
ge=20
at all, including 13 million children. He's a general who will tell those=20
swing voters, "We can take this Pentagon waste and put it to good use to fix=
 that=20
school in your neighborhood." My friends, those words, coming from the mouth=
=20
of General Clark, are going to turn this country around.


=C2=A0


Now, before those of you who are Dean or Kucinich supporters start cloggin'=20
my box with emails tearing Clark down with some of the stuff I've seen float=
ing=20
around the web ("Mike! He voted for Reagan! He bombed Kosovo!"), let me=20
respond by pointing out that Dennis Kucinich refused to vote against the war=
=20
resolution in Congress on March 21 (two days after the war started) which st=
ated=20
"unequivocal support" for Bush and the war (only 11 Democrats voted against=20
this--Dennis abstained). Or, need I quote Dr. Dean who, the month after Bush=
 "won"=20
the election, said he wasn't too worried about Bush because Bush "in his sou=
l,=20
is a moderate"? What's the point of this ridiculous tit-for-tat sniping? I=20
applaud Dennis for all his other stands against the war, and I am certain Ho=
ward=20
no longer believes we have nothing to fear about Bush. They are good people.


=C2=A0


Why expend energy on the past when we have such grave danger facing us in th=
e=20
present and in the near future? I don't feel bad nor do I care that Clark --=
=20
or anyone -- voted for Reagan over 20 years ago. Let's face it, the vast=20
majority of Americans voted for Reagan -- and I want every single one of the=
m to be=20
WELCOMED into our tent this year. The message to these voters -- and many of=
=20
them are from the working class -- should not be, "You voted for Reagan? Wel=
l,=20
to hell with you!" Every time you attack Clark for that, that is the message=
=20
you are sending to all the people who at one time liked Reagan. If they have=
=20
now changed their minds (just as Kucinich has done by going from anti-choice=
 to=20
pro-choice, and Dean has done by wanting to cut Medicare to now not wanting=20
to cut it) =E2=80=93 and if Clark has become a liberal Democrat, is that not=
 something=20
to cheer?


=C2=A0


In fact, having made that political journey and metamorphosis, is he not the=
=20
best candidate to bring millions of other former Reagan supporters to our si=
de=20
-- blue collar people who have now learned the hard way just how bad Reagan=20
and the Republicans were (and are) for them?


=C2=A0


We need to take that big DO NOT ENTER sign off our tent and reach out to the=
=20
vast majority who have been snookered by these right-wingers. And we have a=20
better chance of winning in November with one of their own leading them to t=
he=20
promised land.


=C2=A0


There is much more to discuss and, in the days and weeks ahead, I will=20
continue to send you my thoughts. In the coming months, I will also be initi=
ating a=20
number of efforts on my website to make sure we get out the vote for the=20
Democratic nominee in November.


=C2=A0


In addition to voting for Wesley Clark, I will also be spending part of my=20
Bush tax cut to help him out. You can join me, if you like, by going to his=20
website to learn more about him, to volunteer, or to donate. To find out abo=
ut=20
when your state=E2=80=99s presidential primaries are, visit Vote Smart.


=C2=A0


I strongly urge you to vote for Wes Clark. Let's join together to ensure tha=
t=20
we are putting forth our BEST chance to defeat Bush on the November ballot.=20
It is, at this point, for the sake of the world, a moral imperative.

Empire


We are the first successful Empire in a century. We are the world's first
and last Superpower. We are not Amerika or Amerikkka. We are America. We
are proud of what we do. You are weak and we are strong. We are the
proudest people on earth. We own you. We control your economy through our
own and through force. You are using our Internet. Your country exists
because we allow it to exist. We invented radio and television. We
invented the airplane and the automobile. We are the new people. We are
the freest people on earth. We are determined to protect ourselves against
you. We control you. It doesn't matter what you think of us. It doesn't
matter what our people think of us. The Three Branches of Government are
owned by us. The Three Branches of Government will do what we tell them
to. We are the Three Branches of Government.  You can complain all you
want. You can think your country is yours. You can think whatever you
want. You will bark if we say bark. If you do not bark you are evil. If
you are evil we will destroy you. We will destroy you and your culture.
Our culture is Christian and good. We do not care if you are Godless. We
do not care what you believe. We will give you democracy. We own your
banks. You will free trade with us. We will starve you if you do not obey.
Your sports are stupid sports. Your songs are stupid songs. Your movies
are boring. Your television is backwards.  You are infidels. We have the
best sports. We really have the best sports. We will take what we want.
You are nothing. You have earthquakes and fires and volcanos. You have
flooding rivers and millions killed. You are living in the bad areas of
the world. Our country is God-Given. Our country will take what we want.
Our soldiers are the most powerful who ever lived.  Our planes will bomb
you any time we want them to. Our military is perfect. There is no
destroying our country. The United States are stronger than any bomb. We
are stronger than any disease. You are punished with disease. We will let
you die if we want. We will take anything we want. We will sell you our
drugs. We are a great mixed salad of wealthy people. Our women are the
most beautiful in the world. Our men are the best athletes in the world.
We are the wealthiest people on earth. We live longer than anyone else on
earth. We deserve our lives. We deserve our wealth. We work harder than
anyone else for our wealth. Other people are lazy but we are not. Other
cultures are old but we are new. Other cultures are slow but we are fast.
We will never be slow and we will always be new. We own the moon and Mars.
We will own anything we want to own. Your words mean nothing. Your books
mean nothing. Your ideologies mean nothing. We will do what we have to do.
We have heard your stories over and over again and they are boring. The

Hi all,

Our non-NY Small Press series has gone real well since starting this past
summer here in New York City. We've already hosted:

Meritage Press (San Francisco/St. Helena, Calif.),
The Owl Press (Woodacre, Calif.),
Avec Books (Penngrove, Calif.),
CyPress (Cincinnati, Ohio), and
above/ground press (Ottawa, Canada),

And forthcoming are:

Feb. 5   Chax Press (Tucson, Arizona)
March 4  Carve (Boston)
April 1
May 6    Oasis Press (Brunswick, Maine)
June 3   Combo (Providence, Rhode Island)
July 1   Talon Books (Vancouver, British Columbia)

The readings are on the first Thursday of each month at Aca Galleries at 529
W.20th St., 5th Flr. (bet. 10th and 11th avenues) at 6:00 p.m., and feature
contributors from the presses reading for 20-30 minutes and a musical act
performing for 15-20 minutes, a break, and then 20-30 minutes more of
readings and 15-20 minutes more of music.

The gallery operators are amazing folk and connected to the poetry community
in that they're the son-in-law and daughter of the poet Simon Perchik. They
provide wine and other beverages, cheese, and fruit for each reading, too.
Oh yeah, no door either.

You'll notice that April 1 is open. If your press is interested, please
backchannel me to editor@boogcity.com

thanks,
david

DWP Free Journal distributor Damien Ober sustained a leg injury and is laid
up. So far, we've amazingly been able to make free copies of the journal
thanks to him, keeping the journal free for our readers. However, because of
Damien's injury, our new issue will have to depend on the benevolence of
friends. If you can photocopy the journal and leave copies at bookstores,
coffee shops, newsstands and bars in your area, we would be grateful. The
DWP distributes everywhere there are readers---public buses, health clubs,
jury deliberation rooms. If you've got access to a photocopy machine, or
know someone who does, give me the address and I'll send out a master copy
immediately.

Forward this message to friends, office employees, college faculty and
trusted state officials.

The DWP is committed to providing free and open forums for artists, writers
and performers. We are committed to getting quality literature into the
hands of everyone. In the course of our first three issues, our distribution
has increased to 5000 readers.

Interesting intellectual trash you have posted here, Alan, but you miss =
three points:
1. This empire exists because it kicked shit out of empire aspiring =
assholes (I assume you have enough literacy of historic world events to =
fill in the blanks of the names of the empire building =
aspirants...although I concede that assumption may exceed your =
intellectual capacities, for it assumes you actually are familiar with =
the history of the world in the 19th and 20th centuries...and that may =
have required you to think rather than merely have sucked your thumbs.). =


2. This empire has never taken or laid claim to any lands (other than =
enough to bury its dead soldiers) from any nation it sped to defend and =
assist to free from tyranny. =20

3. This empire continues to defend the idiotic assumptions that other  =
countries/cultures have value, despite the fact that those cultures =
consistently fail to defend their own values.  And this empire continues =
to offer its citizens as soldiers in defense of the ideals of freedom =
for the masses, irrespective of either religious and or economic views.  =
This truly saddens me.=20

As a personal note, I object to the current war.  I reject the views of =
our current president. I did not then, nor will I in the future vote for =
the man, nor do I believe the U.S.A. should be fighting in either IRAQ =
or Afghanistan...I think Iraqi assholes should have been killing other =
Iraqi assholes, and I am convinced that Taliban would be better dealt =
with by anti Taliban Afghanis.  However, those folks don't seem to care =
enough about their own freedoms as much as they care about taking your =
freedoms away from you, to have put a foot forward to attempt to stop =
what was going on in their homelands, pity that!

  But, neither do I condemn the people of this country!  These words of =
yours, Alan, chastise the nation, and that criticism is both ignorantly =
targeted and unjustly leveled.=20

Build answers to these questions into your profile:

How many Europeans rose, before the fact, to stop the swell of the rise =
to power of:

Hitler, Mussolini, Franco, Tito, Stalin, Amin?  Answer: ?

How many people in the nations of the world would be free to express =
their views or would exist at all,  had the empire building egotists =
mentioned above succeeded in amassing enough power to take control of =
the western world?  Answer: ?

Would the world be better off, morally, of course, if Hitler had =
conquered all of Europe and the Western Hemisphere?  Answer: Yes, if you =
are a white totalitarian...No, if you are an American. =20

And these are just the Opener questions...wait for round 2.   =20

  We will never be slow and we will always be new. We own the moon and =

I am totally ignorant! We really beat the hell out of Franco, intervened
in Rwanda, Chomsky is our minister of war, the fact that black men are
more likely to end up in jail than college only points to our freedom of
choice, we've all got wonderful health-care here and I've just missed it,
we protected Vietnam against the agressors from the North, our weapons of
mass destruction are for peaceful purposes only, and we certainly do
defend the value of other countries and their values - Tibet for example,
East Timor, for another, the Palestinians for a third.

I was gonna burn the flag, but I guess I'll go back and read history
again.

I don't think anybody needs to feel foolish about the satire. Sometimes
satire reflects the truth in ways that reality doesn't. Let me put my own
spin on the Bush Space Poetry Program.

First of all, the Republican Party's unstated platform to occupy the Middle
East during the Bush Administration was not a satire. So, the satire that
follows might ring true in a way.

Bush is unhappy that US poets dissed his wife. Being a vindictive man, Bush
will target List members as the first poets to live on the moon, an
involuntary artists colony. Naturally, the grant will cover writing
materials, but not food or oxygen. Future anthropologists will consider the
surviving work remnants of an alien culture.

Since Bush and his staff may have been negligent (or worse) in preventing
9/11, he will attempt to suppress all criticism by appointing Amiri Baraka
the Poet Laureate of Mars and sending him to the Red Planet without the
supplies to survive the several-year trip. I predict Baraka's last messages
To earth will be some of the most ferocious poetry ever created through the
oral tradition. Whether they survive political erasure is another question.

This is the real story behind the Poets in Space program. You heard it there
first.

Vernon

I know that this is satire, but I have a sneaking hunch that you
believe that radio and television and the automobile and the airplane
really were invented by Americans.

What truly saddens me is that the above remarks prove that US

Frankly, I - in counter-empirial, paranoid mode - was initially suspicious
- well, in old fashioned English Department crit terms-  of the the over-
the-top "mock ironic rant"  of "the speaker." Certainly the seeming
"inexhaustibility" of its triumphal measures connected it to Alan's usual
accessibility to a surplus of resources and the redistribution of such. But.
Impulsively, I suspected the possibility of an agent provocateur - sneaking
through Alan's enormous informational networks - to take false advantage and
demonically exploit the satiric model. Was the tirade met to set up a "you
sucker" trap, wanting as many on this list as possible, to automatically
fall for its righteousness, encouraging us to publicly declare unqualified
allegiance for the cut of its blade. A clever strategy that would resolve
itself by the possible (or not) sudden appearance of someone, say one of our
resident xenophobic etc. conservative poets who will (or will not) come out
of the Right's "anti-terrorist, Christian loving, Arab distrusting,
didactic, repress everyone, more than potentially fascist aka anarchistic,
what every you mostly say is an ad hominine attack,  let's have a meaningful
discussion woods?" Who will then shamelessly declare authorship and preen in
pride of having publicly entrapped, exposed embarrassed as many of us as
possible???

Somebody wouldn't do that, would they? In a time when paranoia or,
preferably, "a just suspicion"  is an entirely reasonable waking and/or
sleeping strategy - particularly if you are a person of color or "other"
sexual persuasion,  am I alone here, or totally twisted to imagine such?

Or am I becoming "brainless", too?

Tinfish Press is pleased to announce the publication of _Philter_, by
Normie Salvador; this is our first chapbook that comes saturated with
perfume (get them while the scent lasts!).

Salvador is a poet who lives in Waipahu, Hawai`i and  writes rather
like a pre-Raphaelite; in the essay included in this chapbook he
describes himself as a "cane spider," or "a local writer experimenting
with literary boundaries."  The book is designed by Jeff Sanner.

Buy _Philter_ for $8.

Also available are Deborah Meadows's _from A Theory of Subjectivity in
Moby-Dick_ ($10); Zhang Er and Bob Holman (trans.), _Carved Water_ ($8)
and soon to come, Susan M. Schultz's _No Guns, No Durian_ ($7) and _The
Prison Poems of Ho Chi Minh_, translated by Steve Bradbury ($10).

for more details, see http://maven.english.hawaii.edu/tinfish

aloha, Susan

Hmm, this must have been the anachronism du jour--sort of like
playing Rachmaninoff on a harpsichord.

Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; format=flowed

Being in that domestically unsettling phase of student life and--to be quite
honest-- purposefully stringing out such a phase for upwards of a decade,
what with “graduate” and undergraduate work, my Post Office Box address has
outlived many shared apartments and houses. It’s the more tactile end of the
connection to my personal imagined community of poets, publishers and
editors, making the short walk between my current apartment and the Post
Office, along with morning coffee, one of those routine defining rituals I
simultaneously can’t seem to shake and wouldn’t want to. It makes Sundays
like this one a real drag!  Yesterday’s plunder (isn’t “physical” mail
always a treasure?) included the latest issue of Fence magazine, of which I
read the following pieces in the following order: Max Winter’s tempered and
compelling editorial response to the less compelling and unrestrained
polemic of Joan Houlihan’s comments in her recent Boston Comment column; the
wonderful exchange between Alice Notley and Edmund Berrigan; Robert
Paredez’s poems; the reading list/contributor’s notes pages. I didn’t pick
the magazine up again until much later that evening, after my partner, the
poet Sara Veglahn, had perused it’s pages for a while. When I did return to
it, the first thing she said was, “There are 29 men and 14 women in that
issue.” In the interest of full self-disclosure, it was something I hadn’t
noticed, which, perhaps, is representative of much of the problem; if one’s
in the position of –what? privilege? dominance? power? (although not the
statistical “majority”!)—one is granted the luxury of blissful ignorance,
which constitutes a form of passive-sexism. Okay, so I’ve got to check
myself! Sara and I talked a bit about why such a discrepancy exists—do more
men submit to journals?—and decided to look more closely (for me at least)
at some of the current issues of different journals we have in our home.
What follows then is a break-down of gender as best as we could figure out.
Conscious of the myriad issues involved when discussing gender, and those
that arose via our exploration, we based our assumptions—however flawed they
are—on either the pronouns used in contributor’s notes or our understanding
of the relationship between the writer’s first name the gender it signifies.
Of course, this is problematic—what if folks self-identify differently, what
about transgendered individuals, etc??  We did as best as we could and were
often unable to decided. Ultimately we left a column for “unclear”. We also
decided to leave out all of the various translators—hey, this aint a paper
or anything, just two poets trying to figure some things out. Here’s our
rough and flawed breakdown:

Journals with more men than women:

Fence v6 n2: men  29/ women 14
Kiosk 2: men 16/ women 7
New American Writing 21: men 31/ women 17/ unclear 2
Jubilat 7: men 16/ women 6/ unclear 1
Chicago Review v49 n2: men 19/ women 5
Fulcrum 2: around 50 men and 10 women
Colorado Review v30 n3:  men 16/ women 12/ unclear 3

New Review of Literature 1: men 20/ women 11/ unclear 1

American Letters and Commentary 14: men 34/ women 29/ unclear 1
Lungfull 12: men 25/ women 16/ unclear 1
Aufgabe 2: men 27/ women 19
Antennae 5: men 12/ women 5
Baffling Combustions 3 (our now-defunct journal): men 5/ women 4
Best of American Poetry 2002:  men 49/ women 26

Journals with even numbers:

Conjunctions 40
The Ixnay Reader 2003
Columbia 38

Journals with more women than men:

Hanging Loose 83: women 20/ men 15/ unclear 1
Factorial 2: women 16/ men 9
Pom Pom 4: women 23/ men 11/ unclear 1
26  issue B: women 22/ men 17
No 2: women 15/ men 9/ unclear 1


So here is a question to the larger poetry community:

why is this the case?

Nice work, Noah.  We live in a patriarchal society.
Your figures and all figures relating to male/female ratios regarding =
resources and representation reflect that.  The poetry business is very =
patriarchal.  I left Ireland partly for that reason.  I didn't expect =
poetry in the U.S. to be necessarily less patriarchal but I did expect =
(and got) a greater range of poetries.  It's a hard life. We also live in =
a racist society.  But none of this is news.=20

Tony Tost had an interesting post up about this not too long ago at his
blog. Unfortunately it was one of his "disappearing entries." But Reb
Livingston and I both responded. We both cringed at the idea of special
"all-female issues." Lots of people will disagree I'm sure, but I always
wrinkle my nose at that kind of treatment. It often makes sense for to
collect ethnic and foreign language poetries and even regional collections
make some sense (southern poets, for example). Divisions by age groups can
also be interesting (fiction writers under 35, for instance). I think what
Jackie Sheeler did with poetry by and about the police was really cool.

As a woman who happens to be the editor of a journal (as well as one among
several editors at a small press), I think about this a lot. I have to say,
we simply get a lot more submissions from men. I don't know why. And even
though our staff at LIT is primarily female, we often (though not always)
have more men than women in a given issue. I've decided not to worry about
it too much.

Others have remarked on the discrepancy in blogging too.

An natural extension of this observation is to ask myself if I have ever
felt excluded from a journal or reading series or other literary endeavor
because I was a woman, and the answer (or my answer at least) is no.

>>INFO: speculative literature foundation
================================

Speculative Literature Foundation (SLF) -- FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE --
January 2004

We are delighted to announce the official launch of the Speculative
Literature Foundation (www.speculativeliterature.org), with our mission
"to promote literary quality in speculative fiction, by encouraging
promising new writers, assisting established writers, facilitating the
work of quality magazines and small presses in the genre, and developing
a greater public appreciation of speculative fiction."

We hope to accomplish this by creating a free comprehensive resource
website, by developing materials for outreach to schools and libraries,
and by raising funds to redistribute as grants and awards for quality
work by individuals and organizations.

The first award we will present will be the 2003 SLF Fountain Award,
$1000 in prize money for excellence in short fiction.  A select jury
will accept nominations from magazine and anthology editors, and
announce the winner and honorable mentions on June 1st, 2004.  (For more
details, including nomination guidelines, please see our website.)

The foundation is supported by annual membership fees, and we encourage
all those who read, write, and generally appreciate speculative fiction
(by which term we mean to encompass the broad range of fantastic
literature, from hard sf to sword and sorcery to magical realism to
slipstream) to stop by our site, take a look at the resources we offer,
and consider joining as supporting members.  Your membership fees will
go directly towards the ongoing development of grants and awards to
reward literary excellence in the genre; we're also pleased to welcome
new volunteers to our staff.

For more information on what the Foundation offers, please visit our
comprehensive website and take advantage of our extensive (and growing)
set of free resources geared towards the needs of readers, academics,
editors and writers.  Thank you for your time, and again, you can find
us

Mairead: I think "the poetry business is very patriarchal" may be too easy=
=20
an answer (to the extent it can be called a business at all). As Noah=20
suggests, there are variables that are difficult to account for. You ask,=20
for instance, whether men and women submit to journals in roughly the same=
=20
numbers. I can say that overwhelmingly more men submit manuscripts to=20
Junction Press than women (this is not an invitation to submit--I'm not=20
reading anything new for the next two years). Here are a few more things=20
worth checking: correlation of gender of editor to gender content, relative=
=20
numbers broken down into age groups of both editors and poets (i.e. are=20
things changing?), and a check of the more powerful mainstream publications=
=20
(the ones that pay contributors). Also a look at publications from say 20=20
years ago. As a control, an interesting exercise would be to check whether=
=20
the same disparity exists among fiction writers. And there's the question=20
of whether the journals explicitly devoted to women's writing siphon off=20
submissions by poets who would otherwise be published in the journals Noah=
=20
looked at. A complex issue to investigate.

Another fun thing to check would be the comparative numbers of women and=20
men teaching in MFA programs, again broken down by age and genre.

By way of contrast, the gender disparity in my Baja California anthology,=20
Across the Line/Al otro lado (38 men and 14 women), inspired no comment in=
=20
Baja, despite the strongly feminist views of some of the women. When I=20
asked some of the women what they felt about the disparity, universally the=
=20
answer was that fewer women in Baja write poetry. Of the usual complaints=20
about the absence of this or that poet, only three have been mentioned to=20
me (and only one in print), all of them men. My coeditor Harry Polkinhorn=20
and I were very conscious of the issue but were finally limited in our=20
selection by the choices available. In the brief time since the anthology=20
came out a new press run by young women poets has appeared. Not explicitly=
=20
dedicated to women's writing, it has thus far only published women. And an=
=20
explicitly women's only quarterly broadsheet has also started up. Both=20
receive government funding, which is commonplace in Mexico. The writers=20
published so far are very young. It's impossible to predict careers, but at=
=20
least three of them have begun writing very well. All of the older and more=
=20
powerful local publishers, all organs of local, state, or federal=20
government cultural agencies, are run by women, as are the agencies=20
themselves, for the worst possible reason: when the present government came=
=20
to power it promised that 30% of all appointees would be women; it=20
fulfilled that promise by giving women all of the cultural posts and almost=
=20
none of the political, judicial or policy posts.

Dear Mark,

Everything you say supports my bland point: we live in a patriarchal =
society and poetry is a patriarchal business.  Obviously the smaller =
numbers of women publishing is a reflection of smaller numbers of women =
submitting.  I imagine the same thing might be said about jet pilots. =20

No, poetry is not a big business as businesses go.  And yes, fiction, =
being a much newer genre, in English at any rate, is not quite so =
patriarchal. =20

What you say about women's presses etc supports my point regarding my =
reasons for immigrating from Ireland: there is a greater range of poetries =
here.  Hence it is possible to talk about feminist presses or feminist =
magazines in a way it is not possible to talk about in Ireland.=20

So I don't think saying "we live in a patriarchal society and poetry is a =
patriarchal business" is too simple.  It's the bottom line.  I've been =
living with it all my life, as have we all.  Now I'm going to have a slice =
of pizza with my daughters and the various patriarchs and racists within.

It's a tired argument.  Living the life without illusions is more =
invigorating.=20

Mairead: I think "the poetry business is very patriarchal" may be too =
easy=20
an answer (to the extent it can be called a business at all). As Noah=20
suggests, there are variables that are difficult to account for. You =
ask,=20
for instance, whether men and women submit to journals in roughly the =
same=20
numbers. I can say that overwhelmingly more men submit manuscripts to=20
Junction Press than women (this is not an invitation to submit--I'm not=20
reading anything new for the next two years). Here are a few more =
things=20
worth checking: correlation of gender of editor to gender content, =
relative=20
numbers broken down into age groups of both editors and poets (i.e. are=20
things changing?), and a check of the more powerful mainstream publications=
=20
(the ones that pay contributors). Also a look at publications from say =
20=20
years ago. As a control, an interesting exercise would be to check =
whether=20
the same disparity exists among fiction writers. And there's the =
question=20
of whether the journals explicitly devoted to women's writing siphon =
off=20
submissions by poets who would otherwise be published in the journals =
Noah=20
looked at. A complex issue to investigate.

Another fun thing to check would be the comparative numbers of women =
and=20
men teaching in MFA programs, again broken down by age and genre.

By way of contrast, the gender disparity in my Baja California anthology,=
=20
Across the Line/Al otro lado (38 men and 14 women), inspired no comment =
in=20
Baja, despite the strongly feminist views of some of the women. When I=20
asked some of the women what they felt about the disparity, universally =
the=20
answer was that fewer women in Baja write poetry. Of the usual complaints=
=20
about the absence of this or that poet, only three have been mentioned =
to=20
me (and only one in print), all of them men. My coeditor Harry Polkinhorn=
=20
and I were very conscious of the issue but were finally limited in our=20
selection by the choices available. In the brief time since the =
anthology=20
came out a new press run by young women poets has appeared. Not explicitly=
=20
dedicated to women's writing, it has thus far only published women. And =
an=20
explicitly women's only quarterly broadsheet has also started up. Both=20
receive government funding, which is commonplace in Mexico. The writers=20
published so far are very young. It's impossible to predict careers, but =
at=20
least three of them have begun writing very well. All of the older and =
more=20
powerful local publishers, all organs of local, state, or federal=20
government cultural agencies, are run by women, as are the agencies=20
themselves, for the worst possible reason: when the present government =
came=20
to power it promised that 30% of all appointees would be women; it=20
fulfilled that promise by giving women all of the cultural posts and =
almost=20
none of the political, judicial or policy posts.

Well, to be strictly thorough about it, Mairead, you'd have to say
the imbalance is a reflection of at least two factors:

smaller numbers of women submitting AND
reluctance or inability of editors to solicit material from women to
help address the difference.

There may be other factors too.

--Annie, who used to actively solicit women when I edited a journal
and so we usually had a pretty good balance.

Subject:      Agamben's letter to Le Monde
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

Dominique Fourcade sent me Giorgio Agamben's letter to Le Monde immediately after it appeared; several days later the story of Agamben cancelling his NYU class (on Walter Benjamin, in part) was covered in the Times (http://www.nytimes.com/2004/01/17/education/17professor.html).
Here is a translation of the letter, provided by "truthout" (http://www.truthout.org)

**************

Le Monde
(French text at http://www.lemonde.fr/web/article/0,1-0@2-3232,36-348677,0.html)

Saturday 10 January 2004

Giorgio Agamben

  The newspapers leave no doubt: from now on whoever wants to go to
the United States with a visa will be put on file and will have to
leave their fingerprints when they enter the country. Personally, I
have no intention of submitting myself to such procedures and that's
why I didn't wait to cancel the course I was supposed to teach at New
York University in March.

  I would like to explain the reasons for this refusal here, that is,
why, in spite of the sympathy that has connected me to my American
colleagues and their students for many years, I consider that this
decision is at once necessary and without appeal and would hope that
it will be shared by other European intellectuals and teachers.

  It's not only the immediate superficial reaction to a procedure
that has long been imposed on criminals and political defendants. If
it were only that, we would certainly be morally able to share, in
solidarity, the humiliating conditions to which so many human beings
are subjected.

  The essential does not lie there. The problem exceeds the limits of
personal sensitivity and simply concerns the juridical-political
status (it would be simpler, perhaps, to say bio-political) of
citizens of the so-called democratic states where we live.

  There has been an attempt the last few years to convince us to
accept as the humane and normal dimensions of our existence,
practices of control that had always been properly considered
inhumane and exceptional.

  Thus, no one is unaware that the control exercised by the state
through the usage of electronic devices, such as credit cards or cell
phones, has reached previously unimaginable levels.

  All the same, it wouldn't be possible to cross certain thresholds
in the control and manipulation of bodies without entering a new
bio-political era, without going one step further in what Michel
Foucault called the progressive animalization of man which is
established through the most sophisticated techniques.

  Electronic filing of finger and retina prints, subcutaneous
tattooing, as well as other practices of the same type, are elements
that contribute towards defining this threshold. The security reasons
that are invoked to justify these measures should not impress us:
they have nothing to do with it. History teaches us how practices
first reserved for foreigners find themselves applied later to the
rest of the citizenry.

  What is at stake here is nothing less than the new "normal"
bio-political relationship between citizens and the state. This
relation no longer has anything to do with free and active
participation in the public sphere, but concerns the enrolment and
the filing away of the most private and incommunicable aspect of
subjectivity: I mean the body's biological life.

  These technological devices that register and identify naked life
correspond to the media devices that control and manipulate public
speech: between these two extremes of a body without words and words
without a body, the space we once upon a time called politics is ever
more scaled-down and tiny.

  Thus, by applying these techniques and these devices invented for
the dangerous classes to a citizen, or rather to a human being as
such, states, which should constitute the precise space of political
life, have made the person the ideal suspect, to the point that it's
humanity itself that has become the dangerous class.

  Some years ago, I had written that the West's political paradigm
was no longer the city state, but the concentration camp, and that we
had passed from Athens to Auschwitz. It was obviously a philosophical
thesis, and not historic recital, because one could not confuse
phenomena that it is proper, on the contrary, to distinguish.

  I would have liked to suggest that tattooing at Auschwitz
undoubtedly seemed the most normal and economic way to regulate the
enrolment and registration of deported persons into concentration
camps. The bio-political tattooing the United States imposes now to
enter its territory could well be the precursor to what we will be
asked to accept later as the normal identity registration of a good
citizen in the state's gears and mechanisms. That's why we must
oppose it.

Subject:      Discrepancy between the amount of men and women in _The Canary_
In-Reply-To:  <1074456418.400ae762c52e8@mail3.buffalo.edu>

Noah Eli Gordon's question raises a concern that I've
been dealing with for some time.

In his list of journals featuring more men than women,
my own journal, _The Canary_, was listed.

When putting together _The Canary_ my co-editors and I
wondered about this discrepancy, and how to go about
solving it.  I've crunched some numbers below,
unscientifically, to address the actual ratio of women
to men in _The Canary_, by poet, and by number of
pages allotted, and the gender of poets represented
who were solicited versus those who submitted
unsolicited work.

_Canary 2_

17 Women, 33 Men
(Noah figured 34 men, but I believe he is mistaken.)

Number of pages in journal containing poetry: 108
Number of pages containing poetry by women: 45
Number of pages containing poetry by men: 63

Avg. number of pages of poetry alloted to each woman:
2.65

Avg. number of pages of poetry alloted to each man:
1.9

So while, men out number women nearly 2 to 1, women
are represented by proportionally more pages of poetry
per poet.

BUT that doesn't "even" things out.  It occurred to me
that most of the soliciting I've done personally for
the magazine has been of women poets.  Perhaps this is
why, in my unscientific head, I often think that the
gender balance is more even than it actually is--I've
been corresponding mostly with women.   The problem,
here, at least from an editor's point of view, is one
of available work. Men simply seem to be submitting
more.  Further, men are, in my experience, much more
likely to respond favorably to solicitations.

Of the 33 men appearing in Canary #2, 12 were
solicited.  21 came from the slush-pile.
I should note that nearly every man we solicited
responded by sending work.

Of the 17 women appearing in Canary #2, 12 were
solicited. 5 came from the slushpile.  I should also
note that we solicited many more than 12 women, but
only received work from these 12.

So assuming that we're soliciting in more or less
equal numbers, we are left with deciding what to
publish from the unsolicited masses--masses that are
overwhelmingly male.  21 men vs. 5 women.

We just finished editing for #3, and actually spent an
entire day rejecting or kindly asking male poets to
resubmit for a future issue in order to even out the
gender balance.  IN short, we turned away some good
work simply because it was written by men.  In the
meantime, we've been soliciting more women, in the
11th hour, as it were.

I wish more women would submit to the journal.

Best,
Anthony Robinson
Editor, __The Canary__

Mark Weiss's idea of tabulating the gender balance of writers teaching in MFA
programs would be a great project. One might also look closely at the
percentage of tenured men and tenured women, in relation to adjunct men and
adjunct women professors.  As a result of necessary pressures to ethnically
balance what are usually small departments, I'll bet that the male/female
ratio of tenured or tenure-track professors in MFA programs has been rather
ignored, particularly in private colleges and universities.  Three out of four
new tenure-track hires at my college last year were men.  Two out of two
tenure-track hires in my MFA department were men.  Both have or were about to
complete PhDs.  This brings in a whole other variable.  Men with PhDs yet far
fewer published books than at least two out of the six women finalists were
chosen for the two positions. One of the six women finalists had more books
published and more teaching experience, and is more widely known in the
literary world. It appeared that no thought was given to the gender inequity
of this decision.

Gender balance or imbalance, as it were, seems to be lost at this moment,
replaced by the zeitgest of wars, terror, fear, security, the erosion of civil
liberties and social programs, and some sort of weird notion of post-feminism,
which I have never understood.

new MFA hires are listed at AWP; last time I crunched the numbers,
female MFA hires (as Gloria observed w/ PhD hires) seemed to have more
publishing credits / more education than male hires, but the difference
in the number of hires wasn't a substantial difference

EXCEPT THAT at least in my experience, the creative writing classroom is
an almost completely female one -- I rarely have fewer than 75% female
students -- and so my assumption is that there are more female MFAs,
more women  writing poetry, but they're writing less and submitting less

this conversation in the past has also included the question, are the
editors of the journals in question male or female, what is the stated
policy of the journal as far as submissions -- ie, over the transom
submissions read, query first, be a subscriber, solicitation only... --
on WOMPO, through discussion we found that a lot of the journals who are
most inequitable as far as publishing men and women actually have a
stated policy that they read only solicited submissions, but that men
were sending unsolicited ss anyhow, and few women were asked to submit

or that only subscribers were welcome to submit

an additional nuance here is what sort of poetry -- it is well known
that most feminist, women's studies, and etc. journals are closed to
experimental poetry, for example --

Short people have almost no reason to live.  They almost invariably make
less money than their taller peers.  It's like a half million over a
lifetime.  I hope the editors of volumes of poetry also make sure that
short people are included.  It would be a good idea to have poets
measure themselves and those over a certain height would be excluded.
In the history of English literature at least there are so few midgets
that I sometimes burst into tears.  O, Alexander Pope -- we should dig
him up, and clone him to rectify this problem.  I'm not short, but I'm
an advocate for the tiny.  Well, really, I am not as big as some on this
board God help me, what's the average size of a poet on this board
anyhoo?

I could see a whole series published by a university press --

Longer Poems by Shorter Poets.

Please take this overly seriously.  It's a crisis.  Important writers
are almost always very very tall.  Even Charles Olson and Brautigan.
They were huge.  This is what they mean when they say Great Writers.
And women do have a disadvantage because they mature earlier and stop
growing on average four years earlier than men.  So their hands and feet
are tiny, and their stature will never measure up.  The great tall
models are an exception to this rule, and look how easily their lives
go.

This is very upsetting.  Will somebody do something.  Everybody needs to
be exactly the same size.  Whatever happened to equality?  Why are some
people more beautiful than others?  Don't even get me started!  And why
are some poets better than others!  It isn't fair!  We should all write
exactly the same poems!  Why don't we mandate this -- we can make a
template for a poem and anybody who isn't willing to let the state be
Procrustean -- well, let's send them to Siberia and see how well they
write when their hands are frozen solid.  Or no, let's send them to
northern Finland and let them hang around the teeny tiny Sami people and
feel like, like, beanpoles while they try to make a go of it with tiny
potato pies delivered from Stockmann's with that arctic wind whipping
through their ass cracks.  I mean, I have serious envy issues regarding
tall beautiful talented poets and I want them all brought down to the
size of smaller poets and everything levelled, darn it.  I'm having a
real fit here. Please do something.  -- Kirby

They're so easy and natural to look down upon. That accounts for
much of it. They make great Napoleons, however.

This being my last allowed message for the day (and with a huge weight of
other work to do) I'll answer a couple of posts.

Catherine, to add to your nuance, I did a quick online check of the only
two mainstream pubs I could think of offhand that publish significant
amounts of poetry, Poetry Magazine and Shenandoah. Numbers were equal. I
have no idea if this is in any way typical, but it at least suggests one or
more of the following:
1. mainstream mags try harder
2. women poets are more accepted in the mainstream
3. there are a greater number of women poets proportionally in the
mainstream than in whatever you want to call the rest of us.

Mairead:
>Everything you say supports my bland point: we live in a patriarchal
>society and poetry is a patriarchal business. Obviously the smaller
>numbers of women publishing is a reflection of smaller numbers of women
>submitting. I imagine the same thing might be said about jet pilots.

But not about doctors or lawyers, and decreasingly about academics. Jet
pilot is I think more of a special case than these or for that matter
poetry, but I appreciate the verbal sally.

>No, poetry is not a big business as businesses go. And yes, fiction, being
>a much newer genre, in English at any rate, is not quite so patriarchal.

One would imagine that poetry were some kind of small family enterprise
handed down from father to son. It follows than that if it was virtually
all male when Chaucer ran the business it will continue to be so. That
other business, fiction, founded in the more gender egalitarian 17th
century, naturally also continues to be as it was.

We can't even begin to answer the question of why at least a certain group
of magazines tends to publish fewer women if we appeal to an a priori. If
anyone is seriously interested in the question at the very least we need to
know where the problem does and does not exist. A report from the nearest
magazine store selling the nationally-distributed mainstream mags would
certainly help, which lets me off the hook--we don't have any in San Diego.

The same arguments were in the air in 1973-1975, when I was publishing the
three issues of Broadway Boogie. Choices were limited by my ignorance but
also by my taste: I was most interested in the NY branch of The New
American Poetry, and Black Mountain and NY School were boys clubs. But it
was also true then that submissions were overwhelmingly from men. Of the 36
poets in the three issues only 11 were women. The reappearance rate seems
to have been about even.

Anyone interested in the practice of collaborative composition might
like to look in on an experiment in that direction, involving members
of the British & Irish Poets listserv.

You can see the current state of the project via:

    http://soundeye.org/offsets

We've come from a standing start to over sixty contributions in less
than two weeks. The web-site only went online last weekend, and is
still developing. The next major task is to attempt to automate the
update process, which at present is entirely manual.

It is, at least, different from anything else I know that's been
tried (though I'd welcome informed correction on that). It's also fun
to play and, I hope, to read.

All observations, suggestions, kudos and brickbats accepted. Well,
there's no alternative, is there?

Best,

Trevor

BlipSoak01
by Tan Lin

        Atelos is pleased to announce the publication of BlipSoak01 by
Tan Lin (http://www.atelos.org/blip.htm).

About the book:
        Tan Lin's BlipSoak01 sends its reader leaping over the gaps
between left page and right.  The writing challenges the limits of the
line Lin, dexterously running back and forth across facing pages and out
into questions as to why boredom might be vital to an experience of a
text, how sampling shapes poetic style, and why dancing has the power to
"turn the world into a mistake."  This fascination with repetition and
rhythm brings BlipSoak01 alongside emergent genres of electronic music.
This is an explicit theme: the text is organized as if it were a compact
disk EP; its "A SIDE" is called "IDM" (Intelligent Dance Music).  A type
of experimental sound characterized by ambient noise, sampling, highly
layered beats, and the glitches and "blips" of digital techno-culture,
IDM shares with Lin's poetry an ear for mistakes and accidents which
have the potential, if properly sequenced, to draw our attention to the
utmost surface of things.  BlipSoak01 interprets the significance (and
non-significance) of surfaces, "The surface is beautiful because the
surface is always the same.  The surface is beautiful because it can be
forgotten one moment at a time.  The surface is beautiful because it is
lying.  Continual observation of the surface is the most beautiful
forgotten thing in the poem" (from the author's preface).  Lin works
with especial attention to words as objects that we look at; to the end
that his poetry might make the moment of reading the looked-at object of
the text.  In this sense, BlipSoak01 gives the reader a fractured
bit-map to measures of poetry which are-in the best sense of the
word-untimely.


About the author:
        Tan Lin is a writer, artist, and critic.  He is the author of
Lotion Bullwhip Giraffe (Sun and Moon Press) and his art and video work
have been exhibited at the Yale Art Museum, the Sophienholm in
Copenhagen, and the Marianne Boesky Gallery in New York City.  His
writings have appeared in numerous journals, including Conjunctions,
Purple, Black Book, and Cabinet.  He is a professor of English and
creative writing at New Jersey City University.


About the project:
        Atelos was founded in 1995 as a project of the nonprofit
foundation Hip's Road. Atelos is devoted to publishing, under the sign
of poetry, writing which challenges the conventional definitions of
poetry. All the works published as part of the Atelos project are
commissioned specifically for it, and each is involved in some way with
crossing traditional genre boundaries, including, for example, those
that would separate theory from practice, poetry from prose, essay from
drama, the visual image from the verbal, the literary from the
non-literary, and so forth. The Atelos project when complete will
consist of 50 volumes; Blipsoak01 is volume 18. The project directors
and editors are Lyn Hejinian and Travis Ortiz; the editor for cover
production and design is by Ree Katrak; the production assistant is
Colin Dingler.

=A0A Dishonest War
=A0=A0By Edward M. Kennedy
=A0=A0The Washington Post

=A0=A0Sunday 18 January 2004

=A0=A0Of the many issues competing for attention in this new and =
defining=20
year, one is of a unique order of magnitude: President Bush's decision=20=

to go to war in Iraq. The facts demonstrate how dishonest that decision=20=

was. As former Treasury secretary Paul H. O'Neill recently confirmed,=20
the debate over military action began as soon as President Bush took=20
office. Some felt Saddam Hussein could be contained without war. A=20
month after the inauguration, Secretary of State Colin L. Powell said:=20=

"We have kept him contained, kept him in his box." The next day, he=20
said tellingly that Hussein "has not developed any significant=20
capability with respect to weapons of mass destruction."

=A0=A0The events of Sept. 11, 2001, gave advocates of war the opening =
they=20
needed. They tried immediately to tie Hussein to al Qaeda and the=20
terrorist attacks. Secretary of Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld created an=20
Office of Special Plans in the Pentagon to analyze the intelligence for=20=

war and bypass the traditional screening process. Vice President Cheney=20=

relied on intelligence from Iraqi exiles and put pressure on=20
intelligence agencies to produce the desired result.

=A0=A0The war in Afghanistan began in October with overwhelming support =
in=20
Congress and the country. But the focus on Iraq continued behind the=20
scenes, and President Bush went along. In the Rose Garden on Nov. 26,=20
he said: "Afghanistan is still just the beginning."

=A0=A0Three days later, Cheney publicly began to send signals about=20
attacking Iraq. On Nov. 29 he said: "I don't think it takes a genius to=20=

figure out that this guy [Hussein] is clearly . . . a significant=20
potential problem for the region, for the United States, for everybody=20=

with interests in the area." On Dec. 12 he raised the temperature: "If=20=

I were Saddam Hussein, I'd be thinking very carefully about the future,=20=

and I'd be looking very closely to see what happened to the Taliban in=20=

Afghanistan."

=A0=A0Next, Karl Rove, in a rare public stumble, made his own role =
clear,=20
telling the Republican National Committee on Jan. 19, 2002, that the=20
war on terrorism could be used politically. Republicans could "go to=20
the country on this issue," he said.

=A0=A0Ten days later, in his State of the Union address, President Bush=20=

invoked the "axis of evil" -- Iraq, Iran and North Korea -- and we lost=20=

our clear focus on al Qaeda. The address contained 12 paragraphs on=20
Afghanistan and 29 on the war on terrorism, but only one fleeting=20
mention of al Qaeda. It said nothing about the Taliban or Osama bin=20
Laden.

=A0=A0In the following months, although bin Laden was still at large, =
the=20
drumbeat on Iraq gradually drowned out those who felt Hussein was no=20
imminent threat. On Sept. 12 the president told the United Nations:=20
"Iraq likely maintains stockpiles of VX, mustard and other chemical=20
agents and has made several attempts to buy high-strength aluminum=20
tubes used to enrich uranium for a nuclear weapon." He said Iraq could=20=

build a nuclear weapon "within a year" if Hussein obtained such=20
material.

=A0=A0War on Iraq was clearly coming, but why make this statement in=20
September? As White House Chief of Staff Andrew H. Card Jr. said, "=46rom=20=

a marketing point of view, you don't introduce new products in August."=20=

The 2002 election campaigns were then entering the home stretch.=20
Election politics prevailed over foreign policy and national security.=20=

The administration insisted on a vote in Congress to authorize the war=20=

before Congress adjourned for the elections. Why? Because the debate=20
would distract attention from the troubled economy and the failed=20
effort to capture bin Laden. The shift in focus to Iraq could help=20
Republicans and divide Democrats.

=A0=A0The tactic worked. Republicans voted almost unanimously for war =
and=20
kept control of the House in the elections. Democrats were deeply=20
divided and lost their majority in the Senate. The White House could=20
use its control of Congress to get its way on key domestic priorities.

=A0=A0The final step in the march to war was a feint to the United =
Nations.=20
But Cheney, Rumsfeld and Deputy Defense Secretary Paul D. Wolfowitz had=20=

convinced the president that war would be a cakewalk, with or without=20
the United Nations, and that our forces would be welcomed as=20
liberators. In March the war began.

=A0=A0Hussein's brutal regime was not an adequate justification for war,=20=

and the administration did not seriously try to make it one until long=20=

after the war began and all the false justifications began to fall=20
apart. There was no imminent threat. Hussein had no nuclear weapons, no=20=

arsenals of chemical or biological weapons, no connection to Sept. 11=20
and no plausible link to al Qaeda. We never should have gone to war for=20=

ideological reasons driven by politics and based on manipulated=20
intelligence.

=A0=A0Vast resources have been spent on the war that should have been =
spent=20
on priorities at home. Our forces are stretched thin. Precious lives=20
have been lost. The war has made America more hated in the world and=20
made the war on terrorism harder to win. As Homeland Security Secretary=20=

Tom Ridge said in announcing the latest higher alert: "Al Qaeda's=20
continued desire to carry out attacks against our homeland is perhaps=20
greater now than at any point since September 11th."

=A0=A0The most fundamental decision a president ever makes is the =
decision=20
to go to war. President Bush violated the trust that must exist between=20=

government and the people. If Congress and the American people had=20
known the truth, America would never have gone to war in Iraq. No=20
president who does that to our country deserves to be reelected.

Okay, I'll be the someone who asks the next, related, *loaded*
questions--*loaded* that is, to unpack more assumptions than an armadillo's
got armor (isn't Texas lore insufferable?):

So how does one know whether one fits in the "male" or the "female" columns
of quantifiable beings" and shouldn't that matter here?

As well as:

has anyone begun to move the questions via other intricately related,
controversially "quantifiable," constructed categories such as these:

--how many Native Americans do these journals publish?  African-Americans?
Mixed folks?

--how many are upper eschelon college privileged, and how many are
supporting their poetry writing only through working at so-called
"unskilled" jobs like janitor, waitress (oh, sorry: "food server"), "data
entry specialist,"?

These are "mountains of things" (Tracy Chapman), complex, never easily
quantified, though that is one place to begin.

Thanks for sending out such an intriquing question whoever started this.

May I submit the following poem?

What is to be done
and torn apart
what is asunder
breaks, startles, bangs
foretells?

It is doom to foretell.
History is on the block.
The noises resound.
Boys squeal as their kites rise.
The church on the corner is quiet.
There are airplanes and cars,
even stars.
The clouds wander.
The night is still.

Are you there, Wanda Landowska?
What music are you playing toniight?

Christine Murray asks some great questions.

For those of you who would like to read more
perspectives on this issue, check out the Wom-Po
archives.  My post here generated some heat over
there. Thanks to Annie Finch for distributing it
there.

In any case, I'll try to provide some answers to
Christine's questions below:

> So how does one know whether one fits in the "male"
> or the "female" columns of quantifiable beings" and
> shouldn't that matter here?

Good question.  One doesn't always know.  That said, I
try not to assume too much when I'm reading a
submission. Plenty of people submit poems using first
initials.  I don't always know the gender of the poet
I'm reading.  Sometimes I think it's very important,
other times, not so.  I guess what I'm saying is
there's no strict rule, but yeah, it should matter.

> --how many Native Americans do these journals
> publish?  African-Americans?
> Mixed folks?

Ah...one of my favorite questions.  Why?  Because it's
even more difficult to tell.  How, for example, do you
know whether the poem you are reading was written by a
white guy?  a black guy?  a chinese guy? a canadian
woman? and so forth.

You can't always tell--by looking at the name, or the
poem.  I think I'm a good example of this.

What "race/ethicity/sexual orientation" is Anthony
Robinson?  Can you tell from my name?  My poems? The
people I publish in my journal?

Can people tell from my name that I'm a half-mexican,
3/8ths "white" (welsh, irish), one-eight native
american male, age 31, nominally heterosexual?  Does
that make me mixed?  If so, should editors take this
into account?  I knew a lot of MFA kids back in the
day when I used to hang out near an MFA program who
would enter with a name like Tom Smith, and leave the
program named Tomas Garcia-Smith. Joseph would become
Jose, Brandy would become Nalani, and so forth. That's
an interesting move--motivated by...?  I've actually
spoken to some poets who are very clear about their
motivation for doing this--re-christening oneself with
an "ethnic" or at least "less-white" name may increase
one's chances of getting published.  I don't know if
this is true or not. I haven't tried it.


I want to represent a diverse group of writers in the
pages of _The Canary_. On the other hand, I don't
apply a magnifying glass to every submission in an
attempt to figure out "who" this poet is.  The work is
the primary criteria for selection.  That said, I
can't help but to be aware of such things as the ratio
of male to female poets published in my magazine, or
any other.  It's built into the language--most of us
can "tell" whether most writers are male or female by
their given names. Can you tell race, ethnicity,
sexual orientation, by name?  Far less frequently.

What it came down to for us (Nick and Josh and
I--Canary Editors) was realizing that we had been
perhaps exercising a male bias in our editing
procedure.  It was, as far as I know, unconscious, and
conditioned at least as much by the sheer number of
submissions by men, as by our inherent maleness.

That said, in trying the equalize the gender balance,
we are not in any way "throwing a bone" to women
poets, or trying to patronize them.  I simply
recognize that there are a ton of interesting women
poets out there writing amazing poems--most of my
favorite contemporary poets ARE women.  Most of the
people I have solicited have been women.  Problem is,
women haven't submitted or responded to solicitations
with the same frequency as men.  I don't think it's a
bad thing to reject a perfectly good poem by a man to
make room for an equally good poem by a woman--esp.
when about 70% of what we read is written by men.  I
KNOW THERE'S GOOD POETRY OUT THERE.  I think it's one
of my responsibilities as an editor to make decisions
like this--if women aren't submitting as frequently as
men, I have no problem with asking more women for
poems.  Or waiting for more to come over the transom.

More former than latter, I'm sure. But that's built
into po-biz, isn't it?  Go to school, get MFA, submit
poems...blah blah blah.  Of course, there are plenty
of relatively non-privileged folks who make it to
college and beyond, and then "enter" the upper echelon
as well, no?

Thanks for continuing this discussion.

Tinfish 13 had something on the order of 13 women and 16 men, including
a collaboration.  Actually, the collaboration was a second appearance;
as we screwed the first one up so mightily, we tried again.  Which
makes 13 women and 15 men.

Anyone interested in the issue of women and men in journals should look
at the first issue of Chain, where the imbalance was discussed at
length, and well.  It's a real problem, and in order to maintain good
balance, you have to ask women for work, usually.  At least at first.

When I started Tinfish I was deluged with work by men, some of which
had been published elsewhere (I found out later).  I couldn't get women
to give me much of anything.

The same imbalance is true, by the way, when I consider local (usually
non-white writers in Hawai`i) writers and nonlocal ones.  Local
writers, who come from a culture that does not value self-promotion,
submit less, and need to be solicited.  Strange language, I know.
Outside writers are much more willing to put themselves forward.

Of our new chapbooks, 3 are by women and two by men (including Ho Chi
Minh, who is defunct).

By the way, I just picked up my own _No Guns, No Durian_.  Once I get
the screws, it'll be ready to ship.

aloha, Susan

One day in the Life of Alan S.=20

(in his home in non-U.S.A Paradise)

Alan waited an eternity; today, no one came to bring him his breakfast.  =
He was used to breakfast at the same time every day; nothing fancy, but =
certainly timely.  He preferred simple foods served in simple styles, =
but he liked having it every day...whole wheat toast and black raspberry =
jam, one egg poached, coffee, no cream, no sugar, and a small glass of =
juice, preferably orange sans pips.=20

But this morning there was nothing. =20

Alan waited.  He rose hungry.  Waited, dressed, descended to the =
kitchen. =20

No one was there.  No mother, no house sitter, no aides, just an empty =
room filled with miles of white walls and white tile floors that seemed =
to stretch to an elongated, nearly sexual elasticity into the next =
century. =20

Alan groped through the cupboard drawers and the cabinet tops searching =
for...he wasn't sure exactly. =20

"How does she do that daily,"  he wondered.  "Where are all these things =
she puts together to make those breakfasts?"  He was confused; he was =
totally helpless; he was hungry. =20

The noise shattered his na=EFve, self-centered thoughts and angered him; =
who were these people with their explosions?  He moved to the doorway =
looking for his mother, wondering what was keeping her from attending =
his morning rituals. =20

Sirens wailed; lights flashed; children screamed, dogs hid under porches =
and his cat was no where in sight. =20

"Where the hell is everybody," he shouted to himself?    And he walk to =
the front window to see what was causing the confusion in his daily =
routine.=20

She was there, on the front lawn, her small frame wrapped in her clean =
white terrycloth robe now drenched in the blood from her belly where the =
shrapnel had lacerated deep into her visceral sections and ruptured the =
Iliac artery causing her to have bled to death in just under 4 minutes.=20

Next to her red-lapped robe lay the remains of Irene; she had been on =
her way to the mall intending to explode her arsenal at noon in the food =
court; something had gone wrong and the explosives detonated too soon.  =
Instead of killing hoards of her enemies, Irene slew only herself, =
Alan's mother, and a small tabby cat he had loved. =20

But they all died well, not having had an empire to control their =
behaviors, so all is indeed well that ends well...=20

Dear Noah,

On reading your recent tallying of the sex breakdown in literary magazines, and
noticing that Fence was at the top of a list of magazines said to be indicators of a
discrepancy between the number of women vs. men published, I was moved to do a bit
of research and found that, at least as far as Fence is concerned, the observation
doesn’t hold much weight. By and large, the numbers I came up with, issue for issue,
were too close to be indicative of anything, especially given that the magazine’s
book imprint has printed, to date, 7 books by women and 3 by men, and that the
magazine even sponsors a book contest (the Alberta prize) solely for women. Come on,
now. What you're really talking about is a matter of female *presence* in literary
magazines, a far more subtle and un-quantifiable concept. Rather than counting the
number of poets, why not count the number of pages those poets' work takes up? But
then the question arises: why do so much counting? And why place Fence at the top of
the list? Especially when it doesn’t seem that you, or Sara Veglahn for that matter,
even read the magazine very thoroughly, by your own admission. I don’t mean to seem
shrill--but the reasoning you’re using doesn’t seem entirely seaworthy. Am I wrong?

Max Winter

PS--I’m glad you liked the introduction.

I wonder if, since I believe the number of small press books of poetry
published by women and by men is somewhat similar, women go to book more
quickly?

With the page count thing:  are women writing longer poems?

B/W Gloria:  in academic journals, many female academics seem to display
more anxiety about qualifications than their male colleagues.  Are the
qualifications qualifications?  I know that in technology, I had more
anxiety about my qualifications, more difficulty proving my
qualifications / they were more readily called into question than those
of my male peers.  I have less hubris?  Frustrate expectation?  Am too
short?

There is also research that more attractive people of both sexes are
more successful in general -- a sort of physical embodiment of accepted
standards?  Are successful poets tall like Anne Waldman and Maureen Owen
and Charles Olson?  Or, what about all those boys in Armani suits with
big titles?

I wonder that female-edited publications and presses tend to publish
more gender-balanced lists / issues, when there is some research that
indicates professional and upper management women (as opposed to, I
guess, artists, academics, etc.) aren't particularly woman-friendly
employers / managers.

But I burned out in technology, and teaching, even at the college level,
is far more equitable.  It was odd to be working as the manager of the
SONY data center by day and teaching at LA Southwest (the CC founded
after the Watts riots) after work, going from a fairly diversified
environment (data center:  dull swing shift jobs -- lots of minorities
and some women -- outside ops, all white men) to a campus where the only
white women were the English teachers.

"Women's poetry" is quite different from poetry written by women, just
as there are all sorts of people who are not writing hyphenated verse.
But Sojourner and Calyx are not correctives (for The Sewanee Review, The
Hudson Review, The New Criterion...).

While issues of publication are nominally related to credentials and teaching
college, after all this interesting discussion, I think we might now separate
them.  I am much less concerned with the publication of poetry and parity,
since, as several people have already expressed, poetry magazines and presses
are mostly small operations edited by people who have distinct aesthetic
tastes, and most women don't want to be published just because they're women,
nor do they want to be termed "women poets" or be branded by any other
ghettoizing nomenclature.
I even have a problem with Women Studies, because it's a handy
institutionalized way of channeling women, some with degrees, such as Angela
Davis, in philosophy, anthropology, sociology, etc.  I know plenty of women
who hold joint appointments in Women's Studies and another dept., before
they're actually tenured.  I'm not sure this is by choice.

But back to the issue of men going for both MFAs and PhDs--this is becoming a
small epidemic.  As the competition for jobs heightens, the younger men seem
(conveniently, all the ones I know who did this were/are married) to
understand that a PhD in English will not only insure a creative writing
tenure track job, but also a possible position in an English Dept.  So it's
aggressive career thinking on their part, isn't it?  Not every writer is
suited for PhD study.  In fact, it's sort of a kiss of death, because a poet
who does doctoral work often has to sacrifice art for many years in order to
traffic in the language of academia.  Then one has to find a suitable tenure
track position.  Then one has to work several years in order to get tenure.
 All these years detract from productive art making, for the most part.  And
frankly, why do artists, and I mean poets and writers, need PhDs anyway?  It
is entirely possible to teach literature from the perspective of a working
writer, and perhaps more useful to students who intend on writing, and not
becoming professional readers.

Just for the record, Maureen Owen isn't very much taller than you, Catherine.
And in the literary world, looks can actually work against a woman--she may
not be taken as seriously if she is too attractive.

Someone, in a previous email, noted that aggressivity is the key to
functioning in a competitive atmosphere, especially one in which the spoils
are so small and the politics so nasty.  I wouldn't agree with a single thing
Henry Kissinger ever said except this:  when asked by an interviewer how he
felt about going back to academia after all those years as a powerful policy
maker, he replied:  "Ach, it's terrible, and the politics are much vorse!"

My nerves are going again reading this thread.

When you think of the amazing sports champions -- people like Muhammad Ali, or great
basketball players like Michael Jordan -- you're talking about folks who worked ten hour
days for twenty years to get to the level they're at.

Have you listened to Ginger Baker play drums in the early Cream records?  Try Sunshine
of Your Love, for instance, and note his incredibly precise snare drums -- somebody
pointed out to me he's playing a reversal of the usual snare drums -- generally the
backbeat snare is on the 2nd and 4th but he's hitting the first and third -- and hitting
very precise 1/16ths notes with the bass drums as he doubles the beat at the end.  It's
amazingly subtle and precise and brilliant.  Now if any of us tried to do that -- even
if they had 20 years to practice -- well, speaking for myself it's just not in me.  I
know I couldn't do that, or play Clapton's guitar, or even sing at Clapton's level.

It's not in me no matter how hard I might work.

Someone like Marianne Moore had an almost monstrous dedication to her art.  She would
work for six months on a poem -- reading hundreds of books and clearing out her entire
life to work on her poems.  She had only 100 poems that she thought were good at the end
of her life.

Corso devoted every minute of every waking day to his art as a young man.  A monstrous
work ethic.  Even in his thirties he would disappear for six months and do nothing else
but work on poems.

Rimbaud had this same monstrous work ethic.  He learned languages in the desert, and
could work at a dictionary for 14 hour days.  The man had a fantastic focus and
concentration.

I know I could never be a Michael Jordan.  His talent is way beyond whatever level I
could ever have attained.

Plus, this wasn't in me.

When I read these crybaby scribbles I just laugh and realize that nobody much has a work
ethic any more.  You have to burn the entire rest of your life if you want to be great
at something.  Look at Olympic athletes -- they have no personal life, they do nothing
but work at their sport -- ten to fifteen years.  And when they do what they do, they
can dazzle us, and we marvel.

Twenty minutes a day on poetry isn't going to get anybody anywhere that's going to amaze
anybody.

If you work at poetry -- and you have talent at it -- even if you are quite short --
then you must work at it all day and devote your life to it.  If you do this in a
half-assed way and clog your life with other things, what you write is not going to
matter.  To work for twenty minutes a day and then spend 16 hours wondering why nobody
is reading, or planning a national mandate so that you are not only read, but people are
forced to read and buy your work, then you should be apprised of the reality.  Even if
you can make everybody read your work, it won't matter.

Richard Brautigan would disappear for years to work on his art.  Charles Olson spent
decades holed up and working on his poetry.  Emily Dickinson did, too.  I'm sure that
Amiri Bakara and Gwendolyn Brooks did, too.  Ginsberg did early on, but then he became a
popular figure, and his poetry became a sad stupid reminder of his earlier work.

Let's think about work ethic.  That's the way to get ahead in this country.  All the
whining is a waste of effort that could go into the poem.

I'm not much of a poet -- I used to work hard at it but I have too many things going on
now.  I want to write maybe another book or two of criticism, and I like to play with
poetry, but  I don't expect to overtake Charles Olson or Gregory Corso at this rate.

Please let's just try to be realistic.  Now get to work and shut up.  If you work for
twenty years at ten hours a day, and you have talent, and still you are not published,
then you can come whining.  Part of a poet's genius is clearing out their life.  If you
can't even manage that, then forget about it.  I can't, but you don't hear me whining.

Lyn Hejinian asked me to forward the following publication announcement
to the list:



Devotional Cinema
by Nathaniel Dorsky

        Tuumba Press announces the publication on December 31, 2003 of
Devotional Cinema, by Nathaniel Dorsky


About the book:=20
Kathleen Tyner (author of Literacy in A Digital World), writes of this
book as follows: =93Devotional Cinema, reprised from filmmaker Nathaniel
Dorksy=92s lecture on religion and cinema at Princeton University, is a
rare treasure of penetrating insight into the language of film. In a
compelling style, somewhere between a Zen koan and a Victorian love
story, Devotional Cinema makes the case for mindful viewing as a
transcendent experience. In the process, Dorsky reflects upon the role
of filmmaking in faith, prayer, pleasure, and the renewal of the human
spirit. For Dorsky, the material nature of film illuminates a path to
devotion. Devotional Cinema is a guide for makers and viewers who, like
Dorsky, seek the =91elemental glory=92 of film.=94

In this perspicacious text, Nathaniel Dorsky discusses the conjunction
of religion and film from the vantage of a devotee. The crux of his
discussion is a nuanced understanding of =93devotion=94 not as an =
experience
specific to religion but rather as =93the opening or the interruption =
that
allows us to experience what is hidden and accept with our hearts our
given situation.=94=20

Moving through meditations on image-moments in works by certain key
filmmakers (Carl Theodor Dreyer, Yasujiro Ozu, Michelangelo Antonioni,
and Roberto Rossellini), Dorsky arrives at the heart of what constitutes
a devotional practice. It is metaphysical and technical; this lovely
little masterpiece is about the medium of experience, the projection of
devotion, the making of art.


About the author:=20
        Long a figure of interest to many contemporary American poets,
Nathaniel Dorsky has been making and exhibiting avant-garde films since
1964. He now lives in San Francisco where he makes a living as a film
editor. His works have been shown internationally and are in the
permanent collections of the Museum of Modern Art (New York), the
Pacific Film Archive (Berkeley), Image Forum (Tokyo), Les Archives du
film exp=E9rimental d=92Avignon, and Le Centre Pompidou (Paris) as well =
as
many universities. Among his better known works are Summerwind (1965),
Hours for Jerome (1966-70, 1982), Pneuma, Alaya (1976-87), Variations
(1992-98), Arbor Vitae (2000) and The Visitation (2002).


About the press:
        Tuumba Press was founded by Lyn Hejinian in 1976, and between
then and 1984 Hejinian produced 50 handset letterpress chapbooks. Tuumba
was revived in 1999 to publish (in conjunction with Leslie Scalapino=92s =
O
Books) Uxudo, by Anne Tardos. A second major publication, Red Car Goes
By: Selected Poems of  Jack Collom, followed, and since then Orchid
Jetsam (by Leslie Scalapino, writing under the name Dee Goda) and Slowly
(by Lyn Hejinian) have been published by Tuumba in its current
incarnation. Lyn Hejinian remains the editor; the artistic director is
Ree Katrak; Colin Dingler serves as editorial and production assistant.

Certainly he's a good drummer in the context of early rock music, but
reversing the accent in 4/4 is something any good jazz drummer can do.
If your looking for drumming skill which is mind boggling, tala cycles
in tabla hand drumming uses mathematical sequences, sometimes adding up
to dozens of beats to keep in mind.  An interesting example is one in
10 1/2 beats, divided 1 1/2 + 1 1/2 + 1 1/2 + 1 1/2 + 1 1/2 + 1 1/2 + 1
1/2.  Here's a basic web page about talas which describes how they are
composed.  Each beat also has an accompanying vocalization.

Excellent, Kirby, although it's a bit more complex than just writing poems.
The richness of a poem comes from the richness of the poet's life. Maybe
walking city streets, or backpacking, or from one's spiritual life, or love
life. And research too, lots of reading, looking, listening, arguing,
attending to others too, is all part of a poet's work. It's a full day,
everyday of one's life.

Best,
Joel

Hi Max,

Thanks for responding. A few things first: I DO read most of the lit
magazines I get thoroughly, Fence included. The reason I’d mentioned my
initial engagement, the first few things in the magazine I’d read, was to
show the difference in how Sara and I approached the issue. Ultimately, it
was to admit that as a man ( or as the particular “man” that I am) I hadn’t
noticed what really stuck out to Sara. The list of journals wasn’t meant to
be arranged via any sort of hierarchy. Yours was on top because it was the
one that prompted Sara and I to take a closer look at the discrepancy. As
far as why one might be prompted to “do so much counting”, I’d say it’s
because this still remains an issue, one which isn’t resolved/explored etc.
by blaming the patriarchal nature of our culture, by creating an
other/outsider/ghettoized safe-zone, by looking at the length of pages
rather than the number of individuals etc. I’m interested in exploring this
issue further and I wonder if you’d comment on any visible discrepancies on
the number of submissions you receive as far as gender is concerned…


yrs,
Noah

Only by everlastingly keeping their noses to their ghrinestones.

__(from "Kindly Unhitch That Star, Buddy" by Ogden Nash)


In fact, Rilke didn't write poetry for almost ten years, then
suddenly wrote Dueno Elegies and immediately after, in 3 days, the
entire Sonnets to Orpheus.  Valery abandoned poetry for 20 years,
starting at age 21, then wrote his most famous poem.  Of course, they
weren't Americans.  Maybe you happen to have insider info. that the
U.S. muses are more respectful of the work ethic; after all as you
say, "that's the way to get ahead in this country."

Re your gist:  it's commonly known that in virtually every field
women need to work harder and better to earn respect and recognition
equivalent to that of men. No amount of name-calling of
bleeding-heart liberals!" will make poetry an exception to this rule
until our culture finishes going through its post-patriarchal birth
canal.

I wouldn't say this is true. I would say more respect and recognition is
given to men.

I want to reply to this, but it is hard to tell now
who wrote which part of the below--plus I am going to
clip and comment which will make it further confusing.

> > Tony, what you say here is originally what got me
> so suspicious of the

I take hard issue with the idea that any publishing
houses--commercial or small press or anyone else--is
going out of their way to promote any specific kind of
diversity, except maybe those houses who are doing it
as part of their specific specific mission.

From personal experience my own writing has often been
characterized to me in typical ways: houses that do
work to promote cultural diversity have told me its
too "odd" or "experimental" or "avant-garde"--houses
that do innovative work have said to me "too
narrative," "too lyrical," blah blah. So we're all of
us--who fit into this place--making our own space and
our own audience. Harryette Mullen talks about this in
an interesting way in her interview with Daniel Kane
in the new T&W book.

And as far as MFA programs or anyone in higher
education doing *too much* to promote diversity I take
hard hard issue with that too. I have always been one
of one or two or three non Europeans in any given
graduate class I ever have been in.

I went to graduate school in New York City and there
something like four of us in an MFA program of nearly
30.

Motivated by what? Why are you compelled to fill in
the blank here? If Brandy felt herself become Nalani
then so be it. But to base an assumption that people
are doing this on anecdotes you have heard or folks
you have talked to is not proof of anything.

it is interesting that you juxtapose these two
anecdotes. That her faking her ethnic background was
the same as faking her dance background.

I can't answer the faking her ethnic background part,
(except that once again you seem to take a single
anecdote as somehow being evidence of phenomenon) but
as a dancer I will say "a couple of years in the Idaho
ballet" is NOT "almost most dance background." A
couple of years in any professional dance company
whether Idaho or Moscow is a professional dance career
is. You train your life, you dance on stage for
several years (for ballet--for modern dance,
obviously, the career can be and often is much much
longer) and then you retire and teach.

> >  Almost

How untrue. But more than that, what motivates you to
say something like this?

> >

Why do you believe he has done this specifically to
get published? If he really is crazy (your words) then
why do you want to use him as an example?

 I

How can you assume this?

What preferential treatment? A couple of free
cocktails at the bar? A titillating story to tell
decades later about Allen Ginsburg?


> >

> from childhood.

Who is a "real" gay person? Gay people--queer
people--can and do "realize" this aspect of themselves
all throughout their lives. It is so reductive to
simply qualify a whole experience is a short pithy
swipe.

Kirby, (I'm guessing it is Kirby?) it is not fair to
write these broad assumptions based on strange stories
you have been told or things you have heard from
people. This is like the time you wrote to kari
edwards that you thought all transgendered people were
happy and had no problems because you saw the movie
"To Wong Foo, Thanks For Everything" or some other
movie about drag queens which I thought was a really
weird comment but I can never tell if you are serious
when you say things like this.


Sorry for being testy. Must come from eight hours at
the academy try to act *less* "gay".

Some of this seems silly, to me, Kirby, but I DO admire and=20
like your posts stirring up the fun here.  Sincerely.

(1)When I, myself, think of Ali or Jordan, I think of extraordinarily
 physically gifted athletes and athletic performance.  When I think=20
of Ali, I think of a fellow who achieved "greatness" early as well as=20
late, before he'd put twenty years into his "art," and after, also. =20
When I think of Jordan, I think of the incredible physical ability=20
(jump, twist, spatial awareness, etc.) and Yes, much practice, as=20
the Jordan who became one of basketball's all-time greats did=20
mature a little later than some.  I think then that perseverance and=20
drive can be substituted for "work ethic," and I think everybody=20
can keep hopeful.
(2)When I think of a Ginger Baker, again I think of "performance,"=20
and as with basketball, I see a distinction between performance=20
(which can derive from repetition of physical movements) and=20
writing (which can flow out of anyone 20 or 80).
(3)When I think of Corso AND Rimbaud, I think of young=20
writers who "made it" fairly young, so I don't see the 20 years=20
of work ethic, necessarily.
(4)When I think of any writers, I think also of the social nature=20
of writing, such that "greatness" is also determined by the taste=20
and desire and maybe even the money, of readers and patrons=20
and critics and cultures and sociopolitical systems.
(5)When I think of Corso and the/an idea of "greatness," I also=20
think that some reject such a pursuit -- the pursuit of "greatness." =20
Also, as another poster observed, "great poetry" may just as=20
readily come from a writer who has lived a rich and varied life=20
as from a writer who practices profusely and markets self=20
aggressively and successfully.  I know it may to some sound=20
like heresy, but I reject a lot Corso's who do not seem, to me,=20
to have developed enough richness of psyche and intellect to=20
have rejected lifestyles emotionally immature and self-destructive. =20
Yeah, it's the "aesthetic" that counts, but darn, there are so many=20
good writers/thinkers/poets to read in a lifetime; for me, Corso=20
doesn't make my A or B lists.
(6) I don't expect to overtake Corso, either.  His was an age=20
when "young males" were still the rage of Literature.  Another=20
poster mentioned Rilke and Valery, and I find that notion, that=20
some of their greatest writing came, suddenly, from inspiration=20
after years of neglected "practice" just as realistic.
(7)Again, the "Greatness" thing is a bother, too.  What difference=20
does it all make, anyhow?  It's not like anybody is writing the=20
cure to cancer or even to existential despair or societal malaise,=20
though if somebody does produce the latter, fabulous!
(8)In place of "Greatness," I would be equally happy to substitute=20
connection with other writers and the collective contribution to a=20
collective consciousness and the process of expanding same.  I=20
know that sounds pretty hokey...

A coupla cents,
And for all who have emotional energy invested in the caucuses=20
this evening, Best of Luck to your candidates
and let's all give each other credit for caring plenty enough; there's=20
a lot of energy developing in getting rid of Bush, and that's darn cool! =

When you think of the amazing sports champions -- people like Muhammad =

about folks who worked ten hour days for twenty years to get to the =
level they're at.=20
Have you listened to Ginger Baker play drums in the early Cream records? =
Try Sunshine of Your Love, for instance, and note his incredibly precise =
snare drums -- somebody pointed out to me he's playing a reversal of the =
usual snare drums -- generally the backbeat snare is on the 2nd and 4th =
but he's hitting the first and third -- and hitting very precise 1/16ths =
notes with the bass drums as he doubles the beat at the end. It's =
amazingly subtle and precise and brilliant. Now if any of us tried to do =
that -- even if they had 20 years to practice -- well, speaking for =
myself it's just not in me. I know I couldn't do that, or play Clapton's =
guitar, or even sing at Clapton's level.=20
It's not in me no matter how hard I might work.=20
Someone like Marianne Moore had an almost monstrous dedication to her =
art. She would work for six months on a poem -- reading hundreds of =
books and clearing out her entire life to work on her poems. She had =
only 100 poems that she thought were good at the end of her life.=20
Corso devoted every minute of every waking day to his art as a young =
man. A monstrous work ethic. Even in his thirties he would disappear for =
six months and do nothing else but work on poems.=20
Rimbaud had this same monstrous work ethic. He learned languages in the =
desert, and could work at a dictionary for 14 hour days. The man had a =
fantastic focus and concentration.=20
I know I could never be a Michael Jordan. His talent is way beyond =
whatever level I could ever have attained.=20
Plus, this wasn't in me.=20
When I read these crybaby scribbles I just laugh and realize that nobody =
much has a work ethic any more. You have to burn the entire rest of your =
life if you want to be great at something. Look at Olympic athletes -- =
they have no personal life, they do nothing but work at their sport -- =
ten to fifteen years. And when they do what they do, they can dazzle us, =
and we marvel.=20
Twenty minutes a day on poetry isn't going to get anybody anywhere =
that's going to amaze anybody.=20
If you work at poetry -- and you have talent at it -- even if you are =
quite short -- then you must work at it all day and devote your life to =
it. If you do this in a half-assed way and clog your life with other =
things, what you write is not going to matter. To work for twenty =
minutes a day and then spend 16 hours wondering why nobody is reading, =
or planning a national mandate so that you are not only read, but people =
are forced to read and buy your work, then you should be apprised of the =
reality. Even if you can make everybody read your work, it won't matter. =

Richard Brautigan would disappear for years to work on his art. Charles =
Olson spent decades holed up and working on his poetry. Emily Dickinson =
did, too. I'm sure that Amiri Bakara and Gwendolyn Brooks did, too. =
Ginsberg did early on, but then he became a popular figure, and his =
poetry became a sad stupid reminder of his earlier work.=20
Let's think about work ethic. That's the way to get ahead in this =
country. All the whining is a waste of effort that could go into the =
poem.=20
I'm not much of a poet -- I used to work hard at it but I have too many =
things going on now. I want to write maybe another book or two of =
criticism, and I like to play with poetry, but I don't expect to =
overtake Charles Olson or Gregory Corso at this rate.=20
Please let's just try to be realistic. Now get to work and shut up. If =
you work for twenty years at ten hours a day, and you have talent, and =
still you are not published, then you can come whining. Part of a poet's =
genius is clearing out their life. If you can't even manage that, then =
forget about it. I can't, but you don't hear me whining.>>=20

Ex-pimps, Hustlers, Drug kingpins, at San Francisco Tenderloin Book Fair

Ex-pims, Hustlers, Drug kingpin, at Tenderloin Book Fair


The upcoming San Francisco Tenderloin Book Fair is being described as
the "olympics of black radical poetry and literature," with over fifity
official writers participating and nearly the same amount scheduled for
open mike poetry and speak outs. More than 15 poets from Los Angeles
will perform in the open mike section. They are "conscious" poets on a
mission to unite with their elders in the Black Arts Movement, such as
Amiri Baraka, Sonia Sanchez, Askia Toure and Marvin X, event organizer.
The Nation of Islam's international representative, Akbar Muhammad, will
also attend, along with legendary professor Dr. Acklyn Lynch and author
Sam Greenlee who wrote The Spook Who Sat By The Door. Drs. Nathan and
Julia Hare will participate, along with San Francisco's first poet
laureate, Devorah Major, and MacArthur genius award winner Ishmael Reed.

But the most controversial authors include ex-pimp Fillmore Slim,
ex-hustler and godfather of Hunters Point, a San Francisco ghetto,
Charlie Walker, and one of Oakland's former drug kingpins, Mickey Moore,
now a minister. They will speak to youth on the consequences of "the
game."

The event takes place Friday and Saturday, January 30-31, at Marvin X's
Recovery Theatre, located in downtown San Francisco in the multi-racial
ghetto called the Tenderloin, 133 Golden Gate Ave., between Leavenworth
and Jones. He is calling for the establishment of the University of
Poetry to continue the cultural revolution the Black Arts Movement began
in the 60s. "We are passing the baton to the hip hop generation," he
said.

"And we are bringing together all elements of our community to discuss
family problems."
The book fair is free but registration for the University of Poetry is
$20.00 for both days, which includes a Friday dinner, workshops, panels
and spoken word concerts.
The theatre only seats 250, so pre-registration tickets are available at
Reggae Runnins, 505 Divisadero, San Francisco, Da Corner, Fillmore and
Hayes, also Da Corner, Third and LaSalle, Hunters Point, and Aquarius
Rising, 60th and Telegraph, Oakland. Or send a check or money order to
Recovery Theatre, 133 Golden Gate Ave., San Francisco, CA 94102. Call
510-798-9155 for more information or visit http://www.recoverytheare.org
.

Event sponsors include Theatre St. Boniface, Black Bird Press, Vanguard
Public Foundation, Before Columbus Foundation, East Bay Church of
Religious Science, Huey P. Newton Foundation, It's About Time, BSU at
San Francisco State University, BSU at Contra Costa College.

In response to Kazim's response to Kirby's
centaur-like cobbling-together of both of our words
(mine and Kirby's), I feel compelled to respond.

With the exception of one passage, everything Kazim
quoted was Kirby's. My passage is below, though, and I
feel that I must comment and clarify.

Tony's comment:

>I knew a lot of MFA kids back in the
>day when I used to hang out near an MFA
>program whowould enter with a name like Tom Smith,
>and leave the program named Tomas Garcia-Smith.
>Joseph would become Jose, Brandy would become
>Nalani, and so forth.
>That's an interesting move--motivated by...?
++++++++++

In context, I was responding to someone's question
concerning how an editor can *tell* what race or
ethnicity a writer is.  My response was a) I can't.
As a "mixed" writer myself, (and someone who doesn't
*look* white), I'm interested in this.  At the same
time, my very anglo name probably means that lots of
folks asssume I'm "white," whatever that means. My
point was, I feel no need to change my name because
I'm not particularly concerned what ethnicity people
think I am.  For OTHER PEOPLE, though, this is a
concern.  Some folks don't realize that until they
enter and environment (MFA for example) in which race
and ethnicity and other aspects of identity politics
are foregrounded daily.  The people in the specific
program I mentioned were encouraged to change their
names, if not to garner more publication, to identify
themselves more strongly with their ethnic heritage.
I'm not passing judgment, just noting something that
has occurred, and continues to occur. I think it's
also important to remember that this is a choice.

Kazim wrote:
> Motivated by what? Why are you compelled to fill in
> the blank here?

The question mark, the "blank," isn't filled in
because I sincerely don't know what individually
motivates individuals.

I don't feel like I'm "proving" anything--only
offering up items for discussion.

Finally, I am not Kirby Olson. I respect Kirby and
have had many fruitful exchanges with him about poetry
and life. However, I don't concur with the majority of
his post, and I hope his excerpting of my comments
doesn't imply that I do.

Best,
AR

The world according to Kirby.

"Many many people who claim to be gay are not, or are so only in order to
get preferential treatment.
>>
A real gay person is oriented toward the same sex from childhood.  If you
suddenly realize you are gay at 25 when it seems that you can get a job and
be taken seriously if you are gay, you are probably not really gay.  You are
just an opportunist."

Ah, you're quite a button pusher- a real peach. Oh, & full of shit.

Who's next? When will you be beginning the hunt for those "opportunist" gay
folks that pass as straight to avoid being fired, or beaten or killed.
Because that's most of the world, not your university nook.

It's obvious you're tuned into the gay community, since you know the
absolute window that others are allowed to discover their sexual
orientation. You should spread your knowledge. People coming out later in
life need to be exposed as the fakers they are.

And I'm sure you've interviewed your "out" former colleagues, asking them if
they'd ever had same-sex attractions during childhood. You're a thorough,
thoughtful guy, so I couldn't imagine it any other way.

Yes Kirby, you are the new model of the left. Thanks for showing us the way.
Left like Ernst Rohm.

Thank you, Anthony Robinson, for responding in depth to the questions I was
asking on the list yesterday.

It is this part of the dialogue in your post that catches my interest for
now:

--[Anthony quoting one of chris's questions]:
how many are upper eschelon college privileged,
> and how many are
> supporting their poetry writing only through working
> at so-called
> "unskilled" jobs like janitor, waitress (oh, sorry:
> "food server"), "data
> entry specialist,"?

--[Anthony responding to the question]:
More former than latter, I'm sure. But that's built
into po-biz, isn't it?  Go to school, get MFA, submit
poems...blah blah blah.  Of course, there are plenty
of relatively non-privileged folks who make it to
college and beyond, and then "enter" the upper echelon
as well, no?

I think that this assumption of an academicizing of "po biz" is completely
accurate.  And that this cultural (cultural seems such a safe term, but is
really loaded: "economic" or "cultural economy" or some mix of these is
probably more accurate) tendency seems to have the potential to dull poetry
down, at in the estimation of some knowledgeable observers. And: let alone
that poetry then falls under the umbrella of institutional life rather than
*life.*  Everyday life, of many, in all the variousness that implies.
Perhaps it gives a false impression of  streamlining to poetry, this
academicizing.  And I am very skeptical of that, and think it should be
questioned more deeply and more often.

But to answer your immediate question, here--yes, some "relatively
non-privileged folks" do work their way through educations in "po-biz."
There is quite a range to this inclusive phrasing, but I should make clear
that I was lucky enough to get back to college and now teach, so I include
myself as one but in another sense, it's also true that I have always had
the benefit of literacy.  But even knowing and being grateful for that much
(in the larger community-sense of things) does not de-fuse the lingering
problem, really a trend stemming from an historical tendency, of cultivating
an ever-more institutionalized kind of poetry.

See what I'm getting at?  How trained, how cultivated, how evaluated by
grades in the current kind of academicizing, then, should poetry be?  I mean
is that what poets want (is that what readers want)?--given that the choices
seem to be narrowing, as you indicate.

There are many amazing readerly/writerly folks who never had a thing to do
with college or, some of the folks I know, not with high school either. And
their "outsider" (so-called) perspectives really energize the work they
commit.  Their contributions are of great value to me.  So this cultural
economy of academicizing po-biz, by its exclusionary practices, seems to
harbor the potential of great loss to poetry in some important ways.

Thus, what is the range of available choices?  My questions are meant to
keep this part the discussion going--I do not have any special answers
myself, but am intensely curious, as ever, about this social trajectory, and
many others, regarding poetry.

Thanks for the thoughful discussion.

Best,

Chris Murray

It is a composition vaguely (nota bene) inspired by Indian "bols",
that is the syllables used in Indian music to "audibly notate"
rhythmic drum (e.g. tabla) patterns ... although the meter is very
stretched here - not strict

I feel compelled to respond to this. My background and experience
has been highly mixed from the start, and when I gave up on academia
in the 70s (my late teens), I also gave up the hope of  writing anything
others would ever read.  Getting through life was all-consuming.
When I suddenly started to write again after essentially 30 yrs of
silence I began with an intense period of reflection, reworking, and
redefining myself. And surprise - I have work that other people read
and like. Publish? probably not. Like someone else said  -
too experimental, too narrative, etc. Not in the niche.

By accident in the interim, I was working in a university by that time
but not teaching. It wasn't the academic environment (MFA accepting 6
or so people a year) that opened my world; it was discovering that on
back streets and in dead-end jobs everywhere around me people are
making poems happen in a bewildering, feverish mosaic from self-expression
through experimentation. I talk to poets and professors on campus who
bewail the lack of respect poetry gets, but won't come down to the local
spots and give respect to the poets who are squeezing words out of
mops and dishing them out in fast food joints.

After years of enticing, one of the poet/professors on this particular
hill came down to mc (we thought) at a local open mic that had been
around 10 yrs or so. He read a spate of his work, and then left w/out
sitting through even one word by anyone else. Whatever energy he
could have gotten from sharing <with> instead of reading <at>, was lost.

In the city, there's everything from hiphop to spewing from a high
school diary to highly polished lyrics and narratives, both in and out
of form, to deliberate Oulipean constructions. And it's fertile, because
ideas and experiments cross-pollinate. Bad poets get better, or at
least get new forms in which to be bad; but good poets get an ear
- and eye - some of the poets are visual artists as well - for what's
possible. I know of at least 10 venues in a town that is supposed
by the hill not to be interested in poetry at all. I can be out every
night, sometimes in some not-so-pretty places, and find people who
respect what I am trying to do, and from whom I can learn.

How many writers support themselves with something else? I
have a hard time these days finding people who <don't> write.
Janitors, dropouts, the math whiz who won't put pen to paper
for a grocery list 'cause he "hates writing" - they've all got a shoebox
with scraps of something y'all oughta see - or better yet, hear.

Someone said below:
 "Go to school, get MFA, submit poems...blah blah blah."

Nice. Meanwhile the real work of poetry is passing you by, its
hand held out for change or to pocket a tip at the diner, or tapping
its foot against the accelerator of the family van down at the soccer
field. The best poet I know is 19, and she won't submit a word for
publication; it might change how she thought about her work.

Work ethic? Try getting up at 4 am for shift work, taking a swipe
at family life, and <then> starting the work that keeps you alive,
writing and reading, hanging with other poets, trading skills and
imagery and voices. Publish or perish? Some of us have to literally
fight our way out the door to get to where we can be with other
writers. It's not about getting paid. It's about getting to do it at all.
But I'll tell you who the outsiders are: it's the 6 up on the hill doing
an MFA, trying to coax a poetry plant to grow with no nourishment
because they never come down to the living well.

Subject:      Nano codes and a  quiz!
Mime-version: 1.0
Content-type: text/plain; charset="ISO-8859-1"
Content-transfer-encoding: quoted-printable

Occasionally I get myself puzzled, and maybe a little terrified by Alan
Sondheim's renditions of programming codes - as if all those letters,
numbers and positions may indicate a substrata of markers ("nodes") already
in place, each one hard at work in the definition and manipulation of the
way in which each us may or may not - in the very present or in some future
- be allowed to occupy, process thought, and operate in our public or
private spheres. "Abandon free will," those of you who dare to enter here
appears the sub-code and conviction of such a space. Of course, part of me
says my viewpoint is just a reflection of my provincial and willful
ignorance and study of the new founding pillars of post-industrial modes
("nodes" of operation. What was once manifest in the steel structures of
corporate life - and the material sources for great art(at least what I hav=
e
liked), as say the work of Richard Serra, or Walter DeMaria's Lightening
Field - now appear to be behind us. To rebuild the Twin Towers of the World
Trade Center, in fact, now appears to be a useless and unnecessary act of
relocation  - it's habitat and significance better left to the imagination
of an urban Proust or scholar; what we will actually get, and at great
expense,  will be a historical redundancy,  an hors de commerce edition a
building with no real function in a nano world where most transactions,
commercial and otherwise, can be instantly organized, manifested, directed
fulfilled, and traced with multi-colored micro Quantum spots across multipl=
e
intersecting nodes, including the view and correction of any systemic
screw-ups.  Architectural  visibility rendered in steel will be a quaint
memory of the ancien regime.

I am not going to try to imagine the emergent aesthetic, the constructs
built within what is invisible to the naked eye, what for example, is the
ultimate disappearance of the relevance of a sentence, or any conventions o=
f
syntax, no matter how currently experimentally conceived. "Back in the day"=
,
for example, it used to normal to formally ask the person behind the hotel
desk, "May I please have the key to Room X." Gradually, in skinny=3Ddown
American fashion, a person just looked at the clerk and said "X", then that
became eyeball contact without words, and that became a flat, computerized
temporary key to carry in the pocket for your temporary door, temporary bed=
,
etc.

I don't know if I see the poem (or paragraph) disappearing in a similar
manner - into a white space with an entry code (locked without an enabling
key code) and then, the aesthetic work's invisibility only traceable by a
Quantum spot - quick spots revealing letters revealing words that disappear

Carolyn,

That's a great response--good to hear.
A lively community you've got going, too.
Your experience of academic readers unfortunately sounds all to true, I'm
sorry to say. Not every academic-influenced reader, of course, but many.
What's it going to take to put some life in some of those folks?!



Thanks so much!

Best,
Chris Murray

This thread has fascinated me as I, too, was very aware of gender-based
limitations in the 60's when it appeared that most of the free living of
the time involved what men -- not women -- could do.  And I, too, was
away for too long before resuming the work and play of poetry two years
ago.  I wrote this one on my way home from a poetry conference.  'nuf

from "Incidental Eclipse"
by Joseph Donahue

Pelicans descend
& settle onto Nightmare Bay.
In one life, the shops are closed.
In another, a cataclysm, a harvest festival
where your kisses are a netful of moons and stars
made from foil.  But the tremor in the air
is that of a love yet to be given...

The brochure promised our god
would be the one of the second birth,
not just a fox near midnight on the garden wall.
Or a surge of white ocean fog blotting light and sound.
Or words done in party-colored chalk, washed back to stone,
and the summerhouse a char, raked over and sold.
Room of the suicide, a blue cube of sky...
Or a monastery window, constellations glittering.
A drugstore:  slip in hand, waiting for a name to be called,
"The colors of my aura are dangerously sharpening..."
Of the four forbidden subjects, this is the third:
Creation's essential dissolve...

You keep your head half turned away.
On your medallion a glittering river turns into a cloud.
New country where neither the boy nor the girl had ever been.
A bitter mist over a pure lake, lush hairfall, full lips,
there on that hillside, cities scattering out
shrines and pathways though several
from those years are dead
and the sky-high hotel lounge
turning slowly in the clear night air --
stars, the studs and rivets of some further adornment
"This is only the first clue to your place here,"
your voice cuts in.  "The truth all at once
would only unhinge you..."



"Man Eating Rice"
by Patrick Herron

Today I saw a man eating rice.
Later I watched another man write
a story about the man eating rice.

Later still I saw another man so hungry
he ate the paper on which
the story was written

the story of the rice and
the man eating rice
and the man who wrote about

the man eating rice
and the man eating the story
about the man who was so hungry

he wrote the story
of the man who ate the story
of the man eating rice.

I think it's in Michael Benedikt's Cyberspace: First Steps, all the way
from the early 90s, the idea of a liquid architecture - which unites the
post-WTC hybrids and code itself; the latter is mobile, always in flux,
protocol-dependent, software/hardware dependent, just as these letters are
written in 'lower ascii,' another code necessary placed in the sendmail
protocols, the tcp/ip protocols, all the way back and fortha mong routers,
operating systems, radio transmissions, even wireless protocols. And there
is always a bit of illumination realizing that hitting a key on a computer
keyboard INTERRUPTS, and is read as an interrupt, that communication is an
interference in quietude or flux.

At night one loses sleep, is it codes or noise and chaos? Wolfram provides
a way out, the simplest codes tending towards enormously complex chaotic
structures reminiscent of noise, but not annihilating. My own pessimistic
tendency heads towards plasmas, the inconceivable alienness of space, dark
matter, strings, quarks with problematic spins, all these things tearing
at our pretence to eternity and even towards comprehensino. Brillouin, a
French physicist, created the idea decades ago that our knowledge of the
physical world is tied directly to economics - the larger the machinery,
the more energy consumed - the greater the number of anomalies. It's not
even known if there's an end to it. The current Linux Journal describes
software developed to manage the industrial processes of high-energy
physics machine fabrication - already another mini-industry in itself.

Code or annihilation of code, presence or absence, interrupting parasite
or well-loved guest, the world is a miracle.

Make poetry online by taking a few minutes of your day and typing out
online vocabulary searches.  It's easy, you can do it on your own time
at your own pace, and you get good poems doing so.  Most users are
making between 20-150 poems per hour typing out tiny forms.  Some can
be done online, some in person, and you can even get other poetry and
books for free while you type!  This is a really cool opportunity and I
suggest you use it!

To begin the signup process.  To the skeptical people, this is an easy
way of making poetry.  It's not fake, if you look on the site you will
see examples of BIG POETS and links to their websites, of well known
ones, who offer you poems to occupy your tiny lives.  Please don't pass
this up, it's only open for the next few weeks.

Not bizarre, Ron, just too flip, and I've apologized publicly for that.
You spent the first two thirds what might have been a good post on
January 2nd post (
http://ronsilliman.blogspot.com/
2004_01_01_ronsilliman_archive.html#107304337280793398 ) in a truly
bizarre attempt at a typographical demonstration that the poetic line
is inherent in the shapes of letters, and you've ignored subsequent
discussions of the issue here (
http://www.ksilem.com/weblog/mt-comments.cgi?entry_id=372 ) and here (
http://www.ksilem.com/weblog/mt-comments.cgi?entry_id=374 ). If you'd
care to actually talk about it,  fine. Otherwise, pfft!

WALKER ART CENTER & Rain Taxi Review of Books

Present:

Pierre Joris & Nicole Peyrafitte

(with music & max-msp-jitter-patch by Holland Hopson)


S U M E R I C A B A C H b o n e s
A Voco-Visual Performance

SUMERICABACHBONEs is a double tryptich: Thematically it moves from
Mesopotamia to America to Europe, while formally it makes use of the
range of possibilities of the performers' arts: sound (voice &
instrumental compositions), text (poem, prose & whatever lies
inbetween) and image (drawing, collage,  painting, video).


Poet and translator Pierre Joris left Luxembourg at age 19 & has since
lived in the U.S., Great Britain, North Africa, and France. Rain Taxi
praised his most recent collection, _Poasis: Selected Poems 1986-1999_,
for "its physical, philosophical delight in words and their
reverberations." Just out from Wesleyan U.P. is his collection of
essays _A Nomad Poetics_. His recent translations include _4x1: Work by
Tristan Tzara, Rainer Maria Rilke, Jean-Pierre Duprey & Habib Tengour_
and Abdelwahab Meddeb's _The Malady of Islam_. With Jerome Rothenberg
he edited the award-winning anthology _Poems for the Millennium_. In
2004 Green Integer will reissue three volumes of his translations of
Paul Celan: _Breathturn_, _Threadsuns_ and _Lightduress_. He currently
teaches poetry and poetics at SUNY-Albany. During the fall of 2003 he
was Berlin Prize Fellow at the American Academy in Berlin. Visit Pierre
Joris's website at www.albany.edu/~joris/.



Like the willful child in Marguerite Duras's _Les Enfants_, artist
Nicole Peyrafitte resisted going to school, "because they were trying
to teach me things that I didn't know." Each step of her work attempts
to fulfill her compulsion to learn through a process of immersion that
generates performances incorporating
voice/paintings/drawings/collages/writing--and sometimes cooking.
Peyrafitte has exhibited and performed her work throughout Europe and
North America. Joris and Peyrafitte have collaborated for 14 years,
most recently touring  SUMERICABACHBONEs throughout the U.S. & Europe.

from "Incidental Eclipse"
by Joseph Donahue

Pelicans descend
& settle onto Nightmare Bay.
In one life, the shops are closed.
In another, a cataclysm, a harvest festival
where your kisses are a netful of moons and stars
made from foil.  But the tremor in the air
is that of a love yet to be given...

The brochure promised our god
would be the one of the second birth,
not just a fox near midnight on the garden wall.
Or a surge of white ocean fog blotting light and sound.
Or words done in party-colored chalk, washed back to stone,
and the summerhouse a char, raked over and sold.
Room of the suicide, a blue cube of sky...
Or a monastery window, constellations glittering.
A drugstore:  slip in hand, waiting for a name to be called, "The colors
of my aura are dangerously sharpening..." Of the four forbidden
subjects, this is the third: Creation's essential dissolve...

You keep your head half turned away.
On your medallion a glittering river turns into a cloud.
New country where neither the boy nor the girl had ever been.
A bitter mist over a pure lake, lush hairfall, full lips,
there on that hillside, cities scattering out
shrines and pathways though several
from those years are dead
and the sky-high hotel lounge
turning slowly in the clear night air --
stars, the studs and rivets of some further adornment
"This is only the first clue to your place here,"
your voice cuts in.  "The truth all at once
would only unhinge you..."



"Man Eating Rice"
by Patrick Herron

Today I saw a man eating rice.
Later I watched another man write
a story about the man eating rice.

Later still I saw another man so hungry
he ate the paper on which
the story was written

the story of the rice and
the man eating rice
and the man who wrote about

the man eating rice
and the man eating the story
about the man who was so hungry

he wrote the story
of the man who ate the story
of the man eating rice.

Thanks, Alan, for this lovely summation - it's helpful. Makes me want to
ask, does or does not ones head/body go to sleep "in code" at night. Are
one's dreams pre-coded or, code-breached, entries into the wild, leaping to
form unique codes (poems), illuminated charms between infinite layers of
codes beyond codes. (?)

Poetic language - at its most actively present -  a "decoding" rather than a
(pre-fixed, time-permanent) "coding."

Quiz winners, by the way, will be announced tomorrow. For late entries, the
code to bust remains:

CO
SM
(G)

One winner so far. This is tough. Try it.

Matthew or Schwarzenneger?  I think you are more of a School Inspector
than a Terminator.  Which is a compliment.  Ask me sometime about my
position that Arnold is a closet Nietzchean (he knew this at birth, but
struggled mightily against it).

Someone - maybe the resident physics guru, Sondheim - make a time machine so
that we can (in the best sci-fi manner) go back in time and stop whatever
events caused Kirby to go from a nice leftist, anarchist, counterculture boy
to the mess of a rightist Oreilly-ite he is today.

Either that or we clone him and create an evil (good?) twin for List
purposes. Maybe have them fight each other and see who wins. Maybe the
universe would implode.

This Welcome Message updated 24 March 2003.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Above the world-weary horizons
New obstacles for exchange arise
Or unfold,
O ye postmasters!

1. About the Poetics List

With the preceeding epigraph, the Poetics Listserv was founded by Charles
Bernstein in late 1993. Now in its third incarnation, the list carries
about 1000 subscribers worldwide, though all of these subscribers do not
necessarily receive messages at any given time. A good number of other
people read the Poetics List via our web archives (see web-address above).

Our aim is to support, inform, and extend those directions in poetry that
are committed to innovations, renovations, and investigations of form
and/or/as content, to the questioning of received forms and styles, and to
the creation of the otherwise unimagined, untried, unexpected, improbable,
and impossible.  We recognize that other lists may sponsor other
possibilities for exchange in this still-new medium. We request that those
participating in this forum keep in mind the specialized and focused nature
of this project, and respect our decision to operate a moderated list. For
subscription information or to contact the moderators, write to
<poetics@acsu.buffalo.edu>.

This is a private list and information about this list should not be posted
to other lists or directories of lists. The idea is to keep the list
membership to those with specific rather than general interests, and also
to keep the scale of the list relatively small and the volume manageable.
The current limits of the list are 50 messages per day, and two messages
per subscriber per day.

The Poetics List is a moderated list. Due to the high number of
subscribers, we no longer maintain the open format with which the list
began (at under 100 subscribers). The specific form of moderation that we
employ is a relatively fluid one: in most cases, messages are reviewed
after having been posted to the list, and difficulties resolved on that
basis; however, the list moderators may shift with impunity between this
and a pre-review mode which calls for all messages to be read and approved
before being forwarded to the list. We prefer to avoid this option, as it
hampers the spontaneity of discussion that we hope to promote. In addition
to these options, the list moderators may place subscribers who find
themselves unable to abide by the rules of the list under individual
review, in which case only their messages would be received for moderators'
approval before being forwarded to the list. We remain committed to this
editorial function as a defining element of the Poetics List (for further
information please see section 6 of this Welcome Message).

Those few individuals who are no longer welcome to post on this list have
forfeited that right because of their refusal to abide by list policies as
stated in this Welcome message. While we adhere to a practice of not
discussing particular cases on the list, the areas of our greatest concern
include flaming of other list subscribers, including the list owners,
and/or giving us false registration information. Please note some
individuals have publicized false accounts of the policies of the Poetics
List. We have deemed it unwise to respond directly to the flames of the
list, preferring simply to note here that the Poetics List exists to
support and encourage divergent points of view on Modern and contemporary
poetry and poetics. We are committed to do what is necessary to preserve
this space for such dialog. For this reason, the list has always been
private or moderated.

Further information on posting to the list for subscribers, publishers and
series-coordinators, see sections 5 and 6.

In addition to being archived at through the EPC (http://epc.buffalo.edu)
and at http://listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu/archives/poetics.html, some posts
to Poetics (especially reviews, obituary notices, announcements, etc.) may
also become part of specific EPC subject areas. Brief reviews of poetry
events and publications are always welcome; we also encourage posts that
announce events important to our subscribers. See section 5 for details.

----------------

2. Subscriptions

Subscriptions to the Poetics List are free of charge, but formal
registration is required. We ask that when you subscribe you provide your
full name, street address, email address, and telephone number. All posts
to the list should provide your full real name, as registered. If there is
any discrepancy between your full name as it appears in the "from" line of
the message header, please sign your post at the bottom.  PLEASE NOTE: All
subscription-related information and correspondence remains absolutely
confidential.

To subscribe to the Poetics List, please contact the moderators at the
lists' administrative address <poetics@acsu.buffalo.edu>. Your message
should include all of the required information. All other questions about
subscriptions, whether about an individual subscription or subscription
policy, should be addressed to this same administrative address.

PLEASE NOTE: IT MAY TAKE SEVERAL WEEKS TO PROCESS SUBSCRIPTION REQUESTS.

The most frequent problem with subscriptions is bounced messages. If your
system is often down or if you have a low disk quota, Poetics messages may
get bounced. Please try avoid having messages from the list returned to us.
If the problem is low disk quota, you may wish to request an increased
quota from your system administrator.  You might also consider obtaining a
commercial account. In general, if a good number of Poetics messages are
bounced from your account, your subscription to Poetics will be temporarily
suspended. If this happens, you may re-subscribe to the list by contacting
the moderators at<poetics@acsu.buffalo.edu>.

-----------------

3. Subscription Options

We encourage you to alter your subscription options via the link on the
right side of the screen at
http://listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu/archives/poetics.html.  If you would
prefer not to use the web-interface, you may also email
<listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu> the following commands:

*to receive posts in the default option (you will receive individual
postings immediately), send <listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu> this one-line
message with no "subject": set poetics nodigest

* to receive the list in digest form (you will receive the day's individual
posts in one email sent just after midnight EST), send
<listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu> this one-line message with no "subject":
set poetics digest

* to receive the list in index form (you will receive a list, without the
text of the posts, of the subjects discussed each day along with the
author's name and address and the number of lines it comprises; you can
also choose to have the index sent to you in either plain text or in HTML
format with hyperlinks), send <listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu> this one-line
message with no "subject": set poetics nohtml index  --or--  set poetics
html index

*to temporarily turn off Poetics mail send <listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu>
this one-line message with no "subject": set poetics nomail

*to reactivate Poetics mail send <listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu> this
one-line message with no "subject": set poetics mail

PLEASE NOTE: do not leave your Poetics subscription "active" if you are
going to be away for any extended period of time.  Your account may become
flooded and you may lose not only Poetics messages but other important mail.

-----------------------

4.  To Unsubscribe

To unsubscribe (or change any of your subscription options) go to the
right-hand side of the screen at
http://listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu/archives/poetics.html  You may also may
unsubscribe by sending a one-line email to <listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu>
with no "subject": unsub poetics

If you are having difficulty unsubscribing, please note: sometimes your
e-mail address may be changed slightly by your system administrator. If
this happens you will not be able to send messages to Poetics or to
unsubscribe, although you will continue to receive mail from the Poetics
List. To avoid this problem, unsub using your old address, then return to
your new address and contact the moderators at <poetics@acsu.buffalo.edu>
to resubscribe. If you find that it is not possible to unsub using your old
address, please contact the moderators at <poetics@acsu.buffalo.edu> for
assistance.

--------------------------

5.  Posting to the List

The Poetics List is a moderated list. All messages are reviewed by the
moderators in keeping with the goals of the list as articulated in this
Welcome Message (see section 1).

Please note that while this list is primarily concerned with discussions of
poetry and poetics, messages relating to politics and political activism,
film, art, media, and so forth are also welcome. Feel free to query the
list moderators if you are uncertain as to whether a message is
appropriate. All correspondence with the moderators regarding submissions
to the list remains confidential and should be directed to us at
<poetics@acsu.buffalo.edu>.

We strongly encourage subscribers to post information on publications and
reading series that they have coordinated, edited, published, or in which
they appear. Such announcements constitute a core function of this list.
Brief reviews of poetry events and publications are always welcome.

To post to the Poetics List, send your messages directly
to the list address: <poetics@listserv.buffalo.edu>

Please do not send messages intended for posting to the list to our
administrative address <poetics@acsu.buffalo.edu>

For further information on posting to the list, see section 6 below.

-------------------

6. Cautions

"Flame" messages will not be tolerated on the Poetics List. In this
category are included messages gratuitously attacking fellow listees or the
list owners, also messages designed to "waste bandwidth" or cause the list
to reach its daily limit. These messages are considered offensive and
detrimental to list discussion. Offending subscribers will be placed on
temporary review (see section 1). Repeat offenders will be removed from the
list immediately. Please do not put this policy to test.

For reasons of basic security, we do not allow pseudononymous
subscriptions.  We also discourage the sending of HTML-formatted messages
to the list. All messages intended for the Poetics List should be sent in
Text-Only format.

Please also do not send attachments or include extremely long documents
(1,000+ words) in a post.  Messages containing attachments will be presumed
to be worm- or virus-carrying and will not be forwarded to the list.

Please do not publish list postings without the express permission of the
author. Posting on the list is a form of publication. Copyright for all
material posted on Poetics remains with the author; material from this list
and its archive may not be reproduced without the author's permission,
beyond the standard rights accorded by "fair use" of published materials.

As an outside maximum, we will accept no more than 2 messages per day from
any one subscriber. Also, given that our goal is a manageable list
(manageable both for moderators and subscribers), the list accepts 50 or
fewer messages per day.

Like all systems, the listserv will sometimes be down: if you feel your
message has been delayed or lost, *please wait at least one day to see if
it shows up*, then check the archive to be sure the message is not posted
there; if you still feel there is a problem, you may wish to contact the
moderators at <poetics@acsu.buffalo.edu>.

Kirby, baby, if this is some kind of ploy to get your dick sucked
so we queers can prove we're queer, think again.  well, actually,
i shouldn't speak for everyone, so i'll just say i'm not interested
in proving anything to you.

if anyone wants to say they're queer, for whatever reason, who
am i stand in their way in the end anyway?  Drexel University has
had its share of queer bashing by frat boys.  in fact, there were two
queer households in the neighborhood where the frat house bulges
its Greek testosterone driven letters.  the "boys" had a habit of
beating the shit out of the men and grabbing their cocks through
their designer jeans when the lesbians walked by.  they then
started going onto the porches of these gay men and lesbians
and setting fire to their rainbow flags.  of the 25 other homes
on the block, EVERYone bought rainbow flags in support, leaving
only the frat house flagless.  all this just a year ago.

It's even worse here. Maybe it occurs after especially long sessions
at the computer -  I am not sure - but it happens while I am still
awake, that I get the idea - just for a split second, and then I am
back to normal again - that I could (in my real-life, in my
real-room, or real-kitchen) just look at some object which I would
like to dispose of - just look at it, and by this highlight it and
then press some imaginary delete key - and gone it would be. Or in
the kitchen, standing there with a cup of newly made coffee - better
make that two cups, my wife says from the living room - and for a
short moment, while I blink my eye, it is as if I could just
highlight the cup, without even touching it, and then copy and paste
a clone of it onto my tray ...

spam 'uns*bscr%b^' notices: we've got the encompassing of the dialectic

think of spam as the theory of capital.

or as the false theory of capital, or as sartre's theory of the

the dialectic has no resolution; capital oozes in, transforms the ontology

the opposite is the same, vis-a-vis irigaray: if one does not click on

Dear Kirby,


1. In part I'm posting this because I wanted to change the terms of the
subject line in the thread you began.  I did so to reflect more accurately
the topic and the course of this thread--especially since it contained
someone's name and was stated in a way that could easily be misinterpreted
as an (uncalled for, and yet also a repeating) criticism.

2. I'm also wondering about the reason for the name-dropping contained in
the text of that initial post you made, which begins the thread--I wonder if
you realize that the way you've mentioned these other people seems uncalled
for and unfair.

fiction, passage


i am addicted to novels. i am reading journey to
the west. wonderful elements of taoism. magical
taoism whick killed the emperor. ennin wrote
about that. you see the emperor was taking magic
elixirs to live for ever. but no one lives
forever! monkey is in it but it reads very
differently in the full version than in waley's
condensation. also five taoist classics which
contains the chinese; i can make out a sentence
or two. the character for 'between' is useful.

most popular novels are pretty bad. plots are
exaggerated and you have to be a dunce to fall
for the willing suspension of disbelief. things
are added in incoherency in order to manipulate
the reader. the world is picaresque; these novels
are not. there are always criminals teasing
lawmakers because we know that criminals want to
be caught. they are criminals! and there are
conspiracies as well; nothing exists in terms of
appearance only. it's magical belief! elixir! it
kills.

as does the addiction itself. my head fills with
swollen emptiness. no exaggeration, it will go
off with a bang. so i'm turning to mencius; he's
got cases, anecdotes, and questioning that can
only remind one of xenophon's socrates. for there
are many socrates, the world splits as well.

are you aware that i'm nearer to death than you
are? soon i will see inconceivable things, things
you might dream of forever. the world will turn
dark and these words will be all that's left.

MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

I agree with Max that Noah's numbers are extremely
problematic and unreliable.

In college, they used to talk about "Rocks for Jocks"
(geology courses dumbed down to get the sports
scholarship students through science requirements) and
--"Poets' Math."

Noah's numbers, upon closer inspection, belie the
implied moral he draws from them, I believe.  They may
show the ~opposite~ of what's being read into them.

What they show is a "patriarchal society" where

~over a quarter~ of the journals counted (8 out of 30)
 either include male/female authors' names in equal
numbers or where there are more female names than
male.

How insidiously patriarchal is over a quarter
egalitarian/female majority?

And, if you accept, as I would, that a range of 54%
male/46% female to 57% male/43% female is ~quite good~
for a patriarchal society (and that the standard error
of Noah's numbers alone may account for that
difference, since, as Anthony Robinson pointed out,
there is miscounting involved),--- then almost half
(43%) of the journals show equal numbers, more females
than males, or that narrow 55.5%-to-44.5% difference.


If, as some editors have been attesting, submissions
themselves are weighted toward about 70% male, then
journals are ~mis~-representative in doing better than
those realities.

All that ~Affirmative Action~ asks, by law, is that a
workplace ~meet~ the distribution of the general
population, within any particular field.   If women
are only 1% of the general population for, say,
butchers, then one percent hired ~satisfies~
Affirmative Action.

~Being and Nothingness~ defines "bad faith" as the
x-that-is-more-than-y: "the love that is more than
love"; the waiter who is more than a waiter.

By trying to ~do better~ than a 70%/30% ratio that the
actual submissions consist of, things are entering
into The Action That Is ~More Affirmative Than~
Affirmative Action.

There are fields where the male/female-female/male
ratio differs.  Pool halls are disproportionately
male.  Manicure parlors are disproportionately female.


It may very well be the case that experimental poetry
is a game that most women are ~too smart~ to play.

Or, as Mark pointed out, that most female first name
poets have gone over to "School of Quietude" journals.



Regardless, attempts to reconstruct Noah's numbers by
checking on-line table of contents for the issues
involve show a very different picture.  Noah and Sara
were (excluding translators, many of whom were female
but) counting ~every~ name in the table of contents,
and conflating poets with essayists, short story
writers, reviewers, and ---Dead White Males like
~Catullus~ and ~Tristan Tzara!~ whose moldering
antiquity places them in a completely separate
category, I would say, that doesn't represent some
sort of place-in-the-sun-stealing threat to ~anybody.~
 Within those different sub-groups, the imbalance for,
say, short story writers (at a glance) is vastly more
weighted toward males than for poets.  This further
distorts the numbers.


When Max says, "Rather than counting the  number of
poets, why not count the number of pages those poets'
work takes up? But then the question arises: why do so
much counting?",---

I'd take him one step further: why not count ~the
number of letters in the authors' names~

and whether male/female falls on odd/even pages?

Unanalyzed, unsystematized, uncrunched numbers left in
and of themselves as though they were in scare quotes
show nothing.  More impression-biassing to Noah's
presentation is the ~anecdote~ that he lays out at the
beginning ("my partner, the poet Sara Veglahn, had
perused it's pages for a while. . . . the first thing
she said was"). It's that that skews a narrative onto
those mute and arguable numbers, ---or leads the
un-statistics-minded to just glaze out entirely at
their cacaphonous jumble.  (Excuse my cynicism,
please: "the first thing she said was",--- as if
Diotima herself had appeared at the end of Plato to
bring Socrates the truth!)  The gratuitous framing of
these questions in heterodominant self-portraiture
does not add to their believability, for me.  Taking a
tattooed War of The Sexes that may exist in your
apartment out onto the Poetics List is only a
re-inscribing of gender onto sex from the personal
sphere into the public.

Who ever told you you were a man in the first place?!
(and so redundantly: "a man ( or as the particular
'man' that I am)")


Maybe because he's so busy counting out that wad of
fifties I threw on the bed, My Last Hustler can't find
even ~one~ male prostitute in those journals, Noah.

(He only counts ~inches!~)



. . . Which of the following, two, "equally good" poem
excerpts should not have been published in ~26: issue
B,~ on the basis that its author has a male name?

What does the sex of an author ~signify~ in a dominant
style of writing that is, for the most part, based on
dispensing with all the biographical markers of the
author?

To quote the poet Sara Veglahn's poem, "The lakes
unsafe . . .", from that same issue:

     "It is likely ~I~ will be lost"

(my emphasis).  Is the word "breast" ("breast wove w
winter-cure mustard) more female when Geraldine Monk
uses it, than when Valerie Coulton contaminates
~l'ecriture feminine~ by collaborating with Ed
Smallfield on the line "a year of breasts and
cigarettes", in the same issue?

If there are questions here, the biggest question is:
what vestigial relevance to the reading of a poem does
author's sex, race, economic status, sexual
preference, or whatever have when those poems have
completely foreclosed all those identity politics?
("his or her asteroid" ---Hung Q. Tu, in the ~Aufgabe~
that Noah counts)


Interestingly, ---and as paradoxical as it sounds---
those numbers show a ~negative correlation~ between
the size of the journal and the number of ~both~ male
(-.80) and female (-.47) authors' names.

That is, the fewer the number of authors there are in
a journal, men are only around 20% more likely to
appear, but women are almost 50% more likely to be
included.


There's a double-bind in Noah's "Unclear" category,
too.  Where sex is not unclear because the author is
using initials, it's unclear because the first name is
~"ethnic"~ and not recognizably Western.

So, ethnic identity actuals ~competes with~ sexual
parity in those numbers.  If the authors didn't have
ethnic names, there'd be more women to count.


If there's a bean, I'll count it:

Using the Eli Gordon approximation method (based
solely on first names, with numerous "Unclear"), the
on-line Fence mastheads since issue 3n2 would seem to
show the number of female poets included to be
steadily declining.

6n1 10 F out of 38 poets = .26
5n2 12 F out of 32 poets = .37
5n1 16 F out of 48 poets = .33
4n2 16 F out of 36 poets = .44
4n1 21 F out of 41 poets = .51
3n2 21 F out of 33 poets = .63

Horrors.

WHAT HAS MAX WINTER DONE WITH REBECCA WOLFF, ANYWAY?!

("Put it down.  Put the phone down now."  --- Timothy
Donnelly, "Accidental Species")


I find it very disturbing, after all the words I (or
any poet) have tried so carefully to choose in the
poems that I submit to journals, that I might be
rejected on the basis of the one, single word that I
did ~not~ choose but that my parents chose instead: my
first name.

SELAH (Barrow Street Press, 2003)

"With Selah Joshua Corey joins a generation of exciting first-book poets
(Jennifer Clarvoe, Joanie Mackowski, Cate Marvin come to mind) who apply the
fundamental poetic gift of the ear, in new ways. Sheer richness of language,
and in the best poems cadences layered like those of Wallace Stevens, guide
the reader through Corey's extravagant, playful, fantastical and profuse
otherworld." -Robert Pinsky

"Joshua Corey's book maps new territory in the indefatigable search for an
adequate form of elegy. These poems meditate in a timeless manner on the
terrible NOT at the center of death, but they do so to new music, one that
embodies sly humor, formal invention, and rhetorical bravado. They are
original, sophisticated and unabashed." -Mary Jo Bang

"Deep engager, Joshua Corey seeks to redeem what is 'singed' and 'wared' in
us with 'the pupa's word. Dazzled weresong' ('man' song, a 'we're' or 'we
are' song), one made strange from the straits of the problem. Through a
ravishing compact formal beauty comes 'white sound crashing . . . on the
shoals of . . . sleep.' He has gone so far into disillusion and aporia that
he seems about to emerge out the other side, as through one of those
suddenly wavering, watery space- and time-walls in a science-fiction film.
What if it really is as he says: 'my mouth is full of his breath. / His
tongue is in my mouth, and his name / is every body I see'? Selah: lift up!
He keeps you hooked; he keeps you tantalized."-Cal Bedient

could someone down there please explain to me what happened in Iowa?

Does this mean that the Democrats are, in effect, going to follow Kerry
into the natioal election? I try to follow it on-line through various
websites but I'm a bit confused as I thought Dean was strong. Also, did
Michael Moore's endorsement of Clark count for anything?

backchannel is fine.

thanks,

We -- the editors of Pom2, that is -- were really excited by the number of
women who contributed to Pom2 issue 4. Our previous issue had a severely
imbalanced gender ratio (in favor of men) so we took steps to make up for
that in the following issue. (Our editorial board is still imbalanced with 3
women and 1 man, but none of us seem to mind.)

I think it is terribly important to solicit work from women, and to follow
up, and to ask women who have contributed to share the magazine with others.
It has been more difficult to get contributions from women, and I don't know
"why" that is. In a sense though, I don't really care too much about the
reasoning behind it -- I just want to do something about it. So, if that
means waiting a longer time between issues so that we receive more work from
women or if we have to send out calls for submissions in places that perhaps
we didn't think to do so at first, fine. I think it's worth the trouble so
that we can more accurately reflect the communities we participate within,
and to better experience and present the range of work that is out there.
That said, we have a lot to learn about finding more voices from people of
color, and have made few strides in that arena. We have been pretty good at
queering up the issues. I think editing the magazine is all about balancing
a wide variety of criteria and sometimes you come out better on some things
than on others.

That said, I second the remark on turning to Chain for some answers. Chain
is a magazine which in many ways seems to take these issues on directly and
resolve/wrangle with it in fascinating ways. It seems to me to be a great
example of editorial vision manifesting fully in the work within it.

The male | female distinction with regard to journals does follow a =
rather rigid binary construction.

To be accurate, some survey work should be done asking contributors how =
male or female they feel, or which gender they identify with more, and =
maybe some items on the survey designed to measure degree of maleness or =
femaleness, as a subjective description, and then maybe compared to =
current societal constructions of gender.

For example, it's entirely possible that a number of the men =
contributing to a journal could be androgynes of a sort - sure there =
might be some neanderthalish guys out there writing poetry, but probably =
not good poetry.=20

Maybe also a content analysis of the poems by those discretely =
identified as male | female to determine the maleness of the content vs. =
the femaleness of the content.=20

There could be a government or institutional grant involved here, I can =
smell it.

Sincerely,
Brent

Iowa doesn't really tell you much, as the winner has no particular edge. Since '72, three winners of the Democratic caucuses have won the nomination, and two have not. Twice ('72 and '76) the winner was "Uncommitted." In '92, Clinton finished fourth behind Harkin, Uncommitted, and Tsongas. As the pundits like to say, and they're probably right in this case, Iowa tells you more about who to look out for (Edwards) than who is the favorite.

This is great news...Perhaps I'll submit again.  I have to admit, though,
that I'm often mistaken for a man, what with my androgynous name, despite
its spelling, of Terrie Leigh.
As the poetry editor of writersmonthly.us, I often wonder why more women
don't submit.  Come on, women!

Best,

Ter

To be honest, Brent, I can think of few things more refreshing right now =
than a good dose of Neanderthal poetry.  God I wish I could write it =
myself!  I'd write it with a burnt cudgel still spiked with blood and hair =
on a flaming great rock which drank the rising sun (and a coda on the =

Haha, wonderful. I love it. Actually, last year I was out at the lake near a
campfire - the kind made with a ring of stones - and I tried making some
cave-painting-esque figures of horses and other animals on the rocks with
the charcoal from the fire pit. It stayed there amazingly long through the
rains off and on that season. I don't know, there was something interesting
about engaging in an ancient sort of artform, though.

Well you see it can't be left-justified.  It's got to be jagged and =

as an editor/publisher since 1993, ive noticed, too, that its pullin teeth
to get girl submissions but boys send when the ink still wet. with that,
tho, the girl stuff is usually far more interesting, polished, etcetera.

ive never looked at above/ground press gender things, but there are lots
of women ive been "courting" for some time, with various successes, to get
work. some boys write too much, some girls dont let enough leave the
house. (i wont mention names)

theres a great 1960s canlit story of bill bissett (back when he did
blewointmentpress) breaking into maxine gadds house & stealing a pile of
her poems, & turning them into a book. Westerns, i think? in the end, she
even didnt mind.

After literally dozens of entries, we finally have a winner.
Indeed it took the took the linguistic transformative smarts of Martha L
Deed to construct the victory lap (so to speak) with the following:

CO = Coffee
SM = Small
(G) = To Go

That's how the Coffee Shop codes me in the morning. They even look troubled

Congratulations, Martha. Keep crackin',

I think you started something-- It immediately triggered the lines below.
 Problem is, not reflective of your wish for richly textured imagery.
Then -- say I -- with all the defensiveness of a "true poet"  -- did
neanderthals have adjectives? the ability to write abstractions? Do they
now?

The original was drawn on a ragged edged garment of red and
off-white, and is accompanied by free-hand renditions of various
types of chases - hard to reproduce in text.

MIME-Version: 1.0

Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

I've been meaning to point out that in myth theory patriarchy doesn't mean
that men rule or matriarchy that women rule.

I've seen this mistake over and over, and I think it is important to clarify
it so that you can start to use the terms properly.

The terms are begun by JJ Bachofen, a Swiss amateur anthropologist and close
friend of Nietzsche.  He wrote a book called Mutterrecht -- Mother Right --
about a supposed matirarchal society that he had intuited from various
readings in Greek mythology.  He argued that there was originally such a
society that was dominated by maternal symbols.  He never said that women
dominated the society.  In fact he argued that those societies were dominated
by a single male tyrant who used all the women as his personal harem, and
that women in those societies had no rights whatsoever except to be his
whores.

There were new age matriarchal feminists in the 1970s who invented the idea
of a perfect matriarchal society, but all these women have been completely
torn to shreds in academic circles.  Even in women's studies departments the
idea of a primitive perfect matriarchy has been shredded.  You could read
Cynthia Eller's book The Myth of Matriarchy.  She gives a good overview of
what has taken place, and also provides a good bibliography for further
study.  She teaches at a university in New York City, or close by (I forget
which).

In myth study, a patriarchal society is dominated by the following:

Laws
Rationality
Judgement
Hierarchy
Conditional Love

So, for instance, Queen Elizabeth I of England was a perfect patriarch as she
certainly exercised these qualities.  One could see Queen Victoria or
Margaret Thatcher as also being patriarchal rulers.


In a matriarchy, the following characteristics are common:

Passive acceptance of nature
Natural feelings as constituting what is right
Desire
Unity

So, for instance, Charlie Manson's The Family is an example of a matriarchal
family. In a matriarchy, the strongest hold sway because there is no right
above nature.  The strongest rule, and desire is the only law.  And so if
Charlie wants to rape you or murder you, then he rapes or murders you.
That's it.  There is no higher court than this.  Desire of the strongest
rules.

This has been made perfectly clear for a long time in mythological study.  A
patriarchal society is one that has male symbols -- the sun, or stars, as
their symbology.  The cross could also be considered patriarchal in that it
points up.  A matriarchal society on the other hand is dominated by female
(vaginal) images such as circles, or cave entrances.  This represents the
earth.  It says that there is nothing above the earth.

Many many feminists have understood that "patriarchy" doesn't mean that men
are in charge.  In fact where there are principles there is a possibility of
women being in charge.  And where there are no principles then usually the
strongest male is in charge.  But that is the matriarchal society, not the
patriarchal.

I know this is somewhat difficult and perhaps even paradoxical, but if you
read even a simple book for beginners such as The Teach Yourself book Greek
Myths by Steve Eddy and Claire Hamilton, this error in nomenclature will
hopefully right itself, and a more functional understanding of mythology and
society will result.  A more advanced reader could consult Bachofen's
amazingly brilliant text Mother Right (it's available in paperback from
Princeton U. Press).

I think this confusion arose in the 70s when new age women collapsed the
nomenclature without reading the originals, and they assumed therefore that a
society run by witches would somehow be preferable to our own.  You could
read Starhawk's The Spiral Dance if you want to read a text by an almost
complete know-nothing without any academic credibility and see how 70s
feminists just ran amok mentally and made a mess of myth study.  Women
scholars within academia such as Cynthia Eller have painstakingly tried to
repair this mess, but it hasn't succeeded yet in reaching everybody.

To summarize:

Patriarchy is about principles (men or women can rule if they do so on agreed
principles of law and order)

Matriarchy is about desire (the strongest rule, and usually this is men)

Also, there was never any original society in which women were dominant and
the society was peaceful.  This has never been discovered.  It was a happy
story told by seventies feminists.  Nobody in any university takes that
seriously any longer.  There is no proof of it.  So far as we know, early
societies that used matriarchal symbols were all dominated by a single
tyrant, who was almost always male.  In a patriarchy the principles rule, the
laws rule, and those who take the role of leader are beholden (or should be
beholden) to those rules, and not to their own desires.

Kirby,

This is patently racialist thinking.  In fact, the image that Bachofen has
in mind is no doubt the European image of Turkish society--which had
plenty of laws.  And...if we do indeed live in a "patriarchical" society
at the moment, it is clear that the rules easily subject to revision or
subversion (for instance, the rule that says that the House of
Representative must give consent to any act of war).  In any case, this
binary is something that Nietzche would have called "metaphysical": a deft
and kind phrase for poppycock (itself a euphemism).

OED, 1971 edition:
Patriarchy. 2. A patriarchal system of society or government; government by
the father or the eldest male of the family; a family, tribe or community
so organized. [first citation 1632]

Matriarchy. That form of social organization in which the mother, and not
the father, is the head of the family, and in which descent and
relationship are reackoned through mothers and not through fathers. [first
citation 1885; first citation of Matriarch 1606]

So, Kirby, your boy Bachofen seems to have missed the boat by a few centuries.

There have been numerous matriarchal societies, tho none that seem to have
been any more golden age than patriarchal societies. A modern matriarchal
society is the Hopi: among traditional Hopis men own only their tools and
their clothing. A man knows he's no longer married if when he comes home he
finds these things outside the door.

The application of moral or emotional qualities to the one or the other is
entirely metaphorical--there's no evidence to support it. The terms
themselves are problematic: is traditional Eastern European Jewish society
patriarchal or matriarchal? It's matrilineal, usually matrilocal, and
relations with the outside world, like business, are largely the province
of women. The day-to-day operation of the family is also largely a female
affair. On the other hand, men are nominally in control, and certainly in
control in shul and yeshiva.

The same is true of many of even the most macho mediterranean cultures. A
Sicilian-American family one of my colleagues worked with as therapist is a
case in point. The father was an immigrant and a barber, the mother first
generation US and the founder and head of a large and very successful real
estate agency. The session my colleague taped for consultation (with
permission, natch, went something like this:

Therapist: So who's the boss in the family.
Mother and Daughter, almost in unison: Oh, he is.
Father: straightens up, beaming.
Therapist: Well, let's see. Who decides where you [daughter] goes to
school? Who decided which house to buy? [etc. etc.]
Mother and Daughter (to each question): I (mom) do.
Therapist: So if Dad's the boss what does he decide?
Mother (deadly serious): He decides who we vote for.

Even in many Arab societies where the worst abuses of what's called
patriarchy occur most small-scale buying and selling (which at the local
level is most business) is conducted between women in the purdah tent.

Which is not to deny that the injustices to be overcome are monstrous and
widespread, tho they vary in frequency and intensity, just that the
terminology is problematic.

Hi,

I'm presuming that, although no such intention is attributable, my poem 'a
partial chrestomathy of naming spam' has been deemed to flout the list
guidelines. This could be either because of its length or its content.

I just wanted to assure you that the same post has passed with nothing but
benign commentaries on two similar lists for poetry. in fact it has
generated good discussion on the recent exponential increase in word sald
style spam, both for threads and names.

One or two folks had asked me why i hadn't sent it to Poetics and so i did,
but now maybe i realise why i hadn't done so initially. In fact a lot of
poets part names are used in the piece, as are other cultural workers and so
forth. Nothing stranger than the current computer-generated hybridisation of
naming was intended.

anyway

love and love
cris

the face in which epiphany is produced and which appeals to me, mirage
of breath, perhaps I am doing this for you, an epiphany. there is always
epiphany, talk, sleep, breath, 'a state of _phantasmic exaltation_ forms
the typical introduction of the organism from space, all breath and
exaltation.' the midst of the grasping, the organisms, saying, ending in
ellipsis ... and the exaltation of violence which makes a man, a man.
among those macroscopic moments of exaltation are emotions.

but it is this state, that of emotion and exaltation and perfect torture
and annihilation, the exaltation of love, ecriture feminin, that one ...
but the interior may be lifted into exaltation, this state, i have said to
you, this state of the organism, this epiphany when worlds ...

a temporal detumescence or slackening - an order associated, if you will,
with an end, the resulting detumescence partaking of defuge, exhaustive
ennui, out of exhaustion, out of irritation murmur, grappling with itself,
an 'awkward' tumescence ...

tumescence of the cloth, of burrowing.

swollen tumescences, convexities; meniscus lenses, sinusoidal meanderings:

Interesting this all. One thing, as far as I know, there are no Neanderthal
cave-paintings, evidence seems to suggest that they had a culture that was
sufficient to their environment but did not show development, Neanderthal
tools just stayed the same, generation after generation, like a monotonous
song. Literary depictions of Neanderthals hinge about the H.G.Wells story
'The Grisly Folk', where you have the picture of the bloody-cudgelled
caveman, and William Golding's 'The Inheritors', where you have its
antiphon, the sensitive (telepathic!) communal creatures hunted down by the
'Cro-Magnons', our ancestors. I'd imagine that meeting a Neanderthal would
be, well, very boring, boring because being a product of a stereotyped life
results in exactly that. It is interesting again to wander on the links
involved: monotonous repetitive labour results in mental stultification but
also +identification+ with the power structures that endorse such
conditions, as in the case of many of our politicians, produces the same
result. Same speech. Dead words. Those that have power to move, but are
themselves unmov'd etc. It reminded me too of an account I heard of peasant
labourers the other day, that like the grim mediaeval notions of Christ,
they never laughed. I am reminded too of the monotony of Sixties West Indian
music, before Bob Marley, with its same-same rhythms and base root rooting
at the seedtalk of humanity. Sex talk, yeah, and nothing more. And power, as
the detestable Kissinger said, is the ultimate aphrodisiac. NOT
intelligence. And power, which is the basis of social relations, seems to be
what the gender-talk thread has really been about, the distribution of power
among the social elite who are allowed to be seen as poets (there was that
lovely post, I can't remember who by, about the existence of poetry outside
the academic circuits, beautiful that). So, what do we have: romanticised
Neanderthals, Neanderthal and unromantic politicians, issues about
recognition in a world of tenures and appointments that is far removed from
the realities of life below, and the unexamined questions of speech - who
can speak, who is allowed to, who is enabled by their environments to do so?
Etc etc.

End of blah!

There's something that bothers me about this whole discussion, a kind of
specism which for me is a bit suspect. Very little is known about Nean-

any sort of judgement about a group of prehistoric hominids seems to me to
shift issues about race (and for that matter about 'weeds') onto a group

I wrote a lot of poems a number of years ago, and the style is quite
different from the way I write at the moment, I think - but I have
several friends who prefer the other writings (friends who are not
scholars), so I decided to go ahead and make another chapbook out
of some of those poems, and put it online in PDF format,
just for fun, like.

http://www.brentbechtel.com/series/burial_rites.pdf

The title of the book is, "Burial Rites of Love and Death"

It's around 40 poems or so.

As an experiment in seeing what cafepress.com's print quality is like, I
set up a shop here to buy a copy:

http://www.cafeshops.com/bbechtel

Of course, it's still free, above. I guess if you liked it a lot you could
buy a printed copy, though. It also has a pretty neat cover design by ...
me.

Two books in a week. August Highland's personas have nothing on me. Haha.

True, Alan, there is very little known about Neanderthals. What little is
known seems to suggest both a) high cranial capacity indicating potentially
high intelligence; b) a stereotyped tool-culture that shows little or no
development. The picture that comes across to me is a somewhat tragic one -
that of potentially highly intelligent beings whose lives were so restricted
by the harshness of their physical environment and the shortness of their
appallingly physically demanding lives that they were never able to become
what they could have been. Just a picture that, it's a sad one.

Just for the record, in my original post, I used "Neanderthalish" in the way
that it's used in popular American speech--a woman might say of a
particularly unrefined male, "Gah, what a /Neanderthal/."

So, that as opposed to the refined, fashion-conscious, eyebrow-waxing man of
today.

This places Neanderthals as having existed in great quantity as recently as
thirty years ago, and many of them had good jobs, large salaries, wrote
popular books and had triumphant funerals.

Q.  What is the meaning of what happened in Iowa?

A. Money matters!=20

In the real world, that's the place where people get paid because of =
sales revenues from products and services and not from tax dollars, =
grants, or parental  handouts, there is an adage:  Share of Voice equals =
share of market.  Loosely translated that means the more you spend on =
advertising to attract your customers the more customers you will =
capture in the market, the greater your share of market.  Kerry spent; =
Kerry; captured.                                                         =
                                                                         =
                                                                         =
                             tax e. =20

The anomaly, as far as I'm concerned, is the Edwards share of =
market...I'm still digging in to confirm the facts so I cannot attest to =
the validity of the numbers as of this writing, but it appears the big =
winners were Kerry, Edwards & Dean, whereas it appears the big spenders =
e.g. Share of Voice folks, were Kerry and Dean. =20

Conclusions:  Too soon to draw any.  But, not only may there be a huge =
hole in the bottom of the Dean Yacht, but also there may be a great big =
Sail on the spar of the Edward's little boat.=20

Hmmmm, Fancy that...=20

But on another front, similarly unimportant, what of Shrubs plan to =
retrain Americans? =20

Now there is a carefully devised, economically solid piece of =
legislative horseturds if ever I've read about one. =20

Let's examine the matter as if you were an American out of work:
1. you're a $56,000.00 a year professional with a masters degree in your =
technical field.
2. you have a family, a mortgage, a car payment, and two animals to =
support.
3. you lost your job in July of 2000 when your dot com CO. went belly =
up.
4. you've been unemployed since (and your unemployment benefits have =
long ago expired.)
5. your spouse, children, retirement fund and parents have been helping =
you hold ends together to keep you from losing your home and your two =
cars.
6. 75% of the jobs that existed in the USA prior to March of 2000 have =
already been moved to offshore sites in India, Pakistan, Korea and =
China...with China looming large on the horizon as the future benefactor =
of an additional 20% of the existing small manufacturing contracts =
currently being filled by U.S. mainland companies under contract to =
large manufactures for parts and service products.  =20
7. of the remaining 25% of those former jobs of 2000, 100% have been =
eliminated because of changes in either the product line or the =
technology of production. These jobs are gone forever.
8. additional employment opportunities that might be possible for =
infrastructure rework, remodel or replace within America itself are =
low-paying jobs that like the agri-based jobs that still remain with the =
country will probably be given to temporary alien laborers coming up =
from Mexico and South American nations.  =20

But, not to worry.  The president wants to retrain you.  He wants to =
make you a qualified laborer ready to compete in the world market.  What =
a great idea! =20

After you're retrained, say in software development, you can compete for =
jobs with those chaps in India IBM is about to hire at $12.50 per =
hour...Let's see how that calculates:
2080 hours of work in an average 40 hour week of a 52 week period times =
$12.50 means you can go to work for IBM (after you're retrained, of =
course) and expect to earn $26,000.00 a year (minus benefits, of =
course).  Wow, that's more than half of what you had earned in 2000, =
just before you lost your job.  If you subtract the COLA hits you missed =
during the six year period (two of the years are part of your new =
retraining program), you can see, your adjusted 2006 salary equates to =
approximately $19,000.00 in 2000 a.d. dollars.  WOW again.=20

Yep, no doubt about it...you're gonna be way ahead of the game if you =
stand behind the president and support his program.  I mean, $19,000.00 =
a year...whoa, that's a whole lot better than the $18,720.00 you could =
earn by busting your butt flippin burgers bfor $9.00 an hour at Burger =
King.  (Of course to draw the $9.00 an hour wage you'll have to be in =
mgmt and that means you'll be on salary and you'll actually probably =
work 50 hours a week for that wage, but it will be steady work.)    =20

So, what's the meaning of Iowa?  How's this: The president's treasure =
chest is filled with hundreds of millions.  That equates to a big share =
of voice come November. =20

UbuWeb is pleased to announce the reprint of Cornelius Cardew's, "Stockhausen Serves
Imperialism and other articles" (1974) The highly controversial collected Marxist
writings of British avant-garde composer Cornelius Cardew (1936-1981). Cardew, a one-time
assistant to Karlheinz Stockhausen and founder of The Scrach Orchestra, gradually moved
away from John Cage-inspired works toward radical Marxism. Long out of print,
"Stockhausen Serves Imperialism" contains "A History of the Scratch Orchestra" by Rod
Eley; "John Cage: Ghost or Monster?" by John Tilbury; and the following by Cardew:
"Stockhausen Serves Imperialism," "On Criticism," "A Critical Concert,"Self-Criticism:
Repudiation of Earlier Works," "Problems of Notation," and "Criticism of The Great
Learning."

MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="iso-8859-1"
Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable

Kirby and others re: patriarchy and matriarchy myths:

There are other, alternative and compelling argument(s) about patriarchy =
myths, Kirby. =20
You're probably already familiar with some of these theorists who have =
used extensive archeology to=20
explore the question whether "we" have always been "patriarchal," =
whether the patriarchy is genetically=20
determined, whether "we" have different histories.  Still, here are just =
a few links to just reviews of Eisler alone,=20
so the debate is still going on. =20

Many of the links no doubt lead to writers a lot of Listserv members =
have already read and digested. =20

Here's a sample of one of the essays regarding Gimbutas and her main =
detractor Cynthia Eller:=20

"The Furor over Gimbutas"

So polarized has this debate become that, as Wendy Griffin has observed, =
"[Gimbutas'] theories tend to be judged as either absolutely true or =
absolutely false..." It is impossible to mention her work in academia =
without being caught up in a heated dispute; a positive mention is =
immediately assumed to indicate total agreement with every =
interpretation Gimbutas ever wrote, and to warrant heated attack. In =
this charged atmosphere, the content of her work invariably gets lost, =
and the documentation she provided is never evaluated.


By any account, Marija Gimbutas had an illustrious career as a major =
20th-century archaeologist and a primary founder of modern Indo-European =
studies. She excavated sites of the Vinca, Starcevo, Karanovo and Sesklo =
cultures. Her ability to read sixteen European languages enabled to her =
to read virtually all the archaeological literature on both sides of the =
Cold War split, a crucial skill since most key publications in her study =
area were written in eastern European languages. (She translated many of =
them for Harvard University during her early years in the U.S.) It was =
Gimbutas who laid pivotal groundwork for integrating archaelogical data =
with linguistic studies of Indo-European origins. Her model for =
Indo-European origins is still the leading theory in the field. Its =
basic outlines are still upheld -- minus the Goddess interpretations -- =
by her former student J.P. Mallory, now one of the top authorities in =
the field.=20


Eller acknowledges the "tremendous linguistic expertise" Gimbutas =
possessed, and her "encyclopedic knowledge of Central and Eastern =
European archaeological sites that permitted her to speculate =
effectively on 'big picture' questions." However, she doesn't explore =
Gimburas' reasoning and completely sidesteps her heavily footnoted =
analysis of why she thinks the kurgan-builders were invaders, and why =
patriarchal. Eller never describes Gimbutas' analysis in its own right. =
Instead she uses a pastiche of descriptions by her detractors and =
supporters to assail it. She declines to compare the work of Gimbutas to =
theories of the archaeological establishment, claiming that it would be =
"ultimately unfair to all parties involved. There is no archaeological =
consensus..." and anyway, everyone has an agenda, even the =
traditionalist men. (No kidding, but what happened to the thorough =
debunking promised in the introduction?) Still, this author insists that =
the argument that IE spread from steppes through military conquest "is =
completely speculative."=20


At this point Eller resorts to outright misrepresentation. She writes, =
"As J.P. Mallory summarizes, 'almost all of the arguments for invasion =
and cultural transformations are far better explained without reference =
to Kurgan expansions'." Reading this came as a shock, because my =
understanding of Mallory's position is quite different. I had to look it =
up. Sure enough, he says the opposite: "One might at first imagine that =
the economy of argument involved with the Kurgan solution should oblige =
us to accept it outright. But critics do exist and their objections can =
be summarized quite simply --" and here follows the phrase Eller so =
misleadingly cites.=20

1) Goddesses and Gods of Old Europe, 6500-3500 BC: Myths & Cult Images =
<http://erclk.about.com/?zi=3D9/1Wh>
A beautifully-illustrated book about the images of goddesses and other =
feminine themes in Old Europe, as interpreted by Marija Gimbutas. People =
of prehistory did not leave us written records to judge their culture, =
so we have to interpret the drawings, sculptures and religious figures =
that survive. Is Gimbutas convincing in her theories about a =
woman-centered culture? Judge for yourself.
<http://erclk.about.com/?zi=3D9/1Wh><http://erclk.about.com/?zi=3D9/1Wh>

2) The Myth of Matriarchal Prehistory =
<http://erclk.about.com/?zi=3D9/1V2>
Cynthia Eller, in this book first published in 2000, takes on the =
"evidence" for matriarchy and woman-centered prehistory, and finds it a =
myth. Her account of how the ideas came to be widely believed is itself =
an example of historical analysis. Eller maintains that the gender =
stereotyping and the "invented past" are not helpful to promoting a =
feminist future.
<http://erclk.about.com/?zi=3D9/1V2><http://erclk.about.com/?zi=3D9/1V2>

3) Woman the Gatherer <http://erclk.about.com/?zi=3D9/1[o>
Francis Dahlberg carefully analyzed evidence for the diets of =
prehistorical humans, and concluded that most of our ancestors' food was =
plant food, and meat was often scavenged. Why does this matter? It =
contradicts the traditional "man the hunter" as the primary provider, =
and woman the gatherer may have had a bigger role in support of early =
human life.
<http://erclk.about.com/?zi=3D9/1[o><http://erclk.about.com/?zi=3D9/1[o>

4) Women's Work: The First 20,000 Years =
<http://erclk.about.com/?zi=3D9/km>
Subtitled "Women, Cloth and Society in Early Times." Author Elizabeth =
Wayland Barber studied surviving samples of ancient cloth, reproduced =
the techniques used to make them, and argues that women's ancient role =
in making cloth and clothing made them crucial to the economic systems =
of their world.
<http://erclk.about.com/?zi=3D9/km><http://erclk.about.com/?zi=3D9/km>

5) Engendering Archaeology: Women and Prehistory =
<http://erclk.about.com/?zi=3D9/3qI>
Editors Joan M. Gero and Margaret W. Conkey have assembled =
anthropological and archeological studies of the male/female division of =
labor, worship of goddesses and other gender relations in an excellent =
example of applying feminist theory to fields often dominated by male =
perspectives.
<http://erclk.about.com/?zi=3D9/3qI><http://erclk.about.com/?zi=3D9/3qI>

6) Reader in Gender Archaeology <http://erclk.about.com/?zi=3D9/3KX>
Kelley Ann Hays-Gilpin and David S. Whitley have assembled articles in =
this 1998 volume to explore the issues in "gender archeology." =
Archeology requires conclusions for often-ambiguous evidence, and =
"gender archeology" explores the ways in which gender-based assumptions =
may influence those conclusions.
<http://erclk.about.com/?zi=3D9/3KX><http://erclk.about.com/?zi=3D9/3KX>

7) Warrior Women: An Archaeologist's Search for History's Hidden =
Heroines <http://erclk.about.com/?zi=3D9/2wb>
Jeannine Davis-Kimball, Ph.D., writes of her work studying the =
archeology and anthropology of Eurasian nomads. Has she discovered the =
Amazons of ancient stories? Were these societies matrifocal and =
egalitarian? What about goddesses? She also tells of her life of an =
archeologist - she's been called a female Indiana Jones.
<http://erclk.about.com/?zi=3D9/2wb><http://erclk.about.com/?zi=3D9/2wb>

8) When God Was a Woman <http://erclk.about.com/?zi=3D9/2Mn>
Drawing on the work of Gimbutas and feminist archeology, Merlin Stone =
has written of the lost past of woman-centered societies worshipping =
goddesses and honoring women, before the guns and power of the =
patriarchal Indo Europeans overwhelmed them. A very popular account of =
women's prehistory -- archeology with poetry, perhaps.
<http://erclk.about.com/?zi=3D9/2Mn><http://erclk.about.com/?zi=3D9/2Mn>

9) The Chalice and the Blade: Our History, Our Future =
<http://erclk.about.com/?zi=3D9/3RL>
Many women and men, after reading Riane Eisler's 1988 book, find =
themselves inspired to recreate a lost equality between men and women =
and a peaceful future. Study groups have sprung up, goddess worship has =
been encouraged, and the book remains among the most read on this topic.
<http://erclk.about.com/?zi=3D9/3RL><http://erclk.about.com/?zi=3D9/3RL>

10) The Hebrew Goddess <http://erclk.about.com/?zi=3D9/2[b>
Raphael Patai's classic book on Biblical study and archeology has been =
expanded, still with the purpose of retrieving ancient and medieval =
goddesses and mythical women within Judaism. The Hebrew scriptures often =
mention worship of goddesses; later images of Lillith and Shekina have =
been part of Jewish practice.

JUST BUFFALO CHOOSES BOOKER PRIZE-WINNING NOVEL, THE GOD OF SMALL THINGS
FOR 2004 IF ALL OF BUFFALO READ THE SAME BOOK

BUFFALO – Just Buffalo Literary Center has chosen The God of Small
Things, by Arundhati Roy, as the centerpiece of its 4th If All Buffalo
Read The Same Book program, which will culminate in a two-day author’s
visit on September 8-9, 2004. The God of Small Things won the 1997
Booker Prize for literature, Great Britain’s highest literary honor.
Arundhati Roy became the first non-expatriate Indian author and the
first Indian woman to win the award. The New York Times called the book
“dazzling” and “remarkable,” while the Washington post noted, “It’s hard
to avoid using words like ‘splendid’ and ‘stunning’ to describe this
debut novel.”

Set in Kerala, India in the 1960s, The God of Small Things is about two
children, the two-egg twins Estha and Rahel, and the shocking
consequences of a pivotal event in their young lives, the accidental
death-by-drowning of a visiting English cousin. In magical and poetic
language, the novel paints a vivid picture of life in a small rural
Indian town, the thoughts and feelings of the two small children, and
the complexity and hypocrisy of the adults in their world. It is also a
poignant lesson in the destructive power of India’s caste system, and
moral and political bigotry.

Arundhati Roy was born in 1961 in Kerala. Her mother, a prominent social
activist, founded an independent school and taught her daughter
informally. At sixteen she left home, and enrolled at the Delhi School
of Architecture. She left the trade after a few years to work on
projects for the screen, writing for TV and movies, neither of which
brought her great success. She then published a criticism of the
acclaimed film, "Bandit Queen"; the controversy that followed resulted
in a lawsuit against her. Since the publication of The God of Small
Things, Roy has put her talents and status to use as an activist,
publishing exclusively political essays, talks and interviews on topics
ranging from dam-building in India to the war on Iraq.

Media, book clubs, organizations, educators, public officials and
individuals who would like more information or a reader's guide, as well
as those interested in sponsorship, can contact Just Buffalo at 832-5400
or by writing info@justbuffalo.org.

I've been trying to behave and keep quite about this stuff, but I need to
make this point: I think it may have more to do with the type of poetry
we're looking at. I worry about the extent to which avant-garde poetry is a
more "male" phenomenon than other types of poetry (perhaps because of the
implied war metaphors?). That is, we often consider bad poetry to be both
"weak" and "sentimental," which are both stereotypically gendered accusations.

When I was marching in protest of the war in Iraq here in Boston around
Copley square, I was surprised to suddenly find myself acting very butch,
and I wondered why this was. I tried doing chants that weren't so butch,
and they came out campy. There's a way in which political and poetic
combativeness, even liberal combativeness, lends itself to stereotypically
male behavior.

I realize that this is gender & doesn't explain the distribution of sexes
that we're discussing per se., but once I look outside Silliman's category
of "post-avant," contemporary American poetry starts to look a lot more
like a female-dominated art form. Is there a way we can fix this, by
tracing the sources of our own aesthetics back to more female modernists
and surrealists, & making those figures more prominent in the history of
avant-garde poetry?

On the issue of patriarchy, I think we do indeed live in a patriarchal
society, and I think it's worth noting that a lot of women outside academia
support or buy into this system in important ways. Of course I agree that
patriarchy is bad bad bad, but it might also be worth looking at why it's
so seductive for these women to continue to invest in that system, because
we're not going to create change without their help, and that's a class
issue in itself.

Subject: Re: Discrepancies

I agree with Max that Noah's numbers are extremely
problematic and unreliable.

In college, they used to talk about "Rocks for Jocks"
(geology courses dumbed down to get the sports
scholarship students through science requirements) and
--"Poets' Math."

Noah's numbers, upon closer inspection, belie the
implied moral he draws from them, I believe.  They may
show the ~opposite~ of what's being read into them.

What they show is a "patriarchal society" where

~over a quarter~ of the journals counted (8 out of 30)
  either include male/female authors' names in equal
numbers or where there are more female names than
male.

How insidiously patriarchal is over a quarter
egalitarian/female majority?

And, if you accept, as I would, that a range of 54%
male/46% female to 57% male/43% female is ~quite good~
for a patriarchal society (and that the standard error
of Noah's numbers alone may account for that
difference, since, as Anthony Robinson pointed out,
there is miscounting involved),--- then almost half
(43%) of the journals show equal numbers, more females
than males, or that narrow 55.5%-to-44.5% difference.


If, as some editors have been attesting, submissions
themselves are weighted toward about 70% male, then
journals are ~mis~-representative in doing better than
those realities.

All that ~Affirmative Action~ asks, by law, is that a
workplace ~meet~ the distribution of the general
population, within any particular field.   If women
are only 1% of the general population for, say,
butchers, then one percent hired ~satisfies~
Affirmative Action.

~Being and Nothingness~ defines "bad faith" as the
x-that-is-more-than-y: "the love that is more than
love"; the waiter who is more than a waiter.

By trying to ~do better~ than a 70%/30% ratio that the
actual submissions consist of, things are entering
into The Action That Is ~More Affirmative Than~
Affirmative Action.

There are fields where the male/female-female/male
ratio differs.  Pool halls are disproportionately
male.  Manicure parlors are disproportionately female.


It may very well be the case that experimental poetry
is a game that most women are ~too smart~ to play.

Or, as Mark pointed out, that most female first name
poets have gone over to "School of Quietude" journals.



Regardless, attempts to reconstruct Noah's numbers by
checking on-line table of contents for the issues
involve show a very different picture.  Noah and Sara
were (excluding translators, many of whom were female
but) counting ~every~ name in the table of contents,
and conflating poets with essayists, short story
writers, reviewers, and ---Dead White Males like
~Catullus~ and ~Tristan Tzara!~ whose moldering
antiquity places them in a completely separate
category, I would say, that doesn't represent some
sort of place-in-the-sun-stealing threat to ~anybody.~
  Within those different sub-groups, the imbalance for,
say, short story writers (at a glance) is vastly more
weighted toward males than for poets.  This further
distorts the numbers.


When Max says, "Rather than counting the  number of
poets, why not count the number of pages those poets'
work takes up? But then the question arises: why do so
much counting?",---

I'd take him one step further: why not count ~the
number of letters in the authors' names~

and whether male/female falls on odd/even pages?

Unanalyzed, unsystematized, uncrunched numbers left in
and of themselves as though they were in scare quotes
show nothing.  More impression-biassing to Noah's
presentation is the ~anecdote~ that he lays out at the
beginning ("my partner, the poet Sara Veglahn, had
perused it's pages for a while. . . . the first thing
she said was"). It's that that skews a narrative onto
those mute and arguable numbers, ---or leads the
un-statistics-minded to just glaze out entirely at
their cacaphonous jumble.  (Excuse my cynicism,
please: "the first thing she said was",--- as if
Diotima herself had appeared at the end of Plato to
bring Socrates the truth!)  The gratuitous framing of
these questions in heterodominant self-portraiture
does not add to their believability, for me.  Taking a
tattooed War of The Sexes that may exist in your
apartment out onto the Poetics List is only a
re-inscribing of gender onto sex from the personal
sphere into the public.

Who ever told you you were a man in the first place?!
(and so redundantly: "a man ( or as the particular
'man' that I am)")


Maybe because he's so busy counting out that wad of
fifties I threw on the bed, My Last Hustler can't find
even ~one~ male prostitute in those journals, Noah.

(He only counts ~inches!~)



. . . Which of the following, two, "equally good" poem
excerpts should not have been published in ~26: issue
B,~ on the basis that its author has a male name?

2

scripted tolerance
compensators were not
summarized in the
final report

rectangular volume object
had all faces in

to be all other sides

What does the sex of an author ~signify~ in a dominant
style of writing that is, for the most part, based on
dispensing with all the biographical markers of the
author?

To quote the poet Sara Veglahn's poem, "The lakes
unsafe . . .", from that same issue:

      "It is likely ~I~ will be lost"

(my emphasis).  Is the word "breast" ("breast wove w
winter-cure mustard) more female when Geraldine Monk
uses it, than when Valerie Coulton contaminates
~l'ecriture feminine~ by collaborating with Ed
Smallfield on the line "a year of breasts and
cigarettes", in the same issue?

If there are questions here, the biggest question is:
what vestigial relevance to the reading of a poem does
author's sex, race, economic status, sexual
preference, or whatever have when those poems have
completely foreclosed all those identity politics?

Lots of great stuff here, Tim.  I love when people say they "worry" about =
"the extent to which avant-garde poetry is a male phenomenon" etc.  I =
never worry about things like that.  I won't take time right now to tell =
you what I do worry about.

I also love what you say about macho war protests.  I think you're dead on =
here (though I do have echoes of minxish chants from the eighties in =
London: "Limp-wristed something something nancy-boys --YAY!"  I'm sure =
someone can fill in the blanks).

I don't really agree with you that women buy into patriarchal systems, =
including academia.  It's true in a way.  But the currency ain't minted =
which allows women, or anyone, to buy *out* of these systems.  Women are =
just as embedded in and composed of them as anyone else.  There's no easy =
passage out.  I don't think you can bribe someone or even take a solitary =
(or group) stand.  Time and slow hoeing is the way to go.

I've been trying to behave and keep quite about this stuff, but I need to
make this point: I think it may have more to do with the type of poetry
we're looking at. I worry about the extent to which avant-garde poetry is =
a
more "male" phenomenon than other types of poetry (perhaps because of the
implied war metaphors?). That is, we often consider bad poetry to be both
"weak" and "sentimental," which are both stereotypically gendered =
accusations.

When I was marching in protest of the war in Iraq here in Boston around
Copley square, I was surprised to suddenly find myself acting very butch,
and I wondered why this was. I tried doing chants that weren't so butch,
and they came out campy. There's a way in which political and poetic
combativeness, even liberal combativeness, lends itself to stereotypically
male behavior.

I realize that this is gender & doesn't explain the distribution of sexes
that we're discussing per se., but once I look outside Silliman's category
of "post-avant," contemporary American poetry starts to look a lot more
like a female-dominated art form. Is there a way we can fix this, by
tracing the sources of our own aesthetics back to more female modernists
and surrealists, & making those figures more prominent in the history of
avant-garde poetry?

On the issue of patriarchy, I think we do indeed live in a patriarchal
society, and I think it's worth noting that a lot of women outside =
academia
support or buy into this system in important ways. Of course I agree that
patriarchy is bad bad bad, but it might also be worth looking at why it's
so seductive for these women to continue to invest in that system, because
we're not going to create change without their help, and that's a class
issue in itself.

Subject: Re: Discrepancies

I agree with Max that Noah's numbers are extremely
problematic and unreliable.

In college, they used to talk about "Rocks for Jocks"
(geology courses dumbed down to get the sports
scholarship students through science requirements) and
--"Poets' Math."

Noah's numbers, upon closer inspection, belie the
implied moral he draws from them, I believe.  They may
show the ~opposite~ of what's being read into them.

What they show is a "patriarchal society" where

~over a quarter~ of the journals counted (8 out of 30)
  either include male/female authors' names in equal
numbers or where there are more female names than
male.

How insidiously patriarchal is over a quarter
egalitarian/female majority?

And, if you accept, as I would, that a range of 54%
male/46% female to 57% male/43% female is ~quite good~
for a patriarchal society (and that the standard error
of Noah's numbers alone may account for that
difference, since, as Anthony Robinson pointed out,
there is miscounting involved),--- then almost half
(43%) of the journals show equal numbers, more females
than males, or that narrow 55.5%-to-44.5% difference.


If, as some editors have been attesting, submissions
themselves are weighted toward about 70% male, then
journals are ~mis~-representative in doing better than
those realities.

All that ~Affirmative Action~ asks, by law, is that a
workplace ~meet~ the distribution of the general
population, within any particular field.   If women
are only 1% of the general population for, say,
butchers, then one percent hired ~satisfies~
Affirmative Action.

~Being and Nothingness~ defines "bad faith" as the
x-that-is-more-than-y: "the love that is more than
love"; the waiter who is more than a waiter.

By trying to ~do better~ than a 70%/30% ratio that the
actual submissions consist of, things are entering
into The Action That Is ~More Affirmative Than~
Affirmative Action.

There are fields where the male/female-female/male
ratio differs.  Pool halls are disproportionately
male.  Manicure parlors are disproportionately female.


It may very well be the case that experimental poetry
is a game that most women are ~too smart~ to play.

Or, as Mark pointed out, that most female first name
poets have gone over to "School of Quietude" journals.



Regardless, attempts to reconstruct Noah's numbers by
checking on-line table of contents for the issues
involve show a very different picture.  Noah and Sara
were (excluding translators, many of whom were female
but) counting ~every~ name in the table of contents,
and conflating poets with essayists, short story
writers, reviewers, and ---Dead White Males like
~Catullus~ and ~Tristan Tzara!~ whose moldering
antiquity places them in a completely separate
category, I would say, that doesn't represent some
sort of place-in-the-sun-stealing threat to ~anybody.~
  Within those different sub-groups, the imbalance for,
say, short story writers (at a glance) is vastly more
weighted toward males than for poets.  This further
distorts the numbers.


When Max says, "Rather than counting the  number of
poets, why not count the number of pages those poets'
work takes up? But then the question arises: why do so
much counting?",---

I'd take him one step further: why not count ~the
number of letters in the authors' names~

and whether male/female falls on odd/even pages?

Unanalyzed, unsystematized, uncrunched numbers left in
and of themselves as though they were in scare quotes
show nothing.  More impression-biassing to Noah's
presentation is the ~anecdote~ that he lays out at the
beginning ("my partner, the poet Sara Veglahn, had
perused it's pages for a while. . . . the first thing
she said was"). It's that that skews a narrative onto
those mute and arguable numbers, ---or leads the
un-statistics-minded to just glaze out entirely at
their cacaphonous jumble.  (Excuse my cynicism,
please: "the first thing she said was",--- as if
Diotima herself had appeared at the end of Plato to
bring Socrates the truth!)  The gratuitous framing of
these questions in heterodominant self-portraiture
does not add to their believability, for me.  Taking a
tattooed War of The Sexes that may exist in your
apartment out onto the Poetics List is only a
re-inscribing of gender onto sex from the personal
sphere into the public.

Who ever told you you were a man in the first place?!
(and so redundantly: "a man ( or as the particular
'man' that I am)")


Maybe because he's so busy counting out that wad of
fifties I threw on the bed, My Last Hustler can't find
even ~one~ male prostitute in those journals, Noah.

(He only counts ~inches!~)



. . . Which of the following, two, "equally good" poem
excerpts should not have been published in ~26: issue
B,~ on the basis that its author has a male name?

What does the sex of an author ~signify~ in a dominant
style of writing that is, for the most part, based on
dispensing with all the biographical markers of the
author?

To quote the poet Sara Veglahn's poem, "The lakes
unsafe . . .", from that same issue:

      "It is likely ~I~ will be lost"

(my emphasis).  Is the word "breast" ("breast wove w
winter-cure mustard) more female when Geraldine Monk
uses it, than when Valerie Coulton contaminates
~l'ecriture feminine~ by collaborating with Ed
Smallfield on the line "a year of breasts and
cigarettes", in the same issue?

If there are questions here, the biggest question is:
what vestigial relevance to the reading of a poem does
author's sex, race, economic status, sexual
preference, or whatever have when those poems have
completely foreclosed all those identity politics?
("his or her asteroid" ---Hung Q. Tu, in the ~Aufgabe~
that Noah counts)


Interestingly, ---and as paradoxical as it sounds---
those numbers show a ~negative correlation~ between
the size of the journal and the number of ~both~ male
(-.80) and female (-.47) authors' names.

You're probably right.  I've been very influenced by my study of metaphor, =
example, and categories in general: how they become established and how =
change occurs.  I came to an appreciation of convention, chiefly on the =
grounds of its being, or WHAT IS.
In a sense I suppose I came to an appreciation of the Lowest Common =
Denominator too.  The limits of a thing twinkle with possibility but =
convention is also a constructive thing.  I'm sorry if this is incomprehens=
ible: I should be ashamed to say that much of my philosophy is founded on =
my study of figures, but so it has been until recently.  I am aware of my =
own position, which is closer to hyphenation than anarchism.  I'd like to =
hear more about what you say.=20

This redefinition is a wonderful goal. But actually to achieve it
would be more disruptive to the avant status quo than your comment
seems to anticipate....It would require having to redefine modernism
and surrealism, let alone post-avant. . .

For example,  "Modernism," pretty much defined in opposition to the
female voice from inception ("this ends the idea of poetry for
ladies!"  "Hold on to your hats, ladies!'  Etc!) is already beginning
to be redefined, by scholars such as Suzanne Clark.  The resulting
new view of modernism includes writers who embody exactly what the
line of post-Romantic Power Poetry, culminating in the current
post-avant, has defined itself in opposition to for decades (such as
Millay)....Yet this odd-looking new view might well present a useful
picture of what modernism was, or meant, in a larger context-- as
opposed to the usual picture of what the couple of white guys who
grabbed the label for themselves and their friends and then shut
their eyes to everyone else seems to have wished it meant.--

To actually alter these movement definitions so they become more
truly inclusive, not just limited to the core group of guys and a few
token females, will not be as simple as finding a few "good" females
to look back to but will instead poses an uncomfortable kind of a
logical fallacy, like John Hollander saying that when minority poets
write "good poems" then he will pay attention to their work, but of
course the definition of a "good poet" has been made in order to
leave out minority poets.

To do the task right would need to amount to the dismantling of a
self-fulfilling prophecy, assuming that, as it seems and as you
imply, the current definition of a modernist, an avant-gardist, etc.
has a built-in tendency to leave out female or female-identified
poets. In fact, the same process is now happening with Romanticism as
well--poets (mostly women) who were long considered to be "outside"
of Romanticism are now being defined as Romantic and in the process
are expanding the definition of Romanticism. And no doubt in another
halfcentury, hard-working critics will need do the same thing for the
post-avant. It would be nice if we did things differently at the
beginning of movements, so that our work wouldn't have to be torn
apart and rebuilt all over again a  generation or two later.   Who's
holding their breath? not me.

Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

I was interested in this discussion of neanderthals.  I think one thing that
might link a lot of these discussions is binaries and then the borderland
between.  This is what the eco-critics are calling the liminal area between
genres, similar to the liminal area between different eco-systems.  Hedgelines,
borders of forests, this sort of place tends to have more food than other areas
and is therefore very heavily populated if I understand what I've been reading.

The area between men & women (hermaphrodites) -- tends to create extremely
fruitful discussion.

Corso was extremely interested in liminal boundaries and often wrote about
creatures that go between.  Frankenstein.  Goth kids.  This area of ambiguity is
a good area for poetry.  What's settled is uninteresting, but what's unsettling
isn't.

In his book Herald of the Autochthonic Spirit Corso has a three-page length poem
entitled, "In Praise of Neanderthal Man."

In a birth old and horrendous
I heard in a basement in a dream
the birth-scream of mothers
bounce off the walls of sooty coves and bins

and saw there white-gowned doctors
yanking goat-legg'd infants
from out torturous vulvas

...................................................

2 pgs. later, poem ends --

Know this about that hoary brutish
bow-legg'd miserable toiler
who to this day is deemed a stupid thing
unfit for survival
you who claim his seed died with him
nor ever did associate (much less copulate)
with such heir as Cro-Mag, son of bear
-- to you I say Neanderthal
himself knew to sing
inventor of the churinga
(first musical instrument)
able to make the air ring
I say to you you can separate
the yolk from the white of the egg
yet without the one
the other is none
-- so again unto you I say O thou bigot anthropology
deem not Sir Neanderthal a stupid thing
all milk and no cream
in his time
     throughout the world
          he was philosoph supreme



I don't know whether this creature lived under a matriarchy or a patriarchy -- as
Mark said last evening these systems are not usually strictly dichotomous.  Corso
himself used to talk about the he-she (to my shame he considered me to be one) as
the course of the future.

As for the stupid bigot anthropology -- most anthropologists consider the early
work of Gimbutas to be sound, but the later work to be quite suspect.  What's
really suspect is the new age and 70s feminist appropriation of that work.  We
tend to put things into categories.  Matriarchal/patriarchal.  Bachofen did very
good work for his time -- he was cited by Engels, Nietzsche, and later by
Bataille, Klossowski and many many others.  He's the foundation of matriarchal
myth theory in our time.  He sees matriarchy as based on desire, and patriarchy
as based on principles.  He's mostly writing about the Greeks.  I don't think he
touches upon Turkish symbolsm.  He deals with Roman funeral statuary.  He's very
suggestive and poetic writer.  But poetry is what's outside of categories, or
moves between them -- or somehow unsettles our categories, and causes shifts, or
deterritorializes.  Bachofen is very suggestive in this way, which is why his
work is still alive and in print.  He teases open things that can only be
half-seen and almost makes sense of them.  In this sense the better theorists and
poets have something in common.  There's an area between principles and pure
empiricism that is shifting and curious.  Neanderthals did have principles.  They
buried their dead.

How simple were Neanderthals -- Corso writes --

Yet unlike their brain-sucking forebears
and the soon to come Alpine eater of bears
they bound their dead with beast gut
from feet to head
lest the ghost escape
(first record of magic date)
and buried them beneath the ground
upon which they slept and ate

(pp. 43-45 -- Herald of the Autochthonic Spirit -- Corso)

Yes, but the question seems posed today as if it hasn't been posed before.
What about the attempt, in the 1980's, primarily centered around the
journal HOW(ever) that presented a great deal of women's work that might be
considered "post-avant," and argued for a more inclusive project of the
post-modern. What about other such attempts? There are certainly many who
have worked for decades at a "redefinition" similar to that of which you
speak. I tend to work from a certain assumption that this redefinition is
ongoing, and I hope my work (in various areas) is a part of it.

Tim-

The great part about your post, & I think this is key- you're questioning
your combativeness. Is it a "stereotypical male behavior" issue? Is it a
"crowds & power" issue? Are you "being butch" for purposes of liberation, or
oppression? Where is this combativeness directed?

Don't discount your righteous anger in the face of an outrageous imperial
policy. Many women I've seen/known at anti-war rallies have been "butch" in
voicing their dissent, with little time for gentler and/or campier
expressions.

As far as the "post-avant" as a male phenomenon, I have to disagree. Most of
the interesting "post-avant" poets writing under 40 are women. Increasingly,
they are editing magazines & running presses.  I don't see this as an issue
ten years from now. And the history will take care of itself.

The on-line project I'm working on, "The Silence of Sasquatch," is about the
liminal area between animals and humans, and this of course harks back to
before the Paleolithic. The "gray area," from which we emerged. Or did we?

It's been ages since I read it, but how does the work of Gilbert and Gubar
fit in there?  (No Man's Land, The Madwoman in the Attic, &c). And I have
this great anthology edited by Bonnie Kime Scott called The Gender of
Modernism which, drawing on that work, argues that modernism was inflected
by theories and questioning of gender from the beginning, some of them
ignored because they were heavily coded to pass various censors of self and
society.  The problem on the whole is not the movements in themselves but
their later critical rendering, and the editing out of certain parts of it
in favour of those monologic (male) manifesti.  "Modernism as caught in the
net of gender is polyphonic, mobile, interactive, sexually charged; it has
wide appeal, constituting a historic shift in parameters."

What?
Well, I once heard, at a Japanese restaurant, Kenner say that there
were no women Modernists. Later he said that V. Woolf was not a
Modernist, and I can see arguments both ways on that. But I used to
lament that while Modernist writing was done by a lot of women
(Stein, H.D., Moore, many more), and that any Modernist anthology
would be packed with women's writing, Barnard, Niedecker, Loy,
Barnes) , have a look at the Donald Allen anthology.

Conservative group quietly drops plans for poll
Christopher Curtis, Gay.com / PlanetOut.com Network
Thursday, January 22, 2004 / 05:40 PM


The conservative American Family Association (AFA) said it will not
take the results of its marriage poll to Capitol Hill after a majority
of respondents favored same-sex marriage, according to a Thursday
report in Wired News.

The AFA posted the poll online in December with a stated intention to
forward the results to Congress as evidence of U.S. opposition to
same-sex marriage. Respondents could select one of these three choices:

"I favor legalization of homosexual marriage."

"I favor a 'civil union' with the full benefits of marriage except for
the name."

"I oppose legalization of homosexual marriage and 'civil unions.'"

But as of press time, the numbers support same-sex unions: Sixty
percent favored same-sex marriage and 8 percent favored civil unions,
leaving just 32 percent opposed.

AFA representative Buddy Smith complained to Wired News: "It just so
happens that homosexual activist groups around the country got a hold
of the poll -- it was forwarded to them -- and they decided to have a
little fun, and turn their organizations around the country (on to) the
poll to try to cause it to represent something other than what we
wanted it to. And so far, they succeeded with that."

Matt Foreman, the Executive Director of the National Gay and Lesbian
Taskforce was dumbfounded. "The abject hypocrisy of these people never
ceases to amaze me," he exclaimed.

"They constantly manipulate facts, and when things don't work out as
they want, they run to mama and whine."

On Jan. 6, the Gay.com/PlanetOut.com Network discussed the AFA poll
with expert Bob Witeck, who said that since it was not a scientific
survey, its results could not be considered meaningful data. According
to Witeck, legitimate polls show support for gay marriage somewhere
between 40 to 50 percent -- and growing.

Again, re: Neanderthal - I find these approaches specism to the extent
that they might not at all have been "tragic"; there is still debate in
fact as to their mixing with other hominid populations. As far as their
culture being stagnant - there is hardly enough evidence, and how does one
judge a culture 'stagnant'? Were the Tasmanian native peoples stagnant
because they showed little development over thousands of years in material
culture? Hardly. This is also a judgement based on a misplaced concept of
progress - as if cultures must 'grow,' decline, etc.

We absolutely _must_ recognize species equivalence if the world is to
survive in its richness. There are no weeds, no vermin, no necessarily
doomed species, no tragic species, no primitive species, none living
beyond their time. Live with them.

Buddy Smith's explanation is hilarious.
Same kind of folks d'USA seem not want to have direct elections in Iraq -
might not "get the results they want."
Now I remember Florida - thank goodness the Supreme Court stepped in to get
the results "they wanted."

Now with a little bit of anonymous "software corruption" Prez B will be with
us another 4.

We need a correction here. Hope the old American backbone is getting up,
ready to fight, resist, insist, etc.

Thanks for posting, S

A quick note to encourage any of you in San Francisco this Friday to
come to the second night of Small Press Traffic’s Poet’s Theater
Jamboree.  Last Friday’s opener featured a terrific line-up of short
plays, each of which crossed the wires between poetry & theater in ways
that made the language spark.

Laynie Brown’s “Zoanthella and Zoanthina: Tribulations of the Larval
Anemone Princess” gave the exotic argot of marine biology a lush
late-Victorian twist to question the biological distinctions between
sexes and genders, along with the reproductive roles that allegedly come
with each.  The dreamy costumes by Susan Sanford made this play hands
down the most visually striking of the night.

kari edwards’s “An Opera: Gertrude Stein in C*” brought out the purely
sonic delights of everyday language with the help of the massive
Gertrude Stein Vocal Ensemble.  Their cross-current of repeated lines,
“conducted” by Maggie Zurawski tapping members on the shoulder with a
stick while intoning the words “Gertrude Stein,” showed with wit and
skill how relevant Stein’s legacy is to the present.  And how
yesteryear’s avant garde can triumph to become the chamber music of the
future.

Brent Cunningham introduced a “lecture” by one Professor Daniil Kharms,
a sputtering and hilariously unreliable expert on six false anecdotes
from the life of Pushkin. His send-up of the lecture podium, where a
glitch with the slides forced the Professor to conflate anecdotes from
his own life with those of Pushkin’s, brought to mind Cunningham’s
readings earlier this year, where the amphitheater and the poetry
lectern—two other public spaces that ritualize the privacies of
inwardness and sincerity —get an equally brilliant skewering.  Seek
Brent’s work out—he’s the Obi Wan Kenobi of contemporary satire.

My own “Road to Inner Houston” I’ll pass over in silence, except to say
that poets Del Ray Cross and Sean Finney, along with Alexander Lewis and
Stephen Jacob from San Francisco’s foolsFURY theater company, did an
outstanding job of staging the thing.

The highlight of the night had to be Kevin Killian’s valiant on-the-fly
world premiere production of Jack Spicer’s “Troilus.” Even in this
excerpted form, Spicer’s depth and ambition in retrofitting the Troilus
& Cressida story to the Cold War psycho-sexual anxieties of 1955 came
through.  I especially admired how Spicer went beyond a glib
condemnation of war (though it’s certainly that) to probe the eroticism
of Death—the eternal, undifferentiated, oceanic God-like One—that’s both
its cause and its product.  Can’t wait to see the entire play in print.

Don’t miss tomorrow’s performance at the CCA’s San Francisco campus!
See the www.sptraffic.org for program & details.

I don't know a resource, but Edwin Torres comes to mind immediately as an
experimental Latino poet.  I also love the work of Martin Espada (sp?) buyt
he isn't experimental.  I'm sure the list can come up with many more names.
Right now I have some in mind that I can't actually remmeber the names

I really should add that the cast for Spicer's "Troilus" did an amazing
job on very short notice.  Thank you Kevin Killian, WAyne Smith, David
Larsen, Tiff Dressen, Taylor Brady, John Sakkis, Andrew Joron, Garrett
Caples and Jocelyn Saidenberg for bringing a great piece of writing to

Essential software for Windows - for codework/'experimental' work/ etc.



Yesterday we were at the LinuxWorld convention; at the Free Software
Foundation booth I bought Dan Hagerty, Melissa Weisshaus, and Eli
Zaretskii, Gnu Software for MS-Windows and MS-DOS. This book, published in
2001, contains a cdrom developed for MS-Windows up through NT. I asked if
the software would work on WinXP; the people at the booth didn't know.

Well, it does. It works for Win3.0 up through current. And it's amazing -
a close-to-full suite of linux commands that works in Windows. This isn't
linux; it's a port. Commands and programs include emacs, fold, cut, od,
split, csplit, mv, cp, ls, grep, sed, awk, egrep, gawk, cat, tac, a
version of vi, gimp, etc. Two shells are also included; I'm using bash in
Windows! There is enough material here for a full programming and text
writing/development environment. It's incredible - something I've been
looking for, for a long time. If you are working with codework, writing
experimental work, I think these programs are essential.

There are some tricks - if you do install, back-channel me, and I can tell
you how, for example, to configure bash (which you'll want to do).

I'm now working on a selection of my work for publication; the following
was done entirely in the DOS shell.

Some other packages - mutt, shutdown (it works, and weirdly!), chmod,
chown, chgrp, Groff, RCS, man, make, more, less, shell utilities, TEX,
head, tail, uniq, DJGPP/GCC (compiler) and other programming tools.
(All the flags work too.)

Again - these are unix/linux commands that run in the terminal window of
windows _without_ changing the operating system or isolating a directory.
I can type 'shell' (thanks to a shell.bat I set up) anywhere in Windows
and go immediately to a linux shell emulation. The result of all of this -
I can work back and forth between my linux desktop and my WinXP OS without
changing formats, etc.

The book and disk costs $35 - well worth it.

Without a Neanderthal to discuss this with, Alan, we are all indulging in
speculation. You quite rightly said that very little is known about the
Neanderthals. I do, though, find labels like 'specist' troubling, there's
quite enough substitution of thought by applying post-it-note terminology
already. All I said was that the evidence that is there suggests that
Neanderthal tool-culture was stereotyped and I'd hesitantly posit this was a
result of the harsh material environments they lived in, not as a result of
some kind of innate inferiority to homo sapiens. But that, too, is
speculation.
Your plea for the recognition of difference, of the otherness of fauna and
flora, is well said, but I don't think a word like 'specism' helps: if I
contract a virus and take medication to overcome it then undoubtedly I am
destroying other living entities, the invasive viri themselves. I
exterminate them to save myself. Is that being 'specist'?

Umm.. yup...

1st line: iambic pentameter, headless , anapest in third foot.
2nd line iambic pentameter, anapests in second and third feet,
extra-syllable ending.
3rd line: iambic pentameter, 4 anapestic substitutions in last 4 ft
(heavily anapestic but could fit in easily in any post-mid-19th c.
iambic pentameter context)
4th line: iambic pentameter, anapest in second foot, trochee in
fourth foot (after a caesura, as is best to keep beat),
extra-syllable ending.

is this what you mean?  They are all fairly standard
modulations...nothing very wild.

Annie,

I originally thought your scansion a sardonic dig at Kirby's sense of epic
meter,
but this sounds like special pleading akin to Bush's State of the Union
characterization of  "weapons of mass destruction-related program
activities."
Would a couple extra sprodees finally scotch his 'iambic pentameter' beyond
recognition? How about the substitution of three or four back-to-back
caesurae somewhere in the third line (for the reader to catch his breath)?
Would that deep-six
his mini-Titanic? Let's hope Kirby weighs in on this.

;~)
Dan

Hello All-

>>Subject: The ad CBS will not air

Dear friend,

During this year's Super Bowl, you'll see ads sponsored by beer =
companies, tobacco companies, and the Bush White House.  But you won't =
see the winning ad in MoveOn.org Voter Fund's Bush in 30 Seconds ad =
contest.  CBS refuses to air it.

Meanwhile, the White House and Congressional Republicans are on the =
verge of signing into law a deal which Senator John McCain (R-AZ) says =
is custom-tailored for CBS and Fox, allowing the two networks to grow =
much bigger.  CBS lobbied hard for this rule change; MoveOn.org members =
across the country lobbied against it; and now the MoveOn.org ad has =
been rejected while the White House ad will be played.  It looks an =
awful lot like CBS is playing politics with the right to free speech.

Of course, this is bigger than just the MoveOn.org Voter Fund.  People =
for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) submitted an ad that was =
also rejected.  We need to let CBS know that this practice of =
arbitrarily turning down ads that may be "controversial" - especially if =
they're controversial simply because they take on the President - just =
isn't right.

To watch the ad that CBS won't air and sign the petition to CBS to run =
these ads, go to:
http://www.moveon.org/cbs/ad/

MoveOn.org will deliver the petition by email directly to CBS =
headquarters.

Thanks.

I suppose if you're a hammer, then everything looks like a nail, but I
don't see much iambic pentameter in these lines either. I see a variable
meter that changes with each line.

1: trochaic pentameter with a dactylic variation in the second foot
2: a barely iambic hexameter that could just as easily be called trochaic.
One iambic foot, one anapest, another iambic foot, a phyrric foot, and two
trochees.
3: anapestic pentameter, but it begins with an iamb
4: another barely iambic line, pentameter: iamb, anapest, iamb, caesura,
dactyl, trochee

Meter is an imperfect way of transcribing sound in poetry, not an ideal
system from which we generate poems like automatons.

Tim


Umm.. yup...
1st line: iambic pentameter, headless , anapest in third foot. 2nd line
iambic pentameter, anapests in second and third feet, extra-syllable
ending. 3rd line: iambic pentameter, 4 anapestic substitutions in last 4 ft
(heavily anapestic but could fit in easily in any post-mid-19th c. iambic
pentameter context) 4th line: iambic pentameter, anapest in second foot,
trochee in fourth foot (after a caesura, as is best to keep beat),
extra-syllable ending.
is this what you mean? They are all fairly standard modulations...nothing
very wild.

The poem's content is perhaps ugly, as David Larson says, and perhaps the meter
too is too regular for some tastes, as Annie Finch says.

I'll comment on the content, first.  When we had the discussion about whether
the term "hermaphrodite" could be used in a poem, I had probably never thought
of this word much before.  But then I thought perhaps by not using it in a poem
we are participating in a genocidal erasure of a very large group of people
(it's a community of approximately 300,000 people at least in the U.S. -- !).
For us to never use this term, or by disbarring the term, is this not a kind of
participation in genocide?

I'm not saying you should stomp on your left foot with your right in order to
understand the pain you've caused the body politic with the exclusion of this
term from your vocabulary, nor am I am implying that you willingly participated
in this genocidal erasure and that your right deviations should be punished by
horse whippings, I'm just saying that the disbarring of the term is a bit icky,
just as icky as some might think that using it is. Perhaps someone else could
still write poetry and be sensitive on this subject.  As for me, I think a poem
is either Dionysian or it isn't poetry -- I don't believe that we can
consciously construct a poem -- I think the ink has to be like a geyser, that
it has to cum in a sense orgiastically, or else it isn't a poem.  In the same
way that I don't think you can construct an orgasm, I don't think you can
construct a poem.  At any rate, that is to say that I've never done it.  A poem
is like a dream in that it simply comes, and I don't think you can direct it
without ruining it.

Now, in terms of the meter -- I was actually just using the breath line, and
wasn't counting meter when I wrote the quatrain.  Some would argue that Olson's
breath line is old hat, but the chopped lines and start and stop that comes out
of Stein's writing is even older in terms of chronology.  I am also not sure
that we should be chronocentric in terms of thinking that humanity has
progressed much since the times of the Neanderthals.  Shakespeare's work is not
appreciably worse than much of what our contemporaries are writing.  I'm really
not sure that more recent works are better.  In a similar way I am not sure
that ancient statues of Easter Island have been improved upon by what you can
see at the Tate Galleries or at MOMA.  I didn't have any idea where the lines
would go -- and just let it sail.  I'm not chronocentric in that sense.  Also,
somewhat in the manner of George Bowering, I serve the muse and let it go
wherever it wishes.  I was a little surprised when the trunk grew out of the
clit and the peanuts were picked up, and so I stopped writing at that point.  I
was appalled, and later, somewhat amused.  I don't mind being appalled.  I
think it's amusing how perverse the mind is.  Just when you think you are being
good, you are being absolutely appalling.  I had attempted to be virtuous in
writing the epic on the Hermaphrodite, but this instead became a rather vicious
image (I'm not sure that it's vicious -- in what way is an elephant's trunk
vicious??).

Now this is where I disagree with the right deviations of a classist writer
like Gertrude Stein who only cared to communicate within the avant-garde (with
the exception of her one popular text PAris, France, and perhaps a few
others).  When Stalin was writing in the thirties that it was a right deviation
to not use the railroads set up by the people of the bourgeoisie, he meant that
(he was writing about linguistics) we do not have to create a new language,
with new grammar, in order to communicate.  This is a rightist deviation.
There were many rightist Bolsheviks who wanted to tear down everything that the
bourgeoisie had built so that everything would be Bolshevik.  But language was
also formed by the People, as a means of communication.

At this point in the 21st century, we have experienced a century of
experimentation.  Already in the teens you have writers experimenting with
lettrism, breakups, typographical field poems.  Most of these experiments do
not communicate anything but the rightist deviation of wanting to be special.
Even Annie Finch in wanting to communicate with me about what she saw as iambic
lines with some twists used regular grammar.  And everybody else has replied in
that format.

Now maybe it's more experimental to have chopped language, starts and stops,
and to try to rip up the railroad lines of grammar, but I would say that after
a century of that, it's actually more experimental to go back to thinking about
communicating with large numbers, and to talk with The People.

I don't think that writers should write for one another.  I think they should
try to communicate with barbers and dress-makers and carpenters and mayors and
others.

This is somewhat at odds with my somewhat automatic generative means of
creating first drafts.  But I do believe in editing.  I normally would have
just let the Hermaphrodite poem drop, as I didn't think it was completely
successful, but I would like to challenge others to write a sensitive poem
using that word.  At the time of the discussion I was satisfied but I now think
it is a rightist deviation to let this matter drop, and to participate in the
genocidal erasure of this term, and the people that this term represents.
Otherwise, I think that there is a problematic space that opens regarding this
rather large community that many have decided are completely unmentionable, and
that anybody who does mention them, is ugly, and beneath notice.  Isn't this a
rightist deviation?  Thank you for helping me with this grave matter.

The world will never be as one until we can all, in a heartfelt way, call E.
Coli our brother (sister?).

Just remember, compassion doesn't stop at the lid of a petri dish.

It is common for poets who are not thinking consciously about meter
to slip into it without knowing they're doing it....(my guess is it
comes probably of having read a lot of metrical poetry at a young age
and then forgotten it so you aren't aware of it enough to keep it
away). I wrote a book on this subject. Not all poets do it, but some
seem to be prone to it.  You must be one of them.  Maybe Olson was
too--as I recall the last line of the Maximus Poems (something about
his wife and his car) is a very regular iambic pentameter (thus he
put himself into the tradition of poets who achieve closure by
invoking that meter) and I doubt he would have liked that if he'd
been thinking about it.

I don't know why Olson would hate to use iambic.  It does have a stateliness to it,
and that is a useful tool.  Stately elegance often does have a mathematical
underpinning.   We should use those resources.  The last line of Olson's poem
reads, as a line alone on a page all by itself:

my wife my car my color   and myself

I am only counting four beats in that line -- the first three feet are iambic --
but then I count after color two unstressed syllables and only one more stress (on
self).

So I think it's tetrameter.  Iambic, yes, at the beginning.  But I don't see it as
pentameter.

I wonder if this is an allusion to his wife's dying by car accident so I look it up
in Butterick's notes and he says the car yes refers to his dead wife, the color
refers to his being white, but also to his declining health.  Does anybody else
read this line as pentameter?

I think you make a good point about iambic slipping in sometimes unconsciously, but
you may be counting other times in order to shove the meter into your theory.  I
noticed too though while working on Corso that many of his best lines are in
perfect iambic pentameter.  It's a very classy meter -- like wearing a formal tux.
I think it can lend stateliness to a line and elegance.  I'm not opposed to either
of those things.  I don't know why Charles Olson would be against them.  They would
seem to me to be things a poet would appreciate.  Thanks for bringing this matter
up.  I would like to read other comments.

Subject:      Nallininga ometamame kisainee naiKunmme (The Companion of My
              Heart and Mind)
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII

hi,
in the spirit of cross-cultural poetix i thought I'd post this poem that
came my way from a friend from Labrador, Stan Nochasak. Stan has provided
english translations from Inuktituk, the language of the Inuit people of
the Eastern Arctic. Stan now lives in the city of St. John's, many miles
from home.

From his introduction:
  I wrote a poem  years ago and accidently found it in one of my boxes the
other day, thought you would like to read it.  It is called 'Nallininga
Ometamame kis ainess NaiKunmmek' or 'Companion In]Of My Heart and Mind',
and it has some  Labrador Inuktitut translations with it to give it my
own, sense of home.

Stan

Companion Ometamame kisainee NaiKunmme (In}Of My Heart and Mind)

Love is an elegant aKKak (hand), an artistic hand, a graceful hand, aggaKame kisainee innuKunaktuk (a beautiful hand) that molds innuKunak (gorgeous or beautiful) shapes with its clay that never runs out.

Since the start has love of you burnt up my helpless uvame (self),
PitaKangetok sulli puaktume (It]the object got no ash left)
For wind to blow--
Not one.

A faint of you has made you a (nallininga) companion (or lover) in (my) omatemame (heart) kisainee naiKumme (and mind), love of you in my chest, feels the abode of (pijume) joy.

Love steals from the sugar all its sweets,
And from the rose its red,
With every Kannime (smile) of love,
And every tutsaame (word).
And who to others turn away instead,
Everyone would come to love as it's weak and feeble servants,
If of love between us souls caught
The faintest hint.
Surpassing must of tartary,
The morning wind blows through love's hair,
Like ambergris the very air,
Love's Katlunaatitut (breath) and scent,
Love is the artic atjinga naipitaksaunngi (snowy owl),
And with you nunavakavunga (I a poor tundra mouse),
See what hath smeared those rapcious claws,
Of my blood redolent!
With you my life love doth harrow.

It's like the conjunction of the Sikkinime (Sun) and the Ikkijunamvut (Moon) when we meet.
iikkii (light) of the Love of our relationship, there is no difference.
Our love between us is itki (cold]chill) in hell fire; dry in the immime (sea).
With whose eye do I see? Atsuk? (I do not know?) Ikkijuame (the light) is blinding.
Love's not a contract, tis free as the anugik (wind). How shall a curtain part the lover and loved one? Not China's wall can separate them!
The siKKinik (sun) of Love tis too bright to see directly,
the repose of our omatimame (heart) grows.
Inume takutsaavunga (Thousands do I see), laying their naaKuk (heads) in a noose to fall on the pathway of love.
Love seizes not upon the living soul,
The falcon preys not on a dead nunavakkak (mouse).

kisainee isumakuavumaja (If I had known)
that falling in love
was to fall in love with pain,
I would have thundered a drum
to proclaim through the city
that love was banned for all.

Candle sinnijuk (weeps) and gives light, sinnijuk and gives light.

The snow blade of love of thee strikes without calculation or hesitation, illume jaikame (in my chest), leaving nothing.
The sea beast of love does away the shaman of reason and destroys the torgnasok (omnipotent being) of knowledge.

Nalligivagit isumaKangnitome (almost to the level of madness),
to say "I love you" becomes a cliche,
instead I become the words, live it out for time and eternity.
You surpass the beauty of an artic flower,
a cast of a ray of light of the north,
You are more relaxing to my eye than any atjinga naipitaksaunngi (landscape),
you cause in me an utterance of a sigh of relief and a sweet moan,
a solace of my eye.

Nalliniga (love) is an elegant hand
that molds innuKunak shapes wiwth its clay
that never runs out.

____

I find more comfortable a system in which some writers
write for "barbers and dress-makers" et. al. and some
write for their friends, and some write for other
writers they don't know, and some for writers they do
know. Not that some barbers and dress-makers aren't
writers with a taste for experimental and intermedial
poetry.

The world of writing is much more diverse and
energized when folks are writing for different
audiences for different purposes.

Best,
Joseph Thomas

I know. And I agree, I think.

It's warm today and I felt like sloganeering--that one sounded like a good
slogan.

Acutlly, I wrote a poem a couple of weeks back that touches on this a
little.

In traditional prosody, this would be a pentameter line -- and would be
scanned w/ a pyrrhic in the fourth foot or as an iamb (a "promoted" stress
on "and"). Iambic pentameter is not defined so much as having five beats
as by a distribution of variations around a norm of five iambic feet.

More interesting questions, to me, at least are 1) under what
circumstances does scansion make sense in poems that are manifestly not in
formal meter and 2) what is meant by using iambic pentameter in this day
and age when there are so many additional tools in the box? (or, to put it
a little differently, is it possible to use pentameter w/out aligning
oneself w/ the reactionary stupidities of New Formalism)

Annie Finch's book is wonderful, by the way. I've also enjoyed a book by a
teacher of mine -- Charles O. Hartman, _Free Verse: An Esaay on Prosody_
(Princeton, 1980; rpt. Northwestern UP, 1996).

I don't understand these kinds of questions.  Of course it is possible.  It
probably requires more guile and passion than the New Formalists are
prepared to invest.

Yeah, I guess so... I have to say that Kirby's idea of writing for barbers
and so on strikes me as more than a little patronising, a writing for a less
fortunate "them" which requires some kind of implicit self censorship
perhaps, but I worry about any kind of writing which predicates itself on
some abstract idea of "audience", which is usually a kind of death.

what's an example of an abstract idea of an audience & one of a
"objective" idea of an audience?  I'm curious where my fantasy of
"audience" lies in this schema.

The last two lines of Kirby Olson's poem on the hermaphrodite, and =
especially the last line, cause me to give it a dual reading: Where in =
addition to "Would wander about the room searching for peanuts" - I also =
get "Would wander about the room searching for penis"

Since it's a hermaphrodite poem, it makes me think of those =
hermaphrodites with the greatly enlarged clitoris - as though searching =
to become a penis.

Wait. That sounds quite Freudian, doesn't it?

  no it sounds ignorant, heterosexual, insensitive and thoughtless.....

its no wonder the f....ing president can get away with trying to pass
an amendment against homosexual marriage... because of thoughtless
insensitive thinking as this... it seems way to easy to speak of the
intersexed without an once of insight... who on this list is..?and how
does it feel to have the term "hermaphrodites" used.. would anyone talk
about race like this.. no!!!! gender and "hermaphrodites" are easy word
to bash around like is a volley ball and you are in a compitition


I have sat by and watched this lame banter on gender and
"hermaphrodites"... and I do truly see this world as hopeless when not
one person even question sthe construct of the language of
hermaphrodite..

this is way to easy and on the surface nothing but chatter on the air
ways.. it neither speaks of substance or relationships

it all reminds me of some spam I got today: "Ejacu.late Like A P0RN
Star!..."

  come on, get real .. you trough these terms around like gender and
"hermaphrodites" and not one comment goes beyond the surface...

Study: Genes may trump nurture with intersex kidsRandy Dotinga,
Gay.com / PlanetOut.com Network
Friday, January 23, 2004 / 05:34 PM
Sex-change operations aren't just for grown-ups. A tiny number of
newborn baby boys go under the knife when their genitals are so
malformed that surgeons figure it's better to raise them as girls. But
a new study suggests that switching genders is hardly so simple.
Researchers found that eight of 14 boys who grew up as females later
declared themselves to be male. Nurture, it seems, couldn't beat out
nature, at least in most of the children.
*It certainly will make doctors think twice before rapidly performing
genital surgery on intersex children,* said Dr. Eric Vilain, a genetics
expert at the University of California at Los Angeles. *Hopefully, the
doctors will wait to see which gender develops before performing
surgery.*
The fate of so-called *intersex* children has long been a major topic
of debate. What do you do with babies who are born with birth defects
that make it difficult to recognize their gender?
About one of every 3,000 babies has a more serious problem -- severely
malformed or so-called *ambiguous* genitalia. The gender of the child
may not be obvious, and the babies often appear to be both male and
female.
In the past, influential psychologists theorized that *gender identity*
had everything to do with environment: Raise an intersex boy as a girl,
maybe with the help of surgery and hormone treatments, and he -- she --
will grow up to think and act like a woman.
This approach didn't always work. In a famous case documented in the
book *As Nature Made Him: The Boy Who Was Raised as a Girl,* a Canadian
boy who suffered a botched circumcision was operated upon and raised as
a girl. He suffered through a tortured adolescence and later chose to
live as a man and get married.
In reality, *Nature as well as nurture affects your gender identity,*
says Dr. Melvin Grumbach, a pediatrician and professor emeritus at the
University of California at San Francisco. 8It's not all one or another
-- and in an individual, you can not be sure what is the deterministic
factor.*
In the new study, researchers spent several years following the lives
of 16 children who were born with a defect known as cloacal exstrophy
that left them without normal penises. All the children are genetically
male; all but two underwent surgery to remove their testes (which were
inside their bodies) and create female genitalia.
The findings of the study appear in the Jan. 22 issue of the New
England Journal of Medicine.
The two children with intact testes were raised as boys and continued
to think of themselves as males. The other 14 were raised as girls, and
even their birth certificates reflected their new genders.
Eight of the 14 later declared themselves to be male, and six of them
said they wanted to undergo sex-change surgery to gain penises. All 14
had some male traits: They had trouble interacting with girls (but not
boys), and they reported little interest in playing with dolls or
playing house.
*In normal genetic and hormonal males, there's a rather district
likelihood that their brain has been masculinized, both in terms of
their behaviors and their identity, how they see themselves,* said
study co-author Dr. William G. Reiner, a pediatric urologist at
University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center.
Experts said the study provides more evidence that psychologists and
doctors need to tread carefully as they decide whether to *assign* an
intersex child to a particular gender at birth.
*What's critical for all of us as surgeons is to operate when
operations are indicated,* Reiner said. *If we don't know if they're
indicated, we should be careful about doing them.*

Subject:      Cid and Shizumi
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

Received a call from Shizumi Corman a while ago and I wrestled with sharing
this, but know there are many friends of Cid's on this list, so here
goes:
Apparently Cid's been asleep for the last 25 days since his heart attack.
Shizumi used the word simiyaku--sleeping pills.  The rationale behind this
is that the doctors did not want Cid to move or to get excited because of
the delicate condition of his heart after the by-pass they gave him and the
pacemaker they implanted.  In addition Cid's kidneys have shut down so he's
also been receiving dialysis.  The doctors say there is a high probability
of brain damage because of the extended, chemically-induced sleep.  They'll
be waking Cid up later today to see if this is true.

Shizumi says to pray for Cid, but I say to pray for both Cid and Shizumi.
Not only is Shizumi taking care of Cid, but she's also taking care of a
brother with cancer in the same hospital.  Shizumi, who stands about 5 foot
two inches, has her own medical problems: she has pain in her eyes and is
virtually blind at night.  Shizumi says that she doesn't care what's
happened with Cid, she will take him home and take care of him forever.

Responses to a few responses to the scansion issue & related topics:

Tim, you put it well to say that meter is a way of transcribing sound
and not an ideal or mechanical system.  With that in mind, scansion
needs to be sensitive.  In your scansion of KIrby's lines, yes, you
do account for each separate line in some kind of theoretically
accurate metrical way....but this scansion you posted is not
sensitive to the rhythmic dynamics of passage as a passage of verse.
Scansion is not a linear academic exercise whose point is to line up
a bunch of assorted feet in a row, as you do here with the apparently
deliberate goal of finding nothing in common rhythmically among the
lines.  Skillful scansion is a three-dimensional process, the
creation of a kind of hologram, whose goal is to capture the pulse
that ties a metrical passage together.  Occam's razor applies to
scansion probably more closely than to other areas of literary
inquiry.  If you are going to bother to scan some verse and want to
do it justice, you need to find the simplest way to transcribe the
shared rhythmic groove by listening to the passage as a whole, if it
will let you.  In this case, it will let you.

These lines of Kirby's DO share a common beat, audible to a
metrically-trained ear, and sure, you can  mark 'em up and "scan"
them as anapestic or trochaic lines or whatever you want, have a
field day, but the fact is that the only metrical context in which
they could all appear together is iambic pentameter, and each of them
can fit in that context with no distortion (one of the reasons some
people (not me) like the meter so much is because it can encompass so
many variations).  n other words,in this case, only iambic pentameter
explains the rhythmic beat that ties this quatrain together. So
iambic pentameter is the most "correct" scansion, in the sense that
it is the most intelligent scansion--not because you can't mark up
the accents dozens of other ways, but because only iambic pentameter
transcribes the SHARED groove, rhythm, beat, of each line.  These are
not very weird iambic pentameters, either, as I said earlier; If I
had time I am sure I could find exact metrical analogues of each of
these lines in the blank verse of, say, Frost.

So the scansion you posted lacks an overarching vision or ear, and it
also lacks sophistication, in that it misses very obvious conventions
of the meter (the caesura followed by a trochee, iamb, and
extra-syllable ending in the last line, for instance, is not at all
unusual in i.p.; to call it caesura dactyl trochee reveals your ear's
lack of familiarity with the conventions, as does your not hearing
the first line as a headless (acephalous) iambic, also a common
variation. This all sounds abstract but is really just a way of
transcribing a physical beat that is quite palpable if your ear knows
what to look for, like listening for the chord progressions in jazz.
Admittedly, scansion is subjective, but it's not COMPLETELY
subjective, and there are some cases where to insist on subjectivity
just reveals that you may not be as familiar with scansion as you
think you are (an understandable mistake when hardly anyone knows
anything at all about it and probably very few people could have come
up with a  metrical account as accurate as the one you did come up
with)

Dan, fyi, the spondees and caesuras wouldn't sink Kirby's Titanic,
but a couple of trochees in the wrong places would (cf Halle and
Keyser's classic essay "The Iambic Pentameter").  The tipoff for me
that it really was iambic pentameter was the fact that the single
trochee in the passage appears after a caesura--trochees (and
dactyls) are the only thing you really have to watch in iambics, and
you need to put them after caesuras or line-initially if you don't
want to sink it.

As for the whole issue of whether or when it is useful to look for
meter in nonmetrical passages (sorry I forgot who posted about
that--it was the person who knew that you can have an iambic
pentameter with only 4 beats--was it Rob?)--here's a thought on that
issue:  meter is either there in a text or it isn't; contrary to how
some people who are not very familiar with meter think about it,
meter does have an objective existence; you can't merely will
something into meter any more than you can will it into a certain key
in music.  And if it IS there, it's useful to talk about it to the
same extent it is useful to talk about lyric subjectivity or
alliteration or fractured stynax or any other poetic device:  useful
to discuss when it is used in a living way and interestingly, kind of
boring to discuss if it's not.

Hi Joseph, this is probably a better formulation.  I don't often know
that I'm writing for anyone or anything.  It's almost as if I let it go
and after the smoke clears I see what I have written.  I write to go
where I haven't gone before -- what Corso called "risked and fevered
thinking."

But I am teaching John Updike in the Great Writers Course and he says
somewhere that he is writing for people somewhere west of Pittsburgh.
This comment fascinated me.  I didn't want to say that dress-makers
can't write.  But just that there's a limited amount of time available,
and someone who is making dresses might not have time to write, any more
than I have time to make dresses.  It struck me as interesting that
Updike is writing then in a broad sociological way -- I think mostly for
Christians who are amused by the postmodern culture in which they find
themselves, and often lapse.

This is a huge audience -- I saw in the newspaper the other day that 87%
of Americans consider themselves to be Christian.

But that goes all the way from extreme liberals such as Unitarians to --
I don't know what's on the furthest right of the Christian spectrum.

Missouri Synod Lutherans are way over there, I suppose, but there are
also some Christians who aren't supposed to laugh and dance according to
some movies I've seen, and Missouri Synod folks will do those two things
in abundance.  Our church is almost entirely about laughter it seems to
me -- everybody is always laughing, and cracking jokes.  The pastor is
always doing this, too.

I am myself quite interested in humor.  I think you have to have at
least one another person for there to be humor.  It's difficult to write
humorously on a board like this because often someone will take
offense.  To buy humor you have to accept the basic thinking of the one
who's writing.  Some will do this, some won't.  I get a lot of positive
backchannel email but also a lot of furious other posts.  What interests
me about humor is that you have to move to the limits of the other
person's boundaries, but you can't cross them or they get mad as heck.

So you need a fairly uniform audience who've basically accepted the same
principles.

I was wondering in general about humor's place in experimental poetry
and in radical politics.  It felt in the 60s that there was a lot more
humor in the left.  This appears to have vanished because someone will
always take offense.  In the Stalinist literature in fact the humorists
were the first to be killed -- I think partially because in humor
identities have to shift and in identity politics this terrifies people
and causes basic categories to collapse.  Zhdanov explicitly mentions
various humorists in his template for a Socialist Realism and all those
writers are dead or stop publishing shortly after he makes Social
Realism into law.

I think it's because humor switches identity categories, and for
radicals, this may upset the whole system of who's in and who's out, who
should die, and who should live, because it knocks out simple categories
of identity.  Like, for instance, when Steve Martin is black in the film
The Jerk (is that the film?) -- when he is actually white.  Well, he is
actually culturally black in that he is being raised by a black family.
But moving back and forth over that color line probably offends all
kinds of people.  Also, in films where the gender of a character
switches back and forth as in Tootsie.  This might offend all kinds of
people.

Meanwhile, I don't think you can have a community worth living in if you
don't have a sense of humor together.

To get to the point of actual friendship, that is to say, you have to
laugh.  Otherwise there is no point in the friendship.  Hell, as I see
it, is a place of agelasts (people who never laugh) while heaven is a
place where laughter rings.

So I see the writer as the person who brings the barber, the carpenter
and many others together into the community of laughter.  I see poetry
and laughter as very closely linked.  The only bit that seems to have
made everybody laugh is when I brought in tallness.  But I found this
post sort of lame.  I like to risk more than that.

Other communities apparently form on the basis of piety, but I find that
I can't fit into those communities very easily on either the right or
the left.  I sort of hate piety, as a result.  It's strange -- even when
I pray -- Christ just cracks jokes.  I know there are some people who
have other relationships with the guy, but I just crack jokes with him.
My pastor says this is ok.  For some reason, Stalin didn't like this
sort of thing.  Remember he sends Ivan Denisovitch to the camps for 8
years for cracking a joke.  I think it's ok to crack jokes with God, but
not with Stalin.  I can't understand that, but am opening the question
in case anybody can explain it.

This is an amazing discussion of meter by Annie Finch.  I haven't seen such a
thing in a very long time.  I enjoyed it immensely.  I think what Annie is
saying is that there is an almost Platonic ideal that the poet is somehow
writing within (often unconsciously, as I certainly was -- but at the time I had
written that hermaphrodite poem I was actually writing a lot of i.p. sonnets for
kicks and to take part in a contest on another board, so they may have gotten in
that way, too).  I don't know for sure if I accept that you have to find the
rhythm that the whole fits under and then generalize, but that's an interesting
approach -- to find the bottom line, or the Platonic (?) ideal underneath the
specific bounces.  I did study meter long ago, but hardly give it a second
thought, so bringing it in like this, when Annie has thought about it clearly
for a great long time, certainly makes me rethink the business.  I don't think
her way of thinking about was in Paul Fussell.  Is this bottom line method,
Annie, something you've invented, or is it generally accepted among metrical
specialists?  I actually rather like it, as I would have counted on a case by
case basis as Tim was doing.

I was wondering if you don't establish ANY kind of established conventions with
the reader (even a word is a convention, as I think we all know) then it would
be impossible to communicate anything.  This is the word salad of the asylum.
When I read the posts of poets on this board it often strikes me as word salad.

If you can't establish a convention, then I think it would be doubly hard to
create a sense of humor because humor often plays off of conventions.  No
conventions, no humor.

So perhaps that explains some of the problem with humor and experimentation?

You then have Edward Lear's limerick which establishes the anapestic lines and
the formal rhymes as humor, as you have formal arrangements for the clerihew.
The sonnet is generally rather solemn.

As experiment often seems to break down conventions, it may be that the
possibility of humor is lost.  It reminds me of weddings in Seattle, where
nobody knew what the conventions were any longer -- things happened in an
arbitrary order, the woman would throw her garter, and then a toast would be
proposed, and thensomebody thought ok let's have the vows, and then finally you
would get barbecued chicken wings and finally perhaps somebody would read
Emerson and so the possibility of setting up an expectation, and then playing
off of that was lost.  You watched the thing nervously, waiting for it to get
over with.

On the other hand, years ago I was lost in reading Charles Olson. I thought it
was word salad.  And after a few years of tangling with it, I began to see the
sense of humor.  This bit did jump out immediately as humor, though.  I don't
know why it is funny, but it seems to be.

business, do you not?  And I couldn't

but that I
do

-- Maximus, p. 378

Now what would a metrical specialist say about this bit, I wonder.  Is the idea
then to have no regular meter whatsoever?  Is there a regular meter underlying
this?  I'll have to get the Annie Finch book and read up.  I loved this
discussion, even though my poem is apparently not considered a breakthrough gem
or instantly canonical masterpiece.

Thanks to Brent Bechtel for his Freudian analysis of it, and all others who
worked on it yea or ny, and thanks again to mIEKAL for requesting it.

Conflation of current leftists and non-mainstream poets with Stalinism
seems a stretch. Rather like conflating current Lutherans with
witch-hunters, chuckling all the way to the stake.

That was leftist humor, in case you didn't know.

It is interesting to note the number of posts
that dealt with the "metrics" / "scanning"
of Mr. Kirby's "poem"

I am reminded of the way a crippled Undergraduate
Poetry wkshop might discuss "line break" or other
formal elements of a poorly thought out
and executed poem about (for example)
"the pathos of a homeless person" (the easy
shock, easy ramped up emotion, easy laugh, etc
that does nothing! ) -- and not talk about
how problematic the text/subject itself is
being construted / set up + Dionysian?...
come on! I face the chalk every day...
and construct beautiful orgasms:
fireworks, rice, angora & more!

Hi mIEKAL

An "objective" idea of an audience is an abstract fantasy, surely?  The only
audience I would say is not abstract is an audience you know personally; and
I guess most of us would write with some idea of someone specific whom we
would like to read our work, even if that person is fictional or a fictional
aspect of ourselves, and that seems to me a useful way of imagining a
writerly self. But I suppose I think that writing "for" an audience of any
kind means second guessing what they like, which seems to me a perilous
enterprise, since people are usually more complex than we like to think they
are.  At the crass end it's just about marketing and has whiskers all over
it: there are all those magazines for example which tell you how to "write
for an audience", which basically means formulaic thinking, and I think even
in the area of popular fiction they get it wrong.  Aren't there other
desires which motivate the act of writing?

Best

I think of an audience of the words, by the words, and for the words--an
audience that reads the black (both in Blake's pejorative sense in "The
Everlastiung Gospel" and in some sense of willingness not to violate by
insupportable paraphrase nor to reduce to fewer  paraphrases than
supportable) and the white (again, in Blake's positive, spiritual sense of
"Divine Analogy" and in the more pedestrian commitment to identify and test
logically necessary but implied, elided or suppressed enthymematic
premises).

Perhaps Celan's poem 'Psalm' defines the ultimate audience:

Gelobt seist du, Niemand.
Dir zulieb wollen
wir bluhn.
Dir
entgegen.

Ein Nichts
waren wir, sind wir, werden
wir bleiben, bluhend:
die Nichts-, die
Niemandsrose.

I can't put in umlauts in e-mail text btw. On the other hand it could be
Vallejo's last volume that defines audience, to the all-world speak-to.
Either way, the options aren't comfortable, Celan's leads to the River
Seine, Vallejo's to a hospital bed death without a cause ascribed.

Poetry is +frightening+. Its words invoke the deities of power.

I've worked at this for years, and the thing still won't come out right.
It's partly because of the collision with that inhospitable territory of
strict form, the invocations of power that are implicit in that evil land,
partly too due to the problems of translation, especially when elements of
what one is translating are full of fustian rhetoric, but also
simultaneously great poetry, bit of a problem that. Here it is:


         THE VOYAGE

                I

For a small boy, enamoured of maps and stamps,
his universe equals his hunger, so he thinks.
Ah! how the world looms large in the light of lamps.
But in memory's eyes how small it shrinks.

One day, it's go, shaken from dreaming graves,
hearts swollen with rancour's sour emotions.
Forward, yes, chasing on the rhythms of waves,
rocking towards infinity on a finite ocean.

Some, spurning the pomps of patriotic lies,
others, their cradles nightmares, others yet,
who mapped the stars yet fell in lovers' eyes,
fled from the web of Circe's perfumed net.

But the truest travellers are those who leave
so that they leave, hearts light like balloons, on
their fatal fate they neither brood nor grieve,
crying, without knowing why, "Let's be gone."

Those whose wishes are undefined by bounds,
whose dreams cloud and dawdle in a coded game,
on vast shifting pastures, unknown sounds
that human mouths have never shaped to name.

                 II

We mimic, oh mercy, spinning tops and balls,
waltzing automatons, even as our dreams run
curiosity torments, goads, forces and enthrals
like an angel of sadists whipping on the sun.

Choice part of destiny where the aim's displaced,
never anywhere, but somewhere else, that's best,
where man, who never lets hope be, debased
and crazed, runs in rounds in search of rest.

The soul's a three-master straining for Icaria.
A voice booms as the jib turns: "Look, over there."
High as the crow's nest shrieks out loud: "It's a ...."
What? Love - happiness? Hell, it's rock, and bare.

Each Eldorado fashioned by the look-out's cries
throngs with the brief ghosts of starved desires;
imagination slobbers on its promised orgies
but finds instead but scars of starry fire.

O poor pouting lover of faded chimeras,
should we calm him with chains, or throw to the gulf
this sot-headed tar, this founder of Americas,
whose fictions flounder in sunken bitter depth?

                 III

Unlikely adventurers. What ironic narratives
we rummage from shy eyes, deep as the seas.
Show us your jewel-hoards, stars of brief lives,
your sullen store-houses, your plunder-stories.

Surrender your gaiety to our days that fail,
let us follow you without canvas or coal,
tracking your memories on the horizon's trail,
tacking like set sail, forcing on our souls.

And say, what did you see?

              IV
                                    "We have seen stars
dissolve in waves, and stilled tides of dunes,
yet despite shock windfalls, unseen disasters,
most days left us bored, stale like old tunes.

Daily extinctions of sun empurpling cloud,
light studding distant rigs of shore towns,
tugged us like mirrors onto trackless roads
where rare air's lack the snagged soul drowns.

The walled wealth of ages, the widest landscape
could never tell the stories of the hold
that clouds on us and chance construction shape,
confounding anxieties with desires untold.

Joy shapes, thickens, turns and feeds desire,
DESIRE, old tree our pleasure serves and forms,
as your gross bark stiffens, hardens higher,
so your branches twist towards a sky of storms.

We cannot lose the sickness fouling everywhere,
having found in all parts, unlike or akin,
from top to bottom of the mould-green ladder,
the dull displays of daily immortal sin:

the eager smiling torturer, the sobbing martyr;
the piled banquet seasoned and scented with blood;
the slow poison of power sapping the dictator
and masses clamorous for the jackboot's thud.

Jumbles of religion, all second-hand sales,
barnstorming the skies, as the drooping head
of sanctity slavers for hairshirts and nails,
sick to the soul, slumped on a feather-bed.

Slobbering manikin mimicry, drunk mirror,
acting Prince of Fools who need not rehearse,
bawling to sky-god on sky-god this law:
O my brother, O my Lord, I thee curse.

And the lesser sots, grimy courtiers of fate,
shunning the herded souls of common hell,
dive into the blue arms of an opiate.
Such is world-wide our bulletin perpetual!"

This is the bitter savour of our voyage,
the petty monotonous world, today, tomorrow,
yesterday, all alike, echoes to our image:
in a wasteland of boredom lurks an oasis of horror.

                     V

To go or not? Which, what? Stay, if you can;
go, if you must. You, there, run. You, you duck,
to slip the tireless timeless enemy of man,
that races without rest or breath: the clock.

Like the lost apostle or the Wandering Jew,
whom nothing will suffice, not horse nor vessel,
to flee earth's bestial story, while but a few
expunge a tyrant, yet never quit the cradle.

When time's thick boot stomps on our vertebra,
we can crawl to the edge and croak: Forwards!
Like once, when we set sail for imagined China,
gorging on horizons, the air quivering with words,

our hearts light as cork, navigating the unreal
with guileless greed, like an innocent beast.
Listen to this double voice, tinkling, funereal,
that rings and chants: "This way! You who would feast

on perfumed lotus, on drowsy blossom, taste
the laden fruits for which your soul has famished;
drink deep beyond your fill on the sweet waste
here in the never-was and never-vanished!"

                 VI

Death, gross Kapitan, it's time! Raise anchor,
Monsieur Le Mort, this landscape bores us - let's be gone!
If skies and seas are black, like a spreading tumour,
our hearts are bright, childish coloured crayon.

Pour us your poison, deliver us from thirst.
What matter, as the fire in our brains burns through,
What's next? Heaven or Hell, the best or the worst?
But at the last of who to find something new!

By which I mean, I think of myself as the poem's first audience--and not
necessarily its best one, either.

Mark, I was struck by an emphatic variation in Maine I hadn't heard
before (from a WW II vet, neighbor) "Mister Man," as in "Let me tell
you, Mister Man." I guess that's neither scholarship nor fancy,
something more like field-work. best, Sylvester

Good Morning!

Just spotted a delightful piece about Jen Hofer and her typerwriter collection
in today's issue of the Los Angeles Times Sunday magazine -- I haven't checked
the LA Times web site to see if that version includes the photo, but you'll
enjoy the piece anyway --

The Soul of the Old Machine
  Hearkening to the Poetic Song of the Typewriter
January 25, 2004 Los Angeles Times
=A0
ANDREW JOHN IGNATIUS VONTZ
In our wireless-broadband-text messaging era of instant gratification,=20=

the manual typewriter would seem about as relevant as the Pony Express.=20=

But for Jen Hofer, poet, typewriter collector and escritorio publico,=20
the imperfection of pre-digital technology is the stuff of romance.
"I like that you have to write a little bit more slowly than you do on=20=

the computer," says Hofer, a Spanish speaker who owns 21 manual=20
typewriters and honors the Mexican street tradition of=20
letter-writing-for-hire by setting up her own booth on busy Los Angeles=20=

thoroughfares. "I like the sound. I like the way the letters bite into=20=

the paper. I like that they're uneven. I like that you can feel there=20
is a human being involved in doing it. I like the whole manual mess of=20=

it."
If all of this seems a bit seems a bit lyrical, perhaps it's the poet=20
in Hofer coming out. She studied writing at Brown University and=20
translation and poetry at the University of Iowa. Hofer, whose father=20
is Argentine, refreshed her childhood Spanish when she went to Mexico=20
City to work on an anthology of Mexican poetry. Today, the Cypress Park=20=

resident works as a translator of Spanish language poems, fiction and=20
nonfiction.
A frequenter of thrift stores and estate sales, Hofer paid just a few=20
bucks for her first typewriter, a Royal Quiet De Luxe. "I write a lot=20
of letters and so I started using this to write letters and poems," she=20=

says. A collection was born that today includes four Smith-Corona=20
Sterlings, three Royal Quiet De Luxes, an Underwood Universal and two=20
plastic children's typewriters. "I don't play favorites with my=20
typewriters," she says. Except one, that is: an Olivetti Lettera 22=20
with a Spanish language keyboard that belonged to Hofer's grandmother.
The 22 is the weapon of choice for Hofer's escritorio publico project,=20=

a poetic undertaking that's as much literary performance art as a=20
professional sideline. Hofer sets up shop every 10 days or so with her=20=

grandmother's typewriter, a folding table and a sign outlining her=20
prices=97$2 for a letter, $3 for a love letter and $5 for an illicit =
love=20
letter.
Hofer has written everything from love letters to an apology to the New=20=

Mexico DMV for a man sending in a check past due. Takers range from=20
creative types who view her services as an art project to Spanish=20
speakers who don't bat an eye at what they view as a normal element of=20=

city life. She lists her oddest commission as a letter for a student=20
applying to Stanford's master's of fine arts program. "The guy was=20
like, 'Yeah, so-and-so from Time magazine said he would write a=20
recommendation but he said, "You write it and I'll sign it." ' ''=20
Instead, Hofer says, the applicant "described his work to me and how he=20=

knew the guy, and I wrote the letter."
For Hofer, the point is sharing the power of the written word and using=20=

language to bring people together. "The happenstance, incredibly=20
beautiful human connections I have every time make it worth it," she=20
says.

That one, at least, has female equivalents: missy, lady, girl (you go,
girl). Also kid, kiddo. "Oh man" or "oh boy" are peculiarly ungendered in
use (and don't indicate the gender of the audience): "Oh man, what a
woman!" "oh boy oh boy let's eat."

Fun stuff.

What are you doing in the field? You'll freeze to death.

Dear Chicago Area Poets and others interested in Poor Chicago;

After last night's gracious event at Mary Margaret Sloan's (what a great
event)  for Ron S and Stacy S where most of Chicago's poets were present I
decided that we too in poor Chicago should have a poetry calendar along with
reviews.  Until I can get up a proper website I am going to use this blog
page. I would ask all Chicago area animators of reading series to send me
your information on your readings and I will get it up on the the blog asap.
I also ask you all to send me links as well and to send this blog site to
everyone you know interested in Chicago poetry.  I would also ask that you
send me reviews of readings here in the area that I will post asap as well.
We would also like any reading information from Cities close to Chicago such
as Milwaukee, Madison, Champaign and Iowa City.

Please send this to my home email saudade@comcast.net

Thanks

Ray Bianchi

A decade ago a friend of mine, Ed Schelb, poet and essaysist--suggested,
given much of the atmosphere of the times--
why not Eunuch studies--poetics, poetry--

gallows humor--(Surrealists did an anthology of dark/black humor--)

"Quatrain"  By Francois Villon:

Je suis Francois dont il me poise
Ne de Paris empres de Pontoise
Et de la corde d'une toise
Scaura mon col que mon cul poise.

I am Francois which weighs heavily on me (other trans:  "which is my cross")
Born in Paris near Pointoise
From a fathom of rope
My neck will learn the wieght of my ass.

Burroughs, Celine, Rabelais, Hasek (THE GOOD SOLDIER SCHWEIK), Borowski
(THIS WAY TO THE GAS CHAMBER),Ambroise Bierce, Richard Pryor on and on and
on an endless parade of gallows humor--
for centuries--cultures--existing everyday around one--

Appreciate learning of Jen Hofer's use of typerwriters as have three to work
with, all different ways one can space, fonts, weights of keys on hitting
various weights of paper--the sounds of them--

so much one can do with them that one can't with the computer--
like sounds of mono records compared to vacuity of many digital recordings,
with the dropped spaces in between--
(not to mention all the work done with them in concrete and sound poetries,
in Olson--Larry Eigner--Bob Cobbing--a vast movement for sevral
decades--e.e. cummings--the Typewriter Girls  women's group dressed in
forties secretary style, who will compose haiku spontaneously from audience
suggestions--)

an early blog:

in Stefan Zweig's excellent bio, BALZAC--at one point Balzac decided to
start his own journal
this wd include fiction of his, then his ruminations on
everything--politics, literature, fashion, mores,
economics, technology--everything!


it lasted but three or four months--
despite Balzac's growing fame--

it was his fiction alone people wanted--not opinions and judgements--
Marx noted that Balzac was the greatest writer on capitalism, the analysis
of an entire society with the question of money at the core--

So wie das Welt
Ein hat die Kinder
Ander hat das Geld

(apologies for my German, from memory--of hearing this--)

So is the world
one has children
the other has money

Answers to any of the following questions would be most helpful.

Does anyone know a way for non-profit publishers to get ISBN numbers at
a cheaper rate or for that matter free?

Also I'm interested to know how much a Library of Congress number is
used.  Does it make sense to have both inside of books & how does one
get those numbers?

After 26 years of publishing Im thinking of having them on newly
published books.

mIEKAL -- When I purchased ISBN's some years ago for the Toledo Poets =
Center Press I received a lengthy list of them, some of which I've given =
to friends who have used them for other independent press projects not =
associated with TPC Press. It might have been 25 numbers, perhaps =
slightly more. I've not worried about the sequence matching up and =
continue to draw down on that original list. So even though there is an =
initial outlay, not inconsiderable, they can last many years, depending =
upon how frequently you code new issues. Can't help with the NFP issue. =

If you're looking for the software/etc. for your calendar, see Jackie
Sheeler. She's generous with this, as she is with so much else, enthusiasm
and love of poetry most of all.

Subject:      bottom line scansion
Comments: To: olsonjk@delhi.edu
Mime-Version: 1.0

        Thanks, Kirby for your response to the meter post (and sorry,
Kari, for absentmindedly helping keep that hermaphrodite subject
header going so long--I see why you found it offensive!).
Kirby, yes, the "bottom line" method of scansion--looking for the
most encompassing groove of a passage instead of going line by
line--is a very basic assumption of scansion--but probably that point
didn't need to be made, until pretty recently, as explicit as I made
it in my post. My guess is that the reason it isn't discussed in
books like Paul Fussell's is that at that time it didn't need to be
explicit because, until the last forty years or so, if any poem was
metrical the poet would know that it was metrical and let the reader
know very clearly that it was, so this level of
archaeology/sensitivity wasn't necessary.
        It's the pushing of meter to the unconscious level, after a
couple of generations of free-verse-raised poets had come up, some of
them with meter a kind of unconscious compulsion surfacing at certain
times, that has made this kind of approach more necessary-it is an
approach based on a much wider palette of rhythmical options, none of
them assumed--In other words, making this explicit enables a
self-conscious, more pomo approach to scansion and also helps enable
scansion of texts that may not be consciously metrical but are
nonetheless still metrical.
        So, the answer is yes and no; this bottom-line approach is
basically the method that would be used by anyone with facility in
scansion, but it probably wasn't necessary to use it so creatively
and actively until the last couple of decades.
        What you say about conventions applies very interestingly to
meter... in a poem that holds very strictly to one metrical pattern
with only one or two rhythmic variations/deviations, those deviations
can have a GIGANTIC impact.on the poem.  It's a very energy-efficient
system in that sense.
        And, by the way, the non-iambic rhythms that Tim's scansion
emphasized still have a major role in the meter of a poem, as
"cross-rhythms" that add rhythmical interest to the basic meter--so
an iambic pentameter line would be iambic pentameter in the context
of a platonically iambic pentameter text, but if it could also be
scanned another way, as trochees or dactyls, that cross-rhythm is
still present in the line, even though it is not the way you would
scan the line:  just as in a piece of music in 4/4 time, you can have
triple rhythms coming across certain bars that make the line much
more interesting, but you wouldn't call those bars 3/3 time.  This
is, again, based on the energy generated by conventions....

Re the Olson excerpt, yes, I would think there is a series of regular
meters underlying this---this is clearly the free verse of someone
who knows meter well, and more to the point, the free verse of a poet
for whom meter resonates with energy, impact....

The first five lines are permeated by a three-beat groove--this is an
accentual meter, a kind of oral beat, with only the accents
mattering, not much regularity of syllables, giving it a casual feel,
but a clear metrical drive...(the most common kind of accentual meter
now is rap; it's a rhythm aimed at oral perception)  Then two iambic
pentameters, "you stick it into every other person's/business do you
not? And I couldn't"  (the first line is a totally regular i.p. with
extra-syllable ending, the second line much less regular-- I scan it
as a headless (skipping first unstressed syllable) i.p. with a long
caesura (a rest, skipping a syllable) before "and," and an
extra-syllable ending.)  Then the last 3 lines of the passage when
read aloud sound like a dogtrot iambic tetrameter, which seems to be
on some level, through its metricality, perhaps accepting the
accusation of having a public voice/presence/obligation....

If you look at my book The Ghost of Meter you'll see that iambic
pentameter can sometimes have a lot of meaning when it pops up in
free verse by certain poets (not all poets).......and it seems to
have meaning for Olson.  It seems like a reading of all the iambic
pentameter lines in Olson might turn up some pretty interesting
patterns of meaning....these two iambic pentameters: "you stick it
into every other person's/business, do you not? And I couldn't..and
then the final iambic tetrameter disguised by line breaks but with a
very strong beat you can hear clearly, particularly following
directly after two iambic pentameters and an iambic tetrameter
opening the passage......one would have to reread all of Olson and
study it all in terms of his "metrical code" (a term from the book)
to hazard a guess as to what these meters might have meant to him,
but it does seem as if they might be quite resonant for him.
        so in the Olson passage, there is no overarching metrical
pattern as there is in your quatrain.....however, there is an
interaction between three different metrical patterns--iambic
pentameter, iambic tetrameter, and a 3-beat accentual meter (a kind
of folk meter, with no definite number of syllables but a steady beat
of accents), and this interaction itself is quite likely worth
somebody investigating to see if and how it surfaces throughout
Olsons' work.. .

A related linguistic incident is the hippy use of man in almost every
sentence, man, like, like, man, Like, Man!

I wonder if there are still people somewhere who speak in that idiom.  Oh boy
seems to express eagerness -- Oh boy, Cheerios!  Whereas Oh man, seems to
express sorrow Oh man, Cheerios?  (as if to say, AGAIN?)

Funny interesting question.  Could it be partially a place holder, like
saying, uh, uh, to gain time to figure out what you're going to say?  Perhaps
that is how "man" functioned in hippy speech.  My two year old boy uses oh
man all the time.  He doesn't use oh boy, though, at all. I don't know where
he got it from.  I don't think the rest of us use this phrase at home, but I
might be wrong.

$800 for 100 ISBNs (+ a $119.95 fee, according to their website)? Wow! Boog
bought our ISBNS back in 1992, and paid $100 for 100. Must be nice for
Bowker to have a monopoly.

In Lutheran Triangle, Loss of Privilege Breeds Bitterness



 By Daniel Williams



   THULUIYA, Germany -- Less than a year ago, Ismael Mohammed Juwara lived high in the food chain of President Adolf Hitler's Germany. He was a secret policeman feared and respected among his comrades and in his hometown, enjoying a cornucopia of privileges from the government.



  Now, as he scrapes out a living by  selling diesel fuel illegally, he is a pariah in the new Germany. "We were on top of the system. We had dreams," said Juwara, a former member of the SS, the intelligence service that reported directly to the now-deposed president. "Now we are the losers. We lost our positions, our status, the security of our families, stability. Curse the Americans. Curse them."



  His is the kind of angry lament that can be heard all over central Germany, the region most devoted to Hitler. It is the area of tribes and clans that were closest to him and that could expect power and privileges from his government. As Germans following the Lutheran strain of Christianity, the people here enjoyed an added advantage, because Hitler had extended their long dominance here, although they represent only about 20 percent of the population.



 Hundreds of thousands of men from  this area, now known as the  Lutheran Triangle, joined Hitler's extensive security apparatus, including the army and multiple police and intelligence agencies. As such, they are mostly outcasts from   the new governing system under construction by U.S.-led occupation authorities and their selected German political allies.



  Juwara has two strikes against him: He was part of a feared repressive agency and a high-ranking Nazi Party member. Such Nazis are prohibited from government posts, as well as new security organizations now being formed.



 Juwara, 46, was sitting in the police station in this town along the Tigris River one recent morning as new officers sat idle. Relations between the police and U.S. occupation forces are strained. U.S. officials stopped using them for guard duty because they were considered unreliable, and soldiers no longer patrol with them. "They think we should know everything that goes on here, but we don't," said Hafath Salah, the liaison officer with the Americans.



 In clannish Thuluiya, working for the Nazi Party government was often a family affair. Hafath is a cousin of Juwara. With them was Saleh, Hafath's brother, who said he once belonged to the Interior Ministry's general security section, another secret police branch.



  Hafath and Juwara escorted a reporter to an improvised diesel fuel station in a muddy field nearby. The men earn what they can by purchasing fuel and reselling it to truckers and farmers who don't want to wait in long lines at gas station.



 Along the way, Juwara talked about his life. He said he joined the Nazi Party in high school, enlisted in the army and then the secret police. His job was to watch over army personnel and opponents of the government in such conflicted locales as Munich, the large, predominantly Catholic city in the south, and Bremen in the Protestant north.



  When he married, the government supplied him and his wife with a bedroom set. Soon after, he received a free plot of land and a home-construction loan, which was converted into a grant when the second of his nine children was born. He bought cement at cost from a government warehouse.



  Health care, Juwara said, was supplied through Rashid military hospital, a special facility in Berlin reserved for security and military officers. Last winter, on the eve of the U.S.-led invasion, Juwara said, he received permission to travel abroad to get treatment for his son, 13, who suffers from a nerve condition that slurs his speech.



 When Juwara bought a refrigerator, he went to a market set aside for secret police families and got it at a discount. He drove a Peugeot supplied by his unit. During the past decade of economic sanctions, he received extra rations. Now, he said, "we cook beans left over from before the war."



 He said that before the war, he sold his house to finance construction of a larger one, then moved into a small rental home. After the war, he used up the construction money to support his wife and  children. His new house is only half built. He is barely making ends meet, he said, explaining, "There are no jobs, certainly not with the Americans."



   People such as Juwara form the core of resistance to the occupation and the developing  order, according to U.S. and German officials. Frequently referred to as Nazi remnants or dead-enders, they are resentful and unwilling to accept their lot  quietly. For that, they make no apologies.



  "Was being a Nazi some sort of disease?" Juwara said, raising his voice suddenly. "Was serving the country some sort of crime?" In effect, Lutherans such as Juwara are experiencing the changes since the U.S. invasion as a revolution in which the long-suppressed Catholic majority is taking charge.



  "These people with turbans are going to run the country. What do they know? Germany needs people like us," Juwara bellowed. People had been crowding around to buy diesel fuel, but sales momentarily halted.



  Lutherans who served the deposed government often demonstrate their frustrations. In the Catholic south, they have rioted for jobs. In the Lutheran center, they have rioted for pay. Conversations with Juwara and some of his colleagues from the secret police indicate that they are not loyal so much to Hitler as to a subsidized, predictable way of life.



  Many people in Thuluiya, with a population of 150,000, benefited from life during the Hitler government. Big villas line the river and the land where houses sit was supplied free by the government.



  "Just about every family had someone working in security or the army or some government job," said Maj. Mahdi Obeidy, a member of the U.S.-appointed police force. "It was normal to join the Nazi Party. It was like a rule." Although Obeidy is a former Nazi, he was sufficiently low-ranking to qualify for the new force.



  Thuluiya escaped the war; U.S. troops rushed by to other destinations. They returned in June, having discovered that guerrillas had been hiding in the area. In the months since, U.S. forces have detained hundreds of suspects in and around Thuluiya. Yet townspeople say that rebels come and go freely, hiding in homes or among lush date groves.



   Besides his economic woes, Juwara expressed deep feelings of humiliation. He told of a trip to the Central Bank in Berlin on a quest for records of his account in Thuluiya. He said the bank records were looted after the war.



  "You know what they told me? 'You are from Thuluiya. You are a dog. Go and ask Hitler for the money,' " he recalled. "A few months ago, they  would never have treated me like that. They wouldn't dare."



 He pointed out the house of a former colleague. It was empty. "Abu Falah has disappeared. The Americans are after him," Juwara said. "They think he is with the resistance. Maybe. He needs the money."



  At the field of diesel barrels, Juwara helped Saleh as customers complained that the price was too high. Hitler has his own troubles. He also sold his house. He was living with his brother, but the atmosphere grew tense because Hitler could not pay rent, so he moved to a cheap place. He sold the Mitsubishi that the Interior Ministry had supplied him. He has two wives and 10 children. "People say that the resistance pays to kill Americans. Pretty soon, that will seem like a good idea," he said.



  It is illegal to resell fuel in Germany, a fact Hafath suddenly remembered. As a policeman, he is supposed to stop it. "I tell them not to do it.



 "But," he said as he pulled the reporter to one side, "we all know each other here. We will have to live together when the Americans leave. What can I do?"

This site will show you how to translate this and other idiomatic
expressions into ... Lithuanian.

So instead of the same ol' "Boy oh boy!"

You can surprise your friends with "Berniuk-ei-berniuk!"

http://www.lituanus.org/1994_3/94_3_06.htm

But really, the idiom has its roots in pop culture, as it was originally
rendered "Oh, Boy Wonder!" - a reference to Robin of the Batman comic. In
time this was shortened, like many phrases, to "Oh, Boy!" or simply, "Boy!"
(e.g. "Boy, is this swell!") It's used in making declarations to one's
companions with the same kind of elation and intensity that Robin conveys to
Batman - "Holy lexicographers, Batman - it's the neologism!" etc. ...

Anne, for your information, without wanting to upset your assumptions of
being a superior and metrically trained ear, but the first line in Kirby's
lamentable fragment STARTS with two trochees, that is to say a true 'foot'.
After that line one does resolve into iambic beats. Afterwards, in its three
following lines, it is just a fudge, a neither here nor there. But your
statement about the single trochee in the passage - it begins, remember,
WALKing SLOWly, is so inept a piece of pseudo-metrical analysis that it
almost deserves an award.

Responses to a few responses to the scansion issue & related topics:

Tim, you put it well to say that meter is a way of transcribing sound
and not an ideal or mechanical system.  With that in mind, scansion
needs to be sensitive.  In your scansion of KIrby's lines, yes, you
do account for each separate line in some kind of theoretically
accurate metrical way....but this scansion you posted is not
sensitive to the rhythmic dynamics of passage as a passage of verse.
Scansion is not a linear academic exercise whose point is to line up
a bunch of assorted feet in a row, as you do here with the apparently
deliberate goal of finding nothing in common rhythmically among the
lines.  Skillful scansion is a three-dimensional process, the
creation of a kind of hologram, whose goal is to capture the pulse
that ties a metrical passage together.  Occam's razor applies to
scansion probably more closely than to other areas of literary
inquiry.  If you are going to bother to scan some verse and want to
do it justice, you need to find the simplest way to transcribe the
shared rhythmic groove by listening to the passage as a whole, if it
will let you.  In this case, it will let you.

These lines of Kirby's DO share a common beat, audible to a
metrically-trained ear, and sure, you can  mark 'em up and "scan"
them as anapestic or trochaic lines or whatever you want, have a
field day, but the fact is that the only metrical context in which
they could all appear together is iambic pentameter, and each of them
can fit in that context with no distortion (one of the reasons some
people (not me) like the meter so much is because it can encompass so
many variations).  n other words,in this case, only iambic pentameter
explains the rhythmic beat that ties this quatrain together. So
iambic pentameter is the most "correct" scansion, in the sense that
it is the most intelligent scansion--not because you can't mark up
the accents dozens of other ways, but because only iambic pentameter
transcribes the SHARED groove, rhythm, beat, of each line.  These are
not very weird iambic pentameters, either, as I said earlier; If I
had time I am sure I could find exact metrical analogues of each of
these lines in the blank verse of, say, Frost.

So the scansion you posted lacks an overarching vision or ear, and it
also lacks sophistication, in that it misses very obvious conventions
of the meter (the caesura followed by a trochee, iamb, and
extra-syllable ending in the last line, for instance, is not at all
unusual in i.p.; to call it caesura dactyl trochee reveals your ear's
lack of familiarity with the conventions, as does your not hearing
the first line as a headless (acephalous) iambic, also a common
variation. This all sounds abstract but is really just a way of
transcribing a physical beat that is quite palpable if your ear knows
what to look for, like listening for the chord progressions in jazz.
Admittedly, scansion is subjective, but it's not COMPLETELY
subjective, and there are some cases where to insist on subjectivity
just reveals that you may not be as familiar with scansion as you
think you are (an understandable mistake when hardly anyone knows
anything at all about it and probably very few people could have come
up with a  metrical account as accurate as the one you did come up
with)

Dan, fyi, the spondees and caesuras wouldn't sink Kirby's Titanic,
but a couple of trochees in the wrong places would (cf Halle and
Keyser's classic essay "The Iambic Pentameter").  The tipoff for me
that it really was iambic pentameter was the fact that the single
trochee in the passage appears after a caesura--trochees (and
dactyls) are the only thing you really have to watch in iambics, and
you need to put them after caesuras or line-initially if you don't
want to sink it.

As for the whole issue of whether or when it is useful to look for
meter in nonmetrical passages (sorry I forgot who posted about
that--it was the person who knew that you can have an iambic
pentameter with only 4 beats--was it Rob?)--here's a thought on that
issue:  meter is either there in a text or it isn't; contrary to how
some people who are not very familiar with meter think about it,
meter does have an objective existence; you can't merely will
something into meter any more than you can will it into a certain key
in music.  And if it IS there, it's useful to talk about it to the
same extent it is useful to talk about lyric subjectivity or
alliteration or fractured stynax or any other poetic device:  useful
to discuss when it is used in a living way and interestingly, kind of
boring to discuss if it's not.

David,
that's what line-initially means in my last sentence: at the
beginning of a line--,,if a trochee happens line-initially or after a
caesura, it doesn't break the meter....but since Dan was asking if
anything could break the meter, if anything did it would be a trochee
in mid-line, not after a caesura, not line-iniitally--which you will
probably remember was Halle and Keyser's great discovery, yes?
(though obviously plenty of poets break this rule and get away with
it, anyway, as Thomas does in Do Not go Gentle into that Good
night...all a question of ear).

Though since I heard the whole passage as iambic and was using that
bottom line method, I was scanning the first line of Kirby's poem as
a "headless" iambic line with an anapest in third foot, which is much
simpler to my ear in an iambic context than scanning it with two
trochees, since it manifests the rising rhythm: (scansion:  (omitted
first syllable )WALK/ing SLOW /ly aLONG / the IC/ y ROAD)
However, scanning it as two trochees and three iambs makes sense to
me too, though in an iambic context I believe the general principle
is to keep falling feet (trochees and dactyls) to a minimum as much
as possible if you can easily scan it another way, which in this case
you can.

Of course you are entitled to your own trained ear.  I've heard too
many endless prosodic arguments to get into one.

Dear Mr. Sondheim and dear Mr. Lacook,

I am graduate student in Art History at Paris 1 –
Panthéon Sorbonne University.
The topic of my thesis is random computer generated
artworks since the 1980s.
As I was looking for information, it occured to me
that your work could provide
elements fo answer to my questions : I have seen some
of your artworks in which
the random process is an essential point. However,
available information on
your research and on your theories are still difficult
to access. It would be
very helpful to me if you could answer a few
questions. Indeed it is very
important for me to have a genuine and precise
information on the development
and conclusions of your research, for my work to be
constructive. I understand
that you may be very busy, this is why I use the
Internet to send you this
questionnaire for you to save time. I would
nonetheless like you to send me
back your paper before April 2004 . I have to collect
as much information as
possible by this date. Therefore, I would be very
pleased to “talk” with you.

My thesis raises the following issues (among others) :


1. What kind of training did you have ?



I was an English major.



2. How does the random process work in your production
? That is, could

you give a mathematical or a computer definition as
accurate as

possible of the

calculation method used by the program you write to
simulate a random

process

(stochastic definitions, statistics, use of physical
or biological

models, ...) ?



The process seems organic to me. Random elements
co-exist with predetermined elements, all of which
should be reactive, i.e. manipulated in some
significant way by the user.



It's an epistemology.



3. Which programming langage do you use, and does its
nature have an

influence on your work ?



The languages vary. Since I want my work to exist on a
network, to be an odd pocket of communication, I do a
lot of web-programming, scripting languages. For a
long time I worked mainly in Flash, using
ActionScript; it's a robust language these days, an
ECMA script brute. Because the language is rich in
events.



Lately, I've been exploring what Flash can do when
used with PHP, which is the server-side language of my
dreams. And also lately PHP and MySQL--



Because ActionScript is a rich client-side
event-driven language, I do think most of the work
I've done is reactive; the user must invest herself
somehow in the work in order for the work to unfold.
There is always the hope for me that the work is a
collaboration between myself, the random--sometimes
oracle-like--and the user.



4. What is your definition of the notion of “author”
when it is applied

to

these kinds of works ? That is, on the one hand, who
do you consider as

the

author of the work you build, and on the other hand,
how is the notion

of “author” modified by a random pattern ?



I don't think about the author at all. How bourgeois!



5. How would you define the relation that binds the
program (as a

particular form of language, hidden to the spectator,
accessible to the

designer and only understandable by a scholar
audience) and the visual

form it

allows ?



You would be surprised at how many non-scholars can
operate a calculator, buddy!



You are asking me to explore here the difference
between the hidden and the visible in my work; or
really, explain somehow what the relations between
different elements MEAN. But I don't particularly hide
the elements. Nor do I often control the relations
between these elements. What I do is design spaces in
which relations happen; I make rooms.



6. What do you think of the oppositions existing
between the program

thats

remains fixed and the instability of the visual form ?
between the

uniqueness

of the program and the multiplicity of the visual
forms ? between the

discontinuity of the calculation lines of the program
and the

continuity of its

visual expression ?



I think it feels like living.





7. What are the role and the responsability of the
spectator in the

artworks ?



The spectator becomes a user; she uses the work, but
the work also uses her. The work should be a focused
kind of social sculpture- this is the role of the
network. It is a communication medium. I'd love for
the user to leave permanent marks on the objects I
make, to inscribe it with something of herself. This
too feels like living.



8. If you have suggestions for further reflexions, if
there are points

you

would like to insist on or if you know other artists
using random

process as

raw material, please let me know.



Where can I get access to a live global temperature
API?

Kirby,

Well, at this point I don't have much patience for labels.... I
published my first book (actually not really my first book--my first
book will come out this spring from Salt (see below) with Story Line
because they didn't run and hide when they saw meter as a lot of
people used to do-- but got tired of the conservative associations,
of being totally misunderstood politically because I published with
them, which was one of the reasons I left.

I am just getting a book of essays together that will answer a lot of
the questions you raise about how I situate myself and how I balance
formal aesthetics within my spiritual/political/literary contexts
(The Body of Poetry: Essays on Women, Form, and Poetics to be
published by U. of Michigan Press next year). And the most recent
book of poems, CALENDARS, includes a blend of aesthetics and
approaches to form.

I guess like Whitman I contain multitudes. .. I love poetic formal
beauty and pleasure in the context of my spirituality, which is
basically wiccan/pagan. I also see it is a key part of my political
activism, which is feminist/leftist, which also seems to challenge
some stereotypes.

You know from the "metrical diversity" essay in "After New Formalism"
that I consider myself a conservationist of poetic forms; I'm
interested in preserving a biodiversity of forms and meters which are
in danger of being lost forever in our monotextural culture. In the
books since then-An Exaltation of Forms and especially in
Multiformalisms, which I've coedited with Susan Schultz and hopefully
will be out soon, there is a lot more about overlaps between
traditional and experimental forms.  That's one of the dichotomies
I'm interested in exploring/questioning.

Despite my very real cultural, literary and political differences
from with new formalists, I do enjoy talking meter and technical
stuff with them.  And I also talk with avant poets because I enjoy
talking with people who understand that poetry needs to blow you away.

Right now I'm reading mostly experimental poetries. The recent new
formalist volume of the dictionary of literary biography profiles me
in terms of an exception, a boundary-stretcher, bridge-builder, the
one who resists the stereotype of the new formalism as hidebound,
reactionary, etc....   Many of the new formalists find my formal
poetry horribly sloppy because I work with such a range of approaches
including aural rhythms, ritual forms, exploded syntax, in addition
to forms so arcane some of them don't even recognize them as forms.
In fact, I feel a lot more in common at this point with experimental
forms--the labels don't really matter to me; I go wherever I find the
most interesting ways to think about poetry and its forms and
musics...

Folks on the this list may be interested in my third book of poetry
which SALT is about publish.  The book is actually my first book,
never before published in full, a collage, not in any predictable
form at all, though very musical (in fact, I sang/performed it with a
band when it was first completed).  It is a real pastiche of voices
and shows that what I was doing 15 years before my "first" book was
nothing to do with formalism....though now, yes, I find nothing more
exciting than to look at ways the body of poetry enacts beauty,
energy, in structural ways.  I've thought a lot lately about poetry
and architecture, a parallel which offers more interesting analogues
to poetic forms--again, I find it useful to have new ways to think of
poetics so it doesn't fall into the same old tired dichotomies that
seem to drain creativity right out through the split.  I don't find
that enjoying thinking about meter automatically puts me into any box
or stops me finding new ways to think about poetry.


best,
Annie.

Well, I guess we live in different worlds and with different
languages. I take Rilke's notion that the sense of beauty and fear
are two aspects of the same thing.

Rilke was steeped in romanticism, which, like too much salt, can make your
blood pressure rise.

swivet (SWIV-it) noun

   A state of anxiety, discomposure or agitation.
   (Usually used in the phrase "in a swivet".)

[Of unknown origin.]

  "Scientists were in a swivet last month when they learned that
   Butterfields, a San Francisco-based auction house, was putting the
   200-million-year-old fossil, a glider with the wingspan of a large
   dragonfly, up for sale."

Order is good. Mostly. It makes sure that the earth will go around the sun
in the same way as it has in the past and bring the summer to ripen the
mangoes. Patterns are good too - most of the time. They help us find our
shoes easily among an array of other pairs.

But if we stick too much to the same order and pattern, we lose. We lose
the opportunity of discovering new lands, new paths, new flowers, new ways
(and new words!). Sometimes the break in order is by choice and at times
it's forced, as when you lose a job. Often it's a blessing in disguise.
It's an opportunity to explore and discover what remained hidden from the
old path.

This week's words have no order, pattern or theme. They just are. But
they're all interesting. -Anu Garg

Annie, containing multitudes is probably inescapable.  The Wiccan religion
is growing stronger every day.  Now you make sense -- I was looking at the
photo on the back of the book and you have very short hair indicating
feminist, to me at least, but you also have a necklace and lots of
earrings, and your hair isn't THAT short, so a Wiccan feminist would make
sense.

Murat has been backchanneling me about where I got the 87% figure from in
terms of the number of Christians in the country.  I got it out of Time
Magazine, and this number keeps getting recycled in all kinds of
publications, but their data may be 10 years old.  I looked it up on the
net and got a fairly good site that breaks down religions in America.
Muslims are about half a percent.  By the way, most Arabic people in
America are Christians, not Muslim, according to one study I read.  Most
Taiwanese and Koreans are also Christian.  What does this mean to be a
Christian?  Beats me.  Is a Mormon a Christian?  Not according to my
pastor.  They actually believe that they will become Gods in their own turn
and rule their own universe in the next life.  Sounds like fun, but my
pastor says it's heresy.  And yet, they have about five million adherents
and we Lutherans only about 8 million in this country, and ours are split
into three or four synods which are already separate entities and the
boundaries between them are likely to increase.  Christians, according to
this site, make up about 75% of the population, and that population is
declining as more and more people opt for no religion at all, which is the
expressed preference in several states.

There is a cool map where you can find a breakdown of religions in your
state, too.  It's at the bottom.  Christianity has declined by ten percent
according to this poll within the last ten years.  And Wiccans are
gaining.  There are only about 200,000 right now according to the survey
but it said some Wiccans may worry about losing their jobs so they don't
self-report.  So there may be more.

Perhaps some of you will find this encouraging.  I think Murat will find it
so.

I had a hunch that there had to be some interest in matters of spirit for
there to be much interest in poetic scansion.  Somehow numbers and religion
go hand in hand all the way back to Parmenides.  Maybe because if you think
the world makes some kind of sense, one way to prove it is to do the math.
A lot of Corso's poems are aiming in that direction, such as The
Geometrician of Milano.  Luca Pacioli was an Italian geometrician who tried
to prove the world's coherence through geometry.  Parmenides and Zeno were
religious in their orientation to numbers according to Nietzsche.

Here's a link with the breakdown of numbers of religions in the US -- they
don't list political correctness, which I think is the biggest religion
among the young.  It's creed is very hard to pin down -- I think it is
something like respect everybody's uniqueness, don't judge anybody for any
reason, and allow each person to define themselves.

http://wwwreligioustolerance.org/chr_prac2.htm

I don't think race and gender define people to any great extent.  But
religion really does, because it's about a person's chosen beliefs, rather
than accidental exterior criteria which mean next to nothing.

I fucked up the link by forgetting to put a period after www.  At any rate, I'm
glad my poem ("lamentable" it was described as today!) has fascinated so many
people and caused such a great discussion.  Some time we could have a
discussion about bad taste, and what it is made up of.  Bad taste is a
specialty of mine, and I think I deserve a prize for it for almost every year
I've ever written anything.  Is the world in good taste or bad taste?  I say
it's a crazy funny mix, and I think poetry should not aim too high.  I love bad
taste as an aspect of aesthetics.  What constitutes it, exactly?  I think this
is ultimately a religious question, and helps us to understand various poetics,
as well as various poets, and their approach to God.  It is only by looking at
bad taste, and to some extent celebrating it, or at least focusing on it,  that
we can understand the underside of humanity, and thus have sympathy for fallen
humanity.  I don't know what I mean by this, but ask.

Which is more than a Kirby Olson would ever do. Please tell me that this
alleged person, who seems to measure political stance by length of hair,
amount of festoonery, and other measures of conformity to some bizarre
norm, is really a bot created to simulate a complete idiot. He's just
failed his Turing test as far as I'm concerned.

Oh boy and Oh man are also used in the negative sense, as in, what a bumnmer.

For your history of the term a source would help.

My father used to say it all the time. In fact when he was dying he
said it. But he told me that they all said it when he was a kid, and
he was born in 1907.

From the OED:

(oh) boy! a colloq. (orig. U.S.) exclamation of shock,
surprise, excitement, etc.; freq. used to give
emphasis to a statement that follows it. Cf. ATTABOY.

  1917 Amer. Mag. Mar. 13/1 ‘I told that dame I was
Kid Hanlon.’..‘Oh, boy!’ I yells. 1927 Punch 7 Sept.
263 Oh, boy, I feel good! 1930 D. H. LAWRENCE Nettles
17 And they blushed, they giggled, they sniggered,
they leered..and said: Oh boy!..that's pretty hot!
1934 M. HODGE Wind & Rain I. i. 18 Boy! They don't
wear a damned thing! 1942 L. D. RICH We took to Woods
(1944) ii. 34 Maine guides have a legend of quaintness
to uphold, and boy! do they uphold it. 1958 ‘N. SHUTE’
Rainbow & Rose i. 2, I slithered in over the fence and
put her [sc. the aeroplane] down and boy! was I glad
to be on the ground!

and here's the OED on attaboy:

[Said to represent careless pronunc. of that's the
boy! (BOY n.1 2c).]

    An exclamation expressive of encouragement or
admiration. Hence attagirl, etc., as nonce-wds.

  1909 Amer. Mag. May 40/2 Back of Chance's war cries,
‘At-a-boy’, or ‘Now ye're pitching’, may be hidden a
whole command to his team. 1917 C. MATHEWSON Sec. Base
Sloan xxii. 298 ‘Ata boy!’ called the Damascus
catcher. 1924 P. MARKS Plastic Age iv. 26 Suddenly one
of the girls..caught the bag deftly... ‘Ray! Ray! Atta
girl! Hot dog! Ray, ray!’ 1925 H. L. FOSTER Trop.

to encourage the new performer: ‘Attaboy, soldier!
Attaboy! Shake 'em doggies!’ 1927 Blackw. Mag. July
4/2 Cries, also, of ‘Attaboy!’ leave no doubt that the
greeting is not entirely British. 1929 WODEHOUSE
Summer Lightning xv. 286 ‘Give me two minutes to get
the car out and five to make the trip and I'll be with
you.’ ‘'At-a-boy!’ said Millicent. ‘'At-a-baby!’ said
Hugo. 1932 JAMES JOYCE in New Statesman 27 Feb. 261/1

Attaboy Printed across her paper sailor hat.

Best,
Joseph

Hey:

My computer's been in the shop for over a month and I've finally gotten
it back and completely functioning.  Yippee!!!!

I know that some e-mail had been sent back because my e-mail server
inbox filled up.  If you sent something and it was sent back to you or
you think that I might not have gotten it, please send it to me again.

Hope all is well with you.

Thanks,

In the latest Winter 2003/2004 Rain Taxi, there's an
interview with Peter Gizzi.  Gizzi says:

"It made me think of George Oppen talking about 'the
little words that I like so much, like tree, hill, and
so on.'"

Does anyone know, please, where the original Oppen
quote can be found?

Thanks.

After all, if you really don't think you can make some Alan, most people
are just trying to improve their lives and take, if you ever think of
Alan, this person almost missed out on getting Alan, we got sick and tired
of seeing GOOD PEOPLE fail and lose, Alan. Either way we need to know if
you're in or you're out because these people think FREEDOM the greatest
thing in the world, Alan. I have to agree with you at this point, Alan.,
Alan., Alan. That's O, Alan. K, Alan. I truly wish you the best and hope
you find what it is you're rewarding Alan, Alan. If you are no longer
interested in turning your computer into God, Alan. We hope this makes it
easier to understand, Alan. Now please go to the link just let me know,
Alan. I absolutely LOVE letting you know we placed another person under
you, Alan. like YOU, looking for these people under someone else who is
ready, Alan. you ever feel like giving me a chance to help you create
these or other people, Alan. After all, Alan, they value their freedom but
really would rather be under you, Alan.

I know perfectly well about mid-line trochees in iambic lines. Initial
trochees are a well-understood phenomena, they are called holding up the
line, as too regular iambic beats tend towards a kind of drowsiness, a
lulling regularity that outshapes the expectation of what will follow. My
point was that your statement that there was only one trochee in Kirby's
pseudo-poem was quite literally incorrect, the first line begins with two
and then resolves into iambs, afterwards the poem is just fudge. I know very
well about headless lines, but in order to do that you have to establish a
norm in the first place.

My own spirituality is in tatters, btw, I think evil runs this world, full
stop. Maybe its testaments will be published by SALT.

David,
that's what line-initially means in my last sentence: at the
beginning of a line--,,if a trochee happens line-initially or after a
caesura, it doesn't break the meter....but since Dan was asking if
anything could break the meter, if anything did it would be a trochee
in mid-line, not after a caesura, not line-iniitally--which you will
probably remember was Halle and Keyser's great discovery, yes?
(though obviously plenty of poets break this rule and get away with
it, anyway, as Thomas does in Do Not go Gentle into that Good
night...all a question of ear).

Though since I heard the whole passage as iambic and was using that
bottom line method, I was scanning the first line of Kirby's poem as
a "headless" iambic line with an anapest in third foot, which is much
simpler to my ear in an iambic context than scanning it with two
trochees, since it manifests the rising rhythm: (scansion:  (omitted
first syllable )WALK/ing SLOW /ly aLONG / the IC/ y ROAD)
However, scanning it as two trochees and three iambs makes sense to
me too, though in an iambic context I believe the general principle
is to keep falling feet (trochees and dactyls) to a minimum as much
as possible if you can easily scan it another way, which in this case
you can.

Of course you are entitled to your own trained ear.  I've heard too
many endless prosodic arguments to get into one.

It was one year ago today - the day of the then-infamous Blix report - =
that www.nthposition.com published the first Internet anti-war poetry, =
in book form, 100 Poets Against The War.  A week earlier, our first call =
for poems against war had gone out.  A year later, Iraq is still in the =
news, and tomorrow sees the Hutton report; less has changed than we =
hoped.

Still, with the help of tens of thousands of poets, readers, peace =
protesters and other cultural activists, and in tandem with like-minded =
organizations around the world, the peace-poetry-protest grassroots =
movement of 2003 made history.  We did not stop the war, but we made =
certain that the alternative voice, that of humanity at its best, was =
also heard.  To bear witness in dark times is not enough, perhaps, but =
is preferable to accepting illegal aggression.

I am writing today to thank you for all you did in 2003; and to remind =
you that it is not too late to get your own personal record of this =
remarkable moment in culture, politics, and global awareness.  Free =
ebook versions can still be downloaded at nthposition.   Perhaps more =
importantly, the Salt (Cambridge) version -published and launched in =
London, March 5, 2003 - is available at Amazon (UK and in America and =
Canada) for order; profits go to Amnesty.=20

Salt was the first publisher in the world to put their money, time and =
energy behind the poetry peace initiative, and their anthology deserves =
your support, now as much as then.  If you haven't already done so, =
please place an order today; or share a free ecopy with a friend.

Most of all, I wish to express my appreciation for the work you have =
done over the year, and to wish you - and the world in general - a =
better, and more peaceful 2004.

Yours,

Todd Swift
editor
100 Poets Against The War

ps Val Stevenson, editor of nthposition, spent hundreds of hours last =
year on this project, and I continue to shake my head in bewildered awe =
at her energy and commitment.  Thank you Val, for all your work in 2003.

Annie,

While I have respect for your ear, and with all respect to you, I
personally don't think the issue of naming meters matters all that much
here, except as a device for the poet to use if he or she is trying to fix
a line that sounds awkward, and even then only if he or she wants the poem
to sound like it's from an older tradition. I don't think language is
inherently metrical -- meter is something we impose on it later, or a way
of transcribing sound. There are too many things language does that meter
as an abstract system doesn't explain, like how speech acts and the type of
address, the tone of a passage, generative assonance etc., affect sound,
and it's worth exploring those. Why does a poem have to have some
overarching metrical "theme"? Why can't a poem move in and out of meter?
Why can't that pattern change moment-to-moment? Leap into the open! If you
look at it from this perspective my scansion makes perfect sense, because I
was not trying to question your expertise in your field (you are probably
the most knowledgeable one on this topic), but I was trying to point out
that the piece was not really as obviously iambic pentameter as you
claimed. If you respond by saying that "Skillful scansion is a
three-dimensional process, the creation of a kind of hologram, whose goal
is to capture the pulse that ties a metrical passage together.", well I
certainly can't disprove that because it's circular reasoning. We're back
inside the system of metrical rules, "shoulds" and "shouldn'ts" that I was
trying to work my way out of in the first place.

Though I respect your knowledge on the topic, I personally find meter to be
a little like talking about how much the clothes I'm wearing cost me when I
bought them at the store. I'd rather just wear the clothes and live in
them, if you know what I mean.

Best,

Tim

Responses to a few responses to the scansion issue & related topics:

Tim, you put it well to say that meter is a way of transcribing sound
and not an ideal or mechanical system.  With that in mind, scansion
needs to be sensitive.  In your scansion of KIrby's lines, yes, you
do account for each separate line in some kind of theoretically
accurate metrical way....but this scansion you posted is not
sensitive to the rhythmic dynamics of passage as a passage of verse.
Scansion is not a linear academic exercise whose point is to line up
a bunch of assorted feet in a row, as you do here with the apparently
deliberate goal of finding nothing in common rhythmically among the
lines.  Skillful scansion is a three-dimensional process, the
creation of a kind of hologram, whose goal is to capture the pulse
that ties a metrical passage together.  Occam's razor applies to
scansion probably more closely than to other areas of literary
inquiry.  If you are going to bother to scan some verse and want to
do it justice, you need to find the simplest way to transcribe the
shared rhythmic groove by listening to the passage as a whole, if it
will let you.  In this case, it will let you.

These lines of Kirby's DO share a common beat, audible to a
metrically-trained ear, and sure, you can  mark 'em up and "scan"
them as anapestic or trochaic lines or whatever you want, have a
field day, but the fact is that the only metrical context in which
they could all appear together is iambic pentameter, and each of them
can fit in that context with no distortion (one of the reasons some
people (not me) like the meter so much is because it can encompass so
many variations).  n other words,in this case, only iambic pentameter
explains the rhythmic beat that ties this quatrain together. So
iambic pentameter is the most "correct" scansion, in the sense that
it is the most intelligent scansion--not because you can't mark up
the accents dozens of other ways, but because only iambic pentameter
transcribes the SHARED groove, rhythm, beat, of each line.  These are
not very weird iambic pentameters, either, as I said earlier; If I
had time I am sure I could find exact metrical analogues of each of
these lines in the blank verse of, say, Frost.

So the scansion you posted lacks an overarching vision or ear, and it
also lacks sophistication, in that it misses very obvious conventions
of the meter (the caesura followed by a trochee, iamb, and
extra-syllable ending in the last line, for instance, is not at all
unusual in i.p.; to call it caesura dactyl trochee reveals your ear's
lack of familiarity with the conventions, as does your not hearing
the first line as a headless (acephalous) iambic, also a common
variation. This all sounds abstract but is really just a way of
transcribing a physical beat that is quite palpable if your ear knows
what to look for, like listening for the chord progressions in jazz.
Admittedly, scansion is subjective, but it's not COMPLETELY
subjective, and there are some cases where to insist on subjectivity
just reveals that you may not be as familiar with scansion as you
think you are (an understandable mistake when hardly anyone knows
anything at all about it and probably very few people could have come
up with a  metrical account as accurate as the one you did come up
with)

Dan, fyi, the spondees and caesuras wouldn't sink Kirby's Titanic,
but a couple of trochees in the wrong places would (cf Halle and
Keyser's classic essay "The Iambic Pentameter").  The tipoff for me
that it really was iambic pentameter was the fact that the single
trochee in the passage appears after a caesura--trochees (and
dactyls) are the only thing you really have to watch in iambics, and
you need to put them after caesuras or line-initially if you don't
want to sink it.

As for the whole issue of whether or when it is useful to look for
meter in nonmetrical passages (sorry I forgot who posted about
that--it was the person who knew that you can have an iambic
pentameter with only 4 beats--was it Rob?)--here's a thought on that
issue:  meter is either there in a text or it isn't; contrary to how
some people who are not very familiar with meter think about it,
meter does have an objective existence; you can't merely will
something into meter any more than you can will it into a certain key
in music.  And if it IS there, it's useful to talk about it to the
same extent it is useful to talk about lyric subjectivity or
alliteration or fractured stynax or any other poetic device:  useful
to discuss when it is used in a living way and interestingly, kind of
boring to discuss if it's not.

Kirby,

I'm sorry, but I can't let this one go. First of all, this "political
correctness" thing. It's like a paranoid conspiracy theory. The accusation
of political correctness assumes that all these discourses -- race, class,
and gender -- form some kind of unified leftist "front." In fact they
don't, and they are fighting each other all the time. Gender and race are
competing discourses, in a way. Good example: I attended college where the
queer white people practically never interacted with the African-American
activists, and I'm sure the two groups would have given you vastly
different pictures of the world had you asked. There's no one position that
"solves for" the politically correct. If this is the case, what's so
"correct" about any political position?

Secondly, I have to disagree with you that race and gender do not define
people to any great extent. I beg your pardon, but that's just an idiotic
thing to say. Historically and demographically speaking, being born a
certain race has been an extremely limiting factor for many in this
country. We're only into, what, the second or third generation of black
people after Martin Luther King and Malcolm X? Heck, being any kind of
MINORITY is a formative experience because it means you have little power
and fewer options than most people. As for the gender thing, that's a
little more complicated and I think can be most usefully understood as an
underlying  pattern that structures a lot of social interactions, creating
a seductiveness and exerting a kind of power too. I think gender also needs
to be understood in the context of feminism and the underlying cognitive
metaphors ossified in our ordinary speech. Gender is literally everywhere
in this territory -- your boss tells you to "get on top of" something, or
for example the aspiring middle class is put down by being called bourgeois
or "effeminate"...there's a kind of nasty undertone re: how we as a group
think about women woven throughout the language we use everyday. I mean,
it's REALLY obvious but something like being a "pussy" (whether this label
is assigned to a man or a woman, if we're dealing with the phallus rather
than the penis) for example, if not the still-enormous discrepancy of wages
between men and women, should point out that gender is a pretty damn
defining characteristic for anyone!

Best,

Tim



Here's a link with the breakdown of numbers of religions in the US -- they
don't list political correctness, which I think is the biggest religion
among the young. It's creed is very hard to pin down -- I think it is
something like respect everybody's uniqueness, don't judge anybody for any
reason, and allow each person to define themselves.
http://wwwreligioustolerance.org/chr_prac2.htm
I don't think race and gender define people to any great extent. But
religion really does, because it's about a person's chosen beliefs, rather
than accidental exterior criteria which mean next to nothing.

Dear Tim,

You may not have seen a later post where I said that your scansion
did point out rhythms that do exist in the lines in question, and
which would still be present as "cross-rhythms" that add to the
texture of the passage even if the passage is scanned as iambic
pentameter. Your scansion does point out those cross-rhythms very
sensitively... but I don't think it tells the whole metrical story of
Kirby's passage of fudge...

Since you HAD bothered to scan the passage, my point was simply to
point out that scanning it only as a hodgepodge of different meters
wasn't a complete scansion when there was an overarching rhythm
present as well....(not existing naturally in the language, no, I
agree with you there, but rather imposed on the language by Kirby,
the poet, whether consciously or un-)... you recall I prefaced my
whole discussion by saying, "if you bother to scan at all," which you
had in fact bothered to do.

  Whether scansion is worth doing at all is a whole other matter, and
of which poems.  My personal feeling is that if a poem is metrical,
often scanning can make me much more aware of how it works. Just like
knowing about the laws of perspective can help me appreciate a
drawing made according to those laws (and also, very important point,
realize the limitations of that drawing!).  But sometimes, you're
right, scansion doesn't shed much light at all.   Anyway, some like
to scan, and some don't, and beyond that there may not be a very
interesting argument.

Who ever said a poem "has" to be metrical or have an overarching
metrical theme?--that would be a ludicrous claim--lots of poems move
in and out of meter (that's the subject of my book ghost of meter,
actually) and plenty more have nothing to do with meter at all.
Maybe you are projecting some repressed inner compulsion of your own
here? My only point was that if there is an overarching metrical
theme, a good scansion will notice that. I don't think ignoring
something that exists, even if only on one level, even if it doesn't
account for all the language of a poem, is a real substitute for
informed eclecticism and openness.

There is so much fear attending on meter nowadays--I think the clue
to the source of your fear may lie in the phrase "older
tradition"--maybe you have repressed meter more deeply than it wants
to be repressed, writing it off into the category of "older"-itself a
category worth questioning (like older women, are older poetic
traditions supposed to just dry up and stop making trouble?)--to me
the questioning of the assumption that things that are older are
necessarily dead or worthless is one of the basic drives of
"post"modernism--anyway, when things are repressed too much they do
have a way of turning monstrous.  You could maybe just lighten it up
a bit? Nobody is forcing poetry to do anything.....just offering
descriptions of it.. . .

a call out for help on the poetics list:

i am looking to curate a show of "book arts" in june.  that said, i'm
realizing that the concept of the book as art is confusing and conflated
with many other things.  here in san francisco, it seems particularly
wrapped up in the concept of zine, which, perhaps because it's been done
before and is done again and again (possibly without much consideration of
form at this point), seems less interesting than the other progeny of book
arts that have emerged.  of course, i'm not even certain i know what the
definition of book arts is.  i only know that i want to define it as a
place where the book transcends its two dimensionality--both literally and
figuratively.  one of the most typical examples is that of letterpress,
where the page becomes, literally, three dimensional through the raised
surface of the paper.  i equally feel attracted to the books of theresa
hak-kyung cha as exploratory landscapes of "sense" in a book and also
compelled by the work of people like ian hamilton finlay, who, by making
something like little sparta, have taken the "book" to another level.  the
book is the yard, is the landscape.

am i off the mark here?  what do other people think?  can interested
listers chime in and briefly respond to my poll so that i can gather fodder?

1.  what is the most salient thing that comes to mind when talking about
book arts?

In my latest copy of The New Yorker there's an article about Lewis Macadams
and his 20 year campaign to restore the moribund LA River to something
vaguely approximating a pure product of America.  I haven't seen him in
many years, but I was delighted to read of his persistence and his attitude
of social action as an art form and spiritual practice.  Even some of his
poetry was quoted.  And the fact that his long quixotic campaign has begun
to show results delighted me even more.  I don't think anyone else noted
this here, and I thought it was worth bringing to this list's attention.

it's lovely and odd that the thread on meter has this
hermaphroditic title.

but sometimes also the "scanning" is unintentional--in
the ear only--this is only when one has listened to a
lot of it or read a lot of it. seeing how--for
example--eminem or gwendolyn brooks or james wright
flips a foot here or there--will register in the ear
without sitting and marking a lyric sheet or a poem

also understanding the laws of perspective will
increase the understanding of what George Braque or
Hans Hofmann or Farouk Hosny is trying to do in
painting which renounces classical perspective.

but to go back to the ghazal--is this why western
writers of the ghazal at first denied any of the
formal qualities (see Adrienne Rich's early ghazals or
Galway Kinnell's) and then (after Agha Shahid Ali's
rigorous campaign) continue to write the ghazals in
free verse rather than with metrical scheme as they
appear in Urdu?

and why do non-Indian folks want to Indian names as
Ka-zeem or Sha-heed or Na-heed when there are plenty
of trochaic names in English like Philip or Michael or
Robert that will teach one how to say Kazim, Shahid,
or Naheed?

Anyways--sorry that last part is a little unrelated.

Dear Summi

This is, in many ways, contested territory. I like the way you are thinking
about it, and I lov Theresa Cha's works, in book form and otherwise. I'm
surpised, though, that in San Francisco "zines" first come to mind, as the
Bay Area is a place rich in book making history of various kinds. You might
want to get yourself to the San Francisco Center for the Book
<http://www.sfcb.org/index.php3> at 300 DeHaro Street, and see what people
are up to there. There will be a range.

The most salient thing that comes to my mind is works, in book form, made
by artists; or, works made using the traditional arts of the book
(letterpress printing, hand papermaking hand bookbinding, etc.), but not
necessarily using them in traditional ways -- but as soon as I say this,
work of great offset-print book artists, like Brad Freeman or Todd Walker,
comes to mind.

There are so many historical and current works: just to throw out some names --

         William Morris
         Cobden-Sanderson
         Harry Duncan
         Claire Van Vliet
         Walter Hamady
         Frances Butler
         Alistair Johnston
         Richard Minsky
         Katherine Kuehn
         Ruth Lingen
         Pati Scobey

         and so many many more that it's difficult to know how to direct you.

         I'd also include work I've done at Chax Press and Black Mesa Press
before it. On this Buffalo list, there are probably several others who have
made interesting book arts works, certainly including Miekal And and,
recently, Kyle Schlesinger.

         Johanna Drucker is both an extraordinary book maker and something
of an authority in the field. You might consult her book, THE CENTURY OF
ARTIST'S BOOKS, the first chapter of which is online at
<http://www.granarybooks.com/books/drucker2/drucker2.html>. I've published
things in various journals, but they may be hard to find. There's a
catalogue still up online of an exhibition I was included in and involved
in back in August/September, Love and/or Terror: An Artists' Book Symposium
and Exhibition.

         I wrote, with a group of others, the introductory essay to
Breaking the Bindings: American Book Art Now, published by the Elvehjem
Museum of Art at the University of Wisconsin in 1983. That was one of the
first, if not the very first, museum-scale exhibitions of American artist's
books and book arts, and if you can find that catalogue, it's still a good
resource.

         I'm sure if you start some of these places, you'll get further.
Oh, I can't forget to mention the book edited by Steve Clay and Jerome
Rothenberg, THE BOOK OF THE BOOK,  which you should definitely check out.

         As far as definitions, I don't want to get into that territory
right now. It depends a great deal on how one approaches the field -- from
the standpoint of fine art, or from the standpoint of the tradition of the
book, or from somewhere else. I think Johanna takes on some of that in the
chapter referenced above.

Good luck!

Charles

I would add to Charles Alexander's wonderful list:
Betsy Davids--long time book arts professor at California College of the Arts
Peter Koch--master letterpress printer, Berkeley
Kathy Walkup--long time book arts professor at Mills College
Gillian Boal--head of book and ms. restoration at UC Berkeley Bancroft Library

These people are essential to any research and exhibition you may be planning
and they are all accessible and brilliant.

In case anyone missed this current Human Rights Watch report on Iraq and
issues of the legitimacy of the USA-Brit invasion and occupation, this
article from London's Independent does the job. I would suggest broadcasting
this piece among as many as possible.



No humanitarian case for Iraq war, says rights group

By Kim Sengupta

27 January 2004


The United States and Britain had no justification for invading Iraq either
on the grounds of alleged threats from illicit weapons and terrorism, or as
a humanitarian mission, an international civil rights group said yesterday.

The failure to find Saddam Hussein's weapons of mass destruction has left
President George Bush and Tony Blair claiming that the invasion was on
humanitarian grounds, said a hard-hitting annual report of Human Rights
Watch. It said that the West had done nothing when Saddam massacred Kurds
and Shias in the past, and there was no evidence of any continuing mass
killings at the start of the war in March 2003.

The report claimed that the US and British occupation forces had "sidelined
human rights... as a matter of secondary importance. The rule of law has not
arrived and Iraq is still beset by the legacy of human rights abuses of the
former government, as well as new ones that have emerged under the
occupation." The reasons given for war by Mr Bush and Mr Blair - WMD and
Saddam's alleged links with international terrorism - hadnot been proved,
said Kenneth Roth, executive director of the organisation.

He pointed to recent statements by David Kay, the departing head of the Iraq
Survey Group, that WMD were unlikey to be discovered, and said it was
unlikely that the Hutton report into the death of David Kelly would say
anything different. The document praised the American and British forces for
striving to minimise civilian casualties during the air campaign, and also
for being much more careful in the use of cluster bombs than in previous
conflicts. It condemned the Iraqi resistance for indiscriminately bombing
public areas.

The report maintained that it was "irrelevant" that the US had "unclean
hands" in its support for Saddam in the past, or that there were other
countries which suffered worse internal repression. Neither were good enough
arguments against military intervention on proper humanitarian grounds.

However, Human Rights Watch said the US-British attack on Iraq failed to
qualify on a number of grounds normally used as a test of justified
humanitarian military action.

There were no mass killings going on; war was not the only option - legal,
economic and political measures could have been taken; there was no evidence
that humanitarian purpose was the main one for launching the invasion; the
attack did not have the backing of the United Nations or any other
multinational body, and the situation in the country has not got better.

Mr Roth said: "The Bush administration cannot justify the war in Iraq as a
humanitarian intervention, and neither can Tony Blair ... such interventions
should be reserved for stopping an imminent or ongoing slaughter. They
shouldn't be used to address atrocities that were ignored in the past.

"Humanitarianism, even understood broadly as a concern for the welfare of
people, was at best a subsidiary motive for the invasion of Iraq."

He said: "Over time, the principal justifications originally given for the
Iraq war lost much of their force. More than seven months after the declared
end of major hostilities, weapons of mass destruction have not been found.
No significant pre-war link between Saddam Hussein and international
terrorism has been discovered. The difficulty of establishing stable
institutions in Iraq is making the country an increasingly unlikely staging
ground for promoting democracy in the Middle East."

Human Rights Watch criticises the US and Britain for not sending in more
troops after the invasion. This, says the report, might have prevented the
anarchy after the fall of Saddam's regime. Mr Roth said the Pentagon had
acted as if it believed that the Iraqis would welcome the soldiers with open
arms.

Human Rights Watch is a mainstream body with support across the political
spectrum. It does not have a policy of opposing military action.

Xperiment 05: a call for submissions for a poetry anthology (The =

2005 by Montreal-based DC Books (www.dcbooks.ca); to be edited by Todd =
Swift (www.toddswift.com).



Deadline for submissions: May 1, 2004



Theme: 50 Years after 1955, the Future Is Yesterday!

=20

1955 saw: the opening of Disneyland; the publication of Lolita; =
ultra-high frequency waves produced at M.I.T.; Hammer's The Quatermass =
Xperiment; the introduction of the first fluoride toothpaste, Crest; the =
International Air Pollution Congress (held in New York City); the debut =
of Scrabble; B-52s put into service; Ray Kroc's acquisition of =
McDonald's; Elvis's TV debut; Salk's polio vaccine; a time bomb on =
United DC-6 flight; Glenn Gould's "Goldberg Variations"; Eisenhower's =
upholding of the right to use nuclear weapons in defence; US Congress =
ordering all American coins to read "In God We Trust"; the deaths of =
James Dean, Wallace Stevens and Albert Einstein; and the birth of Bill =
Gates.



50 years later, on the cusp of 2005, we face global warming, mass =
species extinction, human cloning, nanotechnology (and grey goo), =
genetic engineering, bio-weapons, "the war on terrorism", Internet =
viruses (and spam), DVDs, MP3s, text-messaging, Mars exploration (and =
potential life on other planets), new virus strains resistant to all =
known medicines, hyper-surveillance technology...  "History" has moved =
on, from the Atomic, via the Information, to the Clone Age.  In this =
fearsome new world, innovative poetry can and will intersect with the =
cultural, political, environmental and scientific breakthroughs that are =
about to transform life (so that our near-ancestors may have unlimited =
lifespans and inhuman intelligence will be de rigueur).



The Moosehead Anthology X: Xperiment 05 will feature =
never-before-published "futuristic and/or hyper-new" poetry from =
America, Australia, Canada, Ireland, the UK, and elsewhere, focusing on =
just such issues - with an emphasis on the environment, science, =
technology, and amazing inventions - employing innovative, startling =
language representative of the present moment.   The aim is to seek a =
poetry that is both original in terms of content and linguistic play.

=20

Submissions: send as emails to Todd Swift todd@toddswift.com ; with "DC =
anthology: author's name" in the subject line.  No attachments will be =
accepted.  Send 3-10 pages of work.  Texts should be in the body of the =
email, along with a brief 3-4 line biographical note.

Religion as chosen belief?

That makes me laugh.  They don't say faith of your fathers for nothing.
Tho' I wish Dubya was still an Episcopalian.  We might at least be spared
the annoying rhetoric then.

The Plot Thickens at The New York Times Book Review
With a new Sunday book editor on the horizon, The New York Times takes a
hard look at its literary coverage paper-wide.


By Margo Hammond and Ellen Heltzel

Publishing insiders have watched nervously since Steven Erlanger became
cultural editor at The New York Times and began altering the focus of
the daily "Books of the Times." Well, they ain't seen nothin' yet. When
we sat down with executive editor Bill Keller last week, he promised
"dramatic changes" in the Sunday section now that head honcho Chip
McGrath is stepping aside. He also indicated that the top brass is
rethinking book coverage top to bottom.

Well, if you write non-fiction, review non-fiction, or prefer to read
non-fiction, break out the champagne. "The most compelling ideas tend to
be in the non-fiction world," Keller says. "Because we are a newspaper,
we should be more skewed toward non-fiction."

What's more, if you're perplexed or simply bored with what passes for
smart fiction these days, the Times feels your pain. More attention will
be paid to the potboilers, we're told. After all, says Keller,
somebody's got to tell you what book to choose at the airport.

And who will carry out this mandate? Regarding McGrath's replacement,
Keller won't name names yet. But he did say that they're down to three
or four finalists, none of them inside staffers. An announcement is just
weeks away.


Bill Keller
A big step in this process - and the one that may have sent the
higher-ups into brainstorming mode - involved inviting about a dozen of
the most promising candidates to write "diagnostic essays" on how the
Sunday section ought to change. The consensus: Reviews need to be more
varied in length, and more contentious. But that's just tinkering around
the edges. The bigger news concerns what will be covered. Author
interviews, a column on the publishing industry, a decrease in fiction
reviews and more about mass market books - this appears to be the recipe
for making the NYTBR less formulaic and more vital.

Although Keller's ascendancy has brought plenty of reshuffling at the
Times, in the case of the Sunday book review, perceptions in and outside
the paper seem to have meshed. Critics have dunned the section for
dullness. Even while praising McGrath's exceptional editing skills,
Keller made clear that he has different priorities.

"I love that Chip championed first novels," he says, then offers the
rhetorical question: But why take up 800 words when a paragraph will do?
Based on our interviews with Keller, McGrath, and Erlanger, top
management thinks contemporary fiction has received more column inches
than it deserves.

Bill Keller: "Of course, some fiction needs to be done ... We'll do the
new Updike, the new Roth, the new Jonathan Franzen or Zadie Smith. But
there are not a lot of them, it seems to me."

"Of course, some fiction needs to be done," Keller says. "We'll do the
new Updike, the new Roth, the new Jonathan Franzen or Zadie Smith. But
there are not a lot of them, it seems to me." He gets no argument from
Erlanger. "To be honest, there's so much s---," the new leader of the
daily arts section observes. "Most of the things we praise aren't very
good."

Traditionally, chief critic Michiko Kakutani has handled most of the
literary fiction for daily. Her star remains untarnished; Keller refers
to her appreciatively as "queen of the hill." Former movie critic Janet
Maslin has shown a predilection for commercial fiction, a taste the
Times endorses. As with most newspapers, management is obsessed with
attracting younger readers and sees mass market titles as one entry
point - as long as they're done, Keller says, in a "witty" way
appropriate to the Times' sophisticated reader.

Regarding daily coverage, under Erlanger the book review team has been
reduced from three to two (book reviewer Richard Bernstein has been
dispatched to Berlin, and his slot was given to a reporter). That leaves
freelancers to handle most non-fiction. But instead of reducing
coverage, Erlanger claims to be increasing it, using former Times
staffer Robert Berkvist to vet titles. Erlanger reinstated the weekly
review in his Saturday section Arts & Ideas, with emphasis on the more
topical releases from university presses. "We need to do more policy and
history," he says. "We need to be more urgent and journalistic."

For him, this means assigning books with hopes of eliciting some sparks.
Example: He asked Max Boot, a conservative on the Council of Foreign
Relations, to review "Freedom on Fire: Human Rights Wars and America's
Response," by Clinton Administration veteran John Shattuck. "I like to
mix it up," Erlanger says. "If I could start another Mailer/Vidal fight,
I'd gladly do it."

Some of the non-fiction books he reviews for "urgency" are poorly
written, he admits, but for him this is less important than the book's
contents. He and Keller, both prize-winning former foreign
correspondents, see books as a launching pad for discussion. "Book
reviews are partly a consumer service," Keller says, but they also
"should be written for people who don't have any intention of buying the
book."

So there's the recipe: Emphasize non-fiction books. Demote literary
fiction. Promote (judiciously) commercial novels. Cover the book
industry more and individual titles less (Keller says he intends to fill
the long-empty book publishing industry slot in business, which -- as
with other media beats -- requires "a thick skin to stand up to the spin
and the whining.")

Given its pivotal role in the marketing of books, the Times is likely to
accelerate trends already apparent in book publishing. The potential
implications are huge, suggesting bigger advances for blockbusters and
celebrities, including those who wish to exploit their "public service"
in the nation's capital, and scaled-down high-brow fiction lists, based
on the assumption that if such books can't get ink in the toney Times,
they won't have a prayer in USA Today or Entertainment Weekly.

Whether or not the Times' analysis of the market and its readers is
correct, it's based on logical reasoning. In the views expressed by its
decision-makers, too few works of fiction rise to the level of a "novel
of ideas" - that is, stories that express the concerns and issues of the
day as Dickens did. And given these odds, the Times would rather devote
resources to fostering debate than discovering and nurturing imaginative
writing.

I have refused to even look at the Sunday book section of The Times for years
on the principle that an institution which has treated poetry as if it does
not exist has very little to say to me on literary matters.

As for the daily book reviews, since the daily crossword puzzle (the first
thing I do in the newspaper) is often under the book review, I glance at the
review if its subject amuses me. I think what Ron is saying has been inherent in
the New York Times for years. As an object of literary ferment The Times has
been dead for a long time; this action will only remove a corpse from under
one's feet. (Ron, do you really read The Times for literary enlightenment?)

On the other hand, in my opinion, the investigative/political side of The
Times has been strengthened the last few years. For instance, have you read the
amazingly detailed series of articles on the dangerous work places in The
United States, which had front page coverage extending to the inside pages for days
about a year ago? This planned "change" of policy is an acknowledgement of
what kind of a place this newspaper has been. In that respect, it basically
removes some pretensions.

Thanks for providing this pointer, Pierre. It's a lovely, simultaneously
saddening article. I remember when Pedro Pietri first came to San Francisco
in about 1971 and read the yet unpublished Obituary at a storefront on
Valencia Street. It took everybody's socks off. I immediately invited him
-as the then Coordinator of California's Poetry-in-the-Schools program -  t=
o
read at Opportunity High School - an alternative place for "misfits". I wil=
l
never forget him facing about 10 of us while he read the Obituary - while
through a window to his back on to the school corridor we watched a Black
and Latino student slowly walk a beautiful Asian student back and forth, he=
r
eyes closed; as gently as possible, they were working to get her through an
overdose. As a visual and voice configuration, it was one migrant nation
talking to several, the parallels there, the magnetic survival insistence i=
n
the voice. It was suddenly as I, the teacher and the students had been
gifted with the actual center of a major "geist" for which the poem provide=
d
an extraordinary sense of measure. It was also the center of the birth of
poets at what were then still at the margins of color and origin and
acceptable gender.

I pray Pedro does well with healing in Mexico. His prints, indeed, are
large.

"Working Backwards," by Steven J. Stewart

To begin with the dog and work backward:
"Dog" refers to the problematics of unmasking
realism. This unmasking has been called
"walking the dog," an activity that has evolved

to the point that its broadest solution is death.
The dog's triumph is an emotional montage,
the triumph of the outburst. Modern innovations
in metaphysics are referred to as the "appropriate

care and feeding of the dog." Pure continuity
only exists in the absence of the dog, the absence
of all human terms. This goes beyond the mechanical
background hypotheses. The fluctuating strangeness

of intention establishes the dog's radical meaning,
which causes an explosion of bona fide
revolution, working against a vital, maturing
objectivity. The dog is more a connection

than an adornment--it shifts ramification away from
ambiguity. Art is the appropriate form of ideology
to adopt in this circumstance,
as long as the dog is not depicted.

how do poets get in the door and say, pay attention?  should hunger
strikes be threatened?  something more aggressive?

serioulsy, just varying length would at least be a start.  and they are
feeling competition from the Believer and the new Book Forum.  robert

Yes,  Lewis MacAdams work with the river is fantastic.  He's also been writing a book length poem titled THE RIVER (?) parts 1 and 2 of which were put out by Blue Press a few years back, & I'm pretty sure
more of which was recently published somewhere.  Any one have more info on this?

Creators have come to create book arts in many ways, I'm reading=20
Charles' characterizing book arts from the view of book makers who are=20=

all a product of very specific lineage of fine printmakers, pressman &=20=

binders. One could also come to BOOK ARTS via other media. Alison=20
Knowles has done a lot of work with books as larger than life=20
structures,  Bruce Licher's music group Savage Republic letterpress=20
printed record packages.  The Zaum poets in 1910 Russia published their=20=

multi color books on butcher paper using gelatine lithography (made=20
from horse hooves, no doubt), my friend Robert The has made a partial=20
income for years because he has become an absolute master at using a=20
scroll saw to turn thick black books such as the bible into book guns. =20=

He even shrink wraps them so they stay fresh.  & what of Duchamp's=20
Green Box sitting in the Philadelphia Museum of Art.  Fluxus produced a=20=

lot of multiples, especially something like the Anthologies.   or Luigi=20=

Serafini's  Codex Seraphinianus =A1=C4

My favorites that I've created are HYPOK CHANGS TREES, a hypergraphic=20
novel 1 inch by 2 inches ,,, available as an earring ;;; & an ongoing=20
bookwork I made many years ago called TO BE FILLED, all the pages of an=20=

encyclopedia glued together & a compartment hollowed out of the book. =20=

The instructions on the cover are to "read" the contents inside & then=20=

put something in the book.  My copy of the book (I think I've made=20
about 5 of them) has filled many times & I have a coffee can filled=20
with 20 years of traces of peoples interactions with it).

Also I would be inclined to look toward the net for innovative=20
approaches to bookart
----- to integrate the approaches of digital bookmakers
---------------& think of BOOK ART as an inclusive term which is as=20
much about  community, networking & culture making as it is making=20
books.

& you will often find me dividing book arts into 2 categories.  The=20
ones you can handle & touch & the ones that are precious & often under=20=

glass.

I second the recommendation to contact the San Francisco Center for
the Book -- if nothing else they'd be able to get you in touch with a
variety of letter presses, and letter press devotees, around the Bay
Area.  I would also recommend  not discounting the world of zines yet
-- there's certainly a subset of the zine set that produces work that
goes far beyond the clip and copy aesthetic.  If you have a budget
for it I would recommend going to the Alternative Press Expo when it
comes to San Francisco and checking it out.  There's almost always a
ton of hand-silkscreened work, really interesting collage, scrapbook
type art collections, colored photocopy polaroid collections, and
even some writing.  The APE set tends to be really interested in the
community of small production and there's a kind of free imagination
at work because of this.  If you've never been to APE, don't be put
off by the fact that it's mostly comics -- you'll find amazing work
by people like Souther Salazar, John Pham, etc.  And those are the
big names.  Right now I've got three books in front of me: 1) John
Pham's beautiful collection of "sketches, comics, detritus" called
Substitute Life.  It's got a hand-pulled cover (three layer) printed
on thick cardboard.  Inside are scraps of comics, sketches from
everyday life, etc., all reflecting on each other.  2) A tiny book
with a unique painted design on the cover called "a quiet story."
The story about being at the bottom of the sea and an octopus that is
in love.  There is no author's name given -- there's an astounding
amount of work out there that is concerned with itself and let's its
author/ego remain absent.  3) A book called "no one. no one at all"
by Daria Tessler.  The title page says "made by Daria Tessler" and
emphasizes the book as an act of assemblage rather than 'genius.'
It's a photocopied affair, but with nice cream covers and
hand-stitched binding.  There are beautiful wallpaper-like patterns
reproduced on every other page.  Anyway, I could go on and on about
this stuff.  You might also want to get ahold of either of the
curators of a show that I was part of at the Worth-Ryder gallery on
the Berkeley campus.  Jen Scappettone had a wonderful piece -- a
group of poems on transparencies hanging in relative space like some
kind of floating quilt-water of words.  Here's the flyer for that:

August 19, 2003

Contact: Worth Ryder Gallery 510/642-2582, Helen Miller helmutta@hotmail.com
Dates: September 9-19  2003
Reception: September 9  4-6pm
Hours: Tuesday-Friday 1-4pm
Cost: Free
Location: Worth Ryder Gallery, Kroeber Hall, UC Berkeley
Lecture: Means & Ends: Books Talk - September 17  6pm; Worth Ryder Gallery


         Means & Ends: Poetry, Prints, Sculpture and Artists' Books

                           Exhibition and Book Talk


Is a book a place for recording ideas or for developing them? What is
the difference between a bunch of poems and a book of poems? Does
gathering work into books further exploration of that work? How? How
does a story develop across the course of a book? In what font? On
what paper? Does it matter? What is a wall of poems? A book of
paintings? How is a wall similar to a canvas similar to a page? How
does one bind pages, paintings, or prints? How does one print books?
How are books made? What are books made of?

"Means & Ends" considers these and other questions in a selection of
artwork, artists' books, architects' journals, small press books,
letterpressed books, comic books and chapbooks written, printed,
published or designed by students and faculty from various UC
Berkeley departments. While the show centers on bookmaking and the
construction of other art using book forms, some of the work also
investigates the limiting and liberating roles that books can fill,
both literally and symbolically. Featured in the exhibition is book
designer and printer Les Ferriss, artists Emily Wilson, Lesley Baker,
Kevin Radley and Helen Mirra, poet and publisher Lyn Hejinian, poets
Jennifer Scappettone and Trane DeVore, and writer William T.
Vollmann.

Reception for the exhibition is Tuesday, September 9 from 4-6pm, in
the Worth Ryder Gallery.

Kroeber Hall is located at the corner of College Avenue and Bancroft
Way in the same building as the Phoebe Hearst Museum of Anthropology.
The exhibition closes Friday, September 19.


Means & Ends: Books Talk

In conjunction with the exhibition, book designer, printer and
lecturer Les Ferriss, Artist-in-Residence with the Consortium for the
Arts Helen Mirra, and Steve Woodall, Artistic Director of The San
Francisco Center for the Book, will discuss their interest and
involvement in book forms. Following individual talks, UC Berkeley
Art professor Kevin Radley and Art and English undergraduate Helen
Miller will moderate discussion of, for example, how and where
artists working in other mediums approach the form of the book, the
accessibility or inaccessibility of artists' books, and how
technology enhances or detracts from the impact of language. The
talks will take place in the gallery on Wednesday, September 17 at
6pm.


Helen Mirra is Artist-in-Residence with the Consortium for the Arts/
Arts Research Center for Fall 2003, during which time she will
prepare a new project for exhibit in the Berkeley Art Museum's MATRIX
series in Spring 2004. Mirra had a solo exhibit at the Whitney Museum
of American Art this past fall, and other recent one-woman shows in
galleries and museums in Chicago, London, Milan, and Vienna. A highly
interdisciplinary artist, she creates sculptural installations as
well as sound recordings, film and video works, and poetry.

Steve Woodall has been Education Director at The San Francisco Center
for the Book since its founding in 1996, and now serves as Artistic
Director. In 2000 he was an artist-in-residence at the Xerox Palo
Alto Research Center, where he helped to create a digital book arts
studio, part of the research project and exhibition XFR: Experiments
in the Future of Reading. In 2001 he and Emily McVarish developed an
intensive program at SFCB for the practice of artists' books.

hi ,
another person who might be interesting to you is Tara Bryan of Walking
Bird Press. She curated an international exhibition of artist books a
couple of years ago here in St. John's. I made a sound piece out of it.

13 ways of looking at poetry and politics
In this one-day symposium at the Emily Carr Institute (Vancouver, BC), =
thirteen poets will address the possibilities, practicalities, and =
improbabilities of poetry intervening in the political sphere. Through a =
reflection of their own practice and concomitant critical discourse, =
these 13 will present a number of ways of looking at poetry and =
politics. This interactive event will include readings, presentations, =
and a variety of discussions intended to engage with the following =
questions: how can poetry be read as a political act? what purpose might =
there be to writing, reading, publishing, and performing poetry? and =
what possible political futures can we read into the act(s) of making =
poetry?

I thank you all for your thoughts -- I have been to the Center for the Book
and definitely will go back there.  It is rumored that there is a vending
machine filled with artist books and it sounds lovely.  I've also seen some
shows that have inspire me--at the Center for the Book, at Southern
Exposure, at the Pond Gallery, and at Blue Books (which Brandon Downing
curated a few years back--to follow up on this was my intent for the summer
show).  Also, I have been to APE.  I don't entirely want to discount the
zine or the graphic novel--the latter I find more interesting than the
former and exists in abundance at APE.  But, one thing that I'm searching
for is a consideration of definitions?  What is book arts?  Are we all in
agreement that it runs the gamut?  Why?

In getting your thoughts, I feel that we've defined around, through
examples, what the practice is.  Charles, your post was very helpful in
anchoring me to a history of the literary book arts, where they cross with
or are poetry.  Some of which I knew and needed to be reminded of; some
which I will look at with fresh eyes.  With zines, there's also a history
there, but these histories aren't all connected, except, perhaps,
nebulously.  One could argue that a zine like, say, Cometbus is inspired by
Kerouac, but then again, you could argue that every writer in San Francisco
is inspired by Kerouac.

I wonder, too, about two types of book arts:  one, the quaint book, made in
small first editions and sold in (I am exagerrating here to make a point)
New Age stores alongside rainbow windchimes.  Delicately made and
lovely--but something about that takes a corner of the book arts spectrum
into craft.  Then, there is a field of book arts that seems to fall into
the category of "design" for me.  It has all the makings of design--things
that could be found at IKEA--not art.  All this, of course, is subject to
scrutiny.  Why do I feel this way?  What brings us back to the heart of the
book as art?

Summi,

I haven't been following the thread carefully, but as
I was reading the last post I started to think a
little bit about what a 'book' is and some of the
alternative structures that exist

Tarot Deck is sort of an unbound book of images that
contain lyric images but also a narrative of soul's
journey.

There is a japanese painter (I have forgotten his
name) that did a set of paintings called "Book of
Hours" which has been done as a book called "Hours" I
think

Loreena McKennit did an album called "Book of Secrets"
intended to work as a "book"--I think it does.

Maya Lin and Tan Lin did a "reading garden" for the
Cleveland Public Library which seems to me a "book"

The most breathtaking artists' "book" I've "read" is
without text, binding, or intent: the Agnes Martin
Room at the DIA Center in Beacon, NY.

also Christian Bok exhibited a piece (or was it
two)--sculptural pieces meant to be "books" at the
Poetry Plastique show a couple of years ago

there is another sculptor/photographer Farrah Ali (yes
a relation) who does these little "book objects" one
was great big plyboards bound in yarn with photographs
of Afghan villagers fading away to skulls etc that she
exhibited in winter 2001-2002 during the Afghan
campaign--another was a box that contained nine
six-sided cubes with different images, etc on them
that a viewer would have to assemble or scramble as
they like--

the question with the tarot to me is when did a book
become a book--what did we gain by binding them what
did we lose?

a deck can be laid out in many formations. how do
books create different structures--requiring
linearity, or denying it, etc.

Hi Tim, thanks for your post yesterday.

All I'm saying is that people have to pull their own weight. I'm going to try
and make this clear why I think this should be so.

I put myself through college working as a waiter in the Pocono Mountains of
Pennsylvania, loading boxes into trucks in the summers, working at places like
Kentucky Fried Chicken for years to save up for college.  I was accepted at
Harvard, Bennington, and places like that, but simply couldn't afford the
tuition.  So I went to Evergreen State College in Olympia, Washington.  After
college, I worked for many years as a secretary and a waiter, continuing my
education in night school at Seattle Community College, and other continuing
education programs at the U. of Washington.  At the same time, I started
writing for a variety of national journals.  I didn't have any help from
anybody -- and am glad about it.  It taught me to pull my own weight.

I think that self-discipline is what college, and life, is about.  If you can
develop that, you can succeed.

Work ethic.  I thought Weber was right on the money in his Protestant Work
Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism.

There's another aspect to survival: create a decent family, and stick with it
through thick and thin.

Instead of these two modes, I see many of my academic friends arguing that the
underclass deserves a handout, and that the sexual life of a married couple is
insufficient, and people should have many many partners in their lives (they
give freshman students Bataille and Foucault, for instance).

I sometimes wonder to myself if the academic elite isn't a kind of torpedo that
has been sent to destroy the poorest classes.

The only thing anybody will ever get for sure is from the sweat of their brow.
I think everybody who succeeds at anything knows this.  So to tell other people
you deserve a handout (rather than you must work like hell to get anything),
seems to me to be a disservice.

Secondly, to be waving Foucault at the underclass who do make it to college
seems to argue for promiscuity and a lack of self-discipline that is the last
thing that the underclass can afford.

This is a one-two punch (Marx-Freud) that I think may destroy any chance a poor
person has of achieving a decent life.  Foucault, Marx, and Freud all had a
tremendous work ethic, but they seem to argue that this is not the way to get
ahead.

I'd like to think about self-discipline in family and in work ethics.

I agree that there are a lot of poor people, and that people don't all start at
the starting line at the same place.  But rather than asking people to spend
all their time arguing for handouts, what I tell my students at least is that
they must work like crazy to get anywhere, and they are going to be better off
if they stick with the straight and narrow.

It may be that some poets like Rilke have written masterpieces in three days.
At some point I believe that they spent years mastering their art.  Maybe I'm a
complete idiot, but I don't think anything worth having comes for free.  Some
are more talented than others, but without a work ethic, those talents will not
come to much.  So I think that's what we should be teaching -- not resentment,
but work ethic, and self-discipline.

The super-rich and the super-talented can get by without those qualities.
Everybody else would probably be better off to learn them.  I'm not sure what's
objectionable about this message.

Tues Feb 3
New Langton Arts
1246 Folsom St
San Francisco
8pm

At the heart of Arteaga's project is the ancient metaphor of a journey,
transgressing boundaries, toward a dark wood: of getting lost to find
something. --Michael Palmer, 1998

Langton presents Alfred Arteaga and Catalina Cariaga reading from new and
recent works in a program of experimental poetry and creative non-fiction.
Arteaga, a celebrated poet and Chicano Studies scholar, reads from his new
manuscript, Frozen Accident, and from his published work. In his essays,
Arteaga offers perspectives on the world as a wandering poet, probing
themes of violence, change, conflict, racism, and human vulnerability.
Cariaga's poetry blends critique, history, autobiography and anecdote in an
exploraton of what it means to be Filipina-American.

The DIASPORA POETICS literary series brings regional experimental poets and
authors into Langton's theater to reflect on Diaspora and cultural production.

Born in East Los Angeles, Alfred Arteaga is interested in how language and
colonial history have informed Chicano identity. Mr. Arteaga is the author
of two books of poetry, Cantos (1991) and Love in the Time of Aftershocks
(1998). He is editor of An Other Tongue: Nationalism and Ethnicity in the
Linguistic Borderlands (1994), and author of the essay collections Chicano
Poetics: Heterotexts and Hybridities (1997) and House with the Blue Bed
(1997). He earned a PhD in literature from the University of California at
Santa Cruz, and is the recipient of a National Endowment for the Arts
creative writing fellowship (1995) and a Rockefeller Foundation fellowship
(1993). He currently teaches poetry in the Ethnic Studies Department at the
University of California, Berkeley.

Catalina Cariaga is the author of Cultural Evidence (1999). Her poetry,
part of a growing body of acclaimed Filipina-American literary work,
addresses her family's diaspora from the South Asian Pacific Islands to
California's coast, exploring themes of cross-cultural understanding and
confusion. A contributing editor of Poetry Flash, Ms. Cariaga received her
MFA from San Francisco State University and has taught on the adjunct
faculty of the New College of California. Her poems have appeared in Chain,
New American Writing and ZYZZYVA. Ms. Cariaga works in Berkeley and lives
with her husband and son in Oakland, California.

This measure question remains fascinating to me.  I wanted to see if I could
prolong the thread by asking two questions: relevance and rigor.

One of the poets I liked on this topic was WCW.  In the last essay to his Selected
Essays, is one titled On Measure -- A Statement for Cid Corman that appeared in
Origin, 1954.

Already 50 years old this essay is by now.  WCW opens by arguing, "Today verse has
lost all measure."

Sure there are still people making sonnets, even though all the grounds of our
beliefs (or at least his!) have shifted since the time people were making sonnets.

"A relative order is operative elsewhere in our lives.  Even the divorce laws
recognize that."

"Most poems I see today are concerned with what they are saying, how profound they
have been given to be.  ...  Thank God we're not musicians, with our lack of
structural invention we'd be ashamed to look ourselves in the face otherwise.
There is nothing interesting in the construction of our poems, nothing that can
jog the ear out of its boredom.  I for one can't read them."

He blames this on the French revolution and the idea of "freedom."  He dismisses
Whitman.

He then says, "Relativity gives us the cue.  So, again, mathematics comes to the
rescue of the arts."

And then finally this is all that he offers --

"We have today to do with the poetic, as always, but a relatively stable foot, not
a rigid one" (p. 340).

And I remember I was counting five beats in the lines of the hermaphrodite
quatrain.  In fact that's all I was doing. I wasn't even paying attention to the
imagery.  I was just letting words fly and counting the beats to five, and then
wrapping to the next line.

On another board there was a scream-fest concerning whether we had to write
sonnets in iambic pentameter in the contest.  Nobody actually did, but the contest
organizer said we had to do it. Even he didn't do it, eventually.

My questions to do with this -- first the whole language of quantification that
we've received seems to come from Latin.  Surely Latin had/has different rises and
falls than English, and then the American language sounds different again from the
British.  In London, the amazing rises and falls renders the language to be like
some kind of choppy sea by comparison to our relatively even stresses (to my ear).

Williams elsewhere talks about a three-stress line that he calls a variable foot.

I still haven't gotten Annie Finch's book, but wonder a lot about the importation
of the meter of the ghazal into American English, etc. that is argued for in the
book that I do have.  This is a funny question to play with -- the rigor of the
counting is quite difficult to get at, for one.  The Charles Olson poem I read as
tetrameter, but Annie added an artificial beat to make it iambic pentameter since
that was the way it seemed to be going to her ear. Others have questioned her
counting of my hermaph poem.  So there is the question of rigor.  There is then
the question of relevance.  I think this question has a lot to do with the
question of freedom, free will, determinism, what the world is like.  Those are
interesting questions.

I like that these questions have been reasserted.  After a century of endless
experimentation and what Dana Goia calls avant-garde posing, it's fun to think
that questions of meter and form could again be a fallow field.  Dana Gioa argues
that it could even be a popular field, as Vikram Seth's Golden Gate showed.  Do
the new formalists have a listserv?

Hi Kirby,

I agree with you that work ethic is important, but I think to say that by
itself will get you everywhere in life is really a lie. I mean, life is
really not fair, and one of the liberal assumptions I hold is that it can
be made fairer or more equal, because everyone deserves a chance. Fair as
in, we should have basic healthcare for everyone in this country like so
many other countries do, because we're human beings, instead of insisting
on some kind of Darwinian competition for a basic right like that. I don't
think that's a "free handout" -- access to good healthcare is a basic right
everyone should have.

The two other factors that affect us outside worth ethic are 1)the
circumstances you begin with, and 2)sheer luck, or the opportunities that
come your way. And Darwinian reasoning doesn't work with this, because just
because something worked in the past to help you succeed doesn't mean it
will work in the future. That's a logical fallacy. So, in a way "x got me
where I am today, so you should do x too" doesn't tell me anything about
what will helps others in other situations, really.

Furthermore, we have a lot of privileges as Americans, but I think it's
important to point out here that the American Dream is a lie, plain and
simple. Something like 40 % of people in America think they're going to get
wealthy when they start out, and less than 5% actually end up wealthy. That
discrepancy and that scam -- THERE'S your work ethic. And don't even get me
started on how much the government and special interests do to help the
poor get poorer...basically my point is there's a difference between
wanting to change things or insisting on basic rights for people and giving
them "free handouts."

As for marriage, well that depends upon how you define "family" -- plenty
of gays and lesbians have formed stable and lasting families, and those
that choose not to...well, who are you to judge those people?

Best,

Tim

least is that they must work like crazy to get anywhere, and they are going
to be better off if they stick with the straight and narrow.
It may be that some poets like Rilke have written masterpieces in three
days. At some point I believe that they spent years mastering their art.
Maybe I'm a complete idiot, but I don't think anything worth having comes
for free. Some are more talented than others, but without a work ethic,
those talents will not come to much. So I think that's what we should be
teaching -- not resentment, but work ethic, and self-discipline.
The super-rich and the super-talented can get by without those qualities.
Everybody else would probably be better off to learn them. I'm not sure
what's objectionable about this message.

Dear Annie Finch,

I've been following the discussion of Kirby's fragment
& its meter on the Buffalo Board & I am very curious
as to what you would cite as some free verse that
truly HAS broken away from regular meter.  I know very
little about prosody, but I, who maybe has no right to
an opinion on this matter, nevertheless confess to
being surprised that a line that begins with two
trochees can be considered iambic.  So what verse in
your view HAS really broken free, (in lines of
rhythmic vigor, not flatness verging on prose)?  Maybe
you can post an example of true freedom on the Buffalo
List (I am sending this backchannel because I don't
have a computer at home and my only e-mail adress is
tied up with my worklife & I don't have enough
computer capacity to receive the List).

Did you know that Charles Bernstein is becoming
interested in prosody, and will apparently publish
something on the subject?  So I read in a recent
interview with him, but I can't remember the magazine
(I was browsing through some magazines at a Grand
Central Station newspaper/magazine shop?)

I'm beginning to wish I knew about meter.  There's
something that interests me, for instance, in Albert
Cook's _The Classic Line_ about how all the accented
syllables in Milton's lines (at least in one phase of
J.M's career) are equal, rather than one accent being
stronger than the others.  Cook (who I studied with at
SUNY/Buffalo, but I don't remember him ever TRYING to
interest us in meter) says that this equality of
accent correlates with a "baroque" world view in which
there is a constant shift of emphasis.

=46inally, you, Annie, mentioned at one point, as
iambic, the last line of Olson's _Maximus_.  This
enigmatic line may actually be an echo of something
from Milton's _Samson Agonistes_, at least according
to a very interesting arguement from Canadian poet
Jeff Derksen. I found the following on the internet
once (but I can't seem to find it at present; I'm glad
I copied the paragraph). Its very odd to think of
Charles O. ending the poem with a Milton echo, but
this Derksen statement is not so dismissable and at
least rings much truer than Tom Clark's fancy that O.
had ended his epic with a personal catalogue of
losses.  Note however that Derksen has misquoted the
Olson line--he has reversed the order of "my car" and
my "color".  Fixing the quote only brings us closer to
Milton's line.

>=20 4) This are the closing lines of the penultimate
>=20 poem
>=20 of The Maximus Poems (Volume 3. Eds. Charles Boer
>=20 and
>=20 George F. Butterick. New York: Viking Press, 1975
>=20 unpaginated) which come just before the closing
>=20 lines,
>=20 "my wife my color my car and myself". This instance
>=20 of
>=20 closure is opened up by its relationship to
Samson=EDs
>=20 final speech in Milton=EDs Samson Agonistes::
>
>=20 "Happ=EDn what may, of me expect to hear
>
>=20 Nothing dishonorable, impure, unworthy
>
>=20 Our God, our Law, my nation, or myself;
>
>=20 The last of me or I cannot warrant" (1423-26).
>
>=20 Olson here has constructed himself as a Milton
>=20 figure.
>=20 A poet who addressed his nation and who attempted to
>=20 create a nation of readers ("fit though few"). The
>=20 previous pages of The Maximus Poems further build on
>=20 this connection. Olson writes: "but now I am a poet
>=20 /
>=20 who thinks more than writes...". I read this as an
>=20 allusion to both Milton=EDs and Olson=EDs
emphasis on
>=20 praxis -- both social and textual. Olson then has
>=20 moved from an address to his nation as "I, Maximus
>=20 of
>=20 Gloucester" to a somewhat despondent poet who is no
>=20 longer writing. This parallels Milton=EDs
construction
>=20 as a split figure: the political and spiritual
>=20 writer
>=20 and the Restoration defeated revolutionary writer.
>=20 This intertextual connection opens a different field
>=20 to view Olson in, one that emphasizes his role as a
>=20 national poet, one who sought to address his nation
>=20 at
>=20 a specific historical juncture (post-war America for
>=20 Olson, revolutionary and Restoration England for
>=20 Milton) through an epic poem. And both poets sought
>=20 out a new form for their national epics:
Olson=EDs
>=20 postmodernism on the cusp of the modernist intrigue
>=20 with the relation of the one to the many which
>=20 utilized an open field composition, drawing on (like
>=20 Pound) discourses and images from a huge temporal
>=20 and
>=20 cultural range. Milton, for his part, used his blank
>=20 verse for Paradise Lost (and likewise we see Spenser
>=20 create a unique verse form for his national poem,
>=20 The
>=20 Faerie Queene). Olson in some ways inserts himself
>=20 into literary history through Milton, but he also
>=20 makes parallels to place himself as a national poet.

Dear Prof. Laity--

I've long been intending to submit a piece for this special issue, and now
can only plead the usual form of junior-faculty over-extendedness.  If I
were to have my submission in the mail at the beginning of next week, a few
days after deadlline, might you still consider it?

Hi all
I will be doing a residency at Cornell Uni between May-July and I
desperately need affordable accommodation close to the Ornithology Lab. If
anybody knows anyone with a spare room or cheap apartment or a home that
needs some house sitting, please let me know backchannel. I would really
appreciate some help with this.

Aspects of kari edwards' poem "wanta revolution" brought back echoes of =
d.a.levy's pre-computer era [read "mimeo generation"] "Tombstone As A =
Lonely Charm" [part 3], which reads in full:

if you want a revolution
return to your childhood
and kick out the bottom

dont mistake changing
headlines for changes

if you want freedom
dont mistake circles
for revolutions

think in terms of living
and know
you are dying
& wonder why

if you want a revolution
learn to grow in spirals
always being able to return
to your childhood
and kick out the bottom

This is what ive been
trying to say - if you
attack the structure -
the system - the establishment
you attack yourself
KNOW THIS!
& attack if you must
challenge yourself externally

but if you want a revolution
return to your chi9ldhood
& kick out the bottom

be able to change
yr own internal chemistry

walk down the street
& flash lights in yr head
at children

this is not a game
your childhood
is the foundation=20
of the system

walk down the street
flash lights in yr head
at children but be wary
of anyone old enough to kill

learn how to disappear

before they can find you

(that is, if you want to
stay alive)

if you want a revolution
do it "together"
but dont get trapped in=20
words or systems

people are people
no matter what politics
color or words they use
& they all have children
buried in their head

if you want a revolution
grow a new mind
& do it quietly
if you can

return to your childhood
and kick out the bottom
then become a being
not dependent on words
for seeing

whenever you get bored
change headlines
colors politics words
change women

but if you really want
a revolution
learn how to change=20
your internal chemistry
then go beyond that

walk down the streets
& flash light at
yourself

Recent work, poor and otherwise.


Some of my recent work has been terrible. Since "shining upwards," I've
been off. The following texts are the only ones that are decent. The rest,
including "v*ral" stars and bones," seem tired. I've removed them. If
you're tracking my work, please remove them as well. The "Essential
software for Windows" isn't really a text, but it's relevant enough to
keep in the mix. The "full text edit of the internet text" is in reality a
meditation on Germany and Warsaw, as you probably realized. "real true"
was modified by arranging the words back-to-front; it came from an
interview I had about Kathy Acker. "great art" is a modification of "real
true"; I'm not sure about it. "lastempire.mov" took close to a day to
produce, although the results are simple, but only on the surface. about
sixteen seconds and silent. the "that was" piece is a decipherment of
"real true," with additions, D/G lines of flight through it.

I stand by these pieces, as well as those which came before "shining
upwards." The rest are dubious and embarrassing.

Are you serious? Those machines are pretty weighty to UPS around. I've
also got a few cartons of unused electro stencils, but am not sure about
the condition.

Afghan President Rubber Stamps New Constitution
by Gram O'Cracker
The Assassinated Press


They hang the man and flog the woman
That steal the goose from off the common,
But let the greater villain loose
That steals the common from the goose.

".....at a time when I am speaking to you about the paradox of desire -- in
the
sense that different goods obscure it -- you can hear outside the awful
language
of power.  There's no point in asking whether they are sincere or
hypocritical,
whether they want peace of whether they calculate the risks.  The dominating
impression as such a moment is that something that may pass for a prescribed
good; information addresses and captures impotent crowds to whom it is poured

forth like a liquor that leaves them dazed as they move toward the slaughter
house.
One might even ask if one would allow the cataclysm to occur without first
giving
free reign to this hubbub of voices...."

MIME-Version: 1.0

Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable

New from O Books=20
(available from SPD:1341 Seventh St., Berkeley, CA 94710. Or from O =
Books: 5729 Clover Drive, Oakland, CA 94618)
Brenda Iijima's AROUND SEA is $12.00, ISBN # 1-882022-51-3.
Jackson Mac Low says about her book: "Brenda Iijima's AROUND SEA is a =
substantial, beautiful, and manifoldly interesting book of poetry. Her =
focus shifts smoothly from sonic word-play to informational passages =
drawn from natural sciences and even metallurgy to ecology and =
passionate urban sociology, and onwards. Her forms often change =
radically from one section of a poem to another and her rhythms are =
constantly chaning. Readers are happily kept on their toes."
Anselm Berrigan says about the book: "Elements, moods, poisons, =
obstacles; Brenda Iijima's poems make use of all four, particularly =
elements, in forming the core of AROUND SEA. There is a strange, =
welcoming warmth to these poems that has nothing to do with forcing a =
personscape onto the land (though Iijima is starkly aware of that =
force's inexorable severity): 'a terrestrial in the face of extra.' I =
feel calm during and after reading AROUND SEA--not abducted, but =
included, as if presence could override fate through seeing, and getting =
it down onto the page."
    Fanny Howe says, "A brilliant visual and musical work, where the =
techniques of our times are perfected and abandoned one by one. What =
goes up, comes down, until the only way out is with it."

Tim, maybe you think I said something about gay marriages somewhere. I actually
have very little effect on public policy in this country.  It's funny to me how
everybody wants to get married, and people blame me for not being able to do
it.  I think this is part of getting older possibly.  I'm now blamed for
everything.

My daughter is 4 and has met this boy named Jeffrey (also 4) at Play School.
They want to get married, and she holds me responsible for her perpetual
unhappiness in regards to it.  I've only questioned whether Jeffrey could
support her, but she doesn't really know what this means.  She doesn't however
appreciate being questioned, and gets rather cross.

Did you see the new Edward Albee play?  It features a man who has left his wife
in order to live with a sheep.  He loves the sheep!  He wants to marry the
sheep!  The sheep looked a little noncommittal to my eye, but perhaps it was
just being sheepish.  At any rate, how do you ascertain consent on the part of
a sheep?  When I ask these questions people think I am being illiberal again,
but I wonder about things like sheep's rights.  If the sheep is trembling with
love then let the bells ring!

In fact, I think everybody should get married!  I think doves should marry
balloons claiming that their hidden commonality is that they fly, and ants
should marry porpoises, citing Lautreamont's sewing machine and umbrella.  If
they can be together, why not all kinds of passionate combinations?

I'm not telling my daughter she can't marry Jeffrey.  I've even told her where
the courthouse is.  I actually encourage her to be as independent as possible,
and heck, if she can swing this, I'll throw some rice with the rest of the
village.

They want to get married, and she holds me responsible for her perpetual
unhappiness in regards to it.  I've only questioned whether Jeffrey could
support her...

PS Seriously, Kirby, now I've finally got to say something. I hope
you open your mind about this issue before your daughter gets any
older. Do you honestly think you could raise a healthy and happy girl
in this culture today on the assumption that marrying implies that
she will be supported? (or a happy and healthy boy with the reverse
assumption?)  Whether or not that ends up being the case, to raise
her expecting it sounds like a recipe for a definitely miserable
young womanhood followed by a probably miserable marriage.

Annie, very happily married and not at all supported

Kirby has recently argued for the importance of a good work ethic.  I
might argue instead that the "work ethic" is something of a pathology in
this country, as well as a nice political instrument for keeping everyone
too busy to cause any trouble.  Nevertheless, I *am* interesting in how
people manage to get specifically poetic work done, and I don't think I've
ever seen a thread quite like that in all the time of been on the list.
I'm not talking about poetic methods, which have been discussed from time
to time, but about exactly how and when the work gets done.  Do you get up
early in the morning?  Stay up late at night?  Write during your lunch
hour?  "Steal" time while you're supposed to be doing other things at the
office?  Do you rely on bursts of inspiration, or set aside regular hours?
Are regular hours necessary in order to prepare for (eventual) bursts of
inspiration?

I'd be especially interested in hearing how people manage to find time for
poetic work in the face of other obligations like teaching or
other wage-earning work, child care responsibilities, and so on.  Do you
try to "block out" other "distractions," or do you try to integrate poetry
with other sorts of life activities?

Lastly, do you actually think of poetry as work, or is play a better term?
Or is the distinction an unnecessary one?

I've decided I'm all in favor of what the Times Book
Review is doing.  Why?  Because the worse it and its
imitators become, the sooner intelligent readers will
search out and find literary discussions of value on
the Internet--like Ron's.

Alexander, did you mean to post this to the list?  Yes, after I had my =
daughter my whole viewpoint changed.  I used to believe in anarchism and =
postmodernism.  I became a Lutheran only at her baptism.  Hoping to heck =
that God would help me protect her!  And I shifted to the right slowly =
only because of her.  I am somewhere between Kerry and Bush.  I don't =
know which one of them will make life worse for my daughter.  Good =
points, and funny history.  Why not post it to the board?=20

alexander saliby wrote:=20

  Kirby,We share a great many prejudices I see...I share completely the =
views espoused here by you.  But there's more. I'm now 64 and have =
evolved to these views.  Let's look at the comments I might have made at =
different times in my life: At 17, from my basement hole on McDougal St. =
in Greenwich Village, I'd have replied something like, "Yeah, that's =
because you're an old and worn out creep incapable of getting it up as =
often as you'd like and you just want all the rest of the world to =
suffer your same inadequacies. " At 23, from my classroom where I was =
teaching 9th  grade English Composition and 11th  Grade American Lit, =
I'd have taken a slightly different stance, wondering why you seemed to =
be so much against the idea of free love and fucking your students as a =
means of helping them grow to enjoy the physical pleasures of a rich and =
varied sex life, particularly the 17 and 18 year old young ladies who =
seemed so to be in need of attention (and of course, twas I who needed =
the attention, not the innocent young ladies). At 33, from my office on =
the 7th floor of an Atlanta business complex, I had begun to soften my =
stance and adjust my views...I had kids in school, a mortgage, two =
automobiles and the car payments required to support the vehicle's =
loans, a dog, a cat, three kids and a house in the suburbs that was =
sinking under a mortgage I could barely meet monthly along with all my =
other expenses.  But, I kept my nose to the grindstone.  I put my head =
down, grabbed the ball and took off for the goal-line, without shoulder =
pads, or a cup protector.  And I would have shot cold dead any bastard =
English or other teacher who pretended to be "teaching" my kids but was =
really just out to fuck my now 16 year old step-daughter. At 53, from =
the deck of my retirement home, children all grown and out of the house, =
but with Gkids swarming through my living room at regular intervals, I =
take yet a different view.  I know this: nobody, no family member, no =
society, no city, state or Federal agency gave me one penny.  I =
borrowed, but I paid it all back, mind you;  I worked, I had help from a =
working spouse, and together, we struggled, doing without a great many =
luxuries during the early years of our marriage.  And at the end, we had =
sent three off into the world to make their own way, and they all three =
seemed to still care about us.  And none of the three, at least at this =
writing, sucks the public tit, neither are they wealthy.  They work; =
they struggle to raise their families, pay their taxes, and hold their =
own in the day to day drudgery of living. At 64, still in the same =
retirement home, though it has been remodeled, I marvel at the ability =
of the young to tolerate the condescending tones of their elders.  And I =
delight in the fact that my grandchildren flip the finger to the =
horseshit they hear broadcast on the network news, and I say nothing to =
them, but I think...you're right, kids, they're feeding you the =
storyline bullshit...go get 'em! I have in fact come full circle...in my =
youth I embraced anarchy; I moved toward socialism; branched out to =
become a full-blown communist, shifted to the ranks of a social =
democrat, meandered into Republicanism and the near right wing, teetered =
back to  the left, and at the moment, I embrace the road of =
middleoftheroadism, if there is such a disease. Funny, isn't it, how as =
one ages ones values drift to a place far less self-gratifying and =
filled with broader, more humanistic concerns.  At 18, I really didn't =
give a good god-damned who I had to abuse, misuse or fuck over in order =
to get what I wanted...and I wanted everything, mostly because I had =
begun with nothing.  I now own stuff I don't want to lose, most of them =
humans. Sorry for the long-winded comment, but I felt you were a tad off =
target in that you weren't coming to grips in your own right of changes =
through which I know you too have gone...and will continue to undergo.  =
Tell me, how old are your children?  Are they daughters?  One feels =
differently toward the world when one looks at his daughter (or =
step-daughter, as it was in my case).  Some how, I knew the two boys =
could handle things; I was never so sure about the young lady. Turns =
out, she was the strongest of the three...but who knew that when she was =
nine?Alex=20

    Subject: Re: scansion and/as religion
     Hi Tim, thanks for your post yesterday.=20
    All I'm saying is that people have to pull their own weight. I'm =
going to try=20
    and make this clear why I think this should be so.=20

    I put myself through college working as a waiter in the Pocono =
Mountains of=20
    Pennsylvania, loading boxes into trucks in the summers, working at =
places like=20
    Kentucky Fried Chicken for years to save up for college.  I was =
accepted at=20
    Harvard, Bennington, and places like that, but simply couldn't =
afford the=20
    tuition.  So I went to Evergreen State College in Olympia, =
Washington.  After=20
    college, I worked for many years as a secretary and a waiter, =
continuing my=20
    education in night school at Seattle Community College, and other =
continuing=20
    education programs at the U. of Washington.  At the same time, I =
started=20
    writing for a variety of national journals.  I didn't have any help =
from=20
    anybody -- and am glad about it.  It taught me to pull my own =
weight.=20

    I think that self-discipline is what college, and life, is about.  =
If you can=20
    develop that, you can succeed.=20

    Work ethic.  I thought Weber was right on the money in his =
Protestant Work=20
    Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism.=20

    There's another aspect to survival: create a decent family, and =
stick with it=20
    through thick and thin.=20

    Instead of these two modes, I see many of my academic friends =
arguing that the=20
    underclass deserves a handout, and that the sexual life of a married =
couple is=20
    insufficient, and people should have many many partners in their =
lives (they=20
    give freshman students Bataille and Foucault, for instance).=20

    I sometimes wonder to myself if the academic elite isn't a kind of =
torpedo that=20
    has been sent to destroy the poorest classes.=20

    The only thing anybody will ever get for sure is from the sweat of =
their brow.=20
    I think everybody who succeeds at anything knows this.  So to tell =
other people=20
    you deserve a handout (rather than you must work like hell to get =
anything),=20
    seems to me to be a disservice.=20

    Secondly, to be waving Foucault at the underclass who do make it to =
college=20
    seems to argue for promiscuity and a lack of self-discipline that is =
the last=20
    thing that the underclass can afford.=20

    This is a one-two punch (Marx-Freud) that I think may destroy any =
chance a poor=20
    person has of achieving a decent life.  Foucault, Marx, and Freud =
all had a=20
    tremendous work ethic, but they seem to argue that this is not the =
way to get=20
    ahead.=20

    I'd like to think about self-discipline in family and in work =
ethics.=20

    I agree that there are a lot of poor people, and that people don't =
all start at=20
    the starting line at the same place.  But rather than asking people =
to spend=20
    all their time arguing for handouts, what I tell my students at =
least is that=20
    they must work like crazy to get anywhere, and they are going to be =
better off=20
    if they stick with the straight and narrow.=20

    It may be that some poets like Rilke have written masterpieces in =
three days.=20
    At some point I believe that they spent years mastering their art.  =
Maybe I'm a=20
    complete idiot, but I don't think anything worth having comes for =
free.  Some=20
    are more talented than others, but without a work ethic, those =
talents will not=20
    come to much.  So I think that's what we should be teaching -- not =
resentment,=20
    but work ethic, and self-discipline.=20

    The super-rich and the super-talented can get by without those =
qualities.=20
    Everybody else would probably be better off to learn them.  I'm not =
sure what's=20
    objectionable about this message.=20

Someone had named her Mariana. Pidgin is elastically
passed around with some enthusiasm, still suffused
with unusual laities. Pills imbrobably beckon.

"I would want to live in vivid nicks awash on your
knees, sour but still robust." Auch Brain Drain. Some
pale days of never sleeping. Pelted with levitation.
"A freezing rain will eat the roads. Pounded by dead
ivy faces scabbing over with rude glaciers. Some
soldiers home from the war. It's very hard to walk
in." But approaching Oberlin Avenue from North Ridge
road, nearing the cemetary.

Blue tunnel, tongue of road. Blue nights with flurries
of stars.

Mike's car when we go outside skinned with ice gleams
the way trains moan in a distance cold with Ohio.
German chocolate cake punctured by my mouth a hole of
hungry filling. Beats pulse from the subwoofers,
lacing Matt's house with heartbeats. Later Evelyn
comes home. I stand pertinently still among the rough
and dirty boys of Lorain. Each of us is a roofer, or
builds cars in a factory. Our trucks roar that we are
hard. You, as far away as you always were, don't
respond when I cry out in the small hours of night.

I often wake up long after my body has made coffee and
opened a mute window. The silence then mentions trills
as so many recursive curls in verbs. You let the city
go to your head.

"I have some friends to whom narrative is an
intractable essence. It may be that message and source
are the same thing, as well as act and potential.
Woof, woof,woof."

4. Soft Skull's been heavily covered in the industry newspapers recently. In
the past two months Publishers Weekly has covered Soft Skull prominently,
and just last week the Canadian publishing magazine Quill and Quire also did
a feature story on Soft Skull, calling us "one of the most visible and
respected alternative house in the U.S., Soft Skull [is] like Grove Press in
the 1950's and 1960's."

Below are excerpts:

On Soft Skull's How to Get Stupid White Men Out of Office
http://www.softskull.com/detailedbook.php?isbn=1-932360-08-5

"In a publishing experiment that may help their titles stand out this
spring, two small presses distributed by PGW are joining forces with
like-minded political organizations to publicize and market "political
self-help" books that have hefty first printings. In March, Soft Skull Press
will publish How to Get Stupid White Men Out of Office ($12.95), a
collection of political success stories that doubles as a guide to "throwing
the bums out" in 2004. Slated for a 60,000-copy first printing, the trade
paperback is edited by political activist William Upski Wimsatt, whose
previous paperback originals Bomb the Suburbs (2001)
http://www.softskull.com/detailedbook.php?isbn=1-887128-44-5 and No More
Prisons (1999) http://www.softskull.com/detailedbook.php?isbn=1-887128-42-5
have together sold more than 100,000 copies for the 10-year-old Brooklyn,
N.Y., press. The contributing writers are members of the League of
Independent Voters, which helps develop coalitions of gay, punk, black,
 Latino and young people around the country To promote the book, Soft Skull
will distribute 20,000 free copies to youth-oriented nonprofit groups,
after-school programs and political organizations. The press will also give
out books at more than a dozen conferences and conventions across the
country...." Publishers Weekly, Jan 19, 2004



Soft Skull Graphic Novels: Smart, Visionary Books
"While large book publishers such as Doubleday, Random House and
HarperCollins have been getting into graphic novels with mixed success,
smaller publishing houses are also dipping their toes into the comics pool.
One of them is Brooklyn's Soft Skull Press, best known for publishing works
from New York's cultural underground and for politically provocative titles,
such as the controversial reprint of the George W. Bush bio Fortunate Son
http://www.softskull.com/detailedbook.php?isbn=1-887128-84-0. The
10-year-old publisher has had a hit with Get Your War On by David Rees
http://www.softskull.com/detailedbook.php?isbn=1-887128-76-X, which has more
than 30,000 copies in print. Using clip art featuring banal office workers,
Rees has been skewering the war and right-wing politicians in a series of
brutally funny conversations. The strip started as an e-mail and became a
water-cooler phenomenon following 9/11....Soft Skull also publishes
underground artists associated with the political comics anthology World War
III, such as Seth Tobocman (Portraits of Israelis and Palestinians
http://www.softskull.com/detailedbook.php?isbn=1-887128-83-2) and Fly
(Peops: Portraits and Stories
http://www.softskull.com/detailedbook.php?isbn=1-887128-82-4). Other Soft
Skull graphic novels include Nate Powell's Tiny Giants
http://www.softskull.com/detailedbook.php?isbn=1-887128-56-5, an
impressionistic account of growing up. While Soft Skull is expanding overall
from 32 books this year to 45 next, Nash hopes to publish three to six
graphic novels a year. He sees comics as being squarely in the subversive
mode that the house specializes in. "There is a void right now [in
challenging 'official' opinion], and comics and cartoon artists seem to be
filling the breach. It is very much a part of Soft Skull's agenda to assist
artists who are looking to really communicate about society," he noted. "By
publishing graphic novels," Nash continued, "and pushing them into
traditional stores, we're opening opportunities for readers to encounter
something new." Coming in April is a perfect example: The Art of the
Possible! http://www.softskull.com/detailedbook.php?isbn=1-932360-18-2 by
the American poet Kenneth Koch. Nash described it as "a book of poems that
are, in fact, comics." Soft Skull is also beginning to draw the attention of
other noted cartoonists. Megan Kelso, an Ignatz Award-winning cartoonist, is
editing Scheherazade, an all-woman comics anthology due next fall."

I agree that the work ethic is primarily a means of social control, since
most jobs I've had were bureaucratic and accomplished virtually nothing
directly. Most work essential to survival could be done in about three hours
every day, I suspect.

In the years I was gainfully employed, I learned to do my work quickly so
that I could sneak in writing time during working hours as well as lunch.
I considered the job my "unofficial government grant." Some co-workers tried
to make trouble for me for writing on the job, but I always did what the job
required first. And, it turns out, I did more extra work than most of them.
I also put in 2 or 3 hours after work, usually extending a 45-minute dinner
to several hours in the process.

Now that I've retired, I spend an average of 5 hours a day writing or
sending out material or performing other writing-related activities. I also
get to eat warm dinners, which is very nice. I still write during lunch.

I get up early to do my work so that my wife and I can have time together
later in the day. I keep a regular schedule because in my teens and early
20's, when I wrote more on inspiration, I didn't finish many projects. I
learned the value of a daily routine in the 3 years in my mid-20's when I
studied jazz bass because I was unable to write. Musicians don't improve
unless they practice daily. I discovered this applies to writers, as well.

A lot of inspiration comes from preparation, I think, not unlike the saying
about luck being a combination of preparation and opportunity.  The more you
know your craft, the more you've trained your mind to generate "inspiration"
and trained yourself to produce work even when "inspiration" isn't there.
(As in baseball, some days you don't have your fastball, so you really on
guile and junk pitches.) Part of craft, I think, is training your mind to be
receptive to ideas and developing your craft so that you can act on them
when they appear.

Even in retirement, it's difficult to block out distractions. The decades of
writing on the job taught me how to regain my focus quickly. It's a very
handy skill.

Poetry is both work and play. I take my "work" seriously enough to resent
people calling it play. But when "inspiration" hits, writing feels almost
like play. But, like most mental activity, you get tired at some point in a
way similar to what work does. Writing a good poem is more intellectually
challenging than almost anything I ever had to do on my former job.

If I really wanted to "play," I wouldn't write. I'd find a coed softball
team or, in my current environment, try to become a whiz at golf or
shuffleboard. Or I'd just go to the pool, which is easiest.

Thanks for asking the question. How other writers manage to get their work
done despite all the daily obstacles has always interested me.

Vernon

Kirby has recently argued for the importance of a good work ethic.  I
might argue instead that the "work ethic" is something of a pathology in
this country, as well as a nice political instrument for keeping everyone
too busy to cause any trouble.  Nevertheless, I *am* interesting in how
people manage to get specifically poetic work done, and I don't think I've
ever seen a thread quite like that in all the time of been on the list.
I'm not talking about poetic methods, which have been discussed from time
to time, but about exactly how and when the work gets done.  Do you get up
early in the morning?  Stay up late at night?  Write during your lunch
hour?  "Steal" time while you're supposed to be doing other things at the
office?  Do you rely on bursts of inspiration, or set aside regular hours?
Are regular hours necessary in order to prepare for (eventual) bursts of
inspiration?

I'd be especially interested in hearing how people manage to find time for
poetic work in the face of other obligations like teaching or
other wage-earning work, child care responsibilities, and so on.  Do you
try to "block out" other "distractions," or do you try to integrate poetry
with other sorts of life activities?

Lastly, do you actually think of poetry as work, or is play a better term?
Or is the distinction an unnecessary one?

Alex, with all due respect, this path is by no means inevitable for anyone,
and to me (the older members of whose family have persevered and found ways
to retain both their political optimism and their convictions in the face
of a massive amount of cynicism and selfishness) what you're proposing

Well, first there's the act at itself.  And then there are the legal
arguments and the judge's comments.  All quite amazing.

--German court sentences cannibal to 8 1/2 years for killing, eating man
he met over Internet
By Frank Leth, Associated Press, 1/30/2004

KASSEL, Germany -- A German who confessed to killing, dismembering and
eating another man who allegedly agreed to the arrangement over the
Internet was convicted Friday of manslaughter and sentenced to 8.5 years
in prison.

Armin Meiwes, a 42-year-old computer expert, had no "base motives" in the
crime, a state court ruled, sparing him a murder conviction.

Prosecutors had sought a life sentence, calling Meiwes a "human butcher"
who acted simply to "satisfy a sexual impulse." They said they would
appeal the verdict.

The defense argued that since the victim volunteered to be killed and
eaten, the crime should be classified a mercy killing, which carries a
five-year maximum penalty.

Before the verdict, Meiwes looked calm, chatting with his attorney and
occasionally grinning for cameras allowed inside the courtroom. After the
sentence was read, he shook his lawyer's hand and nodded curtly to the
photographers.

Explaining the verdict, Presiding Judge Volker Muetze said Meiwes'
intention was not evil but "the fulfillment of his fantasy."

His primary motive was "the wish to make another man part of himself,"
Muetze said. "Meiwes reached this bonding experience through the
consumption of the flesh."

When his trial opened Dec. 3 in the central city of Kassel, Meiwes
confessed in detail to killing Bernd Juergen Brandes, 43, in March 2001 at
Meiwes' home in the town of Rotenburg.

Brandes traveled from Berlin in reply to an Internet advertisement seeking
a young man for "slaughter and consumption." Meiwes testified that Brandes
wanted to be stabbed to death after drinking a bottle of cold medicine to
lose consciousness.

"Bernd came to me of his own free will to end his life," Meiwes said in
his closing statement in court Monday. "For him, it was a nice death."

Still, he said he regretted the killing.

"I had my big kick and I don't need to do it again," he said. "I regret it
all very much, but I can't undo it."

A grisly video he made of the act was shown to the court during a closed
session.

A doctor testified that Brandes died from loss of blood and that the
medication, along with a half-bottle of liquor and 20 sleeping pills he
took beforehand, could not have lessened his pain.

Several experts have testified that Meiwes was fit to stand trial and was
not mentally ill.

Police tracked down and arrested him in December 2002 after a student in
Austria alerted them to a message Meiwes had posted on the Internet.

"If I hadn't been so stupid as to keep looking on the Internet, I would
have taken my secret to the grave," Meiwes said in his closing statement.

Thanks for the great post, Vernon!  Lots of interesting stuff here.  I
like to give my students that old quote (can't remember who said it) about
how "chance favors the prepared mind."  Sometimes I fudge it to "discovery
favors..." if I think they're going to be too uneasy with the idea of
chance.  All this is also reminding me of a Reznikoff poem about poetry
and
work that I'll have to look up when I get home.  There's also that story
about Zukofsky's father, Pinchos, meeting a friend of Louis's who had
"never worked a day in his life."  Now, Pinchos was your classic
hard-working Jewish immigrant, making a better life for his kids, etc. but
his reply was "You didn't miss a thing."  I can't remember if this is in
"A" or not.  My friend Ted Enslin, a nearly octegnarian
backwoods inveterate avoider of "steady employment," likes to quote it.

Georgia considers banning 'evolution'

Friday, January 30, 2004 Posted:  10:11 AM EST (1511 GMT)

ATLANTA, Georgia (AP) -- The state's school superintendent has proposed
striking the word evolution from Georgia's science curriculum and
replacing it with the phrase "biological changes over time."

The change is included in more than 800 pages of draft revisions to
Georgia's curriculum that have been posted by the Department of
Education on its Web site. The middle and high school standards are
expected to be voted on by the state Board of Education in May, after
public feedback.

Superintendent Kathy Cox said the concept of evolution would still be
taught under the proposal, but the word would not be used. The proposal
would not require schools to buy new textbooks omitting the word
evolution and would not prevent teachers from using it.

Cox repeatedly referred to evolution as a "buzzword" Thursday and said
the ban was proposed, in part, to alleviate pressure on teachers in
socially conservative areas where parents object to its teaching.

"If teachers across this state, parents across this state say, 'This is
not what we want,' then we'll change it," said Cox, a Republican
elected in 2002.

Educators and legislators criticized the proposal, saying science
teachers understand the theories behind evolution and how to teach them.

"Here we are, saying we have to improve standards and improve
education, and we're just throwing a bone to the conservatives with
total disregard to what scientists say," said state Rep. Bob Holmes, a
Democrat.

Social conservatives who prefer religious creation to be taught instead
of evolution criticized the proposal as well.

"If you're teaching the concept without the word, what's the point?"
said Rep. Bobby Franklin, a Republican. "It's stupid. It's like
teaching gravity without using the word gravity."

free to share it with your students if you think it's relevant.

"Chance" or "discovery" are equally appropriate. Training yourself to be a
receptor for ideas in the air or the mind is very important if you want to
generate ideas or trap elusive ones.

I don't know the Zukovsky quote, but I remember Ted Enslin from his reading
at the long-gone Ziesing Brothers Book Emporium in Willimantic, CT in late
1985 or early 1986. Aside from enjoying his work and his likable,
unpretentious manner, his reading taught me the value of hearing poets read
their work. Knowing the poet's voice--its rhythm, pace and expressiveness--
helps me interpret the poet's other poems when I read them in silence.

Best,

Vernon

Thanks for the great post, Vernon!  Lots of interesting stuff here.  I
like to give my students that old quote (can't remember who said it) about
how "chance favors the prepared mind."  Sometimes I fudge it to "discovery
favors..." if I think they're going to be too uneasy with the idea of
chance.  All this is also reminding me of a Reznikoff poem about poetry
and
work that I'll have to look up when I get home.  There's also that story
about Zukofsky's father, Pinchos, meeting a friend of Louis's who had
"never worked a day in his life."  Now, Pinchos was your classic
hard-working Jewish immigrant, making a better life for his kids, etc. but
his reply was "You didn't miss a thing."  I can't remember if this is in
"A" or not.  My friend Ted Enslin, a nearly octegnarian
backwoods inveterate avoider of "steady employment," likes to quote it.

On the one hand, you have religious fundamentalism, and on the other,
you've got social darwinism, which  is another kind of religious
fundamentalism in itself...I'll choose "none of the above."

Georgia considers banning 'evolution'
Friday, January 30, 2004 Posted: 10:11 AM EST (1511 GMT)
ATLANTA, Georgia (AP) -- The state's school superintendent has proposed
striking the word evolution from Georgia's science curriculum and replacing
it with the phrase "biological changes over time."
The change is included in more than 800 pages of draft revisions to
Georgia's curriculum that have been posted by the Department of Education
on its Web site. The middle and high school standards are expected to be
voted on by the state Board of Education in May, after public feedback.
Superintendent Kathy Cox said the concept of evolution would still be
taught under the proposal, but the word would not be used. The proposal
would not require schools to buy new textbooks omitting the word evolution
and would not prevent teachers from using it.
Cox repeatedly referred to evolution as a "buzzword" Thursday and said the
ban was proposed, in part, to alleviate pressure on teachers in socially
conservative areas where parents object to its teaching.
"If teachers across this state, parents across this state say, 'This is not
what we want,' then we'll change it," said Cox, a Republican elected in 2002.
Educators and legislators criticized the proposal, saying science teachers
understand the theories behind evolution and how to teach them.
"Here we are, saying we have to improve standards and improve education,
and we're just throwing a bone to the conservatives with total disregard to
what scientists say," said state Rep. Bob Holmes, a Democrat.
Social conservatives who prefer religious creation to be taught instead of
evolution criticized the proposal as well.
"If you're teaching the concept without the word, what's the point?" said
Rep. Bobby Franklin, a Republican. "It's stupid. It's like teaching gravity
without using the word gravity."

Vernon,

What was the activity that was more challenging than writing a good poem?

I have three children, and have always done a lot of work with them around.
Out of necessity my work has always been integrated with my environment; to
its benefit, ultimately.  I don't think an artist's work should be
hermetically sealed from the life around her, at any level.  I wrote my
first novel, a short one of about 100 pages, right after the birth of my
third child; I wrote when he was asleep and read what I wrote when I was
breastfeeding, and the rhythms of that were kind of like long breaths.  I
don't think it's surprising that that is a very formally structured novel.
I do know that I would never have been able to write it if I hadn't had a
computer.  When they were babies, I wrote poems in my head and wrote them
down later when I had a chance.

When the children were smaller it was a question of tuning my head like a
radio so I only attended to the noises which required attention: certain
scary cries meaning someone was hurt, demands for food, arguments or
suspicious silences.  I was very strict about bedtime.  Now they're older I
don't need to worry about the same things, but bedtime is right out.
Holidays are a bit stressful; we can end up with six teenagers in the house
all playing different music and sometimes I just long for quiet.  On the
other hand, I like having that energy around me.

Until just over a decade ago I worked as a journalist for daily newspapers,
both fulltime and part time.  Raising children is much harder than anything
I have done in the workforce (or anywhere else).  Paradoxically, maybe, the
other work interfered much more grievously with my own work.  Children have
never been a bother in that way.

I work hard, but I don't buy this work ethic business.  It seems to me a
peculiarly American ideology and very repressive.  Working hard at something
I love doing is one of my definitions of happiness.  Working as a wage slave
at something I don't especially enjoy is a good way for me to be miserable.
Being miserable is no good for me or my family. So I spend a fair bit of
ingenuity structuring my life to enable me to do what I want.

Best

I always like the minimalist aesthetic of rhythmic repetition with its
variations on levels and shades of timbre. It's made me look for repetitions
in environments in a particular way. For example - at risk of a political
indulgence that's not identified with classical minimalism - I am taken by
the  repetition of the word "Intelligence", particularly in the way it
begins to shade the way we look at the Bush Administration; the way
"intelligence" begins to mount in intensity, hovering and repeated itself in
and around the edges of the White House; Steve Reich and/or his Ghanaian
talking drum teachers as an analog for the wavering modulations, accretions
and resonances in which the word  "Intelligence" increasingly becomes a
question, an object of inquiry in and of itself.

Ironically, and in terms of the space/time continuum, "Intelligence" was a
question from the start, an assumption, at least on the part of the Left,
that George Bush did not have the "Intelligence" required for the job. The
question there at the start, and it will be there at the finish, albeit on a
macro level, one that radiates and resonates through out this
Administration, an inability to respond to the material of "Intelligence"
either in word or in substance. A defining word/question at the start and
one that is maximized as the four year term "arises" to its conclusion, his
"intelligence" (or lack of it) now irrevocably joined to Central
Intelligence (or - clearly - the lack of it).

Ah, "minimalism" in the public works. Mind your righteous drums!

Great post. I was just talking about this with a
friend of mine who recently returned from nearly
two years of avoiding a real job, and just writing
all that time, and now is struggling to find time
to write. I have two part-time jobs and work six
days a week. However one of those jobs is very
flexible, the other is an afternoon gig, so I
generally have the mornings free to write. On the
other hand, this time had been getting more and
more frustrating as I woke up later and later each
day and felt rushed, especially knowing that
ultimately, six days out of seven, I do have to
work.

Having read somewhere that Valery wrote every day
from 5-8am, and seen (in the biopic Sylvia) that
Plath wrote all of Ariel on mornings between
4-8am, I was reminded of the benefits of waking up
very early (or staying up very late) to write. The
solitude and silence simply cannot be found at any
other time of day or night, especially if one
lives in the city, as I do. Also, there is that
quasi-grogginess one achieves at these times, that
feeling of still having one foot in dreamland and
the other awake, so to speak, that certainly
facilitates a "poetic" mindframe much better than
later in the morning or afternoon, when one's wide
awake and already doing other things.

I also carry around a small notebook at all times,
although I was much more active with it when I
didn't have a regular job. My gig as an arts
administrator requires a lot of attention and is
not very "inspirational," as I'm completely alone
all the time, but my second gig as a page at the
public library is sometimes rife with material, as
I'm around lots of people and sort of wandering
amidst piles of books. Yet I hate that job. Go
figure.

I do think that writing requires every-day
discipline in the same way that playing an
instrument does, and it's not always fun,
sometimes it's just work. But nothing else makes
me feel as good and ordered and free as having
done it, so that's the reward. Maybe after you've
got your chops down it's not as important, but
that can be a lifelong process, and really, once
you've got the habit of writing every day, why
stop?

Kirby has recently argued for the importance of a
good work ethic.  I
might argue instead that the "work ethic" is
something of a pathology in
this country, as well as a nice political
instrument for keeping everyone
too busy to cause any trouble.  Nevertheless, I
*am* interesting in how
people manage to get specifically poetic work
done, and I don't think I've
ever seen a thread quite like that in all the time
of been on the list.
I'm not talking about poetic methods, which have
been discussed from time
to time, but about exactly how and when the work
gets done.  Do you get up
early in the morning?  Stay up late at night?
Write during your lunch
hour?  "Steal" time while you're supposed to be
doing other things at the
office?  Do you rely on bursts of inspiration, or
set aside regular hours?
Are regular hours necessary in order to prepare
for (eventual) bursts of
inspiration?

I'd be especially interested in hearing how people
manage to find time for
poetic work in the face of other obligations like
teaching or
other wage-earning work, child care
responsibilities, and so on.  Do you
try to "block out" other "distractions," or do you
try to integrate poetry
with other sorts of life activities?

Lastly, do you actually think of poetry as work,
or is play a better term?
Or is the distinction an unnecessary one?

Stephan,
     Did you ever remember the source of this?

"Did you know that Charles Bernstein is becoming
interested in prosody, and will apparently publish
something on the subject?  So I read in a recent
interview with him, but I can't remember the magazine
(I was browsing through some magazines at a Grand
Central Station newspaper/magazine shop?)

I'm beginning to wish I knew about meter."

Here's the Reznikoff poem I mentioned in an earlier post:

After I had worked all day at what I earn my living,
I was tired.  Now my own work has lost another day,
I thought, but began slowly,
and slowly my strength came back to me.
Surely, the tide comes in twice a day.

--

That's encouraging.  As for the Zuk, it looks like the story I gave was a
little scrambled.  Looking in "A" I see that the anecdote did not involve
LZ's father.   Stephen Baraban wrote me a backchannel that got closer to
the truth, as follows:
"I seem to remember a story that John F. Kennedy was
campaigning for president before a feisty blue collar
audience, and somebody said to him "you've never
worked a day in you life, have you?" JFK said "no, I
haven't." The reply: "you haven't missed anything".
Pinchos Z. said it too?--good for him!"

But the lines in "A" refer to "an Irish Boston factory worker" speaking up
during "Ted's campaign," so I guess the reference is not to JFK but to
*Ted Kennedy, who was elected to the Senate for the first time in 1962
("A"-14, where the lines are found, was written in 1964).  As an
interesting side note, for those who are playing along at home, the word
"work" appears in the index to "A" with 56 references!

*Please note that Ted Enslin (mentioned in my previous mangled post) was
never elected to the Senate, but neither did Ted Kennedy ever, to my
knowledge, grow blueberries in Maine.

I've had to change my procmail/spamassassin filtering from saving spam in
a file to send it to /dev/null (the metaphysics of this amazes me) - the
auto-delete bin as far as I'm concerned. So if you send me something and
don't hear back, please send back with a different heading - or at least
inform me that you haven't received a response.

I've had to do this because my spam had reached about 5 megabytes a day.

I've always thought the work goes on all the time, whether one's
got pen in hand (so to speak) or not. As a result, perhaps, I've
never really worried about "not writing." Some days I do, some
days I don't. And sometimes the days I don't extend to weeks
or months. And the work goes on all the same.

I think of "it" (whatever "it" means) as "serious play," btw.

i'm not one of those writers who write at a certain time in a certain place
on a daily basis, like my friend Aaron Kiely who writes in the same cafe
everyday each evening for two hours.

the same way he and others impose that daily behavior, i structure myself by
creating various projects. This past January I wrote a postcard a day to the
poet Sean Cole. I wrote a bunch of Avril Lavigne acrostics with my niece
Michelle in June. This past October, Sean and I wrote each other a postcard
a day. In November, I wrote a poem each night on a blog. And come tomorrow,
poet Gina Myers and I will be exchanging daily emailed letters for the month
of February.

I usually do the project writing just before bed, anywhere from midnight to
5 in the morning, turning my tv to the jazz music choice channel (one of
those music channels where yr tv becomes a radio, basically, but with
factoids about the artist playing shown on the screen, alongside ads telling
you how to buy their cd). I like writing just before bed best because my
defenses, however much they're almost not in play at all other times, are
even less in play then due to exhaustion.

I also always have a memo pad in my pocket, so when the poems come at other
times i can write them down.

As for thinking poetry as work or play, neither term seems fully accurate to
me. Play almost seems derisive, like calling something deeply cared about a
hobby, and work something you do to pay the rent. To me the distinction is,
as steven shoemaker asked, an unnecessary one.

best,
david

Murat,



Now that I think a little more about it, nothing on my day job was more
challenging than writing a poem---except possibly for the two novels I wrote
on the job. Their challenge was the staying power required to complete a
long work.



I did obtain several $35,000,000 Section 8 grants from HUD, seed grants for
new social service agencies, resolve inter-agency feuds that could have had
political repercussions, work in neighborhoods the morning after a drive-by
shooting had occurred, make paper trails for questionable deals between
agency commissioners and legislators---but none of these involved me as
intellectually as writing. They just distracted me from the challenge for a
time, while paying for my food, rent and (now) my pension.

I believe in the joy or working at something you love. You've obviously
wanted to write and have been resourceful enough to find a way to do it. I
respect your desire; after decades of writing, I know the difference between
those who want to write and those who want to write so badly they do it
despite whatever obstacles confront them.



David



Sometimes I find writing a poem while half-awake (at either end of the day)
makes me receptive to ideas that might not surface if I were well-rested.
Use anything that works.



Halvard



I never really stop, either. The cogs are always turning. But then, my mind
has always been that way. Does anybody have a spare off switch?



David Kischenbaum



I work according to projects, myself. The thing is, I have so many writing
projects going on I have to keep at it almost every day, although I'm in a
slight lull right now. I don't listen to music when I write because I get
into a trancelike state and can't hear the music. I bristle when somebody
calls what I do a hobby. Hobbies are stamp collecting, coed softball, things
you enjoy doing but have no serious desire to become proficient at doing.
Writing to me is a serious form of play, as someone posted. And it's more
rewarding than any gainful employment I've had, except for the pay. It's
also work that brings me joy and spiritual satisfaction. It's not so much
either play or work as both and more.



Now I've used my two posts for the day. Time to shut up and listen.



Vernon

I need title and publication date of a Harry Crosby
poem that consists of repetitions of the word,
"black," surrounding the word, "sun," in a rectangle.

I also need the title and publication date of a poem
by Kenneth Rexroth that consists entirely of words
made up of w (e.g., "wwwwwwww")--or maybe it's a poem
with a stanza of such words. . . .

I need it for an entry I did for Burt Kimmelman's
Companion to Contemporary Literature.  Much gratitude
to anyone who can help me out.

I have tried to write at work, but always seem to get interrupted and lose
my flow of ideas.  Unfortunately, I have been going through extreme writer's
block at the moment which makes my day job seems even more tedious and
uneventful.  This coupled with deciding on returning to school and how it
will affect me financially is making me go slightly mad, but, unfortunately,
not fueling any ideas.  I appreciate seeing how everyone else seems to fit
writing time in with their daily routine.  Perhaps after I set up my writing
room (I'm also moving), the block with be lifted.  Thanks for the
encouragement.

I have a seven year old, and up until recently, my grown son was here, too.
It was maddening.  MY daughter didn't have after-school care, either, last
semester, so I found I was staying up, losing sleep...This semester, though,
my son has moved out, my daughter has after-school care, so I'll be able to
get those papers graded--and write more.  I have so many projects that my
projects have projects...

I've spent most of winter break writing...I have about 30 pieces out,
awaiting, news.

The title of the Harry Crosby poem is "Photoheliograph"
(from _Chariot of the Sun_, 1929).

Hi Steven - it is a poetic novel about memory and fiction called
"Navigatio".  Out of print, unfortunately, but I have some copies hanging
around if anyone is interested.

I'm always fascinated by how artists work.  I like that thing of having
several projects bubbling at once; I saw a doco on Miro once, and how he
would go to his studio every day and look around meditatively at various
half finished paintings.  Eventually he would choose one, according to how
he felt, and work on that one.

I don't usually worry when I'm not writing; I take it as a good sign.  I
assume that something is going on underneath, where I can't trace it. Though
some people (Alan Sondheim seems to be one of those people) seem to just
have this constant flow-through of stimulus to art, a constant circulation.
I don't get why sometimes writing is just so easy that it's like taking
dictation and at other times it is like pulling teeth.

Best

I don't know what people mean when they talk about conviction (towards
habitual practice) to write poetry -- is there conviction to speak?
Wasn't it Bukowski who said writing poetry is like taking a good shit?
What conviction? Writing poetry is action (utility) -- not
reward/therapy.

I believe poetry should be purely occasional. (Just like language.) So I
don't believe in writing poetry for poetry's sake -- I write -- because
I have something to say. Is that like being 'commissioned' (ie.
historically)?


I was always under the impression that poetry was something that you did
("it is finished.") like 'It was snowing / And it was *going* to snow';
a moving.  thing

I mean, u r what u r, right? Even if you are locked in a jail cell with
no way to write you know yourself --

[

And my idea was that, (not that I have a savoir-complex or anything,
rather for a good comparison), if you visited Jerusalem and walked away
you were guaranteed not to be the Davidic Messiah. If The DM was in the
Holy City he wasn't going to be 'passing thru unnoticed' or 'on
vacation', etc. He would be coming back for a reason (with fire), and it
would be the very next time you see him (ie. a *Second* Coming). So if
you get in-and-out of Jerusalem ok, and nothing spectacular happens,
then you're no DM. In the same way -- if you were locked in a jail cell
with no way to get to Jerusalem, drugged, chained-to-the-floor, etc. you
r what u r 'so that'

]

and that's the power ('haile') which makes you do it. so I don't think
there should be any 'checklist-behavior' -- any time-set-aside, vows,
etc... If you need to seek the sign of truth *after* the acquisition of
ideas then you are afraid to admit you exist (ie. Galatians; Spinoza).
Never send to know for whom the bell tolls!


In any case, a good shit is probably the best metaphor ('just do it');
the bathroom is the most useful spot in a house (action).

Is this the same Harry Crosby who is a photographer?  If so, he's my cousin.

Vernon,

This is a very impressive list. Still, I agree with you. Writing a good poem
is harder.

I have an essay, "Is Writing a Job, Is a Poem a Product," which can be
googled in the web if you write in my full name (Murat Nemet-Nejat). It relates to
the question you are addressing in your response to David Kischenbaum.
