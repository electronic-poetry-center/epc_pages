Yes,
a couple of times I have typed "the bombing" without thinking because there
have been so many bombings resulting in death and injury

and then I have changed it to "the attack"

I wrote "les evenements" to someone today

I wouldn't underestimate the degree to which you do have to find a way to
encompass the experience, but the problem is mechanical as well

it's a military innovation, or the results of it, you suffered; and the
vocabulary hasn't caught up

"suicide hijacking and targetted crashing" is too complex

Subject: Israel


| The only thing everybody seems to agree on is that, whatever cause it has
| been in leading to the attacks of September 11, the United States' policy
| in relation to Israel needs to be changed.  It is hard, however, to
| understand what, in justice, this means.

No, it's very easy...

for the rest of what you say, I got an uneasy sense of deja vu.I'm sure I
have read all that before. Many times. Many many times

| and what Arafat rejected
| by launching his second intifada, without so much as a negotiation for a
| better deal.

Well, that's the word from Israel. Me, I say maybe. I'd also say that the
Palestinians could do a lot better than Arafat and what he may or may not do
does not alter the injustice of their situation. I mean I don't judge
USAmericans by their Presidents and they get some kind of choice while
there's no real choice for the Palestinians; and I'd be totally pissed off
if you judged me on the basis of Tony Blair

  We need to be reminded that a Palestinian state alongside of
| Israel was what all the Arab nations rejected in '48,

& we need to be reminded that the Israeli state had no business being there;
it was a cuckoo

But Israel is very strong, courtesy in part of USA and to a lesser extent UK

As a result, many but not all, I agree, have conceded the existence of
Israel, but that's a response to its power not its legitimacy... in addition
there now could be no justice if those who have been born since the
establishment of the state of israel were just uprooted

BUT bringing up the resistance post 1948 is not relevant. of course the
arabs resisted. What would you expect them to do? Now there is a desire for
a settlement on the basis of the internationally-agreed borders. It doesn't
look as though Israel wants to settle... I'd raise the internationally
agreed borders and that 200000 squatters the wrong side of it

| they controlled all of the West Bank and Gaza, where they preferred
keeping
| the Palestinians in miserable refugee camps to a genuine Palestinian
| homeland,

excuse me? They had a genuine homeland. It was full of people who had
immigrated from all over the world in defiance of the decision of those who
ruled Palestine until 1948 and later on the basis of race

The American and Australian first peoples have been blamed for their own
misery which had been visited upon them by invading foreigners

resulting in another war when Israel rejected Nasser's call to
| "push them to the sea"; and it is what Arafat continues to reject, both
| overtly and by refusing to reign in the absolutely rejectionist Hizbollah

rein in... I doubt he can; but that has nothing to do with the wrongness of
the theft of Palestinian land. Nor is it fair to keep quoting only the most
extreme statements. A few weeks ago we had a report here with the most awful
frightening things being shouted by Israelis about Arabs - but one doesn't
assume that represents all their views all the time

What Nasser shouted at time of war needs to be read in that context.

| and Hamas, who, also overtly, say they want no Jews living anywhere from
| the Jordan to the Mediterranean.

which is not justifiable; but one can see how they came to that state of
mind

| It's convenient to blame Israel for the state of Arab and Palestinian
| suffering in the Middle East and to romanticize Arafat as a freedom
| fighter.

those are two quite separate things and it confuses the issue to mix them up

  But even in relation to their own people, Arafat and the
| Palestinian Authority have behaved like a bunch of thugs an crooks,
| squirreling away into Swiss bank accounts the millions upon millions of
| dollars that have poured into them from the United States, as a result of
| the Oslo accords, and from the Arab oil nations, instead of using them to
| create a Palestinian economy, and preventing almost any freedom of dissent
| with repression and murder.

I get that deja vu again. You haven't mentioned Sabra and Shatila... and
Southern Lebanon... using "the millions upon millions of dollars that have
poured into [Israel] from the United States"

| Let the PA's  praise as martyrs of suicide blowing up of restaurants and
| discotechs stop; let the PA's state media stop demonizing Israelis as they
| do in the most conventional anti-Jewish fashion (pictures of Jews with
long
| noses and all);

*state media? yes, I think they should declare a state; and a capital

 let Arafat start telling his people, in Arabic, that they
| must accept an independent Israel as a now and forever fact, whether they
| like it or not;

"Every place that the sole of your foot shall tread upon, that have I given
unto you, as I said unto Moses.
4  From the wilderness and this Lebanon even unto the great river, the river
Euphrates, all the land of the Hittites, and unto the great sea toward the
going down of the sun, shall be your coast.
5  There shall not any man be able to stand before thee all the days of thy
life "

One of the most attractive things about US culture is the racial melting pot
and I am confused by USAmericans who will both see that as positive in their
own country and yet resist the concept in Palestine with such
self-destructive passion

Well, when I first saw that Charles had posted news of my birthday, I
was mortified!  I thought, oh God, now they will all know what an old
lady I am.  However, everyone's wishes have been so heartwarming that
I'm grateful to Charles.  Thanks to everybody who wrote!  I don't really
feel that different but, as Joe (my husband) says, "Getting old means
having to sit down to put on your underwear...."  Something like that
....

Love,
Marjorie

Laura, I think here, in the midst of quick typing, you conflated STIGMA,
some sense of which I take you to mean, with ASTIGMATISM, which is a vision
disorder.  Or did you INTEND this very interesting juxtaposition?  (Also,
very much liked your "Poetry as reframing would be looking, for instance, at
the side of an object heretofore believed to have only a front and a back"--
which is itself a highly poetic insight).

My own responses to the flag are also deeply ingrained, mostly from
prepubescent associations.  I was a child in the 60s, & remember stray parts
of history through the eyes of a child: King's assassination, the growing
distrust of LBJ in the wake of the war's escalation, the bombing of
Cambodia, Nixon's duplicitousness, the Detroit riots (my grandmother was in
a hospital downtown at that precise moment, but fortunately neither she nor
the hospital were harmed), etc.  I remember "America Love It or Leave It," &
the peace symbol as a (non-political?) accessory some kids wore.  The flag,
for me, will always connote that time in history & the strangely mixed
feelings everyone around me increasingly had.  As a symbol, for me, it is
equivalent to militarism.  I realize this reaction is bound to historical
circumstance-- & that not all people, even of my generation, will share my
reaction, or for that matter my politics.  I respect the idea of the flag as
a "transitional object" (in the loose way we have been using this term) for
others, at least in the context of a crisis like this one-- but I (like you,
Laura) can hardly identify with that response.

Mark

hence it shows that the Language movement had/ has  a great "point" that
when and as language breaks down it is an indicator that he state is
breaking down, the the people "in that system" (probably everyone on the
Earth) are breaking down, or transforming: someone clevere thatn I on these
issues suchas Nick Piombino or my friend Scott may be able to elucidate
further what I think I'm saying..I find it hard, in converstio, to refer to
it "the incidents/s" with appropriate (if there is any apropriate
language)...I think this is the beginning of the end of capitalism ,,and  so
on. Richard.

I am having the same question.  Heard a very cogent
statement by the head of Reuters Global news service
on NPR (he sounded British) who talked about why they
are not using the term "terrorist" -- that it implies
a value judgement and doesn't even feel entirely
accurate.  They use "hijackers."  I myself don't feel
comfortable with the phrase "terror attacks" and I
don't even know why.  I keep calling it "September 11"
or "the thing of September 11."  Sometimes I say "the
attacks on NY" but even attacks sounds wrong and then
I am forgetting Washington and PA.

Subject:      Paterson, NJ as "hub for hijackers"
Mime-version: 1.0

Content-Transfer-Encoding:  7bit

William Carlos Williams' Paterson continues its unforeseeable unfoldings,
the city showing up in the news as a part of the terror of today.  The epic
poem that the poet was never able to complete (first four books, then five,
then six), the  story of that city--the telling of it--that haunted him
desperately until his death, abruptly adds a new feature upon itself as what
the headline in the New York Times describes as the "hub for hijackers,"
those that took down the World Trade Center and smashed into the Pentagon.

"We have 72 identifiable nationalities here, 170,000 people in eight square
miles," said Bob Grant, the mayor's spokesman.  "With a lot of different
folks moving in and out of the city, unless you raise a ruckus, you could
live here for a while without anyone noticing."

The photograph accompanying the article in the newspaper shows a three-story
brick building at 486 Union Avenue, a building that must have been around
when Williams was walking about the city, accumulating impressions and
insights for his never-ending poem--the corner market on the ground floor,
the hijackers' apartments above, and in faded, large-scale lettering beside
the windows, now barely discernible on the wall, a hand-painted
advertisement written upon the bricks for a biscuit mix at 75 cents.

What would Williams make of his city today, the city that was chosen by the
terrorists as a "headquarters," a "staging ground"; the city that was chosen
by the poet because it might, he believed, finally be "something knowable."
Though near the end of his life, dying, he finally concluded "there can be
no end to such a story."

So much of Williams' poem depended upon the archives of the city's library
as he culled through old newspapers, extracting artifacts of time's
insistent dissolve.  Today's papers now join that expanding site, further
evidence of that unknowable city, that story with no end.

"Rigor of beauty is the quest.  But how will you find beauty when it is
locked in the mind past all remonstrance?"

i've noticed this as well

recently i was in a store and they were talking
about "it" and "it" was on the radio

"We aren't talking about 'it' are we?" i asked -
exhausted with the media coverage and the
constant discussions and the inability of people
to think outside 2 or 3 responses - myself
include

there you are - i've called it "it"

i'm afraid to use language anymore - it is so
easily appropriated by the politicians, the media
and business interests - no doubt poems have been
written already... an anthology might even come
out of this

there are times i am almost sickened to be a poet
- good bad or indifferent - simply because all i
can think to do to respond is "write a poem" - i
wish i could say it was therapy, but sometimes i
think it is nothing more than shallow
manipulation and egoising

"as though our language has yet to find a word or phrase that can encompass
our experience."

Ron,
I've been thinking about much the same thing.  (I was prompted to do so by a
post sent by Kristin Prevallet to the Online Poetry Classroom.)  Quickly
scanning through recent posts to this list and links provided by listers,
I've found these phrases: "the attacks of Sept. 11," "recent . . . events,"
"this months dramatic events," "the September 11 violence,"  "September 11
attacks."  Each phrase makes reference to time (usually the exact date).  It
seems that when speaking of the "attacks" "events" "violence" time is the
only certainty, the only thing we *know*.  It also provides a marker: before
9/11 and after.  Most social and political changes take place over time,
gradually.  The current change in our culture is born of one day, one set of
events.  When one can mark the date--for USAmericans November 22, December
7, etc.--that date seems an immutable fact, constant despite the sudden
change.  In the midst of change and as a bulwark (I note my war-diction)
against forgetting, the date becomes a trigger for memory, and so one marks
the passing of time after that date with one-week, one-month, annual
memorials, etc.  (I find myself thinking of time this way.  How many days
since September eleventh?  And each time the emotions engulf me, whether I'm
in the middle of class, eating, driving, typing...)
When speaking with my high school students, I have found myself searching
for words to describe the terrorist act [see: the on-going act of war v.
criminal act debate], but have spoken with confidence and certainty about
time.  As this idea has just come to me, I'd very much like others to chime
in with more coherent insights into the relationship between dating and
naming.
all the best,
j.c.

This is what my students happened to be scheduled to read this week -- from
Brigid Murnaghan's homage to the George Washington Bridge -- written many
years before 2001:

The fog in Washington Square Park is London fog
Where have you gone, Empire State Building?
Have they stolen you?
Where have you gone, Twin Towers?
Who'd steal you?
Why have they left me alone?
Why have you isolated me?
When will the wind come and blow the fog away
So I can see my lifelines once again.

Subject: posting to Poetics list

 Hey, would you post this to the Poetics list? I have to make a class
proposal for winter term this week.

I am going to teach a writing class called "The Thing in the Text," and I'm
looking for suggestions for what to put on the syllabus. The idea for the
class came from an essay by Wayne Koestenbaum, called "Darling's Prick
Passages." Koestenbaum writes about the end of Genet's _Our Lady of the
Flowers_ (where Genet writes about a prisoner who put his penis on a paper
and traced its outline, and sent the letter to his girlfriend): this is
Koestenbaum: "I don't want to write 'about' the prick, I want to write the
prick."

So I want to take up things and thingliness in writing (not necessarily
pricks). I am not interested in beating unsuspecting students about the head
with the "truth" that referentiality is impossible. Which is true enough but
a bit boring. I'm more interested in just looking at how some texts grapple
with things. The texts I have in mind are Zola's _The Ladies' Paradise_, Ben
Marcus' _Age of Wire and String_, maybe some Beckett, a story from Brian
Evenson's _Contagion_. I would like to include some poems on the syllabus. I
'd appreciate any suggestions.

Bill Witherup asked me to forward this poem:


NUMBED BY TALK OF WAR

Numbed by talk of war
I take my dog for his morning walk;
Notice the fallen cones
Of the fir tree onto the parking lot,
Yellow-green shell-bursts of pollen
Against the black void.

You flag wavers
Roll up the Stars and Stripes;
Furl your rabid hatred.
Look up at, or imagine,
The constellations.

All life forms
Come from star-splash:
Muslim, Anglo, Jew, dove, and hawk
From supernovas,
Cosmic pollen-bursts.
Embrace an oak or pine,
Or any nearby tree,
And let the bark leach out toxins

Maybe it's beating a dead horse, but I have to agree with Marcella, Murat,
Mark, Patrick & others about the threatening post. Chris, I can understand
your reading of it, but I think you're being a bit generous. It was badly
timed and completely inexcusable. Not only did those of us in NYC personally
witness thousands of deaths at once--something that will probably haunt us
until our own deaths--but many of us have been subjected to numerous bomb
threats following it: I've personally had to leave work once after a bomb
threat, and get off the subway twice as frantic MTA workers rushed through
cars to find a "suspicious package" either reported by another passenger, or
called in by someone threatening to bomb or gas a car. I’m obviously "fine"
physically; but am finding it difficult right now to get on the subway, as
I’m sure many others are. (I know at least two people who refuse to ride
them.)

In that light, I found your responses, Chris, to Murat, who lives in I think
New Jersey, or in any case in the NYC area & as such someone who no doubt
has to get on the subway or PATH train (both of which are in danger btw of
being suddenly flooded) despite the now more than 200 reported bomb threats
specific to the subway system here, to be callous. Especially your second
comment about "just walk away from it." Walking away from threats isn’t a
luxury we have right now here. (Running away from them might be more
accurate, but still ...)

Let’s be real: the threatening post came as a threat, totally out of the
blue, in no context whatsoever, and while most of us probably assumed it was
some lame white grad student prank (my first thought), there was still that
moment of terror, which, you know, I personally need like a nail through my
left ass cheek. We haven’t had enough threats for the last couple of weeks?
Because, basically, that’s what you’re promoting when you forward something
like that out to everyone, at least to those of us in NYC--though, I just
talked with Sofie Qureshi (a muslim) a couple of days ago; she lives in San
Francisco, and she’s looking to buy a gas mask, as are many of her friends.
They’re terrified. Whether or not they have cause to be. (I read her the
threatening post, by the way: she was nearly speechless. "It just makes me
sad," she said.) So, undoubtedly, New Yorkers are hardly the only people
freaked out. Or non-muslims. U.S. Muslims and arabs, by the way--something
the threatening post failed to address in any way whatsoever--have two
fronts of terror at this point: racial/ethnic profiling & idiotic uninformed
retaliation (hardly unaddressed on this list, btw, prior to said post--I
think Wanda Phipps even sent one about what people in Brooklyn can do to
actively help muslims in Brooklyn) *and* another bombing, germ warfare,
nerve gas, etc., from religious or whatever whackos. The two Palesitinians &
Syrian in the bodega up the street from us have U.S. flags in their window
right now--*obviously* because they fear retaliation (is that a case of flag
as a kind of "transitional object" or what?) ... though they’re also freaked
out about anthrax ... something they don’t have a flag or whatever to hang
in their window in the vague hope of staving off.

Sorry to be such a windbag about this. I have the poetics list to thank for
numerous personal contacts & friendships, for information about countless
readings, magazines & book publications I might otherwise have missed, for
putting me in contact with (again) countless readers & writers. Not to
mention the fact that I "met" the absolute love of my life here. Still, this
whole business about the threatening post (I refuse to name the poster,
believing it’s a pseudonym), about what strikes me as an obvious lapse in
judgment, empathy, and simple human decency, has left such a bad taste in my
mouth, I’m ready to unsubscribe. It’s not worth it. Plenty of others have
been bumped from this list for mere literary political reasons, for
"disruption of discussion" reasons (as though things *ever* ran smoothly on
this list). So, someone forges an account & gets on and threatens *most* of
us? Who are in no uncertain terms in solidarity w/anti-arab backlash? I
really don’t get it, Chris. What "lesson" is being doled out here? Isn't it
enough we're getting infantalized from the mainstream *press* every day? We
need that from the poetics list, too?

As poets, as people, we tolerate too much bullshit & horror every fricken
day to have to have it dumped in our laps on this list. Basically, my
feeling is, the person who posted the threat ought to own up to it, tell us
who s/he is, and make *some* attempt at dialog. My guess is, s/he is
incapable of actual dialog. Excuse me. "He" I should say, as I don’t for a
second believe the poster was a woman.

I’d like to be proven wrong. That, unfortunately, would require honesty.

Like, "good luck," or whatever,

Gary

FYI, I have set up a page with links to info on the terrorist attacks
of Sept 11 and their aftermath, preparations for war, etc.  Please
feel free to visit and add links that I am missing.  It's set up with
a Yahoo-style directory, including subcategories, as well as a search

Internet Philosophy and Psychology -                             Sept 001


Since the WTC tragedy, my work has been dealing with the creation and
destruction of language, of the broken teeth of words. It has also dealt
with the possibility of distance against its very impossibility, and with
exile, the corruption of culture, the corrosion of news and media.

In Miami, I am an inaccessible digit, furiously telephoning; what is writ-
ten travels through the mutilation and veering of thought. I am ashamed
over my own depression, aware that terror decathects meaning - that mean-
ing is a luxury. I try to write through this.

Below is the usual intro:

This is a somewhat periodic notice describing my Internet Text, available
on the Net, and sent in the form of texts to various lists. The URL is:
http://www.anu.edu.au/english/internet_txt/ which is partially mirrored at
http://lists.village.virginia.edu/~spoons/internet_txt.html. (The first
site includes some graphics, dhtml, The Case of the Real, etc.)

The changing nature of the email lists, Cybermind and Wryting, to which
the texts are sent individually, hides the full body of the work; readers
may not be aware of the continuity among them. The writing may appear
fragmented, created piecemeal, splintered from a non-existent whole. On my
end, the whole is evident, the texts extended into the lists, partial or
transitional objects.

So this (periodic) notice is an attempt to recuperate the work as total-
ity, restrain its diaphanous existence. Below is an updated introduction.

-----

The "Internet Text" currently constitutes around 100 files, or 4500 print-
ed pages. It began in 1994, and has continued as an extended meditation on
cyberspace, expanding into 'wild theory' and literatures.

Almost all of the text is in the form of short- or long-waves. The former
are the individual sections, written in a variety of styles, at times
referencing other writers/theorists. The sections are interrelated; on
occasion emanations are used, avatars of philosophical or psychological
import. These also create and problematize narrative substructures within
the work as a whole. Such are Susan Graham, Julu, Alan, Jennifer, and
Nikuko, in particular.

The long-waves are fuzzy thematics bearing on such issues as death, sex,
virtual embodiment, the "granularity of the real," physical reality, com-
puter languages, and protocols. The waves weave throughout the text; the
resulting splits and convergences owe something to phenomenology, program-
ming, deconstruction, linguistics, philosophy and prehistory, as well as
the domains of online worlds in relation to everyday realities.

Overall, I'm concerned with virtual-real subjectivity and its manifesta-
tions. I continue working on a cdrom of the last eight years of my work
(Archive); I also additional video materials, created with Azure Carter
and Foofwa d'Imobilite, on two cdroms, Baal and Parables. I've worked on a
series of codeworks and political pieces, as well as Asteroids, a group of
videos based on 3d modeling of spatial objects and fly-byes. Finally, I've
recently completed two cdrom collections of materials, Miami and Voyage.

I have used MUDS, MOOS, talkers, perl, d/html, qbasic, linux, emacs, vi,
CuSeeMe, etc., my work tending towards embodied writing, texts which act
and engage beyond traditional reading practices. Some of these emerge out
of performative language - soft-tech such as computer programs which _do_
things; some emerge out of interferences with these programs, or conversa-
tions using internet applications that are activated one way or another.
And some of the work stems from collaboration, particularly video, sound,
and flash pieces.

There is no binarism in the texts, no series of definitive statements.
Virtuality is considered beyond the text- and web-scapes prevalent now.
The various issues of embodiment that will arrive with full-real VR are
already in embryonic existence, permitting the theorizing of present and
future sites, "spaces," nodes, and modalities of body/speech/community.

It may be difficult to enter the texts for the first time. The Case of the
Real is a sustained work and possible introduction. It is also helpful to
read the first file, Net1.txt, and/or to look at the latest files (lq, lr)
as well. Skip around. The Index works only for the earlier files; you can
look up topics and then do a search on the file listed.

The texts may be distributed in any medium; please credit me. I would ap-
preciate in return any comments you may have.

Current cdroms are available for $14; if you've have an earlier version,
they go for $10. (Video format is .mov with Sorenson compression or .avi
or .avi-jpg). (Costs include shipping.)

You can find my collaborative projects at
http://trace.ntu.ac.uk/writers/sondheim/index.htm and my conference
activities at http://trace.ntu.ac.uk - both as a result of my virtual
writer-in-residence with the Trace online writing community.

Because you live in a priviliged capitalist nation you cannpot see that in
fact many see the attack as a legitimate strike back against US State
terrorism of Palestine, Iraq (which has been bombed with greater loss of
lives than the trade towers), Colombia, Pakistan, India, China, Vietnam, the
Sudan, the working people of the world, and so on: it is the "blunt edge "
if you like of the Class Struugle which contimues in whatever form......he's
not the only one who would want to attack Americans: there will be millions
especailly if the US continues its aggression. Richard.

Yes.  If I have to refer to "the events", I rely most
often on "after what happened", a phrase that has
ceased to function well as time has passed and so have
other less international but still personally defining
'what happened's; more importantly though, I've never
been certain to what I am referring with "what
happened".  It seems many 'what happened's had been
happening, just not personally negatively impacting
most Am-err "I can!"s.

To rely on the date Sept 11, 2001, or even descriptive
reference such as "after the two planes flew into the
World Trade Center, and one flew into the us pentagon,
and one 'crashed' in Pennsylvania and around 6,000
people died", defines everything through those events
and deaths, and implies only our shock and fear,
rather than the complex political situation from which
'this' (what happened) arose. It is as if there was no
problem until 'this' happened.  Is our shock and
confusion a self-centered and one directional way of
imagining our place in the world that contributed to
why 'this' happened?

A fear of participating in erasure, a desire to
include all of "what happened" in my reference, makes
for silence.  Because I do not have any sort of
exhaustive knowledge of the political situation, I do
not know to what I am referring when I refer to "what
happened"; indeed, a common enough experience in any
attempt to say of any experience "what happened", but
the consequences of this conception makes a sense of
accuracy much more pressing in this case.

I tried this,but I'm having problems with the endings. I tried "not with a
whimper but a bang" but that didn't work. Then I tried "and they all went
down to the seashore" but that didn't sound quite right either. Then "and
they all lived happily ever after" occurred to me and somehow the poem
still didn't fit. I guess I'm just a bad New York poet because I don't feel
better, and I don't feel any impact. The above post did help me with one
thing,though. I passed on the impulse to post some further insight...

Apparently unconfirmed newspaper reports over here suggest that members of
the Taliban are keen followers of BBC Radio's bucolic soap 'The Archers',
the longest running broadcast programme in the world.

Those of who you who know the series (being broadcast as I write) will
appreciate the sublime incongruity of the rural small talk and never-never
village idyll (it takes place 'in between' the borders of Warwickshire and
Worcestershire) and the mullahs from the dessicated hills.

Something it seems somewhere still retains a glint of humour.

Bill. I hadnt had time to see this: I've been "swinging" crazily on this
whole thing since it happpened. I know you're right and its stupid to feel
guilty...you're are right though: I'm not capable of killing on whatever
side, or of being a racsist: my "problem" is that I wierdly "see" every
thing simultaneously..I am probably not alone in this: I think a good
novelist would have to be like that: to really see, I mean see things: but
of course I dont know any answers...truth is the first casualty of war as
they say....some questions of what is reality are raised...
   It would be impossible to write coldly on this issue (or at least be
"cold blooded" as one wrote)........at least we have the commonality of
wanting a better and more egalitarian world, less suffering, are not killers
as such,we  love poetry and art and so on: most of us are disagreeing about
methods and reactions and our language picks up a lot of rhetoric. Whatever
I feel about Big Bad America: I couldnt go to kill Americans but my point
was that sometimes a note of smugness creeps in from the more conservative
people: but then I've been smug myself.
  One issue is "does the ends (ever ) justify the means"?
  One positive thing about all this is the heightened interest now in
international politics and the sufferingsof others (not that the guys who
hit the towers necessarily cared about those issues: in a way they were or
are catalysts) and some of the "bad" things (not exclusive reserve of the US
of course or even the West)....certainly I oppose military action by the US:
as to causes and who did the actual act and "what's behind it" that's always
going to be the subject of debate.
   I have found it hard to read poetry as I used to, or write much,how about
others?...by the way just before this happened I was planning to "cut myself
off" from the News as a kind of experiment. I was becoming increasingly
indifferent to Int or other News..then this news hit...
      Regards, Richard. PS I tend to "go off the deep end"...must control
that, the tendency to rave...it acheives nothing: I dont even convince
myself!

Avoiding Bin Laden's Trap

Bernard Haykel
Assistant Professor of Islamic Studies
New York University


The war America is engaged in after the attacks on the WTC, the Pentagon and
Pennsylvania is a war for the hearts and minds of average Muslims around the
world.  Bin Laden, if indeed he is the mastermind behind the attacks, has
set a trap for the US into which it must not fall.  By attacking the US as
part of a jihad ("a holy war"), Bin Laden is in fact claiming to Muslims to
represent their grievances and to represent real Islam.  He is in effect
saying: "Muslims, I share your grievances unlike your corrupt and
authoritarian governments; I am the only one doing something about it. I
have destroyed the symbols of American capitalism and stopped the heartbeat
of world finance which the US dominates."

The US, as well as moderate Muslims the world over, must unite and deny him
this symbolic victory and must not accept to engage him in combat on these
terms.  We should not let him define the terms of our intellectual and
symbolic battle.  As a professor of Islamic law I have researched the law of
jihad and can state unequivocally that the war Bin Laden has engaged us in
cannot be labeled a jihad.  Furthermore, I believe a strong case can be made
that he has acted contrary to the tenets of Islam and can be ostracized from
the community of believing Muslims.  Moderate Muslims will agree with me,
certainly, as they are horrified by this attack and are desperate to have it
disassociated from their religion.  The West must provide moderate Muslims a
way out of Bin Laden's trap.

According to Islamic law there are at least six reasons why Bin Laden’s
barbaric violence cannot fall under the rubric of jihad: 1) Individuals and
organizations cannot declare a jihad, only states can; 2) One cannot kill
innocent women and children when conducting a jihad; 3) One cannot kill
Muslims in a jihad; 4) One cannot fight a jihad against a country in which
Muslims can freely practice their religion and proselytize Islam; 5)
Prominent Muslim jurists around the world have condemned these attacks and
their condemnation forms a juristic consensus (ijma`) against Bin Laden's
actions.  This consensus renders his actions un-Islamic; 6) The welfare and
interest of the Muslim community (maslaha) is being harmed by Bin Laden’s
actions and this equally makes them un-Islamic.

The Muslim Sentiment on "The Street":

Americans have been baffled by reports that Muslims do not like, and even
hate the US.  Muslims do not hate America.  As proof of this we have: seven
million Muslims living in the US; foreign Muslims, like many others around
the world, clamor to obtain US immigration visas for the US; Muslims consume
American products and emulate American fashions (intellectual, social and
sartorial); Muslims place the bulk of their money in US financial
institutions; the list goes on and on.  What many Muslims undeniably resent
about America, however, are American foreign policies towards Iraq, Iran,
Israel/Palestine and a complicit policy of supporting corrupt and
authoritarian regimes all over the Muslim world.  Yet despite this
resentment only 4,000 Muslims actively seek to destroy America.  These 4,000
Muslims are Bin Laden’s foot soldiers.  Let us remember that in 20 years of
recruitment Bin Laden has only been able to recruit 4,000 men.  This group,
otherwise known as the Arab-Afghans, have theological and legal beliefs that
are at odds with the remaining 1 billion plus Muslims in the world today.
They are also at odds with those of their supporters, the Taliban, who, for
their part, are fanatical Hanafis of the Deoband school. Surely, 4,000 men
do not represent the entirety of the Islamic peoples?--and we should hammer
this point home continually.  We should also deny Bin Laden the opportunity
of feeding off Muslim resentment and his claim to represent them.

An immediate plan of action for the US and Western governments:

There are very practical steps the US government can take that will take the
wind out of Bin Laden's sails and sidestep the trap he has laid.  I will
begin with the most obvious measures. They are:

1. We should not send US or Western troops and special forces into
Afghanistan with the aim of arresting or killing Bin Laden.  He has thought
about this scenario and desires it.  A military attack on him would provide
a double victory: If he is killed he dies a martyr and symbol of resistance
to Western domination; he also gets to kill a number of US soldiers and
tarnishes the image of America in the minds of ordinary Muslims.
Afghanistan is the most backward and probably the poorest country in the
Islamic world; the image of the most powerful nation stomping on it will be
a public relations disaster and will destabilize Arab regimes.

We must encourage Muslim countries to lead the fight against Bin Laden.
Support the Northern Alliance who have 15,000 troops in Afghanistan and work
on the Pakistani moderates to get involved in the fight.  If retribution, as
seems to be the case, has to take place and America must feel it is the
prime agent in the pursuit of justice, then no military action can afford
not to involve moderate Muslim forces and their cooperation.  This is not a
plea for war, far from it: there is too much bellicose rhetoric as it is.

2.  We must stop using inflammatory language, such as President Bush's
statement that this is a crusade. Such a word evokes monstrous historical
memories in the minds of Muslims, namely barbaric Europeans rampaging
through the Eastern Mediterranean.  Furthermore, Crusade connotes
Christianity versus Islam and this is not the right message.  The infelicity
of this locution has presumably been brought to the attention of the
President.

3.  We must publish a list of all the Muslims and women and children who
died in the WTC attack, since Islamic law categorically prohibits the murder
of such innocents.

4. We must engage our own Muslim community leaders here in the US, and,
particularly, send the respected ones among them with these facts to the
Middle East and South Asia to meet with impartial and respected Islamic
legal scholars, people who are respected by the man on the street and who
are clearly not in the employ of their respective governments.

Scholars in Mecca, Medina and Riyadh will be central in this regard, as will
scholars in India and Pakistan.  These scholars must be convinced to issue
fatwas (legal opinions) declaring Bin Laden's teachings and actions illegal.
Because it is prohibited by mainstream Islam, they cannot declare Bin Laden
an infidel (a practice called takfir) and we should not expect this of them.
These opinions will help bolster the consensus mentioned above and may
convince the Taliban that they need to hand Bin Laden over.

5. In the near future, we must put forth subtle hints that we will be
willing to reassess our foreign policies in the world.

I think if we take the steps outlined above we may be able to ostracize Bin
Laden from the Muslim community and energize moderate Muslims to take center
stage again.  America will win the war as will the vast majority of Muslims.

Four new books forthcoming from Faux Press:

'on my way' by Eileen Myles, 72 pages, 12.50

Terry Castle in the London Review of Books writes of Eileen Myles's
poetry as "precocious, punked out, exquisitely droll..." In 'on my
way' Myles concentrates on public and intimate transactions through
long and short poems and an essay entitled "The End of New England,"
which takes up questions of contemporary poetry and Massachusetts
working-class speech.


'Western Capital Rhapsodies' by Marcella Durand, 128 pages, 12.50

In this well-timed urban document Marcella Durand offers sets of
poem-cycles, written over the last six years under the shadow of the
Brooklyn Bridge, an exploration of the universal city, both interior
and exterior, wild and developed, inaccessible and open. Joe Elliot
writes, "In Durand's poetry there is no ghost outside the poem ... No
trying. Just reality..."


'Memoir 1960-1963' by Tony Towle, 104 pages, 12.50

John Ashbery describes Tony Towle's poetry as "one of the New York
School's best-kept secrets." Towle's memoirs are fast-paced prose
recollections of events and live-wire characters, including Frank
O'Hara, Kenneth Koch, Frank Lima, Ted Berrigan, and many others who
shaped and structured his first days as a poet during the early years
of the New York School 'before anyone was famous.'


'How To Proceed in the Arts' by Gary Sullivan, 104 pages, 12.50

The craft and high jinks of making it the world of poetry and art are
the consistent focus of Gary Sullivan's madcap processing of maximum
impact pieces: love letters as posts to e-lists, a fake writer's
survey, an imagined interview between Clark Coolidge and Gertrude
Stein, and much more. Jordan Davis suggests Sullivan "should quit his
day job and become the Lester Bangs of poetry."

this is a super complex issue. Israel was founded by a romantic ideal, to
give Jews a homeland but it was based in the ideal put forth in Genesis that
God gave eretz israel to the people.  The people who lived in the land
before 1948 have not been treated well since 1948. This is not to say that
the Israelis have been good or bad it is just to say that in 1948 1.2
million Arabs and 400,000 Jews lived in Palestine, today 6 million Jews live
on that land.  Much of the Arab land was expropriated and many regions that
were populated for thousands of years were denuded of Arabs and filled with
Eastern European Jews. Nazareth is a good example of this. In 1948 Nazareth
had a population on 160,000 mostly Christian Arabs. The community dated from
the 3rd Century.  Today the Nazareth Region has less than 67,000 Arabs and
250,000 Jews.  Is this any less ethnic cleansing than what Hitler did in
Poland with the jews? I think the answer to this issue is frankly
Polandization. That is what happened in the ethnically mixed areas of Poland
after WW2.  Germans were removed from areas to be given to Poland, Poles
were removed from areas given to Russia greating an ethnically pure germany,
poland and Russia.  The Arabs in Palestine should be given a state,  the
Jews should have Israel, the nations of the world should guarantee security
to both nations and we should not ask them to live together. Maybe this
would work? It appears that this worked between Poland and Germany?

Dear J.,
Thank you for your reply. I am aware of most of what you mention that is
happening at UCB. I agree that my characterization was a bit flamboyant and
flip. I do have respect for what is happening amongst some of the students
at Cal; however that is tempered by both my experience as a student there
and more by my experience as a citizen of Berkeley since birth. There are
ways in which the student and academic populations overwhelm the town and
these aggrieve me at times (I realize the economic "boon" the univ brings
and parts of the cultural, tho I wouldn't give as much credit as is given by
some). Also I recall the snippy egomania of such movements I was
peripherally involved in as a student there. So, I was flip, much the same
way I've been flip about our President.
I do not agree if I take your meaning correctly that the Left shouldn't
critique its own. Such critique can come in many forms. However I agree this
doesn't seem to be the place for such. But then, where is, these days.

Elizabeth Treadwell

Chinese Working Overtime to Sew U.S. Flags

By John Pomfret
Washington Post Foreign Service
Thursday, September 20, 2001; Page A14

SHANGHAI -- As America wraps its wounds in red, white and blue, flag
factories in China are running nonstop to feed the overwhelming demand in
the United States for the Stars and Stripes.

At the Shanghai Mei Li Hua Flags Co., office director Wu Guomin has received
orders for more than 500,000 flags from customers in the United States in
the week since the terrorist attacks in New York and Washington. "I guess
because we make so many of these things you could say we feel a little
closer to the situation there," Wu said as he fingered an American flag.
"We're working day and night."

The Jin Teng Flag Co. in neighboring Zhejiang province reported orders of
600,000. "It's crazy and very, very sad," said Jin Teng, the factory owner.
"Everyone is on overtime trying to satisfy demand."

Jin and Wu said that even with China's National Day fast approaching on Oct.
1, they have stopped making Chinese flags so that they can fill U.S.
orders..

"We've been presented with an opportunity to make a lot more money than we
usually do making these flags," said Wu, whose factory sells medium-size
flags to U.S. distributors for about $1 apiece. "But we won't take it. We
really didn't want to make too much of a profit on other people's sadness."

At the Shanghai plant, Fei Xiaohua, a laborer, was sewing a 6-by-9-foot
flag. "This is my 50th so far today," she said, her fingers working nimbly.
"Sometimes I don't like this job. But this time, what I'm doing seems worth
it."

It is unclear what percentage of U.S. flags are made in China, but as with
all textiles, the numbers have boomed in recent years. China produces more
shoes and clothes for the U.S. market than any other country. In a few
years, China will become the biggest producer of computer parts for the U.S.
market as well.

The flag business illustrates the increasingly close trade ties between
China and the United States, valued last year at more than $100 billion.
Those ties are expected to expand with China's imminent accession to the
World Trade Organization (WTO). China moved a giant step forward toward that
goal last weekend when the organization generally agreed on its conditions
for entry.

"WTO should provide a great opportunity for us," said Wu, a suave
44-year-old manager. "Right now, no one around the world can really compete
with us flag makers. We have good machines and rock-bottom labor costs."

Wu and Jin said they hoped Americans would not mind that Chinese were making
their flags. The manufacture of such patriotic symbols has caused trouble in
the past. Following the April 1 collision of a U.S. Navy  reconnaissance
plane and a Chinese jet fighter off China's southern coast, the Pentagon
canceled contracts to outfit Army soldiers with a "Made in China" black
beret.

China, too, has used trade as a lever in relations with Washington,
expressing occasional discontent with U.S. policies by cozying up to
Europe's Airbus Industries instead of Boeing Co. But this time, in the days
following  the disaster, as the global airline market crashed, China
repeated its commitment to buy 30 Boeing 737s, making it one of the world's
bright spots for aviation firms.

"We are living in a really global world right now," said Wu. "It's natural
that China manufactures simple things for the whole world. We have a
manufacturing economy." But Sun Zhenyu, a top trade official, warned today
that China's export growth, a key element in China's economy, will likely
face a serious threat for the remainder of the year, according to the
official New China News Agency. Already, Chinese travel agents are reporting
hundreds of cancellations.

"The U.S. economy is already bad, surely this will affect the global
economy, including China," Sun said.

METROPOLITAN DIARY

by Bobby Kelly & Mike Topp

Fountain of Youth

I was sitting on the number 7 crosstown bus when the older gentleman in
front of me began to vibrate. I knew what that meant, but before I could
get
out of the way, sure enough, he exploded. Bits of flesh flew everywhere
and
the blood ruined the bag of feces I was carrying (a memento of my nephew's
first communion). I looked across the aisle at a stylish twenty-something
blonde who had chunks of organ meat all over her obviously expensive
dress.
"Old people!" she laughed, as she twisted her body to spray me with a
stream
of warm urine.

We may be asking ourselves these days, " ...is there a purpose to
poetry?" Fall Community Workshop Leader JOHANNA KELLER says, "...during
times of great suffering and strife, poets have answered this question
with words that have endured."  In this workshop, we will come together
to read participants' current poems, and write new ones. Each class will
include close readings of poems and related optional exercises.
Writers at all levels of development are welcome. 8 consecutive
Wednesdays begin October 17th. The fee is $200. Johanna Keller is the
author of "The Skull: North Carolina, 1961" (The Press at Colorado
College, 1998) and co-editor of "Carolyn Kizer: Perspectives on Her Life
and Work" (CavanKerry Press, 2001).

And...this Sunday, October 7th, Marie Ponsot, will read for us at 1 p.m.

All events are at The Society for Ethical Culture, 4450 Fieldston Road,
in the Bronx. Write here or call 718-549-5192 for details.

SAVE October 28th, 1p.m. for An Afternoon of Scottish Poetry featuring
Don Paterson and Kathleen Jamie...more on that in the next
newsletter...EXOTERICA...we'll be spreading the word...

on the same, everywhere, leading to vast disseminations


(i won't repeat the geopolitical arguments; within them, there are other
concerns, perhaps useless, perhaps nagging at the remnants of occidental
epistemology that survive.)

certainly the attack was brilliant, planned for years, a trail both open,
swollen like a carapace, and closed/foreclosed, just with/before the
proper name: bin laden.

open to the extent that hundreds have been arrested, that the amerikan
psyche seems (at this close proximity, useless in the long run)
permanently wounded; every mode of transportation, from foot to cruise
ship to airplane is closely monitored - and still box-cutters get through.

there is no protection; there never has been. but for the violent symbolic
misery of the wtc: this will be lost forever. one collapse, one
catastrophe, metonymically spreads, just as body-parts turn to sintered
dust. if culture remains behind the walls of the raw and the cooked, the
pure and profaned, we now understand, more than ever, its abject roots.

the nomadic seizes the empire; viral organisms move from one motel to
another, one city to another, one plane to another. the empire remains in
the grid, situates itself at the cartesian origin (its own form of violent
foreclosure); the empire _is_ the grid. organisms leave no trace; they
appear to reproduce indefinitely; they are of the stones themselves; they
are your next-door neighbor, your relative.

this is endemic within a domain in which, i believe, evil is doubly-
countenanced: the evil of an intolerant fundamentalism, and the evil of
any organized religion splaying gods in skies, proclaiming truth.

i have no doubt about this evil, which expresses itself as godlike, far
more than any good: good is of the earth; evil comes from above.

ethics is unwarranted, but is all one has. think of the postmodern world
as seepages against monuments to modernism: the world trade center towers,
human beings who resist fragmentation, the media coagulating, now, around
understandable patriotic ideologies which, of course, carry their own
implicit violence.

what do we do? we write constantly; we examine our earlier work for signs
of future holocaust; we respond. the original acts themselves were their
own responses; the multiplicity of fbi, cia, and other agents, plays
against quadruple singularities; the singularities play out, as embers,
against the multiplicity of victims.

they could have been anyone, anywhere; on that day, distance collapsed,
stuff broke. from outer space there must have been a flicker. think of
civilizations winking out everywhere in the universe, at the service of
nuclear and biological weapons, rigid ideological formations, as if
instinctual, closing down in pain.

so a new mathematics of the real is born: the monad home to rest in
collapse, and multiplicity fanning out among suburban, urban, and nomadic
landscapes. the attacks alone were delimited - all that earlier fanning
out returning to the origin of a violent religious asceticism. what the
taliban are doing on a daily basis - the culling of difference - occurred
in collusion in new york. penetrated permanently, we are all the poorer
for it.

Andy Clausen was born Andre Laloux in a Belgian bomb shelter in 1943. He was
raised in Oakland, California. USA. He graduated from Bishop O'Dowd High
School in 1961 and attended six colleges. He began trying to be a "beat"
poet in 1965 after reading Kerouac, Ginsberg, Corso et al. He has traveled
and read his poetry all over North America and the world (New York,
California, Alaska, Texas, Prague, Kathmandu, Amsterdam etc.). He has
maintained a driven intrepid lifestyle and aspired to be a champion of the
underdog. His chief books have been: The Iron Curtain of Love, Without
Doubt, and his selected verse of 30 years, 40th Century Man. Allen Ginsberg
not only called him the "Future of American Poetry" but in the introduction
to Without Doubt, said he would take a chance on a "President Clausen."
Clausen has taught at Naropa Institute and given readings and lectures at
many universities. He has worked for poetry in the schools agencies in
California, New Jersey, Colorado and New York. He is now a stone mason,
troubadour, and a freelance teacher of creative writing under the auspices
of Teachers & Writers in the NYC school system. He is presently working on
memoirs of his friendship and adventures with Allen Ginsberg, Gregory Corso
and many others of the Beat Generation. In 1982 he was voted the most
exciting poet at the Kerouac Conference in Boulder, Colorado.

i for one would be happy to airlift all Jews --and anyone else who'd like
to come along --in Israel to the united states and *then* allow the US to
"abandon Israel."  but i don't think they'd all want to come.  Israel was
an experiment that does not seem to have worked, but before abandoning it
there must be some situation whereby Jews can live in safety.

I seem to be stuck in using "after it all started happening" when referring
to things I did that that day or soon after.  And, now just "the thing on
the 11th".  I have a friend whose birthday is that day.  Another who was
coming out of a concussion from a fall the night before wondering if she was
still dreaming.

It's all fairly name-less.  Maybe it's because the media and marketing
machines have gotten so good at subverting the language for fast
thought-transfers.  Anything that we name now seems to be "false" because it
sounds like someone in the media came up with it.

This disturbs me now... that a an amorphous system like the media can so
control our language that we (or at least I) feel uncomfortable naming
things.  Has it always been this way?  Or is this event, the thing on the
11th, really so hard to distill?  Or, does this event bring to light the
"violence of naming" (such a strange phrase now)?  Naming it seems to reduce
it.  It is such a tangled web that any name becomes limiting and makes
invisible some other important part that we don't want to forget...

think that my earlier message makes clear the reasoning behind the
decision. By way of providing context for that reasoning, I should like to
note that one of the unfortunate aspects of my position here has been that
certain messages seem guaranteed to draw irritation or even resentment [A]
from the person who attempted to send the message in question, if it is not
forwarded - this is the situation in which I am a 'dangerous censor'; and
[B] from other subscribers if it is forwarded - the situation in which I
have exhibited a lapse of simple courtesy or even "human decency."
Sometimes the criticisms are accurate even from my own perspective, and
sometimes they are not - it is always useful to keep in mind that this
List, beyond its life 'in the online,' engages 900 or so disparate personal
and political contexts. Occasional contact with the moderators of other
lists has demonstrated that the Hazard is endemic even to smaller lists. I
have generally opted to deal with it by circulating contentious messages
rather than withholding them. The exception is that, aside from the
occasional error, I do not forward messages to this list that abuse other
subscribers or the list owners/administration; a policy of which everyone
was made aware when I was invited to moderate the list, and of which
subsequent subscribers have been notified in the Welcome Message. When such
messages come through, as they only occasionally do, I respond by politely
asking the person who sent the message to tone it down.

As to the potential charmingness of "windbag" - being poets, I am confident
that we all recognize the degree to which a word's import is subject to
usage; Gary's use of the word was, for instance, somewhat witty in its
context.

It is, of course, entirely possible - as suggested - that the "sasq" post
was put forward by a pseudonymous subscriber; on that count, some of you
may have noticed that on the next afternoon I posted an emendation to the
Welcome Message noting such presences on the List.

Finally, I'd like to add one clarification. Gary wrote:

Those of you who read my response will, I hope, realize that I never
suggested to Murat that he "just walk away from" anything - the reference
was to my own desire for an end to a confrontation unrelated to the "sasq"
post.

I don't want to take the list further off course, but
I am completely wracked over this issue these days.
My family is very Zionist: we lived in Israel for a
number of years and, in fact, my grandfather lived
there as a child when it was Palestine and his mother
helped found the first modern Hebrew-speaking
kindergarden.
Anyway, I myself have a lot of problems with Israel,
not only in its relationship to the Palestinians but
also in its patriarchy, its internal racism, etc.  And
agree with Maria that it is an experiment which may
have been done with some good intentions but also with
great carelessness and cruelty and very badly.  In
fact, I'd say it's a test case for colonialism gone
awry.  But now what?  There are millions of Jews who
live there and feel like there is really no other
place for them to go, and this is largely because
there isn't.  Many Israelis were kicked out or fled
from countries were they were being persecuted or
killed: the Soviet Union, Yemen, Germany, Lebanon,
Ethiopia, etc.  This is no excuse for anything, it's
just a more complicating factor.  The Jewish history
is that of the nomad, the refugee, the diaspora.  Is
this the only way the world can function, with Jews in
that role?

My two biggest questions: the UN -- the international
community, including the US -- got Israel into this
mess: what is the global community's role in getting
them out of it?

And also: I think so much of the heat around this
issue stems from cultural identity: Jews like to think
of ourselves as the persecuted, not the persecutors.
Admiting what Israelis are doing to Palestinians, and
have been doing, and the bloody and unjust foundation
of the establishment of the nation would require a
completely new understanding of the Jewish self.

And I already struggle with my own ethnic self-hatred,
so I have a field day here.  And I read Celan, and
Kafka.

Sorry to digress.

Altho, of course, the US isnt the only capitalist nation: and the guys who
attackd are motivated by ...well we dont know...but if  "purely"
religious...they..any "attacker" would  attack what or who they perceive to
be rich or "better off", as Bill Austin said anger arises from frustration
to be unable to change things: from a sense of injustice, even from things
being "not right in your mind" or the reaction of the "child" in us to
authority...with many in the Third World as its caused they may have
legitimate "gripes" which uts sometimes easier to turn against something
huge that may or not be (sometimes is) part of the cause: but there are many
causes....if the guy who was going to Syria to attack Americans was for real
then one can understand that:its not obscene (what is obscene?)...but
certainly we've got to think to what extent we (anyone who is in the
capitalistic west or non-Muslim or perceived to be part of the right wing
oppressive "machine"...) are culapable or "legitimate targets"...maybe our
response here should be to start learning a hell of a lot more about the
politics, history, culture, religions, and so on of these countries...eg. I
believe that there are Israelis who are against their own Government..and
surely not all Jews are necessarily Zionist anymore than all  Muslims
supppport Palestine or are rejectful of "Western decadance" and so on...to
attack maybe in some circumstances, but ALL....I dont know..but these
thoughts are generated somehow. Richard.

   Usually reliable Arabic Sources have just announced that Israel has given up. Millions of Jews, many of whom have lived in the Mid-East for hundred if not 1,000's of years, are fleeing. They are planing, carring, shipping, walking and swimming to Minnessota. All the usual Arabic governments have put out an urgent call for American Academics well versed in multi-culturism for the new reality......DRn..

Time Mechanix 16: "Towards a Trotskyist Poetics? The Example of Earle
Birney"
A talk by Louis Cabri. Thursday October 25  8pm at KSW (nb: not at Robson)
Born in Calgary, 1904, raised in the Kootenays, Earle Birney established the
first Trotskyist group in Western Canada and drafted policy documents for
the founding body of Trotskyism in Canada. His singular trajectory from
radical sectarian to canonical poet absorbs contradictions in a way that
only a ‘Trotskyist poetics’ might resolve. The tenuous thread of radical
Marxism in Canada, in its relation to poetic practice, particularly
modernist form, begins, like it or not, with the example of Earle Birney.

Richard,

It is easier for you, it appears to me, to have this admiration for the
September elevening of New York city from New Zealand (I assume that's where
you live); essentially, because you don't really believe that New Zealand
would be the target of a future biological attack -not because of a political
reason, but simply because New Zealand does not have enough concentration of
population to make it a "cost effectivge" target.

I wonder if you would post the same "revolutionary," "prophetic" ("the
beginning of the end of capitalism," so on and so forth) posts if you were
living in New York City.

I am curious what kind of correlation there exists, among the people on the
list, between their political attitudes towards the catastrophe and the
population density of the place where they live. Can we run an informal poll
on that?

September 11 is, among other things, an attack on the idea of people living
together as a community, in a large polis, an attack on the idea of modern
(at least Western) urban living.

Murat

The New York Times: Monday October 01

The Eerily Intimate Power of Poetry to Console
By DINITIA SMITH

In the weeks since the terrorist attacks, people have been consoling
themselves with poetry in an almost unprecedented way.

Bits of famous poems, original poems, snatches of verse pinned alongside
photos of the victims. In the weeks since the terrorist attacks, people have
been consoling themselves and one another with poetry in an almost
unprecedented way. Almost immediately after the event, improvised memorials
often conceived around poems sprang up all over the city, in store windows,
at bus stops, in Washington Square Park, Brooklyn Heights and elsewhere. And
poems flew through cyberspace across the country in e-mails from friend to
friend.

On the day of the disaster, someone sent a copy of Shelley's "Ozymandias" to
a circle of friends and suggested that if the World Trade Center were ever
to be rebuilt, it should bear a plaque with the inscription "My name is
Ozymandias, king of kings:/ Look on my works, ye Mighty, and despair!"

Copies of Auden's "September 1, 1939," written after Germany invaded Poland,
were everywhere. "The unmentionable odour of death," Auden wrote, "Offends
the September night."

At Union Square Park, which had one of the biggest memorials, an
American-Indian poem was pinned on the wire fence: "In the dawn I gathered
cedar-boughs/ Sweet, sweet was their odor/ They were wet with tears/ The
sweetness will not leave my hands." Another mourner put up lines from Yeats:
"All the words that I utter,/ And all the words that I write,/ Must spread
out their wings untiring,/ And never rest in their flight,/ Till they come
where your sad, sad heart is."

Three days after the attack, at a memorial service for the victims at the
92nd Street Y, David Yezzi, director of the Unterberg Poetry Center, read
lines by the Israeli poet Yehuda Amichai: "This is the end of the landscape.
Among blocks/ of concrete and rusting iron/ there's a fig tree with heavy
fruit/ but even kids don't come around to pick it."

The poet laureate of the United States, Billy Collins, said that since Sept.
11 he had been inundated with poems from friends poems by Yeats, by the
Chilean poet Pablo Neruda, by the Polish poet Wislawa Szymborska all
writers, he noted, from countries that have known war. "We, as innocents, as
Americans, have never been invaded," Mr. Collins said. "We haven't produced
a poetry that has much authority in this area."

"With all of the neglect of poetry and the hand wringing about how other
media have bulldozed poets," Mr. Collins said, "in times of crisis it's
interesting that people don't turn to the novel or say, `We should all go
out to a movie,' or, `Ballet would help us.' It's always poetry. What we
want to hear is a human voice speaking directly in our ear."

Mr. Collins compared the status of the poet in contemporary life to that of
the goalie in hockey. "The goalie in hockey stands apart from others,
marginalized," he said. "When all the skating and sliding around on the ice
begins to fail us, the goalie is the poet."

For 10 years Mr. Collins has been running a poetry program at the Katonah
Public Library in Westchester County. On the Sunday after the disaster,
Stephen Dunn, the poet, was the featured speaker. "We had well over 100
people," Mr. Collins said. "Normally 40 or 30 would be a respectable
audience."

Mr. Dunn began by reading one of his poems called "To a Terrorist": "For the
historical ache, the ache passed down/ which finds its circumstances and
becomes/ the present ache, I offer this poem/ without hope, knowing there's
nothing,/ not even revenge, which alleviates/ a life like yours. . . ."

But after that initial poem, Mr. Dunn announced that from then on he was
going to read only love poems: "I am astounded/ by the various kisses we're
capable of," he read, from his poem "Each From Different Heights."

And reading love poems aloud in the midst of sorrow seemed just the right
thing to do, Mr. Collins said. "I felt after the reading that he had
provided a small counterweight to put on the other side of the dreadfully
lopsided scale," he said. "It was a tiny weight in the other direction, the
beginning of moving back to equilibrium."

The poet Robert Pinsky, who is a former poet laureate of the United States,
said he had also been showered with poems from friends, as well as by
requests from various publications for poems in keeping with the general
mood of mourning. On "The NewsHour With Jim Lehrer" right after the tragedy,
Mr. Pinsky, who is a regular presence on the program, read Marianne Moore's
"What Are Years?," a poem that has been passed frequently from person to
person through e-mail in recent weeks. "What is our innocence,/ what is our
guilt? All are/ naked, none is safe."

"Poetry has an intimacy because it is in the reader's voice, in one person's
breath," Mr. Pinsky said, echoing Mr. Collins. "We are in a culture of
spectacle. With poetry, you say it aloud yourself, in your own voice."

In ancient societies and even today in oral cultures, poetry has had a
public function, as the repository of stories, genealogies, moral ideas and
collective emotion. But in recent history, "the job of the poet has become
more and more marginalized," said Bob Holman, a poet who has been involved
in the spoken word movement, an effort to take poetry down from its
pedestal. The poet has become "the player of words," he said, engaging
mostly in high-level language games.

But changes are occurring, said Mr. Holman, ever hopeful, "as our culture
listens to language artistically and poetry becomes more democratized and
participatory."

He quoted from a poem by William Carlos Williams: "It is difficult/ to get
the news from poems/ yet men die miserably every day/ for lack/ of what is
found there."

"I think we are fulfilling William Carlos Williams's poem," Mr. Holman said.
"We are finding the news in poetry."

I was wrong, not only in Western urban sense: whether is Gaza or in Jerusalem
or in New york City, etc., terrorism is a violent act against people coming
together, whether for street demonstrations or day to day living.

Seen from that angle, may be, we can use the word "terrorist" fairly, both as
an act against the East and the West,
avoiding the cringing self rigtheousness -justified in this case- of the
American media/political language.

Maybe it is not that surprising. Isn't the logical consequence of bin Laden's
terroristic methods a world utopia of little villages?

something that interests me here is that only three weeks after the 'event'
the media seems to have succeeded to some extent in 'blanding' down the
whole thing into consumable bits that fit into news slots.  I hope it's not
on it's way to becoming another advertising wave of McDonald's toys.

Dear Gary,

We had a similar experience in another list that I'm on, this one is
devoted to fans of the pop singer Kylie Minogue, and in the hours
after the bombings in NY and DC, it became clear that many on the
list were very happy to see the TV news and to find out so many had
died.  Ordinarily the list is filled with trivia and fan effusions,
endless threads about "Will Kylie's New Single Make #1" "Kylie vs
Posh," "Will EMI Ever Release Kylie's Duet with Bono" et cetera, but
because Kylie is well known in most parts of the world she has many
Muslim fans too, from the fundamentalist countries, and soon our
board was filled with new threads saying, "America Deserves This" and
so forth.  Largely these were written by very young people, 14, 15,
16 years old, but also from people in their 20s and 30s, from many
countries.  These expressions of glee then became the subject of
intense debate on the board, from the US and UK fans who wanted the
moderator to ban the worst offenders, to others who while deploring
the untimely expression, pleaded that the fundamentalist (perhaps the
"Taliban") position be given a chance to speak.  One New Yorker
outraged by the "America Deserves This" went ballistic so to speak
and pronounced a fatwa on all Muslims world wide.  The next day he
retracted this, said he spoke out of fear, rage, and grief because so
many of his friends had died in World Trade Center. In the weeks
since all sides have continued to quarrel, make up, broker peace,
renege on agreements, -- then of course there are the above-it-all
types who claim that "This is a group where we all love Kylie
Minogue!  Can't we all just be happy that she has reached #1 again
with her biggest hit to date?"   This issue still has not been worked
out to everyone's satisfaction.  But actually take it all in all I
have found a quality of progressive thought and discussion on the
Kylie list that is easily the equal of the quality on the Poetics
List, and I imagine this is true of others and the other Lists they
also belong to.

I only bring this up because, this was a case in which, instead of 1
threatening post, which we now think was a hoax or satire of some
kind, there were literally scores of such messages and they
represented in toto quite a shock to the system, and I'm not even in
NY unlike you my dear pal!!!

See you soon . . . xxx Kevin Killian

What about about the "Objects" and "Food" sections from Gertrude Stein's
_Tender Buttons_.  Also, Williams has lots of poems that fall into this
category; one of my favorites is "The Rose" from _Spring and All_, but there
are plenty of others, too numerous to mention.

Let's not forget - Rushdie is a long time victim of the same fanatical =
intolerance that produced the Sept. 11th attacks on the United States.

Fighting the Forces of Invisibility=20


By Salman Rushdie

Tuesday, October 2, 2001; Page A25=20


NEW YORK -- In January 2000 I wrote in a newspaper column that "the =
defining struggle of the new age would be between Terrorism and =
Security," and fretted that to live by the security experts' worst-case =
scenarios might be to surrender too many of our liberties to the =
invisible shadow-warriors of the secret world. Democracy requires =
visibility, I argued, and in the struggle between security and freedom =
we must always err on the side of freedom. On Tuesday, Sept. 11, =
however, the worst-case scenario came true.

They broke our city. I'm among the newest of New Yorkers, but even =
people who have never set foot in Manhattan have felt its wounds deeply, =
because New York is the beating heart of the visible world, =
tough-talking, spirit-dazzling, Walt Whitman's "city of orgies, walks =
and joys," his "proud and passionate city -- mettlesome, mad, =
extravagant city!" To this bright capital of the visible, the forces of =
invisibility have dealt a dreadful blow. No need to say how dreadful; we =
all saw it, are all changed by it. Now we must ensure that the wound is =
not mortal, that the world of what is seen triumphs over what is =
cloaked, what is perceptible only through the effects of its awful =
deeds.

In making free societies safe -- safer -- from terrorism, our civil =
liberties will inevitably be compromised. But in return for freedom's =
partial erosion, we have a right to expect that our cities, water, =
planes and children really will be better protected than they have been. =
The West's response to the Sept. 11 attacks will be judged in large =
measure by whether people begin to feel safe once again in their homes, =
their workplaces, their daily lives. This is the confidence we have =
lost, and must regain.=20

Next: the question of the counterattack. Yes, we must send our =
shadow-warriors against theirs, and hope that ours prevail. But this =
secret war alone cannot bring victory. We will also need a public, =
political and diplomatic offensive whose aim must be the early =
resolution of some of the world's thorniest problems: above all the =
battle between Israel and the Palestinian people for space, dignity, =
recognition and survival. Better judgment will be required on all sides =
in future. No more Sudanese aspirin factories to be bombed, please. And =
now that wise American heads appear to have understood that it would be =
wrong to bomb the impoverished, oppressed Afghan people in retaliation =
for their tyrannous masters' misdeeds, they might apply that wisdom, =
retrospectively, to what was done to the impoverished, oppressed people =
of Iraq. It's time to stop making enemies and start making friends.

To say this is in no way to join in the savaging of America by sections =
of the left that has been among the most unpleasant consequences of the =
terrorists' attacks on the United States. "The problem with Americans is =
. . . " -- "What America needs to understand . . . " There has been a =
lot of sanctimonious moral relativism around lately, usually prefaced by =
such phrases as these. A country which has just suffered the most =
devastating terrorist attack in history, a country in a state of deep =
mourning and horrible grief, is being told, heartlessly, that it is to =
blame for its own citizens' deaths. ("Did we deserve this, sir?" a =
bewildered worker at "ground zero" asked a visiting British journalist =
recently. I find the grave courtesy of that "sir" quite astonishing.)=20

Let's be clear about why this bien-pensant anti-American onslaught is =
such appalling rubbish. Terrorism is the murder of the innocent; this =
time, it was mass murder. To excuse such an atrocity by blaming U.S. =
government policies is to deny the basic idea of all morality: that =
individuals are responsible for their actions. Furthermore, terrorism is =
not the pursuit of legitimate complaints by illegitimate means. The =
terrorist wraps himself in the world's grievances to cloak his true =
motives. Whatever the killers were trying to achieve, it seems =
improbable that building a better world was part of it.

The fundamentalist seeks to bring down a great deal more than buildings. =
Such people are against, to offer just a brief list, freedom of speech, =
a multi-party political system, universal adult suffrage, accountable =
government, Jews, homosexuals, women's rights, pluralism, secularism, =
short skirts, dancing, beardlessness, evolution theory, sex. These are =
tyrants, not Muslims. (Islam is tough on suicides, who are doomed to =
repeat their deaths through all eternity. However, there needs to be a =
thorough examination, by Muslims everywhere, of why it is that the faith =
they love breeds so many violent mutant strains. If the West needs to =
understand its Unabombers and McVeighs, Islam needs to face up to its =
bin Ladens.) United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan has said that =
we should now define ourselves not only by what we are for but by what =
we are against. I would reverse that proposition, because in the present =
instance what we are against is a no-brainer. Suicidist assassins ram =
wide-bodied aircraft into the World Trade Center and Pentagon and kill =
thousands of people: um, I'm against that. But what are we for? What =
will we risk our lives to defend? Can we unanimously concur that all the =
items in the above list -- yes, even the short skirts and dancing -- are =
worth dying for?=20

The fundamentalist believes that we believe in nothing. In his =
world-view, he has his absolute certainties, while we are sunk in =
sybaritic indulgences. To prove him wrong, we must first know that he is =
wrong. We must agree on what matters: kissing in public places, bacon =
sandwiches, disagreement, cutting-edge fashion, literature, generosity, =
water, a more equitable distribution of the world's resources, movies, =
music, freedom of thought, beauty, love. These will be our weapons. Not =
by making war but by the unafraid way we choose to live shall we defeat =
them.=20

How to defeat terrorism? Don't be terrorized. Don't let fear rule your =
life. Even if you are scared.

I think, first, maybe the question has to be : & where were those Eastern
European Jews coming from ?  & what options had they before them in
1948 (& before 1948) ?  before we consider what happened when they got
to Israel, maybe we shld consider the situation before Israel.

second, I'm not sure I understand what you mean exactly by "Polandization."
but Poland after WW2 doesn't seem to be a successful model for anything --
mainly b/c there was no Poland, really, (merely a "Poland") after WW2.
to say that it "worked" b/c it created an "ethnically pure" Poland &
Germany seems strange to me (& not exactly true, as Poland is not, was
not, ethnically homogenous).

I thank you for your thought-provoking post & I do not have an answer to
the question "Is this any less ethnic cleansing than what Hitler did in
Poland to the jews?" except to say let's look at the method.  & the ultimate
goal.  was the method in Nazereth like Hitler's method in Poland ?  was
the goal extinction ? perhaps I am too sensitive to comparisons like these.

yours,
Pattie McCarthy

were populated for thousands of years were denuded of Arabs and filled with

Eastern European Jews. Nazareth is a good example of this. In 1948 Nazareth

had a population on 160,000 mostly Christian Arabs. The community dated from

the 3rd Century.  Today the Nazareth Region has less than 67,000 Arabs and

Poland with the jews? I think the answer to this issue is frankly

Polandization. That is what happened in the ethnically mixed areas of Poland

after WW2.  Germans were removed from areas to be given to Poland, Poles

were removed from areas given to Russia greating an ethnically pure germany,

poland and Russia.  The Arabs in Palestine should be given a state,  the

Jews should have Israel, the nations of the world should guarantee security

to both nations and we should not ask them to live together. Maybe this

would work? It appears that this worked between Poland and Germany?

FANTASY (1994)

A sudden shift in intensity. . .
Triggered by. . .
Bogged down. . .
Nearby. . .
Upset. . .
Incomplete focus. . .
"Continued build up of troops
In the area. . ."
Took it out of fragments. . .
Blocked empathy. . .
Short circuited connections. . .
In pieces. . .
Could have been. . .
Out of. . .
Habituated. . .
Now for a stroll. . .
Climate control. . .
What in an image could illustrate. . .
The state I am trying to describe. . .
At the border of a fantasy. . .
I have internalized. . .
Clink of utensils in a dininghall . . .
Now can almost remember. . .
He or she had built it out of snatches. . .
Of memories none of which were intact. . .
Not only the memory but the event itself. . .
Was composed of such small parts. . .
Yes, I have drawn it to their attention . . .
That's the sound of a plane going by. . .
Primordial interruption. . .
Yet the assessment was out of control. . .
Not only those aspects our office was responsible for. . .
Also, I could only hear a few words. . .
Of each exchange because the radio was on loud. . .
I couldn't say anything. . .
Previous to its being seen. . .
A bridge from the beginnings. . .
To this part. . .
Somebody wants or wanted to start explaining. . .
Naturally I couldn't take over at this point. . .
Something moving through here. . .
By no means certain. . .
Like a few frames in a moving picture. . .
I stood there embarrassed. . .
More feeling than I would like to admit. . .
Her way of presenting a kind of self-conscious understanding. . .
Yet no one could have been sure. . .
It would turn out this way. . .
America-the land of sleep walkers. . .
Tuned continuously to the latest dreams. . .
Intricately constructed from tragic facts. . .
Now hear this. . .
No one must awaken. . .
You heard it first right here. . .
The nascent sound of a motorcar. . .
Yes, that voice was emphatic. . .
The first was indifferent. . .
Moved here as soon as she was moved here. . .
Tremulous. . .awkward . . .endearing. . .mumbling. . .
As luck would have it they could now repair. . .
My latest words were far from coherent. . .
I wouldn't have given it up for the world. . .
But she was suspicious. . .
No one talked to her that way before. . .
As you leave, notice the small stairway to your left. . .
Viewed from that perspective, I might wonder. . .
Take it or leave it. . .
Then again. . .you might say. . .alternatively
Without comfort, or in a temperate zone. . .
As good as disappeared...now, anyway, invisible. . .
30 day moneyback guarantee. . .
Yours for the asking. . .
Yet had you waited another month. . .
Perhaps only a week or two. . .
That lulling feeling of compensation fading. . .
Sleep rising from the bottom of hollow tears. . .
Voices so recognizable, yet only a few words. . .
This is the kind of time you had imagined. . .
Not truly measurable, yet what was its importance. . .
Irreplaceable. . .

I think that recent events have shown that being in the USA does not
necessarily provide safety.

That does not mean that it is a particularly dangerous place to be. (A
number of north Americans have remarked to me recently that they feel
worried about being in London now - after a lifetime of things exploding I
don't feel particularly worried; but there is nowhere safe except relatively

Many of the *Jews who are in Israel now *left USA; many had the opportunity
to go to USA and chose not to

I am concerned about the safety of the Palestinians who were *not in any
great danger until this dangerous and immoral experiment was embarked upon

I am all for safety. I am all for all perceived ethnic groups being treated
equally. I am against privileging one group over another in safety or in
anything else...

I think that I picked up the phrase "abandon Israel"... Concentrating on it
now, I would say that it is time for USA and UK to stop arming that Israel
and to practice some of that "linkage" which seeks to be practiced on racial
grounds - unsafe and rubbish safe havens for Kurds and th armoury of hell
for Israelis

The support anyone is given, particularly military support, should be
contingent upon behaviour. The support given to Israel is often used to maim
and kill Palestinians regardless of their behaviour.

Milosevic is charged, Sharon is not

Before, there is any talk of removing people to USA, let's remember that in
the main the borders of Israel have been conceded although there hasn't been
a proper reciprocationby Israel. If the 1/5th of a million Israelis now
occupuying land which is not within Israel were to remove themselves to
Israel, there could well be peace.

That is not to say the peace will be absolute. There never will be absolute
peace anywhere. But there could be something fairly near it. I see no reason
why there should not. It should certainly be tried.

<< Interview with Afghani Left Revolutionary

 * Talban has lost all support, they will loose power very soon by:
 Farooq Tariq (25-09-2001)

 [A special interview with Adil, leader of Afghanistan Labour
 Revolutionary Organization Adil is leader of a small left wing
 organization based in Afghanistan. He is himself in exile. He was in
 Jilalabad for three days from 16 to 19th September to see the mood and
 to instruct his party men for the future strategy. It was an illegal
 entry to Afghanistan. Here is a special report on the present situation
 in Afghanistan based on his interview with Farooq Tariq taken at Lahore
 on 24th September. Farooq Tariq General secretary of the Labour Party
 Pakistan (see: www.labourpakistan.org)]



 * Talban has lost all support, they will loose power very soon
 * Asama has at least 25000 Islamic militants
 * Left and Right unite to support former King Zahir Shah,
 * Every one who has enough money for travel to Pakistan is leaving.

 I traveled to Afghanistan on 16th September and reached Jilalabad. The
 town was in absolute shock conditions. Everyone from there was talking
 to leave Afghanistan as soon as possible. To reach to Peshawar, you
 need at least 200,000 Afghanis ($2). Then you need another $5 to bribe
 the Pakistan official at the border to cross. So any one who has this
 amount is leaving. An average wage of an Afghani government clerk for
 instance at present is around 300,000 Afghanis ($3) per month. A daily
 worker in Jilalabad would get around Afghani 10,000 to 20,000 ($0.10
 to$0.20) per day. So there is tremendous poverty in all parts of
 Afghanistan. Wages are not normally paid up to 6 months. People are
 sick and tired of Talban regime. They can not say it openly but now are
 very sure the regime is going to go away. Most of the shops and the
 trading companies were closed in Jilalabad. No one wants to do any
 business in the city. It is more like a deserted city.

 On Talban military power

 There are around 20,000 military men at the disposal of Talban. They
 have lost their best friend Pakistan, so their military assistance is
 in trouble. On the contrary, there are over 25000 military men with
 Asama. They belong to China, Algeria, Nigeria and many other Arab
 countries apart from Pakistan. When Talban say they will not hand over
 Asama to Americans, it has nothing to do with their courage or their
 service to Islam, they are unable to hand him over as Asama has more
 Islamic militants than the Talbaan.

 On the Popularity of Talbaan

 They have lost support in absolute terms. The people I spoke in
 Jilalabad are openly against the Talban. I think it is only Talibs (the
 militant students) who support them. No one else support them in
 Afghanistan. They are the most unpopular regime in Afghanistan hi
 story. If American comes here they will loose power not so much of the
 attack but more because they have no social basis. It is not like the
 situation when Russians came to Afghanistan. There were a lot of people
 in Afghanistan opposing them. Also Americans and Pakistan was against
 them. But the situation is totally different. Talbaan can not fight
 with American for long time. They can not hide for long time.

 They are doomed to loose power. Talban are most vicious and brutal
 government of all time. We oppose them from the beginning. But American
 and Pakistan have supported them from the beginning. They say it today
 that Talban government is no good, we are saying it from the day first.
 Three trends within Talbaan There are three trends within the hierarchy
 of Talbaan regime. One is the most fundamentalist who are totally
 opposed to the handing Talbaan over to American. One big group is in
 favor of handing Asama to American. The third one is balancing the two
 groups. It is the third group, which has prevailed recently in its
 decision that Asama should leave voluntarily. The problem is that all
 the three groups are smaller than the army of Asama is. Asama is the
 real ruler of Afghanistan and not the Talbaan.

 On Northern Front

 There are mix people in the Northern Front. Abdul Rashid Dostum who
 heads Junbash Milli Islamia (Islamic National Movement) was a close
 ally of Babrak Karmal and Dr. Najib ullah, the former rulers of
 Afghanistan with the support of Russians. He is not fundamentalist and
 represents Uzbak and Turkmenistan people of Afghanistan. Another
 component party of Northern Front is the party of Professor Siaf, s
 Itehad Islami Afghanistan (Afghanistan Islamic Unity). This is the most
 fundamentalist party of the Front. Then there is Ahmed Shah party
 Shoora Nizaar (Islamic Association).

 The same people who did The 11th September event killed him on 9th
 September. Ahmed Shah Massod was killed because the people of Asama
 knew that he is the only capable person who can lead a resistance after
 the 11th September. He was supported by many Western powers already. He
 was a religious fanatic but recently ha had changed his position to
 right wing ideas. Hizb Wahdat Islami is another party, which is part of
 the Northern Alliance. NF is in full preparations to attack the
 Talbaan. There have been fights at Mazar Sharif after 11th September.
 80 Talbaan dead and 200 arrested. The fight is still going on so
 Talbaan can loose Mezar Sharif very soon.

 Ex general Doostam have got some Western support already and he is
 moving forward.

 On ex King Zahir Shah

 He is an 89-year-old ex king who seemed to get the support of all the
 parties in Afghanistan apart from Talbaan. The flag of Zahir Shah party
 Are seen every where in Peshawar at least. This black, Red and green
 color flags. Our party at this time supports him for a transitional
 period. The American plan is to hand him powers after the fall of
 Talbaan and then he can call elections in one-year time. But it clears
 that he will not be able to solve the problems of the people. There is
 a Persian saying that the "bad" is in power and there are some good
 coming out of it, it is not that bad. So we have no other choice apart
 from supporting him for a transitional period.

 On American military intervention

 We are totally opposed to American military intervention. But we are in
 favor of an immediate ending of Talbaan government. The situation is
 like this that American was bringing up a dog who has now gone mad. It
 is the responsibility of American to control or kill the mad dog. We
 will do our part to haunt down this mad dog which is dangerous for the
 Afghan people. Talbaan were supported indirectly or directly by the
 Americans and Pakistan in the hope of stabilizing Afghanistan but the
 situation has gone out of their control.

 On Shelter International This NGO was providing over bread to over 3
 million Afghanis. The Talbaan regime arrested them for no reasons. The
 food is gone. People are suffering now. This has even added to the
 misery of the people and more hatred against the Talbaan government.
 They wanted to control the NGO, s working in Afghanistan. This has not
 gone well among the normal Afghanis.

 Adil told that every one is sick and tired of Talbaan regime. They are
 sick of the war. There is lot people waiting for the end of this
 government. I do not see any possibility of Talbaan remaining in power
 for a longer time. American strategy is to bring Zahir Shah into power.
 He has already got the support of Northern Alliance and other Left and
 right parties. We are waiting for the day to go back to Afghanistan.

This was definitely a terrorist attack. let's call it
what it is- horrible shameful crime against humanity.
we owe that to the dead, at the very least.

Definitions

Terrorism by nature is difficult to define. Acts of
terrorism conjure emotional responses in the victims
(those hurt by the violence and those affected by the
fear) as well as in the practioners. Even the U.S.
government cannot agree on one single definition. The
old adage, "One man's terrorist is another man's
freedom fighter" is still alive and well. Listed below
are several definitions of terrorism. For the purposes
of the Terrorism Research Center, we have adopted the
definition used by the Federal Bureau of
Investigation.


Terrorism is the use or threatened use of force
designed to bring about political change.
--Brian Jenkins

Terrorism consitutes the illegitimate use of force to
achieve a political objective when innocent people are
targeted.
--Walter Laqueur

Terrorism is the premeditated, deliberate, systematic
murder, mayhem, and threatening of the innocent to
create fear and intimidation in order to gain a
political or tactical advantage, usually to influence
an audience.
--James M. Poland

Terrorism is the unlawful use or threat of violence
against persons or property to further political or
social objectives. It is usually intended to
intimidate or coerce a government, individuals or
groups, or to modify their behavior or politics.
--Vice-President's Task Force, 1986

Terrorism is the unlawful use of force or violence
against persons or property to intimidate or coerce a
government, the civilian population, or any segment
thereof, in furtherance of political or social
objectives.
--FBI Definition

Regarding Orwell, right now Dr. Laura and Rush Limbaugh are quoting the hell
out of him when he spoke out against the Pacifists during WWII.  It was
something along the lines of, "those peace activists are patently
pro-fascist".

They are both hammering down their listeners' ears the either/or mentality
of "if you're not with me, you're against me".  How does one intelligently
side-step that debate?

Binary thinking inherently discards anything that doesn't fit with the right
side of the equation, even if the debate tries to step outside the system
and show another way.

Dear Elizabeth,

I share your impulse to be flip about our President.  And I agree that
non-critical totality of the left is as dangerous a thing as the called-for
"unity" of the right.  Still I feel that critique of whatever sort needs to
be launched point by point if it is to mean anything, especially in this
context, stemming from specific disagreements with actions or positions
being taken, rather than from a drawn-out experience of generalized
resentment or lack of faith.  Besides, the university is changing and it
seems important to note the changes and keep abreast of its multifarious
efforts before flamboyance kicks in.  I have my moments of cynicism with
regard to the academy, but its institutions have provided me with the
richest sources of information regarding the current situation that I have
been able to find thus far.  This is maybe the most that one can hope for.
One such link that may be helpful to subscribers of this list, from the UCB
Institute of Slavic, East European and Eurasian Studies:

http://socrates.berkeley.edu/~iseees/9-11page.html.

The page points to sources of background information related to the attacks
of September 11.

I am disturbed that town-gown relations appear doomed from certain
perspectives.  I have not personally found this to be the case.  At any
rate, I am co-organizing a series of paired readings and colloquia to be
held at the Berkeley Center for Writers during the spring, to be funded
partially by UC Berkeley's Townsend Center for the Humanities; its aim, in
the words of our initial proposal, is to "converge on contemporary poetics
and to provide a permeable membrane between the UCB and local writing
communities."  Our first event will feature Lyn Hejinian and Leslie
Scalapino and will be held on February 15; I will post the relevant details
to this list once the date approaches.

Dear J.,
Thank you for your reply. I am aware of most of what you mention that is
happening at UCB. I agree that my characterization was a bit flamboyant and
flip. I do have respect for what is happening amongst some of the students
at Cal; however that is tempered by both my experience as a student there
and more by my experience as a citizen of Berkeley since birth. There are
ways in which the student and academic populations overwhelm the town and
these aggrieve me at times (I realize the economic "boon" the univ brings
and parts of the cultural, tho I wouldn't give as much credit as is given by
some). Also I recall the snippy egomania of such movements I was
peripherally involved in as a student there. So, I was flip, much the same
way I've been flip about our President.
I do not agree if I take your meaning correctly that the Left shouldn't
critique its own. Such critique can come in many forms. However I agree this
doesn't seem to be the place for such. But then, where is, these days.

Hi folks,

I have a good friend Katherine Steele who needs to find a place to live in
NYC fairly immediately.  She's been in the Peace Corps for 2 years and the
Govt just airlifted her, in essence, out of Kyrgystan.  She's a terrific
person, a fine poet, nice as hell.  Backchannel me if you know of anyone
looking for a roomate. etc.  Thanks!

Like so many others, I have been unsure how to
respond, as poet/artist, to the destruction that hit
New York City this September 11th.

And then it occured to me: perhaps I already had, over
thirty-five years ago, around the age of eight years
old.

See:

http://www.geocities.com/jeffreyjullich/peacefulcityindex.html

Some of my earliest childhood drawings, still extant
(circa 1964), were set in a futuristic city. And that
boyhood fantasy of space age architecture came to a
sorry end: walls falling, tall structures tipping
over, mayhem.

The skies were filled (or will be filled?) with
hovercraft, steam-propelled hot air balloon-type
zepellin-ish flying machines, air buses and airborne
"DANGER" signs, floating "STOP" signs, clam-shaped sky
gondolas. Pedestrians go from building to building in
transparent tubular walkway crossbridges high above
the ground traffic below. Radar dishs (that resemble
currentday television satellite dishes) on the roofs
of skyscrapers, water towers on roofs.

Modeled, I suspect, after a World's Fair "City of the
Future" exhibition I visited with my parents. For some
reason --- influence of a Zsa Zsa Gabor "Queen of
Outer
Space" movie, early morning Buck Rogers re-runs, and
that land of the pharaohs movie where the stone slabs
of the pyramid slide in place sealing the royal court
inside --- the poor, pretty futuristic city comes
tumbling down to an apocalyptic end. Buildings
collapse, fires combust, the "RRRRRRRRR!" of a siren,
attempts at missile defense from the top of cannon
towers plop pathetically downward, duds (meteors
["satalites"! (sic)]).

Children's drawings. Long ago. All come tumbling down.
The future. Utopias.

A distinctly eerie feeling as I read (forgive me if someone's pointed
this out already) in Rasula & McCaffery's great anthology, Imagining
Language--p.398 (on the Arab Mystical Alphabet) about the letter lam (no
way to do accents here, sorry): "Its day is Tuesday...This sphere is the
locus of manifestation of Divine grandeur and revenge. The worship of
the angels of this sphere is to bring distant things near, to make the
invisible visible, to entrench faith in the heart, to defend the world
of mysteries against the infidels, and [they are further occupied with]
revenge, blaming, and pressing the souls. Its spirituality is that power
that helps and strengthens those who wield the sword and take revenge."
I'm glad that--against the too easy alliterative titles given by the
media and the current administration--we are struggling with what
language's role might be, but it's clearly a mistake to only examine our
own....

I can report that our commander-in-chief is calm and will not ask for a precipitous "outright" declaration of war against the Japanese, but instead leans toward a general consensus to "hunt down the perpetrators" of this act of "infamy." Speaking for the Congress, Senator Arthur Vandenberg promised bipartisan support to "bring to justice" the Japanese pilots. Many believe that the "rogue" airmen may well have flown from Japanese warships. In response, Secretary of War Stimson is calling for "an international coalition to indict these cowardly purveyors of death," and will shortly ask the Japanese imperial government to hand over 
 the suspected airman from the <I>Akagi</I> and <I>Kaga</I> — "and any more of these cruel fanatics who took off from ships involved in this dastardly act." Assistant Secretary Robert Patterson was said to have remarked, "Stimson is madder than hell — poor old Admiral Yamamato has a lot of explaining to do." </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size=3>Secretary of State Cordell Hull, however, this morning cautioned the nation about such "jingoism." He warned, "The last thing we want is another <I>Maine</I> or <I>Lusitania</I>. We wouldn't want to start something like a Second World War and ruin the real progress in Japanese-American relations over the last few years." Hull himself is preparing for a long tour to consult our allies in South America, Africa, and colonial France: "If we get the world on board, and make them understand that this is not merely an aggressive act upon us, much less just an American problem, such a solid front may well deter further Japanese action." </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size=3>Even as Hull prepares to depart, special envoy Harry Hopkins is calling for a general statement of concern from the League of Nations, condemning not only the most recent Japanese aggression, but also an earlier reported incident in Nanking, China. "If we can get an expression of outrage from the League, Japan may well find itself in an interesting pickle. We're looking for some strong League action of the type that followed the banditry in Ethiopia and Finland." Hopkins finished by emphasizing the rather limited nature of the one-day Pearl Harbor incursion, and suggesting such piecemeal attacks were themselves a direct result of past American restraint. "We did not rattle our sabers when they went into China. Had we listened to the alarmists then, we might well be seeing Japanese anger manifesting itself from the Philippines to Wake Island in the coming days."</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size=3>Secretary of the Treasury Henry Morgenthau, Jr., a few hours ago reminded the nation of the current disturbing economic news. "Four million Americans are still out of work. Americans are not out of this Depression by any means. Are we to borrow money to build planes that we don't even know will fly?" The industrialist Henry Kaiser was no more optimistic: "There is simply no liquidity in these markets. We shouldn't even be considering rearming. It is not as if we are going to build a ship a day. Even launching a carrier every couple of years could put us back to 1932."</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size=3>Military leaders, smarting over yesterday's losses, were no more ready for war. Even the usually colorful Admiral Halsey sounded a note of concern to this reporter, "Look, they have all the cards, not us. The bastards over there could give us a decade of war at least. Where do I get bases for my subs and flattops? Who gives me strips for the flyboys? This could be a new war with no rules. Believe me, brother, we ain't going to Midway or some place like that in six months and cut down to size the whole damn imperial fleet. It's just not going to happen." Admiral King was nearly as blunt, "Hell's bells, no one has ever conquered Japan since they kicked the Portuguese out. Do the American people really want to go over to that part of the world and fight those samurai madmen? The logistics are impossible. These people have been at war for years. I've seen these Zeros — you put a suicide basket case with a wish to die for the em
 peror in with a tank of gas, and you've got a guided rocket that will blow our ships out of the water." Colonel James Doolittle was even more cautious than the top brass when told of calls for potential early American counterattacks. "Swell — the last thing we need is to send in some hot-dogger to drop a few bombs for the press boys that cause no real damage and get our fellas killed in the bargain." </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size=3>On the home front, prominent voices in the arts expressed far stronger reservations about possible American "revenge". Robert Maynard Hutchins of the University of Chicago explained to me that the Pearl Harbor incident cannot be separated from its larger cultural context. "We must guard against this absurd and ongoing moral absolutism on the part of the United States in seeing complex cultural differences in black and white terms of the Occident and the Orient. We have no monopoly on morality or justice." His colleague, Mortimer J. Adler, elaborated: "Far too often we look at the world through Western lenses. But in Japanese eyes, this rather desperate attack is seen as a "slap", a lashing out of sorts to get the attention of the United States, really more of a desperate cry of the heart than anything else." Adler went on, "Japan has had a tradition of isolation from and distrust of Western civilization — rightly so in some
  respects, given everything from past European missionaries to racism, economic exploitation, and colonialism. If we inflame passions, they may well simply divorce themselves from the world community — or worse, set off a conflagration of pan-Asian hatred toward Occidentals that could last for generations. It seems to me Pearl Harbor is rather more of a case of Admiral Perry's chickens at long last coming home to roost." </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size=3>Contacted at home, the noted naval historian Samuel Eliot Morison was pessimistic about the strategy involved in any U.S. response: "Good God, do they want us to fight the entire world — Germany, Italy, Hungry, Bulgaria, Romania, and now Japan? We lose 2,400 sailors — less than an annual poliomyelitis outbreak — and then we start a World War II? I find these calls for mindless retaliation not only naïve, but disturbing as well in their failure to take account of America's strategic impotence. That's a part of the world we know very little about."</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size=3>Prominent American clergymen blasted the very idea of armed retaliation, calling instead for interfaith services and greater tolerance of Japanese religious beliefs. Cardinal Cushing warned against castigating the entire Japanese people for the actions of a few fanatics, adding that "Bushido, is, in fact, merely a variant of Shintoism, itself an age-old and misunderstood faith that is as humane as anything in Christian teaching." Cushing added, "There is nothing in Bushido, much less Shintoism that is inherently bellicose or at all anti-Western. These few extremists are hardly representative of either public or religious opinion in Japan." Cushing concluded, "The Emperor himself is a pacifist, a Zen scholar in fact deeply devoted to entomology, with no interest at all in bloodshed. And so the better question might be posed: 'Why does so much of Asia hate us?'" </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size=3>Celebrated director John Ford reflected Hollywood's unease with the early rumors of war. "Hell, we are artists, not mouthpieces. What are we to do — join the Navy to make movies on government spec? Had we had more Japanese films available to the American people in the first place, we wouldn't have had this misunderstanding." A few Hollywood stars who were willing to speak on the record agreed. Jimmy Stewart called for a world conference of concerned actors and screenwriters. "There have been some great Japanese movies. We need to reach out to our brother actors over there. The last thing we need is a bunch of us would-be pilots storming over to Burbank to enlist." Clark Gable was adamant in his belief in keeping America from doing something "stupid," as he put it. "If you haven't heard lately: We're actors, artists really, not war-mongers. I'm sure that our Japanese counterparts feel the same way. We need to put away the B-
 17s and get the cameras rolling on both sides." <BR><BR>Celebrated veterans were especially angered about knee-jerk American anger. Alvin C. York, Medal of Honor winner and hero of the Great War, was reported as "madder than hell" at the "war scare." "We shouldn't fight in some jungle island just because the Japanese hate old man Rockefeller as much as we do." </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size=3>In an in-depth newsmaker interview, 81-year-old General John J. Pershing told Henry Luce of <I>Time</I> magazine, "I've made war before — long and hard. I've seen it. These sunshine sluggers talk a great game, but wait until our dead pile up. No, it is time to collect our thoughts and think like adults for a change. Lashing back is just what these extremists want us to do. If a war breaks out, then their mission is accomplished. I'd hate to see us playing into the hands of a few militarists who want to topple the moderates and the emperor. This ocean war with carriers is an entirely new challenge, nothing like we have ever seen before. Why get our boys killed only to make a few samurai martyrs?"</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size=3>And so it is with confidence today that this reporter assures the American people and the world that sobriety, maturity, and prudence — not bombs — are the watchwords on the home front. Remember — our enemies can only win if they make us answer their violence with more needless violence. </FONT></P>

from Allison Cobb in NYC:
I appreciate Ron Silliman's insightful posts to the list of late.  Regarding finding ways to reference the terrorist attacks:  I just came out of a meeting where someone from a PR firm referred to that day as 9-1-1.  This reference rankled me, on reflection I think because it represents a clever "catch phrase," a way of reducing the events to the same kind of soundbite the networks are using.  The pun at the same time carries some attraction because I have the moment of  "getting it."  But I am also repulsed because this is not something I merely want to "get."

Another thing that has been bothering me is the reference to the area destroyed in NYC as "ground zero."  I think because ground zero has been used to refer to other significant sites of destruction in history -- most notably the sites of the first atomic bombings.  Referring to the former WTC and environs as "ground zero" seems to reduce all those events to a single generic understanding and gut each of its particular terrible meaning.

Also I've been thinking about the word "terrorist" itself -- which according to the Webster's I have at work, which has lame etymologies, comes specifically from "an agent or supporter of the revolutionary tribunal during the French Reign of Terror." Others have more insight on that etymology?

I'd like to direct folks to a photo book called Downtown Paterson by June
Avigonne (Arcadia,pb). June is a Paterson poet/fiction writer and gives a
fairly straight look at the city. I went to college outside of the city and,
from my hometown in Hoboken, the commuter train puts you in downtown in 30
minutes.

The terrorists resided in Paterson and Jersey City simply because of the
large Islamic populations that provide a ceratin annonmynity & access to
things like Hallel foods, etc.

Paterson was already on the skids wjen Williams began paterson (the decline
began in the wake of the 1913 Silk Strike) and the slide goes on, but it
still retains much of the fascinating texture that WCW saw as head ob-gyn at
Paterson general. I've taken Ted Berrigan, Anslem Hollo, Alice Notley, Ken
Ewards & other poets to see the wonderful Great Falls (no longer smelling of
chemicals). Ina ddition Maria Gillan has been running a poetry center atthe
community college that has brought poets ranging from Maya Angelou to Hayden
Carruth.

Certainly worth a visit

I suppose it's a little embarassing to admit but I watched a bit of Oprah
last week. Perhaps more people saw this show than saw Bush's Thursday
speech. I hope so. She had on a bunch of women, the ones I saw were Gloria
Steinem, Barbara Lee, Eve Ensler, Peggy Noonan, Madeline Albright, Maya
Angelou and Marianne Williamson. Now I don't have absolute devotion to the
views of any of them, obviously. However Oprah did such a fantastic job of
getting all of them to speak, and when one might go into territory that
would offend part of the audience, she brought em back round to language
that could be understood by all present. It was amazing to see this chorus
of voices and experiences of women. I hate to beat an undead horse, but it
has been so undeniably clear how much more public voice men have in the last
weeks.
Also the show was really encouraging the US to examine itself, in a very
thoughtful and open way -- so that no group would feel excluded (except the
large group that might be appalled that I watched daytime TV).
I think Ms Winfrey does important cultural work then. And I think she would
be a good president. So I'm nominating her. She knows how to work the media
angle, of course, but she's a person of more conviction than I've seen in
the White House since I've been born.
And Madonna could be her VP -- I liked her comment about how each of us must
examine the terrorism within ourselves.
I know this might sound corny, but we've got to work with what we've got.
Cornflakily yours

correct our perspective -- U.S. and U.K. are not without violence,
demagoguery, what have you, but the Taliban is a totally different beast --

I was one of the Taliban's torturers: I crucified people
(Filed: 30/09/2001)

<<In an astonishing interview with Christina Lamb, the Afghan leader's
former bodyguard reveals the full brutality of the fundamentalist regime
sheltering Osama bin Laden>>


"YOU must become so notorious for bad things that when you come into an area
people will tremble in their sandals. Anyone can do beatings and starve
people. I want your unit to find new ways of torture so terrible that the
screams will frighten even crows from their nests and if the person survives
he will never again have a night's sleep."

These were the instructions of the commandant of the Afghan secret police to
his new recruits. For more than three years one of those recruits, Hafiz
Sadiqulla Hassani, ruthlessly carried out his orders. But sickened by the
atrocities that he was forced to commit, last week he defected to Pakistan,
joining a growing number of Taliban officials who are escaping across the
border.

In an exclusive interview with The Telegraph, he reveals for the first time
the full horror of what has been happening in the name of religion in
Afghanistan. Mr Hassani has the pinched face and restless hands of a man
whose night hours are as haunted as any of his victims. Now aged 30, he does
not, however, fit the militant Islamic stereotype usually associated with
the Taliban.

Married with a wife and one-year-old daughter, he holds a degree in business
studies, having been educated in Pakistan, where he grew up as a refugee
while his father and elder brothers fought in the jihad against the
Russians. His family was well off, owning land and property in Kandahar to
which they returned after the war.

"Like many people, I did not become a Talib by choice," he explained. "In
early 1998 I was working as an accountant here in Quetta when I heard that
my grandfather - who was 85 - had been arrested by the Taliban in Kandahar
and was being badly beaten. They would only release him if he provided a
member of his family as a conscript, so I had to go."

Mr Hassani at first was impressed by the Taliban. "It had been a crazy
situation after the Russians left, the country was divided by warring groups
all fighting each other. In Kandahar warlords were selling everything,
kidnapping young girls and boys, robbing people, and the Taliban seemed like
good people who brought law and order."

So he became a Taliban "volunteer", assigned to the secret police. Many of
his friends also joined up as land owners in Kandahar were threatened that
they must either ally themselves with the Taliban or lose their property.
Others were bribed to join with money given to the Taliban by drug
smugglers, as Afghanistan became the world's largest producer of heroin.

At first, Mr Hassani's job was to patrol the streets at night looking for
thieves and signs of subversion. However, as the Taliban leadership began
issuing more and more extreme edicts, his duties changed.

Instead of just searching for criminals, the night patrols were instructed
to seek out people watching videos, playing cards or, bizarrely, keeping
caged birds. Men without long enough beards were to be arrested, as was any
woman who dared venture outside her house. Even owning a kite became a
criminal offence.

The state of terror spread by the Taliban was so pervasive that it began to
seem as if the whole country was spying on each other. "As we drove around
at night with our guns, local people would come to us and say there's
someone watching a video in this house or some men playing cards in that
house," he said.

"Basically any form of pleasure was outlawed," Mr Hassani said, "and if we
found people doing any of these things we would beat them with staves soaked
in water - like a knife cutting through meat - until the room ran with their
blood or their spines snapped. Then we would leave them with no food or
water in rooms filled with insects until they died.

"We always tried to do different things: we would put some of them standing
on their heads to sleep, hang others upside down with their legs tied
together. We would stretch the arms out of others and nail them to posts
like crucifixions.

"Sometimes we would throw bread to them to make them crawl. Then I would
write the report to our commanding officer so he could see how innovative we
had been."

Here, sitting in the stillness of an orchard in Quetta sipping tea as the
sun goes down, he finds it hard to explain how he could have done such
things. "We Afghans have grown too used to violence," is all he can offer.
"We have lost 1.5 million people. All of us have brothers and fathers up
there."

After Kandahar, he was put in charge of secret police cells in the towns of
Ghazni and then Herat, a beautiful Persian city in western Afghanistan that
had suffered greatly during the Soviet occupation and had been one of the
last places to fall to the Taliban.

Herat had always been a relatively liberal place where women would dance at
weddings and many girls went to school - but the Taliban were determined to
put an end to all that. Mr Hassani and his men were told to be particularly
cruel to Heratis.

It was his experience of that cruelty that made Mr Hassani determined to let
the world know what was happening in Afghanistan. "Maybe the worst thing I
saw," he said, "was a man beaten so much, such a pulp of skin and blood,
that it was impossible to tell whether he had clothes on or not. Every time
he fell unconscious, we rubbed salt into his wounds to make him scream.

"Nowhere else in the world has such barbarity and cruelty as in Afghanistan.
At that time I swore an oath that I will devote myself to the Afghan people
and telling the world what is happening."

Before he could escape, however, because he comes from the same tribe, he
spent time as a bodyguard for Mullah Omar, the reclusive spiritual leader of
the Taliban.

"He's medium height, slightly fat, with an artificial green eye which
doesn't move, and he would sit on a bed issuing instructions and giving
people dollars from a tin trunk," said Mr Hassani. "He doesn't say much,
which is just as well as he's a very stupid man. He knows only how to write
his name `Omar' and sign it.

"It is the first time in Afghanistan's history that the lower classes are
governing and by force. There are no educated people in this administration
- they are all totally backward and illiterate.

"They have no idea of the history of the country and although they call
themselves mullahs they have no idea of Islam. Nowhere does it say men must
have beards or women cannot be educated; in fact, the Koran says people must
seek education."

He became convinced that the Taliban were not really in control. "We laughed
when we heard the Americans asking Mullah Omar to hand over Osama bin
Laden," he said. "The Americans are crazy. It is Osama bin Laden who can
hand over Mullah Omar - not the other way round."

While stationed in Kandahar, he often saw bin Laden in a convoy of Toyota
Land Cruisers all with darkened windows and festooned with radio antennae.
"They would whizz through the town, seven or eight cars at a time. His
guards were all Arabs and very tall people, or Sudanese with curly hair."

He was also on guard once when bin Laden joined Mullah Omar for a bird shoot
on his estate. "They seemed to get on well," he said. "They would go fishing
together, too - with hand grenades."

The Arabs, according to Mr Hassani, have taken de facto control of his
country. "All the important places of Kandahar are now under Arab control -
the airport, the military courts, the tank command."

Twice he attended Taliban training camps and on both occasions they were run
by Arabs as well as Pakistanis. "The first one I went to lasted 10 days in
the Yellow Desert in Helmand province, a place where the Saudi princes used
to hunt, so it has its own airport.

It was incredibly well guarded and there were many Pakistanis there, both
students from religious schools and military instructors. The Taliban is
full of Pakistanis."

He was told that if he died while fighting under the white flag of the
Taliban, he and his family would go to paradise. The soldiers were given
blank marriage certificates signed by a mullah and were encouraged to "take
wives" during battle, basically a licence to rape.

When Mr Hassani was sent to the front line in Bagram, north of Kabul, a few
months ago, he saw a chance to escape. "Our line was attacked by the
Northern Alliance and they almost defeated us. Many of my friends were
killed and we didn't know who was fighting who; there was killing from
behind and in front. Our commanders fled in cars leaving us behind.

"We left, running all night but then came to a line of Arabs who arrested us
and took us back to the front line. One night last month I was on watch and
saw a truck full of sheep and goats, so I jumped in and escaped.

"I got back to Kandahar but Taliban spies saw me and I was arrested and
interrogated. Luckily I have relatives who are high ranking Taliban members
so they helped me get out and eventually I escaped to Quetta to my wife and
daughter.

"I think many in the Taliban would like to escape. The country is starving
and joining is the only way to get food and keep your land. Otherwise there
is a lot of hatred. I hate both what it does and what it turned me into."

 TISH,  the Vancouver poetry newsletter. Please forgive double-postings, but
this  will be the final posting on this matter. We hope you will attend any
or
 all of these events.

 The main Writers Festival event will take place at

 Fraser University.

 The Simon Fraser Special Collections Library is open weekdays 10:00 AM
 to  4:30 PM.

 Parallel with these events, a series of talks and discussions has been
 organized to take place at Simon Fraser Harbour Centre and at Capilano
 College on October 18th and 19th, featuring some of the TISH writers and
 writers from the magazine filling station and the Kootenay school of
 Writing, students and teachers from at least two different generations
 will  be commenting on the role of poetry in the current world. The program
 and schedule of these events appears below.

 The public is warmly invited to attend and participate in all of these
events.

 The following is the text of the brochure detailing the events of the
 talks and discussions mentioned above.

 AN INVITATION

 In September 1961, five young poets and their friends, working under the
 mentorship of UBC English professor Warren Tallman in Vancouver, British
 Columbia, launched TISH, their anagramatically-named mimeo poetry
 magazine.
 In doing so, they became active participants in the expanding trend of
 underground poetry publication in North America. TISH continued to be
 produced through three different editorial boards from 1961 to 1969, and
 many of its participants remain active and respected members of the
 Canadian literary community today. The network which the TISH poets
 entered has grown widely in the intervening years and is now extended
throughout
 the English-speaking world.

 Although TISH was resolutely local in orientation and demotic in
 language and concern, it never became an inward-looking movement. The very
 premise of its existence was the need to establish connection between
Vancouver,
 the site of its production, and the wider world. The extensive and
long-lasting inter-personal and global connections enjoyed by the poets of
the TISH movement, as much as their continued productivity as poets,
 writers, teachers and publishers, speaks of the variety and depth of their
literary and social concerns.

 Even if TISH was always open to strong innovative influences by forces
 and movements outside of the local and the national, the fundamental
premise of
 the activity of its members has always been "if it doesn't happen here, it
 doesn't happen anywhere." Their main concern was never directed toward
 the passive consumption and imitation of literature and culture produced in
 the centres of world finance and culture in New York, London or Hollywood.
 The members of the TISH movement sought to open the ground for the active
 production of a literature responding to local concerns and demands, but
 also by choice and by inclination, outside the imperatives of the
 globalizing centres of hegemonic economic and cultural power.

 The 40th anniversary of TISH as a magazine/newsletter/workshop of poetry
 is being celebrated on October 20th at the Vancouver International Writers
 Festival this year. Parallel with this event, a series of talks and
discussions will be held at Simon Fraser Harbour Centre and at Capilano
College, featuring presentations of different kinds from the poets,
 publishers and teachers of  at least two generations. The poets of TISH,
including two Governor General's Award winners, poets of the Calgary based
literary magazine filling station, and the locally-based Kootenay School of
Writing and other writers, teachers and students of literature will join
together to discuss the present and future role of poetry in the
globalized/electronicised world.

 The events below are free of charge, and the public is warmly invited.

 "While it is not possible to get outside of one's contemporary cultural
 formation any more than it is possible to get outside of culture, it
 should be possible to contest, dilute, hybridize or fracture that formation
 without undue hindrance from 'arms length' arts institutions. Global
 capitalism consistently intrudes on the work small journals like Open
 Letter do."

              Understanding victims of misunderstanding

           Beneath the rubble victims of misunderstanding

              Things to think we like to think about

               Aware right there there right there

                      Whatever issues out

             As soon as aware issues stop right there




              Objections arise before we even hear

          The other side of it & that & they are dumb

               So let it go as go away it will

               To see through & to listen too

                  To see clear is fair to

                Victims of misunderstanding

Maimonides, The Guide of the Perplexed, from I:21:


_To pass ['abor]._ The first meaning of this term is that of passage in
Arabic; and the first instances of its being used as concerned with the
movements of living beings over a certain distance in a straight line.
Thus: _And he passed over them; Pass before the people._ Such instances
are numerous. Subsequently the word was used figuratively to signify the
propagation of sounds in the air. Thus: _And they caused a voice to pass
throughout the camp; Which I hear the Lord's people cause to pass._
Afterwards the word was figuratively used to signify the descent of the
light and of the Indwelling seen by the prophets _in the vision of
prophecy._ Thus it says: _And behold a smoking furnace and a flaming torch
that passed between these pieces._ This happened _in a vision of
prophecy._ For it says at the beginning of the story: _And a deep sleep
fell upon Abram, and so on._

[...]

[In regard to Moses] Or you may believe that there was, in addition to
this intellectual apprehension, an apprehension due to the sense of sight,
which, however, had for its object a created thing, through seeing which
the perfection of intellectual apprehension might be achieved. This would
be the interpretation of this passage by Onqelos, unless one assumes that
this ocular apprehension also occurred in _the vision of prophecy,_ as is
stated with regard to _Abraham: Behold a smoking furnace and a flaming
torch that passed._ Or again you may believe that there was in addition an
apprehension due to the sense of hearing; that which _passed by before his
face_ being the _voice,_ which is likewise indubitably a created thing.

(Pines translation.)

All embodiment, I say, is of the fiction, less a thing than a container of
the Indwelling, and such embodiment is less an entity than a device formed
by the proper name, Abram, Abraham, Avram, Avraham. And such is of the
emanation or virtual nature and condition of the world, that we may take
solace in the plasma, not in the granite; that we may comprehend the sun,
not the palest of shadows; that we may step beyond the cave which has
saved us, in order to write these texts and prophecies; that beyond the
cave there is yet another cave and another cave; that the Indwelling is
within them all.

Hi, everyone.

I have been in touch with an editor who is putting
together a research book on contemporary women poets
and had a last minute drop-out from the person who was
supposed to write about Susan Howe.  If any of you are
interested in filling in, that would be most
appreciated.  The essay will need to be 1800-2300
words long and is due by the end of the month.  I had
hoped to fill in, but don't think I can meet the
deadline.

If interested, please contact Catherine Cucinella at
Catcuch@aol.com.

Thanks,
Arielle

Sorry to keep bothering the list with newsies, but I don't know if anyone
saw this from Sunday's NYTBR --


"The writing of poetry is regularly deemed a dead art, so it is little
wonder that its living practitioners are a somewhat petty and xenophobic
bunch -- or that the enterprise itself has come to seem, except in the hands
of a few populist types like Sharon Olds, Philip Levine and Billy Collins,
almost willfully insular. 'Contemporary poets,' noted the Polish poet
Wislawa Szymborska in her 1996 Nobel acceptance speech 'are skeptical and
suspicious even, or perhaps especially, about themselves.' One can hardly
blame them, of course, seeing as how most people return the compliment by
avoiding the stuff altogether."


The whole review may be found here:

I'll write something original, someday, I promise,
Aaron

Chris,
    I'm attaching a working draft of an article I am writing for ASAP, which
is a new APA online peer reviewed journal.  It's pretty academic because of
the audience.  I'm not sure what your thoughts are about using POETICS this
way.

Poetic Language and Actions in Crisis

=93Literary images serve more than merely as a means of
expressing ideas or of translating the pleasures of sensory=20
experience coherently into language but possess certain
immediate powers of their own (Bachelard, 1990, p. 11).=94 =20


     Psychological research has begun developing empirical insights into =
how poetic language operates.  As early as the time of Homer poetry was =
seen as having a special role in traumatic times, tragedy, war, and =
health and illness. Now empirical research is starting to untangle some =
strands  of language and develop some insights into how and why they =
work.  This paper will describe some of the parameters of what is known =
and apply them to poetic actions that might help during this period of =
crisis and turmoil.=20
     Even though we poets may be loathe to admit it, poetry is nothing =
more than a style of writing, but this style is a mode of thought and =
enaction and as such is a complex and resplendent being which includes =
poetic imagery, poetic language, and poetic enaction - the action of =
writing poetry.  =20
     Poetry communicates metaphorically.  It was banished for this from  =


Plato=91s Republic.  Maybe it should be allowed back in now as it is =
time=20

for revision of the metaphors that may have led us to this juncture. =20

One metaphoric route is through directions opened up by George=20

Lakoff and Mark Johnson  (Lakoff, 1991; Lakoff & Johnson, 1980). =20

Gibbs (Gibbs, 1994) has done some work on poetic metaphor.  Other=20

metaphoric routes have been taken in recent social (Simon &=20

Klandermans, 2001) and cross-cultural (Hermans & Kempen, 1998)=20

psychology.  This is too complex an area for adequate coverage.  The=20

focus will be on recent research that bears on poetic language and how=20

this bears on poetic actions (the actual writing of poetry) or poetics.  =
=20

     Poetics is a large field that includes the poetic process itself =
(e.g.,=20

Padgett, 2000), poetics or thinking about how you do it (e.g.=20

Bernstein, 1999), and philosophical approaches (e.g., Bachelard,=20

1990) and here I want to focus on the narrow aspect of poetics=20

concerned with enactment. There are at least three strands in recent=20

research which can be  distinguished although they are intertwined.  =20

These strands are language=92s as Working Memory (WM), its role in=20

health and trauma resolution, and its role in speaking poetically=20

in interpersonal and internet communication.  =20

Working Memory

     Even though to many, poets are scribblers hiding in garrets, poetry =


is a social activity.  Writing something down is an activity that takes=20

place in a space or an =93object=94 between writer and reader, one  that =


can function sequentially or interchangeably as working memory, a=20

mirror, transitional object (Winnicott, 1971), diary for disclosure or=20

secrets, =91words on paper,=91 etc.  While these are terms from diverse=20

areas of knowledge, the analogy is plausible.

     WM is a limited capacity system (Pennington, 1994), not to be=20

confused with short-term memory which has some executive functions

for tasks like attention and controlled processing.  Among other things. =


Klein & Boals (2001) found that =93expressive writing reduces intrusive=20

and avoidant thinking about a stressful event, thus freeing WM=20

resources.=94 for other tasks.

Health and Trauma Resolution    =20

     We are starting to gain insight into how thoughts and feelings are=20

written in this space and how specifically this writing affects health, =
the=20

immune system, and many other areas of functioning.  Klein & Boals=20

(2001), Pennebaker (1997) and Smyth (1998) are some recent=20

overviews of the complexities of current research on this aspect of=20

writing.=20

     There is an ever-growing body of research on therapeutic writing =
loosely based on Pennebaker=92s (Pennebaker, 1997) disclosure paradigm =
along with the developing Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count methodology =
(Pennebaker, J. W., Francis, M. E., & Booth, R. C., 2001; Pennebaker & =
King, 1999). =20
    It is important that this disclosure writing be =92emotional=92 with =


cognitive processing (either by the discloser or a therapeutic =
listener).=20

This disclosure should ideally occur in a safe place with provisions=20

for appropriate resolution of the material (Pennebaker, 1997).  =20

Speaking Poetically=20

     Poetic speech is often linked with musicality or making pleasant.  =
While the poetry I often read and write is often discordant, the =
psychoaesthetics (Franklin, 2001) of positive emotions, pleasantness, =
humor, and euphony, when analyzed in their specifics, do have =
connections to coping (Folkman & Moskowitz, 2000), health (Salovey,  =
Detweiler, Steward, & RothmanTaylor, 2000; Kemeny, Bower, Gruenewald, & =
Reed, 2000), and the immune system (Miller & Cohen, 2001).  Although =
research reviews  (Martin, 2001; Miller & Cohen, 2001) do tend to show =
only modest evidence for support for simple pleasant - health ideas, =
conceptually informed and methodologically sound research shows promise =
of yielding specific results.  In addition more rigorously =
conceptualized research programs are promising, like Vaillant=92s =
adaptive mental mechanisms (Vaillant, 2000) and the broaden-and-build =
model of positive emotions (Fredrickson, 2001) in which positive leads =
to positive in many areas, including the interpersonal and political. =20
Internet Lab in Action - Enactment in Real Time.
     An internet mailing listserv and exchanges of emails on it =
following the tragedy (what to actually call the September 11, 2001 =
=91event=92 and its sequellae is one important question facing the =
nation and international media. This question as language and image was =
actually discussed on this particular list) provides some insights into =
poetic language, poetic imagery, and poets=92 expression of their =
feelings in real time.  This particular list does have some =
distinguishing characteristics due to it=92s history and the =
international, =92experimental=92 character of it=92s subscribers, but =
this capability of definition makes it a laboratory for psychological =
investigation as well as an historical document of response by poets, =
mailing lists, the college-educated public, etc., to the =92event=92.=20
     After the =91event=92 there was a period of silence and then some =
emails enquiring about the well-being of friends.  Then a poet posted a =
message simply describing the particulars of his feelings and =
observations.  Even though in plain language this was a =93poem=94 that =
seemed to loosen the floodgates as it was followed by several others =
even though there were list members unable to write anything for awhile. =
 Thee is a discussion of a transitional object or symbol of the event =
and how this transitional object is and will affect future thought and =
actions.  In this instance WM is being analyzed as it poetically enacts =
history.
       =20
Dear Poetix People, On another list there's been a discussion about why =
poets are expected to soothe, honor, grieve, whatever, be turned to in =
the time of need and expected to produce a something out of this while =
folks in other mediums are not. (I'm not sure this is true!) And that =
it's a bit insulting when we're and our medium is usually, generally not =
all that respected. What do you think?

Christopher W. Alexander, you are clearly the poster boy for political
correctness. On the one hand you lament being thought of as a censor when
you do, in fact, censor. And on the other hand-- when you on rare occassion
let something through that offends the closed mindedness of your audience,
you apologize for it. This is such a narrow view that it can't even be
characterized as two sides of the same coin.

Booksmith<--Bookcellar, in a bit of
last minute finagling, proudly presents

NEPOTISM NIGHT: CO-CURATORS-->READERS

Jim Behrle, Sean Cole and Aaron Kiely read their poems,
very likely in that order.

Saturday 10/6 at 7 PM
Brookline Booksmith
279 Harvard St.
Brookline, MA 02446

Jim Behrle edits can we have our ball back? and co-edits
PRESSED WAFER.  His first chapbook, CITY POINT (Pressed Wafer)
was published in 2000.  Behrle is the events director for Brookline
Booksmith and co-curates Bookcellar-->Booksmith Poetry readings.
He serves as roving poet for NPR's "Here & Now."  Behrle lives in
Brookline, MA.  He watches TV and drinks RC Cola.  The world's
a mess; it's in his kiss. Won't you please, please, help me, etc.

Sean Cole produces radio stories at WBUR-FM in Boston. Poems
of his appeared in the first issue of the magazine "DAD" and, most
recently, the first issue of "Pom-Pom." His work also appears in
perpetuity, on-line, at "Shampoo Poetry dot com,"  the mysterious
"Can we have our ball back dot com" and "The East Village dot
org." But then, if you're like him, you already know all of this.

Aaron Kiely wrote "Breaks Other", "Fun Greatest Simple", "My Money",
"Ya-Don't-Stop", "I'm Here" and "John Cougar". He got his BA in
Composition from Needham High School in Needham, MA.
He lives in New York City and currently plays in the band Slipknot.
Paisley Park is in your heart.

~~This may be your chance to hear these fine fellas in 2001.~~

If you make it, that would be great.

Keith Waldrop and Allison Bundy
will be rescheduled ASAP.

OK -- since I'd never previously been misled by either Marjorie or Joe
Perloff, I did in fact attempt to put on my underwear sitting down this
morning.  But I seemed to hit an impasse just above mid-thigh, and couldn't
get the danged things on while seated -- so -- I'm sitting here at the
keyboard, sort of fair to middling, stranded ---- think I'm going to have
to abandon the attempt and go back to being a stand-up kind of guy.

Dear J. Scappettone,
I look forward to your new reading series. I must object however to your
insistence that I don't know enough to speak of the University. I have a
very long view of things here in Berkeley, being on one side of me and on
one side of my husband fourth generation residents. Please note that my
original comment about the "babyishness" of the students was _not_ actually
a statement of any kind of fact or even really opinion, I just said they
have never seemed so babyish to me. Note "seemed" and "to me". Perhaps this
was too flip a statement, but it was definitely corralled by those two
markers. I seem to find this list more conversational than you do, and will
not be made to submit at all times to point by point analyses. I think humor
and lots of other methods are often much more effective, and indeed are
often the lovely products of analysis, point by point or otherwise. Your
comment that you thank me in advance for my future cooperation and respect
has really stuck with me. It annoys. It seems a bit "1984"-style. If this is
a free country, dear, no one can presume my cooperation and respect. I am
willing to have my compassion presumed.

Thanks

Elizabeth Treadwell

today in the "variety" section of the minneapolis star-tribune the lead

McDonald's toys?

How about . . .

GI Joe Terrorist Hijacker Action Figures!

Complete with disguises, fake airport clearance badges, copies of the Quran,
and other items carefully selected to fit our prejudicial imaginations about
what terrorists should really look like.

They just released their Pearl Harbor line: http://www.gijoe.com

  Thank you, Marjorie --- practically the first lit crit I ever read was a
piece of yours about Robert Lowell, and it was wise as well as tremendously
intelligent -- a great launching point, one of those things where you look
to memorize the name of the author in case you ever come across that writer
again.

  happy 70th, and many more.

Yeah Orwell had Britain and the US in mind when writing _1984_, but the 1984
edition of _1984_ had a foreward by Walter Cronkite comparing the nation in
the book to the Soviet Union.  Totalitarians need Orwell.  It quickly
becomes part of their doublespeak.  It is entirely predictable and there's
really no way to approach it except to systematically ignore it.  gestures
of power need observers, after all.

The recent London Review of Books has a worthwhile article on Empire, by
Malcolm Bull. I don't endorse the importation of Isaiah Berlin's tired
conceptual apparatus of "positive & negative freedom" in order to debunk
autonomist political theory, but, well:
http://www.lrb.co.uk/v23/n19/bull2319.htm

Theres' also a brief statement by Michael Hardt at:
http://slash.autonomedia.org/article.pl?sid=01/09/26/1250203

Excerpt from Bull:

If the 'war against terrorism' is going to be less of a fiasco than the 'war
on drugs', it requires global social inclusivity and reciprocity. Total
social control involves a degree of microregulation with which individuals
have to co-operate. One way totalitarian societies have differed from those
that are merely authoritarian is in their provision of work and healthcare.
(If you want to keep track of people you cannot abandon them when they are
unemployed or sick.) The link between welfare and totalitarianism works both
ways: social regulation and inclusion go together. If the US wants to make
the world a safer place, it will eventually have to offer, or force other
governments to provide, the population of the entire world with the means to
participate in global society. This will involve real constraints on the
operation of the market, particularly finance capital. Tuesday, 11 September
2001 may prove to be the date at which Neoliberalism and globalisation
parted company.

'Nous sommes tous Américains,' proclaimed the editorial in Le Monde. And not
just those who were horrified by the hijackings: the attack on New York and
Washington was not an act of war against a foreign enemy (it had no
strategic value) but a protest that implicitly acknowledged the sovereignty
of the United States. 'I am an American Airlines pilot,' boasted one
hijacker, drinking in his local bar. A mixture of black humour and wishful
thinking no doubt, but a clear indication of psychological proximity. If
Americans fail to understand why their country is hated, it is often because
they barely comprehend the extent of its influence. No one travels halfway
round the world to kill themselves amid a people with whom they feel no
connection. Even in the Arabian desert, America is uncomfortably close. For
the US, it may seem like a foreign war, but on the other side it is more
like a civil war, dividing families - the bin Ladens, for instance.

One thing that the hijackings have brought to the surface is the extent to
which 'the primordial founding myth' of a total society is already available
in the history of the United States. At one level, Hardt and Negri recognise
this. Their work is free of the European Left's residual anti-Americanism
and represents a systematic effort to appropriate the American myth for the
global multitude. But theirs is the America of potentia not of potestas.
They miss the point that even if the multitude could create its own
Americas, it would be stronger under the sovereignty of the existing one -
not just materially better off, but better able to bring about its social
and political objectives. The international Left's few successes of the past
fifty years - decolonisation, anti-racism, the women's movement, cultural
anti-authoritarianism - have all had proper (and often official) backing
from within the United States. The United States is no utopia, but a utopian
politics now has to be routed through it. Anti-globalisation is often an
argument for the globalisation of American norms - why should workers in the
Philippines have fewer rights than their American counterparts? Israel will
join the list of 'rogue states' only when the United States becomes more
representative of the population of the world. The totalitarian regimes of
the 20th century got a bad name less because of their monopolistic control
of everyday life than on account of their stifling insistence on a maxim of
shared values, and their draconian punishments for nonconformity. They were,
in Durkheimian terms, attempts to create total communities rather than total
societies. The US offers a model for a different type of totalitarianism.
Within a total society - a world of universal anomie populated by the
hybridised subjects of mutual recognition - monopolistic microregulation
need not be concerned with conformity. Of course, a global United States is
not a total society, but total society is rapidly becoming more imaginable
than the state of nature from which political theorising has traditionally
started. In this situation, we need to start thinking in new ways. Negri's
version of what Althusser called 'totality without closure' is a politics
without a social contract, 'a constituent power without limitations'. But in
a total society, it is not the social that needs a contract but the
individual - an anti-social contract that creates individual spaces in a
world totally regulated by meaningless mutuality.

Hello, I am a new member of the Poetics listserv. Here at the UNAM (the
National Autonomous University of Mexico) there is a group of us, American
Literature students all, who very much like Marjorie Perloff. We read her
books and study them together. We find that while it is extraordinarily
difficult sometimes to read some books of literary theory in English, that
the books and articles of Professor Perloff are always clear and full with
wanting to say what they set out to say (el contenido viene con su propio
sastre, as we say-- the content comes handy with its own tailor).

Que los cumpla feliz, Marjorie Perloff! Felicidades! Y gracias por sus
trabajos tan claros, generosos, y magnificos.

Miguel Vallejo

Dear Chris,

How are you?  How's life?  Could you help me post the following excellent
article to the Poetics List?

My best,

>
>"Americans are asking why do they hate us?" he said.

>
>For strategic, military and economic reasons, it is

>in the world, and the single biggest source on
>American streets.
>
>The annual profits, said to be between 100 and 200

btw, the talk of Israeli as a "democracy" always is bothersome to me,
since they still use laws on the books from the Ottoman Empire to claim
settlements in Palestine.  and when I say still, I mean to this day.  I am
sure there is legal mumbo jumbo that authorizes this, but this is either
inexcusable, or it suggests that "Empire" is a better way of
understanding the way the world works--literally. democracy is always
"democracy for whom?".

that said, apparently people in the West Bank and Gaza, when asked to
compare, prefer Israeli democracy to the US.  a comment on its proximity,
certainly, but perhaps also on the relatively high profile that dissent
has in that country...as opposed to ours, where for all our sound and fury
about free speech, the reign of public shame muffles the right and the
left.  (though mostly the left, Drn!)

Welcome to the List miguel. But since your name is kind of foreign and your
domain(?) is "Hotmail," perhaps I should be sure you are not a heteronym.

mr. brink:

i tried in an earlier post, perhaps unsuccessfully, to alert the list
community to the presence of those who, operating under pseudonym
(not a problem in itself), would seek to subvert any attempt here at
building community (the c-word, yes, but hold on, i'm not through
yet)...

now i take it as a given that employing rhetoric in the service of
our gropings & graspings (i.e., our correspondence hereabouts) will
no doubt over- or underplay facets of our personalities, yet that
this is a qualitatively different posture than the adoption of a
persona, the explicit aim of which is to serve as a
provocateur-agent-avatar, whose specific aim (if any) is to deliver a
form of poetic terrorism (a la hakim bey?  i'll leave off the scare
quotes, in any case) that is bound to upset (affectively *&*
procedurally) any & all attempts at maintaining congenial online
relations, so defined... of course the implied community i have in
mind, however altered as a result of x members from one country, y
from another (& given the digital realities we're all busy plying),
will nonetheless be predicated on good faith, on a striving
toward---not consensus---but civil relations... i don't have anything
more specific in mind, no---but i *do* believe that there are those
who would unsettle civility itself...

the threat of which poetic terrorism (please do read this vis-a-vis
the wider public domain at present, & with due regard for those who
would imagine that a better world requires such egg-scrambling) our
fearless moderator is undoubtedly doing his best to mitigate, by
controlling the reaction to said initial "bomb" prompt from one
"selim abdul sadiq" (who may very well be one & the same... body...
as the no-longer-present "ammonides"---and recall my little public
beef with "ammonides" a few weeks back)...

no, murat, i don't think you're wrong here---in fact i completely
agree with you... but i also understand only too well the burden our
moderator is no doubt operating under, having been in exactly that
position myself for some years... & i understand, too, the
potentially incendiary provocation of my apparent alignment of (what
i'm calling) poetic terrorism with terrorism per se (there is surely
a substantive difference, as i argued on the technoculture list (with
some from this list, some of you will recall) a decade ago...
nonetheless i argued against poetic terrorism then, as i'd argue
against it now)... in any case i don't wish to be incendiary---i am
simply pulling out the alignment for all to see, as i would surmise
it's hovering around in our heads, if not our pinkies...

lest someone think i am acting as an apologist for chris alexander,
let me say outright that i consider chris a friend & (hell) an ally
of some years, & that i KNOW he has his hands full right now & is
trying his damnedest to "do the right thing"... so yeah, if that
makes me an apologist, so be it...

of course, anything chris does to mitigate an incipient
spiraling-out-of-control, so perceived (which this list *has*
experienced in the past, during its first meltdown), may in this
cultural climate begin to feel not unlike the security measures
ashcroft is trying to fast-track through congress...

listen:  can we, as writers, exert a little imaginative effort here,
together, & posit what might be going on backchannel (and not simply
frontchannel)?... can we imagine, together, what it's like when
you've got people subbing to this list under pseudonyms (again,
that's ok, but---) who would likewise use the particular liberty of
list subscription (if that's what it is) to upset the stated aims of
the list? (yes, perhaps these are people who were subbed to the list
before, & long since "banished," for some possibly sane reasons---but
please do consult the list archives, & draw your own conclusions... i
certainly have drawn mine)...

mr. brink:  i don't know you, & you don't me, but i bet if you knew
what i'm imagining, or if you imagined what i know, you'd retract
that post... can i ask you, even though you don't know me, to take
this post on good faith?... i imagine, too, that no matter what, we
might not agree... & i assure you---i am who i say i am, whoever that
is... please see http://stripe.colorado.edu/~amatoj for confirmation
(w/photo)... my identity may ever be in flux, but i have no desire to
deceive anyone around here (even when i sign only a portion of my
name, or when, as i used to, i sign "tomato")...

in any case, in the meantime, i implore the rest of this list to cut
our moderator some slack here---really, he's caught between a rock &
a hard spot no matter *what* he does... as in, *really*...

best,

joe

 Dear List,
          I join with others who are deeply grateful for the service this
List (and
 their like to which I subscribe) has given its members in facilitating a
distribution and
 exchange of experiences and information and understanding and so helping us
all
 come to grips with September 11 and its on-going consequences. While I have
watched CNN, and
 the news media which here in New Zealand have of course provided what is
called  'coverage', it
 was the internet on which I immediately came to rely. It connected me--as
the phone didn't--to
 my New York friends--and through the Lists, set in motion a flow of
immediate individual responses
 and subsequently of analysis and background information, through rich and
thoughtful postings
 and sets of links. I have daily downloaded essays and posts to take home to
read which have
 enabled me to contextualize and assess what the news media here and abroad
are delivering. I have
 gone on thinking about some of the angles produced here--such as the
discussion of flags--
 such as Barrett and Ron's posts, and I have taken an interest in the
particular PROGRESS of
 discussion. It has been engrossing, and for the most part, vital. Now, I
wonder how long
 this level of engagement will continue and what it will be like when it
eases off, when it will tell me nothing new, or nothing that interests me,
and begin to annoy and distress. I am prompted
 to wonder this after reading the forwarded article below.

>mujahideen from 40 Islamic countries as soldiers for
>America's proxy war. The rank and file of the
>mujahideen were unaware that their jehad was actually
>being fought on behalf of Uncle Sam.(The irony is that
>America was equally unaware that it was financing a
>future war against itself).
>
>By 1989, after being bloodied by 10 years of

>behind a civilisation reduced to rubble. Civil war in
>Afghanistan raged on. The jehad spread to Chechnya,
>Kosovo and eventually to Kashmir. The CIA continued to
>pour in money and military equipment, but the
>overheads had become immense, and more money was
>needed. The mujahideen ordered farmers to plant opium
>as 'revolutionary tax'. The ISI set up hundreds of
>heroin laboratories across Afghanistan. Within two
>years of the CIA's arrival, the Pakistan-Afghanistan
>borderland had become the biggest producer of heroin
>in the world, and the single biggest source on
>American streets.
>
>The annual profits, said to be between 100 and 200
>billion dollars, were ploughed back into training and
>arming militants.
>
>In 1995, the Taliban-then a marginal sect of
>dangerous, hardline fundamentalists-fought its way to
>power in Afghanistan. It was funded by the ISI, that
>old cohort of the CIA, and supported by many political
>parties in Pakistan. The Taliban unleashed a regime of

>particularly women. It closed down girls' schools,
>dismissed women from government jobs, enforced Sharia

 Murat,
     A couple of footnotes.
     (1) The Leader of the Opposition, a Ms Jenny Shipley, returned a few
days ago
     from New York, where she had met people she described as POWERFUL, and
reported
     that they had said they thought New Zealand had been very slow in
offering its
     support for the US and said so IN FRONT OF OUR AMBASSADOR. Certainly
slower than
     Australia (Oh, God no, not slower than Australia!). This was an attack
on the Prime
     Minister. The rebuttal was quick, and US officials we quoted, proving
how QUICK we
     had been to offer our support and how much our SWIFTNESS in this regard
had been
     appreciated.
     (2) Yesterday there was a news story about how the Americas Cup was a
likely
     terrorist target. Thing is Murat, population density is not the only
message,
     as I am sure you know. And in the sporting world, New Zealand regards
itself as
     as SUPER POWER why wouldn't it, it holds the AMERICAS CUP, and them
Americans want
     it back, and they are coming here in a few months with their big
SYNDICATES to take it
     back. Need I say more?

Richard,

It is easier for you, it appears to me, to have this admiration for the
September elevening of New York city from New Zealand (I assume that's where
you live); essentially, because you don't really believe that New Zealand
would be the target of a future biological attack -not because of a
political
reason, but simply because New Zealand does not have enough concentration of
population to make it a "cost effectivge" target.

I wonder if you would post the same "revolutionary," "prophetic" ("the
beginning of the end of capitalism," so on and so forth) posts if you were
living in New York City.

I am curious what kind of correlation there exists, among the people on the
list, between their political attitudes towards the catastrophe and the
population density of the place where they live. Can we run an informal poll
on that?

September 11 is, among other things, an attack on the idea of people living
together as a community, in a large polis, an attack on the idea of modern
(at least Western) urban living.

From The American Prospective

Preemptive Peace
Chris Mooney


The Idea Log is a new column by Chris Mooney. It will appear on TAP =
Online every Tuesday.=20

After attending last Saturday's 7,500 person peace march in downtown =
Washington, D.C., sponsored by "International A.N.S.W.E.R." (Act Now to =
Stop War & End Racism), I was left with a rather odd conclusion: The =
protesters hadn't watched enough CNN. I mean, I'm sure they were glued =
to the news on September 11th like all the rest of us, watching the =
trade towers collapse again and again, and hearing some U.S. foreign =
policy luminaries, like Lawrence Eagleburger, call for sweeping =
retribution. But after September 12th or 13th, the demonstrators, many =
of them students, appear to have switched off. One of the countless =
protest signs I saw -- and one of the few sarcastic ones -- read "Rush =
In, Think Later." This is precisely what the Bush administration has not =
done, though it's hard to say the same of certain peaceniks.=20

Such is the paradox of a preemptive peace march, a protest that =
critiques the logic of revenge before retributive action has even been =
attempted. Sure, there are situations where one should protest something =
before it happens -- but the thing being protested should at least be a =
likely outcome. That's not true in this case. Whatever military response =
the Bush administration and its allies may be planning, we are certainly =
not talking about any Vietnam-style napalming of innocents. Indeed, the =
United States is already providing aid to Afghan refugees. Yet because =
today's peace movement has taken to the streets so prematurely, it is =
forced to rely on dubious presumptions about the American psyche and how =
it will respond, murderously, to future events.=20

Granted, from a peacenik perspective, it's indisputable that shortly =
after the World Trade Center attacks, quite a lot of Americans were =
sounding alarmingly bloodthirsty. One of the most disturbing, but least =
criticized, screeds came from Time magazine's Lance Morrow, who wrote, =
in a column titled "The Case for Rage and Retribution," that we ought to =
"explore the rich reciprocal possibilities of the fatwa."=20

But no one, not Morrow or any other commentator who embarrassed himself =
with unchecked rage, was operating with a full deck that awful week. =
After all, much of America wasn't even sleeping at night. Since then, =
however, it has clearly dawned on the Bush administration that the goal =
of defeating international terrorism cannot possibly be furthered by =
bombing the hell out of starving Afghans. This realization could be =
observed in the careful tones of Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld =
Sunday morning on Meet the Press:=20


  MR. RUSSERT: The president said that Osama bin Laden is wanted dead or =
alive. Do we have a preference?=20
  SEC'Y RUMSFELD: Well, you know, I don't think about this so much as =
retaliation or retribution or even justice. I think about it as -- I =
think back to real wars, the goal is victory. The goal is to be able to =
have dealt with the problems that exist--in this case, the terrorist =
networks and the countries that harbor them--in a way that we have won; =
that in fact they are no longer free to go out and terrorize the world.
It's worth contrasting Rumsfeld's caution with the International Answer =
protesters' repeated, hyperbolic denunciations of this nation's new =
"racist war." Put aside the fact that there is no military action yet to =
protest, and little reason to suppose that knee-jerk cries for revenge =
will drive U.S. policy. The notion that U.S. military action, when it =
comes, will be somehow "racist" is absurd. The protesters seem to have =
conflated isolated instances of hate crimes against Arab and Muslim =
Americans with the Bush administration's "war on terrorism" -- this =
despite the fact that Bush has repeatedly denounced such violence and =
emphasized that we should not think of our current conflict as one =
between Islam and "the West."=20

But then, we shouldn't expect much charity toward the president from =
protesters capable of airing slogans like "The Real Terrorist Works in =
the White House." I consider George W. Bush a dim bulb, even an impostor =
-- and certainly oppose many aspects of his foreign policy -- but =
calling him a terrorist is a truly vile form of moral equivalency. Yet =
it frequently fit the tone of the protests, where I watched some =
organizers label those who disagreed with them undercover government =
agents, and one 21-year-old told me, in his pacifism, that we shouldn't =
have fought Hitler.=20

Devout word watchers may have noted that journalists and others have =
taken to using "enormity" to describe the events of September 11th, as =
though it were the only word in the language capable of conveying the =
true, unique horror of that day. By contrast, to the peace protesters, =
everything is now a form of "terrorism," from U.S. sanctions on Iraq to =
the layoffs of workers ("economic terrorism"). Almost the only thing the =
protesters didn't widely denounce, amid a plethora of IMF/World Bank =
grievances, was radical Muslim fundamentalism. Indeed, it seemed as =
though the only time Osama bin Laden came up at all was when protesters =
were observing that the CIA helped train him. So it's no surprise that =
politically, at least, they shared some of his explicit objectives: =
"It's U.S. Troop Proximity to Mecca & Medina, Stupid!" "U.S. Out of the =
Middle East!"=20

But I still keep coming back to that sign, "Rush In, Think Later." I =
think about its holder, and try to imagine what was running through his =
or her mind. (I should have just asked, but it didn't occur to me at the =
moment.) Protests themselves may take weeks to organize, but protest =
signs take just minutes to draw up. There must have been something =
instinctive and deep-seated behind that slogan, for its creator to be =
able to twist reality so starkly, rushing in to protest U.S. haste long =
after our government showed caution. Dare one suggest -- without =
cramming stars and stripes down anyone's throat -- that it is the =
blindly held creed of anti-Americanism?=20

Just a reminder, the US government, the US economy, the US's sense of
religious superiority, and perhaps above all the US military were borne of
UNIMAGINABLE GENOCIDE WITHIN OUR "BORDERS". OK, let's try not to forget that
too, too often!

For the record, I'd add that much of the US's ideals and particular forms of
freedoms, democracy, feminism stems from Native American philosophies and
customs.

How both these things are true is one of the conundra.

Murat. Quite briefly: of course my reaction would be different. Just as
someone living in eg Palestine would be ..but High density of population is
not the issue or where you live: its tryig to deal with the reality of
what's happenning. Reality becomes or maybe is already irreality: I can
"understand" Stcckhausen's reaction "tasteless" as that seems.
  Of course is"easier" for me being herewhere we've never had a war this
century: but dont censor or moderate peoples' reactions..they are all valid
even if some are what we (you, others) consider to be whacko.
  I think that this situation will turn out to be less terrible thasn
everyone thinks and it may well be "an advanced warning" but who knowsa,
maybe American capitalism will continue on its merry exploitative and
warlile way for ever: after al I'm ok.  Let's all get on with our lives and
take the pressure off the poorer peoples: I'm not going to support your mate
Bush or the idiot in charge of Britain...I rather admire these guys to blow
up a couple of big towers. I wish they'd fire 20 into New Zealand especially
the parliament in Wellington and I dont like the Auckland centre very much.
  But lets keep calm and maybe learn something from it all. Regards, Richard

We are also preparing a collage of Dr. Nudel's writings (together with
other materials) related to the terrorist attack on New York (working
title 9-1-1).  Popula and I were laid up with the Nimda virus and are
only just now sitting up and taking a little nourishment, hence the
delay.

We should welcome any comments and on this undertaking, on- or off-list.

Murat. I think you rather simplistically (I dont mean that you are
simplistic or simple: I may be the naive one...) assume these correlations.
It's not certain who actually carried out this attack or why but the
resultant is that it shows that the Super Powers are very vulnerable: we all
are every where.(Which has its positive side eg it means that they are less
capabe of repression etc) They (the "terrorists" or "revolutionaries" or
whatever you term them) may not be(probably are not) Marxists or
revolutionaries, but they dont come out of a vacuum. Regardless of that, if
I felt that the destruction of capitalism would be facilitated by this kind
of atack, and if I felt that the end result would be a "higher society", a
more egalitarian and progressive society and I was very dedicated to that: I
can imagine organising this attack. Note that I say IF. To do so you cant
think things like: "Oh how terrible, it might have been Auckland, or Oslo,
or Amsterdam or some small hamlet somehwere: or my son or daughter might
have been there". If you're in it for the long term you have to be prepared
to die yourself and be convinced that the deaths of 7000 or 700,000 people
is not important relative to the ultimate outcome. Whether that is the case
I dont know. In addition one might be organising protests to disrupt and
criticise the the system on the ground. Its always the case that the
"revolutionary" doesnt want to be himself/herself attacked or hurt. That may
sound like cowardice but revolutions are not tea parties. The point is the
result. The other point is that things never happen as one expects. This
attack came out of the blue, as they say, it is both advantageous to the
extreme right and possibly in the long term does "augur" the "beginning" (if
there can be a beginning) of the downfall of capitalism: not civilisation
(there are civilisations all over the world and the West and East are very
linked as well as different in their "level" and their awareness of soceital
things historical consciousness etc are different, but there are many things
in common...) and obviously the result certain extreme groups wanted....why
exactly? I dont know. But the action to be taken now is I feel a wide
ranging education and discussion on the world political situation (and
cooperation of ALL countries in non military ways as long as this is
voluntary) - but spare us from the pious crap from Bush and the Blair - when
I raved on about the towers I was expressing a reality of a kind: one in my
own mind. I can see eg where Stochausenn is  or was coming from....but I
also know that real people were killed and that is a tragedy. Terrible. But
people can be fascinated by terrible things: are, in fact. They lie who say
they never have any "evil" thoughts. The dangerous people (if they are that)
are those who say nothing and seethe. The danger is to shut down debate and
let people seethe.
  Just as its stupid to imagine Britain or the US can "cure the world" (even
if they wanted to) its stupid to continue to not say what one thinks and to
not delve into the truth (difficult as that is to discover or even define).
 If, to tack again, I did feel that the worst elements were getting the
upper hand (I dont think so eg I think that at the most the Taleban (while I
think they arent as bad as they have been portrayed) are in many ways a bit
sad, not frightening.
On that, one can pick out innumerable places where there are injustices and
"peculiar " or supposedly "backward" practices.) ....I would be behind a
military defence/offensive by the West....but I think we're far from that
so far (not that they've consulted me) I dont support NZ giving support to
the US-British military action. I am quite confident that at this stage a
constructive "humanitarian" aproach by the US and a wihdrawal by it (and
other Western or Eastern nations as appropriate) of their stupid "Policeman
Stance" in the world is part of any "attack on terrorism"...but a War on
Terrorism?  Doesnt that involve terror?
    I'm not for "smugness" but ultimately I am for "progress" (hence I would
not foster Moslemic concepts - any religious concepts  of any organised
religion - myself ...hence to the extent that this is or can be shown to be)
by religious crazed men and women I'm opposed to those people. But you are
not facing a particular country that is arming hugely against you...as long
as capitalism persists terrorism will too..but that doesnt mean that the
good and many great things of Western and Eastern civilisations are in
danger: in a sense they are always. When I say capitalism is under attack
etc...I think I'm trying to say something about the historical process:  If
the 1000 million or so Muslims were united behind some Hitlerian leader
clearly determined to destroy civilisation then of course we are all behind
the US etal ...but that situation doesnt portend.
   But I dont know...one thing about it all is that I have done more
debating and thinking about world politics poverty civilisation etc that I
have for a long time: look, my initial reaction was quite reactionary, I was
very angry that the US  and especially NY had been attacked: I wanted a bood
thirsty retaliation...at first.......part of me still is. After all we are
indebted to the US for  itis defeat of Japan in the Sec WW: which took a
terrible toll on young American men and people. America etc and Britain are
at their best great countries: but at their worst are blood thirsty
warmongers....
  For many days (ok I'm in NZ but the television brings things so close so
powerfully) I was dazed: split, confused, elated, angry, troubled: some of
the rhetoric that came out was maybe to "cut myself away" from facing that
terrible reality of the killing of all those people and the children who had
lost parents...and I know (or do I know?) that the terrorists dont think
that way: if they think they hate: but why, and how do such people arise:
what is happening?  What CAN be done? Regards, Richard.

Aaron. So you feel there has been some positive and qualitative change? Is
it now naive to imagine that the countries (and hopefully also all the
peoples of those countries) may begin to unite and the "global" Capitalism
sees the need for that?  Which would argue that by some miracle we are
getting "better"......its true some of what is said here: especially that
(in a strange way) its a "compliment" to the US (hence the West but maybe
some of the more "racy" and "exciting" aspects of the West - portayed
somewhat thru the movies) that they become a target. Or is "Sod's Law"
always to be there...that every advance brings its corresponding counter
atack? Or is Marjorie Perloff atal right? "Civilisation" is threatened?
  I think this one is complex: its almost as if what processes could lead to
enormous social material scientific philosophic political spiritual and
economic improvements (or enlightenments) are just there in our grasp....but
maybe the  people in control (of the military state complex, of big
business, of the means of production) are too habituated to let go? And the
workers similarly: and the "good" left are now too cynical or skeptical: eg
I'd like to believe that Tony Blair wants a better world: maybe he
does...lets hope that this all forces Bush and his cohorts, and maybe the
leaders and the people of the world,to do "good": maybe be isnt as bad as we
all think. Understandable to be hawkish and angry after Bin Laden: but oncce
you've dealt with him etal : what then ? Everything comes right? Or in 10
years we get a bigger sligshot hurled at us...and I say us...we are all in
this, for or against. Let's hope: maybe I'm becoming soft. Let's hope. But I
dont want to see young men of any nation die needlessly. Execute me, but
dont bomb people. Richard.

Dear Elizabeth,

You're absolutely right:  compassion is a much better way of putting it and
a much better thing to ask for than cooperation.  Sorry about the latter.
Chalk the tension in it up to my having been verbally attacked/threatened
that entire week, as a number of friends were, for having passed teach-in
announcements, other news, et al around; it wasn't personally directed.  I
didn't mean to come across as 1984ish only as desiring a hearing from
traditional allies when it seemed like no one with the most slightly
aberrant views was getting a hearing, especially young people (the New York
Times noted in its Tuesday "coverage" of war protests that marchers in
Washington DC were "mostly young people"; added to the young people and
apparently just as unconvincing to reporters were the "old peacenik"s); that
moment appears to have possibly passed.  This might be counterintuitive, but
I also didn't mean for the "you" of that last sentence to read as the
singular you; I hoped to address "fellow members of the left," so it was a
more global bid to give the present kids a chance before choosing to side or
not.  Otherwise I wouldn't have responded in the first place.  That's it;
sorry about the miscommunications & thanks for the responses

Who Benefits from the World Trade Center/Pentagon Attacks?

Who Benefits? That's always the first question to consider when a
"terrorist"
attack occurs. Instead of clenching one's fist, waving one's flag and
shouting
vindictive slogans, let's just stop for a moment of calm analysis of the
basic
facts. When we analyze who benefits, we immediately will know with over 99%
surety, who did it!

What was the tone of U.S. and world opinion just a week or two before the
attacks?

In the U.S., the economy was lagging badly, the stock market was falling,
many
were questioning if the government's taxes were legal, the Gary Condit case
had
been poorly handled, people continued to question Waco and the Oklahoma City
bombing, they questioned our support of Israel in her policies regarding the
Palestinians, and the approval rate of President Bush was low.

What about World Opinion? Just 8 days before the WTC/Pentagon attacks,
Israel
was stunned by a UN decision equating Zionism with Racism, according to
Ha'aretz
Daily.com.

Israel was branded a "racist apartheid" state by thousands of
non-governmental
organizations (NGOs) attending a U.N. World Conference Against Racism in
Durban,
South Africa. The conference was attended by representatives of 153
governments.

The declaration, adopted by 3,000 NGOs in 44 regional and interest-based
caucuses, shocked Jewish groups.

Foreign Minister Shimon Peres called the anti-Israel declarations a
disgrace,
and said that Israel was "seriously" contemplating withdrawing from the
conference in protest. The Israeli delegation to the conference blasted the
language of the NGO declaration as an incitement to hatred of Jews.

Jewish delegates walked out. The U.S. delegates followed.

The Forum accused the Jewish state of "systematic perpetration of racist
crimes
including war crimes, acts of genocide and ethnic cleansing" in its
treatment of
the Palestinians.

In addition, the head of the Danish Red Cross, Freddy Karup Pederson, told
the
Danish Parliamentary Foreign Affairs Committee that the lifestyle of Jewish
settlers in the Palestinian territories resembles that of whites under the
former racist apartheid system. He also criticized Israel's collective
punishment of the Palestinian population.

So, just 8 days before the attacks, the overwhelming attitude of the nations
of
the world was against Israel's policies and in support of the Arab
countries'
charges against Israel, a nation heavily supported by, and allied with, the
U.S.


What has happened to U.S. and World Opinion SINCE the attacks?

Immediately AFTER the attack, public opinion was turned 180 degrees. Now the
Arab countries are being demonized, the U.S. population is overwhelmingly
backing the President (according to the Washington Post), urging him to
punish,
kill, destroy, annihilate the perpetrators of this crime, even though no one
really has any proof who did it, the U.S. government is preparing for war,
the
U.S. and Israel have carte blanche support to bomb nearly every Arab country
out
of existence.

No one is questioning anymore the "apartheid" policies of the Israelis
against
the Palestinians. War, as politicians have known throughout history,
stimulates
the economy and (if the propaganda is handled properly) unifies the
population
behind the President and squelches ALL criticism.

Anyone who is not 100% behind the President is considered a traitor.
President
Bush in a televised Speech to Congress, urged global support for his war on
terrorists, warning the world: "either you are with us, or you are with the
terrorists." (Washington AFP) 9-21-01 (An effective way to stifle all
dissent!)

If you don't go along with the plan for destruction of the Arabs advocated
by
the government, you become the target of threats and must have bodyguards,
as
California Democrat Barbara Lee has discovered. She cast the lone vote in
Congress against the use of military force in response to the WTC/Pentagon
attacks and now must have Police guarding her Capitol Hill office. (Reuters,
AP,
 ABCNEWS.com
9-18-01)


What ELSE has happened since the attacks?

1) The population has been prepared for a long term war where the number of
U.S.
casualties will be high (Washington Post Online September 21, 2001).

2) Bush creates a High Office of "Homeland Security" supposedly to protect
Americans from attack. The job would involve coordination of government-wide
domestic security efforts, including meshing domestic FBI and foreign CIA
intelligence, working with U.S. military, emergency officials and state and
local governments.

The Homeland Defense position "would probably not need Senate confirmation,
which other Cabinet jobs require, nor legislation to create" White House
officials said. So there would be no investigation, oversight nor
accountability
for this person. (Reuters - Washington 9-21-01) (Perfect conditions to
appoint a
crony)

3) U.S. orders 40 million doses of smallpox vaccine for $343 million in
preparation for a possible bioterrorism assault. The contract has been given
to
a small, Cambridge-based firm, Acambis, a British biotechnology company who
reported a net loss of $8 million in the six months prior to June 30,
unchanged
from last year. (How convenient to get this huge order! It would be
interesting
to find out the conflict of interest issues here.) (Reuters News, London
9-20-01) PREPARING THE POPULATION TO EXPECT BIO-TERRORISM.

4) "America and Britain are producing secret plans to launch a ten year "war
on
terrorism" - Operation Noble Eagle - involving a completely new military and
diplomatic strategy to eliminate terrorist networks and cells around the
world."
(The Times - London 9-20-01)

5) The Senate OKs FBI Spying on the Internet: FBI agents soon will be able
to
spy on Internet users legally without a court order. Two days after the
terrorist attack, the Senate approved the "Combating Terrorism Act of 2001"
which enhances police wiretap powers and permits monitoring in more
situations.
The FBI's surveillance system is called Carnivore. (Lycos Network 9-20-01)
MORE
CONTROL!

6) The U.S. Plans to overthrow Taliban and put Afghanistan under UN Control,
according to The Guardian - London (9-21-01) NOTE: Yugoslavia is ALREADY
under
UN control. (MORE UN CONTROL)

7) A global surveillance system known as Echelon exists and has the ability
to
eavesdrop on telephone calls, faxes and e-mail messages, a European
Parliament
committee has concluded. (Lycos Network 9-20-01) MORE CONTROL!

8) Face-ID Technology gains new support. "State lawmakers who were planning
to
sponsor legislation restricting its use now say they are reassessing their
plans." MORE CONTROL! (Denver Post Capitol Bureau, 9-20-01)

9) "Experts See a High-Security America of Surveillance & Seizures": New
York:
Security Experts in the United States are describing a new kind of country
that
could emerge, where electronic identification might become the norm,
immigrants
might be tracked far more closely and the airspace over cities like New York
and
Washington might be off-limits to all civilian aircraft." (The International
Herald Tribune 9-19-01) MORE SURVEILLANCE OF U.S. CITIZENS.

10) "Lawmakers See Need to Loosen Rules on CIA" Congressional leaders who
oversee the nation's intelligence system have concluded that America's spy
agencies should be allowed to combat terrorism with more aggressive tactics,
including the hiring of unsavory foreign agents, including revived
discussion of
reversing the US 25 year ban on using covert agents to assassinate
foreigners.
R. James Woolsey, the former director of the CIA said that "Washington has
absolutely undergone a sea change in thinking this week." (New York Times,
9-16-01) MORE SURVEILLANCE OF U.S. CITIZENS!

11) NATO Announces a Third World War is Almost Upon Us. A pentagon spokesman
hinted towards potential targets being Libya, Iraq, Iran, Afghanistan, North
Korea, Syria and others. (NATO Secretary-General Lord Robertson)

12) California Congresswoman, Mary Bono, R-Palm Springs warned that the
country
should prepare for a fight against international terrorists that will likely
include personal sacrifice, the use of ground troops overseas and the risk
of
retaliation against civilians by the enemy. She also predicts intense
scrutiny
of airline passengers, a national system of fingerprinting and
identification
cards and the specter of chemical and biological attacks on the U.S. (The
Desert
Sun 9-18-01)

13) An enemy is needed to justify a $344 Billion War Budget, when the
federal
government currently spends only $42 billion on education, $26 billion on
affordable housing and $1 billion on school construction.

14) President Bush sent his anti-terrorism bill to Congress one week after
the
WTC/Pentagon attack, launching an emotional debate that will force U.S.
politicians to choose between continued freedom for Americans or greater
security. (Lycos Network 9-20-01) DOES ANYBODY KNOW HOW LONG IT TAKES TO
WRITE
ONE OF THESE BILLS? IT TAKES MONTHS! They are hundreds of pages long. THIS
ONE
WAS OBVIOUSLY WRITTEN BEFORE THE ATTACK! How convenient! Wake up America!

15) "President George Bush focused his energy on building a GLOBAL ALLIANCE
for
a fight against terrorism..." (MSNBC 9-18-01) Here comes the New World
Order!

16) Fast-Moving House Bill Restricts Liberties - Much of it Unrelated to
Terrorism! Congress is being asked to rush to pass emergency anti-terrorist
legislation written by the Department of Justice, but much of the
legislation
turns out to have nothing to do with fighting terrorism. Instead, the
legislation contains a host of items which have been on the bureaucratic
wish
lists for many years.

17) "We Must Ignore the Peace Lobby and Show No Restraint" says The
Independent - London (9-24-01)

18) Bush Suspends Habeas Corpus: Legal Immigrants May Be Held Without Cause:
"The Bush Administration today announced it is using its powers under the
National Emergency Act to suspend the right of Habeas Corpus for all
immigrants
in the country, including legal immigrants, meaning that any immigrant in
the
U.S. right now can be held INDEFINITELY by the police or government WITHOUT
TRIAL OR DEMONSTRATION OF CAUSE TO HOLD THEM."

Though no one has yet suggested infringing the rights of U.S. citizens, the
move
is a frightening first step to a national tyranny, based on perpetual
suspension
of the Constitution in the name of fighting perpetual war."

19) President Bush has agreed to bail out the airlines with BILLIONS of
dollars,
an industry that was swimming in red ink LONG BEFORE the WTC/Pentagon
attacks.


What was known BEFORE the attack - and by whom?

1) Echelon Gave Authorities 3 Month Warning of Attacks - German Paper:
Frankfurt, Germany - U.S. and Israeli intelligence agencies received warning
signals at least three months ago that terrorists were planning to hijack
commercial aircraft to use as weapons to attack important symbols of
American
culture, according to a story in Germany's daily Frankfurter Allgemeine
Zeiung
(FAZ). Newsbytes.com

2) U.S. planned to attack Taliban BEFORE WTC/Pentagon Attacks: A former
Pakistani diplomat has told the BBC that the U.S. was planning military
action
against Osama Bin Laden and the Taliban even before last week's attacks.
Niaz
Naik, a former Pakistani Foreign Secretary, was told by senior American
officials in mid-July that military action against Afghanistan would go
ahead by
the middle of October. (BBC News 9-18-01)

3) Expert - Russia Knew In Advance...Encouraged Citizens to Cash Out
Dollars:
Russian press accounts and other activities by the Russian government this
summer indicate that the Russians knew in advance that something would
happen to
America, including a "financial attack" against the U.S. During the past
three
months, Russian media and officials have encouraged citizens to cash out of
U.S.
dollars pending an economic collapse there after an "attack." (NewsMax.com
9-17-01)

4) FBI tracked man in custody 2 weeks before attacks: "Two weeks before the
terrorist attacks in New York City and Washington, D.C., FBI agents were at
a
flight school in Oklahoma asking questions about a man now suspected of
having a
link to those attacks", according to CNN.

"The fact that FBI agents were at the Airman Flight School in Norman,
Oklahoma,
two weeks before any attacks would seem to contradict the agency's assertion
that it was not aware of any connection between aviation schools and
suspected
terrorists. FBI Director Robert Mueller has stated publicly, "There were NO
warning signs that I'm aware of that would indicate this type of operation
in
the country," (CNN.com 9-18-01) SOMEBODY IS LYING!

5) U.S. Pulled Plug on 500 Arab/Muslim Websites the Day BEFORE Jetliner
Attacks:
Five hundred websites - many of them with an Arab or Muslim connection -
crashed
when an anti-terrorism task force raided InfoCom Corporation in Texas. The
80-strong task force that descended upon the IT company included FBI agents,
Secret Service agents, Diplomatic Security agents, tax inspectors,
immigration
officials, customs officials, department of commerce officials and computer
experts. (Brian Whitaker 9-12-01)

6) U.S. was warned in 1995 of plot to hijack planes, attack buildings: The
FBI
was warned six years ago of a terrorist plot to hijack commercial planes and
slam them into the Pentagon, The CIA headquarters and other buildings,
Philippine investigators told CNN. The plan was termed Project Bojinka.
(Manila,
Philippines CNN 9-18-01)

7) "U.S. Government Had Prior Knowledge of Emergency: The most massive
so-called
"terrorist" attacks on U.S. soil since the Oklahoma City bombings of 1995,
were
known, a week ahead of time, by the American CIA. Among the foreign
intelligence
agencies who penetrated the plots were the French CIA and Israel's The
Mossad,
units of both often working with one another.

"Foreign intelligence sources confirm the validity of this story. And they
state
that they informed the U.S. secret police who absolutely failed, neglected,
and
outright refused to take action as to known prior specifics of which the
top-level of the CIA were informed in advance." (www.skolnicksreport.com

8) Spy in the White House? "Terrorists" had Ultra Secret Codes on 911:
(DEBKA
Intelligence Files 9-22-01)

9) More Unusual Market Activity Reported BEFORE Attacks: "Chicago traders on
Wednesday cited unusual activity in airline options up to a month before
attacks
on U.S. landmarks, and German bankers reported brisk activity in reinsurer
Munich Re shares, adding to speculation that those behind the attacks tried
to
profit from their acts. (Reuters 9-20-01)

So how come EVERYONE else knew this was going to happen? Why would the U.S.
refuse to investigate when told, unless it was their own plan all along?


BIG CLUE!! Why did the Towers IMPLODE instead of EXPLODE?

The towers came down as gracefully as a fountain of water. "Too methodical
to be
a chance result of airplanes colliding with the structures" said Van Romero,
vice president for research at New Mexico Institute of Mining and
Technology.

"My opinion is that after the airplanes hit the World Trade Center there
were
some explosive devices inside the buildings that caused the towers to
collapse,"
Romero said. Romero is a former director of the Energetic Materials Research
and
Testing Center at Tech, which studies explosive materials and the effects of
explosions on buildings, aircraft and other structures.

The Towers IMPLODED! They did NOT explode! A fuel fire causes an EXplosion,
not
an IMplosion. Explosions explode OUT. Implosions, implode IN!

IMPLOSIONS can ONLY occur with immense planning by a highly skilled group of
craftsmen educated in the unique skill of demolishing buildings by
strategically
placing explosive devices within the building. This requires many experts,
much
time and significant access to the building beforehand.

The skill of implosion of buildings was developed primarily to demolish
buildings in areas of high building density, so the destruction of the
structure
will not cause damage to the surrounding buildings.

In addition, the towers came down long after the planes struck. To suggest
that
fuel dumping from the airplanes caused a fire hot enough to melt the inner
structure is ludicrous.

First of all, who can prove the planes dumped all of their fuel into the
core of
the building?

Second, why did the fuel take so long to catch fire?

Third, fuel-fires cause EXplosions, NOT IMplosions!

Fourth, the structure was built to withstand temperatures of 2000 degrees
Fahrenheit, according to the architect and designer of the building, a man
who
is now deceased, but who preserved this nugget of information in an
interview he
recorded in 1998.

Hyman Brown, a University of Colorado civil engineering professor and the
World
Trade Center's construction manager, watched in confusion as the towers came
down. "It was over-designed to withstand almost anything including
hurricanes,
high winds, bombings and an airplane hitting it," he said. (Scripps Howard
News
Service 9-11,01 and 9-12-01)

So, why was it necessary to implode the whole structure? To eliminate
evidence,
just as was done to the Murrah building in Oklahoma City, before the
forensic
specialists could get in to examine the evidence.

Just like the Branch Davidian compound at Waco was bulldozed by the
government
before any evidence could be examined.

Conclusion: This was a highly skilled endeavor by a large group of
well-trained
people with access to the buildings, the airplanes and the explosives. They
would have had to blend into the population and not look suspicious.

Question: Who would have these qualifications? Certainly not a large group
of
Arab "terrorists"!


Where are the "Indestructible" Black Boxes?

All four Black Boxes were supposedly destroyed and rendered unusable in
spite of
the fact that they are designed specifically for plane crashes which result
in
insurmountable conditions. In fact there are reported to be TWO Black Boxes
on
each plane, but apparently ALL EIGHT of the Black Boxes are completely
destroyed.

Strange indeed!

ABC News Reports: The Black Box is "ALMOST INDESTRUCTIBLE. IT IS DESIGNED TO
WITHSTAND HEAT OF UP TO 2,000 DEGREES FAHRENHEIT FOR ONE HOUR, salt water
for at
least 30 days, immersion in a variety of liquids such as jet fuel and
lubricants, AND AN IMPACT OF 3,400 G's. By comparison, astronauts are
typically
exposed to up to six Gs during a shuttle takeoff."

Yet CNN reported that "In New York, several blocks from the ruins of the
World
Trade Center, a passport authorities said belonged to one of the hijackers
was
discovered a few days ago, according to city Police Commissioner Bernard
Kerik."

The paper passport apparently survived intact!

The "indestructible Black Boxes were destroyed!

Hmmm!


Who Has Claimed Responsibility?

Within HOURS after the attack the U.S. was aggressively touting Osama bin
Laden
as the "terrorist" responsible for this dastardly deed. As one writer to a
popular website noted, "I find it laughable that the agency notorious for
its
inability to find a bleeding elephant in a snowbank suddenly (within hours
of
the attack) has the culprit pinpointed!"

The media continuously whips up the public to indiscriminate hatred of
almost
any Arab. On radio, on TV, in the newspapers and in magazines, all one hears
or
reads is HATE towards Osama bin Laden, or any other Muslim. The Globe, a
well-known grocery store rag, contains pictures of Osama Bin Laden with
rifle
"cross-hairs" targeted over his face and a soldier in fatigues pointing an
automatic rifle at his head. Yet these same media outlets pompously demand
the
elimination of "hate!"

It is USUAL and CUSTOMARY for Terrorist groups to claim responsibility for
an
attack. Yet no such claim has been made.

Osama bin Laden says he didn't do it. "We have been blamed in the past, but
we
were not involved," he said. (The Guardian - London 9-17-01)

"Egyptian President Mubarak still has not seen bin Laden proof," according
to a
Paris AFP report. "Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak says he has not seen any
proof of Osama bin Laden being "the brains" behind the terrorist attacks on
the
United States and warns Washington against over-hasty reprisals, in a
newspaper
interview published on 9-24-01.

Saddam Hussein, in a letter to the American People noted that "when the
event
took place, Arab rulers and the rulers of countries whose religions is
Islam,
rushed to condemn the event." (Iraqi News Agency 916-01)

There are even reports that Osama bin Laden has been, and may still now be,
an
operative of the U.S. CIA.

And now, according to The Washington Post (9-25-01), The U.S. is now
"Unsure" of
Going Public with the "Proof" of Osama bin Laden's responsibility for the
"terrorist" attack. With the U.S. public, and other nations, demanding
proof,
the Bush administration is hiding behind the cloak of "National Security."

Secretary of State Colin Powell promised that the U.S. "soon" would "put out
a
paper. . that will describe quite clearly the evidence that we have linking"
bin
Laden to the attacks on the World Trade Center and Pentagon. But Rep. Porter
Goss (R-Fla), chairman of the House Permanent Select Committee on
Intelligence,
said that the administration cannot present its full case "without revealing
some sources and methods that we would not want to reveal." HOW INTERESTING
AND
CONVENIENT FOR THEM!


Now Let's Consider - Are There Other Countries, besides the Arabs, who have
ever
been involved in terrorism?

According to the Washington Report, "In 1967 on the fourth day of the Six
Day
War, the armed forces of Israel attacked the American intelligence ship USS
Liberty for 90 minutes in international waters in broad daylight following
several hours of close, low-level reconnaissance. Thirty-four men died, 171
were
hurt, and the ship was so badly damaged that it had to be scrapped.

The government of Israel has lied about the circumstances ever since,
telling a
story markedly different from that told by American survivors. Congress has
refused to question Israel's demonstrably false account.

Why would Israel risk alienating its American friends? Why did Israel
attack?

According to eyewitness accounts by Israeli officers and journalists, the
Israeli Army executed as many as 1,000 Arab prisoners during the 1967 war.
Historian Gabby Bron wrote in the Yediot Ahronot in Israel that he witnessed
Israeli troops executing Egyptian prisoners on the morning of June 8, 1967,
in
the Sinai town of El Arish, including about 150 Egyptian POWs. They made the
prisoners dig their own graves then they were shot as they stood at the edge
of
the grave.

As those executions were underway, America's most sophisticated intelligence
platform, USS Liberty, was less than 13 miles from El Arish, close enough to
see
the town mosque with the naked eye. With binoculars one could make out
individual buildings and might have seen the executions if one had looked in
the
right place.

The attack on the USS Liberty lasted 75 minutes. It was not brief nor
accidental
as Israel claims. The Israelis wantonly destroyed life rafts in the water
and
they jammed international radio distress frequencies while Americans, who
might
have been saved, died!

The United States is no stranger to perpetrating acts of terrorism against
other
countries. The U.S. bombed Iraq unmercifully during the Gulf War. Thousands
of
private citizens were slaughtered. Then a deadly embargo was put in place to
destroy them slowly by illness and starvation. What was the crime of the
common
people?

The U.S. CIA has also been involved in covert wars all over the globe,
raping
and pillaging entire economies of Central American and other countries.

In addition, the U.S. is not above turning on its own citizens with
vengeance.

FDR Knew About Pearl Harbor: John Flynn made a sound case for Roosevelt's
foreknowledge in 1946, the historian Charles Beard confirmed it in 1948 with
his
book FDR and the Coming of the War 1941. John Toland told the story in
Infamy in
the early 1980s, and John Stinnett followed with Day of Deceit. They all
understood FDR's manipulation of, and complicity in, the attack on Pearl
Harbor.
It was done to incite the U.S. citizens to hate the Japanese and push them
to
support the U.S. entry into World War II.

And it worked beautifully! Americans willingly gave their own lives and the
lives of their sons to fight a war that had nothing to do with them.

FDR knew in advance of the attack on Pearl Harbor. Not only did he refuse to
stop it, he encouraged it by his manipulative treatment of Japan prior to
the
attack, and his stationing of ships in the Hawaiian port, an easy target for
the
Japanese. (Antiwar.com)

It worked magnificently then - and it is working magnificently now!

Other acts of violence that must be considered are: The Randy Weaver family
killings by the U.S. government in Idaho, the Waco horror where the U.S.
shot,
bulldozed and set on fire its own citizens, and the Oklahoma bombing, where
there is abundant information pointing to U.S. Government involvement .

Why would a government plan an attack its own citizens, while blaming
another?

What would it have to gain?

The answer is: EVERYTHING!


Go back and review what has happened SINCE the attack:

The U.S. Government has dramatically increased its control over the American
population while destroying the rights of the people, a situation necessary
for
the takeover of the U.S. and eventually, all other countries, by the New
World
Order to be run by the United Nations. And they're doing it with the
citizens'
complete support.

"The President has the power to seize property, organize and control the
means
of production, seize commodities, assign military forces abroad, call
reserve
forces amounting to 2 1/2 million men to duty, institute martial law, seize
and
control all means of transportation, regulate all private enterprise,
restrict
travel, and in a plethora of particular ways, control the lives of ALL
Americans...While the danger of a dictatorship arising through legal means

A SURE ROAD TO DICTATORSHIP!

U.S. Attorney General John Ashcroft Seeks Sweeping Powers!

"The United States will remain vulnerable to terrorist attacks unless law
enforcement agencies are given a wide range of new counterterrorism tools,
including improved wiretap capabilities and easier access to voice mail and
Internet user's personal information, Attorney General John Ashcroft told
lawmakers Monday." (MSNBC
9-25-01)

A third of New Yorkers support internment camps (concentration camps) for
"individuals who authorities identify as being sympathetic to terrorist
causes,"
according to a poll form the Siena College Research Institute. (Newsday.com
9-25-01) (Remember that President Bush has said that if you don't support
the
U.S. government 100% in their handling of this situation - - - YOU ARE
SIDING
WITH THE TERRORISTS!)

Public Opinion has overwhelming turned from support for the Arabs and
against
Israel, to supporting Israel and their ally, the U.S. and hatred against the
Arab countries.

And now the U.S. has the support of the entire nation, and much of the
world,
for its unrestrained unleashing of vengeance on ANY and EVERY Arab nation.

But it's not surprising that the U.S. and Israel are the ONLY countries
where
the majority backs a military strike (Reuters 9-22-01).

>From Stern.Intel: Israeli Mossad Links to World Trade Center Attack: "A
U.S.
military intelligence source revealed details of an internal intelligence
memo
that points to the Israeli Mossad intelligence service having links to the
World
Trade Center and Pentagon attacks...

"The attacks have certainly turned U.S. public opinion firmly back in
Israel's

Lebanese Druze Leader Believes CIA, Mossad Responsible for U.S. Attacks!
Lebanon's anti-Syrian Druze leader Walid Jumblatt believes the CIA and
Israel's
secret service Mossad are behind the terrorist attacks in the United States,
and
that Saudi extremist Osama bin Laden is an "American agent," newspaper
reports
said. (Beirut AFP 9-15-01)

Fake Terror has been the Road to Dictatorship
for thousands of years.
It's the oldest trick in the book, dating back to Roman times.

Create the enemies you need!

A wise philosopher has unveiled the irony of it all: "To restore our
freedom, we
will need to be deprived of it. To recover from senseless murder, we will
need
to perpetrate more of it," or so says the President.

So, Who's Responsible?

The Answer is: Who Benefits?

You figure it out!

Note: If all of this is discouraging to you, there is a Bright Side. Human
governments ARE NOT MEANT to work well. They will ALL fail.

The last paragraph of this morning's NY TIMES article on the possible
discovery of a "language" or language-centered gene quotes a skeptic who
remarks that the discovery supplies "soft support, though not hard support"
for Noam Chomsky's thesis on the innateness of language.

Does anybody else out there sense a new anthology war bubbling up through
that binary????

hi lawrence:  i think it was ron who used the term "abandon Israel"
in his long post "what is to be done."  you responded, as i recall,
by saying something like, you didn't see why the US couldn't do so.
yes, "abandon" is a dramatic word and one that made me have to
re-examine my easy and pro-forma anti-zionism.

Dear Friends,

Although Gellu Naum's death has already been reported to the
Poetics List, I thought members of the list and friends of Green
Integer and Sun & Moon Press would be interested in the short
obituary which appeared in the New York Times this morning
(October 4th).

Gellu Naum, a leading Surrealist literary figure here (Burcharest),
died on Saturday of a heart attack. He was 86.
     During a career as a poet, playwright and translator that lasted
more than 65 years, Mr. Naum published 20 books of poetry, numerous
plays and a novel.
     Born in 1915, and the son of a poet, Mr. Naum studied philosophy
in Burcharest and Paris, publishing his first poetry book, The =
Incendiary
Traveler, in 1936. He was recognized worldwide as a prominent=20
Surrealist, and his works were translated into English, German, French
and other languages; his Surrealist novel, Zenobia, was published in
1985. Mr. Naum also translated works by Beckett, Ren=E9 Char, Jacques
Pr=E9vert and Kafka into Romanian.
     He received numerous international and national awards for his =
work,=20
including the 1999 European Prize for Poetry.


Naum's novel is available from Northwestern University Press. Green =
Integer,
moreover, published his autobiographal collage and assisted cut-up =
"pohem"
My Tired Father. In honor of Naum's memory, we are offering My Tired =
Father
to members of this list for a 20% discount. If you send a check for =
$7.16 (the orignal
price is $8.95) plus $1.50 for postage (total $8.66) we will be happy to =
send you
a copy of this wonderful book. Please write checks to Douglas Messerli =
(not Green
Integer) at 6026 Wilshire Boulevard, Los Angeles, CAlifornia 90036. Be =
sure to
include your name and address.

While yes, I would agree that some amount of dissent
is allowed in Israel, I wanted to offer this one
anecdote: when I lived there in 1987, I listened to a
radio station which broadcast in English as "the Voice
of Peace" and always said they were broadcasting "from
somewhere in the Mediterranean."  It was a kind of
pirate radio station that was leftist and played
hippie music and had arts programming, and was the
alternative to the state-run radio station which had
solider DJs.  They had to broadcast from a boat that
kept moving because the Israeli gov't was always
trying to shut them down.  I believe it doesn't exist
at all anymore.  Where is "the Voice of Peace" when
you need it?!

Thousands / Laird Hunt

A new CD from Immanent Audio, released September, 2001.

Two Half-Dreams

1. A pale hand lurking in a forest of pencils. Every now and then it
tears up a pencil and scribbles something on the ground.

2. The Tower of Babel has been only partially destroyed. Half of
infinity is infinity. I am standing on one of its cracked pillars
peering down.

I suspect that the more rational faction within the Bush administration has
prevailed, if it has prevailed, in part because there has been so much
adverse comment, some of it in the form of peace rallies, on the
bloodthirstiness of Bush's first comments. But if not, even if it's all
unnecessary effort, don't you think it's better to try to avert horrific
bloodshed than to protest against it after the fact?

Washington, D.C., sponsored by "International A.N.S.W.E.R." (Act Now to
Stop War & End Racism), I was left with a rather odd conclusion: The
protesters hadn't watched enough CNN. I mean, I'm sure they were glued to
the news on September 11th like all the rest of us, watching the trade
towers collapse again and again, and hearing some U.S. foreign policy
luminaries, like Lawrence Eagleburger, call for sweeping retribution. But
after September 12th or 13th, the demonstrators, many of them students,
appear to have switched off. One of the countless protest signs I saw --
and one of the few sarcastic ones -- read "Rush In, Think Later." This is
precisely what the Bush administration has not done, though it's hard to
say the same of certain peaceniks.
>
>Such is the paradox of a preemptive peace march, a protest that critiques
the logic of revenge before retributive action has even been attempted.
Sure, there are situations where one should protest something before it
happens -- but the thing being protested should at least be a likely
outcome. That's not true in this case. Whatever military response the Bush
administration and its allies may be planning, we are certainly not talking
about any Vietnam-style napalming of innocents. Indeed, the United States
is already providing aid to Afghan refugees. Yet because today's peace
movement has taken to the streets so prematurely, it is forced to rely on
dubious presumptions about the American psyche and how it will respond,
murderously, to future events.
>
>Granted, from a peacenik perspective, it's indisputable that shortly after
the World Trade Center attacks, quite a lot of Americans were sounding
alarmingly bloodthirsty. One of the most disturbing, but least criticized,
screeds came from Time magazine's Lance Morrow, who wrote, in a column
titled "The Case for Rage and Retribution," that we ought to "explore the
rich reciprocal possibilities of the fatwa."
>
>But no one, not Morrow or any other commentator who embarrassed himself
with unchecked rage, was operating with a full deck that awful week. After
all, much of America wasn't even sleeping at night. Since then, however, it
has clearly dawned on the Bush administration that the goal of defeating
international terrorism cannot possibly be furthered by bombing the hell
out of starving Afghans. This realization could be observed in the careful
tones of Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld Sunday morning on Meet the Press:
>

alive. Do we have a preference?

retaliation or retribution or even justice. I think about it as -- I think
back to real wars, the goal is victory. The goal is to be able to have
dealt with the problems that exist--in this case, the terrorist networks
and the countries that harbor them--in a way that we have won; that in fact
they are no longer free to go out and terrorize the world.
>It's worth contrasting Rumsfeld's caution with the International Answer
protesters' repeated, hyperbolic denunciations of this nation's new "racist
war." Put aside the fact that there is no military action yet to protest,
and little reason to suppose that knee-jerk cries for revenge will drive
U.S. policy. The notion that U.S. military action, when it comes, will be
somehow "racist" is absurd. The protesters seem to have conflated isolated
instances of hate crimes against Arab and Muslim Americans with the Bush
administration's "war on terrorism" -- this despite the fact that Bush has
repeatedly denounced such violence and emphasized that we should not think
of our current conflict as one between Islam and "the West."
>
>But then, we shouldn't expect much charity toward the president from
protesters capable of airing slogans like "The Real Terrorist Works in the
White House." I consider George W. Bush a dim bulb, even an impostor -- and
certainly oppose many aspects of his foreign policy -- but calling him a
terrorist is a truly vile form of moral equivalency. Yet it frequently fit
the tone of the protests, where I watched some organizers label those who
disagreed with them undercover government agents, and one 21-year-old told
me, in his pacifism, that we shouldn't have fought Hitler.
>
>Devout word watchers may have noted that journalists and others have taken
to using "enormity" to describe the events of September 11th, as though it
were the only word in the language capable of conveying the true, unique
horror of that day. By contrast, to the peace protesters, everything is now
a form of "terrorism," from U.S. sanctions on Iraq to the layoffs of
workers ("economic terrorism"). Almost the only thing the protesters didn't
widely denounce, amid a plethora of IMF/World Bank grievances, was radical
Muslim fundamentalism. Indeed, it seemed as though the only time Osama bin
Laden came up at all was when protesters were observing that the CIA helped
train him. So it's no surprise that politically, at least, they shared some
of his explicit objectives: "It's U.S. Troop Proximity to Mecca & Medina,
Stupid!" "U.S. Out of the Middle East!"
>
>But I still keep coming back to that sign, "Rush In, Think Later." I think
about its holder, and try to imagine what was running through his or her
mind. (I should have just asked, but it didn't occur to me at the moment.)
Protests themselves may take weeks to organize, but protest signs take just
minutes to draw up. There must have been something instinctive and
deep-seated behind that slogan, for its creator to be able to twist reality
so starkly, rushing in to protest U.S. haste long after our government
showed caution. Dare one suggest -- without cramming stars and stripes down
anyone's throat -- that it is the blindly held creed of anti-Americanism?

Copper Canyon is about to issue a bilingual anthology of contemporary
Mexican poetry.

My own Junction Press is working on two bilingual anthologies:

_Al otro lado/ Across the Line: The Poetry of Baja California_, edited by
Harry Polkinhorn y yo, should be available in February. It seems to be
heading for 416 pages.

_The Revolution in Cuban Poetry: 1944 to the Present_, edited by Alina
Camacho-Gingerich y yo tambien, will be over 600 pages. Expect it in early
2003.

I'm also translating a bilingual selected Jos=E9 Kozer (great,
internationally recognized, Cuban exile poet), due from Junction somewhere
in between the two anthologies.

Junction published a bilingual selection of Argentine poet Luisa
Futoransky, _The Duration of the Voyage/La duraci=F3n del viaje_, edited and
translated by Jason Weiss, in 1997. It's been adopted for a lot of
classroom use, but I'm afraid it's not being read by many anglophone poets.
Cover price is $11.00, plus $2.00 shipping (in US). Lop off 20% for list
members.

Richard, I didn't think I was making any comment on the " 'more of the same'
versus 'qualitative change' " debate--only forwarding a review of Empire.
You may have taken the reviewer's excerpted comments as mine? Oddly,
Marjorie Perloff's hermeneutics may coincide with those of everyone's
favourite Eugene, Oregon anarchist John Zerzan, on the question of
interpreting "the event" as an attack on civilization as such. (Selections
from Zerzan's writing, which may not be familiar to left/ultraleft writers
here, are available at: http://www.spunk.org/library/writers/zerzan and
http://recollectionbooks.com/siml/library/JohnZerzan/zercon.html). But why
haven't we heard more from Taylor Brady this last week? I hope he hasn't
vacated in disgust at the unexpected enactments of jingoism presented to us
on this list. I'm waiting to read more anaylsis from him. Well, back to my
Inman & Poulantzas.

Here's a statement from Jameson, also from the London Review of Books.
http://www.lrb.co.uk/v23/n19/mult2319.htm#jameson

Fredric Jameson
North Carolina

I have been reluctant to comment on the recent 'events' because the event in
question, as history, is incomplete and one can even say that it has not yet
fully happened.

Obviously there are immediate comments one can make, in particular on the
nauseating media reception, whose cheap pathos seemed unconsciously dictated
by a White House intent on smothering the situation in sentiment in order to
demonstrate the undemonstrable: namely, that 'Americans are united as never
before since Pearl Harbor.' I suppose this means that they are united by the
fear of saying anything that contradicts this completely spurious media
consensus.

Historical events, however, are not punctual, but extend in a before and
after of time which only gradually reveal themselves. It has, to be sure,
been pointed out that the Americans created bin Laden during the Cold War
(and in particular during the Soviet war in Afghanistan), and that this is
therefore a textbook example of dialectical reversal. But the seeds of the
event are buried deeper than that. They are to be found in the wholesale
massacres of the Left systematically encouraged and directed by the
Americans in an even earlier period. The physical extermination of the Iraqi
and the Indonesian Communist Parties, although now historically repressed
and forgotten, were crimes as abominable as any contemporary genocide. It
is, however, only now that the results are working their way out into
actuality, for the resultant absence of any Left alternative means that
popular revolt and resistance in the Third World have nowhere to go but into
religious and 'fundamentalist' forms.

As for the future, no one (presumably including our own Government) has any
idea what the promised and threatened 'war on terrorism' might look like.
But until we know that, we can have no satisfactory picture of the 'events'
we imagine to have taken place on a single day in September. Despite this
uncertainty, however, it is permitted to feel that the future holds nothing
good for either side.

Joe,

I'm glad to hear that our American amnesia reflex
isn't affecting every citizen.  Yes, there actually
was a September 10th, and a 9th, and an 8th,  and ---
although myself a Manhattanite as deeply disoriented
by trauma and mourning as any of us who have been left
physically unscathed, comparatively insulated by
living on The Palisades, --- I too believe that this
summer's List heteronym meltdown is important enough
(tactically identical to "terrorist" theft of names of
the dead, noms-de-guerre) for the subject not to be
dropped too easily, despite the eclipsing.  Maybe
~more~ important now to be looked at.  It is, in its
own way, a literary-historical extension of the
post-Language/Language rejection of the
subject-position.  Can heteronyms cry better than
their authors?

Strangely, some of the parties most strongly
denouncing the latest presumed heteronym stink bomb
were, in August, intimately involved in sustaining and
~commissioning~ identity theft.

Apparently, the end-of-August/beginning-of-September
line that marked the boiling-over point of the
heteronym expose' here coincides with the return to
campus of a largely .edu-populated List, and many
signed back in simply oblivious/indifferent to how hot
summer got.  (There's a definite List member tendency
to enter ~in media res,~ too, simply checking back in,
seeing what's being discussed right at the surface
that day, that week, without looking further into what
might have been larger dilemmas or the real, ongoing
field of action.  Das ungluckliche Kind der
Augenblicke [sp.?].)

I really feel that some public forum on the heteronym
"crisis" is called for.  The List may not be adequate,
with its many threads, and comings and goings (~and~
its heteronym subversion, so that you can't tell who
you're talking to half the time)..  I'm sorry I'm not
being an editor right now.  It's reached the
proportions that demand some sort of colloquium or
"special issue" devoted to the question.

Meanwhile, I personally am ~of mixed feelings.~

What seemed wrong to me this summer was the identity
theft (with its near-criminality), the character
assasination, the homophobia, the hate literature and,
perhaps, the tombstone vandalization that was being
carried out under heteronyms (and allonyms: Ruthven).

On the other hand, in pure theory, it strikes me as
one of the most ingenious, liberatory language games
I've encountered since Clark Coolidge's return to a
Gertrude Stein English and the asyntactical Language
that grew out of that.  There are many conflicts that
I experience in regard to my public roles, and they
could more conveniently be handled by simply assigning
different noms-de-plume to each foot I maintain in
opposing camps.

What I do not understand (and what I would encourage
heteronymists to "purge" their movement of) is the
ugliness and bad spirit that emerges once the mask of
a fake name is in place. A sort of Freddy Kruger
hockey mask Halloween effect.  The reasons for the
gushing biliousness that's almost a giveaway of
heteronyms seems complex, and deeply psychoanalytical.
 In essence, I see it as just the individual
practitioners' "unresolved material"; in general, it's
been marked by certain distinct psychologisms:
scatologies of infantile anality, homosexual panic,
etc.

Personally, the kind of heteronyms I find myself
daydreaming are granola- and brown rice-eating, vegan,
Birkenstock, Naropa sensitives.

Note, too (with underlining, please): from those whose
double/multiple identities I've been able to trace
down, it also seems to remain an exclusively ~male~
game (and heterosexual male).  There must be important
feminist, gender reasons (that Marcella or Elizabeth
or others could delineate better than I) for that:
women are already under their own name = property
politics with married names, etc.; if women are indeed
more rooted in the body (cyclic hormonal) and the
sobering, reality-heavy chain of
mother-daughter-granddaughter than men are, heteronym
pranks would seem too illusory in their escapism.
(Please don't get on my case, girls, over my
tongue-tiedness on feminist themes.  I mean well.  You
just can't expect too raised a consciousness from even
us men [pr--ks] of good intentions.)

And then I think about how much of it is
e-mail/web-centered,--- and the initial materialist
determinant seems close at hand: passwords!  The
technology's very password system itself fosters a
make-believe name mentality.

The List stats of 900 members is surely a figure
swollen with fake name sign-ons.

Different avowed heteronymists will espouse completely
different motives for the same tactic: some political,
some philosophical . . .

Poetry, especially our micro-poetic world here, seems
a very poor place from which to launch a fantasized
heteronym revolution.  Avant-garde poetry ~does not~
have sufficient or efficient enough effect on the
world at large for the 'nym scandals to have much
outward consequences.  (In my identity as an
~astrologer,~ on the other hand, it took only the
slightest public presence before I was hearing out of
nowhere from the BBC to do televised horoscope spots
on Sandra Bernhard, Quentin Crisp.)

There are many sides to this issue.

When my left hand was injured in early May, and I
found myself totally confined within the boundaries of
being wounded --- a sense of ~inescapability~ set in
about the limitations of my finite identity, and that
"imprisonment" within reality is very antithetical to
the imaginary scissiparity of assuming pen names.

Hey, The Star-Spangled Banner was written ~during~
Key's imprisonment (aboard ship)!  It may be at the
~heart~ of  patriotism to understand or take upon
oneself the mystique of incarceration--- then from
there, from that single room locked cell, to speak of
"Freedom!" and "Liberty!"

I don't consider heteronymism "poetic terrorism."  It
may be "poetic ~paranoia-ism.~  The negative reaction
that it can provoke is a psychological-ontological
uncertainty about the ~very existence~ of other people
you had presumed to be "real."  (Very odd grammars
result: So-&-So is not a real person.  Viz-a-viz.:
"So-&-So is not a real man.")  (For the presumed
author of the Yasusada poems to say "I am not
Yasusada" is, paradoxically, the completely true
antithesis of Flaubert's false statement, "I am Madame
Bovary.) Is there ~no~ overlap between the heteronym
movement and the other known scams, such as the
Nigerian scam [viz. Brian Wizard]?

I'm sorry I'm being so inarticulate.  I had a beef
barley soup and a roast beef on rye for lunch, and I'm
feeling sleepy from it.

I agree that the Arudhata Roy article was annoying.  It covered all the same
anti-US territory, though at great length and with a novelist's flair (and
imagination!)  So I'm sensitive to not wanting to beat a dead whatever,
but...

In light of Lawrence Upton's proposed "solution" of dumping food and money
into the laps of Afghan peasants, I thought the following was an interesting
tidbit from today's news.   (Surely one of my more worldly-wise colleagues
will explain the arrogant nationalism behind this move.)

President Bush announced $320 million in aid to alleviate a burgeoning
refugee problem in Afghanistan.

"This is our way of saying that while we strongly and firmly oppose the
Taliban regime we are friends with the Afghan people," Bush said

Pentagon officials said the military was drawing up plans to parachute
emergency food rations to thousands of displaced people in the landlocked
central Asian country.

Special Forces allegedly began hostile operations (engaging enemy fire and
returning fire) within Afghanistan on the evening of 11 September on the
outskirts of Kabul.   They are allegedly using 5-6 man ground teams
(Rangers) from the 82nd delivered by Black Hawk choppers (called "Night
Stalkers") from the 160th with a 2 man flight crew.  Quick, decisive,
lightweight, and easy to "clean up after" in case anything goes awry, we
will likely hear little or nothing of their doings.  It was a surprise
enough that Rumsfeld even intimated that the US Gov't has already run
special ops missions in Afghanistan since the 911.

To say the US has not used force in Afghanistan to date is likely incorrect.
To say the US has dropped in forces is just not an "accepted" or "favored"
or "official" truth.

One important feature of this branch of the US Military, formed in response
to a perceived need in the aftermath of the Vietnam War for secrecy in
military ops, is to keep things quiet.  Special Ops (sometimes called "Black
Ops" or "Special Forces") is stationed right here in Fort Bragg, NC.  Its
central command, JSOC (Joint Special Operations Command), is located at Pope
AFB right next door to Bragg.  Special Forces invariably receive the full
cooperation of the "free" US media in maintaining the secrecy of their
operations.  "It is for America's own good" is the unofficial motto.  They
are especially good at preventing and removing any and all threats of
publicity in all of their actions on foreign soils.  Special Forces nowadays
usually comprises about 70-90% of all US Military operations and engagements
abroad and probably command that much of its budget as well.  They are
simply the best at what they do, at making things happen and staying out of
the media's eye.  Hell they even have body laundering systems, in case a US
Soldier's life is lost in an operation that is maintaining cover.  Usually
the family of the deceased finds out that their son or daughter died in a
plane crash during exercises in a different location (re: no remains).
Frankly, Special Ops soldiers make Ninjas and Hitler's Stormtroopers look
like a bunch of flat-headed whimps.  You do not want to be in a room with a
pissed off Special Ops Ranger or SEAL, that's for damn sure.  They're also
trained to use their brains, make decisions independently, negotiate their
way through many situations, and have extensive language training in many
cases.

   I'm going to try to muster the patience to address the points of this
paranoid rant individually -- the only thing it doesn't do is come right out
and bitch about the Zionist Occupation Government (aka the US Government),
but there's one I'll just knee-jerk on out of here in a hurry:

>>14) President Bush sent his anti-terrorism bill to Congress one week after
the WTC/Pentagon attack, launching an emotional debate that will force U.S.
politicians to choose between continued freedom for Americans or greater
security. (Lycos Network 9-20-01) DOES ANYBODY KNOW HOW LONG IT TAKES TO
WRITE ONE OF THESE BILLS? IT TAKES MONTHS! They are hundreds of pages long.
THIS
ONE WAS OBVIOUSLY WRITTEN BEFORE THE ATTACK! How convenient! Wake up
America!
(DEBKA Intelligence Files 9-22-01) >>


   I know how long it takes to write one of these bills, because I
personally have written three or four.  Writing legislation is practically
Washington DC's favorite indoor sport, since every time a lobbyist takes an
idea to the Hill, he or she is likely also to take along a draft bill.  In
addition, both the House and Senate have Offices of Legislative Counsel,
non-partisan staffs of lawyers whose whole job it is to draft or edit
legislation so that it means what the Senator or Congressman wants it to
mean.  The White House may have an equivalent specialized staff; I don't
know, but it certainly does have a bill-drafting capability.  In a crunch, a
bill can be written or rewritten overnight.

    It does not take months; they are not hundreds of pages long.  Only the
budget bills are hundreds of pages long, but they are the most familiar to
the public since everyone running for election seems to like to get his
picture taken with the volumes and volumes of them.

Arielle. They stole that idea from Radio Hauraki which was New Zealand's
first commecail or non Govt radio station. They broadcast off-shore from
Tiri Island and started to play some quite good music. Anyway it was good
and broke the mould of fusty old Government Radio.  They were termed the
"Pirate Radio Station". They are quite good: if commercial radio stations
were a little less moronic I'd be very pleased but most commercial
broadcasting  (and broadcasting in general) has declined in quality over
here...but at least we have a lot of freedom here (I know that there are
injustices and problems by and large - on the Big Balance Sheet I would go
for US and Western democracy (given someone put the "mock" in I) as the best
of a bad bunch for now).
  But that radio station in Israel was a good example...trouble is this word
"feedom" it gets bandied around....truth..as Auden wrote:  "All I have is
voice (pen?) to undo the folded lie."  The Right Wing over there wouldnt
like to hear anything about peace....to be fair Israel (as far as I know) is
not totally united in its foreign policies and not all Jewish people are
Zionists. Are all Palestinians in anti-Israel? Are some quite unconcerned
and live elsewhere and get on with their life? Does anyone know of Jews who
either are nuetral to or are opposed to Israel or dissent and so on? After
all one can be a Christian and be opposed to the Crusades (which cynics
might say are still ongoing).  The trouble is that there's always the
suspicion that Yeat's "The best lack all conviction, the worst are full of
passionate intensity." means that the heart fed on fantasy (and reality of a
kind) means some people "see red".....the whole things boils over: truth
dies valiantly, and Ed Dorn or his ilk croak dark mockingly over the the
unspirited plains...Richard.

Patrick.  This is fascinating: the bright side is, as you say, no military
power, no secret intellience, no organisation, is ubiquitous or omniscient
or omnipotent: but they can do a lot of damage. I had thought of the
implosion thing myself: the explanation given though was that the structure
in this case is not internal...I have a friend who is a civil/mechanical
engineer...I'll run that one past him: mind you he was completely convinced
that it was a
"jack up" on the day of the attacks.Probably organised by the Israeli-US
Govt agents: I see the Israelis have blown up a Tupolev: their agents
probably planted a bomb, or the Russians shot it down to generate more
enthusiasm for Russian involvement: I  see Blair is in his element: these
insipid characters thrive in these war situations....but  I'd like to learn
more of the history of Israel - I read a book years ago by a Palestinian
which was very good - but I must get some more info...  I'm not happy with a
lot of the Israeli actions: its interesting that prior to these attacks, for
the first time, some embarrassing truths about the Israelis were emerging.
This is a case where someone who is Jewish has to try to be "objective" and
so do Palestinians, but they've both been through a lot of
strife...probably withoout extremist political influence and power and oil
and warmongers: arabs and jews would live together well. I'm very interested
in this letter you've sent and I'm going to send it around.
  As you say, people will have to make up their own minds...my friend the
engineer pointed out that with the "collapse" of the Soviet Union there is
now an "enemy vacuum" ig Baad America him no has Big Bad Russia and them RED
Rooskies and them Kommoonists: now they have Muslims and TERRORISM which of
course is how capitalism keeps itself in business.
  Another thing: its certainly the case that no one can be complacent
anymore ...of whatever political ilk... I also think that the whole thing
will backfire on the imperialist powers in long run: I think of Mao Tse
Tung's dictum that the Superpowers "...are like giants who lift rocks to
drop them on their own heads, and then again, until their own doom."
  Regards, Richard.

The University of Georgia English department, represented by Lanier Chair Jed Rasula, would like to announce the first reader of the 2001 Lanier Reading Series, poet and critic Steve McCaffery.

On Wednesday, October 10th, at 2:30 in room 265 Park Hall, Steve McCaffery will give a poetry reading.

On Thursday, October 11th, at 4:30 in room 261Park Hall, Steve McCaffery will give a lecture, "The Instrumental Nightingale: Reflections on the Counter-musical from Gray to Celan".

Steve McCaffery is author of fifteen books of poetry and one novel Panopticon. He has twice received the Gertrude Stein Award for Innovative American Poetry in 1993-94 and 1994-95. Theory of Sediment was nominated for the Governor General's Award in 1992 and The Black Debt was short-listed for the 1990 Before Columbus Award. In 1973 he co-founded with the late bp Nichol the Toronto Research Group and edited Rational Geomancy: the Kids of the Book-Machine. He is author of North of Intention: Critical Writings 1973-1986, an early and influential collection of essays about experimental writing in Canada and the U.S. He is co-editor with Jed Rasula of Imagining Language, a substantial, annotated anthology that gathers two millennia of conjecture on the written and spoken sign. His collection of critical writings, Prior to Meaning: The Protosemantic and Poetics, and his selected poems, Seven Pages Missing (new and selected poems) have recently been released. He is currently at wor
 k on two other books: Slightly Left of Thinking which will gather poems, interviews and critical essays, and an annotated edition of his two decades of correspondence with Fluxus artist Dick Higgins. He has performed his poetry world-wide and his work has been translated into French, Spanish, Chinese, and Hungarian. He teaches poetics, critical theory, and contemporary literature at York University in Toronto.

Steve McCaffery is a major figure in contemporary poetry -- certainly one of the most innovative and conceptually challenging poets of the last twenty-five years. -- Gerald Burns

McCaffery's high-theoretical performances reclaim literary theory for engaged literary practices.  -- Charles Bernstein

Again and again McCaffery stresses the need to free poetic language from the co-option by what he calls the 'media model', the model of 'linguistic transparency' and grammatical rule --. Marjorie Perloff

In direct contrast to the conditions of classical irony, McCaffery finds its climax in the incompletest completion. That unresolvable interplay of ecstasy and lacunae defines the tenor of McCaffery's work and sets its sounds, its conditions, the contours of its bliss. Frederick Garber

Content-type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII
Content-transfer-encoding: 7BIT

Dear Friends,

W. H. Auden famously said, ". . .for poetry makes nothing happen"
and William Carlos Williams said you can't "get the news from
poetry."  These last weeks have taught us that while there is no
poetry in evil, there is knowledge and understanding in poetry (read
"literature").

The New York State Literary Curators web site,
http://www.nyslittree.org, this month includes several benefit
readings for victims of the World Trade Center disaster.  Among
them are Sistahs Underground at the Nuyorican Cafe in NYC (Oct.
6), Word Thursdays in Treadwell (Oct. 11), The World Trade Center
Relief Fund reading at the New School in NYC (October 17), and
the Gathering of the Tribes Benefit on October 20 in NYC, and
more.

And we have added a page to the littree web site -- A September
11, 2001 Forum -- click on Forum on the home page to read work
about the tragic events of September 11 from writers all over the
world.  If you would like to be included send your poetry, fiction, or
commentary to wordthur@catskill.net.  The site will be updated
biweekly.

This month we welcome venues Patrias and Writers Live! in
Brooklyn, the Soccer Hall of Fame in Oneonta, and ZuZus in
Albany.  If you'd like to see your events on the littree, send IN THE
BODY OF THE EMAIL (WE DO NOT OPEN ATTACHMENTS) to
wordthur@catskill.net.  If you're a writer and would like to be
included on the Circuit Writers page (for in-state writers) or the
Interstate Writers page (for those from elsewhere in the US), look
at the pages, follow the format, and email us your information.

Our very best to all of you,

Bertha Rogers, Site Curator
Loss Pequeno Glazier, Webmaster

>
>     War will also take a heavy toll on us.  For Americans in uniformâ?"the
>overwhelming number of whom are workers and people of colorâ?"it will be
>another Vietnam.  It will generate further terror in this country
>against Arabs, Muslims, South Asians, people of color and immigrants,
>and erode our civil liberties.
>
>     It will redirect billions to the military and corporate executives,
>while draining such essential domestic programs as education, health

>will be a pretext for imposing â?oausterityâ? on labor and poor people
>under the guise of â?onational unity.â?
>
>     War will play into the hands of religious fanaticsâ?"from Osama bin
Laden
>to Jerry Falwellâ?"and provoke further terrorism in major urban centers

Who benefits - how about Patrick Herron.  The same type of things were
placed into circulation by the right wing militias after the Oklahoma City
bombing.  What next - supermarket tabloids blaming aliens from beyond the

to follow-up a bit on my earlier post (and in light of backchannel
developments that would seem to confirm, again, the presence
hereabouts of any number of aliased identities---who again, would
seek to upset any more civil deliberations, and i'll set aside the
theoretical at the moment):

we're closing in on halloween, as i just posted one subscriber
backchannel, so maybe it would be appropriate if we all flocked over
to hotmail etc., and set up accounts to establish pseudo/heteronyms,
and amplified (or is it neutralized?) the little tactics of the
self-elected few around here by pretending to be any number of
whoevers?... by way of terrifying the bejeezus out of one another?...
or?...

that way, ysee, the poetix list subscription would jump to maybe, oh,
4 or 5000, no doubt eating up considerable processing/moderating
power (that's machine and human power, assuming we posted 4 or 5 x
more)... and we could play out the contours of this little, uhm,
utopia by titillating one another with how good we are at pretending
to be who we are not, or who we would wish to be, or whoever... all
courtesy of the alphabet...

really, it's not hard, happens every day on any number of moo's
(etc.)... or maybe those interested ought to migrate to moo-space?...
hmmm...

any takers?...

after which (i assume the novelty would wear off in relatively short
order, but who knows?), we could get back to the difficulties we're
all experiencing in living our lives in a violent world?... or do any
of you think putting on others by deploying personae? or is it
role-playing? or is it passing? (or is it upsetting the evil
suny/buffalo empire, who brings us this list?) might help us navigate
those difficulties?... i mean, theater is one thing, gaming is
another, and passing quite another?... is passing something that we
need at this moment in social-cultural time?... will this make us
better people?... is this pertinent?... are any of you actors?... is
there a difference?... is this really what e.g. pessoa imagined?...
or is this beyond his wildest dreams?... what's at stake here?...
more fluid identities?... or more deception (self-deception
included)?... or both?...

uh-oh, there i go, getting hypothetical, the first step toward the
theoretical...

so anyway, what about it?... shall we proceed now together to the
next generation?... as i say, it probably won't last too awful
long... and when we get this out of our systemS, maybe we can figure
out what's really important, urgent, necessary... or is it already
OUT of our systems?...

5    THE NEW TRADITIONALISTS COMPOSITIONAL AND IMPROVISATIONAL MUSIC
The New Traditionals Compositional and Improvisational Music. Contemporary
folk-pop and progressive instrumentalists, solos and duets, featuring
saxophonist MARLON ARIOLA with drummer RYAN SAWYER, clarinetist PATRICK
HOLMES with violist DYLAN WILLESMA, and songwriter/ guitarist/ vocalist THEO
EASTWIND. Each musician is in pursuit of a personally defined mode of
expression that represents and transcends the preeminent styles of the
instrument based on Modern American Music. This is a night of acoustic
music, St. Mark's "unplugged" as it were. A pared-down evening of
progressive jazz hybrids and sing-along American folk-rock. Everybody's
chops have been honed religiously in the streets and subway tunnels of NYC.
[10:30 P.M.]

8    AARON KUNIN AND CORT DAY
AARON KUNIN teaches film, curates the Mellon Poetry Seminar at Johns Hopkins
and is currently at work on a Ph.D. in the English department at Duke
University, where he specializes in the Renaissance. His poems have appeared
in The Germ, Jubilat, and Pierogi Press. Kunin's experimental fiction
explores the interior design of ideas while his poetry blurs the boundaries
between translation and creation. CORT DAY's work has appeared in numerous
journals, including American Letters and Commentary, Boston Review, Colorado
Review, Fence, and Verse. His first collection of poems, The Chime, was
published by Alice James Books earlier this year. "... Cort Day has produced
a work of transgressive imaginings, calls and responses, chimes and echoes.
It is a work by turns, humorous and darkly erotic, where the ships of reason
burn on an ocean tuned to an open frequency." -Michael Palmer [8:00 P.M.]

10    FANNY HOWE AND KIMBERLY LYONS
FANNY HOWE, poet and novelist, teaches at the University of California San
Diego. She is the author of numerous publications including The Quietist,
Saving History, Deep North, The End, One Crossed Out, Nod, and Forged. Her
most recent collection of poetry, Selected Poems, is just out from the
University of California Press and her most recent novel, Indivisible, is
published by Semiotext(e). Rain Taxi calls her "one of contemporary
America's most innovative poets" and states that "her work deserves wider
recognition and readership." And the Chicago Review instructs "...the
intrigued reader has no excuse: get your hands on one of [Howe's] books, and
get cracking." KIMBERLY LYONS is the author of Abracadabra (Granary Books,
2000). Mark Wallace wrote in Rain Taxi (online): "The work has an
understated precision of detail, as well as meditative subtlety." Lewis
Warsh said of Abracadabra, "a real opening, a step onwards." Her work was
recently translated into French for the inaugural issue of Double Change
(www.doublechange.com), a French/English online literary magazine. She has
been anthologized in An Anthology of New (American) Poets (Talisman House),
and The Portable Boog Reader (Booglit)[8:00 P.M.]

The people who died in the World Trade Center attack were all good people
and went to Heaven. They died but did not suffer. They died because Jesus
Christ called them to Heaven. They went to Paradise as proclaimed in the
Holy Books. They are attended by many servants. They play harps. They are
among the blessed.

The people who died in the World Trade Center attack did not receive final
rites. They will wander the world forever. They will wander until they are
reborn. They are suffering without extreme unctions. Whether they are good
or bad, they are suffering and suffering. They are in Purgatory. They are
reborn as mendicants. They are hungry ghosts. They are red dust.

The people who died in the World Trade Center attack were evil. They
deserved to die. They were infidels. They were capitalists. They were
unbelievers. They will go to Hell forever. They are permanently dead. They
are reborn as vermin. They howl forever because of their terrible deeds.

The people who died in the World Trade Center attack were neither good nor
evil. They were like any of us. They died because they happened to be
there. There is no god and there is no order in the world. They will not
be reborn. They are gone forever. They are not in heaven or hell. They
have no souls and nothing will remain of them.

The people who died in the World Trade Center attack died because of the
unborn which we are killing in unprecedented numbers. They died because of
gay rights and feminists. They died because the liberals have let this
country go too soft. They died because there are too many people here who
aren't patriotic. They died because this country is Godless.

The people who died in the World Trade Center attack were fated to die
there. It was their destiny and has nothing to do with their ethics. They
died because they had to die. Perhaps they are reborn and perhaps they are
in heavens or hells. They died because it was their fate.

The people who died in the World Trade Center attack died for something.
They died for freedom or something else. They did not die in vain. They
died for some future goal. They died for some future good. We do not know
why they died. It is not for us to know.

The people who died in the World Trade Center attack died for reasons
known to God. God is good and powerful. God would never do wrong. We
cannot question God or His ways. We cannot hope to understand Him. We can
only hope to live within His Grace.

The people who died in the World Trade Center attack just died. There is
no reason for it. Reason has nothing to do with it. The people died
because of history and politics. The people died because of a madman's
psychosis. They died because of a clash of civilizations. They died
because of paranoid behavior.

The people who died in the World Trade Center attack died at the hands of
a cult. They died because of one man. They died because of a conspiracy.
They died because of rogue nations. They died because other people wanted
to destroy the World Trade Center and everything it stoods for. They died
because other people wanted us to suffer. They died because other people
wanted them to suffer.

There is no reason for anything. Causes are broken causes. At the limit of
understanding, understanding disinvests. At the limit of understanding,
the concept of understanding itself is annihilated. It is not incompre-
hensible; it escapes comprehension. It is part of the substance of the
world. We are all part of the world's substance and the word's substance.

We cannot reside at the limit. We construct. Everyone has narratives which
help them survive. The trajectory of the narrative has nothing to do with
the inertness of the world.

With the World Trade Center attack, we have come face to face with this
inertness. It is as if inertness speaks. Its mouth is filled with dust.
It is incomprehensible. Its mouth is filled with dust.

THE GLOBE AND MAIL, Friday, October 5, 2001 ? Page A17 COMMENT

The fear of thinking

By RICK SALUTIN

If truth is the first casualty in war, I guess we can now say humour is the
second. Poor Bill Maher of Politically Incorrect continues to be pilloried
in the U.S., from the White House down, for bravely raising questions on
what cowardice and bravery are. Jay Leno, David Letterman and Saturday Night
Live agonize over how hard it is to be funny in times like these, and do
they dare? Up here, Rick Mercer withdrew his Gemini nomination for his
hilarious interviews with Americans -- at exactly the time when pointing out
general ignorance in the U.S. about the rest of the world would be a public
service. On the upside, Frank magazine has not shirked its duty to deal with
the grim realities, nor has the American humour mag The Onion ("Hugging up
76,000%"; "U.S urges bin Laden to form nation it can attack").

Many of us tend to associate funny with smart and, on that basis, I nominate
as the third casualty thought itself, especially when it's sharp and
critical. Listen to this call not to think from the National Post: "If we
are to be a reliable partner . . . our ruling caste must disabuse itself of
the fallacy that to be a good Canadian, one must be skeptical or even
hostile to America." Must not be skeptical -- when thinking about a crucial
national issue? Yet I'd say it's a widespread sentiment, judging by reader
mail. Beyond the usual thoughtful disagreements, I'm hearing a new note that
says not You're dead wrong, but How dare you even raise these questions?

It's as if a set of official propositions has been laid down: We are good.
They are evil. It's a war. Only one side can survive. No other factors or
analysis apply. Those who don't accept these propositions are fools or
worse. Anyone skeptical about these articles of faith, better watch it. I'm
not saying the mood is universal -- happily it isn't -- but it's out there.

I asked a friend from a Catholic background why this mood has taken hold.
She said it's obviously a religious response of a primitive or
fundamentalist type. People who feel panic, fear or terror often seize on
simple beliefs and cling to them. Beliefs are potent, yet they are
precarious -- precisely because they are often held either without or
despite any evidence. Those who hold them don't want to hear questions or
doubts, because it will shake that tenuous security. This doesn't just
happen with religion, nor is this the only form religion takes; rather, it's
about the role played by simplistic beliefs at harsh moments.

Thought is the enemy of other forms of simplistic belief, too, such as
racial or cultural generalizations. So it's not surprising that the latter
tend to re-emerge in times like these. Robert Fulford wrote that "Muslims
show a greater propensity for war than any of the other disputatious
civilizations now competing." A propensity for war? Among 1.3 billion
different people? Margaret Wente said, "Anti-Semitism is so entrenched
throughout the Muslim world that no peace settlement will ever quench it."
Ever? Aside from the past 50 years, the record of the Muslim world on Jews
is probably far better than the Christian one. A National Post editorial
found it "hard to get worked up about the occasional slur" at Muslims and
"something offensive about the tear-drenched press releases issued by North
American Muslim organizations." Presumably, it's less hard if your daily
routines, such as driving your cab or going shopping, have become easier to
abandon than to carry through.

Thought is also the enemy of radical terror, like suicide bombings. Think
about the five-page letter apparently found among hijacker Mohammed Atta's
belongings, a dual checklist of practical measures ("check out your weapon")
and ways to ward off doubt ("remember: it is a raid for the sake of Allah").
Shakespeare dealt a lot with this function of thought. Macbeth and Hamlet
have disabling doubts not before they decide to act violently but between
then and the deed. T. S. Eliot wrote, "Between the idea/ And the reality/
Between the motion/ And the act/ Falls the Shadow."

Recently, journalist Andrea Curtiss spoke sadly about what she sees as the
best -case scenario for the fix we're in. That's when the Bush government,
despite mirroring the rhetoric of their foe (Good versus Evil etc.) acts
coolly, as they're doing, and avoids the descent into devastation (massive
retaliation followed by more terror followed by . . .). But the price we pay
is vast restriction of our freedoms and suppression of debate, in the name
of the war against terror. The critique of globalization gets cut off, for
instance, and so do Bill Maher's wry cracks. Neither has anything to do with
terror, but it's almost impossible for those in power to resist the chance
to stifle protest and advance their agenda.

It's the Cold War all over again, when "anti-communism" was used to shut
down almost all opposition, at home and abroad. What can we do except: Keep
thinking, keep doubting, grit your teeth and laugh right through them.

Aaron -

Why are people who dissent from certain aggressive policies of the US
Government invariably labeled as "anti-US"?   To go to logical extremes to
make my point: can one not be pro-US AND be (dare I say) an enemy of the US
government at the same time?  Is the US merely the US Government?  Or is
there much more to the US than its quite mutable government?

Thanks,
Patrick

You must have missed the film of the guy whose face (except the eyes) had
been skinned; the guy whose arms were slit open to the bone; the woman shot
for failing to veil her face; the woman whipped for failing to veil her
face; the three huddled girls whose mother was shot in front of them for
asking the Taliban soldiers where she and her children should go now that
that the Taliban had commandeered her house and arrested her husband.  Me,
I've been watching CNN.  Maybe you've been watching the Disney Channel --
god knows where else you could form the opinion that the Taliban was "sad."

Subject:      The Situation of Women in Afghanistan
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii" ; format="flowed"

I'm never sure how much use signing petitions is. But since so much
of the discussion on the list lately has been related to terrorism
and Afghanistan, I thought it would be relevant to forward this
letter and petition relating to state terror against women under the
present Taliban government.

d.a.


    Subject: Afghanistan's War upon Women

This is an actual petition,  and "signatures" will be lost if you drop
the
line. I know this is too  true and so dreadful.
Please take 3 minutes out of your life to do your part.  The government
of
Afghanistan, is waging a war upon women. Since the  Taliban took power in

1996, women have had to wear burqua and have been  beaten and stoned in
public
for not having the proper attire, even if this  means simply not having
the
mesh covering in front of their eyes. One  woman was beaten to death by
an
angry mob of fundamentalists for  accidentally exposing her arm(!) .
Another
was stoned to death for trying  to leave the country with a man that was
not a
relative.

Women are  not allowed to work or even go out in public
without a male relative;  professional women such as
professors, translators, doctors, lawyers, artists  and writers have been

forced from their jobs and restricted to their  homes. Homes where a
woman is
present must have their windows painted so  that she can never be seen by

outsiders. They must wear silent shoes so  that they are never heard.
Women
live in fear of their lives for the  slightest misbehavior.

Because they cannot work, those without male  relatives or husbands are
either
starving to death or begging the street,  even
if they hold Ph.D.s. Depression is becoming so widespread that it
has  reached emergency levels. There is no way in such an extreme  Islamic

society to know the suicide rate with certainty, but relief  workers are
estimating that the suicide rate among women must be  extraordinarily
high:
those who cannot find proper medication and  treatment for severe
depression
and would rather take their lives than  live in such conditions.

At one of the rare hospitals for women, a  reporter found still, nearly
lifeless bodies lying motionless on top of  beds,
wrapped in their burqua, unwilling to speak, eat, or do anything,  but
slowly
wasting away. Others have gone mad and were seen crouched in  corners,
perpetually rocking or crying, most of them in fear. When what  little
medication that is left finally runs out, one doctor is  considering
leaving
these women in front of the president's residence as a  form of prot!est.

It is at the point where the term "human rights  violations" has
become an understatement. Husbands have the power of life and  death over

their women relatives, epecially their wives, but an angry mob  has just
as
much right to stone or beat a woman, often to death, for  exposing an
inch of
flesh or offending them in the slightest  way.

Women enjoyed relative freedom: to work, to dress generally as  they
wanted,
and to drive and appear in public alone until
only 1996.  The rapidity of this transition is the main reason for the
depression and  suicide; Women who were once educators or doctors or
simply
used to basic  human freedoms are now severely restricted and treated as
subhuman in the  name of right-wing fundamentalist Islam. It is not their

tradition or  'culture,' but it is alien to them, and it is extreme even
for
those  cultures where fundamentalism is the rule.

Everyone has a right to a  tolerable human existence, even if they are
women
in a Muslim  country.

If we can threaten military force in Kosovo the in name of human  rights
for
the sake of ethnic Albanians, citizens of the world
can  certainly express peaceful outrage at the oppression, murder and
injustice  committed against women by the Taliban.

STATEMENT: In signing this, we  agree that the current treatment of women
in
Afghanistan is completely  UNACCEPTABLE and deserves action by the United

Nations and that the  current situation
overseas will not be tolerated. Women's Rights is not a  small issue
anywhere,
and it is UNACCEPTABLE for women in 2001 to be  treated as subhuman and
as so
much property. Equality and human decency is  a fundamental RIGHT, not a
freedom to be granted, whether one lives in  Afghanistan or elsewhere.

ON RECEIVING NEWS OF THE WAR

         Snow is a strange white word.
         No ice or frost
         Has asked of bud or bird
         For Winter's cost.

         Yet ice and frost and snow
         From earth to sky
         This Summer land doth know.
         No man knows why.

         In all men's hearts it is.
         Some spirit old
         Hath turned with malign kiss
         Our lives to mould.

         Red fangs have torn His face.
         God's blood is shed.
         He mourns from His lone place
         His children dead.

Not so easy a question to answer. There is an enormous range of opinion
among Jews both in and out of Israel. Since the intifada (the first one)
more and more American Jews have felt alienated from Israeli policy. But
what does being opposed to Israel mean? If the polls are to be believed
most American Jews seem to feel that the West Bank and Gaza should be a
Palestinean state sooner rather than later. Jerusalem is a tougher
question, for all parties. In Israel itself it's not a matter of Jews not
being totally united, they're totally divided. For years the Likud held on
by very narrow margins. The one time there was what appeared to be a clear
choice--land-for-peace, as it's termed, or continued occupation--Labor won
(that's Rabin's election). Barak was a dicier choice, which makes Sharon's
election equivocal data at best.

As to "opposed to Israel" meaning "I just wish it would go away," few Jews
take that position, seeing Israel as a solution to a problem that Europe
and America were unwilling to deal with even before the holocaust. If a
credible solution--one guaranteeing safety, citizenship and religious
freedom--had been presented circa 1920, or even 1933, there would have been
a lot fewer Zionists. I for one don't think that the creation of Israel was
such a good idea--a viable diaspora would have worked. As it was, Stalin
established a Jewish National Homeland on the shore of the Pacific in
Siberia, Churchill proposed Uganda, and, at a time when Germany was still
willing to solve its "Jewish Problem" by exporting it, almost no countries
were willing to absorb more than a trickle. US immigration laws after 1921,
remember, were engineered to keep the wretched masses out.

Even at the time of the establishment of Israel in 1948 of the ultra ultra
Orthodox, the Hasidim, only one sect recognized Israel. The others thought
it best to wait for the mystical Israel to be founded when the messiah, the
son of David, re-established the kingdom.

Are you joking, man?  Yours is an entirely predictable reaction.  Please
also note that your reaction and the expected reactions of many others does
not benefit me in the least.   Not at all.

<sarcasm>Oh no wait, those inside stock shorts before the accident, they
were all mine.  I benefited indeed.  I am now rich.</sarcasm>

Many of the stories in my post were from mainstream news sources that
somehow are considered better than tabloids (guess again).  I don't buy the
bomb in the building theory at all.  I think it's dumb and yeah, many of the
things in the post are indeed dumb.  I found much of it interesting,
though--something I discovered on alt.soc.mayasia of all places.  it at
least gets people analyzing what they read, instead of nodding heads and
kissing ass.  Nodding heads and kissing ass is about what so many people
have done around here.

But one must always ask *cui bono*.  Few in the brainwashed TV-addicted
country known as the USA know how to ask any questions of what people tell
them, much less "who benefits?"  Fortunately that is much less true of the
crew on this e-mail list.  Nevertheless, so much of what I've heard here as
of late contradicts my belief that people here are above possessing
unexamined "favored truths."

<sarcasm>I mean, if Dan Rather thinks 911 was an act of war, well then, it
MUST be.  And heck, a person must be paranoid to ever consider that American
tax dollars fund international criminals and criminal activities through the
CIA, the DIA, the US Military, through front corporations, through the NSA.
I mean, if you believe that money makes the world go round, and you believe
there ARE smart people in these organizations, then you are straight out of
a tabloid.</sarcasm>  C'mon pal.

If a large number of people asked *cui bono*, it would benefit ALL of us.
We might not be in the Orwellian quandary we are in now, with a
fill-in-the-blank war and an enemy we were paying large sums of money right
at least through 1999.  Not that people care, after all, it seems only
"America United" messages and flag waving matters anymore.

*Telling* people to ask "who benefits", as opposed to merely asking it for
myself, is an act of self-sacrifice in the current politically "united" (re:
tolerate no dissent) climate.  I lose, you win.  I don't even win a moral
victory.  Zip.  I lose.  I look like an asshole.  And you will look like a
white knight in shining armor, guiding us to reputable sources like the New
York times.  Heh.  Or, are you one who thinks that Judas somehow "benefited"
in fulfilling Jesus' prophecy by sacrificing his very own ego and
reputation?

By the way, your e-mail address has the fnord number in it.

For those of you in the Bay Area on that date, Saturday December 1 Small
Press Traffic will host a panel of translators (and a reading of translated
work) including Jen Hofer whose book of translations of contemporary Mexican
poets is due out from the U of Alabama Press, next year I believe. Norma
Cole will be the moderator and the other panelists are Pierre Joris, Walter
Lew, and Diane Weipert. (Reading from, respectively, their translations of
work from N. Africa, Korea, and Cuba). If you want an email announcement
closer to the event please email me at work (smallpress@ccac-art.edu).

ps Duration Press rocks as does Jerrold Shiroma who lovingly translated a
fabulous poem by Marc Cholodenko for our Euro SF poetry festival last
spring.
pps Thank you Kevin Killian for your lucid and kind reply to Gary Sullivan's
Ugh post. If Gary is really giving up on the list, I will be sad and sorely
miss his posts. His "last few days" post was really key for me in
understanding these events.
ppps Arielle Greenberg rocks.
pppps Chris Alexander rocks in a really, really hard job.

I also think of the dear Afghani-American young women I had in my classes
when I was teaching comp around the Bay Area. Two of them (twins) brought up
a video their uncle (who still lives in Afghanistan) had sent the family of
a neighbor man being killed, in a slow and symbolic way, for having shaved
his beard.
All these young women, or most of them, came to school wearing their
scarves, and either tight jeans or minis. I figured they changed after
leaving home in the a.m.

I usually cross the border into Tijuana at least once a week and return
late at night the same day. This time it's been a month. Generally I drive
in, but the delays returning by car are as much as 4 hours, depending upon
the time of day. Even after 11 pm, when normally it takes about 20 minutes
to cross, delays have been 45 minutes to an hour.

San Diego and Tijuana are one economic unit. Large numbers of Mexicans
cross the border daily to work in the US, others cross to shop. These are
almost all legal crossings. The illegals in general cross elsewhere--to
cross here you need papers, and phoney papers are very expensive. Families
often straddle the border, and members of the middle class often have homes
on both sides. The same, to a lesser degree, is true of gringos--some live
in the US and work in Mexico, and increasingly gringos live in Mexico and
cross the line to work.

Avenida Revolution in Tijuana and the streets around it are devoted to the
care and feeding of tourists from San Diego. I walked several blocks up the
avenue. It was a ghost town. Rock music still blared from the balconies of
the 2nd story clubs, but there were no customers drinking margaritas. The
stores selling leathergoods or low-quality handicrafts or pharmaceuticals
were empty. Even the women and children from the far south of Mexico who
normally beg or sell chiclets were gone.

Each of these businesses support, more or less, a dozen people. No one
except the owners has any reserve. The owners, many of them, have a pretty
tenuous grip on their middle class status, and commercial rents in the
tourist district are high. There is no unemployment insurance.

I got a lift back to the US side at 2 am, so my plan to avoid the line and
walk across came to naught. We waited only 45 minutes. Of the 24 lanes only
4 were open--the wee hours are short-shifted. In the other 20 lanes dark,
silent cars were lined up dozens deep. Their owners were sleeping in the
back seats, waiting for the lanes to open at 4. Otherwise, they would have
to count on 4 hours to get across, which for many of them would mean loss
of jobs.

The reason the lines are slow is because the border guards are scrutinizing
the crossers more carefully. At the best of times, even with the sniffing
dogs constantly on the prowl, our government guesses that it detects 10% of
contraband, whether drugs, Cuban cigars, guns or illegals armed with forged
documents. No one else thinks the batting average is that good. And no one
seems to think it's improved. But almost all the cars are having their
trunks searched, and the eyeballing is more intense.

One of the problems with this approach is pretty obvious. A great many
Mexicans could pass for arabs in Cairo--the arab population of medieval
Spain was pretty active. My friend Eduardo Arellano has a reading on this
side in two weeks. He's thinking of shaving his beard to cross the border.

Another cost.

Judging from Arundhata Roy's rhetoric, I don't think she was dissenting from
USGov policies exclusively; she was speaking out against broader national
arrogance.  Viz: "the world's most powerful country, reaching reflexively,
angrily, for an old instinct to fight a new kind of war."  And: "Someone
recently said that if Osama bin Laden didn't exist, America would have had
to invent him."

So I mean "U.S." in the sense that Ms. Roy means "America."

P.S. Being Indian, she can't really "dissent", however, she can only object

Subject:      Re: Orwell
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; format=flowed

I've tried to track down the quotation from Orwell without much luck, I
suspect it's a garbled version and quoted out of a context which is crucial
in understanding what he was getting at. What I did find were 2 references
to Pacifism that didn't gel with the "proto-Fascist". In Inside the Whale
Orwell describes pacifism as "a tenable position, and at this moment an
honourable one, but probably in the long run involving the rejection of
socialism." This was published in 1940.
He also writes briefly about it in Looking back on the Civil War in Homage
to Catalonia (1943)
I'll quote a largeish section because I think context is important (and I'll
say more on that later) - "Let Fascism, or possibly even a combination of
several Fascisms, conquer the whole world...We in England underrate the
danger of this kind of thing, because our traditions and our past security
have given us a sentimental belief that it all comes right in the end and
the thing you most fear never really happens. Nourished for hundreds of
years on a literature in which Right invariably triumphs in the last
chapter, we believe half-instinctively that evil always defeats itself in
the long run. Pacifism, for instance, is founded largely on this belief.
Don't resist evil, and it will somehow destroy itself. But why should it?
What evidence is there that it does?"

The first quotation indicates that Orwell respects the idea of pacifism
without endorsing it, the second provides the all-important context within
which anything critical he writes about pacifism should be understood -
namely Europe in the 30's and 40's, not only formative for Orwell but, as he
died in 1950, definitive also. Writing about the Spanish Civil War as both
participant and observer and doing so in 1943, in the middle of the second
World War, his critique of pacifism, such as it is, is legitimate. Could
Fascism have been overthrown by anything but military force? I don't see how
(I'm taking it for granted, of course, that it should be stopped). Orwell is
no militarist, war "degrades", it is an "evil" and his general tone is the
horror that comes from experience but, in some situations, he sees it as
necessary. I very much doubt that the present situation would be one.

More on context: When Orwell writes on pacifism it is rather in passing, and
to quote such a section and ignore his much more strenuous opposition to
fascism/Stalinism is thoroughly misleading. Further, when he criticises the
left or the intelligentsia, which he does regularly, he is not speaking of
the left in any abstract sense i.e. a philosophical position but of a
particular group of people at a particular point in time, a group whose
agility was severely tested by having to keep up with the permutations of
Stalin's foreign policy in the '30's.
Am I being pedantic? I've liked Orwell's work ever since I was a teenager,
the essays and nonfiction more than the novels (a digression - when I and my
friends - 15yr. old Catholic schoolgirls circa '69/'70 - were reading 1984,
one of the attractions was the sex scene - I know that sounds ludicrous now
but that was Australia back then) I like/respect his passion (but that's not
enough) his committment to the under-privileged (although that's not his
word) and to the truth, and I know that's a problematic word - I prefer
truthfulness but his honesty is surely one of his most attractive/valuable
qualities as a writer/human.
I don't think it's necessary to agree with everything he says although many
of his insights - re-read Politics and the English Language - are as
pertinent now as when written - but how can anyone suggest that he was
anything but a dedicated opponent of oppression wherever he found it, and an
acute analyst of the abuse of power.
Patrick, I generally like your posts, agree with many of them, but my kids
will tell you that "Totalitarians need Orwell" really got to me. Maybe it's
a failure of imagination on my part but I can't even see where this is
coming from, Orwell is so anti-ideology, anti-orthodoxy and so
pro-liberty/thought/creativity/expression - I'm baffled. Btw his argument
that modern English prose, especially political writing, "consists less and
less of WORDS chosen for the sake of their meaning, and more and more of
PHRASES ..." and the ensuing analsis of the way language is used to avoid
thought seems exactly the sort of thing we could all agree with.
I feel dissatisfied with the above, as though I haven't done Orwell justice,
or communicated what I feel/think (well, that's not so important) - go and
read some of his essays and see what you think then (written not in the
spirit of making some terrific point  but - I give up, it's spring here in
Australia and you know that makes a difference)

There's a lot of bulshit on television...if the Taleban want to live  in a
certain way, that's their choice: each country has its choice. I dont care
about those things, its not my country: unlike the US etal I efuse to
"intervene" on the basis of a lot of distorted anto-moslemic propaganda:
anyway, the Taleban are who they are. Let them be.
   I dont believe 99% of the propaganda I see on television: its engineered
in favour of the fascists. Richard.

Or maybe the Oklahoma bombings have a similar basis? Who knows...as the
cliche goes "truth is the first casualty of war"  I know longer believe any
one or anything. Bush and his fascist friends such as Blair are capable of
anything...ok this is paranoia territory, but no one knows anything any
more: I have no faith any more, am totally skeptical. Richard.

I dont believe it. Any way its their way: their business. Not the arrogant
West's: interference by the US in other state's affairs may part of the
cause of this attack. I dont care what the Taleban do. Richard.

David & All,

This petition was well-intentioned, but unfortunately is no longer active.
The woman who originally started the petition (sarabande@brandeis.edu) lost
her email privileges & Brandeis Univ. is deleting all submitted copies of the
petition unread.  Below is Brandeis Univ's explanation (which is worth
reading), and two links, one to the State Dept.'s fact sheet on Women in
Afghanistan, and one to an article originally published on Salom.com,
entitled "Do Email Petitions Work".

Re: pre-emptive peace strikes, it seems quite odd to start praising our
president simply because he has done nothing. There are many issues to
question/examine/protest just now, such as our government's desperate
attempt to create a tangible enemy, to make this a war like the wars we
know. Language is certainly an issue here -- I was disheartened at a recent
anti-war meeting to hear a colleague remark that dissent among various
anti-war factions "goes much deeper than language." Of course it does, but
to dismiss language is to undermine the movement, which makes the work of
Rodrigo Toscano and his compadres in NYC so important (see post re:
coordinating imagination). "Rush in, Think Later" is a stupid slogan, to be
sure. We have to be clear about what we oppose and how we articulate that.
So, just as I fault the Bush administration for trying to fashion this into
a "traditional" war (Taliban = Osama bin Laden,  you are either with us or
against us, etc.), I hope for the peace community (myself included) to draw
on its creative powers and birth a 21st century peace movement to oppose a
6th century war in 21st century clothing.

It is telling, I believe, that perhaps the most pointed critique of the Bush
administration's anti-strategy appears in The Onion. (followed, of course,
by numerous news investigations as to whether we are officially permitted to
laugh yet. It appears that, in addition to flying, flocking to Disney World
and purchasing as many new cars, preferably SUVs, as humanly possible,
laughter has also made the list of acceptable, if not mandatory, post-9.11
behavior.)

I suspect that the more rational faction within the Bush administration has
prevailed, if it has prevailed, in part because there has been so much
adverse comment, some of it in the form of peace rallies, on the
bloodthirstiness of Bush's first comments. But if not, even if it's all
unnecessary effort, don't you think it's better to try to avert horrific
bloodshed than to protest against it after the fact?

MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="Windows-1252"
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

Hatred of the US is only a focal point. At bottom, religious fanatics are
looking for something which that makes them feel a part of  a cause larger
than themselves. In part, some of us had this in the 1960s, in the Civil
Rights Movement, the Anti-War Movement, in  Hippie Culture, Feminism, etc.
In this sense, no matter how misguided, how destructive, and
self-destructive, the terrorists are, their lives, and their deaths, have a
larger commitment to them than buying an SUV or a ten room house. Americans
run to their churches, but do they find a larger life there, or feel good
solace? In advising people to return to their normal lives, the mayor of New
York said, "Go shopping."

The waving of flags, however misguided, is a hunger for a nation, for ideas
larger an the individual, not for an economic system, one that, in any case,
is failing us. We need to rigorously question the belief-systems that are
strangling this nation, that are separating us as a people, from each other,
and from the rest of the world. And we need a poetry, arts, that people
don't go to for comfort, but for visions, for ideas, for what questions
beliefs they take for granted, whether religious, economic, cultural,
aesthetical....We need to learn how to, and to teach how to, live larger
lives.

Interview of Zbigniew Brzezinski
Le Nouvel Observateur (France), Jan 15-21, 1998, p. 76*
 =20
Q: The former director of the CIA, Robert Gates, stated in his memoirs ["Fro=
m=20
the Shadows"], that American intelligence services began to aid the=20
Mujahadeen in Afghanistan 6 months before the Soviet intervention.  In this=20
period you were the national security adviser to President Carter.  You=20
therefore played a role in this affair.  Is that correct?

Brzezinski:  Yes.  According to the official version of history, CIA aid to=20
the Mujahadeen began during 1980, that is to say, after the Soviet army=20
invaded Afghanistan, 24 Dec 1979.  But the reality, secretly guarded until=20
now, is completely otherwise: Indeed, it was July 3, 1979 that President=20
Carter signed the first directive for secret aid to the opponents of the=20
pro-Soviet regime in Kabul.  And that very day, I wrote a note to the=20
president in which I explained to him that in my opinion this aid was going=20
to induce a Soviet military intervention.

Q: Despite this risk, you were an advocate of this covert action.  But=20
perhaps you yourself desired this Soviet entry into war and looked to provok=
e=20
it?

B: It isn't quite that.  We didn't push the Russians to intervene, but we=20
knowingly increased the probability that they would.

Q: When the Soviets justified their intervention by asserting that they=20
intended to fight against a secret involvement of the United States in=20
Afghanistan, people didn't believe them.  However, there was a basis of=20
truth.  You don't regret anything today?

B: Regret what?  That secret operation was an excellent idea.  It had the=20
effect of drawing the Russians into the Afghan trap and you want me to regre=
t=20
it?  The day that the Soviets officially crossed the border, I wrote to=20
President Carter: We now have the opportunity of giving to the USSR its=20
Vietnam war.  Indeed, for almost 10 years, Moscow had to carry on a war=20
unsupportable by the government, a conflict that brought about the=20
demoralization and finally the breakup of the Soviet empire.

Q: And neither do you regret having supported the Islamic [int=E9grisme],=20
having given arms and advice to future terrorists?

B: What is most important to the history of the world?  The Taliban or the=20
collapse of the Soviet empire?  Some stirred-up Moslems or the liberation of=
=20
Central Europe and the end of the cold war?

Q: Some stirred-up Moslems?  But it has been said and repeated: Islamic=20
fundamentalism represents a world menace today.

B: Nonsense!  It is said that the West had a global policy in regard to=20
Islam.  That is stupid.  There isn't a global Islam.  Look at Islam in a=20
rational manner and without demagoguery or emotion.  It is the leading=20
religion of the world with 1.5 billion followers.  But what is there in=20
common among Saudi Arabian fundamentalism, moderate Morocco, Pakistan=20
militarism, Egyptian pro-Western or Central Asian secularism?  Nothing more=20
than what unites the Christian countries.

* There are at least two editions of this magazine; with the  perhaps sole=20
exception of the Library of Congress, the version sent to the United States=20
is shorter than the French version, andthe Brzezinski interview was not=20
included in the shorter version.

The above has been translated from the French by Bill Blum
Author, "Killing Hope: US Military and CIA Interventions Since World War II"=
=20
and "Rogue State: A Guide to the World's Only Superpower"
Portions of the books can be read at:=20
http://members.aol.com/superogue/homepage.htm (with a link to Killing Hope)

If anyone whose French is better than mine can translate the bracketed word,=

Award-winning feature-film, The Bingo Robbers, ( A Cinequest, San Jose Selection) written and directed by Lois Brown and Barry Newhook and produced by Dana Warren is screening at the New York International Film and Video Festival followed by short, TV Talk Show Live directed by Rhonda Buckley. The screening at the Clearview Cinema 239 E59th Street (btw 2nd and 3rd Ave) will be held MONDAY, OCTOBER 8TH, 2001 at 6:00 pm with a reception to follow.


"The answer to a movie lover's prayer" (The Evening Telegram)

A tightly plotted tale of two eccentrics who screw up a series of robberies - mostly because they can't stop talking - is smart, edgy with snappy dialogue to spare. Vallis (Barry Newhook) lives in his 76 Chrysler. Nancy (Lois Brown) loves and depises her deadbeat drummer partner-in-crime. The two cruise the gloomy streets of Newfoundland's biggest city bringing us their darkly comic observations on love and violence, while plotting the best way to take down the 24-Hour Bingo Extravaganza.

"There isn't a slow moment in this movie...engaging, wonderfully written" (Brokenpencil,Toronto)

Best Feature at Toronto International DV Festival. Winner of Best Actor, Outstanding Writers and Best Original Music Composition at The Atlantic Film Festival.

TV TALK SHOW LIVE:

TV Talk Show Live is directed by St. John's artist Rhonda Buckley, and written by Lisa Moore and Rhonda Buckley.


TV TALK SHOW LIVE. Is it real? Is it art? TV Talk Show Live is a parody on talk shows. The guests on the show are artists, who argue and unravel video art in the 21st century of mediamania. The host, Rick Boland, is a genius, although he has delusions from the very medium that captivates him-TV. Watch as the guests and host of TV Talk Show Live reveal the many pixelized images of art and television. In TV Talk Show Live you may not know 'what is fact and what is fiction' or more precisely, 'what is art and what is television'?


TV TALK SHOW LIVE STARS: Rick Boland, Berni Stapleton, Sherry White, Jon Whelan, Geoff Younghusband, and Andrea Cooper.


FILMMAKERS LOIS BROWN, DANA WARREN AND RHONDA BUCKLEY WILL BE IN ATTENDANCE.

Content-Type: text/plain; charset="Windows-1252"
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

The great Japanese anti-nuclear poet, Kurihara Sadako, herself a hibakusha,
a survivor of Hiroshima, begins her poem "Ruins"--
                      Hiroshima: nothing, nothing--
                      old and yonug burned to death,
                      city blown away,
                      a socket without an eyeball.

Writing twenty years later, she ends her poem, "When We Say 'Hiroshima'"--

                      That we may say 'Hiroshima'
                      and hear in reply, gently,
                      'Ah, Hiroshima,'
                      we first must
                      wash the blood
                      off our own hands.

The same year, 1952, that she wrote "Ruins," she wrote a poem titled "The
Flag, I," which ends:

                      Yet today the flag flutters again, shameless,
                      and all those bloody memories
                      gone;
                      fluttering, fluttering in the breeze,
                      it dreams once more of redrawing the map.

I dont want you to think that I would support a vicious regime that did do
such things: my problem now is that I am rather skeptical of anything put
over television. My suspicion is that there might even be something good
about anyone that the bourgeouis press attacks constantly and also it was
shown (and this isn't paranoia (probably the CIA had nothing to do with
attacks despite Patrick's email interesting as that was): it set in concrete
that the US were 90% lying during the Vietnam war and there's the Pentagon
papers and tricky Dicky Nixon and all that - also the bombing began in the
1950s in an undeclared and illegal and barbaric war by the US). I dont want
repression and killing of people in Afghanistan (or anywhere) but I think
people have got things out of proportion here: and the history of the US
propaganda bullshit machine unfortumately works against them: so I am
automatically skeptical of EVERYTHING. I dont know (if it matters) who
attacked the US but the US (while I would agree that by and large the
American people are more "civilised" (altough that is problematic) than most
or many of the Eastern countries)...but unfortunately there are riight
wingers in th US (and abroad I agree) who are quite vicious: obviously
someone who wants to just kill Americans is also a bit of a worry: but the
questions arising are: why?
  I dont think that the Taleban are involved in this: anyway if they are
replaced while you will or may have a "better" regime: the replacing is
likely to cause a lot of resentment (more "terrorism" down the line).....the
answer is not passivity but a campaign of very active education (evreywhere)
and aid to people everywhere: it also means moving in the West to more truly
democratic regimes. Persuasion also and education of the peoples in the
Muslim countries to the extent they are wanting or want it: that is the
way..we shouldnt force them to change. Anycase I dont know much about the
Taleban and would want a lot more info than the US and British propaganda
befiore I did anything. If I say I dont care about the Taleban: what I mean
is that I'm not going to be sidetracked by all the very many strange peoples
of the world who all have their ways and various eccentricities, religions:
its not as if a large country is armed and is realistically attacking the
US. If the US attacks or interferes in Afghanistan that is an unprovoked act
of war: illegal and wrong in my book.  Terrorists are and never will be
restricted to a single country. Sometimes a terrorist is a freedom fighter.
I crash a plane if I felt it promoted a beter world: but I dont, yet.
Richard.

RealPoetik can't remember for the life of him whether he sent this out or
not, so...We recently came into possession of the Bush administration's
master plan against Islamic terrorists and Osama Bin Laden.  And it is:

1.  Decrease tax rates for rich folks (to stimulate the economy).
2.  Eliminate taxes on interest, rent and profits (ditto).
3.  Eliminate capital gaines tax (ditto).
4.  Totally privatize social security (why should poor folks have
    pensions?).
5.  Make labor unions into "conspiracies against free trade" and ban
    them.
6.  Invade Poland.

        This is especially hitting today considering the unusual weather in
Buffalo. Today as Peter Jennings reports the sun shone as ice hailed down.
It is an uneasy feeling to watch the TV while dark clouds rolled in. It all
seems so distant. Yesterday I cleaned up my neighbor's suicide, as the day
before I visited my brother in the hospital after another manic attack. On
receiving news of the war, I was at my computer, cat on lap drinking coffee
waiting for Xena to air. Instead more war and Osama praises god for our
fear. Tomahawk missiles and ice - what a world, what a day.

ON RECEIVING NEWS OF THE WAR

         Snow is a strange white word.
         No ice or frost
         Has asked of bud or bird
         For Winter's cost.

         Yet ice and frost and snow
         From earth to sky
         This Summer land doth know.
         No man knows why.

         In all men's hearts it is.
         Some spirit old
         Hath turned with malign kiss
         Our lives to mould.

         Red fangs have torn His face.
         God's blood is shed.
         He mourns from His lone place
         His children dead.

         O! ancient crimson curse!
         Corrode, consume.

For our second conference we continue our focus on the role of the
internet and telecommunications and particularly invite contributions that
address the way new media create new potentials and re-define the acts of
writing and reading. We welcome proposals on all aspects of new media and
writing, especially by those whose work is based in new media, on or off
the internet. Go to http://trace.ntu.ac.uk/incubation/ for the Call for

All:

I have been reading the posts about the situation after Sept. 11th and I
think that one bit of heresy I wish to
express is that non-violence while and great concept with some pretty great
exponents (Jesus, Gandhi. King)
does not always get results and that many times to achieve justice violence
is needed.  In many ways violence needs to be embraced and not shunned so
that we can control and use it in the most measured way possible.
I think World War II taught us this.

I think as well that intolerance needs to be embraced.  The reality is that
the reason that we in the US and other
"post-modern"societies do not normally kill each other over faith issues is
because frankly we are intolerant of people acting on their theological
bigotry's.  In the Middle East many governments that support the US have no
compunction of acting on these theological bigotry's (Saudi Arabia for
example).

I also think that it is not bigoted to ask how much of true Islam is in the
terrorists actions? I write this not as an agnostic but as a practicing
Catholic. I can say with assurance that my Church's positions on for example
what happened during the Holocaust or what happened during the colonization
of the Americas were based in true theology.  Catholic theology for 1800
years has condemned the Jews, it made Native Americans into objects rather
than subjects and allowed their murder and enslavement and all Catholics
have to admit this and as John XXIII said let the light in so that the
roaches can be seen.  Our theology made these things possible, does Islamic
theology make these terror acts possible?

I was eating melted plastic
Long before it came into vogue::::
Not saying I'm anything special
More like being in a Gibson novel::::seer

Sometimes or maybe not a violence
Of innocence acts upon one's impulse
Therefore I am voyeur misanthropic::::
It was deathwish at first I admit

But something zen in eating
The uneatable to taste
That which is beyond earthly flavor::::
And the smell is perfectly awful.

Lowliest

Lowliest of all
creation is chicken
held captive industrial
concentration camped
throughout the world.

We devour them.

Small brains
strange nervous systems
neither ability nor inclination
to believe in god

Mad chicken disease.

Striking Back Against Terror

(CBS) American and British forces completed a day of punishing air attacks
against Osama bin Laden and his Taliban hosts inside Afghanistan, striking
at terrorists blamed for the attacks that killed thousands in New York and
Washington ...

> warlile way for ever:

Richard please.  American capitalism?  We're writers, yes?  We use words well?
A few corrections:

Capitalism isn't inherently American, I believe there were merchant classes in
almost every early society, and not just in the West.  And, if we'd like to
point fingers at capitalism, let's remember how seldom it wears a national
face.  Corporations are rarely civic minded when it comes to the bottom line.

As a citizen of the US who certainly does not always, or often, support the
political choices her government makes, I am aware that I do benefit from those
choices, as does any other citizen of any other country allied with the US.
That includes the ability to use the technology that makes a list like this
possible.

I don't consider your comments whacko.  I'd tend to say they're not thought
through very well, and reflect a rather predictable response to the US and what
is often known as Corporate America -- jeeze, there's that darn America thing
again  Unfortunately, we're all a bit more interconnected than we at times wish
to admit, which makes analyis of situations like the one which now confronts us
just a bit more complicated.

Net artist WOLF KAHLEN is dissolving pixel by pixel, user by user in the
net. On a first page. On the second you see and hear your personal pixel,
the one, you activated to disappear, solely on the empty page. And on the
third page you see all the 'lost' pixels arriving back and shaping a new
WOLF KAHLEN. Look, hear and have the triptych printed out, signed and
numbered, the way you, only you see the process taking shape, nobody else
has seen this moment of the RITUAL DEATH.
An exiting piece and a very conceptual one, media concerned and at the same
time sensual.
The RUINE DER KUENSTE BERLIN presents it to collectors as a present, which
WOLF KAHLEN gave them at his 60th birthday. The URL for the piece is
www.wolf-kahlen.de
More about us: www.snafu.de/~ruine-kuenste.berlin

AND

SORRY FOR EVENTUAL CROSSPOSTINGS

NetSoundArt for Tibetans, Chinese and Japanese:
A threefold internet art piece by Wolf Kahlen in Tibetan, Chinese and
Japanese language is online since today.
Live and interactive the visitor of the page
www.tu-berlin.de/~arch_net_art/2.html
may hear a piece of world literature of these countries, the first page at
least. If he is patient enough to find out on a blank page, with the mouse
in motion, the sound of the words hidden in the background like on a book
page. This automatically turns out to be a game, since any move of the mouse
touches another word. Until the underlying structure has been found out, a
number of  audio events have happened, words' sounds have overlapped or
entangled at random. Who stirs with the mouse produces a concert like a DJ.
The presented world's classics are by Tibet's greatest poet Milarepa
(11./12. Century), the Chinese Tang-Dynasty poet Li Bo (6.- 9. Century) or
the alphabet-poem attributed to Kukai of Japan. It is of political delicacy
that Wolf Kahlen, who did a number of documentaries in Tibet and Mongolia
since 1985, parallels Tibet with China.
Possibly the first Tibetan language internet site to listen to, probably
frequented joyfully by the world spread Tibetans and the few with access in
Lhasa and other parts of the Snowland. Who has entered the site either reads
Tibatan, Chinese or Japanese or has been attracted by the curious writings,
since all three titles are of course in original characters. Another way to
support the cultures in their differences. The hearing experience of the
pieces, roughly translated as
Sorry, Milarepa / Excuse me, Kukai / I beg your pardon, Li Bo,
spans the whole spectrum between playful chaotic sounds, own word
combinations and listening to a fluently spoken classical piece: all
democratic ways of using words. Words as material per se. And since these
words bump into each other in most cases other than as a structered
classical piece, Wolf Kahlen asks the authors for excuse in the titles
already beforehand. As a side effect the net is swept blank off the overload
of images. And the sound of the 'bush drums' is heard again.
These three pieces continue the former realized three ones in English,
German and Spanish language
Sorry, Mister Joyce / Verzeihung, Herr von Goethe / Perdone, Don Cervantes
on www.tu-berlin.de/~arch_net_art/1.html
More pieces in a great number of world languages are under construction.
They kind of point out on the polarisation of the numb and speechless making
psycho esthetic feedbacks of the net 'culture'. The texts are usually read
by native artists.
Li Bo read by Zhao Zhao
Kukai by Masuko Iso,
Milarepa by Tsewang Norbu,
Goethe by Wolf Kahlen,
Joyce by David Allen,
Cervantes by Argine Erginas.
Stay tuned.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Cid Corman, b. 1924, was born in Boston, and received his B.A. from Tufts.
He did graduate work at the University of Michigan, where he won the
Hopwood Award for Poetry, and the University of North Carolina. Throughout
the 1950's and 1960's Corman's magazine ORIGIN published some of the major
works of the Black Mountain poets, as well as other important work,
choosing mostly poems not yet readily available elsewhere: the early poetry
of Charles Olson, Robert Creeley, and Denise Levertov with the late works
of Wallace Stevens and William Carlos Williams. He carried on a fascinating
correspondence with Stevens, who greatly respected what Origin was doing.
Corman has published over seventy volumes of poetry, translated several
French and Japanese poets, and published four volumes of essays. He has
lived in Kyoto, Japan since 1958 where he and his wife run a business, Cid
Corman's Dessert Shop. Corman is one of "late" modernism's most significant
enablers, a poet of talent himself, and a master of "production" -- whose
work, both as poet and publisher, is intertwined with the Objectivists
Zukofsky and Oppen, as well as Creeley and Olson. Among those poetic
colleagues and many younger poets worldwide, Corman's verse is perhaps the
most committed to the sublime, refusing the temptation of "effect" for the
tactile ink of line and "touch." His collection Nothing Doing is full of
poetry of cognitive conundrum, but also of uncompromising wisdom, where
Corman can definitively declare: "There's only / one poem: / this is it."

Corman was one of the first to theorize what modernist verse can do on the
radio. In Poetry (1952) he wrote a piece on poetry and radio that reads, in
part: "What few poets seem to realize is that radio is their best potential
outlet these days. It puts the stress rightly on the spoken word, tests the
imagination of writer and listener spoken revives the need of the
oral-aural commitment in verse, and permits the largest possible audience
to experience the poem. As a rare diet, of course, it undermines itself.
But there is no reason today, under sincere and determined effort, that
good poetry programs should not be available throughout the country. They
con be noncommercial sustaining programs, like This Is Poetry. Nearly three
years ago I initiated my weekly broadcasts, known as This Is Poetry, from
WMEX (1510 kc.) in Boston. The program has been usually a fifteen-minute
reading of modern verse on Saturday evenings at seventhirty; however, I
have taken some liberties and have read from Moby Dick and from stories by
Dylan Thomas, Robert Creeley, and Joyce. In the approximately 150 programs
to date, during which I have had the opportunity to improve my delivery and
to appreciate oral detail, I have offered the program to many guest poets,
to read and discuss their work. About a third of the programs have been of
this kind. My guests have included such writers as John Crowe Ransom,
Archibald MacLeish, Stephen Spender, John Ciardi, Theodore Roethke, Pierre
Emmanuel, Allan Curnow, Richard Wilbur, Richard Eberbart, Katherine
Hoskins, and Vincent Ferrini. A number of the programs have been bilingual,
in English and French, Spanish, German, or Italian. I have had young but
highly qualified persons, native to the tongues, read the originals against
my reading of translations. Programs have been given to Corbiere, Eluard,
Lorca, Ungaretti, Benn, and others. Imagine hearing Claudio Guillen, son of
Jorge Guillen, read a poem that Lorca wrote for him when he was a child in
Spain...."

88-Year-Old Nun Begins Prison Term
by Jay Hughes

PEKIN, Ill. –– An 88-year-old nun arrested at Fort Benning, Ga., while
protesting the Army's School of the Americas reported to prison to begin
serving a six month sentence.

Dorothy Hennessey arrived Tuesday at the minimum-security Pekin Federal
Prison Camp along with her sister Gwen Hennessey, 68, also a nun from
Dubuque, Iowa.

The sisters were among 26 protesters convicted of trespassing during a
November protest in which some 3,400 people crossed onto the Army base
without permission. Only those who had been arrested for trespassing before
but not prosecuted were sentenced to prison.

The protesters contended that graduates of the school, recently renamed the
Western Hemisphere Institute for Security Cooperation, have been linked to
murder, torture and other human rights abuses. Military officials say the
school's goal is to teach democratic principles to future Latin American
leaders.

Dorothy Hennessey was given the chance to serve probation, but she turned
the judge's offer down.

"I'm not an invalid, so I think I should get the same as the others," she
said.

She said she began protesting against the school to honor the memory of her
brother who spent several years as a missionary in Central America and
relayed tales of government abuses.

"My little bit of discomfort is nothing like that my brother's parishioners
suffered down there," she said.

The Hennessey sisters were sentenced to up to six months in prison, as was
Rachel Hayward, of Negaunee, Mich., who at 19 was the youngest protester
convicted.

Pekin prison spokesman Richard Engel said the nine female protesters sent
there were assigned cubicles that each will share with another inmate in
dormitory-style housing.

The Rev. Roy Bourgeois, founder of the protest's organizer, School of the
Americas Watch, said the sentences of the 26 who were ordered to report to
prisons around the country Tuesday would energize future demonstrators. The
group is planning another protest at Fort Benning in November.

just an alert about the new POG website, news of which I recently sent you:

apparently it won't work in older versions of Netscape (it closes or crashes
the program). sorry!

I designed the site with Microsoft's Front Page 2002; site works fine, of
course, in Internet Explorer--and also in new version of Netscape, 6.1.

Apologies, though, if the site generated any crashes among users of older
versions of Netscape.

Two historical ironies I find very disturbing: the use
of "ground zero," previously used to decribe the
center of the U.S. attack on Hiroshima's civilian
population, and "homeland security," with it's echo of
South African apartheid.

Coincidence: two foreigners and non-Listees have the
analyses I've read here that come closest to my own
heart and mind - the Dalai Lama and Arundhati Roy.

Of course: I see what your saying. But I'm certain that if tey'd set up
somewhere - well where? - look I know the terrible hstory of the attacks on
Jewish people (I was watching a programme on the Hist of England and Edward
the 1st actulaly banned the Jews from money lending (as they nad he had run
out of cash) then he hung a whole lot then he persecuted the others, putting
yellow badges on them : then he went on to slaughter the Welsh and the
Scots..so England was the first (or pretty much in the running for the
medal) country to practice genocide.
  And of course the holocuast was terrible. So attacks on Israel becuase its
Jewsih I dont support: but if they are in defence I can understand: I think
that the Israelis are being cynically used by history: not perhaps quite
simplistically deliberately. So I can understand Bin Laden's support of the
Paletinians. But I wouldnt support a genocide against the Israelis....as you
say or imply I think the big misfortune was to have this extreme right
winger in charge now just when injustices werebeing revealed and some of the
history becoming less biased to the Israelis..who ARE being used by the big
Corporations and so on as that area is very important for them to control:
hence this present insane and "infinite" justice.
 If I was Jewish....my uncle said that he thought that my grandfather
was...but like my friend Martin (now deceased) who changed his name and
refused to be labelled Jewsih or Socialist (as his father virulently was)
etc I think I'd do that: I refuse to be put in a box. Look: if I was in Iran
I'd be arguing with them...I argue the toss with everyone and I keep seeing
different sides to evverything: just at the moment I am on a Jihad jag but
that probably wont last I'll go back to my "Infinite Poem" which (when I
began it) I was repudiating ANY politiical involvement.
  But I'm not happy with the situation: whoever or why the attack on the US
I'm not behind Blair he makes me want to vomit over the Television set. I
wish someone would fire a 747 through the arrogant bastard: its nothing
personal its just that I'd rather be running the world! Richard.

Today, Oct. 8, I was scanning a page of text and the scanner's text editor
took the word "worth" and came back with"war$". Yes, it seems words do

>>I also think that it is not bigoted to ask how much of true Islam is in
>>the terrorists actions? I write this
not as an agnostic but as a practicing Catholic. I can say with assurance
that my Church's positions on
for example what happened during the Holocaust or what happened during the
colonization of the
Americas were based in true theology. Catholic theology for 1800 years has
condemned the Jews, it
made Native Americans into objects rather than subjects and allowed their
murder and enslavement and
all Catholics have to admit this and as John XXIII said let the light in so
that the roaches can be seen.
Our theology made these things possible, does Islamic theology make these
terror acts possible?



Ray I think you are brave to bring this up, and to reflect on your own
religion as was Arielle earlier. Daughter of a lapsed Catholic,
stepgranddaughter of a devout one, I can say that yes, all Catholics have to
admit this, and all that might ever turn to the church in a time of need
might be stopped by this horrible history. Beginning for me with the demonic
sexism of all of the "top 3" religions, I don't have much truck with em. But
I would add, there is not only the ideology but the culture, the day-to-day
living, to consider. It wasn't ideology that killed Native Americans, it was
people, for ex. (I realize you are aware of this, Ray!)
What I am unable to wrap my mind around is that some people actually
believed this religious junk which worked hand in hand with genocide. It's
always seemed to me that it was just fake. Like the treaties were fake, ie
not in good faith. Like Georgie is fake with his words and "beliefs".
Anyway, I suppose I'm a bit rambly having been meditatively and luckily in
the country all weekend and now returning to the news of the present
bombing. But I would also like to add that I think it is very very important
that, however lamely, the Pres and the Press are saying, oh by the way,
don't assume all Muslims are terrorists. I was glad Bush said that in his
address to Congress -- although he could have been a little blunter, like
maybe just flat out saying um, hey, don't kill your neighbors because they
are strange to you. But oh yeah, that doesn't fit with his ideology.
Country Joe McDonald was in the Chronicle today saying who we should most be
listening to now is Vietnam vets.

Peace be with you. And also with you.

I hope I'm not the only person out there dismayed (again) by Ron Silliman's
glib coinage, "left fundamentalism." Sort of like "social fascism," this
seems to be trying to characterize a position one disagrees with by
associating it with an outcome it has nothing to do with. "Social fascism,"
it may be recalled, was the Communist Party's way of describing socialists
who, because they did not follow the CP's line in opposing fascism, were
abetting it. And hence, the logic followed, no better than fascists. I
think the same logic is inferred in "left fundamentalism."

This is a misuse of language, pure and simple.

yes, it is the talibans business...was also hitlers business, stalins
business, pol pots business, maos business...or, perhaps, the us's
business...that you can write from new zealand, complaining about us foreign
policy does little to support the relativism with which you wish to view the
taliban...i guess if the women of afghanistan chose to join you in the fight
against "us capitalism" then they would be worth caring for...until then,
richard, perhaps the next time you feel like lashing out against that same
"us capitalism," you should remember the fact that your e-mail service is
provided by microsoft...i'm sure bill gates (capitalism's poster boy)
appreciates your support (even more so if you use his dial-up
access)...quite the participant you are in the whole game...perhaps also you
should check to see where the components for your computer come from...id
hate for you to be financially supporting any other us corporation...

America you don't really want to go to war.

Them Afghans them Afghans and them Terrorists. And them Afghans.

The Afghans wants to eat us alive. The Afghans's power mad. She wants to
take
our cars from out our garages.

Her wants to grab Chicago. Her needs a Red Reader's Digest. Her wants our
auto plants in Siberia. Him big bureaucracy running our filling stations.

That no good. Ugh. Him makes Indians learn read. Him need big black niggers.

Hah. Her make us all work sixteen hours a day. Help.

America this is quite serious.

America this is the impression I get from looking in the television set.

Elizabeth. true but how the Afghanis live is not our business, or its not
relevant here: unless of course one is saying "well look we arent as bad as
that" and so on. And that's true....there are hundreds of atrocious regimes
and 'teror" is everywhere: its just the extent of it, the DEGREE of terror,
the amount of "thumbscrewing" ... we are living in a societty built on
(amongst other things the threat or potential threat of violence and terror:
and terror is being used now by the US military and the British and I think
the French and the Russians who arent known for their humanity. Long live
the American POEPLE and long live resistancve to the US Fascists and US
Military lead by Bush. Richard.

>>>anyway, the Taleban are who they are. Let them be.

It's hard even for me to do cultural relativism on this one. These are the
schmucks who have decreed that women are not to receive medical treatment
and sometimes stone women to death for being insufficiently covered by
body sacks. I certainly think our administration's current actions are, to
use the Buddhist jargon, not "skillful means."

-------------------------------------------------------
Dear Geoffrey, Charles, spirit of Isaac Rosenberg (d.
1918):

That frosty I Ching hexagram-like meterology report is
a reminder that this godgiven List is, yes, it is a
Buffalo List (space-time can become so cyber, so
Virilio) . . .

For you hinterland Buffalo-ans, blowing on your
knuckles ("Tom's a-cold"):

Is it common knowledge among your good citizens there
that the MANUFACTURERS & TRADERS CO. building (1967)
in your fair city

was designed by the architect Minoru Yamasaki, the
architect of the Twin Towers

(one of the forty-eight Danaid-like sisters of our
lost gemini)?

I wonder if the Manufacturers & Traders building looks
nice.  I haven't been able to find any photos of her.


While "taking a break" from architecture and
convalescing from stomach ulcers in '54, Yamasaki, a
Nesei (second-generation Japanese) went to Japan to
study the concept of TOKONOMA,

"an alcove that is the spiritual and artistic focus of
a Japanese home . . . often used to display hanging
scrolls, flowers and objects d'art" (Baulch, Vivian
M., The Detroit News [date?]). "On his return home
Yamasaki built his own tokonoma in his living room
devoted to small Japanese dolls and a small vase."

He was someone who had faced disappointment and the
undoing of one of his artworks during his lifetime.
"His Pruitt-Igoe Housing project, built in St. Louis
in 1955, gained notoriety after officials dynamited it
20 years later as a failure" (Baulch).

I wish I were good at traveling, so I could go about
as on a pilgrimage from Yamasaki to Yamasaki, keeping
a Basho-like journal of the voyages, prose portions
followed by haikus.  And now would be The Perfect
Time, with low, low airfare prices that would have
been affordable--- even to Minoru during his youth!
when he put himself through the University of
Washington by working summers at salmon canneries in
Alaska for 17 cents an hour.

It might be gratifying and comforting in some way, to
see Minoru's other works of the imagination, to go
inside them, . . . like being enwombed in the external
manifestations of a man's mind.

Since so many of you dears live scattered
geographically throughout these fifty glorious States,
and throughout "the world" (Sweden),--- here's a
partial list of Minoru's buildings, below.  Perhaps
you rugged types in your $155.00 Timberland Classic
Premium Waterproof 8" Boots would have no trouble
traveling about

(unlike an old lady who wears her stockings rolled
down about her shins, supporting herself in her
plodding water-around-the-ankles pace by leaning on a
wheelie pushcart to go out shopping for Pop Tarts at
2:43 in the morning, or a crumb bun)

and would enjoy visiting one of these habitable
sculptures (in the spirit of Gaston Bachelard's book,
~The Poetics of Space~), maybe then lovingly
back-channeling/bare-backing me/the List about
standing face-to-face or going inside the remaining
three-dimensionalities of Minoru's imagination.

Apologies for getting off-topic (poetry) by posting on
another artistic medium (architecture), but those
Muses, too, were sisters. Bon voyage!

Luv,

JJ

Not poems, George, but wine-labels--a far more challenging form,
almost Japanese in its strictures. (1) compare the wine to stuff it
never in 1000 years cd taste like (2) comment on the soil wherein
it's grown w/o once using the word "friable" (3) mention "sun" and
"fog" to make both sound attractive and dont forget "coolong ocean
breezes" (hand me my longjohns), all this in 50 eords or preferably
less. You will be promised a case of wine in lieu of cash and
eventually will receive a single bottle, which the owner will drink
with you in a 1: 4 ratio, not to mention his wife. Quaffing, that is,
her share. Never mind, the skinny-dipping was a tobust, piquant blend.
   Anyway, you have your own achievments to brood upon. It's the 40th
anniversary of TISH this month, which I see you-all are celebrating
on my birthday. Gt Oaks from little acorns grow, & my blessings on
the polls (& polis) of yr illusttrious band of Merry Men (aka
Tishites).. Where is the Sheriff of Norringham (Basil Rathbone)
today? You rid the Greenwood of Canadian verse of him, praise be. And
yet he was once so influential--noone at Court could pull strings w/o
Knotting em.

This is actually a heavily encoded hymn of hate toward the Taliban.

Hi Jennifer

I agree, largely

but capitalism as it is practiced now is quite different to the practice of merchant classes in time passed even if there are overlaps

but it isn't just US, or even all of America... it's everywhere

EU is seen as left in some quarters... ha! you watch

cheers

Richard please.  American capitalism?  We're writers, yes?  We use words well?
A few corrections:

Capitalism isn't inherently American, I believe there were merchant classes in
almost every early society, and not just in the West.  And, if we'd like to
point fingers at capitalism, let's remember how seldom it wears a national
face.  Corporations are rarely civic minded when it comes to the bottom line.

As a citizen of the US who certainly does not always, or often, support the
political choices her government makes, I am aware that I do benefit from those
choices, as does any other citizen of any other country allied with the US.
That includes the ability to use the technology that makes a list like this
possible.

I don't consider your comments whacko.  I'd tend to say they're not thought
through very well, and reflect a rather predictable response to the US and what
is often known as Corporate America -- jeeze, there's that darn America thing
again  Unfortunately, we're all a bit more interconnected than we at times wish
to admit, which makes analyis of situations like the one which now confronts us
just a bit more complicated.

All this true but eg my anger or disagreement with the US is not with the
great things of America: dont forget that culturally you are in a unique
place which has  contributed immensely to human culture and progress: as
Bill Austin ssaid to me "dont beat yourself up" this said the "bad" things,
the evil things, are there too: eg the very strong connection of Bush etal
with the oil industry: the fact that a pipeline was (forgie the pun) in the
pipeline to go through Afghanistan and the realtionship of the US with those
countries over there that a vastly rich in oil: the New Zealand Listener had
a very interesting take on all this today.
  Whatever happens I am never against the American people - contra the Big
Bad Capitalists and if I was in NY I'd be in there helping dont worry. But
I'd still be a pain in the "ass" as you folks say! But in the end I am a
human. Richard.

About ninety missiles have been fired into Afghanistan over the last 2 days.
Each missile costs about 1 million dollars. This amounts to a total (so far)
of 90 million dollars -- a sum which corresponds to the total Afghan state
budget for the year 2000.

Apologies  for my epistolary aphasia.

But let me announce a few things.

I presented a Talk, "The Poetics of L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E," here in New York City in a monthly Talk series, 'Textual Operations,' at Whitebox,  It's something of a summary statement from me about reading this work , with some new twists and some comparisons with  hypermedia work & I'd be pleased to get some comments from people on the EPC list. (It's too long to post, about 18 pages typescript). Ideally, I'd like to have it up on my EPC Author page with comments appended. To make that possible, it's now online at the new Poetics discussion site <http://alienated.net> where comments can be left. And it's also online on Ubu at <http://www.ubu.com/feature/papers/feature_andrews.html>

Also, I never got around to announcing my new book, LIP SERVICE
(my recasting of Dante's PARADISO) out from Coach House Press in Toronto. It's now online on the Coach House site and linked through my EPC Author Page, all 400 pages of it. I've also put up a bunch of new material  and about a dozen essays on my work (beyond what's still in print in the AERIAL anthology) -- to try to make the Author Page into a solider and more useful scholarly resource. Take a look. And keep in touch.

Happy 95th Birthday, Léopold Sédar Senghor!

Here's a poem of his (borrowed from _Poems for the Millennium, vol 1_):

MAN AND  BEAST

(for three tabalas or war drums)

I name you Evening, O ambiguous Evening, you fluttering leaf.
This is the hour of our most primal fears, raised from ancestral bowels.
Get back stupid faces of shadows, blowing evil from your snout!
Get back in the name of palm and water,
In the name of the Teller-of-deepest-secrets!
But the Beast is formless in the fertile mud nourishing
Tsetse flies and gnats, toads and snakes,
Poisonous spiders and spiked lizards.

What sudden clash without sparks of flint! What shock
And not a glimmer of passion.
The huge Man's feet skate upon the slime, where his strength
Sinks knee-deep, bound by leaves of poisonous plants.
His thoughts float into the mist.
Silent battle with no sparks of flint, to the rhythm
Of the stretched drum of his breast and the lone rhythm
Of the tom-tom beaten by the sinister Grand-Rayee drum.
Sorcerer who will announce the victor!

Claws streak his back with lightning and from raging clouds
The whirlwind skims his loins and smooths the grass at his sex
The mahogany trees shudder down to their painful roots,
But the Man plunges his lightning spear into the late moonglowing
Entrails. The golden brow harnesses the clouds
Where icy eagles soar, and thoughts circle his brow
His cardinal eye is the serpent's head.

The struggle in the darkness goes on too long!
Three ages of one thousandfold night.
The strength of the Man, his feet heavy in the fertile swamp.
The strength of the Man, the reeds hampering his effort.
His warmth the warm primeval entrails,
The strength of the Man's inebriation is the hot wine of the Beast's
Blood and the froth bubbling in his heart
Ha! more millet beer for the Initiate!

A long comet cry streaks across the night, a great noise
Sounds from a judicious voice. And the Man floors the Beast,
Talking in tongues of the danced song.
He floors him with a great burst of laughter in a gleaming
Dance danced under the rainbow of seven vowels.
Hail to the Rising Sun Lion whose look can kill
Hail to the Tamer of the bush, You, Mbarodi!
Lord over mindless forces.

And the lake blooms with water lilies, dawn of divine laughter.

Translation from the French by Melvin Dixon

Joel,
     Like you, I question what seems to be a return to business as usual on
the part of the media and advertisers - let's sell more flags, etc.   But
i'm having trouble seing how poetry can transmute this into a new vision.
From my reading of poetry's role in the past, poetry written for a reason or
to promote an ideology tends to become "message" poetry.  The classical
example for me is Trotsky's _Poetry and Revolution_ call which  was taken
over and led to Socialist Realism.  The other impulse which was in the air
at the time was overwhelmed and driven out of the market-place - Kruchenyk,
for example, or Khlebnikov - was toward experimentation and the materiality
of the poem.  If poetry is to have any effect it seems to me that it should
(there I go myself being prescriptive!) NOT be ideological?

hi friends. not long ago someone mentioned that some of the
comments/thoughts on this list have found themselves in broadcast media,
which made me question what kind of action folks on this list have been
taking (outside of poetics) re political issues. whether anti- semi- or pro-
war, civil liberties, etc, how active is the poetics community in our
democratic process? letters/calls to officials, contact w/media corp.s,
demonstrations, or other contributions? volunteerism? bumper stickers? i'd
also like to hear opinions re its possible effectiveness. . .


thanks,
hassen

[etc.]

Hi Jeffrey,

As the person more or less directly under attack above, I assume you’re
expecting me to respond. I will, and I’m sorry if it goes on forever. (I
want to be clear.)

You seem very upset by the Ashbery interview and poems I published in
Readme. You see them as examples of "near-criminal" "identity theft" that
have, as their underlying motivations "character assassination" "homophobia"
and "hate." You then proceed to make a characterization about literary
"identity theft" -- that it is a "heterosexual" "male" game, that women &
non-heterosexuals are somehow not interested in this kind of approach, and
that (I’m speculating at this point and may be overstating your case here),
the intent of "identity theft" (or identity blurring or projection) is
largely malicious.

I think these are all fairly serious charges to make, and I don’t want to
dismiss them out of hand. But, bear with me, if you will, because I’ve
thought about this quite a bit, and have come to very different conclusions
than you have. You may disagree, and it’s not like I’m going to delete
whatever counter-argument or –proposition or whatever you might want to
make.

If I felt the interview and poems were "homophobic" and "hate"-ful, if I
felt they were instances of "character assassination" I wouldn’t have
published them in the first place. That doesn’t mean that they aren’t. But,
that I don’t see it. It would help if you could maybe do a close reading of
them, and parse it out for me. So far, you’ve just made accusations about
them, and my own character, for publishing them. Repeatedly. So, okay, let’s
talk about it. Seriously, let’s talk about it … let’s take it out of the
abstract realm & into the "specific instance."

You’re going to run into trouble with the poems, so I might as well save
your breath so far as you might read them as examples of "homosexual panic."
The guy who wrote the imitation poems isn’t heterosexual. He seems pretty
open & calm about that aspect of his life, frankly. He’s also a huge fan of
Ashbery’s writing. The "Ashbery" poems -- however you might be misreading
them, not knowing their author personally -- are tributes. You can find
them, under the real author’s own name, in a book he just had published last
month. That might help put them into some larger context for you.

As for the interview, Jacques has said that he feels Ashbery is the most
important English-language poet of the latter half of the twentieth century.
I believe him when he says that -- I mean, I believe that he believes that
about the value of Ashbery’s work. (I have my own favorites.) The fake
interview is a kind of essay for him. It’s not a "first," by the way.

Take a look at Jack Kimball’s essay on John Wieners in the first issue of
Readme. You’ll see there that midway through the essay, it becomes an
interview between Kimball and Wieners. I suppose you could make the charge
here of "identity theft" -- but, what motives would you ascribe to Kimball,
I wonder, for doing that? Jack is not heterosexual. He loves Wieners’s
poetry. He’s taken an imaginative or literary leap in creating a faux
interview with his subject.

Robert Gluck’s _Jack the Modernist_ was a novel all my friends and I were
reading when we were undergrads at San Francisco State in the mid-1980s. I
knew something about the "new novelists" at that time, but I don’t think I
was yet fully clued in to the extent to which they used pastiche as a
literary device. I assumed _Jack the Modernist_ was "pure Gluck." A week ago
or so, a cartoonist friend of mine, Rebecca Levi, gave me an old copy of
_Dear World_, a magazine from the early 90s in which the late Steve Abbott
interviews John Karr, who was a semi-famous & I think much loved porno
reviewer in the 80s & 90s (I don’t know if he still does reviews). The
interview is preceded by this remark of Abbott’s: "[John Karr’s] reviews for
BAR, THE NEW YORK NATIVE, DRUMMER and THE MANIFEST READER have been so
influential that Robert Gluck used a pastiche of them in his novel _Jack the
Modernist_." I went back to Gluck’s book to see if I could tell what was
Karr’s. I’m guessing it was the chapter titled "Saint Venus," but that’s
pure speculation and probably wrong. Gluck completely integrated -- or, you
might say, "stole" Karr’s identity -- so thoroughly, I can’t tell where
Gluck leaves off & Karr begins.

Karr and Gluck are both gay. Gluck was not "panicked" by Karr’s reviews.

Gluck is one of the "new novelists." Others include Kevin Killian, Dodie
Bellamy, Kathy Acker, Steve Abbott, Bruce Boone. Pastiche -- "identity
theft" -- however you want to call it, playing with identity was & I guess
still may be a fairly significant aspect of their literary output. These are
all either women, or men who don’t identify as "heterosexual." I think, for
instance, that Kathy Acker -- famous for both completely fucking with
identity as well as "hijacking" others’ texts -- would maybe wonder about
your notion that this tactic was a "male" "heterosexual" game.

Wanda Phipps also talks about blurring gender -- not necessarily as a
strategy, but as a matter of course -- when she writes, in the interview I
did with her in Readme 4. You can read her interview & see for yourself
whether or not what she says sheds any light on this subject.

I remember seeing Lori Lubeski read her "boy" poems in San Francisco in the
mid-80s. They involved "the boy" going to this or that porno outlet, being
both excited and I think either disgusted or guilt-wracked, although not
super-disgusted nor super-guilt-wracked. (It was largely a kind of
confession.) I didn’t take this to be Lori’s disgust with men checking out
porno: it seemed pretty clear that "the boy" was Lori herself. An identity
she projected herself into.

That was emphasized when I read Rebecca Levi’s first-person accounts of
becoming "the man" in her zine, _Your Head on a Platter_. In her case, this
particular "identity theft" (or I guess "gender theft"?) was a huge sexual
turn-on. (I’ve talked with her about it since, so in this case it’s not an
educated guess.)

Going back further, what about Fernando Pessoa, inventor of 72 heteronyms?
"Antinous," generally regarded as his "most ambitious English poem,"
(written as someone else) which "describes a homosexual love affair through
a mixture of frank eroticism and perplexingly ambiguous metaphors. More
importantly, the poem relates the question of love to the mysteries which
Pessoa ponders in almost all his poetry: the nature of reality, the true
meaning of identity and the authenticity of experience." Pessoa is I guess a
question mark, so far as sexual identity goes: according to his biographers,
he never had sex. Was "Antinous" an example of homosexual panic? Homophobia?
Repressed desire? I’d want a very close reading of that poem to convince me
it was malicious or homophobic in intent. And a really well-researched
argument to convince me he was definitely hetero.

Is it fair or relevant to mention "George Sand" in this case? (Probably not
fair, I guess, though it does seem to complicate any assertion that an
"identity theft" is by nature "hetero male.")

Your arguments, as I read them, Jeffrey, as well-intentioned as I suspect
they are, are finally too simple, too black & white for me to engage with in
any serious way at the moment. You come at this literary device as a
moralist for whom this particular act equals this particular crime, rather
than as someone reading a large swath of literary instances and attempting
to place the offending instance within any particular context and making
some qualitative judgment, which would (I’m not just being rhetorical) be
appreciated. "Identity theft" is not -- as your argument insists -- some
slum populated by malicious or freaked out heterosexual men. It’s a literary
device that a lot of very different people have taken on and used for myriad
purposes. I realize you’ve said that you’re of "mixed feelings" about all of
this, but even then, there’s no evidence from your postings, which seem
purely accusatory, that you’ve thought about how various writers might take
on identities, play with them, see through them, write through them, or …
well, or anything. It’s as though, for you, the only possible reason someone
might write Ashbery poems or an imagined interview with Ashbery is somehow
to discredit, defame, slander, and otherwise harm the guy. For
sexual-preference reasons, to boot.

You’ve had no compunction about posting several times about this, each time
damning my own character & that of those who participated in this apparently
heinous activity.

I hope you won’t shy away from actual dialog about this.

But, you’re going to have to bring something of substance to the table here.

Bring it, or please stop harassing me in public.

Thanks,

Gary

one final (I hope) message about the POG pages ( www.gopog.org ) and
compatibility issues:

for Netscape it's a thin line indeed: pages work fine w current Netscape
6.1, but not w slightly older 6.0.

Not sure about IE back-compatibility issues (pages work fine in 5.5).
Probably somewhat better since pages were composed using Microsoft's own
Front Page 2002, but I'm not positive.

again, apologies re this latest small footnote to the Browser Wars.

For those who are looking for a new vocabulary to describe the events of
September 11, might I suggest the words "Hiroshima" and "Nagasaki"?

Also, the words of Celan come to mind again:

Probably most here have seen this from MSF but for those few who haven't it
again shows WHY & How America loses friends -- a basic irksome hypocrisy -
its efforts under the guise of world freedom or humanitarian concerns are
simply based on its own self interests & that's that. 37,500 air-dropped
single rations of GI meals, whose kidding who, but what's new, the same old=
,
sad story :-(

The UN estimates that 55,000 tons of food needs to be delivered to
Afghanistan every month to feed around six million people and that would
require about 1,800 separate Hercules flights a month which the US just
can't do.  Dropping a few thousand ration packs is wholly inadequate. A
credible, carefully planned international relief effort must be put togethe=
r
soon otherwise seven and a half million people could be dead come spring --
as one spokesperson commented, "an interesting way to win hearts and minds.=

Information dated 08.10.2001

MSF rejects link of humanitarian and military actions
Airdrops of food and medical aid described as of 'negligible value' and
'potentially dangerous'
=20
Press release, Islamabad, Oct 8, 2001: The international medical aid agency
M=E9decins Sans Fronti=E8res (MSF), which has been working in Afghanistan since
1979, today cast doubt on the so-called 'humanitarian airdrops' by US and
British military forces, which have accompanied the military strikes agains=
t
Afghanistan over the last 24-hours. Such action does not answer the needs o=
f
the Afghan people and is likely to undermine attempts to deliver substantia=
l
aid to the most vulnerable.

MSF's Dr Jean-Herv=E9 Bradol, speaking from Pakistan, explained that the
so-called 'humanitarian' action, was in fact a purely propaganda tool, of
little real value to the Afghan people.

Moreover, the deliberate adoption by the military of a 'humanitarian'
purpose, was likely to cause real problems for truly independent
non-governmental aid organisations who are less likely to be perceived as
impartial actors in the future.

"How will the Afghan population know in the future if an offer of
humanitarian aid does not hide a military operation?" questions Dr Bradol.
"We have seen many times before, for example in Somalia, the problems cause=
d
for both the vulnerable population and for aid agencies when the military
try to both fight a war and deliver aid at the same time."

Dr Bradol explained that the real impact of the much-vaunted 37,500 single
day rations on the burgeoning nutritional crisis within Afghanistan was
likely to be minimal.

"What is needed is large scale convoys of basic foodstuffs, rather than
single meals designed for soldiers. Until yesterday the UN and aid agencies
such as ourselves were still able to get some food convoys into Afghanistan=
.
Due to the airstrikes the UN have stopped all convoys, and we will find
delivering aid also much more difficult."

Doctors from MSF also expressed concern at the reported airdropping of
medical supplies. "Medical relief is not the same as dropping medicines by
plane. Unless they are administered by qualified medical staff, medicines
can actually do more harm than good", said Dr Bradol. "Dropping a few cases
of drugs and food in the middle of the night during air raids, without
knowing who is going to collect them, is virtually useless and may even be
dangerous".

M=E9decins Sans Fronti=E8res therefore rejects the idea of a humanitarian
coalition alongside the military coalition, as requested by President Bush
and Prime Minister Blair, and calls for the imperative necessity of
independent humanitarian action.=20

Thank You,

US-BRITISH BOMBING RAIDS SEEK TO CRIPPLE, NOT ROUT, TALIBAN FORCES IN KABUL
Ahmed Rashid: 10/09/01
http://www.eurasianet.org/

US and British bombing runs on the Taliban have so far not targeted Taliban
armor
and artillery emplacements around Kabul in order to delay an attack on the
capital
by the opposition Northern Alliance (NA). The early fall of Kabul to the NA
could
create even greater chaos, as long as there is no alternative Afghan
transitional
government in place.

Already, Ismail Khan, a legendary commander of NA forces in western
Afghanistan, is
close to capturing Chagcharan, the capital of Ghor province. This puts Khan's
forces in position to take the strategic city of Herat, opening a military
supply
route for his forces from Iran.

In three days of strategic bombing of Taliban targets, the US and Britain
have so
far taken out Taliban air power, airports, communications and command centers,
while special forces are reported to be combing the mountains looking for
terrorist
mastermind Osama bin Laden.

[For more stories about the US strikes, visit http://www.eurasianet.org .]

However, the US has held off attacking Taliban armor and artillery positions
both
around Kabul and in northern Afghanistan. The Taliban have about 200 tanks and
hundreds of pieces of medium and heavy artillery in both regions. Washington
is
calculating that once it attacks Taliban armor, killing their crews and
support
troops, Taliban units will quickly fragment and massive defections will
start. The
expected disintegration of Taliban fighting units would allow the NA to march
on
Kabul.

The Western alliance is reluctant to see the NA to take control in Kabul at
this
early stage in the campaign. The NA's premature capture of the capital could
create
administrative chaos and a vast exodus of refugees from the city. The NA is
divided
into four main factions that loosely represent the major ethnic groups in
northern
Afghanistan - Uzbek, Tajik, Hazara and the Persian-speaking Heratis in the
west of
the country. The danger is that, as each NA faction takes a major city, they
will
set up separate administrations - replicating the warlordism that prevailed
after
the collapse of the Afghan communist regime in 1992.

A repetition of the 1992 scenario would completely alienate the majority of
Pashtuns who live in the south of the country, and from whom the Taliban are
drawn.
Western diplomats say that the US and Great Britain are convinced that there
can be
no stability in Afghanistan without a major role for Pashtun moderates.

The only legitimizing authority in Afghan politics at present is former King
Zahir
Shah, who on October 1 set up the 'Supreme Council for National Unity of
Afghanistan' from his exile in Rome. The King is a Pashtun although his mother
tongue is Persian. The Council, which includes NA representatives, is still
far
from becoming an organized political entity capable of taking control of
Kabul and
other cities - even if the NA is willing to cede control to the Council.

The Council now has to nominate its 120 members - a process that could take
weeks
of discussion and haggling in Rome. Only after the composition of the Council
is
agreed upon, can an interim government be chosen from among its members.

In the meantime, NA forces are on the move. Troops under Ismail Khan have
captured
the airport outside Chagcharan, the capital of Ghor province, and are now
moving on
the town itself. Ismail Khan claims that the civilian population is now rising
against the Taliban. ''The most important fact is that civilians in these
provinces
are rising against the Taliban, they do not want to be under Taliban rule,''
he
told a news agency by satellite telephone three days ago.

Khan who returned from exile in Iran to Afghanistan to fight the Taliban
earlier
this summer, said that ''to win we need more money, men and weapons and we are
willing to accept help from whoever has our best interests in mind.'' So far
he has
received no help from the United States.

Major military advances by the NA and the fall of Afghan cities to the NA
would
also cause concern in Pakistan, which is opposed to the NA taking control of
Kabul.
In his visit to Islamabad last week British Prime Minister Tony Blair
emphasized
that any government in Kabul could not be unfriendly to Pakistan.

The Pakistani military has been wedded to the Taliban for the past seven
years and
has alienated every other ethnic group and even the Pashtun elite in
Afghanistan.
The NA still sees Pakistan as the enemy along with the Taliban. ''If Pakistan
is
allowed to play a key role in shaping the future of Afghanistan, it will play
a
spoiler's role,'' says Mohammed Eshaq, the NA envoy to Washington.

At the same time, if Pakistan carves out a large role in the formation of
Afghanistan's new political order, it will fuel immediate opposition from
Russia,
Iran and the Central Asian republics, which all support the NA, and have
always
detested Pakistan's fundamentalist Afghan proxies in Afghanistan. Such
tensions
could split the fragile military alliance in the region, built up
painstakingly by
the US and Britain.

One way out of this dilemma is for the US and Europe to go back to the UN
Security
Council and work to pass a resolution that would provide a UN mandate to help
form
an equitable broad based government in Kabul.

Zahir Shah has said that the UN could play a role in Afghanistan, as it did in
Cambodia in the 1990s. The UN is already preparing for such an eventuality. UN
Secretary General Kofi Annan has appointed the highly experienced former
Algerian
Foreign Minister Lakhdar Brahimi as overall coordinator for the UN's
humanitarian
and political strategy. Yet Brahimi cannot operate until the international
community, and especially Washington, gives him a mandate. ''The US needs to
clearly define its political strategy for Afghanistan in the next few days,
otherwise their bombs will only add to the political rubble that is today's
Afghanistan,'' says a European diplomat.

********************************
THE TOWERS WERE NOT HIT AS SYMBOLS=20
Paris, Sept. 21 (LPA) =ADEric Laurent, psychoanalyst at Saint-Roch St. in
Paris, President of the Ecole de la Cause Freudienne (AMP), sent to the
Agency the following comment: "Before crumbling down and therefore, before
remaining in existence forever as one of the names of horror, it was a
commonplace to say that the Towers were < symbols >. The Twin Towers, named
so after the two Rockefeller brothers, David and Nelson, who led the project
to completion, had come to symbolise the city. But which city? According to
critics, all significations found there a meeting point : power, wealth,
pride, war, but also peace, banality, incoherence. A symbol does not
represent one single signification, it rather embodies, as Levi-Strauss says
of manna, something inherent in the power of signification itself.=20
Architectural functionalism profoundly dislikes symbolism. It ignores
signification altogether and adheres to function. A house is a "dwelling
machine" (an expression minted by Le Corbusier). This semantic excision
entails paradoxical results: it does not function. At the Mies Van Der Rohe
exhibition I visited this past summer at the New York MOMA, it is possible
to follow the meanders of the river-process which opposed the sponsor of a
paradigmatic estate from the architect: the house was superlative yet
inhabitable. Likewise, the Twin Towers, considered as < office machines for
people in the finances > remained vacant for a long time.=20
It was not until the expansion of the so-called New Economy that they came
on a par with their function. They became thereby the symbol of the way of
life of the "upright city". They were therefore both function and symbol.
But before anything else they existed as object. The object dealt with here
is the surplus jouissance (or the "plus-de -jouir") extracted by Wall Street
from market globalization.=20
If the terrorists had targeted the symbol or the function, it would have
sufficed to strike at night when the Towers were empty. Their will, on the
contrary, was to reach for the object of jouissance and to kill people, to
achieve mass assassination, as widely as possible. Suicidal-killers wish for
death. They enjoy the other's dismay. Their transfiguration is widely echoed
by the media. Their ambition is to produce what would be the pure sign of
hate, that one which causes absolute hypnosis, nullifies all signification,
and bears witness to a will as massive as that of the God of Angelus
Silesius. In short, the cursed offspring is now born : the new swastika of
the XXI Century.=20
THE CRUMBLING DOWN OF SYMBOLIC REFERENCES
Paris, Sept. 22 (LPA) =AD J.A. Miller sent us his abridged translation of th=
e
article published today in Clarin newspaper in Buenos Aires, reproducing the
words of Abel Fainstein, President of APA (Argentine Psychoanalytic
Association, IPA).=20
He reminds us of the bombing of the AMIA (Argentine Jewish Alliance)
building in Buenos Aires in July 1994, in which 85 persons died, and the
participation of APA psychoanalysts in treatments provided at the City
Hospital (UBA) as well as in preventive work at schools in the attacked
area. APA also created a clinical research group on < Effects of social
reality on the psyche >, which is still at work.=20
The barbaric nature of the deed of September 11, 2001, explains Mr
Fainstein, exceeds any psychological possibility of comprehension. "The
anguish in the face of what had happened, the stupor regarding what might
happen (a war of unforeseen duration and without a precise aim) are such
that cause traumatism. The attack on the Twin Towers and the Pentagon is of
high symbolic value, because these buildings are symbols of the power of the
strongest country on the planet, for many the reference of liberty and
progress in the West. The crisis of symbolic reference points thus leaves us
defenceless against the requirements of everyday life. Everything that
happens in reality, and that which comes to us, we are used to understanding
(it) as a function of those points of reference. Their destruction leaves us
perplexed : we no longer know where we are placed."=20
The practitioner explains how psychoanalysis addresses the problem on the
basis of the theory of trauma : < Initially you must not try to ascribe too
much meaning to what has happened, but rather to reconstruct the situation
as objectively as possible on the basis of the perceptual data. Later on,
according to the nature of each case, you will indicate or discard a
psychological approach. Depression might ensue."=20
Abel Fainstein deals with the psychological effects of the attack on the
Argentine population, most of whom live now in extremely difficult economic
conditions, before giving a sign of optimism in which he trusts the social
link as capable of "making a barrier to the feeling of distress and to
threats of violence."=20
THE COLLECTIVE DELUSION OF THOSE RAVING MAD WITH DEATH
Paris, Sept. 23 (LPA) =AD J.A. Miller declared: "I received the Clarin artic=
le
by e-mail from my friend Mario Goldenberg, psychoanalyst in Buenos Aires,
joint Director of the EOL (AMP). It is not surprising that the most widely
distributed Argentinian newspaper was willing to publish a psychoanalyst's
comments on the events of September 11, given the penetration of Freudism in
all layers of the population. It is usual that the newspaper should address
itself to the President of the most important, the most ancient and
numerous, Argentinian Association of Psychoanalysis, which is present and
active in the intellectual and social life of the country. In this regard,
the APA is an example for psychoanalysts worldwide.=20
Who do you agree with, Fainstein or Laurent ?=20
Both! Their approaches are complementary. I will first emphasise that both
analysts, independently of each other, wished to comment on the event. One
of them does it on the LPA bulletin distributed by e-mail to the 3000
subscribers of the AMP-UQBAR list (in five languages: French, Spanish,
Portuguese, Italian, English) and in a paper edition to 500 personalities of
the French culture, the press, and psychoanalysis. The other one does so in
a national daily newspaper of over a million copies. We still have to go a
long way before we reach the Argentinian level.=20
Abel Fainstein and Eric Laurent know and appreciate each other, Laurent
recently lectured at the APA, Fainstein was interviewed by El Caldero, the
monthly journal of the EOL, the Argentine School of the Freudian Field. Abel
Fainstein is not Lacanian, but he admits to lacanian influence; in my
opinion, he would agree that his idea of symbolic reference points as
essential to the comprehension of "what happens" reveals Lacanian influence.

Yet they both say opposite things: Laurent thinks that it is not a matter of
symbols, Fainstein emphasises the symbolic.=20
No, it is more subtle than that. Laurent certainly centers on the "object"
aspect, yet admits that the Towers are also symbols. Fainstein centers on
the symbol, yet he deals also with the effects of the attack on the psyche
of living beings. In fact, each one of them illustrates the two angles of
present psychoanalytic thought: the aspect of the signifier, of the symbolic
frame, and the aspect of the object, of jouissance. These two moments are
not to be opposed but rather to be dialectically confronted.=20
What is your opinion ?=20
I don't know yet! I am slower. I am also handicapped by the fact that I
don't watch TV, and lately I don't have the time to read the press. I know
only what I am told, particularly by my patients. There I notice a positive
therapeutic reaction, obviously short-lived: "What are my little miseries
compared to =A9 ,etc." This effect was already noticed by Freud: at times of
war or catastrophe, neurotics improve. Conversely, these same events are
likely to cause delusions, even to trigger psychoses, but only in subjects
affected by this clinical structure: "wanting to be crazy is not enough",
used to say Lacan. As to perverts, the event is likely to satisfy sadism of
the strictest observance. There is, if I may say so, blood, voluptuousness,
and death (a title of Maurice Barres that Montherlant laughed at). But at
the level of the drive, we are all sadists. The great statements about
horror usually volunteered at times of catastrophe are a rite made to hide
the unconscious, illicit, morally inadmissible, satisfaction that the event
elicits in the subject. Furthermore, we are all survivors, so we are all
happy.=20
You will be blamed for that sentence!=20
What is the need for psychoanalysts, as Heidegger and Jean-Francois Revel
almost say, at these times of distress, if they say what everybody says so
well? The unconscious, the fact that there is the unconscious, means that
everybody lies. Psychoanalysts should do that a bit less. "We are happy",
unconsciously, no doubt, means also, as Abel Fainstein pointed, that even
thousands of kilometres away, we are all victims of the New York and
Washington attacks. The media, by spreading them, spread terror. They make
it fleetingly eternal in a suspended time, that of the phantasm. This what
Lacan called "between-two-deaths": physical death has taken place, but
before memory fades away and the event becomes reabsorbed in the immutable
order of nature where nothing ever happened, in that interval we extract
from the event which we consciously condemn, its unconscious surplus
jouissance.=20
September 11 made the Universal definitely present, effective, wirklich. The
whole world (almost, because TV does not reach everywhere, the depths of
Africa or my home, for example) spoke of the same thing at the same time.
There it is, the Global Show Society, brilliantly anticipated in the sixties
by Guy Debord following the thought of his teacher Henri Lefebvre, an
original kind of marxist. This is the planetary Puppet Theatre, echoed by
the compelling wailing of the tragic chorus : Horror ! Desolation ! Dismay !
Television, in particular, installs hypnosis in homes, as Eric Laurent
notes.=20
After having summoned a crusade of good against evil which indicated an
identification with the aggressor, the President of the grand nation
mourning made a fortunate appearance at a mosque. Bravo! In the U.S. there
is a powerful movement of enlightened opinion opposing obscure, war
mongering sectors. Their obscene sadism often finds open expression : they
discuss the vitrifaction of Afghanistan. This will remind members of my
generation of General Curtis Le May vowing "to bomb Vietnam back to the
Stone Age". We know the end of the story. We also know, from his Memories,
the subjective drama of Robert Mc Namara, maddened by the body-count.=20
The ways of reason must be explored beyond hate, horror and dismay. The sons
of Freud will not be intimidated by the good consciences of all observations
proclaiming their abjectness. The nervous system of the masses, as Nietzsche
put it, is today disintegrated by what he called "the collective delusion of
those raving mad with death", whose atrocious call "Evviva la morte" he
stigmatised, and in whom he saw the result of "training in penitence and
redemption" (Genealogy of Morals, III, 21, p. 331 of the NRF edition, 1971).
Public welfare, I weigh my words, requires today the revolt of
intellectuals. I call "intellectuals" those who make an effort "to think by
themselves" (Kant), and will not allow themselves to be manipulated by
opposing cliques of "ascetic priests" working hard to assemble the masses
and lead them to carnage in order to satisfy by their sacrifice the
jouissance of some obscure Moloch. Remember the Iran-Irak war. Basic
"anti-death" Committees are needed.=20
And you, what will you do ?=20
At the beginning, little, because I am starting from nil. I am thinking of a
monthly journal, which would be one of the organs of this necessary revolt I
am talking about, the clarifier of the New Enlightenment. I shall proceed
further on if this initiative should find an echo in the enlightened opinion
to which I address myself in priority. I will mobilise my friends, and also
those who are not. I count on the aid of the editorial house editing Lacan
since 1966, Editions du Seuil. Lacan is not being edited so faithfully for
such a long time without a feeling of emergency. American intellectuals are
manifesting. We read in Le Monde Susan Sontag, the great Barthes scholar
beyond the Atlantic. That is good. Long live America!=20

difficult to write hanging specifically from several hairs of the bin
 Laden beard
  from this vantage point it is clear that whatever i write today will no
   longer be true tomorrow
    it is from here nonetheless that i can only ask, should we not, so
     specifically, drop parcels of food so as not to make a mockery of
     relief workers, and instead leave people in a worse situation, if
     that in fact is possible
      and from the other nostril i would like to ask if we should desist
       the air land and sea campaign and admit defeat in honor of our
       several thousand already dead, but excuse me while the bin Laden
       beard does its duty in the frequent sipping of coffee, it is
       difficult to stay awake in this place when there is so much noise
       outside
        and i can only ask, should we not, so specifically, keep up our
        blockade of Iraq, which hardly makes a piece of literature, but
        does a reasonable job of killing the innocent children, and
        should we not, so specifically, keep up our full support of Israel
        no matter what horrors are committed on both sides, instead of
        positioning ourselves equally towards both Arab and Jew
         i am getting sick swinging back and forth, there must be some
          praying going on, should we not recognize Cuba and drop our
          embargo, it is there just off the shore, waiting for trade and
          Bueno Vista audience
           this constant praying gets me sick, everyone throws Korans,
            Bibles, flags, and human beings into the mix, when i sleep by
            the left part or the right part, it never ever stops, surely
            whatever god there might be is sufficiently vicious to let us
            fight it out in its dubious honor
             i must be moving now, one can only hope this beard holds
              still once and for all, where have all the animals gone,
              where have all the plants
               he has named his beard The Furious Slayer
                there is anthrax hereabouts, i will be gone in the white
                 ghost of this death, let us leave life to another,
                  i'm getting dizzy, don't like hanging by a hair

(What follows is a response by Slavoj Zizek to a post from Marco Mauas.  I'll
try and find Mauas' original post, but I'm posting this because Zizek
attempts to put the WTC bombing attack into a historical perspective, in
opposition to those who see every such attempt as an attempt to justify the
event.... joe brennan)


Reply to Marco Mauas
by  <http://www.lacan.com/biosB.htm#zizek> Slavoj Zizek
The worst thing to do apropos of the events of September 11 is to elevate
them to a point of Absolute Evil, a vacuum which cannot be explained and/or
dialecticized. To posit them in a series with Shoah is a blasphemy: the
Shoah was committed in a methodical way by a vast network of state
apparatchiks and their executors who, in contrast to the bombers of the WTC
towers, lacked the suicidal acceptance of their own death - as Hannah Arendt
made it clear, they were anonymous bureaucrats doing their job, and an
enormous gap separated what they did from their individual self-experience.
This "banality of Evil" is missing in the case of the terrorist attacks:
they fully assumed the horror of their acts, this horror is part of the
fatal attraction which draws them towards commiting them. Or, to put it in a
slightly different way: the Nazis did their job of "solving the Jewish
question" as an obscene secret hidden from the public gaze, while the
terrorists heroically and display the spectacle of their act. The second
difference is that the Shoah was a part of EUROPEAN history, it was an event
which does NOT concern directly the relationship between Muslims and Jews:
remember Sarajevo which had by far the largest Jewish community in
ex-Yugoslavia, and, on the top of it, was the most cosmopolitan Yugoslav
city, the thriving center of cinema and rock music - why? Precisely because
it was the Muslim dominated city, where the Jewish and Christian presence
was tolerated, in contrast to the Christian-dominated large cities from
which Jews and Muslims were purged long ago.
            Why should the New York catastrophe be in any way privileged
over, say, the mass slaughter of Hutus by Tutsis in Ruanda in 1999? Or the
mass bombing and gas-poisoning of Kurds in the north of Iraq in the early
1990s? Or the Indonesian forces' mass killings in East Timor? Or... the list
of the countries where the mass suffering was and is incomparably greater
than the one in New York, but which do not have the luck to stand in the
focus so as to be elevated by the media into the sublime victim of Absolute
Evil, is long, and therein resides the point: if one insists on the use of
this term, these are all "Absolute Evils." So should we extend the
prohibition to explain and claim that none of these evils could and should
be "dialecticized"? And is one not obliged to go even a step further: what
about "individual" horrible crimes, from those of the sadist mass murderer
Jeffrey Dahmer to those of Andrea Yates who in a cold-blooded way drowned
her five children? Is there not something real/impossible/inexplicable about
EVERY of these acts? Is it not that, as Schelling put it more than 200 years
ago, in each of them we confront the ultimate abyss of the free will, the
imponderable fact of "I did it because I did it!" which resists any
explanation with psychological, social, ideological, etc. causes.
            So have the events of September 11 something to do with the
obscure God who demands human sacrifices? Yes, the spectacular explosion of
the WTC towers was not simply a symbolic act (in the sense of an act whose
aim is to "deliver a message"): it was primarily an explosion of lethal
jouissance, a perverse act of making oneself an instrument of the big
Other's jouissance. Yes, the culture of the attackers is a morbid culture of
death, the attitude which finds the climactic fulfillment of one's own life
in the violent death. Yes, the ultimate aim of the attacks was not some
hidden or obvious ideological agenda, but - precisely in the Hegelian sense
of the term - to (re)introduce the dimension of absolute negativity into our
daily lives: to shatter the insulated daily course of the lives of us, true
Nietzschean Last Men. Sacrilegious as it may appear, the WTC attacks do
share something with Antigone's act: they both undermine the "servicing of
the goods," the reign of the pleasure-reality principle. However, the
"dialectical" thing to do here is not to include these acts into some larger
narrative of the Progress of Reason or Humanity which somehow - if not
redeems them, at least - makes them a part of an all-encompassing larger
consistent narrative, "sublated" them in a "higher" stage of development
(the naive notion of Hegelianism), but to make us question our own
innocence, to render thematic our own (fantasmatic libidinal) investment and
engagement in them.
            So, rather than remain stuck in the debilitating awe in front of
the Absolute Evil, the awe which prohibits us to THINK what is going on, one
should recall that there are two fundamental ways to react to such traumatic
events which cause unbearable anxiety: the way of superego and the way of
the act. The way of the superego is precisely that of the sacrifice to the
obscure gods of which Lacan speaks: the reassertion of the barbaric violence
of the savage obscene law in order to fill in the gap of the failing
symbolic law. And the act? One of the heroes of the Shoah is for me a famous
Jewish balerina who, as a gesture of special humiliation, was asked by the
camp officers to perform a dance for them. Instead of refusing it, she did
it, and while she hold their attention, she quickly grabbed the machine gun
from one of the distracted guards and, before being shot down herself,
succeeded in killing more than a dozen officers... was her act not
comparable to that of the passengers on the flight which crashed down in
Pennsylvania who, knowing that they will die, forced their way into the
cockpit and crashed the plane, saving hundreds of others' lives?

In a dramatic departure from the anti-terrorism bill adopted by the House
Judiciary Committee, Senate leaders have introduced the "Uniting and
Strengthening America (USA) Act" (S.1510), a bill that would significantly
undermine many of the freedoms that Americans hold dear.  It is likely that
this legislation will be rushed onto the Senate floor this week without any
committee review.

Among the bill's most troubling provisions are measures that would give the
government the authority to spy on its own people, enable the Attorney
General unlimited authority to incarcerate non-citizens, and allow the
government to expand its use of secret searches.

Take Action!  Don't allow Congress to abandon our cherished constitutional
safeguards during this time of national crisis.  You can read more about
this legislation and send a FREE FAX to your Senators from our action alert

Ron,
I check'd out the link you gave to the andrewsullivan site & am wondering if
you intended-- "The Agony of the Left" at
www.andrewsullivan.com/text/main_article.html?2--as the article describing
"How the right exploits left fundamentalism."

The address you
gave--http://www.andrewsullivan.com/text/main_articletext1.html--focuses
more
on the religious aspect of the conflict (though the axis of conflict posited
by andrewsullivan is liberal/fundamentalist instead of Christian/Muslim.)

Thank you for the links.  I raise a glass to everyone out there who spends
hours pouring over text-upon-text (the news slush pile) seeking words worthy
of mass-attention.  I have benefited immeasurably from you labors.
slainte,

Subject:      recent work
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII

(Sent to Webartery, on the most recent work - Alan)

I've not been participating recently so much, for which apologies - I'm
worn out and at the edge of a literal breakdown here in Miami, trying to
hold on. And in my work I've been doing things in Mathematica, a program
for Mac/PC/Unix/Linux - I have it on 3 PCs and a Mac G3 now - because it
creates an ambience I'm interested in - the ability to work closely with
structure in relation to transcendent or content - the content on one
level is nothing more than a residue, and on the other, it's the membrane
which evidences submerged operations. You can import various graphic
formats into Mathematica, then process them in a number of ways - matrices
for example (which are, in a simple way, present in Photoshop as well),
and functions - the last fascinates me. So a.jpg becomes f(a.jpg), and as
a function, it can be modified - its parameters can be modified - in a
number of way; the result on one hand is often a transformation that I
haven't seen before, but on the other, is a representation of an intricate
relationship between mathesis and what perceptually passes for the real.
Take hole.jpg, make hole = f(hole.jpg) and do a transformation on normal-
ized values and you might have (1 - hole) as the negative, (hole^2) as
high contract, (hole^.5) as flattening, etc.; but you can go farther with
the x, y, etc. coordinates - as if a calculated blast has transformed one
world into another - with information often lost, sometimes gained (over-
lay something with tangents and you've got additional peaks everywhere).
Beyond that, 3d mappings are possible, so that hole.jpg becomes a remapped
3d object or anti-object; the world is a charred world, a world turned
inside-out. In addition, you an export audio from Mathematica, and if you
work with tangent values again, as well as > 40,000 hz, you can use beat
frequencies, harmonics, subharmonics, all related to the program, your
hearing, and the machine, interstitial objects which often need no further
processing; everything is equivalent. Now I would want to take a slice of
a 3d anti-object, then a sheaf of slices, and construct audio from their
sequencing - or one might begin with an entire sequencing, producing audio
as well as an implicit three-dimensional object traversed by one or
another parameter.

All of this is a safe and perfect world; there are no errors, or errors
may be easily corrected; if something proves a blind alley, I can turn
elsewhere, create a different direction, withdraw from unknown functions
and objects, back into familiar territory. An enormous amount of memory
seems necessary for all of this, so rendering takes longer than even
Blender, but there is a comforting specificity in the results, a knowledge
that noise, randomness, death itself, can be beautiful and self-contained.
There is a relationship between all of this and my own demise or potential
breakdown, which I relate to the crystalline wonder of a curve or surface
- the sequencing of the Visible Human Project comes immediately to mind.

So I am making disks of images and sequences and sounds on mini-disk and
releasing them, thinking them through; some of them may find their way
into online directories. Meanwhile I am writing through these, as well as
writing through other surface-to-air, air-to-surface phenomena, trying to
make sense of a world, that, for me, is not utterly changed, but utterly
the same, with a semiotic war above all, in both senses of "above," going
on at the moment. I recognize my own broken existence, how impossible.

Then I can turn in the middle of the night back again through the sexual
video and images, into perfect mathesis, transform one sexuality into
many, one pornography into many, avoiding the pornography of violence,
taking a different path. I'm platonist to the extent that I believe, long
after we're gone, the machinery of mathematics will continue its intimate
relationship with the mechanism of physical or material reality; working
in the realm of number offers a glimpse touching on the asymptotic horizon
of subjectivity and the final bursting-point of perspective.

And I wonder - what is the phenomenology of (1 - hole), when there is no
content for the filling or the asking, when proper names and constants
have disappeared, when the "-" is a lever or a surface, rather than
subtraction or dash or identity assignment? What is keeping 1 and hole
apart - what is the normalization that involves the entirety of the world,
dis/played or di/splayed against the corrosion of blank space, virtual
particles, decathection degree zero? The equations converge and veer;
there always seems to be chaos as the computational limits of the machine
are approached, and one or another equation takes forever to calculate,
until memory, real and virtual, is exhausted. Then the program stops, and
the kernel of Mathematica (which is constructed like an operating system)
shuts down;  nothing waits for anything in this condition -

MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII

Dear Poetics,

A friend told me that Blair and Bush had been contemplating bombing
Aghanistan before S11, and that indications of such plans were available
in many different newspapers.  The ostensible reason for bombing was that
a terrorist was stopped at both LAX and Heathrow this summer.  Blair and
Bush then agreed to do something by October.  I don't imagine that what
was originally planned was extensive as this, since gaining the
cooperation of the states now involved would have been impossible with
S11, while any moves against Aghanistan would have added a layer of
complexity to Middle East peace talks.  I still regard this piece of news
as on the order of rumor, though.  A search through Lexis-Nexis did not
reveal anything about troop movements or even the capture of these
would-be terrorists.  So I am asking the list whether they have heard such
rumors, and, if so, can articles be identified that verify their basis in
reality.  I have not, as of yet, seen any pieces from progressives about
plans for an attack being in the works before S11, which would be really
odd if it was so obvious.

Robert

2. From DA to Yvonne Rainer

I'm not at all sure that this is the message we need to hear.

Robert Bowman flew 101 missions in a disgusting and immoral and
stupid war.  What kind of authority does that make him now that he's
a bishop and happens to have had a change of heart?  It's really
surprising how many intelligent and well meaning people repeat the
same mix of historical truths and hyperbolic prophecies,from which
they derive the same well meaning, banal and insufficient conclusions.
        There is no reason to suppose that a change in American
foreign policy will deter people who already have a developed career
in terrorism from continuing their career. What will Osama Bin Laden
do, become an independent filmmaker? There is no reason to suppose
that anything we can do favoring "the people of Iraq" or of Palestine
will reduce the aggressive ambitions of Saddam Hussein. Perhaps after
thirty or forty years of a balanced Near Eastern and Far Eastern
policy the children of the people trained in the religious schools of
radical Islam will begin to imagine that they have enemies closer to
home. Do you believe this? Meanwhile, during those thirty or forty
years how many terrorist attacks do you imagine we will have to
endure with Christ-like patience or Buddha-like indifference. Bowman
has come late to his knowledge of American imperial history. It's a
history we share with England, France, Belgium and Germany. The
reason they're not directly under attack is that we happen aat
presesnt to be he most powerful. The reason Canada isn't a target of
terrorism is not the morality of its foreign policy, but it's
relative lack of power. Now that Bowman has learned his belated
history lesson, he offers a cautionary tale and an absurd prophecy.
Sure we can't prevent every act of terror, but what makes him sure we
can't prevent a great many? We can make it more difficult to carry
them out. We can increase intelligence and disrupt the networks of
active conspirators whenever we find them. And we can increase
security to some significant degree, considering how slovenly it's
been up to now, making it more difficult to carry out attacks. There
may very well be attacks, but fewer if we take action against the
attackers. The question is not whether to take such action, but the
precise nature of action we have to take. And of course it would be
good -- for many reasons -- to rethink American foreign policy in
terms of our own real advantage and the ethical condition of our
actions. Not because it will change the opinion of our enemies and
turn them into friends, but because it will allow us a well-deserved
self respect.

I'm almost as tired of these people as I am of George W.

Best

David



3. From Yvonne Rainer to David Antin


First of all, everyone has the authority, you, me, why not Robert
Bowman? Does a "change of heart" disqualify him from speaking with authority?

I agree that security and "intelligence" measures can prevent some acts of
terrorism, but you have said nothing of the provocations of "surgical"
strikes against Afghanistan. If the U.S. kills ben Laden, he will become a
martyr and role model more than ever for generations to come. Changes in our
foreign policies will of course not make ben Laden and his ilk become
independent filmmakers, but looking further than greedy multinationals'
self-interested economic depredations has got to have consequences in the
long run different from our current catastrophic mess.

And Bowman's facts are right on; we can't repudiate them: The U.S. has
undermined and destroyed democracy in too many places. This is not diminished
by the fact that European nations are equally culpable. Yvonne



4.Dear Yvonne -- The kind of authority everybody has is no authority,
and that's quite good enough for an expression of opinion,which
Bowman is certainly entitled to. But his record in Vietnam is not
inspiring with respect to his judgment. Given his background, it
appears that he was as a young man part of the right wing American
Catholic "anti-Communist" world, that through its leading
representative in the US -- Cardinal Spellman -- played a large part
in placing a Catholic premier -- Diem -- in the position of powerless
power in Vietnam. He had no support in the Buddhist community and was
entirely dependent on the old French Catholic connections in Vietnam,
the American liberal cold war activists like Ladejinsky, and
propagandists like Tom Dooley. As Bowman was apparently a sucker for
this world of interventionist propaganda in the affairs of Vietnam,
one would want to regard his enthusiasms with some skepticism.

What he is right about is a great deal of history that is very well
known. Its relevance in the long run may be significant, but not in
the absurd way he proposes. No government will do anything that isn't
in some way in its own interest, or what its officials can regard as
its interest. Governments don't do "good". They never have and never
will. The attempt to straighten out American diplomacy is complex and
difficult and necessary. But any attempt to straighten it out will
benefit from a more honest assessment than Bowman's.

The American sanctions have not killed all those children in Iraq.
The sanctions were however a serious misjudgment that allowed a great
deal of suffering without accomplishing their end.  They were aimed
to  restrict Saddam Hussein's military capabilities by economic
constriction. But they underestimated Saddam's cynicism, his
ruthlessness and his intelligence -- his willingness to steal all the
resources generated by the oil he was allowed to sell, which were to
be used for the needs of the Iraqi population, for his personal and
military uses. He was willing to allow thousands of people to suffer
because he was aware that he could starve everyone in Iraq and that
Arab propagandists would blame all these collateral casualties on the
US and regard him as a long suffering hero. So, the U.S, once it
realized the failure of its policy, should have withdrawn the
sanctions and looked for other ways to destabilize the dangerous and
cruel and lethal Hussein. So more honestly stated, Saddam Hussein
killed all those people and dragged America in as a stupid accomplice
and fall guy.  You will not hear that version from Bowman. You won't
hear it from the Arab world, or from kneejerk Americans leftists. As
for what America did in Iran in relation to Mossadegh and
installation of the Shah, it was a nasty piece of oil politics played
with the approval and diplomatic connivance of the other Western
powers. As to what the mullahs did in Iran after they overthrew the
Shah, it was a nasty piece of Arab fundamentalist extremism, that
might or might not have occurred if Mossadegh had taken power. If
there is a reasoned Arab or Islamic liberalism or conservatism,after
years of suppression, first by the Shah and then by the mullahs, it
isn't in a very good position to speak right now. At least not in the
Islamic countries. If we try to improve our relations with the more
secular contingents in Iran too openly, the mullahs will step in to
cause trouble as they have over the last five or six years in which
anti-extremism has gradually reappeared. There is probably no very
good policy to undertake in regard to Pakistan, except to move
cautiously. They have a military dictator with an atomic bomb. He is
currently our ally and is supported pretty much by the middle class
and opposed by an intense if not very large minority of Islamic
fundamentalist Pakistanis and Afghan immigrants, and he is conducting
an ongoing guerrilla war in Kashmir. Go figure your policy there. In
Afghanistan,there is a disastrous and repressive fundamentalist
government, such as it is, in whose nest there is a conspiratorial
network headed by Bin Laden. If we attack him and his network of
co-conspirators and in the course of things destabilize the Taliban,
we may be doing the helpless people of Pakistan some kind of favor --
if we don't kill too many helpless civilians along the way. If we
don't attack him, we will lose helpless civilians. Pick your poison.
On the Israeli -- Palestine issue, It is hard to believe there will
be any solution that makes any sense with Sharon in power. Somehow
America has to convince an Israeli population, that already believes
the US is willing to sell them out for oil, that a serious resolution
of the settlement question and the creation of an integral
Palestinian state is the only way to arrive at a lasting peace. The
Israelis see themselves as the victims of an ongoing guerilla war,
the Palestinians see themselves as the victims of ongoing Israeli
aggression and state terror. What specific way to move here is not
obvious. Perhaps the good bishop has some answer, but I doubt it. I
haven't mentioned Syria or its client state Lebanon, but they
complicate matters also. My main point is that history is useless if
all you can use it for  is confession of past guilt -- though it may
appeal to Catholics.

The Broken Angel

Something which is absent flows nonetheless.
The words contain the table they are written on.
You can rest your arm on them.
Simplicity belies itself, occasion
Does more than reach out, it annexes
Moments by subtracting them. Occasion
Leaks through time, catching its hold on
The rough textured edge of conviction.
The "I" aspires to stretch its arms,
Move about comfortably, settle in.
But the invisibility of response, the familiarity
Of a certain dance which takes its same turns
While everyone is watching, emotions, thoughts,
Predictions, choices shift into a perfectly orchestrated
Ensemble:-this would not necessarily have to be
Recorded in notes, you could relive it day after day,
Century after century in a series of affective rituals.
Although it is self-evident you observe that
=ABThings live or die=BB you do admit
That birth is far from painless, you
Acknowledge human helplessness before diseases
Like A.I.D.S.-the multiplicity of forms of physical
And psychological cruelty that existence confers.
Should you deny this you'll never see the space
Between the glass and the landscape outside
Which we all agree is lovely and in tremendous peril.
The rebels are taking their positions,
The old fathers are constructing weapons,
People are fearing for their lives,
Nobody can take their eyes off the facts for a moment.
Over and over again you have to teach yourself
How to breathe, how to stand and talk.
Does this sound like you?
It isn't you, in fact, even though we share
The same world, the same trees, the same room.
Sorry about the broken angel, it's no one's fault.
Sometimes the years burst their seams
And growth goes where it will. But
There must always be time for fumbling through the memorabilia
=46or putting some order next to the scurrying chaos
If not around it:-a "running fence."

CALENDAR OF EVENTS

Monday Oct. 15    TOM DEVANEY AND HEIDILYNN NILSSON
Poet TOM DEVANEY is author of The Ameican Pragmatist Fell in Love. He writes
for the experimental puppet group The Lost Art of Puppet. HEIDILYNN
NILSSON's poems have appeared in Pleiades, TriQuarterly, Epoch, Agni, and
the anthology The New Young American Poets. She teaches at the John Carroll
School in Baltimore, where she lives with her husband. Nilsson has been
described as "a new voice in American poetry-intense, musical, unpredictable
and subtle-bringing a rare sincerity to transcendental concerns."  [8:00
P.M.]

Wednesday Oct. 17    KENWARD ELMSLIE AND BILL BERKSON
Publishers Weekly has described BILL BERKSON as " ...a serene master of the
syntactical sleight, transforming the mundane into the marvelous." Bill
Berkson is the author of 15 books and pamphlets of poetry including Saturday
Night: Poems 1960-61, Shining Leaves, Recent Visitors, Enigma Variations
(with drawings by Philip Guston), Blue Is the Hero, Lush Life, Serenade and
just out from Zoland Books, Fugue State. He is also a Corresponding Editor
for Art in America and a regular contributor to Artforum, Modern Painters,
Art on Paper, American Craft and others. Alice Notley describes much of
KENWARD ELMSLIE's work as having "been in the form of librettos and lyrics,
words for songs. Thus two things might be mentioned: a sense of a poem as
not so much a drama as a small theater, with a stage to be enlivened, and a
sound/metric influenced by popular song (as well as by something
Beat-poetry-like, in that use of the articleless pronounless word pileup
characteristic of people born in the 20s.)" Kenward Elmslie's way with words
cuts a singular swath through a polymath variety of forms. His works include
The Champ, City Junket (a play), 26 Bars, Routine Disruptions, The Grass
Harp (a Broadway cult-fave musical), Cyberspace and Nite Soil. [8:00 P.M.]

Friday Oct. 19    WITH OUT HANDS: SLIDE PRESENTATION, POETRY READING, AND
DISCUSSION
With Out Hands: A Slide Presentation, Poetry Reading and Q & A Discussion.
Liberian born painter/photographer
 will present a slide show with music, during which he will discuss the
political philosophies that inform his paintings and photographs.
Caranda-Martin, the son of a prominent Liberian government official, is
currently represented by Atmosphere gallery in South Chelsea. Some of the
work to be shown was exhibited in the Summer Salon at the Philadelphia
Museum of Art. A reception will follow the presentation. [10:30 P.M.]

THE POETRY PROJECT is located in St. Mark's Church, 2nd Ave. & 10th St. in
Manhattan. Visit our website at WWW.POETRYPROJECT.COM for more information.

Programs subject to change.

PROSE ACTS: October 18-21, 2001
Four days of contemporary radical writing and underground music in Buffalo,
New York

PROSE ACTS brings together importantly fearless poets, writers, and
musicians for an incisive four-day onslaught in/on Buffalo, New York. It
looks like a conference but thinks more like a festival. It acts like a
festival but will surface as a brainstorm. The participants are Dennis
Cooper, Eileen Myles, Dodie Bellamy, Kevin Killian, Lawrence Ytzhak
Braithwaite, Robert Gl=FCck, Sander Hicks, Matthew Stadler, White Collar
Crime, kari edwards, Roberto Tejada, Krakatoa, Ether Drag, and The National=
.
Prose Acts takes place - in the shadows - at The State University of New
York, Hallwalls Contemporary Art Center, and The Big Orbit Gallery. The
events will take place October 18-21, 2001.

Prose Acts involves multiple panel discussions, readings by each author,
sets by various musicians, and other related events. The panels, moderated
by Mike Basinski, Caroline Koebel, and David Schmid from SUNY-Buffalo, will
consist of round table discussions between invitees and the audience. The
panel topics:  "Flail the Narrative: Subverting and Reinventing Narrative
Expectations";  "Pop the Culture: Pop, Horror, Trash";  and  "Talking Dirty=
:
Sexual Politics, Pornography, and Desire." The panel participants: Dennis
Cooper, Eileen Myles, Dodie Bellamy, Kevin Killian, Lawrence Ytzhak
Braithwaite, kari edwards, Robert Gl=FCck, Matthew Stadler, and Michelle Tea.
In addition to the prose readings and panels, Kevin Killian, an acclaimed
playwright whose works are known chiefly on the west coast, will direct the
performance of the east coast premiere of his play "The Vegetable Kingdom"
(a play about Yoko Ono and game shows, among other things). The actors in
the play are Dennis Cooper, Dodie Bellamy, Eileen Myles, Lawrence
Braithwaite, Robert Gl=FCck, etc.

Prose Acts is the first major celebration of these writers' works and will
be a significant gathering of radical intellectuals from various
communities.=20

Aaron. You probably wern't: but this is an interesting link: Jameson puts
into words something I was trying to say: there are many issues or "aspects"
to this...so many that one nearly goes mad. Jameson would do well to talk to
Blair. How can I put it delicately: Marjorie Perloff and many others of her
general "class" are very well paid: essentially they are bourgeoius:
bourgeouis philosophy or mores predominate and in fact  permaeates the
thinking of many people throughout the world. After all , where's the next
pay day: who pays me? Liberal thinking of  kind that is essentially
simplistic. A more complex, or subtle modern mind, can see a strange beauty
in the logic or dialectical movement of hese events while retaining one's
basic human response: hence I can see the destruction of thetowers as being
poitico-aestheically poetic  or as Stockhaussen rightly realised: "a great
work of art": they were! This doesnt mean that the deaths of the people
involved thus becomes irrelevant. Patrick's "paranoic" view may seem
fantastic: but to simplify it is quite true that control by proxy and or by
direct attack and occupation by the US and Britain is historically and
economically of enormous importance to maintaining their ecnomic life: it is
a fact that China and even India, and the potentiallity of the Middle East
are as fearful to the ruling classes as Communism was when Marx proclaimed
his manifesto: the Right in the capitalist nations ARE terrified both of
others biting into their drug, oil, and many other products, and they also
hunger for massively greater control to increase and "soften up" the
availability and malleability of labour.
  Shock horror, millions starve etc and sweat but when the big symbols of US
Capitalism crash down what an outcry!!  Now there is the threat of an
unlimited war in which the western antions make the rules as they go while
hypocritically pretending to be humanists. Long live Bin Laden and
terrorism: terroism or freedom action is the hope of the dispossessed.
  And long live the working people every where: and let live now all kinds
of cultures and peoples just as we do all kinds of living things.
  I want to see the destruction of Capitalism and if that involves more
towers and more wars, then so be it: it is part of a long term struggle.
Bush is right: it will be long, long enough to see the demise of the US as
it is today.
 Ha! CIA: I support Bin Laden - come and kill me or arrest me I dangerous: I
support the Palestinians as he does: I'm dangerous - I'm 53, getting sick of
things - what have I got to lose: come on Big Bad America or Big Bad
Britain: come and cut my throat before I join the Jihad. Death to Bush and
Blair!  Richard.

Dear Friends:

As many of you know of the benefit readings happening on Oct 17th for the=

World Trade Center Relief Fund in NYC and San Francisco.  But, there is
an ironic outcome from the remarkable outpouring of money to the various
Sept 11 relief funds, there are many not-for-profit organizations in the
USA and else where that have not been getting their regular contributions=
.
 And a few are close to failing.  So, there are a few different things th=
at
I plan to do:

Besides money, Rattapallax Press is contributing 1000 new books and copie=
s
of our back-issues to various not-for-profit organizations to sell and ke=
ep
100% of the proceeds.

We will be donating 150 copies of Bill Kushner's collection to the NY Pee=
r
AIDS Education Coalition (NYPAEC).  Bill is a popular gay NYC poet associ=
ated
with the St. Mark's Poetry Project scene.  In addition, Bill has voluntee=
red
to host a few readings to raise funds for NYPAEC.

I have asked all of writers/poets to select a not-for-profit organization=

they support and commit to raising funds for them through readings and bo=
oks
sales.

I realize that I am small-fish, but hopefully this will raise some critic=
al
funds and attention for important not-for-profit organizations on the bri=
nk
of failure.

Cheers,
Ram Devineni

        I agree with Peter, but I saw Homeland (Fatherland?) security as many evil
methods to secure safety. I have been likening it to Robespierre's
"Committee for public safety"


From Robespierre's Republic of Virtue

What is the aim we want to achieve? The peaceful enjoyment of liberty and
equality; the reign of that eternal justice whose laws are engraved not in
stone and marble, but in the hearts of all men, even in the heart of the
slave who forgets them or of the tyrant who disowns them.
We want a state of affairs where all despicable and cruel passions are
unknown, and all kind and generous passions are aroused by the laws; where
ambition is the desire to deserve glory and to serve the fatherland; where
distinctions arise only from equality itself; where the citizen submits to
the magistrate, the magistrate to the people and the people to justice;
where the fatherland guarantees the well-being of each individual, and where
each individual enjoys with pride the prosperity and glory of the
fatherland; where all souls elevate themselves through constant
communication or republican sentiments and through the need to deserve the
esteem of a great people; where the arts are the decorations of liberty that
ennobles them, where commerce is the source of public wealth and not only of
the monstrous opulence of a few house.
In our country we want to substitute morality for egoism, honesty for honor,
principles for customs, duties for decorum, the rule of reason for the
tyranny of custom, the contempt of vice for the contempt of misfortune,
pride for insolence, magnanimity for vanity, love of glory for love of
money, good people for well-bred people, merit for intrigue, genius for wit,
truth for pompous action, warmth of happiness for boredom of sensuality,
greatness of man for pettiness of the great; a magnanimous, powerful, happy
people for a polite, frivolous, despicable people -- that is to say, all the
virtues and all the miracles of the Republic for all the vices and all the
absurdities of the monarchy.
In one word, we want to fulfill the wishes of nature, accomplish the destiny
of humanity, keep the promises of philosophy, absolve Providence from the
long reign of crime and tyranny.
What kind of government can realize these marvels? Only a democratic or
republican government.
But what is the fundamental principle of the democratic or popular
government, that is o say, the essential strength that sustains it and makes
it move? It is virtue: I am speaking of the public virtue which brought
about so many marvels in Greece and Rome and which must bring about much
more astonishing ones yet in republican France; of that virtue which is
nothing more than love of the fatherland and of its laws.
If the strength of popular government in peacetime is virtue, the strength
of popular government in revolution is both virtue and terror; terror
without virtue is disastrous, virtue without terror is powerless. Terror is
nothing but prompt, severe, and inflexible justice; it is thus an emanation
of virtue; it is less a particular principle than a consequence of the
general principle of democracy applied to the most urgent needs of the
fatherland. It is said that terror is the strength of despotic government.
Does ours then resemble the one with which the satellites of tyranny are
armed. Let the despot govern his brutalized subjects through terror; he is
right as a despot. Subdue the enemies of liberty through terror and you will
be right as founders of the Republic. The government of revolution is the
despotism of liberty against tyranny.

Two historical ironies I find very disturbing: the use
of "ground zero," previously used to decribe the
center of the U.S. attack on Hiroshima's civilian
population, and "homeland security," with it's echo of
South African apartheid.

Coincidence: two foreigners and non-Listees have the

Elizabeth Treadwell rocks (one reason: she has noticed
how Chris Alexander rocks.  Thank you, Chris, for all
of this.)

Most recently Elizabeth rocks for bringing up Country
Joe MacDonald and his statement about Vietname vets.
I have actually heard a lot of Vietnam vets calling in
to NPR for various call-in shows and yes, they do seem
to have a singular understanding of the deep problems
in our current military actions.  As one said,
"soliders need to know who they are fighting.  It's
great to have a mission if you know what the mission
IS."  His voice was shaking as he spoke.  It once
again drove home for me, someone who is often glibly
anti-military, just how hard war is on the people who
fight it.  The vets are just more casualities, in a
way.  This was certainly true in Israel, where
practically everyone over the age of 20 is a vet.  As
the intifada wore on, the Israeli teenagers who were
my sister's friends became less and less enamored with
the idea of serving in the Tzahal, and one friend shot
himself in the foot to avoid serving.  I knew another
solider who came home mentally exhausted from just
standing silently while children cursed him and threw
stones at him.  (This was someone who DID just stand
there.)  I know this doesn't make military action any
less wrong -- it's just a call for compassion for the
people who have been through it on that end.

i've posted this to another list, so apologies for the dupe:

but one of the most heartening websites out there right now is the
"veterans for peace" site, at

http://www.veteransforpeace.org

their call for international law enforcement---having participated
first-hand in the hell of war---is underwritten by a pretty keen
understanding of the history of the current conflict, and other such
conflicts... i think it was woody powell (?) of said org (korean war
vet) who, the other night, gave bill o'reilly a real run for his
money...

and the point is, B/C these folks are vets, they tend to receive a
fairer hearing (i'm not saying it *should be* this way, mind you)...

but check 'em out...

best,

Unocol, Bridas wooing Taliban for $4.5bn Pak
                                       gas pipeline



                Islamabad, June 1: Even as the Talibans are still
fighting to establish complete
                control over Afghanistan, three multinationals,
including two American, are
                trying to woo the Islamic militia for its support to
the proposed multi-billion
                dollar oil and gas pipelines to be laid through the country.

                The highly lucrative two pipelines one for oil and
another for natural gas would
                be laid from Turkeministan to Pakistan via Afghanistan
at a combined cost of
                $4.5 billion and the multinationals are leaving no
stone unturned to win the
                coveted contract.

                US multinational, Unocol and Argentinian Bridas,
fought a bitter fight over the
                $2 billion gas pipeline and according to media reports
here Unocol has already
                established an edge over its rival for the 1,300
km-long pipeline which would
                be up to the Pakistani city of Multan.

                But Bridas has reportedly entered into a `deal' with
the Talibans thus making it
                difficult for Unocol to implement the project as a
major portion of it would
                pass through Afghanistan and hence Bridas has to be
made a party to the
                contract.

                The fate of the more attractive $2.5 billion oil
pipeline, however, is yet to be
                decided and the latest entrant into this cut-throat
competition is Global Data
                Communication (GDC), another US multinational.

                GDC, it seems, has thrown everything behind winning
this coveted contract and
                that is why its president himself flew down to Kabul
last week to meet Taliban
                government minister for industries and investment
Mulla Ahmad Jan, according
                to reports reaching here.

                GDC has reportedly made a highly luring offer of $1
billion per annum to the
                Taliban adminstration as transit fee for the safe
passage of oil through
                Afghanistan.

                Jan had conceded during an interview with a local
daily that out of the three
                companies the terms and conditions offered by GDC were
most suitable.Apart
                from offering an annual transit fee the GDC has also
proposed to lay down
                railway track, road and provide electricity along the
pipeline and setting up
                police post at every 20 kms to be manned by Taliban's men.

                The taliban minister has said that they are yet to
take a final decision in this
                regard and would prefer the company which comes up
with the most attractive
                offer. The Unocol and Bridas are yet to make an offer
for this project.

                The project, for which Paksitan and Turkeministan have
signed a MoU during
                the `eco summit' in the second week of last month,
envisages laying of the
                1,700 km pipeline up to a Pakistani port in the Arabian Sea.

                The project also includes setting up of an oil
terminal at the port. The idea is to
                export oil to a third country in the region.

                The implementation of this ambitious project, however,
entirely depends on the
                political situation in Afghanistan as the Taliban are
yet to bring under their
                control some of the strategic areas in the central and
northern Afghanistan
                where war was still raging.

    Just as an info point, those three words are **always** present in
statutory language -- they are boilerplate.  Also, the sentence you quote is
prefatory to the actual law, and do not have any legal force.  So it's not
some sinister utterance intended to cover nefarious activities by the US
govt. The phrase is simply innocuous boilerplate.

 -- I think it's important for everyone, not only in the US but around the
world, to have enough of an idea about how the govt works so that you can
actually spot when it's taking short cuts with civil liberties and
constitutional rights.  That does happen, it *is* happening now, but this is
not one example of it.  So here's a bit more about that phrase:

   As for "and other purposes" - when drafting legislation, you stick them
on to that prefatory sentence all the time.  Ages ago, I drafted a law to
establish a federally funded Hearing Ear Dog program for deaf people, and
the prefatory sentence I wrote to that bill was something like " To
establish a program providing canine assistance to persons with hearing
impairments, and for other purposes."   It's totally routine.

 I mostly work to enforce the Occupational Safety and Health Act, which
begins with this sentence, which as you'll notice ends with the non-dread

MISSING THE OIL STORY
by Nina Burleigh

(Nina Burleigh has written for The Washington Post, The Chicago Tribune, and
New York magazine. As a reporter for TIME, she was among the first American
journalists to enter Iraq after the Gulf War.)

Recently I attended one of those legendary Washington dinner parties,
attended by British cosmopolites and Americans in the know. A few courses in,
people were gossiping about the Bush family's close and enduring friendship
with the Saudi ambassador, Prince Bandar, dean of the diplomatic corps in
Washington. By the end of the evening, everyone was talking about how the
unfolding events were going to affect the flow of oil out of Central Asia.

I left wondering whether 6,000 Americans might prove to have died in New York
for the royal family of Saud, or oil, or both. But I didn't have much more
than insider dinner gossip to go on. I get my analysis from the standard
all-American news outlets. And they've been too focused on a) anthrax and
smallpox, or b) the intricacies of Muslim fanaticism, to throw any reporters
at the murky ways in which international oil politics and its big players
have a stake in what's unfolding.

A quick Nexis search brought up a raft of interesting leads that would keep
me busy for 10 years if the economics of this war was my beat. But only two
articles in the American media since September 11 have tried to describe how
Big Oil might benefit from a cleanup of terrorists and other anti-American
elements in the Central Asia region. One was by James Ridgeway of the Village
Voice. The other was by a Hearst writer based in Paris and it was picked up
only in the San Francisco Chronicle.

In other words, only the Left is connecting the dots of what the Russians
have called "The Great Game" -- how oil underneath the 'stans' fits into the
new world order. Here's just a small slice of what ought to provoke deeper
research by American reporters with resources and talent.

Start with father Bush. The former president and ex-CIA director is not
unemployed these days. He's been globetrotting as a member of Washington's
Carlyle Group, a $12 billion private equity firm which employs a motorcade of
former ranking Republicans, including Frank Carlucci, Jim Baker and Richard
Darman. George Bush senior and colleagues open doors overseas for The Carlyle
Group's "access capitalists."

Bush specializes in Asia and has been in and out of Saudi Arabia and Kuwait
(countries that revere him thanks to the Gulf War) often on business since
his presidency. Baker, the pin-striped midwife of 'Election 2000' was working
his network in the 'stans' before the ink was dry on Clinton's first
inaugural address. The Bin Laden family (presumably the friendly wing) is
also invested in Carlyle. Carlyle's portfolio is heavy in defense and
telecommunications firms, although it has other holdings including food and
bottling companies.

The Carlyle connection means that George Bush Senior is on the payroll from
private interests that have defense business before the government, while his
son is president. Hmmm. As Charles Lewis of the Washington-based Center for
Public Integrity, has put it, "in a really peculiar way, George W. Bush
could, some day, benefit financially from his own administration's decisions,
through his father's investments. And that to me is a jaw-dropper."

Why can we assume that global businessmen like Bush Senior and Jim Baker care
about who runs Afghanistan and NOT just because it's home base for lethal
anti-Americans? Because it also happens to be situated in the middle of that
perennial vital national interest -- a region with abundant oil. By 2050,
Central Asia will account for more than 80 percent of our oil. On September
10, an industry publication, Oil and Gas Journal, reported that Central Asia
represents one of the world's last great frontiers for geological survey and
analysis, "offering opportunities for investment in the discovery,
production, transportation, and refining of enormous quantities of oil and
gas resources."

It's assumed we need unimpeded access in the 'stans' for our geologists,
construction workers and pipelines if we are going to realize the
conservation-free, fossil-fueled future outlined recently by Vice President
Cheney. A number of pipeline projects to carry Central Asia's resources west
are already under way or have been proposed. They would go through Russia,
through the Caucasus or via Turkey and Iran. Each route will be within easy
reach of the Taliban's thugs and could be made much safer by an American
vanquishment of Muslim terrorism.

There's also lots of oil beneath the turf of our politically precarious
newest best friend, Pakistan. "Massive untapped gas reserves are believed to
be lying beneath Pakistan's remotest deserts, but they are being held hostage
by armed tribal groups demanding a better deal from the central government,"
reported Agence France Presse just days before September 11.

So many business deals, so much oil, all those big players with powerful
connections to the Bush administration. It doesn't add up to a conspiracy
theory. But it does mean there is a significant MONEY subtext that the
American public ought to know about as "Operation Enduring Freedom" blasts
new holes where pipelines might someday be buried.

Hi Tom.

I'm not a fan of direct political work, in any of the arts, as I don't think
this kind of work holds past a particular issue, or time, which quickly
passes. A poem must (also) be in touch with a deeper, mythopoetic level. Too
many examples to name here, and this being a list of educated poets I'm sure
most everyone can think of examples of successful "political" poems. But I
think you're right about "ideological" poetry. If nothing else, they tend to
be self-serving. Political, however,  has to do with the body politic, with
our daily sweat of a People.

Nowar Collective*

=20

  Pipeline Dreams one of the factors which led to throwing Ms Benazir Bhutto=
=20
out of power  =20

The Herald June 1997 =20

 The two-years battle between US oil company Unocal and Argentinean firm=20
Bridas to build an oil and gas pipeline from Turkmenistan, across war-torn=20
Afghanistan and through to Pakistan has intensified after the Nawaz Sharif=20
government signed an agreement with Turkmenistan and Unocal at the Economic=20
Co-ordination Organisation (ECO) in Ashkhabad on May 14. Bridas has the clea=
r=20
support of the Taliban who have promised to give Bridas permission to build=20
the pipeline, while Unocal appear to have secured Turkmenistan and Pakistan=
=E2=80=99s=20
support.=20

 Nagging question behind this deal is why Pakistan has sided with one=20
consortium rather than the other. Since 1995, both the Bhutto government and=
=20
the military did not commit to one oil company. Pakistan=E2=80=99s earlier p=
osition=20
was that it would allow both companies to compete and then co-operate with=20
the one that built the pipeline first. But the reality is that the US State=20
Department is heavily backing Unocal, and Turkmenistan is desperately keen t=
o=20
garner US support for its oil and gas exports. Bridas=E2=80=99 problems with=
 Unocal=20
in Turkmenistan are generally placed at the door of a US desire to monopolis=
e=20
Turkmenistan=E2=80=99s energy. So the reason why Pakistan now seems to favou=
r one=20
company over the other is that the Sharif government appears to have bent to=
=20
US pressure.=20

 The protocol signed by Pakistan is deeply flawed. It makes no mention of th=
e=20
Afghan warlords through whose territory the pipeline would pass and does not=
=20
involve the Taliban in any decision making in the future. The Taliban are=20
expected to react angrily to this development.=20

 The Sharif government is banking on the ISI making sure that the Taliban=20
dump Bridas and go long with whatever Pakistan wants, a senior bureaucrat in=
=20
Islamabad explains. But that will not be so easy.=20

 History of Bridas and Unocal=E2=80=99s competition in the region is age old=
. However=20
US interest in laying pipeline through Unocal, was established in April 1995=
,=20
when Turkmenistan President Niyazov signed our government with Unocal (a 12t=
h=20
largest oil company in the US) and its partner, the Saudi Arabian owned Delt=
a=20
Oil Company to behind a gas pipeline extending from Daulatabad Gas Fields to=
=20
Multan. Unocal later signed an even more ambitious agreement for laying an=20
oil pipeline from Chardzhou in Turkmenistan through Afghanistan to an oil=20
terminal on Pakistan=E2=80=99s coast delivering 1 million barrels per day.=20

 Bridas also offered to build an oil pipeline but it suffered a setback when=
=20
President Niyazov banned Bridas oil exports and shutting down its other=20
operations in December 95. Bridas moved the courts and claimed 15 billion US=
=20
dollars in damages.=20

 Meanwhile, US pressure on Pakistan increased. During two trips to Pakistan=20
and Afghanistan in April and August 1996, US Assistant Secretary of State=20
Robin Raphael frequently lobbied for the Unocal pipeline, according to=20
Pakistani and Afghan diplomats. In August, Raphael also visited Central Asia=
n=20
capitals and Moscow. "We have an American company which is interested in=20
building a pipeline from Turkmenistan through to Pakistan," Raphael said at=20=
a=20
press conference in Islamabad on April 21, 1996. "This pipeline project will=
=20
be very good for Turkmenistan, for Pakistan and for Afghanistan."=20

  Earlier, in March 1996 another senior US diplomat had a major row with=20
Bhutto when he lobbied for Unocal. "He accused Bhutto of =E2=80=98extortion=
=E2=80=99 when=20
she defended Bridas, and Bhutto was furious," says a senior Bhutto aide who=20
was present at the meeting. "She demanded a written apology from the diploma=
t=20
which she got," says another aide.=20

 But in Ashkhabad, the Americans achieved their objective. In October,=20
Niyazov gave Unocal-Delta exclusive rights to build the pipeline.=20

 With all the odds stacked heavily against it, Bridas then moved to engage=20
the support of the Taliban. On May 4 in Kabul, Bridas and the Taliban=20
declared that by the end of the month they would sign an agreement to build=20
the pipeline.  Pakistan=E2=80=99s agreement endorsement of US oil company Un=
ocal=E2=80=99s=20
proposal to build pipelines from Central Asia may bring Islamabad into=20
conflict with the Taliban, who recently cut a deal with a rival company,=20
Bridas.  The reader may now understand the US interest in the laying of=20
pipeline and pressures it applied on Benazir Bhutto=E2=80=99s government to=20=
grant=20
contractors to a company of its own choosing when she did not succumb to=20
pressures this pipeline turned out to be one of the factors of Benazir=20
Bhutto=E2=80=99s downfall.=20
=20
*From the Nowar mission statement:=20
"The Nowar Collective is committed to a radical analysis of society that=20

PROSE ACTS AND SCOUT GANG UP IN THE NAME OF CONTEMPORARY RADICAL ART


PROSE ACTS brings together importantly fearless poets, writers, and
musicians for an incisive four-day affair in Buffalo, New York. It looks
like a conference but thinks more like a festival. It acts like a festival
but will be like a big brainstorm. Our confirmed participants include
Dennis Cooper, Eileen Myles, Dodie Bellamy, Kevin Killian, Robert Gluck,
Matthew Stadler, White Collar Crime, Roberto Tejada, Ether Drag, Lawrence
Braithwaite, and The National. SCOUT, a live compilation of writers and
musicians that began at Threadwaxing Space in Manhattan is doing a ten-day
event at Hallwalls in Buffalo. The first week overlaps and joins forces
with Prose Acts. Confirmed artists include Michelle Tea, Bruce Benderson,
Mary Gaitskill, Ishle Park, and many more.

presents

An evening with poets
CLAUDIA RANKINE & LINDA NORTON

Thursday October 11
7:30 pm, $7 donation
@ The Unitarian Center
1187 Franklin (at Geary)

CLAUDIA RANKINE is the author of three books of poetry:  Nothing in Nature
is Private, The End of the Alphabet, and-new from Grove Press-Plot.  Among
a growing number of younger Black poets at work in the U.S. with ties to
the Anglophone Caribbean, Ms. Rankine in this latest book  arrives at a
remarkable multipli-voiced feminine vision.  The poetry of Plot is often a
"thinking in pictures," in image and dialogue, memory, fragment, and story:

"Still to speak of loss is like dusting a thought much
farther away . . . farther than the moment the atmosphere
cries, I am lost though I am here."

As Barbara Guest writes, "Plot moves as in a picaresque novel, in which the
body schemes and frightens, accompanied by Claudia Rankine's instinct for
poetic surprise ."  Mary Gordon remarks, "I am awestruck.  Quite simply, I
have never read anything like Plot.  Its stupendous intelligence . . .
marks it as a masterpiece."  Ms. Rankine teaches at Barnard College and
lives in New York City.

LINDA NORTON's writing finds its way in the interstices where human lives
take place in the contemporary urban milieu.  Marked distinctly by three
American cities-Boston, New York, Oakland-her poetry and prose works are
restlessly interrogating, acutely keen to the singular nuance of people's
expressive revelations . . . knowing and wondering, intimate and exposed.
Ms. Norton  is an acquisitions editor for the University of California
Press, and an editor at Five Fingers Review.  She has published her poetry,
fiction, and non-fiction in Mandorla, Exquisite Corpse, North American
Review, and other magazines. Her postcard collages were included in a
recent show at the Kitchen in New York, Art for Plot, centered on art
inspired by Claudia Rankine's poetry.  She lives in Oakland.

     "April 26, 1992

     The boy on the subway with the lavish scar from temple to dimple.  The
scar    tissue isn't really tough yet.  Voluptuous cleavage.  I can see
_into_ him-- the coral-colored flesh beneath his dark skin.

     The temples--the sanctuary--his face--violated.

     He winks at me at Flatbush Avenue, where he gets off the train."

This is just too bizarre.  Ernie is showing up side-by-side with Osama bin
Laden in posters across Pakistan and Bangladesh...

Protestors in Bangladesh (9.OCT)

Protestors in Pakistan... (10.OCT)
http://www.tctubantia.nl/CDA/regioportal/1,2078,1654__772741_,00.html

A close-up of the poster, where the image of Ernie is unmistakable...
http://www.lindqvist.com/externsajt.php?externalSite=graphics/bert/bertbig.jpg&extNa%20%20%20me=Property+of+Reuter

All of these are the same poster, and the photos all seem to be from the
Associated Press.  It doesn't seem like there's some Photoshop'er doctoring
these photos after the fact.

Someone involved in making the poster either a) snuck him in as a little
inside joke w/ those wacky fundamentalists, or b) Ernie is bin Laden's
favorite character.

If 'b', then I know the solution: someone needs to go steal the Ernie
balloon that shows up at Macy's Thanksgiving Day parade and fly it into
Afghanistan as a kind of Trojan Horse.  We could have it broadcasting a
dialogue between Bert & Ernie that would go something like this:

    Ernie: Hey, Bert, you've got your troops in the Muslim holy lands.  Get
them out!
    Bert: What?  I can't hear you.  I've got a banana in my ear.
    Ernie (louder): I said, you're soiling the holy land with the footsteps
of infidels!!
    Bert:  What did you say?  I can't hear you.  I've got a banana in my
ear.
    Ernie:  Bert!!!  You capitalist heathen!  Your free market enterprises
are corrupting the planet!
    Bert:  What?!?  I'm really sorry, Ernie, I just can't hear you.  I've
got a banana in my ear...

And when Osama and his buddies come stumbling out of their caves we take
action against him.  Of course, I'd prefer we bring him back to the states
and try him under international law, but I know some of you out there would
probably just drop a bomb or two on him.  Either way, this plan is sure to
get some results.

In the spirit of all those lovely chain emails, let's start a petition.  Put
your name and city of origin at the end of the email and forward this on to
as many people as you can.  Consider the ramifications if you got $10
dollars every time someone downstream from you forwards this email to each
of their friends.  You'd be a millionaire!  And!!!! We'd bring Osama to
justice!  What a deal!

This plan is simple enough that I think even George W could understand it.
And I bet he'd get excited about it.

Yours truly,
Ernie

Since the publication in 1956 of A Coney Island of the Mind, one of the
most popular American books of poetry of the past half-century, with close
to a million copies in print, Mr. Ferlinghetti has published fourteen books
with New Directions.  His latest, How to Paint Sunlight, is just out.  As
Joel Oppenheimer wrote in the New York Times Book Review, Ferlinghetti
writes poetry ". . . in ways that those who see poetry as the province of
the few and educated had never imagined.  That strength has turned out to
be lasting."

Cofounder of the landmark City Lights Bookstore in San Francisco, located
on Broadway and Columbus, and publisher of City Lights Books, Lawrence
=46erlinghetti served as the first Poet Laureate of San Francisco
(1998-1999).

Historic Fugazi Hall--since 1974 "Club Fugazi" and the home of the popular
musical stage show Beach Blanket Babylon--was historically the site of
numerous poetry readings (among other occasions, Allen Ginsberg read his
famous poem Howl there).

Subject:      The Situation of Women in Afghanistan
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii" ; format="flowed"

I'm never sure how much use signing petitions is. But since so much
of the discussion on the list lately has been related to terrorism
and Afghanistan, I thought it would be relevant to forward this
letter and petition relating to state terror against women under the
present Taliban government.

d.a.


    Subject: Afghanistan's War upon Women

This is an actual petition,  and "signatures" will be lost if you drop
the
line. I know this is too  true and so dreadful.
Please take 3 minutes out of your life to do your part.  The government
of
Afghanistan, is waging a war upon women. Since the  Taliban took power in

1996, women have had to wear burqua and have been  beaten and stoned in
public
for not having the proper attire, even if this  means simply not having
the
mesh covering in front of their eyes. One  woman was beaten to death by
an
angry mob of fundamentalists for  accidentally exposing her arm(!) .
Another
was stoned to death for trying  to leave the country with a man that was
not a
relative.

Women are  not allowed to work or even go out in public
without a male relative;  professional women such as
professors, translators, doctors, lawyers, artists  and writers have been

forced from their jobs and restricted to their  homes. Homes where a
woman is
present must have their windows painted so  that she can never be seen by

outsiders. They must wear silent shoes so  that they are never heard.
Women
live in fear of their lives for the  slightest misbehavior.

Because they cannot work, those without male  relatives or husbands are
either
starving to death or begging the street,  even
if they hold Ph.D.s. Depression is becoming so widespread that it
has  reached emergency levels. There is no way in such an extreme  Islamic

society to know the suicide rate with certainty, but relief  workers are
estimating that the suicide rate among women must be  extraordinarily
high:
those who cannot find proper medication and  treatment for severe
depression
and would rather take their lives than  live in such conditions.

At one of the rare hospitals for women, a  reporter found still, nearly
lifeless bodies lying motionless on top of  beds,
wrapped in their burqua, unwilling to speak, eat, or do anything,  but
slowly
wasting away. Others have gone mad and were seen crouched in  corners,
perpetually rocking or crying, most of them in fear. When what  little
medication that is left finally runs out, one doctor is  considering
leaving
these women in front of the president's residence as a  form of prot!est.

It is at the point where the term "human rights  violations" has
become an understatement. Husbands have the power of life and  death over

their women relatives, epecially their wives, but an angry mob  has just
as
much right to stone or beat a woman, often to death, for  exposing an
inch of
flesh or offending them in the slightest  way.

Women enjoyed relative freedom: to work, to dress generally as  they
wanted,
and to drive and appear in public alone until
only 1996.  The rapidity of this transition is the main reason for the
depression and  suicide; Women who were once educators or doctors or
simply
used to basic  human freedoms are now severely restricted and treated as
subhuman in the  name of right-wing fundamentalist Islam. It is not their

tradition or  'culture,' but it is alien to them, and it is extreme even
for
those  cultures where fundamentalism is the rule.

Everyone has a right to a  tolerable human existence, even if they are
women
in a Muslim  country.

If we can threaten military force in Kosovo the in name of human  rights
for
the sake of ethnic Albanians, citizens of the world
can  certainly express peaceful outrage at the oppression, murder and
injustice  committed against women by the Taliban.

STATEMENT: In signing this, we  agree that the current treatment of women
in
Afghanistan is completely  UNACCEPTABLE and deserves action by the United

Nations and that the  current situation
overseas will not be tolerated. Women's Rights is not a  small issue
anywhere,
and it is UNACCEPTABLE for women in 2001 to be  treated as subhuman and
as so
much property. Equality and human decency is  a fundamental RIGHT, not a
freedom to be granted, whether one lives in  Afghanistan or elsewhere.

* "TICK" by Black Sifichi & Negative Stencil
Noise Museum Records <www.zone51.com/noisemuseum>19 rue Colson, 21000
Dijon, France
distributed in USA by Soleilmoon
<http://www.soleilmoon.com/index.htm> 61 minutes, $17

When he last visited the US in 1997, he saw America as a viral
"homogenized police and prison zone with granite skyscrapers,
surveillance and roadways that lead from one shopping mall to the
next." And people with their identities engraved on their credit
cards. "My identity is engraved in my soul." On his debut, Black
Sifichi, the compelling Paris-based DJ-poet-performer-photographer,
thrusts a series of highly original investigations of common cultural
clichs and maladies into our greasy laps. Once inside these
parasitic cultural transgressions, he sucks them dry before blowing
them apart. Sifichi's mind works on the basic principles of plastic
explosives: slap it to the side of an issue or icon and watch it
explode - icono-blast. Sifichi corroborates my own suspicions of a
serious disconnect between sound, intent, and received message. This
deterioration may be due to the ease with which language constructs
its "own" versions of realities - language as inaccurate filter
between human consciousness and external world. We are all its
cuckolds.

Sifichi works intuitively - heart as map, pulse as route. Language
tributaries pass through his spleen-shaped soul and emerge as a
manifesto that addresses the individual's responsibility to use
language effectively. This implies turning it against those whom
would debase or denature it. All is kinetic, instinctual,
pyrotechnical enthusiasm, sinister humor. Tick's sound, by Norsq (the
ambient/electronica producer of record in France right now) and Fagus
Sylvatica, (ex of the industrial flamenco band, Von Magnet) nurtures
the moods created by the texts via jagged, kinetic, reprocessed
compositions. Sifichi just showed up with a "lot of cassettes, ideas,
home-made demos, atmospheres and frameworks designed to enhance the
texts." The result: a taut equilibrium between sound and text.

I first met Scotsman and US ex-pat, Sifichi, when I lived in Paris in
the late-80s. I was impressed by his kinetic ability to aesthetically
rearrange any space or ambience he came into contact with. "When I
first got to Paris," Sifichi recalls, "I brought only my cameras,
darkroom, some cassettes and a recorder, and  clothes in a large sea
trunk. Paris was a visual place for me. A postcard dream-come-true.
Miller and absinthe. Cafs in disorder. Artists living like artists
should. The socialists had just taken political office. I fell in
love with ... Roma Napoli, a powerful French conceptual painter. I
took pictures all the time.  There was a lab just around the corner
and I had regular photo work with a few galleries shooting
catalogues, installations, etc." Escaping the US, living in London,
settling in Paris, moving from photos to poetry performances
characterized by their enthusiastic level of disturbance to radio DJ,
club DJ, and now he is recording with some of the top names in
European music such as Burnt Friedman, Black Dog, Norsq, BXT...But
can somebody really communicate how insane the world is through
insane works - "LeCirque Boule Quies" - when insanity seems to be the
state of things?

"'Cirque' is just a controlled manifestation of this state," Sifichi
explains. "There's too much to do, too much information, too many
visuals, too much compression in commercials, too many websites, too
many magazines, mobile phones, and too little original thinking. When
someone finally loosens their screws ... somehow it grabs our
attention and imagination... It's like they're visiting a place we
might know but have only touched upon in very brief moments. We try
to stay in control and the system expects this.  Even our close
friends don't want you to lose your 'bearings'. An escape to an
unknown and dangerous world.  Blade Runner really. The post
indust-cop-and-robot filled future. But this kind of
controlled-insanity also isn't good for the soul. The poor Clown in
"Cirque" is trapped in his circus. He's old. Probably done little
else in life. Repeats his act.... Television is a circus. A lot of
radio is another media circus. The music biz, the fashion market ...
so many people don't seem to be able to escape the terror of the
worlds they once wished to be ushered into."

On "Tuff" - "he kills those he hates, kisses the woman he saves /
it's real simple he's a cop, a super cop / one-man army ..." -
Sifichi fixes his shit-detector on the mediated macho ideal of the
hardened and hardboiled, offering a topdown stylistic deconstruction
of the cop/mercenary and the public's admiration of these sublingual
cyborgs. Where does the sumptuous pugnaciousness in "Tuff" come from?

"'Tuff' is just me taking shorthand while watching Rambo." Sifichi
explains, "I simply kept track of all the violence, its order, and
how it was done. Key scenes! 'Tuff' is a dark relaxed mirror of the
film itself. In some ways the film's violence, its everydayness,
shocked me. This police crap, this image of power and order that is
so prevalent in the USA is disturbing. Cops into Scientology!"

"Come To Where The Flavour Is" is a beautiful barbed shaft that
conflates the homoerotic with the homophobic and ransacks the
perpetual illusion of mediated macho - "then smoke me, ride me, hide
me, rope me, dope me to Marlboro Country ... tell me I'm a cowboy
..." A homosexual come-on corrodes its way into a dtournement of
deathwish macho. "Come" was reclaimed from  "more movies, more
advertising. Brainwashing. Cancer in full frontal public view. It's a
Western capitalist version of Russian iconization. How big's Marlboro
Country? Is it recognized by the United Nations? Is his cock as big
as his horse's? Do the Village People smoke Marlboro?  All the KKK
stuff around the pack is sickening. I really wanted to attack the
brand. Like the French attack McDonalds today."

There's also a customized retake of Gil Scott Heron's "The Revolution
Will (Not) Be Televised." We all know it's their media and that if
there is some deflationary appropriational tactic to be applied then
the revolution WILL be broadcast and it WILL pull in ratings and it
WILL mean absolutely nothing. Rigid Us-Them demarcations have gone
fluid without vessel, identities wrapped around opportunity - a vivid
perception shift since the 60s - appropriation effectively
supplanting censorship as oppressive tool. Sifichi message: don't
bother with television, let's find our own informational (tele)paths
divorced from TV's built-in compromises.


There's also the blisteringly imagistic "Beat Trax," where Sifichi
savages the passive deification / commodification of the Beats and
encourages people to stake out their own adventures rather than
idolize those who've "mad lived" for us.

"I don't believe most people are living an adventure today. Instead
they've fallen into idolization of others from the past - the Beats,
Rimbaud ... Oscar Wilde. They should be respected ... But they
shouldn't be treated like the equivalent of the church. Make yourself
the sacred cow. Take risks. Detach yourself from the material world."

Dear List-friends, List-Associates, and otherwise:

Attendant on my being laid off from my current job, I'll be losing this
email address effective at 1pm Pacific time today. After that time, please
direct all correspondence to my still-functioning home account,
cartograffiti@mindspring.com.

(I hope this works as a late answer to Aaron Vidaver's question a few days
ago. I'll be back soon, but lately I've been pretty consumed hustling up
contract work to keep myself in food and rent).

My best to all,
Taylor Brady

I dont agree but I'll agree to disagree. I think that whatever is going on
in the world that we think is "evil" we have to be careful. I'm not a
cultural "relativist" but nor am I any kind of "absolutist". In India
atrocious things are perpetrated upon women: women get bashed up and raped
all over the world even killed by men in the West.
  If we feel that there is an injustice, we  - not the United nations as it
is now - because it is really an American front - but a new United Nations
centred elswhere than Europe or the US - which must include ALL nations ,
and others: that then we study these situations (of inter- national
injustice, poverty etc) and initiate action with due respect to the culture
of the people in the countries in which we feel that "human rights"
(whatever they are ) need to be discussed and defined eg I dont think that
democracy (as the etc define it) either works or is always what other
nations want: ie there IS no real democracy anywhere and in some countries a
military regime is better,maybe for the time being ..I see the US to be at
the moment effectively a military regime. The problems of the world, the
inequalities etc, need to be adressed and debt needs to be wiped out and the
ideals of nations listened to that we disagree with (if we do): I think that
most of those people will then see that we are prepared to respect their
traditions cultures and ways, and they in their turn will be more likely to
be les skeptical of our so-called "progress" ..maybe we can persuade them
that the West are more advanced but as Kruschev said to Kennedy when pushed
on the qusetion of voting etc "At least we dont burn down churches full of
black people." Which silenced Kennedy...which is not to say that Russia was
"more advanced" han the US but Kruschev was pointing to possible arrogance
by the West. From memory (and "to be fair" as I say) (by the way I think
that Krushchev was one of the less dour of the Russsians and had a lot of
time for the US...but then he got the axe...)
   But the issue of the 11th of Sept is rather separate..or it needs to be
considered carefully as somewhat a separate issue: eg its not clear to me
that the Taleban or Bin Laden had anything to do with the attack - to what
extent they or anyone else may have been "justified" in that attack: whether
the US or the Israelis or some other "shadowy group were involved and so on.
It would be more productive for the US and the West overall to adress social
and political inequalities throughout the world and in their own countries
and  I include NZ and Australia and every one else as well as where we feel
there is some "terrible violation of human rights"...that is, "let he who is
without sin caste the first stone". We have to persuade and be prepared to
be rebutted: "Look, this is the way WE do things: go away and fix the
unemployment and suicide and homeless problems and low wages and the lack of
Unionist's rights and corruption with blue movies and prostitution and pop
stars behaving in disgusting and obscene ways (on obscenely high wages)and
industrial accidents and corruptions in your so-called democracy and your
racialism against various "foreign" religions or black people and even jews:
and are your women so wonderful? Hollywood gives us a terrible impresssion
of degeneracy and violence and sex and the humiliation of women asnd their
own SELF humiliation and usage of men in your own Western countries. Our
women that we marry are more faithful and kind and less devious, they are
virgins and good: they look after the children and keep the family together,
they are loyal, these are our ways: many women agree with these ways of
ours, some dont, let us agree to diagree here and treat each other as being
thus different. Then we can discuss things."
    There is no parallel here by the way with the regimes you mentioned: the
Pol Pot regime was probably created (I know in a rather elliptical way) by
the US paranoia, racialism and anti communisim which lead to the Vietnam War
and the atrocities of that perpetrated by your glorious "democracy" with
bombs dropped as toys ( cynically for children to pick up)....I dont know
anthing much about Pol Pot but I dont believe that the Khmer Rouge per
se...put it this way the East Germans were very involved in Vietnam...but I
dont want to go into that....
  The parallel for Hitler is the burning down of the Reichstag and then
blaming the communists as well as dressing Poles in German uniforms and
killing them: but dont forget that to dislodge a regime such as Hitler's it
was neccessary for British and American commandoes to become "terrorists":
that citizens were by and large spared when it was avoidable but not if it
was thought to be expedient in quickening Hitler's down fall....but these
regimes are not quite relevant to the Taleban.
   The US and Britain must stop this illegal and fascist war: then things
can be discussed and maybe issues adresssed. Richard.

I agree with this, Gwyn, but I think the Taliban government and the society
it's created are not a "culture" but a regime. Cultural relativism should
only be applied to a culture that is generally accepted by those who live in
it. Certainly, this isn't the case in Afghanistan. The fact that so many
punitive measures are enacted against Afghan women demonstrates that the
values of the Taliban are not values shared by significant sections of the
population - I don't think we should exempt Afghan men en masse from this
either. After all, the Taliban does not rule by consent - at times it almost
seems that its most vociferous supporters don't actually live under the
regime.

How can we not care about this? But then, what? And what about all the other
oppressive regimes that are not currently featuring on the news? I feel
useless. Writing poetry seems wrong, impossible - and yet - Someone recently
asked what people were doing, well I've signed on to help out with the local
branch of the Socialist Alliance and that's little enough, I'm feeling
guilty the way I used to back in the '70's,
at the same time thinking - who gives a shit about your phony guilt - it'll
pass - and it will. Sorry for the self-indulgence.

To return to what matters:
I recently saw a documentary about the last 20 years in Afghanistan and one
of the most powerful images was the face of a girl, about 12, I think. Both
she and her brother had had their feet blown off by mines, sufficiently
horrible for anyone, you'd think - but the boy retained some air of optimism
(maybe that's too strong a word) while his sister seemed utterly - blank?
despairing? - as the commentator pointed out, she would never marry, she
can't receive an education, can't work, has no prospects but to be a burden.
I think sometimes we're guilty of a sort of cultural arrogance that thinks
no one can have a valuable life without those 'things' we value - education,
work, health etc - but, in this case I'm sure that the girl concerned felt
her life was ruined.

I don't know what else to add.

I understand: this  is a terrible dilemma. But I acn be "proud" of being of
British descent but not proud or even troubled by Edward the 1st who
persecuted the Jews and slaughtered others nor proud of my "great" heritage
yet, yes, also proud without being arrogant: critical without hating myselkf
or even eg Blair etal or Thatcher (very different I know). Proud in a way of
being a New Zealander but unhappy with many of its policies (especiallyundre
seg Muloon and others who slavishly follwoed US poicy and was a cynical
"gnome" in the World bank: a bit worried by certain "capitalist poets" who
masquerade in this poetry as innovators. Proud of Alan Curnow, and so
on...of course NZ is not yet "in the firing line" and I know its easy to be
criical from the sidelines: its good that debate is happenning and we are
not blindly eg "for" Israel or "for" Palestine. We are thinking about these
things: how to resolve it..I would say in this case that the it wasnt the US
alone that got Israel into the mess: Israel's history and Palestine's fate
and maybe some inequities perpetrated by them and others...being in the
hands of certain "forces' and also the British, French and lateer the US but
also some of the more (zealous? aggressive? vicious? pioneering? visionary?
foolhardy?) Zionists....and so on. Un doubtedly also antio-semitism, which
is vile, was/is a factor: and some of the extreme right wing Israelis are
not helping. A mess: what to do. Certainly not more war.Less (or no?)
terrorism, more negotiation. Richard.

Father of Neutron Bomb Outlines Plan to "do in"
Taliban and bin Laden

Sam Cohen, the scientist who invented the neutron
bomb,
outlined a plan for the Bush administration and
Congress to use a small neutron bomb "to do in" the
Taliban and Osama bin Laden.  Cohen argues that the
use
of the neutron bomb against the Taliban and bin Laden
would go right to the core of the terrorist threat and
satisfy American "impatience."  Cohen stated in an
interview with NewsMax.com, "My offhand guess is that
the majority of Americans couldn't care less how we
'do in' the Taliban and bin Laden and company,
provided we get it done and [quickly]."

While Cohen agrees that the global terrorist threat is
going to go on for years, he has told policy-makers
that the "name of the game right now is Afghanistan
[and] bin Laden."  He also stated that the US needs
a quick highly visible strike to begin that war.
Because the Taliban and terrorist camps are "going to
be on the move" and will be burrowing and burying
themselves while continuing training exercises, Cohen
argues the US needs a carefully targeted weapon that
would impose "mass destruction," while providing an
element of surprise.  Cohen is proposing to
reconfigure Minuteman missiles by diffusing the thermonuclear
component and keeping the "trigger" at the kiloton
level.  The "kiloton fission" would be a deadly
force with a radius of about two-thirds of a mile
"towards killing people who are exposed."  According
to Cohen, this "ought to cover the area of a training
camp."

Pentagon Deliberates Use of Tactical Nuclear Weapons
in Retaliation

The US Department of Defense (DoD) recommended to
President George W. Bush the use of tactical nuclear
weapons as a military option in retaliation to the 11
September terrorist attacks on the Pentagon and
World Trade Centers.  In an interview on ABC
television's "This Week" Sunday Program, Secretary of
Defense Donald Rumsfeld refused to rule out the
use of tactical nuclear weapons in retaliation.  US
diplomatic sources said that the Pentagon recommended
the use of tactical nuclear weapons after learning of
the unprecedented number of US civilian casualties.

According to military analysts, Pentagon officials are
deliberating the use of tactical nuclear weapons
because of their ability to reach and destroy
terrorists hiding in an underground bunker while
"limiting" damage to surrounding areas.  The US
conducted an air raid on Libya in 1986 attempting to
kill Col. Moammar Gadhafi.  In 1998, the US
fired a cruise missile in Afghanistan attempting to
kill Osama bin Laden.  Since these attempts failed,
the DoD is recommending the use of tactical nuclear
weapons because they would cause greater destruction
than conventional air raids and cruise missiles.

It is the power of the human voice which is what we forget: people know more
poems than we think: poetry shows a common link between us. These are
powerful and gentle and gritty and beautiful poems you are quoting. Such
compassion and intelligence will be needed where people are directly hit by
this: that is something I keep forgetting myself. The "human face" of it.
I'd hate it to  lead on to crazy patriotism: but its a good "counter poise"
to the rather abstract or "detached" analysis  (neccessary somewhat) and
maybe to the rather "strident" and rather pitiless pronouncements we
hear:and which I have also   made...maybe sometimes one has to abstract. But
here's a poem I wrote about N.Y. (one of the few I've written in this
"direct style") but I was there in 1993 and I was thinking of the homeless I
had seen (I wrote it rahter quickly i  my hotel: my nerves werent good then
for writing poems) - they (the homeless) are here too but not so many as the
population s much less: and I read together with a more "abstract" poem at
the Nuyorican. Actually I got a strong reaction: i thought there would be
indifference but there was a quite "compassionate" reception. A sigh at the
end...I expected inddifference or "ho hum"....I also read it on the radio
here. In a way I dont like it as a poem: it probably needs "working on" (but
I'm too lazy to work on poems - I'm no Alan Curnow I'm afraid!!) and I dont
like writing this kind of thing per se but even though its a bit
self-consciously "histrionic" - I say  a bit - my feelings were quite
genuine (can feelings not be?). I must add that I'm not sure I believe in
God but I use that personge here...

                        New York, The World

Savage city - were I God -I would rip
Those clouds above you, and in a blinding
White, would let the healer down the sky
Reaching fire engine's ladder. He would
Clamber down with his Cross of  Love,
His seeds, his complexity machine, and his golden dimes.
The wasted, the alone, would cry out at his chimes.
But they are too many... and even God
gets lost in the homeless maze, and desire,
Hungry as a desert dog, warms his hands
At the fire bright sight of a woman.*
Too much shit "goes down" (as Bruce said)  in this crazed, frenetic cave.

God counts and recounts the people.

But they are perpetual in their motion. So he starts again. And again.

A man leans against a wall, head down with a cardboard sign:
"HIV Positive, Please Help."  But New York
Roars like hell: and the tall Hasidics whirl by,The whites whirl by, the
blacks whirl by -
The world whirls by. Some stop, and pay. I pause.
Most see him like a dead fire hydrant
Or a lumpo of iron, and they whirl on and on and into their human sea: but
I'm no better:
Before this thing on 7th Avenue,
I'm as dumb as stone.

           What shall we do?

      R. Taylor. Aug. 1993 N.Y. The Portland Hotel, 47th Street, Manhatten.

*No idea why I wrote that?!

That year the bomb had gone off in the North Trade tower but I completely
forgot that when I went up the South. Despite my critique of US Capitalism
etc I was greatly inpressed by N.Y. (and the people I met there) and of
course my feelings go to anyone who has lost those they know or love in N.Y.
I'll criticise America etc but I'll never hate it: in fact the greatness of
what is great about the US is not in question for me: I would fight for
"freedom" (there or anywhere) if I felt certain that some "evil" power was
about to attack the US (or other country: say NZ).  While I may "understand"
reasons for terrorism - I am watching warily: there is a point when the ends
DO NOT justify the means. At the moment things are not so clear......but the
above poem was not on that subject. Look: one doesnt criticise something one
thinks has some great worth or potential.

Some thoughts. I also read that poem on radio here in Auckland. Cheers all,
Richard.

presented by New York City.
2. Frank Lombardi, Chief Engineer of the Port Authority.
3. Giandomenico Picco, Personal Representative of the Secretary-General

Many of the poems being read will be selected from the enormous public ou=
tpouring

September 11th terrorist attacks.  All of the proceeds collected at both
readings will be donated to the fund. $15 suggested donation. Checks only=

made out the NY State World Trade Center Relief Fund.

>
>The United States wants this new agreement, now more than ever.
>And it is counting on the strong global support for its war on

>Trade Representative, equates support for free trade with the fight
>against terrorism. Declaring that free trade "promotes the values at

>

>differences between the wealthy countries of the North and the poor
>countries of the South were too great. The U.S., Canada and the
>EU have proposed an ambitious agenda that includes a number of
>new items, including investment, services and competition.
>

>before the launch of any new agenda.
>
>This assertion of the Third World was one of three reasons that the
>talks in Seattle broke down. The other two were massive public
>opposition to the WTO and a deep dispute between Europe and the
>U.S. over agriculture and food safety. Now, in the "new normal,"
>much has changed. Qatar is off limits to all but a tiny group of
>NGOs, and in the wake of the assault on the United States, the
>global protest movement, which prefers a political solution to a
>military one, is examining its role in the post-Sept. 11 world.
>

>British Prime Minister Tony Blair, and the two plan a united front in
>Qatar. The EU and the U.S. had already buried the hatchet and
>agreed not to let any disagreements between them scuttle new
>talks.
>
>Interestingly, when the WTO published its planned agenda for
>Qatar last week, agriculture was glaringly absent. So that leaves
>only the dispute between the North and the South.
>
>The Bush administration is now putting great pressure on Third
>World countries such as India to come on board the bandwagon; it
>sweetens its demands with debt-relief packages and trade offers
>such as the $8-billion (U.S.) emergency package for Argentina (it
>came hours before that country endorsed a new round) -- or the
>decision to ease economic sanctions imposed against Pakistan for
>pursuing its nuclear-weapons program in 1998.
>
>It is very difficult to predict where all this will lead. But it's
certain
>that there is much soul-searching going on among Third World

>over trade is the same as being on the "other side" in the global
>war on terrorism.
>
>The linking of the war on terrorism with the successful launch of an
>ambitious new trade round should give us pause for thought. Every
>year in our world, more people fall into poverty and more people die

>
>On Sept. 11, more than 35,000 children died of starvation around

>the World Bank and the WTO which favour corporate interests over
>social justice and promote a world of winners and losers.
>
>Do we really think that more of the same economic medicine will
>make the world a better, or a safer, place? Or is it time to use the
>meeting in Qatar to address the issues of global poverty and

I agree completely with Barrett. A similar misuse of
language involves labelling the Taleban's politics
'fascism'. This term, which arises from a large,
disputatious and politically-engaged literature,
should not be thrown willy-nilly at any reactionary
political doctrine or practice. If people want to use
it, they should first find out what it means.

Cheers
Scott

Chomsky is making sense here. I may be naive but I buy into this approach.

hassen,
  I'm not sure how receptive the mainstream media is right now to any but
the most patriotic poetry.  I just had the attached article rejected by
ASAP.  Obviously it might have been because it was not 'crisp' enough, but
on the other hand it may have been hesitancy to print anything that was not
obviously establishment.

Poetic Language and Actions in Crisis

=93Literary images serve more than merely as a means of
expressing ideas or of translating the pleasures of sensory=20
experience coherently into language but possess certain
immediate powers of their own (Bachelard, 1990, p. 11).=94 =20


     Psychological research has begun developing empirical insights into =
how poetic language operates.  As early as the time of Homer poetry was =
seen as having a special role in traumatic times, tragedy, war, and =
health and illness. Now empirical research is starting to untangle some =
strands  of language and develop some insights into how and why they =
work.  This paper will describe some of the parameters of what is known =
and apply them to poetic actions that might help during this period of =
crisis and turmoil.=20
     Even though we poets may be loathe to admit it, poetry is nothing =
more than a style of writing, but this style is a mode of thought and =
enaction and as such is a complex and resplendent being which includes =
poetic imagery, poetic language, and poetic enaction - the action of =
writing poetry.  =20
     Poetry communicates metaphorically.  It was banished for this from  =


Plato=91s Republic.  Maybe it should be allowed back in now as it is =
time=20

for revision of the metaphors that may have led us to this juncture. =20

One metaphoric route is through directions opened up by George=20

Lakoff and Mark Johnson  (Lakoff, 1991; Lakoff & Johnson, 1980). =20

Gibbs (Gibbs, 1994) has done some work on poetic metaphor.  Other=20

metaphoric routes have been taken in recent social (Simon &=20

Klandermans, 2001) and cross-cultural (Hermans & Kempen, 1998)=20

psychology.  This is too complex an area for adequate coverage.  The=20

focus will be on recent research that bears on poetic language and how=20

this bears on poetic actions (the actual writing of poetry) or poetics.  =
=20

     Poetics is a large field that includes the poetic process itself =
(e.g.,=20

Padgett, 2000), poetics or thinking about how you do it (e.g.=20

Bernstein, 1999), and philosophical approaches (e.g., Bachelard,=20

1990) and here I want to focus on the narrow aspect of poetics=20

concerned with enactment. There are at least three strands in recent=20

research which can be  distinguished although they are intertwined.  =20

These strands are language=92s as Working Memory (WM), its role in=20

health and trauma resolution, and its role in speaking poetically=20

in interpersonal and internet communication.  =20

Working Memory

     Even though to many, poets are scribblers hiding in garrets, poetry =


is a social activity.  Writing something down is an activity that takes=20

place in a space or an =93object=94 between writer and reader, one  that =


can function sequentially or interchangeably as working memory, a=20

mirror, transitional object (Winnicott, 1971), diary for disclosure or=20

secrets, =91words on paper,=91 etc.  While these are terms from diverse=20

areas of knowledge, the analogy is plausible.

     WM is a limited capacity system (Pennington, 1994), not to be=20

confused with short-term memory which has some executive functions

for tasks like attention and controlled processing.  Among other things. =


Klein & Boals (2001) found that =93expressive writing reduces intrusive=20

and avoidant thinking about a stressful event, thus freeing WM=20

resources.=94 for other tasks.

Health and Trauma Resolution    =20

     We are starting to gain insight into how thoughts and feelings are=20

written in this space and how specifically this writing affects health, =
the=20

immune system, and many other areas of functioning.  Klein & Boals=20

(2001), Pennebaker (1997) and Smyth (1998) are some recent=20

overviews of the complexities of current research on this aspect of=20

writing.=20

     There is an ever-growing body of research on therapeutic writing =
loosely based on Pennebaker=92s (Pennebaker, 1997) disclosure paradigm =
along with the developing Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count methodology =
(Pennebaker, J. W., Francis, M. E., & Booth, R. C., 2001; Pennebaker & =
King, 1999). =20
    It is important that this disclosure writing be =92emotional=92 with =


cognitive processing (either by the discloser or a therapeutic =
listener).=20

This disclosure should ideally occur in a safe place with provisions=20

for appropriate resolution of the material (Pennebaker, 1997).  =20

Speaking Poetically=20

     Poetic speech is often linked with musicality or making pleasant.  =
While the poetry I often read and write is often discordant, the =
psychoaesthetics (Franklin, 2001) of positive emotions, pleasantness, =
humor, and euphony, when analyzed in their specifics, do have =
connections to coping (Folkman & Moskowitz, 2000), health (Salovey,  =
Detweiler, Steward, & RothmanTaylor, 2000; Kemeny, Bower, Gruenewald, & =
Reed, 2000), and the immune system (Miller & Cohen, 2001).  Although =
research reviews  (Martin, 2001; Miller & Cohen, 2001) do tend to show =
only modest evidence for support for simple pleasant - health ideas, =
conceptually informed and methodologically sound research shows promise =
of yielding specific results.  In addition more rigorously =
conceptualized research programs are promising, like Vaillant=92s =
adaptive mental mechanisms (Vaillant, 2000) and the broaden-and-build =
model of positive emotions (Fredrickson, 2001) in which positive leads =
to positive in many areas, including the interpersonal and political. =20
Internet Lab in Action - Enactment in Real Time.
     An internet mailing listserv and exchanges of emails on it =
following the tragedy (what to actually call the September 11, 2001 =
=91event=92 and its sequellae is one important question facing the =
nation and international media. This question as language and image was =
actually discussed on this particular list) provides some insights into =
poetic language, poetic imagery, and poets=92 expression of their =
feelings in real time.  This particular list does have some =
distinguishing characteristics due to it=92s history and the =
international, =92experimental=92 character of it=92s subscribers, but =
this capability of definition makes it a laboratory for psychological =
investigation as well as an historical document of response by poets, =
mailing lists, the college-educated public, etc., to the =92event=92.=20
     After the =91event=92 there was a period of silence and then some =
emails enquiring about the well-being of friends.  Then a poet posted a =
message simply describing the particulars of his feelings and =
observations.  Even though in plain language this was a =93poem=94 that =
seemed to loosen the floodgates as it was followed by several others =
even though there were list members unable to write anything for awhile. =
 Thee is a discussion of a transitional object or symbol of the event =
and how this transitional object is and will affect future thought and =
actions.  In this instance WM is being analyzed as it poetically enacts =
history.
       =20
Dear Poetix People, On another list there's been a discussion about why =
poets are expected to soothe, honor, grieve, whatever, be turned to in =
the time of need and expected to produce a something out of this while =
folks in other mediums are not. (I'm not sure this is true!) And that =
it's a bit insulting when we're and our medium is usually, generally not =
all that respected. What do you think?=0A=

W.'S UNRELIABLE ADVISER ON ISLAM.
Blind Faith
by Franklin Foer

Post date 10.11.01 | Issue date 10.22.01
Cleveland-Marshall College of Law Professor David Forte might seem an=20
unorthodox choice for the role of presidential adviser on Islam. For one=20
thing, he's not Muslim. For another, he doesn't speak Arabic. His academic=
=20
specialty is U.S. constitutional law, and he readily admits that he=20
"dabble[s]" in Islamic jurisprudence. "That's why I call myself a student=20
and not an expert," he told me.
But thanks to the aggressive promotion of his work by two influential=20
conservative think tanks, the Hudson Institute and the Heritage Foundation,=
=20
Forte's writings on Islam have found their way onto the reading lists of=20
Defense Undersecretary Douglas Feith and the National Security Council's=20
Elliot Abrams. UN Ambassador John Negroponte has requested his oeuvre;=20
State Department officials have quizzed him on his views. And when=20
President Bush addressed Congress last month, he seemed to pluck whole=20
phrases from Forte's writings. Or, as one official told The Washington=20
Post: The president's speech was "Forte-ed."
In particular Bush has embraced Forte's argument that Al Qaeda are=20
theological heretics. They practice, Forte contends, an esoteric strain of=
=20
Islam that traces to a seventh-century sect. "[The terrorists] are not=20
religious," Forte told the Post. "They are a new form of fascist tyranny."=
=20
But Forte is a less than reliable source. The problem isn't just his weak=20
background in modern Islamic politics; it's his ulterior ideological=20
motive. Forte doesn't just want to redeem Islam from its critics. As a=20
Catholic conservative who serves on a Vatican task force on strengthening=20
family, he wants to redeem religious orthodoxy itself--or, at least,=20
cleanse it of the extremist stain. "Nothing this evil could be religious,"=
=20
he is fond of saying. It's a bromide that jibes perfectly with Bush's own=20
unabashed fondness for religiosity of all stripes. Unfortunately, it may be=
=20
wrong.
Until last month Forte's primary claim to fame was his writing on Catholic=
=20
legal theory. Along with a growing band of conservative=20
scholars--Princeton's Robert P. George, Tulsa University's Russell=20
Hitinger--Forte promoted Thomas Aquinas's theology of natural law. America,=
=20
they argue, was founded by men who agreed with Aquinas on the primacy of=20
transcendent divine law. But secular politicians have junked up the=20
founders' system, adding gratuitous and wicked laws. "Faith is an outlaw in=
=20
the public square," Forte lectured in 1996 at the Heritage Foundation. In=20
the Cleveland State Law Review in 1990, he compared government regulation=20
to the Pharisees, the rabbis who challenged Jesus. And when the laws of God=
=20
conflict with the laws of man, there's no question which side Forte takes.=
=20
He has proposed a doctrine called "justified non-compliance," which allows=
=20
citizens to "refuse to abide by" laws they consider onerous or morally=20
reprehensible.
Forte's interest in Islam began in law school with a B+ paper in a=20
comparative jurisprudence class at Columbia, which he later published. As=20
an academic and fellow at the Heritage Foundation, he continued to write=20
the occasional law review essay--on such subjects as the standing of=20
Islamic law in American courts, the Orientalist Joseph Schacht, and=20
attitudes toward theft in sharia (the body of Islamic laws). Only in the=20
1990s did his interest move beyond the theoretical. After assisting a pro=20
bono immigration case on behalf of Pakistani asylum seekers, he began to=20
write passionately about Islamic persecution of Christians.
Forte quickly found himself part of a growing movement, as former Reagan=20
aides Michael Horowitz and Gary Bauer helped turn Christian persecution=20
into one of the religious right's signature issues. But they soon faced a=20
problem: Islamic regimes reacted to the criticism by calling the=20
conservatives anti-Muslim bigots. It was Forte, according to Horowitz, who=
=20
figured out how to beat the rap. Henceforth the conservative activists=20
would cast themselves as Islamophiles, praising the religion at every turn=
=20
and dismissing the Islamic persecutors as traitors to their faith. As Forte=
=20
explained in his 1999 book on Islamic law, "Though radicals often create an=
=20
effigy of the West as a 'devil,' their real animus is against traditional=20
Islam."
It hasn't always been clear to which Muslim "radicals" Forte is referring .=
=20
In the past his chief targets have been regimes like those of Pakistan and=
=20
Sudan that oppress non-Muslims domestically. More recently, as Osama bin=20
Laden has taken center stage, Forte has adapted the argument to apply to=20
him. But the basic point--as articulated in a series of law review=20
articles, op-eds, and congressional testimony--remains the same: The=20
Islamic militants aren't true Muslims at all; they find their "inspiration"=
=20
in a seventh-century sect of puritan thugs called the Kharijites. "[They]=20
held that any Muslim who commits a sin was an apostate, an unbeliever who=20
could never re-enter the fold of Islam and must be killed." For over 50=20
years, as Forte describes it, the Kharijites ferociously opposed both the=20
developing Sunni and Shia traditions of Islam--going so far as to=20
assassinate Ali, one of the competitors for Mohammed's mantle.
The historical analogy is deeply comforting. Today's extremists, in Forte's=
=20
telling, are theologically marginal and far removed from the rest of Islam.=
=20
They represent, as he put it in a column posted on the Heritage=20
Foundation's website after the attacks, "[a] tradition that Islam early on=
=20
rejected as opposed to the universal message of its Prophet." And those who=
=20
say otherwise simply don't get religion. "We have a highly secularized=20
elite in media and government and the academy. When they talk about=20
religion it is often in a superficial and deprecating manner. When they=20
talk about Southern Baptists, they talk about gay bashing. When they talk=20
about Islam, they talk about jihad. They patronizingly assume that violence=
=20
is an essential part of Islam."
But serious scholars of Islam dispute Forte's interpretation. When I sent=20
his writings to Marius Deeb, a professor of modern Arab political thought=20
at Johns Hopkins University's Paul H. Nitze School of Advanced=20
International Studies, he told me, "This guy doesn't know what he's talking=
=20
about." When I approached Frank Vogel, Harvard's Islamic law specialist, he=
=20
said, "Forte produces some useful synthetic essays." Then, after reading=20
Forte's analysis of bin Laden, he was less generous: "His argument is a=20
gross simplification." None of the other top Islam scholars I polled were=20
willing to take their swipes on the record. But off the record they weren't=
=20
any more charitable. A sampling of the derisive comments: "He's not very=20
well informed" and "I'm afraid it's rubbish."
Indeed, it turns out there are significant problems with Forte's analysis.=
=20
Consider the role of the Kharijites, whom Forte says serve as Al Qaeda's=20
inspiration. In fact, bin Laden and his Egyptian theorist Ayman Zawahiri=20
rarely, if ever, invoke the Kharijites. (Among contemporary Islamic=20
extremists only the Algerian Groupe Islamique Arm=E9 have held up the=20
Kharijites as a model.) Al Qaeda's manifestos more frequently filch from=20
the teachings of the thirteenth-century puritanical jurist Ibn Taymiyyah,=20
who, as it happens, despised Kharijism.
Forte also ignores the influence of Wahhabism, one of modern Islam's=20
central movements. Emerging in eighteenth-century Arabia, Wahhabism called=
=20
for a new asceticism, violently opposing decorations in Mosques and=20
celebrations of the prophet's birthday. And it has at times sanctioned=20
violence against "infidels," both outside the religion and within. For=20
decades the Saudi royal family has aggressively promoted Wahhabism by,=20
among other things, financing Wahhabi religious schools throughout the=20
Muslim world. Bin Laden was born Wahhabi, and the Taliban--who graduated=20
from some of those Saudi-funded Wahhabi schools--have undergone a period of=
=20
what Olivier Roy, an Islamologist at the Centre National de la Recherche=20
Scientifique, calls "Wahhabisation." (Witness their destruction of the=20
Bamiyan Buddha, in keeping with Wahhabi prohibitions against graven=20
images.) You can even see traces of the sect's influence in hijacker=20
Mohammed Atta's will, which requests Wahhabi burial rites. But you wouldn't=
=20
pick up any of this from Forte, who never mentions Wahhabism in his=20
analyses. As Deeb told me, "He misses the real story."
Perhaps that's because, unlike the Kharijites, Wahhabis aren't marginal.=20
Within the United States, according to Hisham al-Kabbani, head of the=20
Washington-based Islamic Supreme Counsel, almost 80 percent of mosques are=
=20
presided over by Wahhabi Imams. The vast majority of them, of course, don't=
=20
support bin Laden. But understanding Al Qaeda's Wahhabi roots exposes the=20
simplicity of Forte's distinctions between good and bad, or real and fake,=
=20
fundamentalist Islam.
But Forte isn't the only one with a deep desire to acquit religious=20
orthodoxy of any bad deeds. The president wants to as well, which is why he=
=20
has parroted Forte's arguments. Liberals, who often assume that=20
evangelicals disdain other religions, have been surprised at Bush's=20
Islamophilia since September 11. At nearly every turn the president utters=
=20
homilies like "Islam is peace." He brags about his copy of the Koran, a=20
gift from the Imam Muzammil H. Siddiqi. Speaking off the cuff at the=20
Washington Islamic Center on September 17, he even posed as a Koranic=20
exegete: "The English translation is not as eloquent as the original=20
Arabic, but let me quote from the Koran itself..."
But this isn't surprising at all. Ecumenicism is a hallmark of Bush's brand=
=20
of evangelicalism and of his political program. His faith-based initiative=
=20
called for a popular religious front--"churches and mosques and synagogues=
=20
... that warm the cold to life"--against social decay. During the campaign,=
=20
W.'s speeches trumpeted "the transforming power of faith," laying bare one=
=20
of his first principles: Believers, no matter their denomination, are=20
better people than nonbelievers. That's what Forte believes as well. But it=
=20
is an article of faith--not the basis for a serious and honest exploration=
=20
of a religious tradition that Americans desperately need to better=20
understand. Of course nobody wants Bush to declare war on Islam, or on the=
=20
tens of millions who practice it and have no sympathy for Al Qaeda. But if=
=20
the United States is to win a war on terrorism it needs to understand the=20
enemy--which means acknowledging the extent to which religion influences=20
terrorists and their supporters.
The Hudson Institute's Michael Horowitz, Forte's biggest booster, describes=
=20
his significance this way: "A lot of people make the statement that being a=
=20
believer makes you a better man. Most people don't believe it. But Forte=20
helps you say it with conviction." But saying it with conviction doesn't=20
make it any more true.

Contentville.com (www.contentville.com) because they were selling all kinds
of texts from doctorial dissertations to Harry Potter and going so far as to
let the reader preview the 1st chapter. Well I went back today and noticed

The US Military has an Anthrax Vaccination program (gee, um, that's a
military site?  looks pretty promotion-minded for these guys):
http://www.anthrax.osd.mil/HTML_interface/default.html

The Us Military are paying some guys formerly known as Michigan Biologic
Products Institute (MBPI) to make the vaccine.  The first two of three hits
on their former name consist of many FDA violations, including "Failure to
provide separate or defined areas or such control system for the firm's
manufacturing and processing operations to prevent contamination or mixups."
Seems like they Military hired the right idiots so as to establish plausible
deniability.

No reason: but equally no reason to think that an atttack on an extremely
poor country will decrease the probability of terrorist attacks. OK there is
often a lot of hyperbole and "over the top" but there is truth in what Mr
Bowman says even if he maybe puts it a bit "directly". (Look at some of the
info on the oil connection). Obviously Big Bad America isnt responsible for
the woes of the whole world but what is neccessary is to see that violence
perpetuates violence. So as your country bombs Afgahnistan and threatens
others: then throughout the world many young men of  Muslim origion maybe,or
somebody in Iran or South America where there is enormous and obscene debts
owed to the US (who cynically collaborated eg in the murder of those in
South and Central America and also in Indonesia) or who are simply
dissaffected as they say: are probably right now plotting a life of
terrorism:one could do worse... (they might even be rich eg  living in
Beverly Hills) with some hacking and virus making thrown in. I heard and
Indian chap on the BBC comment "How can you wage war on an abstract noun?"
The Vietnam war probably gave rise top Pol Pot  (this can be shown as
mathematicians say)...maybe doesnt "justify" Pol Pot and all the
skulls...the persecution and poverty of Germany led (rather indirectly to
Hitler who originally wanted a strong Germany: which many people in America
and the West thought was good because Communism and Judaism would come under
attack)...the persecution of Jewish people and others lead to Israel and the
persecution (by SOME Israelis) of Palestinians some of whom dream of dying
in a blinding blast and so on....an analysis of the causes is your only
hope: not some crazy military adventure. If one missile goes astray away and
hits other nationals or the US turns on Iraq etal then I'll be right behind
the Jihad: this war is now a terrrorist generator as the Israeli actions
against Palestinians is as the terrible actions of the British in Ireland
lead to the glorious struggle of the Irish Republican Army's freedom
fighters. Bin Laden I see as a hero and I'm not even a Muslim!!You
academics, most of you, have never had to work in a factory in the "real"
world as I have at say NZ$7.00 an hour (do the conversion to US$): go and
live for a while with poor people (say in Chicago estate) as George Orwell
did. Become a black person as Howard Griffin did.
  What are the causes of "terrorism"  at what point does a so-called
terroist become a freedom fighter or is already a policeman beating a black
man to death in the US?   Richard.

Taleban Wipes out Afghanistan's Opium Production
     Jim Teeple
     Jalalabad
     8 Apr 2001 21:23 UTC

     U.N. drug control officials say Taleban authorities in Afghanistan have wiped
out the country's
     opium crop - the largest such crop in the world. U.N. officials say the action
is unprecedented, and
     Afghanistan's former poppy farmers need urgent assistance to help them make
the transition to
     farming legitimate crops. That transition is already well underway, but many
Afghan farmers think
     giving up poppy farming will mean a harder life.

     Digging an irrigation ditch in the hot sun is not easy work. For 56-year-old
Jamroz, who like many
     Afghans goes by one name, the work is backbreaking. It is also something he
says he is not used
     to doing.

     Until recently Jamroz did not have to worry too much about constantly
irrigating his fields. That is
     because until recently Jamroz grew opium poppies. Poppies are an ideal crop
for an aging farmer
     - they do not require much water. The only real work involved in farming
poppies comes when it is
     time to scrape the raw opium gum off the plant.

     Farmers like Jamroz have been growing poppies in the shadows of the Black
Mountains in eastern
     Afghanistan since before Alexander the Great passed this way more than 2,000
years ago. But
     they no longer do. Last year, Taleban authorities told them to stop. Now,
Jamroz and his neighbors
     plant wheat and onions in their fields.

     Surveying his fields, Jamroz says he willingly switched to growing wheat, but
his new crop has
     failed, due to the worst drought to strike Afghanistan in decades. He says
Taleban authorities
     promised he would receive international aid to compensate for the loss of his
poppy income, but so
     far none has come.

     Jamroz stopped growing opium poppies last year, after the Taleban's supreme
leader Mullah
     Mohammed Omar banned poppy farming. The Islamic leader backed up the ban with
a religious
     edict declaring poppy farming to be un-Islamic.

     Mullah Amir Mohammed Haqqani is the senior Taleban official in charge of poppy
eradication
     efforts in eastern Afghanistan. Working out of an office in the city of
Jalalabad, in Afghanistan's
     Nangahar province, Mullah Haqqani says he has successfully eliminated poppy
farming in the
     region.

     Mullah Haqqani says nearly everybody responded positively to Mullah Omar's
edict. He says there
     were a few farmers - maybe about 5 percent of the total - who did not want to
go along, but they
     were eventually persuaded to join their neighbors after mediation by religious
leaders and elders in
     their communities.

     Since the Taleban took control of most of Afghanistan, international drug
control officials have
     accused the Islamic hard-liners of being involved in the drug trade, and of
using their profits to fund
     military campaigns. This is something Taleban authorities vehemently deny. The
United Nations
     has imposed sanctions on Afghanistan's Taleban leadership for their refusal to
hand over accused
     terrorist Osama bin Laden.

     Some drug control experts also say it is still unclear how much opium was
stockpiled inside
     Afghanistan - from previous crops - and it is premature to say opium
production has been wiped
     out.

     But Bernard Frahi, head of the U.N. drug control program for Pakistan and
Afghanistan, applauds
     what the Taleban has accomplished in recent months - eliminating this year's
opium crop and
     wiping out 3,500 tons of opium production - or 75 percent of the global crop.

     "It is an unprecedented event - we have to recognize that - particularly when
it comes from
     authorities ruling a country - even if they are de facto authorities - it is
almost the first time this has
     happened," he said.

     Many Afghans say their success in eliminating this year's poppy crop is not
widely known in many
     western capitals where addicts use the final product of the opium poppy -
heroin. Sher Mohammed
     Abbas Stanakzai is the Taleban deputy minister for public health in Kabul. He
says, "If the same
     action would have been taken by any other nation or country I think the whole
world have
     appreciated it at least, and they would have supported that nation. But in our
case this was not even
     appreciated and nobody has mentioned has mention it. Anyway whatever we have
done we have
     done for the benefit of our own people - it was our own decision and we have
done it."

     Taleban officials and former poppy farmers in Afghanistan say wiping out the
opium crop does not
     come without a price. They say the international community should step in with
aid to help the
     farmers. But Taleban authorities say even if no aid comes, they will not allow
Afghanistan's farmers
     to go back to cultivating opium poppies. They say the religious edict banning
poppy farming is
     permanent, and opium will never again be harvested in the parts of Afghanistan
they control.

James Cook,

Yes, the Andrew Sullivan piece is called The Agony of the Left. His website
must title the "lead" (or most recent) piece with the same HTML name, then
switch when it goes into the archive. Sort of a dumb way to run a web site.

David Bromige,

That Brandeis student who started that petition has lost her email

its knees and also violated school regs re spam.

Ahmed Rashid's book _Taliban_ (Yale/Nota Bene, 2001)has excellent chapters
on Oil in the new Great Game. In fact, this book is the best background

Jeffrey Jullich encouraged me to forward this (additional) information to
the list.  Inquiries about the projects (and about purchasing a Box or a
postcard Book) should be directed to Mike Kelleher, mjk@acsu.buffalo.edu

JS

Dear Jeffrey,

Thanks for your interest.  Postcard project is the second in Elevator
Press's artist's 'zine series, which began with last year's Box Project,
featuring collaborations between Buffalo artists and poets from Buffalo and
beyond.

(For the Box Project, 15 poets collected 40 objects each, then documented
this collection in writing, while a Buffalo artist, Brian Collier, made 40
boxes to contain the objects and texts; the "zine" appeared in a run of 40
"copies" of the box-object-writing assemblage, each box having 15 different
objects and 15 different texts.)

The Postcard Project involves postcards from 40 poets (the postcards were
sent out blank, and returned with poems on the back) to my wife, painter and
sculptor Isabelle Pelissier: she painted over each postcard and made 40
metal books each of which will bear the painting on its cover and a booklet
reproducing 40 poems.  Kristen Gallagher is designing and printing the
booklets.

Isabelle has long painted on postcards; Brian often constructs boxes for his
installations.  The ideas for the projects take their inspiration from the
nature of the collaborating artists' work and the collective interest of
participating poets.

There are still some boxes for sale from the Box Project-- if you're
interested, contact Mike Kelleher:  mjk@acsu.buffalo.edu


Best,

Jonathan

Richard, I'll grant you women (and, hey, all of us,) in the US are not as
free as we might tend to imagine we are.
However the problem rests in your hypothetical theatre of the other --
playing at some international roundtable of cultural comparison, you write
"we" vis a vis "our women". Look dude, I'll agree with you the thing is
complicated, and raise you -- it's WAY more complicated than anyone using a
(generic, esoteric) male "we" is gonna grasp.

Barrett,

No, you're not the only person in here dismayed, again, too, in this use of
the term "left fundamentalism." The link to the essay by moral theorist
Michael Walzer was also disheartening. Are the four propositions that Walzer
argues against ("terror is a last resort," "terrorists are weak and can't do
anything else,"terror is the universal resort," "the victims weren't
innocent") ones that anybody has actually advanced? I notice that Walzer
doesn't cite any published writing to support this characterization of the
left. We do, however, have plenty of citable evidence of "the chorus of
national unity and determination." See below, courtesy of CNN.

Also, I think the term "left fundamentalism" here has a different
ideological function from the term "social fascism" as deployed by the KPD
in late Weimar. It's too early to see if the current term is put to service
more broadly by "the liberal-left" but it's also too early this morning to
sketch out what I think the distinction is, sorry--will get back if I'm able
to. The comparison is worth arguing about.

Molly Cheal - 3:26:31pm
I believe the only way to finish this is for America to go into Afganistan
and take that country over, weed out the organizations that are a threat to
innocent people throughout the world, establish a democratic government and
help to rebuild it.

Maybe we should send band aids with our bombs. it is an outrage to give
those afgans food and medicine after the way they danced in the streets
after destroying the trade towers , pentigon and the flight that crashed in
pennsylvania. Let them eat Oil. After all did they do it for the victims of
our country?

What part of NO! did they not understand. As a U.S. citizen & U.S. marine
Corps vietnam veteran, I say "GO FOR IT!!!" only lets do it right this time,
no half-stepping, we must not fail this time! and do not be fearfull! for
fear is a sign of weakness, some fear; is only a bit of good sence & given
insight to have. It's what terrorists play on; (fear) in which much what of
the street gangs try to do as well, It will and can not be tolerated. Proud
to be an American!

Tony Ryder -  4:28:44pm
First, I would like to say GO GET "EM BOYS!! to our Military, God bless you
and may you be successful. As far as the idiodic statements made by Bin Lad:
I tell you this, we are not in a state of Fear, or panic. we are in a state
of READINESS! There is a difference. We will now be on the look out for any
and all suspicious movements by anyone who even remotely looks "foreign" in
this country. He has sentenced all or his followers, here in the US and
other countries all over the world, to a new sort of no more "easy"
terrorism. No more just walking in and out and being cowards...they WILL die
for their beliefs. I think the most profound thing that the Bin lad.
followers have to look forward to now is a SHORTENED life span! Tony Ryder

Donna-Sue Howatson -  4:57:09pm
FEAR??? No Osama, not afraid in the slightest! My only fear, as a female,
would be to still be ALIVE in a terrorist run society! In a case such as
that I would welcome death and my ashes scattered to the wind!! No fear,
honey.... I hope they DO have the internet and are checking out message
boards and chats rooms visited by persons in the free world. I think the
REAL prevailing attitude of Americans (lack of fear) would make him pee his
"Aladdin" pants!! :)

lilylangtree -  5:05:14pm
Hot diggity dog, USA is finally carrying out what should have been done at
least two weeks ago. Go, go USA! Osama bin Laden and the Taliban: You
godawful cowards! You can run but you can't hide. I can't wait until the
coalition returns with your scalp and any other body parts, because as an
American, I want justice and retribution for every single life that you and
your terrorist buddies took on September 11 and previously. You couldn't
face the military but you're willing to take innocent lives. God bless
America!

eggslinger -  5:49:11pm
kill every last man,woman and child!!--fight at same level as
terrorists--send clear message to all concerned

Trisha Smith -  6:08:27pm
Bin Laden and the Taliban are supposedly not really afraid of death, since
they believe that they are going to see Allah and have an endless supply of
virgins (does that mean their heaven is all about screwing? Crazy). To beat
them at this 'game' is to find and use what they are afraid of. I found the
following posted on another message board, and I suppose it's a good idea,
except I think that would be better if there was another way of fighting
back without killing animals. Like maybe have some strippers chase them
around and tag them, since they seem to think that women are contaminated or
something -- just fooling. Anyway here it is: Once in U.S. history an
episode of Islamic terrorism was very quickly stopped. It happened in the
Philippines about 1911, when Gen. John J. Pershing was in command of the
garrison. There had been numerous Islamic terrorist attacks, so "Black Jack"
told his boys to catch the perps and teach them a lesson. Forced to dig
their own graves, the terrorists were all tied to posts, execution style.
The U.S. soldiers then brought in pigs and slaughtered them, rubbing their
bullets in the blood and fat. Thus, the terrorists were terrorized; they saw
that they would be contaminated with hogs' blood. This would mean that they
could not enter Heaven, even if they died as terrorist martyrs. All but one
was shot, their bodies dumped into the grave, and the hog guts dumped atop
the bodies. The lone survivor was allowed to escape back to the terrorist
camp and tell his brethren what happened to the others. This brought a stop
to terrorism in the Philippines for the next 50 years. Pointing a gun into
the face of Islamic terrorists won't make them flinch. They welcome the
chance to die for Allah. Like Gen. Pershing, we must show them that they
won't get to Muslim heaven (which they believe has an endless supply of
virgins) but instead will die with the hated pigs of the devil. That's
right. Use their own beliefs to back them off. Rub down mortar shells and
missiles with pig's blood soaked rags. Dip bullet tips in the blood prior to
their being attached to the shells. The spectre of going to hell creates far
more fear in the mind of a religious zealot, so if these folks in
Afghanistan want a war, we'll give 'em one. One in which dying in any manner
means an immediate trip to hell. Do you think they'll still want it, then?

New York - Year 2032 A father and his son are walking the Manhattan streets
when the father stops at a vacant lot takes a deep breath and tells his son:
To think that at one time here on this very lot stood the Twin Towers. The
son looks at his father and asked: Dad, what are the Twin Towers? Father
says: My dear son, the Twin Towers were two tremendously tall buildings with
lots of offices that was the heart of the United States, but approximately
31 years ago, several Arabs destroyed the buildings. The boy then thought
for a minute and then asked his father: Daddy what are Arabs?

Ken Engler -  6:32:02pm
Look how similar Islamic Radicalism is to Nazism. Nazi's believed the Ayrian
race was superior to all others. Islamic Radicals believe they are the
chosen of god, superior to all others. Nazi's used hate to unite people
behind common causes, with a special focus on Jews. Islamic Radicals preach
hate in the name of Allah, with a special focus on Jews. Nazi's took a
political movement (Facism -- One party control with a capitalistic society)
and turned it into a dirty word. Islamic Radicals are taking the Muslim
faith and unjustly dragging it through the mud by trying to use it to
support their hate. This has been stated to be a fight against terrorism.
Unfortunately, behind the terrorism is a cadre of silent supporters around
the world. Groups and individuals who preach Islamic Radicalism. Five
Hundred+ religious schools in Northern Pakistan who teach students the
beliefs close to the Taliban. Religious leaders in nations like Indonesia
who publically state an attack on a Muslim nation is an attack on all. To
destroy the threat of Nazism we had to capture and kill virtually every
strong supporter of this hateful set of beliefs, including the use of
Nuclear weapons to break the will of the Japanese. To destroy the threat of
Islamic Radicalism, we will have to do the same. Indonesia, India, Pakistan,
Iran, Libya, Egypt, Syria, Iraq, and other nations with strong Islamic
radical groups will have to either eliminate the supporters within their
nations, or we will have to do so for them. Doing anything less will allow
this cancer to fester and grow.

Steven A. Brown -  7:35:37pm
This popular idea about a sex change operation for bin Laden is sheer
fantasy. We would be sending him back to an Afganistan ruled by a new
government, not the Taliban. We don't need to capture him and put him on
trial, giving him a forum for his satanic rhetoric. All we need to do is
bomb him into oblivion.

Ramblin Bob -  7:38:53pm
Sick twisted animals like bin laden cannot be reasoned with. Their mind is
on power and being worshipped. Why people follow demons like him who will
send them to their death by suicide against defenseless people, and never do
it themselves is beyond me. I really wish bin laden would lead a suicide
attack himself. It would solve many problems. However, while keeping their
people completely ignorant of education, morals, and learning nothing but
their own twisted view on religion, followers will be there. What a religion
it is too! The animals who hijacked the planes were in a topless bar the
night before, the taliban sells heroine, and then kills anyone who is caught
using it...and the god they follow is a useless and cruel demon that would
create terror and murder with not only no remorse, but actually thinking
they are martyrs! I'll take my God instead. Would love to see their faces as
they awake to Hell and all it's fury thinking all along there would be
honeycakes and virgins as a reward for murder.

I am very happy with the way President Bush and the United States and our
allies have handled this situation. I think the bombings today will
hopefully send a message that anything but compliance with our demands will
not be tolerated. The Taliban and Osama bin Laden should pay for wounding
freedom. I would prefer capturing bin Laden and slowly torturing him instead
of killing him. After all "an eye for an eye".

Oscar Weatherby -  8:02:56pm
I appreciate President Bush's leadership at this time. I am neither Democrat
nor Republican (independent), and I didn't vote for him or Gore. But he is
my President, the leader of my country, and deserves my support. I, too, am
a bit suprised at his competency, and I believe he's doing a good job under
severe circumstances.

Richard, while I think I might be finding myself almost near a position to
agree with some of your points, perhaps--the ones that gesture towards a
larger critical-theoretical understanding of the present situation, so
called, and the comments on capital's need for malleable labour--this attack
on academics should be recast. I'd argue that individual scholars working
within institutions are more fruitfully criticized point-by-point over their
writing. Identifying the ideology at work in these institutions--and, in
particular, the roles played by anti-capitalist academics--can't be done by
simply pointing to salaries. The various positions within the
insitution--professors, researchers, instructional staff, university and
college boards and thier presidents, vice-presidents, deans, undergraduate,
graduate, post-baccalaurate students, post-doctoral appointees, dozens of
other types of professionals that work in health units, counselling centres,
libraries, recreation departments, media relations, publishing
operations--aren't usefully subsumed into the bourgeoisie. The functions or
effects of these positions need to be articulated in detail, with reference
to the social totality, and can't be glossed only in terms of the tradition
of bourgeois philosophical thought.

Doesn't Stockhausen's remark cling to that tired old notion of individual
genius in the work of art?

Aaron Vidaver
PS--I recommend against taunting Repressive State Apparatuses, even on a
literary electronic list like this one--it's really not worth the possible
consequences if you have no university or other institutional support for
financing legal defenses!

Message from Professor Karlheinz Stockhausen

After returning from Hamburg I find false, defamatory reports in the press.

I am as dismayed as everyone else about the attacks in America.

At the press conference in Hamburg, I was asked if MICHAEL, EVE and LUCIFER
were historical figures of the past and I answered that they exist now, for
example Lucifer in New York.

In my work, I have defined Lucifer as the cosmic spirit of rebellion, of
anarchy. He uses his high degree of intelligence to destroy creation. He
does not know love.

After further questions about the events in America, I said that such a plan
appeared to be Lucifer's greatest work of art. Of course I used the
designation "work of art" to mean the work of destruction personified in
Lucifer. In the context of my other comments this was unequivocal.

I cannot find a fitting name for such a "satanic composition". In my case,
it was not and is not my intention to hurt anyone. Since the beginning of
the attack onward I have felt solidarity with all of the human beings
mourning this atrocity.

Not for one moment have I thought or felt the way my words are now being
interpreted in the press.

The journalist in Hamburg completely ripped my statements out of a context,
which he had not recorded in its entirety, to use it as a vile attack
against my person and the Hamburg Music Festival.

This whole situation is regrettable and I am deeply sorry if my remarks were
misconstrued to offend the grieving families of the brutal terrorist attacks
on New York City and Washington D.C. I will continue to keep the victims of
this outrage in my prayers

I believe the USA killed 100,000 at Hiroshima; likely a similar
number at Nagasaki. These numbers so far surpass the 5-7,000 dead in
the WTC murders, that I would hesitate yo apply either Japanese
place-name to this instance of massacre. I mistrust such tampering.
It suggests a sense of proportion reduced to impotence through
crisis. We who are still alive ought to be very careful not to equate
two planes-ful of passengers flown into twin towera packed with
workers, with hundreds of thousands of civilians murdered by two
bombs flung at their cities.

I say nothing about motive in either case : I assume the same error
on either side, that there is an end that justifies these means. I
hope we don't get told a lot more of that.

One other point : I have thought a lot about one post to this List,
whose I forget, that pointed out that Islam is approximately 15
hundred years old. We might consider what Xtianity meant in 1500
A.D.: Hanging, drawing and quartering; burning at the stake;beading :
these horrors inflicted ipon fellow-xtians, often in part as a public
entertainment. Islam has had as yet no Age of Reason, whose
enlightenment abolished these indulgences, through more
sophisticated, unpublic means of minatory extermination.

I'm aware that our Age of Reason leads by one route to Hiroshima. It
is dangerous to wake up a sleepwalker--and everyone in the past looks
like a sleepwalker. But I wander. It is difficult to name fear when
it's here. It's like a giant egg has been broken, whoae poisonous
yolk ia flowing all over. It's also like being at a party where
drukenness tears comity to shreds.

We have to sober up, it's necessary to sluice off contamination. This
may not prove possible. And remember, for all WW2 did to reduce the
population of the planet, much of it is horribly overcrowded and
underfed. Can we start here, do more about this? Erst kommst die
Fressen, dann komst die Moral -- apologies for likely misquoting
Brecht.

Thank you Walter Lew for those very disturbing articles.
Dear Hassen, as for involvement/action -- outside of poetry -- it's hard to
see my way clear -- I am doing the same things I always do, only more so,
reading and listening and trying to keep up with my own thoughts and have
some relation with my feelings, and attempting to write things that might
matter at all. Karen and Ratapallax person (Rem?), I plan to look into
poets4peace, but to be honest I am really quite disappointed with the work
of Janice Mirikitani and L. Ferlinghetti that appeared in this Sunday's SF
Chronicle, and with the work of most of the "regular joes" who also had
their poems appear there. Mirikitani's in particular was a huge drag --
doctrinaire and ordinaire plus narrative and repetitive in the most unmoving
way. Easy. Easy as her pose in her photo. Once the makeup's on, there ya go.
Not fair, but still. Ferli's was simply surreal and boyish as per. Perhaps I
didn't hope for any more from him, from either of them, but still it was
disappointing. No wonder "people" think poetry is pious and irritating. Or
sweet and "uplifting".
Hassen, what are you doing? I ask for guidance.
I continue trying to keep a spot open for other ways with language at SPT. I
donate more money than I think I can afford to SPD. I sign petitions that I
have not much hope for. I wrote to Barbara Lee. I let the girl at the cafe
tell me how stupid she thinks the protestors are to say it's a racist war. I
have nothing to say. Not that quickly.
Thank you Gwyn and Geraldine for your comments on cultural relativism re the
Taliban. It remains extraordinary to me that the issue of sexism is so much
harder for people to grasp than the issue of racism. But I think I know why
-- intimacy. I once said, how could we have allowed them to do this to us?
(Meaning our brothers, fathers, sons in a patriarchy) and a Jewish friend
said, it's just like the Holocaust, neighbor against neighbor. But it's
closer than that, and that is what makes it so hard to negotiate. Maybe.
Molly Ivins had a good piece about International Law also on Sunday.
A young woman reporter from Salon.com was featured on a local TV show
reporting over the phone from Afghanistan, about sitting with grandmas and
mullahs alike -- she was unrushed in her reportage, much to the chagrin of
her host.
The grandmas she talked to were anti-US and semi-pro-bin Laden. So what can
you say? That whole village murdered.
Well, no doubt I've said both too little and too much.

in saying that "we are finding the news in poetry," he elides the bit
about "it is difficult."

This difficulty that poetry variously presents is necessary.
Otherwise, it would be easy. It is built in, s part of the thing a
poem is. It is too bad that this scares people off.It is too bad that
people expect a quick, easy solution to the problem of being alive.
Thwy might try suicide.

But the learning of a poem is how one cxomes to read it. "Poetry is
the theory of heartreak." We're all going to die. One wonders whether
those "high-level language games" to which he takes exception are
simply more of a difficulty to Bob than he xan undertake: I daresay I
know some poems rhat fall under the umbrella of his distaste, poems
that have meant a lot to me--that havw kept me alive.

Are we all looking for an easy fix? Well yes--and no. I miss the "no"
in Bob's reassuring letter.

   David.

PAUL AUSTER, from his early friendship and correspondence with the late
Objectivist poet George Oppen, to his essays on Oppen's poetry and on the
poetry of Oppen's friend and contemporary Charles Reznikoff (collected in
The Art of Hunger), has brought a sharp, attentive eye and unusual insight
to the task of recognizing and naming the rare value to be found in these
writers' works.  Mr. Auster, visiting from his home in Brooklyn, New York,
will be addressing the extraordinary lyric work of Charles Reznikoff-"a
poet of the eye," as he noted concisely in his essay "The Decisive
Moment"-for The Poetry Center's 17th annual Oppen Memorial Lecture.
Celebrated internationally for his eight novels and several films,
including Smoke and The Center of the World (both with Wayne Wang), he has
written several volumes of poetry, including Disappearances: Selected
Poems, half a dozen acclaimed translations from French (Joseph Joubert,
Mallarm=E9, Philippe Petit, Maurice Blanchot, Pierre Clastres), and edited
the remarkable Random House Book of Twentieth-Century French Poetry.

"This tree in the twilit street -
the pods hang from its bare symmetrical branches
motionless -
but if, like God, a century were to us
the twinkling of an eye,
we should see the frenzy of growth."
        -Charles Reznikoff (cited in "The Decisive Moment")

For some time now, I've felt very lucky to see Beth Bosworth's fiction
straight off the pen or the keyboard, as it were, and so I feel privileged
to read with her at Walter Rossi Gallery, 231 Eldridge Street between East
Houston and Stanton, on Sunday, October 28, at 5:00 p.m.  The reading is
free and the furniture gallery is extraordinary.

Well, this may be the first time that it has ever happened, but I think that
David Bromige has missed the IRONY in my post.

To talk about scale:

At Hiroshima, about 130,000 died or were seriously damaged;  another 176,000
were left homeless.  That means that we are talking about maybe 85% of the
population of the entire city.  Ten square kilometers were completely
destroyed; that means that something like 68% of all of the buildings in the
city were utterly destroyed and another 24% were damaged:  we're talking
about 92% of the physical structure of this city.

Nagasaki: 60,000 dead or seriously injured.  One third of the cty destroyed,
about five square kilometers.

These people were incinerated in fireballs very much like those that
incinerated the 5,000 to 7,000 in NYC and the Pentagon.  In comparison, how
many city blocks does 'ground zero' make up?

My point?  Do you really think that my point is to equate the lives of some
200,000 Japanese with the lives of some 5,000-7,000 so-called Americans [see
Bowering's objections to this terrm], thus reducing the value of the Japanese
lives over against those American ones?  Not at all my intention, not at all.

How does one measure degrees of incineration?  No, It was the same utterly
unspeakable experience for each and every one of these sad, poor, victims,
[each one of them like you or me in every way] ,as it is also for every
single Afghani victim., BTW.

Look, go ahead.  Incinerate the Taliban and the Al-Qaeda network, and Bin
Laden, if in fact they are responsible for these atrocities.  My Buddhist
compassion cannot save them at this point, anyway, as I damn well know.

But I see no good reason for incinerating Afghanis -- children, women, old
men, even young macho men -- who had absolutely nothing at all to do with
these monstrous actions.  And I see no good reason for turning this into an
utterly hopeless war between Islam and the Christian West., which is what all
of this will turn out to be.  Because everybody, I MEAN EVERYBODY, including
those of us who are neither Christian or Muslim or Jew, will lose out in the
end.

And David Antin professes to be tired of the likes of me.

Well, I truly hope to grow so old and so tired some day.  Maybe the young
then will put up with me, as we should put up with him.

George Thompson

David. I agree with this. Difficulty, complexity, subtlety, intelligence,
even seeming "heartlessness" and love of language, its complexities and
nuances such as you and Marjories Perloff (she supported) and others like
Charles Bernstein and hundreds of other poets initiated in the
L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E movment are essential. Holman would be one of these "street
poets" who think that an engineer should never study any maths - my only
support of his ilk might be my veiled crit. of David Antin (but that is
separate from my fascination with Antin's works: we need his "talk poems"
and any thing else he can do) (his views on the S11 situation but courage to
him for expressing those views) but let this also be said: many people who
have or are practising and writing beautiful AND difficult OR simple - if
you like - poetry as is relevant to their practice, have also worked
(literally) a low paid jobs and even if not cannot be accused of not being
in "the real world" ...I was greatly impressed by Robert Creeley when he
came here as a man and as a poet and a raconteur and his wide experience of
the world poets and people ...(my jibe against "accos" was maybe a bit
unfair there...but I was "making a point" as they say).  Give me complexity
and obscurity (which often generates "beauty" ) before dull and often
misleading transparancy. Charles Bernstein puts it well in his discussion of
the degrees of artifice and the degrees of resistance and absorbtion. I can
be as "consoled" or as "engaged" into enthusiasm by any style of a poem from
Keats to anything in "In The American Tree"...as to complexity my old mother
(who was a very gentle and compassionate being who would be very angry with
some of the crazy things I have been saying on this list and so she
should)(who also loved crime novels but read about 8000 novels of a very
wide range of styles into her late seventies, in her "hobby" which she
recorded - I mean she recorded about that many titles in a book in
alphabetical order) read a novel by Paul Auster (which I havent even read),
"Hunger" by Knut Hamsen (discussed by Paul Auster in his book "introduced"
to me through Scott Hamilton's essay in a Salt issue  (the Auckland Salt)),
Umberto Eco, and some other  "difficult" "postmodernist" or "challenging"
writers such as Camus's "The Outsider", "A Hundred Years of Solitude",
Calvino (I'm sure she would have had a go at Perec as she loved puzzles )
and others - although she read little poetry and and no interest in poetics
as such. A local organiser of "street poetry" and so on is keen on Language
poetry as well as he is promoting the "telll it from the hip stuff"   ... so
Holman is the more (if this is a clear picture of his thinking) restricted
or less catholic than those he or others more of his stamp who would call
for, you've heard it before: "Poems from the heart." Sincerity, integrity,
and thought and maybe even craft(!) yes:  but save me the ubiquitous and
hammering heart: to the degree that a poem is heartless it is
intelligent...which intelligence modifies and enlightens and enhances the
emotional force that energises the poem of whatever "school" or style. We
cant abandon complex thought or a language innovation and play because of a
war on an abstract noun! Why not forbid peole making jokes or children from:
"playing stick-boats in Winter's gutter"  ? Alan Curnow may have
"diseapeeared in the middle of winter (war?)" but we as (other) poets must
write on - good or bad however you define... That is the least that we can
do: and we cant be restricted in style or content by anyone.Our politics and
poetics and thinking must be rich and various and compassionate and
uncompassionate and irritating and absurd and dark and complex and simple
and crazy and rational and elliptical and fantastic and cool and multiplex
in meanings and evocations and connotations....when so prescribed but never
proscribed. NO RESTRICTIONS.
The poet must say: "I make the world, for the world makes me."

Aaron. I'm not neccessrily opposed to individual genius. But I was "spear
thrusting" I just have a sense that certain academics are "in a vacuum" but
see my post to in reply to  David Bromige...I agree with much you say.
  Look: if we are to fear legal action then we are all "knackered". We fear
any reprisal and we then cannot fight or struggle against wrongs. Look: as
to finance I owe money: years ago someone (some Insurance company tried to
get cash off me but I simply wrote them a letter explaining that I had no
money in the bank!)  Imagine the political victory: "Fifty Three Year Old
Man in Auckland who is a Sickness Beneficiary and Who's Son's Eye was
Smashed Out by the New Zealand Police and Who was Battened in the Face and
Nearly Killed (Possibly by the Notoriously Vicious Red Squad who it is Well
Known Also Nearly Killed "The Clowns") in 1981 in Protests Against the
Springbok Tour (from South Africa) and Who Lives Alone with a Cat in a
Broken Down Old State House on about NZ$150.00 per week Income Taken to
Court by Bush Administration for Taunting and Expressing Unusual or
Unsettling and Subversive and Dangerous Ideas : New Zealand's "safe" and
"green clean image" Under Attack.Terrorism Spreads to "Quiet" Old New
Zealand"...I rest my case for now: but I am interested in your other points:
I'm not anti academics, just like to keep peole on their toes: i like David
Antin's work and his "talk Poems"...but see my response to David Bromige.
  Regards, Richard.

David. You make one common error here: the assumption that the world is
overcrowded. This is a common myth that is perpetuated because like eg any
other assumption we "take for granted" it is repeated over and over.  The
assumption behind this statement is that the world's problems have a
relation ( more or less directly) to the total number of people on the
planet. In either a functioning Capitalist or let's suppose some more
advanced system that is more efficient in economic terms: there is
always,always has been, a surplus of production. In fact the major
capitalist nations dump millions of tons of surplus product to maintian
price levels. I have no problem with that except that it "should" or those
products could be used to assist the less advantageous; but the economic
problems under present capitalism are complex so I wont go down that
path....but if you look at eg population density around the world it is fact
that the nations - in the main - that are the most densely populated are the
most prosperous. However that doesnt mean that increasing that density
automatically increases produtivity or prosperity. But the point is that it
is a fact that there can be too few people: and such places as the Sudan and
other sparsely populated areas are or can be very poor. The well being of
the earth is a function not of its total population (at this stage ) but in
fact of the way in which labour and technology are organised. In India one
cause of massive poverty was the fact that farms were (and maybe still are)
divided into relatively small and inefficient economic units. Another factor
there is that, like some of the Western antions, India has/had a large
number of landlords and very rich people who are exploitative of farmers:in
addition certain places wee and maybe still are empploying workers on such
low wages that they begin to starve for lack of cash in the midst of what is
quite a prosperous place (potentially) - as they did in England and  other
countries at various times in history - other things such as the enormous
cost of the British army in that country, the disruption of what for
hundreds (maybe thousands ) of years the East including India had a very
efficient and productive system of canals and trade routes and irrigation
which has fallen into disuse: China, while not being vastly rich, has LESS
economic hardships for the average individual. As to China : if you study
the areas and the corresponding areas of land that is productive the same or
equivalant area of Europe and part of Western Russia is probably as heavily
and densely populated as China. In fact for China to advance it is not
neccessarily a good thing to reduce her total population. What is done there
is that less assistance is given to families with more than one or two
children: no one is actually imprisoned or is there any drastic action
against people who have larger families.
   The question that should be asked: what is too many? How is that
computed? The answer is that there is neither too many people or too few.
Some people feel better about wars and car accidents because they are
obsessed that the world is "horribly overpopulated" ... but that idea has
been around for about 50 years. There may be an optimum number: but what is
that? People have fewer children in more prosperous countries fewer die and
people live longer but the fact is that the productive power of modern
industrial and farming methods and the earth's resources are so great that
it is not a problem "to feed more hungry mouths" ...the problems to be
worked on are political, hence organisational,hence cooperatrional, and
sociological and so on. As to resources it is known that Siberia (for eg.)
has billions of tons of oil 'locked" (for now) under the ice...its only a
matter of time before that will be used.
   The problems or difficulties include some local high density of
populaton - although that is mostly insignificant - religious fanaticism of
various kinds, economic inequalities, mis-organisation and allocation of
resources, ignorance, language and cultural differences, warmongering and on
and on...not overpopulation: that is a myth.
 All that aside, I  found this post by you very interesting. Regards,
Richard.

Elizabeth etal. Of course it is: what do I know? My daughters dont listen to
their silly old dad and my ex wife never listened when she WAS my wife. What
do I know about the world or women? I get instructions from my daughter (the
23 year old baby) who is even less tolerant than you of this old fat misery
gut's ramblings!!! But of course...here I go again...the Northern lot are
not very friendly to the idea of women being free etc.....
  Look: one of the things that terribly saddens me is that when my mother
was 80 she was in tears to a social helper about something in her life: she
had come from England and boarded in a schol in Melbourne (Australia) where
she played the piano and went  to church (even though she didnt believe in
anything per se) just to be able to play the church organ.  Then when she
came to leave school my grandfather, (who wasnt really a bad man but
probably thought he was "saving her"), refused to assist her into a music
school: her love and passion was the piano and I remember her playing and us
children listening and then sometimes all of us singing at the piano before
the curse of televison....somewhat it was her "programming" that prevented
her from rebelling per se (and I know that my own daughters never took any
notice of my "instructions" if I gave any....I'm no King Lear, you see...as
to the Big Bad Him Taleban: God knows, the world's crazy...what do I know?
We need love and compassion. Regards, Richard.

The Story of the Rays


There are many kinds of Rays in the world. It is Rays from our eyes that
give us the gift of sight. Without the Rays, we could never see anything!
The Rays are heated by the sun and make everything visible. That is why
you can see things when the sun is out, because the Rays are hotter then.
Rays from our ears go in search of things to hear. When they find these
things, they touch them softly and the things will say things to the Rays
that will take them into the ears. These Rays are different from the Rays
from our eyes because these Rays go back and forth with sound. It's "how
we hear." There are Rays from our nose that are like straws or open
canals, no one knows. These bring chemicals into our nose and guide our
sneezing. They go searching everywhere for chemicals. When they find them
they bring them into our nose. There are Rays for every pore in our skin
and these are amazing because they are shaped like tiny cones and they
look for things to touch and when they find them they will take them back
into the touching-area of the skin. All of these Rays are going back and
forth all the time. There are Rays from our vaginas and penises that take
chemicals and look for Rays coming from our noses and when they find them,
they send the chemicals into the nose Rays, which are sometimes like open
canals, and gravity keeps the chemicals in place as they rise to the nose.
There are Rays we find "troubling" from our anuses which come from a very
old time more than a hundred years ago when said where our farm was by the
smells we left on fenceposts and wagonwheels, and these Rays would go into
the nose through the nose Rays that were like straws and kept the smell so
some could say if they could speak back then and they couldn't, that yes,
this was where someone was growing corn and sheep. But the most important
Rays are those from our mind which go out in search of God and bring Him
back to us, and God smiles on these Rays which are everywhere, if we only
know how to look with the Rays from our eyes and the Rays from our ears.
For the Rays from our mind are always in search of higher truth, if we
only know how to understand them. We shall look within ourselves to know
so many things, if we will only be quiet and listen to the Rays from our
mind. These are indeed "The Story of the Rays."

Hi there,

Why this would come to someone living on an island in the North Atlantic
is anyone's guess. Maybe the local writers alliance listserve that this
is from is on some sort of island exchange list.

It may be of interest though.

Cheers,

"Calvin Hernton, a scholar, critic and poet whose work explored the terrain
where American race relations collide with American sexual politics, died
October 1 at his home in Oberlin, Ohio. He was 69." That's the first
sentence from an obit in the NYTimes, by Margalit Fox. Maybe someone with
the technology could post the whole thing--I think it was in Wed. Oct. 10.
When Calvin & the Umbra writers would read at the Deux Megots in the early
60s it was a revelation.  Sylvester

Small Press Traffic presents

Paula Gunn Allen & Stephanie Williams, reading
Friday, October 19, 2001 at 7:30 p.m.
Timken Lecture Hall, CCAC-SF

  One of the foremost scholars of Native American literature, Paula Gunn
Allen's many books include the novel The Woman Who Owned the Shadows, the
landmark critical work The Sacred Hoop: Recovering the Feminine in American
Indian Traditions, and a new collection of essays, Off the Reservation. This
year she has been honored
with a Lifetime Achievement Award from the Native Writer’s Association for
her groundbreaking work. Her latest book is Hozho: Walking in Beauty, an
anthology of historical and contemporary stories by Native authors which she
coedited. Originally from New Mexico, Allen has lived in California for many
years and is Professor Emerita of English at UCLA.

Poet and prose writer Stephanie Williams lives and works in New Orleans,
Louisiana; her first collection is due out this year. Her writing is one of
constantly mobile portraiture which illuminates and reanimates familiar
narratives by inventing new versions. From "Drunkard’s Promise": "Won’t you
tell me your name?/The resolution happens every verse/and it’s not/sun
setting down/on western newborn town/there’s nothing going on/to choose."
Williams has done critical work on Zydeco music as an American poesy; she
studied at Naropa and was the featured author in Mungo vs. Ranger #1.

Truth Has Been Suspended.  Indefinitely.

This poem may reach the border of the unintelligible
a black whole of what is beyond all
sense and reason.

In the deepest circle of hell
there is an ice.

An ice so dense and cold that
one million tonnes of jet fuel
couldn't catch a flame.

An ice field of treachery
the traitorous gnawing on each others' heads.

And when we had left him in that icy bed
    I saw two frozen together in one hole
   So that the one head capped the other head

And as starved men tear the bread this tore the poll
   Of the one beneath, chewing with ravenous jaws
   where the brain meets marrow, just beneath the skull

That lake of ice has become
the slick t.v. screen
we skate and surf and click
to try and leave our traces.

Television light bombards us.
Smarmy talking heads incite riots.
Swarthy citizens take cover as
dark skin means dark past.

Some people have turned
the melting pot
on high.
The bottom will burn while the top
will bubble. An evil effervescence.


Foaming it will seep out to singe
the elements.
You will notice the smell first.
Then, a cloud of unknowing.

As both poets and pilgrims
our paths have been changed.
Altered, delayed and re-routed.

Even I am wondering about the fist in pacifist.
Re-thinking my pilot plan.
Just what does universal human suffrage mean any more?

"Nuke the sand niggers" is one response.
Whether over there (where ever there is),
or down the street where
your gas is pumped and news of the day
is purchased.

I'll have a Mars bar today
to take me away from this planet where
ice burns like the Infernal epicenter.
But Mars is the god of war.

Ground Zero. Common Ground. Zero Common Ground.

Zero Intelligence. Channel 21 reminds me – yes, zero intelligence.

So what?

I zip through security at Pearson Airport with
a Fruitopia and a frantic "can't miss my plane again" urgency.

My bottle could have contained:
whiskey: a certain fuel for air rage
Some kind of acid: for a pilot's eyes
Citrus Consciousness: a Coca Cola concocted cocktail for mass consumption
smuggled under the rhetoric of  "let's all get along"ness.
Or even my own piss.

The amber clarity of one hundred ales
will not elucidate my emotions.

I live and walk in this world
and while every synaptic blip
in my brain disagrees with
the horrors of American foreign policy
I still ache.

I offer every acre of my soul
to the family and friends
to the constellations of sorrow
for the messages left on answering machines
for the man whose only hope now is that his unaccounted for daughter
has been hit on the head with concrete and is wandering around
not knowing where she is.

I wonder if the blood lust will mellow
I wander the streets and find a fellow traveler
wanting to hurl a National Post box into our shitstream harbour.

I want to scream.
I want to sleep.

I want to write a poem of redemption.
But it's too early to tell.

Potes & Poets Press is proud to offer the following newly released books as
part of our continuing effort to bring publications into print that stretch
the boundaries of language and literature.

        Frosted by Jack Kimball--74p/ 11.95

Frosted, writes Eileen Myles, “pushes the reader to fill in the dots. It's
angled poetry, full of unwilling tears, abruptness.” Frosted is radiant with
musical voices. “It's a very cool truth, a slow nostalgic ellipse…” as
Eileen Myles elaborates. Tony Towle notes “mysterious ironies and
enjambments, lines that are stunningly odd, and various kinds of oblique
narrative that may owe something to 'language' influences, but are often
also resonant of Jimmy Schuyler as well--while a good deal of
humor--recherché, direct and occasionally zany--glints through it all.” An
all round lovely and fresh performance.

        Podiums, Autobiographical Café Fictions, by Peter Ganick--328p / $14.95

A grand, intense tour-de-force from a prolific iconoclast of the poetry
wars. “Ganick's podiums are not bully pulpits. Rather, they function as
platforms for bop prosody torqued into Cecil Taylor's pianistic runs. As
anti-diaries, they insist on being music instead of musings.”--Tina Darragh.
“With dazzling amplitude Peter Ganick's writing spirals from high energy's
direction until life speaks the instant as meditation. Here then, everything
finds its way to the PODIUMS.”--Mary Rising Higgins. Written in a dense,
streaming prose, Podiums is a meditation both secular and divine. It is
writing to carry with you. Cover art developed from a painting by the author

        Conference by Stacy Doris--96p / $12.95

A comprehensively stunning book. Novel, play or poem, this landmark work
jumps vividly to life with quirky invention, concentrated integrity and
charming humor. Conference also teems with lyric passages: “Once there's an
opening, there's absence. Departure. Open your mouth: you could walk
through. The sky's an illusion and I'm perhaps legion. Yes or no. An opening
is the nick of time, maybe, and clouds' job is to stave that off, in a huge
collaboration with illusion. The sky is illusion: that's evident: agreed.
This blinding is beauty's definition perhaps, and its reasons too.” The
wildly improbable cover art (Audubon on mescaline?) is almost worth the
price on its own.

I have just received the very sad news of the sudden death of Nicholas
Zurburgg, from his student and friend at DeMontfort University, Nagy Rashwan.

>
> Dear Charles:
>
> It is my sad duty to inform you that Nicholas
> Zurbrugg suffered a massive stroke and passed away

>
> Thank you very much,
>
> Nagy.




Nicholas Zurbrugg was the Director of Centre for Contemporary Arts and the
editor and author of many books on performance art, multimedia, Beckett,
Burroughs, Baudtrillard, sound poetry, electronic arts. For a long while he
taught in Australia, where he edited Stereo Headphones.

For more information, you can start at his university home page

http://www.dmu.ac.uk/Faculties/HSS/English/Staff/zurbrugg.html

I expect we will have more on Nick on this and other lists, from his many
friends in the UK, US, Canada, and Australia. He was an exubertant man, and
enthusiast for the art that he dedicated his life to supporting. He will be
missed.

As a suddenly Pennsylvani'd Californian, I took particular joy in this
morning's NY TIMES piece on the restoration of the Watts Towers --

this is my favorite paragraph (TAKE NOTE ALL RONALD JOHNSON READERS!):

"Portions of a documentary on Rodia-- an Italian immigrant who spoke broken
English that seemed inspired at times by the denser verses of Ezra Pound
and at others by Abbot and Costello--were played at the opening ceremony,
and they were most helpful, in a sense."

The Germ & the Poetic Research Bureau

present

Philippe Beck and Guy Bennett

at Dawsons Book Shop, Sunday October 21 @ 4pm!

***

Those who missed Jacques Darras' reading last Sunday at Dawsons missed =
some
truly transporting theatre. Breathy sweeping apologia for the song and
Schwitters soundspeak that made the chairs creak by dint of the force
majeure of an ur-speech not merely modern, to be sure. Though the day =
is not
done, audience and candidates! This weekend, the French gale sweeps =
back. Or
sweeps Beck?

If I can recommend one French poet working today that you may have =
never
heard of but should hear forthwith yes immediately, it is Philippe =
Beck. A
poet of bright philosophic vectors and incalculable hallucinogenic =
detail. A
poetry of elaborate statement and formal derangement, mad only in the =
scale
of its endeavor. Beck could not be predicted in France, but he is with =
us
this Sunday, I guarantee it, and only the most timid among us will miss =
him!

Appearing with Beck is LA's pre-eminent tongue-twisting juggernaut, =
poet and
translator Guy Bennett. Agent, acrobat, key-bearer...how to explain a =
man
who has submitted Sergei Paradjanov, Hans Bellmer and Michel Leiris to =
the
Procrustean bed of translation, yet still finds time to write three
collections of his own? Not to mention photographing all the bridges in
Paris, designing countless Sun & Moon books and dropping bass trax onto =
how
many postpunk LA garage jazz recordings? Whoa!

Remeber the titans, this Sunday!

***

Philippe Beck is a poet, essayist and professor of philosophy from =
Nantes,
France. He is also arguably the most debated, talked about, cursed and
celebrated poet currently operating on the French scene. In a short six
years, he has published over ten books of poetry and philosophy, and
launched two major literary journals. His recent works include Inciseiv
(MeMo, Nantes, 2000), Derni=E8re mode familale, post-face by Jean-Luc =
Nancy
(Flammarion, 2000), Rude merveilleux (Al Dante, Marseille, 1998), and
Po=E9sies didactiques (Th=E9=E2tre Typographique, Courbevoie, November =
2001). His
first collection in English arrives at the end of this year from PRB =
Folios.
This is his first visit to the west coast.

Guy Bennett is a poet and translator. He has been published in =
magazines and
anthologies in the US, France, Brazil and Italy. Recent work has =
appeared in
"La Polygraphe," "Sibila," "108," and "L'Anthologie 2000." Recent
translations include Michel Leiris' Operratics, 2001, and Mostafa
Nissabouri's Approach to the Desert Space, 2001. He is the author of =
Last
Words, 1998, The Row, 2000, and 100 Famous Views, 2001.

I'm not tired of you George: but have a look at my reference to the book "
The making of the Atomic Bomb" (Pulitzer) by Richard Rhodes: fascinating
book.  It was a different situation. Look no country's hands are clean: we
all need to work on our heads. Antin is a very interesting and innovative
poet and thinker: but he's buying into a lot of the right wing crap:
incomparison the attack on the US was small bikkies: terrorism, or guerilla
warfare, or whatever you call it is now seen - and will rightly and
righteously continue  - to be very effective against repressive and
complacent regimes with immense power and military might and who attack and
bully other (usually immensly impoverished)  nations. The actions of Bush
will increrase terrorism  in the long run: Blair seems to be attempting to
help the situation in Palestine but Sharon is not helping. I think Blair, on
those occasions when he "climbs down a bit", has a few clues. Maybe the
world will see that the deep causes that motivate anger and retaliation are
now needing to be analysed and addressed. Dont buy into Antin's
panic..unless he's an agent of the right wing...who knows?  Richard.

Flesh and Bone
Stories
Cydney Chadwick

(winning manuscript of the 1998 New American Fiction Series Competition,
selected by Douglas Messerli)

In an earlier era, these mesmerizing vignettes might have been termed
"character studies," although that same era might have banned them for
their subversive and off-beat fixations.  "Character," in Chadwick's
writing, usually reveals itself through the filter of simple actions
(sneaking into a church, returning to a childhood home) or the filter of
objects (an eyelash trapped under a contact lens, an inferior lithograph
given as a gift). However, these filters never entirely obscure another
character, Chadwick's narrator, who slowly reveals her iconoclastic =
views
on art, politics, sex and the after-effects of 60's California culture.
Fully cognizant of Bataille, Beckett, and the French "New Novel," these
contemporary fables put "character" in quotation marks while continuing, =
by
a sidelong movement, to unveil it.

TO: Ms. Amber Dorko Stopper
    Founder, Tarot Special Interest Group of American
Mensa
    Editor, nightrally.org

Dear Amber,

I have urgent concerns about the suppression of truth
in New York City.

On Sunday, September 16th, I was coming back from a
visit to Jersey (for the twins' 40th birthday party),
and, time on my hands, curious to be in Times Square
(near Port Authority Bus Station, whence I was
returning) with the crowds so thinned by the tourist
exodus, I moseyed about.

There, at curbside, was a Tarot reader set up at one
of those small, foldable metal tables suburbanites use
for setting up small household parties in converted
"rec room" basements,--- and her client.  I stood to
watch.  The cards talready spread out on the table
seemed odd: The World, the four of Wands (or whichever
shows that chuppah wedding canopy),  The Lovers, etc.
. . .  There was something about so many pastelle hues
that seemed an unfamiliar chromatics, Rider deck.

HER TECHNIQUE FOR TURNING OVER THE CARDS:

She had a curious way of drawing her cards.  The table
(and now it begins, dream-like, to seem not a 'burbs
party foldable at all) had two little compartments,
and she kept half a deck in each, switching from one
to the other.  She would turn over a single card and
hold it in her hand, and she and the client would lean
over the card while the reader interpreted it.  She
sort of cupped her hand around the card, though, as if
concealingit, and was either whispering or straining
to be heard above the din of diminished traffic.

DIALOGUE:

And then she turned to me:

"I'm sorry," the psychic said.  "But she" (the client)
"would like us to be left alone."

By now I'd figured it out the omission.

"Where are the ~Swords!?"~  I asked, forcefully, in
what the composer Ralph Buxton (publisher of Notre
Dame Choir Editions, known for his reconstruction of
an incomplete six-part Robert Parsons polyphony) has
described as my "ominous tone."

"What have you done with the Swords?!"  And I said to
the client:  "She's hidden a quarter of the deck!"

She should pay only 75% of the fee.  (Or 75%, less the
fraction for the ratio of Major Arcana.)

The signifiers for all sorrows, care, misfortune,
friction, challenges, unpleasantness, had been taken
out of that deck, Amb'!  Certainly no Tower, either,
nor Death, to be sure.

-------------------------------------------------------

I walked on.  There was sightseeing to be enjoyed.
The hustler in the classical disco ball tinsel
proscenium male strip tease burlesque a few blocks
uptown perplexed with his own curious politicality.
An "Osama - Public Enemy # 1" shirt had already hit
the Times Square street vendors' wares.  This
particular "boy" appeared, pro forma, for the opening,
strip tease portion of his performance, still dressed
in the trousseau of "straight-acting" street clothes
they somehow select for themselves: Timberland boots,
jeans, belt, gradually revealed CKs, whatever, . . .
But, here's the shocker: he had on one of the "Osama -
Public . . ." t-shirts!  Anaphrodisiacal.   The mainly
silver-haired clientele all but gasped.  They (we,
salt-'n'-pepper myself) must have at least undergone a
simultaneous, collective inhalation that could
unanimously be sensed, heard at some low decibel
frequency not drowned out by the piped-in dance music,
each dancer choosing his own recorded accompaniment
(Am I correct that I've heard a House Music-ized
version of Pachelbel's Canon?).  Perhaps, of course,
some panache of his good looks caused coincidental
inhalation. --- Fortunately, the strictures of his
terpsichore genre quickly shed the "# 1" shirt, and
the second half of the expressionistic choreography,
whew, is always reserved for the "boy's" reappearance,
fully naked.

-------------------------------------------------------

I thought this especially important to report about
the missing Swords, Dork', because of something I'd
recently read.

Rick, "Aries Marine Bull-Pussy," in Zeeland, Steven,
~Military Trade~ (NY: Harrington Park Press/The
Haworth Press, Inc., 1999), p. 170, generously blurbed
by queer theorist (and writer on Proust, Carravagio)
Leo Bersani:

"Soldiers prefer rough, dirty stuff like . . . canvas
wrestling.  Sailors like slick things such as
body-hugging nylon/lycra clothes . . . Airmen want
everything suburban middle-class clean and bland . . .
Marines are drawn to stretchy, sweaty, tightly
enfolding things like leather and rubber. . . .
Another odd note: In the symbology of the tarot deck,
Swords (Air) are Air Force, Wands (Fire) are Marine
Corps, Cups (Water) are Navy, and Pentacles (Earth)
are Army, and each of the major Arcana has a military
form."

-------------------------------------------------------

But, God in God's infinite plenitude, even while
information (truth)  may be withheld on one front, it
springs up elsewhere, like wildflowers.  Recently
received a mailed, postcard-type announcement from
Teachers & Writers about their Adventures in Poetry
unveiling, just past (I can't find the announcement at
the moment, a pretty electric green color, a
scarab-like cockroach silhouette perhaps a logo from
that mimeograph era, early New York School AIP's
design, . . . so I can't quote it verbatim).  But at
the bottom, the card read: "Epoisses cheese will be
served."  Usually, gourmands, most poetry
announcements do not specify their grade of cheeses.

(Epoisses: 4 - 5 inches in dimeter, reddish orange
skin, gooey, from an affinement in Marc de Bourgogne,
invented by 16th century Cistercian monks.)

Luv,

JJ

P.S.  While I was buying the twins their presents, I
bought myself: Allen, Robert and Josephine Fulton,
~Mensa Presents MIGHTY BRAIN TEASERS~ (NY: Barnes &
Noble Books, 1999), filled with "Brain Twisters,"
"Headscratchers" ("Which is the odd one out?"), "Super
Sleuth," "Matchpoints," "Quick Wit," etc.  And ---
here's the thing, Stop': --- I'm not doin' all that
great!  Maybe you'd be available sometime to bus down
not that The City's so enjoyable spacious and gimme
Genius lessons sometimes, to bring me up to
Headscratchers calibre.

Hey Guys:

Just wanted to apologize for the last e-mail petition I sent out.  Got several e-mails from
friends wondering if it was legit and just got this info. from someone who checked it out:

Hi Wanda,

I hope you're well.  Thanks for sending this message.  I'm always a little
skeptical of these email petitions, though, so I went to www.unicwash.org to
see if there was any info. on it.  Here's their statement:

"We have received an overwhelming amount of emails as part of a petition --
generated by an unknown source -- urging the US and international community
to refrain from going to war.  While we were heartened by this effort, the
United Nations Secretariat (to which we are employed) is an implementing
organ for the actions and programs agreed upon and supported by its 189
Member States.

Therefore, if individuals really want their voices heard by these
decision-makers, they should contact their governments and mission to the UN
to express concerns and views."

The sentiment in the petition is right on but it's important that it get
communicated to the right people and not be lost in cyberspace.  Send the
same message to Hillary Clinton, Charles Schumer, and George Bush directly.

James

I was asked about depression bc and thought my answer might be useful to =
others who know people that might be depressed about what's happening -

"
there's no easy answer to that one.  it might help make it okay to seek =
help if they realize that depression to some degree is 'normal' at the =
moment?  sometimes if you can get them to talk about what's going on =
with them they'll start to realize by themselves - i find that often =
when someone comes in I might ask if they think they're 'depressed' and =
mention meds, they'll say 'no' but by the end of an hour they may have =
changed their minds.  another thintg you might try is to suggest they =
write a poem about how they feel - putting feelings on paper seems to =
have a powerful effect."

The New McCarthyism
Charges of anti-Americanism are themselves anti-American
By George Monbiot

Guardian 16 th October 2001

If satire died on the day Henry Kissinger received the Nobel Peace
Prize, then last week its corpse was exhumed for a kicking. As head of
the United Nations' peacekeeping department, Kofi Annan failed to
prevent the genocide in Rwanda or the massacre in Srebenica. Now, as
Secretary General, he appears to have intepreted the UN charter as
generously as possible to
allow the attack on Afghanistan to go ahead.

Article 51 permits states to defend themselves against attack. It says
nothing about subsequent retaliation. It offers no licence to attack
people who might be harbouring a nation's enemies. The bombing of
Afghanistan, which began before the UN security council gave its
approval, is legally contentious. Yet the man and the organisation who
overlooked this obstacle
to facilitate war are honoured for their contribution to peace.
Endowments like the Nobel Peace Prize are surely designed to reward
self-sacrifice. Nelson Mandela gave up his liberty, FW de Clerk gave up
his power, and both were worthy recipients of the prize. But Kofi Annan,
the career bureaucrat, has given up nothing. He has been rewarded for
doing as he is told, while nobly submitting to a gigantic salary and
bottomless expense account.

Among the other nominees for the prize was a group whose qualifications
were rather more robust. Members of Women in Black have routinely risked
their lives in the hope of preventing war. They have stayed in the homes
of Palestinians being shelled by Israeli tanks and have confronted war
criminals in the Balkans. They have stood silently while being abused
and spat at during vigils all over the world. But now, in this looking
glass world in which war is peace and peace is war, instead of winning
the peace prize the Women in Black have been labelled potential
terrorists by the FBI and threatened with a grand jury investigation.

They are in good company. Earlier this year the director of the FBI
named the chaotic but harmless organisations Reclaim the Streets and
Carnival Against Capitalism in the statement on terrorism he presented
to the Senate. Now, partly as a result of his representations, the
senate's new terrorism bill, like Britain's Terrorism Act 2000,
redefines the crime so broadly that members of Greenpeace are in danger
of being treated like members of Al-Qaeda. The Bush doctrine -- if
you're not with us, you're against us -- is already being applied.

This government by syllogism makes no sense at all. Osama Bin Laden and
Al-Qaeda have challenged the US government; ergo anyone who challenges
the government is a potential terrorist. That Bin Laden is, according to
US officials, a "fascist", while the other groups are progressives is
irrelevant: every public hand raised in objection will from now on be
treated as a public hand raised in attack. Given that OBL is not a
progressive but is a millionaire, it would surely make more sense to
round up and interrogate all millionaires.

Lumping Women in Black together with Al-Qaeda requires just a minor
addition to the vocabulary: they have been jointly classified as
"anti-American". This term, as used by everyone from Donald Rumsfeld and
the Daily Mail to Tony Blair and several contributers to the Guardian,
applies not only to those who hate Americans, but also to those who have

challenged US foreign and defence objectives. Implicit in this
denunciation is a demand for uncritical support, for a love of
government more consonant with the codes of Tsarist Russia than with the
ideals upon which the United States were founded.

The charge of "anti-Americanism" is itself profoundly anti-American. If
the United States does not stand for freedom of thought and speech, for
diversity and dissent, then we have been deceived as to the nature of
the national project. Were the founding fathers to congregate today
to discuss the principles enshrined in their declaration of
independence, they would be denounced as "anti-American" and
investigated as potential terrorists. Anti-American means today
precisely what un-American meant in the 1950s. It is an instrument of
dismissal, a means of excluding your critics from rational discourse.

Under the new McCarthyism, this dismissal extends to anyone who seeks to
promulgate a version of events other than that sanctioned by the US
government. On September 20, President Bush told us that "this is the
fight of all who believe in progress and pluralism, tolerance and
freedom." Two weeks later, Colin Powell met the emir of Qatar, to
request that progress, pluralism, tolerance and freedom be suppressed.
Al-Jazeera is one of the few independent television stations in the
Middle East, whose popularity is the result of its uncommon regard for
freedom of speech. It is also the only station permitted to operate
freely in Kabul: many of the images of the bombing of Afghanistan we've
seen on TV were recorded by its cameramen. Powell's request that it be
squashed was a pre-emptive strike against freedom, which, he hoped,
would prevent the world from seeing what was really happening once the
bombing began.

Since then, both George Bush and Tony Blair have sought to prevent
Al-Jazeera from airing video statements by Bin Laden, on the grounds of
the preposterous schoolboy intrigue that they "might contain coded
messages". Over the weekend the government sought to persuade British
broadcasters to restrict their coverage of the war. Blair's spin doctors
warned "You can't trust them [the Taliban] in any way, shape, or form."
While true, this applies with equal force to the techniques employed by
Downing Street. When Alastair Campbell starts briefing journalists about
"Spin Laden", it's a case of the tarantula spinning against the money
spider.

If we are to preserve the progress, pluralism, tolerance and freedom
which President Bush claims to be defending, then we must question
everything we see and hear. Though we know that governments lie to us in
wartime, most people seem to believe that this universal rule applies to
every conflict except the current one. Many of those who now accept that
babies were not thrown out of incubators in Kuwait, and that the
Belgrano was fleeing when she was hit, are also prepared to believe
everything we are being told about Afghanistan and the terrorism in the
United States.

There are plenty of reasons to be skeptical. The magical appearance of
the terrorists' luggage, passports and flight manual looks rather too
good to be true. The dossier of "evidence" purporting to establish Bin
Laden's guilt consists largely of supposition and conjecture. The
ration packs being dropped on Afghanistan have no conceivable purpose
other than to create the false impression that starving people are being
fed. Even the anthrax scare looks suspiciously convenient. Just as the
hawks in Washington were losing the public argument about extending the
war to other countries, journalists start receiving envelopes full of
bacteria, which might as well have been labeled "a gift from Iraq". This
could indeed be the work of terrorists, who may have their own reasons
for widening the conflict, but there are plenty of other ruthless
operators who would benefit from a shift in public opinion.

Democracy is sustained not by public trust but by public skepticism.
Unless we are prepared to question, to expose, to challenge and to
dissent, we conspire in the demise of the system for which our
governments are supposed to be fighting. The true defenders of America
are those who are now being told that they are anti-American.

FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION READING:
ONE HUNDRED DAYS

FRIDAY, OCTOBER 26, 7:30 PM FREE

The Walt Whitman Cultural Arts Center is pleased to present several authors
whose work appeared in the 100 Days Anthology, a literary journal created
in response to the first one hundred days of the Bush presidency.

In light of current events, the reading's focus has been expanded to include
freedom of speech and expression, among other topics of importance that have
emerged since the September 11 attacks and its aftermath.

Featured authors include:

ANSELM BERRIGAN, PATRICK HERRON, JORDAN DAVIS,
ALICIA ASKENASE, ALISON COBB, and hassen

Anselm Berrigan is the author of Integrity and Dramatic Life, and the
forthcoming Zero Star Hotel (both from Edge Books). He is currently teaching
at Rutgers University in New Brunswick, and at The Poetry Project at St.
Mark's Church.

Jordan Davis was born in New York City. He is the author of over a dozen
chapbooks, most recently _Yeah, No_ (Detour), _A Winter Magazine
(Situations, forthcoming), and _From the Ground Up_ (Subpoetics Self-Publish
or Perish). He is a former director of Poetry City, and is an editor of The
Hat.

Allison Cobb is the author of Polar Bear and Desert Fox (BabySelf 2001),
the J Poems (BabySelf 2000), The Little Box Book (Situation 1999) and
co-author with Jennifer Coleman and CE Putnam of Communal Bebop Canto (50
Cents Off 1998).  Her first full-length collection, Born Two, is
forthcoming in 2003 from Chax.

hassen: lives in new jersey, recently had pieces published in *nedge* and
*skanky possum,* working on a novel.

Patrick Herron lives outside Chapel Hill, NC, US, where he works as a
computer programmer and interface designer. Patrick's digital and textual
works of poetry and visual art have appeared in places such as Rhizome.org,
README, Oasia Press, VeRT, Rhizomes, Can We Have Our Ball Back, and in the
recently released _100 Days: An Anthology_, a collection of poems on the
Bush presidency (Barque Press). Patrick has recently completed two volumes
of poetry (one is a conceptual work, and the other is a loose collection).
He is also now working on a poem-play loosely based upon Captain Ahab and
Oedipus and is helping his friend Lester prepare a soon-to-be-released new
web journal called _The Close Quarterly(http://proximate.org/CloseQuarterly/).

Alicia Askenase's poetry has appeared in several journals, including The
World, Synergism, Chain, The Journal of Modern Literature, Feminist Studies,
and most recently in Rooms. Her chapbook The Luxury of Pathos, was published
by Texture Press.  She is a founding co-editor of the Philadelphia-based
literary journal 6ix and literary program director at the Walt Whitman
Cultural Art Center.

------------------------------

<restlessculture.net/discourse> is an international network for critical
dialogue of issues that affect the global community.

*The focus & issues of the site will shift because it is a "user-driven",
collaborative media environment.*

In its conception this project is and will continue to be:

*a platform for creative, intellectual response and meditation.

*a "user-driven" alternative to the prescribed, sensational feeds of
accelerated mass media and governments which abandon thought in their haste
to implement the rhetoric of war for political, economic and/or religious
gain.

*a collective opposition to all forms of fundamentalism everywhere.

*a web-based initiative that questions patriotism, anti-Arabism, and all
forms of racism and indifference toward others in our precious and
increasingly inter-dependent global community.

*a collaborative media platform of informed responses to and careful
analysis of a world in crisis.

The University of Georgia English department, represented by Jed Rasula, would like to announce the next reader in the 2001 Lanier Reading Series, renowned author and editor Louis Menand.

On Monday, October 22, at 4:00, in 261 of Park Hall, Louis Menand will give a lecture, "Pragmatism and War".

Louis Menand is Distinguished Professor of English at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York. He is the author, most recently, of The Metaphysical Club. He has also written Discovering Modernism: T. S. Eliot and His Context, edited The Future of Academic Freedom and Pragmatism: A Reader, and co-edited America in Theory and volume seven of The Cambridge History of Literary Criticism. Professor Menand has been a Contributing Editor of The New York Review of Books since 1994, and has also served as Associate Editor of The New Republic, and Literary Editor of The New Yorker, where he is now a staff writer.

Louis Menand's The Metaphysical Club is brilliant, illuminating, necessary. --Joan Didion

There is no more elegant writer of American prose than Louis Menand. --Henry Louis Gates, Jr.

The Metaphysical Club is a brilliant reanimation of American pragmatism as it evolved from the writings of Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr., William James, Charles Sanders Peirce, and John Dewey and as it was shaped by the traumas of the Civil War and the immense social and economic changes that followed it. Menand has written the most nuanced account I've ever read of pragmatist thinking and he demonstrates, as no one so effectively has before, how public enterprise shaped its specifically American texture and tone. This is a richly populated, intellectually thrilling book in which America is shown to be discovering its future. --Richard Poirier

karen, thanks for posting these links to Poets for Peace and Dialogue
Through Poetry. i've no doubt that this is important work and may do much to
encourage humanitarian concern, etc. do you think poetry can considerably
effect timely political change? i'm doubtful, seems like we're preaching to
the few converted. i'm currently more interested in poets running for
office... (wry, but somewhat serious)...

hi tom & thanks for sending this. your article is really interesting (tho i
wish it elaborated). you'd probably be able to give me a  rough estimate -
what's the percentage of clinical therapists utilizing WM methods in poetry
(or art/music, unless language is necessary) & how/do you think it's an
essential tool for 9/11 trauma (nationally/globally/locally)?

hassen,
  I'm not sure how receptive the mainstream media is right now to any but
the most patriotic poetry.  I just had the attached article rejected by
ASAP.  Obviously it might have been because it was not 'crisp' enough, but
on the other hand it may have been hesitancy to print anything that was not
obviously establishment.

hi elizabeth~    thanks for taking the time/effort to reply. don't know what
to tell you beyond what you're doing. i also sign petitions. i write
succinct letters to legislators, news editors, whomever else appropriate.
yap abt. issues with anyone willing. can't wait for the jersey election nov
6. i've called radio talk shows, sent out email notices/info to family &
friends & recently put up a website for them (or anyone interested -
http://members.home.net/hhssn/facilitate.htm ) to access a few articles &
alternative news sources - as well as to facilitate action. beyond my few
close friends, most 'regular folks' i know are unaware of news or ideas
other than what's on network t.v.  i'm thinking most effective would be to
better inform the public of current events/issues/ideas & encourage their
participation? wish there would be a major movement to do this. but surely
others have thought of & implemented other solutions(?) that i've not heard
about yet. there must be organizations or individuals doing more than
petitions/protests. with all the concern for humanity, the intelligence,
ingenuity & agility, poetics people c/would substantially contribute to our
process. i'd like to know what's going on, y'know?

best of course,
    hassen


*hopefully i'll soon have a fun long-sleeved t w/flag graphic: "patriotism
is best demonstrated by our participation in the democratic process"
(tho i'd rather it be a psa or billboard(s)!)

Scott, I can't completely agree with your agreeing completely with Barrett.
How can you speak of "misuse" of language in this instance? Barrett's
sentence, in reply to the captions "Best analysis of left fundamentalism by
co-editor of Dissent" & "How the right exploits left fundamentalism," was
"This is a misuse of language, pure and simple." What could the normative
basis for appropriate use be here? These sentence-fragments from Ron
Silliman are not errors: misusages like "My apple is hungry" or "Can't I
haves my poems published yet so I'm eligible for government gwants?" or
"Stan Persky's Wrestling the Angel made me even nimbler in my jawlessness
than Karl Siegler's pulping of the remaining 423 copies of Dorothy Trujillo
Lusk's Redactive in 1995" that can be classified as misusages only against a
ground of some grammatical or lexical or some other kind of normalcy.
Turning "left fundamentalism" into a misusage doesn't let us get at the
ideological content, the term's materiality, its way of regulating
perception & bodies. I'd say that the problem could be treated by first
asking Ron why he uses the phrase. Ron?

Here's a blurb from Anselm Hollo's anti-laureate chapbook, (free with
Samizdat #8):

"Anselm Hollo was proclaimed United States Anti-Laureate after an
informal election held on SUNY-Buffalo's Poetics list in the summer of
2001.  The Anti-Laureateship is a protest against the banality of the
most recent Poets laureate, and a parody of the prize culture that
permeates the small world of American poetry.  BLAST the Laureate, and
BLESS the Anti-Laureate.  Long may he reign over us."
               --Robert Archambeau, October 2001

Read more about this in "6,810,000 Liters of Poetry per Second," the
lead-off editorial of Samizdat #8

(and yes, Barrett, I acknowledge your protest against my protest there!)

career milestone" [says Publishers Weekly] - $15.95 - don't miss this
one - beautiful cover image by Francie Shaw.


J. Hoberman's On Jack Smith's Flaming Creatures. $29.95. The
centerpiece of this book is a cache of recently discovered
photographs by Norman Solomon documenting and giving insight into the
making of this notorious masterpiece. J. Hoberman's work is sober,
lucid and enthusiastic - very important in beginning to mine the
cultural riches of this important figure and the scene he inhabited:
Lower East Side in the very early sixties. Stunning book design by
Heung-Heung Chin. Wildly illustrated throughout - some color plates.

Oct 30 - details to follow.]


Soliloquy by Kenneth Goldsmith. $17.95. In the tradition of Warhol's
A and David Antin's talk poems - Soliloquy ups the ante on real
speech as poetry. This is an unedited document of every word
Goldsmith spoke during a week in 1996. "Confronted with the matter of
'real' speech (not to mention its content, which might prove more
embarrassing than its stammers and mumbles), we realize that we all
sound a bit like George Bush." zingmagazine


[Voyeurs take note: Swoon by Nada Gordon and Gary Sullivan - a 300+
page excerpt from their legendary correspondence initiated here on

Hello listees.

I'm going to be offering a workshop on "revision" this November-December

through Portland's Independent Publishing Resource Center (and very
likely again next summer at Sitka Center for Art & Ecology on the
coast). It will be aimed primarily--though not exclusively--at writers,
working in any genre.

I would eagerly welcome any and all suggestions that anyone might have
for additional resources on the subject of revision (in any medium or
discipline). Texts that I might add to the bibliography that I'm
developing, or to the reserve reading shelf that I'm assembling (i.e.
essays, interviews, anthologies, pedagogical works, exemplifications,
etc.) ... as well as any anecdotes of your own, favorite quotations, or
techniques/exercises, that seem especially pertinent to
revision/editing/rewriting.

Backchannel responses to me at passages@inetarena.com very gratefully
appreciated.


Best regards,

hassen,
     the article is unelaborated as it was written for an academice
psyhology audience, but I am thinking of revising for a poetics, English,
etc. audience.  WM is actually a concept that combines analytical thinking
and cognitive psychological thinking but I think from my experience it is
actually something almost any therapist of whatever persuasion has 'in mind'
as they work with a client.  I see it as a useful way to think for any
person or group trying to deal in a useful way ('resolve' is the jargon we
use) with the traumas we are experiencing.  I'm not sure I'm being clear
here, and Nick might have something to add.

These are messages posted to psyart that I think add to several recent =

From:
        Marzall@aol.com

3:28 AM

In the years between 1400 and 1450 the new word 'terrible' sprang upon =
the
English language in its middle phase. From the Latin base 'to frighten' =
it
entered the language during an aptly frightening time. There was a =
sudden
clash of cultures from the Ottoman Empire, to city states in Italy, to =
the
first contact shocks of New World and Old World in the Americas. Of =
course,
the early decades of the 15th century softened into its later decades =
with
the beautiful renaissance of cultures enriched by their interweaving,
mingling, and renewing.

So many of the translations of the Hellenic philosophers came back to =
the
west by way of Arabic translations. The chaos of the times would shatter =
old
frames, only to see new figures and objects emerge...Hieronymus Bosch =
and his
softly bizarre worlds, Gutenburg's press, and the hammered gold mirages =
of
the Aztecs return from the sunset to awestruck Europeans.

And now, yes, the walls of our mutual fundamentalisms are falling with a
terrible shock. We lost as many and more of our dear countrypeople in =
one day
in early September as we did during the entire American Revolution.

But if we take, for the moment, Vico's idea that 'leading personalities =
are
merely born of their times' it's clear that a First President could have =
been
known by another great name, that Yeshua ben Yosef, Jesus, could have =
been
called by another savior's name, and that Mr. Bush (driven by his need =
to
match his father?) and Mr. bin Laden (born in 1957, 17th of 52 children =
in
his family, starved for attention and affection?) are leading characters =
in
our modern-day cast onstage who must push their symbolic, synonymic
fundamentalisms to extremes so that we might break the deeper molds and
mindsets born of our fearful and foolish isolations on this small, =
colorful
planet.

"Abdallah al-Yashkuri said: I went to Kufa to procure some mules, and I
entered the mosque where there was a man of Qais named Ibn al-Muntafiq =
who
was saying: Someone described to me the Apostle of Allah, and it was =
pleasing
to me, so I went to Mecca to find him, but they said that he was at =
Muna. So
I went to Muna to find him, but they said he was at Arafat. Finally, I =
found
him and approached him, getting so close that I could catch the bridle =
of his
mount - or perhaps he said: till I could catch hold of the neck-rein of =
his
mount - so that the necks of our two steeds crossed. I said: 'There are =
two
things about which I want to ask you. What will save me from Hell, and =
what
will assure me entrance to Paradise?' He looked up at the sky, then he =
turned
to face me, and said: 'Even though you have put the matter in short, you =
are
on to something that is immense and really needs a long answer. =
Nevertheless
take this from me: You should worship Allah, associating nothing with =
Him,
perform the prayers that have been prescribed, fast the month of =
Ramadan, act
with people the way you would like them to act with you, do not be =
averse to
folk coming to you but let the people do it, and let go the neck-rein of =
my
riding beast."

Dear subscribers to PsyArt,

I am surprised that no one has yet posted the following essay by Lloyd
deMause.  I don't know how many of you are familiar with his work.  He
is the editor of The Journal of Psychohistory (www.psychohistory.com).
He is educated in political science and psychoanalysis and the essay
below is a good example of his approach.  If what he says below is
essentially correct, then I regard his analysis as very illuminating.

deMause is a very controversial figure.  Some people think very highly
of his work, others view that work as extremely speculative.

The reason that I am submitting this essay to this list is that I really
would like to know what you all think of it.  I am too ignorant of how
children are rasied in fundamentalist families to have an opinion.  If
you think he oversimplfies or distorts in some way, I would like to hear
about that too.

I need your help. Even if you cannot evaluate this brief essay, do you
know someone who can?

Thanks,

raymond barglow

********************************************

THE CHILDHOOD ORIGINS OF TERRORISM

Lloyd deMause

In the massive media coverage of the terrorist attacks, there has
been no interest shown in why the terrorists felt they had to kill
Americans. They were "Evil," as the President told us, and that has
seemed to satisfy our curiosity as to their motives. But if we are
going to end this terrorism, it would be useful to understand what
makes a terrorist, what developmental life histories they share that
can help us see why they want to kill "American infidels" and
themselves, so we can work to remove the sources of their violence
and really prevent future terrorist attacks.
The roots of terrorism lie, I believe, not in this or that American
political attitude but in the extremely abusive families of the
terrorists. Children who grow up to be Islamic terrorists are
products of an extremely misogynist fundamentalist system that
strictly segregates the family into two separate areas, the men's
area, often on the first floor, and the women's area, above the men,
where the children are brought up and which the father rarely visits.
Even in countries like Saudi Arabia today, women by law cannot mix
with unrelated men, and public places still have separate women's
areas in restaurants and work places, because, as one Muslim
sociologist put it bluntly: "In our society there is no relationship
of friendship between a man and a woman."
Girls are routinely treated abominably in fundamentalist families.
When a boy is born, the family rejoices; when a girl is born, the
whole family mourns.  The girl's sexuality is so hated that when she
is five or so the women grab her, pin her down, and chop off her
clitoris and often her labia with a razor blade or piece of glass,
ignoring her agony and screams for help, because, they say, her
clitoris is "dirty," "ugly," "poisonous," "can cause a voracious
appetite for promiscuous sex," and "might render men impotent."  Her
vagina is then usually sewed up to prevent intercourse, leaving only
tiny hole for urination. The genital mutilation is excruciatingly
painful. About a fifth die from infections, mutilated women must
"shuffle slowly and painfully" and usually are frigid.  Over 100
million genitally mutilated women are estimated  to live today in
Islamic nations, from Somali and Sudan to Egypt, Ethiopia, Saudi
Arabia and Pakistan. Although some areas have mostly given up the
practice, in others-like Sudan and Uganda-the practice is increasing,
with 90% of the women surveyed saying they planned to circumcise all
of their daughters.
The mutilation is not required by the Qu=B4an;  Mohammad, in fact, said
girls should be treated even better than boys.  Yet the women have
inflicted upon their daughters for millennia the horrors done to
them, perhaps re-enacting the widespread misogyny of men toward
themselves as they mutilate their daughters while joyfully chanting
songs like:
"We used to be friends, but today I am the master, for I am a man.
Look-I have the knife in my hand Your clitoris, I will cut off and
throw away for today I am a man."
As the girls grow up, they are usually treated as though they were
polluted beings, veiled, rarely educated, and sometimes gang-raped
when men outside the family wish to settle scores with the men in her
family.  As the President of Pakistan's Commission on Women
concluded, "The average woman is born into near slavery, leads a life
of drudgery, and dies invariably in oblivion."  Even marriage can be
considered rape for most, since the family chooses the partner and
the girl is sometimes as young as eight.  Wife-beating is common and
divorce by wives rare-in fact, Islamic women have been known to have
been killed by their families because they asked for a divorce.  It
is no wonder that the Physicians for Human Rights found 97 percent of
women surveyed suffered from "severe depression."
        It is not surprising that these mutilated, battered women
make less than ideal mothers, repeating their own miseries upon their
children. Visitors to families throughout Muslim societies report on
the "slapping, striking, whipping and thrashing" of children, with
constant shaming and humiliation as they are told by their mothers
that they are "cowards" if they don't hit others.  Physical abuse is
continuous; as the Pakistani Conference on Child Abuse reports:
A large number of children face some form of physical abuse, from
infanticide and abandonment of babies, to beating, shaking, burning,
cutting, poisoning, holding under water or giving drugs or alcohol,
or violent acts like punching, kicking, biting, choking, beating,
shooting or stabbing
Schools regularly practice corporal punishment-particularly the
religious schools from which Taliban volunteers come-chaining up
their students for days "in dark rooms with little food and hardly
any sanitation."  Newborn infants are often swaddled "like a mummy."
Sexual abuse-described as including "fondling of genitals, coercing a
child to fondle the abuser's genitals, masturbation with the child as
either participant or observer, oral sex, anal or vaginal penetration
by penis, finger or any other object and [child] prostitution"-is
extensive, though impossible to quantify.  In some areas, children
are reported to have marks all over their bodies from being burned by
their parents with red-hot irons or pins as punishment or to cure
being possessed by demons.  Children are taught strict obedience to
all parental commands, stand when their parents enter the room, kiss
their hands, don't laugh "excessively," fear them immensely, and
learn that giving in to any of their own needs or desires is sinful.
        The ascetic results of such punitive upbringings are
predictable. When these abused children grow up, they feel that every
time they try to self-activate, every time they do something
independently for themselves, they will lose the approval of the
parents in their heads-mainly their mothers and the others in the
women's quarters. When their cities became flooded with oil money and
Western popular culture in recent decades, they were attracted to the
new freedoms and pleasures, but would soon retreat, feeling they
would lose their mommy's approval and be "bad boys." Westerners come
to represent their own "Bad Boy" self in projection, and had to be
killed off. As one Islamist put it, "America is Godless. Western
influence here is not a good thing, our people can see CNN, MTV,
kissing "  As one terrorist put it, "We will destroy American cities
piece by piece because your life style is so objectionable to us,
your pornographic movies and TV."   Osama bin Laden himself "while in
college frequented flashy nightclubs, casinos and bars [and] was a
drinker and womanizer," but soon felt extreme guilt for his sins, and
joined the extreme fundamentalist movement and preached killing
Westerners for their freedoms and their sinful enticements of
Muslims.  Most of the Taliban, in fact, are wealthy, like bin Laden,
have had contact with the West, and were shocked by "the personal
freedoms and affluence of the average citizen, by the promiscuity,
and by the alcohol and drug use of Western youth  only an absolute
and unconditional return to the fold of conservative Islamism could
protect the Muslim world from the inherent dangers and sins of the
West."  Bin Laden lives with his four wives and fifteen children in a
small cave with no running water, waging a holy war against all those
who enjoy sinful pleasures and freedom that he cannot allow himself
without losing his mommy's approval.
        From childhood, then, Islamist terrorists have been taught to
kill the part of themselves-and others-that is selfish and wants
personal pleasures and freedoms. It is in the homes-not just later in
the terrorist camps-that they learn to be martyrs and want to "die
for Allah." When terrorist suicidal bombers who were prevented from
carrying out their acts were interviewed on TV they said they felt
"ecstatic" as they pushed the button.  They denied being motivated by
the virgins supposedly awaiting them in Paradise. Instead, they said
they wanted to die to "join Allah," and had written letters to their
mothers before going off to die "so she would know I was a martyr and
she wouldn't be sad I died."
        Since childhood is the key to eliminating all political
violence, rather than pursuing a lengthy holy war against terrorists
it might be better for the U.S. to back a new U.N.-sponsored Marshall
Plan for them that includes Community Parenting Centers,  in order to
give their families the chance to evolve beyond the abusive family
system that is producing the terrorism, just as we did for Germany
after WWII  for the families that produced Nazism.

There is you know sometimes a solid darkness so near impenetrable we =
have to eat our way through. It is essential for morale. Certain =
soldiers dream of eyes to stab, or, at the last, of avoiding. But we are =
enjoined from the dark and neo-natural engines of our past, and - well - =
quite frankly - we have to eat the wall. Those black and bassile waves =
come at us. Heads and horribles all gorgon with eyes come at us. We =
hate, yet need, this darkness. Perhaps it's a Northern thing. Or  it's =
(just?) us? We, or some of us. Sometimes. And some times - like ants on =
the flax-flower whose weird white and purple spikes break to the sky so =
bitter and remote, yet, oh how so blue and gold-filled, like, well, like =
a set of magic teeth. And things. Things we'd never suspected, horrid =
and gentle things. These emerge, and come at us. And do we eat through? =
Eh? Do we? Is this thus our victory?  Toward what? By whom? Is The Great =
One watching?

   These questions curl inside a dead leaf mass of erotic sadness until =
the light is everywhere in the dawn. And we, we are held high. So high, =
eyes cannot see: yet we are naked pink and vast.

A Canadian friend said something interesting to me the other day. That Blair
is being immensely Macchiavellian. Knowing that he could not actually stop
USA doing *something, he bought into it and therefore earned multitudinous
brownie points from THE rich and powerful nation

Regarding Palestine, he's doing *something; but it could have happened a
long time ago. There may be more rejoicing in heaven when a sinner repents,
but a conclusion could be that it took mass murder for anyone to start doing
something. Maybe it did. I recall an interview with Gorbachov where he said
that the impulse for what became called glasnost was realising one day "This
can't go on"

Sharon has no intention of helping. He will block all the way. He negotiates
in bad faith. Just now he has the assassination of his minister to use, but
if it hadn't been that it would have been the colour of the sky.

The *world won't be able to see anything because it doesn't exist. Many do
see deep causes but they aren't on the podium. Those who are on the podium
exaggerate their bosses' opinions as "every one agrees"

Anger and retaliation are not the only causes of conflict. I am pretty sure
Afghanistan was scheduled for a bit of demolition already. If this were to
do with righteousness, UK and USA would hardly be allied with Russia while
it is murdering the Chechens

It's been pretty dry here for the last 6 months or so, today was more of the
same, a hot day but with a cold south-easter blowing, the dead leaves that
are always with us (gums shed all year round) scattering as I walk through
the playground. Taking advantage of a free period to nick off to the shops
and pick up the two leading newspapers. And they're leading with the war -
one featuring a memorial cover with the motto and emblem of the SAS - the
other (the respected Sydney Morning Herald) (respected by some)a little
cartoon showing a ship sailing away as one character standing on the wharf
says - What exactly are they going to fight for? - and another replies -
We'll have to wait till the movie comes out.
In the classroom, a number of kids ask to have a look at the papers, I
oblige, and notice Glen and Grant have checked out the cover then moved on
to the sports section. Sirke, the drama teacher, has had a letter from her
Finnish grandmother asking about reported outbreaks of anthrax in Australia.
There are none.
Flipping through sometextbook activities for a Year 9 class studying World
War I, I come across an Extension Activity: Devise a scenario in which
Australia might go to war  -
Driving home I'm talking quietly to Damon in the back seat until the driver,
Rod, a very dear man who can be extremely exasperating, raises his voice -
America goes in and... America goes in... America...- Damon and I know when
to shut up. Rod sometimes deals with his anger/pain by indulging a vehement
heavy=handed black humour that makes me want to scream. We both have sons
who are draftworthy - They shouldn't take him - he says - take me, my life's
over anyway, they should send me over. I'll shoot a few Americans. -
Meanwhile the election campaign rolls on - photo of Bush on the phone to the
current P.M., a mean-spirited dishonest prick of a guy who loves posing with
soldiers - the Opposition Leader declares he is completely on side (the
Labor Party was opposed to our involvment in Vietnam - times have changed
but so has the party)- but it's getting him nowhere. The Government, slated
to lose office about 6 weeks ago has manipulated the issue of refugees, and
now the war against terrorism, supported by a credulous, anxious and, again,
mean-spirited public (the racist is not too far below the surface in many
Australians) and now looks set to win.
My son, Otis, and I have another conversation about it all, when I walk away
he turns up the CD - Creedence playing Fortunate Son.
It seems like we are at war and it means something but less than I'd
expected. All of those we're sending off are trained, armed and volunteers.
It's all those who are not trained, armed or volunteers that seem to matter
more.

STEREO HEADS for Nick Zurbrugg


Good and very new arrivals come to the web screen. I am more than other text
series, an example of writing levels of consciousness. Little charity. This
is happening suppressed. It's embarrassing my other image, an array of
thinking my end. Poetry rants bare hands if he decided that this most of the
power he could bop!

Existence of an entirely different kind, to the world.

No tears over me made it all don't know.

Is this some unanticipated free world? Howd open, but not wide.

Never leave yourself. This is the same logic. They wanted their yelling. The
making history. The image on paper different to the feeling. It works and
you forget. It's not sensory enjoyment. I needed to make art.

Hi Poetics-

This is from CNN (http://www.cnn.com/2001/US/10/18/ret.flyers/index.html)--
the pamphlets/propaganda that the US is dropping (literally) on Afghanistan.
As I'm sure many of you know, the US government formally "discourages" the
press from printing translations of anything coming out of Afghanistan, Bin
Laden...etc etc...Several people in the office where I work were
"discouraged" from talking to the press about US special operations and so
on. The Administration appears to be puzzled as to why there is still so
much anti-American sentiment...

I'm sure these flyers will help. (sarcasm).

Yikes!

Flyers: 'The Partnership of Nations is here to help'

Theme: The Partnership of Nations is here to help (1)

On September 11th , the United States was the target of terrorist attacks,
leaving no choice but to seek justice for these horrible crimes. We are here
to take measures against the terrorists that have rooted themselves in your
country. It is not you, the honorable people of Afghanistan, who are
targeted, but those who would oppress you, seek to bend you to their own
will, and make you their slaves.

These terrorists and oppressors are currently in your country, undermining
your economy, your rights as citizens, and your place within the
international community. It does not have to stay that way. But the battle
against these fanatics that feed off the blood of the Afghan people cannot
be won without your help.

It will take the combined efforts of the international community and you to
remove these evil people from Afghanistan. Take the following action: Do not
give food, shelter, or any type of aid to the Taliban or Usama bin Laden.
This will be a great help in the effort.

We have no wish to hurt you, the innocent people of Afghanistan. Stay away
from military installations, government buildings, terrorist camps, roads,
factories, or bridges. If you are near these places, then you must move away
from them. Seek a safe place, and stay well away from anything that might be
a target. We do not wish to harm you.

With your help, this conflict can be over soon. And once again, Afghanistan
will belong to you, and not to tyrants or outsiders. Then, you will reclaim
your place among the nations of the world, and return to the honored place
your country once held. Remember, we are here to help you to be free from
this terrorism, despotism, and the fear and pain they bring with them. This
is the best way to restore honor and dignity and make your country a free
nation once again.

Theme: The Partnership of Nations is here to help (2)

Since the time of the Soviet invasion, Afghanistan has been a country in
conflict. War and strife have been a constant part of the daily life of its
citizens. Yet time and again, it has not been the people of Afghanistan, but
outsiders who have been the real cause of this pain and destruction.

Latest in the line of those who would aid in the destruction of this once
great country is Usama bin Laden and the despots called the Taliban who now
rule. These people have continually aided in the destruction and
deterioration of Afghanistan.

Afghanistan's economy is nearly non-existent, and because of the Taliban's
support for terrorists such as Usama bin Laden, Afghanistan has been shunned
by the international community. Even now the Taliban undermines the lives
and rights of the people of Afghanistan, treating women as little more than
slaves, and treating the rest of the population little better. The so-called
leaders of the Taliban are disrespectful of Afghan cultural and Islamic
tradition and its proud past.

Now they have brought the anger of the United States and the international
community upon themselves through their terrorist actions. Now, forces are
coming into Afghanistan from outside places to bring justice because of the
atrocities committed by Usama bin Laden and the Taliban.

With the help of the nations of the world, and the people of Afghanistan,
the United States will now remove these tyrants from Afghanistan. It will
take a combined effort to do this, and every bit of help is needed. Try to
find ways to ignore the Taliban and Usama bin Laden's requests for help, and
do not give them food or shelter.

The United States does not want to injure or kill innocent civilians,
destroy homes, hospitals, mosques, or other public places. This is most
easily avoided if people stay away from military installations, Taliban
government buildings, the camps of Usama bin Laden, and other places where
terrorists gather.

Afghanistan can once again become the proud member of the international
community that it once was. The people of Afghanistan can once again take
control of their own land and set it free from the foreign invaders and
local tyrants who have inserted themselves into its power structure. Help
free yourselves from despotism and rejoin the nations of the world.

Theme: The Partnership of Nations is here to help (3)

"Just as the blood stains the apron of the butcher, unjustly shed blood
remains on the hands of the murderer." [Afghan poem] On September 11, 2001
thousands of people were killed en masse in the United States. Among them
... was a two-year-old girl. Barely able to stand or dress herself. Did she
deserve to die? Why was she killed you ask? Was she a thief? What crime had
she committed? She was merely on a trip with her family to visit her
grandparents.

Policemen ... firefighters ... teachers ... doctors ... mothers ... fathers
... sisters ... brothers all killed. ... WHY? These people did nothing to
warrant the kind of wrath inflicted upon them.

Thousands of good people died on that day at the hands of terrorists.
Deluded fighters that prey upon the unsuspecting and the innocent. They are
cowards that hide in shadows and strike at the weak. They strike out at
expectant mothers, the elderly, and at little children. They fire their
weapons blindly inflicting death and destruction upon the innocent. They
hide like cowards and strike from afar, then return to the safety of their
shadows before they can be caught. They believe they are heroes, Ghazi
warriors triumphing over the evil of the West. However the truth is ....
They are murderers, and do not represent Islam.

It is inconceivable that any country in the world would tolerate the kinds
of horrific terrorism committed against the United States. It is now that we
ask for your help and support in seeing those guilty for these crimes
brought to justice. United States forces may be moving into or through your
area in the future. Please, for your own safety, do not interfere with
United States military operations. The United States forces are not here to
occupy you, nor are they here to make you give up your proud heritage. We
understand that your culture and heritage is important to you and we wish to
disturb it as little as possible. However we must seek out justice for those
who have fallen victim to terrorists. Terrorists and those who harbor
terrorists must be stopped. With your support we will ensure that those
guilty will be brought to justice.

Dear Afghanistan ... A grave crime has been committed against the United
States. Four of our planes have been hijacked, several buildings in our
economic centers destroyed and more than 6,000 innocent people, hundreds of
which were Muslim, were murdered by the hand of Usama bin Laden, Al Quaeda,
his supporters, and the Taliban. We see these actions as acts of war. We
will not sit idly by and do nothing in these times. However, we do not wish
to spill the blood of innocent people, as did the cowardly terrorists. We do
not blame the Muslims or Afghans for these attacks. We do not hold those who
follow true Islam responsible. We will hunt down and punish these
terrorists. They will pay with their blood. America is not against the
beliefs of Islam, nor is it against Muslims. More than million Muslims live
and worship Allah in peace in the United States, a number equal to almost
half the population of Afghanistan. In the United States people of all
religions live side by side in peace. Muslims living in America have the
same rights to worship as any other citizen of any other religion.

We are not here to attack your religion, or your way of life. We are
attacking the terrorists and their hosts, the Taliban, for the atrocities
committed against the United States. We do not wish to harm or occupy the
people of Afghanistan. The terrorists see themselves as heroes, martyrs, and
saviors.

However, no nation or religion would tolerate the kinds of viscous
unprovoked attacks like those committed against the United States. These
acts of terror and violence are inexcusable in any culture, and we will
bring to justice those who have committed these crimes.

Theme: The Partnership of Nations is here to help (5)

Attention Taliban! You are condemned. Did you know that? The instant the
terrorists you support took over our planes, you sentenced yourselves to
death. The Armed Forces of the United States are here to seek justice for
our dead. Highly trained soldiers are coming to shut down once and for all
Usama bin Laden's ring of terrorism, and the Taliban that supports them and
their actions.


Our forces are armed with state of the art military equipment. What are you
using, obsolete and ineffective weaponry? Our helicopters will rain fire
down upon your camps before you detect them on your radar. Our bombs are so
accurate we can drop them right through your windows. Our infantry is
trained for any climate and terrain on earth. United States soldiers fire
with superior marksmanship and are armed with superior weapons.


You have only one choice ... Surrender now and we will give you a second
chance. We will let you live. If you surrender no harm will come to you.
When you decide to surrender, approach United States forces with your hands
in the air. Sling your weapon across your back muzzle towards the ground.
Remove your magazine and expel any rounds. Doing this is your only chance of
survival.

Taliban leaders! By harboring Al Quaeda and their leader Usama bin Laden you
have declared war on the United States, and by doing this you have just
guaranteed your own demise. Hand over these criminals and you will save
yourselves from destruction. By not turning over Usama bin Laden and Al
Quaeda to stand trial you are showing the world you are weak, and that you
need a criminal organization and its leader to protect you. However, they
cannot protect you from what will happen if you do not comply. Like all
criminals they will try to hide from their impending punishment. They will
leave you to fight the United States and our overwhelming military by
yourselves. Our military is bigger, faster and stronger; with more
modernized weapons and better-trained troops. You will be attacked by land,
sea, and air. There will be no warning as to when and where we will attack.
Destruction is imminent if our will is not met. Bin Laden may tell you he
can protect you from the mighty United States, but all he can protect you
from are unarmed innocent men, women, and children. He can have his
subordinates hijack civilian airplanes and take bombs into civilian
buildings, but he cannot save you from the justice of the United States.
Resistance is futile, our goals will be achieved. If not willingly than by
overwhelming force. You have but one choice, and that is to comply quickly,
for time is short. You will suffer the same fate as the terrorist if you do
not comply with our demand.

Tragedy struck the United States on 11 September 2001 when terrorist
hijackers took over two Boeing 767 jets and two Boeing 757 jets. American
Airlines and United Airlines flights were hijacked and used in the acts to
kill over 6,500 innocent men, women, and children. Many of these people were
not American; but representatives from 67 countries from all over the world.
Many were even Muslims. The hijackers proceeded to crash the planes into
World Trade Center Towers one and two. Another plane crashed on a field in
Pennsylvania when heroic passengers retook control of the aircraft. Hundreds
of innocent lives were lost on just the aircraft alone. Thousands are feared
to have been lost in the attack on the former World Trade Center Towers,
that collapsed as a result of the terrorist act.

We ask that you, the true people of Afghanistan, help us bring Usama bin
Laden and members of his terrorist group, Al Quaeda, to justice for crimes
committed against innocent people. Not only have Usama bin Laden and Al
Quaeda committed crimes against the United States, but they have also
dishonored Afghanistan and helped in the continuation of bloodshed in your
country. They are using your country as a nest of terrorism to kill your
people and innocent Americans. These outsiders do not care about the welfare
of Afghanistan, nor of their countries, and people all over the world. These
terrorists are blackening the reputation of the people of Afghanistan and
Islam. The people of Afghanistan are known for bravery and upholding honor.
These terrorists, with their cowardice ruin this reputation. You can help by
not interfering with United States troops or operations, by not supplying
him or his supporters with food, water, or lodging. Small things such as
these will make the biggest impact.

United States forces do not want to see a senseless loss of life. We do not
want to take over your nation; we want to give it back to its rightful
owners, the people of Afghanistan. The United States wants to see a return
to prosperity for your nation. With your help we can achieve this. If we
work together Usama bin Laden, his supporters, and terrorists like them will
no longer be able to incite fear in people around the world.

Do you enjoy being ruled by the Taliban? Are you proud to live a life of
fear? Are you happy to see the place your family has owned for generations a
terrorist training site? Are you proud to live under a government that
harbors terrorists? Are you proud to live in a nation ruled by extreme
fundamentalists?

The Taliban have robbed your country of your heritage. They have destroyed
your national monuments, and cultural artifacts. They rule by force,
violence, and fear. They insist that their form of Islam is the one and only
form, the true form, the divine form. They see themselves as religious
experts. They seek to rob you and your nation of its past. That which has
brought you together as a nation over the past thousands of years is being
slowly torn apart. They destroy your national treasures. They also harbor
terrorists.


United States forces have come to stop Usama bin Laden and to shut down the
terrorist camps once and for all. United States forces are here to strike
back at the Taliban and at the rest of Bin Laden's fighters. It is the
United States' right as a nation to seek justice for those killed in the
attacks on the World Trade Center. Over 6500 people lost their lives in the
attacks on the World Trade Center, many of whom were not American, but
representatives from other countries around the world. Many were Muslim.
Terrorists and those who harbor terrorists must be brought to justice. Do
not interfere with United States military operations. Battlefields are
places for soldiers, not civilians. Our soldiers are not here to take over
your way of life. Your culture is important to you, and to us. We do not
wish to destroy it.

into the Stone Age and giving Islam a bad name? Are you proud to live under
a government that harbors terrorists? Are you proud to live in a nation
ruled by extreme fundamentalists?


The Taliban have robbed your country of your culture and heritage. They have
destroyed your national monuments, and cultural artifacts. They rule by
force, violence, and fear based on the advice of foreigners. They insist
that their form of Islam is the one and only form, the true form, the divine
form. They see themselves as religious experts, even though they are
ignorant.


They kill, commit injustice, keep you in poverty and claim it is in the name
of God. They seek to rob you and your nation of its past. That which is the
source of pride and has brought you together as a nation in the past is
being ripped apart. They destroy your national treasures and they also
harbor terrorists. They keep people as if they are animals for the
slaughter. They are not concerned with leaving your families fatherless and
your mothers begging in the streets in order to feed their children.

United States forces have come to stop Usama bin Laden and to shut down the
terrorist camps once and for all. United States forces are here to strike
back at the Taliban and Bin Laden's fighters. Tyrants and those who harbor
terrorists must be brought to justice. It is the United States' right as a
nation to seek justice for those killed in the attacks on the World Trade
Center. Over 6500 people were killed in that attack. People from all over 67
nations of the world and from many religions. Please do not interfere with
United States military operations. Our soldiers are not here to take over
your way of life. Your culture is important to you, and to us.

We wish for a better life for you, for the children of Afghanistan to live
independently, free of foreign domination and oppression imposed by the
Taliban's ways.

Theme: Taliban actions are Non-Islamic (4)

People of Afghanistan, do you support the puppet rulers of your nation and
their political practices? How can you support the Taliban when they give
refuge to Usama bin Laden, whose evil actions are aimed at Muslims and
non-Muslims alike? The result of a terrorist attack does not differentiate
between people. It kills people of all ages, races and religions.

Usama bin Laden would have you believe he is for a united Islamic nation,
but how can that be true when even his home nation has exiled him? Saudi
Arabia exiled him in 1991 and in 1994 he lost his Saudi Arabian citizenship
as a result of his terrorist activities. Usama bin Laden is a coward who
hides behind cowardly attacks on innocent people, killing them because they
disagree with his twisted, non-Islamic beliefs. The Taliban support his
criminal and inhumane activities by doing nothing to bring him to justice.
The Taliban regime is not even a recognized government by most of the world
community. Yet its leaders dictate over you, when it is you, the honored
people of Afghanistan, who should live under your own laws and beliefs and
not the laws and beliefs of a terrorist supporting regime.


Think of your children. Do you want them to live in fear of what one man and
his supporters would do to them if their beliefs differed from his? What if
he decides that not only Western nations pose a threat, but also Muslim
nations that do not agree with his way of life? Contrary to his beliefs the
United States is neither anti-Muslim, nor against the people of Afghanistan,
but we are for an Afghanistan free from oppression, killing, and poverty.

Theme: Taliban actions are Non-Islamic (5)

Noble people of Afghanistan ... Today is a day of mourning for your country.
Your history and culture are being destroyed. The Taliban have tried to
erase your past to hide you from the truth. They have destroyed historical
and religious monuments in order to instill their form of aberrant Islam.
They say that they are doing it for your own protection.

You have lived together for hundreds of years before the Taliban. What do
the Taliban give you? Do they listen to you? Do they supply you with food
and medicine or do they hoard it for themselves? The Taliban tells you that
dying for their fanatical form of Islam is a proud and noble thing to do.
They encourage you to be martyrs, but in reality, they are cowards hiding
behind farmers, and families. If dying for this form of Islam is noble, why
doesn't Mullah Omar go to the fronts? He is enjoying his luxurious quarters
and his wives while you are asked to die.

The Taliban has tarnished the name of your proud nation by making it a haven
for criminals and terrorists. They have provided supplies intended for the
people of Afghanistan to Usama bin Laden and Al Quaeda. Their actions are
bringing war to your homes. Is this what you want? Is this the kind of
future you want for your children? Speak out! Stand up and let your voice be
heard!

Resist, and encourage your friends and neighbors to resist! The Taliban have
gone too far! The Taliban can only rule if you choose to let them.

Theme: Aid will be brought to your location

Attention! People of Afghanistan, United States forces will be moving
through your area. We are not here to harm you! We are here for Usama bin
Laden, Al Quaeda, and those who protect them! Please, for you own safety,
stay off bridges and roadways, and do not interfere with our troops or
military operations. If you do this, you will not be harmed. Do not approach
United States forces. Stay in your homes! We are not here to occupy you, or
to overrun your country. If you see United States forces, you need to find
shelter and not leave it until we have left the area. This is for your
protection. Roadways and bridges will be unsafe for travel. Your home will
be the safest place. Do not listen to the Taliban or Al Quaeda. We will not
harm you if you comply with these instructions.

Once again, we do not want to harm any innocent people.

Theme: Safety and Security

Attention, people of Afghanistan! Aid is being dropped by plane at a very
high altitude using large parachutes. These parachutes slow their descent.
Despite the parachutes, the bundles will still fall very fast. These bundles
will drift and shift directions due to wind. These bundles may appear small,
but they are in fact very large and heavy. Do not stand directly below them.
Let the bundles land and settle before you approach them. If you follow
these instructions you will not be injured. The bundles are filled with
food, water, and medical supplies. The bundles will not contain any military
related supplies or equipment. These have been given to you by the United
States in an effort to show our support for the fair people of Afghanistan.
The United States does not want you, the innocent people of Afghanistan, to
suffer for the deeds of Al Quaeda and its leader Usama bin laden. That is
why the United States has prepared and delivered these aid bundles. The
United States can not warn you enough about the danger that you will put
yourself in if you do not stay away from the bundles until they land. Once
the bundles have landed and settled you can retrieve the supplies. These
supplies are being sent to help you, because you did not commit the crimes
against the United States, Al Quaeda and its supporters did.

A Mind of Its Own: A Cultural History of the Penis

David M. Friedman's A Mind of Its Own is a cultural examination of the penis,
from ancient Sumer to the present. Friedman convincingly suggests that
humankind's various and contradictory attitudes toward the penis have been
instrumental in mapping the course of both Western civilization and world
history.

Friedman begins with pagan attitudes: ancient Greeks considered the penis a
measure of a man's proximity to "divine power," while the Romans, whose
generals were known to promote soldiers based on penis size, saw it as an
indicator of earthly strength. Thanks to the spread of Christianity, the
"sacred staff became the demon rod"--a fearful manifestation of the devil.
Theology gave way, grudgingly, to science. In the Renaissance, anatomical
discoveries allowed for the possibility that this "agent of death" was, in
fact, only a "blameless instrument of reproduction." Subsequent chapters
discuss the penis's role as a racial yardstick; its "defining role in human
personality" as asserted by Freud; its politicization; and finally, through
the
likes of Viagra, its objectification as a "thing ... impervious to religious
teachings, psychological insights, racial stereotypes and feminist criticism."

Friedman's study of what he calls the "symbolic muscle" is filled with
fascinating side trips (castration cults, ancient graffiti, the
anti-masturbation "semen-retention movement," aphrodisiacs through the ages,
and, to modern eyes, risible medical practices with the likes of monkey
glands), as well as a rich cast of characters (Leonardo da Vinci, John Kellogg
of cornflake fame, Kate Millet, Clarence Thomas, and Walt Whitman). The book
is
informal, but well researched (and documented), entertaining but not cute,
wide-ranging but not sketchy, and simultaneously irreverent and
respectful. --H. O'Billovich

From Publishers Weekly starred review
"Over time, the penis has been deified, demonized, secularized, racialized,
psychoanalyzed, politicized and, finally, medicalized," declares freelance
journalist Friedman in a serious yet entertaining book that weaves together an
enormous amount of material. In the Greek and Roman worlds, statues of figures
with erections were commonplace, he observes, though by the Christian era, the
penis had become a source of evil and weakness. Doctors and scientists from da
Vinci onward "deflat[ed] the religious rhetoric" and scrutinized the male
organ
sometimes with untoward results, as when American "semen science" led to the
creation of antimasturbation products such as Graham crackers. Western man's
fear of the African phallus undergirded colonialism and slavery, and resonates
to this day, Friedman argues, as was evident in the case of Clarence Thomas.
If
some of Freud's case histories might be questioned, Friedman notes how the
psychoanalytic interpretation enduringly places the penis and associated
anxieties at the fulcrum of society. The rise of feminism put the penis in its
place, as The Hite Report pointed out the limits of conventional intercourse
in
moving women to orgasm, and as Andrea Dworkin exposed penile pathology though
the author concludes that male sexuality arises more out of evolutionary
strategy than misogyny. His final and liveliest chapter concerns the
medicalization of the penis, culminating in Viagra. Even though Friedman
quotes
a (female) sex therapist on the limits of such drugs, he concludes
optimistically that "the erection industry" has performed a paradigm shift,
allowing man to impose his will below his belt. The book has a few gaps --
there's little about the gay penis -- but it should reign as the seminal
treatment of this topic (and inspire many more puns).

From Library Journal

An impressively research-prone journalist who has written for Esquire, Rolling
Stone, and the Village Voice, Friedman has prepared a catalog of happenings
and
horrors perpetrated on the penis or in the name of the penis as an organ and
as
an idea. His opening chapter about religious teachings begins with a ghastly
story about the torture of a witch who "knew the Devil's penis." Next come
Tissot and the medical antimasturbation mania, plus biological discoveries
about the organ. This is followed by an even more terrible and detailed
discussion of racist stereotypes and violence relating to supposedly
macrophallic Africans. Chapter 4 belongs to Dr. Freud, Chapter 5 to feminist
criticism, and Chapter 6 to Viagra and the erection industry since ancient
Egypt. Referenced in considerable (if not perfect) detail, the work could be
improved only by textual subheads and (perhaps) illustrations. A fascinating
and sobering complement to more lighthearted books, including Maggie Paley's
The Book of the Penis (Grove, 2001), Joseph Cohen's The Penis Book (Konemann,
2001), and Kit Schwartz's The Male Member (St. Martin's, 1985). Recommended
for
collections in history, popular culture, and sexology. Martha Cornog,

Book Description

Whether enemy or ally, demon or god, the source of satisfaction or the root of
all earthly troubles, the penis has forced humanity to wrestle with its
enduring mysteries. Here, in an enlightening and entertaining cultural study,
is a book that gives context to the central role of the penis in Western
civilization.

A man can hold his manhood in his hand, but who is really gripping whom? Is
the
penis the best in man -- or the beast? How is man supposed to use it? And when
does that use become abuse? Of all the bodily organs, only the penis forces
man
to confront such contradictions: something insistent yet reluctant, a tool
that
creates but also destroys, a part of the body that often seems apart from the
body. This is the conundrum that makes the penis both hero and villain in a
drama that shapes every man -- and mankind along with it.

In A Mind of Its Own, David M. Friedman shows that the penis is more than a
body part. It is an idea, a conceptual but flesh-and-blood measuring stick of
man's place in the world. That men have a penis is a scientific fact; how they
think about it, feel about it, and use it is not. It is possible to identify
the key moments in Western history when a new idea of the penis addressed the
larger mystery of man's relationship with it and changed forever the way that
organ was conceived of and put to use. A Mind of Its Own brilliantly distills
this complex and largely unexamined story.

Deified by the pagan cultures of the ancient world and demonized by the early
Roman church, the organ was later secularized by pioneering anatomists such as
Leonardo da Vinci. After being measured "scientifically" in an effort to
subjugate some races while elevating others, the organ was psychoanalyzed by
Sigmund Freud. As a result, the penis assumed a paradigmatic role in
psychology -- whether the patient was equipped with the organ or envied those
who were. Now, after being politicized by feminism and exploited in countless
ways by pop culture, the penis has been medicalized. As no one has before him,
Friedman shows how the arrival of erection industry products such as Viagra is
more than a health or business story. It is the latest -- and perhaps final --
chapter in one of the longest sagas in human history: the story of man's
relationship with his penis.

A Mind of Its Own charts the vicissitudes of that relationship through its
often amusing, occasionally alarming, and never boring course. With
intellectual rigor and a healthy dose of wry humor, David M. Friedman serves
up
one of the most thought-provoking, significant, and readable cultural works in
years.

"school prayer" poem which really bummed me out, though not quite as much as
it bummed out my sister who is a confirmed atheist. She kept quiet, but I
think now's the time to speak, and also to listen. If we can't hear out our
relatives, who can we hear out?
Shuddering remembrances of discussing Anita Hill with my Gramps, tho that
didn't turn out so badly (the discussion, that is).
I also want a tshirt, though I don't know what it ought to say.
Is Eileen Myles available to run for office?
Who would you choose?
I would choose Maxine Hong Kingston.

WAR FRENZY

(circulated to migrant-committee list serve based at Simon Fraser University

My recent speech at a women’s conference on violence against women has
generated much controversy.  In the aftermath of the terrible attacks of
September 11, I argued that the U.S. response of launching ‘America’s new
war’ would increase violence against women.  I situated the current crisis
within the continuity of North/South relations, rooted in colonialism and
imperialism.  I criticized American foreign policy, as well as President
Bush’s racialized construction of the American Nation.  Finally, I spoke of
the need for solidarity with Afghan women’s organizations as well as the
urgent necessity for the women’s movement in Canada to oppose the war.

Decontextualized and distorted media reports of my address have led to
accusations of me being an academic impostor, morally bankrupt and engaging
in hate-mongering.  It has been fascinating to observe how my comments
regarding American foreign policy, a record well documented by numerous
sources whose accuracy or credentials cannot be faulted, have been dubbed
‘hate-speech.’  To speak about the indisputable record of U.S. backed coups,
death squads, bombings and killings ironically makes me a ‘hate-monger.’ I
was even made the subject of a ‘hate-crime’ complaint to the RCMP, alleging
that my speech was a ‘hate-crime.’
Despite the virulence of these responses, I welcome the public discussion my
speech has generated as an opportunity to further the public debate about
Canada’s support of America’s new war.  When I made the speech, I believed
it was imperative to have this debate before any attacks were launched on
any country.  Events have overtaken us with the bombing of Afghanistan
underway and military rule having been declared in Pakistan.  The need for
this discussion has now assumed greater urgency as reports of casualties are
making their way into the news.  My speech at the women’s conference was
aimed at mobilizing the women’s movement against this war.   I am now glad
for this opportunity to address wider constituencies and in different fora.

First, however, a few words about my location: I place my work within the
tradition of radical, politically engaged scholarship.  I have always
rejected the politics of academic elitism which insist that academics should
remain above the fray of political activism and use only disembodied,
objectified language and a ‘properly’ dispassionate professorial demeanor to
establish our intellectual credentials.  My work is grounded in the
politics, practices and languages of the various communities I come from,
and the social justice movements to which I am committed.

ON AMERICAN FOREIGN POLICY

In the aftermath of the terrible September 11th attacks on the World Trade
Centre and the Pentagon, the Bush administration launched “America’s War on
Terrorism.”  Eschewing any role for the United Nations and the need to abide
by international law, the US administration initiated an international
alliance to justify its unilateral military action against Afghanistan.  One
of its early coalition partners was the Canadian government which committed
its unequivocal support for whatever forms of assistance the United States
might request.  In this circumstance, it is entirely reasonable that people
in Canada examine carefully the record of American foreign policy.

As I observed in my speech, this record is alarming and does not inspire
confidence.  In Chile, the CIA-backed coup against the democratically
elected Allende government led to the deaths of over 30,000 people.  In El
Salvador, the U.S. backed regime used death squads to kill about 75,000
people.  In Nicaragua, the U.S. sponsored terrorist contra war led to the
deaths of over 30,000 people.  The initial bombing of Iraq left over 200,000
dead, and the bombings have continued for the last ten years.  UNICEF
estimates that over one million Iraqis have died, and that 5,000 more die
every month as a result of the U.N. imposed sanctions, enforced in their
harshest form by U.S. power.  The list does not stop here.  150,000 were
killed and 50,000 disappeared in Guatemala after the 1954 CIA-sponsored
coup; over 2 million were killed in Vietnam; and 200,000 before that in the
Hiroshima and Nagasaki nuclear attacks.  Numerous authoritarian regimes have
been backed by the United States including Saudi Arabia, Egypt, the
apartheid regime in South Africa, Suharto’s dictatorship in Indonesia,
Marcos in the Philippines, and Israel’s various occupations of Lebanon, the
Golan Heights and the Palestinian territories.  The U.S. pattern of foreign
intervention has been to overthrow leftist governments and to impose right
wing regimes which in turn support U.S. interests, even if this means
training and using death squads and assassinating leftist politicians and
activists.  To this end, it has a record of treating civilians as entirely
expendable.

It is in this context that I made my comment that the United States is the
largest and most dangerous global force, unleashing horrific levels of
violence around the world, and that the path of U.S. foreign policy is
soaked in blood.  The controversy generated by this comment has surprisingly
not addressed the veracity of this assessment of the U.S. record.  Instead,
it has focused on my tone and choice of words (inflammatory, excessive,
inelegant, un-academic, angry, etc.).

Now I have to admit that my use of the words ‘horrific violence’ and ‘soaked
in blood’ is very deliberate and carefully considered.  I do not use these
words lightly.  To successive United States administrations the deaths
resulting from its policies have been just so many statistics, just so much
‘collateral damage.’ Rendering invisible the humanity of the peoples
targeted for attack is a strategy well used to hide the impact of
colonialist and imperialist interventions.  Perhaps there is no more potent
a strategy of dehumanization than to proudly proclaim the accuracy and
efficiency of ‘smart’ weapons systems, and of surgical and technological
precision, while rendering invisible the suffering bodies of these peoples
as disembodied statistics and mere ‘collateral damage.’ The use of embodied
language, grounded in the recognition of the actual blood running through
these bodies, is an attempt to humanize these peoples in profoundly graphic
terms.  It compels us to recognize the sheer corporeality of the terrain
upon which bombs rain and mass terror is waged.  This language calls on ‘us’
to recognize that ‘they’ bleed just like ‘we’ do, that ‘they’ hurt and
suffer just like ‘us.’  We are complicit in this bloodletting when we
support American wars.  Witness the power of this embodiment in the shocked
and horrified responses to my voice and my words, rather than to the actual
horror of these events.  I will be the first to admit that it is extremely
unnerving to ‘see’ blood in the place of abstract, general categories and
statistics.  Yet this is what we need to be able to see if we are to
understand the terrible human costs of empire-building.

We have all felt the shock and pain of repeatedly witnessing the searing
images of violence unleashed upon those who died in New York and Washington.
The stories we have heard from their loved ones have made us feel their
terrible human loss.  Yet where do we witness the pain of the victims of
U.S. aggression?  How do we begin to grasp the extent of their loss?  Whose
humanity do we choose to recognize and empathize with, and who becomes just
so much ‘collateral damage’ to us?  Anti-colonial and anti-imperialist
movements and theorists have long insisted on placing the bodies and
experiences of marginalized others at the centre of our analysis of the
social world.  To fail to do so at this moment in history would be
unconscionable.
In the aftermath of the responses to my speech, I am more convinced than
ever of the need to engage in the language and politics of embodied thinking
and speaking.  After all, it is the lives, and deaths, of millions of human
beings we are discussing.  This is neither a controversial nor a recent
demand.  Feminists (such as of Mahasweta Devi, Toni Morrison, Gayatri Spivak
and Patricia Williams) have forcefully drawn our attention to what is
actually done to women’s bodies in the course of mapping out racist colonial
relations.  Frantz Fanon, one of the foremost theorists of decolonization,
studied and wrote about the role of violence in colonial social organization
and about the psychology of oppression; but he described just as readily the
bloodied, violated black bodies and the “searing bullets” and “blood-stained
knives” which were the order of the day in the colonial world.  Eduardo
Galeano entitled one of his books The Open Veins of Latin America and the
post-colonial theorist Achille Mbembe talks of the “mortification of the
flesh,” of the “mutilation” and “decapitation” of oppressed bodies.  Aime
Cesaire’s poetry pulses with the physicality of blood, pain, fury and rage
in his outcry against the domination of African bodies.  Even Karl Marx,
recognized as one of the founding fathers of the modern social sciences,
wrote trenchant critiques of capital, exploitation, and classical political
economy; and did not flinch from naming the economic system he was studying
‘vampire capitalism.’  In attempting to draw attention to the violent
effects of abstract and impersonal policies, I claim a proud intellectual
pedigree.

INVOKING THE AMERICAN NATION

In my speech I argued that in order to legitimize the imperialist aggression
which the  Bush administration is undertaking, the President is invoking an
American nation and people as being vengeful and bloodthirsty.  It is de
rigueur in the social sciences to acknowledge that the notion of a ‘nation’
or a ‘people’ is socially constructed.  The American nation is no exception.

If we consider the language used by Bush and his administration to mobilize
this nation for the war, we encounter the following: launching a crusade;
operation infinite justice; fighting the forces of evil and darkness;
fighting the barbarians; hunting down the evil-doers; draining the swamps of
the Middle East, etc., etc.  This language is very familiar to peoples who
have been colonized by Europe.  Its use at this moment in time reveals that
it is a fundamentalist and racialized western ideology which is being
mobilized to rally the troops and to build a national and international
consensus in defence of ‘civilization.’  It suggests that anyone who
hesitates to join in is also ‘evil’ and ‘uncivilized.’  In this vein, I have
repeatedly been accused of supporting extremist Islamist regimes merely for
criticizing US foreign policy and western colonialism.
Another tactic to mobilize support for the war has been the manipulation of
public opinion.  Polls conducted in the immediate aftermath of the September
11 attacks were used to repeatedly inform us that the overwhelming majority
of Americans allegedly supported a strong military retaliation.  They did
not know against whom, but they purportedly supported this strategy anyway.
In both the use of language and these polls, we are witnessing what Noam
Chomsky has called the “manufacture of consent.”  Richard Lowry, editor of
the National Review opined, “If we flatten part of Damascus or Tehran or
whatever it takes, this is part of the solution.”  President Bush stated,
“We will bear no distinction between those who commit the terrorist attacks
and those who harbour them.”  Even as the bombing began last weekend, he
declared that the war is “broader” than against just Afghanistan, that other
nations have to decide if they side with his administration or if they are
“murderers and outlaws themselves.”

We have been asked by most public commentators to accept the calls for
military aggression against “evil-doers” as natural, understandable and even
reasonable, given the attacks on the United States.  I reject this position.
It would be just as understandable a response to re-examine American foreign
policy, to address the root causes of the violent attacks on the United
States, and to make a commitment to abide by international law.  In my
speech, I urged women to break through this discourse of ‘naturalizing’ the
military aggression, and recognize it for what it is, vengeful retribution
and an opportunity for a crude display of American military might.  We are
entitled to ask: Who will make the decision regarding which ‘nations’ are to
be labeled as “murderers” and “outlaws”?  Which notions of ‘justice’ are to
be upheld?   Will the Bush administration set the standard, even as it is
overtly institutionalizing racial profiling across the United States?

I make very clear distinctions between people in America and their
government’s call for war.  Many people in America are seeking to contest
the ‘national’ consensus being manufactured by speaking out and by
organizing rallies and peace marches in major cities, about which there has
been very little coverage in Canada.    Irresponsible media reporting of my
comments which referred to Bush’s invocation of the American nation as a
vengeful one deliberately took my words out of this context, repeating them
in one television broadcast after another in a grossly distorted fashion.

My choice of language was, again, deliberate.  I wanted to bring attention
to Bush’s right wing, fundamentalist leanings and to the
neo-colonialist/imperialist practices of his administration.  The words
‘bloodthirsty’ and ‘vengeful’ are designations most people are quite
comfortable attributing to ‘savages’ and to the ‘uncivilized,’ while the
United States is represented as the beacon of democracy and civilization.
The words ‘bloodthirsty’ and ‘vengeful’ make us confront the nature of the
ideological justification for this war, as well as its historical roots,
unsettling and discomforting as that might be.

THE POLITICS OF LIBERATING WOMEN

I have been taken to task for stating that there will be no emancipation for
women anywhere until western domination of the planet is ended.  In my
speech I pointed to the importance of Afghanistan for its strategic location
near Central Asia’s vast resources of oil and natural gas.  I think there is
very little argument that the West continues to dominate and consume a vast
share of the world’s resources.  This is not a controversial statement.
Many prominent intellectuals, journalists and activists alike, have pointed
out that this domination is rooted in the history of colonialism and rests
on the ongoing maintenance of the North/South divide, and that it will
continue to provoke violence and resistance across the planet.  I argued
that in the current climate of escalating militarism, there will be precious
little emancipation for women, either in the countries of the North or the
South.

In the specific case of Afghanistan, it was the American administration’s
economic and political interests which led to its initial support for, and
arming of, Hekmatyar’s Hezb i Islami and its support for Pakistan’s
collaboration in, and organization of, the Taliban regime in the mid-1990s.
According to the Pakistani journalist Ahmed Rashid, the United States and
Unocal conducted negotiations with the Taliban for an oil pipeline through
Afghanistan for years in the mid-1990s.  We have seen the horrendous
consequences this has had for women in Afghanistan.  When Afghan women’s
groups were calling attention to this U.S. support as a major factor in the
Taliban regime’s coming to power, we did not heed them.  We did not
recognize that Afghan women’s groups were in the front line resisting the
Taliban and its Islamist predecessors, including the present militias of the
Northern Alliance.  Instead, we chose to see them only as ‘victims’ of
‘Islamic culture,’ to be pitied and ‘saved’ by the West.  Time and time
again, third world feminists have pointed out to us the pitfalls of
rendering invisible the agency and resistance of women of the South, and of
reducing women’s oppression to various third world ‘cultures.’  Many
continue to ignore these insights.  Now, the U.S. administration has thrown
its support behind the Northern Alliance, even as Afghan women’s groups
oppose the U.S. military attacks on Afghanistan, and raise serious concerns
about the record of the Northern Alliance in perpetuating human rights
abuses and violence against women in the country.  If we listen to the
voices of these women, we will very quickly be disabused of the notion that
U.S. military intervention is going to lead to the emancipation of women in
Afghanistan.  Even before the bombings began, hundreds of thousands of
Afghan women were compelled to flee their homes and communities, and to
become refugees.  The bombings of Kabul, Kandahar, Jalalabad and other
cities in the country will result in further loss of life, including the
lives of women and children.  Over three million Afghan refugees are now on
the move in the wake of the U.S. attacks.  How on earth can we justify these
bombings in the name of furthering women’s emancipation?

My second point was that imperialism and militarism do not further women’s
liberation in westerm countries either.  Women have to be brought into line
to support racist imperialist goals and practices, and they have to live
with the men who have been brutalized in the waging of war when these men
come back.  Men who kill women and children abroad are hardly likely to come
back cured of the effects of this brutalization.  Again, this is not a very
controversial point of view.  Women are taught to support military
aggressions, which is then presented as being in their ‘national’ interest.
These are hardly the conditions in which women’s freedoms can be furthered.
As a very small illustration, just witness the very public vilification I
have been subjected to for speaking out in opposition to this war.

I have been asked by my detractors that if I, as a woman, I am so critical
of western domination, why do I live here?  It could just as readily be
asked of them that if they are so contemptuous of the non-western world, why
do they so fervently desire the oil, trade, cheap labour and other resources
of that world?  Challenges to our presence in the West have long been
answered by people of colour who say, We are here because you were (are?)
there!  Migrants find ourselves in multiple locations for a myriad of
reasons, personal, historical and political.  Wherever we reside, however,
we claim the right to speak and participate in public life.

CLOSING WORDS….

My speech was made to rally the women’s movement in Canada to oppose the
war.  Journalists and editors across the country have called me idiotic,
foolish, stupid and just plain nutty.  While a few journalists and
columnists have attempted balanced coverage of my speech, too many sectors
of the media have resorted to vicious personal attacks.  Like others, I must
express a concern that this passes for intelligent commentary in the
mainstream media.

The manner in which I have been vilified is difficult to understand, unless
one sees it as a visceral response to an ‘ungrateful immigrant’ or an uppity
woman of colour who dares to speak out.  Vituperation and ridicule are two
of the most common forms of silencing dissent.  The subsequent harassment
and intimidation which I have experienced, as have some of my colleagues,
confirms that the suppression of debate is more important to many supporters
of the current frenzied war rhetoric than is the open discussion of policy
and its effects.  Fortunately, I have also received strong messages of
support.  Day by day the opposition to this unconscionable war is growing in
Canada and all over the world.

I would like to thank all of my family, friends, colleagues and allies who
have supported and encouraged me.

Dear Friends,

Drunken Boat's third issue is now up at:

http://www.drunkenboat.com

The journal, if you're not familiar with it, is
dedicated to bringing together the best of more
traditional forms of representation, like poetry and
prose, with works of art endemic to the medium of the
web, like hypertext, sound, video and digital
animation. We're also committed to the egalitarian
ideal of making works of art readily accessible to
wide audiences.

This third installment is a special double issue
loosely gathered around the theme of ethnopoetics
(though the utility of said term is up for debate). We
are featuring over fifty contributors constituting a
range the likes of which we believe may never have
inhabited the same space before. Contributors include
Mark Amerika, Charles Bernstein, Alice Fulton, Wes
Meyer, T'ai Freedom Ford, Heather McHugh, Timothy Liu,
David Daniels and Naomi Maruta, among many others.
Please feel free to write to us with your comments,
questions, responses, vituperations and/or accolades.
Our next reading period will begin at the end of this
year and anyone interested in submitting work should
email:   editors@drunkenboat.com

A special thanks also to all of our contributors and
supporters who have made this issue possible. Thanks
for your support.

Best,
Ravi Shankar

Hey all.

There are still a few free issues of Samizdat #8 left, but as usual,
they're going fast...


For those of you who want to know more about some of the BELGIAN
SURREALISTS in Samizdat #8, I've just heard that the new Exquisite
Corpse is up, and has some poems by the two of the same guys, Gabriel
and Mrcel Piqueray.  Here's the URL and a blurb:

http://www.corpse.org/


GABRIEL and MARCEL PIQUERAY were Belgian surrealist writers, most active
in
the Forties and Fifties, and for that they are being punished here in
translation by ROBERT ARCHAMBEAU and JEAN-LUC GARNEAU!

By the way, Andrei Codrescu, who edits the Corpse, was just up here at
Lake Forest for a reading, and did a great job.  There's some wierd kind
of Codrescu-Samizdat harmonic convergence going on, too: we're including
an Anselm Hollo chapbook with the mag, and Andrei's got some kind words
about Hollo on his own website's "message du jour" at:

Marc. This is well put. If Bin Laden etal were (and maybe they are) terrible
people how much more horrible are they than say Hitler or (long list of
"evil" people) are as or more so and they have been "dealt with" so  to
speak (atrocities continue nevertheless and have done seemingly forever by
"all sides") then - well the West has survivied attacks on its feedom and
integrity before: and the East has survived and parts of the East without
our assistance.
    If, and only if , it can be shown and is demonstrated clearly to me in
the coming days and months that Bin Laden IS more terrible than Bush, or
Sharon, or Slobovich, or whomever: then we can all get behind the US and
hunker down for a long struggle against a Religious Nazi: but if not....well
its clear we need, vitally need, our wits and our skepticism and our ability
to get information (eg from the women in Palestine, and yes, those in
Pakistan, and the television channels WHEREVER by whom)...truth may be a
casualty but dont let it get burnt to death by napalm and dont let Bush 2 of
the (good mates apparently in business was his father with the Ladens) let
his popaganda factory obscure what IS going on, whatever that is...
  Why isnt there an internmational conference involving all these peole with
good info (uncommneted or censored) from all sides: Bin Laden - if he IS the
monstor he is portrayed as - if he sees positive activity by the (worst side
of the US and Britain) might change his "blanket hate" and become more
tolerant: he certainly wont as he is being hounded. Meantime (possibly for
wrong possibly right reasons) this War on Afghanistan is another
Terrorism-Generator.
   And most of us simply dont know whose bullshitting who. WE have to seek
solutions: possibly, or maybe I'm being stupidly naive, long term solutions
that might lead eg to Palestine and Israel co-habiting in the Levant: the
Taleban becoming "less strange"...just as it seems that the Iranian Muslims
have become more "tolerant"....it seems to me that, by and large, the Arab
and Middle Eastern people are more restraimed and civilised than we
Westerners. Less bloody minded. At least two world wars in the twentieth
century, Korea, Vietnam, the supression of Allende, Indonesia (millions
murdered probably with CIA approval if not active involovement), Australia's
continuing attack on the rights of Aboriginee peoples and the refusal of
their fascist Prime Minister to help people from another country, New
Zealand's gutless and slavish "yes sir no sir good on you Mr Bush we'll send
about 100 SAS" !!!!!(and our less than enviable record vis a vis the Maori
peole,  death squads in South and Central America, shit stirring in Canada
and Alaska over oil, huge squalor and suffering in Mexico etc,
Yugoslava....it goes on....
   Show me where the ships are steaming toward the US, the enormous arms
build up etc...China could take out the US in a few weeks: why not attack
China: after all its "Communist" and does nasty things to its citizens, why
not bomb the hell out of the Chinese? "Becuase it might be a bit harder
Sir?" "Correct!" "So that's why we blast the crap out of a lump of sand with
not so many people grubbing around for food who cant shoot down our
aeroplanes and we can maybe use the Aussies who just sent about 1000 SAS to
do our dirty work Sir?"  "Excellent Wiggins, but remember that as in Vietnam
we can use black men ordupes from a thing called the N.A. in the front line
if things get too tough, that sort of thing, take the rest of the day off."
"Thank you sir, can I throw rocks at that funny man with the turban at the
corner store...?"  "Go on Wiggins, have a jolly day ...by the way the
syllabus is being revised, so we wont be learning history for a while."
"Why, sir?" "Welll Wiggins, its very complicated, but the winners write
history and all that but if you go away and torment any one who is strange
then you can all have lots of holidays and we wont try to teach you any
history or poems or any of those hard things anymore." "Hooray! Oh Sir,
you're such a brick!"  "Thank you Wiggins,and take your flag...off you go!"

sad poem of propriety and sentiment


the last lonely man breathes the last free air.
he meets the last lonely woman and she is singing.
she is singing about clean and pure air.
she says

the air is always clean,
the air is always pure.
we are creatures in this lonely world.
we never obeyed, we always breathed.
in and out, in and out,
and we're still here, and we're still here

the last lonely man breathes the first free air.
he has awakened from his slumber and he knows
that the last lonely woman is singing the truth,
oh why did no one listen?
oh why did no one listen?

there's a voiceover with a beautiful voice.
the voiceover says
everyone was scared to get sick and die.
everyone was scared to breathe.
so everyone held their official breath
in their official space,
and everyone died of fear and suffocation,
and everyone died of fear and suffocation

the last lonely woman said nothing's true,
you're making it up again, just like before.
in truth, billions of us are living,
we're not lonely at all, we have good times,
i come back from shopping and this is what
happens.
get me out of this poem, you don't
even capitalize, what's wrong with you?
aghast, I

Although I see that it has been reported (smh.com.au)
that there is no Greendale School in Franklin Park,
NJ, as written in the upper right hand corner return
address on the envelope sent to Senator Daschle ---

    "4th  GRADE
     GREENDALE SCHOOL
     FRANKLIN PARK, NJ 08852"

--- there is very definitely a well-known (among a
certain circle), "virtual" Greendale school.

Set in the invented town of Greendale, the school
there, the "fourth" school in the town (as described
on its on-line site,
http://www.eclipse.net/~rms/grndale.html, coincidental
with "4th GRADE")

is Greendale's most important feature: ~all game
players must enroll as students in that school.~

[First, also, the address contains a second "error"
(or fiction, or "clue"): 08852 is not, strictly
speaking, the zip code for Franklin Park (08853), but
the zip code for a neighboring vicinity, Monmouth
Junction.

[Out of the billion plus web sites that Google.com
shows, there may be surprisingly few Greendale schools
proper, world-wide; quickly within the first 70 Google
listings, only the same names recur: there is a
Greendale School District and Greendale Middle School
in Greendale, WI, and Greendale Schools in Worcester,
MA, Abingdon, VA, Lawrenceburg, IN; but thereafter,
one would have to look internationally: Quebec,
Niagara Falls, CA, Wellington, NZ, a Greendale High
School in Witbank, Mpumalanga, South Africa, and a
Greendale Community School in Dublin, Ireland.]

The virtual Greendale where the school is is described
as "the site of the on-again, off-again Teenagers From
Outer Space campaign" (!).  Various web-based versions
are given, and there is a book version. The first
level of Google search shows it under the category
"Games > Roleplaying".

"Greendale sits south of a chain of respectable
mountains, which decline into gentle foothills before
flattening completely into what was recently
farmland."  It's a highly developed virtuality with
roads, restaurants, etc.

There is another interesting overlap with the events
since the 11th:

"Route 101 north heads straight into the mountains and
through them, arriving at the big City some two hours
hence (if you travel at the speed limit). To the east,
Route 972 soon takes you to the Atlantic Ocean, and
deposits you in the shore town of Seaside . . ."

Seaside Heights, NJ (known as "Seaside," locally) is
where the Thunderbird Motel is, one of the hideaways
of the WTC terrorists (Although I am having trouble
finding an on-line news report about that, it was
reported within the first week after the 11th).

-------------------------------------------------------

The creator of the virtual Greendale school posts a
little poem on his home page:

Please to remember
Eleven September --
Hijack, destruction and plot.
Our outraged reaction
To terrorist action
Should never be forgot.

------------------------------------------------------

"I made myself, and though no form have I, / Am fairer
than the fairest you can spy" --- Francis Scott Key,

Dear George and Richard

I was amused to find some reflections on our current political
situation I recently posted characterized as "right wing." I'm not
sure that "right wing" and "left wing" are terribly meaningful terms
any more, but I thought I would clarify my position for anyone
interested.  My considerations were purely practical. And I would
hate to surrender practicality to "the right wing".
If the plane you're flying in happens to be hi-jacked, it's probably
more useful to kill the hi-jackers than to speculate on the nature of
their grievances. In the case of our World Tower hijackers, they
saved us the trouble and killed themselves. But these hijackers were
just pawns in the game and this was simply a pawn sacrifice. (The
chess metaphor may be specially appropriate, since the Arabs
introduced the game into Europe.) To extend the metaphor, to play to
a win or at least to a draw we have to go after the bishops,the rooks
and the queen, and finally the king. In chess you're not offered a
choice between peace and war. Either you defeat your enemy or your
enemy defeats you. This seems to be our current situation. There is
no way of making peace with the terrorist organizations. Nothing that
the U.S. can do as a country or that its citizens can do as
individuals can create peace with them. We're not at war with a
nation or a religion.  We're dealing with a fanatical twisted segment
of the Islamic world-- sort of Pat Robertson, Jerry Falwell and
Oliver North in Arab drag. This is why changes in US diplomacy are
not relevant here. Sure it would be good to try to modify American
foreign policy in dozens of places, but no beneficial change in
American policy would affect our present enemies. Their recruits
would never learn of them or they would hear of them only through the
screen of propaganda created by their mullahs. But because this is
not a traditional war fought against a nation, it's also not obvious
that there is any reason for the prolonged bombing of Afghanistan.
Nothing the Bush people say is very credible, and it's hard to
believe that there are enough significant military targets in
Afghanistan to justify it. There are probably only two plausible
reasons for the bombing -- as domestic public relations for Bush,
because it offers visible evidence of America striking back, and as a
credible warning to Iraq, Libya, Syria etc, to keep out of it. If
there is real action against bin Laden or the Taliban, it will be
covert, while the bombers are probably killing more shepherds and
goats than bin Laden supporters or Taliban soldiers. I can imagine
reasonable people opposing the extended bombing. But I don't see any
reason why a so-called "leftist' would object to a serious ground
campaign  aimed at overthrowing the Taliban, though I don't believe
Bush will undertake it. As for Buddhism in this time, the only kind
of Buddhism that might be politically valuable now is probably Zen,
which you may remember was the religion of the Samurai.

H,
Thanks for your question. Last night at a reading here in Buffalo a local
poet , Judy Einach, announced to the assembled her candidacy as a write in
for Mayor of Buffalo. Her e-mail is jeinach@yahoo.com if you'd like to talk
to her about your wry but sometimes serious interest. She has a Masters
Degree from Harvard and considers herself practiced in community problem
solving.
     As far as preaching to the converted, I believe that poetry does provide
an important level of support. It helps to keep those same converted
refreshed and syched. If, in gathering together as poets or as an audience
these same people feel buoyed to continue their efforts at effecting timely
political change then poetry has had a positive effect. I believe it is
possible that a point of poetic view can impact a reader and create change in
thought.
   Karen

US General Odham (apologies if I have misspelt his name) has just said on
BBC Radio  (GMT 16:35 approx), in response to the suggestion that bombing of
Afghanistan should be suspended, that it is necessary "for us to proceed
with reckless abandon"

I emphasise those are his exact words and that, though abstracted, they
retain his meaning

It was pointed out that there are only a few weeks to go before winter sets
in. He replied that supplies could be taken in after the winter

But, said the interviewer, hundreds of people may die

To which the general replied that in that case it would be the taliban's
fault, and he refused to take moral responsibility

I am wondering if this is a special moral inversion and dispensation for
him, or for all those bombing Afghanistan; or perhaps it shows a recent
development in philosophy and would be an acceptable defence for those
attacking USA

The general implicitly asserted that the Afghan government has a duty to
accede to any demand the US government makes on it. Does anyone know which
of the negotiated treaties to which US still subscribes that is in; and is
it reciprocal? (Rhetorical questions)

I disassociate myself from the bombing of Afghanistan by UK government.
Those responsible should be tried for murder

Lily James

Young upstart Lily James edited the early, smart, and wild online phenom,
Postfeminist Playground; her first novel, High Drama in Fabulous Toledo,
is out this year from Fiction Collective 2. A Detroit native, born 1972,
James sprang onto the literary landscape in the FC2 anthology Chick-Lit,
followed quickly by her first collection of stories, The Great Taste of
Straight People (Black Ice Books, 1997). She joins us from her new home in
Columbia, South Carolina, to read from High Drama, a novel Cris Mazza
calls "hilarious and tragic...reverberat[ing] with questions about the
nature and place of fiction and fantasy in human experience in a parody
and exaggeration of that ultimate oxymoron: realistic fiction."

Lynne Tillman has postponed her SPT reading as she prefers to stay in NYC
at this time.

$5-10 sliding scale, free to SPT members and the CCAC community. No one

I wanted to make a poem which makes no sense at all, even to the extent of
violating the rules of syntax & grammar (it is easy to make nonsense poems
where you write "normal" sentyences with funny nouns where the nouns belong,
funny verbs where the verbs belong, etc., but I wanted to bend langugae
maore than that...)  As I reread, I realize that I was mostly unsuccessful
in wroting true nonsense in the sense.  Can anyone give examples of poems
that break away from grammar (a lot of LANGUAGE poetry does this.  I'm
thinking of Jackson Mac Low's twenties series which used nouns and verbs
with no apparent sentence structure.

'THE CALL':

December 1999 & July 2001

We invited/invite open letters to poets, from poets -- addressed across =
generations, aesthetic tendencies, communities, political boundaries. =
Letters received will be forwarded to the poets addressed; addressees =
will have a chance to reply and be included in 'open letter' _Open =
Letter_. We will consider publishing letters and responses, letters that =
do not receive responses, and also poetry which brings out a particular =
juncture of debate.

We are interested in complicating given literary lineages, in =
overturning abstract categorizations of poets' methods and =
socio-aesthetic formations, in rediscovering and questioning received =
critical formulae concerning a poet's work or milieu, and in bringing =
about new close and historical readings and critiques. We want to =
emphasize the dialogic, analytical, and constructivist possibilities of =
address to and between poets by means of the open letter's form of =
public intimacy.

Our intent is to complicate how kinds of poetic 'positions' articulate =
themselves, and are articulated and perceived as available and =
'occupied' in contemporary poetries -- as aesthetic tendency, method, =
point of group identification, etc.

A willful return to a dated technology, but a return that harkens to =
founding motives of _Open Letter_: the open letter. These issues add to =
the current forums and formats of poetic discussion available, including =
the Buffalo poetics listserv (and _Poetics@_, its recent anthology), the =
_PhillyTalks_ newsletter (poets in dialogue), the question/answer model =
of _99 Poets_ (and its predecessors back to =
_L=3DA=3DN=3DG=3DU=3DA=3DG=3DE_), the poet's talk (as collected in =
_Writing/Talks_), and the poet's essay (from _Curriculum of the Soul_ to =
_Poetics Journal_, _Tripwire_ or _Shark_).



THE 'OPEN LETTER' OPEN LETTER ISSUES

Project Openview:

_Open Letter_'s Eleventh Series, numbers 3 and 4 will feature a =
selection of letters we received since sending out a call for letters =
to/from poets in December 1999.

These two 'open letter' issues of Open Letter will be put online by late =
Fall 2001 (TBA). They may be downloadable as free PDF files by =
author-name using (free) Adobe software. A link for the 'open letter' =
online site will be made at _Open Letter_: =
http://www.arts.uwo.ca/openlet/home.htm.



CALL FOR OPEN LETTERS / RESPONSES:

For the first ten months that the 'open letter' issues will be available =
online, we will be accepting new open letters, as well as new responses =
to the existing letters, for prompt online publication.

Contact us to receive online notification, or with queries about this =
online, time-based project.

>"Over time, the penis has been deified, demonized, secularized, racialized,

>enormous amount of material. In the Greek and Roman worlds, statues of figures
>with erections were commonplace, he observes, though by the Christian era, the
>penis had become a source of evil and weakness. Doctors and scientists from da

>organ
>sometimes with untoward results, as when American "semen science" led to the
>creation of antimasturbation products such as Graham crackers. Western man's
>fear of the African phallus undergirded colonialism and slavery, and resonates
>to this day, Friedman argues, as was evident in the case of Clarence Thomas.
>If
>some of Freud's case histories might be questioned, Friedman notes how the
>psychoanalytic interpretation enduringly places the penis and associated
>anxieties at the fulcrum of society. The rise of feminism put the penis in its

>in
>moving women to orgasm, and as Andrea Dworkin exposed penile pathology though
>the author concludes that male sexuality arises more out of evolutionary
>strategy than misogyny. His final and liveliest chapter concerns the
>medicalization of the penis, culminating in Viagra. Even though Friedman
>quotes
>a (female) sex therapist on the limits of such drugs, he concludes
>optimistically that "the erection industry" has performed a paradigm shift,
>allowing man to impose his will below his belt. The book has a few gaps --
>there's little about the gay penis -- but it should reign as the seminal
>treatment of this topic (and inspire many more puns).

>An impressively research-prone journalist who has written for Esquire, Rolling
>Stone, and the Village Voice, Friedman has prepared a catalog of happenings

>horrors perpetrated on the penis or in the name of the penis as an organ and

>is a book that gives context to the central role of the penis in Western
>civilization.
>
>A man can hold his manhood in his hand, but who is really gripping whom? Is
>the
>penis the best in man -- or the beast? How is man supposed to use it? And when
>does that use become abuse? Of all the bodily organs, only the penis forces
>man
>to confront such contradictions: something insistent yet reluctant, a tool
>that
>creates but also destroys, a part of the body that often seems apart from the
>body. This is the conundrum that makes the penis both hero and villain in a
>drama that shapes every man -- and mankind along with it.
>
>In A Mind of Its Own, David M. Friedman shows that the penis is more than a
>body part. It is an idea, a conceptual but flesh-and-blood measuring stick of
>man's place in the world. That men have a penis is a scientific fact; how they
>think about it, feel about it, and use it is not. It is possible to identify
>the key moments in Western history when a new idea of the penis addressed the
>larger mystery of man's relationship with it and changed forever the way that
>organ was conceived of and put to use. A Mind of Its Own brilliantly distills
>this complex and largely unexamined story.
>
>Deified by the pagan cultures of the ancient world and demonized by the early
>Roman church, the organ was later secularized by pioneering anatomists such as
>Leonardo da Vinci. After being measured "scientifically" in an effort to
>subjugate some races while elevating others, the organ was psychoanalyzed by
>Sigmund Freud. As a result, the penis assumed a paradigmatic role in
>psychology -- whether the patient was equipped with the organ or envied those
>who were. Now, after being politicized by feminism and exploited in countless
>ways by pop culture, the penis has been medicalized. As no one has before him,

>more than a health or business story. It is the latest -- and perhaps final --
>chapter in one of the longest sagas in human history: the story of man's

        I would like to offer support for Karen's efforts in assembling Buffalo
poets to help support and comfort all involved. It seems that the
performance is a very different animal than the act of reading. To perform a
poem one brings certain qualities to the poem similar to that of an actor
taking on a part. Where reading is the realm of the reader. In a group
activity, such as the Red Cross reading Karen brought together,
sentimentality has a rightful place. It was at Rust belt books where the
avant garde mixed well with house wife poems - but all were pure -- in
Pound's notion of "only emotion endures". Even the old beatniks still
kicking around in dirty hair and faded blue jeans brought a level of feeling
beyond their usual sullen attitudes. The audience understood in ways
differently than if it was only a reading of one style of poem. Politics are
of people and when people gather, being moved by poetry, politics becomes
poetry.

        Best, Geoffrey

H,
Thanks for your question. Last night at a reading here in Buffalo a local
poet , Judy Einach, announced to the assembled her candidacy as a write in
for Mayor of Buffalo. Her e-mail is jeinach@yahoo.com if you'd like to talk
to her about your wry but sometimes serious interest. She has a Masters
Degree from Harvard and considers herself practiced in community problem
solving.
     As far as preaching to the converted, I believe that poetry does
provide
an important level of support. It helps to keep those same converted
refreshed and syched. If, in gathering together as poets or as an audience
these same people feel buoyed to continue their efforts at effecting timely
political change then poetry has had a positive effect. I believe it is
possible that a point of poetic view can impact a reader and create change
in
thought.
   Karen

        Alan,

        I love this poem. Thanks for sending it. Plus, the CD work is great. Your
video's are great. The transitions of the spider to selves and back again
only inverted is great. Plus, the black and white with the words haunting
the scene is very effective. So anti commercial (where we are used to having
big words in such settings) defying to be read but its presence gives a
truer meaning, a feeling of text, the presence like a ghost in and out.
Great work and thanks for sending them. I am feeling better, it seems that
the flu took all of my bad feeling out with it. Way to go white blood cells!

        Best, Geoffrey

sad poem of propriety and sentiment


the last lonely man breathes the last free air.
he meets the last lonely woman and she is singing.
she is singing about clean and pure air.
she says

the air is always clean,
the air is always pure.
we are creatures in this lonely world.
we never obeyed, we always breathed.
in and out, in and out,
and we're still here, and we're still here

the last lonely man breathes the first free air.
he has awakened from his slumber and he knows
that the last lonely woman is singing the truth,
oh why did no one listen?
oh why did no one listen?

there's a voiceover with a beautiful voice.
the voiceover says
everyone was scared to get sick and die.
everyone was scared to breathe.
so everyone held their official breath
in their official space,
and everyone died of fear and suffocation,
and everyone died of fear and suffocation

the last lonely woman said nothing's true,
you're making it up again, just like before.
in truth, billions of us are living,
we're not lonely at all, we have good times,
i come back from shopping and this is what
happens.
get me out of this poem, you don't
even capitalize, what's wrong with you?
aghast, I

David. If your vision, so to speak, is true, whatever that is, then this war
will never end! Because as you excise one "lot" of terrorists, another take
there place! There are endless circles and levels of terrorists - and while
it sems, if we can believe the crap coming from the US-Military mullahs -
that the extreme Muslims are very dangerous, even insane...wel, the same was
said of Suddam Hussein: he is actually one of the few to have said anything
rational about the situation by the way...how is this war suddenly different
o someradical way than the Vietnam: I see it as a continuation (in some
respects) of Christianity versus Moslemism: NOT democracy or progress versus
"evil". Moslem has conveniently replacede Communist or Communism (which the
US have dropped as it might upset China one of their "allies")...no right
wing is VERY relevant: right wingers are usually cowards. It would take more
than a coupole of buildings liquefied to unnerve me...look, I spoke to at
least two Englishmaen over here the day after S11 and they were quite calm
about it...both used to bombs going off in London: both seeing that the
billions spent by the US on so called "defence" were useless and always will
be.
   What about countries where such bombings occur daily? The reality is that
the US and other nations, rather than this pathetic and pretty gutless
attack on one of the weakest and poorest nations in the world, needs to look
to its own backyard where there are millions of homeles, and many many who
have low incomes, poverty, suicide, and many of those working class people
are Muslims or from the East and are maybe right now thinking (in between
Chess games)..."now this is going to be even more exciting than a Chess game
when I'm in time trouble and have just about pulled of smothered mate...aha,
I must start dreamiong up ways to "beat the system"!!...after allif Timothy
McVeigh could bring down a big building with som fertiliser an US Army
training, then what can I do?"  If you want terrorism: the reason they
stoped a rugby match over here  in Hamilton 1981 was because there was a
plane heading for the football stadium, with the possiblility that the pilot
(who'd been in South Africa as a "flying doctor" and was an expert pilot)
"might" plough into the stadium: the protestors meanwhile went onto the
field (protest against Apartheid) and then when the  game was stopped they
were attacked a re attacked: the cry of the local "rednecks" was "Jews!"
"Blacks!" "Communists" (nowadays they might add "Muslims!")...so that in
little old New Zealand....(and some were beaten half to death)...
  OK I can see that you want to stop a certain kind of extremism: but you
yourself have said it...its not possible to localise it. Its not IN
Afgahnistan: its everywhere. And these guys arent scared: many are motivated
because they believe (possibly wrongly) that the ends justify the means:
that's what you have to dispprove. The end maybe that capitalism is
transformed toward socialism, that revenge for atrocities (real or imagined
it doesnt matter) done or initiated by the US or "The West", or they are
just religious nut cases who believe Allah has told them that the US is
corrupt...but a war isnt going to convince those guys, there everywhere!!
For every situation there's a psychopath being born right now somewhere in
the world. Believe me: have faith...
  But as to Chess: Chess is a finite game and in fact many many games (often
very exciting ones) end in a draw...I know because I've been playing the
game for years. There are times when the Queen (A few New Yorks? The actual
English Queen?) are sacrificed to obtain a win: A Better World? Or What?
Chaos? Some people believe in chaos... Regards, Richard.

No writing makes no sense at all: if it is written by a "Langpo) then by
his/her very act of composing in a particular way, meaning is generated. I
see it as writing moving between very strict and grammatically and
syntactically "correct" posems to poems more or less dislocated.... a
parallel would be with the concept of entropy: in telecommunication theory
the gretest amount of information is conveyed in direct proportion as there
is greater entropy (disorder)...but obviously something that is absolutely
so orderd (low entropy) that we can virtually predict what it says before
its said is hence "meaningless", so of course is white noise (a
theoretically completely random system)....
  An example is a Steve McCaffery poem which is "exploded" all over the
page. But in the context of what McCaffery is doing or "saying" even that is
meaning ful (if not "grammatical" and certainly useless for communicating
outside of the medium he is was using)....But that's my penny worth: Charles
Bernstein and guys like that have a greater knowledge of these things...I
think what you maybe striving for is similar to the concept of Mallarme who
wanted poetry to approximate to the condition of music...I think Laura
Riding had some ideas on this as well.
  An interesting "example" is in Ashbery's "House Boat Days"  (The Nut Brown
Maid which was written by his using fragments from older poems)...but he
maintains the "grammatical flow so to speak"....A fascinating poem is
"Polaroid" by Clark Coolidge in which he uses..read it - I cant explain it -
its fascinating: also a strange and fascinating book is "After Images " by
Joan Retallack. I like it: but for me its the kind of challenging thing
which I admire but cant understand! (Like Finnegan's Wake which I admire but
have never read!).That may not matter: the thing is that one is comforted so
to speak that Retallack knew why and what she was writing which I cant
always claim...!
 But there are many others, as I have no doubt others on this List will have
a greater awareness than I. MacLow is an intriguing guy who was a good
friend of John Cage of course...Oh, and another writer a bit in your ilk is
Tom Raworth........Trakl the German poet or something quite different is
interesting: ask Scott Hamilton; he's read every thing (!)
   Your poem is fascinating. Send more.   I like it: has an element of
humour and also torques the language so that it "talks" as should all good
and intriguing poetry. Regards, Richard. PS it reminded me of an interview
over here with a big strong young All Black (rugby player) who was (almost
coquettishly) "not big on spiders"!

David. I realised here that I equated "Right Wing" with cowards and I didnt
mean to imply you or any one I was talking about the concept of there being
a Right Wing (if is IS useful)...and I was being a bit rhetorical when I
said "it would take more than a few towers blown up etc"...of course I can
see the US's point re this: its what worries me.  I'm not in favour of
religious nut cases of any persuasion so if your argument was stronger for
me I'd be all for a military response but dont see that situation there yet.
But I didnt mean to offend anyone....I can be as big a "coward", all things
being equal as they say,  as the next guy. Regards, Richard.

david,
     I agree with your comment about left and right wing at present.  They
are no more meaningful here than liberal and conservative were during the
Vietnam years. The problem then as I recall the experience was that
'radicalization' as alternative too easily lent itself to violence.  Binary
thinking does seem to be the problem here, particularly as it grows out of
rational, cartesian modernism.  While postmodernism and langpo have made
heaadway in made big inroads in underlingthe problems in 'the old world - at
least Western - order' they do not provide viable new paths.  There is an
article in the latest _American Psychologist however by Ken Gergen that
might be of interest here - "In effect, all that has heretofore been defined
as private and separated from the other is instead conceptualized as
inherently relational - inseparable from communal activity" (quote from his
_An invitation to social construction, 1999).  Even though he does have a
social construction bias this is consonant with my reading of much of your
work.

THE DAY THE WORLD CAME TO ITS SENSES?
By Bill Moore
Last in four part series of editorials on September 11th tragedy
EVWorld
October 07,2001

http://evworld.com/databases/storybuilder.cfm?storyid=245

This week, Phil Watts, the chairman of Royal Dutch Shell, gave a remarkable
speech in New York, just three weeks after the tragedy of September 11th.

Accustomed to making and approving business decisions and technology plans
that extend decades into the future, Watts told an audience assembled under
the auspices of the United Nations Development Program, that Shell, one of
the largest oil companies in the world, was preparing for the "End of the
Hydrocarbon Age."

He painted two possible scenarios he termed, "Dynamics as Usual" and "The
Spirit of the Coming Age."

Under the first scenario, Shell envisions an "evolutionary" carbon shift
from coal to natural gas to renewables. Petroleum's current 40 percent
global energy share will drop to 25 percent by 2050. Natural gas market
share will climb to 20 percent while the remainder will come from a
combination of nuclear and various renewable sources.

Under "The Spirit of the Coming Age" scenario, the world would experience a
far more dramatic shift from carbon-intensive fuels to hydrogen. Watt's
stated this second scenario, "explores something rather more revolutionary,
the potential for a truly hydrogen economy, growing out of new and exciting
developments in fuel cells, advanced hydrocarbon technologies and carbon
dioxide sequestration."

Watts envisioned fuel cells beginning to reach serious market penetration by
2025 and as a result dramatically altering the energy landscape long before
oil becomes scarce.

Watts isn't just talking the talk. He has pledged to walk the walk by
committing between $500 million and $1 billion over the next five years to
develop new energy businesses, concentrating primarily on solar and wind
energy.

Watts concluded his remarks by saying that oil companies can no longer
assume they will dominate the next 100 years as they have the previous
century. "That would be a very complacent view."

Phil Watt's comments in New York this week are truly remarkable in the light
of the events on and after September 11, 2001. Here is a major oil company
executive publicly stating that the world is changing and his company plans
to lead in this transition. He pointed out that not only does he intend to
make Shell "a prime mover in this transitional period" but he also noted
that "one in five of the world's population does not have access to
commercial energy. It is our goal to contribute to the development of an
affordable, sustainable energy system which will help reduce this sort of
inequality."

It is encouraging to hear someone of Watt's stature and influence
recognizing the need to address global inequalities like this, for these are
the true causes of social unrest that can ultimately lead to the use of the
weapon of terrorism. Phil Watts recognizes the world is changing and the
events of last month only underscore that reality. The real question is how
will it change?

To extend the metaphor, to play to
| a win or at least to a draw we have to go after the bishops,the rooks
| and the queen, and finally the king. In chess you're not offered a
| choice between peace and war. Either you defeat your enemy or your
| enemy defeats you. This seems to be our current situation.

It really doesn't look like that to me.

For a start the identity of the enemy isn't clear. For another, the current
action is likely to increase the number of recruits to the ill-defined
enemy. Chess is a poor metaphor.

 There is
| no way of making peace with the terrorist organizations.

That's not what the US has said in Macedonia, Bosnia and Ireland.

| But I don't see any
| reason why a so-called "leftist' would object to a serious ground
| campaign  aimed at overthrowing the Taliban, though I don't believe
| Bush will undertake it.

I still don't know what a leftist is, so a so-called leftist could, for me,
be anything; but I do have an objection against overthrowing the present
government of Afghanistan; and that is that it isn't in the US or the UK. It
isn't "our" business

The situation is largely of the west's creation; and evidence from other
places in the world where the west has practised a little political
engineering, usually to solve a problem it created, backing for the UCK in
Jugoslavia, for instance, has shown that one mess is replaced by another,
killing people along the way

If the USAUK is so concerned about people being terorised, why is it in
alliance with the destructor of Chechnia? If it is so concerned about
democracy and other rights in Afghanistan, why is it in alliance with Saudi
Arabia?

When there's a riot or some other disruption, it is quite common for people
to hop out and loot a tv or a fridge; and it is not unusual that they'll
explain what they did in political terms rather than admitting to
opportunistic theft. It seems to me that Bush and Blair are looting the
grief arising from Sep 11 to do something that has been on the wish list for
a while

This is an arms and oil game; and the people being killed are not pawns
being lost in a game of chess but fireworks turning into dust at a rich
persons' party

all the best

Andrea,
     Thanks for sending a copy of your paper.  I'm still digesting it, =
but was struck by one phrase that realy hit me:  "we must first =
recognize that grief is as ideological as dying."  I think that that =
occurence is one that poets can do something about.  we have seen =
terror, grief, fear, etc. turned into soundbites and now commercials, =
etc.  If we let grief become ideological we have lost the battle if not =
the war.

Silence of 4 Terror Probe Suspects Poses Dilemma

By Walter Pincus
Washington Post Staff Writer
Sunday, October 21, 2001; Page A06


FBI and Justice Department investigators are increasingly frustrated
by the silence of jailed suspected associates of Osama bin Laden's al
Qaeda network, and some are beginning to that say that traditional
civil liberties may have to be cast aside if they are to extract
information about the Sept. 11 attacks and terrorist plans.

More than 150 people rounded up by law enforcement officials in the
aftermath of the attacks remain in custody, but attention has focused
on four suspects held in New York who the FBI believes are
withholding valuable information.

FBI agents have offered the suspects the prospect of lighter
sentences, money, jobs, and a new identity and life in the United
States for them and their family members, but they have not succeeded
in getting information from them, according to law enforcement
sources.

"We're into this thing for 35 days and nobody is talking," a senior
FBI official said, adding that "frustration has begun to appear."

Said one experienced FBI agent involved in the investigation: "We are
known for humanitarian treatment, so basically we are stuck. . . .
Usually there is some incentive, some angle to play, what you can do
for them. But it could get to that spot where we could go to
pressure . . . where we won't have a choice, and we are probably
getting there."

Among the alternative strategies under discussion are using drugs or
pressure tactics, such as those employed occasionally by Israeli
interrogators, to extract information. Another idea is extraditing
the suspects to allied countries where security services sometimes
employ threats to family members or resort to torture.

Under U.S. law, interrogators in criminal cases can lie to suspects,
but information obtained by physical pressure, inhumane treatment or
torture cannot be used in a trial. In addition, the government
interrogators who used such tactics could be sued by the victim or
charged with battery by the government.

The four key suspects, held in New York's Metropolitan Correctional
Center, are Zacarias Moussaoui, a French Moroccan detained in August
initially in Minnesota after he sought lessons on how to fly
commercial jetliners but not how to take off or land them; Mohammed
Jaweed Azmath and Ayub Ali Khan, Indians traveling with false
passports who were detained the day after the World Trade Center and
Pentagon attacks with box cutters, hair dye and $5,000 in cash; and
Nabil Almarabh, a former Boston cabdriver with alleged links to al
Qaeda.

Questioning of "the two with the box cutters and others have left us
wondering what's the next phase," the FBI official said.

One former senior FBI official with a background in counterterrorism
said recently, "You can't torture, you can't give drugs now, and
there is logic, reason and humanity to back that." But, he
added, "you could reach a point where they allow us to apply drugs to
a guy. . . . But I don't think this country would ever permit
torture, or beatings."

He said there was a difference in employing a "truth serum," such as
sodium pentothal, "to try to get critical information when facing
disaster, and beating a guy till he is senseless."

"If there is another major attack on U.S. soil, the American public
could let it happen," he said. "Drugs might taint a prosecution, but
it might be worth it."

Even some people who are firm supporters of civil liberties
understand the pressures that are developing.

David Cole, a professor at Georgetown University Law Center who
obtained the release of Middle Eastern clients after they had been
detained for years based on secret information, said that in the
current crisis, "the use of force to extract information could
happen" in cases where investigators believe suspects have
information on an upcoming attack.

"If there is a ticking bomb, it is not an easy issue, it's tough," he
said.

Kenneth W. Starr, the independent counsel during the Clinton
administration, wrote recently that the Supreme Court distinguished
terrorism cases from cases where lesser threats are involved. He
noted that five justices in a recent deportation case recognized that
the "genuine danger" represented by terrorism requires "heightened
deference to the judgments of the political branches with respect to
matters of national security."

Former attorney general Richard L. Thornburgh said, "We put emphasis
on due process and sometimes it strangles us."

In the aftermath of Sept. 11, he said, "legally admissible evidence
in court may not be the be-all and end-all." The country may compare
the current search for information to brutal tactics in wartime used
to gather intelligence overseas and even by U.S. troops from
prisoners during military actions.

Extradition of Moussaoui to France or Morocco is a possibility, one
law enforcement official said. The French security services were
quick to leak to journalists in Paris that they had warned the CIA
and FBI in early September, before the attacks, that Moussaoui was
associated with al Qaeda and had pilot training.

The leak has irritated U.S. investigators in part because "it was so
limited," one FBI official said. "Maybe we should give him
[Moussaoui] to them," he said, noting that French security has a
reputation for rough interrogations.

The threat of extradition to a country with harsh practices does not
always work.

In 1997, Hani Abdel Rahim al-Sayegh, a Saudi citizen arrested in
Canada and transferred to the United States under the promise that he
would tell about the bombing of the Khobar Towers military barracks
in Saudi Arabia, refused to cooperate in the investigation when he
got here.

The FBI threatened to have al-Sayegh sent back to Saudi Arabia, where
he could have faced beheading, thinking it would get him to talk. "He
called their bluff and went back, was not executed and is in jail," a
government official said.

Robert M. Blitzer, former chief of the FBI counterterrorism section,
said offers of reduced sentences worked to get testimony in the cases
of Ahmed Ressam, caught bringing explosives into the country for
millennium attacks that never took place, and Ali Mohammed, the
former U.S. Army Green Beret who pleaded guilty in the 1998 embassy
bombings and provided valuable information about al Qaeda.

The two former al Qaeda members who testified publicly in the 1998
bombing trials were resettled with their families in the United
States under the witness protection program and given either money or
loans to restart their lives.

Torture "goes against every grain in my body," Blitzer said. "Chances
are you are going to get the wrong person and risk damage or killing
them." In the end, he said, there has to be another way.

Hi all,

Thought I'd let you know that my new book, _Morning Constitutional_ is now
availble through Small Press Distribution (www.spdbooks.org) - they have a
photo of the cover etc.  I've reposted the Handwritten Press Announcement
below.

New from HANDWRITTEN PRESS

MORNING CONSTITUTIONAL, by Michael Magee

Place -- under arrest, outside the Ben Franklin House, a bit of
declarative
rhetoric echoing past the old psych ward, a decaying neighborhood, jazz
struggling, the Amerinesiac that must needs awaken and feel its limbs.
"The untimely state's AM radio" getting played here, detuned and refracted
through Magee's acute sense of history and hearing.  Here that?  Michael
Magee's poetry, "buzzes with the legislative, polemical and liberatory
static of American political history" (K. Silem Mohammed).  This buzzing
refracts to us from the highway to the needle exchange, the monument to
the bus stop.  Magee is one of the most well-informed American
poet-listeners. Bob Perelman says "his poems sound out the present tense
histories and provide democratic key signatures so different people can
play their meanings at once.  We hear about a better place -- all the
time, if we listen.  But getting there is not an automatic thing.  These
poems help." Or as Heather Fuller writes, "This is not your ordinary
peripateticism. For what Michael has tapped into is the psychotic tyranny
of the antecedent, in which everything is thing, everyone is they, and all
else is it, and this is how it is."

"a high fidelity
version of me staple-gunned"

88 pp. perfect bound, cover art by Mitchell Magee, $10.95.

A curious review of Kennings 8 & 10 in an Ohio indie-rock / small-press
e-zine.  http://www.splendidezine.com/departments/&/kenning810.html

For the real deal on Mohammad's _hovercraft_, I'd recommend Maria Damon's
review in XCP: Cross-Cultural Poetics #8.

In the meantime, OFTEN (Kenning #11) is still available from SPD
(www.spdbooks.org) - a collaborative theatrical work by Barbara Guest and
Kevin Killian.

The forthcoming issue of Kenning will be an audio edition to appear on a
double-CD, and will feature recordings of / by Anne-Marie Albiach, Amiri
Baraka, Lauren Gudath & Jay Schwartz, Andrew Levy & Gerry Hemingway,
Nathaniel Mackey, Eileen Myles, Rodrigo Toscano, a new studio recording of
Leslie Scalapino reading the entirety of her book-length poem WAY, and many
other features, sonic and graphic.  SPD will carry this, but ask your local
bookseller to carry Kenning - that'd help.

This WEDNESDAY at the SCARAB CLUB in DETROIT

from New York: ELENI SIKELIANOS and LAIRD HUNT

from San Francisco via Detroit: CARLA HARRYMAN

*****

ELENI SIKELIANOS

Eleni Sikelianos's Earliest Worlds (Coach House Press) weds innovative
technique with time-honored poetic tropes of individual and cosmos.
Sikelianos has said, "I am interested in the absolute ferocity of poetry,
in our wild, eccentric human selves, our animal and mineral planet,
untainted by, but interacting with, socializing forces." She is the author
of The Book of Tendons, The Lover's Numbers, and To Speak While Dreaming,
and is the recipient of numerous awards, including a National Endowment for
the Arts Fellowship. New York poet Barbara Guest has written of her work,
"She directs us, via surprise in each line, to return to the unconscious,
to the fierce, absolute sign, out of whose nourishing hand her poetry
advances."

LAIRD HUNT

Laird Hunt, former press officer for the United Nations and New York
correspondent for Mouth-to-Mouth Magazine, will read from his debut novel,
The Impossibly (Coach House Press). "When the anonymous narrator botches an
assignment from the clandestine organization that employs him, everyone in
his life becomes a participant in his punishment. Hunt's impressive debut
is a smart, funny noir filled with deadpan delivery and a sly eye for
detail. This is a story of a man lost out of his mind in a complex,
faulty-memory-driven world of dark absurdity."

CARLA HARRYMAN

Gardener of Stars, Carla Harryman's eleventh book, is an experimental novel
that explores the paradise and wasteland of utopian desire. Other works by
Harryman include two volumes of selected writing, There Never Was a Rose
Without a Thorn; Animal Instincts: Prose, Essays, and Plays; a hybrid
novel, The Words After Carl Sandburg's Rootabaga Stories and Jean-Paul
Sartre; and a book-length dramatic work, Memory Play. Her most recent play,
Objects Stationed on Platform in the Sub (Urban) World, premiered last year
at Oxford Brookes University and will be staged in San Francisco, Detroit,
and New York in 2002-2003. The Village Voice called her work "intelligent,
sardonic, and elliptical to the point of delirium."

Vicinities

Lisa Lubasch


In Vicinities, her follow-up to How Many More of Them Are You? (Avec =
Books
1999, winner of the Norma Farber First Book Award), Lisa Lubasch
illuminates a myriad of landscapes and narratives. In some poems, she
magnifies and elevates subjects ranging from the swooping flight of a =
bird
to the approach of a werewolf to a fallen angel's climb "back into =
unlife"
with winning precision. In other poems, she plumbs the ever-changing
knowledge "I" has of "you" with far-reaching intelligence and foresight.
Throughout, her personal voice grounds cascading turns of phrase, =
flights
of imagination, and philosophically informed dramatic outbursts. =
Redolent
with the timeless excitement of true intellectual discovery, this book
gives us a spiritual education in the guise of a linguistic feast.

elizabeth,

>>Who would you choose?<<
don't know too many poets. & can't think of many (hence my initial question)
who'd take much action beyond political poetry or speaking out much less run
for office. unsure i could make that sacrifice either.

anne waldman might make a fine senator.

APOLOGIES FOR CROSS-POSTING

The svp website is moving with immediate effect to

http://pages.britishlibrary.net/svp/

It is perhaps primarily of interest to those attending readings and other
events in London; but there is a great deal of information there which has a
wider application, including biographical notes, which are updated at the
poets' request, and texts of reviews and introductions

Please update your address books, links pages, listings etc

The whole thing has been transferred and should be as ok as it was before
immediately (to be improved).

However, that had not been perfect recently; and there are a number of
additions and restorations which, though they work offline, have not been
tested online due to further outages at crosswinds (where the website used
to be)

PLEASE REPORT ANY BUGS YOU DISCOVER (For instance, the gratuitous Tenniel
rabbit was refusing to appear a few minutes ago despite offers of electronic
lettuce). They will be dealt with ASAP.

It is anticipated that the new location will be more reliable than previous
locations. The lack of advertisements should be a relief

Speaking of which, the next reading at SVP, the sexy and desirable poetry
event where it is essential to be seen, is Tuesday 30th October 2001 when
Tony Lopez reads

Tony Lopez has been active as a poet since the 1970s, publications include
_Devolution_ (The Figures, 2000), _Data Shadow_ (Reality Street, 2000),
_False Memory_ (The Figures, 2000), _Negative Equity_ (Equipage, 1995), and
_Stress Management_ (Boldface, 1994).

His poetry is represented in major anthologies such as _Twentieth Century
British and Irish Poetry_ ( Oxford University Press, New York, 2001),
_Other: British and Irish Poetry since 1970_ (Wesleyan, USA, 1999) and
_Conductors of Chaos_ (Picador, UK, 1996).

His critical writing includes _The Poetry of W S Graham_ (Edinburgh
University Press, 1989, Society of Authors Blundell Award, 1990) and, more
recently, essays on David Antin, John Ashbery, Steve Benson, Ted Berrigan,
Andrew Crozier, Lee Harwood, J H Prynne, Ezra Pound, Tom Raworth and Denise
Riley.

He lives in Devon and teaches at the University of Plymouth.

"In any of these stanzas language emits the toxic glow of an intertextuality
for which a functioning media awareness is its sufficient context . . . from
the start this writing anticipates the postmodern as a future condition of
the person"

Andrew Crozier on False Memory in JACKET 11

"Tony Lopez's poetry is a structure of feeling of our displaced present.
Like any good student of British culture, he has a healthy suspicion of the
aesthetic. But art is still his vehicle of choice. He is riding it past a
windmill operated by a multinational conglomerate. The landscape is
familiar, though everything in it has entirely changed."

Barrett Watten, cover note for Devolution

"I had been waiting for this poetry a long time, a poetry politically
relevant and at the same time unapologetic in its confidence. These works
are completely current, and history will welcome them again and again."

David Bromige, cover note for Devolution

"It is as if Baudrillard had penetrated far more deeply into our lives than
we had imagined."

Douglas Oliver, on When You Wish from Stress Management

Sub Voicive Poetry, Betsey Trotwood, Farringdon Road, London E C 1, opposite
but not connected with The Guardian. Shepherd Neame beer. Electric light.

hi again karen. thanks for letting me know about judy einach - it's exactly
the kind of thing i'm interested in hearing about.

>>I believe that poetry does provide an important level of support. It helps
to keep those same converted refreshed and syched. If, in gathering together
as poets or as an audience these same people feel buoyed to continue their
efforts at effecting timely political change then poetry has had a positive
effect. I believe it is possible that a point of poetic view can impact a
reader and create change in thought.<<

while i agree with you on all points, i'm increasingly feeling a sense of
political urgency & would like to hear of more broad/progressive/innovative
action. maybe to many of us these days few things seem to do enough.

thanks,
hassen

CALENDAR OF EVENTS


24    JO ANN WASSERMAN AND SHARAN STRANGE
JO ANN WASSERMAN is a former Poetry Project Program Coordinator who has
recently returned to New York City from San Francisco where she was a
student at the New College of California. Author of two chapbooks-What
Counts As Proof and We Build Mountains-she has recently completed a

Museum in New York and the Institute of Contemporary Art in Boston. Yusef
Komunyakaa writes, "Ash embodies a voice we can count on, informed by the
grace and wit of the South. [...] Ash traces that alchemy by which the life
stories of those around us are transmuted into our own." [8:00 P.M.]

26    LANGUAGE ART - TALK THAT TALK: POETS READ AND PERFORM
LLOYD ROBSON, EISA DAVIS, PATRICK KOSIEWICZ, GRIFFIN HANSBURY, MARCO
VILLALOBOS, and BASSEY IKPI. A night of "round-robin" style reading from a
fascinatingly diverse group of writer/performers. LLOYD ROBSON's books
include: City & Poems, Edge Territory (photographs and poems), and Letter
from Sissi. City & Poems was included in The Independent Newspapers Best
Books of 1996 (Cardiff, Wales). Nigerian-born BASSEY IKPI, a regular on the
NYC slam circuit, is a member of Team Union Square 2K1 and the current NY
Def Poetry Jam representative. MARCO VILLALOBOS is poetry editor for

p.m.]

29    POM POM: POETRY JOURNAL
Pom Pom, a brand spankin' new journal for poetry that seeks to foster a
poetic polylogue by printing poems that talk with one another. For the debut
issue, the editors sought poems from poets willing to have their work
responded to, altered, lifted, plagiarized, or transformed. In subsequent
issues the magazine promises work that flirts with, stomps on, folds up,
bosses around, takes liberties with, and generally engages with poems in
previous issues. Readers this evening are CHRIS JACKSON, NASHVILLE; JENN
MCCREARY, PHILADELPHIA; CAROL MIRAKOVE, BROOKLYN; C.E. PUTNAM, SEATTLE;
DEBORAH RICHARDS, PHILADELPHIA; and GARY SULLIVAN, Brooklyn; as well as the
editors: ALLISON COBB; JEN COLEMAN; ETHAN FUGATE; SUSAN LANDERS. [8:00 P.M.]

seniors, and $3 for Poetry Project members. Schedule is subject to change.

<snip>
My considerations were purely practical.
<snip>

No. They seem to be metaphorical. See below.

<snip>
If the plane you're flying in happens to be hi-jacked, it's probably
more useful to kill the hi-jackers than to speculate on the nature of
their grievances.
<snip>

This is a defence of wilful ignorance. A closer analogy with what is
happening is that having equipped yourself with a large gun, your
'constitutional right', you now kill your fellow passengers because you're
angry at being hijacked, running the risk that you puncture the plane's
metal skin in the process.

<snip>
In the case of our World Tower hijackers, they saved us the trouble and
killed themselves. But these hijackers were just pawns in the game and this
was simply a pawn sacrifice. (The chess metaphor may be specially
appropriate, since the Arabs introduced the game into Europe.)
<snip>

'...saved us the trouble...', 'simply a pawn sacrifice'? These expressions
diminish the seriousness of the situation and induce a sense of
disengagement, returning us to the point at which the deaths of 5,000+
people seemed like a disaster movie viewed by leisured spectators.

The Arabs introduced the *game*. In recent years the *metaphor* has been
used (Cf its obsessional deployment during the war over Kosovo/a) to
decorate rather primitive command-and-control models of much more complex
events. So here.

In an earlier era the metaphor was 'dominoes', of course. Let's be
'practical', not antiquarian.

<snip>
To extend the metaphor, to play to a win or at least to a draw we have to go
after the bishops, the rooks and the queen, and finally the king.
<snip>

But the metaphor is hopelessly flawed from the outset. What about other
metaphors? Cutting the heads of Hydras? Sowing dragons' teeth?

<snip>
Either you defeat your enemy or your enemy defeats you.
<snip>

These aren't the only options. You can, in a pathological fit, destroy
yourself. The lesson of the suicidal hijackers cuts both ways.

<snip>
There is no way of making peace with the terrorist organizations.
<snip>

That's a defence of intransigence. But let's make that assumption, even
though it may be wrong. Is this a legitimate casus belli, given that the
terrorist organisations are widely distributed? That is, should one just
pick a country or two and bomb them and/or invade them? Are the war aims
achievable? That is, will bombing and/or invading Afghanistan bring peace,
prosperity and moderation to that country? Will eliminating Usama bin Laden,
Ayman al Zawahiri and Mullah Tom Cobbley destroy al Qa'ida? Will the growth
in violent Islamist activity elsewhere tail away as a result or will it
increase?

<snip>
Nothing that the U.S. can do as a country or that its citizens can do as
individuals can create peace with them. [...] Sure it would be good to try
to modify American foreign policy in dozens of places, but no beneficial
change in American policy would affect our present enemies.
<snip>

The rhetoric of impotence is misplaced. I can't negotiate with dry rot. I
can 'defeat' it, cutting away at structural timbers in the process. I can
also reduce the likelihood of a recurrence by addressing the conditions in
which dry rot occurs.

<snip>
Their recruits would never learn of [these changes] or they would hear of
them only through the screen of propaganda created by their mullahs.
<snip>

Does this include those said to be based in the West?

<snip>
There are probably only two plausible reasons for the bombing -- as domestic
public relations for Bush, because it offers visible evidence of America
striking back, and as a credible warning to Iraq, Libya, Syria etc, to keep
out of it.
<snip>

Yes. The first is, morally, the *worst* sort of reason. The second, the
'credible warning', offers militant Islamists the proof they need: it
writes the extremists' scripts.

<snip>
But I don't see any reason why a so-called "leftist' would object to a
serious ground campaign  aimed at overthrowing the Taliban
<snip>

Replacing it with *what* exactly? The labile confederacy of minority leaders
and warlords making up the Northern Alliance, which will be discredited in
any case through being seen as US stooges? Chaps in blue hats sitting
smoking in their trucks whilst Afghanistan further destroys itself and
continues to be destroyed? A post Taleban Pashtounistan, incorporating part
of a wrecked, dismembered Pakistan, formed after the US loses heart or
interest and equipped with nuclear weapons?

Sorry to be so rude.

I've heard from an international source that possibly the media in th US =
are somewhat selctive in the information they highlightparticularly in =
the frequent 'soundbite' form we get it.  As memory serves this was true =
during the Vietnem era as it may have been true at other times.  I'm =
sure this is not 'news' to many here and i don't think there is any =
particular culprit to point a finger at or that finger pointing does =
anything constructive.

but

at the same time it does seem to me that perhaps poetry is a 'better' =
source of news?

It is my pleasure to invite you to a very special event. On Thursday October
25 at 4:30 Elizabeth Alexander will present a poetry reading on campus at
the Visual Arts Performing Space. For anyone interested in the African
American experience, contemporary poetry or jazz, you will not want to miss
this.

Alexander is an extraordinary young poet already widely anthologized. The
New York Times Book Review has said that "Elizabeth Alexander creates
intellectual magic in poem after poem." In a stunning third collection of
poetry, Antebellum Dreambook (2001), she furthers her reputation as a vital
and vivid poetic voice on race, gender, politics, and motherhood.

Alexander has read her poetry and lectured on African American literature
and culture across the country and abroad. Her two previous collections of
poetry include The Venus Hottentot and Body of Life. She is a faculty member
at Cave Canem Poetry Workshop and teaches at Yale University.

Please join me in providing her with a big, welcoming, and enthusiastic UCSD
audience.
I look forward to seeing you on the 25th.

With warm regards,

Nicole King

Towards a Trotskyist Poetics? The Example of Earle Birney

"Liberalism equals the gulag" : negation & equivalency in Bruce Andrews' I
Don't Have Any Paper So Shut Up (or, Social Romanticism)
A Talk by Louis Cabri
Studies in Practical Negation guest speaker
Saturday October 27 2pm


Born in Calgary, 1904, raised in the Kootenays, Earle Birney established the
first Trotskyist group in Western Canada and drafted policy documents for
the founding body of Trotskyism in Canada. His singular trajectory from
radical sectarian to canonical poet absorbs contradictions in a way that
only a 'Trotskyist poetics' might resolve. The tenuous thread of radical
Marxism in Canada, in its relation to poetic practice, particularly
modernist form, begins, like it or not, with the example of Earle Birney.

Ken Edwards is a British writer & composer. His books include Lorca: an
elegiac fragment, Tilth, Drumming & Poems, Intensive Care, Good Science:
Poems 1983-1991, 3600 Weekends, Futures, & Glory Box. He is the editor &
publisher of Reality Street Editions
<http://freespace.virgin.net/reality.street> and plays violin with the new
music ensemble COMA. Edwards' visit is sponsored by the British Council.

Louis Cabri is the author of The Mood Embosser (Couch House, 2001) and
curator of the PhillyTalks series of dialogues with contemporary writers
<www.english.upenn.edu/~wh/phillytalks>.  He is the co-editor and
publisher, with Robert Manery, of hole books. << On a Greimasian grid of
'late capitalism', Andrews' "social romanticism" projects the negative
counterpart, and domestic equivalent, of Soviet socialist realism. High
modernist precedents? Forget it! The order-word of order-words - change! -
ever since the consolidation of the bourgeoisie, here is obstructed in every
detail. This is a state novel for America. >>

The Kootenay School of Writing is a not-for-profit writer-run centre founded
in 1984 to carry out counter-hegemonic writing practices in post-national,
de-institutionalized, anti-professional and collaborative contexts. KSW
hosts readings, talks and panels with visiting and local writers, offers
free seminars and critical reading groups, publishes W magazine, and
operates the Charles Watts Memorial Library, a collection of books,
journals, audio & video recordings, and ephemera that document contemporary
& 20th century rearticulatory writing. The centre offers a programme for
people wishing to engage with writing & politics outside of the econometrics
of official verse culture--the workshop industry, spoken-word slams,
creative writing degrees, "quality literature" & "accomplished authors",
CanLit, "alternative poetry" scenes--without mentors, pedagogues, arts
bureaucrats or other recuperators.

A nice rant from Jimmy Smith, Los Angeles musician, reprinted from the
Texas e mag called nerdnosh.  Jimmy (Guitar) Smith can be reached at
rjgeezer@aol.com.





It's starting to seem like our trusty Gov officials have worked out the way
to deal with our "Twenty-first Century War"
What began as a simple campaign back in junior high school, has grown from
that first big win on the "Most hideously dressed hall monitor" ticket,
through the years of "brown noser general" into the real world of
"sociologists for a less personal view", and other high offices.
Now our futures are safe in the hands of the hopelessly lost in rhetoric.
I especially like the new plan to send money into the region of our enemies
in order to deprive them of money. It smacks of the kind of thinking that is
too busy correcting the spelling of jokes to get the actual joke.
A priest and a Rabbi walk into a bar.
"Why would they be going to a bar?"
It don't matter, maybe to get a drink.
"Are they in their clerical garb?"
Hell I don't know, anyway, they walk into this bar.
"which bar?"
just a bar
"is it a nightclub, or a beer and wine place or what?"
I don't know.
"well I don't see anything funny about that"

It is also a pretty swell idea to send lots of new expensive armored vehicles
and unwieldy guns into the dirt mountains that comprise pretty much all of
the hostile region we are being careful of.
The Russian equipment the locals stole a few years back is kind of out of
date and out of ammo, so the locals need something new and interesting, and
fun, to steal.
"Russian tank is shit, look at new American tank I got, worth three perhaps
five Camels"
We shouldn't be sending our boys either, we should be sending our Boy Bands.
N' Sync Invades Turkbarkistan.
They could sing watered down Temptations harmonies and dance some hip hop at
the filthy Turkbarkistanians, and confuse the hell out of everybody.
Then when we find what's left of their bodies we could have a raffle. Get a
sponsor, a host,
(Carrot top comes to mind)
and raise more money to send into the region to deprive the region of money.
Personally, I don't know what to think, because nobody in charge has actually
told me what is really going on for the past fifty years that I have been
aware that something seemed to be going on, and I don't know why they would
start now.
Is Elvis really dead?
Did we send a spaceship to the moon?
El Nino, Global warming and Elian? Rumors or profit?
Are those tits real?
Are we barking at the right moon in the first place?
My wife and I can't get health care.
She is a disabled science student, with several years of four point O grades
and honors certificates adorning the walls, I work several days a week as a
volunteer for various recovery organizations, helping addicts return to
consciousness so they can see how truly screwed they are.
But we don't have seven small children with doubtful national origins and no
discernible genetic links to speak of, so we don't qualify for medical help,
or financial help, or any other government aid I can think of without being
willing to lie and cheat to get it.

I wish I knew what I was talking about. Damn, I wish somebody knew what they
were talking about.
Like a good soldier I would get my gun and go stand up front, and say yes sir
because I do know that that is the way it is done.
I would give my life for my country, no bones about it.
Is that as funny as the priest and rabbi joke?
I think not.

WHAT IS AFGHANISTAN?:  A READING & OPEN DISCUSSION

=46eaturing Tamim ANSARY, Shadi SADAT, Jennifer HEATH

Monday, November 5
7:30 pm, free
@ The Unitarian Center
1187 Franklin (& Geary)
San Francisco

The Poetry Center will sponsor a reading and open discussion on
Afghanistan, to take place on Monday, November 5th (we are moving with
haste as one of the participants will only be in the Bay Area from Nov
1-5).  This event will put a human face on Afghanistan, and will focus on
the presence and multiple perspectives of two writers from that country,
alongside an American writer intimate with Afghan history, politics, and
perspectives.  Writers are too often ignored as commentators during
political upheaval in the U.S., or else limited to functions considered
appropriate (e.g., the poet's role since 9/11 has been figured largely as
providing consolation for loss).  This event will allow writers with a
working knowledge of Afghanistan and its people to present their literary
work and to comment on and provide personal testimony regarding recent
events.  WHAT IS AFGHANISTAN?--a question in homage to poet and activist
Walter Lowenfels' historic question Where is Vietnam?--will offer a greatly
needed opportunity for Californians to become aware of educated
perspectives that reach beyond those of political commentators who pursue
issues of policy while ostensibly providing information.  This event will
broaden public understanding and directly address prevailing public
ignorance of Afghanistan and Afghan peoples, recent history, and cultures.
The evening may also include live introductory music by a locally-based
Afghan rabab master.

Confirmed participants:

TAMIM ANSARY:  Afghan American writer whose article "An Afghan American
Speaks" was broadcast widely over the internet (Craig's list, Salon.com, et
al) in the wake of the 9/11 attacks, leading to Mr. Ansary's appearance on
national television (e.g., with Bill Moyers) and radio.  He has been in the
US for 35 years, writing for non-profits in the SF Bay Area, and is the
author of many nonfiction books for children, focused on Native Americans,
science, and other subjects.  He writes a column for online encyclopedia
site Encarta..  Mr. Ansary's autobiographical memoir will be published in
Spring 2002, and he is presently completing a novel set in Afghanistan.

SHAHI SADAT:  Afghan poet, currently a student of International Relations
at San Francisco State University, has lived in the U.S. as a political
refugee since 1995.  Born in Jalalabad, Afghanistan in 1972, he has written
several books of poetry, short stories, and aphorisms in different
languages--English, German, Hindi-Urdu, Farsi, and Pashtu (Afghani),
including Tears of the Heart and From the Breath of Life to the Sigh of
Death, 2000 (Afghan Cultural Society, Alameda, CA).  In 1998 he received
the honor of being named Afghanistan's National Poet and Poet of the Year
by the Afghan Cultural Organizations in Exile.  In 1999 his scholarly
research at Kabul University, conducted with well-known Afghan
anthropologist, poet, and writer Addul Shakoor Rishad, was prevented
publication by the Taliban.  His family lives in exile in Peshawar,
Pakistan.

JENNIFER HEATH:  novelist, teacher and activist, author of an historical
novel about Afghanistan, A House White With Sorrow:  Ballad for
Afghanistan, 1995 ("a heartrending, heartwarming, very human novel in which
a young American woman's life becomes inextricably entwined with the lives
and politics of Afghanistan" --Lucy Lippard, art critic & novelist).  Ms.
Heath lived in Afghanistan for many years, and is involved in various
Afghan and anti-Taliban organizations.  Her next book is forthcoming from
Paulist Press: The Scimitar and the Veil: Extraordinary Women of Islam.
She lives in Boulder, CO.

STEVE DICKISON, Moderator.  Executive director of The Poetry Center &
American Poetry Archives, and lecturer at SFSU.  A poet, editor, and
writer, he is at work on The Unfolded Fold, an edition of the U.S.-born
Canadian poet Robin Blaser's selected talks on poets and poetry from the
1980s and '90s, as well as an edition of the selected writings of Lebanese
American writer Etel Adnan.  With David Meltzer, he co-edits and publishes
the new publication Shuffle Boil, a magazine of poets and music, a
tri-annual featuring writings by poets, musicians, and other artists
focused on music.  Recent Poetry Center programs under his direction have
included presentations of writers from Lebanon, Syria, Israel, Bosnia,
Phillipines, and an anthropologist focused on Morocco.

Andrea. Hopefully you're right. The problem is that those who control the
means of production are or may be forever reluctant to "let go"...then
things do and have change(d) as we have changed from fuedalism to more
democratic forms and in time the whole world may progress: to be sanguine it
will take a combination of "working on our heads - all of us" - and
technology and science and the arts and poetry and language used for and by
the people: a true revolution with more people being more involved and many
more levels of power. That's the hopeful perspective: obviously for war and
"terrorism" so on to continue as it seems to have done is nihilistic. What
are the causes and what are the solutions? But for now I'll be positive
about this Shell bloke. Hope from the Shell bloke. Regards, Richard.-----

To Millie? Scott Etal. My grammar was a bit suspect here: I meant:  "There
is no writing (apart from the scrawling of a monkey and is that writing?)
that has no semantic content, and that even so-called nonsense was or could
be, meaningfull in ways other than strictly "logical" ways." Scot, maybe you
could comment at this point? Elucidate, so to speak!?
  Thanks for your support of my poems. I'll send that one which begins: "In
the rumours of the lost rooms" certainly not a Langpo type poem but it began
with those lines "coming to me" I think as I began to fall asleep...from a
dream as it were.
   Whoever sent the poem below: at least its a change from the "political"
and S11 argie bargey.....before S11 I was going to do a kind of "Zen" thing
a la John G and maybe Richard von S and chill out from the whole scene man!!

Perhaps I am a heretic on the list serve but I do not oppose the violent
response that we are making to the events of Sept 11.  It is possible to
find moral
or ethical problems with many wars since WWII but I think that this response
is justified.  Just as our fight against Germany and Japan was justified.
How else should we respond? These people attacked and killed 6000 people.
Do I want innocent people killed? Of course not but someone needs to tell me
what we should do? I was in the village the other day and there was this
protest against "war"but what is the right response to being attacked?

Oh my God! Really?

I suspected something like that when I read a US history of the War
of 1812, but I did not credit my hunch.

Charles:

I like this poem/reflection but I really think the poem in this whole
September 11th thing is what has happened to
the people like those kitchen workers in the WTC.  I went to a funeral for a
person not related to this incident and on the altar there were 13 candles
for people from the parish who died in the WTC.  Most of the people who died
lived in places like Queens, and New Jersey.  They were the New Yorkers who
have the real accent and live the hard life in the city.  It is funny
because one of my uncles was in the WTC and he is a real waspized Italian
you know the type who went to classes to lose his accent NYU mba etc.  Yet,
afterwords all he could talk about was how the cleaning people did not get
out.  Charles I sent your reflection on to some friends

I think that the vision of Israel has real value. Where they went wrong is
when they began to forget where they came from.  While I am not a total
Zionist I think that the fact that the Jews do a have a safe haven is
important.

Subject:      Peace in Our Time
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii" ; format="flowed"

I have no trouble understanding the distaste of so many people on the
list for the policies and rhetoric of the Bush government and to a
great extent I share it. But I don't understand the fantasy of some
kind of peaceful resolution with our enemies in the Islamic world. A
murderous, suicidal attack was launched against the city of New York
by a terrorist group who have no interest in peace with the United
States. What they appear to be aiming at is a rallying of  Islamic
discontents -- of which there are many with real reasons for their
discontent --  around a flag of religious reform. They've said so and
I think you have to take their word for it.  What they want is a
jehad against the modern secular world, of which United States is the
foremost exponent.  They haven't done well in the modern world.
They've been robbed by their own rulers as well as by colonial powers
contending for trade routes or oil. And what the terrorist leaders
like bin Laden appear to be trying to do is to show that devotion to
a religious cause by just a few true believers can cause chaos among
the infidel. If the present anthrax attacks are shown to be part of
the bin Laden terror campaign, it would add support to this view,
because these attacks are more panic inducing than seriously
damaging.  If his people get away with their attacks and there is no
powerful counter response, they will gain prestige for their
accomplishment, acquire new recruits and repeat their attacks. If
they are counter-attacked and survive, they'll be admired as heroes
by the same group of discontents,gain recruits and attack again. The
only option is a counterattack that they don't survive or survive
with so much damage that it inhibits their abilities to strike again.
There is no peace option. By contrast, Israel and the Palestinians
have a fairly simple peace option, not very likely in the present
circumstance, but real nonetheless. An Israeli withdrawal from the
territories and a relocation of the settlements that allows an
integral Palestinian state would go a long way to resolving the
intifada. That is of course the last thing the terrorists would want.

But is the attack on Afghanistan the kind of counter-attack that
makes sense? Until the attack on the World Trade Center, the US
exhibited no special interest in overthrowing the Taliban. The
suggestion that the attack on Afghanistan is about oil is ridiculous.
It is almost as likely that we're after their poppy crop. The attack
on the Taliban is a retaliation against a government that "harbors
and trains terrorists", and to the degree that the attack is
seriously functional, it will destroy bin Laden's training centers
and much of his personnel. This may or may not be reasonably
successful, but the main effect is to make clear to other governments
that it will cost dearly to support bin Laden or his like. At the
same time the US has until recently moved very cautiously with the
Northern Alliance. They are probably no better than the Taliban,
though this is of no great concern to the US. The governing maxim of
diplomacy and war is that the enemy of my enemy is my friend. But a
serious mitigating condition is the hostilitu of the American
"friend," Pakistan, to the Northern Alliance. By the same maxim, the
enemy of our friend is our enemy. At the least, this has made us wary
of the Northern Alliance.  And Pakistan's situation is precarious. It
has nuclear weapons and a restless pro-Taliban minority. So the US,
if the rumors regarding this are reliable, has apparently even been
considering Taliban participation in a new Afghan coalition
government after the present government is overthrown. Is this nice?
Is this just? Is it desirable? The question is absurd. It is
Realpolitik.  Some list writers have confidently assured me that such
a government must fail because the US will have invented it. Maybe
so, but the US contributed mightily to the invention of the Taliban,
and they've already lasted too long. As for the prolonged bombing,it
doesn't seem functional. There can hardly have been a sufficient
number of military targets for so long a bombing campaign, and every
extra day of bombing will produce more innocent civilian casualties.
If the Bush government insists on an overt action to get bin Laden
and destroy his recruits, they'll have to send in ground troops and
go after them. This may be somewhat useful. But the real action will
still be an international covert counter-intelligence operation
against the sabotage networks. Either we kill them off or they will
continue to produce intermittent havoc. And to argue that we won't
get all of them and therefore should do nothing is absurd. When your
house is infested with mice, you kill off as many as you can and they
disappear for a while. When they reappear, you go after them again.

Joe. Some of the good things about the US (or am I naive?) are that
reputation of the FBI's and your Constitution etc (and some of the real
progess that has been made in human rights without overlooking the problems
and injustices) ..... but the FBI has a relatively high reputation but maybe
that is one of those myths we would like to believe. Trouble with torture is
that if you are dealing - I say IF - with a more ruthless opponent, its not
in the self interests of the US to torture, as of course it means the enemy
will treat any "suspects" they capture equally or more ruthlessly,  and
maybe its another question as to when or whether the ends ever justify the
means. I dont think that the US has its "back to the wall" (yet) so to
speak..but even during the 2nd WW (when the US may have been justified as
the Japanese treatment of people everywhere was abyssmal) it was probably
better to be as human and humane as possible as its opposite leads to the
kind of thinking and attitude hence actions that (maybe indirectly and
rather elliptically) lead to the US being attacked on S11.  For now the FBI
I feel should try to keep its reputation as far as it goes and you also have
the constitution as well as a "moc" ridden democracy...but I suppose that's
something. Keep to your own Constitution, I feel.  Regards, Richard.

Brooklyn Academy of Music (BAM) presents Under_score: Net Art, Sound, and
Essays from Australia at http://www.bam.org/under_score, an online
exhibition showcasing the works of nine Australian artists for whom the
internet has emerged as one of the most significant arenas for artistic
experimentation and multimedia production. The exhibit is part of Next Wave
Down Under, BAM's month-long celebration of Australian arts and culture.

The works presented here represent a vast diversity of approaches,
technologies, applications, and aesthetics, but with few exceptions,
coalesce thematically around "the body", a persistent theme which at the
beginning of the new millennium is present more than ever in discussions of
art, the sciences, and the media. From Francesca da Rimini's diary-like
reflections and confrontational rants concerning erotic relations, power,
and sexual taboo in GashGirl, to the richly layered dream-like 3D spaces and
soundscapes in Melinda Rackham's empyrean,  Australian artists are helping
to define new modes of electronic writing and reading, multimedia,
performance, image making, and sonic production. Other artists include John
Tonkin, MEZ, Paul Brown, geniwate, Ian Haig, Honor Harger, Adam Hyde, zina
kaye, Caleb K., Mr. Snow, Gary Zebington, and Jason Sweeney.

In addition, Under_score provides related links to fourteen works by
Australian artists working in a variety of new media formats including
CD-ROM, installation, and performance. There are two innovative online
broadcasters, l'audible and r a d i o q u a l i a, delivering some of the
most compelling sound work in Australia and New Zealand, and select audio
pieces from The Listening Room, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation's
award sound art program.

In order to expand the discussion of these works and their significance BAM
has commissioned three online essays by Allen Feldman, an American cultural
and political anthropologist, Australian new media theorist Darren Tofts,
and Australian writer and media critic McKenzie Wark.

Under_score: Net Art, Sound and Essays from Australia, now available at:
http://www.bam.org/under_score

In conjunction with Next Wave Down Under,  BAM commissioned Australian new
media company, Drome to recreate the CD-ROM Making Chunky Move for web
delivery.  The web work explores how one of Australia's most exciting
contemporary dance companies created the dance work Corrupted 2, which made
its U.S. debut at  BAM during this year's Next Wave Festival. The
documentary follows the company from the germ of an idea to the stage,
behind the scenes and beyond, including snapshot interviews with the key
players, dancers, creative collaborators, and other cultural professionals
as well as unique virtual 3-D segments, sound bites, and extensive video
footage.

Hiya,

six weeks on we can now see that the war on 'terror' is just a pretext -
and a desirable one at that.

The Taliban, installed with US support, isn't playing ball and this tragedy
has provided the near perfect (near perfect only in that it is an extremely
dangerous chapter of the Great Game and could yet backfire) cover to prove
even further that control of oil is paramount. That's the subtext, but it's
rapidly becoming the main read.

Curious that there's no mention now of 'Enduring Freedom', but then it's
really Operation Secure Pipeline or Campaign Stable Conduit . . . or

love and love
cris

It is becoming increasingly clear that this war is not about American Imperialism, a conflict with Islam, or a Palestinian problem. we (as people of the Western world) were attacked and fighting for our most basic survival. we have the enemy that is plain evil, can't be contained thru negotiations & should be eliminated. this enemy might be boosted by the policies of corrupt governments here and worldwide, but targets us - people - first.

at the moment, this war is not going too good. it gets bogged down in a political nightmare reminiscent of Vietnam. time is of the essence. we should hit Taliban/al Quada a.s.a.p. with everything we've got, including ground troops and tactical nukes, if neccessary.

Anybody who is looking for political alternatives and pieceful solutions should imagine what would happen if WW2 dragged on for another couple of years, allowing Hitler to gain nukes. Then check out this report from CNN.

Nuclear scientists interrogated over possible bin Laden link

ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (CNN) --Pakistani authorities have interrogated two leading nuclear scientists about possible contacts with the leader of Afghanistan's Taliban militia, government officials said.

The revelation comes as reports emerge from The Times newspaper of Britain indicating that Osama bin Laden and his al Qaeda network have acquired nuclear materials for possible use against the West.

Pakistan sources told CNN the two men were Chaud Abdul Majeed and Sultan Bashiruddin Mahmood, both people of deep religious beliefs and acclaimed scientists in the region.

Mahmood was one of the founders of Pakistan's nuclear program and was detained Tuesday by intelligence agents in the eastern city of Lahore.

Majeed, a scientist who worked for years with Mahmood at the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission, also was also being held, officials in the Interior Ministry said on condition of anonymity.

The sources said the two have had dealings with the Taliban and have been guiding them on science-related matters, although the exact nature of their dealings is unclear.

Both men once worked at the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission, but had been in Afghanistan since the Taliban came into power in 1996, the sources said. It was not clear why they were back in Pakistan.

Neither has been charged with any crime.

A senior government official told Associated Press news agency on condition of anonymity that Mahmood is not suspected of being linked to terrorism suspect Osama bin Laden or his al Qaida network.

Bin Laden nuclear threat

Bin Laden, the chief terror suspect in the September 11 attacks on the United States, has acquired nuclear material illegally from Pakistan, according to a front page report from The Times newspaper that quoted unnamed "intelligence sources".

Although the sources were insistent bin Laden did not have the capacity to launch a nuclear attack, they said it appeared he had acquired a vast array of weaponry for intended use against the West.

The Times said bin Laden's possession of nuclear components motivated the regular warnings from U.S. President George W. Bush and British Prime Minister Tony Blair that bin Laden would attempt to perpetrate worse atrocities than the suicide attacks on New York and Washington.

The paper said: "Bin Laden has said it was his 'religious duty' to seek to acquire the chemical, biological and nuclear weapons of mass destruction."

Even without the capability of launching a nuclear attack, fears still persisted that bin Laden could orchestrate the activation of a 'dirty bomb', whereby radioactive material could be dispersed in an urban area, causing death and contamination in a highly populated area.

Pakistan weapons 'secure'

Foreign nations worry about political unrest in Pakistan because the country, like its neighbor and rival, India, is a nuclear power.

Some say uncertainty in the government could threaten the security of Pakistan's nuclear arsenal.

President Gen. Pervez Musharraf has drawn the wrath of Islamic militants for his decision to support the United States in its fight against terrorism and its airstrikes on Afghanistan. Some have advocated the overthrow of Musharraf.

But the president insists the nation is behind him, and that Pakistan's nuclear weapons are in secure hands.

Continuing the last post of recent and new books from Granary [& thanks to
poetics@ readers and writers for the incredible response!]

Jack Smith. The Beautiful Book. First published by Piero Heliczer's
the dead language in 1962 this is the only autonomous collection of
Jack Smith's photographs to appear during his lifetime. The Beautiful
Book comprises 19 hand-tipped black and white contact prints (2 1/4
square) originally published in a hand crafted edition of 200. An
amazing book of legendary rarity. Our edition (also 200 copies) is
made in collaboration with the Plaster Foundation - the photographs
are printed from the original negs - hand-tipped with a silkscreened
cover - saddle-stitched. A dead ringer for the original - a wonderful
book - lost in the shuffle - now available. Price to be determined:
we'll know for sure by Oct 30 - in the range of $350. Only 140 for
sale. Advance reservations advised.

Swoon by Nada Gordon and Gary Sullivan. $17.95. Finally... the true story
of two poets who meet on the poetics list and fall in love... 325 pages
with some pictures [in black and white] "Swoon is perfect" [says
Eileen Myles] - Autobiography, poetry, literary essay and erotica all
rolled into one Swoon documents the
tenacity of love, and shows how, like a species of prehistoric insect that
continues to crawl among us, it survives - with language as its host - even
in inhospitable conditions. "...fabulous, compulsive reading: proof of the
ability of love and need and even writing to trump the crappiness of daily
life." Chris Kraus.

The Tango by Leslie Scalapino and Marina Adams. $29.95 - Due in from
Hong-Kong on Tuesday this book is oversized - printed in full-color -
photographs [of debating monks] and text by Leslie Scalapino - works
on paper, painting on found materials by Marina Adams. With a
prefatory note by Robert Grenier. "The Tango is an investigation into
the shifting locations of consciousness - how our investment into the
attributes of things determines what is evoked by them. Through the
variable reconstructions of given forms (the fractured repetitions of
phrases and images) we encounter a multi-faceted possibility of
awareness." Kiki Smith.

A Purchase in the White Botanica: the Collected Poetry of Piero Heliczer
(1937-1993) edited by Gerard Malanga and Anselm Hollo. 152 pp. $15.95
Luminous work by this wonderful poet, actor, filmmaker and guitarist -
"Piero Heliczer is a prime constituent of NYC's magic underground of the
hip 60s. With compatriots Angus MacLise, Gerard Malanga, Jack Smith a.o. he
exemplified the visionary avant-garde artist. At once inter-disciplinary
but always, and forever, the poet." Thurston Moore. "A landscape somehow
medieval and modern, traveled by an oriental miniaturist with an
Elizabethan sensibility, the observations noted in a unique discursive
language of delicate clarity, of shifts and asides...I envy those readers
coming to [these poems] for the first time." Tom Raworth

[Note: Anthology Film Archives will present a four-day program of films by
Jack Smith and Piero Heliczer Nov. 28-Dec 2. Check out their rather
extensive calendar at http://www.anthologyfilmarchives.org detailing this
exciting weekend.]


Abundant Treasures by Simon Pettet and Duncan Hannah."Quanto e
possente amor!" (How powerful love is!) Text and images printed by
Inge Bruggeman at Textura Letterpress in Portland OR then handcolored
by Duncan Hannah. Bound in printed cloth over boards by Judith Ivry.
Circa 9" x 12" - 36 pages. Forty copies in the edition signed by poet
and artist. Unpriced at this writing - please inquire. [Approximately
but probably less than $2,000.]


Details exist on our website which is gradually being updated.

CALENDAR OF EVENTS
OCTOBER 29 - NOVEMBER 5

MON 10/29    POM POM: POETRY JOURNAL
Pom Pom, a brand spankin' new journal for poetry that seeks to foster a
poetic polylogue by printing poems that talk with one another. For the debut
issue, the editors sought poems from poets willing to have their work
responded to, altered, lifted, plagiarized, or transformed. In subsequent
issues the magazine promises work that flirts with, stomps on, folds up,
bosses around, takes liberties with, and generally engages with poems in
previous issues. Readers this evening are CHRIS JACKSON, NASHVILLE; JENN
MCCREARY, PHILADELPHIA; CAROL MIRAKOVE, BROOKLYN; C.E. PUTNAM, SEATTLE;
DEBORAH RICHARDS, PHILADELPHIA; and GARY SULLIVAN, Brooklyn; as well as the
editors: ALLISON COBB; JEN COLEMAN; ETHAN FUGATE; SUSAN LANDERS. [8:00 P.M.]


WED 10/31    VICTOR HERNANDEZ CRUZ AND EDWIN TORRES
Celebrating new books by both authors: Cruz's Maraca: New and Selected Poems
(Coffee House Press) and Torres's The All-Union Day of the Shock Worker
(Roof Books). Born in Aguas Buenas, Puerto Rico, VICTOR HERNANDEZ CRUZ moved
to New York City with his family at the age of five. In addition to his
latest collection, Maraca: Selected Poems, his books include Papo Got His
Gun, By Lingual Wholes, a poetic study of bi-lingualism, and Red Beans
(Winner of the Publishers Weekly "Ten Best Books of the Year" Award).
Publishers Weekly writes about Cruz's recent book Panoramas: "Celebrated for
creating poetry that is a collision of the sounds, tensions and flavors of
New York and Puerto Rico, Cruz achieves a musical vitality that surpasses
any of his other volumes." EDWIN TORRES is a self-proclaimed Shock Worker,
"making the world safe for danger." Torres creates performances that mingle
textures of poetry with vocal and physical improvisation, sound-elements and
visual theater. His CD Holy Kid (Kill Rock Stars) was part of The Whitney
Museum's exhibit, The American Century Pt. II. In addition to The All-Union
Day of the Shock Worker, his books include I Hear Things People Haven't
Really Said, and Fractured Humorous (Subpress). [8:00 P.M.]

Once again, rose @4:30am, to catch a 7:30 ferry and then two other ferries travelling  5 hours in the rain with my first edition Sitwells, Edith and Osbert to sell to the rare book dealer to pay my return fare, all to attend a couple of the events around the 400th anniversary of Tish magazine. After sharing homegrown pasta ala genoese avec Les Reids, Carol and Jaime, we set out for Capilano College, nestled in the hills of the end end of North Vancouver where Frank Davey the original editor gave a brilliant talk entitled Barcodes on Tish: Little Magazines, Nation States and Gobbleisation wherein he revealed how the counada council directly shores up bankrupt Chapters, which in return requires publishers to overprint and then pulps their mammoth returns(razing additional forests?) There was a panel of Respondants two young publishers from Calgary, Derek Beaulieu and Russ Rickey, spoke about Filling Station Magazine's similar dealings with Chapters and the Canada Council and th
 e CMPA the distributors, Sharon Thesen, editor of the Capilano Review, Susan Clark editor of Raddle Moon, Michael Barnholden, editor of Tsunami Press and Jason LeHeup were all on the panel, and Peter Oxier and Roy Miki and Stan Persky and George Bowering from among the audience in the packed lecture hall all contributed to a very revealing discussion. Afterwards the participants, other Tish writer/editors and similar lifelong malingerers poured libations at the gracious east end abode of Maria Hindmarch.
The next day the Vancouver International Writers Festival featured Tish editors, Frank Davey, beginning with a hilarious gramatology of dog showese, David Dawson, according to Karl Ziegler, was there to prove to Frank Davey that he wasn't just a footnote in Canadian literary history, David Cull read some powerful political poems, Bobby Hogg eulogized Roy Rogers, Stan Persky's jowls threaten to reach Falstaffian proportions, Diane Laloge read a poem about her 17 year old encounter with the old man Spicer's transistor radio, he was hip because he knew everything and she was hip because she knew nothing,
Brad Robinson's soft spoken rant about smoking received wide approval among an appreciative and vocal 800 strong audience filling Performance Works, the festival venue on the east end of Granville Island in the west end of False Creek,to the rafters, Maria Hindmarch delivered a powerful documentation of her recent surgery for breast cancer, Lionel Kearns was funny and profound as usual, just before the intermission, he screened the film that the painter gordon payne produced of his poem The Birth of God which consists of a one composed of zeroes surrounded by a Zero composed of ones, a 2 1/2 minute film with a mahvelous soundtrack by the composer Peter Huse. Both films were a retinal bombardment, trippy. Fred Wah, George Bowering, Daphne Marlatt and Jamie Reid rounded out an overwhelming evening of one powerful reading after another. So nice to see Goh Poh Seng back in town after his soujourn in Montreal and Newfoundland where hell be returning to take on the Poet-in-residenc
 e's toque at Memorial University in Cornerbrook. Poets Victoria Walker Margesson, Kate Van Dusen, Dorothy Trujillo Lusk, Kath Morris, Rob McLennan all in attendance. Carol Reid produced a marvelous packet of broadsides commemorating the event and a foyer display that summed everything up nicely. A young and bustling team of videomakers followed every move of the proceedings and more and will produce from their thoroughness an important documentary about these icons of canadian literature. A few drinks at the Arts Club afterwards and we've decided to have the fiftieth anniversary next year, a bit of tapas at La Bodega then it was early to bed in west vancouver for billy getting prepared for the six hour three ferry journey home in the rain the next afternoon.

There were several other events that i wasn't able to attend i'm hoping others will fill in my gaps.

sincerely,

billy little

and to visit the new Fence Books website at http://www.fencebooks.com,
where you can download contest guidelines for the Alberta Prize and the
Fence Modern Poets Series and also perhaps order the first two Fence Books
books: Alberta Prize winner Zirconia, by Chelsey Minnis, and Miss America,
by Catherine Wagner.

"Zirconia's laconic visionary is detached, but alive to the poignancy of
detachment, and through the "silver lips of a feverish child" invites
connectivity by means of tenderness and brutality."
--Fence Editors

"Jack Spicer's Martians are back, but now they're talking wild girl-talk.
In Catherine Wagner's Miss America, public and private collide in a new
way, like matter and anti-matter. This is a conflagration.  'That is damage
talk," she says, "Want to watch me/Make it'. And I do. In fact, if I died,
I might want to come back as Catherine Wagner."
--Rae Armantrout

reading from their poetry
@ The Unitarian Center
1187 Franklin (at Geary)

Join us for two special events linking the world of contemporary poetry
with the overlapping world of visual arts.  During an afternoon
presentation on the SFSU campus, poets Bill Berkson and Vincent Katz pay
tribute to their late friend, pioneering filmmaker, photographer, and
painter Rudy Burckhardt-featuring films and slides of Burckhardt's utterly
memorable and lovingly attentive works.  Later that same evening, Mr.
Berkson and Mr. Katz-both with bright new collections out-will read from
their poetry at San Francisco's Unitarian Center.

BILL BERKSON's discerning senses are as evident and welcome in his many
writings on contemporary artists as in his uniquely "primitive / American /
sophisticate" poetry.  A corresponding editor for Art in America, and
frequent contributor to Modern Painters, Art on Paper, and other magazines,
Mr. Berkson works as professor of art history at the San Francisco Art
Institute.  His new book of poems, Fugue State, with cover by Yvonne
Jacquette, is just out from Zoland Books.  Other recent books are Serenade:
Poetry and Prose 1975-1989 (with cover and drawings by Joe Brainard), Young
Manhattan (prose collaboration with Anne Waldman), A Copy of the Catalogue
(Labyrinth, Vienna), and Hymns of St. Bridget (with Frank O'Hara, new
reprint edition).  He lives in San Francisco.

VINCENT KATZ is a poet, translator, and critic.  His books in collaboration
with artists include A Tremor in the Morning (with linocuts by Alex Katz),
New York Hello! and Boulevard Transportation (both with photos by Rudy
Burckhardt), Pearl (with paintings by Tabboo!), and Voyages (with artist
James Brown).  He curated, in 1998, the first museum retrospective of Rudy
Burckhardt's work, for IVAM in Valencia, Spain, and last year co-curated,
with Lynn Gumpert, Rudy Burckhardt and Friends: New York Artists of  the
1950s and 60s for the Grey Art Gallery in New York.   Mr. Katz has
translated the Latin poems of Sextus Propertius-as the book Charm.
Understanding Objects (Hard Press) is his latest book of poetry, "a new
turn in the poetry of everyday experience" (Kenneth Koch).  He lives in New
York City.

hello poetics list, i've been 'here' but silent for a month and just
wanted to say how glad i am that you are all out 'there'. even in a good
strong academic community like that of the university of virginia,
where i am an english phd student, one rarely finds the kind of loose but
intent sustained discourse this list exhibits every day, and i'm just very
appreciative that it exists. for which reason a little poem of thanks.

best,
damian rollison


5:59 poem
        when time is short
                and i'm expected home
        the poem comes out
        with no malice of forethought
even simplest phrases
        no obduracy of finnegans wake retreads
even repetition of phrases
        when time is short
                and i'm expected home
                        it's quicker to retype them
        and then
                them    and     when
        i cannot be i except how now
                        arranging for the screen
        making a decision
                not     to      stop

until the poem and the time
        are over

this ought to be a poem about war
                but     it      is      not
        this                            ought
        to                              be
        a                               poem
        like                            alan's
        rich                            with
        urls                            and
        system                          messages
        because                         i
        like                            those
        poems of alan's                 so much
        and i                           want to be
        like him                        but it
        is not                          that
        is not                          it

or this ought to be talking like david's poems do
        because i don't         want to have to condense

but it is spaced out    not condensed           like poetry
even though             easy to read            like talking

in fact i am now late,
                now 6:13
                        and the poem is not ending
                        of its own accord
                could stand to be
undone and restitched
                will not take the time
                        time
                                time
        would rather write

     Please note that we are cohosting these visionary writers with the SF
Art Institute & the Poetry Center; the event will be held in the
Auditorium, SF Art Institute, 800 Chestnut, San Francisco. Jack Collom is
the author of many books, including 8-Ball, with monoprints by Donald
Guravich (Dead  Metaphor Press, 1992), Arguing with Something Plato Said
(Rocky Ledge, 1990), The Fox (United Artists, 1982), Little Grand Island
(the press,1977), and Workday (Blue Pig, 1973). He has taught at Naropa
and for the Teachers & Writers Collaborative in NYC. Bernadette Mayer is a
legend  in her own time; her many books include The Formal Field of
Kissing (Catchword Papers, 1990), Another Smashed Pinecone (United Artists
Books,1998) and Proper Name & other stories (New Directions, 1996). Of her
recent Two Haloed Mourners, Ange Mlinko of The Poetry Project Newsletter
wrote "The book starts out dense, vagrant, proceeding on a combination of
automatic writing and methodical structural repetitions. It picks up
speed, changes gears from poetry to prose and back again... a memoir of
fear and loathing as the seventies somersault into the eighties."

Dear List,

In a different vein, I wonder if I could prevail on your
collective and individual awarenesses for help with my
dissertation project, which is now at an inaugural stage.
I'm writing about the nexus of
poem/text/notation/music/performance in Modernist poetry,
specifically collaborations between Gertrude Stein and
Virgil Thompson and between Louis and Celia Zukofsky, with
some discussion of musical notation in Gerard Manley
Hopkins' manuscripts, and of jazz and blues in Harlem
Renaissance poetics. I'm also interested in Cage and Mac
Low, but I don't know as much as I'd like to about
contemporary poetic engagements with musical structure and
performance. I'd love to hear, bc or otherwise, answers to
some questions about contemporary practice (however one
might choose to delimit 'contemporary'):

1) What poets have integrated musical notation into poetic
texts?

2) What strike you as the most significant examples of
opera or oratorio libretti, or other 'words for music', by
contemporary poets?

3) What poets are especially interested in incorporating
jazz, blues, modern orchestral, American folk, or other
musics into their work? In a U.S. context especially, are
there contemporary poets whose work is deeply engaged with
music as a model? (I'm thinking of Zukofsky, Bunting,
Langston Hughes as precursors here.)

I ask these questions not to shirk the work myself, but
because there are, to my knowledge, few obvious ways to
research it.

Thanks!

*
We are about to receive delivery from the printer of Robin Tomens's POINTS
OF DEPARTURE: ESSAYS ON MODERN JAZZ, price $20 U.S. / 10 pounds
U.K.

POINTS OF DEPARTURE is an alternative version of Jazz criticism, one which
scratches beneath the veneer of Objectivity and challenges the tyranny of
so-called
expertise. Robin Tomens believes that Jazz has for too long been at the
mercy of
academics - who often serve only to alienate potential listeners, and that
America's
greatest musical art form deserves to be "freed from the cultural ghetto and
given the
chance to astound all who encounter the many treasures it contains."

POINTS OF DEPARTURE offers both snapshots and larger portraits of post-war
Jazz in a style that is distinctive, humorous, ironic, serious and honest.
It deals with the
reverential idolisation of jazz gods such as Miles Davis and John Coltrane,
as well
as lesser-known artists such as Don Ellis and Joe Harriott. It is not a
guide or a
history but one man's expression of the listening experience which he hopes
will
"entertain, inspire, provoke and playfully debate the nature of Jazz."

The book features Charlie Parker, Thelonious Monk, Bud Powell, Lennie
Tristano,
Charles Mingus, John Coltrane, Miles Davis, Herbie Hancock, Ornette Coleman,
Sun Ra, Cecil Taylor, Art Blakey, Horace Silver, Wayne Shorter, Andrew Hill,
The
Art Ensemble of Chicago, Gil Evans, Jimmy Giuffre, Eric Dolphy, Don Cherry,
Roland Kirk, Archie Shepp, Pharoah Sanders and many others.

NATHANIEL DORSKY: *LOVE'S REFRAIN*, *VARIATIONS*, AND *ARBOR VITAE*

San Francisco Art Institute
800 Chestnut Street (two blocks up the hill from Columbus)
(Take the 30 Stockton!!!)

SATURDAY, OCTOBER 27TH AT 7:30 PM
Nathaniel Dorsky:
*Love's Refrain*, *Arbor Vitae* and *Variations*

Nathaniel Dorsky returns with his three most recently completed films:
*Variations*, *Arbor Vitae* and the second (ever) US screening of his latest
film *Love's Refrain*, three films "which weave breathtakingly composed
images into intricate and taut suspensions of cinematic light and movement."

"Perhaps the most delicately tactile in this series, *Love's Refrain* rests
moment to moment on its own surface. It is a coda in twilight, a soft-spoken
conclusion to a set of four cinematic songs." (Nathaniel Dorsky)

*Love's Refrain* -- which includes among its shots images of poets Philip
Whalen and Bill Berkson-- will also play in Berkeley at the PFA Tuesday
November 27th at 7:30, along with works by other makers.

gee,  there is no END to the evil that the anti-war movement brought
about....  think of the damage we're doing by questioning Bush's
current policies!

*******

from yestrerday’s Boston Globe:


''Honors at Harvard has just lost all meaning,'' said Henry Rosovsky,
a top dean and acting president at Harvard in the 1970s and '80s.
''The bad honors is spoiling the good.''
With Harvard's new president, Lawrence Summers, focused on improving
undergraduate studies and set to deliver his inaugural address this
Friday, the Globe reviewed the university's academic records and
internal memos over the last 50 years to analyze the rigors and
rewards of a Harvard education.
The documents indicate that Vietnam and the protest movements of the
'60s led to an increase in lax grading campuswide, and that the
faculty never recovered. Harry Lewis, the current dean of Harvard
College, wrote in one e-mail that humanities professors today can't
tell an A paper from a B paper, partly because of a ''collapse of
critical judgment.''

Since others have disposed of David Antin's strange set of metaphors, I no
longer feel any need to respond to it, except for this.  In my view poets
should be masters of metaphor; that is one of the things that we can count on
them to do.  They should make us examine the familiar metaphor with new eyes,
or else they should throw startling new metaphors at us, so that our eyes see
new things in the old things. Well, you all can decide for yourselves whether
or not David Antin has done either of these things here. In my view, he has
not.  No, he seems to me to be a a rather tired victim of a rather
traditional set of rather insidious cliches.

Some time ago, Ron Silliman invited us to consider new ways to re-package the
Left.

Well, I'll leave this re-packaging job to you Madison Ave masters of the
metaphor. As for me, the task of the Left is intellectually and morally
clear-cut: we must embrace a position that opposes the sort of religious
fundamentalism that drives this new terrorism that confrnts us, whether it is
Islamic or Christian, foreign or native, or any other fundamentalism [one to
watch out for is Hindu fundamentalism -- very dangerous right now]; a
position that also opposes all violent nationalisms; a position that opposes
all brutal imperialisms, and that means US imperialism in particular since
that is the only viable imperialism that is operating today.   Etc etc etc.

David Antin's suggestion that it is morally indefensible to maintain an
'anti-American' position after the atrocities of Sept 11 itself has no moral
validity whatsoever, as long as the 'American' position is to freely pursue
its own economic and political self-interest without any regard whatsoever to
its responsibility to the international community as a whole.  When you look
at the 'American'  position with regard to the UN, and international law,
treaties, etc., when you look at its utter subservience to greed-driven US
business interests over against basic human decency, on all international
fronts, why would you want to choose between a monster like Bin Laden and a
monster like US foreign policy?

Well, this is a poetics list, so I'll stop participating in this discussion.
But I'll say this one last time: if the Left adheres consistently to a moral
position that adamently resists all of these violent 'isms', if it adheres
consistently to ethical principles that are universal [i.e., applied
universally, even to those who "do not value life as much as we  do', etc.],
well, if, after all, the Left fights the good fight, adhering, without
metaphor, to its easily intelligible though apparently not always persuasive
moral principles, while that fantasmic 90% follows that inarticulate Bush
into sure genocidal disaster, will it really be the Left's fault that David
Antin et al. preferred to play out a disaster-movie game of chess, instead of
simply doing the right thing?

No, I'm not naive, David.  Not at all. I think that you are. And I also think
that, given the chance, you and those like you will take me down with you, as
you steer your fervently hijacked plane straight down into some empty epmty
field, in some metaphorically patriotic Pennsylvania [a field full of
self-respect, no doubt, full like a fetid garbage dump].

The So-Called Evidence Is a Farce
By Stan Goff

http://www.narconews.com/goff1.html

I'm a retired Special Forces Master Sergeant. That doesn't cut much
for
those who will only accept the opinions of former officers on military
matters, since we enlisted swine are assumed to be incapable of
grasping the
nuances of doctrine.

But I wasn't just in the army. I studied and taught military science
and
doctrine. I was a tactics instructor at the Jungle Operations Training
Center in Panama, and I taught Military Science at West Point.

And contrary to the popular image of what Special Forces does, SF's
mission
is to teach. We offer advice and assistance to foreign forces. That's
everything from teaching marksmanship to a private to instructing a
Battalion staff on how to coordinate effective air operations with a
sister
service.

Based on that experience, and operations in eight designated conflict
area
from Vietnam to Haiti, I have to say that the story we hear on the
news and
read in the newspapers is simply not believable. The most cursory
glance at
the verifiable facts, before, during, and after September 11th, does
not
support the official line or conform to the current actions of the
United
States government.

But the official line only works if they can get everyone to accept
its
underlying premises. I'm not at all surprised about the Republican and
Democratic Parties repeating these premises. They are simply two
factions
within a single dominant political class, and both are financed by
the same
economic powerhouses. My biggest disappointment, as someone who
identifies
himself with the left, has been the tacit acceptance of those
premises by
others on the left, sometimes naively, and sometimes to score some
morality
points.

Those premises are twofold. One, there is the premise that what this
de
facto administration is doing now is a "response" to September 11th.
Two,
there is the premise that this attack on the World Trade Center and
the
Pentagon was done by people based in Afghanistan. In my opinion,
neither of
these is sound.  To put this in perspective we have to go back not to
September 11th, but to last year or further.

A man of limited intelligence, George W. Bush, with nothing more than
his
name and the behind-the-scenes pressure of his powerful father-a
former
President, ex-director of Central Intelligence, and an oil man-is
systematically constructed as a candidate, at tremendous cost.

Across the country, subtle and not-so-subtle mechanisms are put into
place
to disfranchise a significant fraction of the Democrat's African-
American
voter base. This doesn't come out until Florida becomes a
battleground for
Electoral College votes, and the magnitude of the story has been
suppressed
by the corporate media to this day. In a decision so lacking in
legitimacy,
the Supreme Court will neither by-line the author of the decision nor
allow
the decision to ever be used as a precedent, Bush v. Gore awards the
presidency of the United States to a man who loses the popular vote in
Florida and loses the national popular vote by over 600,000.

This de facto regime then organizes a very interesting cabinet. The
Vice
President is an oil executive and the former Secretary of Defense. The
National Security Advisor is a director on the board of a
transnational oil
corporation and a Russia scholar. The Secretary of State is a man
with no
diplomatic experience whatsoever, and the former Chair of the Joint
Chiefs
of Staff. The other interesting appointment is Donald Rumsfeld as
Secretary
of Defense. Rumsfeld is the former CEO of Searle Pharmaceuticals. He
and
Cheney were featured as speakers at the May, 2000, Russian-American
Business
Leaders Forum. So the consistent currents in this cabinet are
petroleum, the
former Soviet Union, and the military.

Based on the record of Daddy Bush, in all his guises, and the general
trajectory of US foreign policy as far back as the Carter
Administration, I
feel I can reasonably conclude that Middle Eastern and South Asian
fossil
fuels are one of their major preoccupations. Not just because this
klavern
has some very direct financial interests in fossil fuel, but because
they
surely know that worldwide oil production is peaking as we speak, and
will
soon begin a permanent and precipitous decline that will completely
change
the character of civilization as we know it within 20 years.

Even the left seems to be in deep denial about this, but the math is
available. And, no, alternative energies and energy technologies will
not
save us. All the alternatives in the world can not begin to provide
more
than a tiny fraction of the energy base now provided by oil. This
makes it
more than a resource, and the drive to control what's left more than
an
economic
competition.

I further conclude that the economic colonization of the former
Soviet Union
is probably high on that agenda, and in fact has a powerful synergy
with the
issue of petroleum. Russia not only holds vast untapped resources that
beckon to imperialism in crisis, it remains a credible military and
nuclear
challenger in the region.

We have not one, but three members of the Bush de facto cabinet with
military credentials, which makes the cabinet look quite a lot like a
military General Staff. All this way before September 11th.

Then there's the subject of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
NATO
might have expected consignment to the dustbin of the Cold War after
the
Eastern Bloc shattered in 1991. Peace dividend and all that. But it
didn't.
It expanded directly into the former states of the Eastern Bloc
toward the
former Soviet Union, and contributed significant forces to the
devastation
of
Iraq -a key country in the world oil market, over which control
translates
into the ability to manipulate oil prices. NATO is a military
formation, and
the United States exerts the controlling interest in it.

It seemed like a form without a function, but it remedied that pretty
quickly.  Then when Yugoslavia refused to play ball with the
International
Monetary Fund, the US and Germany began a systematic campaign of
destabilization there, even using some of the veterans of Afghanistan
in
that campaign.

NATO became the military arm of that agenda-the break-up of
Yugoslavia into
compliant statelets, the further containment of the former Soviet
Union, and
the future pipeline easement for Caspain Sea oil to Western European
markets
through Kosovo.
You see, this is important to understand, and people-even those
against the
war talk-are tending to overlook the significance of it. NATO is not a
guarantor of international law, and it is not a humanitarian
organization.

It is a military alliance with one very dominant partner. And it can
no
longer claim to be a defensive alliance against European socialists.
It is
an instrument of military aggression.

NATO is the organization that is now going to thrust further along
the 40th
parallel from the Balkans through the Southern Asian Republics of the
former
Soviet Union. The US military has already taken control of a base in
Uzbekistan. No one is talking about how what we are doing seems to be
a very
logical extension of a strategy that was already in motion, and has
been in
motion for two decades.

Once we recognize the pattern of activity designed to simultaneously
consolidate control over Middle Eastern and South Asian oil, and
contain and
colonize the former Soviet Union, Afghanistan is exactly where they
need to
go to pursue that agenda.

Afghanistan borders Iran, Pakistan, and even China but, more
importantly,
the Central Asian Republics of the former Soviet Union, Uzbekistan,
Turkmenistan and Tajikistan. These border Kazakhstan. Kazakhstan
borders
Russia. Turkmenistan sits on the Southeastern quadrant of the Caspian
Sea,
whose oil the Bush Administration dearly covets.

Afghanistan is necessary for two things: as a base of operations to
begin
the process of destabilizing, breaking off, and establishing control
over
the South Asian Republics, which will begin within the next 18-24
months in
my opinion, and constructing a pipeline through Turkmenistan,
Afghanistan,
and Pakistan to deliver petroleum to the Asian market.

The BBC was recently told by Niaz Naik, a Pakistani Foreign
Secretary, that
senior American officials were warning them as early as mid-July that
military action for mid-October was being planned for Afghanistan. In
1996,
the Department of Energy was issuing reports on the desirability of a
pipeline through Afghanistan, and in 1998, Unocal testified before
the House
Subcommittee on Asia and the Pacific that this pipeline was crucial to
transport Caspian Basin oil to the Indian Ocean.

Given this evidence that a military operation to secure at least a
portion
of Afghanistan has been on the table, possibly as early as five years
ago, I
can't help but conclude that the actions we are seeing put into
motion now
are part of a pre-September 11th agenda. I'm absolutely sure of that,
in
fact. The planning alone for operations, of this scale, that are now
taking
shape, would take many months. And we are seeing them take shape in
mere
weeks.

It defies common sense. This administration is lying about this whole
thing
being a "reaction" to September 11th. That leads me, in short order,
to be
very suspicious of their yet-to-be-provided evidence that someone in
Afghanistan is responsible. It's just too damn convenient. Which also
leads
me to wonder-just for the sake of knowing-what actually did happen on
September 11th, and who actually is responsible.

The so-called evidence is a farce. The US presented Tony Blair's
puppet
government with the evidence, and of the 70 so-called points of
evidence,
only nine even referred to the attacks on the World Trade Center, and
those
points were conjectural. This is a bullshit story from beginning to
end.
Presented with the available facts, any 16-year old with a liking for
courtroom dramas could tear this story apart like a two-dollar shirt.

But our corporate press regurgitates it uncritically. But then, as we
should
know by now, their role is to legitimize.  This cartoon heavy they've
turned
bin Laden into makes no sense, when you begin to appreciate the
complexity
and synchronicity of the attacks.

As a former military person who's been involved in the development of
countless operations orders over the years, I can tell you that this
was a
very sophisticated and costly enterprise that would have left what we
call a
huge "signature". In other words, it would be very hard to effectively
conceal.

So there's a real question about why there was no warning of this.
That can
be a question about the efficacy of the government's intelligence
apparatus.
That can be a question about various policies in the various agencies
that
had to be duped to orchestrate this action. And it can also be a
question
about whether or not there was foreknowledge of the event, and that
foreknowledge is being covered up.

To dismiss this concern out of hand as the rantings of conspiracy
nuts is
premature. And there is a history of this kind of thing being done by
national political bosses, including the darling of liberals, Franklin
Roosevelt. The evidence is very compelling that the Roosevelt
Administration
deliberately failed to act to stop Pearl Harbor in order to mobilize
enough
national anger to enter the World War II.

I have no idea why people aren't asking some very specific questions
about
the actions of Bush and company on the day of the attacks.

Follow along:
Four planes get hijacked and deviate from their flight plans, all the
while
on FAA radar. The planes are all hijacked between 7:45 and 8:10 AM
Eastern
Daylight Time.
Who is notified?
This is an event already that is unprecedented. But the President is
not
notified and going to a Florida elementary school to hear children
read.
By around 8:15 AM, it should be very apparent that something is
terribly
wrong. The President is glad-handing teachers.
By 8:45, when American Airlines Flight 11 crashes into the World Trade
Center, Bush is settling in with children for his photo ops at Booker
Elementary. Four planes have obviously been hijacked simultaneously,
an
event never before seen in history, and one has just dived into the
worlds
best know twin towers, and still no one notifies the nominal
Commander in
Chief.
No one has apparently scrambled any Air Force interceptors either.

At 9:03, United Flight 175 crashes into the remaining World Trade
Center
building.
At 9:05, Andrew Card, the Presidential Chief of Staff whispers to
George W.
Bush. Bush "briefly turns somber" according to reporters.
Does he cancel the school visit and convene an emergency meeting? No.
He
resumes listening to second graders read about a little girl's pet
goat, and
continues this banality even as American Airlines Flight 77 conducts
an
unscheduled point turn over Ohio and heads in the direction of
Washington
DC.
Has he instructed Chief of Staff Card to scramble the Air Force? No.
An excruciating 25 minutes later, he finally deigns to give a public
statement telling the United States what they already have figured
out; that
there's been an attack by hijacked planes on the World Trade Center.
There's
a hijacked plane bee-lining to Washington, but has the Air Force been
scrambled to defend anything yet? No.
At 9:30, when he makes his announcement, American Flight 77 is still
ten
minutes from its target, the Pentagon.

The Administration will later claim they had no way of knowing that
the
Pentagon might be a target, and that they thought Flight 77 was
headed to
the White House, but the fact is that the plane has already flown
South and
past the White House no-fly zone, and is in fact tearing through the
sky at
over 400 nauts.

At 9:35, this plane conducts another turn, 360 degrees over the
Pentagon,
all the while being tracked by radar, and the Pentagon is not
evacuated, and
there are still no fast-movers from the Air Force in the sky over
Alexandria
and DC.
Now, the real kicker: A pilot they want us to believe was trained at a
Florida puddle-jumper school for Piper Cubs and Cessnas, conducts a
well-controlled downward spiral, descending the last 7,000 feet in
two-and-a-half minutes, brings the plane in so low and flat that it
clips
the electrical wires across the street from the Pentagon, and flies
it with
pinpoint accuracy into the side of this building at 460 nauts.

When the theory about learning to fly this well at the puddle-jumper
school
began to lose ground, it was added that they received further
training on a
flight simulator.
This is like saying you prepared your teenager for her first drive on
I-40
at rush hour by buying her a video driving game. It's horse shit!

There is a story being constructed about these events. My crystal
ball is
not working today, so I can't say why.

But at the least, this so-called Commander-in-Chief and his staff
that we
are all supposed to follow blindly into some ill-defined war on
terrorism is
criminally negligent or unspeakably stupid. And at the worst, if more
is
known or was known, and there is an effort to conceal the facts,
there is a
criminal conspiracy going on.

Certainly, the Bush de facto administration was facing a confluence of
crises from which they were temporarily rescued by this event.
Whether they
played a sinister role or not, there is little doubt that they have
at the
very least opportunistically pounced on this attack:
- - to overcome their lack of legitimacy,
- - to shift the blame for the encroaching recession from  capitalism
to the
September 11th terror attack,
- - to legitimize their pre-existing foreign policy agenda,
- - to establish and consolidate repressive measures domestically
and silence
dissent.

In many ways, September 11th pulled the Bush cookies out of the
fire.  And
gave the Bush team the green light to begin constructing a long-term
scenario within which to establish fascistic control measures at home
and
abroad as a citadel for the ruling class in the catastrophic
conjuncture
that we are entering based on the end of oil.

This elephant in the living room is being studiously ignored. In
fact, the
domestic repression has already begun, officially and unofficially.
It's
kind of a latter day McCarthyism. I participated in a teach-in at
Chapel
Hill, North Carolina, on the 17th of September, and though not a
single
person on the panel excused or justified the attacks, and every
person there
offered
either condolences and prayers for the victims, we were excoriated
within
two days as "enemies of America."

Yesterday an op-ed called for my deportation (to where, one can only
guess).
Now Herr Ashcroft is fast tracking the biggest abrogation of US civil
liberties since the so-called anti-terrorism legislation after the
Oklahoma
City bombing - which by the way hasn't resulted in anti-terrorism but
in the
acceleration of the application of the racist death penalty.

The FBI has defined terrorist groups not by whether any given group
has ever
acted as terrorists, but by their beliefs. Some socialists and
anti-globalization groups have already been identified by name as
terrorist
groups, even though there is not a single shred of evidence that they
have
ever participated in any criminal activity. It reminds me of the
Smith Act
that was finally declared unconstitutional, but only after a hell of
a lot
of people served a hell of a long time in jail for the crime of
thinking.

I think this also points to yet another huge problem that the Bush
regime
was facing. Worldwide resistance to the whole so-called neoliberal
agenda,
which is a prettied up term for debt-leverage imperialism. While debt
and
the threat of sanctions has been used to coerce nations in the
periphery, we
have to understand that the final guarantor of compliance remains
military
action.  For a global economic agenda, there is always a corresponding
political and military agenda.

The focal point of these actions in the short term is Southern Asia,
but
they have already scripted this as a worldwide and protracted fight
against
terrorism.  It's far better than drug wars as a rationalization, and
the
drug war thing was being discredited in any case. Leftists are
regaining
power and popularity in Venezuela, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Ecuador,
Colombia, the Dominican Republic, Haiti, Brazil, and Argentina. Cuba
has
gained immense prestige over the last few years. The empire is
beginning to
unravel.

We can hardly justify intervention in these places by saying they are
not
toeing the economic line by allowing the absolute domination of their
societies by transnational corporations. That exposes the agenda. So
we
simply claim they are supporting terrorism.

It's for all these reasons I say the left has missed the boat on this
one,
by allowing them to get away with rushing past the question of who
did what
on September 11th. If the official story is a lie, and I think the
circumstantial case is strong enough to stay with this question, then
we
really do need to know what happened.

And we need to understand concretely what the motives of this
administration
are.  And we need to understand more than just their immediate
motives, but
where the larger social forces that underwrite our situation right
now are
headed. I do not think this administration is engaged in the
deliberative
process of a political grouping that is on top of their game. They are
putting together some very deliberative technical solutions in
response to a
larger situation that it slipping rapidly out of their control. Like
clear
cutting. There's a very smart technology being employed to do a very
dumb
thing.

What they are responding to is not September 11th, but the beginning
of a
permanent and precipitous decline in worldwide oil production, the
beginning
of a deep and protracted worldwide recession, and the unraveling of
the
empire.

This brings me to a point about what all this means for Americans'
security,
which they are perfectly justified to worry about.

The actions being prepared by this administration will not only not
enhance
our security, it will significantly degrade it. Military action
against many
groups across the globe, which is what the administration is telling
us
quite openly they are planning to do, will put a lot of backs against
the
wall.  That can't be very secure.  The concept of war being touted
here is a
violation of the principles of war on several counts, and will
inevitably
lead to military catastrophes, if you're inclined to view this from a
position of moral and political neutrality.

And the people who are now in possession of half the world's
remaining oil
reserves are subject to destabilization for which we can't even
pretend to
predict the consequences-but loss of access to critical energy
supplies is
certainly within the realm of possibility.

Worst of all, we will be destabilizing Pakistan, a nuclear power in an
active conflict with its neighbor, and we will be provoking Russia,
another
nuclear power. The security stakes don't get any higher, and
Americans can
ill afford to ignore nukes.

And I think that this domestic agenda is a tremendous threat to the
security
of anyone who is critical of the government or their corporate
financiers,
and we already know that the real threats are against populations
that can
easily be scapegoated as the domestic crisis deepens.

There is a very real threat right now of creeping fascism in this
country,
and that phenomenon requires its domestic enemies. Historically those
enemies have included leftists, trade unionists, and racially and
nationally
oppressed sectors. This whole "state of emergency" mentality is
already
being used to quiet the public discourses of anti-racism, of
feminism, of
environmentalism, and of both socialism and anarchism.

And while there is token resistance by officials to anti-Muslim
xenophobia,
the stereotypical images have saturated the media, and the government
is
already beginning to openly reinstate racial profiling. It is only a
short
step from there to go after other groups. We have long been prepared
by the
ideologies of overt and covert racism, and racism as both institution
and
corresponding psychology in the United States is nearly intractable.

It's for all these reasons that I say emphatically that we can not
accept
anything from this administration; not their policies nor their
bullshit
stories. What they are doing is very, very dangerous, and the time to
fight
back against them, openly, is right now, before they can consolidate
their
power and their agenda. Once they have done that, our job becomes
much more
difficult.

The left, if it has the capacity to self-organize out of its
oblivion, needs
to understand its critical roles here. We have to play the role of
credible,
hard-working, and non-sectarian partners in a broader peace-movement.
We
have to study, synthesize, and describe our current historical
conjuncture.
And we have to prepare leadership for the decisive conflict that will
emerge
to
first defeat fascism then take political power.

Rosa Luxemburg's words are truer than ever right now. We are not
faced with
a choice between socialism and capitalism, but socialism or
barbarism.  And
what we can least afford are denial and timidity.

On this principle the US has been very consistent in choosing to back the
worst possible alternatives--Somoza, Castillo Armas, Noriega, Papa Doc,
Saddam Hussein, the Shah, you know the list. My guess is that somewhere in
the State Department there's a bunch of apparatchiks who think that an
unpopular government will be more dependent on us for survival, and that
that will maintain the conditions we want. But it hasn't worked. The
problem isn't with realpolitik per se but with how short-sightedly it's
applied. So in the short term in each case the US has gained some regional
stability and protection of US assets. In the medium to long range it's
cost us dearly.

I would guess that our plotting the overthrow of the Taliban began long
before Sept. 11th, and I would further guess that we really do care about
Afghanistan, and not because of oil or poppies. In a chaotic region where
our alliances are fragile in the extreme a government dependent upon us
would serve as a warning to the other governments in the region. Even
during the cold war we had no direct interest in whether a pro-Soviet
regime reigned in Kabul--there was very little likelihood of Communist
takeovers in the region. But the Soviet presence if it had succeeded would
have exerted a restraining pressure on our real or potential allies.

George,

That sounds rather reactionary.

Where is a vision or an alternative plan?

Critique only will bring the same old critique, "You have nothing to
provide in terms of answers. You only criticize. It is easy to criticize."

What about vision? Should poets not provide some vision?

| I think that this response
| is justified.  Just as our fight against Germany and Japan was justified.
| How else should we respond?

I'll come back to that

| These people attacked and killed 6000 people.

Which people? Not the people being bombed and killed.
We are told that someone called bin Laden is responsible and that there is
evidence supporting that but that we may not see it

Why not?

We are told that the war is to bring him to justice and the operation is
called _Infinite Justice_

Then we are told that it will be good enough to kill him, by which time the
operation is called _Enduring Freedom_ and the war aims have changed

Justice for whom? Freedom for whom? Will there be any justice for anyone if
we accede to people we have never met being executed without trial because
some spook says
they are a terrorist

It's not as if the spooks have a particularly good record of being accurate

| Do I want innocent people killed? Of course not but

No _but_ about it. If you don't want innocent people killed, why are you
sanctioning it?

 someone needs to tell me
| what we should do?

No, they don't. *You need to consider the logic of killing innocent people
because we are not able to catch the person responsible for Sep 11

The responsibility to explain is upon those killing innocents and those
supporting them, not on those opposing murder

I was in the village the other day and there was this
| protest against "war"but what is the right response to being attacked?

It varies. In a situation in which you don't actually know who attacked you
and the person you suspect has hidden themselves, it might be best to try to
behave in a way least likely to attract another attack until things change

Coming back to your first question, which I have really already answered, we
are not inanimate objects, which respond predictably. We can choose to do
the unexpected. We have imagination. I think that USA is more afflicted than
UK by the belief that there is a fix for everything, but we are both
afflicted by it

Some things do not have a fix

How should we respond? Sensibly and ethically

Subject:      looking for contemporary French poetry
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="iso-8859-1"
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

I am fluent in French and studied translation for several semesters in
college, and I'm looking for some contemporary French poetry to translate.
For the moment, I'd like to do this purely for recreation.  But I'd like to
work on something which hasn't been translated yet, in case I am successful.

I know almost nothing about contemporary French poetry... really the most
recent poets I've read are Appolinaire and Verlaine, except for a small
anthology called "Tout le Monde se Ressemble," edited by Emmanuelle
Hocquard.  (Thus I know I am not qualified to translate for real-- I just
want to learn the poetry and amuse myself by attempting to translate.) I'm
interested in reading (and possibly translating) avant garde or experimental
work.  I did some translations of Baudelaire several years ago (they were on
someone's web site about French Decadence, which I only discovered by
searching my name on the web!), but that's not what I'm in the mood for now
(i.e. I don't want regular stanzas with a fixed line length).

I don't even know the poetic _movements_ in Franch poetry (well not after
Symbolism, Parnasse, and Surrealism), which is embarrassing.  I did the
French Baccalaureat during a year I spent in France, and for my French oral
I presented Rimbaud and also talked about surrealism.  I did well, but I
don't know anything more recent...  If someone could point me towards a good
anthology, I'd be really grateful for the chance to repair my ignorance.

The French bookstore in New York has no recent poetry at all, so I'd be
looking to see enough of something that I can tell if I like it, and then I
can buy the book from a French online bookstore.

My big project in college was translating 50 pages of Anatole France's
Penguin Island (in particular, the very funny preface doesn't appear in many
English editions.  And the ones that do, don't render the passages that
parody different styles in a way that shows the parody...)

You can repunctuate this and remove one letter to form "Campaign-Stable
Condit," which the newly respectable congressman may just be again, now
everyone's clean forgot about Chandra Levy. This gives credence to the
theory that *he* was behind 9/11...

from yestrerday=E2=80=99s Boston Globe:



''Honors at Harvard has just lost all meaning,'' said Henry Rosovsky,

a top dean and acting president at Harvard in the 1970s and '80s.

''The bad honors is spoiling the good.''

With Harvard's new president, Lawrence Summers, focused on improving

undergraduate studies and set to deliver his inaugural address this

Friday, the Globe reviewed the university's academic records and

internal memos over the last 50 years to analyze the rigors and

rewards of a Harvard education.

The documents indicate that Vietnam and the protest movements of the

'60s led to an increase in lax grading campuswide, and that the

faculty never recovered. Harry Lewis, the current dean of Harvard

College, wrote in one e-mail that humanities professors today can't

tell an A paper from a B paper, partly because of a ''collapse of

critical judgment.''

Actually there is some small truth to this, though Harry seems a bit=20
unhinged.  During the Nam war, 2S student deferments kept the youngins safe=20
from the draft.  Sympathetc professors countrywide got into the habit of not=
=20
failing students who should have failed, knowing that a few failing grades=20
could suddenly transfer an undergrad to the school of jungle warfare.  Grade=
=20
inflation was the result.  Academia has never issued a serious correction,=20
but this is certainly not due solely to the war in the Nam.  These days the=20
culprit is more likely to be students who do not read, and so cannot write.=20=
=20
If faculty routinely failed these students, colleges would close for lack of=
=20
"customers."  Best, Bill

RELEASE INFO

The Postcard Project, which began over a year ago, was the brainchild of
Michael Kelleher, the editor of ELEVATOR, a local small press devoted to
collaborations between artists and poets.  The second such effort by
ELEVATOR, the Postcard Project follows on the success of last year=B9s Box
Project, a collaboration with Buffalo artist Brian Collier.  That project
involved thirteen local poets in a summer long project in which they each
gathered 40 objects to be placed in 40 handmade, masonite boxes, and
composed poems and other writings about the objects they collected. The
exhibition drew a standing room only-crowd at Steel Bar last October at
which several hundred dollars were raised to benefit ELEVATOR.

The Postcard Project began with the mailing of the same postcard, which bor=
e
an image of Buffalo=B9s grain elevators, to poets around the country, asking
that they write something on the back and mail it to Isabelle. When all the
postcards were received, two local books projects began.  The first, by
Kristen Gallagher at handmade books, was to make a small, paper reproductio=
n
of all the postcards, and to bind them with stainless steel nuts and bolts.
This is the =B3paperback edition.=B2  The second project was for Isabelle to
construct forty books out of metal, and to hand paint an image of the
postcard on the cover.

The inspiration came from Isabelle=B9s=B9s own work. Since 1995, she has been
painting a series of postcards called =B3things long seen through the eye I
have in the back of my head,=B2 and working on a series of handmade artist=B9s
books.  In this time she has also completed an apprenticeship in metalwork.
The fruits of this period are thousands of exquisite, hand-painted
postcards, scores of artist=B9s books, and a studio filled with wild and
exotic steel furniture and sculptures.  One of these, =B3Untitled,=B2 a
six-and-a-half foot steel chair-sculpture, which she constructed on a grant
as part of the Artacross Borders Public Art Project, is now on permanent
display in the Tri-Main Center in Buffalo.

Also on hand will be many of the forty poets who collaborated on the
project, who will read from the postcards as part of the evening=B9s events.
The evening will be curated and hosted by Michael Kelleher.  The artist=B9s
books will be sold for 50 dollars apiece.  All proceeds to benefit ELEVATOR=
.

Those interested in purchasing a book can contact Michael Kelleher at
mjk@acsu.buffalo.edu, or by calling him at 716.882.8982.

BOB PERELMAN READS FROM HIS WORK...
Wednesday at 4:30 pm, in UCSD's Visual Arts Performing Space


John Ashbery has written, "Most poets define poetry by creating it, Bob
Perelman creates it by defining it, and is thus one step closer to collidin=
g
with Zeno=B9s vanishing point, to merging Coyote with Road Runner, to winning
the hand." Perelman=B9s poetry also proceeds from real social conscience and
bristles with sharp political satire. His volumes of poetry include Virtual
Reality, The Future of Memory and Ten To One: Selected Poems. Perelman has
also published critical works including The Marginalization of Poetry and
The Trouble With Genius: Reading Pound, Joyce, Stein and Zukofsky. He is
Professor of English at University of Pennsylvania.

What is a Day?


1.


To narrate oneself into a catastrophe with vast and unknowable global
consequences seems trivial, or vain, or both. What does it matter where one
was or what one did or how one reacted or felt or what one thought, if
thinking occurred at all, during or afterwards.

Why should one insert oneself into the cataclysm after the shipwreck of the
singular?

One plus one equals two.
One plus one equals eleven.
One plus six thousand equals six thousand and one.

The eleventh day of the ninth month is an emergency.
In an emergency call 911.

Satan the Joker.

Flight 11 drove overhead, engines so close it could have been inhaling the
air, so one   was being sucked up into the roar, had become the roar.

Out of sleep into nightmare, out of sleep into the visceral recall of
earlier times when every plane carried a bomb, when the night sky was
nothing if not a seedbed of danger. In New York, in lower Manhattan, during
the Second World War, during the Korean War, during the Cold War. Bombs.
Planes with bombs.

Rolled or fell or jumped down onto the floor, covering the head.

Silence for seconds.

Then a great thump, a muted swallowing sound, like a snake a rat. Not a big
crashing sound, but the sound stealth might make on its way to annihilation.

One could see nothing, or rather one could not see the Something that had
just transpired, because the south-facing windows no longer looked out, but
only at the backs of buildings recently constructed into the view.  It took
months for these buildings to go up, the workers only a stone's throw away.
Scaffolds and hard hats and big male voices and reverberating tools. Bit by
bit, the sky is removed, the view of the Towers sealed under the collage of
progress, under the sign of a swollen prosperity. In the first days,
twenty-odd years before, the world included the Hudson River and the
Woolworth Building and the Twin Towers. The days and nights were quiet. The
moon came up and stood visible in the framed sky before going on. Sunlight
streamed through the big south-facing windows, carrying the glittering
facade with it.

In the first place, and until a few years ago, the downstairs was a hum of
activity all night long, long yellow trucks, men loading and unloading
foodstuffs --- eggs and butter and cheese --- to deliver to the restaurants
in the city.  Now the downstairs is called ROOM; it is filled with smart
cool furnishings. Across the street, there are chairs hanging by threads in
the window. They cost, according to The New York Times, $140,000 for a set
of twelve. Slender women in tight pants and slim pointed shoes stand on the
loading dock with their cellphones, speaking with French accents. They do
not smile when one passes them carrying one's groceries.

The neighborhood seems overtaken by a throng of well-dressed young persons
who move as if blind, barely noting the parts of the world that do not
directly address their needs or intentions or designs; they walk as if the
world were put there for them, is a result of their desires. They seem to
have no sense of time, as if nothing existed before they arrived, and
nothing will exist when they leave.

One siren.
Another siren.

Make coffee, get dressed. One is alive after all, after whatever that was.
Turn on the television. One never turns on the television in the morning,
in the day, but something just happened. A bright female voice is talking
to a male voice who is describing sitting on his balcony in Union Square,
sipping his morning coffee, and seeing a jet come in low, too low, calling
to his wife, hey honey, come look at this jet so low over the city. One
sees the image of a shadow plane, the plane's silhouette like a cut-out, a
template, peculiarly dematerialized.

The body and mind in discreet places, wires crossed, thinking one should
get to the basement, take cover, thinking about tornadoes, hurricanes, huge
winds, and bombs. Confused between accident and intent, acts of nature and
acts of man.

One does not remember at what moment Terror took on motivation, pulled the
cause into the effect, the effect into the cause.

Pictures of a tower in flames.

Still, one does not quite register that the plane was that plane, the
towers those towers. One is at the place that the tiny TV screen is making
into an image. See! Look there! Where?  At  passages. The actual collides
with its images.

The cat goes into the closet.

One goes upstairs to the neighbors. We are not good neighbors to each
other, we are poor denizens, neither friendly nor unfriendly, who have
lived with a floor between us for more than twenty years. The neighbor is
wild with worry for her son. Her teenage daughter tries to look as if
nothing is happening. Her television is blasting; one hears the word
"Pentagon".

One goes downstairs. M. is standing near the elevator. She lives on the top
floor with her three sons and her husband, S. the landlord, son of Harry,
who started his butter and eggs business here decades ago. She is wearing a
pretty dress. One mentions the basement; M stares; she mentions the school.
We are not in each other's company. The trajectories of fear do not
intersect; words spoken fly into the dead space of incomprehension.

One goes out. One looks to the right, where a small crowd has gathered on
the northeast corner of Hudson Street, everyone looking up, looking south.
One walks to the corner and looks south. The tower is in flames, orange
flames licking out of the edges as if one had thrown a box into a fireplace.

There are no comparisons. It is not like anything. .

One is back in the house. There is an explosion, the windows rattle, the
building shimmies. A sudden wash of pale grayish particles rains down. The
TV picture turns into a spray of splinters and the sound shreds into a
shimmer of agitating vibrations.

One goes back onto the street. More people, moving and gathering. One walks
to the other corner, the West side. One looks up, the other tower is in
flames. It looks like the first tower. Symmetry.

Tyger, Tyger, Burning Bright
In the Forest of the Night
What

Persons scream, point.

Above, tiny figures are emerging out of the windows, out into the blue air.

Slowly turning out, floating into the air, seemingly weightless, like paper
dolls.

Persons below are weeping, sobbing, running.

Now the whole city is a Siren, an Engine heading downtown.


Immortal Hand or Eye
Could  frame thy Fearful Symmetry?


Even as a little girl, one refused to watch the newsreels of war.

My nephew Richard phones; I tell him I am frightened. He says his friend
David is at home across the street. Richard has recently married; he works
for ABC News. David has recently married; he makes films. They are both in
their early thirties. I leave with a bottle of water and my purse; I do not
shut the windows. I go across the street, ring David's doorbell. David
gives me some scotch, says he is going to pack a bag and walk north, find
his wife who is in the Village.

It takes a village.

David says we can go across the street and close your windows and you can
pack a bag. I say I am too frightened to go back, let's just leave. We
leave, walk north, through pockets and eddies of persons looking bewildered
and scared, some of whom start to run in panic. The sirens are now at a
steady pitch, billowing downstream into the maw of it. I do not look back.

Don't look back.

David keeps saying, "I just want to see my wife". He says, "Now we are
refugees."

At Bank Street, where David's wife is with some of their friends, I do not
want to watch the big TV screen in the small apartment. I do not want to
see any more of it, but I do see the towers collapse like so many gossamer
threads. I do see the shadow shape of the airliner plunge into the tower. I
see the huge orange ball of fire coming out of the side of one of them,
immense flaming innards from a ruptured body.

Everyone in the world is seeing these images.

A wholly Phallic rape, the plane penetrating the material verticality of
the erect.

How big is yours?
I have two.

Mine, mine.

One minus one is zero.

I never liked the Twin Towers. I was working on Broome Street in SoHo in
the early 1970s, as a waitress, shortly after they were completed, and I
saw them each day as I walked to work. I found them totemic and graceless,
not so much minimal as monolithic. If this is world trade, then why is
everything the same? Where is the reciprocity and recognition of
difference? What or where is the Other between two identical objects?

If this is world trade, then why is it so anonymous, so indifferent,
uninflected by the human, so insistently abstract? What are these colossal
vertical plinths, dwarfing all else, meant to mean to a city of
pedestrians, of island wanderers, of immigrants? Where is the space of
dream, the vicissitude of hope and disappointment, the contemplation of the
space between action and consequence?


If this is the world trade center, then where is the world, where is the
trade, where is the center?  Where is the turn of the tide, where the
humility of looking back from far off in space, tiny blue and white ball in
a great sea of change? Where is the horizon, the distant line that gives
definition to days and nights, figures the man and the woman, the beasts of
burden, the road from town to town, from wilderness to city, the space of
voyage, discovery, routes from China, from Spain, from England, over, and
from, sea to shining sea?

Giant step for mankind.

Not trade but power, not exchange, but raw Capital on its hegemonic march.

Upward mobility.

Out of scale with everything around it.

Scale n. a drinking vessel; a bowl; a cup.

The obsolete definition gives way to the two dishes of a balance or a
machine for weighing.


Things weigh in the balance.


The figure of Justice with her scales.


When, twenty years ago, my friend Jennifer had her wedding supper at the
Windows on the World Restaurant, I could feel the tower shift in the wind
like a dry reed.

Eventually, I learned to love the weather play against them, the sapphire
blue of long Manhattan twilights, the dark pewter gauze of cloud or fog or
mist covering their tops like an ethereal hem, the setting sun splashing
its scarlet radiance against their reflective surfaces.

Glass and water.

I thought they were like fish leaping from the water. I wrote, "The Twin
Towers rise like wet fish and as briefly tragic." I saw them then, imagined
them, falling back down, into the water.

Late in the day I go uptown by subway with another nephew, Jack, who is an
architect. He has walked down from his office to Bank Street to get me. We
sit outside together, just down the street from Saint Vincent's Hospital,
which is strangely quiet. I can see a crowd of white uniformed doctors and
nurses milling about, waiting. David and his friends try to give blood, but
the lines are too long. Elizabeth takes some bags of clothes over.
Elizabeth cannot believe her view has been so changed.

When the fighter jets begin to streak overhead, I cannot bear the sound,
cover my ears.

Friendly fire.

3.

On Wednesday morning, my friends Peter and Susie and I set out from their
house on 85th Street. The city is quiet, no traffic, the stores are closed.
We find a gypsy cab, whose driver tells us he can only go as far as 14th
Street. We zip down Ninth Avenue. In the unencumbered distance, we can see
the cloud of orange tinged smoke rising, filling the bright blue southern sky.

We walk south, stop at a Gristedes for some water. A man at the check-out
counter is counting out dollar bills, hundreds of them, to give to the
clerk so she has change for the customers. We buy bottles water and
continue to walk.

We are stopped by a police barricade. I say I live on Duane Street and need
to get my cat. The policeman is gentle, and tells us to go to the next
corner, where I show my ID, and we continue south. We pass a wrecked car
covered in white dust. We stop at Citibank to get some cash. I keep saying,
"There is no way the garage is going to be open. I will not be able to get
my car."  All I want to do is to leave the city.

Fight or flight.

The air is thick with gritty particles. We run into the poet Jackson MacLow
and his composer wife Anne Tardos, who are trying to buy some food, but who
do not want to go further south because the air is too bad. Jackson looks
small and recessed and ashen.

The building where I live is dark and vacant; a sign on the downstairs door
says that my landlord suggests the tenants evacuate because there is no
electricity or gas.

Madonna, my aged cat, named for the pop star, comes out from her hiding
place in the closet. She looks betrayed and resentful.

To the south, where there had been the aspiring pillars, a massive pile
steams and heaves like a beached whale, its great belly engorged with
sorrow and waste.

The man who is always at the Kinney garage is sitting on a chair where he
always sits, at the entrance ramp. He has ebony skin and a kind, chiseled
face. I say the obvious in disbelief: "You are open!" He says, smiling,
without irony, "We are open twenty-four hours a day."

From, for example, the 11th of September until the 12th of September, 2001.
I am thinking, What is a day?  He says he cannot take credit cards or a
check, only cash. I borrow money from Peter.

4.

Now it is October. The days move away from the Day, but the Day stays near,
does not move back in time. It feels as if it wants to attach itself to
another day, equally terrible. There are flags everywhere, messages of
condolence from anonymous companies in the paper, scraps of paper on
buildings with pictures of missing persons. People in the neighborhood seem
to be moving more slowly, with less sureness of where they are going. On
the weekend, a steady parade of persons streams past, cameras around their
necks, to stare at the wreckage. There is a smell of burning, acrid and
gritty, rubbing against the bright autumnal air. The sky where the towers
were is empty, as if time had rolled backwards. The Woolworth building
looks taller, less archaic, like an elderly relative suddenly called to
stand in for the dead.

i am a sick man; i worry constantly that i am dying. my cholesterol is out
of control; i cannot find a doctor. heartburn is so bad i am debilitated
and often cannot function. i am off medication. i cannot sleep; tonight
again is a night full of nightmare and internal violence. it gnaws at me.
it produces my writing. it inhabits my videos. it crawls up my body. i
live with death. i know i will not live long. my brain has been acting up
- the left frontal lobe again. tinnitus has returned with a vengeance; i
hear you only through a high-pitched wine. it is hard to focus on anything
- sleeplessness leaves me nervous and irritable. i cry at the slightest
provocation; try me. my philosophy lives at the edge of my mind. there is
nothing but limit within me; i am striated. when i open my eyes the world
is an irregular grid. i am close to hysteria.

some one of these posts will be my last. i can feel it in my body. i can
feel it in my flesh. the absence... it will be a dropping-away; it will
take time. then you will know it's gone - the writing - the nervous tremb-
ling - the texts - the luridness - the philosophy of no-name. at that
point nothing will matter; the fadeout is endurable; the work drops out,
fades out. look: there are almost no books, no readings, no citations, no
presence. a skein within a skein - the residue of a blemish on the web.
but nothing outside of it - the work is dead. "chances are you have not
read this far." if you have you're one of four or five.

death: i feel it in my bones. i feel the crystals. i feel the cry of the
letters. death shakes them out.

And to argue that we won't get all of them and therefore should do nothing
is absurd. When your house is infested with mice, you kill off as many as
you can and they disappear for a while. When they reappear, you go after
them again. [David Antin]
<snip>

It's not, of course, your house. You merely occupy it, though you hold a gun
to its owner's heads.

Then those mice. Presumably they're refugees from the Great White House
Smoking Out Metaphor. But aren't they also a trope on Bush's *slumbering
giant* references, an example of cognitive blending: a big American cat
chasing tiny, 6'5" bin Ladens?

The practical argument against destroying Afghanistan (and there are plenty
of moral ones as well) isn't one of insufficiency or even that the
terrorists actually live elsewhere - though they seem to, by and large. It's
that destroying ICRC warehouses, ten year old Afghan evil doers, elderly,
burqa clad evil ones and misguided youths from Luton (while dismissing as
appeasers anyone who doubts the efficacy of such action) will create _more_
terrorists than you originally started off with. That might be thought to be
a pity, on the whole.

The US was late into WWII, incidentally. Very late. US appeasement was
motivated by just the sort of diplomatic *enemy's enemy* stance you
advocate, by solipsistic semiotics; Britain's by the memory of carnage.
America's policy was implemented through the 1935 and 1937 Neutrality Acts
and by the 1941 Lend-Lease Act empowering Roosevelt to supply armaments to
'any country whose defence the President deems vital _to the defence of the
United States_.' Thus America entered the war not, as did Britain, following
the invasion of another country but only after the attack upon the US navy
at Pearl Harbour.

That's if we're going to throw phrases like 'peace in our time' about in the
first place.

College Profs Denounce Western Culture, Move to Caves
By David Burge
CNS Satire

Cambridge, MA - Two years ago this month, Alan Lowenstein, associate
professor of philosophy at Harvard University, came to a fateful conclusion.
"I suddenly realized that the oppression of western technology extended to
my own life," he explained. "That's when I got rid of my computer, threw
away my Brooks Brothers suits, changed my name to Grok and moved into a
cave."

A passionate critic of Euro-American "linear thought," Grok is one of a
growing number of college professors around the nation who have relocated to
caves, mud huts and makeshift sweat lodges to demonstrate their disdain for
western culture and technology. For Grok, 44, the move to a cave was a
natural step in his intellectual progression.

"My dissertation at Columbia integrated the seminal works of Jacques Lacan,
Derrida, and Michel Foucault," said Grok, referring to the influential
French deconstructionist philosophers. "I was able to prove, conclusively,
that conclusiveness is not conclusive."

The 1983 dissertation, entitled "Beyond the (Dis)Integration of Post-Modern
Post-Toasties Pair 'o Dimes and Paradigms: Look at How Clever I Am," created
a stir in academic circles and landed Lowenstein a prestigious teaching
position at Harvard. From there, he honed his cutting-edge research.

"I began to deconstruct everything I could get my hands on," said Grok. "The
Old Testament, Shakespeare, Dick and Jane, the 1967 Sears catalog, the
Boston phone book, you name it. I showed how everything is a lie, that
everything could be deconstructed. Except Deconstruction, of course."

When he earned tenure in 1991, Grok decided to broaden his philosophical
research. "I realized that deconstructing literature was overly limiting. It
was clear that other fields of inquiry could benefit from deconstruction."

It was then that Grok published a series of influential articles in which he
deconstructed the sciences. "I initially showed that the so-called
'scientific method,' so treasured by the self-appointed high priests of
science, was nothing but a bizarre ritual of the industrialist phallocracy,"
said Grok. "From there, it was a short intellectual leap to disprove the
reality of the periodic tables, gravity and algebra."

Despite being elected chairman of the Philosophy Department in 1995, Grok
felt an intellectual void. "I needed some way to explain why literature and
science were so bad, so putrid, so incredibly vile," said Grok. "That's when
it dawned on me. They were the products of western culture."

The shocking realization lead Grok to a new stream of research that unveiled
the oppressive nature of western civilization. He immersed himself in the
writings of third world revolutionaries Franz Fanon, Rigoberta Menchu and
Maxine Waters. With CUNY professor Leonard Jeffries, he documented NASA's
theft of earth-orbiting satellites from the Klung bushmen of sub-Saharan
Africa.

"This stream of research completely obliterated the smiling mask of
oppressive western cultural hegemony," said Grok, proudly. "Plus, I got a
fat merit raise out of it."

Strangely ill at ease, Grok was about to have an epiphany. "It was at the
Modern Language Association meeting in Chicago in '97," he explained. "I was
chairing a session on the link between Malibu Barbie dolls and the
Guatemalan counterinsurgency movement. Then it occurred to me. Here we were,
complaining about western science and culture, using animated Power Point
slide presentations. At the Four Seasons, no less. It was just a tad
hypocritical."

The scene caused Grok to re-examine his own life. "I realized then that I,
too, was a victim of white male Eurocentric western culture. My brainwashing
was so complete, so insidious, it took forty-two years to discover it," he
said.

"I think it all goes back to that Stingray bike I got in fifth grade," added
Grok, who grew up in affluent suburban Winnetka, Illinois. "Like other
victims, I became fixated on material things. I shudder to think of that
time, before graduate school, when I considered getting a job."

After the conference, Grok vowed to eliminate the trappings of western
culture in his own life. First to go were his personal computer, his BMW
sedan, his fashionable Back Bay apartment, and his expensive wardrobe. They
were replaced by a typewriter, a bicycle, a phone-free studio apartment and
secondhand clothes.

To his chagrin, Grok realized that the replacement technologies were also
contaminated by western culture. "The wheels on the bicycle, for example,"
noted Grok. "Only western civilization would be as arrogant to speak of
'perfect' circles."

Grok said that each of his attempts to replace western technology brought
more frustration. "Last year, when I was hunkered over the heating grate in
my cardboard box, I realized I was merely a pawn of western industrialists.
They're trying to seduce and entrap the developing world with their
addictive steam and cardboard technology."

Over the last year, Grok continued to cleanse his personal life of western
culture and technology. While he is "not quite there yet," he said he is
finally happy in his 8' by 4' by 4' dirt cave along the banks of the Charles
River.

"Finally, I have broken the cycle of oppression," he said, violently hacking
up a thick clot of blood-streaked mucus. He refused an offer to contact
medical assistance. Noting that "western medicine is merely a front for the
hegemonic pharmaceutical industry," Grok applied another leech to his chest.

"Like the indigenous peoples, I have everything I need here," said Grok.
"Especially stray dogs."

Like the prairie bison to the Lakota Sioux, stray dogs are an important
source of hides, meat and milk for Grok. A committed animal rights activist,
he does not skin or eat the dogs until they have died of natural causes.

Grok said his simplified, non-western lifestyle has made him a more
spiritual man. "Each day, I pray to the dog god for more stray dogs," he
said. He has even sculpted a totem of the dog god, made entirely of dried
dog excrement. He considered cave paintings of the dog god, but rejected the
idea as "too European."

Grok's dramatic commitment to western technology-free living has inspired
others in the academic community. One convert is Eegah, chairperson of the
department of gender studies at the University of Michigan, who now lives in
a creek bed outside Ann Arbor.

"There is something very liberating, very empowering about abandoning
phallocentric culture," said Eegah, who was until recently known as
Katherine Robinson. "Cave dwelling authenticates our visceral experience,
releasing us from the bond of western patriarchal oppression."

As an example, Eegah noted that she is no longer dependent on money. "I have
adopted the traditional barter system of non-western, matriarchal societies.
I get all the furs and meat I need by having sex with hobos."

Eegah said that non-western living has other advantages. "I am liberated
from western notions of female beauty. No longer do I have to shave my
armpits, bathe, or see the dentist," said Eegah, noting that she has lost
fewer than ten teeth since 'going non-western' in 1996.

Duke University english professor Mognuk, formerly known as Phillip Turner,
tried to bring his own commitment to non-western thought directly into the
classroom - or in his case, classcave. Instead of using the department Xerox
machine to print syllabi and exams, Mognuk painstakingly copied each, by
hand, onto tree bark using frog blood for ink. The process is made more
difficult by the lack of daylight before spring semester.

"The Xerox machine is an avatar of the sterility and conformity of
European-based civilization," explained Mognuk, stroking his mud-encrusted
beard. "And it is full of evil spirits."

Kristin Hawley, Duke sophomore and a student in Mognuk's popular class,
E2605 - Fire Bad, said the unconventional course has opened her eyes to the
evils of western hegemony. "Before this course, I had always assumed that
Fire Good," said Hawley. "It wasn't really my fault, I was simply parroting
the western culture propaganda. You know, 'Fire Good, Fire Good.'"

"Because of Professor Mognuk, I now know that Fire Bad - Fire Very Bad,"
added Hawley. "I finally feel my parents are getting something out of that
$30,000 of tuition money."

Back in his Cambridge cave, Grok was stirred from his sleep by the blaring
horns of taxis on Massachusetts Avenue. It was a bitterly cold January
morning, and he insulated himself by slathering his skin with a thick slab
of dog lard and wrapping himself in extra dogskins. Struggling to clear the
snow blocking the cave entrance, Grok emerged squinting against the bright
sunlight as it reflected off the snow and the Boston skyscrapers.

"What a beautiful morning," said Grok. "A tragedy it's spoiled by all the
hateful western technology." He will spend the next hour foraging for a
breakfast of nuts and tree bark in the shadows of Boston's skyline, with
little success.

Hungry and discouraged, Grok attempts to mug a passing jogger by jumping on
his back. However, at 5'6", 123 pounds and weakened by spasmodic coughing,
he posed little threat. Taking pity, the jogger offered Grok a granola bar,
which he hungrily accepted.

"I know it's processed food," said Grok apologetically. "But I used force to
take it from my oppressor. My research shows that this is a legitimate,
non-western method of wealth redistribution."

Clearing the snow from his makeshift twig sundial, Grok noted the time.
"Damn," he exclaimed. "I'm late for my lecture." He hobbled off to class
wearing Wonderbread wrappers on his feet, one of his few remaining
concessions to western technology.

While it has been tough at times, Grok said he has no regrets. "Western
culture is a cancer, and I'm committed to wiping it out. Plus, the whole
cave-dwelling thing should help with my promotion case and journal
articles."

Meanwhile, Grok said he plans one more fling with western technology.

"I'm taking a plane to Washington next week," said Grok. "I'm getting some
sort of award for my deconstructing of the word 'is.'"

Joe Etal. The chances of "terrorists" accomplishing the S11 attack are very
low: I think it was organised by extreme right wing elements from inside the
CIA-military- and others: I think that the planes were flown by remote
control with all passengers and the pilots dead by a radio controlled gas
bombs: then using guidance methods and the auto pilot (switched on and off
as needed) they were flown into the buidings. The Penslyvannia plane was
deliberately sent away from the White house to make it look "real".   Phone
calls could well have been pre recorded etc
  How to get 19 people who are both highly intelligent and also want to
commit suicide: who are young...and having a good time in the US...and no
one "cracks"?  The Muslims might be very religious but they are not that
dedicated so to speak....There has never been a high jack with 4
planes.(that number increases the probability of a "stuff up"). All others
have been outside the US (and most have been a protest against the situation
in Palestine) ... the whole op was undertaken with "military precision" and
there is still NO PROOF and NO EVIDENCE of who did it. Bin Laden denies it
(whereas for Kudos yo'd expect a boast)...
   In fact I believe he has only said something like: "There will be no
peace in America while there is conflict in Palestine."  That seems a good
and intelligent statement.  And I dont see the Taleban as so terrible. They
have their phiosophy and ways of life. We should let them alone.
   The buildings collapsed just too well: like a controlled demolition.
   The US attacks Afghanistan - who have no significant ships or aircraft
steaming or flying toward the US (quite the reverse the Middle eastern
nations are surrounded by massive military ships, subs, and other of the
Western nations ) because they harbour terrorists. For that reason they
should attack about 2000 other countries: maybe they should bomb New Jersey
where the Anthrax (which was of a type apparently was only made by the US
Military).
  Keep this war going and the US will experience some REAL terror.
  Goff is clearly well informed. Its time to go and read Ginsberg's
"America" again.  Richard.

Ray. Study Marxism and the class struggle and US International political
history (start with the Korean war where the US deliberately bombed anything
innocent or others and also hospitals) ( have a look at "Peekshill USA" by
Howard Fast maybe)and have a look at the history of US dealings with
unions - maybe re-read Steinbeck's "The Grapes of Wrath" - and communism
(real or imagined) and read all about the Vienam War ("The Rape of Vietnam"
by H G Slingsby is a good book) and Tricky Dicky and you'll be less
skeptical that the attacks may have been engineered by certain right wing
elements inside your own country who are Christians (so-called) and are the
power behind your government: they are known as the owners of the means of
production.  They need a war right now: its good for business in the long
run.Think how "incredibly" well organised the attack on S11 was: think of
the "military precision" of the attack. Who could organise that?
  So 6000 were killed: so what?  The US in the past has been responsible for
the deaths of  millions either by direct or indirect military and economic
actions. And if they continue with this futile war against an abstract noun
there will be millions more killed or die of starvation disease and so on:
also supposedly "innocent".  Richard.

from a piece in today's NY TIMES about Brother Withers, now officially
recognized by the Catholic church as a hermit:

"' There are lots of hermits,' Brother Withers said.  He is in touch by
email with at least three others, two elsewhere in Pennsylvania.  But there
are more."

I can understand how it might be easier to be a hermit in Pennsylvania, but
thank the lord for the email!

The BELLADONNA* Series presents the final Fall reading:

Lynn Tillman, Abigail Child, Cheryl Pallant

Friday, December 7, 7:00 p.m.

The reading will take place at Bluestockings; New York's only all women's
bookstore, located at 172 Allen Street, between Rivington and Stanton on the
Lower East Side. We begin with a fifteen minute open reading.  For
information and directions, call 212-777-6028.
***
Lynne Tillman is the author of the novels: Haunted Houses, Cast in Doubt,
Motion Sickness and No Lease on Life (National Book Critics Finalist 1998)
and two story collections, The Madame Realism Complex and Absence Makes the
Heart. Her nonfiction includes The Broad Picture, and The Velvet Years:
Warhol's Factory 1965-67. She was a co-editor of Beyond Recognition:
Representation, Power, Culture-Writings of Craig Owens. Her most recent
nonfiction book is Bookstore: The Life and Times of Jeanette Watson and
Books & CO.  Her fiction has been anthologized in, among others, The Norton
Post-Modern Anthology. DAP will soon publish a new collection of her stories
written in relation to artwork by over 25 contemporary artists.

Abigail Child is a writer and film-video maker.  Her films have been shown
extensively in solo and retrospective presentations, at venues such as the
Rotterdam Film Festival, the London Film Festival, ICA London, the Whitney
Museum of American Art, and the Museum of Modern Art NY among others. She
has 5 books of poetry including A Motive for Mayhem (Potes and Poets-1989),
MOB (O Press 1993), and most recently Scatter Matrix (Roof Books 1996).  She
has just completed new manuscript of critical writings about film and poetry
called
This is Called Moving.  Her newest film DARK DARK premiered at the 2001 New
York Film Festival. Both her film and writing are committed to a rhythmic
exploration the syntax: how words and images and sounds come into meaning,
how
disruption of expectations can dislodge the old and bring new concepts into
the present.

Cheryl Pallant is a multi-genre writer, dancer, and performing artist living
in Richmond, VA.  She teaches in the English and the Dance & Choreography
Department of Virginia  Commonwealth University and until recently, for the

Station Hill Press, is her first book of poetry.  Her writing appears in
numerous literary and online journals throughout the U.S., in England,
Australia, and the Czech Republic in places like Confrontation, The Crescent
Review, Wormwood Review, and Lyric. Pallant performs in galleries, museums,
and alleys.
***
        The BELLADONNA*  Reading Series began in August 1999 at the then
newly
opened women's bookstore (New York's only) Bluestockings.  In its two year
history, BELLADONNA* has featured such writers as Erica Hunt, Fanny Howe,
Mei-mei Berssenbrugge, Cecilia Vicuña, Lisa Jarnot, Camille Roy and Nicole
Brossard among many other experimental and hybrid women writers. Beyond
being a platform for women writers, the curators promote work that is
experimental in form, connects with other art forms, and is
socially/politically active in content.  Alongside the readings, BELLADONNA*
supports its artists by publishing commemorative pamphlets of their work on
the night of the event.  In addition, a salon is often held the same weekend
with the writers, addressing aesthetic, political and personal issues in an
informal setting.  Please contact Rachel Levitsky if you would like to
receive a catalog or hear more about these salons.

The best discussion I have seen on the definition of a 'just war'
and a corresponding dissection of both what he terms the
'pacifist fantasy' and the 'militarist fantasy' in our
current circumstances is this richard falk article in The Nation.

to read each Tuesday morning. Go to the bottom for the Stein reference.

I am very much in agreement with the spirit of Ann Kjellberg's letter to
you about the firing of William Wadsworth.  It was especially clear to me
during the annual awards ceremony this year that the organization's welcome
expansion both in activities and aesthetics was proving costly via
long-term supporters, and that the Academy's biggest challenge would be to
develop a new donor base to make up for the fall-off in the old one.  I am
chagrined to see apparent impatience with any transition in this regard,
and an unwillingness to expand the funding base in concert with the
expanded audiences of the Academy.  Or, at least, so must an outsider
attribute this action.  In any case, I add my own protest to that of Ann's
letter below.

Board of Directors
Board of Chancellors
Academy of American Poets
588 Broadway, Suite 1203
New York, NY 10012-3210

Dear Boards of Directors and Chancellors,


I was shocked to learn of the dismissal of Bill Wadsworth as Executive
Director of the Academy of American Poets.  To my eyes this is a grievous
loss for American poetry.  Indeed, it is mystifying.  A person of Bill's
abilities need not have committed himself to such an assignment, but we are
lucky that he did. It has seemed to me that he transformed the Academy into
a vigorous, modern organization that expanded poetry's reach in multiple
directions without ever sacrificing its dignity or seriousness.   Under
Bill the Academy was both populist and classy, and it seemed the most
professionally, ably run institution of its kind in New York. And he was a
sympathetic and sophisticated person who struck a civilized note on behalf
of poetry.

I will miss him, and the character of the organization that he led.  I also
grieve that a person who gave so much to his work, with such visible
success, to all our benefit, should be treated in this way.  At a time
when, especially in New York, we are more than usually uncertain and
vulnerable, and perhaps dependent on our familiar institutions, it seems
unusually self-destructive to rob us of the leadership and presence of such
a person.

Yours sincerely,
Ann Kjellberg

I'm curious about why more people haven't written about the parallels to the
whole Vietnam fiasco, especially the initial stages?

as far as response goes, whether it is connected or not. the chaos and panic
generated by the anthrax scare appears more devastating at this point.

I have read since about 1989 at or with Poetry Live and have given many =
readings as a guest: also there sometimes have been Wystan Curnow, =
Michelle Leggott and many many other poets some "up and coming" and =
others now established so to speak. I'll paste the message sent to me =
below for those who want to know about and or might be visiting New =
Zealand Auckland either now or in the future.  There are other =
activities (some organised around the Auck Uni) and eg at the Dead Poets =
Book Store  K' Road in the George Courts Building in K' Road on =
Saturdays from 2 pm. Poetry Live are opposite inthe Departure Lounge. I =
havent read publically for a while so there is a hiatus which is quite =
dramatically affecting the "scene" - joke of course - but I thought I'd =
propgagate something other than political ravings.
  In fact any visitors from any of the countries on the List are welcome =
to come to my bookstall K Road on Saturdays 10 am to aboput 3.30 pm. I =
also sell through Abebooks.com as Aspect Books.  But K' Road (central =
Auckland - noboddy cant not find it) is a fascinating place and very =
"vibrant" as they say. Political and poetical arguments or harrangues =
and edless diatribes or the usual "drivel" and silly jokes from myself =
(or customers as the case may be) can (but may or may not as the case =
might or might not be, per se) may (be) affect(ed) the (by the) the sale =
or lack of sale or purchase or not or otherwise of books and the =
quantity of celullose being transacted as per the question or not... =

Zukofsky in A and somewhat Pound in the Cantos although he used the very old
notation. John Cage? I had the idea of writing a poem on a musical score as
if writing a concerto or whatever but I am not musical per se: the idea was
to simulate the "ebb and flow" of music, the thematic development, but I
never got around to it!...but the connection Poetry to Music is in its
structural presentation: no one to one correspondence with music.

>
>To veer off the subject a lot I read a( fairly basic book) on modern
usic  - then one about Charles Ives - but what stays on my mind is Bartok's
attempts to  "musicalise" bird song into a complex score: also i remember
thinking how strange and beautiful was the written score (of one of his
works) it looked like a strange poem. But I could never "hear" the music
although I can play the piano I have no "ear" for music. It is an amazing
capacity to be able to "visualise" music so to speak into sounds. Music has
inspired either the poems or the beginnings of the poems of John Ashbery and
many other poets...and so on...

By the way: I'm concerned about that great poet. I hope he is not affected
too detrimentally by the events from and after S11.

Hey,

It's that time again ... the fourth Anti-Reading will
take place this saturday from 1:30-4:00 at Tonic.
Expect the usual suspects and a few new faces.

Come rain or shine. Hope to see you there.


Anti-Reading

Tonic
(107 Norfolk Street -- F to Delancey)

November 3, 2001

1:30 ? 4:00 pm

Free

For those that associate boredom (and we all do) with
literary functions, Loudmouth Collective presents an
anti-reading of new work by Matvei Yankelevich, Joel
Schlemowitz, Ryan Haley, James Hoff, Wanda Phipps,
Ellie Ga, Marisol Martinez, Julien Poirier, Filip
Marinovic and many others.

Following the success of  earlier anti-readings at
Tonic, Loudmouth Collective is presenting the fourth
installment of this bi-monthly literary carnival.
Expect live typewriter art, concrete poetry, language
installations, paperless books, poetry film and loads
of free books.

By providing a bi-monthly forum for the experimental
presentation of literature, Loudmouth Collective seeks
to re-evaluate the literary reading as it has come to
be known today, recasting it as something more than an

While it is true that some professors in the 60s chose not to fail male
students known to be clutching student deferments, that phenomenon does not
track closely with the subsequent, more wide-spread phenomenon of "grade
inflation."

More significantly, to me, is the rhetorical force of charges of "grade
inflation."  This has caught on like the "Peter Principle" of yore, by
which each was encouraged to see another as somebody who had been promoted
to his or her maximum level of incompetence.  While I continually hear
professors complain of "grade inflation," I seldom hear anybody say, "I
have been inflating grades for years, and it's a terrible thing.  I should
stop at once."  The grade inflation seems always to be going on in someone
else's grade book.

What might bear investigating is the fact that SAT scores suffered a
depression during the time period that witnessed a massive expansion of the
population aiming itself toward college, while grades on average went
up.  and somehow that hasn't been generally taken as a reason to question
the predictive powers of the SAT.

MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII

Fleda Brown, University of Delaware Professor, is the first named Poet
Laureate for the State of Delaware.  Gov. Minner presented the award to
Fleda on Friday, October 26th, at the Arts Summit in Dover.  "She will
serve as the state's poetry advocate, promoting poetry and creativity
through out Delaware,"  Minner said.

In her acceptance speech, Fleda talked about what real poetry is to
her. She said:

"What poetry and all the arts do for us is look below the surface of
experience, look below our tendency to rely on cliche as an easy way to
explain what our experience means. Good poems reject cliche. That's why
oppressive regimes have always been afraid of poets. Radical,
fundamentalist regimes like the Taliban, like the Bolsheviks in Russia,
have needed people to accept what they're told, to repeat the religiously
or politically correct clich until they believe it.  Real poetry takes
risks with language, which is really taking risks with experience. Real
poetry finds a different reality, not the easy one. Sometimes what it sees
is beautiful, sometimes it's not. We writers have to think hard and learn
to be very precise with language so that we don't get sidetracked by glib
phrases. Real poetry is always beautiful in the language of the kind of
truth that comes from what the poet William Butler Yeats called the
"rag-and-bone shop of the heart."

Fleda also read her poem "For the Inauguration of William Jefferson
Clinton, 1997" to the audience.

The nomination committee,  (three out-of-state professionals in the
field of poetry) chose Fleda from a slate of six finalists.  Criteria
included quality of work, influence over other writers, a national and
statewide reputation, a commitment to literature and poetry education, and
an ability to represent the State of Delaware in public functions.

Among the various amusing numerologies that have been
wrung out of the spongey number 9-11, there was one
that's been totally overlooked:

The regulated "Hoist and Fly" (width to length) ratio
of the American flag is

             1:19

that is, obviously, 911 backwards.

             :)

"Power doesn't exist in a vacuum."  That this is a truism doesn't diminish
its reality.  The issue is not whether or not to have power, a really silly
thought, but rather, who will have the power?  How will the power be
exercised?  In what ways will the power manifest itself?  Do we want those in
power to lie and steal and murder in our names?  I mean, real questions.  So
here's a fellow (MSgt Goff) who wants power to be administered in a more fair
and humane way -- and he scares the shit out of Bill.  Poor Bill; one wonders
what bodily properties the current dispensers of power scare out of him?  Or
does Bill, and the rest of us, diffidently wash our hands of the whole power
thing, and look for our wisdom in Sean Penn?  Actually, of course, the quote
doesn't belong to Penn, but to James Jones, and I can tell you that he knew
something of the evil of power, particularly when it was in evil hands -- and
I don't think that he would have equated MSgt Goff with the current ruling
elites, whose exercise of power is directed towards the continued
accumulation of massive wealth, and whatever they have to do to get it.
Unlike MSgt Goff's suggestions, their motives are not predicated at any
ethical level.

Genocide Scholar "Silenced" on Academic List For Comments
About Bombing of Afghanistan

By CounterPunch Wire

Genocide scholar Adam Jones claims he has been "silenced" on H-Genocide, an
academic mailing list for the genocide-studies community, after attempting to
post materials and commentary on the U.S.-led military campaign against
Afghanistan.

Jones, 38, is a Canadian professor of international studies at the Center for
Research and Teaching in Economics (CIDE) in Mexico City. He is executive
director of <A HREF="http://www.gendercide.org/">Gendercide Watch</A>, a Web-based educational initiative that
confronts gender-selective atrocities against men and women worldwide.

In three consecutive rejected posts to the H-Genocide list, to which he
subscribes, Jones cited testimony from humanitarian organizations and United
Nations staffers to the effect that the bombing campaign against Afghanistan
was the major impediment to the delivery of desperately-needed food aid to
the Afghan civilian population. In the first post (12 October 2001), Jones
asked: "If coalition leaders are aware of the present situation, as most of
the major humanitarian agencies and international media appear to be, and
choose to continue the bombing in coming weeks ... could any resulting
largescale mortality legitimately be termed genocidal?" (For the full text of
the rejected posts, and correspondence with the H-Genocide list editor, see <A HREF="http://adamjones.freeservers.com/h-genocide.html">
http://adamjones.freeservers.com/h-genocide.html</A>.)

Jones has also been outspokenly critical of the Taliban regime's attempts to
impede the delivery of humanitarian aid. In his second rejected post to
H-Genocide (22 October 2001), he expressed "strong criticism of the Taliban's
recent behaviour towards foreign aid-workers, local staff, and food stocks in
the country. If the Allies are indeed angling for genocide, the Taliban, with
their harassment, assaults, and seizures, seem more than prepared to play the
same 'game'."

List editor Alan Jacobs' reply to Jones's second attempted post stated that
the H-Genocide editorial board's "overwhelming opinion was that we were not
going to publish a message that escalated the human tragedy that is
developing to the status of genocide. This was seen ... [as] a rather large
error." In response, Jones wrote (in the third rejected post, 23 October
2001): "There seems to me a fundamental question to be asked here. Is it up
to the list editors to decide what can legitimately be considered a genocide
and which interpretations are 'erroneous,' and to accept or reject posts on
this basis? Is not the appropriate place to discuss and debate this issue the
list itself?"

"TERRORIST APOLOGISM"

The visceral response of the H-Genocide editors to posts perceived as
"anti-American" was amply on display in the invective they directed against
Jones. In excerpted comments from their decisions, forwarded to Jones at his
request on 24 October 2001, editorial board members referred to him as "a
loose cannon" whose writings were "libelous and disgraceful" and evoked
"anger and revulsion"; and who taught at "a hot-bed of anti-American and
anti-Western thought." (Jones's institution, CIDE, is in fact a small,
exceedingly mainstream research institute in the Mexican capital.) One
editorial-board member accused Jones of "terrorist apologism [of the type]
that is unfortunately becoming popular among the enemies of this great
country [i.e., the United States]," while another claimed he is "simply
sophomoric or ... intentionally manipulative." Eight out of nine list editors
are based in the United States.

The rejection of the posts, and the editorial board's comments about Jones,
have generated significant controversy in the genocide-studies community. In
a message to list editor Jacobs (25 October 2001), Norwegian scholar Hans
Egil Offerdal wrote: "The responses that the editorial board has given is
[sic] based on prejudice and a political philosophy that at best can be
described as reactionary." British genocide scholar Mark Levene also wrote to
Jacobs on 25 October 2001: "If there is any scholarly arena where ... the
right to free opinion should be upheld it is surely in the field of
[genocide] studies. In this context your committee's muzzling of Dr Jones'
views is nothing short of outrageous."

The "muzzling" is part of a broader pattern, according to Thomas Taaffe of
the University of Massachusetts. "Censorship of any comments which even seem
to criticize U.S. foreign policy has been rampant on this supposedly
international listserve [H-Genocide], while others have had free reign to
advocate military action against the Taliban, even before the events of
September 11th. It is quite ironic for a listserve supposedly dedicated to
preserving life." (Message to Jones, 25 October 2001.)

In response to the apparent censorship on H-Genocide, Jones and others have
created a new mailing list, Genocide_Studies, on Topica.com. Among its stated
purposes is to "serve as an alternative outlet for posts rejected by the
H-Genocide editorial board."

"It's clear to me that what has taken place on H-Genocide in the past couple
of weeks is nothing less than the politically-inspired censorship of
alternative views," Jones stated from his office in Mexico City. "As such, it
seems amply in keeping with the 'chill' that has descended over political
discussion and debate in the United States, and elsewhere, since the
atrocities of September 11. But it is particularly disturbing to see a
censorious mindset reigning among editors of a mailing list that claims to
'make every effort to encourage a free exchange of ideas'.

"This is doubly indefensible when, if the bleakest assessments are accurate,
we could be facing mass civilian death on a scale seen only rarely, if ever,
since the Second World War. To the extent that I and other genocide scholars
and activists are able to call attention to the actions of the H-Genocide
editors, this needs to serve the immeasurably larger purpose of generating
urgent concern for the people of Afghanistan. The humanitarian crisis has
been grossly underreported in the U.S. press so far.

"It is a legitimate question whether mass death from starvation, crucially
spurred by Allied bombing, could be called 'genocide'," Jones said. "I
personally think it could. Other genocide specialists could reasonably
disagree -- if they were allowed to hear the proposition put to them in the
first place. It's a real shame that the discussion can't take place on
H-Genocide.

"But whatever terminology we use won't make a shred of difference to Afghans
who have starved to death. It may already be too late to save hundreds of
thousands of them. If it isn't, and even if it is, the coming days and weeks
are critical. I very much hope that moral policies will prevail, and aid will
reach those who need it. But I've seen no sign of this so far, and time is
terrifyingly short."

Yes.  When I went to school at Columbia in 1990, there was a very small =
gap gradewise between the best students and the worst.  If your paper =
was good, it got an A or an A-. If it was on topic and not totally =
stupid but not good, it got a B+.  If not good and the person couldn't =
write, it was a B.  And you had to really try to get a B-. C's were =
unthinkable.

This was less true in other subject areas than writing/English/etc.  I =
got a well-deserved C+ in Chinese because I hadn't been going over my =
character flash cards enough because I was busy with math stuff.  =
Actually, I probably deserved an F and not a C+... but that would have =
ruined my otherwise good transcript and everyone wanted me to get into =
grad school :-( ... in other words  thete was a lot of grade inflation.

What I dfon't understand is why grade inflation is supposed to be so =
bad.  It makes people feel better to get a B than an F.  And they still =
know that the B is a bad grade, so it's not as if there is no way to =
tell if your paper was good.  I think complaints about grade inflation =
come mostly from the people who got A's and want everyone to know that =
_their_ A's were real, not inflated...

''Honors at Harvard has just lost all meaning,'' said Henry Rosovsky,

a top dean and acting president at Harvard in the 1970s and '80s.

''The bad honors is spoiling the good.''

undergraduate studies and set to deliver his inaugural address this

internal memos over the last 50 years to analyze the rigors and

rewards of a Harvard education.

The documents indicate that Vietnam and the protest movements of the

'60s led to an increase in lax grading campuswide, and that the

faculty never recovered. Harry Lewis, the current dean of Harvard

College, wrote in one e-mail that humanities professors today can't

Jabes (trans. Waldrop):


"For all my being bound to the French language, I know the place I occupy
in the literature of France is not strictly speaking a place. It is not so
much the place of a writer as of a book which does not fit any category. A
place defined, then, by the book and immediately claimed by the book to
follow. A place of writing vacated by what is written, as if every page of
the book let us occupy it only to give access to the next page, as if the
book made and unmade itself in an appropriated space which, once covered
with words, becomes the space of the book.

"And it is likewise within the large movement which has carried my works
to their illusory completion.

"There is no center. There is a point which engenders another point around
which an eccentric utterance establishes itself, an interrogation
develops. It is the point of no return.

"This absence of place, as it were, I claim. It confirms that the book is
my only habitat, the first and also the final. Place of a vaster non-place
where I live."

This I identify with. Every text of mine, like the Net of Indra, reflects
every other. Each deals with, extends, the themes; the result, a family of
themes, never returns to an illusory origin. Each moves in a direction as
far as possible from the conception of a center. Each negates the tendency
towards an absolute, constructs skeins or membranes where others might
find ladders or stairs. The beds are tilted; the windows don't close, the
doors are always open. The night that is upon us is also the day; the day
has many suns. It doesn't stop there.

I close my eyes; I create the objects of which I claim witness. They smell
of musk.

I'm not sure who wrote this, as there were two signatures above, but I don't
agree. I think that the Jews as wanderers, as outsiders, as exiles, as
thorns in the Christian myth, as "Keepers of the Book," had value, morally
and poetically, that they've lost. Strangely, I agree with the
ultra-orthodox rabbis here, who say that Israel is not a place, but a
belief. Now with territory to defend, the Jews, at least the Israelis, have
become like everyone else. Before they defended themselves with great
intellect, learning, ideas. Now kill instead of teach, which make them the
same as most everyone. Pity. There is no safe haven for anyone, anyway.

Frederick AND The List. .  This was very interesting: somewhere between the
extreme concept
of a deliberate plot within the US and one from the "Outside":  "the desert
of the real"...its interesting how this is like a virtual reality (or
irreality) and a movie where Sondheim's recursives might be as appropriate
as anything...a "poetic war"...getting like a lot of the fantasy books and
films, even like something from Swift: some strange darkness pervading:  Bin
laden speaks poetically, Bush invokes poetry and rhetoric, so do the
Taleban: "we will bury their skulls in the montains ".... sounds like
something said by Sargon or one of those early conquerers: or patches from a
hodge-podge of hollywood scipts, some good, some bad....makes me want to get
the video of "the Matrix ' and look at that film again...also I think of
"Star Wars"...
  I think that the US, the whole World should have had a very long and large
conference involving A Quaeda and many others such as the Palestinians.
  The US and the British needed to discuss not who to  attack but they
needed to find out why these attacks took place without any question of a
useless retaliation (terrible as it has been I know for the people of the US
and New York I'm not unfeeling for that: I wouldnt be so concerned and so
voluble  (and I know often contradictory) about this if I didnt care about
people - including cleaners accountants - ANYONE - and others their lives)
..dare I say it the US Britain and the other nations might have to actually
accede to some of the demands: Bin Laden (and the Palestinians) wants peace
and some justice in Isreal: let the US and Israel and everyone show him -
assure him in the ways he wants that something real is being done: the US
might have to cut any ties with Israel and so on. Military weaponry pulled
BACK from any where near the Middle East. Dismantled: maoney spent more on
humane science.  Instead of this monstously - obscenely expensive new
killing machine with wings: probably aid to Africa, Asia, south America and
the East setting those countries up and son. Less political interference.
Not "Imperilaism as Aid".  Real help. A real look at the issues: poverty
outside and inside Western nations, poverty and AIDs everywhere, economic
difficulties, the fact that there IS a class war continuing: Communism still
as a viable option (after all Communism has NOT been destroyed: an idea
can't collapse..certain countries that called themsleves Communist are in
(more or less disarray)) as Communisim means sharing and it is also
ultimately very efficient. The motivation becmes production for and by the
people: the need for wars declines as more and more people slowly gain a
better standard of living and live in a cooperative and somewhat a
competitive environment. India in contrast to China immediately shows how
Communism DOES work: or at least socialisation of the country and some
progress in education, standards of living etc (The Indian army is making
raids into Kashmir and women are bing killed and raped and others are being
killed: so India is another country that needs to be looked at as well as th
US and China and son on: Evryone Evrywhere) . To the extent that it isnt
working in China is because of counter revolutionary forces, not because
communism is impossible or undesirable in the long term. The control at all
levels by the people of the means of production may mean that the Bush's and
the Bill Gates's and the big Capitalists each have to take pay cuts and live
"frugally" but they wont be any less happy.  As the people of the world
gradually become better educated the struggle against capitalism is (and
will) accelerate....to sanitise it people have used the term "globalisation"
translate that to "capitalist imperialism by international corporations"
with the "major player" being the United States (currently "in charge" of
the pretty dodgily named "United Nations") ....
    No, David Antin is quite wrong: the destruction even of the Nazis didnt
lead to a "better " world because the fundamental problems were not
"addressed": wars continued, the US took over the inperialist role of
Britain Germany France etc the working class need now to enjoin the struggle
against capitalism which is currently very weak: so weak that it is making
an insane "dash" to Afghanistan to Bury its Skull there.  Whatever the
outcome: it will be a hard and bitter Winter. As Mao Tse Tung said: "The
Imperialists lift a rock only to drop it on their own heads which they
repeat until their doom".
  Or they can discuss and NOT attack - assuming that anyone is actually a
candidate for an attack. As the war drags on, and skulls get buried,  people
will realise that terrorism (or the possiblilities of its enactment), will
actually get more vicious when (ultimately) there is another retaliation (or
another Bush or his cohorts organise another attack if we can buy into that
senario - who knows?)
  I say these things because I would rather things got better not worse:
Antin is  frightened. So am I: but my rational side tells me that war of any
kind by the Imperialists is useless: the American people and the great
things of American and Western culture will be sacrificed to the interests
of Paranoid Capitalism.
  But this was a very interesting link. Thanks. Richard.

In this respect Bush was quoted before S11 of wanting or boasting that the
US would "open the spigot". Richard.

Your response to Germany and Japan was 2.5 years after we were
fighting fascism.
Of course that was better than WWI, when you were three years late.
